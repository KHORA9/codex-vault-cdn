Tilden seems to have had a\r\nsense of its importance not ordinarily felt by youth of his age. This\r\nmay be accounted for in part by the circumstance that while barely out\r\nof his teens, both by pen and speech, he had secured the respectful\r\nattention of many of the leading statesmen of his generation. At\r\nschool he preserved all his composition exercises, and from that time\r\nto the close of his life it may well be doubted if he ever wrote a\r\nnote or document of any kind of which he did not preserve the draft\r\nor a copy. As the events with which he had to deal came to assume, as\r\nthey naturally did, increasing importance with his years, one or more\r\ncorrected drafts were made of important papers, most, if not all, of\r\nwhich were carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nAs what may fitly enough be termed Mr. Tilden's public life covered\r\nmore than half a century, during most of which time he was one of the\r\nrecognized leaders of one of the great parties of the country, the\r\npublic will learn without surprise that the accumulations of social,\r\npolitical, and documentary correspondence which fell into the hands of\r\nhis executors, to be measured by the ton, embraced among its topics\r\nalmost every important political question by which this nation has\r\nbeen agitated since the accession of General Andrew Jackson to the\r\nPresidency in 1829.\r\n\r\nA collection of _Tilden's Public Writings and Speeches_ was published\r\nin 1885, only a year before his death, but very little of his private\r\ncorrespondence appeared in that publication.\r\n\r\nThe duty imposed upon his executors of looking through such a vast\r\ncollection of papers and selecting such as would be profitable for\r\npublication has been a long and a very tedious one. They indulge the\r\nhope, however, that the volumes now submitted will be found to shed\r\nupon the history of our country during the latter half of the last\r\ncentury much light unlikely to be reflected with equal lustre from\r\nany other quarter. It will also, they believe, help to transmit to\r\nposterity a juster sense than as yet generally prevails of the majestic\r\nproportions of one of the most gifted statesmen our country has\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nTilden may be said to have fleshed his maiden sword in politics as a\r\nchampion of President Jackson in his war against the recharter of a\r\nUnited States bank of discount and deposit. He next became somewhat\r\nmore personally conspicuous as a fervent champion of Mr. Van Buren's\r\nsubstitute for the national bank, now known as the Assistant Treasury.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 he led the revolt of the Democratic party in New York State\r\nagainst the creation of five slave States, with their ten slave-holding\r\nSenators, out of the Territory of Texas. Among the immediate results of\r\nthis revolt were the defeat of General Cass, the Democratic candidate\r\nfor President, and the development of a Free-soil party, which later\r\ntook the name of the Republican, nominated and elected Abraham Lincoln\r\nto the Presidency--synchronously with which, and for the first time in\r\nthe nation's history, the decennial census of 1860 disclosed the fact\r\nthat the political supremacy of the nation had been transferred to the\r\nnon-slave-holding States.\r\n\r\nThough averse to resisting the secession of the slave States by\r\nflagrant war, Tilden did his best and much during the war to prevent an\r\nirreconcilable alienation of the people of the two sections, while at\r\nthe same time building up for himself a reputation in his profession\r\nscarcely second to that of any other in the country; and by it, before\r\nhe had reached the fiftieth year of his age, a fortune which made him\r\nno longer dependent upon it for his livelihood.\r\n\r\nThe first public use he made of this independence was to retrieve the\r\nfortunes of the Democratic party by delivering the city of New York\r\nfrom a municipal combination which was threatening it with bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nOf Tilden's many achievements as a public servant, it may well be\r\ndoubted if there was any for which he deserves so much honor as for his\r\npart in the overthrow of this pillaging combination, familiarly known\r\nas the Tweed Ring, nor any for which it seems so entirely impossible\r\nto have then provided another equally competent leader who could and\r\nwould have given the time, incurred the expense, and assumed the risks\r\nthat Mr. Tilden did when, with no personal advantage in view, he boldly\r\nconsecrated several of what might have been the most lucrative years\r\nof his professional life to this desperate battle with intrenched\r\nmunicipal villany.\r\n\r\nThe people of the State were not slow to realize that a man with the\r\ncourage, power, and resources exhibited by Mr. Tilden in this memorable\r\nconflict was precisely the kind of man needed by them for Governor; and\r\nwhile yet wearied with the fatigue and covered with the dust of this\r\nmunicipal struggle, he was constrained by his admirers to enter the\r\nlists as a candidate against General Dix, the Republican candidate for\r\nthat office. The result was a change of about 100,000 votes from the\r\nnumber by which Governor Dix had been elected two years before, and\r\nTilden's triumphant election to his place.\r\n\r\nWithout doffing his armor, and even before his investiture with his new\r\nrobes of office, he instituted an elaborate investigation of the canals\r\nof the State; so that he had been but a few weeks in office before\r\nhe was engaged with numerically a far more formidable foe than the\r\none over which he had just triumphed, but one for which his official\r\nposition happily equipped him with far superior resources. His triumph\r\nover the Canal Ring of the State was consequently so short, quick, and\r\ndecisive as to give him a national reputation, and to make him, long\r\nbefore his term of office at Albany expired, the inevitable candidate\r\nof his party to succeed General Grant for the Presidency. He was\r\nunanimously nominated by the Democratic National Convention, held at\r\nSt. Louis in 1876, on the second ballot, and was elected by a popular\r\nmajority of over 250,000. He was then destined to receive a distinction\r\nnever shared by any President of the United States, of being an elect\r\nof the people for that office, which, by the operation of a tribunal\r\nunknown to the Constitution, was given to another.\r\n\r\nFor the remaining ten years of his life Tilden's health prevented his\r\nbeing wholly a candidate or wholly not a candidate, so reluctant were\r\nhis numerous friends to give up all hope of such a restoration of\r\nhealth as would enable him to resume once more the leadership of his\r\nparty. In this they were disappointed.\r\n\r\nThus for more than half a century Mr. Tilden was a shaper and a maker\r\nof American history. What kind of history and by what means it was made\r\nthese volumes are expected to render more clear to the world, and his\r\nfame perhaps more enduring.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden's life, like that of Israel's second king, was, as we have\r\nseen, a life of almost constant warfare, and of course he was always\r\nmore or less liable to be viewed by partisan eyes and judged with only\r\npartial justice. None of us can judge himself quite correctly until he\r\ncan look back upon his conduct after a considerable lapse of years. So\r\nwe only see a public man as he is entitled to be seen, as Moses was\r\npermitted to see his Lord: after He had passed. It is to be hoped that\r\nsufficient time has elapsed since Tilden was taken from us to enable us\r\nto see by the reflection of his life in this correspondence how lofty\r\nwas the plane of his entire public life, and how correctly he judged\r\nhis qualifications for a successful political career when he said that\r\nhis party standards were too high for the multitude. They were too\r\nhigh, unquestionably, for what is commonly understood as success in\r\npolitics. It would have been easy for him--as these pages will show--to\r\nhave been President had his ethical standards been nearer the average\r\nof those of the parties of his time.\r\n\r\nWithout presuming to institute any invidious comparisons, I have no\r\nhesitation in expressing my conviction that neither in the writings,\r\nspeeches, or literary remains of any President of the United States\r\nthus far will be found more suggestions profitable for teaching, for\r\nreproof, for correction, and for the instruction of any American\r\nwho aspires to be a maker of a nation's laws or an administrator of\r\nthem, than will be found in Mr. Tilden's Writings, Speeches, and\r\nCorrespondence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the permission of Messrs. Houghton & Mifflin, I have prefixed\r\nto these volumes an \"Appreciation\" of Mr. Tilden by the late James\r\nCoolidge Carter, which originally appeared in the _Atlantic Monthly_ of\r\nOctober, 1892. Mr. Carter's eminence at the American bar and forum, and\r\nhis relations, both personal and professional, with Mr. Tilden, give\r\nvalue to his judgment of his deceased friend which, both for the honor\r\nof himself and of Mr. Tilden, is entitled to all the prominence that\r\ncan be given to it in these volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. TILDEN\r\n\r\nAN APPRECIATION, BY JAMES C. CARTER\r\n\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance with Governor Tilden began a few years before the\r\nWar of the Rebellion, and my first impressions were not favorable to\r\nhim. Completely dominated by the combined and swelling impulse of\r\npatriotism, passion, and aspiration under which the Republican party\r\nwas then gathering its mighty hosts, I was in no condition to tolerate\r\nanything in the nature of opposition to the movement, or even to\r\nappreciate the reasons upon which any such opposition might be founded.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the war was over, when the passions had subsided, when\r\nit became necessary to cultivate the arts of peace and to restore the\r\nwaste and ruin which war had wrought, that I was inclined to extend\r\nany hospitality to the qualities for which he was most distinguished,\r\nor to lend any ear to his teachings. Drawn from year to year into a\r\nnearer acquaintance with him, and having occasion, when he came to fill\r\nstations of influence and power, to observe the ready sagacity and easy\r\nskill with which he conceived and carried through important measures\r\nfor the redress of errors and frauds in public administration, I became\r\nmore and more impressed with his prodigious superiority to other men.\r\n\r\nWhat he would have been able to accomplish had he been permitted to\r\nassume the functions of the great office to which the majority of\r\nhis countrymen believed him to have been elected is matter of idle\r\nconjecture only; but the list of his achievements during the few years\r\nin which, upon a narrower theatre, he acted a public part can hardly\r\nbe matched. Omitting from view the splendid contributions made by him\r\nfrom time to time, prior to 1871, by papers and speeches upon the\r\nprinciples of politics and the methods of governmental administration,\r\nand taking note only of the practical measures in the conception and\r\nexecution of which he was the leader during the five short years\r\nin which, either as a private citizen or as public officer, he was\r\nactually engaged in the public service, we can distinctly impute to him\r\nthe following results: In 1871 he seized the opportunity, suggested by\r\nthe disclosure and publication of the prodigious sums drawn from the\r\nNew York city treasury by way of pretended payment of municipal debts,\r\nto endeavor to fasten upon the principal city officials the crime,\r\nuniversally suspected, but of which there was no proof, of having\r\ncorruptly embezzled to an enormous extent the moneys of the city. By a\r\nlong and patient tracing of a multitude of accounts in different banks,\r\nhe reached a series of results which, when compared, not only disclosed\r\nbut conclusively demonstrated, by competent legal evidence, the whole\r\nscheme of fraud, the officials engaged in it, and the amounts received\r\nby each. Although a strict party man and chairman of the Democratic\r\nState Committee, yet, finding that the Democratic organization of the\r\ncity of New York could not be wrested from the control of the official\r\ndelinquents, he organized and led the popular movement which effected\r\ntheir overthrow. He accepted, at the same time, a nomination for the\r\nlegislature, was elected, and extorted from a reluctant majority the\r\nimpeachment of the corrupt judges who had disgraced the judicial\r\nermine. In 1874, when the craze for fiat money had become prevalent\r\nthroughout a great part of the country, and more threatening to the\r\npublic prosperity than the free-silver delusion has at any time\r\nbeen, he drew from the Democratic State Convention of New York the\r\nfirst condemnation which it had received from either of the national\r\nparties. Elected in that year as Governor of the State, he conceived\r\nan extensive series of reforms in administration, drew the necessary\r\nlegislative bills, secured their adoption, and carried them into\r\neffect. These plans contemplated, by the adoption of new methods and\r\nvarious economies, extensive reductions in the public expenditures, the\r\ninstitution of suits for the punishment of frauds of public officers,\r\nand the recovery of moneys embezzled by them. They had very large\r\npractical results.\r\n\r\nNor was he less efficient in baffling mischievous schemes. The\r\nDemocratic organization of Tammany Hall, reorganized, after the\r\noverthrow of Tweed, under the leadership of John Kelly, an able and\r\nnot dishonest partisan chief, demanded from the Democratic majority\r\nin the legislature the passage of laws designed to secure to that\r\norganization a more complete control of the municipal patronage.\r\nGovernor Tilden refused to lend his countenance to this policy, and\r\nthe imperious leader undertook to force him into acquiescence by\r\nforming a combination in the legislature with the numerous adherents\r\nand stipendiaries of what was known as the Canal Ring. That coterie of\r\nmen, powerful in both parties, had already scented the peril to their\r\npractices threatened by the Governor's reformatory plans, and were\r\nonly too willing to join in a warfare against him. He suddenly found\r\nhimself in danger of being deserted by a majority of his own party.\r\nThe Democratic Speaker of the Assembly took the floor, and arraigned\r\nhim as unfaithful to the Democracy of the State. He had long before\r\nseen the possibility of this combination against him, and had sought by\r\nthe practice of all the conciliatory arts, of which he was a thorough\r\nmaster, to prevent it. When it came, he was not daunted by it, but\r\nboldly went behind his enemies to the constituencies which they were\r\nbetraying. They soon found that they were dealing with an adversary who\r\npossessed resources which they had not taken into account. Most of them\r\nabandoned their opposition. The rest were severely dealt with by their\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nNever were the possibilities for good of a great office like that\r\nof Governor of New York so happily developed and displayed. In the\r\ncourse of an administration of two years, an enormous reduction in\r\ntaxation was effected; the administrative system in every department\r\nwas improved; the lobby was almost dispersed; and at the same time the\r\nGovernor, in his communications with the public through his annual\r\nmessages, his veto messages, and speeches upon official and other\r\npublic occasions, was furnishing to the people of the State, and indeed\r\nof the whole country, a nearly complete exposition, theoretical and\r\npractical, of the whole work of public administration. I have never\r\nread a state paper which equals his second annual message in the power\r\nand ease with which it treats of the principles upon which government\r\nshould be conducted, or in the order and perspicuity with which it\r\narranges and sets forth the details of public business. In this paper\r\nhe considers at much length the then depressed condition of business,\r\nits causes, and the proper remedies. It may be thought--was thought\r\nat the time by some--that this was going beyond the domain of state\r\naffairs in order to make an ambitious display of knowledge upon the\r\nlarger concerns of the nation; but it would be well if every man\r\npossessing such knowledge as is here exhibited, and such a capacity\r\nfor communicating it, would embrace all opportunities to display it.\r\nGovernor Tilden, however, had a special motive in placing his views\r\nbefore the country at that time. He saw the false policy of indefinite\r\nissues of government legal-tender currency everywhere taking hold of\r\nthe public mind, and that, unless speedily corrected, it would acquire\r\na force to which the timidity of political leaders would submit.\r\nHe had already induced a convention of the Democratic party in New\r\nYork to take ground against it. He wished to draw forth a similar\r\ndeclaration from the Democracy of the nation, at its next convention\r\nfor the nomination of a President. He succeeded; and to his influence,\r\nprobably, more than to that of any other man, we owe the downfall of\r\nthe paper-money delusion.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to analyze the rare combination of talents and faculties\r\nwhich enabled him to accomplish so much in a period so brief may not\r\nbe uninteresting. His original intellectual endowments were of the\r\nhighest order. They were not of that character which, while leaving\r\ntheir possessor satisfied with some hasty and superficial conclusions\r\nthat at the moment seem true, enable him to impress them upon others\r\nby fervid and moving language. These are the intellectual traits most\r\nfrequently exhibited by the ablest men whom our public life brings into\r\nnotice; but they do not make up the _scientific_ mind which Governor\r\nTilden's pre-eminently was. At the beginning of his intellectual\r\nmanhood he clearly perceived that the whole moral world was as rigidly\r\nas the physical world subject to an order, an arrangement, a law; and\r\nthat all policies, whether in government, in finance, or in business,\r\nnot founded upon a recognition of this truth would result in confusion\r\nand mischief. Naturally attracted to the study of the public economy\r\nof States, his first aim was to discover the laws governing every part\r\nof that extensive domain. Whether the theme was expenditure, taxation,\r\nprivate or public justice, internal improvements, or any form of\r\npublic administration, he would make no utterance until his brooding\r\nmind had reached what he conceived to be the underlying truth; and the\r\nsame trait was manifest in him where the purpose was not to refute or\r\nestablish a general policy, but to ascertain, in a particular case, the\r\ntruth upon a disputed question of fact.\r\n\r\nThis was well illustrated in his defence, in 1856, of the title of\r\nAzariah C. Flagg to the office of comptroller of the city of New York,\r\nagainst the claim of John S. Giles. Flagg had been declared elected by\r\nthe Board of County Canvassers. He was a man of resolute integrity, had\r\nheld the office before this election, and, by his obstinate defence\r\nof the city treasury against unjust and fraudulent claims, had drawn\r\nupon himself the hatred of the municipal plunderers, and earned from\r\nthem the title of \"Old Skinflint.\" His enemies had made a combined and\r\ndesperate effort to defeat his re-election, and, having failed by a few\r\nvotes only, they determined, upon the pretence of an erroneous return,\r\nto make an attempt to oust him from his office by a judicial proceeding\r\nand install Giles in his place. For this purpose they fixed upon the\r\nvote of the first district of the Nineteenth Ward, the majority of\r\nthe election officers of which were bitter enemies of Flagg. Their\r\npretence was that the return of the district election officers giving\r\n316 votes for Flagg and 186 for Giles was a clerical error, by which\r\nGiles' vote was awarded to Flagg and Flagg's vote to Giles. Three of\r\nthe election officers who signed and filed this return were sworn\r\nas witnesses for Giles, and positively testified that the vote as\r\nactually counted was just the reverse of the return; that Giles had 316\r\nvotes, and Flagg 186. The original tally-list of the regular tickets,\r\nwhich would have shown the truth, had been conveniently lost, but these\r\nwitnesses produced what they swore was the original tally-list of the\r\nsplit tickets, and upon which was a pretended transfer of the votes on\r\nregular tickets, which they swore was correct, and this fully supported\r\ntheir statements. Other witnesses on the same side testified that they\r\nwere present at the close of the counting on the day of the election,\r\nand heard the result proclaimed, and that it gave 316 to Giles and\r\nonly 186 to Flagg. This formidable case could be overthrown only by\r\nshowing that these witnesses were perjurers, and this pretended split\r\ntally-list a forgery. Tilden had no doubt that this was the fact, but\r\nhe had no direct evidence to prove it. He was a determined enemy of\r\nthese base conspirators and a close friend and ardent admirer of Flagg,\r\nand he was resolved that the fraudulent scheme should not succeed.\r\nActing upon the assumption that a lie has no place in the regular order\r\nof nature, but is something violently thrust into that order and will\r\nnot fit the surrounding and attendant facts, he laboriously endeavored\r\nto bring into light, so far as possible, all those surrounding and\r\nattending facts. It so happened that this election was a contest\r\nbetween numerous factions, and that there were seven regular tickets\r\nvoted; that is, tickets having uniformly the same names and for the\r\nsame offices; and there were twelve candidates for the various city\r\noffices on each ticket. There were also many split tickets, created\r\nby erasure of one or more names from a regular ticket, or otherwise.\r\nHere was fruitful material for the exercise of Tilden's powers of\r\ninvestigation. He demonstrated, and with mathematical certainty, by\r\nan analysis and comparison of the actual returns of votes for all the\r\ncandidates on these tickets, that the pretence of Giles was a pure\r\nfabrication. At the close of his argument he threw his demonstration\r\ninto a dramatic form, which created such an impression that, as Mr.\r\nCharles O'Connor, who was associated with Mr. Tilden, once told me,\r\nthe case of the plaintiff Giles was utterly defeated before the\r\ndefendant had called a witness. It was, of course, difficult for the\r\njurors to carry in their minds the numerous figures which made up the\r\ndemonstration. Something was needed to impress upon them the result.\r\nFor this Tilden pitched upon the lost original tally-sheet of the\r\nregular vote. It was upon the amount of Flagg's _regular_ vote that\r\nthe whole controversy turned. If the contents of that lost tally could\r\nbe shown, all doubt would be dispelled. Said he, \"I propose now,\r\ngentlemen, to submit this case to a process as certain as a geometrical\r\ndemonstration. _I propose to evoke from the grave that lost tally_;\r\nto reproduce it here, to confront and confound these witnesses who\r\nhave been upon the stand swearing to what is not true. It is an honest\r\nghost. It will disturb no true man.\" And he did it triumphantly.\r\nHanding to the jurors sheets containing copies of the regular tickets,\r\nand selecting a name which was found on only one of these tickets,\r\nthat of Samuel Allen for street commissioner, he called off from the\r\nactual return to the Board of County Canvassers, and the jurors set\r\ndown Allen's vote, which was 215. It necessarily followed that every\r\nother name on that ticket must have received the same number, or the\r\nticket would not be regular. Proceeding in the same way with all the\r\nnames on all the tickets, and then deducting the regular vote from\r\nthe whole vote as shown by the actual return, and thus obtaining the\r\nsplit votes for each candidate, and comparing these results, except\r\nas to Flagg and Giles, with the tally-sheet of the splits which had\r\nbeen produced by the witnesses for Giles, and which was presumably\r\ncorrect, except in respect to the vote for Flagg and Giles, he slowly,\r\nstep by step, re-created an original tally of the regular ticket,\r\nwhich, when increased by the split votes shown on the split tally-list,\r\ncorresponded in every particular with the actual return to the county\r\ncanvassers except as to three unimportant names, and as to these it was\r\nmanifest that the actual return was erroneous. Each juror found, at\r\nthe close of the calling, that he held in his hands what he could not\r\nbut believe was an absolutely accurate count of the votes in the first\r\ndistrict of the Nineteenth Ward for all the candidates voted upon, for\r\nwhatever office, at the election under investigation. The hideous\r\nmonstrosity of the figures assigned to Flagg and Giles in the split\r\ntally-list became so palpable that none could doubt. It is needless\r\nto add that when the case was finally submitted to the jury they\r\nimmediately returned with a verdict for \"Old Skinflint.\"\r\n\r\nHe employed a similar method in the case of what was called the Six\r\nMillion Audit fraud of Tweed and his accomplices. That the payment of\r\nthis enormous sum was a gigantic fraud no one could doubt; but there\r\nwas no proof showing _how much_ of the payments was in excess of what\r\nwas due to the claimants, or among whom the excess was divided, and how\r\nmuch to one and how much to another. Mr. Tilden unlocked this mystery.\r\nHe went to the banks in which the conspirators kept their accounts,\r\nand by a patient decomposition of the credits into the original\r\nitems, as shown by the deposit tickets, evolved the plunderers' rule\r\nof division. Applying this rule to any one of the hundreds of paid\r\ncity warrants embraced in this series of frauds, and without going\r\nbeyond the face of the warrant, it could be determined how much each\r\nof the conspirators received; and the determination would be verified\r\nby finding, upon examining the bank accounts and deposit tickets of\r\nthe same parties, that they had received on the day of the payment of\r\nthe warrants the same sums which, according to the rule applied, they\r\nought to have received. It vexed Mr. Tilden very much that the shares\r\nof the conspirators, as thus computed, did not correspond with perfect\r\nexactitude to the amounts deposited to their credit. The difference,\r\nbeing trifling in amount, hardly affected the conclusiveness of the\r\ndemonstration; but it showed that there was some element in the rule of\r\ndivision which he had not discovered. The missing link was subsequently\r\nfound, and then the conformity between the computed and the actual\r\nshares was in every instance exact to a penny. This division and\r\nconformity, appearing upon the face of the accounts themselves, proved\r\nwith absolute certainty the conspiracy to defraud, the amounts of the\r\nembezzlements, and the precise shares received by each. Had Mr. Tilden\r\nbeen present at the meetings of the conspirators and witnessed their\r\ndivision of the spoils, he could not have given evidence so conclusive\r\nof the fraud as that which he thus drew from written memoranda which\r\nthe conspirators had thoughtlessly allowed to be made.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed wonderful to observe how a man who could study these dry\r\ndetails with such patience, and even with pleasure, could pass at once\r\ninto the fields of political science and compel a wholly different\r\nclass of facts to yield to him the loftiest generalizations. But in\r\ntruth the process was the same in both instances. It was the original\r\ninvestigation of facts for the purpose of framing a just theory. It is\r\na common practice, even with able men, to disparage the conclusions\r\nfounded upon the employment of the reasoning powers as being _mere\r\ntheory_; as if their own conclusions, so far as they have any value,\r\nwere reached in any other way. These are the criticisms of men who are\r\ntoo indolent to engage in the work of patient investigation, or not\r\nsufficiently instructed in the methods by which it should be pursued.\r\nUndoubtedly there are many minds that undertake the task of evolving\r\nthe laws underlying some subject matter and reach conclusions which\r\nare confidently believed and asserted to be true, but that turn out\r\nwhen adopted in practice to be erroneous. It is in this way that the\r\nresults of investigation and reasoning are brought into discredit. But\r\nthe fault in such cases is not that the conclusions are those of mere\r\ntheory, but of erroneous theory. The reasoner lacks the patience, or\r\nthe skill, to embrace in his investigation all the material facts, and\r\nto exclude all others. These are, indeed, the rarest of qualities.\r\nThey are possessed in an eminent degree by a few men only in each\r\ngeneration, and the value of such men to society is inestimable.\r\nGovernor Tilden's pre-eminence was especially manifest here. His\r\neducated intelligence was able to pronounce, as if by instinct, whether\r\nthe conclusion he had reached was sufficiently certain to be made the\r\nbasis of action, or was so encumbered with doubt as to call for further\r\nscrutiny into the facts. He knew how--to use his own happy phrase--\"to\r\nlimit theory by practice and enlighten practice by theory.\"\r\n\r\nThe mere pursuit of truth, the pleasure which comes from the actual\r\nexercise of superior powers, the sense of satisfaction which arises\r\nfrom the overcoming of difficulties, would have been a sufficient\r\nreward and stimulus to a mind like his; but this was not his principal\r\nmotive. His chief aim was to convince others; and he knew that this\r\ncould be done only by the effective use of language. He recognized the\r\nimportance of the art of rhetoric, and labored upon the composition of\r\nhis papers with the same care which the purely literary man employs;\r\nnot for the purpose of making up a piece of what is called fine\r\nwriting, but to engage and hold the attention by imparting life and\r\ninterest to his treatment, and, by an easy and natural development\r\nof his subject, to carry the mind gratefully along towards his\r\nconclusions. It would be hard to find better examples of the way in\r\nwhich subjects apt to be regarded as dull may be made lively and\r\ninteresting, and yet without departing in the slightest degree from\r\na rigid and logical development, than are found in his report, while\r\na member of the legislature of New York, upon the causes of the\r\nanti-rent disorders and the proper remedy for them; or his speech in\r\nthe constitutional convention of that State in 1867, unfolding the\r\ntrue policy to be pursued in relation to the canals; or his second\r\nannual message when Governor in 1876. I find, on the page at which I\r\nopen a volume of his speeches and writings, the following sentence,\r\nwhich well illustrates the ease and power with which he could clothe\r\nweighty truths in their appropriate language: \"Generations, like\r\nindividuals, do not completely understand inherited wisdom until they\r\nhave reproduced it in their own experience.\"\r\n\r\nThese high intellectual traits would have made him a man of mark had\r\nhe been a philosophical recluse holding himself aloof from the busy\r\nactivities of life; but the extraordinary thing was that he was at all\r\ntimes emphatically a man of action. Whether engaged in the conduct\r\nof some great lawsuit or of some important business enterprise, or\r\nmanaging a political campaign, he was equally at home. The schemes of\r\nsmall party chieftains and the power of local bosses gave way before\r\nhis masterful leadership. He did not despise the aid of partisan\r\nmachinery or of official patronage; but he fully perceived that the\r\nscope and influence of these instrumentalities were narrow, and that,\r\nunless held rigidly secondary and subordinate, they would obstruct,\r\nrather than aid, the march of a political party. Profoundly convinced\r\nof the truth of the political creed which he avowed, he engaged in\r\npolitical warfare only to secure its permanent establishment. Any\r\nvictory won by shifty expedients he knew would be but temporary,\r\nand would not fail to retard a lasting success. At the same time he\r\nrecognized the fact that no main purpose of a political party could\r\never be carried except by the permanent union of men differing from\r\neach other upon a multitude of minor points, and exhibiting every\r\ngrade of culture, character, and conduct. Compromise and concession be\r\nrecognized as the daily duties of the statesman. He had little regard\r\nfor those impracticable natures which refuse to join any party because\r\nthey find something to object to in all parties. He was the last man\r\nto yield to self-conceit and obstinacy the titles of conscience and\r\nwisdom. Such men, he once declared, forget \"that without concession\r\nthere can be no common action for a common object, and that without the\r\ncapability of such action a man is fit, not for society, not even for\r\na state of nature, but only for absolute solitude.\" I wonder that the\r\nmugwump-haters have not borrowed his description of some non-partisans\r\nof his day: \"I know there is a class of no-party men who vindicate\r\ntheir claim to that character by doing injustice to all, even without\r\nthe excuse of bias.\"\r\n\r\nBut _how far_ should you carry the spirit of compromise and\r\nconcession--_how far_ tolerate what you believe to be error in order\r\nto obtain an over-balancing good? This is the puzzle of statesmen, and\r\nindeed of every man, so far as he undertakes any part, even though\r\nonly as a private citizen, in public concerns. There are two ways of\r\ndealing with it. One is to shirk it by an indolent abandonment of the\r\nimportant offices of social and public life. The other is to meet it\r\nwith the best solution we can find. Tilden had little regard for the\r\nfirst of these methods. He accepted the second; and with his matchless\r\nability for drawing a line up to which we must, but beyond which we\r\nmust not go, he would have had little excuse for the other choice.\r\nThere were several occasions when he felt obliged to draw this line\r\nand rigidly observe it, although the result might be immediately\r\ndisastrous to the party to which he was attached and to his own\r\npersonal ambitions. His opposition, in 1871, to Tammany Hall, already\r\nnoticed, is an instance. Occupying, as he then did, the important\r\npost of chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, he could\r\nnot step out of the local organization in the metropolis and make war\r\nupon its leaders without seeming disloyalty to his party, nor without\r\nendangering its success in the next State election. But he determined,\r\nagainst combined solicitations and threats, to take this course, and\r\nthe result showed the wisdom of his choice, even as a measure of party\r\npolicy. And again, when the irredeemable paper-money delusion had to a\r\nfar greater degree than the free silver coinage craze gained possession\r\nof the popular mind throughout the West and South, and in the view of\r\nmany ardent politicians promised a victory to the Democratic party\r\nif that party would extend some favor to it, he compelled from the\r\nnational convention of the party a repudiation of the heresy. No\r\ntemporary advantage which his party might gain would in his view be\r\nworth acceptance, if purchased at the price of such a sacrifice of\r\nfundamental principle.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that with his profound knowledge of the\r\ncauses by which human affairs were controlled, combined with such\r\ncapacities for skilful action, he should have accumulated a large\r\nfortune. Aside from what he received for professional services,\r\nhis large gains were, I imagine, rather easily acquired. Among the\r\nmischiefs of an unstable currency is the facility with which men who\r\nhave the power of dealing skilfully with exceptional conditions may\r\namass large fortunes. Few men understood such things better than Mr.\r\nTilden. He had striven to prevent, as well as a man in opposition\r\ncould, the issue, during the war, of an irredeemable government\r\ncurrency; but I remember his saying to me after the policy was adopted,\r\nin substance: \"Now is the time to make yourself rich. Buy all that\r\nyou can pay for, or run in debt for. Every day it will be easier and\r\neasier for you to pay, and your property will correspondingly rise in\r\nvalue, or rather in price.\" And at the close of the war he advised\r\nthe opposite course. I do not know, but I have little doubt that he\r\nacted extensively on this policy. If there were a question as to the\r\npropriety of such action, he certainly was excusable. Had his counsels\r\nbeen regarded, no such measure would have been adopted.\r\n\r\nThe malice of political opponents was wont to ascribe his success in\r\nmoney-getting to schemes for obtaining interests in the property of\r\ninsolvent railway companies at less than their value. They stigmatized\r\nhim as a \"railroad-wrecker.\" Never was there less foundation for a\r\ncharge. He was a railroad-preserver. His skill in the management of\r\ndifficult and complicated affairs, combined with his profound knowledge\r\nof the fundamental principles of equity, made his services invaluable\r\nto parties interested in the property and securities of railroad\r\ncompanies which by bad management, or in consequence of over-sanguine\r\nexpectations, had fallen into difficulties. His capacious mind was just\r\nfitted for the survey of such situations. He was among the first, if\r\nnot the first, to perceive that a ruthless attempt to foreclose a first\r\nmortgage and thus to crush out all subordinate liens and interests\r\nwas ill-suited to such cases; that the just and true method was to\r\nascertain the real capacities of the business, and to reorganize the\r\nenterprise upon a scheme which would indulge the hope of saving to the\r\njunior securities a large part of their supposed original value. More\r\nthan one of the great railroads of the country have, at his skilful\r\ntouch, risen from absolute bankruptcy into prosperity, and repaid all\r\nor the larger part of the original investment.\r\n\r\nWith all his capacity for making sober estimates, and escaping\r\nthe illusions by which many minds are carried away, he was yet an\r\nenthusiast, especially in respect to the plans and enterprises which\r\nwere the offspring of his own fruitful brain. This came partly from\r\npersonal vanity, of which he had a plentiful supply, and partly from\r\nthe exhilaration which attends the exercise of high intellectual powers\r\nand rewards the conquest of difficulties. I remember a display of this\r\ntendency which greatly impressed me.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a professional service for him while he was\r\nGovernor, in connection with a lawsuit to which he was a party, it\r\nbecame necessary that I should tarry several days at his house in\r\nAlbany in order to secure his attention during the intervals between\r\nhis official duties. It was while the St. Louis Convention was in\r\nsession at which he was nominated for the Presidency. One would suppose\r\nthat under such circumstances he could have given his mind to little\r\nelse than the business in which his personal fortunes were so deeply\r\nconcerned. But he could not have devoted himself more ardently to\r\nrecalling and arranging the facts of the complicated transactions out\r\nof which this lawsuit grew than he did on the very day when he was\r\nnominated. Late in the afternoon of that day, after protracted work, he\r\ntook me upon a long drive with him. In the course of it he did not even\r\nallude to the convention, or its doings, although a flight of telegrams\r\nhad been coming to him. His conversation, animated and incessant,\r\nwas upon false policies in government, the mischiefs and burdens of\r\nover-expenditure, the true principles of taxation, the errors of\r\nprotective tariffs, etc. One could see that the mere matter of holding\r\nthe Presidential office was little to him; but that the chance of\r\nlaying his reforming hand upon the multitude of abuses with which, as\r\nhe supposed, the whole administration of the general government was\r\ninfested aroused his enthusiasm, as the prospect of a season of sport\r\nwould that of a boy. Becoming animated with his theme, eloquent and\r\nintense in his language, he failed in attention to the high-spirited\r\nhorse he was driving, and I was in constant fear of a catastrophe.\r\nIndeed, on a similar drive the succeeding day we met with one from the\r\nsame cause. The injury was inflicted instead of received, and cost\r\nthe Governor several thousand dollars by way of damages. When, on our\r\nreturn, on the day first mentioned, we were near home, I observed to\r\nhim that he would perhaps find at the house a telegram announcing his\r\nnomination. \"No,\" said he, unconcernedly, \"not until about half-past\r\nnine.\" It came not many moments from that time. Impressed upon this\r\noccasion with his profound and extensive knowledge of everything\r\nrelating to the science of government, and thinking his views not\r\nsubstantially at variance with those held by leading Republicans--for\r\nat that time the Republican party had not become committed to its\r\npresent dogmas on the subject of protective tariffs--I ventured to\r\nexpress to him the surprise I felt that he had not allied himself with\r\nthat party; saying that it seemed to me that, considering the greatly\r\nsuperior number of men of education and public spirit to be found in\r\nits ranks, he could much more easily procure a general acceptance of\r\nhis opinions by acting in alliance with them. He answered that he\r\nthought that I was mistaken; that, while it was true that a large\r\nmajority of the men of culture, wealth, and force were to be found in\r\nthe Republican party, the trouble was that, to use his language, \"it\r\nwas a party of self-seekers.\" He explained that he did not mean this in\r\nany offensive sense; that what he meant was that the controlling men\r\nof that party were men of large pecuniary interests, seeking to build\r\nup fortunes and families; that these personal interests were so large\r\nas necessarily to engross their thoughts and control their opinions,\r\nleading them to use their powerful influence so as to shape the\r\nlegislation of the country in a form which would favor those interests;\r\nthat it was difficult to lead such men along the pathway of those\r\nfundamental principles of democratic government by which alone equal\r\njustice could be done to the masses of men; that the Democratic party\r\nheld within its ranks a far less number of men of this description--not\r\nenough to control its action--and consequently the opinions of its\r\ngreat masses could be more easily shaped and molded by the mere force\r\nof ideas; that this was the distinction between the former Democratic\r\nand Whig parties, and that the Republican party would, as the patriotic\r\ninspirations caught from the opposition to slavery and the defence of\r\nthe Union died away, become the mere successor to the spirit and policy\r\nof the Whig party.\r\n\r\n\"These observations, as applied to the two present parties of the\r\ncountry, would not, probably, be accepted without dissent; but they\r\nintimate a most important truth. This is that when a man comes to be\r\nthe possessor of large property interests, these will, whatever may\r\nbe his character, control his opinions in relation to any question\r\naffecting them. The great railroad interests of the country are\r\nconducted by men, I suppose, of as honorable character as can be found\r\nin any walk of life; but they will not, in the face of threatened\r\ndisaster, keep the agreements they make with each other. They do not\r\nhesitate, when these interests are threatened by adverse legislation,\r\nto defend them by secret arts and practices--kept secret because they\r\ncould not be avowed without a blush. Mr. Jay Gould, in some testimony\r\ndrawn from him by a legislative committee, expressed the truth by\r\nsaying that he was \"sometimes a Democrat and sometimes a Republican,\r\nbut always an Erie man.\" It must be admitted that the occasions are\r\noften fearfully trying. They sometimes impose a test which human nature\r\nis ill-fitted to bear. The individual who is subjected to them is\r\ncalled upon to defend, not only his own property, but that of others. A\r\nman may surrender his own interests, but what account is he to give of\r\nhimself when he surrenders interests which have been intrusted to him\r\nfor defence?\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that Governor Tilden possessed, on the whole,\r\ngreater capabilities for usefulness in public life than any other\r\nman of his generation. I cannot find elsewhere such a union of the\r\nability to discover true governmental policies with the firm and\r\nundeviating purpose to pursue them. This is not the universal estimate\r\nof him. A certain measure of distrust seems to have accompanied the\r\ngeneral admiration of his talents. For this there never was any\r\njust foundation. I do not think any public man of his time was more\r\nfaithful to his conceptions of truth. No impartial man could now well\r\ndoubt this after going over the record of his services and reading\r\nhis speeches and public papers. Indeed, it is hardly possible that\r\nso ardent a searcher after scientific truth could be otherwise than\r\nfaithful to it. We can scarcely imagine Socrates and Newton to have\r\nbeen dishonest men. That Lord Bacon fell excites our wonder. And yet\r\nthere must always be some ground for any widely extended impression.\r\nI think that in this instance the cause is manifest. His pre-eminence\r\nwas in the intellectual rather than in the emotional powers. In order\r\nto achieve his purposes he preferred to appeal to the intellect rather\r\nthan to the heart. Plain, blunt honesty is universally perceived and\r\nunderstood, and is admired and confided in, even when it blunders.\r\nBut common men have so often been deceived by the sharp practices of\r\nthose who are a little brighter than themselves, that they are apt to\r\ndistrust intellectual superiority, and half suspect it to be a species\r\nof cunning. The malice of personal and party hostility, working upon\r\nthis natural tendency, has found an easy acceptance of its calumnies.\r\n\r\nBut, beside this, Governor Tilden was a practical leader in affairs,\r\nboth of business and politics; and although he was all openness and\r\ncandor in his public discussions, yet in his methods of action he could\r\nnot, any more than other men, dispense with secrecy and reserve; and as\r\nhe was apt to excel others in whatever methods he adopted, he perhaps\r\nexcelled them in secretiveness as well. A good share of another quality\r\nwhich does not tend to secure admiration for the possessor fell to Mr.\r\nTilden. It was not unnatural that a man so conscious of superior powers\r\nshould be somewhat vain. Men do not like to have \"I told you so\" flung\r\ninto their ears at every turn in the course of events, and Mr. Tilden\r\nhad a habit of doing this.\r\n\r\nBut he was by no means wanting in the sense of moral earnestness, and\r\nhe had a just perception of the occasions demanding the exercise of\r\nthat faculty. He was well aware that fraud and corruption could not\r\nbe successfully combated with the weapons of reason, and that they\r\ndid not deserve to be reasoned with. When he found himself confronted\r\nby the powerful Canal Ring, which had fattened for a generation upon\r\nfraudulent contracts for repairs and pretended improvements to the\r\ncanals, a ring which had founded wealthy and influential families, and\r\nhad its stipendiaries among the able lawyers of the State, he perceived\r\nthat it was a warfare in which no quarter could be given, and which\r\ncould not be carried on by the weapons of facts and figures alone.\r\nHe courageously determined to invade, single-handed, the strongholds\r\nof his enemies, and to arouse against them the moral indignation of\r\nthe people. Using a vacation from pressing official duties, he made a\r\nseries of speeches in a tour along the line of the canals from Buffalo\r\nto Albany. Flinging aside his customary temperance and moderation,\r\nhe denounced his adversaries--men of wealth and the highest social\r\nstanding--as criminals, and summoned the people to stand by his side\r\nin an effort to enforce against them the criminal law. Speaking at\r\nSyracuse, in the midst of the men he was condemning, he said: \"Here,\r\nunder your own eyes and your own observation, these transactions have\r\nbeen carried on in open day, by a combination that has sought to rule\r\nthe State.... I was called upon this morning to speak some words of\r\nencouragement and hope to four hundred little boys in the Western House\r\nof Refuge. During all my journey I have been frequently followed by\r\npersons asking for their friends and those in whom they were interested\r\na pardon from the penitentiaries and State-prisons. I have been\r\ncompelled to look into such cases to see who are the inmates of these\r\ninstitutions, and of what they have been accused, and to ascertain what\r\nit is that constitutes the wrong to society of which they have been\r\nconvicted. When I compare their offences, in their nature, temptations,\r\nand circumstances, with the crimes of great public delinquents who\r\nclaim to stand among your best society, and are confessedly prominent\r\namong their fellow-citizens--crimes repeated and continued year after\r\nyear--I am appalled at the inequality of human justice.\" He made by\r\nthis series of addresses a profound impression upon the public mind.\r\n\r\nHe was cautious not to be imposed upon by those who wished his\r\nofficial aid or influence, and commonly subjected them to a searching\r\ncross-examination, but a case of real distress quickly moved him.\r\nI remember an instance which occurred during my sojourn, already\r\nmentioned, at the Governor's mansion in Albany. We were at work\r\ntogether rather late one evening, when he was told that a little girl\r\nwished to see him. She was wretchedly clad, and seemed to be in\r\ngreat misery. Moments were then quite precious to him, but he dropped\r\neverything and spent half an hour with her. When he returned to the\r\nlibrary where we were at work he told me her tale. It was that she was\r\nthe oldest of several children; that her father was a drunkard and\r\ncruel to her mother, who also sometimes got intoxicated--though, as\r\nthe girl said, only when her father abused her--and who had, the day\r\nbefore, although having a nursing infant only a few weeks old, been\r\nsent to prison for ten days for drunkenness; that the little girl had\r\nbeen vainly endeavoring to take care of the infant and the rest of\r\nthe family, but had given up in despair. The Governor seemed a good\r\ndeal moved at this separation of mother and infant, and spoke with\r\nindignation of the manner in which the criminal law was administered in\r\nthe lower courts by incompetent magistrates. He immediately despatched\r\na secretary to the executive chamber for a sealed pardon in blank,\r\nfilled it up and signed it, and sent the same secretary with the girl\r\nto the prison, with instructions to see that the woman was released\r\nand taken to her home that very night. I asked him whether this was\r\nnot rather hasty and inconsiderate action, adding that possibly the\r\nmagistrate, if consulted, might give a different statement of the case.\r\nHe answered: \"No, and I wouldn't believe him if he did. Don't I know\r\nthat the little girl told me the truth?\"\r\n\r\nIn assigning to Governor Tilden capacities for public usefulness\r\nsuperior to those of other men of his generation, one qualification\r\nshould perhaps be made. He could not have led, or rather guided,\r\nas Lincoln did, the storm of patriotic passion which the Southern\r\ninsurrection aroused. There are resistless currents in human affairs\r\nwhich disdain the feeble control of mere reason, and insist upon\r\nworking their way by force alone. War is a conflict of the passions,\r\nand, when it becomes necessary or preferable to peace, those passions\r\nshould be inflamed rather than checked.\r\n\r\nBut the superior _wisdom_ of Governor Tilden was equally manifest in\r\nthis great crisis, although, perhaps, incapable of dealing with it.\r\nNaturally anti-slavery, he had encouraged the first tendencies towards\r\nthe assertion of the Free-soil sentiment of the North by joining in\r\nthe revolt of the Northern Democrats against the nominees of the\r\nDemocratic convention in 1848, and supporting the candidates nominated\r\nat the Barnburners' convention at Utica. But when he saw this movement\r\ndeveloping into the formation of a permanent political organization\r\nunder the name of the Republican party, with the avowed object of\r\npreventing by _national legislation_ any further extension of slavery,\r\nhe paused and receded.\r\n\r\nThe argument of the supporters of the new movement was that Congress\r\nhad the power, not, indeed, to interfere with slavery in the States,\r\nbut to prevent its establishment in the Territories; and that they were\r\nbut exercising their constitutional rights in forming a party for the\r\npurpose of securing such legislation. Tilden could not deny the mere\r\nclaim of constitutional right; but this, with him, was but a small\r\npart of the question. What would be the consequence of a successful\r\nassertion of that right? Could it be reasonably supposed that the\r\nSouthern States would view it otherwise than as an attack upon what\r\nthey deemed to be a vital interest? Would not its necessary effect be\r\nto force unanimity among them in opposition to the policy? Was the\r\nsupposition that there was any considerable Free-soil sentiment in the\r\nSouth which would array itself on the side of the government anything\r\nbut a dream? Should we not have two strictly sectional parties arrayed\r\nupon the question of preserving or destroying an institution which one\r\nof them, not unnaturally, regarded as essential to self-existence?\r\nThese, in his view, were questions which must be first solved before\r\nsuch a movement could be encouraged. His solution led him to the\r\nconclusion that war would be the necessary result of such action; and\r\nthis involved the further inquiry whether the object in view would be\r\ngained by a civil war, or, if gained, would be worth the terrible cost.\r\nAppalled by the uncertainties and terrors of such a conflict, he took\r\nrefuge, as Mr. Webster had before him, in the belief that the natural\r\nforces in operation would of themselves accomplish all that could be\r\ngained by the policy of restriction. In a letter to William Kent in\r\n1860, before the election of Lincoln, he stated his conclusions and the\r\nreasoning which led to them with his characteristic moderation, but\r\nwith masterly force. His main conclusion was that if the Republican\r\nparty should be successful, the national government in the Southern\r\nStates would cease to be self-government, and become a government\r\nby one people over another distinct people--a thing impossible with\r\nour race, except as a consequence of successful war, and even then\r\nincompatible with our democratic institutions. He said:\r\n\r\n\"I assert that a controversy between powerful communities, organized\r\ninto governments, of a nature like that which now divides the North\r\nand South, can be settled only by convention or by war. I affirm this\r\nupon the universal principles of human nature, and the collective\r\nexperience of all mankind.\" And again: \"A condition of parties in which\r\nthe federative government shall be carried on by a party having no\r\naffiliations in the Southern States is impossible to continue. Such\r\na government would be out of all relation to those States. It would\r\nhave neither the nerves of sensation which convey intelligence to the\r\nintellect of the body politic, nor the ligaments and muscles which hold\r\nits parts together and move them in harmony. It would be in substance\r\nthe government of one people by another people. That system will not do\r\nwith our race.\"\r\n\r\nThis reasoning was founded upon the facts of human nature, the\r\nphilosophy of government, and the teachings of experience. Its truth is\r\nmore manifest now than when it was uttered. Who of the great Free-soil\r\nleaders would have had the hardihood to persist in their course if they\r\ncould have foreseen the consequences so clearly? Greeley, terrified\r\nby the horrible spectacle of war, was driven to say: \"Let the wayward\r\nsisters depart in peace.\" Seward's short vision predicted that it would\r\nbe all over \"in sixty days\"! But in great crises the foresight of the\r\nwisest is but blindness. Were it always given men to see what they are\r\nto go through with, the greatest steps in moral advancement would never\r\nbe taken. Tilden did not foresee, through the storms of war, any more\r\nthan others, the freedom of the slave with the acquiescence of the\r\nmaster, and the consequent unification of the republic.\r\n\r\nBut the trials of our popular system of government were not terminated\r\nby the simultaneous overthrow of the Rebellion and slavery. It may be,\r\nrather, that they have just begun. We were confident before the war\r\nthat slavery was the source of the only peril which really threatened\r\nus. That out of the way, we find ourselves confronted with new dangers,\r\ngrowing out of differences of opinion respecting the extent to which\r\nthe black race shall be allowed to participate in government. That\r\nparticipation is now practically denied by the Southern States, and\r\nthe mandate of the Constitution is unhesitatingly set at naught by\r\nthe employment either of force or fraud. The remedy suggested is an\r\nenforcement of that mandate by Federal legislation, which means simply\r\nthe enforcement of its will by one section against that of the other.\r\nThis is not democratic government, but the rule of the conquered by\r\nthe conqueror. The evil is bad enough; and the remedy will probably\r\nbe worse. We begin to see that the real danger which has at all times\r\nmenaced us is the presence on our soil of a different race, unequal,\r\nfor the present, at least, to the great office of self-government.\r\nSlavery was not itself the evil, but only one of the methods of dealing\r\nwith it. Is our substitute, the bestowal upon the race of universal\r\nsuffrage, a successful device? And, if this must be abandoned, what\r\nshall next be tried? These grave problems, already threatening, will\r\nassume a graver aspect if the results of the census just taken, when\r\nstudied and compared, shall be found to show a more rapid rate of\r\nincrease in the black population at the South than in the white. To\r\nmeet such perils we need nothing so much as a class of statesmen of\r\nwhich Samuel J. Tilden was the most distinguished example.\r\n\r\n          LETTERS AND LITERARY MEMORIALS OF SAMUEL J. TILDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1810-1844\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1801 President Jefferson appointed Robert R. Livingston, then\r\nChancellor of the State of New York, as Minister to France. On his\r\nreturn, in 1804, Livingston brought with him some sheep from Spain,\r\nthen the home of the famous Merino breed, developed from races of sheep\r\noriginally introduced into the peninsula by the Romans. In 1809-10 a\r\nflock of 4000 Merino sheep were brought into the United States to meet\r\nthe demand created by Mr. Livingston's first importation. The following\r\nletter from the father of Samuel J. Tilden, written the very season of\r\nthe larger importation, justifies the presumption that such importation\r\nhad been made by Mr. Livingston himself or at his behest. The letter\r\nof Elam Tilden was sent to his son Samuel by the late Eliphalet Nott\r\nPotter in December, 1882, with a note in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"In looking over a package of Livingston letters I find the enclosed,\r\nand thinking that possibly it may be of some slight interest to you, I\r\nbeg that you will accept it with best wishes of the season and for the\r\nNew Year.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written four years before the writer's son Samuel J.\r\nwas born.\r\n\r\n\r\nELAM TILDEN TO HON. ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON\r\n\r\n  \"NEW LEBANON, _March 19, 1810_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--I want to get four or five pounds of your best _full-blood_\r\nMerino Wool to manufacture into cloth for a Coat. I applied to you\r\nonce before for the article for the same purpose, but you informed me\r\nthat your wool was all previously engaged. I hope, Sir, that you will\r\naccommodate me; I can by some means get it forwarded to Hudson, from\r\nwhence I can get it. I will thank you to drop me an answer by the mail,\r\nby which conveyance I will forward you the money, or get it to you by\r\nway of my friend, Dr. Younglove, of Hudson, if you accommodate me with\r\nthe wool.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, Sir, Your\r\n             \"humble Servant,\r\n                       \"ELAM TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\nThe most disastrous fire with which the city of New York has ever yet\r\nbeen visited is referred to in the following letter. It reduced to\r\nashes pretty much every structure within the area bounded by Wall and\r\nBroad streets and the East River, a tract which then embraced nearly,\r\nif not quite all the important commission houses in the city; crippled\r\nall our insurance companies, and gave to the territory it covered a\r\nblow from which, after a lapse of nearly three-quarters of a century,\r\nit has but partially recovered. Like the great fire of London in the\r\nseventeenth century, it is still referred to as the _Great Fire_ of\r\n1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. J. TILDEN TO ELAM TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _December 11, 1833_. Friday, _2.30 P.M._\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FATHER,--The last has been the most calamitous night New York\r\never saw. The very centre of the commercial part of the city--from\r\nWall Street across William and nearly to Broad, and to Coenties\r\nSlip,--all is a mass of smouldering ruins. A concurrence of unfortunate\r\ncircumstances rendered the fire thus disastrous. The engines had been\r\nmuch disordered, in consequence of the extensive fires on the previous\r\nnight--the hose, many of them, frozen and unfit for use. The atmosphere\r\nwas in a state peculiarly calculated to support and extend combustion,\r\nthe wind blew with great violence, and the weather was so intensely\r\ncold as to clog and almost close up with ice the hose. The flames raged\r\nthrough the whole night with uncontrolled violence, impressing every\r\nbeholder with the utter impotency of human effort to contend with the\r\ndevouring element. The spectacle was grand and awful beyond conception.\r\nI shall not attempt to describe it. All the fires that ever occurred\r\nhere before were perfectly insignificant in comparison.\r\n\r\n\"The question is now, not who is injured, but who has escaped? Almost\r\nall I know are involved in the common catastrophe. At No. 12, Mr.\r\nHichcock burnt out; Mr. Birch, not even his books and papers saved. Mr.\r\nBrown burnt out, and his goods consumed in the street or in the stores\r\nto which they were removed. Mr. Starkweather not yet injured, but in\r\nimminent danger. Mr. Williams' employees, everything destroyed; and\r\nalso Mr. Conckling's, I believe. At 14, Mr. Stewart's employees. At\r\n20, Mr. Bronson among the lost; Mr. Soullard, same; Mr. Davis and ____\r\nescaped. Halsted and Baines, $40,000 lost; 20 to 30,000 saved. Hunt and\r\nAndrews, Conckling & ____, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\"So vast is the destruction that insurance affords but a very\r\ninsufficient security. The whole insurance capital of the city will\r\nscarce exceed one-half the amount of property consumed in one night!\r\nEstimates are very vague and uncertain--the loss, however, can hardly\r\nbe less than twenty millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\"There is not time to write a word more to-day.\r\n\r\n  \"Affectionately yours,\r\n                          \"S.

He is still regarded in his native\r\nState as one of the half-dozen wisest statesmen that ever occupied a\r\nseat in the Upper House of our national legislature. He was a warm\r\nsupporter of the administrations of Jackson and Van Buren, and the most\r\neminent victim of New York's successful opposition to the conversion of\r\nthe Territory of Texas into five more sovereign slave-holding States\r\nof the Union. He was also a close friend and constant correspondent of\r\nElam Tilden and of his two elder sons.\r\n\r\nThe letter which follows reached Mr. S. J. Tilden only a few weeks\r\nbefore he was deprived of the Presidency by the 7-to-6 vote of the\r\nElectoral Tribunal of 1876. It connotes Senator Wright's first\r\nappearance in the Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. Waddell,\r\nto whom Mr. Tilden was indebted for Wright's letter, had been United\r\nStates marshal during the administration of Mr. Van Buren.\r\n\r\n\r\nWM. COVENTRY H. WADDELL TO S. J.

All I can say to you\r\nis that I made just as good an argument in your favor as I hoped to\r\nbe able to make.

If the ring does not\r\nsuit send it and I can easily change it; if it does, send it that I may\r\nhave your name put in it--unless, indeed, you conclude to come with Pa,\r\nwhich I much wish you would, and, since you are not in school, I see\r\nnothing to prevent....\r\n\r\n\"I am uncomfortably situated in many respects. I perfectly abhor this\r\nmode of life. The social slavery of the family to any scapegrace, man\r\nor woman, the latter worse, who may choose to sojourn here is really\r\nintolerable. And the whole routine of such an upon-the-town life is\r\nopposed to every good habit and in favor of every bad habit. I did hope\r\nthat when one family left, the burden would be lightened; but it has\r\nproved to be only a change of riders. These and other petty annoyances\r\nvex me more than they used to; perhaps my temper is at fault; but I\r\nassure you they are numerous. And it is unpleasant to me, as you can\r\nwell understand, to see a disease so full of terror fastening itself\r\ngradually but surely upon J.; to see not one thing in the circumstances\r\nto which she is subjected that gives the least hope of counteraction;\r\nand to feel myself without power, in the slavish routine of the\r\nhouse, to remedy or prevent. I do not often speak of troubles when I\r\nhave them, and would do so now only to you; so you must preserve my\r\nconfidence.[1]\r\n\r\n\"As to myself, it is only the condition of things at home that\r\nprevents me, if I could make the necessary arrangements, from going\r\nabroad. It is the only thing to which I look with any confidence or\r\nmuch hope to act upon my own constitution; and would separate me from\r\ncircumstances not calculated to lessen the weight of an inevitable\r\nmisfortune to which I have been long subject.\r\n\r\n\"I think that if you are able to come now, your visit will be more\r\npleasant than last year.\r\n\r\n\"Write to me.\r\n\r\n  \"Aff. y'rs,\r\n                   \"S.

The statements and certificates\r\nof these facts should be verified by oath when it could be done; and\r\nthe whole ought to be published in a volume and put into the hands of\r\nevery honest elector in the United States. This mass of information\r\nwould be used by the Democratic papers as they might have occasion.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, as you say, that the battle is not yet really begun;\r\nthe true issues which divide the Democracy and the Federalists cannot\r\nbe presented before the country except the latter are in power.

To the\r\nCongress which convened in extra session May 31, 1841, President Tyler\r\nintimated his desire that the members of that body should request\r\na plan for a national bank from Mr. Ewing, then Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. In pursuance of the resolutions for this purpose adopted\r\nby both Houses, Mr. Ewing sent in a bill for the incorporation of\r\nthe \"Fiscal Bank of the United States,\" the essential features of\r\nwhich were framed in accordance with the President's suggestions. The\r\nbill passed Congress August 6, with a clause concerning branch banks\r\ndiffering from Mr. Ewing's, which was vetoed by the President. The\r\nletter from Mr. Tilden which follows was a criticism of this bill, and\r\nprobably had something to do with its untimely fate.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear from the copy to whom this letter was addressed by\r\nMr. Tilden, but it was probably to Senator Wright.\r\n\r\nCongress subsequently passed another bill intended to meet the\r\nobjections of President Tyler. He concluded he could not approve it\r\nwithout inconsistency, and therefore vetoed that bill also, by which\r\nact he alienated the United States Bank wing of the Whig party to such\r\nan extent as to make many friends among the party of the opposition. It\r\nis to that phase of that absorbing bank issue at Washington that Mr.\r\nTilden refers in the succeeding letter to Mr. Nelson J. Waterbury, then\r\na very earnest, active, and intelligent Democratic politician, a few\r\nyears Mr. Tilden's junior.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR NELSON J. WATERBURY\r\n\r\n  \"NEW LEBANON, _September 11, 1841_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR WATERBURY,--On a flying visit of a few hours, which I made to\r\nthe city some two weeks ago, I received your letter, but I was so busy\r\nin running about the country that I did not get a chance to answer it.\r\n\r\n\"You judge rightly as to my sympathy with your sentiments and action\r\nin regard to the veto. Our line of duty is plain. While we render\r\nto Tyler liberal credit for every good act he does, and sustain\r\nevery right measure which he proposes, and defend him against the\r\nunjust and unconstitutional attacks of the Whigs, we cannot give\r\nhis administration an unqualified support, or commit ourselves in\r\nfavor of his re-election. So far, we agree with him only on the bank\r\nquestion--and there as to _act_ of the veto, not as to its reasons,\r\nwhich are qualified and hesitating, and mingled with crudities and\r\nunsoundness; while as to the other questions--some of which are of\r\ngreat, if not equal, importance--we differ from him. If his course had\r\nbeen less objectionable we ought still to keep ourselves uncommitted\r\nas to the succession. We cannot enter into a bargain of office for\r\nmeasures. Whatever he does right, he must do spontaneously, and we will\r\nfreely and heartily support, leaving the future to take care of itself.\r\n\r\n\"I never regarded Tyler as a man of very high capacity, and his public\r\ndocuments since he has been President have not increased my estimate of\r\nhim. The last veto--which I have just read over--is better in matter\r\nand manner than the former, which was very objectionable in principle,\r\nbut neither of them is creditable.\r\n\r\n\"I will confess that at first I was not without apprehensions that\r\nTyler's course might be such as to conciliate a portion of our people,\r\nand weaken the efficiency of our action, while it would not be such as\r\nwe could fully approve or safely support; and that he might construct\r\na half-and-half administration in which real and thorough democratic\r\nprinciples might suffer more than by open hostility. But my fears are\r\ndiminished. Our people seem to be taking the right ground; and the\r\nenthusiasm at first excited will, I believe, settle at about the right\r\npoint. A gentleman to whose opinion I very much defer thinks that Tyler\r\nis not a man to accumulate any political strength around him; and can\r\nin no event be dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether the Whigs will attempt to put in execution any\r\nof the desperate means which have been shadowed forth--such as a formal\r\ndemand by the members of Congress for Tyler's resignation--a rejection\r\nof his nominations of official advisers in case the present cabinet\r\nshall retire--a systematic clamor to intimidate him to a surrender of\r\nhis constitutional authorities. If they do, we must stand by him and\r\nhis official rights to the uttermost.\r\n\r\n\"I intend to return to the city in about three weeks. Meanwhile I shall\r\nbe particularly glad to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for the paper you were so kind as to send me.\r\n\r\n  \"Sincerely y'rs,\r\n                      \"S. J.

I left home on the day of the date\r\nof your letter, and when I reached New York found you had left there\r\nbut a day or two before. I had a very pleasing visit from your son at\r\nmy room at the City Hotel, but should have been greatly pleased if your\r\nvisit to the city had been prolonged, as my stay was unusually long and\r\nI could have seen more of you than I have been enabled to see for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"Our victory has been truly great and gratifying, and yet your strong,\r\npractical thinking has, in my judgment, brought you, as it almost\r\nalways does, to a correct conclusion as to consequences. If the Whigs\r\nhad retained the Senate for this year it would probably have been\r\neasier for us to have regained the State completely next year. We must\r\nnot, however, complain of prosperity, and especially when it comes,\r\nas I think it has come now, by the sole energies of \"the sober second\r\nthought\" of an honest people. We must meet the crisis as it meets\r\nus. We must show the people the truth as to our finances, and then\r\nact as honest men would act, determined to pay their debts and avoid\r\ninsolvency. Everything hangs upon the action of our Legislature during\r\nthe coming session. If our friends in that body are bold and frank\r\nand honest the people will sustain them, but if they underrate the\r\nintelligence and patriotism of the people and continue the attempts to\r\nhumbug them and to purchase their good-will by their own credit sold\r\nin the market at eighty cents for the dollar, we shall as certainly be\r\nbeaten next fall as we have beaten the Whigs this. These seem to me to\r\nbe truths so plain that no one can mistake them, and I still tremble\r\nwith fear lest some of those elected to the legislature as Republicans\r\nmay, from mistaken views, from apprehensions of local expediency, from\r\nselfish interests, or from some other improper or unwise impulse, urge\r\na continuance of our system of extravagance and resist the measures\r\nindispensably necessary to a return to health and soundness.\r\n\r\n\"I have little fear of what may be done here beyond what was done at\r\nthe extra session. An effort will doubtless be made to rouse the tariff\r\nfeeling again, but our point, as I think, should be to raise no more\r\nrevenue in any way, or for any purpose, until the land-distribution\r\nbill is repealed and the system of giving away the revenue we have is\r\nformally abandoned.\r\n\r\n\"I have very little hope from President Tyler, except that he may\r\nprevent some mischief which his party would otherwise do. I do not\r\nthink there is enough of him to build upon, or that he has enough of\r\nthe democratic principles and sympathies left to govern him.\r\n\r\n\"I have not a moment of time more. Please let me hear often, and\r\nbelieve me,\r\n\r\n                            \"Most respectfully,\r\n                                    \"And truly yours,\r\n                                              SILAS WRIGHT, JR.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_Elam Tilden, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nSILAS WRIGHT, JR., TO ELAM TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"WASHINGTON, _January 29, 1842_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 18th Dec. has remained a long time\r\nwithout an answer, and I cannot now answer it, but a single subject\r\ncollateral to it.\r\n\r\n\"Within the last two days I have received two letters concerning your\r\nPost-Office matters, which have deserved and received my attention. I\r\ncannot do here all my friends ask, and have a right to ask, and from me\r\nespecially, deserve, but I try to do all I can; and yet unselfishness\r\nand indolence may often induce me to think that I do what I can, when\r\nI might do much more. I fear I have exhibited myself to you in this\r\nway in reference to your Post-Office. But of that I have not time to\r\nwrite, nor do I wish you to think, as I know you give me more credit\r\nfor faithfulness than I merit, and I give you every possible credit for\r\nvaluable and faithful friendship. I will, therefore, to the New Lebanon\r\nPost-Office.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Bryant, of the _Evening Post_, are the gentlemen\r\nto whose letters I refer. As the Senate did not meet to-day, I have\r\nhad the day to devote to business of this character, and I have just\r\nreturned, at 3 o'clock P.M., from a day most pleasantly spent in\r\nattention to them.\r\n\r\n\"Upon a personal call at the Post-Office Department I learned that,\r\nin September last, an application was made to have the name of the\r\npost-office at the Springs changed from that of 'Columbia Hall' to that\r\nof 'New Lebanon Springs,' and to have Mr. Bull removed as postmaster\r\nand Mr. Nichols appointed. Both these things were done, and Mr.\r\nFuller, the Assistant Postmaster-General, who has the charge of the\r\nappointments, supposed at the time, and now supposes, that the effect\r\nof that action was to remove the office from the Springs to Lebanon\r\nvillage, the location of the New Lebanon post-office, when you kept it.\r\nI suppose he is wholly mistaken, and as you are a matter-of-fact man,\r\nI wish you to send me papers properly signed by such disinterested men\r\nas you may see to be the most proper men, showing where the office was\r\nkept under Mr. Bull and where it is kept under Mr. Nichols; and in the\r\nsame papers you may show, if you please, where your office was kept\r\nand where the office you formerly held is now kept. Let the papers be\r\ndirected to the Postmaster-General, and have no political, but a mere\r\nlocal bearing, and make a map which will be plain, and if convenient\r\nlet the men who vouch the facts be Whigs as well as Democrats.\r\n\r\n\"You must find my apology for this very hasty and bad-looking letter in\r\nthe fact that since I began to write it I have heard of the death of a\r\nmember of our body, Mr. Dixon, of Rhode Island, and have been summoned\r\nto attend his remains and participate in arrangements for his funeral,\r\nand I have been anxious that this should go to-night and found it would\r\nnot if I did not enclose it before I left for that solemn duty.\r\n\r\n                            \"Most truly yours,\r\n                                              \"SILAS WRIGHT, JR.\r\n\r\n  \"_Elam Tilden, Esq._\"\r\n\r\nSILAS WRIGHT, JR., TO ELAM TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"WASHINGTON, _February 13, 1842_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I have but a moment to say that your favors of the 4th\r\nand 8th and the documents in relation to your P.-O. affairs all came to\r\nme together on Friday evening.

And yet he\r\nis daily removing from office our best and most worthy men, even those\r\nwhom the Whigs dare not attempt to remove, under the delusive idea that\r\nhe is filling their places with Tyler men.

I am, doubtless to my shame, not much of a\r\nsportsman. I have not, therefore, read his paper as attentively as\r\nothers, but I have seen enough of it to impress me most favorably, not\r\nonly in respect to the talents, but the just and honorable bearing of\r\nthe editor. It would, therefore, afford me pleasure to continue the\r\n_Times_, if the number of political papers which I feel myself bound to\r\ntake did not render my expenses in that line too heavy for a farmer's\r\nincome.

His\r\nfriend, John W. Edmonds, in whose office he had studied his profession,\r\na native of the same county as himself, and a lawyer of considerable\r\nability, was anxious for the appointment of Surrogate of New York city.\r\nThough he failed in this effort, he subsequently was appointed one\r\nof the Justices of the Supreme Court, largely, not to say entirely,\r\nthrough Mr. Tilden's influence.\r\n\r\nBy the spring elections of 1844 both the old parties were thrown into\r\nconfusion and driven from the field by the \"Native American\" party,\r\nso called, which appeared with a suddenness and force of a tropical\r\ncyclone and swept the country.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Mr. Van Buren in New York naturally looked to Mr. Van\r\nBuren as their candidate for a renomination to the Presidency. He was\r\ndefeated, however, in the national convention, and James K. Polk, of\r\nTennessee, received the nomination. The following letter from Mr.\r\nTilden to his brother is the only account we have from his pen of his\r\nexperiences in that convention to which he was a delegate. Unhappily,\r\nthe manuscript is incomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. J. TILDEN TO HIS BROTHER\r\n\r\n  \"BALTIMORE, _May 27, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--Here we are in a state of extraordinary excitement\r\nand great uncertainty. There is a deep and almost universal\r\ndisaffection in the South.

But the plan of the\r\ndisaffected is to require a two-third vote to make a nomination. This,\r\nthey think, and probably with correctness, that Mr. V. B. cannot get,\r\nand then they may bargain with those who vote with us but are not\r\nhearty in our cause. Some of the Penn. men who are instructed and are\r\ntherefore obliged to vote for V.

Mr. Tilden tried to anticipate the party\r\nproscription, but by some mistake, the nature of which is illegible\r\nin the following letter, he had to undergo the proscription of the\r\nvictors, which, however, neither politically nor financially involved\r\nany personal sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL J.

It was apparent\r\nto the friends of Mr. Polk that he could not carry the State of New\r\nYork without the support of the friends of Mr. Van Buren and Wright,\r\nand no less of a sacrifice than the transfer of Mr. Wright from the\r\nSenate to the Governorship could make the State reasonably secure for\r\nthe Presidential ticket. How reluctantly Mr. Wright yielded to this\r\npressure is not to be measured solely by his far-sighted doubt of its\r\npolicy and of the advantages of a victory for the Slavery-Extension\r\nparty at that time. He had other reasons of a domestic nature presented\r\nsome three years before in a most pathetic and touching letter\r\naddressed to Mr. Tilden's father.[5]\r\n\r\nThe logic of the situation presented by Mr. Wright's nomination for\r\nGovernor in 1844 required that he should by his election save the\r\nPresidential ticket and then \"succeed President Polk in 1848 or retire\r\nfrom public life,\" and Mr. Marcy to defeat Mr. Wright's re-election\r\nas Governor, or himself retire from public life. It was practically\r\nto engage in such a duel that Mr. Wright went to Albany and took the\r\noath of office on the 1st of January, 1845. He had in his favor a great\r\nparliamentary reputation, and a character for wisdom, probity, and\r\npolitical sagacity, enjoyed in a superior degree by no other American\r\nstatesman of his generation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he had to contend with an administration in whose\r\neyes all these virtues, when enlisted against slavery, were regarded\r\nonly as so many additional reasons for crushing their possessor. He\r\nhad also to contend with a very considerable number who still called\r\nthemselves Democrats, but who had deserted the party from mistrust of\r\nthe success of its financial policy, and who were impatient to recover\r\nsome sort of party standing.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden engaged in this canvass for President Polk with more zeal\r\nthan in any other except, perhaps, the last, in which he was himself a\r\ncandidate, and in both instances was betrayed by his party.\r\n\r\nNot the least efficient of his services in this campaign was the\r\nestablishment of the _Daily News_ in connection with John L.

In case of either party ever desiring to withdraw, the other to\r\nhave the refusal of the purchase of his interest, on equal terms\r\nwith those offered by any one side, or of any portion of the same at\r\nproportional rate.\r\n\r\n\"4. In case of failure of the enterprise and both desiring to give\r\nit up, the materials purchased to be vested in trust in (query--the\r\nChairman of the Gen. Committee--or Young Men's Gen.

If\r\nhereafter, from regard to health or other cause, either should desire\r\nto withdraw for longer or shorter period from active participation\r\nin editorial charge, the other remaining in charge to be entitled to\r\nan editorial salary of $2500 per annum. In case of death of either,\r\nthe other to inherit his share, subject to an annuity for ten years,\r\naccording to direction of the deceased, amounting to one-third of\r\nthat portion of the general profits which would otherwise have been\r\ndivisible between the two--the salary of $2500 in that case being\r\nallowed to survivor for editorship.\r\n\r\n\"No other points now occur to me requiring provision.\r\n\r\n  \"J.

I should\r\nlike also myself to employ my brother in it, if as clerk and general\r\naid his services should appear desirable, his compensation being fixed\r\nbetween us, ranging above a certain small minimum, according to his\r\nservices and the ability of the concern.\r\n\r\n  \"J.

The prospect\r\nof overcoming the pecuniary obstacle appears favorable. A few days will\r\ndecide the question, when I will write to you more particularly.\r\n\r\n\"A modification of the plan is meanwhile being attempted, which, if\r\nsuccessful, must greatly increase its usefulness. It is, if possible,\r\nto get the $5000 absolutely; with a condition that if we cannot get a\r\nsubscription of 25,000 or deem it wise to publish a less number, we\r\nshall have the same _value_ in such printed matter as we may choose,\r\nand additional matter at cost; which we can circulate in what way we\r\nmay think best. My own opinion is that, as a general rule, it should be\r\n_sold_, at or below cost, which will itself be very low if the quantity\r\nis large and the work managed economically. It seems to me that in this\r\nmode we could circulate 2, 3, 4, or 5 times our actual capital; that\r\nwe should tempt purchases from every part of the country, and make the\r\nmost extensive and efficient use of our money.\r\n\r\n\"Of course there are a great many details to be contemplated in\r\narranging so large a machine: I cannot now state them sufficiently even\r\nto explain my suggestions, but hope to be able to speak more definitely\r\nin a few days.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. V. B. was perhaps less impressed with the importance of the paper\r\nthan yourself, and circumstances of delicacy prevented my taking\r\nthat view of the subject. Nevertheless, he was anxious to have it\r\nundertaken, and, since my return, tho I have in no measure availed\r\nmyself of the aid which he was willing to render, our people seem\r\nbetter inclined than I expected. Still, the experiment cannot be\r\nregarded as tested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATOR SILAS WRIGHT TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"SENATE CHAMBER, WASHINGTON, _April 11, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Having labored in vain during the whole of yesterday to\r\nfind time to write to you my promised letter, and not having approached\r\nthe probability of such leisure between 8 o'clock A.M. and 12 o'clock\r\nP.M., I now take my seat for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I have conversed as extensively as I could with our Western friends\r\nupon the subject of the paper of which we take,[6] and all I can say,\r\nas to the result of my conferences, is that no dependence can be made\r\nupon them, beyond a reasonable effort to extend the subscription, in\r\ncase we shall conclude to take the hazard of making the attempt to\r\nestablish the paper. The same feeling of which I spoke to you has\r\nproduced the influences I supposed it would, and it, together with the\r\nefforts we are making here to distribute documents, has cooled the\r\nanxiety formerly expressed for such a paper, and especially so when a\r\nsuspicion arises that the man's own pocket may be connected with the\r\neffort to establish the paper.\r\n\r\n\"Still, I confess, I have not been able to diminish, to my own mind,\r\nthe importance of such a paper to our cause. I think our State press,\r\nas a general remark, in a very bad state for the pending contest. The\r\ncountry press has been, time immemorial, accustomed to look to the\r\n_Argus_ for lead and tone in these great fights, but the _Argus_,\r\nduring the whole time we have been here, appears to me to have been\r\ninsensible of the pendency of the contest, as perfectly unaware of\r\nwhat appears to me to be its true character. It is not my object to\r\ncomplain of the _Argus_, and I doubt not that the singular and very\r\nunfortunate state of things at Albany has embarrassed its cause, and\r\nperhaps presented reasons for its silence upon national questions, of\r\nwhich I am ignorant. In any event, the _Argus_ furnishes no lead to the\r\ncountry press; we have no weekly general paper, and the Whigs, through\r\nthe showers of the _Tribune_ which they are pouring over the State, are\r\ndoing much to get the start of us and to turn the current of feeling\r\nwith the impulsive and unthinking against us. At least these are my\r\nfears, and it seems to me that these must be the natural consequences\r\nof constant effort and allegation and falsehood on the one side, and\r\ncomparative silence upon the other. Of this, however, our friends\r\nat home can judge much better than I can, and I therefore renew the\r\nadvice I gave you before we parted here, to go and make Mr. Van Buren\r\na leisurely visit, and take his counsel and advice about the whole\r\nmatter, and act as he shall think best.\r\n\r\n\"You will not be surprised when I tell you that the news from your\r\ncharter election[7] has thrown everything here, for this morning, into\r\nthat state of excitement and confusion which renders it troublesome for\r\none to keep cool and good-natured both. After some months of constant\r\nsession, the atmosphere becomes so thoroughly tainted here, and the\r\nmembers of Congress themselves become either so far corrupted, or so\r\nlost in their remembrances of home and what the people really are, that\r\nthey are really more childish and more excitable than so many children,\r\nand it takes more patience than I can command to bear up against their\r\nwhims. In the result of your charter election I have experienced little\r\ndisappointment, and see no great cause of alarm. If our press would\r\nimprove the advantages it presents, it appears to me it could not fail\r\nto fix the Irish and other emigrant vote throughout the country; but\r\nin this, as in other things, I fear we shall feel the want of some\r\npaper which is recognized as having a lead and giving the facts and the\r\naims of the whole party. The _Post_ is well edited for its place and\r\ncirculation, but its exchange-list, I suppose, is not the broadest,\r\nand it never has been looked to for the party lead. I say this in no\r\ndisparagement to Mr. Bryant, for no one holds him in higher estimation\r\nthan I do, and it is our own fault and not his that his paper has not\r\nheld the leading place.\r\n\r\n\"But I must return to the subject of my letter, and writing, as I do,\r\nin my seat, and in the hearing of an excited debate, I can say little\r\nmore, even upon that. You can tell Mr. V. B. all our views about the\r\nproposed establishment of a paper as fully as I could repeat them\r\nto you as to him if I had the time, and if he shall think that we\r\noverestimate our need, or the utility of such a paper, if established,\r\nI shall be perfectly content that any farther movement be abandoned.\r\nIf he thinks it best for you to consult any of our friends at Albany\r\nhe will tell you who and how. You will let him know, too, that the\r\nreason we did not think of Albany, rather than New York, was that we\r\nsupposed the state of things and state of feeling there to be such,\r\nand the relations to our two papers there, those which would be likely\r\nto defeat any movement made there with this view, or compel it to be\r\nmade either against active opposition from our own friends or under\r\ndissatisfied feeling on the part of those connected with one of those\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me that if anything is to be done it should be done\r\nquietly, so that the paper may commence with the nominations. I do\r\nnot doubt, if subscribers are sent here to be distributed, that many,\r\nvery many, subscribers will be obtained from without the State, and\r\nespecially from Indiana and Illinois, and probably from Ohio and\r\nMichigan, but to that end all the time which can be given will be\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\"I must close, for I have been listening to speeches, while writing,\r\nuntil I do not know what I have said or what I wanted to say. After\r\nyour return let me know the result of your mission as soon as you shall\r\nfind leisure.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, most truly, yours,\r\n                           \"SILAS WRIGHT.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Private_.\r\n\r\n\"N.

Tilden had but just completed the thirty-first year\r\nof his age; the emoluments of the office were some twenty thousand\r\ndollars a year; the labor and responsibility inconsiderable. Tilden\r\nwas poor, and many years must elapse before he could hope for any\r\nsuch revenue from his profession. The offer, however tempting it was,\r\nhe promptly declined, saying that he did not labor for the election of\r\nPresident Polk to push his private interests; that when he was admitted\r\nto the bar he resolved that he would hold no merely lucrative office,\r\nand that, if he took any, it must be in the line of his profession or\r\na post of honor, but under the then existing circumstances he could\r\naccept of nothing from this administration.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth there were practically two Democratic parties,\r\nso called, in the State of New York: one led by William L. Marcy, and\r\nvulgarly known by their adversaries sometimes as \"Hardshells,\" and\r\nsometimes as \"Hunkers,\" who were either in favor of or not opposed\r\nto the extension of slavery into the free Territories from which it\r\nhad been excluded by the ordinance of 1789; and the other led by\r\nSilas Wright while he lived, also vulgarly known sometimes as the\r\n\"Softshells,\" and sometimes as \"Barnburners,\" who were opposed to the\r\nextension of slavery into those Territories.\r\n\r\nThough the division lines of these parties, like those of latitude and\r\nlongitude, were not visible to the eye, nor the parties themselves\r\nsufficiently organized to occupy hostile camps, the ends towards which\r\nthey were severally working were quite as distinct as if they were.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was probably addressed to William L. Marcy, who\r\nhad allowed himself to be made the instrument of the pro-slavery\r\ncontingent in New York, and had been on that account selected by the\r\nPresident as his Secretary of War.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nS. J. TILDEN TO----\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _1845_.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot give you in full detail the grounds of the almost universal\r\nodium with which Mr. Van Ness is regarded by the Democracy of this city\r\nand State, but will briefly allude to some of them.\r\n\r\n\"His appointment was not originally recognized as a Democratic one\r\nor received from a recognized Democratic President. He was personally\r\nand politically a stranger; did not occupy that proper representative\r\nrelation to the party here to make his selection proper or acceptable,\r\nor to give him or entitle him to their confidence. On the contrary, all\r\nthat was known of his private character and of his political tendencies\r\nwas calculated to repel such confidence.\r\n\r\n\"His conduct since has confirmed and exacerbated the sentiments with\r\nwhich his original appointment was regarded. In his official action\r\nand his political influence he has been the mere representative and\r\ninstrument of a miserable little faction, whose fortunes he has solved\r\nequally when it was in a state of partial alienation and open hostility\r\nto the Democratic party and its regular nominations. For months after\r\nMr. Polk's nomination, for two-thirds of the whole canvass, he was an\r\nopen and decided supporter of Mr. Tyler. All sorts of intrigue were\r\nemployed by this little band of officeholders and their dependents to\r\nexact from the mass of the party a partial approval of Mr. Tyler's\r\nadministration and an adoption of his appointments as a condition\r\nprecedent to his withdrawal. Such had been the abuses and corruptions\r\nof his administration in the use of its patronage here--incredible\r\nto those who like yourself have looked upon them from a less central\r\nposition--and shocking to the moral sense of honest men of all parties;\r\nsuch was the general disgust and hostility pervading the masses of the\r\nDemocracy which had been for several years vexed by the abuses and\r\ncorruptions of the government patronage employed for the purpose of\r\ndistracting the party; so large was the number who had been the subject\r\nof exclusion and proscription because of their very political fidelity,\r\nand so large also the number who desired a new distribution of official\r\nfavors, that such a concession as was demanded would have revolted\r\npublic sentiment, in all probability have lost this city by a very\r\nlarge majority. Such was the conviction at the time of our soundest and\r\nmost judicious men, who kindly and temperately but firmly resisted and\r\ndefeated the project.\r\n\r\n\"The perilous crisis in our local politics you may form some idea\r\nof, if you will remember that there were then, delicately poised and\r\nuncertain to go for Clay or Polk until within a few weeks of the\r\nelection, a body of men more than sufficient to have changed the\r\nresult in this State. Mr. Polk has now to choose between the 19/20ths\r\nof the party and this faction; between the disinterested and honest who\r\nwere true to his and the party's interest, and the venal gathered from\r\nall former parties into the common receptacle of Tylerism, who would\r\nhave sacrificed both to their own mercenary objects. His choice between\r\nthem will indicate the _morale_ of his character and administration.\r\nEver since Mr. Tyler's attempt in 1841 to become the Presidential\r\ncandidate of the Democracy, the patronage of the government in this\r\ncity has been assiduously employed to harass or control the party here.\r\nIt was managed by Mr. Curtis, who was skilful in if not the originator\r\nof all the corrupt tactics of the Glentworth school; and since his\r\nremoval, his machinery has been used by Mr. Van Ness [with] much more\r\nindustry and zeal and with no less profligacy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO WM. H. HAVEMEYER[9] (probably)\r\n\r\n  \"WASHINGTON, _March 4, 1845_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I have received your letter of yesterday, which is much\r\nmore acceptable than your personal presence. Indeed, I suppose that\r\nyour intelligence from Albany would have changed the design, even if\r\nyou had entertained it, of coming here. _I_ did not expect you to start\r\nbefore Mon. morning.[10]\r\n\r\n\"As far as your personal position is concerned, it is sustained by your\r\nrenewed declension--perhaps uttered, although that it did not need.\r\nFor be assured that nothing has been done to bring in question the\r\nsincerity and reality of your declension, as well as the good faith of\r\nyour grounds, but everything to satisfy both. It, however, does lessen\r\nour right, or _apparent_ right, to complain of the precipitancy of Mr.\r\nPolk's action before the receipt of Mr. Van Buren's letter.\r\n\r\n\"I judge from your letter that every time the excitement of the\r\nparticular motive operating on your mind for the moment to accept any\r\ndepartment, subsides, your aversion returns and strengthens. This shows\r\nthat it is the predominant and settled conviction, which ought not to\r\nbe, without imperative necessity, disregarded, and applies even in\r\nthe case of a _recast_. In this connection, I should add to the hasty\r\nview of the affair I yesterday gave you that Bancroft thinks that if\r\nyou had accepted the War a recast could have been had, and intimates\r\nthe possibility as if from the President. This may be so--others have\r\nthought so the whole time--but I doubt, for reasons I will explain when\r\nI see you.\r\n\r\n\"Last evening we had an interview with the President. Representations\r\nhad been made to him which were repeated by us and which he said\r\n_convinced_ him of his error, but it was now too late to retract if the\r\nHeavens and the Earth came together. He assured us that he had acted\r\nfrom misinformation, and with the best intentions--that he would do all\r\nhe could to counteract the consequences of his error--that he should\r\nbe President himself, although not coming in with the same personal\r\nstrength as some of his predecessors, and would protect us from any\r\nmalign influences--that in regard to the important appointments in N.\r\nY. he would rely on his old friends and act with the concurrence of V.\r\nB. and W. He has repeatedly and to different persons pledged himself as\r\nto the Collector. His asseverations of attachment, fidelity, and fair\r\ndealing towards N. Y. were earnest and strong, almost passing dignity,\r\nyet with an air of sincerity which made a strong impression as to mere\r\npersonal intentions.\r\n\r\n\"Still I have perhaps more fears than hopes. The administration is\r\ncaptured by the quasi-Van Buren men who went with us before Baltimore\r\nbut deserted us there; who cannot risk the power of the government in\r\nthose who understand and remember them; and confederate now against\r\nWright. At least that seems to me the influence--which in spite of\r\nPolk's probable intentions--has shaped the Cabinet. Calhoun has no\r\nshare. There will be no one in the Cabinet on whom N. Y. can rely.\r\nBuchanan you know. Walker has a strong will enough to predominate over\r\nall the rest. Marcy is taken by the same influence which selected\r\nWalker because while he answers some of the demands of decency towards\r\nN. Y. is least identified with Wright. Mason, Atty. Gen. (unless ____\r\nto James) and R. Johnson. How can Bancroft stand up against all the\r\nothers?\r\n\r\n  \"Truly y'rs,\r\n                    \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNELSON J. WATERBURY TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _March 8, 1845_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--I have seen Secor. He says that he only contemplated\r\nspeaking to Langley, if you had no objection, but to go no further.\r\nThat he did not suppose you understood or thought or expected him to\r\ntransfer to anybody unless for a price. That he would write to you\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"You will see Purdy is going ahead for Collector. He has been\r\nrecommended by both of the Genl. Committees, various ward associations,\r\nand a German meeting. Secor tells me he also has a strong letter\r\nfrom Van Buren, and he went to Albany last night to get testimonials\r\nfrom there, I suppose. If he is appointed he will fill the Custom\r\nHouse with a laughable assortment--good, bad, and indifferent. I am\r\ninclined to believe that he will be more thorough in turning out than\r\nwe expected. Of course you understand that all his recommendations are\r\nbargained for; places are to be given to the men who get them up. If he\r\nsucceeds you may rely that the dissatisfaction which his appointment\r\nwill excite will be excessive. There is one way to [head?] him. That\r\nis a merchants' memorial, asking that none but a commercial man be\r\nappointed. This would do, and Havemeyer could be made Collector and\r\nPurdy Postmaster. But nothing ought to be done unless Polk is entirely\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n\"Henry, my brother, is just down, has been at Albany. Our friends\r\nare very much dissatisfied. Polk's offers to Wright and Butler are\r\nnot regarded as having been made in good faith. It is supposed that\r\nhe has his eye on a second term. I incline to concur in the first\r\npartially--that is, they were mere compliments--not in the second.\r\nI think Polk is as weak as dish-water, but honest. If he is really\r\nso, and could or would be wise, he should send in Havemeyer's name\r\nforthwith. I do not believe that our friends north of this can be\r\ninduced to urge it. By the way, Purdy's movements to get this office\r\nare, and his appointments would be, a second edition of Jesse Hoyt's.\r\nThis is by far the most important thing to be seen to now.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose if Bancroft is confirmed you will get on finely with the\r\nRenshaw business. There will be nothing to call you home in some days.\r\n\r\n                               \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                                \"N. J. W.\r\n\r\n  \"_S. J. Tilden, Esq._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO----\r\n\r\n  \"HUDSON, _March 17, 1845_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--An hour or so before I left Washington I learned of an\r\nact of my friend O'Sullivan which gave me some annoyance and which I\r\nintended at once to explain to you. I should have done so before except\r\nfor a rapid current of business which hurried me here.\r\n\r\n\"You might, fairly enough, perhaps, suppose that O'S.'s act, although\r\nnot instigated by me, was induced by his knowledge of my views. But\r\nsuch an inference would be unjust to me. I suppose the thing was\r\nsuggested to him by two circumstances. First, his knowledge that Mr.\r\nCroswell had, in December, proposed it to me with some urgency, and,\r\nas (after casting about to discover his motive for a proposition which\r\nhad until then never been presented to my own mind) I concluded to\r\ninterest myself in behalf of Gov. Marcy for a Cabinet appointment,\r\nwhich I had at the time declined to do. Second, the arrival the night\r\nbefore of a gentleman from New York who said that my name had been\r\ndiscussed--in highly respectable quarters certainly--in reference to\r\nthe Collectorship. In reply to some remarks of O'S. afterwards, I\r\nsaid that even if that idea had been seriously entertained I should\r\nnot desire the place both from inadequacy to its physical labor and\r\naversion to its hangman's duty at the present time. In that connection,\r\nthe other place was spoken of as free from these objections and nearly\r\nas advantageous to me personally, and in reference to the political\r\nadministration, as the Collectorship; but I said, that while the large\r\nvalue and light labor of it would be attractive, I should hesitate\r\nto take it, even if it were offered to me, which I certainly did not\r\nexpect, from reluctance to hold a mere _pecuniary_, professional\r\noffice, and to surrender or so far postpone my professional pursuits. I\r\ndid not, I suppose, decide the question, because spoken of casually, as\r\nit was, I had no thought that it was, or was ever to become, a case to\r\nbe decided.\r\n\r\n\"The moment I learned what O'S. had done, I told him that it was\r\nwrong--that you and Mr. V. B. ought, in no case, to make any\r\nrecommendations until the Collectorship was settled and settled\r\nproperly, because it might, on some pretence or claim of apportionment\r\nbetween the different sections of the party, embarrass that case. I\r\nshould have written on my way back to that effect had not Gen. Dix,\r\nwhom I saw just as I was starting, told me he had done so.\r\n\r\nAside from this, I considered the question a balanced one, which I\r\ncould not decide in favor of acceptance without some consideration and\r\nadvice. Under no circumstances which I now contemplate could I present\r\nmyself as an _applicant_ for a place of this description. I did not\r\nknow that after what has occurred you and Mr. V. B. would intermeddle\r\nat all in such matters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR WRIGHT TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"ALBANY, _May 1, 1845_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Your note of the 26. ult. was duly recd. and I will\r\nattempt to give you a brief reply to it.\r\n\r\n\"The pardon of Honoria Shepherd was granted upon the exclusive\r\napplication of the Inspectors and Keepers of the Prison, upon the\r\nground that she was effectually reformed, and that longer confinement\r\nwould be injurious, and not beneficial. Miss Bruce, one of the\r\nAssistant Matrons of the prison, came up in person to get the pardon,\r\nand said her health compelled her to leave the prison, that she was\r\nabout to go to Illinois to reside, and that she proposed to take\r\nHonoria with her, and keep her with her in Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent copies of all the papers in this case to Judge Edmonds,\r\nwho was a leading person in the application, upon whom I principally\r\nrelied, and he will show them to you, if you wish to look at them. He,\r\ntoo, will advise about any defence of men in this case.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Henry was pardoned upon the recommendation of the Board of\r\nInspectors of the prison, upon the ground that he was in a confirmed\r\nconsumption, was a patient in the Hospital, a constant expense, and\r\nmust remain so while he lived, and that he had friends who were willing\r\nto receive, nurse, and take care of him, if pardoned. This was a\r\nvoluntary report of the Board of Inspectors, embracing the report\r\nof the Surgeon upon 13 permanent invalid Convicts, only two of whom\r\nwere known to have friends able or willing to take and take care of\r\nthem, and those the inspectors recommended for pardons, considering\r\nit inhumane to ask pardons for the others to turn them out sick and\r\nwithout home, or friends. I. Parsons of your city is the father-in-law\r\nof Henry, and takes him to take care of him. Parsons is a Ship joiner\r\nand Spar maker, and his daughter, the wife of Henry, who came for the\r\npardon, has a highly respectable appearance.\r\n\r\n\"The pardon of George Potter was granted upon the application of\r\nWilliam F. Godfrey of your City, who gave his address to me as No. 94\r\nGrove Street. He brought a letter of introduction to Judge Edmonds,\r\nspeaking of him as his neighbor, referring to his business and saying\r\n'I beg to say that you can fully rely upon his representations in the\r\nmatter.'\r\n\r\n\"Godfrey presented a petition numerous and respectably signed,\r\nrepresenting Potter, though guilty, as the dupe of old offenders, the\r\noffence for which he was convicted as his first offence, and him as\r\nvery penitent and subdued, and earnestly praying his pardon.\r\n\r\n\"Potter was arrested on fresh pursuit, on the charge of picking a\r\npocket in Broadway, and the report of the testimony showed that he\r\nwas one of 4 or 5 who must have committed the felony. One witness was\r\nvery positive that Potter took the pocket book, but another witness\r\ntestified that he arrested Potter, that he kept his eye upon him from\r\nthe time he started to run, and that, upon search, no pocket book, or\r\nmoney, was found upon him. Yet that he was principal or accessory,\r\nthere is no doubt.\r\n\r\n\"A letter from James M. Smith Jr., Attorney for Potter on his trial,\r\nsays Potter always avowed that he did not pick the pocket, and\r\nexpresses the belief that, though guilty, he was the dupe of others.\r\n\r\n\"A letter from the Keeper of the Prison says 'Potter has conducted\r\n_very_ well, since he has been an inmate of this prison, and he appears\r\nto show deep contrition for his \"_crime_\" and degradation; but he is a\r\nman of peculiar temperament, which renders it extremely difficult to\r\njudge, with any degree of certainty, the true state of his feelings.'\r\n\r\n\"This is a brief sketch of the paper case presented. Mr. Godfrey\r\nassumed to speak of Potter from personal knowledge, and said he came\r\nto this country from England, some year and a half ago, a young man,\r\nwith a wife and two or three children, and with $15,000 in cash;\r\nthat he fell into the company of some English blacklegs in New York,\r\nwho induced him to gamble, drink, and carouse with them, until they\r\nstripped him of his money, and vitiated his habits, and rendered him\r\ndesperate from want, when they commenced to initiate him into the art\r\nand mysteries of picking pockets; that in his first attempt he was\r\ncaught and convicted, while the real rogues and the booty escaped; that\r\nhis friends in England had been kept in ignorance of his course and his\r\nfate; that they were wealthy and respectable; that friends in New York\r\nhad sent his wife and children to them, instructing her not to tell of\r\nhis condition; and that they were satisfied his disgrace and punishment\r\nhad prepared him, if pardoned and sent to them, to pursue a different\r\nand an honest and respectable course, and they only asked a pardon\r\nconditioned that he should leave the country, never to return to it.\r\n\r\n\"Confiding in these representations of Mr. Godfrey, I granted the\r\npardon with such a condition, and I now suppose Potter sailed for\r\nEngland either on the 15th or 20th of April.\r\n\r\n\"Since I have seen the strictures in the newspapers upon this case,\r\nI have been very fearful that I was imposed upon by Mr. Godfrey, and\r\nespecially as he has not come forward either to justify, or excuse, my\r\nact. I did act principally upon his representations, under Mr. Edmond's\r\nendorsement of him, and I should, at the least, have required him to\r\nput those statements upon paper, and made them upon his oath. I did\r\nneither.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to the matter of explanation and defense, I have felt in no\r\nhaste, because I am sensible that I may deserve some castigation for\r\nhaving been too yielding in the first and last of these cases, and I\r\nhave endeavored to school myself neither to wince, nor to be made sour\r\nby fault finding, which I am conscious I deserve, but to try to be\r\nimproved and made better by it. If I were to make a defence for myself\r\nI should make about the substance of these remarks and this Confession\r\na preface to it, and yet it might not be either very graceful, or very\r\nwise.\r\n\r\n\"This matter of pardons is the most troublesome to me of anything I\r\nyet find connected with my troublesome office. The applications will,\r\nI think, average from 3 to 5 per day, from the day I took the oath of\r\noffice. My predecessor left an enormous legacy of undecided cases, and\r\nseveral with promises of pardons after specific periods, which are\r\noccasionally falling in, and this has greatly increased my labor.\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend to exercise this fearful power carelessly, or loosely,\r\nand yet I feel daily that I am in danger of doing it. I find that\r\nCourts, and Judges, and Jurors, and District Attorneys, sign with some\r\nof the facility which attends applications for office, and that the\r\nofficers of the prison are also sometimes under the influence of the\r\namiable weakness, so that there is no standard by which I can govern my\r\naction, and it is probably impossible to avoid occasional impositions.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you most sincerely for your friendly care, manifested by your\r\nnote, and will now leave these cases with you, and Mr. O'Sullivan, with\r\nwhom I had a hasty verbal conversation about them yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"Will you do me the favor to read this hasty letter to my friend Judge\r\nVanderpoel, and say to him that I should have written it to him, if\r\nI had not preferred to trouble you with it, that I thank him most\r\nearnestly for his letter to Mr. Van Buren, and have intended to write\r\nhim daily, since I saw that letter, but have not been able to find\r\nthe time; and that, while I will hold this as the necessary answer\r\nfrom me to the part of it touching pardons, I will soon write him a\r\nsatisfactory reply to the personal portions of it, for which I also\r\nthank him, as he is one of the last men I would have intentionally\r\nwounded by a careless, and what was intended to be a jocose remark.\r\n\r\n  \"I am Very Truly Y'rs,\r\n                         \"SILAS WRIGHT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO J. L. O'SULLIVAN\r\n\r\n  \"WASHINGTON, _May 31_ (_Sat._), _2:30 P.M., 1845_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR O'S.,--At the levee last evening which I attended for the\r\npurpose, I made an appointment with the Pres., and am now waiting in\r\nthe War for the Cabinet to disperse.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon I had seen Ritchie for a few moments, and made an\r\nengagement with him. I had a considerable talk with Seth Barton at\r\nthe levee and with Tom Green at breakfast. All of them introduced\r\nthe subject of the Collectorship, and all of them especially warned\r\nme against imprudence or menace in the interview which they seem to\r\nassume I am to have with the Pres.--all tell me he is very sensitive\r\nto the idea of compulsion--and that the greatest obstacle we have is\r\nthe indiscretion of some of us or of those who favor us. They all are\r\nexceedingly afraid that they may be thought to be afraid, which shows,\r\nI suppose, that they are only calmly conscious of their own courage.\r\nBut only think of it--such admonitions to _me_! the very incarnation of\r\nFalstaffian valor!\r\n\r\n\"I replied to Ritchie's caution--which was the first I received; and\r\nwhich was given when I was talking with some decision, with great\r\ndignity. I _ought_ to have thanked him for its good intention while I\r\nintimated that it was superfluous--I told him that I did not come here\r\nto forget what was due to Mr. Polk or what was due to myself; I had no\r\ndesign to obtrude upon the President; I had no personal interest in the\r\nquestion about Van Ness or any solicitude except as it should affect\r\nthe party and the administration; my only doubt was whether I should\r\nseek an interview on the subject; I was willing to state facts, make\r\nexplanations, expose the whole truth, if the President desired to hear\r\nit, respectfully but frankly; the administration was mainly interested\r\nin coming to a right decision. We had no idea of hostility to it if\r\nit was faithful to our principles--the only question was whether it\r\nwas to assail us. All we asked of it was to let us alone. Our politics\r\nwere now in excellent condition. We could take care of the Whigs and\r\nConservatives together if the administration would not systematically\r\nembarrass us, and I rather thought we could if it did. But we thought\r\nwe were entitled to an amnesty from our friends at least while we were\r\nso busy with our enemies. The old gentleman seemed greatly mystified,\r\nbut I promised to explain hereafter.\r\n\r\n  \"(_Confidential._)\r\n\r\n\"_Sund. Morn._\r\n\r\n\"I was not able to send my letter yesterday, and now add a word. I\r\nhad an interview with the President yesterday. I ran over the case of\r\nVan Ness pretty freely. He replied at considerable length, _ascribing\r\nthe delay in his removal to the improper manner in which it had been\r\ndemanded_. He did not _say_, but implied that he had never intended\r\nnot to remove him; made no defence or argument on the question of its\r\npropriety; merely excused the delay. Mr. Butler, he said, had written\r\nto him that it would do no harm to retain him until the year expired,\r\nif it were immediately announced that a particular man would then be\r\nappointed. He complained bitterly of the attempts to intimidate and\r\ncoerce him--talking magnificently about being himself President and the\r\n_locum tenen_ for nobody; said that in his own time, perhaps Monday,\r\nperhaps afterwards, Van Ness should be removed, but swore with that\r\nterrible oath, \"if the heavens and the earth come together,\" by which\r\nRitchie and Green and Barton had successively warned me he might refuse\r\nif a mischance word of mine should chafe his angry mood, that he would\r\nnot appoint Coddington. He should select a man, he said, who would be\r\nreceived with applause throughout the State; on his own judgment, whom\r\nhe knew and had served with. Who that man was he did not say and I did\r\nnot inquire, though I did express myself with some freedom as to what\r\nthe man should do. Probably the question may now be deemed settled; for\r\nyou remember he employed the same planetary concussion to illustrate\r\nthe fixed irrevocable fate by which Marcy was to represent New York in\r\nthe Cabinet. His solemn form of fiat, I suppose, answers as the \"By the\r\nEternal\" of the younger Hickory, and, being partly of earth and partly\r\nof heaven, is undoubtedly of an improved quality of imaginary thunder.\r\nStill it did not shake my nerves, as a lady's displeasure might. I took\r\nit quietly, and talked occasionally as I had a chance, not so fully\r\non all points as I wished, or mean, if an opportunity comes unsought;\r\nbut, although I was conscious of having exposed myself to a part of a\r\nvery respectable performance for the benefit of the rebellious Butler,\r\nDix, and O'Sullivan, in which, perhaps, I might lose a little when\r\nit came to be privately repeated to the Cabinet and confidants, I\r\nthought that, nevertheless, I should not be justified in converting\r\nfarce into tragedy. So I behaved well and was myself well treated. I\r\ninquired what was the 'intimidation' and 'coercion' referred to, and\r\nI believe was not very definitely answered. The only specification I\r\ngot was letters from three--not more, he said, than three persons,\r\nwhose names, he said, he would not tell me--who might never know\r\nabout it themselves, whom he could not answer without getting into a\r\ncorrespondence inconsistent with his dignity, who might not be aware of\r\nthe expressions they had incautiously and rashly used. Your letter to\r\nBancroft was distinctly alluded to as, among other offences, alleging\r\n'violated pledges.' I expressed great doubts whether its contents had\r\nnot been exaggerated, and when he said he had not seen it, and it was\r\nnot intended for him, advised him to get it and read it. The warmth of\r\nthese communications I vindicated as true representations of public\r\nfeeling, expressed in honest freedom; though this part of the subject\r\ncame up when the interview was forced to a close, and I could not do\r\nfull justice. Some explanations, which it was not prudent to make in\r\nthe danger of exoneration, I have since made to his intimates with\r\nkindness but clearness and coldness, and shall to him if circumstances\r\nsolicit. Am not I a lucky fellow? Soothed all day by the fiery\r\nSoutherns, and then sitting quietly, as in a summer shower, when the\r\nstorm is beating fiercely on those imprudent young men, Butler, Dix,\r\nO'Sullivan--even, while refreshing myself, putting up my umbrella to\r\nprotect them! I only _talked_ treason.\r\n\r\n\"He felt deeply the warm letter of his old friend Hoffman--an honest\r\nman. He would swear by him, live by him, die by him. I added Mr.\r\nH. was a true-hearted man--he was the last man almost from whom I\r\nparted; I had a long conversation with him. He fully concurred in the\r\nindispensable necessity of removing Van Ness--in the earnest and strong\r\nconvictions expressed by the others on that subject. The Pr. replied\r\nnot. I think it was he that told me, and then that there had been\r\nletters saying that Hoffman would make his own acceptance conditional\r\non V. N.'s removal. No, it was Cave Johnson afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"The President expressed great sorrow that he could not see Silas\r\nWright for an hour and have his advice. As to what, I did not certainly\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN A.

TALLMAGE\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _December 25, 1845_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--A few days since I received a note from your brother\r\nrequesting me to call and see him, and I was distressed to find that\r\nin the short interval since I had last met him his health had become\r\nso dangerously worse. He is anxious to obtain a consulship or some\r\nother place which will give him the benefit of a climate better\r\nadapted to a chronic pulmonary disease, and a reasonable support while\r\nsubjecting himself to its remedial influence. I need not say I felt\r\na strong sympathy for him; but I feel some disability for rendering\r\nhim useful aid, which I will in part explain and which he and you\r\nwill appreciate. Although he sustained the Democratic ticket at the\r\nlate general election, and did service which I understand has been\r\nhandsomely recognized by the President, his course was so little\r\nconspicuous that the impression left by his association with former\r\nevents will naturally predominate in the minds of the party generals.\r\nIf, therefore, the administration should regard the case in the light\r\nof mere party expediency, I do not think I could in candor towards them\r\nsay what would be of much avail to him; especially as caution in my\r\nexpressions being the more necessary lest I should expose myself to be\r\nquoted not merely as offering a particular instance in regard to which\r\nI should have no hesitation if it stood alone, but as contributing to\r\nand thus sanctioning a general distinction of local patronage which\r\nis objected to, in part on the same ground on which this might be\r\nexposed to unfriendly criticism, and which has prevailed here in the\r\nlesser appointments which most interest the mass of the party to an\r\nextent that excites very great dissatisfaction. Nor does it seem to\r\nme that formal recommendations can at all benefit your brother, nor\r\nanything which I might say in his behalf, unless the administration\r\ndesired affirmatively to do something for him. If such be their real\r\nfeeling--if they regard his case as one to be controlled by liberal\r\nconsiderations, if they recognize the strong appeal it makes to their\r\nhumanity, and if they are nevertheless restrained by solicitude as\r\nto how the appointment would be received by their political friends\r\nhere--it is possible that I may be of some little service to him,\r\nin the only contingency in which it seems to me any service can be\r\nefficient. The object of my letter is to assure you that if the\r\nadministration take favorable views of the matter, as I hope and trust\r\nthey may, I shall be ready to do what I can to cause the appointment\r\nto be well received by the party here; and that such, I believe,\r\nwill be the general disposition of those of our friends to whom the\r\ncircumstances are made known. The only hesitation I have in saying this\r\nis lest it may be assuming in me; but if you think it will do your\r\nbrother any good, you may communicate it for that purpose. I did not\r\nventure to write to anybody other than yourself lest, in my ignorance\r\nof the state of feeling on which my letter might fall, and however\r\nguarded my language might be, I should unwittingly do harm, which,\r\nhowever frankly I may write to you, I shall avoid, even if I fail to do\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"With the best wishes for the success of this object and your welfare,\r\n\r\n  Truly y'rs,\r\n                   \"S. J.

One of the\r\nconsequences was the establishment of the _Atlas_ at Albany by the\r\nfriends of Van Buren and Wright. The _Argus_ was conducted by Edwin\r\nCroswell, a then veteran journalist, and the _Atlas_ by a Mr. Van Dyke,\r\nassisted by a very clever young man of Irish extraction named Cassidy.\r\nThese two prints registered the stages of the ineffectual struggle of\r\nthe Van Buren and Wright party with the administration at Washington, a\r\nspecimen of which is disclosed in the following correspondence between\r\nMr. Croswell, Mr. Tilden, and John Van Buren, a gifted son of the\r\nex-President Van Buren, and then rapidly becoming a conspicuous figure\r\nin national politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.

CROSWELL\r\n\r\n  \"ALBANY, _January 27, 1846_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--The inquiry which your favor of yesterday contains is so\r\nmade up of statements and inferences--so very general in some respects,\r\nand so imperfect in others--that an answer to it which expresses\r\nneither more nor less than the truth must be more specific than you\r\nseem to ask.\r\n\r\n\"I understood from gentlemen whose veracity I could not question\r\nthat on the Wednesday before the recent caucus you made to them a\r\ncommunication to this effect:\r\n\r\n\"You said that it would not do for you to make any further proposition\r\nrelative to the union of the _Argus_ and _Atlas_, but you invited\r\na proposition to be made to you, the terms of which you specified\r\nas follows: That the _Argus_ and _Atlas_ should be united, at an\r\nappraised valuation; that the joint establishment should be owned by\r\nMessrs. French, Cassidy, and Sherman Croswell in three equal parts;\r\nthat you should withdraw from the concern; that Messrs. Cassidy and\r\nSherman Croswell should be candidates for State printers; and that\r\nthe emoluments of that office, if it were conferred upon them, should\r\nbelong to the joint establishment.\r\n\r\n\"This proposition, you said, would be entirely acceptable to yourself,\r\nand you expressed great confidence that you could induce your friends\r\nin the Senate to confirm it. In that event, the bill purporting to\r\nabolish the office of State Printer, of which you expressed decided\r\ndisapprobation, would, you hoped, be postponed or greatly modified\r\nor defeated, and harmony, as you thought, restored to the Republican\r\nparty. The result of your efforts was to be communicated to those from\r\nwhom the proposition was in form to emanate before the assembling of\r\nthe caucus. Your suggestion was in all respects adopted and followed by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Deriving from these facts, as well as from the interviews which you\r\nhad sought with me on the subject, strong hopes that an arrangement\r\nsatisfactory to all parties, consistent with public duty, and conducive\r\nto the interests and the honor of the Democratic cause, would be\r\neffected; and having reason to believe that more of the radical\r\nDemocrats of the Assembly and all those of the Senate would assent to\r\nthe union of the two papers (being first convinced that the advocacy\r\nof sound Democratic doctrines would be essentially secured)--of which\r\nfact you were, after consultation with them, advised--you may imagine\r\nmy surprise when, half an hour before the caucus met, I learned that,\r\nalthough twenty-four hours had elapsed, you had not even communicated\r\nwith several of your prominent friends in the Senate; had not seen\r\nyour partner and relative, who is a member of your own family; had\r\nfailed to keep your appointments; and, when sent for, at my instance,\r\nwho was still unwilling to impute a design to evade, were unprepared\r\nto close the negotiation, to make any definite arrangement, or even a\r\nproposition. Attended as this failure was by the forcing through the\r\nSenate, at an extra session, held in the mean time, by your friends,\r\nof the bill you disapproved, and followed, as it has since been by\r\nyour advocacy in the _Argus_ of that bill, I am forced, in the absence\r\nof all explanation, to entertain more distrust than I remember having\r\nexpressed, or wish to express, of a negotiation in which I engaged at\r\nyour solicitation.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the particular language which your letter ascribes to\r\nme, I have no recollection of having used it, nor does it, in the way\r\nyou have stated it, remind me of any conversation out of which the\r\ninformation you repeat to me may have originated. Nor does it seem to\r\nme in substance correct, so far as it may be construed to imply much\r\nof a direct personal communication between you and me after the first\r\nstage of the negotiation; or any effort to 'compromise the questions\r\nof difference between the _Argus_ and _Atlas_,' further than to unite\r\nthese two papers, which I was sincerely anxious to bring about, and\r\nafter the intimations from you did actively recommend to my associate\r\nDemocrats of the Assembly, while I left them and myself at perfect\r\nliberty to act according to our individual judgments and consciences\r\non any questions of reform in regard to the office or the functions of\r\nthe State Printer. But that I may not have adverted to the distinction,\r\nif there be any in substance, between your making a proposition and\r\nsuggesting one to be made to you which you declared beforehand would be\r\nentirely acceptable to you, and may have spoken in general terms of the\r\nproposition as yours as well as that of those you represent, is very\r\npossible; and that I may have casually expressed the sentiments which\r\nthe facts above stated necessarily excited, in regard to the part you\r\nbore in the transaction is possible, though I do not remember having\r\ndone so, and I am sure if I have not the forbearance is to be imputed\r\nsolely to reluctance with which I have put an unfavorable construction\r\nupon your conduct.\r\n\r\n\"If there is any explanation to be offered I should be glad to hear it,\r\nand to learn if I have even in thought done you the least injustice.\r\n\r\n  \"With great respect, your obdt. servt.,\r\n                                 \"S.

In that\r\nevent the bill to abolish the office of State Printer, pending in\r\nthe Senate, of which you expressed your decided disapprobation, you\r\nhoped would be postponed and greatly modified or defeated, and harmony\r\nrestored to the Republican party. The result of your efforts was to be\r\ncommunicated to those who were to make the proposition prior to the\r\nassembling of the caucus. The precise offer that you invited was made\r\nto you on Wedy. aftn.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing these facts, and having strong hopes that an amicable\r\narrangement satisfactory to all parties would be brought about thro'\r\nyour exertions, and having reason to believe that the great mass of the\r\nradical Democrats of the Assembly and all those in the Senate approved\r\nof the union of the two papers on the terms now suggested, which they\r\nthought secured the advocacy of sound principles, you may imagine my\r\nsurprise on being informed, a half-hour before the caucus met, that\r\naltho' more than 24 hours had intervened, you had not even communicated\r\nwith several of your personal friends in the Senate, had not been able\r\nto see your own partner and cousin, who is a member of your family,\r\nfailed to keep yr. appointments, was found with difficulty, and was\r\nnot prepared when found to make any definite arrangement or even\r\nproposition. Attended as this failure on your part was by the forcing\r\nthro' the Senate by your friends of the bill you disapproved, and\r\nfollowed by strong and indignant denunciations the next morning in the\r\ncolumns of the _Argus_ of several leading Democrats in the Senate, and\r\nwarm advocacy of the same bill, I was forced, in the absence of all\r\nexplanation, to conclude that if you had not acted in bad faith you\r\nhad certainly trifled in a most extraordinary manner with a subject I\r\nconsidered of great importance.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances, I claim credit for myself in speaking of\r\nyour conduct with great forbearance, and have no recollection of using\r\nthe language you attribute to me in your note, tho', as I did not\r\nadvert to the distinction (if there be any in substance) between your\r\nmaking a proposition and inviting one to be made to you, which you\r\ndeclared beforehand would be acceptable to you, I have doubtless spoken\r\nfreely of the part you bore in the transaction as inexplicable and\r\ncensurable.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be happy to hear any explanation you have to make, and glad to\r\nknow if I have unintentionally, even in thought, done you injustice.\"\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATE OF THE ELECTION OF MR.

Hereafter to own equally. The difference of capital to be\r\nequalled by credits to H. G. L., the necessary amount on his advances,\r\nexisting or prospective.\r\n\r\n\"H. G. L. contracts to devote himself faithfully to the business and\r\ninterests of the paper--to conduct with the utmost energy and fidelity\r\nthe procuring of advertisers.\r\n\r\n\"Failing to do this, he is to retire, giving O'S. all reasonable\r\nfacility to substitute some other persons on reasonable terms of sale.\r\nAll disputes and differences of opinion as to these stipulations to be\r\nleft to the decision of----\"\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the pro-slavery party in the election of Mr. Polk\r\nresulted in the revolt of Texas from Mexico, her annexation to the\r\nUnited States, and a war with Mexico.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of his term, Governor Wright was renominated almost\r\nunanimously. If elected, nothing in the future appeared more certain\r\nthan that he would have been Mr. Polk's successor in the Presidency.\r\nThe reversion of the Chief Magistracy to such a formidable opponent of\r\nslavery extension as Governor Wright, who could neither be corrupted\r\nnor cajoled, was then regarded at Washington as a peril, to avoid\r\nwhich no sacrifice was too great. The magnitude of the sacrifice of\r\nMr. Wright was as correctly appreciated at Washington, and by the very\r\nmen who were to offer it up as a propitiation to the demon of slavery,\r\nas at Albany; but to the short-sighted vision of the statesmen then in\r\nthe ascendant at the national capital the political supremacy of the\r\nslave-holding States was to be maintained at any price.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Federal government was, therefore, all turned\r\nagainst Mr. Wright at the Gubernatorial election in 1847, and it proved\r\nto be sufficient to give a majority of some eleven thousand to John\r\nYoung, the candidate of the Whigs.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright, at the expiration of his term, returned to his home in St.\r\nLawrence County, consoled by the reflection that the evil consequences\r\nof taking him from the Senate and making him a party to the faction\r\nfights in New York had resulted as he had predicted--in disaster to the\r\nparty and in his own political destruction. He died within nine months\r\nfrom his retirement.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Texas and the war with Mexico which ensued resulted\r\nin the acquisition of vast territories, sooner or later to be organized\r\ninto States, to be consecrated to freedom or to slavery. To open these\r\nStates to slavery and reinforce the slave representation in Congress,\r\nit had become necessary to paralyze the Democratic party in New York.\r\n\r\nThe first steps towards this end had been taken in the defeat of Mr.\r\nVan Buren's renomination for the Presidency, and putting a Southern\r\nman in his place. The second had been taken in the defeat of Governor\r\nWright's re-election in 1847; the third, yet to be taken, was to\r\ndeprive the Democracy of New York of its legitimate influence in\r\nCongress and the next Democratic national convention.\r\n\r\nIn this scheme the administration was entirely successful. At the\r\ncommencement of President's Polk's administration the Democratic\r\nparty was completely in the ascendant in New York. It had elected its\r\nGovernor and Lieutenant-Governor; it had a majority in both branches\r\nof the Legislature, and a majority of the delegation in Congress.\r\nAt the expiration of two years its Chief Magistrate was a Whig, and\r\nits Congressional delegation was reduced to a meagre minority. The\r\nfollowing year the whole legislative power of the State was transferred\r\nto the Whigs by an overwhelming majority, and the schism in the party,\r\nencouraged by the bestowal of all the patronage of the Federal\r\ngovernment upon the \"Hunkers,\" had become irreparable.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN A. Dix[13] TO S. J. TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"WASHINGTON, _January 2_, _1847_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Yours is received. I do not know whether I can have any\r\ninfluence in the matter referred to, but will bear your wishes in mind.\r\n\r\n\"Everything here is in miserable condition. I do not know whether\r\nMexico will make peace, but I am sure she would not if she knew what a\r\nstate we are in. Still I hope for the best. Mr. Polk is in a minority\r\nin both Houses. His most disinterested and reliable supporters are the\r\nfriends of those he has treated worst. I am sick of the whole concern,\r\nand, most of all, of the miserable manoeuvring for high place, which is\r\nbeginning to show itself.\r\n\r\n\"If we had a discreet and energetic leader in Mexico, I think we might\r\nbring the war to a close. But the lieutenant-general has been slain,\r\nand with him I think dies all prospect of success by arms or diplomacy.\r\nOur only chance is in luck, and Mr. Polk is so fortunate in getting out\r\nof scrapes just when he is most straitened that I am inclined to bet on\r\nhim yet.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours in haste,\r\n                       \"JOHN A. DIX.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST GUN FOR FREE SOIL\r\n\r\n  \"_April, 1848._\r\n\r\nAt the threshold of the Free-soil revolt of 1848, ex-President Van\r\nBuren, who was spending the winter in lodgings at Julian's Hotel in\r\nWashington Place, New York, said one day to Mr. Tilden, as he handed\r\nhim a roll of manuscript: \"If you wish to be immortal, take this home\r\nwith you, complete it, revise it, put it into proper shape, and give it\r\nto the public.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden replied that he had not the slightest wish to be immortal\r\nby any process that would impose upon him at that time any more labor;\r\nbut he consented to take the manuscript down to the residence of the\r\nex-President's son, John Van Buren, who then resided in White Street,\r\nand he agreed that if John would do half of the work he would do the\r\nother half. John did agree, and a few days after the interview referred\r\nto, Tilden and John met at the ex-President's lodgings to report.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren opened the subject by asking what they had done with\r\nNiagara Falls. This referred to a somewhat ambiguous metaphor which had\r\nfound its way into the ex-President's manuscript. \"We have struck that\r\nout,\" was the reply. He laughed, as if rather relieved at having an\r\nunpleasant duty discharged by other hands, while they went on to read\r\nthe result of their joint labors.\r\n\r\nAfter the address had received the combined approval of each party to\r\nits composition, the next question was how to get it before the public.\r\nAfter discussing various plans, they finally decided to issue it as\r\nan address of the Democratic members of the Legislature. Accordingly,\r\non the 12th of April, Senator John G. Floyd, from the committee of\r\nDemocratic members of the Legislature to prepare and report an address,\r\nread the paper to his colleagues, by whom it was unanimously adopted.\r\nThis memorable and epochal document was given at length in the _Public\r\nWritings and Speeches of Tilden_, Vol. II., page 537. This address\r\ndeserves to be regarded as the corner-stone of the \"Free-soil\" party,\r\nas distinguished from the party of unconditional abolition.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. P. CHASE[14] TO JOHN VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n  \"COLUMBUS, _June 19, 1848_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Many of our Free-Territory men in this quarter are in\r\ndoubt as to the course which the New York Democracy intend to pursue\r\nin reference to the Buffalo convention. Will they be represented in\r\nit? Will they concur in the nominations made by it? If Judge McLean\r\ncan be induced to accept a nomination for the Vice-Presidency, in\r\nconnection with Mr. Van Buren for the Presidency, will they cordially\r\naccept it? If the convention, on mature deliberation, should think it\r\nexpedient to nominate Judge McLean for the Presidency and Col. Samuel\r\nYoung or Bradford R. Wood or yourself for the Vice-Presidency, would\r\nthe New York Democracy concur in that nomination? There is a strong\r\ndisposition, also, in the West to drop the older politicians altogether\r\nand take younger men, who better represent the spirit of the time. One\r\nof the best and ablest Democrats in the State, I mean Edwin M. Stanton,\r\nsaid to me to-day that if John Van Buren should be the nominee of the\r\nBuffalo convention he would roll up his sleeves and go to work till the\r\nelection for the ticket; and I am sure that to all the young Democrats\r\nand all the young Whigs in the State your name would be more acceptable\r\nthan your father's. Suppose the convention should be animated by\r\nthis spirit and nominate men of this generation, would the New York\r\nDemocracy concur?\r\n\r\n\"I put these questions to indicate the various phases which the\r\nmovement may assume. My own opinion is that, under existing\r\ncircumstances, the best possible nomination for the Presidency has been\r\nmade at Utica, provided the name of John McLean can be associated with\r\nit. Whether it can be is, as yet, in doubt, though I fear the doubt\r\nwill be resolved against my wish. If it cannot be, we have no man in\r\nthe West whose name on the ticket would be altogether unexceptionable.\r\nIf Judge McLean should consent to allow his name to be used, the\r\nticket would undoubtedly sweep Ohio, and would gain immense accessions\r\nof strength throughout the West. I firmly believe that the nominees\r\nmay, in that event, be elected this year. It would be, to be sure,\r\nsacrificing a good deal on the part of Judge McLean, so long prominent\r\nin the regards of the people as a candidate for the first office, to\r\naccept a nomination for the second; and the bitterness with which he\r\ncould be assailed by the slaveholders and their allies would exceed\r\ngreatly that which is now manifested towards your father. Nothing but\r\na strong sense of personal duty, and a deep interest in the success of\r\nthe movement (and he avows that interest openly), will prevail on him\r\nto consent, and, I fear, he will not feel that duty absolutely requires\r\nthe step. It is probable that he would regard an offer of a nomination\r\nfor the first office differently. He would then be the recognized head\r\nor representative of the movement, and would feel the abuse directed\r\nagainst him, as levelled chiefly at the cause. And I think he would\r\nrepresent the movement almost exactly as Silas Wright would have done\r\nif living. I regard him as more nearly resembling Silas Wright in the\r\ngeneral character of his views on public questions than any living\r\npublic man. While, therefore, I repeat that if we can have Judge\r\nMcLean's name for the Vice-Presidency I would rather take the ticket as\r\nit would then stand--Martin Van Buren and John McLean--than any other,\r\nyou will not wonder that I regret that the action of the convention\r\nat Utica has interposed an obstacle to a different arrangement.\r\nWhether the obstacle is insuperable you are a far better judge than\r\nI am. If it be, then, we must take the Utica nomination, supply the\r\nVice-Presidential vacancy and make the best fight we can.\r\n\r\n\"You will have observed the difficulty suggested by the _National Era_\r\ngrowing out of the expressions in your father's letter, in relation\r\nto slavery in the District of Columbia; and you are doubtless aware\r\nthat all that part of the letter in reference to the course of his\r\nadministration on the subject of slavery is very distasteful to almost\r\nall anti-slavery men, whether Whig, Democratic, or Liberty.\r\n\r\n\"I wish that part of the letter could have been omitted. It does no\r\ngood to revive the past. Our business is with the present and the\r\nfuture. Your remarks in your speech at Genesee on the 20th of June are\r\nfull of truth. The Free-Territories question, in discussion, must bring\r\nup the whole slavery question inevitably. Our contest is with the slave\r\npower, and it will break us down unless we break it down. The people\r\nwill not stop with the exclusion of slavery from Territories: they will\r\ndemand its complete denationalization. Now many understand Mr. Van\r\nBuren's letter, so far as it touches upon slavery in the District, as a\r\nreiteration of his pledge to veto a bill for the abolition of slavery\r\nthere if enacted by Congress. I do not myself so understand it. I\r\ncannot believe that at the present day and under present circumstances,\r\nwhen a strong anti-slavery sentiment exists in Maryland and Virginia,\r\nwhich would be vastly strengthened by such a measure--so strengthened,\r\nindeed, that those States would by it be converted into free Territory\r\nStates--that he would interpose the slightest obstacle to its adoption.\r\nI cannot doubt that, on the contrary, he would give it every favor\r\nconsistent with the proper discharge of his function as President.\r\n\r\n\"So many, however, take a different view from mine that it is highly\r\ndesirable, in the event that M. Van Buren is to be the nominee of the\r\nBuffalo convention, to have all doubt on this matter removed, so that\r\nhe may be received and understood everywhere as a true representative\r\nof the movement.\r\n\r\n\"The uprising in this State exceeds all expectation, and if we only can\r\npresent a proper ticket at Buffalo we shall have the best chance of\r\ncarrying the State. But the effect of the movement is different here\r\nfrom its effect in New York. The question in this State will be between\r\nthe independent nominee and Cass. Taylor is, with us, entirely out of\r\nthe question. The people reject him, and the politicians support him,\r\nwhen they do at all, doubtingly and without enthusiasm. The Cass men\r\nare more active and with better hopes. In conversation with Judge Wood\r\nyesterday, or the day before, I remarked to him that I was a little\r\nsurprised, after reading of the interview between himself, Cass, and\r\nthe people at Cleveland, to hear of his advocating on the stump the\r\nclaims of Cass, as a Wilmot proviso man. 'Oh,' says the judge, 'He\r\nis for the proviso as much as any of us.' 'Do you mean to say, then,\r\nthat the Nicholson letter was designed to cheat the South and get the\r\nnomination?' I asked. 'D--n them,' said he, 'it is their _turn_ to be\r\ncheated.' This is a common argument among the Cass men; and as there\r\nis something like _retribution in kind_ indicated by it, it don't take\r\nvery badly among the people.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad to hear from you, and to be advised of the views\r\nof yourself and others, to whom you may show this, as to what is best\r\nto be done and the best mode of doing it.\r\n\r\n  Yours very truly,\r\n                        \"S. P. CHASE.\"\r\n\r\n\"P. S.--Did you or Mr. Preston King receive a telegraphic despatch, at\r\nUtica, stating the action of our people's convention, which adjourned\r\nthe day before your session commenced? We, Mr. Vaughan and myself, sent\r\none on the evening of the 21st, and it should have reached you on the\r\nmorning of the 22d at the latest. We shall be glad to know whether it\r\nreached you at all, and, if so, when.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO S. P. CHASE\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _July, 1848_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Your letter came here in the absence of Mr. J. Van\r\nBuren, which still continues, and it has been handed to me by Mr.\r\nBryant, with a request that I would answer it. I desire to do so\r\nwith perfect candor, and with as much accuracy as I can in regard\r\nto questions which depend upon the concurring action of numerous\r\nindividuals composing a large party.\r\n\r\n\"As to your inquiry whether the Barnburners of New York will be\r\nrepresented in the Buffalo convention, I can only say that so far as\r\nrepresentation consists in the presence of persons who will be asked\r\nto consult with the members of that body and inform them of the views\r\nof the Democracy, there will be no want of it. But representation of\r\nthe formal and authoritative character which is usual in the delegated\r\nconventions of organized parties will not be possible, either from\r\nthe nature of the convention itself or the circumstances in which\r\nthe Democracy of this State are placed. The convention professes to\r\nbe merely a mass convention, and does not aim at the indispensable\r\ncharacteristics of a delegated body--among which is a proportionate\r\nrepresentation of ascertained constituents, whose numbers and relations\r\nare already known; but it will be simply a voluntary assemblage of\r\nindividuals, whose relations to each other are to be for the first time\r\nestablished. Nor is there any person to act authoritatively for the\r\nDemocracy of this State, as an organized body, until the meeting of the\r\nUtica convention on the 13th of Sept.\r\n\r\n\"But all this is not deemed to be a matter of much consequence. The\r\nBuffalo convention must act with spontaneous harmony or it will fail\r\nof its objects, and the spirit of the people and the circumstances of\r\nthe occasion will be likely to make it very independent of forms. If\r\nit acts with wisdom, the Utica convention will doubtless concur in its\r\nnomination for the Vice-Presidency.\r\n\r\n\"As to the Presidency, it will not, under any circumstances, be\r\npracticable to change the position of the Democracy of this State.\r\nTheir convictions on this subject would be irresistible, whatever might\r\nbe the desires of leading men. Nominated, as Mr. Van Buren was, against\r\nhis wishes, and because he was believed to be the strongest candidate\r\nwith nearly all to whom they had a right to look for support, and\r\nacquiescing, as he did, on the ground that his old companions and their\r\ndescendants had a right to his name to strengthen them in maintaining\r\ntheir characters and cause amid the perils and difficulties which\r\nsurrounded them, it would not be decent towards him, now that more\r\nthan they at first hoped is sure to be accomplished, to seek another\r\nrepresentative. A still stronger consideration would be the bad faith\r\nof such a procedure towards large numbers of men and influential\r\npresses which have been drawn into our support of Mr. V. B.'s name.\r\nAnother would be the great impolicy of changing front on the eve\r\nof battle, when the public mind has adapted itself and individuals\r\nhave found relations with reference to the candidate. And another\r\nwould be the conviction that in this State at least his name is far\r\nthe strongest that can be presented with reference to practicable\r\naccessions to the cause. Of course this may be assumed to be the fact\r\namong the Democrats from whom our strength must mainly come--and the\r\naid we have derived from it has been very great--while those Whigs who\r\nare disposed to go with us prefer him to any other Democrat, if I may\r\njudge from their expressions to me and others before the convention of\r\nthe 22d of June.\r\n\r\n\"The Democracy of this State supports the cause and Mr. Van Buren, an\r\norganized party having more than fifty presses, many of which are the\r\nlongest established and most influential in the State, and are organs\r\non which perhaps the contest turns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR COLES TO M. VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n  \"PHILADELPHIA, _October 12, 1848_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Your very kind and flattering letter of the first\r\ninstant would have been sooner acknowledged but for my having had the\r\npleasure of having with me Mr. and Mrs. Singleton and Miss McDuffie,\r\nand also your son, the colonel, and Angelica, and since they left me I\r\nhave been so unwell as to be incapable of writing. And I am still too\r\nmuch indisposed to do much more than to express the gratification I\r\nderived from its perusal and to receive your commendation of my letter\r\nto Mr. Richards, which gave me the more pleasure, as I found my letter\r\nwould disappoint him and other friends from its treating on newspaper\r\nand common-place topics, accessible to all, instead of giving facts and\r\nanecdotes not generally known, and which had become particularly well\r\nknown to me, from the deep interest I have long taken in the subject,\r\nfrom my residence in Illinois at the period when efforts were made to\r\nmake it a slave-holding State, and from my intimate acquaintance with\r\nmost of the great men of the country. But I was sensible of not being\r\nable to do justice to the information I possessed, without a reference\r\nto documents not accessible to me at Schooleys Mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Your son John having requested me to send him a copy of a letter\r\nwritten by Mr. Jefferson to me in August, 1814, on the subject\r\nof slavery, and also a communication made by me to the _National\r\nIntelligencer_, and published in that paper Feb. 14, 1838, in relation\r\nto the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, I have since\r\nmy return home from my summer excursion enclosed them to him to 91\r\nWhite Street, New York, and hope he has received them, as I think the\r\nrepublication of Mr. Jefferson's letter at this time will do much\r\ngood.[15]\r\n\r\n\"In explanation of some parts of Mr. Jefferson's letter, I ought to\r\nadd that it was written in reply to one from me, informing him of my\r\nrepugnance to holding slaves, and my determination to leave Virginia\r\nunless I could see some prospect of abolishing slavery in the State,\r\nand urging him to step forward as the leader in the great work. He\r\nshowed our correspondence to many persons, and urged them to associate\r\nwith me and form what he called a phalanx for bringing forward the\r\nnecessary measures to put an end to slavery. Seeing no prospect of\r\nsuccess, I abandoned the State, restored to my slaves their liberty,\r\nand removed them to Illinois, where I have had the high gratification\r\nof seeing them free, happy, and prosperous.\r\n\r\n\"I have been too unwell to see and to deliver to our old friend, Mr.\r\nShort, your kind message.

GREELEY, THE LEGISLATOR, AND THE SLAVERY QUESTION[17]\r\n\r\n[_From the \"Evening Post,\" Dec. 23, 1848._]\r\n\r\n\"When we wrote our former articles on the bill of Mr. Douglass we had\r\nnot seen the letter from Mr. Greeley which was published in Saturday's\r\n_Tribune_ (Dec. 16, 1848). The intimation contained in that letter of\r\nhis sentiments and probable course in regard to that bill if presented\r\nin its original form, would not have been allowed to pass without the\r\nanimadversion which its extraordinary nature calls for, and which we\r\nshall now briefly make, not upon the impersonality which edits the\r\n_Tribune_, but upon Mr. Greeley, the legislator, who represents in part\r\nthe people of this city in the highest councils of the nation.\r\n\r\n\"When, after having professed to consider the extension of slavery to\r\nfree Territories as the question of questions involved in the late\r\nelection--after having for months exhorted all to treat it as far above\r\nthe other objects of party association, and reproached those who did\r\nnot so treat it as false to freedom--after having at first distrusted\r\nthe noble band of Democrats who proclaimed their determination to\r\nmaintain throughout the canvass and at the polls the sentiments which\r\nthey had before professed, taunted them with the prediction that\r\nthey would ultimately surrender principles to a slavish subserviency\r\nto party, and at length applauded their constancy when it could no\r\nlonger be disputed; after having stigmatized as recreant to principle\r\nand duty all who should support a candidate for the Presidency not\r\navowedly in favor of the Wilmot proviso; after having denounced General\r\nTaylor as identified in interest and association with the slave power,\r\nand probably unsound in principle on the greatest of issues; when,\r\nafter having done all this, the editor of the _Tribune_, on the eve\r\nof election, announced his intention to support General Taylor, to\r\nvote for a man because he was available, whom he had denounced for\r\nthat very reason when nominated as an available; to vote for a man\r\nbecause he would beat Gen. Cass, whom he had denounced when nominated\r\non that express ground; to vote for a man whom, after three months of\r\nnice balancing, he found to be a shade less objectionable than another\r\ncandidate, because it was necessary to make a choice of evils between\r\nthe nominees of the two old party organizations, no matter how wrong\r\nand dangerous the principles of both might be; thus surrendering the\r\ngreat question of freedom in the Territories, in the same manner and\r\nfor the same reasons, for which most of the supporters of Taylor and\r\nCass at the North professed to surrender it, and uniting with them in\r\npresenting the miserable spectacle of a number of electors sufficient\r\nto choose the President, all voting for men not representing their\r\nsentiments on a question professedly regarded by them as the most\r\nimportant, because there was _no chance_ of electing one who did\r\nrepresent those sentiments; when, in a word, after all his former\r\nprofessions, Mr. Greeley ended in doing precisely what the original\r\nTaylor men and the Cass men of the North did, and for precisely the\r\nsame reasons, and addressed to others precisely the same arguments\r\nwhich had been so long addressed to him in vain, and which he had\r\nbeen so long refuting, he shook deeply--very deeply--the confidence\r\nin his sincerity which his apparent zeal in behalf of freedom had\r\ninspired. For our part, we were inclined to take a charitable view of\r\nhis conduct. We thought we saw him struggling in the meshes of party\r\nassociation, and yielding not until he had half satisfied his own\r\nconscience that he could vote for Taylor as not so certainly declared\r\nas Cass, and therefore not quite so objectionable on the great issue,\r\nand at last reconciled to himself by the general sense that it was\r\na little better that Taylor should be elected than Cass. We thought\r\nwe saw a painful conflict with his self-respect and his sense of\r\nconsistency--a consciousness that he had not chosen the nobler, even\r\nif the more expedient, part--that he was doing at best a doubtful act\r\nagainst which his better nature revolted. We are disposed always to\r\nrespect, in silence, such manifestations, and not to reproach.\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we think, what shall we say, of the spirit exhibited\r\nand the sentiments expressed in the following passage of Mr. Greeley's\r\nletter, which we have read with astonishment and regret:\r\n\r\n\"'... And now to revert to the main question--the organization\r\nof the new Territories, and the allowance or disallowance of\r\nslavery therein--I have been confidently hoping for an _early and\r\npeaceful adjustment of the whole vexation_. The bills of which Mr.\r\nDouglass, in Senate, gave notice on reaching this city--to provide\r\nfor the organization of California as a State and New Mexico as a\r\nTerritory--were _signs of promise_. Upon the basis here suggested,\r\nit _seemed to me practicable to settle the whole difficulty without\r\nfarther excitement or peril_. I thought we should ultimately agree to\r\npermit _New Mexico_, as well as California, to take the requisite steps\r\nfor organizing as a State, and _bring them both into the Union in the\r\ncourse of the next two years_, leaving them _free_ to frame _their\r\nown institutions_. This done, the North would be morally certain that\r\nslavery would not be tolerated in either State, and the South would\r\n_save the point of honor by the almost certain defeat_ (in Senate) _of\r\nthe Wilmot proviso_, which, to an established and admitted State, is\r\nconfessedly inapplicable. And thus would _close the grave of agitation_\r\nwith regard to slave territory.'\r\n\r\n\"And the letter then proceeds to say that 'the bright sky has been\r\novercast' by the modification by which it is proposed to annex the\r\nportion of New Mexico east of the Rio Grande to Texas, which is _stated\r\nas the only objection to the bill_.\r\n\r\n\"The first remarkable thing in this letter is the spirit in which it\r\nspeaks of the question of extending slavery to the Territories now\r\nfree. If the only thing to be done was to get rid of a troublesome\r\nquestion, Mr. Greeley's mind would seem to be directed exactly to the\r\nobject. If the writer were one of the conservatives of the Syracuse\r\nconvention of 1847, who laid the Wilmot proviso on the table, or one\r\nof the Whig Dough Faces of the Philadelphia convention, who 'kicked it\r\nout' of that body, the terms in which the measure is spoken of would\r\nbe very characteristic. To adjust 'the whole _vexation_'--'to settle\r\nthe whole difficulty _without farther excitement or peril_'--'to _close\r\nthe grave_ of the _agitation_,' was precisely what _they_ desired to\r\ndo. But if there is something more to be done than to evade this great\r\nquestion in order to save party arrangements from embarrassment--if\r\nit is of any importance to make freedom in the Territories _certain_\r\ninstead of leaving it to chance--if the opinion, which has been so\r\nfrequently and earnestly maintained by Mr. Greeley, as well as all who\r\nprofess to be friends of freedom, that for this purpose an express\r\nenactment by Congress ought to be made, be not an utter imposture and\r\nfraud, then we submit that the spirit manifested in this letter is not\r\nthat in which this great question should be treated.\r\n\r\n\"The second remarkable thing in the letter--and by far the most\r\nremarkable--is the _mode_ in which it purposes to adjust 'the whole\r\nvexation.' A Territory extensive enough to make thirteen States as\r\nlarge as New York has been acquired; it is wholly unoccupied, except by\r\na small population in a few localities. The question is, shall slavery\r\nbe allowed to be established in it during its territorial condition?\r\nNeither party to the controversy regards as of practical moment the\r\nterritorial condition, except as it will influence and practically\r\ncontrol the conditions, in this respect, of the States which are to\r\nbe formed out of the Territory. And it is gravely proposed at once to\r\ndeclare this Territory, which is in no proper situation to be formed\r\ninto States, and which nobody would think of forming into a State\r\nnow except for the purpose of getting rid of the necessity of acting\r\non this subject, to be a State. And this is called by Mr. Greeley\r\n'_settling_,' instead of _dodging_, the question!\r\n\r\n\"Gen. Cass proposed, in his Nicholson letter, to leave to the\r\nscattered inhabitants who are to be found in some small portions of\r\nthis vast region to decide the question by a territorial legislature.\r\nMr. Greeley, in _his_ letter, proposes to leave it to precisely the\r\nsame individuals 'free to frame their own institutions' by a State\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\"What essential difference is there between the two plans, so far as\r\nthe extension or restriction of slavery is concerned?\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that on the 3rd of March next, at the close of the session,\r\nMr. Greeley's plan should be adopted; that on the 3rd of July a\r\nterritorial legislature should be elected; and that on the 3rd of\r\nSeptember it should meet and adjust the 'whole vexation.' Or suppose\r\nthat on the 3rd of March Gen. Cass's plan should be adopted; that on\r\nthe 3rd of July a State legislature should be elected; and that on the\r\n3rd of September it should meet and decide the question.\r\n\r\n\"Would it be important whether the government were called 'State' or\r\n'territorial,' so long as it had equal power to act on this subject,\r\nand constituents and representatives were the same, assumed their\r\nfunctions at the same time, in the one case as in the other? Would it\r\naffect in the slightest degree the actual extension or restriction of\r\nslavery which should be decreed by them?\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Greeley evidently thinks that this little change of names gets\r\nhim over the whole difficulty. And he touches what he obviously regards\r\nas the point of the case when he adds that 'the Wilmot proviso' is 'to\r\nan established and admitted State' confessedly inapplicable.\r\n\r\n\"Without discussing the authority of Congress to insert a restriction\r\nagainst slavery in the act of admission, which was done with most of\r\nthe Northwestern States, it is true that _after_ a State has been\r\nestablished and admitted the Federal legislation has no power to apply\r\nto that State the 'Wilmot proviso'; and that by the unconditional\r\nconversion of a territory into a State Congress divests itself of that\r\npower. But it is not easy for anybody--except Mr. Greeley--to see\r\nhow the reference of the question, even when confessedly within its\r\njurisdiction to a territorial legislature, as proposed by Gen. Cass,\r\nis more objectionable in a moral point of view than the voluntary\r\ndivestment of that jurisdiction for the very purpose of shirking off\r\nthe question upon the same legislature called by a different name. Gen.\r\nCass's plan has some advantages over that adopted by Mr. Greeley.\r\n\r\n\"It is less evasive and more manly, frank, and honest.\r\n\r\n\"It may afford some chance that the fate of the various parts of this\r\nimmense tract of unsettled lands shall be decided by the people who\r\nshall at some future period inhabit them after they shall be organized\r\ninto distinct Territories, the more densely populated portions having\r\nbeen admitted as States; which might be somewhat better than leaving\r\nto a few thousand persons in Santa Fé and San Francisco to fix the\r\ndestinies of hundreds of thousands of square miles in which not one of\r\nthese persons ever trod.\r\n\r\n\"Above all, it would not, in the miserable attempt to avoid the\r\nquestion of slavery in the Territories by admitting a State of\r\nboundless dimensions, incur the great and perilous mischiefs which\r\nwe have pointed out in our two previous articles, to the safety and\r\npermanency of the confederacy, and incur these evils without the least\r\nnecessity or any compensating benefit.\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Greeley says that 'the North would be morally certain that\r\nslavery would not be tolerated' in the States to be formed. So said\r\nGen. Cass in his Nicholson letter, when he proposed under a little\r\ndifferent name to leave the question to be settled by exactly the\r\nsame persons. So said Mr. Buchanan. So said Mr. Clayton. Yet nobody\r\ndenounced their contrivances with more indignation than Mr. Greeley.\r\nTalk of the Cass 'juggle,' the Buchanan 'compromise,' the Clayton\r\n'trap'--the Greeley and Douglass juggle is worse than any of them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prostration of the Democratic party--whether by the defeat of\r\nGeneral Cass or by the conditions which procured his nomination, it\r\nis inopportune here to discuss--though a great disappointment to Mr.\r\nTilden, was, like most disappointments, good-fortune in disguise. It\r\ngave him the opportunity and provocation to devote all his energies\r\nand talents for the succeeding quarter of a century to his profession,\r\nduring which period of its service it rewarded him as the wisest of\r\nIsrael's kings was rewarded for his obedience--with fame and fortune.\r\nIn less time than he had spent in making himself a leader of his party\r\nin New York, he placed himself in the front rank of the American bar.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the year 1850 that Mr. Tilden leased his first office\r\nfor professional purposes after his admission to the bar. It was on the\r\nthird floor of what was then known as Jauncey Court, now replaced by\r\nmajestic banking-houses, on the south side of Wall Street, a few doors\r\nwest of William street. His landlord was Alexander Hamilton, Jr., one\r\nof the sons of President Washington's first Minister of Finance. Here\r\nis a copy of their agreement, followed by a bill of Tilden's personal\r\ntaxes for the previous year:\r\n\r\n\"This is to certify that I have hired and taken from Alexander\r\nHamilton, Jr., the office, consisting of two rooms, on the 3rd floor of\r\nthe Jauncey Court Building, and marked on a plan of said building No.\r\n1 (it being understood and agreed that if the above premises shall be\r\nrendered untenantable by fire, the rent shall cease during the interval\r\noccurring from the happening of said fire until the premises shall\r\nhave been repaired), for the term of three years from the first day of\r\nMay, 1850, at the yearly rent of four hundred and twenty-five dollars,\r\npayable on the usual quarter days.\r\n\r\n\"And I hereby promise, in consideration thereof, to make punctual\r\npayment of the rent in manner aforesaid, and quit and surrender the\r\npremises at the expiration of the said term, in as good state and\r\ncondition as reasonable use and wear thereof will permit, damages by\r\nthe elements excepted, and not to assign, let or underlet the whole\r\nor any part of the said premises, or occupy the same for any business\r\ndeemed extra-hazardous on account of fire, without the written consent\r\nof the landlord, under the penalty of forfeiture and damages. And I do\r\nhereby, for the consideration of aforesaid, waive the benefit of the\r\nexemption specified in the first section of the act entitled 'An act\r\nto extend the exemption of household furniture and working tools from\r\ndistress for rent and sale under execution,' passed April 11, 1842, and\r\nagree that the property thereby exempted shall be liable to distress\r\nfor said rent; and also, that all property liable to distress for rent\r\nshall be so liable, whether on or off the said premises, wheresoever\r\nand whensoever the same may be found.\r\n\r\n  \"Given _under my hand and seal this_         day of February, 1850,\r\n  in the presence of\r\n\r\n                                     \"SAMUEL J.

Mr. Geo. Law, who is the principal man in the Chagres line,\r\nand Mr. Wetmore, an associate of his in that enterprise, inform me that\r\nnothing of the kind has been connected with their line; and they agree\r\nin thinking that, although such a proposition was before Congress, it\r\ndid not pass. Mr. Brooks, who represents this district in the House of\r\nRep., and who is conversant with such matters, is of the same opinion.\r\nMr. Croswell, of Albany, _not_ of this city, who is interested in the\r\nChagres line, and whom I was fortunate enough to meet a few evenings\r\nsince, has the same impression, but referred me to young Mr. Worth, of\r\nthis city, as having something to do with a project for such a line.\r\nOn inquiry of that gentleman I find that he is not aware of any action\r\nof Congress on the subject; that the project is purely commercial, and\r\nthat it is so very immature that it can scarcely be deemed to have an\r\nexistence. This was for a line between this city and Vera Cruz. The\r\nlaws of the last session have not as yet been published, so that I\r\ncould not examine them. I am thus particular, because one gentleman\r\nof whom I inquired had an impression that such a bill did pass. While\r\nthere seemed to be very little definite knowledge, my conclusion is\r\nthat no such line has been authorized, but I shall keep an eye to the\r\nmatter, and communicate to you any information which may seem important.\r\n\r\n\"I found in a N. O. paper that the steamer _Alabama_ will make trips at\r\nintervals of about 20 days from that place to Vera Cruz. The news that\r\nreached you may have originated partly in this circumstance and partly\r\nin the pendency of a proposition, such as you mention, in Cong.\r\n\r\n\"It would give me great pleasure to aid Mr. Chase, in the way\r\nyou desire, so far as I may have power, if such a line should be\r\nestablished; though the thing is as yet so indefinite--and I am\r\ninclined to think will remain so--that I cannot estimate my ability to\r\nserve him.\r\n\r\n\"The friends of whom you inquire--Mr. Green, Miss Green, and Miss\r\nH.--are well and pursuing happiness ardently in their customary modes:\r\neach one pursuing his favorite phantom, the poet hath it, but I will\r\nnot apply to them the association that rises in my memory. There are\r\nobjects in life which are not phantoms--tho' little pursued, and not\r\nby many. I am tempted to seek for myself the gracious welcome that\r\nawaits the bearer of good-tidings by telling you that Miss. H. intends\r\nto leave here on a Southern tour in the latter part of Dec., and has\r\nsome thoughts, even hopes, of persuading her father to prolong the\r\nexcursion to Tampico. But do not flatter yourself too much. Wind and\r\nweather are not less uncertain on the Gulf than elsewhere, and even the\r\nsteady purpose and persuasive power that characterize our friend may\r\nnot prevail against every mischance.\r\n\r\n\"The change in the nat. adn. was as sudden and remarkable as you regard\r\nit. The policy of the gov. was a little modified by it, but on the\r\nwhole it was most striking as illustrating how quietly our political\r\nmachine works, even while the hands that seem--and seem only--to\r\nguide it are shifted. I do not share, to any considerable extent, the\r\napprehensions entertained or professed by many as to a dissolution\r\nof our federative union. I would not needlessly put its bonds to the\r\ntest. But I think they would prove stronger than is generally supposed;\r\nthat danger would bring upon the theatre of public affairs a higher\r\nclass of men than the holiday patriots who figure there in a season of\r\npeace--men who would represent the actual sentiments of the masses of\r\nour citizens, the serious, earnest purposes, now applied to private\r\nobjects, that would be turned to the preservation of the Union as an\r\nimportant, practical means to great public ends. The idea of American\r\nnationality--progress and destiny--is the master-thought in the minds\r\nof our people, and creates a tendency to unity in the govt. quite\r\nstrong enough. I have, too, a feeling--for it may be that, rather\r\nthan a conclusion of reason--on this subject, which some may call\r\nsuperstitious. I believe that the gradual amelioration and culture of\r\nour race is in the inevitable order of Providence. I see elements which\r\nhave been and are preparing our country to act a grander part than any\r\nhas hitherto done in this great plan. That part is to be wrought out,\r\nnot by an indolent repose on what our ancestors have ordained for us,\r\nbut by trials and sacrifices and earnest efforts to solve the great\r\nsocial and civil questions which necessarily arise in the experiences\r\nof a nation. It seems to me--but here I may read the sacred oracles\r\nnot aright--that the Union is an essential condition to the destiny we\r\nappear appointed to fulfil; and I believe it firm enough and strong\r\nenough to endure the conflict of social and political forces which is\r\ngoing on within its bosom. It will survive them all, working out what\r\nit can, and as far as it can, and casting off to a future period what\r\nit cannot now entirely work out.\r\n\r\n\"I resume my letter which has been in my portfolio unfinished for more\r\nthan a week. A current of affairs suddenly struck me, and swept me\r\non so incessantly that I have not before been able to return to it.\r\nYou must not infer, however, that I affect any special industry, or\r\nthat I am ordinarily so busy. My life has vibrated between a leisure\r\nin which I amused myself with books, and the greatest activity in\r\npubic and private affairs; and, if the last few months have been as\r\nengrossingly occupied as any part of it with professional and personal\r\nbusiness, I do not expect or desire it to be generally so hereafter.\r\nWhat has most exacted attention was temporary and occasional, and has,\r\nas yet, produced, and may produce nothing to me or to others, though\r\nlest such a confession excite too much pity for me I will add that in\r\nthe mean time what has cost me comparatively little trouble has been\r\nsufficiently fruitful. My disposition is not to permit merely private\r\nbusiness to engross me, nor to be in any of an unprofessional nature\r\nwhich creates anxiety. I have never been accustomed to surrender to it\r\nmy inner life, or to allow its cares to fill those little interstices\r\nbetween actual occupation which are instinctively given to, and\r\nwhich characterize our ruling habits of thought and feeling. There\r\nno doubt is danger, as the relations of business multiply around us\r\nand our enthusiasm for public objects is qualified or weakened and\r\nour sympathies often come back upon us as the chilled blood returns\r\nfrom the extremities to the heart, that what furnishes occupation to\r\nour activity without the trouble of seeking it and without making us\r\ninquire whether we choose it, will grow too much upon our attention.\r\nBut I desire to reserve something to better purpose--something to\r\nfriends and to myself, and possibly, if hereafter I can recall the\r\nenthusiasm of early years, with a share of its former strength and\r\nsteadiness, something to consecrate life by a sense that it has not\r\nbeen wholly given to objects so selfishly egotistical as are most of\r\nthose which we pursue. It is time for me to stop; for I am moralizing,\r\nwhen I began merely to exclude a possible inference that I have not\r\nleisure to care for the wishes and interests of my friends, and to\r\nassure you that I am always happier if I can serve them, and glad to\r\ntalk with them, as I now do, even if it be at such a frightful distance\r\nas, in this age of ocean steamers, railways, and telegraphs, to put a\r\nquarter of a year between question and answer.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote you a very long letter--I tremble to think I ever addressed\r\nsuch a missive to a lady--all full of finances and figures, on about\r\nthe first of October. I mention it lest it may have miscarried. I\r\nshould regret if you have failed to get the answer it attempted to your\r\ninquiries. I have hoped, and do hope, to hear from you in respect to\r\nit and its subject, if I can at all aid you. As a whole, it was not\r\nintended to be answered--as somebody said of his own speech--but I do\r\nlook for a reply; I hope it may be an early and favorable reply--to\r\nsome parts of it--as, for instance, that you are rapidly maturing your\r\nplan of changing your residence to this country, and that, at all\r\nevents, you are coming over here next spring. If you should say that,\r\nyou may take your own time for the statistics of the money-market and\r\nof money-making. Waiting patiently as I can for such an answer, and\r\nbegging you to present my best respects to Mr. Chase, I remain,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly, your friend,\r\n                          \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF DRAFT-LETTER, FULL OF \"FINANCE AND FIGURES,\" REFERRED TO IN THE\r\nPRECEDING LETTER\r\n\r\n\"There are, of course, the U. S. sixes, if you are content with so low\r\na rate of interest. The New York stocks are about the same. There are\r\nothers which are lower. If put to the choice myself, I should prefer\r\nbonds secured by mortgages on real estate, or, as we familiarly call\r\nthem, b. and m. at 7 p. c., which, with care, can be had, even in the\r\npresent plethora of money. There are also many varieties of bonds of\r\nprivate companies paying 6 or 7 p. c.; but, as a general rule, I should\r\ndecidedly prefer bonds and mortgages on real estate.\r\n\r\n\"There are also stocks of private companies. Many of the banks are\r\nearning 7, 8, 10, or even more per cent. But these stocks are at\r\nconsiderable premiums, and have risen much recently. They cannot be\r\nalways continuing on the ascending series. When a commercial depression\r\nshall occur these bonds will feel it more promptly and more deeply\r\nthan that of most corporations; their dividends will be reduced,\r\nthe premiums (which are equivalents for future, unearned, dividends)\r\nwill fall off; and you may lose more by this decline than you have\r\nrealized in the excess of the dividends over a fair interest. The\r\nsame remark is applicable to the few railways which pay very large\r\ndividends, although they are not so sensitive to the fluctuations of\r\ncommerce as the banks--in this as in the other case. The Delaware &\r\nHudson Canal Company--whose business is to produce and bring to market\r\nanthracite coal--has declared about 16 per cent. for the last four or\r\nfive years. The premium on its stock is now 50 p. c. That is lower\r\nthan it has been, because of special circumstances, while I think that\r\nthe next year's business will be better. The dividend is over 10 p. c.\r\non premium and all. I would rather risk the continuance of its high\r\npremium than in any other case of a railroad. I may say, any other\r\nsimilar case. There is a similar company which has just come into\r\noperation--a very solid concern--which we think will be at least as\r\ngood; its stock at a premium of 15 p. c. It is not so well known or so\r\npromptly marketable, and its stock is in a rather complex form, which\r\nit is expected to simplify next winter. It would be idle to say that I\r\nhave not great confidence in it, since I have transferred what I had in\r\nthe other to it, and have put in it more than the sum you mention in\r\nyour letter; but I should not like to have another person invest in it\r\nor any similar thing merely on my judgment; and, to do so on his own,\r\nhe ought to have more detailed knowledge than could be communicated in\r\nthis hasty letter. The claim is that its stock will not advance much\r\nfor the next 3 months--perhaps not for the next 6 or 8 months.\r\n\r\n\"There are also classes of ins., to some of which I have great\r\nobjection, but it would be futile now to discuss their merit.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to investments in private companies generally, I have\r\nsome observations to make. A very large proportion of one's means\r\nshould not be concentrated in one institution, especially without the\r\nmost thorough familiarity with its affairs. A wise selection between\r\nthem requires at any time special knowledge and individual judgment;\r\nand more so now than usually. The abundance of capital and low rates\r\nof interest causes high premiums to be given for the most productive\r\nstocks as well as the most ____ so that it is scarcely possible to get\r\nthem at prices [half a page is here utterly undecipherable] unless in\r\nspecial cases where the enterprise is comparatively new and unknown, or\r\nits real merits are not fully appreciated by the public, in which cases\r\nyou rely upon what you suppose to be superior information or judgment.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to add, in qualification of those general views, that I do\r\nnot mean that the market has reached its highest elevation. I think\r\nit probably has not; nor can I now see the particular time when, or\r\nthe particular event by which a change is to take place. We are not\r\nin a state of high speculative excitement; we appear to be tending to\r\nsuch a state, though causes may occur to check the tendency. But we do\r\nknow that--whether the present abundance of capital and prosperity of\r\nbusiness shall, temporarily, increase or not--we cannot expect them\r\nto continue for a very long period, _even to the present degree_. It\r\nis desirable to make your investment at as low prices as possible,\r\nin order to enhance your interest and have greater security against\r\npossible contingencies; but even this consideration may be so modified\r\nby peculiar circumstances that it is difficult to state an absolute\r\nrule applicable to all cases.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, your main interest is to find your money safe and\r\navailable when you come here, and are able to make a permanent\r\ndisposition of it on your own judgment. I am gratified to be able\r\nto believe that you have already secured an ample provision for the\r\nfuture--its reasonable tastes as well as its necessities--at a rate\r\nof productiveness which will give the greatest safety. Anything that\r\nyou can hereafter add to your income or capital would be really of\r\nvery slight importance to you, compared with what you now have. I do\r\nnot undervalue your fortitude and energy, or concede to own to the\r\nimpertinent advances of time, when I say that your chief care should be\r\nto avoid even the possibility of being compelled to begin anew the work\r\nof life--so far as the providing for its material wants can be called\r\nsuch--when, if the period most fitted for that purpose have not passed,\r\nthe years which have been allotted to it cannot be recalled. The\r\nadvantages of such skilful disposition of your means as are consistent\r\nwith safety--and such advantages there are--will be to be enjoyed by\r\nyou when you shall become--as I hope you soon may--a resident in our\r\ncountry. In the mean time, a deposit with the trust company seems to\r\nbe as good a temporary arrangement as you can make at your distance\r\nfrom the scene or as I can suggest in my ignorance of your particular\r\naffairs, wishes, and future movements. I need not add that any aid\r\nwhich I can give you in making this or any other disposition _of your\r\nremittances_ which you may prefer will be very cordially rendered. I\r\nshall be happy also to answer further inquiries and convey additional\r\ninformation, as far as can be done by correspondence; and shall hope to\r\ndo so more promptly than I have been able this time, and more briefly;\r\nfor without purpose to be very ____ I happen to have been visited by\r\nunusual concourse of people talking to me about all sorts of things and\r\nby a necessity of ____ my talk with you ____ very rambling and diffuse.\r\nI have had the ____ to read it over--with something of dismay that I\r\nshould ever have written such a letter to a lady, and I must beg that\r\nit be communicated to Mr. Chase, to whom, in truth, it seems mainly to\r\nbe addressed--and to all eyes but his remain forever a sealed book. It\r\nmight ruin all my prospects with less forbearing fair ones if it were\r\nsupposed there could be any risk of a similar epistle.\r\n\r\n\"If you should place a deposit, or otherwise temporarily dispose of\r\nsuch remittances as you may make through the winter, would not the true\r\npolicy be for Mr. and Mrs. C. to come on here for a short time, next\r\nspring or summer, to make more permanent arrangements? The journey\r\nis not much, and might be more than repaid by the business results.\r\nIf you could leave your affairs at home the trip might be useful in\r\nall respects. I have left myself little space for other topics. But I\r\nmust find room to say, in reply to the friendly message of Mr. Chase,\r\nthat I consider myself already, in some sort, acquainted with him,\r\nand to beg that he will not measure the little attentions I had the\r\npleasure of rendering to a lady who interested me, as well by her\r\npersonal qualities as by the situation in which I met her, by the\r\ndisproportionate sense of them which she entertains.\r\n\r\n\"I fear the probability of my being able to visit Tampico at present is\r\nnot sufficiently substantial to fabricate a dream of. My consolation\r\nmust be the hope of meeting you here, in which I trust you will not\r\ndisappoint me. The authority with which you commission me to 'say many\r\nkind things' to certain of your friends--if intended to be general--is\r\ntoo flattering in its conferment and too agreeable in its exercise to\r\nbe renounced. And yet I fear I should not be the 'faithful agent' you\r\nhope if I did not candidly admit how little, in this respect, you need,\r\nor can be aided, by any service of mine.\r\n\r\n\"Hoping to hear from you shortly, and to see you at an early period,\r\nand wishing Mr. C. and you every prosperity and happiness, I remain,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly, your friend,\r\n                                           \"----.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Letters from Tilden intended for Marcy were commonly addressed to\r\nMarcy's brother-in-law, Mr. Newell, who resided in Washington during\r\nMarcy's war ministry.\r\n\r\n[9] Twice Mayor of New York City.\r\n\r\n[10] Mr. Tilden on _Saturday_, after seeing Mr. Polk and delivering my\r\nletters, and perceiving a disposition to make the appointment finally\r\nmade, _wrote to me to come on to advise_.

It was my expectation to have gone to New\r\nYork about this time, but as I cannot, excuse my writing. My general\r\nviews and my peculiar position (peculiar for me) I very frankly gave\r\nyou, and also the attitude of things here when I saw you in June.\r\n\r\n\"Your convention is to me somewhat of a mystery, for I have seen no\r\none from your State to enlighten me, and there is no one in the region\r\nhereabout better informed than myself. Things have not taken, in all\r\nrespects, the course I could have wished and, indeed, expected, but it\r\nis not uncommon that we are controlled by circumstances rather than\r\ncircumstances by us.\r\n\r\n\"My object is to learn from you the course that the Democrats of your\r\nState will be likely to take in regard to the Presidential election.\r\nI need not say to you that whatever you may communicate shall be in\r\nstrictest confidence, and shall be submitted to no other eye or ear\r\nthan mine; but it may be of material benefit for you and for us in\r\nConnecticut if I can have some indication of the course which our\r\nfriends in New York intend to pursue.\r\n\r\n\"As I remarked to you when I last saw you, I found things in our State\r\nin a very unfortunate condition when I returned from Washington, and\r\nwhile I would not commit myself to the schemes on foot, I at the same\r\ntime did not think it expedient or useful to place myself in exactly\r\nan antagonal position to old associates and friends. I have therefore\r\nstood somewhat aloof--commenting on and criticising measures and men,\r\nto the great annoyance and disappointment of some, who thought it in\r\ntheir power to compel me to take a position as they had done by Niles.\r\n\r\n\"At this time the party in this State which supported Cass do not\r\nmention him. He seems to be dropped by universal consent. His leading\r\nfriends, the managers of what you call the Hunker party, are generally\r\ninclined to Buchanan, but the more efficient and active portion of\r\nthose who went with him are disinclined to take Buchanan, and, to\r\na considerable extent, avow themselves for Houston. I have been in\r\nexactly that position when I did not feel inclined to allay their\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time, within a few weeks past and since the death of\r\nWoodbury, some of the shrewd and cunning friends of Buchanan are\r\ntalking up Douglas. Without going into speculations on this matter\r\ngenerally, I can well perceive the local design and bearing which\r\nthose movements may have, and hence my desire to know something of the\r\nintentions and ultimate object of the real Democrats of your State, for\r\nit is desirable that we should harmonize.\r\n\r\n\"If I could make the next President, Col. Benton would be the man,\r\nalthough the old man takes occasionally strange freaks. In a late St.\r\nLouis _Union_ I read a strong article in favor of Buchanan, backed by\r\nan editorial equally strong which surprised me. I am no partisan of\r\nBuchanan, whose course on all recent questions appears to me extremely\r\nobjectionable, and, in fact, his career is not one that I admire\r\ngenerally. Cold, selfish, intriguing, and heartless, he panders to\r\nvicious doctrines; he is not a root-and-branch Democrat, and I always\r\ndoubt his sincerity. I should very much prefer Marcy, especially if he\r\ncould disentangle himself from a few bad associates. From some of the\r\nproceedings of your State convention, and a few odds and ends in the\r\npapers, I have been half inclined to think that some of Marcy's warm\r\nfriends threw their influence with the Barnburners, and defeated the\r\nextreme Hunkers. This is mere speculation of mine, without a word from\r\nany one, and made perhaps in the absence of any more obvious cause for\r\nwhat then occurred.\r\n\r\n\"In former years I was accustomed to get from Mr. Wright a letter or\r\ntwo annually that made my pathway clear, and his suggestions enabled me\r\nsometimes to do the cause efficient service. At this time I feel the\r\nnecessity of knowing something of the probable direction our friends\r\nin New York will take, and I must rely on you for hints, suggestions,\r\nand views. There is quite a disposition to talk up the Presidential\r\nquestion, and our active busybodies seem anxious to connect themselves\r\nin season; and without appearing intrusive or actually doing a great\r\ndeal, I am perhaps in just such a position as enables me perhaps to do\r\nmore active and substantial service than a much abler man, differently\r\nsituated. I therefore write to you as an old acquaintance, knowing that\r\nyou can give me light.\r\n\r\n\"Where is our friend Genl. Dix, one of your best clearheaded and\r\npure-minded men? I suppose things are in such a condition that he could\r\nnot be brought forward, but how infinitely superior to most of the\r\nmen named for Chief Magistrate.

Marcy had been Governor of New York from 1833 to 1839,\r\nand in 1852, as will be seen by the following letter, he was already\r\nindulging dreams of succeeding Mr. Fillmore at the impending\r\nPresidential election, which, however, resulted in the choice of\r\nFranklin Pierce. Mr. Marcy had too many friends like Van Buren and\r\nTilden and Dix and Flagg to be trusted at the head of the government\r\nby the partisans of slavery, while and because of those friends he was\r\nwanted in the Cabinet for his influence with those statesmen in New\r\nYork; but they took care to put him in the department where he would\r\nhave least occasion or opportunity to interfere with the policy of the\r\nslave-holding class.

As Lt.-Gov. Church does not\r\nstand entirely unexposed to attacks on account of the canal lettings,\r\nI think it would be quite agreeable to him to be selected as one of\r\nthe State delegates. Should his selection be pressed it may embarrass\r\nthe proceedings. I have information from Washington that Dickinson's\r\n_man_, Birdsall, is here exhibiting much bitterness towards me, and\r\nhas distinctly broke ground for Dickinson as a candidate. As he cannot\r\ncarry the State it will be important for his object, as it would be\r\nto Gen. C.'s friends, to create an impression that no one can carry\r\nit. He will therefore endeavor to get up a scene of confusion here at\r\nthe delegate meeting. Though I have no intimation on the subject, yet\r\nI do not doubt that he will propose a wholesale endorsement of the\r\ncompromise. If so, the blow must be skilfully parried.\r\n\r\n\"I also fear the Hunker delegates favorable to me will stiffly insist\r\non Hunker State delegates, but will go far to gratify the other section\r\nof my friends as to the particular persons.\r\n\r\n\"I allude to these things to enforce the request I make to have you be\r\nhere a day or two before the delegates meet if you conveniently can.\r\n\r\n\"If we can surmount the embarrassments which may arise in this matter,\r\nI flatter myself that our future course will be more smooth.\r\n\r\n\"I am inspired with confidence from the information I get from\r\nWashington that things, as they appear there, are not _worsening_ for\r\nme, and if the business at the delegate meeting is done as it ought to\r\nbe my prospects will be much improved.\r\n\r\n                               \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                   \"W.

It\r\nwould have reminded me, if I had forgotten, that I promised to write\r\nyou my views on the subject of our conversation when I last had the\r\npleasure to see you. I should have done so earlier, but engagements,\r\nwhich it is no exaggeration to call incessant, have left me no\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\"The preliminary question is, on what general theory is the new\r\nadministration to be formed? Is the Cabinet to be composed of those\r\nwho are commonly regarded as Presidential men--who were candidates for\r\nthe recent nomination--and are surrounded by the affiliations which\r\nnaturally grow up around those occupying that position? It seems to\r\nme that this would be attempting to stand steadily and firmly on a\r\nhalf-dozen different stools. The President might himself look after\r\nthe success of his administration, while his constitutional helpers\r\nwere thinking how each measure and each appointment would affect their\r\npretensions to the succession; or he might content himself with the\r\nformal honor of presiding over the councils of these heads of factions.\r\nBut, in my judgment, he ought to be--not what Victoria is in the\r\nBritish government, not a grand Elector, as Sieyès would have made\r\nNapoleon, not a mere chooser of the actual rulers--but the real and\r\nresponsible head of the administration. That he may be such, he should\r\nhave, as far as practicable, a Cabinet able to perform its duty towards\r\nhim, faithfully and effectively, and not inviting by the aspirations of\r\nits members internal dissension or external hostility. In the last term\r\nof an administration, it may be difficult to exclude pretensions to the\r\nsuccession. But why incur the embarrassments which they never fail to\r\ngenerate, during a first term, unless it be certain that it is also the\r\nlast! And is it to be now assumed that the Democracy will look from the\r\ncandidate through whom it solved the difficulties of a choice at the\r\nlast convention, and to candidates through whom it found itself unable\r\nto solve those difficulties? It is not clear that the party can, after\r\nso recent a disorganization--if it could under other circumstances--be\r\nsufficiently consolidated in a single term to be instrumental to any\r\ngreat public service. But it is clear what will become of the family\r\ndiscipline and how the farm will be managed if the old gentleman begins\r\nby announcing his own decease and inviting the boys to scramble for the\r\ninheritance. Polk tried that, secretly meaning all the while to be his\r\nown heir; and while he contrived and they scrambled, the inheritance\r\nwent to strangers. Let not Gen. Pierce content himself with being a\r\nloose and temporary bond of union between factions; but rather let him\r\naim to fuse those factions, and constitute a single, compact party.\r\n\r\n\"Now what is to be done with New York? Some will say avoid all\r\ndifficulties by taking no member of the Cabinet from that State. That\r\nwould be better than to do worse; and, if on due reflection it should\r\nbe deemed most expedient, I should not personally complain. But it\r\nis not a policy after my heart or my judgment; nor does it tend to\r\nconstitute a party out of the fused elements of factions. An evasion\r\npolicy, in such a case, is a feeble policy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, who then shall be taken? The public regard Messrs. O'Conor,\r\nDickinson, Marcy, and Dix as candidates; and therefore I may be\r\njustified in remarking upon them as such. The first two I shall not say\r\nmuch about, because I do not suppose their present relations to the\r\nprevailing policies of the State will make them regarded as admissible\r\nselections.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. O'Conor is a man of extensive and accurate legal learning, of\r\nan acuteness of reason somewhat excessive even for the higher uses\r\nof his profession--of great mental activity, indefatigable, vehement\r\nand sarcastic in controversy; remarked at the bar as able rather than\r\nwise, and remarkable for a want of tact. What these qualities--not\r\nweakened by a life almost exclusively forensic--would naturally\r\nmake him in politics, where they are not counteracted by the large\r\nknowledge, long experience, and settled rules and habits that modify\r\ntheir effects in his profession, and where the opposite qualities, the\r\npower, not of dissenting or contesting, but of moulding, constructing,\r\nand organizing, of determining one's self and representing others,\r\nare mainly required, may be imagined. Add inexperience in politics,\r\nvery limited acquaintance with its subjects, its questions, its\r\nhistory, its methods or its men--unsettled convictions, a tendency to\r\ncapriciousness, and as little as can easily be found of that capacity\r\nwhich enables a man instinctively to act with others or make them act\r\nwith him, and you have the political aspects of his character. Whether\r\nin personal judgment or action in politics, in administrative council,\r\nin a deliberative assembly, or in leading or aiding to lead a party\r\nof a nation or a ward, his destiny is to illustrate how little fitted\r\nto such purposes may be talents conceded to be eminent in a peculiar\r\nsphere. This opinion is the result of many years' observation. It\r\nwas confirmed when I was associated with him in the convention that\r\nformed the present Constitution of this State, and, in an intercourse\r\nconstant and never unfriendly, was a daily witness of the development\r\nof his characteristics. The partiality of his friends would not change\r\nthe nature, though it might lessen the degree, of this criticism. No\r\none has suggested him except as Attorney Genl.; and for that station,\r\nI presume, on the idea that its duties are purely professional. If\r\nthat office did not share in the general administrative councils of\r\nthe President; if, as a legal adviser, he were not required to look\r\nat the mixed questions that come up before him somewhat with the eye\r\nof a statesman as well as that of a mere lawyer--or at least with\r\nthe largeness and comprehensiveness of a judicial view; if he had no\r\nduty or utility beyond conducting the cases in the courts in which he\r\noccasionally appears for the United States, certainly there could be\r\nno objection to the personal adaptation of this gentleman, and, if\r\nthat member of the Cabinet from New York need have no relation to the\r\nmajority of the party there, which has the entire State government, and\r\nwhose ascendency is every day becoming more complete and solid, and\r\nbut a very ineffective relation to the minority, if he need represent\r\nnobody and be capable of representing nobody, such a selection might\r\nnot be injudicious as respects the Democracy of the largest State in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\"I ought perhaps to add a matter of information without going into\r\ndiscussion of political antecedents that in our great financial\r\ncontroversy from 1836-7 this gentleman was with the Whigs, and was not\r\nagain visible in our ranks until 1844.\r\n\r\n\"Inferior to either of the other gentlemen mentioned in general\r\nabilities and acquirements, and to either of them, except Mr. O'Conor,\r\nas a politician--and not strong with his State in any of his political\r\nantecedents--Mr. Dickinson has brought himself into his present\r\nunfortunate relations with a great majority of the party here by the\r\nextreme positions he has occupied on questions which have divided the\r\nState, and still more by the fatuity with which he has followed Judge\r\nBeardsley and Mr. Croswell in a policy which must have been fatal to\r\nthe party if it had not sooner been fatal to its advocate. I mean the\r\npolicy of resisting every attempt at an honorable or practicable union\r\nof the Democracy of the State--on the chance that, while the prominent\r\nmen of the section, which formed a majority of the whole and had many\r\nsympathizers from the rank and file of that section, could be made\r\nthrough the influence of association with the party in other States;\r\nand that, while the Democracy of the Union should take the risks of the\r\nexperiment, those who got it up would, at least, own the wreck. Fairer\r\nand wiser men saw that such an experiment in a party which rarely\r\ncommands a majority exceeding two or three per cent. of the aggregate\r\nvote, even if more successful than could be reasonably hoped for,\r\ncould have no result but to leave New York as thoroughly federalized\r\nas Massachusetts or Vermont for a generation to come. But the folly\r\nof the scheme was no less in its personal aspects. It mistook the\r\nsentiments as it underrated the sense of the masses of the party. They,\r\nas everybody ought to have seen, were in favor of a reunion on equal\r\nand honorable terms. And the attempt to resist it--which, if openly\r\nmade, would have been generally rejected--was sufficiently perceived\r\nto break the hold of its authors upon the masses of their own section,\r\nwho, although sometimes in a collateral question where old associations\r\nor prejudices could be appealed to showing a large minority have been\r\ndrifting from these gentlemen ever since, and many of them resuming\r\nrelations with the radicals with whom they formerly acted.\r\n\r\n\"Gov. Marcy and Genl. Dix both possess the important requisite of being\r\nof the union Democracy of the State, and are both capable of fulfilling\r\nthe duties of a Cabinet station with signal ability and distinction. I\r\nexpress my judgment between these gentlemen, not without regret arising\r\nfrom kindly personal disposition towards the one against whom that\r\njudgment, under all the circumstances, must be. But I shall state it\r\nfrankly, and briefly some of the reasons on which it is founded.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, in the first place, that the selection of Genl. Dix\r\nis most wise and right in respect to the mutual relations of those\r\nwho, acting generally with both these gentlemen, since the reunion of\r\nthe party in 1849, would be divided in preference between them. On the\r\nfirst nomination of Gov. Seymour, in selecting a State candidate for\r\nthe recent Presidential nomination--in choosing the two State delegates\r\nto the national convention on the renomination of Gov. Seymour--indeed,\r\non most of the important occasions since the reunion, the radicals,\r\nwhile constituting far the larger and more effective element of that\r\nunion, have conceded almost everything. The magnanimity with which\r\nthey have done so, and the fidelity with which they have carried out\r\nthe measures in which it has been done, have been strongly recognized\r\nby Gov. Marcy and his friends. These concessions have sometimes been\r\nnot without dissatisfaction at the extent and frequent repetition of\r\nthem; nor without large demand on the credit and patience of those who\r\nhave been the means of inducing acquiescence in arrangements, in which,\r\nwhile one side contributed most of the capital of the partnership,\r\nthe other received nearly its entire benefits. I feel some right to\r\nspeak on this point without suspicion that I am swerved by personal\r\nassociations from a fair judgment as respects all parties, as well from\r\nthe general position I have held on these occasions as from the part I\r\ntook in some of them.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be improper to mention an instance. When the two State\r\ndelegates to the national convention were to be chosen, Gov. Marcy, as\r\ndesiring to be presented as the State candidate for the Presidency, and\r\nGov. Seymour as a candidate before his own party the first time after\r\nhis defeat before the people, felt their fortunes very deeply involved\r\nin the result. Gov. Marcy wrote to me requesting me to attend the\r\nmeeting of the district delegates at Albany, and I did so. I never knew\r\neither of those gentlemen manifest more anxiety or having to confront\r\nmore serious embarrassments. It had been the settled understanding that\r\none Hunker and one radical should be taken for the State delegates.\r\nMost of the votes relied on to make the choice were radicals; and\r\nprominent men of that section, some of whom the radicals most desired\r\nto send, strongly wished to go. It seemed to Gov. Marcy necessary\r\nto take two Hunkers, but he felt the embarrassment of asking it,\r\nespecially on the grounds that could alone be rendered; and others, who\r\nhad to make the choice or were in firmer association with those who\r\nhad to make it, were not easily convinced of the necessity or propriety\r\nof such a course. The difficulty was at length solved by our passing\r\nour favorite men and assenting to elect Mr. Seymour and another Hunker.\r\nThose of us who have, on this and other occasions, felt the strain\r\nwith our own friends of keeping the elements of the union Democracy\r\nworking harmoniously and efficiently under such circumstances, have a\r\nright to be heard when we express the conviction that the present is\r\na fit time for Gov. Marcy and his friends to evince some mutuality in\r\ntheir relations towards the radicals; and that a more safe, proper,\r\nand unobjectionable opportunity to reciprocate the magnanimity with\r\nwhich they have been treated cannot be offered than in assenting to\r\nthe selection of Genl. Dix for the Cabinet. Such I believe to be the\r\ngeneral sense of those who have formed four-fifths of the majorities in\r\nour State conventions and elsewhere since the reunion of the party from\r\nwhich Gov. Marcy and Gov. Seymour have received support.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the question simply as it affects the party in this State,\r\nI think it highly desirable and important that the occasion should be\r\nembraced to manifest that mutuality towards the radicals without which\r\nthe elements of a party cannot be kept in cordial or lasting union,\r\nand I think that, on such a question, the general sense of fair men is\r\nmore wisely conformed to than disregarded. Certainly I do not mean to\r\ncensure Gov. Marcy for allowing his name to be presented, or that we\r\nhave any right or disposition to limit the range of selection by Genl.\r\nPierce; but simply to state considerations which, in my judgment, are\r\nimportant in deciding the choice.\r\n\r\n\"This brings me to the question how the party in New York, as a whole,\r\nstand affected as between these two gentlemen? The radicals, who are\r\na full majority in numbers and more in efficiency, are for Gen. Dix,\r\nand would, under the circumstances, feel some sense of exclusion\r\nin a choice of a different nature. Gov. Marcy and his personal\r\nfriends, though preferring him, cannot, as the case stands, make\r\nany actual opposition to the appointment of Gen. Dix; and, if it be\r\nmade, will acquiesce--most, if not all of them, with cordiality. The\r\nconsiderations I have alluded to appeal strongly to their judgment\r\nand sense of justice, if failing to change their wishes; and with the\r\nrelations which have grown up with many who are for Genl. Dix, secure\r\nthis result. The opposition of the extreme Hunkers to Marcy or Dix will\r\nbe most manifest towards the one appearing most likely at the moment to\r\nbe appointed; but I think that they are generally less repugnant to the\r\nselection of Dix, towards whom there is less of violence and bitterness\r\nin individual leaders. So far as this may be supposed to arise from\r\nthe part Gov. Marcy took in promoting the union of the party, I\r\nregard it as a merit; and for that, with a friendly construction of\r\nacts and motives, we have handsomely acquitted ourselves towards him.\r\nThis animosity has other causes, among which is that he has been in\r\nthe way of other gentlemen who have grown faster in their own esteem\r\nthan in his appreciation (in which difference I think he is more\r\nright than they); and especially that Mr. Dickinson regards him as\r\nhaving, by being a candidate for the Presidency, kept that distinction\r\nfrom alighting on fitter shoulders--which it is certain that Mr. D.\r\nconfidentially calculated the convention would find, after trying Cass'\r\nawhile, to be of exactly his own management.\r\n\r\n\"Looking to this State, therefore, I think the appointment of Genl. Dix\r\nwould be the most wise, expedient, and prudent, with his moderation\r\nand conciliatory conduct always, and conciliatory disposition, it\r\nwill prove generally satisfactory. Not that all can be pleased. Still\r\nless that a few impracticables in this city will be--who never have\r\nbeen for twenty years, when the party was strong and prosperous--I\r\nmean the leading spirits. Their idea of building up the party has\r\nbeen to exclude from it a majority as Barnburners, and the most of\r\nthe Hunkers as having traitorous sympathies and affiliations with the\r\nBarnburners; and, incapable of more than one idea at a time, they have\r\ncontinued faithful to this, until they have pretty much exhausted\r\nthe credit they acquired in 1848 with the masses of those who voted\r\nfor Gen. Cass; and have lost their influence in the organization of\r\nthe party even in this city, while their crotchets are not and have\r\nnot been shared in by a tenth of those who were nominally classified\r\nwith them. They may be safely disregarded. There will be no local\r\ndissatisfaction in this city arising from appointments, if those which\r\nare of a local nature be judiciously made. The truth is the divisions\r\nand factions which appear on the surface of our city politics are\r\npretty much confined to the petty leaders, and excite attention or\r\ninterest in but a very small portion of the masses. They are generated\r\nby the very large number of offices, contracts, and other objects of\r\ncupidity, municipal, State, and national, which are concentrated here,\r\nand perhaps in some degree by the stirring and heterogeneous character\r\nof our population. They always exist, and have little to do with any\r\nsettled general classification. Their effect is to render opinion and\r\nindividual character less influential than in the more natural and\r\nsound condition of the rural districts, and to make the organization\r\nof the party, always scrambled for to promote personal ends, a much\r\nless true index of the real sentiments of the party. So far as the\r\nrelations of the administration with the party in this city are to be\r\neffected at all by its appointments, assuming them, of course, to be\r\nintrinsically proper and reputable, it would be incomparably more by\r\nthe multitude of little ones than by the large. While the appointments\r\nhere should be made with primary reference to the honest and efficient\r\ndischarge of official duties, a judicious care should be had for the\r\nharmonizing and conciliating the entire party. The one or two which\r\nhave extensive subordinate patronage should not be surrendered to\r\nthe bigotry of clique or of individuals on the idea of a partition\r\nbetween factions, but should be entrusted to persons who have largeness\r\nof views, judgments, and local knowledge enough to administer the\r\nsubordinate patronage on the same principle on which the administration\r\nitself acts. With such a policy the disturbing causes will be reduced\r\nto a minimum and the party will move on in general unity and strongly\r\nascendant. I will venture what character I have for political judgment\r\nthat no perceptible obstacle to this result would be found in the\r\nselection of Gen. Dix for the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"There is another consideration in respect to that gentleman. He is a\r\nmodel of a Cabinet officer. Able, accomplished, and judicious, capable\r\nof doing a given quantity of work in a specified time, not having made\r\nhimself or been made a candidate for the Presidency, he will serve the\r\nadministration faithfully, and without aiming to control or manage it\r\nto personal ends; and being in nobody's way for the succession, with no\r\naffiliations formed to secure it to him, not looked to with any such\r\nview by those who present his name, he will draw on the administration\r\nno jealousies on that score from those who fear passive not less than\r\nactive rivals, and will not believe that Presidential ambition, once\r\nentertained, can ever be practically relinquished.\r\n\r\n\"To the force of all these considerations is opposed nothing but an\r\nalleged repugnance of the South or portions of it to Genl. Dix's\r\nappointment arising from his position in 1848. I do not suppose Genl.\r\nPierce will be disposed to, or can listen to, an objection of this\r\nnature, and I think it will be found to have as little real existence\r\nas it has cogency. Mr. Dickinson's friends thought before the last\r\nconvention that they should ruin Gov. Marcy by charging him with\r\nhaving allied with the Barnburners; but it rather proved an element of\r\nstrength, and the votes he received were, notwithstanding, from the\r\nextreme South. Our friends there, as elsewhere, wanted a candidate who\r\ncould win. Every man of sense, then, must see now that if the party\r\nwould maintain itself, it must do so by the same policy by which it\r\nregained the ascendency. The real difficulty in respect to the South\r\nwill be in composing their own dissensions, in which all sides there\r\nwill feel infinitely stronger interest than in any New York question.\r\nSuch an objection to Genl. Dix may be entertained by bigotry or the\r\nnarrowness of views of some, or more likely it may be the pretence\r\nof men dissatisfied on grounds interesting them personally. If this\r\npretence be wanting to such, others equally available will be found.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it be, the sooner the administration shall show that it does\r\nnot intend to reverse the policy which brought it into existence the\r\nbetter. Without a prompt, firm, and decisive course in this respect,\r\nwe shall have nothing--from cabinet minister down to tide-waiter--but\r\ndiscussions of past dissensions, which it is the policy and duty of\r\nGenl. Pierce, with all his power as the head of the party, to bury.\r\nIt is a case in which boldness is the highest prudence. If the party\r\ncannot be kept large enough to contain all the great divisions of it\r\nwhich have predominated in powerful States or sections of the Union,\r\nit cannot be kept in the majority. In the face of the certain results\r\nof any other system, I feel courageous in supporting this, on the\r\nprinciple on which Moreau said he rendered his soldiers brave--by\r\nmaking them fear more to run than to fight.\r\n\r\n\"Asked the other day by a Hunker friend if I thought it prudent to\r\ntake a man of Gen. Dix's class, I replied, most certainly to take one\r\nsuch. If past positions on the slavery question as it existed among\r\nDemocrats, are to be the grounds of a classification, it is proper\r\nand necessary to represent the divisions to which Genl. Dix belonged\r\nas well as others. Can it be done anywhere else as well as in New\r\nYork? He will be in line with the majority of the party and the entire\r\ngovernment in that State, which the minority of the party there, if\r\nthat classification be the criterion, will still be amply represented\r\nin other members of the cabinet, whereas if he be not taken, and the\r\nsection to which he belongs be not represented elsewhere, as we may\r\npresume it will not, the results will be regarded by the country as a\r\npractical exclusion of that interest.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be, therefore, desirable to take a man of Genl. Dix's\r\nrelations; and to take one or more of the States-rights Democrats\r\nfrom States in which they stand with a majority of the party, and to\r\nrepresent the other great interests, as there will be abundant room\r\nto do, in the rest of the cabinet. A strong administration cannot be\r\nmade by combining negations. If it be formed, as it should be, by men\r\nwho have a predominant regard to its unity and success, the more its\r\nmembers have of the confidence and favor of the interests and States\r\nthey are respectively taken to represent, the better. Of course I mean\r\nonly men of qualifications and character, and of fitness in these\r\nrespects and from their Democratic antecedents--and the objection to\r\nwhom is merely the part they had in the recent Democratic divisions\r\nNorth and South. Let unfriendly critics, if they please, call such a\r\ncabinet mosaic. If the joiner work be good, as I believe it may be,\r\nand the materials be of the right general character, I do not care how\r\nfirm the texture or strong the colors of the parts. It will dovetail\r\nthe party together for a basis on which the administration may stand\r\nsecurely. Certainly, I assume that in this there will be no violation\r\nof principle and honor to shock the confidence of the country. Those\r\nwho think there is, and have acquiesced thus far, might feel some\r\ndelicacy that their scruples arise for the first time when they are\r\nasking for themselves and on this ground a monopoly of the fruits of\r\nthe wrong. Restitution to the true owner would be more becoming. If\r\nthe party that elected Gen. Pierce be an alliance of those who cannot\r\nhonestly act together, it ought to be dissolved; but if it could\r\nhonestly unite, there can be no objection to proclaiming the intention\r\nto continue that union, or to carrying it out in the most effectual\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"At the late election, the large popular majorities as well as large\r\nelectoral votes were in the great States of New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nand Ohio. Notwithstanding the clamor about the identification of Scott\r\nwith Seward, the South did not do equally well, except in States where\r\npersonal antipathies to that interest or personal commitments of Whig\r\nleaders produced systematic defections. No administration or party can\r\nstand without the support of at least two of the great free States.\r\nAnd the conceded abandonment at the outset of the canvass of either\r\nof the two largest, especially if it be the first in electoral votes,\r\nand of metropolitan action or opinion, usually loses one or both of\r\nthe others. No man has been elected President against the vote of New\r\nYork in the six successive elections since it has been cast unitedly\r\nand by the people; nor, indeed, ever but in a single instance, the\r\ncircumstances of which scarcely constitute it an exception. Her vote\r\nhas been often an unnecessary addition to his majority--and a hopeful\r\ncontest for it would often enable the other States to do without her;\r\nbut it is not easy to measure the force of her conceded or apprehended\r\nloss, representing, as her population does, elements that affect the\r\nequilibrium of so many other States.\r\n\r\n\"The interest, headed by Gov. Seward, which nominated Scott, is a\r\npowerful minority in these great States. Carrying almost the whole\r\nWhig party against an existing Whig administration and the influence\r\nof the great Whig leaders, it may, as an opposition and surviving\r\nthose leaders, absorb the third party, now almost holding the balance\r\nof power, without disintegrating itself. It will be likely to try\r\nthe experiment. The defection from it last fall, tho' encouraged by\r\nthe commanding patronage of the administration and the name of Mr.\r\nWebster, was scarcely more than one--certainly not two--per cent.,\r\nand was confined to a few localities. If the previous State elections\r\nhad not practically decided the contest, that defection would have\r\nbeen inconsiderable. Hereafter, not only are these disturbing causes\r\nstilled, but it will have the cementing influence of a common\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\"The characteristics of this interest, in our State politics, have\r\nbeen profligate jobbing and reckless enterprise and expenditure. The\r\nonly effectual barrier to its predominance has been in the radicals.\r\nThey include the prominent men who, with Wright, Hoffman, and Flagg,\r\nfought all our great financial contests; and a majority of the masses\r\nwho maintained their measures, although large numbers of the latter\r\nwere--temporarily, as I believe--detached by the divisions of 1848 and\r\nbound with the opposite interest about half of the entire party. While\r\nthe questions on which they separated were occasional and temporary,\r\nquestions of honest financial policy and administration are ever\r\npresent. Indeed, in our time the chief political duty seems to be to\r\nprotect the people from plunder under the forms of legislation and in\r\nthe abuse of administration.\r\n\r\n\"On all these questions, as well as doctrines of States'-rights,\r\nfree trade, and in most general views of government, the radicals of\r\nNew York (as I should have remarked while speaking of the relations\r\nbetween them and the State-rights Democrats of the South in a composite\r\ncabinet) sympathize with the radical Democracy of the South; and,\r\nindeed, are the only unflinching coadjutors the latter have had in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\"Agreeing in what is the only safe reliance of constitutional rights,\r\nas well as the cardinal point of the Democratic faith--embracing, as\r\neach does, the flower of the Democratic youth, enterprise, and energy\r\nin its own region--without discussing individual views of the course of\r\neither, antecedent to the general reunion of the party, and admitting,\r\nif you please, that they are somewhat alike in the boldness with which\r\nthey maintain their opinions, and repel aggressions on what they deem\r\nto be their rights--it is obvious that there are points of sympathy\r\nbetween them which make it easy and natural for them to fraternize,\r\nwhen out of the presence of any immediate course of difference, as they\r\ndid all through the late Baltimore convention and in its result.\r\n\r\n\"The radicals of New York include as much talent, courage, enterprise,\r\nand fearless devotion as can be found in any party. They have the\r\nadvantage of being, on an average, half a generation younger than the\r\nother. These circumstances, as well as those I have before mentioned,\r\nmark them as the future of the Democracy of New York. Since Silas\r\nWright's death they have given their affections to no providential\r\nman. They fell into the support of Genl. Pierce with alacrity at the\r\nconvention, and with generous enthusiasm in the canvass, because they\r\nrecognized in him qualities in common with those of their lamented\r\nleader, attested as well by the warm regard generated between them\r\nin former years by mutual sympathies, as by the whole career of the\r\nsurvivor.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of mere party calculation, I do not think it wise, with\r\nreference to the reconstitution and reconsolidating of the party on a\r\ncomprehensive basis, to leave them the only large and powerful class\r\nnot represented in the cabinet; nor, in undertaking to represent\r\nthem, to pass over a statesman of great merit and in all respects\r\nunobjectionable, unless because he is one of their number. The\r\nadministration will, I believe, ensure their support by its principals\r\nand measures. But looking to the condition of domestic politics, in\r\nNew York and the other great States on which the strength of the\r\nparty mainly depends, I do not think it would be a mistake to add\r\nthe cordiality that comes from a sense of equality and reciprocity\r\nin party relations and the energetic and efficient co-operation\r\nwhich will result. There are other considerations, but my letter has\r\nalready reached an unconscionable length, my apology for which is,\r\nthat writing my thoughts as they arose while writing they would not\r\nstop, and I could not--I have set them down frankly, not without some\r\ndelicacy, at seeming so much to advise, but remembering that nobody\r\nneed follow, while I would be unwilling to mislead. If I can contribute\r\nany information or suggestion to the general stock which you have\r\na right to advise, and He whose province it is to judge must needs\r\ngather from all quarters, my end will be attained. I am too sensible\r\nof the difficulties of filling up a cabinet on principles which seem\r\nessential, or any general principal and at the same time securing\r\nthe highest individual fitness, worth and weight and a reasonable\r\nconcurrence of our friends in the various localities,--to be willing to\r\nincrease them. A just and firm policy will solve them, as nearly as is\r\never attainable in such cases, to the satisfaction of the country. With\r\nthe best wishes of one who may speculate safely because he is without\r\nthe responsibility of acting--and who, except as a citizen, a Democrat,\r\nand a friend of the new administration, has, and can have, no interest\r\nin the result, though not exempt from the influence of sympathies of\r\nopinion and association in attempting to take a fair view,\r\n\r\n  \"I remain truly your friend,\r\n                (Signed) \"S. J. TILDEN.\"[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO FRANKLIN PIERCE\r\n\r\n                             \"HARRISBURG, _Feb. 23d, 1853_.\r\n  \"_Confidential._\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--A little matter of business, which called me here for\r\na day, has brought me again in contact with Gov. Bigler, and his\r\nimpressions are so strong on a point I casually mentioned to you\r\nin New York that I think it not improper to repeat his suggestion\r\nmore formally. It is that, in case you have decided to take Mr.\r\nCampbell[20] into your cabinet, you should, if practicable, put him in\r\nthe Interior or Navy, rather than the Post-Office. The Gov. says the\r\nCatholics are very numerous in this State--enough to make it probable\r\nthat, in many instances, they may become candidates for appointment\r\nas postmasters--and enough to awaken little neighborhood jealousies\r\nrespecting them. He deems it undesirable that Mr. C., as the head of\r\nthe department, should be called upon officially to decide on these\r\ncases, and be exposed to the suspicion of appointing from religious\r\npartiality, or to the necessity of doing injustice in order to avoid\r\nthat imputation. It is worth considering whether these views have not\r\nmore force than your own observation in the different condition of\r\nthings existing in New England would induce you at first to give them.\r\nIn expressing them, the Gov. can have no motive but the welfare of your\r\nadministration and of the party here, and his observation of the state\r\nof opinion here is entitled to a consideration. He seems to entertain\r\nthese ideas so strongly, and so much to _desire that they shall_ be\r\npresented to you, that I take the liberty of drawing your attention\r\nonce more to them;--not to press them upon you, but that your mind may\r\npause upon them and take their exact measure before you conclude the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure that my engagements will permit me to be in Washington\r\nat the inauguration; but I hope, at any rate, to have the pleasure of\r\nseeing you soon after.\r\n\r\n                           \"With great respect,\r\n                                            \"I remain, truly,\r\n                                                           \"Your friend.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_His Exy. Franklin Pierce_.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here a continuation of suggestions which Mr. Tilden felt called\r\nupon to present to President Pierce to guide him in his dispensation\r\nof his patronage in the State of New York. It makes one sad to think\r\nwhat an opportunity was lost by this President, and through him by the\r\ncountry, from his failure to see the wisdom of this advice and to adopt\r\nit. Had Mr. Pierce respected the public opinion of the State of New\r\nYork and properly recognized the political sentiments and sympathies of\r\nthe majority there, as he did in the Southern States, the presumption\r\nis that the Nullification party would have been as effectually disarmed\r\nunder his administration as it was by President Jackson a quarter\r\nof a century before. Franklin Pierce, however, was a different man\r\nfrom Andrew Jackson, and the conditions under which he received his\r\nnomination did not leave him a free agent.\r\n\r\nIt was only at this stage of Pierce's administration that Tilden began\r\nto indulge in the deplorable error of walking by sight and not by\r\nfaith. He did not believe, nor did he ever again seem to comprehend,\r\nthat in the slave States all other questions even the Constitution of\r\nour government and the integrity of our territory, were subordinate\r\nthroughout the South to the preservation and extension of slavery; that\r\nevery person who ventured publicly to express a doubt of the wisdom of\r\nallowing slavery to extend to the free Territories was pronounced there\r\na _suspect_, and was proscribed as a person who tainted every one who\r\nassociated with him politically. The Nullifiers saw, and saw correctly,\r\nthat the anti-slavery sentiment could only be resisted in America as\r\nheresy was resisted by Louis XIV. in France--by crushing the heretics\r\nor driving them from the country. To reason with Pierce in favor of\r\ndispensing his patronage in the State of New York in accordance with\r\nthe public opinion of the State, was as idle as the lambs reasoning\r\nwith the wolf in the fable.\r\n\r\nThe following notes, though without address, were without doubt\r\nprepared by Tilden and addressed to Pierce or to some one for his\r\nperusal. By the paging of the MS., it appears that thirteen pages,\r\nwhich have not been found, preceded those which are here submitted to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE ALLOTMENT\r\n\r\n[OF OFFICES UNDER THE PIERCE ADMINISTRATION]\r\n\r\n\"The Collectorship, the Sub-Treasuryship, and in a less degree the\r\nNaval Office, have State as well as city aspects. I have therefore set\r\ndown the Secretary of State and the foreign missions in connection with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Considered in a State aspect, see how much more the Hunkers (Hard and\r\nSoft) get, in every view of this allotment, than the Barnburners, who\r\nare more than equal in numbers and power to both of them united.\r\n\r\n\"Considering the Collectorship singly in that aspect, the same result\r\nis obvious.\r\n\r\n\"Be not misled by the apparent predominance of the Hunkers in the city.\r\nUp to the moment of the schism in 1848, the Radicals had five-sixths\r\nof the masses and nearly the whole party organization. Their old\r\nassociates have been returning to them ever since. In 1851 the Radicals\r\nhad a majority of the delegates to the State convention, and there\r\nwas but a small majority against them in the General Committee of\r\nthat year. At the last election of General Committee in 1852, they\r\ncarried a majority; and at the last trial in the Tammany Society their\r\nmajority was five to one. I grant that a large majority of the party\r\nwent for Cass in 1848, but I do not think a majority are now in the\r\nleadership of Schell, Sickles, etc., or included in the distinctive\r\nclass of Hards. I entertain no doubt whatever, if the appointments are\r\nsuch as not to affect the question anyway, the Radicals will remain in\r\npermanent possession of the organization. The truth is that four-fifths\r\nof the rank and file follow the organization, by whichever leaders it\r\nis wielded. All this, however, is matter of opinion; I do not claim\r\nfor it the assent of your judgment, although I have never been known\r\nhitherto to over-calculate the strength of those among whom I belong.\r\n\r\n\"But permit me to say that this point is below the importance and\r\ndignity of the general question before you. The most controlling\r\naspects of the case are State aspects and general aspects. If you vest\r\nthe most powerful and influential trust in the State of New York in a\r\npolitician of the most vulgar sort--or narrow views, prospective in all\r\nsave the promise by which that trust is secured, a schemer for personal\r\nends by desperate and fraudulent means, that almost revolted the party\r\nat the last election--nay, if you fail to take most ample and certain\r\nguaranty against the predominance of any such influence, in the known,\r\ntried, and elevated character of the man you select, your appointment\r\ncannot fail to be discreditable and disastrous in its results. You\r\nshould rest that corner of your administration on the sense and moral\r\npower of the community, by an appointment which should appeal to them,\r\nand draw approval from all disinterested persons. Do this, and you will\r\nrise above the altitude of mere politicians; and no disaffection which\r\ntheir disappointments will create can raise a ripple on the surface.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other consideration. I have recounted to you on a\r\nformer occasion the series of surrenders by the Radicals to the\r\nSofts through which the Union movement of the New York Democracy has\r\nbeen thus far carried on. I could not adequately express to you the\r\npainful personal embarrassments by which its recent steps have been\r\nmarked--the embroiling of old personal relations--and the difficulties\r\nwith which it has been achieved. These were our main motives to ask in\r\nthe selection of a Cabinet officer from New York some recognition of\r\nthe radicals. Again they yielded, and they have looked forward to the\r\nmost prominent local appointment in the State as a case in which what\r\nthey felt to be justice--long deferred--would be accorded to them. The\r\nimpression--whether well or ill founded--has existed that such would be\r\nthe course of things. I confess that I have shared in that impression.\r\nInstead of there being any cause for shrinking or hesitation, I think\r\nthe occasion ought to be _desired_ to fulfil an expectation so right\r\nand reasonable. I clearly think that it is needed. I know I speak the\r\nsentiments of the strong men among the radicals when I say that the\r\npersonal interests, desires, or gratification of Gen. Dix, or any other\r\nman whom they have honored, are as dust in the balance in the true\r\ngravity of this question. I believe Gen. Dix is the last man who would\r\ndissent from this opinion. At any rate, I take the responsibility of\r\nexpressing it in the name of all his supporters.\r\n\r\n\"A clear, conspicuous recognition, in a case in reference to\r\nwhich expectation has [been] excited, and which concerns more\r\nthan the gratification of a single individual, is what is needed.\r\nThe controlling men of the radicals in all parts of the State are\r\nindependent men--in condition as in character. They are weary with\r\ndebating questions of their own equality with the rest of their\r\nparty. They have not proposed to proscribe anybody. The question has\r\nconstantly been whether they should be proscribed. They do not rely on\r\ninstructions contrary to the disposition and whole anterior conduct\r\nof the individual intrusted with the power. Such reliance would be an\r\nillusion inconsistent with all ordinary experience; and a choice which\r\nshould imply it will utterly fail of inspiring confidence or producing\r\nany valuable effect.\r\n\r\n\"The programme should be accomplished to this actual condition of facts\r\nand sentiments.\r\n\r\n\"It is with a clear sense and earnest feeling outrunning my power of\r\nadequate expression, in the haste in which I write, that I put you in\r\npossession of these ideas. I do so only because I think I comprehend\r\nthe case better than can easily be done from a distance; and because\r\nI deem it important that you should be appraised of the sentiments of\r\na powerful class on which the success of the administration, so far\r\nas New York is concerned, largely depends. A desire that you should\r\ndo what is wise for it and for yourself is not less my motive than a\r\ndesire that you should be just to the class to which I myself belong.\r\nI confide entirely in your disposition to do what is fair and right to\r\nall; and have a grateful sense of the kindness and consideration with\r\nwhich you have treated me personally. These very sentiments impel me to\r\naddress you with earnest frankness in respect to a matter, a mistake in\r\nwhich cannot, in my judgment, be easily, if at all, retrieved.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly,\r\n          \"Your friend,\r\n                    \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. VAN BUREN TO ISAAC FOWLER, POSTMASTER OF NEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Mch. 21st, 1853_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FOWLER,--Yours of yesterday is recd., and I have read it to\r\nKennedy and Waterbury, who have started to get letters--they feel\r\nconfident that the Mayor will write; Dix is at Rye, but has written,\r\nI think, to Tilden. Havemeyer writes for nobody this day. I enclose\r\na note of my own, which, with Marcy friendly, ought to cover ground\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"I yesterday wrote O'Sullivan by Benton--also Temple; you will have\r\nseen my letters before this. If I had known last week I could be of\r\nservice I might have run on. Now I start for Albany at 1.15, where\r\nI have 3 causes amongst the first 10 in the Court of Appeals, and\r\nthey now have a rule that they will not strike off or reserve on the\r\nfirst day. If I can get away the last of the week I will run on to\r\nWashington, but then I suppose it will be too late. Tallcott came on\r\nwith Tilden to Philadelphia, and brings accounts corresponding with\r\nthose in your letter. If I had known exactly how matters stood I would\r\nnot have alluded in my letter to Temple to my previous letter to\r\nTilden; if he has not read the President my letter to him he may strike\r\nout that part, or say that Tilden was afraid the abruptness of it might\r\nnot be understood, and so retained it. There is nothing in either\r\nletter that should be misapprehended between honest men--the President\r\nis entitled to frankness and plain-dealing, and so are we.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to my visiting Washington, I see no good I could do,\r\nexcept to satisfy the President and Govr. Marcy that we mean to deal\r\nwith them not only fairly but liberally. This can as well be done by\r\nyourself, Tilden, Richmond, O'Sullivan, Crosswell, Temple, Cassidy,\r\nand any other friends with whom I have no secrets, and without whom\r\nI should be powerless, if disposed to differ from them. Marcy must\r\nbe perfectly aware of this, and I am sure the President is. I am not\r\nsurprised to hear from all our friends that Marcy behaves well--his\r\nnatural disposition, old associations, good sense, and obvious policy\r\nall combine to take him to the side of sound men, and if he is prudent\r\nthe party can be made very strong in this State. It is curious, but\r\ntrue, that I have said from the first that the only fear I have about\r\nhim is that he will be too violent on the hard shells! It is a singular\r\nfear for me to have, but it is because such a course would weaken M.'s\r\ninfluence with Pierce, and excite sympathy with the hard shells. That\r\nM. would be just to our people I have never doubted since he was\r\nselected.\r\n\r\n\"I left word at Dix's that I had named him for the Collectorship. I had\r\nsome conversation with him about it the other day, and inferred from\r\nwhat he said he would not decline. On looking over the whole ground\r\nthis seems to me the best thing the President can do--and I think Dix\r\nwould be pleased with it. We cannot insist on a mission for him and\r\nthe collectorship for a Barnburner. We must have the latter, and if\r\nDix, after being gazetted to the Cabinet and to France, should get\r\nnothing it would be extremely awkward and almost ludicrous; this would\r\nmortify me extremely as well as him and his friends. I have been to\r\nsee Havemeyer; he _says he will not accept_. I told him if he declined\r\nwe would murder him. But it seems to me the President should choose\r\nbetween Kelly and Dix; if he can take Kelly and give Dix a mission that\r\nwould be best of all. Write me at Albany, and telegraph if anything\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly Y'rs,\r\n                     \"J. VAN BUREN.\"\r\n\r\n\"P.

Blair, who had edited the _Globe_, a semi-official\r\npress since the inauguration of President Jackson, and by the\r\nestablishment of the _Union_ as the new administration organ, under the\r\neditorship of Mr. Ritchie, the proprietor of the leading Democratic\r\nprint in Virginia. This was the first unmistakable evidence of the\r\ndeliberatively proscriptive policy of the new Cabinet.\r\n\r\nMr. Forney, who for many years had been the Washington correspondent\r\nof a Philadelphia print, was assigned to a prominent command on the\r\nskirmish-line of the allied pro-slavery press. Though not a wit\r\nhimself, the following skit will warrant his friends to claim for him\r\nthe credit of being once very nearly the cause of wit in another. Its\r\nchief interest to the reader now consists in its glimpses of many\r\ntransitory political issues which only live in the daily press and\r\nprivate correspondence of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPECTUS OF THE \"FORNEY-CATERER\"\r\n\r\n\"A daily journal will be established in the City of New York under the\r\ntitle of the _Forney-caterer_, the first number of which will be issued\r\nJan. 1st, 1854, or on some other first of January.\r\n\r\n\"This journal will profess radically _Democratic principles_. Believing\r\nin the largest liberty--especially in using the public moneys, it\r\nwill insist on the extension of that liberty through all the domains\r\nof the public treasuries, national, state, and municipal, as the true\r\nidea of _Democratic progress_. It will be in favor of _free trade_, as\r\npractically illustrated in steamship contracts; and will particularly\r\nsustain the _Sloo_ contract, and the assignment thereof to George Law,\r\nEdwin Croswell, Prosper M. Wetmore, and Marshall O. Roberts; and the\r\n_Collins_ contract, which its editor will also personally advocate\r\nin the lobbies of Congress for a moderate compensation. Opposed to\r\n_internal improvement_ by the general government, it will urge liberal\r\nappropriations of the public funds to any private company which shall\r\nmake satisfactory arrangements for grants in aid of the Pacific\r\nRailroad; and will take a small interest in the purchase by the\r\nUnited States of the property of the Hudson's Bay Company, should that\r\nbeneficent measure be revived with a prospect of success.\r\n\r\n\"In respect to the foreign policy of this country, it will be equally\r\nexplicit. Asserting the honor and dignity of this great and powerful\r\npeople, it will uphold the claims of Messrs. Hargous with firmness,\r\nwhether against belligerent or bankrupt nations or against refractory\r\nor unconvinced commissioners.\r\n\r\n\"Located at the great commercial centre, this journal will aim to be\r\nmetropolitan in its character. Not indifferent to the concerns of\r\nsister States, it will take a large interest in maintaining the Camden\r\n& Amboy monopoly and other domestic institutions, the blessings of\r\nwhich no traveller ever can pass a sister State without feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Strangers to the city and State of New York, as the editor and founder\r\nof this journal both are, it cannot be expected that they should at\r\nthe outset act without hesitation in purely local matters. In respect\r\nto the offal contract and the Broadway railroad, and as to the canal\r\nlettings and the timber contracts of John C. Mather, it may be as well\r\nto say that they are, as yet, wholly uncommitted. They are, however,\r\nnot altogether unfamiliar with similar things elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"An ample capital has been contributed by gentlemen who are interested\r\nin maintaining the great measures to which this journal is to be\r\ndevoted; and no expedient has been omitted to ensure its success as a\r\nbusiness undertaking in behalf of its stockholders and managers. It\r\nwill be provided with editors, reporters, and other _attachés_, enough\r\nto perform all useful services in the lobbies of Congress, of the State\r\nLegislature, and of the city Councils; and with talent and democracy\r\nenough in the editorial rooms to make good the ordinary wear and tear\r\nof character and influence incident to the other departments of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"As conveyancing will form a large element of the business, expert\r\nlegal counsel will be provided in the person of Mr. D. E. Sickles, who\r\nis recommended for this purpose by his rare skill in _taking_ mortgages.\r\n\r\n\"Before concluding, it is a painful necessity to advert to the unhappy\r\ndivisions of the Democracy of New York, which it is the main object\r\nof this undertaking to heal. An exact impartiality between those who\r\nare for preserving the party and those who are for breaking it up, was\r\nintended to be secured by dividing the ownership of the paper equally\r\nbetween them, and then putting its absolute editorial control in the\r\nhands of a gentleman whose associations, sympathies, affiliations, and\r\ntendencies are entirely and irresistibly--with the latter.\r\n\r\n\"That equitable and sensible plan having met some unexpected objection,\r\nit has been slightly modified; but it will nevertheless be carried\r\nout as if unchanged. The business arrangements are most profound\r\nand comprehensive. The proprietors who invest a large capital in\r\nthe enterprise are to have no voice in its editorial management,\r\nbecause that department--the doctrines it maintains, the degree of\r\nits ability, its consistency, its integrity, in a word, its whole\r\neditorial character--is not supposed to make any difference with the\r\nsubscription-list or advertising of a newspaper. The modern idea of a\r\ncomplete separation between those who spend and those who pay is to\r\nbe carried out more fully than in any other joint-stock speculation\r\nheretofore known; and gentlemen of first-rate ability in both these\r\ndepartments have been secured.

The editor and founder and\r\ntheir associates were assembled in this city to await the issue of that\r\nbody; and at the very moment of the bloody scenes of Syracuse were\r\nhaving recourse to the private perusal of the riot act, when, lo! they\r\nwere themselves thereby incontinently dispersed, and cannot be at once\r\nreassembled.\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _September 19th, 1853_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN [INCOMPLETE]\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Sep. 10th, 1853_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--Your letter was received yesterday. I do not think there\r\nwill be any considerable difficulty in respect to resolutions. The\r\ngeneral disposition will be to go to every reasonable extent to disarm\r\nthose who are predetermined to make mischief. The true and only serious\r\ndifficulty is to get the convention organized. The plan of those who\r\nare hostile to the union of the party is to have two conventions, if it\r\nbe possible to confuse the public mind as to which really represents\r\nthe party and its organization. All the moderation, prudence, and\r\nliberality consistent with the preservation of the convention must be\r\nexercised to avoid a disorganization; or, if that cannot be avoided (as\r\nit cannot be, if any considerable minority are bent on it), to leave\r\nthe disorganizers with as little of a case as possible. The danger is\r\nin the large number of contested seats--real and pretended. In about\r\nhalf of the cases there is no shadow of claim on the part of the\r\nhard-shell contestants; and such cases can be multiplied indefinitely,\r\nso as to form with the extreme men in the convention and the\r\ncontestants out of it a sufficient number to be a quorum of a separate\r\nbody. I think we can stand the large number of these now known, if\r\nthe moderate and union Hunkers can be held, as we anticipate. I have\r\nheard from various sources that the President feels the same solicitude\r\nwhich your letter expresses, and that he thinks that the defeat of the\r\nparty here would revive and reorganize the Whigs all over the country.\r\nIn that he is quite right. On the encouragement of a disaster in this\r\nState, the Whig party would spring to new and full life. It was so in\r\n1837 and in 1846, and in both those cases the results spread over the\r\nwhole country. Neither you nor the President need doubt that we are\r\nfully aware of the peril, both to the party in the Union and in this\r\nState; or that any reasonable effort will be omitted to avert it.\r\n\r\n\"But we are put to great odds when 30 or 35 of our districts are\r\nneutralized by contested claims, and in all this part of the State\r\nthe mass of the patronage of the genl. government is used most\r\nunscrupulously against us, and--\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Nov. 23, 1854_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I have called at your office twice to-day on some\r\nbusiness of my own. Will you oblige me by letting me know when you are\r\nin your office, that I may come and bore you?\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n                    \"W. C. BRYANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nS. J. TILDEN TO MARCY (PROBABLY)\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Oct. 12, 1853_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I take the first moment I have been able to command to\r\nanswer your note recd. on Monday.\r\n\r\n\"There is no truth whatever in the story that Grover[21] voted against\r\nor dissented from the resolutions of the late Syracuse convention. As\r\nthe question was then taken _viva voce_ it is foolish to say that any\r\nman actually voted for them unless you happened to see his lips move\r\nor distinguished his voice, but as _Grover_ did _not_ express dissent\r\nor apparently reserve his vote, I suppose he must be deemed to have\r\nconcurred in their adoption. I have no doubt that he did so, for in\r\nthe caucus the evening before he was openly in favor of adopting the\r\nBaltimore resolutions. My own knowledge of his sentiments, as expressed\r\nbefore, correspond with this course on his part. I state this as matter\r\nof fact, because it is fact; and not that I do _not_ think it idle to\r\nexpect to silence those clamors in respect to Mr. Grover. They must\r\nhave something to say. The convictions I expressed to you as the true\r\npolicy in respect to the collectorship would have been strengthened by\r\nsubsequent events if they had not been before so clear and strong.\r\n\r\n\"The safe issue with Bronson was on the charge that he has lent his\r\nofficial character and influence to disorganize the party in this\r\nState, and to aid the formation of an organized opposition to the\r\nadministration, and has abused the appointing power entrusted to him\r\nto accomplish those objects both of hostility alike to the Democracy\r\nand the administration. He would be easily convicted of the first\r\ncharge by his overt act in taking part with the bolters from the\r\ncharacter of the ticket he sustains and from the declarations of the\r\nbody of his associates. Indeed, his practical position in that respect\r\nis already sufficiently recognized by the general public. The second\r\ncharge that he had exerted his official influence and the appointing\r\npower to further the ends of the new combination into which he has\r\nopenly entered would be readily believed, and its truth could be\r\nabundantly shown at leisure. These charges, if well founded, as they\r\nunquestionably are, are of a character to justify and, indeed, demand\r\nof the administration, by its duty of self-preservation and its duty to\r\nmaintain the Democracy as an organized party, to intervene for objects\r\nso important and so elevated. It can act on such grounds without\r\nloss of dignity, and with a justice that is capable of triumphant\r\nvindication. That action should correspond with the nature of the\r\ncase--the clear legal [obligations] of the Collector to the President\r\nand to the character of the administration. In my opinion such action\r\nis to be performed only in the exercise of the power of removal. The\r\nefforts of the administration to come to an amicable understanding with\r\nthis 'refractory subordinate,' as the _Globe_ used to say, have all\r\nfailed hopelessly. Any attempt to coerce his discretion while retaining\r\nhim in office is inconsistent with every attribute which ought to\r\ncharacterize the action of the administration, as the case now stands,\r\nand will entirely fail of results except to weaken and besmirch the\r\nadministration itself.\r\n\r\n\"The failures to coerce his discretion, even his unfairness and his\r\ninfidelity to the policy of the administration in the distribution of\r\nthe subordinate appointments, are by no means the strongest grounds on\r\nwhich to place his removal. On the contrary, I think it a godsend that\r\nhe has furnished other grounds proved to your hands, of impregnable\r\nstrength, on which to justify a removal made necessary by petty wrongs\r\nand frauds, but now becomes at once indispensable at the hands of the\r\nadministration and capable of being done without loss of dignity.\r\n\r\n\"There is still another ground besides those mentioned where the\r\nmovement in this State has for its _avowed_ object to compel the\r\nPresident to remove his Cabinet. This object is daily manifest through\r\nthe press and by speeches and by resolutions. The Collector has taken\r\nopen part with this movement, and, while disclaiming these objects, he\r\nis fairly to be held to concur in them, and I presume nobody has any\r\ndoubt that he, in fact, does so. He at the same time holds an office\r\nof most power and of more importance to the administration than any\r\nmember of the Cabinet. Now is it possible to suppose that if a member\r\nof the Cabinet were taking part in public meetings of men, whose\r\nobject was to expel the rest of the Cabinet, the administration could\r\nomit to interfere in the matter without a total loss of all public\r\nrespect? The principle that the heads of the departments should be in\r\nrelations of harmony and confidence with the President has been applied\r\nas much to the Collectorship of this port as to the Cabinet offices,\r\nand with at least as much reason. Prudence as well as principle has\r\nalways sustained the President through all change of parties and of\r\nindividuals in bringing the chief officers of the government into\r\nthis harmony with it whenever he has found them otherwise. These are\r\nthe grounds on which the removal of Bronson should be placed, and\r\nhis unfairness and infidelity to the policy of the administration\r\nin appointments only incidental as constituting or being part of a\r\nsystematic abuse of the appointing power to aid his general object.\r\nThis latter should be very incidental.\r\n\r\n\"It is important that the issue should be made on _his_ conduct and in\r\nits moral, general, and public aspect, and not on the conduct of the\r\nadministration in interfering with his appointments. It is important,\r\nin a word, that the administration should have the _affirmative_ of\r\nthe issue--that it should be charging the attacking party, and not the\r\ndefending.\r\n\r\n\"You are now pausing on the edge of a marsh, when you should be in full\r\nmarch on solid ground, so at least it seems to me nothing remains but\r\nto recover as soon as possible a firm and strong position.\r\n\r\n\"If Bronson answers at once, his reply will afford the occasion for an\r\ninstant removal.\r\n\r\n\"In that event, care should be taken, by a well-considered and powerful\r\narticle in the _Union_ of a semi-official character to place the\r\nremoval on the true grounds--and as little as possible on the one by\r\nwhich the correspondence will probably be used by him and by the Whigs\r\nto frame; and that article should be especially shaped to carry the war\r\ninto Africa.\r\n\r\n\"If, as I fear, Bronson should delay answering in the knowledge\r\nthat time lost is all in their favor and against us, there is one\r\nother resource. Let the administration treat the open avowals of our\r\norganized movement to change the Cabinet, which have been made since\r\nthe correspondence commenced, as a _new development_ of the designs\r\nand character of the movement with which Bronson is implicated, and as\r\na new offence which calls for immediate action. I see no difficulty\r\nin doing this if the administration is really earnest for action\r\ninstead of wishing occasion for temporizing. Take an affirmative,\r\nenergetic course, and the details will work out themselves or be easily\r\nbrought into conformity with the broad grounds on which you act. The\r\nadministration is perishing by slow disease, the result of indecision\r\nand want of energy. I do not say this because I am willing to think\r\nit is the administration's duty to come up to any personal wishes\r\nor opinions of mine, but I should be blind if I failed to see the\r\nindication of a general and prevalent public opinion.\r\n\r\n\"If you had not known me, and I have known you more than twenty years,\r\nand will not think I speak rashly, I would not speak so frankly, though\r\nit is at once the highest office and best testimony of my friendship to\r\nconvey early what is slow and late to reach the ears of men in power.\r\n\r\n\"The bolting movement in this State would have utterly failed if it\r\ncould have been understood at the outset that this administration were\r\nunited in discountenancing it. We should have carried the State, and\r\nthe President's policy, wise and right as it was, would have had the\r\ndouble triumph of carrying at once Georgia and New York, and faction\r\nwould have been silenced in and out of Congress. The main force of the\r\nmovement here has been the false pretence that it was favored by a part\r\nof them, representations of this nature being readily believed when\r\nmade by local leaders in whom they have confidence. It is idle to say\r\nthat enough has been done to counteract this evil, when we are daily\r\nargued with by respectable men to show the contrary.\r\n\r\n\"But yesterday John Bowdish, of Montezuma, came to see me on the\r\nsubject, saying that Thomas B. Mitchell has assured him that the\r\nPresident and part of the Cabinet were with the Hards. I heard also\r\nfrom Putnam Co. that such is the general opinion there. It takes more\r\ntime than there is before the election to penetrate the localities with\r\nthe truth, and in the mean time men are getting committed too strongly\r\nto change. An unmistakable act at the outset would have saved all and\r\nwould do infinite good yet. In addition to the general considerations\r\nrespecting the character of the administration it is desirable [the\r\nnext three lines undecipherable]. Excuse the haste in which I write.\r\n\r\n  \"Very Truly Your Friend,\r\n                          \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nW. L.

SIR,--I received yesterday yr. letter of three sheets, and before\r\nI read more than one of them the President came in and interrupted me.\r\nThe tenor of our conversation was such that I thought that yr. letter\r\nwould be good reading-matter, and I handed it to him.

I have\r\njust opened a letter from him in which he intimates an intention to\r\ncarry out this policy. If he does, you may depend upon it the cause\r\nwill suffer beyond measure. I entreat you and all his friends to warn\r\nhim of the fatal consequences of such a course. I have good hopes that\r\nthings here will in the end be brought right--but I shall have none if\r\nhe carries out his mad suggestion. I beg you will interest yourself in\r\nthis matter.

I regret\r\nI was not in this State with you. I travelled with Messrs. Corning\r\nand Delavan over this region; they were delighted with the crops and\r\nthe appearance of the country. The wheat is now nearly gathered. The\r\nquantity and quality are unequalled by any previous harvest. I think\r\nit will give a new tone to affairs here. Your road is making good\r\nprogress. I wish it was done. It will be of great advantage to this\r\nsection when the two lines are united. Something will be gained when\r\nthe Watertown Road is reached. I hear this will be done in about ten\r\ndays. We must make an united effort to get immigration turned into\r\nnorthern Wisconsin. It now goes to Iowa and Minnesota. A few of the\r\nmany thousands coming to our country from Europe would give life and\r\nriches to the region if they would come here. It is the best country\r\nfor them. The Wisconsin roads make great efforts to carry them over the\r\nlength of their lines. This carries the immigrants into other States.\r\nYou and Mr. Ogden must devise a plan to correct this.\r\n\r\n\"I am very much disturbed about Secor's note in the Merchants' Exchange\r\nBank. My losses have been very great during the past two years, but I\r\ndo not like to come short of high honor in my dealings. I do not think\r\nI ought to pay the note, but I may be wrong. In my doubt, like most\r\nweak-minded men, I have done nothing. I have no right to trouble you,\r\nbut I must. I send you a letter from the bank. My continued absence\r\nfrom home has prevented me from answering it.

I.), _Aug. 26, 1854_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Your last letter reached me just as I was hurrying from\r\nthe city to fulfil a business engagement at Lebanon. I partly wrote an\r\nanswer, while there, but left suddenly, and have not found another\r\nopportunity till I came here for a few days' relaxation and sea-bathing.\r\n\r\n\"The address of my brother, for which you inquire, is 'Henry A. Tilden,\r\nNew Lebanon, Columbia Co., N. Y.'\r\n\r\n\"In my former letter I did not write in respect to politics because I\r\nwas very busy, tho' I would not postpone acknowledging your letter,\r\nreplying to the business matter it contained. If that reason had not\r\nexisted a sufficient one might have been that I had added nothing\r\nto the impressions I entertained when there was an opportunity of\r\nexpressing them more fully than could be done by correspondence.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, the moment I return to the routine of my home-life there\r\nare, at present, so many business obligations and responsibilities\r\nclaiming my thoughts and exhausting my activity that I could not, if\r\ndisposed to do so, give much habitual attention to politics. It may\r\nbe that, notwithstanding my necessary preoccupation, I should not\r\nacquiesce in so practical a retirement if I were able to propose to\r\nmyself anything satisfactory which I could see a reasonable prospect\r\nof accomplishing in the present chaotic state of parties and politics.\r\nI have at least reflected enough, and discussed with others enough, to\r\nassure me that I _cannot_, at present, propose to myself any such thing.\r\n\r\n\"My opinions as to the promotion of a fusion party, whose object should\r\nbe the restoration of the Missouri Compromise, have been more fully\r\nstated to you in conversation than they could be here, and have not\r\nbeen weakened by subsequent reflection. I do not think such a measure\r\nof any practical avail to rescue Kansas and Nebraska from slavery. Long\r\nbefore it could succeed, in the most sanguine view of its prospects,\r\ntheir destiny will be settled; and I hope that, through other agencies,\r\nit will be settled favorably. That being done, there is nothing in\r\nthe Missouri Compromise which you or I would wish to have restored.\r\nThis basis is not, then, broad or permanent enough to found upon it a\r\nparty organization of much power or durability. So, I think, the public\r\nmind will regard the matter. Its action will be through the emigration\r\nsocieties, and to punish those whom it holds principally responsible\r\nfor the breaking up of the armistice on the slavery question. In these\r\nmodes Northern indignation will find complete vent, and will exhaust\r\nitself; and there will be another general calm. Nor do I now see any\r\nother kindred question able to change this result.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to bringing out Col. Benton as a Presidential candidate.\r\nHe is very strong with the remnant of the old veterans of 1834 and\r\n1840, and has great general respect from the whole country. But I have\r\nnot changed the opinions formerly expressed to you in relation to his\r\nchances for 1856. The Democratic organization will run a candidate.\r\nIf an organization, including the Northern Whigs, does the same, I do\r\nnot see how Col. Benton could get an electoral vote. Presented, in\r\nthe first instance, as an independent candidate, it would require the\r\nconcentration upon him of the whole body of the Northern Whigs to give\r\nhim any prospect of an election. Whether such a state of things can\r\narise, it is too early to foresee.\r\n\r\n\"I greatly regret Col. Benton's defeat in his district, but cannot say\r\nI am much surprised. The Whigs do not seem to have aided him much. When\r\nhe ran before, denouncing all against us, he was the novelty of the\r\nday. The Know-Nothings are that now. If he had been personally in the\r\ncanvass it is _possible_ he might have saved himself.\r\n\r\n\"So far as my observation extends in this part of the State, a\r\nthird-party organization, if attempted, would not, in my judgment,\r\nembody a quarter of the force or numbers our movement did in 1848. I do\r\nnot know a man who bore any considerable share of the heat and burden\r\nof that day who would enter _actively_ into a similar campaign now.\r\n\r\n\"A few who did comparatively little then might wish its labors\r\nrepeated, if themselves exempted. The general disposition among\r\nthose most dissatisfied with the course of things at Washington is\r\ndisgust, indifference, in some cases individual opposition, in many\r\nindependent personal action; but very little towards organized,\r\naffirmative movement. They expect the Democratic party to be broken\r\ndown for the time. They expect the folly of its leaders to inure\r\nto the benefit of the Whigs. Some will look on with indifference;\r\nsome will frame a ticket to suit themselves; some will, perhaps, aid\r\nto produce the result which all look upon as inevitable. Most will\r\nexpect the Democratic party to rise again, purified, and to resuming\r\nrelations with it. I know of none--tho' doubtless there are such\r\nindividuals--who intend permanent union with the Whigs. I know of few\r\nwho would undertake the formation of a new party outside of existing\r\norganizations. The body of those who went with us in 1848 will continue\r\nwithin the organization in which they have since acted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO----\r\n\r\n  \"N.

But all such uprisings of the old spirit are\r\nquelled by a round of engagements here to which I must attend.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose that in the doings of the convention I can be\r\nentirely pleased--perhaps no one man will be.

It seems to me, however, that\r\nthere is more _not_ to be done than _to be_ done. It is a safe rule in\r\naffairs--and not less so in mere declarations that simply commit you\r\nwithout producing any practical result--that when you are in doubt what\r\nto do, do as little as possible.

Henry, who desired me, if possible, to get the\r\nmatter postponed, in order that some different arrangement might be\r\nmade. I applied to the bk., and they consented to some further delay,\r\nwilling to receive part payment and to renew the residue. But no plan\r\nof that kind having been acted on, the bk. has been latterly speaking\r\nto me every time I meet its officers, and urge some proceeding so\r\nstrongly that it cannot be further delayed.\r\n\r\n\"The bk. prefers an action which may bring in all the parties to a\r\nconfession of judt., and I have had Mr. Green take the proceedings to\r\nsave any unnecessary expenses. A copy of a summons and complaint is\r\nsent, with an admission of service endorsed, which you will please sign\r\nand return.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time, I cannot forbear expressing my regret that the\r\nmatter has not been put in a shape which would render this course\r\nunnecessary. Persuaded in this instance, not without great reluctance,\r\nto violate the rule on which I habitually and almost without an\r\nexception in my whole life--act, and which requires me to refuse all\r\nendorsements and suretyships--I feel that I ought to be prevented from\r\nannoyance from this transaction. If I have submitted and am submitting\r\nto have the trouble and care growing out of the affairs of the company\r\nthrown upon me most disproportionately, it is simply from a friendly\r\ndisposition, as far as I can within any bounds of reason, to see\r\nthrough a matter in which my friends are involved, and at least to get\r\nit in the best shape I may for them. From the beginning I resisted\r\nconnecting myself with the enterprise, into which I was, nevertheless,\r\ndrawn; and except, for the considerations mentioned above, I would\r\ndismiss the affair from my mind forever. Under the circumstances, it is\r\nnot strange that I feel that the trouble and care thrown upon me thro'\r\nmy regard for the interests of friends should not be added to by their\r\nomission to take care of their confidential paper.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Green has recently spent some days in Vermont in making\r\ninvestigations into the circumstances under which the Stark Bk. became\r\nthe owner (if it is so) of your acceptance. The results are very\r\nsatisfactory. It will be necessary to make some additional inquiries\r\nof the corresponding banks.

VAN BUREN TO MOSES TILDEN[24]\r\n\r\n  \"LINDENWALD, _Septr. 1st, '56_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I am happy to find that the 'sober second thought'\r\nhas brought you to the right conclusion, as I was quite sure it must\r\ndo. I may add, too, that I honor the scruples by which you have been\r\nembarrassed. It requires no small share of moral courage for men of our\r\nantecedents to keep the posts of right and duty against the influence\r\nof such resentments as we have been exposed to. But it would have\r\nbeen a crying shame to have had a single link broken in a family so\r\npre-eminently Democratic as yours has been--from Dr. and Mrs. Younglove\r\nto Sammy.\r\n\r\n\"We are not only right, but the crisis is, in my judgment, the most\r\nimminent and critical of any we have ever experienced. That union\r\nshould so long have been preserved in a confederacy which contains an\r\nelement of discord of such magnitude and of so disturbing a nature as\r\nthat of slavery, is a wonder--more surprising than its dissolution\r\nwould be. This has been owing to the fact, I firmly believe, the\r\nsingle fact that there have always been neutralizing considerations of\r\nsufficient force to maintain party cohesions between men of the free\r\nand slave States. Slavery questions have from the beginning had more\r\nor less to do with our political contests, but have never before had\r\nthe effect of dissolving old party connections and sympathies, and the\r\nbalance-wheel has thus been preserved. Now, for the first time in our\r\nhistory, one side, and that the one in which we reside, has undertaken\r\nto carry an election, including the control of the Federal government,\r\nand against the united wishes of the other. It has placed itself in a\r\nposition which, for the first time cuts itself loose from all hope, if\r\nnot desire, of assistance in the slave States. It not only admits that\r\nthis is its position, but avows that it is a desirable one. It wishes\r\nto accomplish its mastery by its own unaided arm. Now, it needs no\r\nghost to tell us that one successful effort of this description will be\r\nfollowed by another, for men have too much the quality of wild beasts\r\nin them to stop the pursuit when they have once tasted blood, and it\r\nwould be against reason and experience to expect a Union, in which\r\npolitical mastery is so plainly exhibited and organized, to continue.\r\nFrom this evil we have been saved by the state of parties which\r\nhitherto existed, and to this danger are we exposed from the new and\r\nextraordinary thing which has taken the place of it.\r\n\r\n\"Slavery agitation must be eradicated in some way or another, or\r\nour institutions cannot continue in their present form. I was so\r\nindignant against the repeal of the Missouri Compromise that I could\r\nnot do justice to the Kansas Organic Act, as that was the instrument\r\nby which the outrage was perpetrated. But I am now satisfied that\r\nif Mr. Pierce had from the beginning taken the stand he now seems\r\nto be taking, and interfered against all foreign interference the\r\nmoment he saw the disposition to interfere, of which he had at least\r\nnotice in the movements of the Missourians, the country would have\r\nbeen saved from the disgrace to which our institutions have been\r\nexposed in the estimation of the world, Kansas would have been a\r\nTerritory so decidedly free as to put an end to attempts to make it\r\na slave State, the country would have been quiet, the party united,\r\nand he renominated. All that is now wanted to secure many of the most\r\nimportant of these results is a rigid and effectual execution of the\r\nKansas Organic Act. Although I am not a particular admirer of Mr.\r\nBuchanan, I have reasons that satisfy my mind that he will, if elected,\r\nsecure to the country this great advantage, and therefore, and because\r\nhe is the regular nominee of the party, I should vote for him. If I did\r\nnot think so I would not go to the polls. I do have a very favorable\r\nopinion of Col. Fremont personally, but cannot for a moment doubt,\r\nfrom his utter want of experience in the affairs of government, and\r\nhis inexperience in everything that belongs to it, that he would, if\r\nelected, inevitably be thrown into the hands of Seward, Greeley, and\r\nWeed, and I do not think the difficulties in Kansas could be brought to\r\nanything like a satisfactory result through such agencies. I, on the\r\ncontrary, think there is the greatest reason to fear that to commit\r\nthe power of the government into such hands, at a moment so critical\r\nas the present, would be but 'the beginning of the end' in regard to\r\nthe confederacy. There are, I trust, few Democrats who would like to\r\nsubject to their control and to the plundering propensities of their\r\nfollowers, the treasury, much less the government itself. Our friends\r\nwho think they can go with the so-called Republicans this once and then\r\nreturn, make a dangerous experiment. Their party has always been a\r\nbourne from whence very few Democratic travellers have ever returned.\r\nThe reasons for this are numerous and too obvious to make it necessary\r\nto detail them. They have, therefore, but one of two courses to\r\npursue--that is to trust to the Democratic nominee and the conservative\r\ncharacters of the Democratic party, or to fly to evils they know not\r\nof, save only that except upon a single point, out of a great many,\r\nthey cannot even hope for favorable results.\r\n\r\n\"But I must stop. This is the first private letter I have written about\r\nthe election, and it will probably be the last, and nothing but my very\r\ngreat respect for yourself and your race, and my desire to preserve\r\ntheir Democratic consistency, could have induced me to write this. If\r\nit gets into the newspapers I would leave no stone unturned to have you\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the subject of your last inquiry, I do not possess definite\r\nknowledge. I believe no final resolution has yet been come to. But\r\nI can tell you nothing encouraging. If ancient Federalism gain its\r\nlong-lost ascendancy in that quarter, as it is so apt to do one time or\r\nanother, I should give up judging of character.\r\n\r\n\"Remember me very kindly to your mother, sister and brother, and\r\nbelieve me,\r\n\r\n                               \"Very truly,\r\n                                       \"Your friend,\r\n                                                  \"M.

It will be awkward to punish men for not voting for a\r\nticket--regular though it be--if it is tainted with Free-soilism. The\r\nbolters are laboring hard on that point.

The railway, acting by hydraulic force, was the\r\nnext mode by which repairs were effected. Some 16 to 20 years ago\r\nfloating docks were invented and brought into use. They have gradually\r\nsuperseded all other modes; and vessels have increased in their size,\r\nuntil there are now no other means of coppering or repairing them than\r\nthese floating docks.\r\n\r\n\"Of their utility and indispensable necessity there is no question. The\r\ncommerce of this port could not get on without them.\r\n\r\n\"They have, since their first invention, been located in the waters of\r\nthe East River, adjacent to the 7th Ward. The propriety and legality of\r\ntheir use of the basins (with the consent of the parties entitled to\r\nreceive wharfage) has never been disputed until last year, when some\r\nparties proceeded against them on the ground that they are unlawful\r\nobstructions of the public waters.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Roosevelt made a decision which, if well founded, goes the\r\nlength of holding that this commercial use cannot be lawfully carried\r\non or enjoyed in any of the slips, or at any wharf or pier of the city,\r\nand in the opinion which he pronounced on that occasion he recommended\r\nan application to the Legislature to supply the technical defect of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\"This is the object of the bill. It legalizes the use, with the consent\r\nof the pier and wharf owners, and subject to the power of the Common\r\nCouncil to regulate and fix the location.\r\n\r\n\"The bill is right in all respects. I take great interest in its\r\npassage, in behalf of the company I represent, the stockholders of\r\nwhich are owners or consignees of two-thirds of all the shipping which\r\ncomes to this port, as well as on account of the general commercial\r\ninterest.

It was introduced by\r\nWood and has continued since he was driven out. The effect of two\r\nor three years' practice under the system has been to break off\r\nrelations between that body and the masses in the wards. It was no\r\nlonger necessary for the one committeeman and his four dummies, who\r\nrepresented a ward in the committee, to keep up a vital party in his\r\nward. The ward committees fell into disuse, and in some cases what\r\nremained of them were in hostile hands. Meanwhile the outsiders felt\r\nthat they had no chance, and antagonisms were multiplied in all the\r\ncaptains of tens and fifties--the new men, the active elements of\r\nfresh ambition. The chiefs of the general committee became totally\r\nbankrupt, were split into two parties--about equal--had been occupied\r\nfor months in a scuffle for the assets, the real value of which they\r\ndid not see till the last moment. In a party twice as large as any\r\nit had to contend with, and therefore tending to division--with its\r\ncentral organization in this condition, and its ward all run out--Wood\r\nhung up his sign over the outsiders. He made local organizations among\r\nthem; worked at it assiduously for two years. When I stepped inside the\r\nring and took a view I thought that in some wards, each having once and\r\nhalf as many people as your county contains, we should scarcely have\r\nmachinery enough to run our ticket with--the 11th, for instance. We had\r\nless than two weeks to get up our organization, beginning anew--in a\r\nbad state of local nominations, many of the candidates running on both\r\ntickets and being really against us. Wood had gained the lower stratum\r\nof the Irish, combined many special interests, and at last had the aid\r\nof the jobbing Republicans, two of whom voted for him to every one of\r\nthe other class for Havemeyer. Then the _Tribune_, in _bad_ faith,\r\nand the _Post_ in good faith, succeeded in making the impression that\r\nthe way to beat Wood was to vote for Opdyke; and not only kept the\r\nmoderate Republicans to him, but drew many quiet citizens who preferred\r\nHavemeyer, but were most anxious to beat Wood.\r\n\r\n\"In truth, the leaders of the Republican party and Wood were in perfect\r\nconcert, as they are partners in the gigantic schemes of plunder, which\r\nwill presently appear.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Havemeyer polled a prodigious vote of the business classes and\r\nof the silent people, but not enough to supply the defects of the\r\norganization which, in my judgment, did not by its own strength give\r\nhim 15,000 votes.\r\n\r\n\"Enough of this. I should not have gone over the ground except for the\r\ncuriosity you expressed--that what appeared to be an immense public\r\nopinion was ineffectual. It is a public opinion with a party, and not\r\nwithout, that sweeps the stakes.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, while I am quite aware how different is the _prestige_ of\r\nsuccess from defeat, and how great was the part which might have been\r\nattempted in reconstructing the administration of the government of the\r\ncity, I cannot but feel more comfortable as I am. The proper duties of\r\nthe office are one thing. A joint tenancy in the administration of a\r\ncity like this (if you really attempt to do anything); a reconstruction\r\nof its government, which must be made from the very foundation, in\r\norder even to palliate existing evils, is a different matter. Overworn\r\nas I am with some heavy engagements, from which I cannot retire, yet\r\nuncompleted--and some heavy cares unrelieved--I could not help seeing\r\nthe burden more than anything else. This may have been morbid. A little\r\nmore strength and health might have dispelled it. But it enables me to\r\naccept the result with a sense that a great trouble is off my mind, and\r\nleaves no personal regret to mingle with the disgust I feel at Wood's\r\nelection, and the disappointment and injury to our friends. At present,\r\nI am content to live from hand to mouth, and take no thought for the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding your invitation to discuss the matter, I feel some\r\nexcuse necessary for a letter that has grown so long and so personal.\r\n\r\n\"With my best wishes for your continued health and comfort and progress\r\nin the work which enlivens your retirement, and my kind remembrances to\r\nMrs. and Miss Van Buren,\r\n\r\n  \"I am, very truly, your friend,\r\n                               \"_S.

Swayne, afterwards one of\r\nthe judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, are interesting\r\nfrom their giving a sketch of the preliminary but comprehensive\r\npreparations for the rescue and reorganization of the Pittsburg,\r\nFort Wayne & Chicago Railroad during the early days of the Civil War,\r\nand transforming it from a bankrupt corporation into one of the most\r\nprosperous highways on this continent. It is doing injustice to no one\r\nto say that it was mainly through Mr. Tilden's devotion, sagacity,\r\nprofessional ability, and foresight that this transformation was so\r\nsuccessfully accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO W. H. SWAYNE\r\n\r\n  \"FEB. _10, 1860_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--It being designed, if possible, to provide for a\r\nreorganization of the Pittsburg, F. W. and Chicago R. R. Co. during\r\nthe present year, such legislation as is necessary should be obtained\r\nat the present sessions of the Legislatures of Penn. and Ohio. That\r\nwould be expedient even if we were to wait for legislation in Indiana\r\nand Illinois until next winter. But I do not think it is necessary so\r\nto wait. I suppose that a corporation created by one of the States in\r\nwhich the road is situate, if endowed by the law of its creation with\r\nthe capacity to exercise its functions in the other States, may hold\r\nand operate the road in those States if the sovereigns there will allow\r\nit to do so. I suppose that express permission is not necessary. It may\r\ndo so on the principle of comity, unless prohibited by the legislation\r\nor declared public policy of those States. It may still be prudent to\r\nget the assent of those States declared legislatively. The act which\r\ngoverns the constitution of the corporation may be obtained in Penn.\r\nThat will avoid any question as to the operation of the clause of\r\nyour constitution imposing a personal liability upon stockholders. In\r\nIndiana there is a general law adequate to enable us to reorganize a\r\ncorporation of that State. Its Legislature, like that of Illinois, does\r\nnot meet till next year. There is nothing in the statutes or decisions\r\nof Illinois to prevent a corporation of Penn. or Indiana from holding\r\nand operating a railroad in Illinois. I presume there is not in Ohio,\r\nbut that I have not investigated, as it is wiser to have an act of\r\nrecognition. In Penn. the statutes of _mortmain_ exist by judicial\r\nadoption, and no foreign corporation can hold real estate there without\r\nexpress permission.\r\n\r\n\"We propose, then, immediately to get what we can, viz., a parent act\r\nfrom Penn. and an act of recognition from Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"The act for Penn. was finally agreed upon between Mr. Campbell and me\r\nyesterday, and was taken by Mr. Ogden to Mr. Cass to be passed. I will\r\nsend you a copy as soon as I get one.\r\n\r\n\"I have drawn and send herewith what I deem to be a suggestion towards\r\nthe bill proper to be passed by your Legislature.\r\n\r\n\"There may be a disposition to add some provision bringing the\r\ncorporation under the jurisdiction of Ohio. You must be careful that\r\nnothing of this kind is done in such general terms as to bring the\r\nstockholders under the operation of your Constitution or laws as to\r\npersonal liability.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to have you revise this bill and put it in motion. We\r\nmust rely on you and Judge Thompson to have it passed. It would be\r\nprudent to urge it forward as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\"I enclose some passages cut from my points in a recent case, which\r\ntouch on the questions I have alluded to.\r\n\r\n\"It is very desirable that Mr. Stansbery's bill, converted into\r\na general form, or some other bill applicable to all railroad\r\ncorporations in your State needing reconstruction, should pass. I trust\r\nyou and Thurman will aid in effecting such a result. There are plenty\r\nmore of cases needing your doctoring. I regret that I must write in so\r\nmuch haste. I have to leave here in half an hour, having just returned\r\nfrom Phil.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ogden is to-day in Pittsburg with authority to have a settlement\r\neffected if it can be.\r\n\r\n\"Do me the favor to let me have your views as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  Truly,\r\n                 \"S.

VAN BUREN--UNFINISHED\r\n\r\n\"NEW YORK, _Feb. 21st, 1860_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--My mind has often turned to your letter, which I am\r\nsome six weeks in arrears in answering. But I have in that time been\r\nthree times called to Philadelphia, and once to Lebanon by the extreme\r\nillness of my mother and sister; and, altogether, have had my hands\r\nfull. I am much obliged by the kind expressions of your letter, as well\r\nas the friendly interest you have taken in me.\r\n\r\n\"In respect to the subject which you incidentally mentioned in your\r\nletter, I do not think that my private business affords the elements\r\nof a desirable combination between John V. B. and myself.[26] It\r\nfurnishes few occasions which would give scope to his powers, less,\r\nperhaps, than ought to be availed of even by me; but it and other cares\r\noccupy me too much to leave any room for the ambition of collecting\r\nthe materials, or constructing a business of a different character. I\r\ncontent myself each day with what my hands find to do. I have not been\r\nvery fortunate in deputizing such business as I have generally had.\r\nIt may be because the things which come to me are usually complex and\r\ndifficult, or because I am exacting as to the mode in which my clients\r\nare served.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Mr. Tilden's letter to ex-President Van\r\nBuren, assigning his reasons for declining to enter into a partnership\r\nwith his son John, is incomplete. A more impracticable union for\r\nbusiness purposes than such a partnership would have yielded can hardly\r\nbe conceived. It is probable that the original of this letter to Mr.\r\nTilden may be found among the collected papers of Mr. Van Buren, which\r\nhave recently been presented to the Library of Congress, unless it was\r\ndestroyed immediately upon its receipt, which is not unlikely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO JOHN CLANCY\r\n\r\n  \"N.

I have but the\r\nintervals of exhausting daily engagements in which to prepare a speech;\r\nbut if after this explanation your offer shall continue open, I will\r\nendeavor within the next few days to write out in a condensed form\r\nwhat I think ought to be said, not to my friends only, but to all our\r\ncitizens touching the present state of the country. If, indeed, it can\r\nbe justly said that I have helped to lead the _Evening Post_ into any\r\n'heresies,' I acknowledge the sacred duty of showing it a 'decent way\r\nout' of them.\r\n\r\n\"With much consideration, I remain,\r\n\r\n  \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though we invited Mr. Tilden to give us the speech which he proposed\r\nto address to his spectators--they would not permit him to call them\r\nhis audience--at the Cooper Institute, we are quite willing to extend\r\nthe courtesy to anything he may choose to offer us in which he thinks\r\nthe public has an interest. The readers of the _Evening Post_ know much\r\nbetter than the crowd he tried to address at the Cooper Institute that\r\nMr. Tilden never writes or speaks without having something to say worth\r\nhearing, though they have not lately been unfortunate enough to agree\r\nwith him on Federal politics.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing letter, with the editorial comment which follows it,\r\nappeared in the _Evening Post_ October 10, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe occasion which provoked it was the following account, which\r\nappeared a day or two previous in the _Evening Post_, of a meeting\r\nat the Cooper Union of malcontents, having little in common to unite\r\nthem but their hostility to the party which had nominated Abraham\r\nLincoln for President. They were mostly the unaccounted-for _débris_\r\nof the old Whig party, who tried to disguise themselves by taking the\r\nname of \"Merchants of New York.\" Mr. Tilden was invited to speak, but\r\nthis motley audience did not care to listen long to so prominent a\r\npolitical partisan of Jackson and Van Buren, who had also been the most\r\nformidable critic of all Whig measures during all their successive\r\nadministrations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE TREMENDOUS DEMONSTRATION\r\n\r\n\"The 'Dry-Goods party,' as by general consent the fusionists have come\r\nto be designated, held what they called a 'Union meeting' last night at\r\nthe Cooper Institute. They did not meet at Tammany Hall, for obvious\r\nreasons, though it must have made some of the gentlemen who contributed\r\ntowards the expense of the entertainment feel a little queer when they\r\nfound themselves associating politically with a class of men who could\r\nnot be persuaded to put a foot inside of the old Wigwam. It has been\r\nobserved that political parties, as they decline in strength, lengthen\r\nthe list of officers supposed to officiate at their public gatherings,\r\njust as the shadows of mountains lengthen as the sun goes down. The\r\nDry-Goods party did not attempt to be an exception; on the contrary,\r\nthey seem to have made all of their party vice-presidents that they\r\ndid not make president and secretaries. In looking over the list of\r\ngentlemen who figure on this occasion, we could not but be struck with\r\nwhat Clay called the 'mutability of all human opinion.' It seemed as if\r\nthe milky portion of the old barn-burning party of '48 which had soured\r\nfrom the effects of Republican thunder, had been specially served up\r\nfor the public entertainment. There was Dix, who ran for Governor\r\nwith Van Buren in 1848 against Cass, nominated for chairman by Wilson\r\nG. Hunt, largely in the dry-goods line, who supported Van Buren and\r\nfree soil as zealously and liberally as he now supports Breckinridge,\r\nDouglas, Bell, Sam & Co.\r\n\r\n\"Our old friend Tilden, who stood at the wheel during all those\r\ntroublous times; who was one of the counsel for the Barnburners in the\r\nBaltimore convention of 1848, and who helped to lead the _Evening Post_\r\ninto all its free-soil heresies without ever showing it any decent way\r\nout of them, offered the resolutions and made a short speech. It would\r\nhave been longer, but the audience wished to hear Wood. Either Wood or\r\na song they must have, and so Mr. Tilden retired with his speech just\r\nas good as new, and, as it appeared, too good for his audience, that\r\nthey might hear a song from a Mr. Cosgrove, Wood being returned by the\r\nofficer 'not found.' The preference for Wood is explained, perhaps,\r\nby the fact that the first vice-president, W. B. Astor, was one of\r\nthe ten or dozen gentlemen who certified to Mayor Wood's character\r\nwhen a candidate a second time for the '_mayorality_'--as Mr. Wood is\r\nin the habit of spelling the dignity he at present enjoys--and who\r\nrecommended him warmly to the suffrages of the people. All the rest of\r\nthe gentlemen who signed that 'character,' Moses Taylor, M. Aspinwall,\r\nthe Browns, etc., figure also among the vice-presidents, and it is\r\nnot strange, therefore, that a meeting thus officered should prefer a\r\nspeech from Fernando Wood to a speech from Samuel J. Tilden.\r\n\r\n\"Then there was Henry Grinnell, who paid liberally towards raising\r\nthe standard of rebellion at the park meeting, held shortly after\r\nthe nomination of Cass, in 1848, and whose name was freely used by\r\nthe Barnburners until about the time that the Union-saving steamship\r\ncompanies began to be incorporated and subsidized by Congress. Since\r\nthen he has had little or no interest in anything North, this side of\r\nthe Arctic circle.\r\n\r\n\"John Cochrane, Dan Norris, Henry Eveson, William F. Havemeyer,\r\nStephen Cambreleng, Charles A. Secor, Myndert Van Schaick, whom, to\r\nhis great disappointment, the Barnburners failed to elect Mayor of the\r\ncity before the days of fusion, T. B. Tappen, John Van Buren, A. B.\r\nConger, Addison Gardiner, etc., etc., make up the list of distinguished\r\nBarnburners of the milky sort who have 'turned,' and now form the\r\ncheesy pillars and architrave of the Dry-Goods party.\r\n\r\n\"The speakers for the evening were James W. Gerard and Charles O'Conor,\r\ntwo of our ablest lawyers, skilled to make the worse appear the better\r\nreason, and, from long professional training, about as much at home on\r\none side of a question as another. As neither of these gentlemen were\r\nin good standing with the old Democratic party, the first being an old\r\nWhig and the other a fractious and crockery-breaking independent, they\r\nwere listened to with patience by an assembly conspicuously impatient\r\nof anything savoring of old-fashioned Democracy.\r\n\r\n\"What effect the bringing together such a crowd of officers for\r\nsuch a thin display of speakers will have upon the dry-goods market\r\nwill doubtless appear in the column where such reports are usually\r\nchronicled; what effect it will have on the Pennsylvania election will\r\nappear by the returns in to-morrow's _Evening Post_; what effect it\r\nwill have upon the vote of this State is of no sort of consequence, for\r\nwe were sure of a large majority before it was held, and of course we\r\nmay reasonably expect a larger majority now.\r\n\r\n\"We are sorry about Mr. Tilden's speech. We have no doubt it was a\r\ngood one, and as we are the friends of free speech we will publish it\r\ncheerfully in the _Evening Post_ if he will give us the opportunity. It\r\nwill reach a great many more of his friends through our columns than\r\nstood within the reach of his voice, and they will all be glad to know\r\nby what process so clever a man has reasoned himself into such bad\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWM. CASSIDY TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"'ATLAS & ARGUS' OFFICE.\r\n    \"ALBANY, _Octr., 1860._\r\n\r\n\"DEAR TILDEN,--Newell tells me that you are preparing a reply to the\r\n_Post's_ appeal to be 'shown the way out.' Do so; and it will give\r\nme a chance to write an editorial, which I intended and postponed\r\ntill the occasion passed by. I enclose a reply to an assault upon\r\nour consistency, the last half of which is _apropos_ to the _Post's_\r\ninquiry. I am afraid your committee of fifteen will do more harm than\r\ngood--as usual. You recollect how the Castle Garden movement defeated\r\nSeymour and elected Church, reversing its intended effect, and how the\r\nFifth Avenue movement of last year paralyzed us? Let it go, however,\r\nwith the other blunders.\r\n\r\n\"What I write to you about is to say that I intend to come down to New\r\nYork on the 7th proxo. and consult you in regard to a project which\r\nO---- and I have long discussed--establishing a New York daily. We\r\ncan readily get $60,000 (or more) for shares, and from a few men. I\r\ncan name Plumb, DeWolf, Johnson (of Oswego), Ross--besides Richmond,\r\nCagger, Corning, Kelly, etc. We could _add_ what an establishment here\r\nis worth, $40,000 or $50,000. The sum could be increased, and all\r\nsubscribed outside of New York. It is not for help (to ask you 'to go\r\nround with a paper,' as your party friends generally do), but simply\r\nfor advice. Wesley, the banker, once proposed to sell me some of his\r\ninterest in the _Times_ if I would go in there. This is _entre nous_,\r\nand I allude to it only to explain why I am going to consult him, as\r\nwell as you.\r\n\r\n\"If we could buy the _World_, the _Express_, or the _Post_, that would\r\nmake the best beginning. If we established the New York _Argus_ or\r\n_The Age_ we could start with a larger subscription and in better\r\norganization than any two other persons. Of course we would have to\r\ngo to great expense, employ many hands and heads, and meet a fearful\r\ncompetition. But neither of us are without experience, and we have\r\nregarded the question on all sides. There must be, and there will be, a\r\nDemocratic organ in New York. Who is to control it? In the transitive\r\nstate of politics, 'that is the question.' There's a vast volume of\r\nDemocratic patronage going to waste in the city, and still more beyond\r\nit. We send out 40,000 weekly papers from Albany, and in less than\r\na year could raise it to 200,000 if we were in New York. That is as\r\nmuch as Greeley has for his _Tribune_, and that is the source of its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\"There is plenty of ability in New York that could be called in.\r\nWhat is wanted is conduct--a policy, prudence, independence--for\r\nthe political part. For the business part we want competent men--an\r\nassociation, if possible, with a great publishing house, in order to\r\navail ourselves of literary talent, not allowing it, however, to be our\r\npublisher. Commercial and other reporters, and enough literary talent\r\nto supply a daily _feuilleton_; for we must call on the aid of fiction,\r\nas the Paris papers do, and so gratify a taste which is stronger here\r\nthan anywhere else. I would commence by getting Hawthorne or some\r\nwriter of equal talent to furnish a novel, which might be republished\r\nafterwards in a volume, and which would thus pay. To do this, we should\r\nwant a paper like the _World_. We will reverse the wish of Archimedes:\r\ngive us the _World_, and we will find the lever to move it.\r\n\r\n\"But I intend to ask your advice, not to forestall it. Until I see you,\r\nwhich will be after the November triumph, I remain\r\n\r\n  \"Yr. frd. & fellow-sufferer,\r\n                              \"WM. CASSIDY.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Wood was elected by Greeley's agency, I made up my mind that he\r\nwould administer retributive justice upon G. & Co. by some stupendous\r\norganization of the canvassers. But you have an honest vote of 100,000.\r\nThe Republicans are not entitled to more than 30,000 of this. Give us\r\n40,000, and we will carry the State. Organize--make them do it. The\r\nregistry will facilitate such work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BIGELOW TO S. J.

I agree with you heartily in your\r\nviews: they are sound, wise, and patriotic; but what avails it to\r\nproclaim them?

H. SWAYNE ON THE PROCURING A CHARTER FROM THE STATE OF\r\nOHIO FOR THE PITTSBURG, FORT WAYNE & CHICAGO RAILROAD\r\n\r\n  \"_Dec. 6, 1860._\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Two modes of investing the future owners of the P. F.\r\nW. H. R.[29] with a corporate character within the State of Ohio have\r\nbeen suggested.\r\n\r\n\"1. One is to make them a corporation of the State of Ohio--by creating\r\nthem a new corporation, or by continuing to them the old corporate\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\n\"I understand Mr. Stanbery and Mr. Hunter to propose the latter\r\nmethod. By providing for the transfer of the existing franchise to\r\nbe a corporation by a general law, they avoid the constitutional\r\nprovision that 'the general assembly shall pass no special act\r\nconferring corporate powers.' They think, also, that by preserving the\r\nidentity of the existing franchise they can avoid the operation of the\r\nconstitutional provision 'that in all cases each stockholder shall be\r\nliable over and above the stock by him or her owned, and any amount\r\nunpaid thereon, to a further sum, at least equal in amount to such\r\nstock,' upon the ground that the provision is not retractive, and was\r\nestablished subsequently to existence of this corporation. They think,\r\nalso, that although the identity of the corporation will be preserved,\r\nit can be discharged from liability for the debts and contracts which\r\nit has made. If it should be found to be liable for those debts and\r\ncontracts, the main object of the reorganization would fail.\r\n\r\n\"2. The other mode is to make the future owners a corporation of\r\nPennsylvania or Illinois, and to enable that corporation to hold,\r\nmaintain, and operate the part of the road which is situate in Ohio,\r\nwithout being a corporation of the State of Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"To enable a Pennsylvania corporation, for instance, to hold, maintain,\r\nand operate the part of the road situate in Ohio two things are\r\nnecessary:\r\n\r\n\"_First_, that it should be endowed by the law of its creation (which\r\nwould be the act of Pennsylvania creating it), with capacity to hold,\r\nmaintain, and operate the part of the said road which is situate within\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\"_Secondly_, that it should have the consent, implied or expressed, of\r\nthe State of Ohio to the exercise within that State of its powers to\r\nhold, maintain, and operate the part of the railroad situate within\r\nthat State.\r\n\r\n\"Such consent in this case will be implied, unless the implication is\r\nnegatived by express legislative declaration of the public policy of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n\"As the laws of Ohio allow an individual purchaser to hold, maintain,\r\nand operate the railroad--which individual might be a non-resident--and\r\nas there is no policy established by legislation or by a judicial\r\nconstruction to disable a corporation of another State having the\r\nrequisite capacity from doing so, the case comes clearly within the\r\nprinciple on which nearly all the acts of corporations in other States\r\nthan those of their creation are sustained by the courts as lawful.\r\n\r\n\"The rights of the State of Ohio are not violated; for it is by her\r\nconsent that these powers will be exercised within her dominion. That\r\nconsent could have been withheld. I do not say that it might not be\r\nwithdrawn by legislation, not so as to divest rights of property\r\nwhich accrued while it existed, but so as to produce inconvenient\r\nconsequences to the tenure of the corporators: nor will I advert to\r\nthe fact that a vast number of transactions are daily carried on in\r\nsome of the States by corporations of other States, subject to the same\r\npossibility, or that in some States, as in New York, most corporations\r\nexist subject to full legislative power to repeal the act conferring\r\nthe franchise.\r\n\r\n\"For I have not doubted--I have uniformly expressed the opinion that in\r\na case of the peculiar nature and vast importance of the present it is\r\nwise to obtain an express consent.\r\n\r\n\"Shall that consent be given by special act or general law? Would it\r\nhave any effect on the extent of the liability of the corporations?\r\n\r\n\"The essence of the corporate character is that several individuals are\r\nunited in one body--enabled to exist and act as an artificial person\r\ncreated by law, the members of which can change without impairing the\r\nidentity of that body of person.\r\n\r\n\"The code of regulations, according to which it exists and acts, which\r\nfix its _modus_ is incidental to that creation.\r\n\r\n\"Its other powers, which may be and often are possessed and exercised\r\nby natural persons, are not, strictly speaking, corporate powers,\r\nsuch, for instance, as making discounts, granting insurances,\r\noperating railroads; there is nothing in the nature of these powers\r\nwhich necessarily confines them to corporations. They are not of the\r\nessence or of the incidents of the corporate character. I think the\r\nprohibition of the Ohio Constitution that 'the general assembly shall\r\npass no special act conferring corporate powers' is a mere paraphrase\r\nof the prohibition of the New York Constitution, contained in the\r\nfollowing provision: Corporations may be formed under general laws,\r\n_but shall not be created by_ special act, etc. The next clause of the\r\nOhio Constitution provides that 'corporations' may be formed under\r\ngeneral laws.\r\n\r\n\"The provision was, in the main, copied from the Constitution of New\r\nYork. The modification of details accounts for the change in the\r\ncollocation.\r\n\r\n\"In a cursory review of the discussions in the Ohio convention I see\r\nno trace that anything further was intended by the prohibition than to\r\ninterdict the creation of corporations by special acts.\r\n\r\n\"That construction accords with the true meaning of the words\r\n'corporate powers,' which is powers essential or incident to the\r\nnature of the artificial being created by law--such as the power to\r\ntake a common name, to have corporate succession, to contract and be\r\ncontracted with, and to sue and be sued as one person, etc. These are\r\nproperly corporate powers. It is true the words are sometimes used to\r\ninclude all the powers which the particular corporation possesses; but\r\nthat is a loose and inaccurate use.\r\n\r\n\"I think that the correct interpretation of the publication is that\r\nit simply forbids the creation of a corporation by a special act of\r\nincorporation--nothing more. It does not forbid an act operating to\r\nenlarge, modify, or restrict the rights of an existing corporation,\r\nany more than it does a similar act in respect to a natural person in\r\na like case. Still less does it forbid such legislation in respect to\r\na foreign corporation. It is enough for the present case to say that\r\nthe clause does not prohibit a legislative recognition or an express\r\nsanction of an existing comity of the State in favor of an existing\r\ncorporation of another State.\r\n\r\n\"1. I am, therefore, of opinion that a special act declaring the assent\r\nof the State of Ohio to the exercise within that State of all the\r\npowers necessary for a beneficial use of the Pittsburg, F. W. & Chicago\r\nRailroad by a corporation of Pennsylvania or Illinois, which should\r\nhave become the owner of the part of such railroad situate within the\r\nState of Ohio, would be valid and effectual.\r\n\r\n\"A general law would, of course, be somewhat preferable, as it would\r\navoid this question. If it is certainly attainable, I would seek our\r\nlegislation in that form.\r\n\r\n\"But I foresee the possibility that it might excite more jealousy than\r\na special act, because its full application and use cannot be certainly\r\nanticipated. I foresee, also, the possibility that it may affect\r\nspecial cases of existing interest, prejudice, or passion, of which I\r\nam ignorant.\r\n\r\n\"In the first section of a draft of a general law which I have hastily\r\nmade at a suggestion, I have tried to avoid the first of these two\r\nobjections by limiting the cases to which the law applies.\r\n\r\n\"1. An existing railroad.\r\n\r\n\"2. Partly situate in Ohio and partly in some adjacent State.\r\n\r\n\"3. Sold under an existing lien.\r\n\r\n\"4. Acquired by a corporation of another State in which another part of\r\nthe same railroad is situate.\r\n\r\n\"5. Such corporation acquiring the part of the railroad situate in that\r\nother State.\r\n\r\n\"6. Of course, such corporation having the capacity to take and operate\r\nthe part situate in Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I may have put in more limitations than are necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Whether the measure will run foul of any other interest can be better\r\njudged of by men conversant with the state of affairs in Ohio and in\r\nits legislation.\r\n\r\n\"The general law, as proposed, is not more liberal than the existing\r\nconsolidation act of Ohio. We ought to be able to obtain it. If there\r\nis a strong probability that we cannot, we ought to obtain a special\r\nact of a similar nature, applicable only to our particular railroad.\r\n\r\n\"2. The advantage of not making the corporation a creation of the State\r\nof Ohio is that it certainly and unquestionably avoids this double\r\nliability of the corporators imposed by the Constitution of that State.\r\n\r\n\"The degree of liability to which the individual corporators shall\r\nbe subject is a part of the code of regulations specifying the mode\r\nand conditions of the existence and action of the artificial being.\r\nSometimes it is nothing beyond the stock paid in. Sometimes, as by the\r\nOhio Constitution, it is a limited amount beyond the stock paid in;\r\nsometimes it is absolute, as in the case of partners. It is not of the\r\nessence of corporations--it is a regulation imposed by the sovereign\r\nwho creates the artificial being an incident to the particular\r\ncorporation. Nobody but that creator could impose such a regulation.\r\nThe most any other State could do would be to refuse its comity to a\r\ncorporation until it should get the regulation imposed by the lawful\r\nauthority of the State of its creation.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, the provisions of the Constitution of Ohio applies only to\r\ncorporations created by or under the laws of that State. It does not\r\npurport to operate on corporations of other States transacting business\r\nin Ohio under the comity of its sovereign.\r\n\r\n\"3. In respect to the general act proposed by Mr. Stanbery and Mr.\r\nHunter, I think they should prepare it and that we should co-operate\r\nin procuring its passage. It would be open to our choice if on\r\nconsultation we should prefer to act under it; and it would be useful\r\nin other cases. My idea originally was to have that general law and a\r\nspecial act for the Pittsburg, F. W., C. R. R. If we change the latter\r\nto a general law, it makes two of that character; but I do not see any\r\nobjection if we can get them both passed.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to have a copy of the draft of such an act as Mr.\r\nStanbery and Mr. Hunter propose.\r\n\r\n\"The draft of a general act which I send contains provisions which\r\nought to be considered as consulted upon. I have prepared them without,\r\nperhaps, sufficient study of your laws on the subject, and without\r\nknowing the temper of your Legislature.\r\n\r\n\"In some particulars they must be regarded as mere suggestions.\r\nConsider--\r\n\r\n\"1. The clause of Sec. 1, subjecting the company in respect to its\r\nmanagement of the part of the railroad to the duties and regulations\r\nimposed by your general laws--whether there is any provision which\r\nshould be accepted, whether this clause ought to be made more stringent\r\nin order to be satisfactory to your Legislature. But care should be\r\ntaken not to use expressions which could include the personal liability\r\nprovisions of the Ohio Constitution and laws.\r\n\r\n\"2. The clause of the same section subjects it to be--\r\n\r\n\"Section 2 is intended to give the same power as to mortgaging the\r\nrolling stock, etc., which is contained in the Pennsylvania act. I do\r\nnot think this ought to be objected to.\r\n\r\n\"Section 3 is an adaptation of a clause proposed last summer.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot send a fair copy of the special act without losing a\r\nmail. The general one is sufficient as a basis of consideration and\r\nconsultation.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to have you consider the matter, and must contrive some\r\nway to meet in consultation.\r\n\r\n\"I address this letter to you, though its contents are for Mr.\r\nStanbery, Mr. Hunter, and Judge Sherman, to whom I pray you to offer my\r\nbest respects.\r\n\r\n                               \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                  \"S.

OGDEN\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Dec. 17, 1860_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--As you leave in the morning to return to Chicago, I\r\nseize a few moments this evening to submit to you some suggestions as\r\nto the present crisis in the affairs of our country. I know you have\r\nno personal aspirations; that you are exempt from the blinding and\r\nmisleading influence of active partisanship; that your disposition is\r\nequitable; that you have no motive but the public good--no interest\r\nexcept in common with all patriotic citizens; and that, far better\r\nthan most men, you understand that there is usually another side to a\r\ncontroversy than 'our side.'\r\n\r\n\"Your situation may enable you to be of great service to your country\r\nand to mankind, and of not less service to a gentleman who to-day\r\noccupies a more important and responsible position than has been the\r\nfortune of any other of his generation. Of course I allude to Mr.\r\nLincoln. His patriotism I do not doubt. The impression he made on\r\nme, upon two occasions when I casually met him, was that of a frank,\r\ngenial, warm-hearted man. In the actual duties of the Presidency he\r\ncannot but take conservative views. No man can have a motive so strong\r\nand yet so noble to prevent his own name from closing, amid public\r\nsorrow and shame, the illustrious roll of American Presidents which\r\nbegan with Washington.\r\n\r\n\"It must be his renown or his calamity to decide whether he shall\r\nbe the Chief Magistrate of a whole country or of half a country.\r\nProvidence has cast upon him that immense responsibility. In saying\r\nthis I do not touch the question, What has caused the mischief? I speak\r\nonly as to the question, _Who has the power to save the country?_\r\n\r\n\"1. The reality of the _danger_ of disunion, I think, cannot be\r\ndoubted. The cotton States are far more unanimous for secession than\r\nour fathers were when they made our revolution despite of the royalist\r\nmajority. Practically, their people are unanimous. We can only hope for\r\nan effective minority forming itself in some qualified position within\r\nthe current of popular opinion. A statesmanlike policy would be to aid\r\nthe formation of that minority--to strengthen it that it may become a\r\nmajority, to create, to hasten, to swell the reaction for which we hope.\r\n\r\n\"2. Our first necessity is to comprehend the crisis. That is difficult.\r\nA man on one side of a question cannot easily turn out the set of ideas\r\nwhich fill his mind and admit the opposite set, even for an experiment.\r\nNothing is so difficult in ordinary experience as to see both sides\r\nof a question. For us who have been educated with Northern ideas or\r\nin party controversies, we must be almost more than mortal to be able\r\nto take a perfectly candid and impartial view of the position of our\r\nadversaries. It is necessary to do more--to imagine ourselves in their\r\nposition, in order to form a policy adapted to their case.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWNSEND WARD TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"PHILADELPHIA, _Dec. 19, 1860_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--Last evening, at Mrs. Gilpin's, I met Mr. Ogden, who kindly\r\ngave me a copy of your letter to Mr. Kent.[30] It is so well calculated\r\nto do good that I want to obtain copies for distribution.

I have delayed\r\nwriting to you to say so until I could seize a moment in which to add\r\na suggestion as to the future; and, in the mean time, how rapidly, how\r\nfearfully, have events been hurrying forward!\r\n\r\n\"It seems, too, that these events cast largely upon the Virginia\r\nstatesmen of this generation the momentous duty of saving from\r\ndestruction a political system which we and the world owe mainly to the\r\nVirginia statesmen of the golden era of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nS.

This plan assumes that Church and yourself will enter\r\nheartily into this movement, and that one of you will go into the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever does so will, in my judgment, run a very serious risk of\r\ndamaging his own record; the adoption of the plan will hasten rather\r\nthan retard impeachment; it is not unlikely that the finances may be\r\nderanged, which will be chargeable to us, and with Johnson's sins of\r\nomission and commission on our backs, we stand a fair chance of defeat,\r\nwhen otherwise we might win in the coming Presidential fight. I see\r\nnothing to be gained except a few places, very few, too, with Congress\r\nagainst us, for a few men who want position.

Hewitt and Cooper\r\nin succession. In the main I assent to your views.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt--\r\n\r\n\"1. That the late election[31] was not a verdict of the Northern States\r\non the theoretic questions urged by the Republicans. Masses went for\r\nLincoln, from habit and association, as a lineal succession from\r\nWhiggism. Masses from mere opposition to the Democratic party, and from\r\nall the causes which gradually operate to make a revolution between\r\nthe ins and the outs. The drift created by the disorganization of the\r\nDemocratic party, and our inability to present any single candidate as\r\na point of union to the conservative sentiment, and the concession from\r\nApril till October that we must inevitably be beaten; I say this drift\r\nalone might fairly be 24,000 out of 675,000 voters, or 3-1/2 per cent.,\r\nwhich would have changed the result in N. Y. and in the Union.\r\n\r\n\"2. That a very important reaction has already taken place.\r\n\r\n\"3. That, even if we had not had our present difficulties to bring\r\nmen to consider, Lincoln's administration must necessarily go utterly\r\nto pieces when it came either to _present affirmative measures_ or to\r\n_distribute the patronage_.\r\n\r\n\"4th. That, on the whole, through all these struggles and much apparent\r\nincrease of the anti-slavery element, there is growing a larger and\r\nstronger party, capable of doing the Southern States full justice,\r\nthan ever has existed for half a century past; I mean, capable of\r\nrecognizing, on reason and principle, the right and the necessity\r\nthe Southern States have to grow in the natural expansion of their\r\nindustrial and social systems. In 1820 the North was unanimous in\r\nclaiming the right to attack conditions operating after a State should\r\nbe admitted. That idea is now abandoned by a vast majority of our\r\npeople. It is natural that when a new question arises, assumed to be\r\nwithin our constitutional jurisdiction, our people should all start to\r\napply to it the ideas on which they have acted at home. To see that it\r\ncannot be wisely disposed of by their merely voting in respect to it as\r\nif it were a purely domestic question; that they must calculate for the\r\nco-existence and expansion of the two systems; that they must partition\r\nthe Territories--is a later stage in their political education.\r\n\r\n\"I am of opinion that prevalent errors have, in the main, run their\r\ncourse; and we need only to give our people a fair chance to secure\r\nthe adoption of a wiser and better system than they have ever before\r\nunderstandingly accepted.\r\n\r\n\"If the present Congress continues unable to do anything adequate,\r\nI think the next best thing will be a convention of all the States\r\nto propose amendments to the Constitution, with an arrangement, if\r\npracticable, to keep the parties in _status quo_ while those amendments\r\nare being perfected and submitted. The convention should be elected in\r\ndistricts on the basis of the House of Rep. The submission should be to\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\n\"That would make two popular elections necessary. The convention\r\nwould be sure to be conservative. By summer the disintegration of\r\nthe Republican party would be completed, the reaction perfected, and\r\nthree-quarters of the States would ratify amendments substantially on\r\nthe basis of Crittenden's propositions.\r\n\r\n\"Our people are temporarily misled, but by a vast majority conservative\r\nat the bottom. We only need time to bring them to a sound position.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse the haste with which I am compelled to write, and believe me,\r\n\r\n                               \"Very truly,\r\n                                      \"Your friend,\r\n                                            \"(sd.)

His letter is valuable as an illustration of the\r\ndiversity of opinion among leading men of all parties by which Mr.\r\nLincoln's government was perplexed during the three first years of\r\nhis administration. Advice was in abundance, but no two counsellors\r\nentirely agreed about what the government should do or abstain from\r\ndoing.

It is indispensable._ And if the convention will\r\nconfine itself to that one point and ask time for consideration it\r\ncannot very decently be refused.\r\n\r\n\"Time is wanted--\r\n\r\n\"1st. That Mr. Lincoln may dispose of his patronage.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. Until elections can be held in all the Northern States, in most\r\nof which the Republicans would be defeated.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. That the South may try the Southern confederacy, in which they\r\nwill probably fail to realize the golden advantages, and will be quite\r\nwilling to resume their places in the Union when they can do so with\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n\"I think Legislatures may be elected next fall in 2/3 of the States,\r\na convention called, good amendments proposed and ratified, so as to\r\nbring all the States again into the Union, and that your convention is\r\nthe proper body to _start this project at this time_.\r\n\r\n\"If it takes this course it should appoint an executive or\r\ncorresponding committee to act and correspond with other States, and\r\nshould omit expressing any opinion as to the _particular amendments now\r\nbefore Congress_, so as to be free from all commitments to special and\r\nparticular projects.\r\n\r\n\"I think this the only way of preventing war and saving the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the resolutions will refrain from condemning the seceding\r\nStates, also from demanding the forts to be reclaimed, and, in fact,\r\neverything that can lead to war.\r\n\r\n\"I had a talk yesterday with Mr. Loomis, and he understands my views,\r\nand will, I believe, act in accordance with them, as they seemed to be\r\nhis also.\r\n\r\n  \"_Wednesday Morning._\r\n\r\n\"The two sides of my face are too unequal to show it in Albany, so\r\nI will add a few words which I think the most important I have ever\r\npenned, unless there should be some one or more who have by careful\r\nreflection come to the same conclusion; and I hope you will not reject\r\nthem on the first perusal, but weigh them, reflect upon them, suggest\r\nthem to Richmond, Van Buren, O'Connor, etc.\r\n\r\n\"_To direct the whole action of the convention to initiate a call of a\r\nnational constitutional convention through a requisition upon Congress\r\nby the States, and demand the necessary and indispensable time to\r\neffect this object._\r\n\r\n\"Such action will drive the Republicans to abandon their warlike\r\nmeasures, and will very likely hurry them either to the adoption of\r\nsome of the measures before Congress or to take the initiative this\r\nwinter for the call of a national convention while they have the\r\napparent power of controlling it.\r\n\r\n\"Such a movement would carry every Northern State except Massachusetts\r\nand Vermont, would restore the Democracy to power, and revive and\r\ninvigorate the Union. Start it, I implore you, and do not let the\r\nconvention exhaust itself on the rubbish now before Congress. We must\r\nstrike a blow at the overwhelming patronage of the Federal government,\r\nand restore it to the States to augment their power. We must place the\r\nSouth in a position where it will feel its equality, and have the means\r\nof defending itself in its own hands.\r\n\r\n\"By taking this course, simple and pure, invigorating it with all the\r\nspirit and vehemence of the convention so as to arrest the attention\r\nof the whole country, you will open a door for the reunion of all\r\nDemocrats at home and abroad, and save all that is worth saving in our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\"You recollect Act. 5--Cons. U. S.--that Congress _shall_, on the call\r\nof 2/3 of the States, call a convention.\r\n\r\n\"You initiate this proceeding, then you have a reason for demanding\r\npeace, for you have a constitutional remedy to propose. You have an\r\nobject always ahead to accomplish, all old, obsolete issues are dead,\r\nand you have always hope to influence the masses and the _Union to\r\nlove_ to incite all men to its restoration to health and vigor.\r\n\r\n\"If this plan of action is proposed by others, encourage it if you\r\nhave resolved upon it; be confirmed in your resolution, but do not,\r\nI beseech you, reject it because it comes from so humble a source\r\nas myself. I fancy I have bestowed as much calm reflection upon all\r\nthe phases of this state of the country as all the members of the\r\nconvention. I believe no one can be personally less interested, whether\r\nwe all go to chaos and confusion, or come out with renewed vigor from\r\nthe dangers of this dark hour.\r\n\r\n\"If it shall appear that I am a suggester, then I beg you to place the\r\nmatter in Van Buren's hands and let him at the first practicable moment\r\nlay the subject fairly and squarely before the convention. And as more\r\nthink upon it they will admit it is the thing to kill the Republican\r\nparty.

SEWARD\r\n\r\n  \"WASHINGTON, _March 3, 1861_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--Hoping that in a day or two the new President will have\r\nhappily passed through all personal dangers and find himself installed\r\nan honored successor of the great Washington, with you as the chief of\r\nhis Cabinet, I beg leave to repeat in writing what I have before said\r\nto you orally, this supplement to my printed 'views' (dated in October\r\nlast) on the highly disordered condition of our (so late) happy and\r\nglorious Union.\r\n\r\n\"To meet the extraordinary exigencies of the times, it seems to me\r\nthat I am guilty of no arrogance in limiting the President's field of\r\nselection to one of the four plans of procedure subjoined:\r\n\r\n\"1. Throw off the old and assume a new designation--the Union party.\r\nAdopt the conciliatory measures proposed by Mr. Crittenden or the\r\npeace convention--and my life upon it, we shall have no new case of\r\nsecession, but, on the contrary, an early return of many, if not of\r\nall, the States which have already broken off from the Union. Without\r\nsome equally benign measure the remaining slave-holding States will\r\nprobably join the Montgomery Confederacy in less than sixty days,\r\nwhen this city, being included in a foreign country, would require a\r\npermanent garrison of at least 35,000 troops to protect the government\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\n\"I stop here to call your attention to the fact that Maryland did not\r\njoin the Montgomery Confederacy, and yet with Maryland on our side\r\nto-night, it requires a garrison of 150,000 men to protect Washington.\r\n\r\n\"2. Collect the duties on foreign goods outside the ports of which this\r\ngovernment has lost the command, or close such ports by act of Congress\r\nand blockade them.\r\n\r\n\"3. Conquer the seceded States by invading armies. No doubt this might\r\nbe done in two or three years by a young and able general--a Wolfe, a\r\nDesaix, or a Hoche, with 300,000 disciplined men, estimating a third\r\nfor garrisons, and the loss of a yet greater number by skirmishes,\r\nsieges, battles, and Southern fevers. The destruction of life and\r\nproperty on the other side would be frightful, however perfect the\r\nmoral discipline of the invaders.\r\n\r\n\"The conquest completed at that enormous waste of human life to the\r\nNorth and Northwest, with at least $250,000,000 added thereto, and\r\n_cui bono_? Fifteen devastated provinces! not to be brought into\r\nharmony with their conquerors, but to be held for generations, by heavy\r\ngarrisons, at an expense quadruple the net duties or taxes which it\r\nwould be possible to extort from them, followed by a protector or an\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\"4.

O'SULLIVAN[33] TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"LISBON, _May 6_, _1861_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR TILDEN,--The heart-breaking news has just reached us here,\r\nfirst of the attack and capture of Sumter, for which the signal was so\r\nmadly and wickedly given by the administration (dominated, evidently,\r\nby the war portion of that party) in its despatch of reinforcements;\r\nand, secondly, of Lincoln's declaration of war by his proclamation\r\nfor 75,000 volunteers for the recapture of all the Southern forts,\r\nthat is, for the invasion of the South--an act followed, of course, by\r\nsecession of Virginia, and soon to be followed, I have no doubt, by\r\nthat of all or nearly all the border States. Also the telegraph tells\r\nof a Massachusetts regiment resisted in an (insane) attempt to force\r\na passage through Baltimore. Gracious God, that we should have lived\r\nto see such things! You can better judge, than I could describe, my\r\naffliction. At first it drew from me convulsions of tears. I think it\r\nis a greater grief than that I passed through a little short of a year\r\nago. What doom is sufficient for the mad authors of all this! By that\r\nI mean, for 9/10 of the crime, the ultra portion of the Republican\r\nparty. The papers say that there is a common enthusiasm of all parties\r\nat the North for the support of the admn. I may stand alone, but I do\r\nnot share this. I am extremely anxious to hear from you. Do write me\r\nyour views. I chafe terribly under the impossibilities which alone\r\nprevent my hastening home. Not only have I not the means, but I cannot\r\nleave my debts here, when a short, prolonged stay will probably assure\r\nme the means of paying them. Then I shall come, to do my best in the\r\nfight at home for _peaceful_ separation if reunion has become indeed\r\nimpossible. What will New York do? I trust devoutly that if any troops\r\nmarch from our State southward they may consist only of Republicans.\r\nMy hope now is that the North will at last realize the mad horror of\r\nthe whole thing, and that a cloud of witnesses will arise to protest\r\nagainst its being carried further. Thus far the country has drifted\r\nalong, both sides standing obstinate to the consistency of their\r\nopposite _theories_. But surely all should now agree to pause and hold\r\nback! But the Republican leaders, I fear, will now move heaven and hell\r\nto push and drag forward the North to sustain them in the position\r\nto which they have brought things. And I fear much from the fighting\r\ncharacter of our people. I dread the next news. If Maryland goes with\r\nVirginia there will probably be dreadful fighting for the possession of\r\nWashington, unless the wise and patriotic like you can stop it.\r\n\r\n\"We are exemplifying the fable of the dispute between the head and tail\r\nof the snake for the right to lead. The Democratic party is the natural\r\nand the only possible government of our Democratic confederation. It\r\nalone has ever understood the idea of State rights. The tail has taken\r\nits turn of leadership, and you see to what a pass it has brought the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Were it not for the immediate question of the fighting to grow out of\r\nthe question of the possession of Washington, I should say it were best\r\nthat the border States should now all go at once, so as to make the\r\nNorth feel the absurdity of further prosecution of war.

I have\r\ngood prospects of a contract for rifles and artillery from this\r\ngovernment--it is under consideration now. Could not do anything _at\r\npresent_ in France, though the plan was recognized as superior to their\r\nown or to anything known.

Published in New York\r\n_Tribune_, November 3, 1874:\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Nov. 2, 1874_.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--On Saturday afternoon, June 22d, 1861, a stand of regimental\r\ncolors--the gift of its Democratic friends, merchants and others--was\r\npresented to the 37th Regiment, N. Y. S. Volunteers. The colors were\r\npresented at the Battery, the regiment then being drawn up in line, and\r\nbeing at the time ready to depart for the scene of war, which it did on\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\n\"There was some ceremony at the presentation of the flags, and several\r\nspeeches were made. One of the speakers on the occasion was Mr. Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden, who made a stirring appeal to the officers and men of the\r\nregiment--a speech not excelled in patriotism by any public speaker\r\nduring the War of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"The writer of this letter knows whereof he affirms, for he was also\r\npresent and took part in the presentation ceremony.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) \"JOHN T. AGNEW.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. L. O'SULLIVAN TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"LISBON, _June 5, 1861_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR TILDEN,--I have not yet a word from you, and should feel\r\nmore angry than I do at such a cruel silence were it not that I fear\r\nyou must be sadly harassed and occupied with your private affairs,\r\nsuperadded to the afflictions of the patriot. Since my last letter\r\nI have seen in the papers reason for some mitigation of the extreme\r\ndisgust and indignation I had before felt in regard to the conduct of\r\nthe Democratic party at the North. I had all but forsworn it, supposing\r\nthat it had all gone over, bag and baggage, into this worst form of\r\nRepublicanism, which consists in the support of this insane and wicked\r\nwar, and that, consequently, no possible place remained for me, even\r\nin a corporal's guard, left of it. But I see in the newspaper letter\r\nfrom New York the cheering expression that 'the _Daily News_, by taking\r\na strong Southern view, has largely increased its circulation, which\r\nshows that people like to see what can be said against the war, if they\r\ndo not agree with the opinions expressed.' This assures me at least\r\nthat even though I might be myself hung for a traitor in the streets of\r\nNew York, for my sentiments on the subject, there would still remain\r\nsomebody willing to cut me down and give me decent burial. I now look\r\nwith great anxiety for the Democratic State convention called for the\r\n4th of July, though what it can do to resuscitate the suicided body of\r\nthe old party I do not see. I beg you to go to the office of the _News_\r\nand subscribe for their weekly paper for me, with the back numbers for\r\nthe period since the beginning of the war. Do the same in regard to\r\nthe _Day Book_. Let them be directed to the U. S. Legation, Lisbon,\r\nthrough care of John Miller, U. S. Despatch Agent, 26 Henrietta Street,\r\nCovent Garden, London. Subscribe, also, for the _Weekly Post_. I must\r\nget you to advance the payment for these subscriptions for me, which\r\nI will repay. The _Herald_ I see here through another channel. The\r\n_Post_ I want only, of course, for the object of seeing the talk of\r\nthe enemy. Do tell me all _your own mind_ on the subject. I am frankly\r\nand decidedly with the South now in their stand of resistance against\r\nsubjugation and for independence. Whatever antecedents may have led up\r\nto it, that stand is now rightful and honorable, and submission would\r\nbe pusillanimous and base, while in those very antecedents four-fifths\r\nof the wrong has been on the Northern side. This war against States\r\nconstituting nearly half of the Union is an entire violation of the\r\nwhole spirit of the Constitution, as well as of that of the law of\r\n'95, under which it is made. It is the South which is now fighting\r\nin defence of all the principles and rights of American liberty, for\r\nself-government and the dignity of man, and even though it should be\r\nconquered and subjugated the Union of force and military centralization\r\nthence to result would be in itself a worse political evil, and\r\nmore pregnant with future mischief, than would be _now_ a confirmed\r\nseparation. However, therefore, I may deplore, with heartbroken grief\r\nand shame, all the disasters of these fratricidal battle-fields, yet\r\ntruth and justice and conviction extort from me the avowal that I hope\r\nthe South will be successful in beating back from their own rightfully\r\ndefended soil this most fatal and iniquitous invasion; and for this\r\nsentiment, though it may be the extreme of treason, I am willing to\r\nstand responsible before God and man.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my dear old fellow, whether you now go with me the full\r\nlength of my opinions, or whether I may have to regret, as a sensible\r\naddition to all the rest of my present affliction, that we no longer\r\nstand united in our old accord of sentiments. _Eadem sentire de re\r\npublica._ Just as I would have shouldered a Northern rifle to unite in\r\nthe defence of Washington against menaced invasion from the South, so\r\nwould I now, were I at home, stand up in aid of the rightful defence\r\nof the Southern soil against this equally unjustifiable invasion from\r\nthe North; and this, were I on that side of the Atlantic, or were it\r\npossible for me to get there, I would do, unless I could do better\r\nservice to the cause of the right by speaking, writing, and acting for\r\nit at the North. It is only the foolish and mad co-operation of the\r\ndeluded Democracy that has enabled the Republican administration to\r\nundertake this war, and now enables it to carry it on. In that sense\r\nthe Democratic party is, though secondarily, as much responsible for it\r\nas the Republicans. If it were now to draw back and insist on peace, it\r\nhas the power to enforce that policy. This is what I would labor for,\r\nand it is with a view to this that I have written to urge my views upon\r\nyou and upon the public, so far as you may have consented to publish my\r\nletters, every word of which I should be glad to see in the columns of\r\nthe _News_ or of the _Day Book_.\r\n\r\n  \"Ever faithfully Yours,\r\n                     \"J.

He nor the rest\r\nof the Cabinet have any administrative ability, nor any comprehension\r\nof the immensity of the crisis. They are all governed by a narrow\r\npolicy, and are so intent upon personal objects that the higher duties\r\nof the citizens are made subordinate in this emergency of a nation's\r\nlife to the success of the partisan.\r\n\r\n\"Seward is the great failure, but he is egotistical, false, flippant,\r\ngrotesque as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Chase is equally vain and selfish, but more just, behind a rampart of\r\ndogmatic egotism. Of the rest it is unnecessary to speak, but of Blair,\r\nwho is the weakest and most mischievous of the whole set.\r\n\r\n\"We are in the presence of mighty events, and under the rule of pigmies.\r\n\r\n\"Our foreign relations are in a critical condition, while Seward has\r\nnot the grasp to comprehend nor direct them.\r\n\r\n\"The maladministration of the War and Navy depts. is in full force,\r\nwhile corrupt odors are continually exhaled.\r\n\r\n\"The army is in a disaffected, disorganized, discouraged condition, and\r\nnot in good trim for service, chiefly through the utter incapacity of\r\nCameron.\r\n\r\n\"The expenses are a million a day, which will not be patiently borne,\r\nno matter who the people are, without corresponding results.\r\n\r\n\"There is a feeling of gloomy dread in the public mind here of coming\r\nmisfortune, and let me ask you what will be the effect upon the public\r\nopinion of the North if this city should be taken. The enemy is in\r\ngreat force, daily increasing, victorious, defiant, and in spirit and\r\ncondition to be aggressive. If he does not soon attack the capital he\r\nwill be restrained only by prudential or political considerations.\r\n\r\n\"The North may as well, however, look that probable event square in\r\nthe face. Thus, after a rule of five months of this wretched Cabinet,\r\nwith a great nation supporting it, with imperial resources at command,\r\napproved and animated by a self-sacrificing patriotism rarely equalled,\r\nwe are disgraced, dishonored before the world, and scarcely in a\r\ncondition to act bravely on the defensive. Soon France and England may\r\ninterfere, and then, pray, what is our condition?\r\n\r\n\"You will probably remember what I said at our first meeting at the\r\nhotel of the strength and resources of the South, and of the incapacity\r\nof this Cabinet to grapple with the palpitating hearts.\r\n\r\n\"I am no prophet, but it seems as if we are only approaching a mighty\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\"I am mortified and humiliated that the great, brave American people\r\nhave such representatives at the head of their government.\r\n\r\n\"For what are we fighting? Congress has no voice, except of adulation\r\nfor political paramours, and this quailing, squirming Cabinet is dumb.\r\n\r\n\"I have never even seen Lincoln.

Banks, it is said, has been\r\nordered to advance his lines nearer the Potomac. McClellan is doing as\r\nwell as he can--has good administrative ability. 'Tis said the lines\r\nare widening between him and Scott. Scott is infirm, and falls asleep\r\nat a brief talk.

The\r\nproclamation was issued and distributed in Accomac before I sent copies\r\nto the President and Genl. McClellan. On a few important occasions in\r\nlife I have acted without consulting any one. Where my convictions have\r\nbeen so strong as to give me an undoubting assurance that I was right,\r\nI have fore-borne to consult others for fear they might differ with me.\r\nI do not know that Genl. McClellan approves all I have done. I am not\r\nsure as to the President, though I think he regards my policy as the\r\ntrue remedy for the special phase of the malady of secession, which\r\nexisted on the eastern shore of Virginia. Whether he will regard it as\r\nthe proper treatment for other phases of the disease I do not know. If\r\nour madmen in Congress, when everything is prospering, adopt Sumner's\r\nmiserable scheme of emancipation or John Cochrane's diabolical project\r\nof arming slaves against their masters, all hope of a pacification will\r\nbe at an end. Kentucky, I fear, will instantly array herself on the\r\nside of the Confederates.

They will go among you as friends, and\r\nwith the earnest hope that they may not, by your own acts, be forced to\r\nbecome your enemies. They will invade no rights of person or property.\r\nOn the contrary, your laws, your institutions, your usages, will be\r\nscrupulously respected.

TILDEN\r\n\r\nMr. John Van Buren, who had become an earnest supporter of the war,\r\njust before he made a speech at a great Democratic meeting in the city\r\nof New York, in October, 1862, called upon Mr. Tilden.\r\n\r\n\"We must be for the war,\" said Mr. Van Buren.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Tilden.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren showed a letter from General Scott, in which he proposed\r\nto \"let our erring sisters depart in peace.\" Mr. Van Buren could not\r\nresist the temptation of making an oratorical point upon the letter of\r\nthe great military chieftain, and read it to the meeting. An audience\r\napplauds point more than reason. Mr. Van Buren was an orator who\r\nsported with the tumultuous sympathies of a popular assembly, as a\r\ndaring horseman rides a fiery steed. In the action and reaction between\r\nthe speaker and the auditors, Mr. Van Buren, contrary to his intention,\r\nwas carried into some seeming indulgence towards General Scott's idea.\r\nThe impression was not satisfactory to his friends or to the leaders of\r\nthe Democratic party.\r\n\r\nAt a casual meeting, at which were present Mr. Dean Richmond, the\r\nchairman of the Democratic State Committee, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Jones,\r\nthe Democratic candidates for Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, Mr.\r\nTilden was consulted. He disapproved the aspect in which the last\r\nmeeting had left the matter, and suggested that, as Mr. Seymour was\r\nto speak in Brooklyn on the evening of the next day, he should at the\r\nclose of his speech make a more correct and an authoritative statement\r\nof the Democratic position in respect to the war.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden was requested to reduce to writing what he suggested should\r\nbe said. The next morning, on his way down-town, he left with Mr.\r\nSeymour a sketch of a peroration for the speech to be made that evening.\r\n\r\nIt was in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"And now, if my voice could reach the Southern people, through the\r\njournals of our metropolis, I would say to them that in no event can\r\nthe triumph of the conservative sentiment of New York in the election\r\nmean consent to disunion, either now or hereafter. Its true import is\r\nrestoration, North and South, of that Constitution which had secured\r\nevery right, and under whose shelter all had been happy and prosperous\r\nuntil you madly fled from its protection. It was your act which began\r\nthis calamitous civil war. It was your act which disabled us, as we are\r\nnow disabled, of shaping the policy or limiting the objects of that\r\nwar. Loyally as we maintained your rights, will we maintain the right\r\nof the government. We will not strike down its arm as long as yours is\r\nlifted against it. That noblest and greatest work of our wise ancestors\r\nis not destined to perish. We intend to rear once more upon the old\r\nand firm foundations its shattered columns, and to carry them higher\r\ntowards the eternal skies. If the old flag waves in the nerveless\r\ngrasp of a fanatic but feeble faction to whom you and not we abandoned\r\nit, we, whose courage you have tried when we stood unmoved between\r\nfanaticism and folly from the North and South alike, will once more\r\nbear it onward and aloft until it is again planted upon the towers of\r\nthe Constitution, invincible by domestic as by foreign enemies. Within\r\nthe Union we will give you the Constitution you profess to revere,\r\nrenewed with fresh guarantees of equal rights and equal safety. We will\r\ngive you everything that local self-government demands; everything that\r\na common ancestry of glory--everything that national fraternity or\r\nChristian fellowship requires; but to dissolve the federal bond between\r\nthese States, to dismember our country, whoever else consents, we will\r\nnot.

I wish it could be read by all\r\nreflective men of the old Union. Until we act upon the theories there\r\ndeveloped, our country must submit to the evils which error has brought\r\nupon us. More fatal delusions never led mankind than guide the party in\r\npower. Until they give place to reason, sound sense, and honesty there\r\nwill be no relief.\r\n\r\n\"In one of the addresses issued by the executive committee here, in\r\n1860, prepared by me, there is a prediction of the fatal consequences\r\nof elevating to power a representative of the principles of those\r\nwho nominated Lincoln. I was, it is true, unwilling to believe what\r\nmy reason told me was inevitably true. But I felt bound to proclaim\r\nthe convictions resulting from much reflection. But our countrymen\r\nwere mad, and like mad men would heed no warning. The fatal error was\r\ncommitted, the consequences of which no one can calculate. But you, at\r\nleast, are not responsible for the result. You did all that one man\r\ncould do to direct to the path of safety.

I\r\nhave so much confidence in your good judgment, as well as command of\r\nlarge business interests, that it has occurred to me whether some sort\r\nof professional connection could not be established between us to our\r\nmutual advantage. You must have at times more than you can attend to,\r\nand, besides, will find it necessary to consult your health and allow\r\nyourself more leisure. On the other hand, my health is pretty firm,\r\nand my disposition to labor unabated. I make the suggestion for your\r\nconsideration, and shall accept in the best feeling any suggestions\r\nyou make, whether I suppose them to tend to my interest or not.

Under this appropriation, the New York State\r\nSoldiers' Depot has been established and located at Nos. 50 and 52\r\nHoward Street, New York, and we beg to call your attention to the\r\nobjects of the institution, and to solicit your co-operation in\r\ncarrying them into effect.\r\n\r\n\"The board of managers consists of the Adjutant-General of the\r\nState, the Inspector-General, the Surgeon-General, and the\r\nQuartermaster-General, and their action is subject to the supervision\r\nof the Governor.\r\n\r\n\"The depot is a spacious building, containing every convenience for the\r\naccommodation, health, and comfort of the inmates. Food and lodgings\r\nare furnished to them free of charge; they are washed and cleansed,\r\nand provided with clean underclothing and with transportation to their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n\"The sick and wounded enter the hospital department and receive careful\r\nmedical treatment until in a condition to be forwarded to their\r\nresidences. If any die at the depot, their remains are transmitted to\r\ntheir friends. The system of station agents and train couriers adopted\r\nby the board effectually protects the returning soldiers from robbery,\r\nimposition and vice.\r\n\r\n\"It is unnecessary to dwell upon the advantages of such an institution.\r\n\r\n\"It secures immediate relief to the suffering and needy men who return\r\nsick, wounded, and penniless from the war. It removes those who\r\npossess health and money out of the reach of the temptations of the\r\ncity, and protects them from the impositions so generally practised\r\nupon returning soldiers, who are specially marked as the prey of the\r\ndishonest. Its effect will be to induce re-enlistments, for it will\r\nprove to the volunteer that the State will not forget or neglect those\r\nwho fight in defence of their country.\r\n\r\n\"The board of managers, being desirous of having the advice of some of\r\ntheir fellow-citizens in the prosecution of their work, have concluded\r\nto form an advisory committee.

I do not expect to go\r\nto the city again before Monday. I have read the city ordinance. After\r\nmuch reflection, it seems to me that there are two or three modes of\r\nraising the legal question; and I take it for granted that the State\r\nauthorities, if the draft is pressed, will act only in support of\r\ntheir own judicial process. Does not the jurisdiction of our Supreme\r\nCourt, in General Term, admit of a writ of prohibition, to be applied\r\nfor on the ground that certain persons, etc., are about to enroll,\r\nsummon, and subject to martial law A. B. and C. D., citizens of New\r\nYork and members of its militia, etc., etc.? This would avoid all\r\ndifficulty about the _hab. corpus_. If it be said that a prohibition\r\nout of a State court cannot control a Federal officer, I think it is\r\nsufficiently answered if the prohibition is founded on the allegation\r\nthat the Federal officer is undertaking to act under color of a law\r\nconstitutionally invalid. The process and the case may be afterwards\r\ndrawn into the Federal judicial power for revision. But it may issue\r\nand may be served, and then there is a legal process and not a mere\r\nforcible resistance.\r\n\r\n\"The Federal court, too, has probably the same jurisdiction, although I\r\nhave not the means here of looking at that.

Its fall will exhilarate\r\nthe abolitionists by the assurance it will appear to justify, of the\r\nopposition to extreme measures, and the inability of the conservatives\r\nof the country to sustain a journal at the seat of government opposed\r\nto radicalism, and practically confirm the standing and increase the\r\ninfluence of the radical press here, while it will deprive the country\r\nof a tried and faithful watchman on the walls of the citadel whose\r\nvery presence intimidates from a surrender of the bulwarks of the\r\nConstitution and the constitutional union. Shall this be? Will the\r\nwealthy, patriotic, conservative men of New York quietly permit such\r\nan advantage to be gained by their destructive adversaries, and suffer\r\nto be lost what holds out such a prospect and guarantee of usefulness\r\nand necessity to them when a comparatively small effort may avert such\r\na catastrophe? In view of the depressing effect which the stoppage of\r\nsuch a paper at this juncture will produce on National men North and\r\nSouth and their cause, and the advantages which will inure therefrom\r\nto the sectionalists, cannot some good men of New York make up a loan\r\nto the establishment of a few thousand dollars, which will give it\r\nstability and independence thro' the rest of this year, when it is to\r\nbe hoped a new era will open, thereby maintaining an important element\r\nof power for good, in bringing about a reasonable and happy settlement\r\nof our difficulties when the force of arms shall have accomplished its\r\nwork. Will these good people of New York allow this old and influential\r\njournal of more than half a century's standing to go down for defending\r\ntheir cause against the destructive policy of the radicals, and when,\r\nif it go down, the conservatives will have to make greater sacrifices\r\nin establishing another in its stead which must be long in acquiring\r\nthe same confidence and power of usefulness? These are questions which\r\nmust be determined in a few days, or the capital be left without a\r\npaper representing and upholding national views and the country be\r\ndeprived of a faithful journal, which can be relied on, regardless of\r\ngovernment favor, and continue to do its duty to the people unawed by\r\npower though it perish in the struggle.\r\n\r\n\"The amount, if supplied, may be deemed _and made_ a lien on the\r\nestablishment and apply as a credit on its purchase hereafter, or may\r\nbe _a loan_ to be secured by deed of trust thereon.\r\n\r\n\"I have stated facts, with no personal interest to advance other than\r\nas my welfare is identified with the honor and prosperity of the\r\ncountry and the integrity of the Union and the preservation of law\r\nand order.

I now very much doubt\r\nif it will be resorted to. A _habeas corpus_ before a single judge on\r\nthe receipt of notice, which constitutes a technical custody, seems to\r\nme preferable.\r\n\r\n\"The draft, in the mean time, is going on and, I confess, I am puzzled\r\nby the apathy with which it is received, especially in connection with\r\nthe admitted fact that New York and probably New Jersey are to be\r\nexempt. Still, I think there will be an outbreak whenever the actual\r\nkidnapping begins.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you see or think you see the dangers which threaten you\r\nmore clearly than we at a distance do. But the apprehension is very\r\nprevalent here that Gov. Seymour is in danger at any moment of secret\r\narrest. Things of that kind have been hinted at, and certainly I saw\r\nnothing in New York to make such an outrage practically difficult.\r\nThere is inducement enough, for his removal puts the whole Democratic\r\nNorth under the heel of the radicals. My theory about arrests is that\r\nthey are always fatal. No public man ever recovered from the stain\r\nthey seem to inflict. I doubt very much if Mr. Vallandigham will ever\r\nrecuperate. Gov. Seymour is the only public man who at this moment\r\nstands in the way of a centralized despotism, and him a small guard of\r\nFederal soldiers could easily and secretly remove.\r\n\r\n\"I am, no doubt, very nervous and very suspicious, but, I assure you,\r\nthese facts are not confined to my own bosom.\r\n\r\n                             \"Very Truly Y'rs,\r\n                                               \"WILLIAM B.

It came on my return from an absence from the\r\ncity, followed immediately by another; and then by an illness which\r\nwholly disabled me for a week, and from which I emerged only after the\r\ncommencement of the riot, and that brought upon me many demands for\r\nattention and counsel amid ten days of excitement and bustle. I turn to\r\nit as actually the first real business of my own to which I have had a\r\nchance to attend for some weeks, indeed, since the 4th of July, when\r\nI had begun an answer, until now. I came here Saturday evening, and\r\nexpect to return to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n\"How swiftly events move, and how greatly they change! I am reminded,\r\nas I see by what I began to write, how deeply a few weeks ago I was\r\ninvolved in solicitude for the results of the military operations then\r\nreaching their crisis. At no time since this war commenced have I been\r\nso disturbed as before the battle of Gettysburg; a different issue\r\nof which might, in my judgment, have put us on our defence even as\r\nfar as Phila. and New York, and brought a revolution in our thoughts\r\nand occupations, and since that New York has been upon the verge of a\r\nsocial peril, at that time wholly unexpected.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate the frank and cordial spirit of your letter, and shall\r\nstate my own impressions in the same confidence which you express that\r\nour long knowledge of each other will, at least, secure us a perfect\r\nmutual understanding. I say impressions, for I am conscious that all\r\nmy views of the future, for myself, and for all others in whom I take\r\ninterest, may be colored by the peculiar uncertainties which now\r\nenshroud our horizon.\r\n\r\n\"1. While I think it proper for you to keep your eye upon the\r\nopportunity of forming a future business in New York, I doubt if you\r\ncan prudently abandon your present sure and honorable position, or\r\ncan count with sufficient certainty upon events to enter at present\r\ninto definite engagements of so much importance to your interests\r\nand happiness. I think you will remember in all our conversations a\r\ndisposition on my part (arising, perhaps, from the habitual caution\r\nwhich my views of public events inspire) to contemplate such a change\r\nin your affairs as taking effect after the close of your present term\r\nof official service.\r\n\r\n\"I think, if the battle of Gettysburg had happened to be such a\r\ndisaster to us as is always possible in the vicissitudes of war,\r\nbusiness in New York would have been for the time, and how long a time\r\nI know not, suspended. Who can compute the consequences of the loss\r\nof Washington, Baltimore, and, perhaps, Philadelphia? Nor can I be\r\ninsensible to the social disorders to which great cities are exposed\r\nduring such civil convulsions as our country is now undergoing.\r\n\r\n\"You are at present sure of a livelihood by a tenure and in a\r\ngeographical position which are not affected by the military,\r\npolitical, or financial vicissitudes to which all business in the city\r\nof New York is exposed, and which might fall with peculiar severity\r\nupon a newly formed enterprise--undertaken in reliance upon profits\r\nwhich any of these causes might render illusory, and amid expenses\r\nwhich city life and city business inevitably involve. Under these\r\ncircumstances I hope you will not consider it officious if I express\r\nthe opinion that it would be wiser for you, holding to your present\r\ncertainty, to await events which can scarcely fail to shift greatly, if\r\nnot frequently, before a decision can be practically forced upon you.\r\n\r\n\"2. I agree with you that after the war shall have closed the city of\r\nNew York will afford scope for business corresponding to the revivified\r\ninterests of the country; but I agree with this qualification--that\r\nit can hardly be that the transition can be made, changing, as it\r\nwill, the application of labor and enterprise from one set of objects\r\nto another, without a shock of more or less duration, and that the\r\nretirement by any process of the paper issues may be expected to\r\nproduce a period of constantly increasing depression. It will be after\r\nthis that, with its metropolitan character more than ever assured, New\r\nYork will return to a state of healthy prosperity, if its position as\r\nthe trade centre of all the States be preserved.\r\n\r\n\"3. In respect to myself. I am not sure that the advantages of a\r\nprofessional connection with me would be as great as might naturally be\r\nexpected. It has been the general opinion of the profession that a mere\r\ncounsel business, of large extent and income, could not be permanently\r\nkept up. So far as I have succeeded in doing this, my experience may\r\nhave been exceptional. I have years ago abandoned all ideas of regular\r\nclientage, and could scarcely see any reason why my business should\r\nnot much diminish, perhaps almost dry up, with the completion of that\r\npending at the time. The substitution of mere business--easy to be\r\ndeputed, regular in its flow, and almost formal in its nature, which is\r\nthe basis of large profits in the general experience of the bar--I have\r\nnot had, possibly because I had not the organization in my office to\r\ndo it, and could not do it myself without abandoning the part to which\r\nI have devoted myself. If ten years ago I had provided for it what it\r\nmight have grown to is a matter of conjecture. It is now too late for\r\nme to undertake the labor, care or responsibility, or even to acquire\r\nthe disposition to construct such a business. How far, in lessening my\r\nactive connection with affairs of the peculiar nature mine has become,\r\nI could transfer would be doubtful. Indeed, it would seem to me that\r\nsome species which have occupied half of my attention for five years\r\npast are likely to disappear.\r\n\r\n\"4. Some years ago I had two suggestions of what seemed to be very\r\nflattering connections. One of them was of several intimate friends,\r\nwho thought we could combine and build up a larger concern than ever\r\nexisted in this city. I assented to that opinion, but shrank from\r\nassuming obligations and necessities which could not be practically\r\nterminable at my own choice. Uncertain how long health would permit\r\nor necessity require the efforts I was then making, or how long a\r\ndisposition to continue them would survive the immediate occasion for\r\nthem, I felt that I should unavoidably part with the perfect freedom\r\nof my choice if I allowed friends to build their calculations upon\r\nme--that no reservation I could make would exempt me from a sense that\r\nwhat I might prefer to do would disappoint or damage those with whom I\r\nhad entered into the joint undertaking.\r\n\r\n\"In the interval these motives for keeping free from all connections\r\nhave strengthened, while all motives to form them have nearly ceased.\r\nThe necessities of that day have been fulfilled. My health requires\r\nan exemption for a time of more or less duration, from the cares\r\nwhich would attend any new engagements, or, indeed, the thought\r\nwhether or not business is to continue. Everything that I could\r\nendeavor to foresee, whether personal, as health, taste, my remaining\r\nhere or travelling to Europe or to the far West, or whether public,\r\nas financial or political events amid the civil commotions of our\r\ncountry--everything, in a word, which could ordinarily form the subject\r\nof calculation, seems to be more uncertain than ever before. My\r\nhabit, therefore, in all things--I scarcely know whether it comes of\r\ndisposition or of judgment--is to make no plans at present, except such\r\nas are inevitable; to await events, and to keep myself as prepared as\r\npossible to act, free from engagements and even from predeterminations\r\nof my own mind, according to the changing phases of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"I have thus, my dear sir, unveiled to you more of my private affairs\r\nand thoughts than, perhaps, are known to any other person; for I have\r\nwritten them as if we were talking together, writing my ideas as they\r\narose, without much method or care.\r\n\r\n\"Please consider them as confidential, and excuse the haste with which\r\nthey are expressed and the length to which my letter has grown.

I am satisfied it\r\nmeans to go on in a spirit of hostility to this State; that it is\r\ngoverned by a spirit of malice in all things small and great. I do not\r\nbelieve they will accept volunteers on account of the draft. Let it be\r\nso. I am willing to accept results. This conscription will make the\r\nadministration odious and contemptible. It will fail as a measure to\r\nraise men. I do not take into account forcible resistance which will\r\naid rather than embarrass government. It will break down because it is\r\nimpossible to coerce a people. Some will commute, some will run away;\r\nmany will prove disabilities, and a few will go, enough, perhaps, to\r\ndemoralize the army. I have sent a communication to the President,\r\nwritten in calm and respectful terms, objecting:\r\n\r\n\"1. To the fairness of the movement.\r\n\r\n\"2. To the policy of conscription.\r\n\r\n\"3.

He would\r\nbe gratified to see you. The object which he seeks to accomplish--the\r\ncontinuance of the _Nat.

Should that paper be permitted to go down there will be\r\na very large number of respectable and influential persons in this\r\ncountry left as sheep without a shepherd. They will have lost the\r\nleader which they have been accustomed to follow, and whose voice they\r\nknow, for many years.\r\n\r\n\"I pray you put forth vigorous and prompt efforts to prevent such a\r\nresult.

FAY\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _March 24, 1864_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--An absence from the city and the occupations preparatory\r\nto it have deferred my acknowledgment of your letter longer than I\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\"In respect to the first topic of your letter, although we both agree\r\nin considering it practically past, the desire I have that the real\r\nstate of facts should be completely understood by you induces me to add\r\na word to our former discussions.\r\n\r\n\"As nearly as I can now recollect, the misunderstanding occurred about\r\nthe time, I think even before, my action in respect to the Peninsula\r\nwas decided. The false relation between Mr. Ogden and you with the\r\nimpressions which such of our friends as occasionally met Mr. Parsons\r\nderived from him repelled overtures to you. Mr. O. always said that he\r\nthought he could satisfy you, but doubted and deferred.\r\n\r\n\"There never was a moment when I did not desire to communicate with\r\nyou; but my acquaintance was so slight that I thought it necessary to\r\nwait for others, until at last I forced a breaking of the ice, and our\r\ninterview took place.\r\n\r\n\"But enough of this. I should not recur to the topic if I had not a\r\ngreat respect for you. The past is gone. We can deal only with the\r\npresent. That is within our powers. I do not think that, on the whole,\r\nwe cannot now do nearly as well as if we had done what was best at\r\nfirst. For myself, I have so often felt your reproach for having\r\nomitted to promote our understanding, so capable of benefits to both\r\nsides, that I am determined as to the present and the future, which\r\nalone are in our power--that the boot shall be on the other leg.\r\n\r\n\"Coming now to what is the really important part of your letter--put\r\nafter the fashion of the ladies in the P. S.--it must be admitted that\r\nif you should meditate anything more than a mere _sale_ on the best\r\nsecurity--anything approaching in part to a sharing of the common joys\r\nand sorrows of the adventure--the future policy of Peninsular company,\r\nin the particulars mentioned by you, would be an important matter.\r\n\r\n\"I think that policy will be, whether in your society or out of it,\r\n_conservative_ to your heart's content.\r\n\r\n\"It would, no doubt, be very desirable to have the terminus of the\r\nPeninsular at Escanaba or Sand Point connected with Green Bay by rail.\r\nWhat we can do on that point, and what we cannot, has been definitely\r\nannounced to Mr. Ogden and others by me assuming to speak for the very\r\nsolid gentlemen who are the principal owners of the Peninsular.\r\n\r\n\"If the Northwestern will build that road we shall be glad. We do not\r\nbelieve the difficulty of operating it in the winter is any more real\r\nthan it was supposed to be from Boston to Albany or from Piermont to\r\nDunkirk twenty years ago; or as much so as on the Chicago and St. Louis\r\nin 1856. There will be a telegraph to Marquette in a few months. An\r\nall-rail line to that point would revolutionize the region.\r\n\r\n\"If the N. W. needs the privileges of our charter or the land grant\r\nwhich attaches to the portion of the line from Escanaba to the\r\nMenominee, we ought to accord them so that we incur no pecuniary\r\nliability for the construction or operation of the line.\r\n\r\n\"If the N. W. needs that we consent to a modification of the drawback\r\nwhich it is to allow us on its whole 242 miles for joint business that\r\ncomes to or from the Peninsula--we may do that.\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot dilute our present investment by what will be inferior,\r\nthough incidentally very desirable to us; or enlarge our undertaking\r\nfrom what we know to be completely within our means, of which we have\r\nmeasured the cost, and except to a very subordinate extent fixed it by\r\npurchases and contracts. If any of us aid the line south by taking an\r\ninterest in it, it will be as a separate adventure.\r\n\r\n\"Not only has this been our uniform answer to such suggestions, but\r\nour present mortgage expressly excludes any extensions south from its\r\nprovisions in favor of extensions north.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to extensions north, our policy would be not less provident. We\r\nmust feel our way, accepting only what will surely be remunerative and\r\nnot diluting our investment.\r\n\r\n\"So much in answer to your letter.\r\n\r\n\"Now a few words in addition on the general subject.\r\n\r\n\"1. Separately, our charges can scarcely fail to be affected 25 cents\r\nby the mutual fear of competition, alleviated as much as possible. That\r\nall comes from the profits on 300,000 tons; it is the interest on a\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\"2. In a state of paper-money prices, advancing constantly because\r\nof increasing issues, we can protect ourselves only by making rates\r\ncorrespond with daily increasing expenses.\r\n\r\n\"This is not apt to be done with sufficient promptitude and boldness.\r\n\r\n\"You will be and we shall be timid and laggard in meeting the\r\nexigencies which are before us--from fear of competition and from the\r\ndelay which always attends arrangements between independent parties.\r\n\r\n\"3. We should better our condition as to our land grants if our efforts\r\nwere joined. We could do so at the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\n\"There are other considerations which I have not time to discuss.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary to arrive at results as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\"1. Some important construction we have deferred to await the\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n\"2. We shall soon have to decide important questions which would be\r\naffected very materially by the junction of our interests. Of course,\r\nwe are not so improvident as to act now on the hypothesis of successful\r\nnegotiations between us.\r\n\r\n\"Our construction is advancing well. We have sent up 400 additional men\r\nsince Feb. 1. We still strain every nerve for completion June 1. None\r\nof our managers in the West fear that it will be much later. I assure\r\nyou that in this respect and in all respects our affairs were never so\r\npromising as now. I express my strong desire to form a junction of our\r\ninterests as frankly as if you did not represent the other party to the\r\nnegotiation; for, while attending carefully to everything necessary to\r\nour independent existence, I see that it can still be bettered by the\r\nmeasure contemplated. There is no mistake so common among business men\r\nas to suppose that what one gains another loses. I have just had an\r\nillustration of this in making in behalf of the bondholders of the Fort\r\nWayne a counter proposition to that of the stockholders under which the\r\nstock rose 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"It is important to all interests that a conclusion be arrived at as\r\nsoon as possible. When you are in a situation to negotiate definitely,\r\nwith full powers, I shall be glad to discuss and also to submit\r\nsuggestions, and shall be ready to conclude arrangements, if any be\r\nfound practicable.\r\n\r\n\"Please excuse the rambling haste in which I write.\r\n\r\n                                \"I remain,\r\n                                    \"Very truly,\r\n                                           \"Your friend,\r\n                                                  \"S.

FAY\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _April 8th, 1864_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 4th was duly received.\r\n\r\n\"In reference to your conclusion that there is 'no difficulty in\r\narranging some mode of sale but _price_,' I agree that it is justified\r\nby the general correspondence of our views as to the utility of uniting\r\nthe two lines and as to the policy which should govern the management\r\nof the joint concern. Doubtless your mind has truly fixed the precise\r\npoint at which divergence of sentiments would be natural, and where\r\nalone it is likely to exist.\r\n\r\n\"But is such divergence inevitable even there? Is there not some\r\nsolution which will give us what we agree in desiring--the unity of\r\nworks and interests, and will yet allow scope enough for the favorable\r\nview by each party of the relative value of its own property?\r\n\r\n\"Financial expedients are so capable of adaptation, and I have so often\r\nbeen fortunate in bringing into accord interests and opinions which\r\nseemed to the parties to clash, that, seeing an object desirable to\r\nus both obstructed or delayed, I am disposed at once to analyze the\r\nelements of difference, and try if there be not some solution equally\r\nadvantageous and equally agreeable to the parties whom we respectively\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\n\"I know I shall bring to the attempt candor in considering what I may\r\nnot at first accept, and an entire freedom from the huckstering spirit\r\nwhich seeks to appropriate all benefits of a concord which ought to be\r\nfounded upon mutual interests. I do not doubt that you will meet me in\r\nthe same dispositions.\r\n\r\n\"I mentioned in my former letter some of the evils of delay--the loss\r\nof the present session of Congress in respect to our land grants (we\r\nshould want Mr. Morgan as our regular attorney to join his efforts to\r\nour special and temporary agent if we were together), the tendency to\r\nreduce or keep down the prices for our transportation services, from\r\nthe natural operation of divided action, to be aggravated perhaps when\r\nour agents come to seek business, the probability of some unnecessary\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\"You have justly added the inconvenience of extending over the region a\r\ndiversity of gauges, every day becoming more difficult to change.\r\n\r\n\"And I now add still another consideration. The delay--perhaps\r\nindefinite postponement of the construction of the link from Green Bay\r\nto the place, lately Sand Point, which we have christened Escanaba.\r\nThat construction would connect the mineral regions of Lake Superior\r\nwith the entire railroad system of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Now, in these times so favorable to get money for new enterprises,\r\nif the opportunity is _seized_ and _wisely used_, I think if we were\r\nunited, our joint strength would induce the Northwestern to put in that\r\nlink this year if the question could be determined within the next 30\r\ndays. There are auxiliary influences, potent at this moment, which may\r\nbe lost and the result postponed for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\n\"I am confident that such a construction would enlist the warmest\r\nsympathies of yourself, of Mr. Ely, and of all who have investments\r\nin the Lake Superior region. It would probably create, likewise, new\r\nopportunities for investments, capable of surviving the financial shock\r\nto which all property will be subjected by the present condition of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"But I wander into discussions, when the object with which I began my\r\nhasty letter was simply to say to you that I think we ought to have\r\na personal conference without unnecessary delay--that we ought to be\r\npossessed of the purposes of our respective parties, and armed with\r\nfull powers to act, if not for all, at least for a majority in interest\r\nof our respective companies.\r\n\r\n\"I will meet you in Boston or in this city at your earliest\r\nconvenience, having a little notice to arrange my engagements. My\r\nsituation would make me prefer New York, if your convenience would\r\nallow or you could be induced into a visit to your friends here.\r\n\r\n                               \"Very truly,\r\n                                        \"Your Friend,\r\n                                                  \"S.

You will\r\nbe entitled to the information, advice, and aid which Wetmore shall be\r\nable to give.\r\n\r\n\"You must represent the company and act in all cases where it is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"2. _Information._ We need direct and frequent communications with the\r\nCliff Co.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Curtis will have more time than the rest, and his occupations will\r\nbe more regular. He should write _twice a week_, giving information as\r\nto all matters concerning the operations of the co., the no. of men,\r\nthe preparations to accommodate them, the work going on, etc.\r\n\r\n\"From you I should like to hear as often as you are able.\r\n\r\n\"Communications should be addressed S. J. Tilden, 12 Wall St., New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n\"3. Col. Foster left Mr. Ray in charge of the Tilden and Foster mines;\r\nMr. Foote in charge of the Ogden; Mr. Curtis managing the accounts\r\nand finances, and Mr. Whitehead conducting explorations; and these\r\ngentlemen, all in the main, independent of each other.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be surprised if disorganization does not develop the want of a\r\n_head_ to enforce accountability and to govern and direct.\r\n\r\n\"For the time being you must assume and exercise whatever powers seem\r\nto be necessary in order to keep harmony between all these different\r\nauthorities, and to see that all are working well.\r\n\r\n\"=> Whether we shall need a _mining_ head, independently of these\r\ngentlemen, is a question upon which, after you have studied them, and\r\nthe working of the business, I should like your opinion. It may be that\r\na general business head will be all that will be required, and that Mr.\r\nRay and Mr. Foote will get along well in their respective departments.\r\nOr it may be that some man like Mr. Merry or Mr. Ferguson will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\"Between us, Mr. Merry told me, just before I left, that he wished me\r\nto bear in mind that he expected to be with us next year. Mr. Stewart,\r\nof the Jackson Co., rather complained to Col. Foster that Mr. Ogden had\r\ninterfered with them in respect to Merry.\r\n\r\n\"I mention the state of things that you may be advised of the actual\r\nstate of the case, and may be considering what information and advice\r\nyou can give me.\r\n\r\n\"As to Mr. Curtis--he was engaged by Col. Foster as a sort of cashier\r\nwhen the former was about leaving without our having much knowledge\r\nor experience in respect to him. I have been to see Mr. Booth, who\r\nrecommended him, and get the best accounts as to his trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n\"Whether we can hereafter enlarge his functions will depend upon how\r\nhis capacities shall develop in the experience of our business.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time he should be required to _organize_ our _accounts_,\r\ntake an inventory of all materials and supplies sent up for the use\r\nof the company, keep a record of their use, and be able to account\r\nfor them; open an account with each mine, and enable us to know that\r\nall the expenditures of each are proper, keeping a sort of financial\r\nsupervision over their operations; corresponding with us, and keeping\r\nus advised of everything which is going on.\r\n\r\n\"Col. Foster informs me that he instructed Ray and Foote to send here a\r\nreport each week of their doings.\r\n\r\n\"=> Consult with Mr. Wetmore and give me your views as to\r\n\r\n\"(1) What is necessary for the sale of ore and the management of\r\ntransportation at Cleveland or elsewhere; study the organization of the\r\nother companies; see whether it is best, etc.\r\n\r\n\"(2) What will be necessary at Escanaba.\r\n\r\n\"(3) Whether anything further will be necessary at the mines.\r\n\r\n\"5. It will be quite necessary for us to have the branch to the Cliff\r\nmines and the extension to the Cleveland done, and all the road in good\r\nrunning order.\r\n\r\n\"6. It is very desirable that we have this winter the benefit of a\r\ntelegraphic communication with the Cliff mines.\r\n\r\n\"It is equally necessary for the Peninsular railroad. And for that--but\r\n_especially for the Northwestern_--a winter road from Escanaba to Green\r\nBay is important.\r\n\r\n\"7. For the Iron Cliff mines see that all necessary supplies are\r\nprovided; see Ray and Foote on this subject, and have them closely\r\ninterrogated that nothing may be overlooked; Mr. Merry would aid with\r\nall his experience in making provisions for winter work, and Mr.\r\nWetmore will also have much information on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"8. In respect to any question requiring experience in working mines,\r\nMr. Merry was good enough to say he would aid Mr. Ray (who is his\r\nbrother-in-law) and us generally. You can have recourse to him, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"9. It is thought that at the Ogden mine (Foote) accommodations ought\r\nto be made for at least 50 men; and at the Tilden mine for 100 men.\r\n\r\n\"This is for immediate operations, looking, of course, to enlargement\r\nas fast as possible.\r\n\r\n\"10. I intended to write to you on the subject of furnaces, but must\r\ndefer that subject to a future occasion.\r\n\r\n\"=> Please advise me of the condition of the Peninsular R. R., and give\r\nme what information you can as to the mines, dock, branches, etc.\r\n\r\n\"One of the most serious inconveniences attending the construction of\r\nthe Peninsular--all through--has been the want of regular information\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n                               \"Truly Yours,\r\n                                                  \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_S. C. Baldwin, Esq._\"\r\n\r\nCharles P. Daly commenced his public career as a member of the New York\r\nState Assembly soon after his admission to the bar. From the Assembly\r\nhe was appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas, which position he\r\ncontinued to hold by re-election until he was retired by age. Meantime\r\nhe had been prominent in founding the New York Geographical Society, of\r\nwhich he was the first and only president until his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO CHARLES P. DALY, CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON INVITATIONS TO\r\nTHE MEETING, TO BE HELD IN UNION SQUARE, TO CELEBRATE RECENT NATIONAL\r\nVICTORIES, ON MARCH 4, 1865\r\n\r\n  \"2 UNION PLACE, _March 3rd, 1865_.\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN,--Your letter, inviting me to 'address the great meeting,\r\nto be held at Union Square to-morrow, to celebrate the recent national\r\nvictories,' reaches me while I am confined by illness, and expect to\r\nbe, at the time of the meeting, totally disabled from speaking. I\r\nshall, however, none the less, join in rendering the most grateful\r\nhomage to the achievements of our gallant soldiers and sailors and\r\ntheir skilful commanders, and the most cordial appreciation of the\r\nvalue of these achievements towards preserving the unity of our Federal\r\nRepublic, and the nationality of the great people which has been formed\r\nunder the shelter of its rightful and beneficent sway.\r\n\r\n\"These sentiments have never been weakened, even when it has sometimes\r\nseemed to me that this great object of our efforts and sacrifices was\r\nimperilled, and those efforts and sacrifices made more costly, if\r\nnot fruitless, by errors of civil policy or of military or financial\r\nadministration. Nor, amid such errors, and all errors tolerated during\r\nthe 'throes and convulsions' of civil war, by the people, who were in\r\nso unaccustomed a situation, and were intensely occupied by the great\r\nstruggle in which they were involved, have I ever lost faith that, when\r\nthe struggle should be once successfully over, they would completely\r\nre-establish the great traditions of constitutional government, founded\r\non local self-control and on individual liberty and personal rights.\r\n\r\n\"Let me add that, in the present posture of our public affairs, it is\r\nbetter to look forward than to look behind--to think of battles to be\r\nfought rather than of victories already won, and in preparing that wise\r\nand liberal statesmanship by which alone a complete pacification of the\r\ncountry is to be attained, to remember that '_peace hath its victories,\r\nnot less renowned than war_.'\r\n\r\n\"To co-operate, candidly and cordially, with the existing public\r\nagents in all measures for bringing the war to a successful close, and\r\nto remove the evils it will have engendered in our civil and social\r\nsystems seems to me as plain a duty as it is at every election to\r\npromote the choice of such public agents as will, in our judgment, best\r\nattain these ends.\r\n\r\n\"With much respect, I remain,\r\n\r\n  \"Truly yours,\r\n                    \"S.

I am more satisfied than ever before of the position of the\r\nPresident, but I think you should at once go to Washington and have an\r\ninterview with him. I enclose Mr. Houston's card, which will insure an\r\nearly meeting after your arrival.\r\n\r\n\"I am entirely in favor of a hearty and earnest support of the Prest.\r\nby our convention, and I hope the _tone_ of the resolutions to be\r\npassed will be more moderate than in New Jersey, or Pa. or Ohio. On one\r\nsubject only is it necessary to be entirely free from ambiguity--I mean\r\non the question of the civil rights of the people, North and South, and\r\ntheir right to know that the first fruits of peace, to wit., freedom\r\nfrom the military power, are fully assured. \"I will see you on your\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n                               \"Yours truly,\r\n                                           SAMUEL L. M. BARLOW.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_S. J. Tilden Esq._\r\n\r\n\"On one other question I think our convention should act explicitly. I\r\nrefer to the pledge of the public faith of the govt. to its creditors,\r\ntowards whom the highest order of national honor is pledged.\r\n\r\n  \"S. L. M. B.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nF. P. BLAIR TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n\"WASH., _19 Oct., 1865_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR TILDEN,--I have a letter from Frank, written at Cincinnati\r\npreviously to his speech in St. Louis, in which he refers to you and\r\nmyself to judge of _the circumstances_, the _when_ and the _how_, he\r\nshall do what it seems he has declared to the country publicly he is\r\nready to do, if necessary, to advance the cause of the party which\r\nnominated him to the Vice-Presidency. If, therefore, any change is to\r\nbe made in the persons to represent our cause in the Novr. elections,\r\nplease telegraph and I will come instantly to meet you.\r\n\r\n\"So much as concerns Frank's position.\r\n\r\n\"Now let me say a word about the intrigue which produces our\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\"Seward and Chase, who never were identified with the Democracy, have\r\nentered into a coalition to control its destiny. They were 'unco-thick\r\nand thrang thegither' last winter, and Seward disclosed to an ardent\r\nDemocrat the other night the cause for which they combined. Seward\r\napproached a brother-in-law of Voorhees and made an eloquent appeal to\r\nhim to convince a company brought together for the purpose that it was\r\nnecessary that Chase should supplant Seymour, and, of course, that the\r\nnominations of our convention should be surrendered. Now it is clear\r\nthat the Chief Justice and the Secretary of State have undertaken to\r\ndispose of our party. Neither ever had its endorsement for any station.\r\nWhy should they be allowed to dispose of the highest without having\r\nconsulted the people?\r\n\r\n\"If we are to change _front_, why not take McClellan and Pendleton,\r\nwho have been endorsed by national convention and the party at the\r\npolls? Why not Hancock and Hendricks, who had high votes in our late\r\nconvention? Why not McClellan and Hendricks? Or Hancock and Adams?\r\nWe might bring Indiana and Penna., or Indiana and Ohio by their most\r\nfamous Democratic sons to increase the vote of the last election in\r\nthese States. I think these or many other combinations might be made to\r\nstrengthen our ticket.\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion the copulation of Seward and Chase would bring not only\r\ndefeat, but eternal disgrace on the Democracy.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, all for yourself. What I have to say further about the\r\nsecond to Mr. Seymour will be in person and in consonance with your\r\njoint wishes.\r\n\r\n  \"Your af. friend,\r\n                       \"F. P.

I feel at a loss to\r\nknow how to express my appreciation of this substantial token of the\r\nfriendship of the citizens named in your letter, and for the generosity\r\nof the citizens of New York generally, and especially towards those\r\nwho they conceive have rendered service in maintaining the integrity\r\nof the whole Union. Suffice it to say that I shall always appreciate\r\ntheir generosity towards me and endeavor to pursue a course through\r\nlife, and to make such use of the means thus unexpectedly placed in my\r\npossession, as will meet with their approval.\r\n\r\n\"Through you I wish to thank the gentlemen whose names you have\r\nenclosed to me individually and collectively.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be, Your obt.

What I mean\r\nis, that I have not a view of things from inside of the machinery.\r\n\r\n\"From the outside I have naturally thought about candidates for\r\nGovernor. I have come to the conclusion that you are the best man for\r\nthe place. I take it for granted you have no desire for the place, for\r\nI am willing to judge you as favorably as I would judge myself, and\r\nsuch a place would have no temptations for me.\r\n\r\n\"But at this time you have no right to consider only your own\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n\"You are the best man--\r\n\r\n\"1. Because you would poll more votes than any other (Dix included);\r\nyou are above the rings and cliques, and would excite no personal\r\nantagonisms.\r\n\r\n\"2. Because you could, after election, make a party of the right\r\nmaterials. The only set of men who can bring back our politics to\r\npurity and statesmanship are the Barnburners of this State; after\r\ncarrying the election these men, whether they have voted of late years\r\nthe Democratic or Republican ticket, could, under you, be brought\r\ntogether--could make a new Democratic party, slough off the corrupt\r\nelements, especially that malign influence with which we shall have\r\nto act this election, T. W., and dictate a reform in the Cabinet\r\nwhich should give the influence of the general government to the same\r\nsound principles as of old controlled this State. This, I think, is\r\nthe _great_ movement to be made in politics--the reconstruction into\r\ncompact force of the divided Barnburners, and for this we must carry\r\nthis State election first, no matter what allies we have to take in for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n\"I, of course, shall not mention your name for the place to any one,\r\nbut, if it should be offered you, you must not decline. Stranger\r\nthings have happened than that it should be offered amid the\r\nconflicting claims.\r\n\r\n                           \"Yours respectfully,\r\n                                             \"JNO.

My object in writing\r\nyou this morning, in too much haste to allow of any discussion, is\r\nto say that _before anything of this character is done_ those who\r\nrepresent the mass of President Johnson's supporters in this State, in\r\nan authentic and authoritative form, wish an opportunity of submitting\r\ntheir views to him.\r\n\r\n\"It is important, in the last degree, that in any changes which are\r\nmade in the great appointments here, and, indeed, in any of them, the\r\ninfluence which these offices are capable of exercising should be held\r\nand exerted as a sacred trust for the success of the administration and\r\nthe policy of President Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"To give them away as mere personal benefactions--to allow them to\r\nbecome the mere aids to ambition or interest of a selfish individual\r\nor clique, to be disposed of by him or it as mere patronage or for\r\npecuniary gain--would be suicide on the part of the President and a\r\nbetrayal of his supporters and his cause.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of a week or ten days I shall have the pleasure to see\r\nyou and to discuss these matters.\r\n\r\n\"In the mean time, please do me the favor to communicate to the\r\nPresident the request contained in this note, and let it remain\r\nstrictly confidential between you and him.\r\n\r\n\"You will notice that the _Times_ of this morning staggers a little.\r\nThe real difficulty is that it _is losing subscribers_.\r\n\r\n\"Up to the time of Mr. Richmond's death the arrangement for the State\r\nnominations was that the Democrats should take the Governor and the\r\nRepublicans the Lieut. Governor. The only chance that Dix had was in a\r\nmovement which was originated by me. It was contingent on events which\r\ncould not be controlled, and on the failure of which it was only to be\r\npersisted in under circumstances which could not be prudently defied.\r\nBut enough till I see you. Let us be firm and courageous and go forward.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly Yours,\r\n                    \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nS. E.

TILDEN.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I went from Albany to Chautauqua Co., and did not get\r\nyour telegram until late Saturday night--not in time to answer. It\r\nis impossible for me to go to New York. I am obliged to go to Albany\r\nto-night on business, and then hurry back to the Lockport circuit. On\r\nmany accounts I would be glad to go to New York, but there will be many\r\nbetter speakers there than I am.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the committee will make you chn., and I have said so to\r\neverybody I have seen. I regard it very important that it should be so,\r\nalthough some of our friends think it should not be in N. Y.; but these\r\nmen don't know that you belong to the party in the State, and not in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\"Now for the campaign. To be successful it must be effective; not\r\nmerely noisy, but a hard-working campaign, and you will excuse a few\r\npractical suggestions.\r\n\r\n\"1st. A large amount of money must be raised, which, if properly laid\r\nout, will help very much. I think every county should have $1000, in\r\ntwo instalments--$500 to take a thorough canvass; this can only be done\r\nby hiring men in each town to do it. We have not had a canvass worth\r\nanything in many years, and an incorrect canvass is worse than none.\r\nThe only way to do it is to appoint a reliable man in each judicial\r\ndistrict to visit each co. and put the money and canvass books in the\r\nhands of a reliable man, who will _hire and pay the men_ to take the\r\ncanvass. It can be done in no other way.\r\n\r\n\"Then, during the week before the election, $500 more to be paid in\r\ngetting the votes to the polls.\r\n\r\n\"2. A thorough and systematic course of meetings in every co.\r\n\r\n\"Such a campaign, carried on by the State com., with what our friends\r\nwill do in each co., will carry the State. Anything short of this will\r\nresult in defeat, in my judgment.\r\n\r\n\"The utmost care must be exercised to have the money properly expended.\r\nIn most of the counties in the State we have no local officer to help\r\nus, and no canvass can be obtained except in the way I indicate--by\r\npaying men by the day for doing it.\r\n\r\n\"Confidentially. Cannot the pressure be made for the Collectorship\r\nbefore election? I suggest it only for your consideration. I shall be\r\nhappy to hear from you.\r\n\r\n                               \"Truly Yours,\r\n                                                  \"S. E.

The President feels, therefore, that, in making\r\nchanges, the greatest care should be exercised. He desires to meet the\r\nwishes of his friends, but he desires, also, that his friends should\r\nbe fully and thoroughly advised before they endorse applications for\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\"It has occurred to me that a change of Collector in the St. Lawrence\r\ndistrict at the present time would be injudicious; and while we desire\r\nto take care of Gen. Barney, we are of the opinion that it would not be\r\nadvisable to appoint him Collector just now, certain as it is that his\r\nnomination will be rejected by the Senate.\r\n\r\n                         \"I am, very truly, Yours,\r\n                                          \"H.

Under the circumstances of\r\nthe case it was thought best by some of our judicious friends that no\r\nchange should take place in the office; at all events, until after the\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\"The decision of the President to withhold from Mr. Campbell his\r\ncommission was not influenced by the representation of any gentlemen\r\nunfriendly to Mr. Campbell or his brother, the candidate for Congress,\r\nbut rather from a desire to do nothing which might impair the\r\nadministration's strength in the district. After the election the\r\nsubject will receive due consideration.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the 12th district, I have only to say that a good deal\r\nof disapprobation has been expressed by the appointment of Mackin\r\nas assessor; and as there seemed to be a good deal of difference of\r\nopinion among our friends in the district in regard to the removal\r\nof the collector, it was thought advisable to make no change in that\r\noffice for the present.\r\n\r\n\"It is pretty clear to my mind that in order that an office should be\r\nmade effective in an election, it is important that the office should\r\nbe fully and properly organized some time in advance.\r\n\r\n\"The President desires to make as few changes as possible, and none on\r\npolitical grounds unless it is clear that the interests of the service\r\nor the interests of the administration are to be certainly benefited by\r\nthem.

DIX TO TILDEN\r\n\r\nANTI-RENTERS AND THEIR LEASES\r\n\r\n\"PARIS, _19 June, 1867_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I wrote you some two months ago, but have not heard\r\nwhether you received my letter. I expressed the hope that you would be\r\na member of the constitutional convention, and was very glad to see\r\nthat you were chosen.\r\n\r\n\"I presume the anti-renters will endeavor to get some amendment of the\r\nConstitution, by which they may become owners of the fee of the lands\r\nthey hold under leases without compensation. This, if done directly,\r\nwould impair the obligation of contracts, and would be declared void\r\nby the Supreme Court of the U. S. It will, therefore, probably be\r\nattempted indirectly--by burdening leased lands with disabilities and\r\nexactions, which will make them of little or no value to landlords.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to leases forever, it is possible that there may be a\r\nproposition to convert them into allodial tenures by giving to lessees\r\nthe right to redeem them by paying to the lessors a principal sum,\r\nwhich will yield the rent in the annual interest. This would be to\r\nintroduce a condition not in the contract. I would not object to it\r\non any other ground if the sum paid were sufficient to yield the rent\r\nat an interest of four per cent., which is considered a fair rate on\r\nagricultural lands. For instance, if the annual rent on a farm or lot\r\nleased forever were $70, the principal sum to be paid should be $1750.\r\nIf only $1000 were paid--a principal sum, which at legal rate (7 pr.\r\nct.) interest yields the rent--the landlord would be put to the trouble\r\nof reinvesting on less durable and safe security.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to leases for years or for lives, the convention should not\r\ninterfere. It may, if it choose, declare that hereafter no leases for\r\nlives shall be given. The Constitution has already declared that there\r\nshall be no leases of agricultural lands for more than twelve years;\r\nand this is a bad restriction for tenants. But leases for lives are\r\nin the process of rapid extinction, and they are not renewed now. My\r\nfather-in-law, Mr. Morgan, gave a large number of such leases sixty\r\nyears ago. Some of them are still in existence, although they were\r\nonly for three lives, which in England are considered equivalent to\r\n21 years. We are selling on liberal terms to the lessees or their\r\nrepresentatives. There should be no interference with such tenures,\r\nunless it be to prohibit them in future. Every man on Mr. Morgan's land\r\nwho has used it in a farmer-like manner has grown rich. Only the idle\r\nor improvident, and now and then an unlucky fellow, have failed to make\r\nmoney. The lands were leased for the interest of less than $3 per acre.\r\nThey have for thirty or forty years been worth treble and quadruple\r\nthat price, and the tenants have reaped all the benefit of the advance.\r\nNow to interfere in any way with the reversionary interest of the\r\nlessor would be the grossest injustice to him. Of course it would be a\r\nviolation of the contract, which we should resist; and it would do an\r\nincalculable injury to a commercial State like New York, whose vitality\r\ndepends so much on the inviolability of its faith and the security of\r\nproperty of all kinds.\r\n\r\n\"Should there be any movement of the kind I have adverted to, I\r\nwish you would talk with Evarts, Pierrepont, and others of the\r\nright-thinking men of the convention; and if you please, show them this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\"I am very hard pressed between the exposition, the foreign sovereigns,\r\nand our own home sovereigns, of whom we have a tremendous influx, and\r\nwrite you '_currente calamo_,' as you see.\r\n\r\n\"We are all well, and cast longing eyes every day across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n                          \"Ever Sincerely Yours,\r\n                                                   \"JOHN A.

I shall make use of the time to write to\r\nyou a political letter. It is seven years since the Democratic party\r\nwent out of power. Seven years of war or of discord, of corruption, of\r\nhate, of taxation and tyranny. In that time, how many who have enjoyed\r\nthe honors and profit given to them by the Democratic party have turned\r\nagainst it and have proved to be its bitterest foes! How few were left\r\nto stand up against the storms of insult, scorn, and threats which beat\r\nupon any man who cared for principles of liberty, humanity, and rights!\r\nBut there were those who did this, and they live to see the day dawning\r\nwhen right and truth will conquer.\r\n\r\n\"But all conditions have their dangers. The time-servers and\r\nspoil-hunters are seeking to come back to our party, not as penitents,\r\nbut as leaders. They may in time forgive us for not joining in their\r\ntreachery, but it will always be counted against us that we did not\r\ngo out with them to gather spoils. There is danger that these men may\r\ndivide those who stood together in the years of trial and of trouble.\r\nThey hatch schemes to draw off some who have strength, and thus break\r\nup the band that held together in the dark days.\r\n\r\n\"What should we do to counteract these plans? We have in New York a\r\ngreat party. It is fresh, vigorous, and united. It is animated by\r\na sense of past wrongs and of future victories. We have but a few\r\nleaders, for none but men of nerve and of truth could stand the tests\r\nof the last seven years. Those leading men are well placed in different\r\nparts of the State, so that neither their numbers nor positions make\r\nthem clash. All fair and honorable ambitions can be gratified--could\r\nwe be more fortunately organized. Let us in a generous spirit train up\r\nas many new men as we can and fit them for places of honor and trust,\r\nbut do not suffer those who come in sunshine and leave us in storms to\r\nwalk into our councils and shape our policy with a view to their own\r\ngain. We who have held to the cause of constitutional liberty have not\r\nalways agreed in our views. At times there may have been irritation.\r\nBut surely past trials have made a groundwork of an attachment and\r\nconfidence which cannot be felt towards those who turned against us or\r\nwho shrank away in our times of trouble. Those generals without troops\r\nwho want to come back into leadership will bring no strength, but much\r\ndiscord. To my mind it is clear that policy and duty alike demand that\r\nwe should stand, as to organization and counsellors, where we are. We\r\ndo not want more leaders. We have the public with us. But something\r\nmust be done to let all of our friends feel that we are to act together\r\nin the spirit that should be, and I think has been, nurtured in\r\ntrials we have passed through. We must have the whole matter frankly\r\ntalked over. In the mean while each one should keep clear of all\r\nentanglements. I have written to Sandford E. Church on this subject\r\nin the way I write to you. I wish you would let me know your views. I\r\nthink eight or ten men should meet at Albany as soon as the Legislature\r\ngets under way. You should see four or five in New York--say, Sweeny,\r\nTweed, Brennan, Hoffman, etc., etc. The rival candidates for the\r\nPresidency will all try to get men drawn into their interests. Let us\r\nkeep our power by holding ourselves free.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly yours, &c.,\r\n                    \"HORATIO SEYMOUR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWM. A.

Mr. Pendleton is a good man, of high\r\nattainments, but I fear he has started an issue on which we cannot\r\nunite; at all events, it cannot be made the leading issue. The\r\nrestoration of the ten absent States to the Union, with the rights and\r\nprivileges of the other States, and with their local governments in\r\nthe hands of their white population, must be the absorbing question.\r\nAll else must be subordinate and secondary.

Indeed, he\r\nseemed to agree to my hint that he might best avoid sneering at any one\r\nwho was a favorite with any so as to keep all in good humor. He would\r\nlike very well to get your man in.

The selection\r\nof any such names as those you mentioned would bring up _old_ issues\r\nand prejudices, and _insure_ defeat; no one doubts your ability or\r\nintegrity; you, I think, could cut loose from such old associations\r\n(for they will be fatal to any candidate on our side who _can't_ do\r\nit); _you_ have _not_ been worn out on antiquated platforms. Why can't\r\nsuch a nomination be made? I believe it would [be] acceptable to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me if I think that you could be elected against Grant, I\r\nsay _yes_, if the party won't force on you a platform that _says too\r\nmuch_--(if the devil ever possessed a sensible man, it is in getting up\r\n'platforms'); not more than _three_ or four cardinal points, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"1. Cheerfully accord freedom to the negro, and equality before the\r\nlaw; but no _universal_ negro suffrage, nor _domination_ of the negro\r\nover the white man.\r\n\r\n\"2. No cavilling about the national debt, however incurred; that is\r\nsacred as honor, and must be paid, principal and interest.\r\n\r\n\"3. No further patching of the Constitution of the country, nor\r\ncurtailing the independence of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\"4. The present erroneous expenditures of the genl. government shall be\r\nreduced, and taxes equalized and diminished, and tax-gatherers shall no\r\nlonger be suffered to pry into domestic affairs nor count the spoons.\r\n\r\n\"If such a platform could be put out and _stuck_ to, not dragged out\r\ninto _side_ issues, or _dead_ issues, success would be sure; so it\r\nappears to me; but if I am only another instance of the side allusion\r\nabove, it would not be strange; but I would like such a nomination as\r\nproposed--there could be none better.\r\n\r\n  \"Y'rs, &c.,\r\n                     \"R.

ROOT (PROBABLY)\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Feb. 28th, 1868_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--Two successive absences, between which I was in town but\r\none day and passed that ill in bed, have prevented an earlier answer to\r\nyour letters.\r\n\r\n\"I concur in your judgment that the paramount issue in the coming\r\nelection would be 'the restoration of the ten absent States to the\r\nUnion, with all the rights and privileges of the other States, and with\r\ntheir local government in the hands of the white population; and that\r\nall else must be subordinate and secondary.'\r\n\r\n\"Our position must be _condemnation and reversal of negro supremacy_ in\r\nthe ten States (added to that in Tennessee), created by the measures\r\nof the Federal government--_first_, by disfranchising the whites and\r\noverawing them by military force, and, _secondly_, by admitting the\r\nblacks and organizing them through the Freeman's Bureau, not only\r\ninvolving us in a partnership in self-government with a mass of voters\r\n(in all the U. S. over 900,000), confessedly incompetent at the present\r\ntime to exercise the suffrage wisely or safely, and without any of the\r\ntraining, habits, or aspirations of freemen, but, by thus obtaining\r\ncontrol of nearly one-third of the Senate and nearly one-quarter of the\r\nHouse, establishing a practical dominion of the same character over the\r\ngreat free States of the North and over the whole country.\r\n\r\n\"Associated with this issue are all those measures by which the Senate\r\nis to be packed by the admission of new States--the subdivision of\r\nthe present States--added to the control of 20 from the ten States\r\nand others constituting a Senatorial dynasty of long tenure, and the\r\nusurpation by the Senate thus constituted of the opportunity, power,\r\nand the absorption by it and the House of the rightful authorities of\r\nthe Executive and of the Judiciary.\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment, if we obscure or weaken this issue, we shall not only\r\nfail to meet the necessities of the present condition of the country,\r\nbut we shall commit a great political blunder.\r\n\r\n\"On no other question can we be so unanimous among ourselves. On no\r\nother question can we draw so much from the other side and from the\r\nundetermined. It appeals peculiarly to the adopted citizens, whether\r\nIrish or Germans; to all the working-men; to the young men just\r\nbecoming voters. The Republican party contains large numbers who are\r\nnaturally hampered by its position on this issue; and large numbers of\r\nold Federal and old Whig antecedents, who do not think that any poor\r\nman, white or black, ought to vote; and though they may go along with\r\ntheir party on the theory that the blacks are a counterpoise to the\r\nadopted citizens, their hearts misgive them. The pride of a superior\r\nrace and self-esteem, well founded in this case, are a universal power.\r\n\r\n\"The more we concentrate the public attention on this issue, so that\r\nthe people will act with reference to it, the better our chance of\r\nsuccess will be.\r\n\r\n\"Subordinate, but next in importance, is the financial question.\r\n\r\n\"The best aspect of that is its connection with the other issue. It\r\nis now costing the country, directly and indirectly, 100 millions a\r\nyear--perhaps as much even as the whole interest on the public debt--to\r\ncarry on the reconstruction system and the measures associated with it.\r\nThe army expenses are now about 144 millions, exclusive of pensions.\r\n\r\n\"The best policy on the finances is a general attack on the prodigality\r\nand corruption of the present governing power. Our promises should be\r\npurification--reduction of the army and navy, diminution of expenses,\r\nand remission of taxes.\r\n\r\n\"I inquired into the state and prospects of the finances when in\r\nWashington, and am satisfied that the expenditures are now running at a\r\nrate much larger than the public are aware of. And the tendency is to a\r\nfall of the revenues.

So soon as the diversity of feeling in the State\r\nwas apparent I determined that it was true policy to avoid naming a\r\ncandidate, and none will be named. On the Western border the Pendleton\r\nfever had some start. In the East and interior the friends of Gen.\r\nHancock were disposed to present his name, and on the Southern tier of\r\ncounties there was a disposition to compliment Judge Black.\r\n\r\n\"The only name on this list, however, seriously mentioned was that of\r\nGen.

But at the bottom of all this, so far as civilians are\r\nconcerned, is the feeling and purpose I expressed to you.\r\n\r\n\"But the Young Democracy are making some trouble on our hands about\r\ndelegates at large, and may defeat some of the older men, perhaps\r\nmyself.

If he is the next Presidential\r\ncandidate there need be no fear, in my judgment, in reference to his\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\"The Governor is not in our district, and I have not seen him for\r\nseveral weeks, as I have been mostly from home at court; but I do\r\nnot think he should or will be a delegate at the approaching State\r\nconvention. Nor should he, in my opinion, be a delegate in the national\r\nconvention. We should not allow him to be a delegate to the national\r\nconvention. This would be regarded as evidence that he was not to be\r\nour Presidential candidate in any contingency.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. D. C. Grove, editor of the _Observer_, is the delegate to the\r\nState convention from this district. He will be disposed to do whatever\r\nour friends shall deem best. Mr. Spriggs and I mean to be in Albany\r\nTuesday night to aid, if we can, in consultation.\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment we should not in the State convention lay down anything\r\nlike a platform of principles; leave this to the national convention.\r\n\r\n\"We might very properly in brief and well-considered resolutions\r\ndenounce the revolutionary schemes and measures of the Radicals;\r\ndeclare our convictions that our institutions and the peace and\r\nprosperity of the country are in danger; and call upon the people at\r\nthe coming election to elect men and declare in favor of principles who\r\nand which will restore the country to peace and prosperity and preserve\r\nAmerican constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that as a party we should take any part in the struggle\r\nnow going on between President Johnson and the men who elected him.\r\n\r\n\"In reference to the candidate for President. I think we should select\r\nas delegates our wisest and most patriotic men--men whose character\r\nwill give them weight in the national convention, and who will not be\r\ninfluenced in their action by the views of any clique of interested\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n\"Believing myself that Gov. Seymour is our best man for the times\r\nand our strongest man for the canvass, I hope the delegation will be\r\ncomposed of men friendly to his nomination.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me also that the State convention should, in proper terms,\r\nin reference to other States and other candidates, give expression\r\nto the confidence in and preference for Governor Seymour as the\r\nPresidential nominee.\r\n\r\n\"I have made above suggestions in haste, and will be happy to compare\r\nviews with you and others at Albany.

Seymour as saying that\r\nunder no circumstances would he consent to become a candidate for the\r\nPresidency. I sincerely hope this report is not literally correct. Such\r\na determination would be a great misfortune for the country, and, in\r\nmy judgment, a wrong to the reputation of Gov. S. The whole country\r\nunderstands and respects his aversion to the attitude of a candidate\r\nfor the nomination, but it will never do for him to say that he will\r\nnot run if nominated, or serve if elected. He may think that there is\r\nno inclination to nominate him; if so, he is mistaken. As the case\r\nnow stands, he would certainly be selected, and his late speech will\r\nadd greatly to his strength. Mr. Pendleton, it is true, seems to have\r\nstrength by reason of his greenback issue, but that issue will not\r\nlive till the 4th of July, nor will it bear examination at any time. I\r\nperceive that Mr. McMaster, of your city, who attended our convention,\r\nintimates that our vote will be cast for Mr. P. He is totally mistaken.\r\nOne 5th or 6th of the delegates may, at present, prefer Mr. P., but\r\nI am convinced that by the time of the convention he will have no\r\nparty at all. But the friends of Gov. Seymour desire to talk about\r\nhim, and the almost unbroken reply is that he is the right man; but he\r\ndeclines, and we must look for some one else. Now, we must not be left\r\nin this position. Your letter is enough, but it is dated prior to his\r\nlast declination and before the State convention, and as he was not\r\npresented it may be said that the Democracy of your State are not for\r\nhim. There has been, as you may be aware, an attempt to make a movement\r\nfor Mayor Hoffman, at Phila., but I do not think it will extend, even\r\nwith Seymour out of the way. The delegates from the South will seek to\r\nact with N. Y. and Pa., and will do what these States desire. I _know_\r\nthis to be the general sentiment, and when Gov. Seymour's late speech\r\nis circulated it will awaken much enthusiasm for his nomination.\r\n\r\n\"I had intended to visit you after our convention, but I was unwell\r\nand had to return home. We had things our own way. The young Democracy\r\nyielded the convention to the older men of the party.\r\n\r\n\"May I hope to hear from you at your convenience?\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly, Your Obt.

I read it this morning by my\r\nfireside, and I wish to tell you how much it impressed me. It is not\r\nonly original and philosophical, but it has the higher merit of being\r\nsuggestive. It not only gives views and facts, but sets men upon trains\r\nof thought which they will work out for themselves. This gives to a\r\nspeech its highest value. But a few things can be said in a speech,\r\nand if it fails to be suggestive to the hearers or readers it does but\r\nlittle good. Beyond anything I have read in a long time your words at\r\nAlbany have not only given me new ideas, but they have also led me into\r\npathways of thought, where I have found many views for myself.

They cannot afford to dispense with the strength they would\r\nderive from opposition to practical abuses, which are apart from\r\nconstitutional questions--the financial and commercial mismanagement,\r\nand the reckless expenditure by Congress.

Had two conversations with Randall--one in the morning,\r\nthe other in the afternoon. Between the two conferences the Governor\r\nhad an interview with the President in relation to the future action of\r\nthe administration. Randall said no action could be taken in regard to\r\nconsolidating against Grant until after the 26th. The Johnson men would\r\nbe glad to have a conference with you and your friends in New York at\r\nany time you would name after the 26th here in N. Y. The first name he\r\nmentioned, upon which a consolidation could be effected, was Hancock.\r\nAfterwards mentioned Chase, as upon him more Senators could be brought\r\nthan upon the former. He mentioned the names of several Senators who\r\nwould support Chase beside the Republican non-impeachers. He asserted\r\npositively that Chase would accept a nomination from the Democrats\r\nand Conservatives. That Chase's negro antecedents could be got along\r\nwith by adopting a plank in the platform giving each State, or rather\r\nconceding to each State, the management of the franchise question. He\r\nalso said that should Chase be nominated there would be no lack of\r\n'material aid' to carry on the campaign successfully.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion is that if our convention could be brought to nominate\r\nChase, with Hancock, we would sweep the country, and on the fourth of\r\nMarch next have a working majority in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"Randall also suggested that you get some of your commercial men to\r\nwrite to the acquitting Senators, thanking them in the name of the\r\ngreat interests of N. Y. for their votes, and especially Senator Grimes.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that the proposed conference will be held, believing, as I do,\r\nthat it will result in the overthrow of the political ascendency of the\r\nRadicals; at all events, it can do no harm, as I am entirely satisfied\r\nthat the Johnson interest would see the Democracy succeed rather than\r\nthe Rads, even if they are not recognized.\r\n\r\n\"The _Times_ of this morning copies an article from the _Argus_, and,\r\nif I can read the article and understand it aright, it is a feeler in\r\nthis very direction.\r\n\r\n\"I shall publish a leader, when I return home, of the same import, but\r\na little plainer, without mentioning any names, and we will see what\r\ncomes of it.\r\n\r\n\"One other thing. Randall intimated to me that the President and Smythe\r\nwere not on as good terms as they might be. The President did not take\r\nhis last offer to do a certain thing, provided he would give him the\r\n_mission to Australia_. The President thought it would have been better\r\nin Smythe to have paid up arrearages before asking further favors.\r\n\r\n\"Randall said other Senators would have voted for acquittal had it been\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n  \"Confidentially Yours,\r\n                        \"WM.

The hope of winning\r\nfriends from our adversaries by taking up a man who has been identified\r\nwith the other party finds little encouragement in our past experience.\r\nThose who do not hate the Radicals worse than they do Democrats will\r\ncontinue to vote with them.

Chase's record is not a good one; it\r\nhas great defects. Ambitious politicians may deem his acquisition a\r\nbargain; but I tell you his name has no strength with Democrats. That\r\npride, in and for the men and for the principles which he has assisted\r\nus to sustain in dark times, which Seymour's name would command, will\r\nbe thrown away without him, and especially with a candidate so recently\r\na leading man in the administration of Mr. Lincoln. The election of\r\nLincoln, taken with all its consequences, was about the greatest\r\ncalamity that ever befell a great nation. The Democracy all over the\r\nland, though hushed to silence by the war spirit, feel it to be so.\r\nThey ache for an opportunity to show their zeal and their strength.\r\nI have no doubt but that Seymour's scruples may be overcome if he\r\ndeems the interests of the country at stake. I must say that I think\r\nhis unqualified declension has been injurious to his success in being\r\nnominated, but not in being elected if nominated.\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment, Pendleton's name stands next to Seymour, though\r\nI suppose N. Y. city thinks otherwise. His theory, as he himself\r\nexplained it, was not so very objectionable as some of the N. Y.\r\nfinanciers seem to suppose, but the answer and cure of all that\r\nquestion between greenbacks and gold will be settled under a Democratic\r\nadministration very shortly by the resumption of specie payments, and\r\nthis is and should be the only answer to it. With Seymour at the head,\r\ntake Hendrix for vice. With Pendleton, take, possibly, C. F. Adams,\r\nor, better still, our own Church. I believe the Democracy have the\r\npower and the will to restore the government to common-sense and the\r\nConstitution to its position as the fundamental law of the land, and\r\nI believe it must [be] done through the agency [of] men who have not\r\nswerved from their principles, whether in peace or War.\r\n\r\n  \"With Great Respect, Yours, &c.,\r\n                        \"ARPHAXED LOOMIS.\"[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nW.

Because it is a necessity for them, by their political action this\r\nfall, to show that there is no practical barrier between the races, and\r\nthat this can be done in no way so well as by Chase's nomination.

You asked me to keep you posted, and\r\ntherefore I send these advices, as they come to me intended only\r\nfor me. I think the Chase fever will die out and will help Frank\r\nin the end. I wrote Barlow yesterday, who seems, by the way, to be\r\n_enthused_ about it, that it was regarded here as an attempt like\r\nPendleton's to subordinate the great constitutional questions involved\r\nin the reconstruction measures--a question which is fundamental\r\nand will determine whether this is to be a free govt. or not--and\r\nthe subordinate one of whether the debt was to be paid in gold or\r\ngreenbacks. It is impossible that the public mind shall make such\r\na diversion, and those who attempt it are swayed by personal, not\r\npublic, interests, and can have no real hold on the country, and no\r\ncomprehension of the serious mood in which the people are at this\r\nmoment. You, who really believe in the people and have faith, a real\r\nfaith, in the Democratic philosophy, can comprehend how dangerous it is\r\nfor the leaders of a great party to trifle with this subject, and that\r\nit is trifling with it to set up a man as the representative of a cause\r\nwho has no heart in it, and only because he has quarrelled with his\r\nown party for their daring to prefer another man.\r\n\r\n\"The Chase spasm will help Frank by loosening up of the party feeling\r\nand antagonizing Pendleton. If any Democrat can go for Chase _a priori_\r\nthey can go for Blair, and Frank[49] will carry just 10 Republican\r\nvotes for every one that Chase can carry; for Chase has not the\r\nslightest influence with the only class of Republicans who are disposed\r\nto go with us, viz., the Lincoln men. He was an active Radical, and the\r\nLincoln men would delight to have him beaten. He was the only human\r\nbeing that I believe Lincoln actually hated. Our running Chase would\r\nfix thousands to Grant, who would certainly go for us with Frank as a\r\nleader, Frank being really the true heir to Lincoln. Lincoln sent for\r\nhim from the army to defend him and to assail Chase on the floor of\r\nthe House of Representatives, and Lincoln, you remember, published his\r\nletter to me requesting my brother to leave his command and take his\r\nseat in the House of Reps., promising to restore him his commission as\r\nsoon as military operations were resumed, which he did to the chagrin\r\nof all Chase men.\r\n\r\n\"I had a great contest to get into the convention. The B. & O. R. R.\r\nand Pendletonians exerted themselves to the utmost to defeat me, but\r\nby the sheer pressure of public opinion in Baltimore I was carried\r\nthrough. At every mention of my name in the convention the immense\r\nhall rang with the applause of the people, and I got 18 of 21 city\r\ndelegates, altho' every man of them had been pledged against me.\r\n\r\n  \"Y'rs truly,\r\n                        \"M. BLAIR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nR. J. WALKER,[50] SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY UNDER PRESIDENT POLK, TO\r\nTILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"_Confidential._\r\n\r\n                         WASHINGTON, D. C., _May 30, 1868_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--When you were last in Washington you were pleased to ask my\r\nviews as to the candidate who ought to be nominated by the Democratic\r\nconvention for the Presidency. I gave you my opinions then very\r\nbriefly, but the great events which have transpired since that period\r\nhave, in my judgment, settled the question conclusively. Our strongest\r\nman, and the only one who can _certainly_ be elected, is Genl. W. S.\r\nHancock.\r\n\r\n\"My reasons are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1st. Pennsylvania is the most doubtful State in the Union, and has\r\nalways decided contested Presidential elections. The reason is not\r\nonly the closeness of her vote and the great number of her electors,\r\nbut that her State elections precede by three weeks those in other\r\nStates, and thus influence beyond calculation the result of the\r\nPresidential election. Hancock is the only man who can carry that\r\nState. His nomination from that moment would give us the prestige of\r\ncertain success there, and a probable majority of 50,000 in our favor\r\nin the October election, which would immensely influence other States\r\nin November following. He is a Pennsylvanian by birth and education,\r\nand by far the most popular of her soldiers. He commanded in person\r\nmore of her troops than any other man, leading them always to victory,\r\nespecially at Gettysburg, to Pennsylvania the decisive battle of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. About one-third of all the voters of the North were soldiers\r\nduring the recent war. Recognizing this, the radical party have\r\nnominated Grant. We must receive a large proportion of that vote in the\r\ncoming contest or we are defeated. No Democratic candidate can receive\r\nanything like so large a proportion of this vote as Hancock. From the\r\ncommencement to the close of the war he has commanded, in person, over\r\nthree hundred thousand troops, and both officers and men were greatly\r\nattached to him. His military record during the war was most brilliant,\r\nand will bear the closest scrutiny and the most favorable comparison\r\nwith that of Grant.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. He would be more acceptable to the South than any other military\r\ncandidate, many prominent Southern leaders and newspapers having\r\nannounced their preference for him. Especially is this the case with\r\nher wisest men, because, whilst recognizing his sound Democratic\r\nprinciples, success is to _them_ a necessity, and they believe that his\r\nnomination would make our victory certain. They do not support him with\r\nreluctance, but with enthusiasm. His humane, able, and statesmanlike\r\nadministration of the affairs of the 5th military district, at a time\r\nwhen all seemed lost, when every other military leader had either gone\r\nover to the enemy or concealed his views, gained him their respect and\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\"4th. Hancock has from his youth up always been a Democrat. In taking\r\nhim we do not rely upon a man of doubtful or vacillating principles,\r\nbut one of our faith, with the firmness and the courage to maintain it.\r\n\r\n\"5th. Hancock, I believe, would make a President of whom not only our\r\nparty, but our country, would be proud. He would unite and strengthen\r\nthe party, and his firmness, good judgment, and total disregard of\r\npolitical trickery would lead us safely through the coming crisis of\r\nour national affairs.\r\n\r\n\"6th. No man can foreshadow the events of the next four years. Are\r\nthey to be peaceful or warlike? And how is the latter condition to\r\nbe avoided? We must nominate a man who can certainly be elected, and\r\nwhose name at the head of our Presidential ticket, whilst giving us the\r\nprestige of certain success in that campaign, will give us strength\r\nto carry the Congressional elections. Has any such man been thought\r\nor spoken of except Hancock? I have heard of none. Besides, you will\r\nrecollect that, by unconstitutional legislation, Grant has been made\r\nthe virtual commander-in-chief of the _armies_ of the United States.\r\nWe must have for his commander-in-chief a man who has the ability, the\r\ncourage, and the firmness to command him. Such a man is Genl. Hancock.\r\n\r\n\"This will be the great struggle for the supremacy of one or the\r\nother great party of the country. A written Constitution against a\r\npopular, if not a military, despotism. If we fail now we may be lost\r\nforever, for a civil war alone could tear down the barriers which\r\nthe Radical party would erect against our liberties. They would then\r\nhave, as now, the Senate and the House, the legislative departments.\r\nThen, as now, by similar intimidation, carried to a greater excess by\r\ntheir victory, they would suspend the functions, as they pleased, of\r\nthe Supreme Court, the judicial department. They would have also the\r\nexecutive department, thus securing substantially all the departments\r\nof the government. Do you doubt the extent to which they would carry\r\ntheir revolutionary doctrines? And would the Senate any longer be a\r\ncurb upon the frenzy of the House, with an addition of 20 members from\r\nthe negro-ized South? We must start out, casting aside all personal\r\npreferences and prejudices, determined to succeed. We must select\r\nthe man who can secure the most votes, and who will be supported\r\nwith enthusiasm by every Democrat, war or peace, so-called, by every\r\nconservative Democrat or Republican soldier, and by the thousands of\r\nnew recruits and conservative Republicans. I think that Genl. W. S.\r\nHancock is the only man who would receive the combined, enthusiastic\r\nsupport of the people South and North.\r\n\r\n\"I know that, if you concur with me in these views, you will not\r\nhesitate to use every effort to secure by this means the success of\r\nthat party which is dear to us both. I have written you because I knew\r\nthat you would not misconstrue my motives, and because I believe that\r\nyou can exert great influence for the good of our country. If there be\r\nreasons which I may have overlooked, in forming a deliberate judgment\r\nupon a subject which has caused me much anxious thought, I should be\r\nvery much pleased to hear them from a friend like yourself. Let us have\r\nharmony in our councils, and with wisdom success is ours.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly your friend,\r\n                          \"R. J. WALKER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO THE TAMMANY SOCIETY\r\n\r\n  \"_July, 1868._\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN,--Regretting that I cannot personally attend the celebration\r\nof the Fourth of July by the Tammany Society, to which you have invited\r\nme, I nevertheless concur most cordially in the patriotic sentiments so\r\neloquently expressed in the address of the sachems.\r\n\r\n\"Your venerable society may well felicitate itself upon its political\r\nretrospect. It did everything in its power to avert civil strife\r\nby a policy which was represented as too conciliatory by those who\r\ndid not comprehend the danger. When the conflict of arms came it\r\ncordially maintained the nationality of our people in a confederated\r\nrepublic, which Jefferson and Madison and Jackson always held to be\r\nincapable of being dissolved except by a revolutionary destruction of\r\nthe Constitution. And now that peace has once more happily returned,\r\nit claims that constitutional rights shall be restored throughout our\r\nwhole country; that every State shall be replaced in its constitutional\r\norbit; that we shall once more present to the world a continental\r\nsystem of States, bound together by a constitutional union--founded on\r\nthe twin principles of local self-government and industrial liberty,\r\nand sustained by the voluntary action of a people among whom government\r\nis everywhere carried on by the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! that this benign work of peace should be more difficult than the\r\nfierce struggle of war. But so it is.\r\n\r\n\"Multitudes of our fellow-citizens are so infatuated with fear of the\r\ndanger of disunion, which has now passed, that they create a danger of\r\ncentralism fatal to all liberty--to all constitutional government--and\r\nat last by inevitable reaction to the Union itself.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of restoring the system of our fathers, the purpose to do\r\nwhich alone consecrated our cause against secession as righteous, they\r\nwould erect upon this fair continent eleven Polands, eleven Hungaries,\r\neleven Irelands!\r\n\r\n\"And the same principles of despotism which they would apply to our\r\nrecent enemies they freely extend to the whole Northern people.\r\n\r\n\"I say the principles of despotism. For _centralism_ is _despotism_.\r\nWas centralism ever before so rampant as now? The distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic of the controlling element of the so-called Republican\r\nparty which now sways the two Houses of Congress is a total disregard\r\nof all limitations of power established by our written Constitution; an\r\noverwhelming contempt for all fundamental law, whether State or Federal.\r\n\r\n\"No right of localities or of individuals is deemed sacred.\r\n\r\n\"The principles which underlie our whole political system are not\r\nrespected; they do not seem to be even comprehended.\r\n\r\n\"The present Congress and the advanced Republican party are a rule\r\nunto themselves. Their own opinion of what it is convenient or\r\nexpedient they should do, is the only limitation of power which they\r\nacknowledge; and it is their opinion that they should do pretty much\r\neverything, in all places and with respect to everybody.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, such a false system of political philosophy does now, as it\r\nhas in all ages, immediately degenerate into selfish rapacity. Congress\r\nis mainly occupied in putting new manacles on the trade and industry of\r\nthe country; and the more respectable representatives of the prevalent\r\npolitical ideas are voting money out of everybody's pockets into their\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"In this condition of things nothing but the principles of the\r\nDemocratic party, as maintained by Jefferson and Jackson, can save the\r\ncountry. There is no organized agency which can give effects to these\r\nprinciples except the Democratic party, with such alliances as it may\r\nform in the cause of liberal government.\r\n\r\n\"From the day of the accession of President Johnson I have felt renewed\r\nconfidence that the American people would not only maintain our\r\nnational unity, but would reconstruct our political institutions on\r\ntheir ancient foundations.\r\n\r\n\"The political ideas of Jefferson and Jackson in which President\r\nJohnson was educated, and which have become incarnated in his very\r\nnature--the character of the work he was providentially called to\r\nundertake in bringing back into our system the people of eleven States\r\nlately in revolt, which he could only do by addressing the intellects\r\nand sentiments of that people--were guarantees that he would recur to\r\nthe original fountains of our American principles of government.\r\n\r\n\"As for us, we could not but accept what we had sought when we\r\nendeavored to elect McClellan: first, the re-establishment of national\r\nunity; secondly, the starting the restored government in its new career\r\nupon its original and true principles.\r\n\r\n\"The situation controls. Not the plans or wishes of individuals.\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment, neither President nor the Democratic party could stop\r\nwhat events so clearly commanded.\r\n\r\n\"Last year, at your Fourth-of-July celebration, I promised him in your\r\nname, in the name of the Democratic party, and of your acclamations, a\r\nliberal co-operation in the great work; and afterwards repeated that\r\nassurance in person.\r\n\r\n\"The time has now come when all parties who favor President Johnson's\r\nplan of pacification must act with reference to the election of the\r\nnext Congress.\r\n\r\n\"President Johnson will now be under the necessity of appealing to the\r\nwhole body of the people, accepting all who come to him on the issue he\r\nhas made, and separating from all who go against him on that issue.\r\n\r\n\"If he should attempt the narrow and futile scheme, urged upon him by\r\nthose who are neither his friends nor the friends of his cause--of\r\ncarrying out his policy through the exclusive agency of the Republican\r\nparty, in case he can capture it and convert it to his purposes--he\r\nwill find his machine turned against him in the hour of his need. He\r\nwill find himself, like the unfortunate object of Turkish jealousy,\r\ntied up in a bag, to be silently strangled. I do not doubt that he\r\nwill act on the larger policy which would have governed Andrew Jackson\r\nor Henry Clay under like circumstances. He will cast himself upon the\r\nwhole body of our people, leaving parties and organizations to take\r\ncare of themselves. He will be triumphantly sustained.\r\n\r\n\"The Democratic party should pursue a liberal policy in all its\r\naction, and accept as brethren all who stand with it on the present\r\nissue. It is too powerful to be jealous. It has too great a motive in\r\nthe restoration of its own traditional principles of government to\r\nan ascendency in the councils of the country, which they made great,\r\nprosperous, and happy, to think of anything less grand or less noble.\r\n\r\n\"With much respect, I remain, gentlemen,\r\n\r\n  \"Y'rs truly,\r\n                    \"S.

He did not talk favorably of\r\nChase, but as an antagonist of Seymour, whom he considered to be at\r\nheart opposed to him. He spoke well of Frank, and intimated a purpose\r\nto support him if nominated. The day before I left the city Montgomery\r\nand myself called at his office. He said he would have supported Frank\r\ncordially, but insisted that now it was Grant vs. Seymour, and the\r\nformer w'd succeed. His son, in whom all his hopes and affections\r\nare bound up, is greatly attached to Frank. Is it not worth while to\r\nwork on the old man's personal vanity and his ambition for his son's\r\nadvancement in the party's consideration to get him into line to help\r\nour cause? Lawrence Jerome is devoted to Frank, and Bennett's son to\r\nhim. Jerome is out for Frank, although he once subscribed to Grant.\r\nI think through him, by proper management, we might get hold of the\r\n_Herald_. Whatever may be thought or said of this fickle print, it is\r\na power in the body politic through its vast circulation. I think it\r\nmight be led to make a transit to Seymour by means of its inclinings\r\nto Frank; and Jerome would be a safe conduct in this matter, as he\r\nand Bennett were both shipped once for Grant, but now prefer my hero.\r\nThey want a hero, and so does our cause; and although Frank is a\r\nmighty small young Hickory, he is the best we can now command. Do try\r\nand make something of these suggestions; we have so good a cause,\r\nand its success is so essential to the welfare of the country, that\r\nsome condescensions to the old Plutus (or Pluto, if you please) might\r\nbe a cheap purchase of a three months' command of his columns. If\r\nmy scribblings in them could be of use in reviving memories of the\r\nJackson-Van Buren era and the prosperous times it brought about for\r\nthe Republic, I would give a part of every day to inveigh against the\r\nmonstrous doings of the banditti that now set up for a Congress--and it\r\nwould be by way of contrast.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the convention, although it seems to have been by accident,\r\nreally made the wisest disposition, both as to the ticket and the\r\nplatform that could have been devised. Seymour's eloquence and polish\r\nand moderation has a happy influence to recommend us to the refined\r\nand all who are apprehensive of rash counsels in this crisis. Frank's\r\nboldness and thorough grasp of all the issues which are looked to as\r\nnecessary to put the Democracy at once in possession of the good,\r\nwill do much to rally to our standard all the zealots for the instant\r\noverthrow of the corrupt military despotism that now lords it over the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"I enjoin it on you to give your sister that _dollar_ I promised\r\nto return through you and you w'd not take; I insist on a specific\r\nperformance for the honor of\r\n\r\n  \"Yr. mo. afft.,\r\n                      \"F.

To do this we must give them a motive as well as a method for\r\naction. This has been done in New Jersey and Connecticut by the Jackson\r\nclubs. They are, to a degree, secret organizations. This gives them\r\nthe charm of novelty, as we have heretofore had nothing of the kind\r\non our side. They hold out a motive to the active young men, as they\r\ngive to them power at once in their localities. James Spencer, Esq.,\r\nof New York, and Mr. Palmer, of Wisconsin, called upon me last week\r\nwith a plan of the kind, which I think is the right thing. They are\r\nboth good organizers. This scheme is the most efficient, and costs the\r\nleast. When a club is formed it is not only self-sustaining, but it\r\ndoes a great deal of work at its own cost. If men are sent at once\r\ninto Maine, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania they will in a little time\r\ngive such a start to the movement that it will go on of itself. Time\r\nis everything, and it is my opinion any other method should be dropped\r\nand this plan entered upon. It has freshness, economy, and simplicity\r\nto recommend it. It appeals to young men, as it gives them something\r\nto do, and also gives them strength and power in their towns. I wish\r\nyou would see Messrs. Spencer and Palmer when they call upon you. I\r\nam quite well now, but I am suffering with the rest of mankind from\r\nthe heat. I am overwhelmed with letters. Of course, all I get are very\r\nsatisfactory. Our papers should keep up a steady fire upon the subjects\r\nof debt, taxation, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n                            \"Truly yours, &c.,\r\n                                               \"HORATIO SEYMOUR.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_Hon.

Your exposure of the terrible cost the whole\r\nnation is put to in maintaining an army to hold one portion of it in\r\nsubjection makes it plain that the entire commonwealth is subjected.\r\nThat section of ours which bears the tax (more than England and France\r\nboth bear to enslave two empires), to keep the South under the foot of\r\nour quondam slaves, certainly gets less for its money, although laid\r\nout in producing a very thorough despotism, than the imperial dynasties\r\nabroad. You have made a capital demonstration of the enormity of the\r\nflight into tyranny which our Radicals have made in a short time, from\r\nthe vantage-ground they obtained in the war over our free govt. The\r\nNorth sells itself into debt and slavery to enslave the South.\r\n\r\n\"But I owe you something more than the commonalty for your speech--your\r\nmaking my son a great man, giving him the heirship of Old Hickory's\r\nglory, although I know it is far beyond his reach, fills me with\r\ndelight. You put a brilliant rainbow before my eyes, and tell me there\r\nis a pot of gold where it stands on the earth. The vision pleases,\r\nhowever, sensible that no effort will find its footing on the ground.\r\nYet I hope Frank's aspirations will not all prove delusions to him\r\nor his father. He has all Old Hickory's devotion to his country, and\r\nhe has the courage to attempt its redemption from the hands of the\r\nbanditti that has for the time seized on all its wealth and all the\r\ndefences of its liberties, and I have faith in a providence to overrule\r\nit, so that my young stripling who is put forward in the battle against\r\nthe Philistines may do some execution with his sling.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you write me a line to say what promise you bring from the West.\r\nI have some influence with Bennett. If you think well of it I will\r\nwrite to him and urge him to open his columns to us.

Mr. Welles is\r\nnow at the Kittery Yard in person, and will not be here for a week\r\nperhaps. He has probably done what Shaw and friends ask. If not, 'twill\r\nbe too late to act, I fear, on his return. Welles is very earnestly\r\nwith us now, and I have no doubt will do anything he can. My accounts\r\nfrom the West agree with yours as respects political prospects there.\r\nBut Able, who is not of a sanguine temperament, writes that our friends\r\nare going to carry Missouri by 20,000 majority.\r\n\r\n\"From Maine, Mr. Clapp, former M. C. from Portland, a brother of Mrs.\r\nWoodbury, who is also a cautious man, is very confident of gains in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\"If my father can go on to New York I am sure he will do so, to see\r\nBennett. The truth is, however, that Bennett looks _to position_, and\r\nthere is no getting him without assurances of it. It was in this way\r\nthat Lincoln got him. He could have been nominated to Paris undoubtedly\r\nif he had not himself declined accepting the mission, because he would\r\nhave been rejected. Chase got his support, I am sure, by promising\r\nhim this mission if he was elected. The negotiation with Lincoln was\r\ncarried on through a fellow of the name of Bartlett, who was the\r\nsame man who got the _Herald_ for Frémont. I had no part in either\r\nnegotiation, but I knew of both and sustained Lincoln in keeping his\r\nbargain with Bennett. His inclinations are with our side, I am sure,\r\nand he told my father and myself he would have supported Frank's\r\nnomination earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"I would not hesitate myself in supporting him if he would give us the\r\npower of his press to elect our ticket. I regard him as every way a\r\nmost reputable man, and one of far greater ability than Chief-Justice\r\nChase. I said this to one of Chase's hangers-on one day when he was\r\nturning up his eyes at Lincoln's appointment of Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"If Seymour could support Chase for the Presidency for his doings about\r\nimpeachment I cannot see why he could not appoint Bennett for helping\r\nto save the country.\r\n\r\n\"Seymour ought not, under any circumstances, to be approached on this\r\nmatter. But I think we might legitimately hold out hopes to Bennett\r\nand keep our promise of support in good faith. I would, for myself,\r\nunhesitatingly offer to do my utmost to get the President to appoint\r\nhim, though I would not offer that Seymour himself should come under\r\nany promise about it, or indeed be approached on the subject directly\r\nor indirectly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I would not be so explicit on this subject with any one\r\nelse. But with you I talk freely, so that when the old man comes on, if\r\nhe should, you will be prepared to take ground on the point in question.\r\n\r\n                               \"Y'rs truly,\r\n                                                      \"M.

I have been talking the matter over with Mr. McCormick, in\r\nwhose judgment I have great confidence. Now, every candidate for the\r\nPresidency must have a 'privy council.' There must be a number of men\r\nupon whom he can lean, who will help to shape out before election a\r\nline of policy which will carry the country through its difficulties.\r\nAble, influential, and thoughtful men should know now what they can\r\nrely upon in the event of our success.

Should not some definiteness be given to\r\nour future plans? Could not some position be taken now which will do\r\ngood in the way of foiling the attacks of our opponents? Up to this\r\ntime, with the exception of my consultations with you and two or three\r\nothers, I have been almost isolated in my position.

This is a movement upon which the Republicans count largely,\r\nand upon which they have spent large sums of money. Now, the _éclat_\r\nof this will not depend upon the soldiers, but the generals who will\r\nbe in attendance. Can this be done? Get Generals McClellan, Hancock,\r\nFranklin to go to Philadelphia on Thursday of next week. Give them\r\na reception. There will be an immense turn-out of the citizens. The\r\nRepublican meeting and the near approach of the election will furnish\r\nall the stimulants needed. As it will be gotten up without parade or\r\nall the notes of preparation which have gone before the Republican\r\nshow, it will tell more on the public minds. The soldiers throughout\r\nthe country look to see how the popular generals go. We can make the\r\nbest show in that way. I learn that Hancock has not been asked by the\r\ngeneral committee to go into Penna. He is very strong there. I fear we\r\nhave neglected the soldiers too much. It seems to me that some military\r\nexhibition on our side is the only thing to be done before the Penna.\r\nelections. If it is made a 'reception' of these generals it cannot be a\r\nfailure, as there will be a great turn-out to see them. General Slocum\r\nshould also be there.

I felt\r\na delicacy in doing so, but the necessity is so great that I sent him\r\nthe request by Mr. Mather. It will do us great harm if he declines. Our\r\npeople have looked for his return with anxiety. He has more power in\r\nPenna. than any living man. This I learned when I spoke there in 1864.\r\nHis visit will wipe out the effect of the soldiers' convention. As he\r\nwas with me when Penna. was invaded, he can do me much good. I did not\r\nfeel I could in my letter to him say as much as I felt. The soldiers\r\nare not inclined to go for Grant.

This allegation is denied in the\r\nmost positive and comprehensive manner by an affidavit of Mr. Sage.\r\nThat denial is corroborated by affidavits of one or more persons\r\nmost intimately acquainted [with] his affairs. I find no difficulty\r\nin giving full credence to these denials from my own knowledge of\r\nMr. Sage, his methods and habits of business, his transactions and\r\ninvestments. They are all incompatible with his being engaged in any\r\nsuch scheme. I have known him well for years. He is about the last\r\nman to enter into any combination which would limit the freedom of\r\nhis individual and personal action. He is not a lender of money as a\r\nbusiness or otherwise than of his temporary balances. His interests\r\nare all in favor of elevating rather than of depressing stocks, in\r\nwhich the bulk of his property is invested. It would not need the\r\naffirmative proof which is offered to make me totally discredit the\r\nrepresentation that he was or could be involved in a combination of\r\nthe character and objects imputed to him. Mr. Sage is a man of rare\r\nability, energy, and enterprise; and his use of these powers is all in\r\nthe way of building up, constructing, developing. I am satisfied that\r\nthere is not the slightest ground for imputing to Mr. Sage anything\r\nbeyond the mere fact of receiving more than seven per cent. for the use\r\nof money. I hope that you will consider it consistent with your duty to\r\nconfine your sentence to the fine which you have applied to the other\r\ncases of the same character; and I am sure the judgment of the bar and\r\nof the entire community will sanction such a disposition of the case.\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary, in my view of the matter, to discuss the statute\r\nof 1837. It was peculiar in two respects: that it reversed the\r\nequity rule which had prevailed always before in this State and in\r\nEngland, that in cases of usury 'he who seeks equity must do equity';\r\nand that it added to the forfeiture at law of the money loaned a\r\ncriminal penalty. I remember it in its origin, its authorship, and the\r\ncircumstances under which it came into being. It was then deemed an\r\nextravagant and barbarous law. I have never known its criminal feature\r\nenforced until now. I presume that nearly all the community, as well as\r\nMr. Sage, were ignorant of the existence of a feature so anomalous in\r\nall jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to add that the case cannot be deemed one calling for any\r\nexceptional rigor; nor do any circumstances of aggravation exist to\r\njustify the infliction of a special indignity upon a man of character\r\nlike Mr. Sage, doing an act, not _malum in se_, universally practised\r\nand universally tolerated.\r\n\r\n\"With much respect,\r\n\r\n                                \"I remain,\r\n                                        \"Truly y'rs,\r\n                                                  \"S.

At the same time that I paid you the\r\n$10,000 I paid you also $1000 for Flagg's services to date as trustee,\r\nfor which you returned me voucher signed by A. C.

W.,[52] and was\r\narranged without any agency of mine, and the subsequent payment of it\r\nwas purely voluntary on your part.\r\n\r\n\"No intimation was ever made to me that it had any reference to or was\r\nto affect my relations to Mr. Flagg[53] as trustee under the several\r\nmortgages of the A. and G. W.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot doubt that it was known to you that I had acted as his\r\ncounsel for more than a year previous. Nor did I ever suspect that you\r\ndid not perfectly understand that I was still at liberty to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards, when Mr. McHenry[54] sought to retain me in reference to\r\nhis scheme for reorganizing the A. and G. W., and asked me to name the\r\namount--having looked into all the relations of parties, and having\r\nconsidered his plan--I declined to have anything to do with it in any\r\nmanner or for any purpose, and refused his retainer, repeatedly pressed\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\n\"In one of these interviews I informed him that the suits which had\r\nbeen commenced to foreclose the mortgages, if, as I understood them to\r\nbe, for I had not seen the papers, were objectionable, that, if a sale\r\nwere to be had, they must be reformed or abandoned, and new suit in\r\nproper form, and with proper parties, instituted; that Mr. Flagg--at\r\nthe instance of any bondholders, and possibly in an extreme case\r\nwithout their instance--ought to intervene for that purpose. To this\r\nview he yielded.\r\n\r\n\"When the lease proposed to be made by the receiver was brought to\r\nmy attention some weeks ago, the counsel of the Erie called on me to\r\nask my consideration of it as counsel for Mr. Flagg and of the first\r\nmortgage bondholders. He called on me to exercise my function in that\r\ncapacity; and had prolonged negotiations with me, not as an associate,\r\nbut as a representative of a different party.\r\n\r\n\"I heard no complaint until it happened that, while acting as counsel\r\nfor the trustees and bondholders, I did not do precisely what their\r\nadversaries preferred to have done.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I answer your question: You 'are not justified in being surprised\r\nthat I am acting for the trustee and his bondholders \"without notice\"'\r\nto you. You had notice all the time that I was at liberty so to act,\r\nand much of the time that I was so acting. If you _are_ surprised,\r\nyou are under some misapprehension as to the situation. I would have\r\nomitted no courtesy towards you. I had no suspicion that you did not\r\nunderstand my position exactly as I understand it.\r\n\r\n\"When the question as to the proposed lease came before me, suddenly\r\nand unexpectedly, it was with the declaration of Mr. Meyer that he was\r\n'opposed to it, unless I could show him reasons to the contrary, which\r\nhe did not think I could.' I looked at it to see if I could devise\r\nmodifications which would make it safe for the bondholders.\r\n\r\n\"The difficulty of the case is the _short_ and _uncertain_ duration\r\nof the lease. I was not able to see in it, _as drawn_, sufficient\r\nguards to satisfy the bondholders. I spent a morning with Mr. Lane\r\nand Mr. Meyer discussing amendments; and we left for Ohio, with the\r\nunderstanding between him and us that we should have a conference there\r\nupon the subject of amendment. It was only when the motion was on\r\nand the argument was about beginning that we learned to our surprise\r\nthat Mr. Backus had decided that no negotiation for any modification\r\nwould be entertained. So the question had to be argued as it stood.\r\nJust before I left Cleveland, Mr. Backus said to me that if we would\r\nrecognize the advance ($1,390,000) as to be ultimately paid, he would\r\ndo everything to give us security in the operation of the lease; and,\r\nif, when I got to New York, it was thought advisable to negotiate,\r\nhe would come here on your request. After my return I _did think_ it\r\nadvisable to consider the question, and so said to Mr. Lane; but he\r\ndeclined. Shortly after, the motion in Philadelphia, of which Mr.\r\nCuyler had given notice, in pursuance of a reservation he had caused to\r\nbe made in the original order, came on.\r\n\r\n\"I allude to these circumstances to show that I have treated you fairly\r\nand considerately while in an adversary position on this question of\r\ntemporary lease.\r\n\r\n\"One word as to Mr. Flagg. The payment of the $1000 for his services\r\nwas due him, and should have been provided for. I first called the\r\nattention of Col. Stebbins to it, and then yours. The purchase of the\r\nbonds of Mr. Flagg--to a trifling amount--was no greater favor than had\r\nbeen accorded on a large scale to parties who had stood in the way of\r\nthe arrangement for the close of the receivership and the making of the\r\nlease. That he had taken no selfish care for himself did not seem any\r\nreason why he should be treated with less consideration. I submitted\r\nthe matter to you as the proper party. You treated it with equity and\r\ncourtesy. You are entitled to the same spirit from Mr. Flagg. But you\r\ncould not have supposed that he would be unfaithful in any respect to\r\nhis trust.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, what the first mortgage bondholders want is:\r\n\r\n\"1. That the suit for foreclosure should be prosecuted, in proper form\r\nand with proper parties, to give a good title at the sale, and that\r\nthey be represented in these suits by their own agent and not by agents\r\nof any adversary party.\r\n\r\n\"2. That, if a sale and purchase of the property be made which\r\noperates to discharge their lien, with or without an agreement for\r\nreorganization, the title be taken by satisfactory agents for their\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\"That in the mean time the property be protected and further debts in\r\npriority to their rights be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"With these conditions observed, the first mortgage bondholders have\r\nevery desire to preserve the best relations with the Erie, which is\r\nthe natural and preferred connection. That is my advice. That is their\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish any conference on the points on which differences have\r\narisen as to the proposed lease, or as to the general relations of the\r\ntwo roads, I shall be happy to obtain an appointment for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment the faculties of the parties would be better employed\r\nin devising a complete and permanent harmony of interests than in\r\nlitigation. I think, also, that to attempt to discard from the\r\nnegotiations the divisional bonds which represent most of the value in\r\nthe property is a practical mistake.\r\n\r\n                      \"Very respectfully, Yours, &c.,\r\n                                                  \"S.

Indeed, as I look\r\nupon my own future, totally void of any conscious desire for the most\r\nhonorable of official labors, it seems to me I feel more difficulty in\r\nwounding--any more than I at last must--those who are capable of fixing\r\nstrong affections on objects of an elevated ambition.\r\n\r\n\"I need not say how strong--and stronger than in other cases--is the\r\npersonal interest I feel in promoting what shall be finally agreed to\r\nbe best in respect to your future career, or how disposed I should be\r\nto give the prevailing weight to your own ideas on that subject.\r\n\r\n\"While it is not safe to assume the action of a convention, I should\r\nthink that besides those who will go for you on public grounds and from\r\npersonal regard, there will be an element which would like to remove\r\nyou from the field of active politics. I thought, from December to very\r\nrecently, this was visible in respect to me, and perhaps there may be\r\neven greater motive in respect to you in that you were more likely to\r\nbecome a rival to some existing powers.\r\n\r\n\"Before I had quite finished my note, which lay over from last evening,\r\nyours of yesterday came.\r\n\r\n\"You perhaps interpret it rather more strongly than I intended. I aimed\r\nonly to suggest the topic, and naturally stated the _cons_ rather than\r\nthe _pros_.\r\n\r\n\"I will endeavor to see you, as you suggest, at Albion, before the\r\nconvention, unless something happens to make this inadvisable.\r\n\r\n\"And letter-writing is so insufficient for such topics that I reserve\r\nthe discussion till then.\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, consider what is the method of proceeding in nominating the\r\n_four_. Is that to be done singly, or on one ballot?\r\n\r\n                                \"In haste,\r\n                                       \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                  \"S.

I infer that you are opposed\r\nto my taking a nomination for chief judge, and it is quite likely you\r\nare right about it; but I feel that there has been a great _break_\r\nin my life, and that it may be as well to start on a new track. My\r\nreputation is now fair, and on the bench I can keep it so, until I want\r\nto use it for my own benefit and that of my friends, and I think I can\r\naid you politically as much as I can to remain as I am. I shall, of\r\ncourse, object to being regarded as '_shelved_' by the operation, and\r\nyet such may be the result, and some people will doubtless favor my\r\nnomination for that reason. _They may be awfully mistaken, but this is\r\nconfidential._\r\n\r\n\"I shall not dare to go to Rochester next week, lest the excitement\r\nmight produce a relapse; but you must come here and see me the day\r\nbefore the convention, which you can easily do, and then we can talk\r\nthe whole thing up--as you say, it cannot be written. Don't fail to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly yours,\r\n                     \"S. E. CHURCH.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. C. and Nellie send regards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO JOHN R.

But I do not change the feelings with which I regard the nomination\r\nfor the chief judge, and have regarded it since it was presented\r\nto my view in December, or weakened the settled preference I have\r\nfor freedom and relaxation over even such an honorable distinction.\r\nNotwithstanding such a definitive purpose on my part, I hope that you\r\nwill take care to send a good delegate, because you and I will probably\r\nnever have another chance of doing so much service to the community in\r\nwhich we live, or to the profession to which we belong, as in securing\r\nthe best possible selection for judge of the judicial court under a\r\ncomparatively permanent tenure.\r\n\r\n  \"Very Truly,\r\n           \"Yours, &c.,\r\n                     S.

JOHN GANSON\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Apl. 22nd, '70_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I shall regret it extremely if you cannot extricate\r\nyourself from the embarrassments which you mention and I appreciate;\r\nand yet come to the convention, if not as a delegate, at least as an\r\noutsider. Such an occasion will not be likely to occur in your time\r\nor mine, and ought we not seize it to do something of real value to\r\nour four millions of people and to pay the debt which Lord Coke says a\r\nlawyer owes to his profession?\r\n\r\n\"I have often thought and talked of you as eminently suitable to take\r\na part in the reconstructed court, but have heard that you were not\r\nready to sacrifice the large gains of your professional career. You\r\nare over-modest in the suggestion of one or two friends desiring you\r\nto come to a different conclusion; for I have talked with a large\r\nnumber who looked to you, and whose motives cannot be imputed as mere\r\nfriendship, but spring from a sense of public utility, in securing to\r\nthe public service your abilities and independent integrity. Indeed,\r\nGrover told me some time ago that he would not be a candidate if you\r\nwould be; and I think the same concession would have been generally\r\nmade, at least at an earlier day.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to myself, I cannot reconcile myself to the idea of\r\nbeing tied up for a series of years. I prefer freedom and a period\r\nof relaxation to any honors which involve permanent and laborious\r\nduties. In December, and repeatedly since, the suggestion from Albany\r\nhas been made to me that I might have a general support from that and\r\nthis part of the State for chief, in which those not supposed to be\r\nthe most friendly would concur, and a considerable number of similar\r\ntenders have come to me from other quarters; but to all, by letter\r\nand verbally, and among others to Cassidy, each, and Allen--and to\r\nComstock, who is an affirmatively [_sic_] candidate, to Kernan and\r\nO'Conor--I have stated my purpose, and I have no disposition to change\r\nit. It is not that I undervalue these great trusts, but I am content\r\nthat they go to those to whose more robust natures and physical vigor\r\nthe same considerations which influence me are not applicable, and\r\nto those in whose peculiar condition they are an object of laudable\r\nambition. If I can help to get a good selection, and then to elect the\r\nticket, I shall consider myself as concentrating in a few days all the\r\npublic service I could perform in the whole 14 years; and so having\r\ncompletely acquitted myself to my day and generation, become entitled\r\nto a play spell.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear sir, it is in just this matter that I regret to lose your\r\nco-operation. _You_, if present as a delegate or as an outsider, could\r\nhelp largely in the selection of members from all parts of the state.\r\nFor this city--if the bar were to control as it now stands--they would\r\nunite on Rappallo, but whether he can get any political support or not\r\nremains to be seen. He has been one of Vanderbilt's counsel, but I have\r\noften put him with you when I have said that, with the best quality of\r\nmen, that consideration could be wholly disregarded.\r\n\r\n\"Can you extricate yourself from the embarrassments to which you\r\nallude--or be neutral on that case--and come and help as to others?\r\n\r\n\"Remember that for your time as well as mine this occasion is not\r\nlikely to recur.\r\n\r\n\"I sat down to say this, and must beg you to excuse me for the long\r\nletter I have poured out upon you.\r\n\r\n  \"Very Truly,\r\n           \"Yours, &c.,\r\n                     \"S.

CASS\r\n\r\n(JAY GOULD'S RETAINER)\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _June 2d, 1870_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--You will recollect that some time ago I requested you\r\nto give me a statement in respect to the circumstances attending an\r\narrangement communicated to me by you in the winter of 1869, by which\r\nthe Erie Railway Company paid me a retainer of $10,000 in connection\r\nwith the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company, a majority of the\r\nstock of which was then owned by the Erie Railway Company. You deferred\r\nit, in consequence of the pressure upon time. I should now like to have\r\nyou furnish me the statement.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I applied to you was that my original information as to the\r\npurposes of this retainer was derived exclusively from you; and that it\r\nwas under this information, in no respect changed by anything derived\r\nfrom other sources, that I accepted the payment. The facts, so far as\r\nthey are within my knowledge, are these: Early in 1869--I presume it\r\nmust have been in January of that year--you asked me to consent to\r\nbecome a director of the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company and a\r\nmember of the executive committee of that company, holding the balance\r\nof power between the other two members in case of their disagreement.\r\nYou stated the object to be to make an amiable arrangement between the\r\nparties then litigating in an Ohio court, whereby the railroad could\r\nbe taken out of the possession of the receiver and restored to the\r\nmanagement of the company; and that as a part of the same compromise\r\nyou were to become a director with others who were to be agreed upon.\r\nYou will remember that I replied that I was already burdened with work\r\nin the capacity of director in other companies, which consumed an\r\ninconvenient share of my time and thought, and without remuneration;\r\nthat the tendency of such work was to become more encroaching; that\r\nI had entered upon it in every instance only under the influence of\r\nexisting relations, and was desirous to relieve myself of such duties\r\nas I had already done in some cases; and that I was unwilling to take\r\nsuch a trust in respect to a company in which I had no interest, and\r\nhad never had any relations. You and Mr. McCullough repeatedly pressed\r\nme not to positively refuse; and when I was elected it was without\r\nany assent on my part. One day you mentioned to me that Mr. Jay Gould\r\nhad proposed that the Erie should pay me $10,000, the Cleveland and\r\nPittsburg $5000, and the Fort Wayne $5000. I certainly understood that\r\nthose payments were proposed to be made in respect to services or\r\nbenefits expected in connected with the arrangement for the change in\r\nthe condition and management of the Cleveland and Pittsburg Company,\r\nand nothing else. Your communication related to that matter and to\r\nthat alone. You will remember that when you mentioned the proposal\r\nto me I made no comment, and manifested no interest in it or desire\r\nthat it should be adopted. Afterwards, when Mr. Gould mentioned the\r\nmatter to me he made no further or different explanation, but spoke of\r\nit as if it were a matter which I already completely understood. He\r\nsubsequently, a second time, mentioned that he was going to send me\r\na check, and about the last of February did send it. I never did or\r\nsaid anything about the matter except to accept and receipt for the\r\ncheck. The Cleveland and Pittsburg Company, at a meeting when I was\r\nnot present, but believe you were, adopted a resolution appointing me\r\ntheir counsel, with a monthly salary at the rate of $5000 a year. I had\r\nsupposed they would have put it in one payment, but they adopted such\r\nform as they pleased. The Fort Wayne never mentioned the subject to\r\nme, nor I to it. I had relations to it, but none to the Cleveland and\r\nPittsburg or to the Erie. The proposition to make the payments by those\r\ntwo companies was purely their own; the amounts were fixed without any\r\nconsultation with me, and on their own estimate of the utility of the\r\narrangement to them. In expressing to you my repugnance to undertaking\r\nthe services, I did not contemplate any condition as to pecuniary\r\ncompensation. Nor can I now say that any such consideration was a\r\nprincipal inducement to my aiding in the trust. I could not foresee\r\nhow much of labor or trouble I was to undertake. I did not desire\r\nmore business, but less. I had during the two years before repeatedly\r\ndeclined retainers from the Erie and from its adversaries. The object\r\nof the arrangement was attained. The receivership was closed and the\r\nadministration of the road was restored to the Cleveland and Pittsburg\r\nCompany. I served out my term as director, as member of the executive\r\ncommittee, and as counsel of the company, and gave every necessary\r\nattention to those duties. When this was done I deemed that I had\r\nperformed all I had undertaken, and that the C. and P. and the Erie had\r\nrealized all they had contemplated in the arrangement which they had\r\nproposed, and in the payments which they had voluntarily made.\r\n\r\n\"It was not until in February last, when I was acting for the trustees\r\nof the bondholders of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway Company,\r\nthat I learned with surprise that Mr. Gould entertained the idea that\r\nthe implied engagement in accepting the retainer before mentioned\r\nextended beyond the affair of the Cleveland and Pittsburg, to which the\r\narrangement exclusively related. I answered him at the time. But the\r\ncircumstance that he did entertain such an idea induces me to address\r\nyou this letter.\r\n\r\n                            \"With much respect,\r\n                                        \"Yours very truly,\r\n                                                  \"S.

They threaten with swift destruction\r\ncivil liberty and the whole fabric of our free institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_National Government._\r\n\r\n\"The Democratic party was originally organized by Jefferson to oppose\r\nthese evils. It ruled the country for fifty of the seventy years of\r\nthe present century, and protected us from disunion on the one hand\r\nand from centralism on the other, and from corruption. Under twelve\r\nyears of rule of the Republican party, the Federal government is\r\nrapidly usurping power from the localities and from individuals, and\r\nhas become more corrupt than was ever imagined possible. The masses\r\nof the Republicans, like the masses of all parties, are honest. No\r\ndoubt some allowance ought to be made for the effect of a great war.\r\nBut the system of false finance which has corrupted us into a nation\r\nof gamblers was as unnecessary as corrupting. And the principle and\r\nmeasures of the Republican party, their centralism, tariffs not for\r\nrevenue but to control the labor and capital of the people, legislative\r\ngrants and jobs of all kinds tend to corruption. And the ideal standard\r\nof their statesmen is lower than any ever held by the followers of\r\nJefferson and Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_State Government._\r\n\r\n\"In 1846, twenty-five years ago, I went to the Assembly to sustain the\r\nadministration of Silas Wright. Not a man in either House was even\r\nsuspected of corruption. The Democracy under Martin Van Buren, Silas\r\nWright, William L. Marcy, and Azariah C. Flagg had ruled the State\r\nduring the life of the old Constitution from 1821 to 1846. They were\r\nall men not only of transcendent ability, but of personal purity. They\r\ngathered around them men of like character in all the counties. They\r\nwielded party power not only in favor of good measures, but in favor\r\nof good men. No corrupt Senator or Assemblyman could live in their\r\natmosphere. The race ran out.\r\n\r\n\"From 1846 to 1870--23 years--the Democracy never had a majority in the\r\nSenate, and but twice a small majority in the Assembly. Those bodies\r\nbecame what the Republicans, and the party from which they sprang, have\r\nmade them. When William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed came into power the\r\ncharacter of the legislative bodies fell in an instant, and during all\r\nthe 23 years of Republican ascendancy it continued to fall.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] A James Gordon Bennett, Senior, the founder of the New York\r\n_Herald_.\r\n\r\n[43] A fellow-citizen of Governor Seymour in Oneida County.

That the evils and abuses in the local government of the city of\r\nNew York are general characteristics of the Democratic party, and would\r\noccur in the Federal government if that party should come into power at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\"This argument, fallacious though it be, is likely to satisfy the\r\nRepublican mind and to animate it to effectiveness; and to confuse\r\nand embarrass the Democratic mind, and render it ineffective, if not\r\nirresolute. The immense preponderance of the Republicans in journalism,\r\nand the situation of this local cancer, directly under the focus of\r\nthat journalism, which makes it more conspicuous to the eye of the\r\ncountry than a hundred such would be if existing in remote or obscure\r\nparts--the peculiar and remarkable clearness and certainty of the\r\nproofs compared with the inferential and argumentative nature of the\r\nevidence in such cases usually, are circumstances which go far to\r\nenable the Republicans to succeed in propagating this idea. We are out.\r\nOur case requires not merely firmness in holding our position by our\r\nveterans, but affirmative, aggressive action, resulting in accessions\r\nfrom the hostile or neutral, captures from the enemy. If the higher\r\n_morale_--the better weapons, the stronger ammunition--are not _with_\r\nus, but _against_ us, how are we to be capable of the kind of warfare\r\nnecessary to the situation?\r\n\r\n\"2. The second idea is that the leading Democratic journals _defend_\r\nthe wrongs alleged, thus impliedly adopting them or admitting a\r\nresponsibility for them, which does not allow of disavowal and\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\n\"A mode of discussion which countenances such a construction is not\r\nonly wrong but foolish, both in respect to the party and the journal.\r\nAll that can be conceded to the accused is the benefit of whatever\r\ndoubts may exist as to their guilt. It will not do to set off similar\r\nwrongs alleged against the other party, for that, if frequently\r\nrepeated, will gradually foster in the public mind the conclusion\r\nthat we admit these wrongs to be properly carried to our side of the\r\naccount. The idea should be kept _all the while_ before the public mind\r\nthat the Democratic party is not responsible for these wrongs; that it\r\nwill be foremost in punishing the authors and foremost in adopting all\r\nmeasures necessary to prevent their recurrence. The _first_ impression\r\nis important, and persistent repetitions of that impression are\r\nnecessary to affect the public mind. The point of the article which was\r\ncommended by Mr. Kernan, Gov.

I think the party in\r\nthe interior are all right if properly attended to. The awful 'botch'\r\nmade in suppressing the riot, and the ventilation of financial matters\r\nin N.

How does Hall relish the position\r\nin which he has been forced? It is so long since I have heard from you\r\nthat I almost think you have forgotten me.

TILDEN (CIRCULAR LETTER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE\r\nCOMMITTEE)\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Sept. 11, 1871_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--The time between the meeting of the State convention and\r\nthe election being a little shorter than usual, it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to begin preparations for the canvass _at once_, so that\r\neven more than the ordinary period for organization will be afforded.\r\nThe poll-book for your district has been already sent to the chairman\r\nof your county committee, and may be had on application to him.\r\n\r\n\"The Democracy have never been called on to act when _wisdom_ and\r\n_courage_, and _devotion_ to _principle_ and to _right_ were more\r\nneeded than at the State convention about to be held.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to you, therefore, to attend the primary meeting which will\r\nchoose delegates to your Assembly district or county convention, and to\r\nsend to that convention your most discreet and best citizens, in order\r\nthat they in turn may choose as delegates to the State convention men\r\n_eminent_ for _judgment_, _integrity_, and _honor_, and who have, in\r\nthe largest degree, the trust and confidence of their fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n\"_Centralism_ in _government_ and _corruption_ in _administration_ are\r\nthe twin evils of our times. They threaten with swift destruction not\r\nonly civil liberty, but the whole fabric of our free institutions.\r\n\r\n\"The Democratic party was organized by Jefferson to oppose these\r\nidentical evils. It conducted the national government for fifty of\r\nthe seventy years of the present century, and gave the people safety,\r\nprosperity, and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"The present demoralization has happened under the ascendency of the\r\nRepublican party; and though the mass of them, like the mass of all\r\nparties, are honest in their intentions, and some allowance ought to be\r\nmade for the demoralizing influence of a great civil war, more of these\r\nresults are to be ascribed to the utterly false and corrupting system\r\nof finance unnecessarily adopted by these Republican administrations;\r\nand there is no doubt the tendency of the principles and measures of\r\nthe Republican party is unfavorable to purity in government.\r\n\r\n\"In the State, the Democracy ruled for twenty-five years--from 1821 to\r\n1846--under Van Buren, Wright, Marcy, and Flagg; and corruption, always\r\ncondemned and punished by them, was almost unknown.\r\n\r\n\"In the 24 years from 1847 to 1870 the Democracy never had a majority\r\nin the Senate. Twice only did it have a slender majority in the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\"The Republicans had the legislative power of the State, and that is\r\nnow the government both at Washington and at Albany.\r\n\r\n\"The Republicans made the morals of the legislative bodies what they\r\nhave recently been. When Seward and Weed took the place of Wright,\r\nMarcy, and Flagg, public and official morality fell in the twinkling of\r\nan eye.\r\n\r\n\"Even as to the city government of New York, until 1870, it was exactly\r\nwhat the Republican legislatures made it. The Republican party was born\r\nin 1855. In 1856 it swept the State by 80,000. In the Senate of 1857\r\nthe Democrats had but 4 out of 32 members; in the Assembly, but 37 out\r\nof 128.\r\n\r\n\"Then the Republicans made the city charter under which we have lived\r\nuntil 1870. At the same session the same hand which created the\r\nRepublican party created also the supervisor's board, which has been\r\nthe source of all the corruptions in our city government.\r\n\r\n\"The league between corrupt Republicans and corrupt Democrats which\r\nwas formed during Republican ascendency was too strong for honest men\r\nin 1870. The charter of that year had the votes of nearly all the\r\nRepublicans. I denounced it in a public speech.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever the gangrene of corruption has reached the Democratic party\r\nwe must take a knife and cut it out by the roots.\r\n\r\n  \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nW. F. HAVEMEYER TO R. B. CONNOLLY\r\n\r\n                           \"NEW YORK, _September 16, 1871_.\r\n\r\n  \"RICHARD B. CONNOLLY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--I have considered the question which you have submitted to me;\r\nand, to prevent the possibility of misapprehension, reduce my advice to\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n\"1. On the assumption of your innocence of the charges made\r\nagainst you, I do not consider resignation of your office as your\r\nproper course. Your duty is to give every facility to the fullest\r\ninvestigation, and to abide the result.\r\n\r\n\"2. In your answer to the request of Mayor Hall for your resignation,\r\nyou have stated that your official acts which have been impeached were\r\n'supervised and approved by the superior vigilance' of Mayor Hall;\r\nthat equal responsibility for them attaches to him, and that, in his\r\naffidavits in the pending litigation, those acts were adopted and\r\nvindicated by him.\r\n\r\n\"Even if you are conscious of having done wrong in your trust, you owe\r\nit to the community not to commit another wrong, but to make every\r\nreparation within your power.\r\n\r\n\"To surrender your office into the hands of a confederate would be a\r\nfresh betrayal of your trust; and, while it might damage yourself,\r\nwould fail of doing justice to the community. You practically make\r\nyour own successor. As the law now stands, he can assume your office\r\nonly by an arrangement to which you are a party to create a vacancy\r\nfor him. The man you give place to ought not to be the tool of those\r\nimplicated in the transactions which excite the public distrust and\r\nalarm. He should be the nominee of the citizens now seeking to protect\r\nthe people. In that way alone can he have the confidence of the public,\r\nor sustain the credit of the city.\r\n\r\n\"No man selected by Mayor Hall can, without some other moral support\r\nfrom the community, have the public confidence. He will be compromised\r\nby a previous understanding with the Rodin of the 'ring' or by the\r\nacceptance of the favor.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, the law affords a perfect solution of the case. By sec.\r\n3, chap. 574 of the laws of 1871, you are authorized to appoint a\r\ndeputy comptroller who, in addition to his other powers, possesses\r\nevery power and shall perform every duty belonging to the office\r\nof comptroller whenever the said comptroller shall by due written\r\nauthority, and during a period to be specified in such authority,\r\n'designate and authorize the said deputy comptroller to possess the\r\npower and perform the duty aforesaid.'\r\n\r\n\"My advice to you is to forthwith appoint Andrew H. Green as such\r\ndeputy comptroller; to leave him to exercise the full powers of your\r\noffice without conditions and without interference; with complete\r\ncustody of all books and papers belonging to your office; with the\r\nappointment of all persons whom he may think necessary to protect the\r\npublic property and interests, and to enable him to carry out the most\r\nsearching investigations, and to aid the committees appointed for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"I have carefully considered the selection I recommend. Mr. Green has\r\nknowledge and experience in the affairs of the city; has the most\r\nreliable character for integrity; has no relations which could mislead\r\nhim by bad influences, and is strong in the public confidence. If you\r\nadopt my advice I shall insist on his accepting the disagreeable duty\r\nfor the sake of the public interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nW. F. HAVEMEYER TO A. H. GREEN\r\n\r\n  \"_Sept. 16, 1871._\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--In advising the comptroller as to certain questions\r\nwhich he has submitted to me, I have deemed it best to adopt the\r\nshortest and most direct way to get at the condition of affairs in\r\nthe comptroller's office and of the city government, in order that\r\nthe public may have the earliest information relating [thereto]. To\r\nthis end, I have advised the comptroller to appoint you his deputy,\r\nand to commit to you all the powers of his office without conditions\r\nor restrictions. This he has consented to do, and I enclose his\r\nappointment without conditions. I have no doubt that this position in\r\nthe present condition of affairs will be most distasteful to you, but\r\nI deem it your duty promptly to accept its duties, and to do what you\r\ncan to aid in restoring order and system in the financial affairs of\r\nthe city. I have advised him not to resign, but as the best thing that\r\ncan be done, under the circumstances, to appoint a deputy in whom the\r\npublic has confidence. Of course you cannot accept the position with\r\nany restrictions as to the future or the past.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n                 \"W. F. HAVEMEYER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nR. B. CONNOLLY TO A. H.

I think it would be very inexpedient to take Mr. Green out of the\r\ncity for 24 hours. He ought _not_ to go to Rochester.\r\n\r\n\"3.

It is not a bad name, and\r\nmight do a man good who sought preferment, if he could get it to stick.\r\nHandy Andy blundered, to be sure, but he was faithful and honest in\r\nthe last degree, and his blunders were true Irish bulls; they excited\r\nmerriment, thus doing good to the souls and bodies of the observers; a\r\ncertain _naïve_ wit hung around each erroneous conception that evinced\r\na good motive; besides, there was in each a singular approximation to\r\ncleverness and a kind Providence always effectively gainsaid any actual\r\nevil in the results.\r\n\r\n                               \"Yrs. truly,\r\n                                                   \"CH.

O'CONOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHORATIO SEYMOUR TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"UTICA, _October 8, 1871_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I have not been well since I got back from Rochester,\r\nbut I have turned over the state of things in my mind, and I now sit\r\ndown to give you the ends I have reached. When I left home I thought\r\nour friends had made up their minds to take high ground. When I met\r\nLord and others at your room I saw at once 'the switch had been\r\nchanged.' When Lord asked about the ticket I knew that a party had been\r\nmade up to which you and Kernan and myself were not to be invited. Of\r\nthat I am proud. All of the officeholders, the canal contractors, etc.,\r\nare in it. Warren, DeWolf, and Cassidy lead the move. It is not in my\r\nheart to say an unkind word of Cassidy. In many ways he has had a hard\r\ntime. His fine mind has been used by others while he was left poor. It\r\nwas the strange policy of the Central Railroad men to give wealth to\r\nWeed and others, who fought them if they did not, while Cassidy was\r\nhelped to live by loans and in other ways which kept him poor. When\r\nTweed went to Albany he turned a stream of patronage into the _Argus_\r\noffice which made it strong and rich. I think Cassidy means, in the\r\nmain, to stand up for the right, but it is hard for him to strike men\r\nwho have lifted him into wealth and when all about him shrink back.\r\nNow what are we to do? A new party is made up, and we are outside of\r\nit. For this I am glad. But this is not all. We may forgive others,\r\nbut the men who have left us will not forgive us. The old ties are\r\nbroken. They have yielded to temptation, and now they are like church\r\nmembers who have fallen from grace; they not only hate to meet their\r\nminister, but they learn to hate him. This feeling cropped out at\r\nRochester. They were glad to hit us, and the young men would have done\r\nmore if the wiser ones had not held them back. You would have been put\r\noff the State committee and McQuade would have had the seat of Kernan\r\nif they had thought it wise. All things were made ready to do both of\r\nthese acts. While Kernan was thrown off of his guard by Van Buren's\r\nassurances that his seat would not be contested, the committee on\r\ncredentials was made up; their names were known to McQuade's friends,\r\nand an active canvass was made in his behalf. The plan was either to\r\nreject Kernan or to keep him out until the Tammany men were made sure\r\nthat their seats would not be filled. I made up my mind to go home. I\r\ntold Mr. Warren I would not act as president of the convention. In the\r\nevening I was very ill, and when the committee called upon me I said\r\nI was not well enough to go into convention. This was true, but I am\r\nsorry I put that reason out. I was in so much pain that I had not my\r\nwits about me. I should have said to them, as I did to Warren, simply\r\nthat I would not preside.\r\n\r\n\"Now what are we to do? You know that I hold that all that a man does\r\nabout politics after he is sixty years old is only meddling with other\r\npeople's business. But duty may force us to act, and then how do we\r\nstand? The Democratic leaders and organization are dead against us. The\r\nmembers of the convention went home pleased with the diplomacy of their\r\nleaders, but with lower tone of morality than they had when they left\r\nhome. The young men we looked to with hope in the future are debauched.\r\nThey were willing to have Tammany coaxed out of the convention and then\r\nto slam the door in the face of the honest men who had unearthed crime\r\nin New York. When the leaders had done their work on Thursday noon\r\nthe Tammany men stood in the light of having acted in a high-toned,\r\ngenerous way. The convention was grateful to them for allowing it to\r\nsay stealing was wrong in a way that should hurt no one's feelings.\r\nThe anti-Tammany men were in disgrace and disfavor. The majority of\r\nconvention wanted to leave matters in that shape, and they were angry\r\nwhen you and Kernan and West and others forced them to do a few decent\r\nacts. I think you saved the ticket by this. I know you saved your\r\nhonor. You must now count upon the hostility of old supporters and of\r\nall State officials. You are in the way. If you mean to fight you can\r\ndo so by means of the new parties in New York. You must hold them up\r\nto the highest tone and to untiring activity. You must put yourself at\r\nthe head of the reformers and use your list of correspondents for any\r\npapers you wish to send out to enlist the country against frauds. I\r\nhave stated all the odds against you, but you can whip the party back\r\nto right grounds if you wish to do so.

The\r\nacceptance and election to the Assembly of O'Conor would, in my\r\njudgment, aside from what he might be able to accomplish by official\r\naction, be productive of a good moral effect that is incalculable.\r\nHe occupies a position to-day prouder than that of any President\r\nor crowned head. Universally recognized as the foremost man of the\r\nbar, and unreservedly trusted as a guardian of the people's rights\r\nand interests in a time of great peril, all eyes are turned towards\r\nhim as a sort of savior in this era of corruption in governmental\r\nadministration.

You have\r\nled, are the leaders of, the fight against the machine, and, of course,\r\nhave incurred the hostility and hatred of the machine men and their\r\nhenchmen in different parts of the State. The fight will be continued\r\nin various forms at Albany during the session of the Legislature, and\r\nyou ought to be there to direct it, as well as to do service on the\r\nfloor of the Assembly. Our Democratic press, that is heartily in the\r\ngood work, must speak out fully and boldly of all proceedings this\r\nwinter, and not leave iniquity to be cloaked and public sentiment to be\r\nformed by subsidized newspapers and newspaper correspondents at Albany.\r\nI have never given Albany matters during the session much attention\r\nheretofore, but next winter it will not be my fault if the public of\r\nwestern New York do not learn through the _Union_ what is going on, and\r\nall that is going on.\r\n\r\n\"Everything here looks well.

One of these,\r\nin particular, is cool--suggesting to _me_ that 'the true policy _now_\r\nis to cut loose from Tammany Hall'!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"_Oct. 28, 1871._\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--I answered, declining, and they have determined to run\r\nHoratio Seymour without asking his consent.\r\n\r\n\"My letter, very full and condemnatory, is ready for the press.

I am desirous of placing on record, by the side\r\nof the 'Chapter of Erie,' an account of the Tammany frauds and their\r\nhistory, given by a person whose authority is decisive. In view of\r\nthe further questions relating to New York government, likely to come\r\nup before your legislature and in the press, it seems probable that a\r\nclear and a non-partisan (that is, not Republican) statement of the\r\ncase may be of political value as well as of historical interest.\r\n\r\n\"An account, therefore, of the Tammany frauds and their occasion, of\r\nthe struggle of Tammany to maintain itself after the discovery, and of\r\nthe means by which it was overthrown, and, finally, an expression of\r\nopinion as to the proper means of preventing such evils in the future,\r\nseems to me to be required.\r\n\r\n\"I know of no one except yourself who is capable of doing this\r\nproperly. You alone know the private history of the affair, and have\r\nthe means of estimating the actors at their proper value. I venture,\r\ntherefore, to ask you to do it. If, as I believe, this story is to\r\nbecome historical, I am anxious that historians should be rightly\r\ninformed as to the facts.\r\n\r\n\"In case there is any chance of your undertaking the task, I shall hope\r\nto hear from you shortly.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, y'r obt.

I propose to\r\naddress the latter, if you will graciously pardon the intrusion.\r\n\r\n\"I learn that Mr. Peckham intends procuring from the Oyer and Terminer\r\nG. J. a duplicate charge agst. me for official neglect. It is in your\r\n_power_ to advise against and prevent this. I think, sir, I can satisfy\r\nyou that such advice will be in harmony with that unflinching standard\r\nof justice by which you measure all men and all things.\r\n\r\n\"I have filed an unqualified stipulation that pending charges be\r\nremoved to the O. and T. The removal order has been entered. This would\r\nhave been done before except that Mr. Vanderpool expected Judge Bedford\r\nto sit and make it _pro forma_. There is, therefore, no legal necessity\r\nfor a duplicate. To press one now is only to wound the feelings of\r\nmy very interesting family by arousing fresh (and doubtless, at this\r\npartisan pitch, cruel) newspaper criticism, and without accomplishing\r\nany better oblation to justice (either to me or the people, as the\r\ncase may prove) than could be attained with existing pleading. And\r\nespecially when some weeks ago I wrote Atty.-Genl. Barlow I should\r\nalways be ready for his convenience.\r\n\r\n\"I think, sir, that ever since, in Sept., 1871, I became convinced of\r\nthe monstrous frauds (committed by men whose offences are condoned, or\r\nwhose battles are carried on over my shoulders, because I neither skulk\r\nnor avoid fight) I have done much to atone for any imputed neglect in\r\nmy acts as an auditor during the month of terrible mental trial to\r\nme which followed the inauguration of the new charter (May to June,\r\n1870), as well as to entitle me to consideration upon a mere question\r\nof discretion like this I now ask you to prefer to Mr. Peckham. I say\r\ndiscretion, because, were it a question in his mind of imperative right\r\ntowards his affirmative action, I could not insult you, nor him, nor\r\nmyself by the request to forego it. I shall always be willing to meet\r\nthe _necessary_ exactions of the law without asking favor. It is only\r\nagainst unnecessary applications I respectfully protest. Surely my\r\nunassailed administration as Dist.

CASS\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I was compelled by what seemed for the time to be\r\nthe most urgent of my many duties, to remain in Albany a little\r\nafter the diligent chairman of the judiciary committee had resumed\r\nthe investigations held in this city. In that interval, Mr. George\r\nTicknor Curtis thought it pertinent to the defence of Judge Barnard\r\nto introduce certain statements concerning me from Mr. Jay Gould. It\r\nhappened, also, that the examination on this topic was conducted with\r\nso little art--or with so much art--that it totally failed to elicit\r\nthe complete or substantial truth, and did produce, in practical\r\neffect, a mere falsehood. It happened further that, although the\r\ninvestigation is not public, the testimony on this point appears in\r\nthis morning's journals, with an exceptional fulness.\r\n\r\n\"If I had been present, I presume Mr. Gould's testimony could have been\r\ndeveloped so as to render any further statement to establish the exact\r\ntruth unnecessary. But as it was not, the series of accidents--such\r\nI will assume them to be--that have falsified the transaction, will\r\nexcuse me in asking you to state the truth which is peculiarly within\r\nyour personal knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"The _Herald_ report is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'_Q._ Did you employ any other counsel beside Messrs. Field and\r\nShearman, in behalf of the Erie Railroad?'\r\n\r\n\"'_A._ I employed several others.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Q._ Who were they?'\r\n\r\n\"'_A._ I had John Ganson, of Buffalo; Judge Diven, of Elmira; and\r\nSamuel J. Tilden, of New York.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Q._ When did you retain Samuel J. Tilden?'\r\n\r\n\"'_A._ In the year 1869.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Q._ Did you retain him before this order was granted?'\r\n\r\n\"'_A._ Yes, sir.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Q._ How much did you pay Mr. Tilden?'\r\n\r\n\"'_A._ Ten thousand dollars.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Q._ Did Mr. Tilden ever do anything for that ten thousand dollars?'\r\n\r\n\"'_A._ No, sir; on the contrary, I heard nothing about Mr. Tilden until\r\nhe turned up as counsel against the Erie Railroad in a case with the\r\nAtlantic and Great Western Railroad.'\r\n\r\n\"The _Times_ report varies a little:\r\n\r\n\"'Q. Did he ever act as your counsel?'\r\n\r\n\"'A. Never to my knowledge, nor did he ever return the retaining fee.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, it is within your personal knowledge that the fee paid me was\r\nfor a year's service as counsel and arbiter in the executive committee\r\nof the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company. The arrangement\r\nwas formed by you without my presence or knowledge; and the only\r\ncommunication of the terms of it ever made to me was by you.\r\n\r\n\"In January, 1869, the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad was placed\r\nin the possession of a receiver by an Ohio court, on the ground of\r\nfraud and breach of trust, committed or intended, by the then board of\r\ndirectors. Mr. Gould disavowed the acts complained of, and desired to\r\nhave the road restored to the management of a board of directors to be\r\nnewly constituted. You stated to me that the only feasible arrangement\r\nfor a compromise between the parties was this: The executive committee\r\nwas to be composed of myself, Mr. J. N. McCullough, the president,\r\nand Mr. Gould, who represented a majority of the stock then alleged\r\nto be held by the Erie Railway Company. I, who had no interest with\r\neither party, and was indifferent between them, was to hold the\r\nbalance of power between the two other members, and be able to decide\r\nevery question of law and every question of administration in respect\r\nto which they should differ. When the arrangement was submitted to\r\nme I declined the part allotted to me. I said I had no interest in\r\nthe company, and never had any relation to it which imposed a duty\r\nin respect to it upon me. I declined more than once to you and Mr.\r\nMcCullough, notwithstanding the arrangement had been made by which the\r\nErie was to contribute $10,000 and the C. and P. $5000 as compensation.\r\nI thought the trust might be troublesome and vexatious; and, at any\r\nrate, did not want the business. You, nevertheless, appointed me;\r\nand I afterwards acquiesced. I at no time made any conditions about\r\ncompensation. I never rendered a bill. The payments, when they were\r\nmade, were purely voluntary. I presume you do not doubt that nothing\r\nbut your personal persuasions and those of Mr. McCullough induced me\r\nfinally to acquiesce.\r\n\r\n\"You never communicated to me that there was any idea on anybody's\r\npart that I should owe any duty to the Erie Railway Company except to\r\nperform my duties as counsel, director, and arbiter in the executive\r\ncommittee of the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company. I never\r\nassumed _any other obligation_.\r\n\r\n\"That duty I performed during the whole year. Upon every question of\r\nlaw, of administration, of policy, I acted; and, as far as I know, with\r\nsatisfaction to everybody. I had no difficulty with Mr. Gould, who\r\nalways behaved with consideration and deference. He got the company out\r\nof its troubles, and largely enhanced the market value of the stock by\r\nthe arrangement, and appeared to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gould may well say that (except so far as acting in the Cleveland\r\nand Pittsburg was acting for the Erie) I never did act for the Erie\r\nin anything, so far as he knew. I never undertook to do so. There\r\nnever was any ground to pretend that in any of the litigations of that\r\ncompany it had any claim to aid, or shelter, or countenance from me.\r\n\r\n\"As to the Atlantic and Great Western, I never acted for the company.\r\nPrior to this time I had acted for Mr. A. C. Flagg and others, trustees\r\nunder several of the mortgages, and for certain bondholders; and Mr.\r\nGould knew it. Certainly, nothing in this engagement in the Cleveland\r\nand Pittsburg interfered with my right to continue to act for those\r\ntrustees and creditors, or to act anew for them. In January and\r\nFebruary, 1870, I argued before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and\r\nin the Ohio court, for the trustees and first mortgage bondholders,\r\nvarious questions as to the proposed lease. Mr. Gould faintly set up a\r\nclaim that he was entitled to notice from me; and I at once reminded\r\nhim that he knew all the time what my relations to the trustees and\r\nbondholders were, and had been for years, and that I had frequently,\r\nas _their_ representative, had conferences with the counsel of the\r\nErie. The union of the Atlantic and Great Western Company and the\r\ncreditors inferior to the first mortgage with the Erie, prevailed; and\r\na lease--which I believe all now agree was improvident and unwise--was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean to say that it might not happen that a retainer is\r\nsometimes received and yet no further services rendered in the case.\r\nI presume that this often happens without impropriety. I have only to\r\nsay that, so far as I recollect, it never has happened to me in any\r\nsingle instance of my professional life. I have been content to receive\r\ncompensation fixed by agreement with my clients after the services were\r\nrendered. I have, in no instance, had any controversy or difference of\r\nopinion with any client as to the amount of compensation. I have never\r\nheard of any discontent after the settlement, unless this may be such a\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\"Since there is an elaborate attempt to misrepresent an act of my\r\nprofessional life, I have a right to say this--without the imputation\r\nof egotism; and I have a right to add that, for the last sixteen years,\r\nat least, my only trouble has been not to accept more business than I\r\ncould perform according to my standard of duty and justice to those\r\nwho entrust their affairs to my management; that I have not accepted\r\nhalf which has been offered of cases in which the clients were willing\r\nthemselves to fix my compensation to my full satisfaction out of what\r\nthey would recognize as acknowledged benefits.\r\n\r\n\"And I have never hesitated to choose what business I would decline. At\r\nthe outset of the famous litigation of the Erie, under the presidency\r\nof Mr. Eldridge, it was communicated to me that the Erie desired to\r\nretain me; and afterwards Mr. J. C. Bancroft Davis, in its behalf,\r\ntwice came to my office to offer me retainers. I declined. In 1869,\r\nMr. James McHenry, when acting in apparent unison with the Erie,\r\nseveral times pressed upon me retainers in behalf of his scheme of\r\nreorganization of the A. & G. W.; but, after considering his scheme,\r\nI declined. In the same year Mr. James Fisk, Jr., called upon me with\r\nMr. Jay Gould. Mr. Fisk said, with many flattering suggestions, that\r\nthey desired to retain me in reference to a matter then pending, and in\r\nthe course of the interview he stated that they had paid within a year\r\n$125,000 to a member of the bar, whose name he mentioned. I declined.\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean to imply that there would have been anything wrong in\r\nacting as counsel for the Erie in a proper case; but simply, when\r\nan act of mine is challenged, to state facts which are pertinent to\r\nmy vindication. I have ever stood, not only in my personal conduct,\r\nbut in my public influence, for the dignity and honor of the bar and\r\nthe purity of the bench, and against whatever should tend to weaken\r\nor degrade the administration of justice. I did so, in 1869, when the\r\nevils of corrupt times were growing and powerful. I accepted issue in\r\nthe Democratic State convention of that year. On the 1st of February,\r\n1870, at the meeting which resulted in the formation of the Bar\r\nAssociation, I uttered these unpremeditated thoughts:\r\n\r\n\"'If the bar is to become merely a method of making money, making it\r\nin the most convenient way possible, _but making it_ AT ALL HAZARDS,\r\nthen the bar is _degraded_. If the bar is to be merely an institution\r\nthat seeks to win causes, and to win them by _back-door access to the\r\njudiciary_, then it is not only _degraded_, but it is CORRUPT.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I believe that this country is to-night at about the lowest point\r\nin the great cycle which we have occasionally to traverse. I believe\r\nthat there will come a sounder and a better public sentiment, in which\r\nspeculation and gambling and jobbing and corruption will lose their\r\npower, and in which free government will vindicate its rights to the\r\nconfidence of mankind. If I did not believe this, I should think that a\r\nvery great part of my own life was lost, and all the traditions I have\r\nderived from my ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"The better day, to which--in that dark hour--I looked with hope and\r\nfaith, is now dawning upon our city, State, and country.\r\n\r\n                         \"Very truly, yours, &c.,\r\n                                                  \"S.

TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _March 18, 1872_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I have this morning received your letter of Saturday,\r\nand hasten to answer it, as I am to leave this city for Pittsburg this\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Your statement of the facts connected with the arrangement to pay you\r\na counsel fee of $10,000 by the Erie Railroad Company, for services in\r\nthe Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad, is strictly correct, all of which\r\ncame within my personal knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"At the time, since, and now, I held and hold the position of president\r\nof the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company, which company\r\nthen held, and still holds, a very important contract relation with the\r\nCleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company. It was this fact that caused\r\nme to take an interest in the complication in which the Cleveland and\r\nPittsburg Company was involved in 1869, and which had been brought\r\nabout through the action of a director of the Erie Company, that\r\ncompany at the time (as was believed) holding a majority of the stock\r\nof the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company.\r\n\r\n\"To free the latter company from the litigation in which it was\r\ninvolved, I came to this city and had an interview with the then\r\npresident of the Erie Railway Company, who condemned the whole\r\nproceedings of what was called the 'Erie board' at Cleveland. He agreed\r\nthat a portion of the members should resign, and that you and myself\r\nshould come into the direction and the executive committee. I returned\r\nhome, and, after a conference with J. N. McCullough, Esq., then and now\r\npresident of the C. & P. R. Co., a plan of reorganization was agreed\r\nupon, as set forth in your letter. To this date nothing had been said\r\nto you on the subject. On coming to this city, and developing the plan\r\nto you, you declined to go into the board or have anything to do with\r\nthe business, for the reasons stated in your letter. I said to Mr.\r\nGould and Mr. McCullough--the latter more than once--not to urge the\r\nquestion on you any further, as you might take such a decided stand\r\nthat we would not be able to overcome your objections, but that the\r\nplan should be proceeded with, and we should elect you into the board\r\nand take the chances of getting you to serve. This was done, and you\r\nwere elected without consulting you farther or obtaining your consent.\r\nAfter the reorganization of the board the arrangement that you should\r\nbe the umpire in the executive committee, and have charge of all legal\r\nproceedings and be general counsel to the committee and board was\r\narranged as you state, and without first consulting you. I took it upon\r\nmyself to make such arrangements as would bring harmony into the board,\r\nbelieving you would acquiesce in such arrangement as I might make.\r\nBefore you came into the Cleveland and Pittsburg board a resolution\r\nwas placed on the minutes electing you the general counsel, and fixing\r\nthe compensation. It was also proposed that owing to the interest which\r\nthe Erie Railway Company had (controlling a majority of the stock),\r\nand the interest which the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway\r\nCompany had by its contract with the Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad\r\nCompany, that each of those companies should retain you in their\r\nrespective behalfs touching those interests. All this was done without\r\nany indication from you as to what you would do.\r\n\r\n\"I afterwards learned from you that the Erie Railway Company had paid\r\nyou the ten thousand dollars, as agreed, without waiting for you to\r\nrender a bill. The five thousand dollars agreed to be paid by the\r\nPittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway Company has never been paid\r\nor even spoken of since.\r\n\r\n\"The compensation above referred to was for those specific services\r\nand for no other, so far as I ever heard or believe. Those services\r\ncontinued to the close of the year, when you retired from the board. I\r\nremained in the board during that year and ever since.\r\n\r\n\"I will add that the arrangement made in 1869 was of large pecuniary\r\nbenefit to the stockholders, and gave to the affairs, as well as the\r\nstock of the company, a stability they had never before had.\r\n\r\n\"I believe what I have written covers the whole case--at least I\r\nhave so intended--and if, after I return from Pittsburg, it shall be\r\nfound that any facts have been omitted, I shall be glad to supply the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly yours,\r\n                      \"G.

I do not want a horse that needs care\r\nall the while to keep him well.\r\n\r\n\"2. I want each horse to be of natural good temper and disposition.\r\n\r\n\"3. I want each to be free from all tricks, and perfectly sound.\r\n\r\n\"4. I want the two horses to be well matched in size, appearance,\r\ntemper, and action.

This year it looked as\r\nthough something might be accomplished, and I signified my willingness\r\nto go to the State convention, and allowed myself to become interested\r\nin the political situation. The nominations at Cincinnati gave me a\r\nrecoil, but still I hoped something might be done. I confess I am\r\nalmost discouraged again. If Greeley is to be nominated at Baltimore\r\nit will so divide the Democrats as to cause defeat just when success is\r\nwithin our reach by a judicious nomination, either wholly Democratic or\r\npartly and principally liberal Republican. We could unite on Trumbull,\r\nAdams, Davis, Cox, etc. I could even (though reluctantly) support Chas.\r\nSumner, but I don't see how I can preserve my self-respect if I vote\r\nfor Greeley.\r\n\r\n\"Is his nomination at Baltimore a necessity? If a straight Democratic\r\nticket is not advisable, why could not some arrangement be made to\r\nnominate, say, Trumbull, and some reform Democrat, yourself, for\r\ninstance, for V. P.? I am not so much a 'Bourbon' but that I could vote\r\nfor such a ticket with great pleasure. I care nothing for the issues\r\nwhich are past, but Mr. Greeley is directly against us upon the great\r\nliving issues, those issues which began with our govt. and must last as\r\nlong as it lasts.

Everything which at the\r\nbeginning of the late legislative session you set before yourselves\r\nas practicable, everything which you were afterwards encouraged\r\nto undertake, has been accomplished. You asked for an inquiry\r\ninto abuses in the administration of justice. You have had an\r\ninvestigation--patient and thorough--during seven weeks, in session\r\ncontinued from ten in the morning until late at night--carried on\r\nin the presence of the accused and their counsel. It is true the\r\ninquiry could only touch a small part of the evil--the specific cases\r\npresented by you. But every judge against whom you made charges has\r\nbeen put on his trial, except one, who fled from the ordeal. I repeat\r\nto you to-night what I said at the meeting at which this association\r\nwas organized. It was on Feb. 1, 1879--when the shameful perversion\r\nof judicial process and judicial power that characterized 1869 were\r\nfresh in the public mind, and the corrupt oligarchy, whose tools these\r\njudges were, seemed to sit enthroned over the prostrate people of our\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\"If it will do its duty to itself, the bar can do everything else. It\r\ncan have reformed constitutions, it can have a reformed judiciary. It\r\ncan have the administration of justice made pure and honorable. One\r\nword as to the pending impeachment of Judge Barnard. I do not share\r\nthe fears which have been expressed in the public journals as to the\r\nresults. First, I know that in the investigation, which extended\r\nto all the witnesses the accused desired to produce, and with full\r\ncross-examinations, there was developed more impeachable matter--ten\r\ntimes over--than can be found in the eight principal cases of judicial\r\nimpeachment, four resulting in convictions which have occurred in this\r\ncountry. Secondly, I believe that the leading members of the committee\r\nof managers will faithfully prosecute the trial. Thirdly, I have the\r\nmost absolute confidence in the abilities, professional skill, and\r\nearnest patriotism of the counsel who will represent the people, and on\r\nwhom the real burden of the trial will fall. I respect the sentiments\r\nof my brethren of the bar which demanded that I should continue still\r\nfarther my connection with the movement to purify the judiciary. I\r\nmean, of course, as one of the managers of the impeachment, for you all\r\nknow that I would not have acted as counsel. While I did not feel at\r\nliberty by my own act to withhold any service which you thought I could\r\nrender to the great reform, my opinion differs somewhat from the public\r\nimpression. The great work of investigation, of collecting evidence,\r\nand of securing sufficient concurrence and co-operation to put the\r\naccused on trial--which has been an immense and difficult labor--is\r\ndone. The gentlemen whom I met in conference, after everything had been\r\ncompleted except to decide on the form of procedure--when I consented\r\nto impeachment instead of removal by concurrent resolution--and I see\r\nseveral of those gentlemen present, will remember that I then stated\r\nmy difficulty in engaging in a prolonged trial during the summer. When\r\nthe choice of the managers came to be made I did not feel called on\r\nto enter into a canvass or to form combinations. In everything else\r\nI had felt it my duty to exercise all foresight and every care, and\r\nto exert every power I possess to organize such elements as could be\r\nfound for good ends. In this I felt entitled to leave every human being\r\nto his spontaneous action. If I should receive an honorable discharge\r\nI had a right to accept it. I cannot be accused of selfishness if I\r\ndid so with delight. One care only remained for me. That was to look\r\nafter the choice of counsel. I communicated what seemed to be, in the\r\nactual circumstances, the best suggestions to Mr. Alvord, and met his\r\nprompt and cordial concurrence. Of Mr. Van Cott--the senior member\r\nof the committee which represented you in the investigation--I need\r\nnot speak. The eminent jurist with whom he will be associated--Judge\r\nComstock--will bring to his duty great abilities, ample stores of\r\nlearning, and an honorable pride in restoring the renown of the bench\r\nand the bar of this State. I remember with what solemn earnestness he\r\nsaid to me several years ago that we could never reform the judiciary\r\nof this district until we had first crushed the corrupt power which\r\nstood behind it. I do not see that justice will be more likely to fail\r\nthat the trial is to be conducted in the light of open day, with the\r\neager scrutiny of the bar of the State and country, and under the eyes\r\nof a watchful, apprehensive, and somewhat distrusting people. While\r\nwhat has been done towards purifying the judiciary is just cause of\r\ncongratulation, you will appreciate the difficulties through which\r\nit has been obtained if you reflect that everything else in the way\r\nof reform has failed. It is known to you that when I consented to\r\ngo to the Assembly it was with a view to the judicial reform and to\r\ncertain other measures more particularly interesting to the people\r\nof this city, and that in that work I expected the co-operation in\r\nthe Legislature of Mr. O'Conor and Mr. Evarts. This arrangement was\r\ndefeated by subsequent events. I thought that it was necessary to\r\nconcentrate myself upon a very few measures in order to accomplish\r\nanything. The general demoralization growing out of the Civil War and\r\npaper money had produced widespread effects. The corrupt power which\r\nhad just been overthrown in this city had its origin in a partnership\r\nof plunder between men nominally of different politics, but, in fact,\r\nof no politics at all, and had established extensive affiliations\r\nthroughout the State in both parties and in both branches of the\r\ndominant party which now possessed three-quarters of the Legislature.\r\nIt had been necessary to the system that the capitol should be\r\nsurrounded by an atmosphere of corruption. The ambition of some had\r\nbeen tempted; the interests of more had been addressed by making\r\nlegislative business profitable, and the golden showers had sprinkled\r\nbenefits in every direction. Some, even, who would not take an actual\r\npart in the saturnalia were content to be silent spectators or\r\nconsenting witnesses. I never for a moment supposed that the knife and\r\nthe cautery would be agreeable remedies, or that the silent partners\r\nof prosperous criminals would fall in love with those whose duty it\r\nis to detect and punish. I knew, therefore, that obstructions, under\r\nevery pretext, were to be met at every step and to be overcome. Let us\r\nthankfully accept what has been accomplished; and let us here to-night\r\nrenew our faith that if the bar of this city and State will be united\r\nand persistent, every judicial reform in respect to men and in respect\r\nto systems will be at last successfully achieved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO EUGENE CASSERLY\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _July 3rd, 1872_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--I _did_ intend sooner to acknowledge your letter and\r\nmake answer generally to it, tho I have foreseen that it is a case in\r\nwhich, as Gov. Seymour says, 'letters answer themselves,' and I should\r\nonly pay my respects to you.\r\n\r\n\"The Cincinnati movement has been so early and long encouraged by\r\nyou and by me and by many who thought with us, that it grew to have\r\nan impetus and volume which were important and not easily turned\r\naside from the channel it made for itself. Our people, in being\r\neducated to favor it, had become accustomed to count on it, and at\r\nlast became dependent upon it. I never saw how its acts were capable\r\nof readjustment, or how the question now before us would be other\r\nthan the simple issue between Grant and Greeley. On this I concur\r\nwith the instinctive sense of our people that a change is necessary\r\nin the Federal administration. It is rarely, if ever, possible for a\r\nparty in office to reform itself by the internal force of its best\r\nelements. We must have a better state of things in national, State,\r\nand municipal government, and a higher standard in the public mind by\r\nwhich official men will be tried and to which they will refer in their\r\nsilent meditations and in their actions, if we would preserve anything\r\nof value in our political system. But I am getting beyond the limits of\r\nmy time.\r\n\r\n\"In haste.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly your friend,\r\n                       \"S. J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA. G.

If\r\nyou have any influence with him I pray you to exert it to prevent his\r\ndoing so. It is as hard for me to support Greeley as it is for any\r\nman I know. But, being compelled to choose between him and Grant,\r\nI am satisfied that we ought to support him--not for his own sake,\r\nbut because it is the only mode left to us to break the radical\r\norganization. I have a very high opinion of O'Conor, and would be much\r\ndistressed should he give the use of his great name to the Louisville\r\nmovement, which is wholly in the interest of Grant.\r\n\r\n\"Please write to me at _Columbus, Ohio_, where I will be in a few days.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n                   \"A.

Please to send it to me by mail. I am very much obliged to\r\nyou for the accommodation. How does the canvass go? I am not able to\r\nwork myself into any heat about it. I grow old very fast. Then, too, it\r\nis hard to go out to speak for Greeley. His abuse has been so gross. As\r\nfacts stand, I think it was wise to put him up, and I can see my way\r\nclear to vote for him, as he can be made of use in driving negroes out\r\nof office; but it is hard to speak for him. But for you and Kernan I\r\nwould not move this fall. As it is, I will do what I can.\r\n\r\n  \"Truly yours, &c.,\r\n                     \"HORATIO SEYMOUR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY KERNAN WAS NOMINATED FOR GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n(INTERVIEW WITH \"HERALD\" REPORTER, NOV. 3, 1872)\r\n\r\n\"REPORTER.--Understanding that you had some agency in the nomination\r\nof Francis Kernan as the Democratic and Liberal Republican candidate\r\nfor Governor, I have called to make some inquiries about it. Will Mr.\r\nKernan be elected?\r\n\r\n\"MR. TILDEN (smiling).--You remember the old adage which says, 'You\r\ncan't tell who is Governor till after the election'? But at the risk of\r\nviolating that, I will give you an opinion. I feel very certain that\r\nFrancis Kernan will be the next Governor of the State of New York.\r\n\r\n\"REPORTER.--Are you willing to state the motives for nominating Mr.\r\nKernan?\r\n\r\n\"MR. TILDEN.--I am perfectly willing to state _my_ motives, so far as\r\nI had any agency in the nomination. Mr. Kernan will be 'the right man\r\nin the right place.' It is scarcely possible to find a man to whom the\r\npublic interests can be so safely trusted. He is in the meridian of\r\nlife and the maturity of his powers. He has acknowledged abilities.\r\nHe has led a distinguished career as a lawyer. He possesses large\r\nknowledge and experience of public affairs, while he scarcely ever\r\nheld office. He has inspired universal confidence in his most absolute\r\nintegrity, and enjoys the esteem and affection of the people of the\r\ncentral portions of the State, and of all who know him everywhere else.\r\nEvery circumstance about him conspires to assure his single-minded\r\nfidelity to the duties of his great trust.\r\n\r\n\"In the _first_ place, he has a high standard of public conduct. He\r\nis imbued with the traditions of the best days of the Democracy. Like\r\nJefferson, he would not attempt to increase his fortune, even by\r\nlegitimate methods, while in public life. Like Silas Wright and Flagg\r\nand Marcy, he would not only be pure himself, but would disdain to use\r\nimpure influence--impure methods or impure men for party objects. His\r\nideals are all lofty.\r\n\r\n\"In the _second_ place, he is not over-ambitious. He does not aim at\r\na permanent public life, but to serve out his term and return to the\r\ncongenial pursuit of his profession.\r\n\r\n\"In the _third_ place, he is totally free from all ambiguous\r\nassociations. He stands on no 'ring.' He owes nobody anything for\r\npolitical favors.\r\n\r\n\"Here are reasons enough, and good ones, but not all.\r\n\r\n\"REPORTER.--What were the others? The Republican newspapers say that\r\none was that Mr. Kernan is a Catholic, and that you advised his\r\nnomination on that account.\r\n\r\n\"MR. TILDEN.--There is not the slightest truth, or resemblance to\r\ntruth, in that story. But I will speak of that subject presently. The\r\nother reason is the connection Mr. Kernan had with the reform movement\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_City Frauds._\r\n\r\n\"The discovery of frauds by certain city officials happened just as I\r\nwas about leaving the city to spend a week in the country. On the eve\r\nof my departure I had an opportunity of cross-examining a gentleman who\r\nhad the confidence of the financial men and taxpayers of this city, and\r\nwho called on me with a letter from a distinguished philanthropist.\r\nI became satisfied that the revelations were substantially true. My\r\nweek's reflections in the country resulted in a determination to\r\nattempt to carry out that system of measures in which I have been ever\r\nsince engaged; but some co-operation was indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Kernan and O'Conor._\r\n\r\n\"The first man I sought was Francis Kernan. After much telegraphing\r\nI found him attending court in Albany. I went there to meet him. It\r\nwas on the fourth day of August, 1871. He was about to leave for\r\nthe seashore to attend a sick relative. I gave him the documents. I\r\nsubmitted to him my views as to what ought to be done, and arranged\r\nfor a further conference on his return. On that occasion he gave\r\nme assurances of his full and cordial co-operation, which I ever\r\nafterwards received. He was to me the one necessary man for a contest\r\nin the State convention. His courage, his independence, his tact and\r\neloquence in debate, his popularity and weight of character were all\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n\"I next sought Charles O'Conor. I desired his co-operation in a\r\ndifferent department. His great renown as a lawyer, his unmatched\r\nresources in a professional controversy, his lofty independence, and\r\nhis high sense of public duty made him invaluable in many things which\r\nwere necessary in order to achieve an overthrow of the corrupt dynasty\r\nwhich then ruled our great metropolis and to purify the administration\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\n\"Now it so happened that both of these gentlemen are Americans, born\r\nwithin this State; that they are both sons of exiles, for the sake of\r\nliberty, from Ireland; that they are both of the Catholic religion.\r\nMr. Kernan's creed had nothing more to do with my desire for his\r\nnomination for Governor than it had with my seeking his co-operation,\r\nor Mr. O'Conor's co-operation in the reform measures. The only mode\r\nin which the question of creed came to be discussed with reference\r\nto Mr. Kernan's nomination was afterwards, when, notwithstanding his\r\neminent fitness was conceded, it was said that the Republicans would\r\nattack him on account of his religious opinions. Every rogue in the\r\nState became greatly troubled on the subject. Every member of a corrupt\r\nring, by interest, was opposed to him and thought that his nomination\r\nwould eliminate the Protestant vote. I think they could have forgiven\r\nhis religion if they could only have ceased to fear his honesty. For\r\none, I was not disposed to concede much to such an objection. I never\r\nsaid anything about Mr. Kernan's religion except to defend him. I\r\nshould have been as much in favor of his nomination if he had been of a\r\ndifferent creed. Mr. Kernan is totally free from bigotry. His liberal\r\nviews on every subject of sectarian controversy are on record in his\r\nspeeches and in his conduct. In exercising the powers of an official\r\ntrust his just and equitable character would be an impassible barrier\r\nagainst partiality towards any class to which he should himself belong.\r\nAre you ready to adopt the principle that no man, however superior in\r\nmerits and qualifications, who is a Catholic, shall be eligible to high\r\npublic office in this great commonwealth of freemen and equals? Such a\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Proscription_\r\n\r\nis not only unjust, but it is _unwise_ and _self-destructive_, with\r\nreference to the interests you wish to protect. If your apprehensions\r\nwere anything but imaginary, you direct them in the wrong quarter.\r\nAmbitious politicians seek to win those classes with whom they have\r\nno natural relations. It was not Southern men, like Washington and\r\nJefferson and Jackson, who conceded most to slavery; it was Northern\r\nmen, like Pierce and Buchanan. A Protestant American demagogue--and\r\nparticularly if he had once been a Know-nothing--would do things to\r\ncatch votes or win popularity among a class which a Kernan, an O'Conor,\r\nor a John Kelly would reject with disdain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_City Reformers._\r\n\r\n\"New York is a cosmopolitan city. According to the census of 1865,\r\nrather more than three-fifths of the voters were naturalized. In the\r\nother two-fifths are included the sons of naturalized citizens. How\r\nreform in municipal administration or good government in the city is to\r\nbe worked out by a moral proscription of the foreign voters or of the\r\nreligious belief of the most numerous class of them, it is not easy to\r\nsee. Every such effort is calculated to band them together in a compact\r\nmass. Large numbers of them joined in the reform movement of 1871. If\r\namong their classes, or among Americans descended from them, spring\r\nup citizens foremost in all the community for talents and virtues and\r\ndevotion to our American ideas of government and society, I would not\r\nchallenge the honorable pride they awaken in those of common origin. I\r\nshare that pride in such men as Kernan and O'Conor. I would not weaken\r\nany power of leadership which the natural sentiments of humanity may\r\ngive them in these numerous classes. I would rather see it stronger\r\nthan it is in men like these, who would never seek to create any class\r\ninfluence, and would never abuse any influence, but rather exercise\r\nevery power as a trust for the public good. I had occasion, after the\r\nelection last year, in frequent addresses on municipal reform, to\r\nlament the apathy of many of our citizens whose reproach it is that\r\nwhile by pecuniary independence and leisure and all the legitimate\r\nelements of a just and honorable public influence they selfishly\r\nabdicate their power of leadership in the affairs of our great\r\nmetropolis. Wherever a man appears in the commonwealth who is without\r\nvenality or the inferior forms of ambition, but from an elevated sense\r\nof his duty as a citizen of the commonwealth, he ought to be encouraged\r\nand his natural elements of influence respected and cherished.\r\n\r\n\"It is too late in the day to revive the spirit of the native American\r\nor Know-nothing parties. The only purely American stock which remains\r\non this continent is the whole population of the Southern States, who\r\nare now under the carpet-bag governments, upheld by the banded masses\r\nof rogues and the influence of the Federal governments and affiliated\r\nwith the Republican party. In the North we are one-third emigrants of\r\nthe last twenty-five years or their children. The great migration of\r\nthe last quarter of a century is the most remarkable in the world's\r\nhistory. It has exercised a controlling power over every important\r\nevent of our national progress. In that period about seven millions of\r\npeople have come to our Northern States. I had occasion some years ago\r\nto analyze the character of that immigration. I found that it contained\r\njust about twice as many male persons between the ages of 15 and 40\r\nas our resident population in 1860. In other words, it contained the\r\npopulation of the virile age equal to that of fourteen millions of our\r\naverage people. It is that influx which has created our great cities,\r\nwhich has built our railroads and furnished them business, and which\r\nhas produced the immense growth of our Northern States in population,\r\nwealth, and prosperity. It is that influx which overturned the equality\r\nof influence between the North and South in the Federal government,\r\nand stimulated both sides to the measure that led to the Civil War. It\r\nis that influx which would have given the North predominance if the\r\nwar had not happened, and which gave it the victory in the conflict\r\nof arms, abolished slavery, and will at last fill the South with\r\ncommunities like our own.\r\n\r\n\"This is the state of things. Who could alter it if he would? Who dare\r\nsay that, on the whole, he would alter it if he could?\r\n\r\n\"We must, then, avoid all those civil and social revolutions, work\r\nout as best we may the problem of self-government formed on equal\r\nand universal suffrage. We can only do so on the large, liberal\r\nstatesmanship on which we began, and never by going back toward the\r\ndark night of proscription and bigotry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN TO MRS. CASSIDY\r\n\r\n  \"NEW YORK, _Feb'y 22, 1873_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MRS. CASSIDY,--I regret that any delay should take place in\r\nsending you a statement of the results of the investment made by me\r\nfor your benefit. But the computations were somewhat long, and needed\r\neither help or instructions from me to enable Mr. Smith to complete\r\nthem, which, until now, I was not able to give.\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped before this time to see you and be able to say that, if\r\nthere is anything in your affairs in which I can offer you suggestion\r\nor counsel for the benefit of yourself and your little ones, I shall be\r\nglad to be of service to you.\r\n\r\n\"About the time--indeed, a little before I recd. the $10,000\r\nremittance--when Mr. Cassidy had told me it would be sent I invested\r\nsome $15,000 for you. I sold enough the other day to pay the balance\r\ndue me for allowances.\r\n\r\n\"The investment has gained some $1700, besides interest compounded and\r\nquarterly. The stock would have sold for 5 per cent. more last year,\r\nwhich would have been $750 additional.\r\n\r\n\"But investments generally show about that difference; and if you\r\ncontinue to want such an investment for income, it can now be made\r\nadvantageously.\r\n\r\n\"The Cleveland and Pittsburg stock is about 3-1/2 per cent. lower, and\r\nyields the same income.\r\n\r\n\"Well-selected gold-interest 7-p.-c. bonds, if bought at 85 or a little\r\nunder, will give a larger income. They should be selected with caution.\r\nNow, three courses are open:\r\n\r\n\"1. If you need the _money_ the stock can at once be sold.\r\n\r\n\"2. The stock can be transferred to your name if you do not wish to\r\nchange the investment. In that event, it had better be put in your\r\nname; for the motive to keep the account open has ceased.\r\n\r\n\"The stock is perfectly safe as can be--gives quarterly dividends,\r\nand is free from all income tax, and I think from all personal\r\ntaxes in this State. The dividends have the security of the great\r\nearnings--$1,750,000 now above the cent, and the guaranty of the Penn.\r\nR. R. Co., with its $65,000,000 of capital, paying ten per cent., and\r\nworth 120.\r\n\r\n\"But, no doubt, some bond could be found that might pay a little more.\r\nIf Mr. Cassidy had lived I intended to change to something which would\r\ngive more income, though I think I was rather more cautious in doing it\r\nthan he inclined to be. For, after all--especially with a lady--certain\r\nsecurity is the first consideration. We are doubtless now, as we have\r\nbeen for several years past, on a gradually receding scale of values,\r\nin which the attempt at large profits involves more risk than it did at\r\nan earlier period.\r\n\r\n\"I write hastily, but thus fully that you may know the whole situation.\r\nConsult with your advisers, and let me know your wishes.\r\n\r\n\"I remain, Dear Mrs. Cassidy,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly your friend,\r\n                          \"S.

There are gold-interest-bearing bonds at about 90--7 p.\r\nc.; but I wanted something cheaper.

Unhappily, there is nothing in this statement upon which we can\r\nboast to-day of any considerable improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. TILDEN RESIGNS THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE\r\nCOMMITTEE[63]\r\n\r\n  \"GENEVA, IN SWITZERLAND, _Aug. 1873_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--As I shall not be able to return home in season to take\r\npart in the political canvass of this fall, I desire through you to\r\nrequest the delegate to the State convention who will be chosen from my\r\ndistrict to say for me that I decline a re-election as member-at-large\r\nof the State committee and as its chairman.\r\n\r\n\"What the country now needs in order to save it is a revival of the\r\nJeffersonian democracy, with the principles of government and rules\r\nof administration, and with the high standard of official morality\r\nwhich were established by the political revolution of 1800. At that\r\ntime the infant institutions of the republic were imperilled by the\r\nsame evil tendencies which have to-day attained a larger development.\r\nThe demoralizations of war--a spirit of gambling adventure, engendered\r\nby false systems of public finance; a grasping centralism, absorbing\r\nall functions from the local authorities, and assuming to control\r\nthe industries of individuals by largesses to favored classes from\r\nthe public treasury of moneys wrung from the body of the people by\r\ntaxation--were then, as now, characteristics of the period. The party\r\nwhich swayed the government, though embracing many elevated characters,\r\nwas dominated, as an organization, by the ideas of its master-spirit,\r\nAlexander Hamilton. Himself personally pure, he nevertheless believed\r\nthat our American people must be governed, if not by force, at least\r\nby appeals to the selfish interests of classes, in all the forms of\r\ncorrupt influence. I recently met here--in the birthplace of Albert\r\nGallatin--a son of that great man, and himself a distinguished\r\nAmerican. Speaking in the light of the unsullied traditions of that\r\nday, as well as of its public history, he said that the jobbery and\r\ncorruption and laxity of official morals were as great, proportionally,\r\nthen as now. If this be a true judgment, the reaction which was\r\neffected and which gave us half a century of comparatively pure\r\nadministration is an encouragement that official morals and public life\r\nmay be again lifted from degradation. As the means of the reaction of\r\n1800, Thomas Jefferson founded and organized the Democratic party. He\r\nset up anew the broken foundations of governmental power. He stayed\r\nthe advancing centralism. He restored the rights of the States and the\r\nlocalities. He repressed the meddling of government in the concerns of\r\nprivate business, remitting the management of the industries of the\r\ncountry to the domain of the individual judgment and conscience. He\r\nnot only brought the administration into conformity with principles\r\nwhich lessen the occasions and the motives for corruption, but he\r\nenforced, by precept and by example, purity and disinterestedness in\r\nofficial life. He refused to appoint relatives to office. He declined\r\nall presents. He refrained, while in the public service, from all\r\nenterprises to increase his private fortune.\r\n\r\nThe immense ascendency over the public opinion of the country acquired\r\nby Mr. Jefferson--the complete triumph of the party he formed and led,\r\nthe acceptance at length by the whole people of him as the highest\r\npolitical authority--shaped the course of government in the United\r\nStates for half a century. That period will stand in all history as the\r\ngolden age of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe reformatory work of Mr. Jefferson in 1800 must now be repeated.\r\nOrganizations and names are important only as they are available for\r\nthe result. Every patriotic citizen, sincerely desirous of reform,\r\nshould discard all prejudices and accept the benefaction from any\r\nsource which is capable of providing it.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite clear that the Republican party now swaying the\r\nadministration, although it embraces large numbers of honorable and\r\npatriotic citizens, is, as a whole, incapable of this specific mission.\r\nIn the sixteen years during which it will have been in possession of\r\nthe government at the expiration of the present Presidential term,\r\nall the evils which call so loudly for redress have had their origin,\r\ntheir persistent and daily growth. Nearly all its thinkers, speakers\r\nand writers, its active intellect and its power of leadership, are\r\nimbued with strong-government theories of so extravagant a character\r\nthat even Hamilton would have disowned and doubtless would have\r\ncondemned them. The classes who desire pecuniary profit from existing\r\ngovernmental abuses have become numerous and powerful beyond any\r\nexample in our country. The myriads of officeholders, with enhanced\r\nsalaries, and often with illicit gains; the contractors and jobbers;\r\nthe beneficiaries of Congressional grants of the public property or of\r\nspecial franchises; the favored interests whose business is rendered\r\nlucrative by legislative bounties or legislative monopolies; the\r\ncorporations whose hopes and fears are appealed to by the measures\r\nof the government; the rapacious hordes of carpet-baggers who have\r\nplundered the impoverished people of the South at least ten times\r\nas much as Tweed's Ring did the rich metropolis, and whose fungus\r\ngrowth is intertwined with the roots of the Republican party; all\r\nthese classes are not only interested in perpetuating existing evils\r\nand existing wrongs, but they are the main agencies and instruments\r\nby which that work is done. They furnish organization, they supply\r\nnumerous partisans who devote themselves to electioneering while the\r\nhonest citizens are compelled to earn their daily bread by the sweat\r\nof their brow; they contribute and aggregate vast sums of money to be\r\nexpended in conducting party canvasses, in influencing the elections\r\nand in corrupting the voters; sums which no number of disinterested\r\ncitizens could furnish if equally unscrupulous in the methods of\r\npolitical influence. For the first time in our national history such\r\nclasses have become powerful enough to aspire to be in America the\r\nruling classes, as they have been and are in the corrupt societies\r\nof the Old World. They threaten to reproduce here a state of things\r\noften found elsewhere, in which the governmental machine, with its\r\nallies and dependents, is capable of setting itself up against and\r\nover the whole mass of unorganized citizens who follow the avocations\r\nof private life. These classes completely possess the organization\r\nof the Republican party. They have absorbed the Republican party.\r\nThey are, for all practical purposes, the Republican party. They make\r\nits nominations; they shape its measures, they preserve its policy.\r\nIndividual dissenters who preserve the original traditions of American\r\nfree government there are, but their voices are not heard; they are\r\ngenerally paralyzed; they are always powerless. Hitherto no Democratic\r\nminority has been formed capable of exercising any practical power. No\r\ninternal remedy can come for a disease which has incorporated itself\r\nwith everything vital in the political body. It is too late to cut out\r\nthe cancer without killing the patient.\r\n\r\n\"In the nature of the case, the remedy can come only from an opposition\r\nwhich shall grow strong enough to turn out the present existing\r\nadministration and take its place. In such an opposition the Democratic\r\nmasses must contribute a large element. They embrace three and a half\r\nor four millions of votes, and are of themselves within five per cent.\r\nof a majority. They contain nearly all the thinkers, speakers and\r\nwriters, all the trained statesmen who adhere to the traditions of\r\nJefferson; and while individual members have been not unstained with\r\nthe errors of the times, the body, as a whole, is sound; and a majority\r\nis sure to declare for the ancient faith of Jefferson and Franklin and\r\nGeorge Clinton and Samuel and John Hancock.\r\n\r\n\"In the part I have borne in the administration of the Democratic party\r\nof the State of New York--now closed--I have aimed at three things:\r\n\r\n\"1. To lead on public opinion in favor of the original ideas of the\r\nJeffersonian democracy and in support of such current measures as\r\nsecured valuable reforms.\r\n\r\n\"2. To terminate a degrading strife in which they enlisted themselves,\r\nin comparing the leprous spots on their respective sides, and\r\npractically declared that the word only was wanting to incite an\r\nhonorable emulation in which they should seek and apply effectual\r\nremedies and the public mind stimulated to reform.\r\n\r\n\"3. To prepare the Democratic masses to act their part in a general\r\nmovement for reform in all the governmental institutions of the\r\ncountry.

J. TILDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYOR HAVEMEYER'S MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE DEATH OF AZARIAH C. FLAGG\r\n\r\n  \"_November, 1873._\r\n\r\n\"It is with profound sorrow that I communicate to you officially the\r\nintelligence that Azariah C. Flagg died at his residence in this city\r\non the evening of the 24th. At the close of the next month it will\r\nbe fifteen years since the public career of this eminent citizen was\r\nterminated. In that interval, totally bereft of eyesight, but with an\r\nintellect clear and strong, and a spirit courageous and serene, he has\r\nlived in complete retirement, fulfilling some private trusts, and ever\r\nthoughtful of all public interests. At last, when a few days would have\r\ncompleted an age of eighty-three years, he has passed from among us.\r\n\r\n\"There are peculiarities in the public career and public character of\r\nMr. Flagg which make it specially fit that the people of this State,\r\nand the people of this city, should pause a moment in their busy life\r\nto render a conspicuous homage to him as his mortal remains pass to the\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\n\"He was born in Orwell, in the State of Vermont, on the 28th of\r\nNovember, 1790. In early youth he migrated to Plattsburg, in this\r\nState. He had an honorable share in the defence of that place against\r\nthe British invasion in the war of 1812-15. He sought a frugal\r\nlivelihood as editor and printer of the Plattsburg _Republican_, a\r\nDemocratic newspaper. In November, 1822, he was elected by the friends\r\nof Clinton to the Assembly. He served in that body with distinction\r\nduring the sessions of 1823 and 1824. In February, 1826, he was elected\r\nSecretary of State by the Legislature, and held that office until\r\nJan., 1833, when he was elected Comptroller. He held the latter office\r\nuntil 1839. He was restored to it in 1842, and continued to hold it\r\nuntil the close of 1847. His official service consisted of two years in\r\nthe Assembly and 19 years in the Canal Board, as Comptroller, as Secy.\r\nof State; and his unofficial service was even more valuable during the\r\nthree years from 1839 to 1842. His career in State administration may\r\nbe counted as 25 years.\r\n\r\n\"In this career of a quarter of a century in the administration of\r\nthe State, Mr. Flagg's merit and renown will be found not in the\r\ncatalogue of the great offices he held, but in the wise measures and\r\nhonest policy he originated or maintained--in the ability, vigor, and\r\ncourage with which he pursued the right and confronted the wrong, and\r\nin the great fact that he invariably wielded official power and party\r\nleadership for the cause of good government, for purity in legislation\r\nand in administration; that he used these great influences, not for the\r\npurposes of individual ambition or personal gain, but exclusively and\r\nundeviatingly for the public good; that he contributed very largely\r\nto keep up and to elevate the standard and the tone of official and\r\npolitical morals in both parties and in the whole public during this\r\nlong period in the greatest State of the Union. Mr. Flagg was united\r\nwith Martin Van Buren, whose organizing genius and masterly abilities\r\ncreated the association; with Silas Wright and William L. Marcy, also\r\nstatesmen of the first class. They were all men of probity, frugality,\r\nand personal virtue, and they drew to their side similar characters\r\nin all parts of the State. Mr. Flagg made the State finances his\r\nspecialty; and surpassed all his associates in enterprise and courage,\r\nthough he may not have equalled them in general attainments, and was\r\noften the most effective leader in this State.\r\n\r\n\"In the six years from 1853 to 1859, Mr. Flagg served as Comptroller of\r\nthis city; and although he did not attempt any political leadership,\r\nhis career was distinguished by the fidelity and firmness with which he\r\nresented all invasions of the municipal treasury; and his persistent\r\nand unwearied exertions in this service no doubt hastened the malady\r\nby which, at nearly the allotted age of man, closed forever his vision\r\nupon the light of the heavens.\r\n\r\n\"It may safely be said that the history of the country affords no\r\nequal example of a life devoted for so long a period with so much\r\naffirmative activity, and with so much ability and skill, to the\r\nabstract cause of good government in the civil administration of the\r\ncommunity in which Providence had cast his lot.\r\n\r\n\"At a period when the people everywhere are feeling how much they\r\nneed such virtues and such services, we ought to signalize our\r\nappreciation of so remarkable an example, if only as an incentive to\r\nits imitation.\"[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nS. J. TILDEN TO H. A. TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"N. Y., _Nov. 14, 1873_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR HENRY,--I have but a moment. I am pressed on every side with\r\nurgent demands.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no use in your asking me for any further aid, unless you\r\ncan make up your mind to abandon your pride and imperious will, and\r\ncome to terms which I have so long advised for your own good and which\r\nI ought long ago to have enforced for my own peace and safety.\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely like to repeat my ideas, because I frequently hear, through\r\nindirect channels, of your complaint that I go back 18 years, and so\r\nyou don't wish to talk with me.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I never have recurred to painful topics merely to wound, but only\r\nto try to impress the lessons which you ought to have derived from your\r\nown experience, but which you never would admit to me, and which you\r\nhave never acted on. If it is hopeless to expect that you will correct\r\nerrors--if you are too proud to admit them--what resource have I but to\r\nkeep that which is [left] out of your power? What hope is there that\r\nanything I can do will be of any permanent use to you or your family?\r\nWhat can I do but turn away my thoughts from a man--this affair, which\r\nhas cost me more anxiety, trouble, hazard of my own affairs and of\r\nhealth than everybody and everything in life--who grabs anything of\r\nmine he can lay his hands on without asking me, never consults me\r\nabout restoring it, and thinks it right to do just as he pleases about\r\nincurring new expenditures and operations in preference to paying his\r\ncreditors, whom he does not think it necessary to consult, or, indeed,\r\nto have any rights but to submit to what he, in his supreme good\r\npleasure, chooses to do.\r\n\r\n\"In prudence and in morality you have much to do to regain my good\r\nopinion. The first thing is to see and admit your errors. The next is\r\nto show signs of amending them.\r\n\r\n\"1. An ordinary creditor would have a right to know, frankly and truly,\r\nthe situation of a debtor. Still more so would a man who was aiding as\r\na matter of favor--friendship or affection.\r\n\r\n\"In twenty years I have been able to get nothing from you which was not\r\nwrung out, even when I was making new advances at great sacrifices.\r\nThen as scanty as possible. I never had any information about your\r\nMichigan transactions. I never have been able to get information in\r\nseason to advise about the shaping of your plans.\r\n\r\n\"You have seemed to think that everybody ought to accept your own view\r\nof your affairs--allow you to embark in new undertakings money justly\r\ndue to your creditors without their consent or knowledge--and that it\r\nwas almost a piece of impertinence for them to wish to know anything\r\nabout their own money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nS.

TILDEN IN 1874)\r\n\r\n\"Your correspondent not having the liberty of an interview,\r\nnevertheless had the privilege of a conversation, not at all private,\r\nworthy of public consideration.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency was reminded that he could not be an unobservant\r\nspectator of the circumstance that the leaders of both political\r\nparties are discussing Presidential questions and canvassing the\r\nclaims of opposed candidates in both. He promptly responded that that\r\nconcerned him the least whilst he had serious duties to perform. The\r\nPresidency, he said, is not strictly before the people at all in this\r\ncanvass. They are to elect legislators who should improve the laws,\r\nand executive State officers to administer the same. A constitutional\r\namendment contemplates cutting off extra compensations to contractors,\r\nbut it does not prohibit the Legislature from charging work in the\r\ninterest 'of the contractor,' besides authorizing 'the Canal Board' to\r\ncancel such (contractor's) contract. This shows the vital importance\r\nof electing a sound Legislature and a safe Canal Board. The practice\r\nhas been too much to pass laws in the interest of the sinister, the\r\nevil, and the profligate classes; and the same have been administered\r\naccordingly, until the rights and interests of the honest and\r\nindustrial classes have been greatly ignored and the common prosperity\r\nwell-nigh paralyzed. The State has just now a far deeper interest in\r\nhome government than in the national concerns. We need not overlook the\r\nfrauds and extravagances of the Washington government, but we shall\r\nfind on hand full enough to do if we arrest and redress the abuses\r\nthat pervade our cities, towns, and counties, and particularly the\r\nState, for this year, leaving the selection of members of Congress and\r\nPresidential electors to their proper time another year.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency was further reminded that he could not overlook the\r\nfact that the prominence, not to say popularity, of his administration\r\nhad led to the consideration of his name in connection with the next\r\nPresidency, and that some rivalry consequent upon the agitation of\r\n'home questions' had led to the favoring of candidates beyond the\r\nlimits of our own State.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency promptly (and rather nervously) responded that public\r\nopinion will be very apt to take care of such interests and issues.\r\nHe had seen enough to satisfy him that he who escapes the cares and\r\nresponsibilities of public life is far happier than he who enjoys its\r\nsupposed honors and emoluments. He could most heartily and trustfully\r\nsupport the superior claims (as they are miscalled) of New York's\r\nfavorite son and foremost statesman.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, this was understood to refer to Governor Seymour. So his\r\nExcellency was reminded that it was objected that he had had his\r\nopportunity, and also that our State has had both of the last two\r\nchances for the Presidency.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, that is a superficial, if not sinister, view of the case,'\r\npromptly rejoined my interlocutor. 'The public no longer cares what\r\nState or section candidates come from. They may be taken from one or\r\nthe other, or both from either, and the people will not care, so long\r\nas the men and measures are acceptable. Gov. Seymour was nominated\r\neight years ago against his wishes and his friends', with the tacit if\r\nnot expressed understanding that he and they were making a sacrifice at\r\nthe time to a political exigency. The same, pretty much, may be said\r\nin the case of the lamented Greeley. New York has no local claims (any\r\nmore than the \"mother of Presidents\" of old had); neither has she any\r\nlocal disabilities. But there is no use of discussing these matters,\r\nas he said before. We have more appropriate and pressing work in hand.\r\nWhen that is done it will be time enough to bother our heads about\r\nother political concerns.'\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency was badgered a little on the reports of his alleged ill\r\nhealth, but he was disposed to treat it as 'an invention of the enemy.'\r\nYet he expressed jocosely the hope that his own constitution might soon\r\nexperience a respite from his sedentary confinement, as well as the bad\r\nhabits of public life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJACOB S.

I met Isaac Butts and went to his office with him. Wilkins, who\r\nhas been a delegate to the State convention from this city a number\r\nof times, and Geo. Taylor, the Assemblyman of _last winter_ from this\r\ncity, was in said office. After a little time, Butts spoke of the\r\nconvention to be held at Syracuse, and said that S. J. Tilden was\r\nthe only man that should receive the nomination, 'and would get it.'\r\nWilkins was still stronger in his views for Tilden. Geo. Taylor said\r\nbut little, for he is a Lord man--the Lords are very still; they do\r\nnot want W. F. Allen; they wish to keep that _court bench just as it is\r\nnow_. You know why. Allen and Ganson, of Buffalo, will be the only men\r\nin the way of S. J. Tilden. I now think that Erie, Niagara, and Genesee\r\ncounties will give full delegation for Tilden. Livingston, Monroe, and\r\nOrleans. Ontario will give part delegation for Tilden. A few days more\r\nwill show how the cat will jump with the Canal Ring men. They must show\r\ntheir hand soon.

It was\r\nimpracticable for me to attend, and I could not tell where a telegram\r\nwould reach you. I write now to return thanks for your courtesy in\r\ninviting me to be present. I do not share the fears of many of our\r\nfriends that Governor Dix's personal popularity will carry the radical\r\nticket successfully through the coming canvass; on the contrary,\r\nI believe our prospects good, if we are honest with ourselves and\r\njudicious in selecting candidates.\r\n\r\n\"I am opposed to selecting a candidate for Governor from the judges\r\nof the Court of Appeals. Either Hon. Clarkson N. Potter or Hon. John\r\nGanson would make a fair candidate, but my first and last choice is\r\nyourself. My position in your case is precisely what you know it was at\r\nthe time, in 1872, our mutual and esteemed friend, Hon. Francis Kernan,\r\nwas talked of as a probable nominee. Mr. Kernan's religious convictions\r\nwere the first, if not the only objection suggested by those opposed to\r\nhis nomination; in your case the first if not the only objection urged\r\nis that your courageous and successful attack upon a corrupt ring in\r\nour party will lessen the vote for you, it being always suggested in\r\nthis connection that the old and corrupt ring still control a large\r\nvote, especially in your city. I say away with such abject fears! If\r\nour party friends will not support brave, honest men because a ring\r\nof plunderers and their retainers may be displeased, then let our\r\nopponents succeed, and we will at least escape the responsibility\r\nalways attending political power. This has been and is my position on\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n  \"Respectfully Yours,\r\n                       \"D. MAGONE, JR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nALVA H.

Enclosed find a corrected list of working-men as you\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\"I also assume the liberty of addressing you the following, which\r\nplease consider confidential. The position of things in this county\r\nand the influences which I believe are working against yourself prompt\r\nthese suggestions.\r\n\r\n\"The _regular committees_ of our city and county will send to the State\r\nconvention 12 delegates, all able, prominent, representative, and\r\nlive working-men and Democrats. They are, I think, with good reason,\r\nunanimously in favor of your nomination. There will, however, be a\r\ncontesting delegation from here, made from powers wielded by a county\r\ncommittee which commenced its existence about 4 months since, which\r\nis being controlled by its president, John McEwen, and supported by\r\nthe _Argus_. I think I hazard nothing in stating that in my judgment\r\nthis last delegation, together with the entire power of the _Argus_\r\nand the 'Canal Ring' here, which support them, are inimical to your\r\nnomination and will do all they can to defeat you. The developments\r\nwhich have been watched, and especially these within the last two\r\ndays in connection with the Liberal Republican convention, I think\r\nfully sustain all I say, and even _more_. The whole of these 3 powers\r\nwere used to their utmost strength during the last 2 days to drive\r\nyou from the field and to force the renomination of Mr. Church. This\r\nplan was fought against by our delegation and those acting therewith,\r\nand to their ingenious and proper management in a great degree is the\r\nresult attributable which prevented the naming of Mr. Church by their\r\nconvention. The _Argus_, McEwen, and their supporters, we believe, are\r\ndoing all they can to fill up your path. We are disposed to keep it\r\nclear and to give you our individual support.\r\n\r\n\"You are, of course, aware that _our_ admission to the State convention\r\nis to be opposed as bitterly as it can be by the _same powers_ which\r\nare named above as being opposed _to you_. We are therefore very\r\nanxious to receive your support in procuring our admission as regular\r\ndelegates into said convention. The self-same persons, we believe,\r\nwhich are massed against us are consolidated agst. you. The success of\r\nour delegation will add to your soldiers. Knowing you will have much to\r\nsay in regard to the committee before whom we must appear, I sincerely\r\ntrust you will see that it is so composed that bolting committee\r\ndelegations cannot oust those who represent the regular committees from\r\nthis county, who have aided you in fighting our political battles so\r\nably for the last 40 years. When I can be of further service, please\r\nlet me know. Shall be happy to acknowledge any attention you may\r\nconclude to extend.\r\n\r\n  Your obdt. servant,\r\n                    \"ALVA H.

I have\r\nto go thirty miles to reach it, as it is held in a remote corner of\r\nour county. As I wrote you before, the State has been scoured by your\r\nopponents. The State officers are hostile, and every canal official is\r\nat work to keep your friends out of the convention. In Oneida we have\r\nmore than one hundred miles of canals running into all sections of its\r\nterritory. I shall not be surprised if I encounter a sharp opposition\r\nto-morrow. It is not open opposition alone which is to be contended\r\nwith. Men are put forward who claim to be your friends who are to be\r\nconvinced in due time that it will not be expedient to nominate you,\r\nalthough they hold you in high regard, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\"A high compliment is paid to you by men who have schemes when they\r\nshow that they do not want you in Albany. So far as your fame and honor\r\nare concerned, it will be fortunate for you if they succeed, for the\r\nwhole press, which will be hostile or silent if you are put into the\r\nfield, will be full of your praises if it is held that you are too\r\nhonest to be made a Governor.\r\n\r\n                            \"Truly yours, &c.,\r\n                                               \"HORATIO SEYMOUR.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_Hon.

I see the opposition to you has taken a new phase within\r\na few days. Your opponents are seeking to have you resign in favor\r\nof Judge Church. I do not think you can now do so with propriety.\r\nThe matter of a candidate for Governor has been canvassed for weeks;\r\nit has been understood by us all that Judge Church would not take a\r\nnomination; there were many reasons why, being chief justice, he should\r\nnot vacate the position and leave it to be filled by appointment for a\r\nyear. Your name has been canvassed, and your friends have taken strong\r\nground in favor of your nomination; now those who have been opposed\r\nto you, not your friends, ask you to retire that Judge Church may be\r\nnominated. In my judgment you should not take the responsibility of\r\nthis step; the matter has progressed so far that I think you should\r\nleave the matter to your friends and the convention which is about to\r\nassemble. I see no other way out of the matter but in thus acting.\r\n\r\n\"The delegates in this district were elected to-day. The one from the\r\ncity will vote for you, and the others also, as I believe.\r\n\r\n\"From all I can learn I think the convention will be in favor of your\r\nnomination.

Y., _Sept. 21, 1874_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--We have known each other for many years; have passed\r\nthrough many heated political campaigns together, striving for the\r\nsame political results; therefore I hope you will not deem it amiss\r\nif I write you a short letter. I premise by saying what every one\r\nknows--that without the aid of the personal friends of Tweed the State\r\nticket this fall will be defeated by forty thousand majority. Can his\r\nfriends be made our friends in this campaign? I answer 'yes.' You\r\ninquire, 'How can this be done?'\r\n\r\n\"The object of criminal punishment in theory and practice, as laid\r\ndown by all elementary writers, is to reform the offender, to deter\r\nhim and others from committing like offences, and to protect society.\r\nHas not this object been accomplished in the case of Tweed? Gen. Dix,\r\nif elected, will not pardon him; will you? If his friends have your\r\npromise, when elected, to pardon, will they not put in a half million\r\ninto a fund for your success? Then let them say to their friends in\r\neach county that they desire your election _for a purpose_, and we have\r\nthe whole strength of the Democratic party. That will not, perhaps,\r\nbe enough. Let the temperance men be paid and their organizations\r\nsustained by money, and success is certain. Let one man in each\r\nAssembly district be re-elected who will be in the secret and have the\r\ndesired funds, who will thoroughly work his district--both in getting\r\nout the Democrats and taking care of the temperance people--and you\r\nhave the desired result. You and the reformers can afford this promise.\r\nI am not and never was a Tweed man--I thought his punishment just--yet\r\nI think he has been confined long enough for all purposes, legal,\r\nmoral, or political. The above is a bold proposition; if you think of\r\nit, it will appear a just one. But be that as it may, without some such\r\nmove we cannot carry the State. Excuse me if in writing thus I presume\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours Respectfully,\r\n                         \"P. H. COWEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTILDEN FOR GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n(THE COURSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION PRESS REVIEWED)\r\n\r\n(_From the New York \"Tribune\"_)\r\n\r\nIt is very much to the credit of the administration journals of\r\nthe State that, so far as they discussed beforehand the claims and\r\nqualifications of the several candidates for the Democratic nomination\r\nfor Governor, they frankly recognized the fact that the logic of the\r\nDemocratic professions of reform pointed unmistakably to the gentleman\r\nwho was nominated at Syracuse on Thursday. Indeed, they almost may be\r\nsaid to have advised and urged his nomination. In doing this we give\r\nthem credit for rising above the narrowness of partisanship, and for\r\ntaking into view the great public benefit to be derived from having\r\nfor the candidates of both parties men of distinguished ability and\r\nunimpeachable integrity, instead of following the instincts of a petty\r\nand unpatriotic selfishness by endeavoring to induce their opponents\r\nto weaken and stultify themselves. Mr. Tilden, at no small risk of\r\npersonal popularity and political influence, and with no conceivable\r\nmotive but a desire for the public good, had fairly revolutionized\r\nhis own party. In arresting the corrupt and profligate career of the\r\nRing that ruled it, he has contributed to its temporary defeat. But\r\nthe movement he led was a success, and the party was shrewd enough\r\nto discern in the signs of the times the wisdom of assuming the\r\nresponsibility and claiming the credit for the reform. They have done\r\nthis persistently.\r\n\r\nIt was plain enough to the most casual observer that from the moment\r\nMr. Tilden consented to have his name presented as the candidate\r\nfor Governor of the party to which he had been so conspicuous in\r\nadministering discipline, that party could not reject him without\r\nconfessing the insincerity of its boasting over what was in so marked\r\ndegree his work. Not to have nominated him would have been justly\r\nconsidered a rebuke and a warning to any and all who should hereafter\r\nput party success in jeopardy for the sake of putting a stop to public\r\nrobbery. The administration newspapers which pointed out the folly\r\nand danger of such a course deserve praise for rising above the small\r\nstrategy, hypocrisy, and trickery so common in politics. We have\r\nalready expressed the opinion that the convention which nominated Mr.\r\nTilden was driven to it by the logic of events and as a consequence\r\nof its professions of reform. That the nomination is offensive to a\r\nconsiderable number of the party, who were directly or indirectly\r\ndisturbed by Tweed's overthrow, is an admitted fact; and there was, no\r\ndoubt, considerable hesitation in the minds of many influential leaders\r\nover the question whether, upon the whole, it would be safe to offend\r\nthese people for the sake of making a consistent record for the party.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Tilden himself, it can be of comparatively little\r\nconsequence to him personally now whether he is or is not elected. He\r\nhas accomplished a great work in his party, has led a great reform,\r\noverthrown a powerful organization of municipal thieves, and compelled\r\na recognition of his services more emphatic and pronounced in the\r\nmere form of the nomination than an election could be under any other\r\ncircumstances. We presume he has not deceived himself with the idea\r\nthat the administration journals which have heretofore bestowed upon\r\nhim such copious praise, and have so frankly pointed out to his party\r\nhis strength as a candidate, have thereby estopped themselves from\r\nattacking his principles and his character. As citizens, the gentlemen\r\nwho conduct these newspapers are doubtless glad to be assured that,\r\nwhatever may be the result of the election, the office of Governor will\r\nbe filled by an able and upright gentleman of whom they need not be\r\nashamed. As partisans, however, they propose to find whatever joints\r\nthere may be in his harness and to defeat him if they can. One organ,\r\nwe perceive already, after remarking that it does not know positively\r\nthat if elected he would misuse the power intrusted to him, calls\r\nattention to the fact that he has acted as counsel for some of the\r\ngreatest railroad corporations in the State, and suggests in a wise\r\nway that it might be very dangerous at this time to put such a man\r\nin the executive chair. Another gives him credit for his services in\r\noverthrowing the Tweed Ring, but adds that he did not do it at the\r\nright time; that he ought to have done it sooner. It does not accuse\r\nhim of dishonesty, but feels compelled to call him a \"moral coward.\"\r\nAnd so they go. Of course there will be a great deal of it before\r\nthe campaign is over, a great deal that is mean and contemptible and\r\ndishonest, but just now we prefer to consider the unusual honesty\r\nand frankness with which the administration press treated the\r\nquestion before the nomination, and to give credit for sincerity and\r\nindependence.

But I feel constrained to decline for two principal\r\nreasons: 1st, I have no taste whatever, but rather an aversion, for\r\nmilitary display, and could not persuade myself to appear in uniform\r\non occasion; and I never want to take my position without doing the\r\nfull duty pertaining to it. 2d, if I were to accept I might lay\r\nmyself open to the suspicion or charge that while I had recommended\r\na fellow-citizen for position necessary to serve you that I should\r\naccept, the case would be different, and I would be willing to yield\r\nmy own preferences and meet the suggested thoughts of others. But I\r\nfeel that by declining I enable you to give the place to some one of\r\nthe many seekers after it, who have a taste for and will be glad to get\r\nit. I appreciate your reasons for declining to appoint the gentleman\r\nrecommended by me, and if I were in your place I would have no one\r\nabout me tainted with Hoffmanism in any way.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours, &c.,\r\n                     \"WM. PURCELL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR TILDEN TO JOHN KELLY\r\n\r\n  \"ALBANY, _Feb'y 28, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir,--Your note came this morning, and it finds me in a moment\r\nof comparative leisure which I have scarcely had for weeks, so I avail\r\nmyself of the indisposition to do anything more serious to reply.\r\n\r\n\"You need not be disgusted by the awkward accident about McLaughlin,\r\nfor, tho a little ridiculous, it is not serious; as I had all the\r\nelements of decision I acted at once to avoid the competition which\r\nso attractive an office was sure to cause. You will, no doubt, be\r\nsurprised if I say that I acted in this case with no more celerity than\r\nI have with three-quarters of the important appointments, and nearly\r\nall the small ones which I have had to deal with. For the grumble at my\r\ndelays has no doubt reached you.\r\n\r\n\"A small coterie of rogues, who, when they first recovered from the\r\nsubduing effect of the election, started into a life of whispers, first\r\ncirculated the rumor that I had a softening of the brain; next, that\r\nI had suffered a stroke of paralysis; then, that I went to bed drunk\r\nevery night; and at last came to the statement that I had lost my\r\n'snap'--that I had not decision or energy to make proper removals or\r\nappointments, and, indeed, had become physically unable to make up my\r\nmind about anything.\r\n\r\n\"Well, under every mountain of lies there is usually a grain of sand\r\nof truth. In the interminable conferences with public bodies and\r\ncommittees and officers from Nov. 5 to Dec. 25th, I did become very\r\nweary, and felt some exhaustion of nervous force and much indigestion.\r\nIn the hurried preparation of the message I rested; and with all the\r\nburdens since, have recuperated, got arrears nearly cleared off,\r\nappointments made, bills--some passed and others ready--and my physique\r\nwell-nigh restored after six months of heavy strain.\r\n\r\n\"As to appointments, while the most have been despatched rapidly as\r\nsoon as reached, three classes have felt some delay.\r\n\r\n\"1st. Where there was no haste, and more important matters claimed\r\nthe earlier attention. It is very likely I have not been altogether\r\nwise, as the world is largely made up of fools, in this respect. I am\r\nso formed constitutionally that I concentrate on what seems of first\r\nimportance, and defer with almost contemptuous indifference what can as\r\nwell or better wait.\r\n\r\n\"This is the habit which has given me success in business, in affairs,\r\nin the conduct of parties, in all things where military organizations\r\nand strategy require a concentration of all resources and efforts on\r\nthe turning-point of the battle to break thro the opposing lines.\r\n\r\n\"But the hungry office-seeker sees only the narrow personal interest\r\nhe pursues, and perhaps the appointing power should act consistently\r\nin respect to its general duties for the sake of dealing with fools\r\naccording to their folly. Perhaps so.\r\n\r\n\"2nd. When things were to be worked out which could only be known to\r\nthe appointing power. For instance, a gentleman sent me a memorandum\r\nfrom Archbishop McCloskey suggesting two Catholic gentlemen for\r\nthe Board of State Charities. He did not know that I had but three\r\nvacancies from N. Y., and that Mr. Jno. C. Deveraux, of Utica, would\r\ngo out by expiration of his term if not reappointed. I sent to him to\r\nhave his choice between the two he named, if only one of them could be\r\ntaken, and to inform him about Dr. D. He gladly preferred the latter\r\nto one of his own nominees. Mr. D., you must know, is one of the best\r\nfamilies of the interior, of the old and early Catholic aristocracy--a\r\nbrother-in-law of Senator Kernan. How could I drop him?\r\n\r\n\"The one whom the archbishop preferred is the one who stands at the\r\nhead of your list--Henry Hoguet. Then I wished to take one of the\r\nHebrew persuasion if I could get a satisfactory one. I have good names,\r\nbut location may compel me to forego this purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Then Mr. Howard Potter, who is one of the members resigning, making\r\nthe vacancies I am to fill, has applied for an opportunity to see me\r\nbefore I make the appointment.\r\n\r\n\"These arrangements take time, only known to me.\r\n\r\n\"The case delayed the most was that of judge in this district. There\r\nwere applicants from communities from all over the district. The\r\nappointment was made in a few hours after the last hearing was given,\r\nwhich it would have been an offence to refuse. I have more doubt about\r\nthe delay in this case than in any other, but the result is general\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"3rd. But the _real grumble_ is from those who ask for action which is\r\ndoubtful or suspicious or which is certainly wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Our friend, Mr. Speaker MacGuire's grievance is this: There has been\r\nstarted the erection by the State of public buildings at four places\r\nbeside the capital of a most extravagant character. One was the Elmira\r\nReformatory. This was taken out of the hands of a commissioner and put\r\nin charge of an architect. Him I have the power to remove.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after I came here my old acquaintance, Steve Arnot, broke in\r\nhalf drunk, leading in the Speaker, Charles Walker, and Senator Bradley.\r\n\r\n\"He insisted that I should instantly turn out the architect and put in\r\na man named by him.\r\n\r\n\"As there was no work going on, and the change might involve questions\r\nabout contracts which had been broken--new ones pending, others to\r\nbe made, and would involve the whole responsibility of wisdom and\r\nfrugality and honesty in the construction--I thought the Governor\r\nhad better not abdicate his functions, but had better look carefully\r\ninto the whole matter before he embarked himself and the party on the\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\"The five buildings, including the capital, are popularly estimated to\r\ncost 25 or 30 millions.\r\n\r\n\"I treated the matter very kindly, but deferred it. I shall continue\r\nto do that until I know enough about it to act wisely. If I change the\r\nmanager it will not be for patronage (one $4000 office of an expert),\r\nbut to a man in whom I can have a personal trust that he will not\r\ndisgrace me.\r\n\r\n\"My information is that the Democrats of Elmira and the county\r\ndeprecate nothing so much as a return of the odium they have once had\r\nto bear. I had no reason to suppose there was any special discontent\r\nuntil it appeared. The Speaker had informed me he had introduced a bill\r\nwhich would make all right.\r\n\r\n\"Since I have written so much more than I intended I will turn back and\r\nmake it personal.\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly, &c.\r\n\r\n\"I have omitted to mention several narrow escapes. The balance is still\r\nin favor of wariness, notwithstanding some friends get tremors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN KELLY TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"315 LEX.

I am gratified, too,\r\nthat Stemmler still is in the land of the living.\r\n\r\n\"I met your nephew, Mr. Pelton, at Marble's, as I presume he has so\r\ninformed you, and there told him of Stemmler's death and advised a\r\nspeedy appointment to fill the vacancy. My information was from the\r\nCounty Clerk's office; one of the principal clerks employed there gave\r\nme the information, and handed me at the same time the _Daily News_,\r\nwhich contained an account of the death of Stemmler.

He has\r\npracticed law in this city, but is at present a clerk in the County\r\nClerk's office. He has the reputation of being an elegant gentleman and\r\nscholar, speaking several languages. Judge Stemmler, however, is still\r\nalive.'\r\n\r\n\"I did not suppose that you would act promptly, and regret that the\r\naffair has occurred.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to thank you for your well-disposed intention to do this\r\nkind favor.\r\n\r\n\"Wm.

It's unjust, then, to\r\nDunham that he should not be paid. It appears that the gaol has always\r\nbeen supported by the county, yet there was no law authorizing it to be\r\ndone. This was discovered when the predecessor of Dunham sued for his\r\nmoney on Green having refused to pay him. Dunham would not have taken\r\nthe place if he had known that there was doubt about the remuneration.\r\nThis law, then, as you have evidently seen, simply allows the Board of\r\nSupervisors to pay him what is just and proper for services rendered,\r\nand for which he has not been paid by the county.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n                       \"JOHN KELLY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"FORT WASHINGTON, _Feb. 25, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR GOV.,--I have perused the substitute. As a matter of course my\r\nfirst thought was that of a Yankee. I set to work guessing what could\r\nbe the _motive_ of the change.\r\n\r\n\"The substitute is so much more broadly comprehensive than I feared the\r\n'toned-down' document would be that this conjecturing process led me\r\ninto what, even to myself, seems a strange dance.\r\n\r\n\"The substitute proposed is very good, nay, it is as good and as\r\nperfect as the original, save in one single point. It covers every\r\nground I ever had in view, _save one_.\r\n\r\n\"And, who beneath the sun, can stand in the gap opposing that?\r\n\r\n\"Now let me explain to you my thoughts and mental processes.\r\n\r\n\"The swindlers have removed their property, _i. e._, the plunder, out\r\nof the State of New York. When the infamous decision was made in the\r\nState's own court that it, _i. e._, this State itself, _had no title_,\r\nthat judicial point was thenceforth law in all foreign courts. If the\r\nState should bring an action in any foreign court, such court would be\r\nbound to decide against the plaintiff on the strength of that decree,\r\nsubstantially made _by such plaintiff itself_. But when the county or\r\ncity or any like entity brought its action, the maintainability of\r\nthat action would be a judicial question, determinable by the foreign\r\njudges according to their own views derived by them from the general\r\nprinciples of jurisprudence. These principles taught me, and should\r\nteach them, that as to most of these fraudulent abstractions the\r\nsubordinate local entity had no title.\r\n\r\n\"When conferring with you concerning this subject prior to your message\r\nI distinctly stated this consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Though this may seem the product of a jurisprudent's recondite\r\nstudies, it was born of practical common sense, and what is, perhaps,\r\nmore to the point of my next observation, and to which it is\r\npreliminary, this idea is of a nature to be eminently popular. It\r\nmight fairly be thought somewhat sensational.\r\n\r\n\"I was amazed to miss it from the lines of your message. If the thought\r\nthat _you_ could have any hesitation about pursuing the plunderers\r\nand their plunder to the ends of the earth presented itself to me at\r\nall--as I must suppose was not the case--it was, of course, instantly\r\nrejected as fanciful and silly.\r\n\r\n\"But now, after a long pause for thought, forth comes the substitute\r\nfor your own original conception, so long and so faithfully nurtured\r\nand cherished by me. And what is the difference between the original\r\nand the substitute? Nothing whatever, except this one thing.\r\n\r\n\"The title to and ownership of the money or cause of action is to\r\nremain unchanged!! Since that title was Allenized it is _not_ in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\"In all the courts of this State your substitute will be just as good\r\nas the original. For _any_ future local frauds I do not see but it\r\nis likely to answer every purpose. The single effect wrought by the\r\nalteration is that the stolen funds now in 'Belgium or Brittany' will\r\nbe safe for the enjoyment of the thieves.\r\n\r\n\"To Dick Connolly it presents perfect immunity.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps on this point you may say simply that I am mistaken; but such\r\na remark never convinces any one. The mistake may exist, but the child\r\nof error never can see his mistake until some one takes the trouble of\r\ndissecting it and showing by adequate explanations that it is a mistake.\r\n\r\n\"I have done as to this substitute. No further observations upon it\r\nseem needful.\r\n\r\n\"The Tweed spirit is rampant here. It is determined to possess itself\r\nof unrestrained power over all the offices as avenues to plunder. The\r\nlocal suits against Tweed _et al._ will no doubt be pushed; but if any\r\njudgments shall be rendered which the gang shall dislike, their friends\r\nin the _Refugium Peccatorum_, as in duty bound, will reverse. Meantime\r\nthe Statute of Limitations will do its kindly work.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours, &c.,\r\n                     \"CH.

I wanted to say what I know it is unnecessary\r\nto say, but might be cheering and strengthening to you, that in this\r\nstruggle with Tweed's scattered forces, led by the Mayor, to recover\r\npossession of the city treasury, you will be sustained if you are, as\r\nI am sure you will be, firm and defiant. You have only to inspire the\r\npublic with confidence that you cannot be seduced or bullied into any\r\nconcessions to the predatory class which is 'trying it on' with you,\r\nand you will find all of this city worth having are your friends. I am\r\ntold that the Senate is likely to squelch the Costigan bill. If so,\r\nthey will do wisely for themselves, no doubt, but they will deprive you\r\nof an excellent opportunity in a veto message to give Wickham his _coup\r\nde grace_.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing you ever did that went so to the heart of the\r\nNew-Yorkers as the way you doubled up Tweed and his pals. This movement\r\nagainst Green is the secondary symptoms of the same disease, and offers\r\nyou an opportunity of which, I take it for granted, you will avail\r\nyourself of strengthening the public confidence in your chieftainship.\r\n\r\n\"You do not need to be told that nothing would be so fatal to you as\r\nthe friendship of the Ring who are trying to force you into their\r\nintrigues to plunder the city.

He doubtless supposed that that was the\r\nnecessary result of doing his duty. But such was not the impression\r\nleft upon the Governor's friends, and the following letter from Mr.\r\nHewitt was not the first indication of a public sentiment which made\r\nhis nomination for that office, at the expiration of Connolly's term,\r\nwhich he was serving, impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAM S.

I am\r\nsatisfied that he will meet your views on every point except the\r\nretention of Green. Now you cannot afford to let Green be slaughtered,\r\nbut Green can very well afford, in view of the momentous consequences\r\nto you involved in a disruption of the party machinery here, to solve\r\nthe difficulty by placing his resignation in your hands, to be used\r\nonly when a successor satisfactory to you and to Kelly can be agreed\r\nupon. I had a long talk with Green on Sunday night. He believes his\r\nposition to be impregnable, and he is not at all conscious of the\r\nintense disgust with which he is regarded by the Tammany organization.\r\nHe even thinks that the general committee might be got to indorse him.\r\nI told him very frankly that in my judgment it would be destruction\r\nto those who are really his friends to make any such issue in the\r\ncommittee, and I tell you that it is no use to try it. Your position\r\nand character will be with me the first consideration, and after that\r\nit seems to me that Kelly's position should be made as easy for him as\r\nthe circumstances will admit. I think he understands Wickham now, and\r\nyou and he ought never to be lacking in a perfect understanding with\r\neach other. I have not seen Kelly, as I would have been glad to do,\r\nbut you are at perfect liberty to show him this letter if you choose,\r\nas there is nothing in my mind that I would not be willing to say to\r\nhim personally on these topics, if he were to think it worth while to\r\nconsult with me.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ruggles has been to see me with regard to the Davis canal bill,\r\nwhich he thinks is a blunder; he is quite clear, and I agree with\r\nhim, that the canal can only be properly administered by a general\r\nsuperintendent, nominated by the Governor, and approved by the Senate.\r\nThe Governor should have the power to suspend or remove the general\r\nsuperintendent for cause. In this way the Governor will have the direct\r\ncontrol of the canal, and the canal commissioners be relegated to their\r\nproper duties of auditing the expenditures, and seeing that the general\r\nsuperintendent does his duty.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that the position in which Davis has placed himself\r\nin regard to the Tammany delegation affords an unusually favorable\r\nopportunity for getting this legislation. It might be brought in as a\r\ncounter-proposition to Davis's bill. If you had a proper understanding\r\nwith Davis in advance, and he would agree to make not more than a\r\nnominal opposition to the substitute, the canals could thus be rescued\r\nfrom the corrupt ring which has plundered the revenues for so many\r\nyears. If your administration could accomplish any such result it would\r\nbe a great triumph, as well as a priceless benefaction to the people of\r\nthis State.\r\n\r\n                            \"Faithfully yours,\r\n                                               \"ABRAM S.

You will have probably seen, ere\r\nthis can reach you, a partisan opinion in the _Herald_ pronouncing\r\nyour authority in the matter of removals limited to a Delphic response\r\nwhether the 'reasons' or the 'causes' are sufficient. This, too, to be\r\npronounced in the Mayor's specification of his reasons, without any\r\nauthority on your part to look out of it.\r\n\r\n\"This is unsound. Your power of approval is just like the Mayor's power\r\nof removal--absolutely discretionary. You are not bound to pass upon\r\nthe 'causes' assigned nor the 'reasons' communicated. The grammatical\r\nimport of the law and the good sense of the thing show that your\r\napproval is to apply to the removal, _i. e._, the act itself.\r\n\r\n\"This journalist's reasoning would tie you up very closely. If the\r\nMayor were to remove Comptroller on the ground that he had shown\r\nhimself quite unworthy of confidence by kicking his wife in a church on\r\nSunday, in the face of the whole congregation during divine service,\r\nthe only point before you would be whether such a cause--assuming\r\nthe fact to be as asserted--was in point of law sufficient ground of\r\nremoval. Though Green had no wife, was sick in bed at home on the\r\ndesignated Sunday, and that, owing to bad weather or some accidental\r\ncause, there was no service in his church on that day, you must approve\r\nhis removal and let him be kicked out unless you were prepared to say\r\nthat, in point of law and reason, such misconduct was not objectionable\r\nin a public officer.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, the Democratic branch of the Tweed Ring is no better\r\nthan the Republican branch of the same. The former and the latter have\r\nthe same aims. Either from weakness or something else, the Mayor goes\r\nwith 'our friends.'\r\n\r\n\"You must make up your mind to go with that interesting party or to go\r\nagainst it. I am against it; nothing will persuade me to withhold any\r\nlittle power I possess from the anti-swindler-ism party.\r\n\r\n                               \"Yours truly,\r\n                                                   \"CH.

The press exerts a wonderful influence, but there\r\nare exigencies in which its efforts to arrest abuses may be greatly\r\nstrengthened by public opinion expressed in more authentic form.\r\n\r\n\"In Louisiana the executive branch has for some time past been kept\r\nin place only by soldiers under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the United States armies. The judges hold their offices by favor\r\nof the same Presidential commander. Now he has taken possession of\r\nthe only remaining branch of the State government, the Legislature,\r\nby direct military force. The usurpation is complete. The State\r\ngovernment is extinct. One State in the Union has ceased to be. The\r\natrocious despatch of General Sheridan, commander at New Orleans, to\r\nthe Secretary of War, illustrates the arbitrary spirit and thirst for\r\nunlimited martial power that inspires the orders under which he holds\r\nthe State in subjection, and exhibits in true colors himself a willing\r\nand dangerous instrument of ambitious aspirations.\r\n\r\n\"Under this crisis I beg respectfully to suggest for your consideration\r\nwhether some official demonstration ought not to be made by the\r\ngovernment of this State--an expression of strong reprehension and\r\nwarning--in the hope that it may aid in recalling to their proper\r\nduties those who are now lending their official influence to the\r\noverthrow of our republican institutions. A special message by you to\r\nthe Legislature and a prompt and energetic protest by the Assembly,\r\nand I should hope by the Senate also, may be a timely measure of\r\nfar-reaching benefit.

Upon one point I am anxious--that is the _canal\r\nquestion_. The constitutional amendment, the state of the country, and\r\nthe condition of commerce makes this the leading question of the day.\r\nIt has, since you dealt with it, taken new forms and aspects. There\r\nare some facts which may not be known to you. This subject cannot be\r\ntreated by you in your annual message in a clear, full way. It needs a\r\nmessage for itself. If you will simply give the return of last year's\r\nbusiness, and then, without indicating any _policy_ upon _any point_,\r\nsay you will send in a special communication with regard to it, you\r\nwill be able at your own time to treat the subject in a way which\r\n[will] interest the whole country. You can neither do yourself nor the\r\ncanals justice by speaking about them without making a long message,\r\nwhich must be avoided. There will be another advantage in this. You\r\nwill have a rod over those whose purposes and plans are yet to be\r\ndisclosed. I have my fixed and settled opinion about the canals to\r\nwhich I am publicly committed, and I do not like to clash with yours,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"My health is not good, and I do not know when I can go away from home.\r\n\r\n  \"I am truly yours, &c.,\r\n                       \"HORATIO SEYMOUR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"FORT WASHINGTON, _February 10, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR GOV. TILDEN,--Your favor of the 8th is this instant received.\r\nI have never met the Mayor but once. I then discovered that his prime\r\nobject seemed to be the removal of Green. This is the prime object\r\nof all the swindlers, whatever political banner they sail under. Our\r\nfriend Marble is also hostile to him. _They_ are determined to get him\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"I drew the impeachment of the counsel. As drawn it contained what\r\nmore prudent men than myself might pronounce an injudicious paragraph\r\nagainst the appeals majority. In a council, consisting of Marble,\r\nBurton N. Harrison, and perhaps others, this was stricken out, and\r\nperhaps rightly. The keystone to the arch imparting favor to Tweed\r\nwas the story of the substitution of Curtis and Porter for Barlow and\r\nPeckham. But I had to acquiesce in omitting that. The letters on _this_\r\nsubject are in the New York papers about 30th and 31st December.\r\n\r\n\"The Mayor sent to Barlow, Peckham, and myself for our suggestions on\r\nthe council's answer. Peckham's and mine contain all that is needful on\r\nthis subject. Mine, unwisely, you will say, opens fire on the judicial\r\nmajority, and states with suitable words of characterization the Porter\r\nand Curtis substitution. This you will probably not disapprove.\r\n\r\n\"To understand this branch of the case precisely you should know a few\r\nfacts. I had all my life greatly aided and befriended this man. But\r\nthis was not strange; I always aid the needy and never strike any one\r\nwillingly. He thought me very amiable, but took good care to keep out\r\nof my way from the moment he took office until he was accused. Then\r\nhe could scarcely believe his senses; so, near midnight, he visited\r\nme, cried, implored, etc., etc. I gave him no hope, and to his face\r\ncondemned him, observing courtesy to be sure in the choice of words.\r\nI commented in terms as apt as this duty would permit, on his Porter\r\nand Curtis affair. This will serve to account for his _subsequent_\r\nattempt to reinstate Barlow and Peckham. No more need be stated. I have\r\nrequested Peckham to send you a copy of his reply to Smith; a copy of\r\nmine will reach you as soon as it can be made.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure the _power_ that is bent on removing Green will not\r\nimprove the Corporation Counsel's office; consequently, I cannot desire\r\nthat the Mayor should be free to fill it.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you know that the only political sentiment in which I\r\nindulge is hostility of official thieves. This, like my hostility to\r\nthe negro war, places me almost alone. Some degree of circumspection in\r\nmy movement is therefore necessary; and, perhaps, some little caution\r\non the part of political men how far they permit themselves to be\r\nseen in my company, or to be suspected of being influenced by me, is\r\ndesirable to _them_.\r\n\r\n\"Hence I doubt the expediency for _either of us_ of my putting up at\r\nthe Governor's mansion for a day or two.\r\n\r\n\"I may say very little, and will probably do very little to testify my\r\ndissent; but I will see better reasons than have yet been exhibited\r\nbefore I will in any way assent to Judge Allen's standing as the law of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n\"Were I Governor I would not assent to Smith's removal without an\r\nassurance as to the successor. But this, of course, should have no\r\ninfluence with you; for, as far as you have indicated a choice to me,\r\nyou have not named any one who would impart to that office the needed\r\nvigor. At least such is my belief.\r\n\r\n\"I am morally certain that the majority in the 'hybrid body' will on\r\nsome impalpable technicality defeat any civil suit that can now be\r\nbrought against the Ring. Nothing but the clearing up bill now in your\r\nhands will draw their teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMALCOLM CAMPBELL[65] TO TILDEN\r\n\r\n  \"_Confidential._\r\n\r\n                               \"NEW YORK, _March 2d, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR GOVERNOR,--The enclosed will show you how I employ a leisure\r\nhour. Although I have not been editor of _Frank Leslie's_ since I\r\nleft it after the campaign of '72 I occasionally write for it, and my\r\narticles are always published. My feelings towards you have already\r\nbeen shown in the columns of that paper, and anything I can do in the\r\nfuture will be most cheerfully done.\r\n\r\n\"I hope and expect to see you our nominee for President next year;\r\nand therefore, assuming the privilege of old friendship, I give you\r\nmy views on a few points, even at the risk of appearing to offer\r\nunasked-for, and perhaps unwelcome, advice. It was said, and I think\r\ntruly, that a President, when in office, knew less of the true state of\r\npublic opinion than any ordinary observer. Perhaps the rule may hold\r\ngood in a modified degree as to a Governor. If so, I trust you may be\r\nan exception.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I reflect the opinion of a large portion of our citizens\r\nat the present moment when I say that Mayor Wickham is thought to be\r\ndrifting in the direction of 'personal government,' with a very strong\r\nleaning, in the distribution of the most important places, towards his\r\nformer associates in Apollo Hall. The gentleman said to have been fixed\r\nupon by him for Corporation Counsel, Mr. Whitney, is entirely unknown\r\neither by the bar or the general public, except by the fact that he\r\nran for District Attorney on the Jimmy O'Brien ticket. His appointment\r\nwould give satisfaction to no one but those immediately benefited by\r\nit, while the selection of O'Conor (if he would accept it), or Peckham,\r\nor, indeed, any well-known lawyer, would give assurance to the public\r\nthat the promises of reformed Tammany really meant something.\r\n\r\n\"It is probably apparent to you that a dead set is being made for the\r\nscalp of our old friend Green. He is undoubtedly the most unpopular man\r\nin the city, and such a movement would be too popular for any one but\r\na man of nerve to resist. As his name has been so intimately connected\r\nwith your own, your position, in case this issue is presented, would\r\nbe at least embarrassing, and the result, in any event, would be to\r\nyour prejudice in subjecting your action to criticism. It seems to me\r\nthat all this might be avoided by getting Green to resign, not as a\r\nforced measure, but as a voluntary act, and with flying colors; and he\r\nmight resume his old place on the parks, or receive some other position\r\nbetter suited to his tastes and temperament than the thankless office\r\nof Comptroller. I say this without a particle of hostility to Mr.\r\nGreen, for whose ability I have a great respect, and in whose honesty I\r\nhave unbounded confidence. I have no personal ends to subserve, and my\r\nsuggestions spring from a sincere desire to avoid in an honorable way\r\nthe possibility of persons who are not at heart friendly to you forcing\r\nupon you an issue which might injure you with the public. If you were\r\nto approve his removal, instead of being regarded as a second Brutus,\r\nyou would be accused of yielding to the pressure of those who had\r\ndesigns upon the treasury; if you declined it would be attributed to\r\npersonal friendship against the unanimous voice of your party in this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\"I trust that my remarks may not be considered intrusive.

Hammond,\r\nauthor of the _Political History of New York_, remarked that whatever\r\npolitical parties there might be in New York there always would be '_an\r\nErie Canal party_.'\r\n\r\n\"And he was right. There always has been a canal party. The\r\nConstitution of 1846 _manacled_ the State. It declared the canals\r\nshould never be sold. The spoils would be gone. The last constitutional\r\nconvention determined also to keep the manacles on. The Legislature\r\nhad provided that of the members of that convention thirty-two should\r\nbe named whose election should be secured, and this, too, without\r\nreference to location. Sixteen were named by the Republican party and\r\nsixteen were named by the Democratic party.\r\n\r\n\"Of this thirty-two, _not one_ whose residence was south of the\r\nMohawk and west of the Hudson was named by either party. There was\r\none north of the Mohawk. With that exception, commencing at New York\r\nand following up to Albany and Troy, and thence on the Erie Canal to\r\nBuffalo, we find the location of them all, except one or two on the\r\nlateral canals in the western parts of the State. There has not been\r\na high officer of the State in the same region for, I think, the last\r\nquarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, my dear Governor, there must still be a canal party. But\r\nI see you are resolved that the stealing shall cease. I was in the\r\nLegislature of 1869 with your brother, and on a celebrated occasion\r\nwitnessed his stern integrity. I recollect well putting my hand on his\r\nshoulder and remarking--\r\n\r\n    \"'Alone among the faithless,\r\n    Faithful only he.'\r\n\r\n\"I said then the blood of _old Dr. Younglove told_.

It will be your province to investigate\r\nthe facts and personal bearings of such charges as you have put forth\r\nin your excellent message in regard to the administration of the\r\ncanals. But the results are obvious to every intelligent citizen, and\r\nlead to the natural inference that the large sums appropriated, and the\r\nlegislation hitherto employed by the people of this State, to guard,\r\nimprove, and administer economically this great public enterprise, have\r\nbeen intrusted to parties either ignorant or irresponsible as to their\r\nduties in this matter.\r\n\r\n\"This is the present feeling of the people.

Of this you, of course, are\r\naware. Subsequently a resolution was adopted directing the judiciary\r\ncommittee to prepare a bill for the same object. Now, what I wish to\r\nsay is this: the friends of this move of both parties in both Houses\r\nshould be put upon their guard to see that it is what is required. You\r\nmust have the very _fullest power_ and authority. I found many warm\r\nfriends of yours in both parties in both Houses; but everything hangs\r\non your getting proper authority, and your friends must certainly be\r\nmost active and vigilant and _now_. The authority must be full and\r\nbroad. Each friend in both Houses ought to be fully posted as to how\r\nto act and what to do. The leaders in each House should be advised and\r\nmost thoroughly posted on all points. Concert of action is imperative.\r\n\r\n\"The shaping and passing of the bill is of the very highest moment.\r\n\r\n\"It should be carefully scrutinized and drawn before its introduction,\r\nand watched with the greatest assiduity and fidelity.\r\n\r\n\"You are fighting the whole 'Prussian army'--officers, rank, and file.\r\n\r\n\"You must succeed.

You may consider this presumptive, and if you do I shall not\r\ncomplain, or take exception thereto.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forget the promptness with which you responded to my\r\nappeal in behalf of Mr. McLaughlin, and I am afraid that my anxiety in\r\nhis behalf has subjected you to humorous criticism from your enemies\r\nand an anti-partisan press. I am, however, consoled by the fact that\r\nyou would have been more than pleased with the man. His abilities are\r\neminently superior to any person who fills these places at present. As\r\nan evidence of his talent I refer you to his description of yourself,\r\nex-Governor, and myself at an interview which took place at your house\r\nlast January. I did not even know that he intended to write anything,\r\nand was not aware of it until I saw it in Marlborough paper, M., etc.\r\nNow you will ask yourself what can be the motive. I will answer by\r\ntelling you none at all, except this that I am a lover of talent;\r\nbut I assure you that this gift would hardly influence me unless it\r\nwas coupled with inflexible integrity. He has both characteristics.\r\nHaving said this much relative to the man, I shall now speak of my\r\nimpression as to what has occurred in relation to McLaughlin's intended\r\nappointment and what ought to be done to place him and yourself right\r\nbefore an observing and critical public.\r\n\r\n\"You appointed him, and when you did so there was no vacancy. Your\r\nmotive was of the best kind. You relied entirely for your own\r\njustification on that which I represented to you. Would it not be well\r\nto appoint him again? This will enable him to appear well before the\r\npublic, and at the same time vindicate yourself and show the people\r\nwell-established consistency in what you originally intended for the\r\npublic good. If you think well of this idea--\r\n\r\n\"Then let me suggest to you another. Mc will not accept the place,\r\nand for the reason that he could not do so. The County Clerk is an\r\ninvalid, and is now in Florida seeking health. His deputy has been\r\nrecently appointed to the position of 'Dept. Commissioner of Public\r\nWorks.' McLaughlin has been promoted to G.'s vacancy, and could not\r\nin honor _except_ [_sic_] any position while his superior is abroad\r\nsick. The place of civil justice would be pecuniarily a godsend; his\r\nmoral obligations would prevent him from _excepting_ [_sic_] the place.\r\nThough, as I said before, it is due to him that the place should\r\nbe offered him in justification of you both. This would soften the\r\nasperities of the envious and silence the press, which is prone to\r\ncontemptuous ridicule. When he shall have resigned the position.\r\n\r\n\"Having said this much in favor of McLaughlin, I shall now give you\r\nmy opinion as to who should receive the appointment. After mature\r\nconsideration I have convinced myself that it is due to Alfred T.\r\nAckert, of your own district. He is honest, and possesses talent\r\nenough to make him a competent judge. The objection that would be\r\noffered that he is not a resident of the district ought not to have any\r\nconsideration with you, and for the reason that if the bill passes the\r\nLegislature to elect the civil justices on a general ticket, as I think\r\nit will, the local politicians will not have anything to say except in\r\na general way; and if they did object it would be but temporary.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will consider Ackert in relation to that appointment. He\r\nhas worked hard for three years in our organization, and his duties\r\nhave been exceedingly laborious, and yet he has never complained, but\r\nwillingly performed them with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\"I have just received Mr. Pelton's letter, in which he refers to the\r\nreceipt of my despatch relative to Col. Vilner. This must be a mistake.\r\nI did not send a despatch in behalf of the above-named gentleman, and\r\nif he received one it is a forgery. I sent one in the Stemmler's case,\r\nand no other one. There is no doubt of this gentleman's demise now.\r\nPerhaps you have not been aware of it. He died on last Sunday evening.\r\n\r\n\"Your message on the canals has raised you very high in the estimation\r\nof the men of all parties. _The wonder is now that none previous to you\r\nhad the courage to meet the men who instigated these frauds and to show\r\nthem to public condemnation. Your predecessors were as well informed\r\nof their existence as you; but for some reason of their own, not very\r\ndifficult to fathom, neglected their duty._ These exposures will have\r\na salutary effect, and will be the means of correcting abuses which\r\nshould have long since been eradicated.\r\n\r\n\"Pursue the good work you have commenced, no matter where the rod\r\nwill fall, either on friend or foe. It is about time that politicians\r\nshould understand that they cannot pursue their nefarious frauds under\r\nthe supposition that no harm can fall upon them on account of their\r\npolitical adhesion to party.\r\n\r\n\"You should take some steps on the papers before you in the case of\r\nSmith. You may depend that unless you do there will be a general attack\r\nmade on you by the papers of the city. It is already being whispered\r\nthat your recent message was concocted to divert attention from matters\r\nconnected with this city. Smith has not been idle in circulating the\r\nstory that you are his friend and will not remove him, notwithstanding\r\nthe onslaught which you helped to prepare against him at the beginning\r\nof the year. You have already had these papers too long without taking\r\naction. I beg of you to act immediately in this case. If you are not\r\nfully convinced in the fire commissioner's case, you can wait until you\r\nhave had further time, and yet I am fully satisfied that you have had\r\ntime enough to determine the course you ought to pursue.\r\n\r\n                            \"Yours very truly,\r\n                                                    \"JOHN KELLY.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_His Excellency S.

In that document he manifested broad and accurate knowledge\r\nin relation to the present condition of the canals, clearly pointed\r\nout their defects, and suggested the remedies that he deemed essential\r\nto their increased efficiency and productiveness; and also to the\r\nintegrity and economy of their administration. Among the remedies he\r\nsuggests are a proper disposition of the unproductive lateral canals,\r\nthe securing a uniform depth of seven feet in the waterway of the Erie\r\nCanal, and modifications in the present plan of administering them.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, in the judgment of the Chamber, it is absolutely\r\nessential to the efficient management of these canals that this\r\ndepartment of the State government should be under the control of a\r\nsingle executive head, appointed by the Governor and Senate, and\r\nremovable at the pleasure of the Governor, with power to appoint and\r\nremove his subordinates, and who alone should be held responsible for\r\nthe proper management of the canals. All experience goes to prove that\r\nthis is the only safe method of securing efficiency, fidelity, and\r\neconomy in the administration of public affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That this Chamber will watch with deep interest the progress\r\nof this praiseworthy effort of the Governor to secure perfect integrity\r\nin the Canal Department, and will aid that effort by all proper means\r\nwithin its power.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, duly authenticated by\r\nthe officers of the Chamber, be forwarded to his Excellency, Governor\r\nTilden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nG.

In his day the so-called Democratic wire-pullers and the\r\nso-called Republican wire-pullers understood each other and divided the\r\nspoils.\r\n\r\n\"This was a still existing policy at the last city election. Wales,\r\nthe Republican candidate for Mayor, was nominated in the interest\r\nof the regular Democratic nominee, and ran to secure the defeat of\r\nOttendorfer, who is an independent man, probably a very honest man and,\r\nfor aught I know or suspect, would have as truly supported integrity\r\nand justice in government as anybody else. Accordingly, Wales, as\r\nappeared by the papers, was a champion of Bill Costigan.\r\n\r\n\"The hungry are fierce, and hardly know what to do with themselves or\r\nwhere to turn.

It is strange that any\r\none claiming to be a Democrat could act so unwisely. Such acts as\r\nthese would destroy the best party organization in the country. I am\r\nastonished that our members could act so inconsistently. There is no\r\napparent head in the Assembly, and in its present disorganized state\r\nits inconsiderate acts will tend to weaken us in the State and be the\r\nmeans of getting up an outside organization to co-operate with the\r\nRepublicans next fall. Already this is being bruited about now. I had\r\nexpected that matters would proceed smoothly here in the future, and\r\nthere would have been no difficulty if discreet judgment had been used\r\nwhen this fiasco shall have subsided. I would advise that advances be\r\nmade to the well-intending members so that there may be entire unison\r\nof action. Above all, there must not be any disintegration among\r\nourselves, except so far as they relate to corrupt men, against whom we\r\nshould set our faces.\r\n\r\n\"Your act in pardoning Ingersoll was severely commented on at first.\r\nWhen your purpose was explained the reaction was instantaneous; all\r\nnow, or nearly all, commend you for it. The traitor is at all times\r\ndespised, but treason is thought well of, and particularly so when the\r\npeople have obtained a substantial benefit, which will be, no doubt,\r\nthe result in the Ring cases through the testimony of Ingersoll.\r\n\r\n\"Your steady and persistent course in these Ring frauds will\r\nimmortalize yourself, O'Conor, and those who have acted with you in the\r\ngood work you have and are performing in the interest of the people.\r\nMay God spare you and your assistants until you will have finished your\r\ntasks. Most of men would have become disheartened at the many repulses\r\nyou have met.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear Governor, you must have a man in the corporation\r\ncounsel's office who will act for the interest of the public. You\r\ncannot depend on the present incumbent in that office. If he were to\r\nact in good faith with you there still would be eavesdroppers about\r\nthe concern who would carry the news outside; there must be an entire\r\nregeneration in that office to make it effective.

Everything\r\nnecessary and within the limits of our power was done at once to\r\nprevent Tweed's escape on a discharge likely to be awarded by his\r\nfriends of the _Refugium Pec._ Other proceedings, it seemed to me,\r\nshould be cautiously and deliberately initiated. I could not help\r\nseeing the judiciary's headway against us, and that the Scovil remedies\r\nbill, wounded and paralyzed in its birth, limps sadly. So in whatever I\r\ndo I feel the necessity of caution.\r\n\r\n\"I have requested Peckham and his allies to pick up the outside\r\nbiographical facts concerning Sweeney and his tribe. How and when they\r\nwent off, where they are, etc., etc. Whilst this is progressing I stay\r\nhome and _pump_.\r\n\r\n\"The man is very intelligent; taught by his sufferings, he is perfectly\r\nbiddable and bent upon giving entire satisfaction. But men of his\r\ngrade are bad at delivery, and need a midwife who has much industry\r\nand inexhaustible patience. He is in low health, constantly taking\r\nmedicine, and it was not until Friday afternoon late that I got\r\npossession of him. The information comes forth very slowly, but I think\r\nin the most precise form. I got everything in the most painfully minute\r\ndetails; but it will not be painful reading. On the contrary, I think\r\nit will be as amusing as instructive. I throw it all into narrative\r\nform. It will read like a novel; and although it is bad policy in\r\ngeneral to show one's hand, I am under the impression that when I get\r\nthrough with him it would be a good operation to publish his narrative.\r\n\r\n\"Sweeney is cunning in the extreme, and no doubt had the concealment of\r\nhis tracks in view from the beginning. But it will surprise me if he\r\ncan escape. I shall try to put things in such a shape that we can drop\r\nsuddenly upon whatever may be here. I am told that he designed coming\r\nback to give his skilled talent to the task of defence. Between him and\r\nD. D. F. and the _Refugium Pec._ it might seem that a hopeful fight\r\ncould be maintained for a little while. But there can be only one end.\r\n\r\n\"I think we will want an agent in Paris. I know one, Henry Harrisse, a\r\nlawyer there, who formerly perched in this city. Though a Frenchman by\r\nbirth, he is perfectly conversant with our language, our people, and\r\nour affairs. I feel sure that he is honest and trustworthy. Had I not\r\nbest write to him at once? The Sweeney tribe will probably have to be\r\npursued to Europe. Tom Fields is there, and probably other subjects of\r\ndiscipline are or will be. Had I not best write to Harrisse at once and\r\nretain him?\r\n\r\n\"You must be patient, no time is being wasted.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n                 \"CHARLES O'CONOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEELER H.

Most of it is\r\ntransferred. I have complete lists of the property of the Sweeneys and\r\nHugh Smith, and _lis pendens_ ready to file the moment Mr. O'Conor gets\r\nthe suits ready to begin.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him yesterday and forwarded to you his letter, which you\r\nreceived this morning, I suppose. I cannot hurry him. He is making the\r\ncase as thorough and complete as possible. Ingersoll turns out to be\r\nall we expected, and is perfectly ready to do what he can.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anything can be lost by the few days' delay, as a\r\ntransfer just now would be so clearly for purposes of fraud as to make\r\nit of [not?] the least benefit.\r\n\r\n\"I saw an article in the _World_ to-day, copied from a Syracuse paper,\r\nto the effect that the Court of Appeals had come to a conclusion in the\r\nTweed case and in his favor and on the points raised by Comstock. I\r\ndon't believe it at all, but if so, it is most scandalous, as Comstock\r\nwas allowed to raise his points in reply, and we had no opportunity to\r\nanswer. There is nothing in his point as _habeas corpus_ serving, and\r\nalmost as clearly none as writ of error.\r\n\r\n\"If the court ever decided for Tweed it ought to be d--d eternally.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me almost impossible for it to do so honestly.\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n              \"WHEELER H.

This is no contract,\r\nproperly speaking, but only a letter from me to Henderson, in which our\r\nunderstanding respecting that matter is briefly stated. In the letter\r\nI simply say that I turn over the building to him, advise him to go on\r\nwith it on his own account, making it convenient for the publication\r\nof a daily newspaper, and expressing my desire that a lease for twelve\r\nyears of the necessary rooms shall be made to the _Evening Post_, 'the\r\nrent to be fixed by two competent and disinterested persons.'

Once we get fairly started everything\r\nwill move with the utmost rapidity. But getting the fair start is\r\nattended with no slight difficulty. The field is so wide and is so\r\nfull of minute details, and the sources of information are so much\r\nmore _responsible_ than formerly. We must not let our deponents\r\nmake any mistakes. Their knowledge being absolute and actual, their\r\nresponsibility is great. If through haste or want of memory mistakes\r\noccur they may be pronounced wilful, and thus their credit be\r\ndestroyed, or at least impaired. By interlocutory motions, such as\r\ndemands for impracticable things, as copies of destroyed papers, etc.,\r\nthey will bring _their_ judges down upon us, and thus precipitate the\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\n\"Probably this is well enough. If _their_ judges have resolution equal\r\nto their wishes they can defeat us, in despite of any legislation. But\r\nit is to be hoped that _fear_, like the cackling of the Roman geese,\r\nmay save the State.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that one of our N. Y. judges has pledged himself to save\r\nSweeney. Very likely. And, I guess, whenever he has a chance, the Mayor\r\nwill appoint as a corporation counsel a known friend of that absent\r\nfunctionary.\r\n\r\n\"My precise motive in writing at this time is to warn you of the\r\nnecessity of watching closely all amendments of the Code of Procedure,\r\nand any statutes concerning practice.

I would have prepared affidavits. He\r\nassumed the duty of so doing himself. At his request I wrote you to\r\npardon Ingersoll.\r\n\r\n\"He alone has seen Ingersoll, he proposing that it should be so.\r\n\r\n\"You say he is not above being helped and aided. I have been completely\r\nat his service from the moment he commenced till now. He has declined\r\nall assistance, saying that the drafting of affds., etc., was work at\r\nwhich but one could work. If there has been anything other or further\r\nthat I could do or could have done I do not know it.\r\n\r\n\"If the matter had been under my control I shd. have commenced suits\r\nand had attachments long before.\r\n\r\n\"They would have been without the perfect basis which the results of\r\nMr. O'Conor's long labor will disclose.\r\n\r\n\"It may be that such perfect basis, when disclosed, will be well worth\r\nall the delay.\r\n\r\n\"Whether so or not was and is for you and the Atty. Genl. to determine;\r\nnot for me.\r\n\r\n\"After Mr. O'Conor assumed the labor of preparing the case vs. Sweeney,\r\netc., it certainly would have been highly improper and indecorous for\r\nme to do otherwise than acquiesce. As to my personal action, all I can\r\nsay is that I have been at his service always. That I have urged haste\r\nas strongly as common courtesy to him would allow. You speak of what\r\nmight have been done 'if I had been really anxious to produce results.'\r\n\r\n\"I am at a loss to understand your meaning.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly _cannot_ mean what the words apparently mean.\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe that there ever was _a doubt_ in _your_ mind, or\r\nthe mind of any man, as to whether I was 'really anxious to produce\r\nresults.'\r\n\r\n\"If there was you should not have employed me or suffered me to be\r\nemployed. I _have_ waited for Mr. O'Conor. Could I or should I have\r\ndone otherwise? You say that Mr. O'Conor is above criticism. Agreed.\r\nBut so far as anxiety to produce results--so far as devoting all time\r\nor labor to the cause, so far as making this business the very first,\r\nto the exclusion of _everything else_ are concerned--I insist that I\r\nam as far above criticism as is Mr. O'Conor or any living man.\r\n\r\n\"If there is or has been any delay caused by want of zeal or attention\r\non my part I shd. like to know it.\r\n\r\n\"You will note that I make no criticism on the delay in the preparation\r\nof the affds. I have not seen them, nor do I know what they will be.\r\nFrom the general description of them, given me by Mr. O'Conor, I think\r\nthey will be well worth the delay, and when you come to know what he\r\nhas done I think you will wonder not at the delay, but at how soon an\r\nimmense work was accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"I only say in answer to your letter that the delay has been beyond my\r\ncontrol. Mr. O'Conor yesterday expressed great confidence that he would\r\nhave manuscript for me to begin printing by to-morrow or next day, and\r\nthat I shd. have the affds. for the use to oppose Tweed's motion for a\r\nbill of particulars June 1st.\r\n\r\n\"From what he has said I suppose that when ready for our use they will\r\nbe for all, and that we can commence the other suits next week.\r\n\r\n\"Whether the delay was wise or not is not the question.\r\n\r\n\"I only say that whether wise or unwise I am not _responsible_ for it,\r\nfor I had not the _power_ to control it. _Responsibility goes with\r\npower._\r\n\r\n  \"Yours truly,\r\n               \"WHEELER H.

In the mean time\r\nthe absorbing demands of measures of canal reform, and the pressure\r\nof legislative business superseded all less urgent matters; and in\r\naccordance with the usual practice of the executive office, this case,\r\nwith similar ones from other parts of the State, and with the mass of\r\nkindred business, was deferred until after the close of the legislative\r\nsession, and after the action on the bills and appropriations left at\r\nthe adjournment, I have now examined the voluminous papers submitted,\r\nand have carefully considered the facts and evidence which they\r\npresent, with the aid of such other light as was within my power.\r\n\r\n\"I am of the opinion that acts are established which amount to causes\r\nof the nature contemplated by law, and which would at least be\r\nsufficient to induce a private client to change his counsel.

TILDEN.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR,--Allow me to congratulate you on the success and popularity\r\nof your administration as Governor of the State of New York. It seems\r\nto have the true Bentonian and Silas Wright tone or ring in it. I like\r\nit, and wish you the most perfect and entire success in the noble and\r\npatriotic efforts you are making to ferret out and punish thieves,\r\nwithout regard to party, and bring back the administration of the\r\npublic affairs in the State of New York to the splendid condition they\r\nwere in when confided to the guidance and care of such men as Wright,\r\nMarcy, and others of their best and most influential days. May God give\r\nyou health and strength to carry out your noble purposes to the utmost\r\nlimit of your commendable aspirations.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice to hear of the signal defeat of the Democratic party of Ohio\r\non their shameful inflation platform; and I am prayerfully hopeful\r\nthat a similar result may accrue to the silly, not to say dishonest,\r\ninflationists of Pennsylvania. However much it may be regretted that\r\nthe foolish inflationists of the Democratic party should have had\r\nsufficient influence to insure its defeat this fall in those two\r\nStates, it will have the good effect to tumble out of the Presidential\r\npath several aspirants and possible candidates for that high office.\r\n\r\n\"The Democrats in the United States have once more the political\r\ncards in their own hands, and they are mostly trumps. Two-thirds, I\r\nmay venture to say, of the Republican party, are wearied, not to say\r\ndisgusted, with Grant's administration and sigh for a change, which\r\nwould have been affected at the last Presidential election but for the\r\ninconceivable folly of the Democratic party in nominating Greeley,\r\nwho for forty years had exerted himself to the utmost of his ability\r\nto destroy the party and malign and blacken the character of the most\r\npure-minded and patriotic members of it.\r\n\r\n\"'Free trade, reform, and speedy return to specie payments' should\r\nbe the conspicuous rallying or watchwords of the Democratic party\r\nin the future; and it must follow, as the night the day, that, with\r\nthat insignia inscribed upon its banners, and with candidates truly\r\nrepresenting the sentiment or policy it indicates, the party will next\r\nyear triumphantly sweep the country from one extremity to the other.\r\n\r\n\"Protective duties, Civil War, and excessive issues of paper money\r\nhave done much to demoralize the character of our people and waft the\r\ncountry towards the brink of ruin! It is high time to bring these\r\ndestructive measures to an end; and to the Democratic party, rightly\r\ndirected, is reserved the noble and patriotic mission of effecting this\r\nincalculable benefit to the United States, which would bring back the\r\nparty itself to the enjoyment of all of its pristine power and the warm\r\naffection of an overwhelming majority of the people.\r\n\r\n\"The war is happily at an end, and protective duties may be abolished\r\nby repealing the ruinous acts that authorize their unjust exactions.\r\nBut a return to specie payments cannot be effected by simply passing\r\nresolutions or empty and vague enactments of Congress. Something more\r\ngrave and important is required to insure this great and much-needed\r\nreform in the deplorable financial condition of the country.\r\n\r\n\"In an extremity, and as a _war measure_, the government, having\r\nundertaken to furnish a paper currency declared to be equal in value to\r\ngold; and having made that currency the basis of a system of banking,\r\nwhich has been generally adopted throughout the country, it cannot now\r\nwithdraw itself from the full responsibility of that position without\r\ngreat detriment to the best interests of the country, and incurring\r\nlasting dishonor, until it shall have, as it is abundantly able to\r\ndo, appreciated that currency and brought it up to par in gold. This\r\nbeing done, the government will have returned to specie payments;\r\nand greenbacks, being the basis of banking, the banks themselves\r\nwill also have resumed specie payments, if in a solvent condition,\r\nwith an augmented appreciation of the whole volume of the currency,\r\nincluding the greenbacks and the bills of the national banks equal to\r\nthe difference between the current value of the depreciated currency\r\nand the price of gold in the American market, which I perceive by the\r\nlast quotations is 16 per cent. This _agio_ or premium, calculated on\r\nthe whole amount of paper currency now issued by the national banks\r\nand the government (equal, I suppose, to no less than $700,000,000),\r\nwould amount to $112,000,000; and this large sum is simply what would,\r\nin that event, justly accrue to the possessors or holders of the\r\ndepreciated currency of the government and the national banks.\r\n\r\n\"How, it may be asked, can this desirable result be _easily_ attained?\r\nEvidently in no other way than by the government taking such steps\r\nand adopting such measures as will surely bring into its possession\r\nan amount of gold sufficient to enable it to deal in its own currency\r\nfor _all_ government transactions. How is this to be done? Simply by\r\na six-per-cent. 'redemption loan,' having 30 years to run, and to an\r\namount equal to the full volume of the greenback currency now afloat.\r\nI say _six per cent._ because I would make the absorption of the loan\r\n_speedy_ and _sure_, though it is not unlikely that a loan of the kind\r\nmight be slowly negotiated at 5 or even 4-1/2 per cent. interest. But\r\na government loan at 6 per cent., having thirty or even _twenty_ years\r\nto run, would be caught up with avidity by capitalists on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic at a large premium; and it would at once throw the\r\nbalance of trade in favor of the United States, so that there would\r\nbe no immediate demand for gold abroad. It would, also, break down at\r\nonce the mischievous ring speculations in gold at home, and obviate the\r\nnecessity of buying gold for the payment of customs; and as gold could\r\nbe obtained at any time for greenbacks or the bills of specie-paying\r\nbanks, the demand for it would become so small that gold, instead of\r\ncommanding, as it does at present, a ruinously high premium, would most\r\nlikely become a drug!\r\n\r\n\"Such a loan as I have indicated should be put upon the principal money\r\nmarkets of the United States and in Europe and bid for simultaneously,\r\nand _payable_ in _gold_.\r\n\r\n\"Should such a condition of monetary affairs be attained the government\r\nmight withdraw the greenbacks from circulation, so fast as the volume\r\nof currency necessary to meet the requirements of commerce should\r\nbe supplied by sound specie-paying banks, until the whole amount\r\n($400,000,000) shall have been retired, without disturbing materially\r\nthe general current of trade or adding a single dollar to the present\r\nindebtedness of the United States. The interest on the new loan would,\r\nof course, have to be provided for; but that would be more than\r\ncompensated by the saving of gold premium, now annually required in\r\npayments for foreign importations, which, whatever may be the amount,\r\nis added to the price or cost of all foreign commodities consumed by\r\nthe people of the United States. The loan, moreover, would doubtless\r\nbe taken at a premium of 10 to 15 per cent.; if so, $40,000,000 to\r\n$60,000,000 would be realized by the government by the operation.\r\n\r\n\"The glory of this great and patriotic achievement may be made to\r\nredound to the honor of the Democratic party is aroused to a proper\r\nsense of justice, and stimulated to a faithful performance of its\r\nobvious duty to the country; and, above all, inspired with a firm\r\ndetermination to be true to its own self.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to remain, with great respect,\r\n\r\n  \"Very truly, your friend,\r\n                          \"J.

AGGREGATE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\"_United States._--The valuation of the property of the U. S. by the\r\ncensus of 1870 was (in currency) $30,068,000,000. The returned assessed\r\nvaluation for the same year was less than one-half, or $14,178,000,000.\r\nThe census counted as property, both property and the evidence of debt\r\nsecured on such property. I do not think the productive capital of the\r\nUnited States in excess of $25,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"_Great Britain._--Baxter, in 1867-8, estimated, from accepted data,\r\nthe aggregate value of the real and personal property of the United\r\nKingdom at 6,000,000,000 _pounds_, or 30,000,000,000 dollars. I should\r\nput it for 1872 as high as _seven_, possibly _eight_, thousand million\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\"_France._--I know of no estimate of the aggregate value of property in\r\nFrance. I find several recent French writers, who incidentally refer to\r\nit, as less than that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"NO. 3 AND 5. ANNUAL GROSS AND NET INCOME ON SAVINGS.\r\n\r\n\"Baxter estimates, for 1867-8, the annual gross income of the United\r\nKingdom as 814,000,000, or $4,070,000,000; and the _net_ at about\r\n600,000,000, or $3,000,000,000. This last constitutes the fund out of\r\nwhich the nation feeds and clothes itself, pays taxes, and repairs\r\nand saves. I should estimate the gross income of Great Britain for\r\n1872-4 at full 1,000,000,000, and the net at 800,000,000. There are no\r\nreliable data for estimating annual savings, constituting new capital.\r\n_Ten_ per cent., which is a high estimate, in my judgment, would give\r\n80,000,000, or $400,000,000; and yet these figures are not consistent\r\nwith the recent returns of the Board of Trade, respecting the income\r\nfrom British foreign investments.\r\n\r\n\"_France._--Victor Bonnet asserts that the data are certain\r\nthat France before the war of 1870 saved annually as much as\r\n$400,000,000--2,000,000,000 francs; and thinks that the present saving\r\nis about $600,000,000. He quotes Sir Robert Peel, approvingly, to the\r\neffect that France, with equal revenues, saves more than Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"_United States._--Greater natural resources here give a greater gross\r\nand net income, with equal labor. I am inclined to put our gross income\r\nbetween $6 and $7,000,000,000. I do not believe our annual saving,\r\nin prosperous years, in excess of _five_ per cent., or from $300 to\r\n$400,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"4. ANNUAL INCOME FROM FOREIGN INVESTMENTS.\r\n\r\n\"_Great Britain._--A late number of the London _Economist_ puts\r\n80,000,000, or $400,000,000, as the minimum paid Great Britain by\r\nforeign countries for interest on capital invested abroad, and _for\r\nfreights and commissions_. The last year, I should think, represented\r\nfull _one-third_.\r\n\r\n\"_France._--The estimate of revenue derived by France from industrial\r\nenterprises in foreign countries and foreign loans, from 1873-4, is\r\nabout 260,000,000 francs, $52,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"_United States._--Nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"5. ANNUAL OUTGO TO PAY INTEREST ON FOREIGN DEBTS.\r\n\r\n\"_Great Britain._--Nothing.\r\n\r\n\"_France._--An inconsiderable amount, probably not in excess of 12 to\r\n15 millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\"_United States._--Not less than _one hundred millions_ of dollars.\r\nProbably more than less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"7.
