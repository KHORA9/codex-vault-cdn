If I had been susceptible to influences that\r\ncreate prejudice, nearly three centuries of American descent from\r\npurely Anglo-Saxon progenitors with no admixture of any other blood\r\nwould have predisposed me to magnify everything in this long feud that\r\nexemplified the prowess and the honor of that race, and to minify in\r\nthe telling whatever faults it had committed. It will be for such\r\nreaders of my work as are conversant with the ultimate authorities on\r\nthe subject treated of to judge how far I have succeeded or failed in\r\npresenting a “plain, unvarnished” tale.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge, with much gratitude, indebtedness for data to the\r\nfollowing distinguished writers:\r\n\r\nCanon W.

They were traders. The Hottentots had little to\r\nsell that they cared to purchase. The route for Portuguese commerce\r\nwith the East was west of Madagascar, consequently they found it\r\nunnecessary to put into Table Bay; the voyage from St. Helena to\r\nMozambique could be made comfortably without seeking a port of supply.\r\n\r\nBut when the Dutch wrested the eastern trade from the Portuguese, the\r\nsoutheastern portion of Africa assumed an importance to them that it\r\nhad never before possessed in the esteem of any other nation. Their sea\r\nroute to the East was south of Madagascar, and it was all but\r\nimperative that they should have a port of supply at the turning point\r\nof the long voyage between Holland and Batavia. It soon became their\r\npractice to call at Table Bay for the purpose of obtaining news, taking\r\nin fresh water, catching fish, and bartering with the natives for\r\ncattle—in which they were seldom successful.\r\n\r\nIn 1650 the Dutch East India Company, acting upon the reports and\r\nsuggestions of influential men who had visited Table Bay and resided in\r\nTable Valley several months, determined to establish at Table Bay such\r\na victualing station as had been recommended. In accordance therewith\r\nthe ships Reiger and Dromedaris and the yacht Goede Hoop—all then lying\r\nin the harbor of Amsterdam—were put in commission to carry the party of\r\noccupation to Table Bay, under the general command of Jan Van Riebeek.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 24th of December, 1651, the expedition sailed, accompanied\r\nby a large fleet of merchant vessels. On the morning of Sunday, the 7th\r\nof April, 1652, after a voyage of one hundred and four days, the site\r\nof their future home greeted the eyes of the sea-worn emigrants,—Table\r\nMountain, 3,816 feet high, being the central and impressive feature of\r\nthe landscape. In due time preparations were made to land and begin the\r\nnecessary operations in establishing themselves in the new and entirely\r\nuncivilized country.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Dutch East India Company was on a thoroughly\r\nmilitary system. It graduated downward from the home Assembly of\r\nSeventeen—who were supreme—to a governor-general of India and his\r\ncouncil resident in Batavia, and, ranking next below him in their\r\norder, to a vast number of admirals, governors and commanders—each\r\nhaving his own council, and acting under the strict rule that whenever\r\nthese came in contact the lower in rank must give place and render\r\nobedience to the higher. It is important to bear this in mind, as it\r\ngives a clear insight into the mode of government under which the\r\noccupation took place, and which prevailed with little variation for\r\nmore than a hundred years. The ranking officer of the expedition was\r\nJan Van Riebeek, and next to him in authority were the three commanders\r\nas his council in founding the settlement.\r\n\r\nVan Riebeek and the three skippers, having inspected Table Valley,\r\nselected a site for the fort a little in rear of the ground on which\r\nthe general postoffice of Cape Town now stands. On that spot a great\r\nstronghold was built in the form of a square strengthened by bastions\r\nat its angles. Each face of the fort measured 252 Rhynland feet—about\r\n260 feet English measure. The walls were built of earth, twelve feet\r\nhigh, twenty feet in thickness at the base, tapering to sixteen feet at\r\nthe top, and were surmounted by a parapet. Surrounding the whole\r\nstructure was a moat, into which the water of Fresh River could be\r\nturned. Within the walls were dwellings, barracks, storehouses and\r\nother conveniences that might be required in a state of siege. Around\r\nthe fort were clustered a walled kraal for cattle, a separate inclosure\r\nfor workshops, and the tents in which the settlers began their life in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of January, 1653, the last of the ships, the Dromedaris,\r\nsailed away and left the colonists to their own resources.\r\n\r\nThe history in detail of this first European settlement in South Africa\r\nis of surpassing interest; but, here, it must be sketched in the\r\nbriefest outline possible, up to the first contact of Boer with Briton.\r\n\r\nFor the first twenty-five years the aim of the colonists was to keep\r\nwithin easy reach of the fort at the Cape. Up to 1680 the most distant\r\nagricultural settlement was at Stellenbosch, about twenty-five miles\r\nfrom the Cape. Not till the end of the century did they push pioneering\r\nenterprises beyond the first range of mountains.\r\n\r\nThere was a steady though not very rapid increase of population. As\r\nearly as 1658 the disastrous step was taken of introducing slave labor,\r\nperformed at first by West African negroes—a step which encouraged in\r\nthe whites an indisposition to work, and doomed that part of Africa to\r\nbe dependent on the toil of slaves. To their African slaves the Dutch\r\nEast India Company added numbers of Malay convicts from Java and other\r\nparts of its East Indian territories. These Malays took wives from the\r\nfemale convicts of their own race, and to some extent intermarried with\r\nthe native African slave-women. From such marriages there arose a\r\nmongrel, dark people of the servile order, which became a considerable\r\nelement in the population of Cape Town and its neighboring regions.\r\n\r\nIn 1689 some three hundred French Huguenots came from Holland in a body\r\nand joined the colonists at the Cape. These were a valuable acquisition\r\nas an offset to the rapidly increasing servile element. They were\r\nmostly persons of refinement, and brought with them habits of industry,\r\nstrong attachment to the Protestant faith, and a supreme love of\r\nliberty. Many of the more respectable colonial families are descended\r\nfrom that stock.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat intolerant government of the Company hastened the blending\r\nof the various classes of the population in one. The Huguenots loved\r\ntheir language and their peculiar faith, and greatly desired to found a\r\nseparate religious community. But the Company forbade the use of French\r\nin official documents and in religious services. As a result of this\r\nnarrow but far-seeing policy, by the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nthe Huguenots had amalgamated with their Dutch fellow-colonists in\r\nlanguage, religion and politics. It was not until 1780 that the\r\nCompany’s government permitted the opening of a Lutheran church,\r\nalthough many Germans of that persuasion had emigrated to the Cape.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive Africander type of character began to appear at the\r\ntime when the settlers began to move from the coast into the interior\r\nof the country. There was everything to favor the rapid development of\r\na new type of humanity. For the most part the Dutch and the Germans\r\nbelonged to the humbler classes; the situation was isolated; the home\r\nties were few; the voyage to Europe was so long that communication was\r\ndifficult and expensive; and so they maintained little connection\r\nwith—and soon lost all feeling for—the fatherlands. As for the\r\nHuguenots, they had no home country to look to. France had banished\r\nthem, and they were not of Holland—neither in blood nor in speech. Thus\r\nit came to pass that the whites of South Africa who went into the\r\ninterior as pioneers went consenting to the feeling that every bond\r\nbetween Europe and themselves was severed—that they were a new people\r\nwhose true home and destiny, to the latest generations, were to be in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nMany of them became stockmen, roaming with their flocks and herds over\r\nvast tracts of grazing lands, for which they paid a nominal rent to the\r\nCompany. Some of them became mighty hunters of big game—like Nimrod;\r\nand even those who herded cattle and sheep were forced to protect\r\nthemselves and their live stock against lions and leopards and the\r\nsavage Bushmen who waged a constant warfare in which quarter was\r\nneither given nor expected. In such circumstances it is not wonderful\r\nthat the people who had in their veins the blended blood of Holland and\r\nNavarre developed to an almost unparalleled degree courage,\r\nself-reliance and love of independence, coupled with a passion for\r\nsolitude and isolation.\r\n\r\nAs inevitable results of the life they led—so isolated and wild—the\r\nchildren grew up untaught; the women, being served by slaves, lost both\r\nthe Dutch and French habits of thrift and cleanliness; and the men\r\nbecame indifferent to the elegancies of life, and grew more and more\r\nstern and narrow-minded on all questions of public policy and religion.\r\nBut there was no declension of religious fervor. In all their\r\nwanderings the Bible went with them as an oracle to be consulted on all\r\nsubjects, and the altar of family worship never lacked its morning and\r\nevening sacrifice. And they retained a passionate love of personal\r\nfreedom which no effort of the Company’s government could bring under\r\nperfect discipline.\r\n\r\nMagistrates and assessors were appointed in some of the distant\r\nstations, but they failed to control the wandering stockmen, who were\r\ncalled Trek Boers because they “trekked” from place to place. Being\r\ngood marksmen and inured to conflict with wild beasts and wilder men,\r\nthey formed among themselves companies of fighting men whose duty it\r\nwas to disperse or destroy the savage Bushmen. These independent\r\nmilitary organizations the government recognized and approved by\r\nappointing over them a field commander for each district and a\r\nsubordinate called a field cornet for each subdivision of a district.\r\nThese officers and their respective commands became permanent features\r\nof the system of local government, and the war bands—called\r\ncommandos—have always been recognized in the records of military\r\noperations by the Boers.\r\n\r\nThe administration, through a governor and council appointed by the\r\nDutch East India Company in Holland, was never popular with the\r\ncolonists. The governor was in no sense responsible to the people he\r\ngoverned. This was one of the causes which prompted the Boers to go out\r\ninto the wilderness, where distance from the center of authority\r\nsecured to them greater freedom.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 the disaffected colonists sent commissioners to Holland to\r\ndemand of the States-General redress of the grievances suffered under\r\nthe rule of the Dutch East India Company and a share in the government\r\nof the colony. This action was due, in part, to actual wrongs inflicted\r\non a liberty-loving people, and, in part, to the spirit of independence\r\nwhich characterized the temper of the age and had led the British\r\ncolonists in North America to throw off the control of their mother\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAfter prolonged negotiations the States-General sent out two\r\ncommissioners to investigate the state of affairs in the Cape colony\r\nand to recommend measures of reform. The degree of relief proposed was\r\nconsidered inadequate—especially by those who dwelt in the more distant\r\nsettlements. Therefore, in 1795, the people of the interior rose up in\r\nrevolt against the Company’s government—professing, however, unabated\r\nloyalty to the mother country. The magistrates appointed by the company\r\nwere deposed, and little republics were set up, each with a\r\nrepresentative assembly. It would have been an easy matter for the\r\ngovernment at the Cape to have suppressed these uprisings by cutting\r\noff their food supplies. But just then other events claimed the\r\nattention of both the governor and the governed—events which drew South\r\nAfrica into the tumultuous tide of European politics and led to the\r\nimmediate contact of Boer and Briton, and initiated a struggle between\r\nthe two which has been renewed at intervals, with varying fortunes, for\r\nmore than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nBefore going forward to the event of 1795—the first contact of Boer and\r\nBriton—it will be well to note some of the more important features of\r\nthe condition in which that contact found the Boer.\r\n\r\nThe total Boer population of South Africa in 1795 was about seventeen\r\nthousand, with a rapid rate of increase. In the mixed blood of the\r\npeople the proportions of national elements were: Dutch, a little less\r\nthan two-thirds; French, one-sixth; the remainder was principally\r\nGerman, with a sprinkling of other nationalities.\r\n\r\nThe popular language differed largely from that of Holland at the close\r\nof the eighteenth century. The amalgamation with a large body of\r\nforeigners, the scant instruction in book learning, and above all the\r\nnecessity of speaking to the slaves and Hottentots in the simplest\r\nmanner possible had all tended to the destruction of grammatical forms.\r\nThe language in common use by the Boer had become a mere dialect,\r\nhaving a very limited vocabulary. But the Dutch Bible—a book that every\r\none read—greatly increased the number of words with which he was\r\nfamiliar. With this addition, however, most of the uneducated South\r\nAfrican colonists were unable to understand fully the contents of a\r\nnewspaper of the time printed in Holland, or a book treating of a\r\nsubject unfamiliar to them. Naturally this dialect of the Dutch was\r\ngreatly beloved by the people using it—it was the language of mother,\r\nof lover, of friend to friend in parting to meet no more.\r\n\r\nIn no other country were women more completely on an equality with men\r\nthan in South Africa. Property belonging to a woman while she was\r\nsingle, or acquired by her after marriage, was secured to her in\r\nperpetuity so that her husband could neither squander it nor dispose of\r\nit in any way without her consent. Neither was it subject to seizure\r\nfor debts contracted by him, but was as absolutely hers as if no\r\nmarriage existed.\r\n\r\nThe rights of children to be provided for were sacredly guarded. An\r\nindividual having five or more children could only dispose by will of\r\nhalf the estate; the remainder belonged to the children, and upon the\r\ndeath of the parent it was equally divided among them; if any were\r\nminors their share was taken in trust for them by guardians provided by\r\nlaw. If there were not more than four children the parent could dispose\r\nby will of two-thirds of the estate.\r\n\r\nThe industrial pursuits of the people outside of Cape Town were almost\r\nentirely agricultural and pastoral. There were no mining interests.\r\nThere was abundance of fish, but the taking of them was discouraged by\r\ngovernment prohibitions of fishing in any waters but Table Bay in\r\nsummer and False Bay in winter. This measure was taken to save the\r\nCompany the expense of providing military protection for fishermen at a\r\ndistance from the fort. In 1718 it was permitted to fish in Saldanha\r\nBay, also, but as one-fifth of the product was exacted as a tax the\r\nlicense was not accepted.\r\n\r\nThe making of wagons and carts of the peculiar kind needed in Africa at\r\nthat time was carried to great perfection. This, however, was the only\r\nimportant manufacturing industry in the country. For the most part\r\nfamilies supplied themselves with homemade articles of use, such as\r\nsoap, candles, furniture, leather, cloth, harness and farming\r\nimplements. Everything thus produced was crude and clumsy, but the\r\narticles were durable and served the purpose fairly well.\r\n\r\nAll in all, they were a worthy and a very peculiar people—these Boers.\r\nThey differed largely from all others in habits, language and ideals;\r\nbut they were loyal to their ideals, and acted with rare good sense and\r\nmanly energy in carrying them into effect. They were so far free from\r\nthe prevailing spirit of religious bigotry that in 1795, besides the\r\nDutch Reformed Church—in a sense the national church—the Lutheran and\r\nthe Moravian denominations were tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe territory in South Africa that had been explored, up to 1795,\r\nincluded the Cape colony, the western coast as far north as Walfish\r\nBay, the eastern coast to the Zambesi River and the Zambesi Valley to a\r\npoint above Tete, and a few localities in the region now known as\r\nRhodesia. Possibly some roving elephant hunters had crossed the Orange\r\nRiver, but, if so, they were silent as to any discoveries made.\r\n\r\nThe Bushmen had retired from the populous parts of the Colony, and were\r\nnumerous only along the mountain range in the interior. The Hottentots\r\nhad dwindled away to a few thousand. The thinning out of these native\r\nraces was due not so much to mortal conflict with the whites as to the\r\nravages of smallpox and strong drink. Like all savage people they\r\nseemed to melt away before these scourges as stubble before flames.\r\n\r\nAnd here we close this chapter of the history of the Boers. We leave\r\nthem, for the moment, divided as to the government of the Dutch East\r\nIndia Company, but a homogeneous people seventeen thousand strong, and\r\nhaving developed out of the elements mixed in their blood and the\r\npeculiar environment and experiences in which they lived a new race of\r\ncivilized men to be known in the history of commerce, diplomacy and war\r\nas Africanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFIRST CONTACT OF AFRICANDER AND BRITON IN DIPLOMACY.\r\n\r\n(1795.)\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Robert Jacob Gordon was in chief command of all the regular\r\nmilitary forces maintained in the Cape colony. These consisted of a\r\nregiment of infantry numbering twenty-five officers and five hundred\r\nand forty-six rank and file, an artillery corps mustering twenty-seven\r\nofficers and four hundred and three rank and file, fifty-seven men\r\nstationed at the regimental depots Meuron and Württemberg and a corps\r\nof mountaineer soldiers, called pandours, numbering two hundred and\r\nten.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that at this time the colonists were\r\ndivided in sentiment as to the government of the Dutch East India\r\nCompany, but united in loyalty to the States-General and the\r\nStadtholder of Holland. In the interior the people had risen up in a\r\nmild revolt, had dismissed the local magistrates who were the\r\nappointees of the Company, and had instituted incipient republics under\r\nthe government of representative assemblies. Even in Stellenbosch and\r\nCape Town the majority sympathized with these movements, and only\r\nwaited a favorable opportunity to declare against the Company’s rule.\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to know that the military, also, were divided\r\nin sentiment on this subject. Of the infantry, the officers were loyal\r\nto the Orange party, but the rank and file were mercenaries from nearly\r\nevery country in the north of Europe, and were zealous for that party\r\nor nation from whom they could draw the highest pay. The artillery\r\ncorps, on the contrary, was composed almost entirely of Netherlanders,\r\nwith a few French and Germans. These men were attached to the mother\r\ncountry. A large majority of them, however, sympathized with the\r\nrepublican movement in Europe, and would have preferred alliance with\r\nthe French rather than with the English, for, at that time, the lead of\r\nFrance was toward republicanism.\r\n\r\nThus weakened by internal divisions, the Colony presented an open door\r\nto invasion by any power that might covet a point of so great strategic\r\nimportance on the ocean thoroughfare between Europe and the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe English government, when about to enter into hostilities with\r\nFrance, became apprehensive that the French would perceive the value of\r\nthe Cape colony and instantly take forcible possession of it. This they\r\ndetermined to prevent at any cost; for the military occupancy of the\r\nCape by the French would bring England’s highway to India under the\r\ncontrol of her hereditary foe.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 2d of February, 1793, negotiations were opened between\r\nthe British government and the Dutch home and colonial authorities\r\nconcerning a strengthening of the garrison at the Cape by a contingent\r\nof British troops from St. Helena. The States-General and the Dutch\r\nEast India Company, in response to this proposal, signified their\r\ndesire for aid in the form of warships to guard the coast of the Cape\r\npeninsula, and that in case such assistance could not be given they\r\nwould accept the offered troops.\r\n\r\nWhile this correspondence was going on events were transpiring that\r\noccasioned ill-feeling between the Dutch and the English, although they\r\nwere in alliance against the French. Being paralyzed by dissensions\r\namong their own people, the States-General made urgent appeals to the\r\nBritish government for more efficient aid in both men and money. To\r\nthese appeals the answer of the English authorities was a bitter\r\ncomplaint that their troops were already bearing the brunt of the war\r\nin defense of the Netherlands, and that the Stadtholder and his\r\ngovernment were not making proper exertions to raise men and money at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIn making such answer, the British ministers seemed to be willfully\r\nblind to the prostrate condition of the Dutch government. The French\r\nhad put the army of invasion under the command of Pichegru, one of the\r\nablest generals of his time. One after another the Dutch strongholds\r\nwere falling before him. The province of Friesland was threatening to\r\nmake a separate peace with France if the States-General did not hasten\r\nto act in that direction for all Holland. The patriot party felt such\r\nantipathy to their English allies that it was difficult to get hospital\r\naccommodation in Dutch towns for the wounded British soldiers. And\r\nnotwithstanding all these circumstances the English authorities\r\nasserted that the Stadtholder’s failure to put in the field a large and\r\nwell-equipped force was due to apathy in his own cause rather than to\r\nweakness. The one measure of additional help offered was that if the\r\nDutch government would furnish five hundred to a thousand troops for\r\nthe better defense of Cape Colony the English East India Company would\r\ntransport them thither free of charge. It being impossible for the\r\nDutch to furnish the men, the negotiations came to an end.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as was signified in the attitude of Friesland, the Dutch\r\npeople were considering the question of changing sides in the war. That\r\nfact—without the knowledge of the Stadtholder—was informally\r\ncommunicated to the governor of Cape Colony in a letter written by the\r\nchief advocate of the Dutch East India Company, with the approbation of\r\nthe directors. The letter reached the Cape on the 7th of February,\r\n1795, informing the colonists that in all probability Holland might\r\nsoon dissolve the alliance with the English and make common cause with\r\nFrance. The letter stated that matters at home were in an uncertain\r\ncondition; that the French armies were advancing and already had\r\noccupied a part of the country, and that it would be necessary to be\r\nvigilant so as not to be surprised by any European power. The warning,\r\nthough not specific as to what power, evidently referred to England.\r\n\r\nLater reports informed the colonists that a French army under Pichegru\r\nwas besieging Breda and threatening the region across the Maas. But\r\nthese reports were not in the nature of official dispatches. They were\r\ncommunicated verbally by Captain Dekker of the frigate Medemblik, which\r\narrived at the Cape on the 12th of April, 1795.\r\n\r\nThe next intelligence from Europe was calculated to perplex and alarm\r\nthe colonists to a high degree. On the 11th of June, 1795, successive\r\nreports came by messengers from Simonstown to the castle to the effect\r\nthat several ships of unknown nationality were beating into False Bay;\r\nlater that the ships had cast anchor, and at ten in the evening that\r\nCaptain Dekker had sent a boat to one of the stranger ships to\r\nascertain particulars, directing the lieutenant in charge to wave a\r\nflag if he found them friendly, and that no such signal had been made,\r\nnor had the boat returned.\r\n\r\nThe situation so suddenly developed was, to say the least, disturbing.\r\nThe governor called his council together to consider it. After\r\nconference the signals of danger were made summoning the Burghers of\r\nthe country districts to Cape Town. Lieutenant-Colonel De Lille was\r\nordered to proceed at once to Simonstown with two hundred infantry and\r\na hundred gunners to strengthen the garrison there. The troops left the\r\ncastle within an hour and reached Simonstown before noon of the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe council continued in session until past midnight, and after\r\nadjournment remained at the castle in readiness to deal with any\r\nemergency that might arise. At half-past two in the morning of the 12th\r\nthey were called together again to consider a letter just received from\r\nSimonstown. The communication was from Mr. Brand, the official resident\r\nat Simonstown, and contained interesting news. Captain Dekker’s boat\r\nhad returned from its long visit to the strange fleet. With it had come\r\na Mr. Ross, bearing letters for the head of the Cape government from\r\nthe English admiral, Sir George Keith Elphinstone and Major-General\r\nJames Henry Craig.\r\n\r\nMr. Ross, having been supplied with a horse and a guide, reached the\r\ncastle and delivered the letters in due time. They proved to be three\r\ncomplimentary notes from directors of the English East India Company to\r\nCommissioner Sluysken, governor of the colony. Mr. Ross also presented\r\nan invitation from Admiral Elphinstone to the Commissioner and Colonel\r\nGordon to visit his ship, intimating that there they would receive\r\nimportant information and a missive from the Stadtholder of the\r\nNetherlands. It was noted that in the conversation Mr. Ross was careful\r\nto evade all questions concerning the state of affairs in Europe and\r\nthe destination and business of the fleet.\r\n\r\nWhile the council pondered these things, Lieutenant Van Vegezak, who\r\nhad visited the English admiral’s ship, arrived at the castle. He had\r\nlittle information to impart. There were in the fleet three\r\nseventy-four gun ships, three of sixty-four guns each, a frigate of\r\ntwenty-four guns, two sloops of war carrying the one eighteen and the\r\nother sixteen guns; and there were troops on board under the command of\r\nMajor-General James Henry Craig, but how many he had not been able to\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\nNow, the facts which accounted for the presence at the Cape of this\r\nBritish naval and military force were unknown to the colonists. The\r\nStadtholder’s government had been overthrown. The democratic party in\r\nHolland had received the French with open arms. The national government\r\nhad been remodeled. The States-General had abolished the\r\nStadtholderate. And the British ministers, alarmed for their vast\r\npossessions in India, and realizing that they must now depend upon\r\ntheir own exertions to keep the French from seizing the port which\r\npractically commanded the sea route thither, had fitted out and\r\ndispatched with all haste this expedition, with orders to\r\noccupy—peacefully if they could, but forcibly if they must—the castle\r\nand harbor of Cape Town. The fleet had made a rapid passage. One\r\ndivision sailed on the 13th of March, the other on the 3d of April. The\r\ntwo squadrons met off the Cape on the 10th of June and on the 11th cast\r\nanchor in False Bay.\r\n\r\nThe colonial officers acted with marvelous caution, considering the\r\nfact that they were in ignorance of the late events which had led to\r\nthe appearing of this formidable expedition in South African waters.\r\n\r\nTo the note inviting the commissioner and Colonel Gordon to visit the\r\nEnglish admiral on his ship, they courteously replied that it was\r\nimpossible for these officers to leave Cape Town, and begged the\r\nadmiral to send ashore a responsible representative with the promised\r\ninformation and dispatch. They also instructed the resident at\r\nSimonstown to permit the English to provision their ships, but to allow\r\nno armed men to land. A force of eighty-four Burghers and thirty\r\ngunners, with three field pieces, was posted at Muizenburg in a\r\nposition to command the road to Simonstown. On the 13th of June the\r\ndefensive works of Simonstown Bay were strengthened by additional\r\ntroops, and three hundred and forty infantry and artillerymen were sent\r\nto further strengthen the post at Muizenburg.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of June there came to the castle a deputation from the\r\nAdmiral, consisting of Lieutenant-Colonel McKenzie, Captain Hardy of\r\nthe sloop Echo and Mr. Ross, secretary to General Craig.\r\n\r\nMr. Ross handed to Commissioner Sluysken a communication from the\r\nprince of Orange—late the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, and supposed\r\nto be so still by the colonists. The prince’s mandate, dated at Kew on\r\nthe 7th of February, 1795, ordered the Commissioner to admit the troops\r\nof the King of England into the colony and the forts thereof and to\r\nadmit the British ships of war into the ports, and to treat the British\r\ntroops and ships of war as the forces of a power friendly to Holland\r\nand sent to protect the colony against the French.\r\n\r\nThe deputation from the admiral also delivered to the Commissioner a\r\njoint letter from Admiral Elphinstone and General Craig, in which was\r\nwritten their account of the then condition of affairs in the\r\nNetherlands. They informed him that the winter in Europe had been\r\nexceptionally severe; that toward the close of January the rivers had\r\nbeen frozen so hard as to make them passable for armies; that the\r\nFrench had crossed on the ice into Utrecht and Gelderland and had\r\ndriven the English troops into Germany and compelled the Dutch forces\r\nto surrender. They represented that it was a matter of only a few days\r\nfor the whole of the country to fall into the possession of the French\r\nby forced capitulation, without any previous terms of surrender, and\r\nthat the Stadtholder only escaped capture by taking passage in a\r\nfishing boat, which carried him from Scheveningen to England. They\r\nfurther intimated to the Commissioner that this gloomy state of things\r\nwas only temporary; that Britain and her allies were preparing to enter\r\nthe field with overwhelming force, and were confident of being able to\r\ndrive the French out of Holland in the next campaign.\r\n\r\nThe letter stopped short of full particulars, leaving the colonial\r\nauthorities in ignorance of the cordial welcome given to the French by\r\nthe democratic party in Holland, and of the remodeling of the national\r\ngovernment and the abolition of the Stadtholderate. The impression the\r\nBritish officers sought to make was that Holland had been overrun and\r\nconquered, and was being treated with the utmost rigor by the French.\r\nThey carefully withheld the facts that the remodeled government of the\r\nNetherlands was still in existence and that the French were regarded as\r\nfriends by a majority of the people. They wished the colonists to\r\nbelieve that the Prince of Orange was still the Stadtholder of the\r\nNetherlands, though temporarily a fugitive in England; that he would be\r\nreinstated by the help of his faithful allies in the next campaign, and\r\nthat loyalty to his prince required the Commissioner of the Cape Colony\r\nto throw open the ports and the forts of the colony to the friendly\r\noccupation of the British forces.\r\n\r\nThe council decided that no immediate action should be taken on the\r\nprince’s mandatory letter. It was the command of a fugitive in a\r\nforeign land and lacked the indorsement of the States-General, and,\r\ntherefore, had no official force. They were loyal to the House of\r\nOrange, but they felt that any present action would be taken in\r\nignorance of the true state of affairs. There was nothing to guide them\r\nbut this letter of their fugitive prince and the word of these armed\r\nand interested visitors who sought to occupy their harbors and\r\nstrongholds at once. They decided to temporize as far as they could\r\nwithout giving the strangers peaceable possession, hoping that more\r\ncomplete and reliable intelligence from the Netherlands would reach\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe council’s answer to Admiral Elphinstone is an example of rare\r\ndiplomatic acumen. It assured him that the fleet would be permitted to\r\ntake in all necessary provisions, but requested that in doing so only\r\nsmall bodies of unarmed men be sent ashore. It also expressed gratitude\r\nto the British government for its evident goodwill, and intimated that,\r\nwhile confident of their ability to resist any attack that might be\r\nmade, they would ask the British for assistance in case the French\r\nshould attempt to seize the colony. It further requested the admiral to\r\ninform the council what number of troops he could furnish, if any were\r\nneeded. The admiral replied that General Craig would visit the\r\nCommissioner in Cape Town and impart fuller information. Meanwhile the\r\narrival of Burgher forces from Stellenbosch enabled the council to add\r\ntwo hundred horsemen to the post at Muizenburg.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of June General Craig met the Commissioner at Cape Town.\r\nThe next day the general was introduced to the council, and laid before\r\nthe members the mission upon which he had been sent and his\r\ninstructions as to the manner of accomplishing it. He stated that the\r\nfleet and the troops had been sent by his Britannic Majesty to defend\r\nthe colony against seizure by the French, or any other power, and that\r\nthe British occupancy was intended to last only until the government in\r\nthe Netherlands could be restored to its ancient form, when it was his\r\nMajesty’s purpose to give up the colony to its proper rulers—the\r\nStadtholder and the States-General of Holland. He assured them that no\r\nchanges would be made in the laws and customs of the country, nor would\r\nany additional taxes be levied without the expressed desire of the\r\npeople. The colonists would be required to bear no cost but that of\r\ntheir own government as it then existed, and they would be at liberty\r\nto profit largely by trade with England’s possessions in India. The\r\ncolonial troops would be paid by England, on condition that they take\r\nan oath of allegiance to his Britannic Majesty—the obligation thereof\r\nto last only as long as the British occupancy of the colony. The civil\r\nservice would remain as it was, and the present incumbents retain their\r\noffices until his Majesty’s pleasure should be made known.\r\n\r\nTo this proposal the council made answer in writing, declining it, and\r\nnotifying the general that they would protect the colony with their own\r\nforces against all comers.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Elphinstone and General Craig responded to this act of the\r\ncouncil by a general proclamation to the government and inhabitants of\r\nthe country, inviting and requiring them to accept his Britannic\r\nMajesty’s protection in view of the certainty that the French would\r\nendeavor to seize the colonial dependencies of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThree days later the same officers published an address to the\r\ninhabitants, in Dutch and German, renewing the offer of protection\r\nunder the conditions laid before the council by General Craig, and\r\ninviting them to send a committee of their own selection to Simonstown\r\nto confer with the heads of the British expedition. The address\r\nemphasized the alternative before the people—a French or an English\r\noccupation. The former, it affirmed, would introduce a government on\r\nJacobin principles, and would result in anarchy, the guillotine, an\r\ninsurrection of the slaves with all the horrors that had been enacted\r\nat St. Domingo and Guadeloupe, isolation from Europe, the destruction\r\nof commerce and a dearth of money and of the necessaries of life. But\r\nthe English occupation, it went on to say, would give them safety under\r\nthe wing of the only power in Europe that was able to assure protection\r\nof person and property under the existing laws, or any others the\r\ncolonists might choose to enact; it would secure a free market for all\r\ntheir products at the best prices; it would release their trade from\r\nthe heavy imposts of the Dutch East India Company; it would open and\r\npromote commerce by sea and land between all parts of the colony, and\r\nit would secure better pay for such of the colonial troops as might\r\nchoose to enter the British military service.\r\n\r\nThis appeal directly to the people over the heads of their chief\r\nofficials, and to the cupidity of their mercenary soldiers, was\r\nresented by the council, who notified the British representatives\r\nforthwith that further communication on the subject of British\r\noccupancy was not desired.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the 26th of June, the admiral and the general sent the\r\ncolonial authorities another long letter, reiterating therein their\r\nformer statements to the effect that the Netherlands had been absorbed\r\nby France; that if left to itself the Cape colony would be absorbed in\r\nlike manner, and adding the significant intimation that his Britannic\r\nMajesty could not allow it to fall into the hands of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe council responded to this letter by prohibiting any further supply\r\nof provisions to the British force, and strengthening the post at\r\nMuizenburg with Burgher horsemen, pandours and the entire garrison from\r\nBoetselaar except one man; he was left to spike the guns in case the\r\nEnglish should land. The council also wrote the British commanders that\r\nthey noted the difference between proffered assistance against an\r\ninvader and a demand to surrender the colony to the British government.\r\n\r\nWhen the real design of the English was revealed, the disaffected\r\nBurghers of the Cape and of Stellenbosch ceased all opposition to the\r\ngovernment, and offered to do their utmost in defense of the colony.\r\nWhen the Commissioner announced that the country would not be\r\nsurrendered to the English, the people cheered him rapturously in the\r\nstreets, and saluted him as Father Sluysken.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these outward signs of unity the high officials and\r\nthe people were not quite of one mind. A majority of the Burghers had\r\nadopted republican ideas, and, if they were to be left to themselves,\r\nwere ready to welcome the French. Such English visitors as had come to\r\nthe Cape had exasperated the colonists by boastfully predicting the\r\nultimate subjection of the colony to Great Britain. The Burghers\r\nbelieved that they had now come in the guise of friendship to make good\r\nthe insulting prediction. On the other hand, the official heads of the\r\ncolony were lukewarm in doing what they knew and admitted to be their\r\nduty for the defense of the colony. Colonel Gordon openly expressed his\r\nreadiness to admit the English troops whenever the French should\r\nthreaten an attack. He went so far as to say that even in existing\r\ncircumstances he would admit them if they would covenant to hold the\r\ncountry for the Prince of Orange, but if their purpose was to take\r\npossession of it for Great Britain he would resist them to the utmost\r\nof his power. The colonel was a disappointment to the English, for they\r\nhad counted upon the Scotch strain in his blood and his well-known\r\nOrange partisanship to bring him over to their designs at the first.\r\n\r\nThus three lines of cleavage militated against the perfect solidarity\r\nof the colonists. A majority of the Burghers were prepared to resist\r\nthe British because they preferred the French, if there must be a\r\nchange of masters. Most of the lower officials and some of the town\r\nBurghers were ready to accept the British occupancy, and went about\r\nsinging Orange party songs because they believed the English were\r\nsincere in professing that it was their sole purpose to hold the colony\r\nin trust for the Prince of Orange. As for Commissioner Sluysken and\r\nColonel Gordon, while it was their duty to defend the Cape interests\r\nagainst any power that sought to subvert the rule of the Stadtholder\r\nand the States-General of Holland, they were not quite sure of the\r\ncourse they ought to pursue with reference to the English, who had come\r\nto them professing loyal friendship to the fugitive prince and\r\naccredited to them by his mandatory letter. There was possible treason\r\nin either admitting or resisting them. These circumstances account for\r\nsome lack of energy on the part of the civil and the military heads of\r\nthe colony in defending it against the British attack that was soon to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFIRST CONTACT OF AFRICANDER AND BRITON IN WAR.\r\n\r\n(1795.)\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the end of June, 1795, it became evident that the British\r\ncommanders, having failed to obtain peaceable possession of the Cape\r\ncolony, meant to use all the force necessary to carry out their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, three Dutch merchant ships lying in Simon’s Bay\r\nreceived instruction from Commissioner Sluysken to proceed to Table\r\nBay, but Admiral Elphinstone forbade them to sail. On the 28th of June,\r\ntwo small vessels sailing under American colors anchored in Simon’s\r\nBay. One of these—the Columbia—carried Dutch dispatches from Amsterdam\r\nto the Cape and Batavia. The English admiral promptly placed the\r\nColumbia under guard and seized her mails. Such letters and dispatches\r\nas related to public affairs were either suppressed or mutilated, and\r\nmeasures were taken to prevent newspapers from reaching the shore. A\r\nsingle paper, however, was smuggled into the hands of a Burgher, and\r\nwas the means of conveying astonishing news to the colonists. The most\r\nstartling of its contents was an official notice by the States-General\r\nof Holland, under date of the 4th of March, 1795, absolving from their\r\noaths of allegiance to the Prince of Orange all his former subjects,\r\nboth in the Netherlands and in the Dutch colonies.\r\n\r\nFrom this notice and from hints left in mutilated letters to private\r\nindividuals it was learned that so far from being a conquered country\r\nunder the heel of a rigorous French military administration, Holland\r\nwas a free and independent republic; that the Stadtholderate had been\r\nabolished by the free-will action of the nation, and that France was in\r\nfriendly diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic.\r\n\r\nThereupon, the Commissioner and his council determined that it was\r\ntheir duty to hold out against the English. They reasoned that, should\r\nthe colonial forces be overpowered in the end, the Netherlands would\r\nhave a better claim to the restoration of the country when peace should\r\nbe made than would exist if the protection of Great Britain had been\r\naccepted without a struggle. They saw a bare possibility that the\r\nBritish force might be starved into departure by refusing to furnish\r\nthem with provisions. Moreover, aid from Europe might then be on the\r\nway and might reach them in time to save the colony to Holland. In any\r\ncase, they judged, there was nothing to lose in opposing the British\r\nbut the control of the colony, whereas, they might lose their heads as\r\ntraitors should a combined Dutch and French fleet arrive and they be\r\nfound to have surrendered to the British without a show of resistance.\r\nThey decided that both duty and personal interest required them to make\r\nwhat preparation they could for defense.\r\n\r\nBy order of the council, on the night of the 29th of June, Simonstown\r\nwas abandoned as untenable. All the provisions there were destroyed,\r\nthe guns were spiked, such ammunition as could not be carried away was\r\nthrown into the sea and the troops joined the force at Muizenburg. Not\r\nbeing able to evade the ships blockading Table Bay, the council\r\nchartered a cutter then lying at anchor in Saldanha Bay and sent her\r\nwith dispatches to Batavia informing the Dutch colonists there of the\r\nstate of things both at the Cape and in Holland.\r\n\r\nWhen the call to assemble at the Cape was signaled to the country\r\nBurghers, only seventy men from the Swellendam district responded. The\r\nnationals, who had been in revolt against the Dutch East India\r\nCompany’s government, declined to obey. Further appeals by letter\r\nfailed to bring any more of them in. At last, on the 7th of July, in a\r\nwritten communication, it was proposed by the nationals that they would\r\nrally to the defense of the country if the government would grant them\r\namnesty for the past and pledge a reasonable redress of their\r\ngrievances as soon as possible. Among the principal stipulations were\r\nthese: The nationalists were to be exempted from direct taxation and to\r\nhave free trade; the cartoon money—a depreciated currency—was to be\r\nwithdrawn from circulation, and they were to be granted permission to\r\nhold in perpetual slavery all Bushmen captured by commandos or\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe nationals had no sooner dispatched the letter containing their\r\noverture than it occurred to some of them that their claims would\r\nsurely be ignored if the British obtained control of the colony.\r\nTherefore, without waiting for a response from the government, they\r\nresolved to aid in the defense of the country, and at the same time\r\ncontinue to assert their right to self-government. In accordance\r\ntherewith a company of one hundred and sixty-eight mounted men was\r\norganized under Commandant Delpont and at once set out for Cape Town.\r\n\r\nThe rally from the country districts of Swellendam, Stellenbosch and\r\nDrakenstein brought together a force of eleven hundred and forty\r\nhorsemen. Two hundred of these were added to the post at Muizenburg.\r\nThe rest were stationed at Cape Town and along the road to the camp as\r\npickets.\r\n\r\nHostile operations came on very slowly. Admiral Elphinstone seized\r\nthree more Dutch merchant ships that were lying in Simon’s Bay on the\r\n9th of July. On the 14th he landed four hundred and fifty soldiers, who\r\noccupied Simonstown, and strengthened the post a week later by adding\r\nfour hundred marines.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, neither the English commanders nor Commissioner\r\nSluysken chose to regard these movements as acts of war. The\r\nCommissioner had been careful to order that no attack should be made on\r\nthe English, and that nothing whatever should be done that would\r\nprovoke retaliation or furnish grounds for them to throw the blame of\r\nopening hostilities on the Dutch. It was not until the 3d of August\r\nthat any act was committed which was by either party construed into an\r\nact of war. On that day a Burgher officer fired at an English picket\r\nand wounded one of the men. For this he was reprimanded by the\r\nCommissioner. General Craig reported it in his dispatches as the\r\nbeginning of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe time soon came when the British officers thought an advance might\r\nbe made. The Dutch had been remiss in not strengthening their earthwork\r\ndefenses toward the sea. They had permitted English boats to take\r\nsoundings off Muizenburg unmolested. And the English commanders had\r\nbeen encouraged to hope that the nationals in the colonial force did\r\nnot intend to seriously oppose the British advance—that in all\r\nprobability they would come over in a body to the British side as soon\r\nas the first engagement opened. On the other hand, the invading army\r\nwas utterly without field guns and could not muster more than sixteen\r\nhundred men. Re-enforcements were on the way, but no one could foretell\r\nthe time of their arrival. To advance any part of their military force\r\nbeyond the range of the guns on the ships would expose the whole\r\nexpedition to destruction in the event of a French squadron appearing\r\nin Table Bay to co-operate with the Dutch colonists. In view of all the\r\ncircumstances the British commanders determined to capture Muizenburg,\r\nto reopen negotiations with the Cape government from that position and\r\nto attempt no further aggressive movement until the arrival of the\r\nexpected re-enforcements.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 7th of August it became evident to the Dutch\r\nofficers at Muizenburg that the British were about to attack. A column\r\nof sixteen hundred infantry and marines was advancing from Simonstown.\r\nTwo small gunboats, and the ships’ launches, carrying lighter guns,\r\nmoved close in shore about five hundred yards in advance of the column,\r\nto keep the road open. The war vessels America, Stately, Echo and\r\nRattlesnake were heading for Muizen Beach.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch camp was at the foot of the mountain facing False Bay on the\r\nwest, the camp looking south and east, for it was at the northwest\r\nangle of the bay. They had planted eleven pieces of artillery so as to\r\ncommand the road from Simonstown, which ran along the west coast of\r\nFalse Bay. From Kalk Bay to Muizenburg the roadway was narrow, having\r\nthe water on one side and the steep mountain, only a few paces away, on\r\nthe other. The mountain terminates abruptly at Muizenburg, where begin\r\nthe Cape Flats, a sandy plain stretching across from False Bay to Table\r\nBay. Near the north end of the mountain is a considerable sheet of\r\nshallow water called the Sandvlei, fed in the rainy season by an\r\nintermittent brook called Keyser’s River, emptying into the north side\r\nof the vlei.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they came within range of the post at Kalk Bay the British\r\nships opened fire and the picket stationed there retired over the\r\nmountain. On coming abreast of Muizenburg the fleet came to anchor and\r\ndelivered their broadsides at easy range upon the Dutch camp. The\r\nthunders of the first fire had hardly ceased when the national\r\nbattalion of infantry, and a little later the main body thereof, led by\r\nColonel De Lille, fled from the post through the Sandvlei. One company\r\nunder Captain Warneke retired more slowly and in a little better order.\r\nMany of the artillerymen followed, leaving only a single company under\r\nLieutenant Marnitz to work the two twenty-four pounders. These, being\r\nplanted on loose soil, were thrown out of position by the recoil of\r\nevery discharge and could not be fired again until they had been\r\nhandled back into place. The firing was, therefore, slow and with\r\nuncertain aim. Two men were killed, four wounded and one gun disabled\r\non the America, and one man was wounded on the Stately, by Lieutenant\r\nMarnitz’s fire. Whether it was through bad marksmanship or by design\r\none can hardly decide, but the English guns were aimed so high that the\r\nshot passed over the camp and lodged in the mountain behind it. Marnitz\r\nsoon perceived that the post could not be held, and, first spiking the\r\ncannon, retired before the charge of the British column. Nothing was\r\nsaved from the camp but five small field pieces.\r\n\r\nThe English followed the retreating burghers with a cheer. As soon as\r\nthey were out of range of the British ships the Dutch endeavored to\r\nmake a stand, but were quickly driven from it by a bayonet charge.\r\nAfter gaining the shelter of the mountain the Dutch again faced their\r\npursuers, this time with the support of guns brought to bear on the\r\nEnglish from the opposite side of the Sandvlei, and with such effect\r\nthat they fell back to Muizenburg. In this second collision one English\r\nofficer, one burgher and two Dutch artillerymen were killed and one\r\npandour was wounded.\r\n\r\nInstead of rallying his men and making a stand behind the Sandvlei, as\r\nhe might have done with a well-protected front, De Lille continued his\r\nflight to Diep River, where he arrived with a fragment of his command,\r\nnot knowing what had become of his artillerymen and burghers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as news came that the English were advancing, a detachment of\r\nfive hundred burgher horsemen was hastened forward from Cape Town to\r\nMuizenburg. On the way they learned from the fugitives that Muizenburg,\r\nthe camp and everything in it had been taken by the British. Then they\r\nhalted and encamped on the plain in small parties.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the 8th of August, De Lille made some show of rallying\r\nand returned to the head of the Sandvlei leading a part of the infantry\r\nthat had been discomfited the day before. The 8th became a day of\r\ngeneral panic. The English advanced in column to attack De Lille at the\r\nhead of the vlei—wading through water that, in places, came above their\r\nwaists. Notwithstanding the advantage this gave him, De Lille and all\r\nhis command fled precipitately on their approach. As the British issued\r\nfrom the water and pursued them across the plain they observed a party\r\nof burghers coming from behind some sandhills on their flank—the\r\ndetachment that had come from Cape Town and camped on the plain during\r\nthe night. Assuming that the flight of De Lille and the movement of\r\nthis body were in the carrying out of an ambuscade, the British fled,\r\nin their turn, and were pursued by the Dutch until they came under the\r\nfire of their own cannon, spiked and abandoned by Lieutenant Marnitz,\r\nbut drilled and placed in service by General Craig. While the English\r\nwere being driven in by the Cape Town detachment, De Lille and his\r\ncommand fled all day in the opposite direction, and in the evening\r\ncamped within a mile of the camping ground of the night before, near\r\nDiep River.\r\n\r\nDe Lille’s conduct in the field caused widespread indignation. In a\r\nformal document drawn up by a number of burgher officers and forwarded\r\nto the Commissioner, he was charged with treason. The fiscal who\r\ninvestigated the case acquitted De Lille of treason, there being no\r\nproof that he had conspired with the British to betray his trust. And\r\nyet he was neither a coward nor an imbecile. His conduct can be\r\nexplained in no other way than to say that he was a devoted partisan of\r\nthe House of Orange, that he regarded the nationals as traitors to\r\ntheir legitimate ruler and that he believed the English were the loyal\r\nfriends of the rightful sovereign and the ancient government of the\r\nNetherlands. For these reasons he would not fight against the British.\r\nHe held that success in repelling them would result in handing the\r\ncountry over to the colonial national party and to republicanism, which\r\nwould be an offense against the divine rights of the Prince of Orange.\r\nLater he took service with the British and was made barrack master in\r\nCape Town. Thereafter he wore the Orange colors, and openly vented his\r\nabhorrence of all Jacobins—whether French, Dutch or South African.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August the expected British re-enforcements began to\r\narrive. On the 12th Admiral Elphinstone and General Craig wrote the\r\nCommissioner and his council announcing that already they had received\r\nan accession of strength, and that they expected the immediate arrival\r\nof three thousand more soldiers. They also repeated the offer to take\r\nthe Cape colony under British protection on the same terms as were\r\nproffered at first, and added, as a threat, that their men were\r\nbecoming exasperated at the resistance offered and it might become\r\nimpossible to restrain their fury.\r\n\r\nThe letter of the British commanders was laid before the Commissioner’s\r\ncouncil, the councillors representing the country burghers and the\r\nburgher militia; and these were all requested to express their judgment\r\nand their wishes freely. With a single exception they were unanimous in\r\nadopting a resolution declaring that the colony ought to be and would\r\nbe defended to the last. In accordance therewith the Commissioner\r\ntransmitted to the British officers the decision of the people,\r\nnotifying them that the colony would still be defended.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the brave front thus presented to the invaders,\r\ninfluences were at work which tended toward the rapid disintegration of\r\nthe burgher forces. It was being rumored among them that the Bushmen\r\nwere threatening the interior, and that the Hottentots in Swellendam,\r\nand the slaves in Stellenbosch and Drakenstein, were about to rise in\r\nrevolt. True or false, these alarming rumors caused many burghers to\r\nforsake the ranks and go to the protection of their homes and their\r\nfamilies. In July the burgher cavalry numbered eleven hundred and\r\nforty; by the first of September it was reduced to nine hundred.\r\nEfforts to keep up the original strength by the enlistment of foreign\r\npandours, native half-breeds and Hottentots were unsuccessful. Only the\r\nburgher infantry, numbering three hundred and fifty, remained\r\nintact—being composed of residents of the town.\r\n\r\nThe colonists were further dispirited by an abortive attempt to capture\r\ncertain English outposts on the Steenberg. The attack was gallantly\r\nmade by the burgher militia and pandours, but being unsupported by\r\nregular troops and field artillery they were repulsed. On the same day\r\nthe pandours mutinied. One hundred and seventy of them marched in a\r\nbody to the castle and made complaint that their families had been\r\nill-treated by the colonists, that their pay was inadequate, that they\r\nwere insulted by abusive remarks, that a bounty of £40 promised them\r\nfor good conduct had not been paid, and that their rations of spirits\r\nwere too small. Commissioner Sluysken so far pacified them with\r\npromises of redress that they returned to the ranks, but from that time\r\nthey were disaffected and sullen, and their service was of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch officers had planned a night attack in force on the British\r\ncamp at Muizenburg. When they were about to attempt it, there arrived,\r\non the 4th of September, a fleet of East Indiamen bringing the main\r\nbody of the British re-enforcements. These consisted of infantry of the\r\nline, engineers and artillerymen, numbering, in all, three thousand\r\ntroops under the command of General Alured Clarke. This had the effect\r\nof so completely discouraging the burgher cavalry that many of them\r\ngave up hope and returned to their homes. By the 14th of September only\r\nfive hundred and twenty-one of this branch of the colonial force\r\nremained in the ranks.\r\n\r\nOnce more, on the 9th of September, the British commanders issued an\r\naddress to the colonists calling upon them to give peaceable admission\r\nto the overwhelming force now at their gates, and warning them that,\r\notherwise, they would take forcible possession. Commissioner Sluysken\r\nreplied, as before, that he would hold and defend the colony for its\r\nrightful owners, for so he was bound to do by his oath of office.\r\n\r\nThe English army in two columns, between four and five thousand strong,\r\nmarched from Muizenburg to attack Cape Town, at 9 o’clock in the\r\nmorning of the 14th of September. This movement was signaled to the\r\ncolonial officers at the Cape, who ordered all the burgher cavalry,\r\nwith the exception of one company, to the support of the regular troops\r\nat Cape Town. A part of the burgher force was sent out to strengthen\r\nthe Dutch camp at Wynberg, about half way from Muizenburg to Cape Town\r\non the route of the British. Some attempt was made to harass the\r\ncolumns on the march, but with so little effect that only one was\r\nkilled and seventeen were wounded.\r\n\r\nMajor Van Baalen, then in command of the regular troops at Wynberg,\r\narranged a line of battle that was faulty in the extreme, and planted\r\nhis cannon in such position that they were practically useless as\r\nweapons of offense against the advancing army. Certain officers of the\r\nartillery and of the burgher militia contingent remonstrated against\r\nhis plan of battle, but it was in vain, and when the English came\r\nwithin gunfire he retreated with the greater part of the regulars. Then\r\nfollowed a scene of confusion. The burghers protested, and cried out\r\nthat they were being betrayed in every battle. One company of infantry\r\nand most of the artillery made a brief stand and then retreated toward\r\nCape Town, leaving the camp and all its belongings to the British.\r\n\r\nIt had now become clear to the burgher cavalry that Commissioner\r\nSluysken, Colonel Gordon, and most of the officers of the regular force\r\nintentionally fought to lose—that so far as the republican government\r\nthen prevailing in Holland was concerned they were traitors at heart,\r\nand that they were willing—after a mere show of resistance—to let the\r\ncolony fall into the hands of the British in order to have it held in\r\ntrust by them for the fugitive prince of Orange. The burghers,\r\ntherefor, not being willing to risk capture or death in battles that\r\nwere not meant to win by those who directed them, dispersed and\r\nreturned to their homes. Meantime a British squadron was threatening\r\nCape Town, but keeping out of range of the castle guns.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner’s council was convened at six o’clock in the evening\r\nof the 14th of September to consider a very serious situation. A\r\nBritish force of over four thousand men, thoroughly disciplined and\r\nequipped, was then in bivouac at Newlands, less than ten miles from\r\nCape Town. The colonial force was only about seventeen hundred strong\r\nand nearly half of these had that day retreated before the enemy\r\nwithout giving battle; the remainder were distributed among the\r\nfortified posts at Hout Bay, Camp’s Bay and Table Valley. If these were\r\nall loyal and united in a determination to fight to the last they would\r\ncertainly be overpowered in the end. But they were not at one in their\r\nloyalty. Some were for the deposed and banished prince of Orange, and\r\ntherefore favorable to the English who professed to be his friends.\r\nOthers were strong in their preference for the new republican\r\ngovernment in the Netherlands. While thus divided in political\r\nsentiments they were without leaders in whom they could place\r\nconfidence. Further effort at defense seemed unjustifiable in view of\r\ncertain defeat, and of the useless destruction of property and life it\r\nwould cause.\r\n\r\nOne member of the council, Mr. Van Reede von Oudtshoorn, stood out\r\nagainst capitulation, offering to take, with the corps of pennists he\r\ncommanded, the brunt of a final battle with the English. The other\r\nmembers were unanimous in deciding to send a flag of truce to the\r\nBritish at Newlands, asking for a suspension of hostilities during the\r\nnext forty-eight hours in order to arrange terms of surrender. General\r\nClarke consented to an armistice of twenty-four hours only, beginning\r\nat midnight on the 14th of September.\r\n\r\nAs a result of conference between the representatives of the Cape\r\ngovernment and the British commanders the following terms of\r\ncapitulation were agreed to: The Dutch troops were to surrender as\r\nprisoners of war, but their officers might remain free in Cape Town or\r\nreturn to Europe on their parole of honor not to serve against Great\r\nBritain during the continuance of hostilities. No new taxes were to be\r\nlevied, and the old imposts were to be reduced as much as possible in\r\norder to revive the decaying trade of the colony. All the belongings of\r\nthe Dutch East India Company were to be handed over to the English, but\r\nprivate rights of property were to be respected. The lands and other\r\nproperties of the Dutch East India Company were to be held in trust by\r\nthe new authorities for the redemption of that portion of the company’s\r\npaper currency which was not secured by mortgage.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 16th of July these terms of surrender were\r\nofficially completed by the signing of the document in which they were\r\nwritten by General Clarke and Admiral Elphinstone. At eleven o’clock on\r\nthat day the council ordered the publication of the articles, and that\r\nofficial notice of what had been done be sent to the heads of\r\ndepartments and other officers in the country districts. Then the\r\ncouncil formally closed its last session and its existence.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial in connection with the capitulation took place at three\r\no’clock in the afternoon of Wednesday, the 16th of September, 1795.\r\nTwelve hundred British infantry and two hundred artillerymen under\r\ncommand of General Craig drew up on the open grounds in front of the\r\ncastle. The Dutch troops marched out of their late stronghold with\r\ncolors flying and drums beating, passed by the British line, laid down\r\ntheir arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. Some of them did so in\r\ngreat bitterness of soul, muttering and calling down curses upon\r\nCommissioner Sluysken and Colonel Gordon for having betrayed and\r\ndisgraced them. Lieutenant Marnitz, in writing of these events,\r\nemphasized the fact that the only occasion on which the head of the\r\ncolonial military establishment, Colonel Gordon, drew his sword in the\r\nconflict with the English was when he gave the order for the troops he\r\nhad commanded to lay down their arms.\r\n\r\nThus it was, after an almost bloodless war, that Cape Colony, founded\r\nby the Dutch and governed continuously by the Netherlands for one\r\nhundred and forty-three years, passed into the possession of Great\r\nBritain and became a crown colony thereof. The charges made by some\r\nthat Commissioner Sluysken and Colonel Gordon were either imbeciles or\r\ntraitors may not be quite in accordance with the facts. Certainly there\r\nis a wide disparity between the always strong and defiant words in\r\nwhich they announced, to the last moment, their determination to defend\r\nthe colony, and the puerile efforts they made to do so. The only\r\nrational explanation of their conduct is that they preferred yielding\r\nto the British, after making a show of resistance, to accepting in the\r\ncolony the new regime of republicanism that prevailed in the mother\r\ncountry. In all probability their secret thought was that by prolonging\r\na nominal resistance they might gain time enough for something to occur\r\nin Europe—where events were moving with bewildering rapidity—something\r\nthat would reinstate the Prince of Orange as Stadtholder of the\r\nNetherlands, and so leave the British no pretext for seizing the colony\r\nin his interest.\r\n\r\nThis chapter may fittingly close with a few brief records of events\r\nthat lead up to the first trek northwards of the Africanders.\r\n\r\nThe Cape colony was restored to the Dutch on the conclusion of the\r\npeace of Amiens, in 1802. When war broke out afresh in Europe, in 1806,\r\nthe English again seized the Cape to prevent Napoleon from occupying so\r\nimportant a naval station and half-way house to the British possessions\r\nin India. The second seizure was accomplished after a single engagement\r\nwith the Dutch. In 1814 the colony was formally ceded to the British\r\ncrown together with certain Dutch possessions in South America, by the\r\nreinstated Stadtholder of the Netherlands, who received in return\r\ntherefor a money consideration of thirty million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICANDERS’ FIRST TREK TO THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n1806–1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the British took forcible possession of the Cape colony a second\r\ntime, in 1806, they found a total population of 74,000. Of these 17,000\r\nwere native Hottentots, 30,000 were slaves of African, Asiatic and\r\nmixed blood, and 27,000 were of European descent—mostly Dutch, with a\r\nsprinkling of German and French. Nearly all spoke the dialect of\r\nHolland Dutch, into which the speech of a people so mixed and so\r\nisolated had degenerated.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the second English regime there was a fair promise\r\nof peace and of the gradual fusion of the Africander and the English\r\nelements in a homogeneous people. The Dutch, from whom the Africanders\r\nwere principally descended, and the English were cognate nations.\r\nThough separated as to national life and history by fourteen centuries,\r\nthey possessed the same fundamental principles that give tone to\r\ncharacter—the two languages were so far alike that the one people found\r\nit easy to learn the speech of the other; they both loved liberty, and\r\nthey both held the Protestant faith. On the surface of things there was\r\nevery reason to expect that the common features in blood, language,\r\npolitical ideals and religion would lead to kindly intercourse,\r\nintermarriages, and a thorough blending of the two races in one.\r\n\r\nThe first few years of experience seemed to strengthen this promise of\r\ngood into certainty. Two successive British governors were men of\r\nrighteousness and wisdom. The restrictions upon trade imposed by the\r\nDutch East India Company were removed. Schools were founded. Measures\r\nwere taken to improve the breed of horses and cattle. The trade in\r\nslaves was forbidden, and missionaries were sent among the natives. The\r\nadministration of this period was careful to leave untouched as far as\r\npossible the local institutions, the official use of the Dutch\r\nlanguage, and the Dutch-Roman law, which had become the common law of\r\nall civilized South Africa, both Dutch and English.\r\n\r\nUnder these favoring influences the two peoples became friendly and\r\nbegan to intermarry. In 1820 the British government promoted emigration\r\nfrom England and Scotland to South Africa, to the extent of about five\r\nthousand. From that time there was a steady increase of the population\r\nfrom Great Britain, and to a much smaller extent from Germany, France\r\nand other European nations. The newcomers from continental Europe soon\r\nlost their nationality and learned to speak either English or the local\r\nDutch dialect.\r\n\r\nThe promise of peace, and of the complete fusion of all the elements in\r\none people loyal to the British crown, was not fulfilled. The causes of\r\nthe failure—then insidious, but now easy to detect and analyze—must be\r\nconsidered at this point, for only in their light can we understand the\r\nAfricander people and form a just judgment of their subsequent course.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the colonists were influenced, to a greater degree than they\r\nrealized, by the natural dislike of any civilized people to be\r\ntransferred to the rule of a foreign nation. They were not the kind of\r\npeople to make much of the fact that the Dutch and the English sprang\r\nfrom a common origin more than fourteen hundred years before—if they\r\nhad any knowledge of it. To them the British were a different race, and\r\nthe British government was a kind of unloved step-father who had first\r\nconquered dominion over them by the strong hand and then bought them\r\nwith money, as perpetual chattels, from their degenerate mother\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the failure to amalgamate was in the now fixed\r\ncharacter of the South African Dutch. Few of them dwelt or cared to\r\ndwell in village communities. Some were farmers, it is true, living in\r\ntouch with the towns; but most of them were stockmen roaming in a\r\npastoral life over large tracts of the country—almost without local\r\nhabitation. At long intervals they saw something of their always\r\ndistant next neighbor ranchmen, but they saw nothing of the life in the\r\nfew colonial towns. The intercourse between these pastoral Africanders\r\nand the British was so infrequent, and so limited as to scope, that the\r\ntwo races knew but little of one another. As a result, the process of\r\nsocial amalgamation, going on at Cape Town and in some other places\r\nwhere the population lived in communities, made little progress in the\r\ncountry districts where the great majority of the Africanders dwelt.\r\n\r\nA single incident, of no great proportions in itself, must be given a\r\nseparate mention among the causes of estrangement between the two\r\ncivilized races in South Africa. It was not so much the cause of a new\r\nline of cleavage as it was the wedge driven to the head into one of the\r\nexisting lines. In 1815 a Boer was accused of seriously injuring a\r\nnative servant. When the authorities sent out a small force to arrest\r\nthe accused his neighbors rallied to his defense, and a brief\r\nresistance was offered to the serving of the warrant. The uprising—a\r\nmere neighborhood affair—was easily suppressed. Several prisoners were\r\ntaken, six of whom were condemned to death. Five of the condemned were\r\nhanged, and their women—who had fought beside them—were compelled to\r\nstand by and witness the execution. Some promise of reprieve had been\r\nmade by the governor, Lord Charles Somerset. The crowd of Africanders\r\nstood about the gallows on the fatal day, hoping to the last moment\r\nthat their friends would be spared, but no reprieve came. The tragedy\r\nwas completed, and the story of it went into the Africander folklore,\r\nbecoming, and remaining to this day, a part of the nursery education of\r\nevery Africander child. They named the ridge on which the execution\r\ntook place, “Schlachter’s Nek,” which, being interpreted, is “Butcher’s\r\nRidge.” Canon Knox Little, in his late work on South Africa, is\r\nauthority for the statements that Lord Somerset actually reprieved the\r\ncondemned men, that the reprieve reached the Field-Cornet appointed to\r\ncarry out the execution in good time to save the victims, and that the\r\nField-Cornet executed the death warrant having the governor’s reprieve\r\nin his pocket, being actuated to the murderous deed by private spite.\r\nThe Canon adds that the Field-Cornet was so sure that he, himself,\r\nwould be punished for his iniquity that he committed suicide. It is to\r\nbe devoutly hoped that the learned Canon is well informed both as to\r\nthe governor’s purpose of mercy and the Cornet’s motive for suicide.\r\nWhatever the interior facts may have been, they were unknown to the\r\nAfricanders. The cruel act—justified by the doers as a piece of\r\nnecessary firmness—caused bitter and widespread resentment at the time,\r\nand continues to foster anti-British feeling among all the Dutch of\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nAnother cause that made for disruption was an unwarrantable and most\r\nunwise interference of the British authorities with two cherished and\r\nguaranteed rights of the colonists—the old system of local government,\r\nand the use of the Dutch language in official documents and legal\r\nproceedings. In the forms of government changes were made which greatly\r\nreduced the share formerly enjoyed by the people in the control of\r\ntheir local affairs. The substituting of English for Dutch in official\r\nand legal documents was a still more serious grievance to a people of\r\nwhom not more than one-sixth understood English.\r\n\r\nStill another cause of disaffection grew out of wars with the Kaffirs\r\non the eastern border. Between 1779 and 1834 four struggles to the\r\ndeath occurred between the whites and the tribes living beyond Fish\r\nriver. By dint of hard fighting the Kaffirs were finally subdued and\r\ndriven forth into the Keiskama river region. But for some reason the\r\nhome government assumed that the colonists had ill-treated the natives\r\nand provoked them to war. The dear bought victories of the whites were\r\nrendered sterile by strict orders from the British Colonial Office that\r\nthe Kaffirs be allowed to return to their old haunts, where they once\r\nmore became a source of constant apprehension to the border farmers.\r\nThis action on the part of the home authorities was taken as an\r\nevidence of either weakness or hostility to the Africander population,\r\nand led them to think of the British Colonial Office as their enemy.\r\n\r\nThe final, probably the principal, cause, the one that fanned the\r\nslumbering resentment of many things into active flame, arose out of\r\nthe slave question. To the great detriment of their manhood and\r\nwomanhood the early Dutch colonists resorted to slave labor. From 1658\r\nonward slavery had been practiced throughout the colony, as, indeed, it\r\nhad prevailed in most of the world. Trouble began to grow out of it as\r\nearly as 1737. In that year the first European mission to the\r\nHottentots was undertaken by the Moravian church. Their work was much\r\nobstructed by the colonists, who even compelled one pastor to return to\r\nEurope because he had administered Christian baptism to some native\r\nconverts. In later years most of the missionaries came from England,\r\nwhere the anti-slavery sentiment was fast becoming dominant, and from\r\n1810 the English missionaries were cordially disliked by the colonists\r\nbecause they openly espoused the cause of the slaves and reported every\r\ncase of cruelty to them that came to their knowledge. Possibly they\r\nsometimes exaggerated, as it has been asserted of them, but this may be\r\nexcused in the only friends the oppressed blacks had. Besides this\r\nconflict between the slave-owners and the missionaries, there was a\r\nsteady increase of disaffection from a cognate cause—the temper and\r\naction of the government towards the servile classes. In 1828, to the\r\ngreat disgust of the colonists, a civil ordinance placed all Hottentots\r\nand other free colored people of South Africa on the same footing with\r\nthe whites as to private civil rights. This was followed by enactments\r\nrestricting the authority of masters over their slaves, the purpose\r\nbeing to mitigate the sufferings of the enslaved. Then came the\r\nabolition of slavery in all British dominions, in 1834. To provide\r\ncompensation to slave-owners parliament set apart the sum of\r\n£20,000,000, to be distributed to the several colonies where slavery\r\nhad existed. The share of this amount appropriated to the Cape Colony\r\nslave-holders was a little over £3,000,000—a sum considerably below the\r\nequitable claim for the 39,000 slaves to be set free. Additional\r\nirritation was felt when it was found that the certificates for\r\ncompensation were made payable in London only, so that most of the Cape\r\nslave-holders were forced to sell them to speculators at a heavy\r\ndiscount. Many farmers were impoverished by the change, and labor\r\nbecame so scarce and dear that it was impossible to carry on\r\nagriculture to profit.\r\n\r\nSerious enough was the summing up of the causes that made for the\r\ndisruption of the Dutch and the English classes in Cape Colony.\r\nHitherto the Africanders had been able to indulge their love of\r\nindependence by living apart from the centers of organized government.\r\nBut now they had come under the conquering hand of an alien and\r\nmasterful people; they had been sold for money by their mother country;\r\nthey had been treated with undue sharpness and cruelty—as witness the\r\natrocity of Schlachter’s Nek; they had been spied upon and denounced by\r\nthe missionaries; they had been forced to transact all their official\r\nand legal business in a foreign language which few of them understood;\r\nthe savage native blacks had been put on a level with them; their\r\nvictory over the Kaffirs at the cost of much blood had been rendered\r\nfruitless by the interference of the home government; and now their\r\nslave property, which they had acquired under law, had been taken away\r\nwithout adequate compensation, and the further practice of slavery had\r\nbeen interdicted.\r\n\r\nRebellion against the power of Great Britain was hopeless and not to be\r\nthought of. But they could go out into the wilderness and begin life\r\nanew where they could follow the independent pastoral pursuits they\r\npreferred, enjoy the isolation and solitude they loved, preserve all\r\ntheir ancient customs, and deal with whatever native people they might\r\nfind there in their own way, untrammeled by the English who had\r\nundertaken to govern them on principles which they could neither\r\nunderstand nor approve.\r\n\r\nThen began the “Great Trek” of 1836—the Africander secession and\r\nexodus, leaving their former country to the possession of the English,\r\nand seeking towards the north for a country wherein they would be free\r\naccording to their own ideals of liberty.\r\n\r\nTo the north and east of the utmost limit of European settlement in\r\n1836 was a region now divided into the Orange Free State, The Transvaal\r\nor South African Republic, and the British colony of Natal. A few\r\nhunters had penetrated a little way into it, and some enterprising\r\nborder farmers had occasionally driven their flocks and herds into the\r\nsouthern fringe of it in search of better pasture. It had been\r\ndescribed by the few who had explored it as having districts that were\r\nwell watered and fertile—a country of arable and pasture lands. Within\r\nit, and bordering close to it on the northwest, were the fierce Zulus;\r\nand it abounded with big game and enormous beasts of prey. But the\r\nAfricanders knew what it was to battle for place and for life with wild\r\nbeasts and savage men. They had less dread of these than of the\r\nexperiences they foresaw for themselves under the new government set up\r\nin Cape Colony. They made choice of the wilderness with all its\r\nhardships and perils, and set forth.\r\n\r\nOne may not be able to laud all their motives for taking this course,\r\nas we judge such matters now, after more than half a century during\r\nwhich there has been a constant brightening of the light of moral\r\ntruth. It must be admitted that their action was taken, in part,\r\nbecause of attachment to slavery. But condemnation of that part of\r\ntheir complex motives should be modified by the thought that the best\r\npeoples of the world were just then coming to see with John Wesley that\r\nhuman slavery is “the sum of all villainies.” And it should be\r\nremembered that nearly thirty years later than the Africander secession\r\nand exodus partly in the interest of slavery, fully one-third of the\r\nfree population of the United States seceded from the Union wholly in\r\nthe interest of the same “peculiar institution,” claiming to hold their\r\nlands as well as their slave property, and that it cost the nation a\r\nmillion lives and a thousand million dollars to transmute into American\r\npractice the lofty sentiment embodied in the American Declaration of\r\nIndependence that, being created equal, all men have sacred rights to\r\n“life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”\r\n\r\nAfter discounting fairly the nobility of their motives in making the\r\n“Great Trek,” it will be allowed by every unprejudiced mind that with\r\nthe less laudable were mingled the love of manly independence and a\r\nreasonable resentment at injustices done them in several matters, and\r\nthat they were supported in the hazardous undertaking by a courage\r\nequal to that of the Pilgrim Fathers in venturing into the New England\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nNot inaptly they compared themselves to Israel forsaking Egypt and\r\nbeginning the long wilderness journey to a land of promise, thinking it\r\nnot unlikely that the British governor, like Pharaoh, would pursue\r\nafter them and try to turn them back. But their Pharaoh, after\r\nconsulting his legal adviser, decided to let them go. It was serious,\r\nindeed, to lose so many stalwart and useful citizens, but there was no\r\nlegal way of stopping them; and it would not do to use the strong hand,\r\nfor Great Britain had just abolished slavery.\r\n\r\nSlowly and in small parties the exodus began, for there must not be\r\ncattle enough in one train to exhaust the pasture along the route they\r\nwere to follow. Places of rendezvous were appointed beforehand, where,\r\nat necessary intervals of time, all might come together for mutual\r\nencouragement and counsel. The men carried arms for defense and for the\r\nkilling of game for food. Long experience in shooting, not for sport\r\nbut for life itself, had made them almost infallible marksmen—an\r\naccomplishment that proved their only salvation in the fierce and long\r\ncontinued struggle that was before them.\r\n\r\nBetween 1836 and 1838 nearly 10,000 Africanders set forth, traveling in\r\nlarge covered wagons drawn by strings of oxen numbering in some cases\r\nten and even twelve yoke. It is interesting to know that among the few\r\nsurvivors of that historic pilgrimage is Paul Kruger, who, as a boy of\r\nten years, helped to drive his father’s cattle across velt and mountain\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nThe story of the wanderings of these emigrant Africanders, and of their\r\nconflicts with the warlike aborigines, is romantic to the highest\r\ndegree, recalling in some of its features the adventures of the\r\neleventh century crusaders and of the Spaniards in Mexico in the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first division that trekked, consisting of ninety-eight persons\r\ntraveling in thirty wagons, suffered defeat and almost ruinous\r\ndisaster. They had penetrated into the far northeast beyond the Vaal\r\nriver—the territory of the present South African Republic—where many of\r\ntheir number fell in battle with the natives. The remainder was rapidly\r\nthinned out by deaths from fever and from privation caused by the\r\nwholesale destruction of their cattle by the tsetse-fly. After\r\nincredible sufferings a mere handful escaped eastward to Delagoa Bay.\r\n\r\nAnother and larger division was formed by the union of several smaller\r\nparties at a rocky peak called Thaba ’Ntshu, situated near the eastern\r\nborder of what is now the Orange Free State, and visible from\r\nBloemfontein. This division soon became involved in hostilities with a\r\nbranch of the fierce Zulu race, known in later history as the Matabele.\r\nThe chief of this tribe, Moselekatse, was a general of much talent and\r\nenergy as well as a brave warrior. The Matabele, regarding the\r\nAfricanders as trespassers upon their territory, immediately provoked\r\nwar by attacking and massacring a small detached body of emigrants.\r\nDoubtless the whites were intruders; but they knew that the Matabele\r\nhad lately slaughtered or driven out of that region the weaker Kaffir\r\ntribes, and therefore had no conscientious scruples about meting to\r\nthem the same treatment they had measured to others. Indeed, the\r\nAfricanders seem to have regarded their relation to all the natives as\r\nbeing similar to that of the Israelites under Joshua to the tribes of\r\nCanaan—they were there to possess the land, and to reduce the heathen\r\ninhabitants to submission and servitude by whatever means it might be\r\nnecessary to use. They now had an unprovoked and murderous attack to\r\navenge, which they proceeded to do with great promptitude and courage.\r\nHurling their whole strength against Moselekatse with the utmost fury,\r\nthey routed his greatly superior force with terrific slaughter, so that\r\nhe fled before them, far and fast, toward the northwest, not halting in\r\nhis flight until he had crossed the Limpopo River. There he, in turn,\r\nmade havoc of the natives dwelling between that stream and the Zambesi\r\nRiver, and established in that region the Matabele kingdom in such\r\nstrength that it continued a scourge to all neighboring peoples until\r\nits overthrow in 1893. By the defeat and expulsion of the Matabele the\r\nAfricanders obtained possession of the immense territories lying\r\nbetween the Orange River on the south and the Limpopo on the north. The\r\nsmall communities with which they were able to people the country at\r\nfirst grew in numbers until they became in course of time, the\r\npopulation of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the largest and best organized of the three pioneering\r\nexpeditions, under the capable leadership of Pieter Retief—a man much\r\nrespected by all Africanders to this day—trekked eastward and then\r\nsouthward into the warmer and more fruitful country lying between the\r\nQuathlamba range of mountains and the Indian Ocean. Here they found a\r\nregion practically emptied of native inhabitants, save a not very\r\nnumerous tribe of Zulus. Native wars had nearly depopulated the country\r\nin 1820. They also found a small English settlement at Fort Natal,\r\nwhere the flourishing town of Durban is now situated. These few\r\nEnglishmen had obtained a cession of the narrow maritime strip they\r\noccupied from King Tshaka, and were maintaining a little republic as a\r\ntemporary form of government until they could obtain the status of a\r\nBritish colony. They had applied for that standing in 1835, with the\r\nrequest that a legislature be granted them. The British government was\r\nstill considering their request, and was in doubt as to whether it\r\nshould occupy the fort and establish a colony there, when the\r\nAfricanders arrived. The settlement was so insignificant, and the\r\nprospective action of the British authorities so uncertain that the\r\nemigrants paid little attention to it.\r\n\r\nDesiring to live on terms of peace with the Zulus the Africanders\r\napplied to their king, Dingaan, for a cession of territory, rashly\r\nvisiting his kraal for that purpose. The king made the grant readily\r\nenough, but the next day when they were about to depart after drinking\r\na farewell cup of native beer, he treacherously ordered his warriors to\r\nslay his guests, alleging that they were wizards. Pieter Retief, with\r\nall who had accompanied him on the embassy perished that day, and the\r\ndeed was followed up with an attack on a small body of emigrants camped\r\nnear by. The surprise was complete, and every soul was massacred\r\nwithout mercy.\r\n\r\nThese atrocities roused the whole body of emigrants to execute\r\nvengeance, and they did it so effectually that anniversaries of that\r\nday, December 16th, 1838, are still observed by the people of the\r\nTransvaal. A mere handful of the Africanders decimated and put to rout\r\nKing Dingaan’s great host. They owed their victory to expert\r\nmarkmanship and horsemanship as well as to their lion-like bravery and\r\nprowess. Riding swiftly into easy range they fired a volley with deadly\r\nprecision and then wheeled and as swiftly rode out of reach of the Zulu\r\nassagais without suffering harm. Several repetitions of this maneuver\r\nso reduced the fighting force and the courage of the Zulus that they\r\nturned and fled precipitately. Two years later, 1840, the king’s\r\nbrother, Panda, then in rebellion against Dingaan, made common cause\r\nwith the Africanders, and together they drove the warlike king out of\r\nZululand. Panda was then made king in his brother’s stead, accepting\r\nthe relation of vassal to the government of the Natalia Republic\r\nestablished by the Africanders. They began about this time to survey\r\nand apportion the land, and founded a city about sixty-five miles\r\ninland from Port Natal, known ever since as Pietermaritzburg.\r\n\r\nThis action, with some others of a like nature, brought about the\r\nsecond contact of Boer and Briton, the subject to be treated in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSECOND CONTACT OF AFRICANDER AND BRITON—IN NATAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British authorities at Cape Colony suffered the Africanders to go\r\nforth in peace on their Great Trek in search of isolation and\r\nindependence. But the light of succeeding events shows that, without\r\nformally announcing it at first, the government held that the\r\nAfricanders, go where they might, were to be considered British\r\nsubjects, and that any territory they might occupy would become British\r\nterritory by virtue of such occupancy.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when the Republic of Natalia was being organized by the\r\nAfricanders a small detachment of British troops which had been landed\r\nat Port Natal was withdrawn. This was construed by the emigrants as an\r\nabandonment by the British government of all claim to the country.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident, however, that the proceedings of the new\r\nsettlers in Natal were narrowly watched by the authorities at the Cape,\r\nand that some of the measures taken were looked upon with serious\r\ndispleasure. The expulsion of the Kaffirs, and an attempt to force them\r\ninto a territory already occupied by another tribe, were condemned as\r\nbeing likely to provoke further disorder and conflict. And then, the\r\nCape government, since the Great Trek, had asserted over and over again\r\nits right to control the Africanders in any region they might occupy,\r\nas subjects of the British crown. Their action in establishing a new\r\nand independent white state on the coast was viewed with alarm; for it\r\nwould certainly affect trade with the interior tribes, and it might\r\ncreate a local rival to Britain’s maritime supremacy within what had\r\nbeen considered her own borders. Besides, the colonial government held\r\nthat it was the natural guardian and protector of the natives, and the\r\nattack of the Africanders on the Kaffirs living in near neighborhood to\r\nthe eastern borders of the Cape settlements was regarded as an insolent\r\naggression which ought to be resented and checked.\r\n\r\nThe Africanders, on the other hand, denied that the Cape government had\r\nany authority over them. The British government, they averred, was\r\nterritorial and had no authority outside the region hitherto formally\r\nclaimed by the British crown. And they had trekked out of the territory\r\nto which Great Britain had laid claim purposely to be a separate, free\r\nand independent people. England’s thirty million dollars had purchased\r\nsuch territorial rights and public improvements in South Africa as were\r\nformerly possessed by the Netherlands, but her money had not bought\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAt this time the British government was unwilling to add to its already\r\ntoo extensive colonial possessions and the heavy responsibilities\r\nconnected with them. Nevertheless, after careful consideration of all\r\nthat would be involved in not checking the Africander aspirations and\r\nmovements towards independence, it was determined to establish British\r\ndominion over Port Natal and the territory west of it as far as the\r\ncrest of the Quathlamba chain of mountains and the extension of them to\r\nthe north. Pursuant to this policy a small military force under Captain\r\nSmith was sent to take possession of Port Natal in 1842.\r\n\r\nSmith’s command was selected from the post garrison at Umgazi River,\r\nand consisted of only two hundred men and two field pieces. The route\r\nwas over nearly three hundred miles of sea coast in a wilderness state,\r\nacross numerous rivers, and through the habitat of elephants and lions\r\nwhose fresh spoor the men saw frequently. After an arduous march of\r\nthirty-five days, from the 31st of March to the 4th of May, they\r\nreached Port Natal and camped on a hill about six miles from the town.\r\n\r\nThe resident English, while rejoiced to see the soldiers, were both\r\namused and alarmed when they saw how small a force had been sent to\r\ndeal with a people who could muster 1,500 well-armed men. Nothing\r\ndaunted, however, Captain Smith took a few of the artillery and marched\r\ninto the town on the 5th day of May, hauled down the flag of the\r\nNatalia Republic, hoisted in its place the British Union Jack, and\r\nspiked the one Africander gun found beside the flagstaff.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days there was much diplomatic correspondence between\r\nthe Africander leader, A. W. Pretorius, and the English\r\ncommander—without coming to any terms of agreement. In the meantime the\r\nEnglish moved their encampment to a piece of level ground in front of\r\nthe town, and the Africanders began to gather a force at the old Dutch\r\ncamping ground on the Congella, about three miles from the British\r\nforce. Captain Smith had written instructions to give the “emigrant\r\nfarmers” fifteen days to come to a decision, which time the farmers\r\nused in strengthening their ranks and intrenching their camp.\r\n\r\nIt will throw light on the policy pursued at this time by the\r\nAfricanders to take into view the action of a certain Dutch ship-master\r\nwho put into Port Natal one day before the arrival of the British. This\r\nman, Captain Reus, speaking as one having authority, gave the\r\nAfricanders to understand that the Dutch government would espouse their\r\ncause and interest other European powers therein. He also advised them\r\nto pursue an evasive policy, to avoid collision, and to keep the\r\nEnglish in play till their friends in Europe could act. In accordance\r\nwith this advice the Africanders drew up a declaration of allegiance to\r\nthe Dutch government, coupled with a protest against the occupation of\r\nthe country by the English. With the exception of the occasional\r\nlifting of cattle, they refrained from acts of hostility.\r\n\r\nMatters continued in this state until the 23d of May—three days in\r\nexcess of the fifteen allowed the Africanders for consideration—when a\r\nnight attack was made on their camp by the British. Captain Smith found\r\nhis enemy on the alert, and after a sharp engagement in which the\r\nBritish lost 103 men in killed, wounded and missing, and both the field\r\nguns, he retired to the fortified camp near Port Natal.\r\n\r\nThe Africanders immediately laid siege to the British garrison and,\r\ndoubtless, would have compelled it to surrender in the end had it not\r\nbeen for the bravery and endurance of a young Englishman named Richard\r\nKing. It was six hundred miles, across the breadth of Kaffraria, from\r\nPort Natal to Grahamstown, the nearest point at which help for the\r\nbeleaguered garrison could be found. Young King made the distance,\r\ncrossing two hundred rivers on the way, in ten days—really in eight,\r\nfor he was compelled by fever to rest two days out of the ten.\r\n\r\nImmediately on receipt of the news at Grahamstown, a force under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cloete was dispatched by sea, and reached the\r\nfamished garrison after it had endured a close siege of thirty-one\r\ndays. The approach of the re-enforcements was resisted in an action in\r\nwhich the British succeeded in landing, drove the Africanders from\r\ntheir positions, and effected a junction with the garrison in Port\r\nNatal. The loss of life in this engagement was not severe, but the\r\nsiege was raised, and no fresh hostilities were undertaken at that\r\ntime. The Africanders withdrew to a camp about twelve miles from Port\r\nNatal, where they awaited developments—expecting to be attacked. But\r\nthe British commander was not in a position for immediate aggression.\r\nHis provisions and ammunition were to be landed, and there were safe\r\nmagazines to be provided and strategic posts to be established.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1842, A. W. Pretorius, commandant of the\r\nAfricander force—now four hundred strong—sent a communication to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cloete, asking if he wished to confer with them. The\r\nreply was to the effect that no negotiations would be entered into\r\nwithout a previous declaration by the Africanders of their submission\r\nto the British government.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of July Mr. Pretorius again wrote the British commander,\r\ncomplaining that the Kaffirs were committing serious outrages upon his\r\npeople and plundering them of their cattle, which were being sold to\r\nthe English. He also informed the commander that, anxious as they were\r\nto put an end to the war and so prevent all future bloodshed, the\r\nAfricanders found it impossible to accede to the condition imposed as a\r\nnecessary preliminary to negotiations for peace, viz.: that the\r\nAfricanders should declare their submission to the British crown. Mr.\r\nPretorius added, as a reason for this, that they had already made over\r\nthe country to the king of the Netherlands, and had invoked his\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cloete replied on the same date, deploring the\r\nmelancholy prospect of continued war, which would doubtless be\r\ncomplicated with such barbarities as the native savages might be\r\nexpected to perpetrate. But he maintained that the Africanders were\r\nthemselves responsible for that prospect, because of their determined\r\nacts of hostility to the British government. He intimated that, if they\r\nwere sincere in the professed desire to avert the coming bloodshed,\r\nthere would be nothing degrading in giving in their submission to her\r\nBritannic Majesty’s government, and assured them that there was every\r\ndisposition on the part of the British authorities to make the final\r\nadjustment of affairs both just and generous toward the emigrant\r\nfarmers. He also expressed much regret that they had allowed themselves\r\nto be deceived with regard to the intentions of the King of Holland by\r\na person possessed of no authority to act in the matter. He should be\r\nhappy, he added in closing, to use his best efforts to prevent acts of\r\nviolence by the Zulus and Kaffirs, but felt his inability to do much in\r\nthat respect as long as the Africanders continued in arms against her\r\nMajesty’s authority, and thus gave these tribes reason to think that\r\nwhatever injury done to her rebellious subjects must be pleasing to her\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic correspondence was prolonged into 1843, when a meeting\r\nbetween Mr. Pretorius and other Africander leaders and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cloete attended by three or four advisers took a\r\nplace at Pietermaritzburg. The outcome of the conference was a treaty\r\nby which Natal was declared a British colony, but it was remarkably\r\nindefinite as to other particulars. The Africanders were to acknowledge\r\nthemselves British subjects, but were not required to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the queen. The guns they had captured, as well as all\r\ntheir own ordnance, were to be given up. All public and private\r\nproperty was to be restored to the rightful owners or custodians. All\r\nprisoners were to be released, and a general amnesty was to be\r\nproclaimed to all persons who had been engaged in hostilities against\r\nher Majesty’s troops and authority, with the exception of four persons,\r\namong whom was Mr. Pretorius. By a subsequent article in the treaty the\r\nlieutenant-colonel included Mr. Pretorius in the amnesty in\r\nconsideration of his valuable services and co-operation in arranging\r\nthe final adjustment of the terms of surrender.\r\n\r\nThe Volksraad of the little Africander republic submitted to the terms\r\nof the treaty, and to the British administration, in much bitterness\r\nand wrath, protesting vehemently but without effect against a certain\r\nleveling up process, introduced soon after the transfer of authority,\r\nby which the savage blacks were given equal civil rights with the\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nHow the Africanders of Natal in general received the new regime, and\r\nhow they acted under it, will be the subject of another chapter.\r\n\r\nThe annexation of the young republic by the English defeated the first\r\nattempt of the Africanders to secure access to the sea. It seemed to be\r\na turning point in the history of South Africa, for by it Great Britain\r\nobtained command of the east coast, and established a new center of\r\nBritish influence in a part of the country which has come to be called\r\nthe garden of Africa. Moreover, it opened the way for the acquisition\r\nof large contiguous territories in Zululand and in Tongaland.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that if the little Dutch republic had been left to\r\nitself the natives would have suffered under a more rigorous treatment\r\nthan they have experienced at the hands of the British government, and\r\nthat the internal dissensions which became quite serious during its\r\nbrief history would have necessitated British interference in the\r\ngeneral interest of European South Africa. But one cannot feel perfect\r\nconfidence in uninspired prophecy. And one cannot repress the feeling\r\nthat the people who had trekked into an unclaimed and unoccupied\r\ncountry for the sake of being isolated from the British, who had\r\nsubdued the savage Zulu tribes and set up a civilized government of\r\ntheir own, were seized of sacred rights to peaceful possession and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSECOND CONTACT OF AFRICANDER AND BRITON—NORTH OF THE ORANGE RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Africanders who had trekked into the spreading uplands lying\r\nbetween the Orange River and the Limpopo, west of Natal, were not\r\nexempt from the tribulations experienced by their brethren who had\r\nturned eastward to the coast. Like them they were forced to wage\r\nincessant war with the natives; but the enemies they had to encounter\r\nwere less formidable than the Zulus. One tribe, however, and their\r\nhistoric chief, Moshesh, were foemen worthy of their steel. In the\r\nnineteenth century there were three men of the Kaffir race who were\r\nvastly superior to any of their own people, and measured up evenly with\r\nthe ablest white opponents they met in diplomacy and war. These men\r\nwere Tshaka the Zulu, Khama of the Bechuanos, and Moshesh the Basuto.\r\nIt was the fortune of the Orange River emigrants to meet this Moshesh\r\nand the Basutos in many a hard-fought battle for the possession of the\r\ncountry. Moshesh differed from other Kaffir leaders in that he was\r\nmerciful to his wounded and captive enemies and ruled his own people\r\nwith mildness and equity. As early as 1832 he opened the way for, and\r\neven invited, missionaries to teach the Basutos a better way of life,\r\nand they exerted a powerful formative influence on the Basuto nation.\r\nThe missionaries were all European—some of them were British—which\r\nlatter fact was made apparent in the result of their work. When the\r\nunavoidable conflict between the Basutos and the whites came, the\r\nBasutos, guided by their missionaries, were careful to avoid any fatal\r\nbreach with the British government. Several times Moshesh engaged in\r\nwar with the Orange River emigrants, but only once with the English.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the Africanders of this region were widely scattered over a\r\nvast spread of country measuring seven hundred miles in length and\r\nthree hundred in width. To the southeast it was bounded by the\r\nQuathlamba mountains, but on the north and west there were no natural\r\nfeatures to delimitate it from the plain which extends to the Zambesi\r\non the north and to the Atlantic Ocean on the west. Within this\r\nterritory the Africander population, in 1843, was not much more than\r\n15,000. This seems a small number in view of the fact that the pioneer\r\nemigrants of 1836 to 1838 had been largely re-enforced from the Cape\r\ncolony. But it must be remembered their life was precarious in the\r\nextreme; many had died—some from disease, some in conflict with wild\r\nbeasts, and a still greater number in their frequent wars with the\r\nnatives. The white population was further recruited between 1843 and\r\n1847 by a second Africander trek from Natal—which will be described in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nSo small a body of people, of whom not more than 4,000 were adult\r\nmales, occupying so vast a territory, experienced serious difficulties\r\nin establishing an efficient government. The difficulties growing out\r\nof that cause were enhanced by the very qualities in the Africanders\r\nwhich had led to their emigration from the old colony, and which had\r\nmade them successful in their wars of conquest in the interior. To an\r\nexcessive degree they were possessed by a spirit of individual poise\r\nand independence. They desired isolation—even from one another. They\r\nchafed and grew restive under control of any kind, so much so that they\r\nwere indisposed to obey even the authorities created by themselves. For\r\nwarlike expeditions, which yielded them a pleasant excitement, enlarged\r\ntheir territory by conquest, and enriched them with captured cattle and\r\nother spoil, they readily united under their military leaders and\r\nrendered them obedience, but any other form of control they found\r\nirksome. This predilection towards solitary independence was constantly\r\nstrengthened by the circumstances in which they lived. The soil, being\r\ndry and parched in most places, did not invite agriculture to any\r\nconsiderable extent. Most of the people turned to stock-farming, and\r\nthe nomadic life it necessitated in seeking change of pasture for the\r\nflocks and herds confirmed the disposition to live separate from other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOut of these causes grew the determination to make their civil\r\ngovernment absolutely popular, and conditioned, entirely, on the will\r\nof the governed. But unity of some kind must be had, for their very\r\nexistence depended on acting together against the natives, and against\r\nthe repeated claims of the British government to exercise sovereignty\r\nover the region they occupied. The first steps towards instituting\r\ncivil government were taken in the organizing of several small\r\nrepublican communities, the design being that each should manage its\r\nown affairs by a general meeting of all the citizens. It was found,\r\nhowever, as the population spread over the country, that such\r\nindependent neighborhood governments failed to secure the necessary\r\nunity of the whole people in any matter requiring the aggregate\r\nstrength of the whole people. To remedy this element of weakness and\r\ndanger, the Africanders instituted a kind of federal bond between the\r\nlittle republican communities, in an elective assembly called the\r\nVolksraad—a Council of the People composed of delegates from all the\r\nsectional governments. This federative tie was of the weakest—its\r\nauthority resting upon an unwritten understanding and common consent\r\nrather than upon formal articles of confederation, and its meaning\r\nbeing always subject to such interpretation as might be suggested by\r\nthe error or the passion of the passing moment.\r\n\r\nThe territory beyond the Vaal River, to the far northeast from Cape\r\nColony, was left undisturbed by the British government. The Africanders\r\nliving there were hundreds of miles from the nearest British outpost.\r\nTheir wars with the natives projected no disturbing influence upon the\r\ntribes with whom the colonial government was in touch and for whose\r\npeace and prosperity it felt responsible. Moreover, the British\r\nauthorities at the Cape were under instructions from the Colonial\r\nOffice of the home government to rather contract than expand the scope\r\nof British influence in South Africa. For these reasons the Cape\r\ngovernment cared nothing for what took place in the outlying regions\r\nbeyond the Vaal, unless, indeed, it was some event calculated to\r\ndisturb the natives dwelling next the colonial borders.\r\n\r\nAltogether different, in the esteem of the Cape authorities and of the\r\nColonial office, were the affairs of the region extending southwestward\r\nfrom the Vaal River to the borders of Cape Colony. Within that\r\nterritory there had been frequent dissensions between Africander\r\ncommunities. And there had been a rapid increase of dangerous elements\r\nin the native population. The Basutos had grown powerful. Intermixed\r\nwith the whites were the Griquas, a half-breed hunting people, sprung\r\nfrom Africander fathers and Hottentot mothers, and partially civilized.\r\nThe possibility of serious native wars growing out of quarrels between\r\nthe white emigrants themselves and between them and the mixed colored\r\npopulation was a constant distress to both colonial governors and the\r\nhome authorities.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Cape was regarded the least prosperous of all the\r\nBritish colonies, and there was a growing indisposition to annex any\r\nmore territory in South Africa. The soil was mostly arid. The\r\nAfricander population was alien. The Kaffir wars threatened to be\r\nendless and very costly in men and in money. This reluctance to enlarge\r\nhad been overcome in the case of Natal; but Natal was the garden of\r\nSouth Africa and the possession of it gave the British command of the\r\neast coast almost to Delagoa Bay. But to the north there seemed to be\r\nnothing sufficiently inviting to justify the taking up of new\r\nresponsibility and expense.\r\n\r\nThe problem of how to safeguard the peace of the old Cape Colony\r\nwithout undertaking the burdens involved in governing and holding the\r\nwhole Africander territory to the northeast, including the region\r\nbeyond the Vaal River, was thought to have been solved by Doctor\r\nPhilip, an English missionary, who had some influence with the\r\ngovernment. The scheme recommended by Doctor Philip was that the\r\ngovernment should create a line of native states under British control\r\nalong the northeast border of Cape Colony. These would act, he claimed,\r\nas a barrier to break the influence of the more turbulent Africanders\r\nin the regions north of that line on those of their blood who were yet\r\ncitizens of the old colony, and they would, in like manner, separate\r\nbetween the native tribes in the colony and those in the interior.\r\n\r\nDoctor Philip’s plan was adopted with much enthusiasm. A treaty\r\nsuitable to the purpose contemplated had already been made with a\r\nnorthern Griqua leader named Waterboer. In 1843 two other treaties were\r\nmade, one with Moshesh of the Basutos and the other with Adam Kok, a\r\nleader of the Orange River Griquas. It was fondly believed that these\r\nthree states, recognized by and in treaty with Great Britain, would\r\nisolate the colony from the disturbing and dangerous people to the\r\nnorth of them.\r\n\r\nDoctor Philip’s promising arrangement disappointed every one. The\r\nAfricanders living in the territory of the Griquas refused to be bound\r\nin any sense by a treaty made by the despised half-breeds, and the\r\nformer troubles continued. A further effort was made to give effect to\r\nthe doctor’s statesmanship by establishing a military post at\r\nBloemfontein, about half way between the Orange River and the Vaal, for\r\nthe purpose of enforcing order and of carrying out the provisions of\r\nthe treaty. This step was followed up in 1848 by the formal annexation\r\nto the British dominions in South Africa of the entire country lying\r\nbetween the Orange and the Vaal, under the name of the Orange River\r\nSovereignty. The second contact of Boer and Briton, begun in Natal in\r\n1842, was thus extended into the Orange River territory.\r\n\r\nThe Africanders rose up to assert their independence, encouraged and\r\nre-enforced by their brethren from beyond the Vaal. Under the able and\r\nenergetic leadership of Mr. Pretorius, who had opposed the British in\r\nNatal, they attacked Bloemfontein, captured the garrison posted there\r\nand advanced to the south as far as Orange River.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Cape Colony, Sir Harry Smith, hastily dispatched a\r\nsufficient force, which met and defeated the Africanders at Bloomplats,\r\nabout seventy-five miles north of the Orange River, on the 29th of\r\nAugust, 1848. The sole result of this battle was the restoration of\r\nBritish authority over the Orange River Sovereignty. The territory was\r\nnot incorporated with that of Cape Colony, neither were the Africanders\r\ndwelling north of the Vaal River further interfered with.\r\n\r\nThe old conditions of unrest continued. Fresh quarrels among the native\r\ntribes seemed to call for British interference, and led them into war\r\nwith the Basutos under Moshesh. Out of this conflict and its threatened\r\ncomplications grew a deliberate change of imperial policy in South\r\nAfrica, which the English have never ceased to regret.\r\n\r\nThe situation, so pregnant with far-reaching results, may be stated\r\nthus, in brief: The British resident at Bloemfontein had no force at\r\nhis command that could cope with the Basutos under the masterly\r\nleadership of Moshesh. The Africanders living in the district were\r\ndisaffected—even hostile—to the British government. They therefore\r\nrefused to support the resident, preferring to fight only their own\r\nbattles and to make their own terms with the Basutos. The situation of\r\nthe British grew still more critical when Mr. Pretorius—yet a leading\r\nspirit among the Africanders north of the Vaal—threatened to make\r\ncommon cause with the Basutos. As for the old colony at the Cape, it\r\nwas already involved in a fierce conflict with the south coast Kaffirs,\r\nand could not spare a man to aid in quieting the northern disturbances.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture of circumstances Mr. Pretorius made overtures to the\r\ncolonial authorities, intimating that he and the northern Africanders\r\ndesired to make some permanent pacific arrangement with Great Britain.\r\nThe British authorities, disavowing all right to control the territory\r\nnorth of the Vaal, but still claiming the allegiance of the Africanders\r\nresident therein, appointed commissioners to negotiate with Mr.\r\nPretorius and other representatives of the Transvaal group of\r\nemigrants. Subsequently the home authorities of the British government\r\nappointed and sent out Sir George R. Clark, K. C. B., as “Her Majesty’s\r\nSpecial Commissioner for settling the affairs of the Orange River\r\nSovereignty.” Having conferred with all who were concerned personally\r\nin the affairs of the Sovereignty, Sir George, in a meeting held at\r\nSand River in 1852, concluded a convention with the commandant and\r\ndelegates of the Africanders living north of the Vaal.\r\n\r\nIn the provisions of this convention the British government expressly\r\n“guaranteed to the emigrant-farmers beyond the Vaal River the right to\r\nmanage their own affairs and to govern themselves according to their\r\nown laws, without any interference on the part of the British\r\ngovernment,” and it permitted the emigrants to purchase ammunition in\r\nthe British colonies in South Africa. It also disclaimed “all alliances\r\nwith any of the colored nations north of the Vaal River,” and\r\nstipulated that “no slavery is or shall be permitted or practiced by\r\nthe farmers north of the Vaal River.”\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Republic, called, later, the South African Republic,\r\ndates its independence from this convention, concluded at Sand River in\r\n1852. It also, by the same instrument, severed itself and its interests\r\nfrom the Africander emigrants living in the Sovereignty south of the\r\nVaal—an act which their southern brethren deemed little short of a\r\nbetrayal.\r\n\r\nFor a few months after the convention of 1852 the Sovereignty continued\r\nBritish, and might have done so for many years but for a serious defeat\r\nof the British arms in that territory by the Basutos. General Cathcart,\r\nwho had just been installed as governor of the Cape, rashly attacked\r\nthe Basutos with a strong force of regulars, was led into an ambush and\r\nsuffered so great a disaster that further hostile operations were\r\nimpossible without a new and larger army. The politic Moshesh saw in\r\nthe situation an opportunity to make peace with the English on\r\nfavorable terms, which he at once proceeded to do.\r\n\r\nThis crushing reverse called out a report to the British ministers\r\nrelative to the condition of affairs in the Sovereignty, and a\r\nstatement of the policy he favored in reference to that part of her\r\nmajesty’s dominions, from Sir George Clark, the special commissioner\r\nappointed to settle the affairs thereof. The closing paragraphs of that\r\nreport read as follows:\r\n\r\n“The more I consider the position, relative both to the Cape colony and\r\nits (the Sovereignty’s) own internal circumstances, the more I feel\r\nassured of its inutility as an acquisition, and am impressed with a\r\nsense of the vain conceit of continuing to supply it with civil and\r\nmilitary establishments in a manner becoming the character of the\r\nBritish Government, and advantageous to our resources.\r\n\r\n“It is a vast territory, possessing nothing that can sanction its being\r\npermanently added to a frontier already inconveniently extended. It\r\nsecures no genuine interests; it is recommended by no prudent or\r\njustifiable motive; it answers no really beneficial purpose; it imparts\r\nno strength to the British Government, no credit to its character, no\r\nlustre to the crown. To remain here, therefore, to superintend or to\r\ncountenance this extension of British dominion, or to take part in any\r\nadministrative measure for the furtherance of so unessential an object,\r\nwould, I conceive, be tantamount to my encouraging a serious evil, and\r\nparticipating in one of the most signal fallacies which has ever come\r\nunder my notice in the course of nearly thirty years devoted to the\r\npublic service.”\r\n\r\nThe British Government, weary of the perpetual native wars, disgusted\r\nat the late defeat of the British regulars by Moshesh and his Basutos,\r\nand influenced by the emphatic and very significant report of their\r\nspecial commissioner, which report was heartily indorsed by Governor\r\nCathcart, decided to abandon the Orange River Sovereignty altogether.\r\nAn act of parliament in accordance with that decision was passed.\r\nLater, when there were vehement protests against the\r\nabandonment—protests from the missionaries who feared for the welfare\r\nof the natives, and from English settlers in the Sovereignty who\r\ndesired to remain subject to the British crown—a motion was made in the\r\nHouse of Commons begging the Queen to reconsider the renunciation of\r\nher sovereignty over the Orange River territory, but the motion found\r\nno support at all, and had to be withdrawn. Instead, parliament voted\r\n£48,000 to compensate any who might suffer loss in the coming change,\r\nso eager were the authorities to be rid of this large territory with\r\nits constant vexations and its costliness. And thus it was that\r\nindependence was literally forced upon the Orange River country.\r\n\r\nBy the convention of the 23d of February, 1854, signed at Bloemfontein,\r\nthe British government “guaranteed the future independence of the\r\ncountry and its government,” and covenanted that they should be, “to\r\nall intents and purposes, a free and independent people.” It further\r\nprovided that the Orange River government was to be free to purchase\r\nammunition in the British South African colonies, and that liberal\r\nprivileges were to be granted it in connection with import duties. As\r\nin the case of the Transvaal, so in this convention it was stipulated,\r\nthat no slavery or trade in slaves was to be permitted north of the\r\nOrange River. The name given to the new nation was “The Orange River\r\nFree State.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that these conventions of 1852 and 1854 created two\r\nnew and independent states. Nor can it be denied that in consenting to\r\ntheir creation the action of the British government was taken under no\r\npressure of war, under no powerful foreign interference, but altogether\r\nof its own free will, and with the conviction that in cutting loose\r\nfrom undesirable and disputed territory it was acting for the good of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nCanon Knox Little, in his “South Africa,” calls this action of the\r\nBritish government “a serious blunder.” Be that as it may, the\r\nAfricanders acted in perfect consistency with all their former\r\naspirations and claims, and they made no blunders in the negotiations\r\nthat secured to them independent national existence. The British\r\n“blunder”—if blunder it was—was written in a formal official document,\r\nand subscribed by the authorised representatives of the government,\r\nappointed expressly to give effect to imperial legislation, and can no\r\nmore be repudiated righteously than can a written contract between\r\nprivate individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICANDERS’ SECOND TREK TO THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purview intended to be given in these pages requires that we now\r\nlook back to Natal, and to the condition and movements of the\r\nAfricanders living in that region after it became British territory. As\r\nhas been stated in chapter V., the English took forcible possession of\r\nNatal in 1843. Two years later it was made a dependency of the older\r\ncolony at the Cape; in 1856 it was constituted a separate colony, and\r\nso remains to this day.\r\n\r\nA small minority of the Africanders—about five hundred families—being\r\ngreatly attached to the homes they had founded in that most attractive\r\npart of South Africa, reconciled themselves to the British\r\nadministration and remained. But the majority, including all the\r\nfiercer and more restless spirits, took their families and goods, their\r\nflocks and herds, and once more trekked in search of independence.\r\nTheir course lay northwestward across the mountains to the elevated\r\nplateaus of the Orange River district and the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nVery reluctantly the Africanders abandoned sunny and fruitful Natal,\r\nand the one hold they had ever gained of a part of the coast. But a\r\ngoodly land and access to the sea, to be of great value in their\r\nesteem, must be associated with freedom to govern themselves and to\r\ndeal with the native population as an inferior and servile race not\r\nentitled to civil equality with the whites.\r\n\r\nThe Africander love of independence, and their reasonable objection to\r\nbe civilly on a level with the ignorant and savage blacks, command\r\nrespect and admiration; but their treatment of the natives, where\r\nunrestrained by British rule, was anything but creditable. They may be\r\nexcused for many wars with Bushmen and Kaffirs, for their very lives\r\ndepended on either reducing these to submission or driving them to a\r\nsafe distance from the white settlements. But the enslaving of men and\r\nwomen, and, later, of children under the subterfuge of apprenticeship\r\nfor a term of years, cannot be justified; it was monstrously\r\nincompatible with the insistent demand for personal freedom for\r\nthemselves so conspicuous in the Africander race. The one extenuating\r\ncircumstance is the fact that, leading an isolated life, they were\r\nslower than other civilized peoples in catching the spirit of the age—a\r\nspirit that makes for freedom, and a growing betterment in the\r\ncondition of every man.\r\n\r\nThe exodus of Natal Africanders between 1843 and 1848 encouraged an\r\nimmense influx of Kaffirs, who repopulated the country so plentifully\r\nthat the proportion of blacks to whites has been as ten to one ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants who settled north of the Vaal, both those of the Great\r\nTrek and those from Natal who began to join them in 1843, were rude and\r\nuneducated as compared to their brethren of the Orange River region.\r\nThe northern group had less of English blood in their veins, and\r\nbecause of distance and difficulty of communication they were not at\r\nall affected by intercourse with the more cultured people of Cape\r\nColony.\r\n\r\nLacking the upward lead that contact with a progressive civilization\r\nwould have given, there took place a marked degeneration of character\r\nin these more northern emigrants. Their love of independence was\r\ndeveloped into a spirit of faction and dissension among themselves.\r\nTheir lionlike bravery was perverted into a too great readiness to\r\nfight on the smallest provocation, and a disposition to prey upon their\r\nweaker native neighbors. Through a desire to enlarge their grazing\r\nlands they became greedy as to territory, and were almost constantly\r\nengaged in bloody strife with the native occupants of the regions they\r\ninsisted on annexing.\r\n\r\nThe almost patriarchal mode of life they followed had the effect of\r\nsegregating them into family groups widely separated from one another,\r\nlargely exempted from any control of magistrates and law courts, and\r\nsusceptible to family feuds and bitter personal rivalries between\r\nfaction leaders. This absence of efficient control was a cause of\r\nfurther evil in encouraging an influx of unprincipled adventurers from\r\nother parts of South Africa. These went about through the more\r\nunsettled parts and along the border, cheating and often violently\r\nilltreating the natives to the great peril of peace both in the\r\nTransvaal and in the contiguous British provinces. As an example of the\r\nturmoil in which the people lived and participated, the following\r\naccount is introduced of an Africander expedition under Acting\r\nCommandant-General Scholtz against Secheli, chief of the Baquaines, a\r\ntribe of Zulus. It also covers the incident of the plundering of Doctor\r\nLivingstone’s house by the force under General Scholtz.\r\n\r\nThe matter of complaint was that the Baquaines had been constantly\r\ndisturbing the country by thefts and threatenings, and that they were\r\nsheltering a turbulent chief named Mosolele. In order to punish and\r\nreduce them to obedience a commando was sent against them. After some\r\npetty encounters with scouts the Africander force drew near to\r\nSecheli’s town, in the direction of the Great Lake, on the 25th of\r\nAugust, 1852. Two days’ further march brought them so near that the\r\nAfricander scouts discovered and reported that Secheli was making every\r\npreparation for defense.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th Scholtz marched close by the town where Secheli was\r\nfortified, and camped beside the town-water, a little distance from the\r\nintrenchments. It being Saturday Scholtz resolved to do nothing to\r\nprovoke a battle before Monday, being desirous of keeping the Lord’s\r\nDay in quiet. He did, however, dispatch a letter to Secheli demanding\r\nthe surrender of Mosolele, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Friend Secheli: As an upright friend, I would advise you not to allow\r\nyourself to be misled by Mosolele, who has fled to you because he has\r\ndone wrong. Rather give him back to me, that he may answer for his\r\noffense. I am also prepared to enter into the best arrangements with\r\nyou. Come over to me, and we shall arrange everything for the best,\r\neven were it this evening. Your friend,\r\n\r\n“P. E. SCHOLTZ, Act. Com.-Gen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Secheli replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wait till Monday. I shall not deliver up Mosolele. * * * But I\r\nchallenge you on Monday to show which is the strongest man. I am, like\r\nyourself, provided with arms and ammunition, and have more fighting\r\npeople than you. I should not have allowed you thus to come in, and\r\nwould assuredly have fired upon you; but I have looked in the book,\r\nupon which I reserved my fire. I am myself provided with cannon. Keep\r\nyourself quiet to-morrow, and do not quarrel for water till Monday;\r\nthen we shall see who is the strongest man. You are already in my pot;\r\nI shall only have to put the lid on it on Monday.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday Secheli sent two men to the camp to borrow some sugar—which\r\nScholtz regarded as bravado. The messengers also brought word from\r\nSecheli directing Scholtz to take good care that the oxen did not\r\npasture on the poisonous grass in the neighborhood of his camp, for he\r\nnow looked upon them as his own.\r\n\r\nOn Monday Scholtz sent messengers to Secheli to ascertain his\r\nintentions and to renew the offers of peace. The Zulu chieftain replied\r\nthat he required no peace, that he now challenged Scholtz to fight, and\r\nadded, “If you have not sufficient ammunition, I will lend you some.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further exchanges of diplomatic courtesies between the\r\nAfrican and the Africander the battle began. By six hours of hard\r\nfighting Scholtz carried all the native intrenchments, killed a large\r\nnumber of the warriors, and captured many guns and prisoners. The Zulus\r\nstill held one fortified ridge of rocks when nightfall put an end to\r\nthe battle. In the morning it was found that Secheli had retreated from\r\nhis stronghold under cover of night. Scholtz sent out a force in\r\npursuit, who inflicted further punishment on the fugitives and returned\r\nthe next day without loss of a man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Scholtz’s official report of this expedition contains the\r\nfollowing remarkable statement regarding the looting of Doctor\r\nLivingstone’s house:\r\n\r\n\r\n“On the 1st of September I dispatched Commandant P. Schutte with a\r\npatrol to Secheli’s old town; but he found it evacuated, and the\r\nmissionary residence broken open by the Kaffirs. The commandant found,\r\nhowever, two percussion rifles; and the Kaffir prisoners declared that\r\nLivingstone’s house, which was still locked, contained ammunition, and\r\nthat shortly before he had exchanged thirteen guns with Secheli, which\r\nI had also learnt two weeks previously, the missionaries Inglis and\r\nEdwards having related it to the burghers, A. Bytel and J. Synman; and\r\nthat Livingstone’s house had been broken open by Secheli to get powder\r\nand lead. I therefore resolved to open the house that was still locked,\r\nin which we found several half-finished guns and a gunmaker’s shop with\r\nabundance of tools. We here found more guns and tools than Bibles, so\r\nthat the place had more the appearance of a gunmaker’s shop than a\r\nmission-station, and more of a smuggling-shop than a school place.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Livingstone’s character is too well known in all the civilized\r\nworld to need even a word of vindication. General Scholtz, being taken\r\nas sincere in his statements, fell into an egregious and well-nigh\r\ninexcusable error concerning the tools found in the doctor’s house and\r\nthe guns in various stages of completeness. In those parts, so distant\r\nfrom carpenters, wagon-makers and smiths, it was absolutely necessary\r\nfor the explorer to have with him all tools required in making or\r\nrepairing wagons, harness, guns, and whatever else belonged to his\r\noutfit. It is impossible to account for General Scholtz’s statements\r\nconcerning the altogether blameless Doctor Livingstone in any other way\r\nthan to ascribe them to prejudice. It is well known that there was in\r\nthe Africander mind a deep-rooted hostility against the missionaries,\r\nof whom David Livingstone was chief, because they denounced the\r\npractice of slavery and reported the cruelties incident to it. Had\r\nGeneral Scholtz been entirely free from the prejudice due to this cause\r\nhe would have seen on Doctor Livingstone’s premises not an illicit gun\r\nfactory, but an honest repair shop such as any pioneer in those parts\r\nmust have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE INDEPENDENT AFRICANDER AND SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the conventions of 1852 and 1854, by which\r\nthe absolute independence of the Africanders living beyond the Vaal\r\nRiver and of those resident in the Orange River district was\r\nguaranteed, bound them to renounce the practice of slavery. They did\r\nnot find it easy, however, to keep either the letter or the spirit of\r\nthat covenant. For generations both the men and the women had been\r\naccustomed to immunity from the more severe and disagreeable work of\r\nlife. Twice had they trekked, largely to get away from British power\r\nbecause it would no longer tolerate slavery on British soil. But now\r\nthey had accepted independent national life, and were in honor bound to\r\ncarry out the stipulation of the treaties which guaranteed their\r\nindependence, by liberating such slaves as they possessed and by\r\nacquiring no more. It is next in order, therefore, to consider the\r\nmanner in which these obligations were carried out.\r\n\r\nWhatever outward appearances there may have been of ceasing to enforce\r\nservitude from the blacks, there is indubitable evidence that little\r\nmore than a change of name for it was effected—the thing went on. A new\r\nsystem of virtual slavery was invented and prevailed extensively under\r\nthe plausible name of “apprenticeship,” and “registration” of prisoners\r\ntaken in war with the natives; and it is to be feared that many\r\npredatory expeditions were undertaken chiefly to secure fresh victims\r\nfor this new method of enforcing unpaid service—all of which was in\r\nflagrant violation of the treaties by which the republics were\r\nestablished and guaranteed independence.\r\n\r\nThe new system was defended by those who devised it and profited by it,\r\nas a benevolent institution, because it took the orphan children of the\r\nKaffirs—for whom their own people made no provision—and apprenticed\r\nthem to Africander masters for a limited period, to terminate in every\r\ncase at twenty-one years of age. But when it is understood that in many\r\ncases the Kaffir bond-children had been made orphans by Africander\r\nbullets the benevolence of the institution becomes a vanishing\r\nquantity. And it is to be remembered, in judging of this matter, that\r\nthese ignorant Kaffir apprentices had no means of knowing their own\r\nage, nor was there any one to speak and act for them when the proper\r\ntime for their release from bondage came. The new system was slavery\r\nunder a less repulsive name, and was so regarded by its victims.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to the Africanders to trace their conduct in this\r\nmatter back to the convictions and principles honestly held by them,\r\nand by which they justified to themselves their practices toward the\r\nnatives. Almost without exception they were men of intense\r\nreligiousness and devout regard for the Bible. It was a great\r\nmisfortune to themselves and to the natives of South Africa that they\r\nfound their standard of ethics, not in any of the moral precepts of the\r\nNew Testament or the Old, but in their own deductions from scraps of\r\nOld Testament history which were never intended to furnish ideals and\r\nstandards of virtue and righteousness for later generations. Thus, they\r\nlooked upon the dark races about them as the yet “accursed” sons of\r\nCanaan the son of Ham, doomed by heaven to perpetual servitude to any\r\npeople who might care to enslave them, because of the sin of their\r\nforefather, Ham. They seem to have forgotten, too easily, that the\r\ndivine entail of evil consequences to follow certain sins was limited\r\nto “the third and fourth generation,” and insisted without warrant of\r\nany kind on bringing it over to and enforcing it upon the one hundred\r\nand thirtieth generation. Holding such views, they considered\r\nthemselves as doing service to God when they inflicted the\r\ndegradations, hardships and cruelties of slavery upon the offspring of\r\nHam. It was their custom to meet for prayer before going on one of\r\ntheir forays, to implore the help and protection of the Almighty in\r\nwhat they were about to do; then they went forth heartened and\r\nemboldened by the conviction that the coming battle was the Lords, and\r\nto fall therein would be a sure passport to heaven. It would be untrue\r\nto say that all the Africanders were of this belief and practice, but\r\nundoubtedly the majority of them so believed and so acted.\r\n\r\nMany of the whites quarreled with their ministers because they\r\npersisted in teaching Christianity to the people held to be accursed—by\r\ntheir masters. The Dutch term Zendeling, originally signifying\r\n“missionary,” was turned into an epithet of reproach, bearing the new\r\ninterpretation of a petty artisan and pedlar, who, under pretense of\r\ninstructing the natives, wandered about prosecuting a secular business\r\nfor gain—a man to be despised and shunned.\r\n\r\nInstances are not wanting in the records of this period to show that\r\nthe spirit and practice of some Africanders were as set forth above.\r\nMr. Holden, in the appendix to his “History of Natal,” quotes from a\r\nfriend of the enslaved blacks as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “As to slavery, in spite of the treaty with the Assistant\r\n    Commissioner, two Kaffir boys have this very week been sold\r\n    here—the one for a hundred rix-dollars to a Boer, and the other for\r\n    a hundred and fifty rix-dollars to a dealer at Rustenburg. Last\r\n    month, also, two were sold to Messrs. S. and G. Maritz, traders of\r\n    Natal, and were immediately ‘booked’ (ingeboekt) with the Landdrost\r\n    of Potchefstroom for twenty-five years each! Is this according to\r\n    treaty? If not, why does not Governor Cathcart interfere by force,\r\n    if reasoning be unavailing? For, without some force, I see little\r\n    prospect of the natives being saved from utter and universal\r\n    slavery.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Holden also quotes from the “Grahamstown Journal” of September 24,\r\n1853, the following significant incident:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “We are credibly informed that, in a private interview with Sir G.\r\n    R. Clark, one of the most respectable and loyal Boers, resident on\r\n    a confiscated farm in the most disaffected district, ‘inter alias\r\n    res,’ plainly told Sir George that he had some twenty or thirty\r\n    Bushman children on his place; and that if government withdrew he\r\n    must sell them, as, if he did not do so, other persons would come\r\n    and take them, and sell them. The reply, as stated to us, was to\r\n    the effect, ‘You have been too long a good subject to lead me to\r\n    think you would do such a thing now.’ To this the answer was, ‘I\r\n    have been a good subject; but if government will make me a rascal,\r\n    I cannot help it’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese testimonies coming from separate and widely distant sources, and\r\ngiving the particulars of direct and positive slavery practiced under\r\nanother name, leave no reasonable doubt that the spirit of the compact\r\nbetween the British government and the Africanders was being violated.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that the account of the same matter given by Mr.\r\nTheal, in his “South Africa,” puts an entirely different aspect on the\r\npractice of “apprenticeship.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   “At this time,” he writes (1857), “complaints were beginning to be\r\n    heard that the practice of transferring apprentices, or selling\r\n    indentures, was becoming frequent. It was rumored also that several\r\n    lawless individuals were engaged in obtaining black children from\r\n    neighboring tribes, and disposing of them under the name of\r\n    apprentices. How many such cases occurred cannot be stated with any\r\n    pretension to accuracy, but the number was not great. The condition\r\n    of the country made it almost impossible to detain any one capable\r\n    of performing service longer than he chose to remain with a white\r\n    master, so that even if the farmers in general had been inclined to\r\n    become slaveholders, they could not carry such inclinations into\r\n    practice. The acts of a few of the most unruly individuals in the\r\n    country might, however, endanger the peace and even the\r\n    independence of the republic. The president, therefore, on the 29th\r\n    of September, 1857, issued a proclamation pointing out that the\r\n    sale or barter of black children was forbidden by the recently\r\n    adopted constitution, and prohibiting transfers of apprenticeships,\r\n    except when made before landdrosts.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTreating of a later period (1864–65), he returns to this matter,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “A subject that was much discussed in Europe, as well as in South\r\n    Africa, during this period was the existence of slavery in the\r\n    republic. Charges against the burghers of reducing weak and\r\n    helpless blacks to a condition of servitude were numerous and\r\n    boldly stated on one side, and were indignantly denied on the\r\n    other. That the laws were clearly against slavery goes for nothing,\r\n    because in a time of anarchy law is a dead letter. There is\r\n    overwhelming evidence that blacks were transferred openly from one\r\n    individual to another, and there are the strongest assertions from\r\n    men of undoubted integrity that there was no slavery. To people in\r\n    Europe it seemed impossible that both should be true, and the\r\n    opinion was generally held that the farmers of the interior of\r\n    South Africa were certainly slave-holders.\r\n\r\n   “Since 1877 much concerning this matter that was previously\r\n    doubtful has been set at rest. On the 12th of April of that year\r\n    the South African republic was proclaimed British territory, and\r\n    when, soon afterward, investigation was made, not a single slave\r\n    was set free, because there was not one in the country. In the very\r\n    heart of the territory kraals of blacks were found in as prosperous\r\n    a condition as in any part of South Africa. It was ascertained that\r\n    these blacks had always lived in peace with the white inhabitants,\r\n    and that they had no complaints to make. Quite as strong was the\r\n    evidence afforded by the number of the Bantu. In 1877 there were,\r\n    at the lowest estimate, six times as many black people living in a\r\n    state of semi-independence within the borders of the South African\r\n    Republic as there had been on the same ground forty years before.\r\n    Surely these people would not have moved in if the character of the\r\n    burghers was such as most Englishmen believed it to be. A statement\r\n    of actual facts is thus much more likely now to gain credence\r\n    abroad than would have been the case in 1864.\r\n\r\n   “The individuals who were termed slaves by the missionary party\r\n    were termed apprentices by the farmers. The great majority—probably\r\n    nineteen out of every twenty—were children who had been made\r\n    prisoners in the wars which the tribes were continually waging with\r\n    each other. In olden days it had been the custom for the conquering\r\n    tribe to put all the conquered to death, except the girls and a few\r\n    boys who could be made useful as carriers. More recently they had\r\n    become less inhuman, from having found out that for smaller\r\n    children they could obtain beads and other merchandise.\r\n\r\n   “With a number of tribes bordering on the republic ready to sell\r\n    their captives, with the Betshuana everywhere prepared to dispose\r\n    of the children of their hereditary slaves, a few adventurous\r\n    Europeans were found willing to embark in the odious traffic. Wagon\r\n    loads of children were brought into the republic, where they were\r\n    apprenticed for a term of years to the first holder, and the deeds\r\n    of apprenticeship could afterward be transferred before a\r\n    landdrost. This was the slavery of the South African Republic. Its\r\n    equivalent was to be found a few years earlier in the Cape colony,\r\n    when negroes taken in slave-ships were apprenticed to individuals.\r\n    There would have been danger in the system if the demand for\r\n    apprentices had been greater. In that case the tribes might have\r\n    attacked each other purposely to obtain captives for sale. But the\r\n    demand was very limited, for the service of a raw black apprentice\r\n    was of no great value. A herd boy might be worth something more\r\n    than his food, clothing, and a few head of cattle which were given\r\n    him when his apprenticeship expired; but no other class of raw\r\n    native was.\r\n\r\n   “It is an open question whether it was better that these children\r\n    should remain with the destroyers of their parents, and according\r\n    to chance grow up either as slaves or as adopted members of the\r\n    conquering tribe; or that they should serve ten or fifteen years as\r\n    apprentices to white people, acquire some of the habits of European\r\n    life, and then settle down as freemen with a little property. It\r\n    was answered in 1864, and will be answered to-day according to the\r\n    bias of the individual.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, Mr. Theal’s account of it does not materially change the\r\naspect of the system of enforced servitude that prevailed in the\r\nAfricander communities after they became independent. These\r\nbond-children were either captured or bought from dealers in children;\r\nthey were held under bill of sale and indenture; and they were sold\r\nfrom master to master by legal transfer of indenture before a\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Theal’s low estimate of the value of the services that could be\r\nrendered by raw black children, and of the limited demand for them, is\r\nnot in harmony with his own statement that such children were brought\r\ninto the republic in wagon loads, nor with the testimony, quoted by Mr.\r\nHolden, covering two specific cases wherein one Kaffir boy was sold for\r\none hundred, and another for one hundred and fifty rix-dollars. And his\r\naverment that in 1877 the British authorities could not find a single\r\nslave to liberate in all the territory of the South African Republic is\r\nsimply amusing when viewed in the light of what he states on the next\r\npage—that this system of enforced servitude under indentures that were\r\nlegally merchantable “was the slavery of the South African Republic.”\r\nUndoubtedly; and, so far as is known, no other form of slavery was ever\r\nseriously charged against the Africanders after their independence was\r\nestablished. It is matter of surprise, however, that the British\r\nconscience of this period was not able to scent the malodor of slavery\r\nunder the new form and title of “apprenticeship” which covered a\r\nmarketable property-right in the human chattel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CONTACT OF AFRICANDER AND BRITON—IN THE ORANGE FREE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Great Trek” of 1836 and 1838 removed from the old colony at the\r\nCape an element in the population which, however worthy in some\r\nregards, was unrestful and disaffected, leaving abundant room for a new\r\nimmigration from Europe. It was some years, however, before there was\r\nany considerable influx from continental Europe. Judged by the grim\r\nrumors that were afloat everywhere, South Africa was a dangerous\r\ncountry to live in because of the warlike and merciless Kaffirs; and\r\nthe trend of British emigration was yet towards America.\r\n\r\nAbout 1845 the tide of fortune-seeking people was turned towards Cape\r\nColony. The British government of this time stimulated immigration to\r\nthat field so liberally that in five years between four and five\r\nthousand loyal subjects from the mother country removed to the Cape.\r\nLater, a considerable number of disbanded German soldiers who had\r\nserved under the British colors in the Crimean war were sent there as\r\ncitizens, and in 1858 over two thousand German civilians of the peasant\r\norder were settled along the south coast on lands once occupied by the\r\nKaffirs.\r\n\r\nIndustries natural to the climate and soil were slowly but steadily\r\ndeveloped. Sheep and cattle raising, and agriculture to a limited\r\nextent, became sources of wealth, and correspondingly expanded the\r\nexport trade. Public finances were gradually restored to a healthy\r\nstate, churches and schools sprang up, and there was no serious\r\ndrawback to the progress of the colony but the frequent Kaffir\r\ninvasions across the eastern border. These cost much loss of life and\r\nproperty to the raided settlements, but the expense of the resulting\r\nwars was borne by the home government. Under British rule the\r\npopulation had increased from 26,000 Europeans in 1806 to 182,000 in\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of population there came changes in the form of\r\ngovernment. The earlier governors exercised almost autocratic power,\r\nfearing nothing but a possible appeal against their acts to the\r\nColonial Office in London. It should be stated, however, that the\r\ncolonists found as frequent cause to complain of the home government as\r\nof their governors. The occasional irritation which broke out into open\r\nprotest was caused, for the most part, by difficulties with the\r\nnatives. The Europeans, dwelling among an inferior race, naturally\r\nlooked upon the natives as existing for their benefit, and bitterly\r\nresented the disposition of both the imperial authorities and the\r\ngovernors to give equal civil rights and protection to the blacks. The\r\nmissionaries were the special objects of this resentment, because they\r\nheld themselves bound by their sacred office to denounce the wrongs\r\ninflicted on the Kaffirs, and to even defend their conduct in rebelling\r\nagainst oppression.\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate dissensions had the effect of uniting the English and\r\nthe Dutch colonists in questions of policy and government regarding the\r\nnatives. After various attempts to satisfy the people with a governor\r\nappointed by the crown and a Legislative Council constituted by the\r\ngovernor’s nomination and imperial appointment, the home authorities,\r\nin 1854, yielded to the public demand for representative institutions.\r\n\r\nA legislature, consisting of a Legislative Council and a House of\r\nAssembly, was established, both to be elected on a franchise wide\r\nenough to include people of any race or color holding the reasonable\r\nproperty qualification. The sole check upon the colonial legislature\r\nretained by the imperial government was the right of the British crown\r\nto disallow any of its acts considered objectionable, on constitutional\r\nor other grounds, by her Majesty’s ministers. The executive power\r\nremained, for a time, with the governor and his council, who were\r\nappointed by the crown and in no way responsible to the colonial\r\nhouses. Later, the executive power was taken from the governors and\r\nvested in a cabinet of ministers responsible to the colonial\r\nlegislature and holding office during its pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe range of industries followed by the people of Cape Colony was not\r\nenlarged until the discovery of diamonds in 1869. This brought in a\r\nsudden rush of population from Europe and America and so inflated trade\r\nthat the colonial revenue was more than doubled in the next five years.\r\nThen began that unparalleled development of mineral resources in South\r\nAfrica which created immense wealth and furnished the elements of a\r\npolitical situation whose outcome the wisest cannot foresee.\r\n\r\nWith this general view of the condition of Cape Colony in the three\r\ndecades succeeding the Great Trek of the Africanders, we turn again to\r\nthe special study proposed and consider the chain of events that led up\r\nto the third unfriendly contact between Boer and Briton—this time\r\nbeginning in the Orange Free State.\r\n\r\nBy the conventions of 1852 and 1854 Great Britain formally relinquished\r\nall claim to that part of the interior of South Africa lying to the\r\nnorth of Cape Colony, and recognized the republics of the Orange Free\r\nState and the Transvaal. There can be no doubt of the sincerity of the\r\nBritish government in taking this action. The prevailing desires\r\nactuating both the parliament and the executive were to be rid of the\r\nresponsibility and expense of governing these regions, and to leave the\r\ntwo new Africander republics to work out their own destiny in their own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nFor a few years the relations of the Cape government and its northern\r\nneighbors were friendly. The first occurrence that disturbed the\r\nwelcome peace and harmony was a serious war which broke out in 1858\r\nbetween the Basutos under Moshesh and the Orange Free State. The\r\nBasutos laid claim to certain farms, held under English titles, in\r\nHarrismith, Wynberg and Smithfield districts. These were taken\r\npossession of by the petty Basuto captains, and when attempts were made\r\nto eject the intruders, Moshesh, the paramount chief, and his eldest\r\nson Letsie, assumed the right to interfere. This episode, together with\r\nother unfriendly acts on the part of the Basutos, brought on a\r\ncondition which, it became evident, nothing but war could remedy.\r\nAccordingly, the Volksraad of the Orange Free State authorized the\r\nPresident, Mr. Boshof, to take any steps necessary to prevent intrusion\r\nupon the territory of the State. After much and very insincere\r\ndiplomatic correspondence, the time of which was used by the Free State\r\ngovernment in collecting the forces of its western and northern\r\ndivisions, and by the Basutos in assembling their warriors, petty raids\r\nbegan the conflict and led on to hostilities on a larger scale near the\r\nend of March, 1858.\r\n\r\nBy the 26th of April Mr. Boshof became convinced that the Free State\r\ncould not hold its own against the Basutos, and that the salvation of\r\nthe country from being overrun by its enemies depended upon obtaining\r\naid from some quarter. Acting on this conviction, on the 24th of April\r\nMr. Boshof wrote Sir George Grey, governor of Cape Colony, informing\r\nhim of the critical condition of the Free State, and imploring his\r\nmediation. Sir George, after obtaining the sanction of the House\r\nAssembly to such a course, immediately tendered his services as\r\nmediator to Mr. Boshof and Moshesh, and was unconditionally and\r\ncordially accepted by both. Thereupon a cessation of hostilities was\r\nagreed to pending the arrangement of final terms of peace by Sir\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Free State was being ravaged on its western border\r\nby petty chiefs, who saw in the struggle between the whites and the\r\npowerful Basutos a favorable opportunity to enrich themselves with\r\nspoil. In the distress occasioned by these forays the Free State was\r\naided by a force of burghers from the Transvaal Republic, under\r\nCommandant Paul Kruger.\r\n\r\nOut of this friendly act there grew up a desire and even a proposition\r\nto unite the two republics in one. President Pretorius, Commandant Paul\r\nKruger, and about twenty other representatives from the Transvaal\r\nvisited Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State Volksraad on the\r\nmatter of union—a measure considered by many the only means of saving\r\nthe country from its savage foes.\r\n\r\nWhile the conference on union was in progress there arrived, on the\r\n11th of June, a letter from Sir George Grey announcing that in case an\r\nagreement to unite the two republics were concluded, the conventions of\r\n1852 and 1854—guaranteeing their separate independence—would no longer\r\nbe considered binding by Great Britain. Undoubtedly this action evinced\r\na desire, not to say a determination, that the Free State should find\r\nsafety not by union with the sister republic to the north, but by\r\ncoming again under British sovereignty and forming one of a group of\r\ncolonies to be united in a great British Dominion in South Africa. The\r\nnegotiations for union were dropped on the receipt of Sir George’s\r\nletter, and both parties resolved to appoint commissioners to confer\r\nwith him after peace with the Basutos should be arranged.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 20th of August that Sir George Grey arrived at\r\nBloemfontein to act as mediator between Moshesh and the Free State.\r\nWhile preliminaries were being discussed the governor received urgent\r\ndispatches from London ordering him to send all available troops to\r\nIndia, where the Sepoy rebellion was raging. It became, therefore, a\r\nmatter of supreme importance to establish peace between the Free State\r\nand the Basutos at once—for not a soldier could safely be spared until\r\nthat was accomplished. On the 29th of September the treaty was\r\ncompleted and signed. It settled a new frontier for the Free State next\r\nto Basutoland, and bound Moshesh to either punish marauders of his\r\npeople himself, or consent that the Free State authorities should do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThis peace lasted only seven years. In 1865 new troubles arose leading\r\nto a renewal of war between the Free State and Moshesh. Again the\r\ngovernor of Cape Colony acted as mediator, but his decisions were\r\nrejected by the Basutos, and new hostilities began. This time, by a\r\nheroic effort made in 1868, the whites defeated and scattered the\r\nBasutos with great slaughter, and were at the point of utterly breaking\r\ntheir power, when the always politic Moshesh appealed to the British\r\nHigh Commissioner at the Cape to take his people under British\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner doubtless considered the interests of Cape Colony\r\nwhich, in the event of a dispersion of the Basutos, might be overrun by\r\nthe fugitives, and suffer injury thereby. And it is evident that he was\r\nunwilling that the Free State should strengthen itself, beyond the\r\nnecessity of ever seeking readmission to the British dominions, by the\r\nannexation of Basutoland. So, looking to the safety of the old colony,\r\nand to the hope of some day adding thereto the Orange Free State, the\r\ncommissioner took the defeated Basutos under the wing of the imperial\r\ngovernment and declared them British subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Free State was allowed to retain a considerable area of good land\r\nwhich it had conquered on the north side of the Caledon River, but the\r\nadjustment reached was anything but satisfactory. The British had now\r\nestablished their authority to the south of the republic all the way\r\nfrom Cape Colony to Natal, and, thus, had extinguished a second time\r\nthe persistent Africander hope of extending their territory to the sea.\r\nThus, in 1869, recommenced the British advance toward the interior.\r\n\r\nAnother momentous step towards enlarging the sphere of British\r\ninfluence was taken almost immediately. Diamonds were discovered in\r\n1869, in a district lying between the Modder and the Vaal rivers, where\r\nthe present town of Kimberley stands. Within a few months thousands of\r\ndiggers and speculators from all parts of South Africa, Europe,\r\nAmerica, and from some parts of Asia, thronged into the region and\r\ntransformed it into a place of surpassing value and interest. The\r\nquestion of ownership was raised at once. The Orange Free State claimed\r\nit. The Transvaal Republic claimed it. It was claimed by Nicholas\r\nWaterboer, a Griqua captain, son of old Andries Waterboer; his claim\r\nbeing based on an abortive treaty made with the elder Waterboer in\r\n1834, when, at Doctor Philip’s suggestion, the attempt was made to\r\ninterpose between the old colony and the northern populations a line of\r\nthree native states under British protection. And it was claimed by a\r\nnative Batlapin chief.\r\n\r\nThree of these claimant—the Transvaal Republic, Nicholas Waterboer for\r\nthe Griquas, and the Batlapin chief for his clan—agreed to settle the\r\nconflict by arbitration, naming the governor of Natal as arbitrator.\r\nThe governor promptly awarded the disputed ownership to Nicholas\r\nWaterboer the Griqua, who as promptly placed himself under the British\r\ngovernment, which, with equal promptitude, constituted the district a\r\ncrown colony under the name of Griqualand. The Orange Free State, not\r\nhaving been a party to the arbitration, protested, and was afterwards\r\nsustained by the decision of a British court, which found that\r\nWaterboer’s claim to the territory was null and void. But the colony\r\nhad been constituted and the British flag unfurled over it before the\r\nfinding of the court could stay proceedings.\r\n\r\nWithout admitting or denying the Free State’s contention, the British\r\ngovernment obtained a quitclaim title for a money consideration. It was\r\nrepresented that a district so difficult to keep in order, because of\r\nthe transient and turbulent character of the population, should be\r\nunder the control of a more vigorous government than that of the Free\r\nState. Finally, the British offered and the Free State authorities\r\naccepted, £90,000 in settlement of any claim the republic might have to\r\nthe territory of Griqualand.\r\n\r\nThe incident closed with the payment and acceptance, in 1876, of the\r\nprice agreed upon. But the Africanders of the Free State had the\r\nfeeling at the time—and it never ceased to rankle in their breasts—that\r\nthey had been made the victims of sharp practice; that the\r\ndiamond-bearing territory had been rushed into the possession of the\r\nBritish and made a crown colony without giving them a fair opportunity\r\nto prove their claim to it; and that, while the price offered and paid\r\nwas a tacit recognition of the validity of their claim, it was so\r\ninfinitesimal in proportion to the rights conveyed as to imply that in\r\nBritish practice not only is possession nine points in ten of the law\r\nbut that it also justifies the holder in keeping back nine parts out of\r\nten of the value.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only British grievance complained of at this time by\r\nthe Free State. The project of uniting the two republics for greater\r\nstrength and mutual safety had been vetoed for no apparent reason than\r\nto keep them weak so that they might the sooner become willing to\r\nre-enter the British dominions in South Africa. And the British High\r\nCommissioner at the Cape had taken the vanquished Basutos and their\r\nterritory under imperial protection at the moment when the victorious\r\nFree State was about to reduce them to permanent submission, and to\r\nextend its territory to the sea—again interposing the arm of Great\r\nBritain to prevent the strengthening of the republic by its proposed\r\nacquisition of Basutoland and the gaining of a seaport at the mouth of\r\nthe St. John River.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Orange Free State accepted the situation\r\nphilosophically and, outwardly, continued on friendly terms with the\r\nBritish government until the outbreak of war between that power and the\r\nAfricanders of the Transvaal in 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHIRD CONTACT OF AFRICANDER AND BRITON—IN THE TRANSVAAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aggressive policy of the British, which had served to widen and\r\ndeepen the breach between them and the Africanders of the Free State,\r\nwas felt in the Transvaal Republic, also, and led to an open rupture in\r\n1880. It will be necessary to trace somewhat carefully the conditions\r\nand events which brought on that conflict.\r\n\r\nThe Africanders who had settled beyond the Vaal River were of a ruder\r\nsort than their brethren of the Orange River district. Moreover, the\r\nreckless, unprincipled, and even criminal classes were attracted to the\r\nTransvaal from various parts of South Africa, seeking freedom from the\r\nrestraints experienced under the stricter government prevailing in the\r\nBritish colonies. These occasioned much scandal, and provoked many\r\nconflicts with the Kaffirs by their lawlessness and violence along the\r\nborder and in the wilder districts of the territory.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of the Vaal in a general way considered themselves one\r\npeople, but had become grouped in several districts separated by\r\nconsiderable distances. Thus, in 1852, there were four separate\r\ncommunities—Potchefstroom, Utrecht, Lyndenburg, and Zoutspansberg, each\r\nhaving its volksraad and president. There was no co-ordinate action of\r\nthe whole for internal administration and public improvement, but for\r\ndefense against the natives there was a sort of federative union—more a\r\nmatter of mutual understanding and consent than of loyalty to a formal\r\nwritten document. That there was occasional independent action by a\r\nsingle community in reference to outside matters is evident from the\r\ninvasion of the Orange Free State by the people of the Potchefstroom\r\ndistrict in 1857, under the leadership of Mr. Pretorius. The object was\r\nto conquer the Free State, and was abandoned only when it was found\r\nthat the young sister republic was disposed and prepared to defend\r\nitself. This invasion resulted in a treaty by which the independence,\r\nboundaries and mutual obligations of the two republics were fully\r\ndefined and recognized.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 a single volksraad was chosen for all the four districts north\r\nof the Vaal, and the “Grondwet” on Fundamental Law—an instrument in the\r\nnature of a federal constitution—was prepared by delegates specially\r\nelected for that purpose. This was adopted at once by Potchefstroom and\r\nZoutspansberg. In 1860 Lyndenburg and Utrecht followed their example.\r\nAlthough it has been contended that the “Grondwet” is not to be\r\nregarded as a fixed constitution, like that of the United States of\r\nAmerica, the people of the Transvaal have looked upon it as a\r\nsufficient federative bond for the union of the four semi-independent\r\ndistricts in one nationality. The practical union of all was delayed,\r\nhowever, by a civil war which broke out in 1862, and had a most\r\ndisastrous influence on the future of the country.\r\n\r\nThis internal strife grew out of the election of the president of the\r\nTransvaal Republic, the younger Pretorius, to the presidency of the\r\nOrange Free State. It was hoped by his partisans in both republics that\r\nthe dual presidency would help to bring about the desired union of the\r\nFree State and the Transvaal under one government. While Mr. Pretorius\r\nwas absent in the Free State, on a six months’ leave granted by the\r\nvolksraad of the Transvaal, a faction hostile to him began to protest\r\nagainst this double dignity being enjoyed by any one man, and to argue\r\nthat the advantages of union would be largely with the Free State.\r\nHostility to Mr. Pretorius grew apace until it was strong enough to get\r\na resolution passed in the volksraad forbidding him to perform any\r\nexecutive act north of the Vaal during the six months of his stay in\r\nthe Free State, and requiring him to give an account of his proceedings\r\nat the expiration of his leave.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September, 1860, Mr. Pretorius appeared before the\r\nvolksraad of the Transvaal, accompanied by a commission from the Free\r\nState appointed to ask for a further leave of absence for the\r\npresident, and to further the interests of union. When Pretorius\r\noffered to give an account of his proceedings as president of the Free\r\nState, the opposition raised the point that it was manifestly illegal\r\nfor any one to be president of the Transvaal Republic and of the Orange\r\nFree State at the same time, for it was provided in their constitution\r\nthat during his term of office the president should follow no other\r\noccupation, and Mr. Pretorius was pressed to resign one office or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nPretorius at once resigned the presidency of the Transvaal; but his\r\npartisans held a mass meeting at Potchefstroom, on the 8th and 9th of\r\nOctober, at which revolutionary proceedings were taken. It was\r\nresolved, almost unanimously, that the volksraad no longer enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the people they represented and must be held as having\r\nceased to exist; that Mr. Pretorius should remain president of the\r\nTransvaal Republic and have a year’s leave of absence to bring about\r\nunion with the Free State, Mr. Stephanas Schoeman—instead of Mr.\r\nGrobbelear—to be acting president during his absence; and that before\r\nthe return of Mr. Pretorius to resume his duties a new volksraad should\r\nbe elected.\r\n\r\nThe new election was so manipulated that only a thousand burghers\r\nvoted, and of these more than seven hundred declared in favor of the\r\nresolutions of the Potchefstroom meeting. The committee that effected\r\nthis clever political strategy was composed of Messrs. D. Steyn,\r\nPreller, Lombard, Spruyt, and Bodenstein. The new acting president, Mr.\r\nSchoeman, assumed official duty immediately.\r\n\r\nWith amazing inconsistency—for he was thought to be a loyal friend of\r\nMr. Pretorius—Schoeman called a meeting of the old volksraad that had\r\nbeen dissolved by the revolution. He held his office from the same\r\nauthority that had declared this body to have forfeited confidence, and\r\nto be non-existent, and yet he acknowledged its legal existence. The\r\nold volksraad met on the 14th of January, 1861, and after a session of\r\ntwo hours the majority of the members resigned, being convinced of the\r\ngeneral antagonism of the people. Not content to let matters rest in a\r\npeaceful acquiescence in the revolution, Mr. Schoeman called the old\r\nvolksraad together a second time, under armed protection, and procured\r\nan order for legal proceedings to be instituted against the committee\r\nthat had carried out the Potchefstroom resolutions. A court consisting\r\nof two landdrosts—one of whom was Cornelius Potgieter, their bitterest\r\npolitical enemy—tried the committee for sedition, on the 14th of\r\nFebruary, found them guilty and sentenced each to pay a fine of £100,\r\nexcept Mr. Bodenstein, whose fine was only £15.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings led to great disturbances throughout the republic,\r\nand, finally, to war. Schoeman assembled an armed force to support his\r\nauthority. Thereupon, Commandant Paul Kruger, of Rustenburg, called out\r\nthe burghers of his district and marched to Pretoria for the purpose of\r\ndriving out Schoeman and establishing a better government.\r\n\r\nAmong the expedients resorted to to prevent bloodshed, a new volksraad\r\nwas elected, a new acting president was appointed, and for several\r\nmonths there were two rival governments in the Transvaal. Acting\r\nPresident Schoeman, supported by a strong party, persisted in endeavors\r\nto rule the country. So grievous a state of anarchy prevailed that\r\nKruger resolved to put an end to it by the strong hand. Schoeman and\r\nhis partisans retreated from Pretoria to Potchefstroom, where he was\r\nbesieged by the burgher force under Kruger. The loss of life in the\r\nbombardment, and one sortie by the garrison, was not great; but\r\nSchoeman became disheartened and fled, on the night of the 9th of\r\nOctober, into the Free State, accompanied by his principal adherents.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Kruger having moved his force to Klip River, Schoeman\r\nre-entered Potchefstroom, rallied some eight hundred men around him,\r\nand Kruger returned to give him battle. At this critical point\r\nPresident Pretorius interposed as mediator, and an agreement was\r\nreached by which immediate hostilities were prevented. Schoeman,\r\nhowever, continued to agitate.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of agreement new elections were held by which W. C.\r\nJanse Van Rensburg was chosen president over Mr. Pretorius, and Paul\r\nKruger was made Commandant-General.\r\n\r\nBut the tribulations of the Transvaal were by no means over. On the\r\npretense that the ballot papers had been tampered with the standard of\r\nrevolt was again raised—this time by Jan Viljoen. The first encounter\r\nwas against Kruger, who had underestimated the strength of the new\r\nrebellion. Later, on the 5th of January, 1864, a battle was fought in\r\nwhich Viljoen was defeated and compelled to retreat to a fortified camp\r\non the Limpopo.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Pretorius offered himself as mediator, and by common consent\r\na new election was held in which Pretorius was chosen president by a\r\nlarge majority over Van Rensburg. With Pretorius as president, and Paul\r\nKruger as commandant-general, the government was of such harmony and\r\nstrength as prevented any further open rebellion on the part of\r\ndisaffected burghers.\r\n\r\nBut though the civil strife was ended, the injury it had inflicted was\r\nwell nigh incurable. It is to be reckoned chief among the causes of the\r\nweakness in after years that made it possible—and, in the judgment of\r\nsome, necessary and justifiable—for the British government to thrust in\r\nits strong hand and subvert the independent but tottering republic that\r\nit might substitute therefor a more stable colonial administration. The\r\ntreasury had been impoverished. Taxes were uncollected and\r\nirrecoverable. Salaries and other public liabilities were heavily in\r\narrears. Worse than all these, the republic had forfeited the\r\nconfidence of other nations to that degree that no one believed in its\r\nstability. Even its nearest neighbor and sister republic, the Orange\r\nFree State, no longer desired union, preferring to stand alone before\r\nthe constant menace of the Basutos rather than to be joined with a\r\ncountry wherein efficient government seemed to have perished. To make\r\nmatters still worse, the discord among the whites was turned to\r\nadvantage by their colored foes.\r\n\r\nWhen the several factions in the Transvaal united on Mr. Pretorius as\r\ntheir executive head, in 1864, the white population, all told, did not\r\nexceed 30,000—less than one person to three square miles—while the\r\nblacks in the same territory numbered hundreds of thousands. During the\r\nthree years succeeding 1861 the prevailing anarchy made it impossible\r\nto give attention to cessions of land agreed to by the Zulu chiefs. In\r\nconsequence, the boundaries had not been fixed, and these districts\r\nremained unoccupied by the whites. With the restoration of something\r\nlike order in 1864, the government realized that its relations with\r\nsome of its native neighbors required definition and formal settlement.\r\nThis was successfully done, and the lines mutually agreed upon between\r\nthe whites and the native authorities were duly marked.\r\n\r\nA leading spirit among the Zulus of this time was Cetawayo, a chief of\r\nremarkable subtlety and power. In less than two months after the\r\nsettlement and marking of boundaries in the southern region of the\r\nTransvaal Cetawayo found some pretext for repudiating his bargain,\r\nappeared on the borders of Utrecht at the head of a Zulu army, in\r\nFebruary, 1865, and removed the landmarks so lately set up. During the\r\nnegotiations that followed, Cetawayo did not appear at any conference,\r\nbut the presence of his force on the border so far affected the final\r\nsettlement that the boundary was changed near the Pongolo River,\r\nrestoring a small district in that region to Zululand.\r\n\r\nThis was a time of perpetual struggle with the blacks. Some of the\r\ntribes had been made tributary to the Republic, others were practically\r\nindependent, and with these frequent and cruel wars were waged.\r\nUnspeakable atrocities were perpetrated on both sides—the Kaffirs\r\nslaughtering without mercy such white families as they were able to\r\nsurprise in a defenseless state, and the Africanders inflicting\r\nvengeance without mercy when they came upon the savages in kraal or\r\nmountain stronghold.\r\n\r\nThe whites could always defeat the natives in a pitched battle, but to\r\nhold so vast a number in subjection was beyond their power. And they\r\nseem to have relished everything connected with an expedition against\r\nthe blacks but the expense; they had an invincible dislike to paying\r\ntaxes for any purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a rude way these Transvaal Africanders lived in the enjoyment of\r\nplenty derived from their flocks and herds, but metal currency was\r\nalmost unknown to them. Such business as they transacted was mostly in\r\nthe nature of barter. They were yet too crude and primitive in their\r\nideas to value aright the benefits secured to a civilized community by\r\na well organized and firmly administered government controlling fiscal\r\nand other domestic matters of general interest, as well as directing\r\nforeign policies.\r\n\r\nThe public treasury was in a state of chronic emptiness. The paper\r\ncurrency depreciated more and more till in 1870 its purchasing value\r\nwas only twenty-five per cent of its face value. Public works and\r\nproper internal administration were unknown. Largely, every man’s will\r\nwas his law, which he was disposed to enforce upon others—whether black\r\nor white—by the strong hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Mr. Pretorius became cordially disliked by the people and was\r\nforced to resign the presidency, because he had accepted the finding of\r\nthe arbitration which awarded the diamond fields to Nicholas Waterboer\r\ninstead of to the Transvaal Republic. His successor, Mr. Burgess, a\r\nnative of Cape Colony and an unfrocked clergyman of the Dutch Reformed\r\nChurch, was an unfortunate choice. Learned, eloquent and energetic, he\r\nwas nevertheless deficient in practical business wisdom and in\r\npolitical acumen, and he was much distrusted by the burghers on account\r\nof his theological opinions. Some of them charged that he was guilty of\r\nmaintaining that the real Devil differed from the pictures of him in\r\nthe old Dutch Bibles, in that he had no tail. For this and worse forms\r\nof heterodoxy he was blamed as the cause of the calamities experienced\r\nby the nation during his presidency. Mr. Burgers is said to have formed\r\nmany visionary though patriotic plans for the development of his\r\ncountry and the extension of the Africander power over the whole of\r\nSouth Africa, but his people were not of the sort that could appreciate\r\nthem, nor had he command of resources sufficient to carry them out.\r\n\r\nThen drew near the culmination of evil—the inevitable consequence of\r\nweakness in numbers; of indisposition to submit to a strong government;\r\nof a treasury impoverished by civil war; of continual conflict with the\r\nsavage blacks; and, withal, of a state of anarchy among themselves. In\r\n1876 the portents of approaching calamity multiplied. In a war with\r\nSikukuni, a powerful Kaffir chief paramount in the mountainous district\r\nto the northeast, the Africanders were worsted so completely that they\r\nreturned to their homes disheartened and in confusion. On the southeast\r\ntheir border was threatened by hordes of Zulus under Cetawayo, now\r\nmanifesting a decided disposition to attack.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the weak and disordered condition of the republic exposed its\r\nown people—many of whom were British subjects—to immediate and\r\nfrightful danger. Moreover, it constituted a danger to all the European\r\ncommunities in South Africa. In the event of two such chiefs as\r\nSikukuni and Cetawayo joining forces against the whites and prevailing,\r\nas they seemed able and likely to do, over the frontier civilization in\r\nthe Transvaal Republic, nothing could prevent them from moving in\r\nstrength against the Free State on the south, and Natal on the\r\nsoutheast, and later, against Cape Colony itself.\r\n\r\nIt was not without cause, therefore, that the British government\r\nresolved to avert the threatened conflict. There were two possible ways\r\nof doing this. Britain might have taken the field as a friendly ally,\r\nmaking common cause with the Transvaal Republic against a common\r\ndanger, and leaving its independence intact. The other way was to annex\r\nthe Transvaal territory, subvert its republican government, and give it\r\nthe status and administration of a British colony. There is no record\r\nto show that the British government ever entertained the thought of\r\nacting as the ally of the republic. On the contrary, Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone was appointed as imperial commissioner to visit the scene of\r\ndanger and examine into the state of the country. He was secretly\r\ninstructed and authorized to proclaim the immediate annexation of the\r\nTransvaal territory to the British dominions in South Africa in case he\r\ndeemed it necessary for the general safety to do so, and if, in his\r\njudgment, a majority of the people would favor the step.\r\n\r\nAfter three months spent in observing and studying the situation Sir\r\nTheophilus Shepstone, acting under the secret instructions given him,\r\non the 12th of April, 1877, declared The Transvaal Republic annexed,\r\nfor protection, to British dominions in South Africa. His act was\r\nindorsed officially by the resident British High Commissioner at the\r\nCape, and by the Secretary of the Colonial Office in England. In 1879\r\nthe Territory was declared a crown colony of Great Britain. Thus, in\r\nthe third contact of Boer and Briton, an independent republic was\r\ndeprived of its independence by the self-same power that had guaranteed\r\nit in 1852, and was reduced to the status of a crown colony without the\r\nformal consent of its people and against the protests of many of them.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter of events connected with this arbitrary and\r\nstartling measure, it will be well to consider some further facts which\r\nbelong to the setting in which the act should be viewed. Mr. Burgers,\r\nthe president, had repeatedly warned the people that unless certain\r\nreforms could be effected they must lose their independence. They\r\nagreed with him, but did nothing to carry out the necessary reforms,\r\nnor would they pay taxes. Mr. Burgers was not strong with any party in\r\nthe country. One section of the people were for Paul Kruger, his rival\r\ncandidate for the approaching presidential election. Another\r\nparty—principally English settlers—favored annexation. Besides, he had\r\nestranged the great body of the people by his heterodox opinions in\r\ntheology. Being helpless, Mr. Burgers recorded his personal protest\r\nagainst annexation and returned to the Cape, where he lived on a\r\npension granted him in consideration of his having spent all his\r\nprivate fortune in the service of his country.\r\n\r\nMr. Kruger—then the vice-president, the entire executive council, and\r\nthe volksraad, all protested against the annexation; and delegates were\r\nsent to London to carry the protest to the foot of the British throne.\r\nThe mass of the people made no resistance at the time, nor did they\r\nexpress much displeasure; but, a little later, a large majority of them\r\nsigned a petition praying for a reversal of the act of annexation.\r\nTheir temporary acquiescence in the loss of independence was due, no\r\ndoubt, to the depressing fears that had so lately burdened them, and a\r\nsense of relief in knowing that now the Kaffir invasion that had\r\nthreatened their very existence would be repelled by the military power\r\nof Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICANDERS’ FIRST WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their native love of independence, and their protest to\r\nthe British throne against the act of annexation, the Africanders of\r\nthe Transvaal might have acquiesced in the British rule had they been\r\nfairly treated. There was a good promise of peace at first. The\r\nfinances of the country were at once relieved by the expenditure of\r\nEnglish money in liberal amounts. Numbers of the leading Africanders\r\nretained their official positions at the request of the British\r\ncommissioner, Sir Theophilus Shepstone. It is only reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the people at large would have settled down to permanent\r\ncontent as British subjects had the affairs of the newly constituted\r\ncolony been administered to the satisfaction of the leaders.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of following a policy dictated alike by wisdom and\r\nrighteousness, the very opposite seems to have been the rule observed\r\nin the attempt to govern these new and most difficult subjects of the\r\nBritish crown. A number of mistakes—so called—were made which, as even\r\nCanon Knox Little admits, were a sufficient justification of the\r\nAfricander leaders in plotting and agitating against the British\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nThe first of these mistakes was the too early recall of Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone, who had so deftly managed the bloodless though arbitrary\r\nannexation, who knew the country well and was much respected by the\r\npeople. In place of his rule as special commissioner was substituted an\r\nadministration under Sir Bartle Frere as governor of Cape Colony and\r\nBritish High Commissioner for South Africa. There being no\r\nrepresentative government in the Transvaal after annexation, the\r\nadministration became, perhaps necessarily, autocratic both in form and\r\nin spirit. Sir William Owen Lanyon, who had been appointed governor of\r\nthe Transvaal, was an officer of some renown in dealing successfully\r\nwith native uprisings, but proved totally unfit for the delicate\r\nmanagement required in governing the Africanders. He has been described\r\nas haughty and arrogant in mind, indisposed to excuse the rudeness of\r\nthe Transvaal farmers, and incapable of tolerating the social equality\r\nso dear to them. His swarthy complexion, also, made against his\r\npopularity, for it suggested the possibility of a strain of black blood\r\nin his veins—a blemish unpardonable in the eyes of any slaveholding\r\npeople. Under his rule complaints were ignored, taxes were levied and\r\nperemptorily collected by distraint, and soon the latent discontent\r\nbroke out into open and active disaffection.\r\n\r\nThe second mistake—if it does not deserve a harsher name—was the\r\nfailure to institute the local self-government by representatives\r\npromised by Sir Theophilus Shepstone when he proclaimed annexation. The\r\ntext of that part of the proclamation reads thus:\r\n\r\n“And I further proclaim and make known that the Transvaal will remain a\r\nseparate government, with its own Laws and Legislature, and that it is\r\nthe wish of her Most Gracious Majesty that it shall enjoy the fullest\r\nlegislative privileges compatible with the circumstances of the country\r\nand the intelligence of the people. That arrangement will be made by\r\nwhich the Dutch language will practically be as much the official\r\nlanguage as the English. All laws, proclamations and government notices\r\nwill be published in the Dutch language; and in the courts of law the\r\nsame may be done at the option of suitors to a case. The laws so in\r\nforce in the State will be retained until altered by competent\r\nlegislative authority.”\r\n\r\nNot one of these promises was ever fulfilled. The volksraad was never\r\nconvened. The promised constitution of local self-government was never\r\npromulgated. Instead of redeeming these promises the Transvaal was put\r\nupon the status of a crown colony in 1879, and the legislature proposed\r\nfor it was to consist of some crown officials and six members—all to be\r\nthe nominees of the governor.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryce, in his “Impressions of South Africa,” calls this failure to\r\nredeem a promise authoritatively made as a concession to a people whose\r\nindependence was being arbitrarily subverted, a “blunder.” Canon Little\r\nuses a still softer term, calling it a “mistake”; and adds, “It was\r\ngiven in good faith, and in good faith was received. Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone tried to fulfill it. He at once submitted his views as to the\r\nnecessary legislative arrangements. No action whatever was taken on it,\r\neither by Conservatives or Liberals, and his dispatch is probably lying\r\nuncared for in the Colonial Office now!”—(1899.)\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the mutations of language as currently used in history and\r\nin Christian ethics, it has come to pass that this piece of national\r\ntreachery—this treachery of the strong against the weak—this treachery\r\nimplicating both of the leading political parties of Great Britain and\r\ntheir chiefs, is only a “blunder,” a “mistake”!\r\n\r\nOne real and very serious blunder was committed, if one judges of it\r\nfrom the view point of the policy intended to be pursued in the\r\nTransvaal by the British government. The Africanders had accepted,\r\nunder protest, the act of annexation mainly because they were in mortal\r\nfear of the Zulus. That reason for submission the British proceeded to\r\nremove by overthrowing the Zulu power.\r\n\r\nIn the northeast Sir Garnet Wolseley defeated Sikukuni and established\r\nwhat promised to be a permanent peace. In 1879 Sir Bartle Frere\r\ninflicted a like reverse upon Cetawayo, in the southeast, and so\r\ncompleted the subjugation of the Zulus. The blunder in taking this\r\ncourse declared itself when, after subduing the natives at great cost\r\nof blood and treasure, the British found that in so doing they had\r\nrelieved the Africanders of the one fear that thus far had prevented\r\nthem from reasserting their independence.\r\n\r\nMany people, both in England and in South Africa, regarded the\r\nannexation of the Transvaal as final. But leading members of the\r\nLiberal party, then in opposition, had emphatically condemned it, and\r\nthis had raised hopes in the Transvaal Africanders and their\r\nsympathizers in England that when Gladstone came into power again the\r\nthings which they regarded as wrong would be righted. Such hopes were\r\ndoomed to disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Liberals carried the country and took office in April of\r\nthat year. Guided by information derived from the crown officials in\r\nSouth Africa, the new ministers were misled as to the measure of\r\ndiscontent in the Transvaal, and declared that the act of annexation\r\nwould not be reversed.\r\n\r\nThis flat refusal brought matters to an immediate issue. The Transvaal\r\nburghers, though they had continued to agitate and protest and\r\nmemorialize the throne, had waited with considerable patience for three\r\nyears, hoping for either a restoration of their independence or—as the\r\nnext best thing—the instituting of such a representative local\r\ngovernment as had been promised them by the imperial authorities. But\r\nnow the new Liberal government, after using the Transvaal grievances\r\nfor electioneering purposes, had refused to consider and redress those\r\ngrievances; the military administration of a mere crown colony\r\ncontinued in full force under the detested Sir William Owen Lanyon; and\r\nthere appeared to be no hope that the promises made to mollify their\r\nindignation when their independence was being subverted would ever be\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, in extenuation, that the British government of this\r\ntime was too busy with other pressing matters to give the attention\r\nnecessary to a correct understanding of the condition, and the rights\r\nand the wrongs, of the Transvaal Africanders. And it has been said, in\r\nfurther extenuation, that there was an honest intention on the part of\r\nthe government to fulfill the promises made—some time—as soon as the\r\nauthorities could get to it. Be that as it may, at the end of three\r\nyears, which had brought no betterment of their state, the burghers\r\nconcluded that their protests and their patience had been wasted, and\r\ndetermined to wait no longer.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a mass-meeting was held at Paardekraal, in December, 1880,\r\nat which it was resolved to appeal to arms. The burghers elected\r\nMessrs. Pretorius, Paul Kruger and Joubert to proclaim for them the\r\nre-establishment of their former government as the South African\r\nRepublic, which was done in Heidelberg, and the national flag was\r\nraised, on the 16th of December, 1880.\r\n\r\nThe first battles of this war were little more than skirmishes. The\r\nBritish troops were scattered through the country in small detachments,\r\nwhich the Africanders—every man of whom was a marksman and an\r\nexperienced fighter—found it easy to either cut off or drive before\r\nthem to positions that could be fortified.\r\n\r\nThe nearest available British troops, besides those already in the\r\nTransvaal, were in Natal. General Sir George Colley, governor of that\r\ncolony, raised what force he could and marched northward to check the\r\nuprising. Before he could enter the Transvaal, however,\r\nCommandant-General Joubert crossed the border into Natal and took up a\r\nstrong position at Laing’s Nek. This now historic spot is a steep ridge\r\nforming the watershed between the Klip River, a tributary of the Vaal,\r\nand Buffalo River, a confluent of the Tugela, which flows into the\r\nIndian Ocean. Here a sanguinary battle was fought on the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1881. The British attacked the Africanders with great spirit,\r\nbut Joubert’s position was invulnerable. The ridge protected his men\r\nfrom the artillery fire of the British, while they, in charging up the\r\nslope, were cut down by the accurate rifle fire of the Africanders, and\r\nforced to retreat. On the 8th of February, in the same neighborhood, on\r\nthe Ingogo heights, the British were again defeated after suffering\r\nsevere loss.\r\n\r\nGeneral Colley now decided to seize by night Majuba Hill, which is\r\nreally a considerable mountain, rising nearly 2,000 feet above Laing’s\r\nNek, and commanding that ridge for the purpose of artillery fighting.\r\nOn the night of February 26th, leaving the main body of his army in\r\ncamp, and unaccountably forgetting to order it to advance on the enemy\r\nso as to divert attention from his tactical movement, General Colley\r\nled a smaller division to the top of Majuba Hill.\r\n\r\nThe burgher force was thrown into temporary dismay when they first\r\nobserved British soldiers in that commanding position. But when there\r\nwas no advance against them in front, and no artillery fire from the\r\ntop of Majuba, they sent out a volunteer party to storm the hill. The\r\nstory of that charge has gone into history to stay as an example, on\r\nthe one side, of rugged bravery and splendid courage achieving victory,\r\nand on the other of equal bravery and courage strangely betrayed by\r\nsome one’s blunder into defeat and ruinous disaster. Why the main force\r\nof the British army was not ordered to co-operate in the movement, why\r\nthere were no entrenchments thrown up on the hill, why the order,\r\n“Charge bayonets,” so eagerly looked for by the British soldiers on the\r\nhill-top, was never given, General Colley did not live to tell—no one\r\nelse knew. The Africanders scaled the hill, shooting as they went up\r\nevery man that showed on the sky line—themselves protected by the steep\r\ndeclivities above them, and carried the hill-top, routing and almost\r\nannihilating the British force. General Colley and ninety-two of his\r\nmen were killed, and fifty-nine were made prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile additional British troops were hurrying to the scene\r\nof conflict, under command of Sir Evelyn Wood. What the outcome would\r\nhave been of further hostilities between the Africanders and the\r\ngreatly increased British force no one can tell. The sudden and\r\nsurprising action of the British government, that put an end to the\r\nwar, was not based upon any estimate of the probable issue of continued\r\nconflict, but altogether upon the moral aspects of the situation as\r\nseen by Mr. Gladstone and his associates in the British cabinet. Before\r\nSir Evelyn Wood could strike a single blow toward wiping out the\r\ndisgrace of Majuba Hill, the home government, on the 5th of March,\r\n1881, ordered an armistice, and on the 23d agreed to terms of peace by\r\nwhich the Transvaal was restored to its former political independence\r\nin all regards, save that it was to be under the suzerainty of the\r\nBritish crown.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1881, a more formal convention was held at Pretoria, when it\r\nwas agreed that the Transvaal government should be independent in the\r\nmanagement of its internal affairs; that the Republic should respect\r\nthe independence of the Swazies, a tribe of natives on the eastern\r\nborder of the Transvaal; that British troops should be allowed to pass\r\nthrough the territory of the Republic in time of war; and that the\r\nBritish sovereign should be acknowledged as suzerain of the Republic\r\nand have a veto power over all treaties between the government of the\r\nTransvaal and foreign nations.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the stipulations in this convention were very distasteful to\r\nPaul Kruger and other leading spirits in the Transvaal, and also to the\r\nvolksraad. Negotiations for desired changes were continued until 1884,\r\nwhen, on the 27th of February, a revision called the London Convention\r\nwas made and signed, formulating the obligations of the Republic as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Sovereign of Great Britain was to have, for the space of six months\r\nafter their date, a veto power over all treaties between the Republic\r\nand any native tribes to the eastward and westward of its territory,\r\nand between it and any foreign state or nation except the Orange Free\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe stipulations of the two previous conventions respecting slavery,\r\nthose of 1852 and 1881, were to be observed by the Republic.\r\n\r\nAnd the Republic was to accord to Great Britain the treatment of a most\r\nfavored nation, and to deal kindly with strangers entering its\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nNothing whatever was said in this latest convention of the suzerainty\r\nof the British Sovereign mentioned in that of 1881, and, as this\r\ninstrument, negotiated in London with Lord Derby, the Colonial\r\nSecretary, was understood to take the place of all former conventions,\r\nthe Africanders of the Transvaal have contended very reasonably that\r\nthe omission is sufficient evidence of the renunciation of suzerainty\r\nby the British government. Furthermore, by the London Convention of\r\n1884, the British crown for the first time conceded to the Transvaal\r\nthe title of “The South African Republic,” by which name it has ever\r\nsince been designated in all diplomatic transactions and correspondence\r\nbetween it and other states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICANDER REPUBLICS AND BRITISH POLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surprising policy pursued by the British government in arbitrarily\r\nannexing the Transvaal in 1877, and in restoring its independence in\r\n1881, after a brief and indecisive conflict at arms, and when strong\r\nre-enforcements had placed the imperial troops in position to crush the\r\nAfricander uprising, caused widespread dissatisfaction and bitter\r\ncontroversy both in England and in South Africa. Why had the country\r\nbeen annexed at all? And seeing it had been annexed, why was it so\r\nignominiously yielded up immediately after the disgrace of Majuba Hill?\r\nThere were many at home and in the South African colonies who would\r\nhave been satisfied to restore the independence of the Transvaal—but\r\nonly after having inflicted on the Africander forces at least one\r\ncrushing defeat.\r\n\r\nThe only reply of the Liberal government was to the effect that the\r\nannexation, and the refusal to reverse it, had been due to\r\nmisapprehension of the facts; that the officers of the crown in South\r\nAfrica, partly through ignorance and partly through prejudice, had\r\nreported that there was no such passionate desire for independence\r\namong the Africanders as was pretended by their leaders, and as was\r\nproved to exist by the uprising; that as soon as the facts were known\r\nit became the duty of a liberty-loving people like the English to honor\r\ntheir own principles by the immediate retrocession of the Transvaal\r\nwithout waiting to first avenge defeats and vindicate the military\r\nsuperiority of Great Britain; and that a great country better\r\nillustrated her greatness by doing justice and showing mercy, even at\r\ngreat cost to herself, than by taking a bloody revenge for reverses\r\nsuffered on the fields of war in trying to enforce a policy now seen to\r\nbe morally wrong.\r\n\r\nMoreover, associated with these moral considerations were reasons of\r\nstatecraft that made it appear wise as well as right to let the\r\nTransvaal go. The Africanders of the Orange Free State, of Cape Colony,\r\nof Natal, were known to be in warm sympathy with their brethren of the\r\nTransvaal. Of course, the power of Great Britain could crush, in time,\r\na rebellion as extensive as the whole Dutch-speaking population of\r\nSouth Africa, but at what cost of treasure and blood and bitter\r\ndisloyalty to the British crown! In comparison to the inevitable\r\nresults of a general civil war the loss of the Transvaal was as\r\nnothing. How well grounded were these fears of a general uprising in\r\n1881 may be seen in the earlier events of the second Africander War of\r\nIndependence in 1899. With no late grievance against Great Britain to\r\nredress, the Orange Free State made common cause with the South African\r\nRepublic from the first, and the Africanders of Cape Colony and Natal\r\nwere more than suspected of aiding and abetting in a covert way the\r\ncause for which the two republics had taken the field.\r\n\r\nIf the British ministers counted upon some recognition of the\r\nmagnanimity displayed in making the retrocession immediately after\r\ndefeat—of the humanity which renounced revenge for the humiliation of\r\nMajuba Hill when it was within easy reach—they were disappointed. The\r\nAfricanders saw not generosity, not humanity, but only fear as the\r\nmotive for the sudden and easy yielding of the British; and to their\r\nnatural exultation they added contempt for their late antagonists, and\r\nso became and have continued very unpleasant neighbors for so\r\nproud-spirited a people as the English. And this is the principal\r\nreason why the English in all South Africa have always condemned the\r\nrestoration of independence to the Transvaal—and, most of all, the time\r\nand manner of the act. They have not been able to forget the fact that\r\nthe terms of peace were, in a way, dictated by the Africanders as\r\nvictorious invaders and holders of British territory in the colony of\r\nNatal.\r\n\r\nIn order to view intelligently the causes of the second Africander War\r\nof Independence, it is necessary to consider the general trend of\r\nevents in South Africa, and the conflicting policies sought to be\r\ncarried out there during the few years following the restitution of\r\nindependence to the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nThe South African Republic emerged from its brief and successful\r\nstruggle for independence impoverished and in a state of political\r\nchaos, but rejoicing, nevertheless, in a sense of national freedom, and\r\nmore than ever confident that it enjoyed the special favor of Heaven.\r\nThe old constitution, or Grondwet, was revived, the volksraad was\r\nconvoked, and an election was held, resulting in the choice of Mr. Paul\r\nKruger to be president. Mr. Kruger immediately planned for bold and\r\nfar-reaching movements on three sides of the republic’s territory.\r\n\r\nA great trek to the north for the occupation of Mashonaland was\r\nprojected but never carried out. To the south Zululand was now open,\r\nand into it went a number of adventurers as trekkers, followed, a\r\nlittle later, by others who took service under one of the warring\r\nnative chiefs. When these took steps to set up a government of their\r\nown in the northern districts of Zululand the British authorities\r\ninterfered and restricted their claim to a small territory of about\r\nthree thousand square miles, which enjoyed an independent existence as\r\nthe New Republic from 1886 to 1888, when it was annexed by the\r\nTransvaal.\r\n\r\nOther bands of Africanders raided parts of Bechuanaland, to the west,\r\ntaking forcible possession of territory or obtaining grants of land by\r\ndevices not always honorable. These intimidated the native chiefs into\r\nan acknowledgment of their authority and established two small\r\nrepublics, Stella and Goshen, to the north of Kimberley.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings opened the eyes of the British government to the\r\npolicy upon which the South African Republic had entered—to annex\r\nBechuanaland and close the way of British communication with regions\r\nstill farther north in which the nation had become interested. To check\r\nthese designs in time, a military expedition under Sir Charles Warren\r\nentered Bechuanaland toward the end of 1884, expelled the Africanders\r\nwithout bloodshed, and proclaimed the whole region a crown colony under\r\nthe name of British Bechuanaland. This territory was annexed to Cape\r\nColony in 1895. In 1885 a British protectorate was established over a\r\nstill more northerly region, covering the whole country as far as the\r\nborders of Matabeleland. In 1888 the British hold was made yet more\r\nsecure by a treaty with the king of the Matabele, Lo Bengula, by which\r\nhe bound himself to cede no territory to, and to make no treaty with,\r\nany foreign power without the approval of the British High\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nThe raising of the British flag at St. Lucia Bay, on the Indian Ocean,\r\nin 1884, and a treaty with the Tonga tribes, binding them to make no\r\ntreaties with any other power than the English, completed the hold of\r\nthe British crown on the eastern coast line up to the southern border\r\nof the Portuguese possessions.\r\n\r\nThe Africanders, denied expansion on the north, sought compensation in\r\nthe acquisition of Swaziland, to the east of the Transvaal republic—a\r\nsmall but fertile region and possessing considerable mineral wealth. It\r\nwas inhabited by some 70,000 Kaffirs, near of kin but hostile to the\r\nZulus. After long negotiations, in which the South African Republic,\r\nCetawayo of the Zulus, and the British authorities took part, the\r\nAfricanders secured a concession of right to build a railway through\r\nthe marshy region lying between Swaziland and the sea to the coast at\r\nKosi Bay; this concession was granted in 1890 and laid in abeyance\r\nawaiting the acquisition of Swaziland itself, through which the railway\r\nmust run. In 1894 the whole territory of Swaziland was placed under the\r\ncontrol of the South African Republic, subject to a formal guaranty of\r\nprotection to the natives.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine whether it was Africander dullness or\r\nBritish sharpness, or both, that omitted from the Swaziland convention\r\nof 1894 the concession to the South African Republic, granted in 1890,\r\nof a right to construct a railway to the sea through the marshy\r\ndistrict of Tongaland lying next the coast line. But it was omitted\r\nfrom that instrument, and it was held that, as the later convention\r\nsuperseded and voided the earlier one, the provision for access to the\r\nsea had lapsed. Whereupon the British government promptly secured the\r\nconsent of the three Tonga chiefs concerned, and proclaimed a\r\nprotectorate over the whole strip of land lying between Swaziland and\r\nthe ocean, up to the southern portion of the Portuguese territory. Thus\r\nby a stroke of statecraft the access of the Africanders to the sea by\r\nrailway communication entirely under their own control was effectually\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nWithin nine years the British control established in Bechuanaland in\r\n1885 was extended over the whole unappropriated country as far north as\r\nthe Zambesi. By a new treaty made with Lo Bengula in 1888 the sphere of\r\nBritish influence was further expanded to embrace not only\r\nMatabeleland, but Mashonaland also—a partially explored territory to\r\nthe eastward, over which Lo Bengula claimed some authority.\r\n\r\nThe next step in working out the policy of the British in South Africa\r\nwas the granting of a royal charter to a corporation known as the\r\nBritish South African Company, formed to develop this eastern and\r\nundefined region of Lo Bengula’s territory. Mr. Cecil Rhodes was\r\nconspicuous as the leader in this movement. The purpose of the company\r\nwas twofold: To develop the gold fields supposed to exist there, and to\r\nforestall the Transvaal Africanders in taking possession of the\r\ncountry. The charter not only invested the company with the rights of a\r\ntrading corporation, but also with administrative powers as\r\nrepresentative of the British crown. In 1890 the pioneer emigrants\r\nunder this management began to arrive in the chartered territory and\r\ncommenced to found settlements and build forts along the eastern\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nWith the conflicts which arose between the British South African\r\nCompany and the Portuguese—complicated by alliances with the natives,\r\nwith the wars which arose therefrom, and with the final adjustments and\r\ntreaties that followed—we have nothing to do in these pages. The one\r\nfact that is of interest to us in closing this chapter of conflict in\r\nstatecraft is that at last the British succeeded in isolating the\r\nAfricanders from the sea, and in throwing around them a perfect cordon\r\nof British territories and pre-emptions. By chartering the British\r\nSouth African Company to the north of the Transvaal the last link in\r\nthe chain that inclosed the two Africander republics was completed. For\r\nthere had been left no possibility of advance toward the sea eastward\r\non the part of the Transvaal Republic—in the Arbitration Treaty of 1872\r\nGreat Britain had obtained pre-emption rights over the Portuguese\r\ncolonial possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE AFRICANDERS’ SECOND WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one sense the causes of the Second War of Independence, like those\r\nof the first, were as remote as the British seizure of Cape Colony in\r\n1795, and as the years between 1814 and 1836, which saw the\r\naccumulation of grievances that led to the “Great Trek.” Seeds of\r\ndislike to the English were then sown in the Africander mind which have\r\nnever ceased to propagate themselves—an ominous heredity—from father to\r\nson through all the intervening generations.\r\n\r\nThe immediate causes of that war were of a more recent date. Tracing\r\nbackward, the war was brought about by the alleged grievances of a\r\nmultitude of foreigners—vastly outnumbering the citizens—who, for their\r\nown purposes, had entered the territory of the South African Republic\r\nwithin a single decade; these foreigners went there in the pursuit of\r\nwealth; the wealth that enticed them there was in the rich gold\r\ndeposits of the Witwatersrand district of the Transvaal. If the gold\r\nhad not been there, or had not been discovered, the excess of\r\nforeigners would not have pressed into the country; if the foreigners\r\nhad not flocked into it in great excess of numbers over the citizens,\r\nthere would have been no alleged grievances to redress, and therefore\r\nno war, unless one or both of the parties to it had predetermined to\r\nbring about a conflict at this time and found some other pretext.\r\n\r\nTracing from cause to effect up to the war, we begin with unimportant\r\ndiscoveries of gold near the eastern border of the Transvaal between\r\n1867 and 1872. Though these were not rich in themselves, they\r\nencouraged more vigorous and extensive prospecting than had been\r\npracticed theretofore. This led to the discovery, in 1885, of the\r\nmarvelously rich deposits of the precious metal in beds of conglomerate\r\nin the Witwatersrand district. The influx of strangers had been\r\nconsiderable from 1882, but from 1885 to 1895 the foreign additions to\r\nthe population of the Transvaal threatened to submerge the native\r\nAfricander citizens, for the newcomers were mostly men, and largely\r\nexceeded in number the entire Africander population, including the\r\nwomen and the children.\r\n\r\nThe first result of the new mining industry and the rapid growth of the\r\ntowns was pleasant enough—the revenues of the needy republic were\r\nincreased, and there was a promise of unprecedented prosperity.\r\nNevertheless, in the tidal wave of incoming aliens from the British\r\ncolonies in South Africa, from Europe and from America—most of them\r\nBritish, and nearly all speaking English—the far-seeing president, Paul\r\nKruger, and other leaders of political life in the Transvaal, early\r\nrecognized an element of peril to their cherished domestic\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nAs a defense against the passing of controlling power into the hands of\r\ntransient settlers, the electoral franchise was somewhat restricted. Up\r\nto the convention of 1881 the probation of an alien seeking\r\nenfranchisement in the Transvaal Republic was a residence in the\r\ncountry for two years. At that time, with the arbitrary annexation of\r\n1877 fresh in their minds, and knowing that the British authorities had\r\nbeen solicited to take that step by English residents in the Transvaal,\r\nit is a matter of no surprise that the Africanders extended the\r\nprobation for franchise to five years—the period required in the United\r\nStates of America. That provision was in force when the London\r\nConvention was signed, in 1884; it passed unquestioned by the British\r\ngovernment, and was still in force in 1890. Up to that date the\r\nfranchise had kept the native Africander element in a safe majority.\r\n\r\nAs a concession to demands on the part of foreigners for a reduction of\r\nthe period of residence required for naturalization, Mr. Kruger\r\nproposed, in 1890, to divide the volksraad, which consisted of\r\nforty-eight members, into two chambers of twenty-four members each, the\r\nfirst to retain supreme power, the second to be competent to legislate\r\nin all matters local to the new industrial population gathered,\r\nprincipally, in and about Johannesburg, and its acts to be subject\r\nalways to the veto of the first volksraad. The measure provided, also,\r\nthat in electing members of the second volksraad only two years’\r\nresidence and the ordinary process of naturalization should be required\r\nof aliens, their franchise for the first volksraad still being subject\r\nto an additional five years’ probation.\r\n\r\nThis measure was passed by the volksraad after a good deal of\r\nopposition by the more conservative members. It has been condemned as\r\nclumsy and inadequate; but it is worth while to weigh Mr. Kruger’s own\r\nwords explanatory of his purpose in it. “I intend this second\r\nvolksraad,” he said, “to act as a bridge. I want my burghers to see\r\nthat the new population may safely be trusted to take part in the\r\ngovernment of the country. When they see that this is done, and that no\r\nharm happens, then the two volksraads may come together again, and the\r\ndistinction between the old and the new population can be obliterated.”\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that the two years’ franchise gave\r\nthe citizen no vote in the election of the president and the executive\r\ncouncil—for that privilege he had to fill out the additional five\r\nyears’ probation—and that no naturalized burgher could become a member\r\nof the first volksraad.\r\n\r\nDiscontent continued to spread among the new industrial population, who\r\ncomplained bitterly of exclusion from important political rights, and\r\nof grievances which they and the mining industry suffered under the\r\nexisting laws and administration. As a means of redress a reform\r\nassociation was formed in 1893. It is necessary to a correct judgment\r\nof the situation at this time to consider the statements of both sides\r\nas to the causes of complaint.\r\n\r\nAccording to Canon Little, who cannot be accused of favoring the\r\nAfricanders—\r\n\r\n“The grievances of the Uitlanders were these:\r\n\r\n“1. That the customs tariff was excessive, making food shamefully dear,\r\nand that the charges for railway freights were unduly heavy.\r\n\r\n“2. That the duties on machinery and chemicals were extortionate.\r\n\r\n“3. That these and the dynamite monopoly made the expense of all mining\r\noperations excessive.\r\n\r\n“4. The extreme unfairness as to the vexatious laws touching on\r\neducation and the use of language.”\r\n\r\nOver against these allegations are the statements of Mr. F. Reginald\r\nStatham in his “South Africa as It Is.” Mr. Statham writes from the\r\nAfricander viewpoint, but gives some guaranty of sincerity and of\r\nconfidence in his own averments by an appeal to figures—which can\r\nalways be verified. Speaking in a general way of the conditions\r\nprevailing at this period, he says:\r\n\r\n“The idea of the persecuted and oppressed Uitlanders has become so\r\nfixed in the minds of English people—thanks to the efforts of those who\r\nwere occupied in preparing and justifying a revolt—that even the\r\nplainest statement of facts seems powerless to dispossess it. No one\r\nwill claim, no one ever has claimed, that the government of the South\r\nAfrican Republic is perfect. Having regard to the extraordinary changes\r\nthat have come over the country during the last ten years, it is really\r\na marvel that the government is not much more imperfect than it is. The\r\npresent position of the Transvaal executive has been not inaptly\r\ncompared to the position of the crew of a collier brig who might\r\nsuddenly find themselves in control of a first-class mail steamer.\r\nHowever desirous they might be of doing their best, they could hardly\r\navoid making some mistakes. If the foreign population had much more to\r\ncomplain of than they have, it ought not to cause either surprise or\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n“And what have they to complain of? Really, the life of the average\r\nforeigner in Johannesburg is the freest imaginable. He can follow his\r\ntrade, he can follow his profession, no matter what it is, without any\r\nquestion or hindrance from the government. His position as an Uitlander\r\nin no way hinders him from investing in property, from practicing as a\r\nlawyer in the courts, from undertaking, in fact, as freely as he could\r\nundertake in his own country, any lawful kind of business or\r\noccupation. If he pays a high rent for his house, that is not the fault\r\nof the government, but of the land speculators who have bought up\r\nbuilding stands. If his water supply is somewhat defective, it is the\r\nfault of the big foreign capitalists, who think more of the dividends\r\nthey put in their own pockets than of the water they put into the\r\npeople’s mouths.\r\n\r\n“A government which depends on the goodwill of a strictly Sabbatarian\r\npopulation allows the Uitlander to spend his Sunday exactly as he\r\npleases. He may play lawn tennis if he likes—and, indeed, he generally\r\ndoes so; he may engage in cricket matches, he can attend so-called\r\nsacred concerts, the programmes of which are drawn from the music hall\r\nor the comic opera. If he is in a gayer mood he may witness on a Sunday\r\nevening displays of “living pictures” which certainly would not be\r\ntolerated at the Royal Aquarium. To put it shortly, allowing for little\r\ndrawbacks of climate and the expense of living, the Uitlander can live\r\nmore at his ease in Johannesburg or Pretoria than in almost any other\r\ncity under the sun.\r\n\r\n“But he is taxed.\r\n\r\n“How is he taxed? There is probably no one in the Transvaal, rich or\r\npoor, whose personal taxes amount to more than £5 a year. If it is\r\ncomplained that he is taxed through his interest in the gold industry\r\nit is easy to make an appeal to published figures. In 1895 the Crown\r\nReef Gold Mining Company produced gold worth upward of £420,000, and\r\ndistributed nearly £97,000 in profits. Its payment to the Government\r\nfor rents, licenses, and all other privileges and rights amounted to\r\n£1,191 9s 10d. In the same year the Robinson Company, which had\r\nproduced £651,000 in gold and distributed £346,000 in dividends, paid\r\nto the government £395 11s 8d. The New Chimes Company, producing\r\n£93,000 in gold and distributing £32,000 in profits, paid under the\r\nhead of rates and licenses, together with insurance premiums, £664 16s\r\n5d. The Transvaal Coal Trust produced 266,945 tons of coal, and paid\r\nthe government £53 15s, while the Consolidated Land and Exploration\r\nCompany, in which the Ecksteins are the largest shareholders, and which\r\nowns more than 250 farms of 6,000 acres each, paid to the government in\r\nthe shape of taxes, including absentee tax, no more than £722 2s 6d.\r\n\r\n“These figures are sufficiently eloquent by themselves. They become\r\nmore eloquent when they are placed beside the 50 per cent impost\r\nclaimed by the Chartered Company on all gold-mining enterprise in\r\nRhodesia.\r\n\r\n“But what about indirect taxation? Here are the facts:\r\n\r\n“All machinery for mining purposes is subject to only 1½ per cent\r\nimpost dues, the term machinery being stretched by the government to\r\nits uttermost possibilities to meet the mining industry, and it is made\r\nto include sheet lead, cyanide, etc. All other articles not specially\r\nrated are subject to an ad valorem duty of 7½ per cent, the Cape\r\nColonist paying an ad valorem duty of 12 per cent. Specially rated\r\narticles affecting the white miners, such as tea, coffee, butter, rice,\r\nsoap, sugar, are in most cases subject to lower, and only in one\r\ninstance to higher, duties than in Cape Colony.\r\n\r\n“Here is a comparison:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CAPE COLONY.          TRANSVAAL.\r\n\r\n           Butter   3d per lb.            5s 0d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Cheese   3d per lb.            5s 0d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Coffee   12s 6d per 100 lbs.   2s 6d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Rice     3s 6d per 100 lbs.    1s 6d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Soap     4s 2d per 100 lbs.    5s 0d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Sugar    6s 3d per 100 lbs.    3s 6d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Tea      8d per lb.            2s 6d per 100 lbs.\r\n           Guns     £1 per barrel.        10s 0d per barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n“As regards monopolies and concessions, the dynamite monopoly is often\r\nquoted as an instance of the manner in which monopolies are granted, to\r\nthe detriment of the mining interest. It has been complained that the\r\ngovernment retains a right to charge 90s a case for what can be\r\nproduced for 30s a case. These figures, however, are exaggerated both\r\nways. The government charge is 85s a case, and as the dynamite used by\r\nDe Beers, at Kimberley, costs more than 60s a case laid down there, it\r\ncan hardly be held that 85s is a high charge in Johannesburg, having\r\nregard to the much greater distance of Johannesburg from the sea. In\r\nthis matter of the dynamite concession, moreover, it was a choice\r\nbetween a foreign monopoly and a local monopoly, while in the reports\r\nof mining companies in which explosives are separately accounted for it\r\nis shown that while total working expenses run up to over 30s per ton,\r\nthe cost of explosives is less than 1s 3d per ton.\r\n\r\n“As regards the railway concessions, the truth of the matter is that\r\nthe Transvaal Railway Company—the Netherlands South African Railway\r\nCompany, that is—by providing competing routes to Johannesburg from\r\nNatal and Delagoa Bay, keeps in check the monopoly which would\r\ncertainly be taken great advantage of by the Cape Colony if the only\r\nroute to Johannesburg was from Cape ports.”\r\n\r\nIt may be allowed—it must be—that the old saw, “figures will not lie,”\r\nis unsound. In the hands of capable and unscrupulous persons they will\r\nlie like Ananias and Sapphira. But, like that of Ananias and Sapphira,\r\nthe lie in figures brings swift detection and punishment. It ought to\r\nbe easy, therefore, for those who have filled the ears of the world\r\nwith charges of Africander oppression practiced upon the foreigners in\r\nthe way of “excessive customs tariff,” “extortionate duties on\r\nmachinery,” and the “dynamite monopoly that made the expense of all\r\nmining operations excessive,” to convince the world-jury to which they\r\nhave appealed that they have a case. They ought at least to be able to\r\nshow that in British Rhodesia the impost on the profits of gold mining\r\nwas not 50 per cent, while in the Transvaal it was about 8 per cent\r\nthereof; that in British Cape Colony the ad valorem duty on articles\r\nnot specially rated was not 12 per cent, while in the Transvaal it was\r\n7½ per cent; that in British Cape Colony specially rated articles\r\naffecting the white miner as to expense of living were not taxed all\r\nthe way from 100 to 500 per cent higher than in the Transvaal, with the\r\nsingle exception of soap; that an import duty of 1½ per cent on mining\r\nmachinery was extortionate as compared with the tariff of other\r\nnations, or that a higher duty than 1½ per cent was collected in the\r\nTransvaal; and that a profit of 25s a case on dynamite, less the cost\r\nof transportation from Kimberley to Johannesburg, and only causing the\r\nexpense for explosives used in mining to be 1s 3d per ton of ore out of\r\na total cost of 30s per ton, was an oppressive monopoly causing the\r\ncost of mining to be excessive.\r\n\r\nConcerning the other grounds of complaint Mr. Statham writes:\r\n\r\n“There are, besides the material grievances alluded to above, what may\r\nbe called the political grievances, such as (1) the alleged government\r\nof the country by a small faction of Hollanders, (2) the language\r\ngrievance, (3) the educational grievance, and (4) the franchise\r\ngrievance.\r\n\r\n“As regards the first mentioned of these, an honest and impartial\r\nperson would search for evidence of it in vain. All the members of the\r\nexecutive, with one exception, are South African born; so are the\r\nmajority of heads and sub-heads of departments. * * * The only\r\nHollander of any distinction in the government is the state secretary,\r\nDr. Leyds, a man of exceptional ability and integrity, who, in spite of\r\nenormous difficulties and constant attacks, has deserved and retained\r\nthe confidence both of the president and the volksraad. To say that he\r\nis the ablest and most cultured official in South Africa is to say what\r\nis simply true, and if his ability has excited jealousy and resentment,\r\nit is only what a general study of human nature would lead one to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\n“As regards the language question and the education question,\r\nconsideration has to be paid to the language most usually spoken in the\r\ncountry. Entirely misleading ideas are liable to be formed on this\r\npoint, owing to the erroneous impression as to the relative strength of\r\nthe Dutch and the foreign population. A habit has arisen of speaking as\r\nif the foreign population greatly outnumbered the burgher population.\r\nThe case is quite the opposite of this. The census of Johannesburg\r\ntaken in 1896 by the Johannesburg Sanitary Commission showed that the\r\npopulation of the place had been greatly overestimated, the male\r\nEuropean population of all ages amounting to 31,000. As there are\r\n25,000 burghers on the military register of the republic, it seems fair\r\nto assume that the burgher population is at least 150,000, while the\r\nforeign population is probably not more than half of that. Of the\r\n150,000 burghers and their families fully two-thirds do not understand\r\nEnglish. Is it, then, unreasonable to claim that the official language,\r\nthe language of official documents, shall be the language spoken by\r\ntwo-thirds of the people, or do the women and children count for\r\nnothing? But although the official language by law is Dutch, there is\r\nnot a single government office in which there is not English or German\r\nspoken to those who cannot speak Dutch. In the higher courts the judges\r\nfrequently shut their eyes to the use of the English language in the\r\nwitness-box, and in the lower courts English is invariably spoken by\r\nEnglish litigants.\r\n\r\n“As regards the education question, there is not now much need to\r\ndiscuss it. The volksraad during the session of 1896 passed a law in\r\nfurther expansion of the principles laid down in the law of 1892, and\r\nunder the regulations drawn up in accordance with the law, as now\r\nexpanded, state schools, in which English-speaking children will be\r\ntaught in English, and which are placed under the control of\r\nrepresentative school boards, have been established in the gold-mining\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n“The franchise question has been made the subject of special complaint.\r\nHere, however, there are several difficulties in the way. In the first\r\nplace, the majority of the foreign population do not want the\r\nfranchise, because they are quite content with their position as it is\r\nand do not want to become—as they would have to do if they exercised\r\nthe franchise—burghers of the South African Republic. The very\r\nagitation over the question has increased the difficulty, for the more\r\nthere seems to be a possibility of a serious misunderstanding between\r\nthe Transvaal and Great Britain, the less disposed British subjects\r\nbecome to place themselves in a position which might compel them to\r\nfight against their own countrymen. Meantime the government and the\r\nvolksraad have been compelled to the conclusion that the agitation for\r\nthe franchise is not genuine—that it has not been encouraged with the\r\nview to obtaining a concession, but with the object of establishing a\r\ngrievance. They have seen, too, that to grant wholesale political\r\nprivileges to the foreign residents in Johannesburg, even if those\r\nforeign residents were willing to become naturalized, would be to a\r\ngreat extent to deliver up the interests of all the dependent\r\nclasses—the shopkeepers, the miners, the professional men—into the\r\nhands of a small group of capitalists, who would use their influence,\r\nas they have used it elsewhere, to corrupt the political atmosphere and\r\nto subject the interests of every individual to their own. The\r\npolitical tyranny that exists in Kimberley, where employes of De Beers\r\nare compelled to vote to order on pain of dismissal, supplies a\r\nsufficient illustration of what would happen in Johannesburg if once\r\nthe financial conspirators secured political control. A further and\r\nmost significant illustration is supplied by a well-known incident in\r\nconnection with the revolutionary movement in Johannesburg, when miners\r\nunder the control of the leading conspirators were ordered to take up\r\narms under penalty of forfeiting their wages. That in the great\r\nmajority of cases they preferred the latter course is in itself a\r\ncomplete exposure of the hollowness of the whole revolutionary\r\nmovement. In all known cases of revolution arising from discontent on\r\nthe part of a mining population it has been the miners who have taken\r\nthe lead and dragged others in with them. In this case the miners, who\r\nhad never dreamed of discontent, were ordered to take up arms and\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n“Out of the facts of the position actually existing in Johannesburg and\r\nother gold-mining centers it was utterly impossible for any honest man\r\nto manufacture a serious complaint, least of all such a complaint as\r\nwould in any respect justify a revolution to secure redress. So far\r\nfrom being treated with unfairness or hardship, the foreign residents\r\nin the Transvaal have been treated with marked consideration. The\r\ninterests of the gold industry have been consulted in every possible\r\nway. If the government has not in some instances been able to do all it\r\nmight have wished to do, it has been because the reckless language of a\r\nportion of the press and the overbearing attitude of the capitalist\r\nagitators have aroused the suspicion and the resentment of the\r\nvolksraad.\r\n\r\n“Yet out of this position of things a case had to be got up against the\r\nTransvaal government in order to justify the revolutionary movement\r\nthat had been planned in the interest of the small groups of\r\ncapitalists who had determined to make themselves as supreme over the\r\ngold industry in Johannesburg as they had become over the diamond\r\nindustry in Kimberley.”\r\n\r\nIt has seemed necessary to quote Mr. Statham thus at length in order\r\nthat the alleged grievances of the foreigners in the Transvaal, and the\r\nAfricander answer thereto may be considered side by side. To say the\r\nleast, Mr. Statham has not dealt in vague generalities. His assertions\r\nare specific and his figures can easily be investigated. It is for\r\nthose who sympathize with the complaints which led to prolonged\r\nagitation and finally to war, to show that Mr. Statham was in error.\r\nUntil they shall have done so charges of “oppressive” and\r\n“extortionate” imposts, taxes and tariffs will lie, not against the\r\nSouth African Republic, but against the British administration in Cape\r\nColony, Natal and Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nMr. Statham’s contention that the Dutch ought to be the official\r\nlanguage of the Transvaal seems well founded. The account he gives of a\r\nsomewhat tardy provision—made after the raid of December, 1895—for the\r\ninstruction of English children in the English language evinces a\r\ndisposition to meet the reasonable demands of the foreigners in that\r\nregard; but the delay in doing so is to be regretted. The matter of\r\nfranchise became the subject of acrimonious diplomatic negotiation and\r\nthe immediate cause of war, which will be treated of more fully in a\r\nlater chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE AFRICANDERS’ SECOND WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.—CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foreigners’ Reform Association, sometimes called the National\r\nUnion, was organized at Johannesburg in 1893. Its professed object was\r\nto secure redress of grievances. This is always allowable in a free\r\ncountry; but it is matter of record that the spirit and methods of this\r\nparticular association were not calculated to propitiate the people to\r\nwhom they must look for any relief from the sufferings of which they\r\ncomplained.\r\n\r\nTwo incidents will sufficiently illustrate this. In 1894 Lord Loch, the\r\nBritish High Commissioner for South Africa, visited the Transvaal to\r\nconduct certain negotiations with the executive concerning Swaziland.\r\nThe presence of this distinguished Crown Official in the Transvaal was\r\nmade the occasion by the association of offering a public insult to\r\nPresident Kruger in Pretoria, of promoting a violent outburst of\r\npro-British and anti-Africander sentiment in Johannesburg, and of a\r\nconference between Lord Loch and Mr. Lionel Phillips, a member of one\r\nof the leading financial houses in Johannesburg, in which was\r\nconsidered the propriety of assembling a body of imperial troops on the\r\nborders of the Transvaal for the support of any revolutionary movement\r\nthat might be made. These proceedings were reminiscent to the\r\nAfricanders of an earlier demonstration, prior to the forming of the\r\nNational Union. In 1890 President Kruger visited Johannesburg to confer\r\nwith leading citizens on the mitigation of the grievances complained\r\nof. The foreigners celebrated his coming in that friendly way by\r\ndrinking to excess, by singing in his ears “God Save the Queen” as a\r\nsuitable song of welcome to the President of the South African\r\nRepublic, and by tearing down the national flag of the Transvaal which\r\nwas floating in front of the house in which the conference was being\r\nheld. With a moderation not to be expected from Paul Kruger, the\r\npresident charitably attributed the offensive proceedings to “long\r\ndrinks”; but the people in general and their representatives were much\r\nembittered by them, and the effect was unfavorable to the carrying of\r\nany measures for the benefit of the foreigners.\r\n\r\nThroughout 1894 and 1895, both on the surface of things and beneath it,\r\nappearances were ominous of coming disturbance. On the surface there\r\nwas, from Cape Town, an open advocacy of violent measures in\r\nJohannesburg, should such be found necessary to bring about the desired\r\nchanges in favor of the foreigners. Mr. Edmund Garrett, editor of the\r\n“Cape Times,” openly stated at Bloemfontein, in 1895, that his presence\r\nin South Africa was connected with a purpose on the part of Mr. Cecil\r\nRhodes, premier of Cape Colony, and his associates, to “force the\r\npace.” And it was at this time that, as before stated, the British\r\nauthorities suddenly annexed the Tongaland territory, through which the\r\nAfricanders had secured a concession and projected a railway to the\r\nsea—thus deepening the impression to a painful and alarming certainty\r\nthat the Imperial Government was intentionally unfriendly to that of\r\nthe South African Republic.\r\n\r\nUnder the surface very momentous things were going on. In Rhodesia a\r\nvolunteer police force was being enrolled by Sir John Willoughby. This\r\ngentleman, speaking for his superior, Doctor Jameson, assured the men\r\nthat they would only be required to serve in a “camp of exercise” once\r\na year, and that they would not be taken beyond the borders of\r\nRhodesia.\r\n\r\nFitting in very significantly with this movement, the Bechuanaland\r\nProtectorate—lying next neighbor to Rhodesia on the south and to the\r\nTransvaal on the west—was transferred to the Chartered Company\r\ncontrolling Rhodesia, a measure that enabled Doctor Jameson to station\r\nhis volunteer police force on the Transvaal border without taking them\r\nout of the enlarged Rhodesia.\r\n\r\nMeantime, rifles, ammunition and Maxim guns were smuggled across the\r\nborder from Kimberley to Johannesburg, to be in readiness for an armed\r\nuprising of the foreigners on a date to be agreed upon. Over in the\r\nBritish territory of Rhodesia, Doctor Jameson’s force—ostensibly for\r\nlocal police purposes—was armed and near the border, ready to\r\nco-operate with the revolt about to be initiated at Johannesburg. As a\r\nprovision for the sustenance of the invading force, a number of\r\nso-called “canteens,” said to be for the convenience of a projected\r\nstage line, but really stores of food for Jameson’s troopers and their\r\nhorses, were established at convenient distances along the road over\r\nwhich the force was to advance upon Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the official opening of the new railway from Pretoria\r\nto Delagoa Bay was made the occasion of such marked congratulation from\r\nthe Imperial Government as implied nothing but the most friendly\r\nrelations. Afterwards the Africanders held that the Imperial\r\ncongratulations were sincere, and that the fact of their being sent was\r\nevidence that the policy of implacable hostility toward the South\r\nAfrican Republic being pursued by Mr. Cecil Rhodes was in no sense the\r\npolicy of the British government.\r\n\r\nIt is almost past belief, however, that so small a matter as the\r\nclosing of a ford, or “drift,” across the Vaal River could be made the\r\nsubject of international dispute, and become the cause of ill-will\r\nbetween two nations on terms of perfect amity and good will; but so it\r\nwas. In a rate war between the Cape Government Railway system and the\r\nTransvaal Railway Company, in order to force the hand of the Transvaal\r\nCompany, the Cape authorities adopted the practice of unloading freight\r\non the south side of the Vaal, on Free State soil, and sending it on by\r\nox-wagons across the “drift” and so transporting it over the more than\r\nfifty miles to Johannesburg—this to deprive the Transvaal section of\r\nthe through railway of the carrying trade from the border to\r\nJohannesburg until it submitted to a certain prescribed rate. In order\r\nto protect a railway enterprise in which it was a partner, the\r\nTransvaal government promptly proclaimed the “drift” closed to traffic.\r\nThe Cape government then complained to the imperial authorities, and\r\nobtained from the Colonial Office a decision that the closing of the\r\n“drift” was a breach of the London Convention, of 1884, and must be\r\nreversed. To avoid trouble over so paltry a matter the Transvaal\r\ngovernment withdrew the proclamation, but there was bitter feeling\r\noccasioned by this interference, naturally in inverse ratio to the\r\npetty cause of it. The resentment was as widespread as the two\r\nAfricander Republics. It was this incident, together with the Jameson\r\nraid of a few months later, that decided the Free State to dissolve all\r\npartnership with Cape Colony as to railway interests, and to use its\r\noption of buying the Free State section of this trunk line at cost\r\nprice. As this was the most profitable part of the whole system, the\r\nCape government was a heavy loser—to the extent of 7 per cent out of 11\r\nper cent profits previously derived from the road;—but if the ultimate\r\nobject sought by those who directed the movement was to create a strong\r\nprejudice in England against the Transvaal government, it was gained.\r\n\r\nAs time went on preparations for the contemplated uprising were\r\nmatured. Ostensibly to participate in the taking over of the\r\nBechuanaland Protectorate Doctor Jameson and his police were brought\r\ndown to the vicinity of the Transvaal frontier. Simultaneously,\r\nmutterings of the coming earthquake—as it was intended to be—began to\r\nbe heard. At the meeting of the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines, held on\r\nthe 20th of November, 1895, Mr. Lionel Phillips, in an incendiary\r\nspeech, declared that “capital was always on the side of order, but\r\nthere was a limit to endurance, though there was nothing further from\r\ntheir desires than an upheaval which would end in bloodshed.” How this\r\nwas understood, even in Europe, may be seen from the following\r\nreference to it in a letter from a gentleman in Hamburg, written on the\r\n6th of December, and quoted by Mr. Statham in his “South Africa as It\r\nIs”:\r\n\r\n“Master Lionel’s speech has been very foolish, and is likely to do a\r\ngreat deal of harm and no good—unless his instructions are to incite to\r\nbloodshed—and I can scarcely imagine such instructions to have gone out\r\nwhile the boom is lasting. If there is anything that is likely to put\r\nPaul Kruger’s back up, it is threats; and unless Cecil Rhodes is\r\nprepared to back up with his Matabele heroes those threats, you will\r\nfind the Volksraad of 1896 give an unmistakable answer to what they\r\nwill wrongly call ‘British threats.’”\r\n\r\nHow the real state of things was comprehended locally is evinced in the\r\nanswer to that letter, dated December the 10th:\r\n\r\n“Your remark concerning Rhodes’ Matabele heroes is probably more\r\nprophetic than you yourself are aware of. South Africa is, as you say,\r\nthe land of surprises.”\r\n\r\nAmong the parties privy to the conspiracy the date of uprising was\r\nspoken of as the “day of flotation.” It was carefully discussed, as was\r\nthe use that could be made of the British crown officials at the Cape.\r\nArms and ammunition for the use of the revolutionists continued to\r\narrive at Johannesburg, concealed in coal trucks and oil tanks. It\r\nlooked like an appointment when, on the 21st of December, Colonel\r\nRhodes, brother and representative of Cecil Rhodes at Johannesburg,\r\ntelegraphed to the Cape that a high official, whom he called the\r\n“Chairman,” should interfere at the earliest possible moment, and that\r\nhe and Mr. Cecil Rhodes should start from Cape Town for Johannesburg on\r\nthe “day of flotation.”\r\n\r\nThis telegram has been interpreted to mean that the conspirators wanted\r\nto create just enough of disturbance to justify alarming telegrams and\r\ncalls for help, but not so prolonged and violent as to make it\r\nnecessary for them to lead a hand-to-hand fight against the burghers in\r\nthe streets of Johannesburg. They would have the Jameson force near\r\nenough to take the brunt of the fighting, and the High Commissioner to\r\ncome in opportunely to mediate a peace favoring the re-establishment of\r\nBritish control in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, at the last moment divisions arose among the local\r\nconspirators at Johannesburg; they hesitated, and were lost. To some,\r\nthe project which had been much talked of—that of re-establishing\r\nBritish rule—became suddenly distasteful, the principal reason being\r\nthat the desired control of capital over legislation could not be as\r\ncomplete under British colonial administration as it might be made\r\nunder some other regime. They had appealed to the sentiment of British\r\nloyalty in persuading English recruits to enter their ranks, but they\r\nbegan to see that this sentiment, carried to its legitimate fruition,\r\nwould defeat the chief end of the capitalists in seeking the overthrow\r\nof the Kruger government. Christmas day of 1895 found the Johannesburg\r\nreformers so divided in feeling that most of them were in favor of\r\npostponing all action until some definite assurance could be obtained\r\nas to what, and for whom, they were to fight. To this end the President\r\nof the National Union, Mr. Charles Leonard, was sent off to Cape Town\r\nto confer with Mr. Cecil Rhodes.\r\n\r\nIn enlisting Doctor Jameson and his police force in this movement an\r\nuncertain and dangerous factor had been included. The situation became\r\ncritical. Jameson, who had been warned that he must on no account make\r\nany move until he received further orders, grew restive and eager for\r\nthe fray. In Johannesburg the conspirators were in a state of\r\nindecision and alarm. Mr. Cecil Rhodes himself was halting between the\r\ntwo opinions, whether to abandon the enterprise altogether or to\r\nprecipitate the struggle regardless of the divided counsels at\r\nJohannesburg.\r\n\r\nThen the factor of danger declared itself. On the night of the 29th of\r\nDecember, 1895, Doctor Jameson broke his tether and, presumably without\r\norders, invaded the territory of the South African Republic from the\r\nBritish territory of Bechuanaland, at the head of about six hundred\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nJust why Jameson moved at that time probably never will be known. He\r\nhas himself assumed the entire responsibility; Mr. Rhodes and Sir\r\nHercules Robinson, the High Commissioner, have disavowed it utterly.\r\nThere are few who believe that his invasion was intended to initiate\r\nthe revolution. A probable solution of the mystery is that the\r\nrevolutionary programme included (1) a collision between the\r\nconspirators in Johannesburg and the burgher police, (2) the calling in\r\nof the High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, as mediator, (3) the\r\nordering up of Jameson and his force to support the High Commissioner\r\nin any course he might decide upon, and that Jameson thought he could\r\ntime his arrival aright without waiting for further orders.\r\n\r\nBut the skillfully arranged programme was spoiled by the shrewdness of\r\nPresident Kruger. There was no initial conflict in the streets of\r\nJohannesburg. Penetrating the design, the president withdrew all the\r\nTransvaal police from the streets of the city; there was no one to\r\nexchange shots with, and therefore no reason to justify a call for\r\noutside interference.\r\n\r\nBy cutting the telegraph wires Jameson made it impossible for friend or\r\nfoe to know his whereabouts, but the report got abroad that he was\r\ncoming. In Johannesburg some desired, some feared, his coming. A member\r\nof the committee of the National Union assembled a hundred of the\r\nmalcontents and attempted to lead them out to co-operate with the\r\ninvaders, but they tamely surrendered to a burgher force without firing\r\na shot. As for Jameson, on Wednesday, the 1st of January, 1896, he was\r\nchecked near Krugersdorp by a few hundred burghers hastily collected,\r\nand on the next day was surrounded near Doornkop and forced to\r\nsurrender. Thus ended the attempt at revolution.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days which closed 1895 and opened 1896, there was a\r\nstate of social, political and financial chaos in Johannesburg. All\r\nthat was left visible of the reform association was confined within the\r\nwalls of a single clubhouse—a resort of the leading spirits in the\r\nconspiracy. The European population at large seemed to be unaware of\r\nanything connected with the affair but the, to them, unaccountable\r\nsituation—full of peril to life and property—which had been created\r\nthey knew not how. The state of panic was sustained and intensified by\r\nthe wildest rumors of what Jameson was to do, of thousands of burghers\r\nassembling to lay siege to the town, of a purpose to bombard the city\r\nfrom the forts, of a new government about to be proclaimed—indeed,\r\nanything and everything might happen.\r\n\r\nWhen it leaked out that the principal actors in the revolutionary\r\nmovement had secretly removed their families from the city—which was to\r\nbe the storm-center of the expected disturbance—there was a general\r\nstampede. Men and women fought for place on the outgoing trains. In one\r\ntragical instance an overladen train left the track, and forty persons,\r\nmostly women and children, perished. To exaggerate the misery and\r\ndisaster to innocent and peaceable people, caused by this unfortunate\r\nand abortive uprising, would be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the raid was most unfavorable to the return of\r\nanything like good feeling between the British and the Africanders. The\r\nhistoric cablegram of the German Emperor to President Kruger,\r\ncongratulating him on the prompt and easy suppression of the rebellion,\r\nwas construed as evidence that the South African Republic was secretly\r\nconniving at a German rivalry to Great Britain as the paramount power\r\nin South Africa. On the other hand, every burgher in the Transvaal saw\r\nin the conspiracy a new indication of the inexorable hostility of the\r\nBritish to their independence, and of a relentless purpose to subvert\r\nit again by any means necessary to accomplish their end, however unjust\r\nor violent. The effect on the burghers of the raid was much the same as\r\nthat of the blowing up of the Maine on the citizens of the United\r\nStates—a feeling that relations had been created which nothing could\r\nfinally adjust but war.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the intensified bitterness between the two peoples, no\r\none was put to death, nor was any one very seriously punished for\r\ntaking up arms against the Transvaal government. This is to be credited\r\nnot to any doubt or extenuation of their guilt, but to urgent\r\nintercession on the part of the British authorities, and to the wisdom\r\nof those who administered the government whose territory had been\r\ninvaded from the soil of a professedly friendly nation, whose very\r\nexistence had been conspired against by resident aliens, and which had\r\nin its power both the invaders and the resident conspirators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE AFRICANDERS’ SECOND WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.—CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the conspiracy and raid of 1895–1896 the peace of South Africa\r\nand the final paramountcy of Great Britain therein by the mere force of\r\na superior civilization and of preponderating financial and diplomatic\r\nresources, depended upon a policy which was not followed.\r\n\r\nIf the British authorities had eliminated Mr. Cecil Rhodes and his\r\nschemes from the situation, and had suffered matters in South Africa to\r\nreturn to the state which prevailed in 1887, the end would have been\r\ndifferent, and better. At that time the country was being allowed to\r\nmove in an unforced way toward a destiny of settled peace between the\r\ntwo races. A genuine but unaggressive loyalty in the British colonies\r\nwas beginning to develop a reciprocal good will on the part of the two\r\nrepublics, giving promise of a pleasant fellowship of nations in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe result would not have been a confederated South Africa under the\r\nBritish crown; that was and is impossible, both for geographical and\r\npolitical reasons. But there might have been brought about\r\nacquaintanceship and mutual esteem between Great Britain, the would-be\r\nParamount Power, and the Africander race throughout the Transvaal, the\r\nOrange Free State, and the British colonies of Natal and the Cape—which\r\nrace is and will long continue to be the dominant factor in South\r\nAfrica. Out of that friendly relationship might have come a paramount\r\npower to Great Britain well worth the having, and in every way\r\nconsistent with the honor of the British crown and the continued\r\nindependence of the Africander republics.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Rhodes and his projects were not eliminated from the situation.\r\nBy force of almost unequaled genius for acquisition and intrigue, and\r\nof great powers in no least degree controlled by moral considerations,\r\nhe continued to dominate—both locally and in England—the British policy\r\nin South Africa. His presence and influence made final peace in the\r\ncountry impossible on any condition other than the subjugation of the\r\nAfricander Republics. Probably two-thirds of the European population of\r\nSouth Africa believed that he was the chief criminal—though\r\nunpunished—in connection with the conspiracy and raid of 1895–1896. His\r\ninfluence, therefore, had the effect of intensifying the race enmities,\r\nalready the too vigorous growth of a century, and of warning every\r\nAfricander in the two republics to stand armed and ready to defend the\r\nindependence of his country. And these men, to whom Mr. Rhodes’\r\npresence and activities were a constant irritation and threat, loved\r\nfreedom after the fashion of their Netherland forefathers who worsted\r\nSpain in diplomacy and war in the sixteenth century, and after the\r\nfashion of their Huguenot forefathers who counted no sacrifice too\r\ngreat to make for liberty.\r\n\r\nDuring 1896 there was a temporary lull in the agitation for reforms in\r\nthe Transvaal. Investigations had become an international necessity,\r\nfor appearance’s sake if for no other reason; but they led to nothing\r\nexcept the rehabilitation of the principal leaders in the conspiracy\r\nwhich had miscarried. Of necessity Doctor Jameson, and his immediate\r\nassociates in conducting the invasion, were condemned to death by the\r\nTransvaal authorities, for they were taken in the act, and confessed\r\nthemselves guilty of a capital crime. After a time the death sentences\r\nwere reversed, and the offenders were set free.\r\n\r\nBy the opening of 1897 a good degree of order had replaced the state of\r\nchaos into which the uprising had thrown the foreign population and\r\ninterests in the Transvaal. Then the agitation for reforms was renewed,\r\nand the claims of the foreigners were backed up and pressed\r\ndiplomatically by the British government, of which the exponent in the\r\nlong controversy was the Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State\r\nfor the Colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to trace, step by step, the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence on the subject of reforms in the Transvaal during 1897,\r\n1898 and the first two months of 1899. The whole situation—including\r\nevery subject in dispute between the two governments—will come into\r\nview in the discussions and negotiations immediately preceding the\r\noutbreak of the Africanders’ Second War of Independence, in October,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of March, 1899, in reply to a question by Sir E. Ashmead\r\nBartlett as to Great Britain’s right to interfere with the affairs of\r\nthe South African Republic, Mr. Chamberlain, from his place in\r\nparliament, said:\r\n\r\n“There are certain cases where we can intervene, and rightly intervene,\r\nin Transvaal affairs.\r\n\r\n“1. In the first place, we may intervene if there is any breach of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n“2. There is no doubt we should have the usual right of interference if\r\n* * * the treatment of British subjects in the Transvaal was of such\r\nnature as would give us the right to interfere as to the treatment of\r\nBritish subjects in France or Germany.\r\n\r\n“3. Then there is only one other case—the third case. We can make\r\nfriendly recommendations to the Transvaal for the benefit of South\r\nAfrica generally and in the interests of peace.”\r\n\r\nIn concluding Mr. Chamberlain said: “I do not feel at the moment that\r\nany case has arisen which would justify me in taking the strong action\r\nsuggested”; the reference being to the sending of an ultimatum.\r\n\r\nThe next important development was a petition to the Imperial\r\nGovernment, signed by 21,684 British subjects in the Transvaal, praying\r\nfor interference in their behalf. This was forwarded through Mr.\r\nConyngham Greene, the British agent at Pretoria, to Sir Alfred Milner,\r\nGovernor of Cape Colony, who transmitted it to London, where it was\r\nreceived by Mr. Chamberlain on the 14th of April.\r\n\r\nSummarized, the complaints of the petitioners were as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The great majority of the uitlander population consists of British\r\nsubjects who have no share in the government.\r\n\r\n2. Petitions of the uitlanders to the Transvaal government have either\r\nfailed or have been scornfully rejected.\r\n\r\n3. Instead of redressing uitlander grievances, the Transvaal\r\ngovernment, after the Jameson raid, passed laws making their position\r\nmore irksome—i.e., the immigration of aliens act, the press law, the\r\naliens expulsion law. The immigration act was suspended at the\r\ninsistence of the British government, but the others remain in force.\r\n\r\n4. The Transvaal government exercises the power of suppressing\r\npublications devoted to the interests of British uitlanders.\r\n\r\n5. British subjects are expelled from the Transvaal without the right\r\nof appeal to the high court.\r\n\r\n6. The promise of municipal government for the city of Johannesburg has\r\nbeen kept in appearance only. There are 1,039 burghers resident of\r\nJohannesburg, and 23,503 uitlanders, but the law giving each ward of\r\nthe city two members of the council also requires that one of them must\r\nbe a burgher, and the Burgomaster, who is appointed by the government,\r\nhas the casting vote.\r\n\r\n7. The city of Johannesburg is menaced by forts occupied by strong Boer\r\ngarrisons.\r\n\r\n8. The uitlanders of Johannesburg are denied the right to police their\r\nown city.\r\n\r\n9. Trial by jury is a farce, as uitlanders can be tried by burghers\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n10. The uitlanders are deprived of political representation; are taxed\r\nbeyond the requirements of the Transvaal government.\r\n\r\n11. The education of uitlander children is made subject to impossible\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n12. The Boer police give no protection to lives and property in the\r\ncity of Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this petition, dealing with political and other\r\ngrievances, makes no mention of the dynamite monopoly, extortionate\r\nrailway charges, burdensome tariffs on imported foodstuffs, and other\r\nindustrial and commercial grievances of which complaints had been made\r\nat an earlier date. And in judging of this list of complaints it should\r\nbe considered that, with the exception of the eleventh, concerning the\r\neducation of children—which is fatally indefinite in expression—most of\r\nthe conditions complained of are exactly such as would be imposed on a\r\ncity lately in insurrection, and yet inhabited by the same persons who\r\nhad conspired to overthrow the government.\r\n\r\nThe dangerous tension already existing was greatly heightened by a long\r\ntelegraphic communication from Sir Alfred Milner, Governor of Cape\r\nColony, to Mr. Chamberlain, on the 5th of May. After reviewing the\r\nsituation, and reiterating the grievances which British subjects were\r\nsaid to be suffering, and declaring that the spectacle presented “does\r\nsteadily undermine the influence and reputation of Great Britain,” Sir\r\nAlfred revealed the true inwardness of the struggle already begun\r\nbetween the Africanders and the British by saying:\r\n\r\n“A certain section of the press, not in the Transvaal only, preaches\r\nopenly and constantly the doctrine of a republic embracing all South\r\nAfrica, and supports it by menacing references to the armaments of the\r\nTransvaal, its alliance with the Orange Free State, and the active\r\nsympathy which in case of war it would receive from a section of her\r\nMajesty’s subjects.\r\n\r\n“I can see nothing which will put a stop to this mischievous propaganda\r\nbut some striking proof of the intention of her Majesty’s government\r\nnot to be ousted from its position in South Africa.”\r\n\r\nSir Alfred’s reference in the last two paragraphs is to the “Africander\r\nBund,” a society whose ramifications were to be found throughout Natal,\r\nCape Colony, and, indeed, wherever members of the Africander race were\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nHe that runneth may read and understand these luminous words in Sir\r\nAlfred Milner’s dispatch. The coming struggle was not to be about some\r\nforeigners in the Transvaal, but to defeat, in time, the republican\r\naspirations of the whole Africander race, including those in the two\r\nrepublics already established and “a section of her Majesty’s subjects”\r\nin the British territories of Natal and Cape Colony; and the issue was\r\nunderstood to be either “a republic embracing all South\r\nAfrica”—involving the expulsion of the British government “from its\r\nposition in South Africa”—or the defeat of those aspirations in the\r\nestablishing of a confederated South Africa under the British crown.\r\n\r\nIn the light of Sir Alfred’s dispatch one ceases to wonder that all\r\nnegotiations about the uitlander grievances, and that the repeated\r\nconcessions as to the franchise offered by the Transvaal, were without\r\neffect. It is evident that both parties saw inevitable war approaching\r\non quite another and a much larger question.\r\n\r\nThe response of the British government to the uitlanders’ petition, and\r\nto Sir Alfred Milner’s appeal for intervention, was a suggestion that\r\nPresident Kruger and Sir Alfred Milner should meet at Pretoria and\r\nconfer concerning the chief matters in dispute between the two\r\ngovernments. Afterward, upon the invitation of Mr. Steyn, president of\r\nthe Orange Free State, it was decided to hold the conference at\r\nBloemfontein, the capital of the Free State Republic. In accepting the\r\ninvitation to this conference in a telegram dated the 17th of May, Mr.\r\nKruger said:\r\n\r\n“I remain disposed to come to Bloemfontein and will gladly discuss\r\nevery proposal in a friendly way that can conduce to a good\r\nunderstanding between the South African Republic and England, and to\r\nthe maintenance of peace in South Africa, provided that the\r\nindependence of this republic is not impugned.”\r\n\r\nThe date selected for the first meeting between Mr. Kruger and Sir\r\nAlfred was the 31st of May. On the 22d Sir Alfred telegraphed Mr.\r\nChamberlain asking for final instructions to guide him in the\r\napproaching conference, and outlining his own views of the situation\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n“It is my own inclination to put in the foreground the question of the\r\nuitlanders’ grievances, treating it as broadly as possible, and\r\ninsisting that it is necessary, in order to relieve the situation, that\r\nuitlanders should obtain some substantial degree of representation by\r\nlegislation to be passed this session. Following would be the general\r\nline:\r\n\r\n“Franchise after six years, retroactive, and at least seven members for\r\nthe Rand” (the mining district). “Present number of Volksraad of South\r\nAfrica being twenty-eight, this would make one-fifth of it uitlander\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n“If President Kruger will not agree to anything like this, I should try\r\nmunicipal government for the whole Rand as an alternative, with wide\r\npowers, including control of police.\r\n\r\n“If he rejects this, too, I do not see much use in discussing the\r\nvarious outstanding questions between the two governments in detail,\r\nsuch as dynamite, violations of Zululand boundary, ‘Critic’ case, Cape\r\nboys and Indians, though it would be desirable to allude to them in\r\ncourse of discussion, and point out the gravity of having so many\r\nsubjects of dispute unsettled.”\r\n\r\nIn a telegram, dated the 24th of May, Mr. Chamberlain instructed Sir\r\nAlfred Milner, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n“I think personally you should lay all stress on the question of\r\nfranchise in first instance. Other reforms are less pressing and will\r\ncome in time if this can be arranged satisfactorily and form of oath\r\nmodified. Redistribution is reasonable, and you might accept a moderate\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\n“If fair terms of franchise are refused by President Kruger it is\r\nhardly worth while to bring forward other matters, such as aliens,\r\ncolored people, education, dynamite, etc., at the conference, and the\r\nwhole situation must be reconsidered.”\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May, 1899, Sir Alfred Milner and President Kruger met in\r\nconference at Bloemfontein. Their negotiations form one of the most\r\ninteresting features of the controversy between the two governments.\r\nThe results of the conference, in brief, were as follows. For the\r\nuitlanders, Sir Alfred demanded that:\r\n\r\n“Every foreigner who can prove satisfactorily that he has been a\r\nresident in the country for five years; that he desires to make it his\r\npermanent place of residence; that he is prepared to take the oath to\r\nobey the laws, to undertake all obligations of citizenship, and to\r\ndefend the independence of the country; should be allowed to become a\r\ncitizen on taking that oath.”\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner modified these proposals by suggesting that the\r\nfranchise be restricted to persons possessing a specific amount of\r\nproperty or of yearly wages, and who have good characters. He asked,\r\nfurther, that “in order to make that proposal of any real use for the\r\nnew citizens, who mostly live in one district, * * * there should be a\r\ncertain number of new constituencies created,” and that “the number of\r\nthese districts should not be so small as to leave the representatives\r\nof the new population in a contemptible minority.”\r\n\r\nPresident Kruger did not accept Sir Alfred’s proposals, and submitted\r\ncounter proposals as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n“1. Every person who fixes his residence in the South African Republic\r\nhas to get himself registered on the Field Cornet’s books within\r\nfourteen days after his arrival, according to the existing law. He will\r\nbe able after complying with the conditions under ‘A’ and after the\r\nlapse of two years to get himself naturalized, and will, five years\r\nafter naturalization, on complying with the conditions under ‘B,’\r\nobtain the full franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                “A.\r\n\r\n    “1. Six months’ notice of intention to apply for naturalization. 2.\r\n    Two years’ continuous residence. 3. Residence in the South African\r\n    Republic during that time. 4. No dishonoring sentence. 5. Proof of\r\n    obedience to laws; no act against the government or independence.\r\n    6. Proof of full state citizenship and franchise or title thereto\r\n    in former country. 7. Possession of unmortgaged property to the\r\n    value of £150; or occupation of house to the rental of £50 per\r\n    annum; or yearly income of at least £200. Nothing, however, shall\r\n    prevent the government from granting naturalization to persons who\r\n    have not satisfied this condition. 8. Taking of an oath similar to\r\n    that of the Orange Free State.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                “B.\r\n\r\n    “1. Continuous registration for five years after naturalization. 2.\r\n    Continuous residence during that period. 3. No dishonoring\r\n    sentence. 4. Proof of obedience to laws. 5. Proof that applicant\r\n    still complies with the condition of A 7.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a memorandum which is a part of the records of the conference Sir\r\nAlfred Milner admitted that President Kruger’s proposals were “a\r\nconsiderable advance upon the existing provisions as to franchise.” But\r\nhe intimated that they stopped far short of the solution he had\r\nsuggested, and which, he said, “alone appeared to be adequate to the\r\nneeds of the case.” He also declared it a waste of time to discuss\r\nfurther details; and so the conference ended in failure.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the failure of the conference, the Volksraad of the\r\nSouth African Republic passed a seven years’ retroactive franchise law\r\non the 19th of July, 1899. This law was somewhat modified from the\r\nproposals submitted by President Kruger at the conference. It also gave\r\nthe uitlanders additional representation in both raads, which President\r\nKruger announced on the 27th of July as follows:\r\n\r\n“By virtue of the powers conferred upon them the Executive Council\r\nyesterday decided to give three new members in each Volksraad for the\r\nWitwatersrand gold fields. That is to say, there are at present two\r\nmembers for both raads; the number will be increased to eight, four to\r\nsit in the first and four in the second raad. With the De Kaap\r\nrepresentative, there will now be five members to represent the mining\r\nindustry in a proposed enlarged legislature of thirty-one members.”\r\n\r\nIn London it was believed that the action of the Volksraad was a long\r\nstride toward a peaceful solution of the difficulties. In the House of\r\nCommons Mr. Chamberlain, after reading a telegram from Sir Alfred\r\nMilner announcing the action of the Volksraad, said:\r\n\r\n“I have no official information as to the redistribution, but it has\r\nbeen stated that the government of the South African Republic proposes\r\nto give seven new seats to the district chiefly inhabited by aliens.\r\n\r\n“If this report is confirmed this important change in the proposals of\r\nPresident Kruger, coupled with previous amendments, leads the\r\ngovernment to hope that the new law may prove a basis of a settlement\r\non the lines laid down by Sir Alfred Milner at the Bloemfontein\r\nconference.”\r\n\r\nBut somewhere in the counsels by which the British authorities acted at\r\nthis time there was an element of suspicion and of yet unsatisfied\r\naggression, which did not make for a peaceful settlement. After the\r\nVolksraad of the South African Republic had passed the seven years’\r\nfranchise law, together with enlarged representation of the uitlanders\r\nin both raads, and after Mr. Chamberlain had made his hopeful\r\nannouncement in the House of Commons, the whole subject was reopened by\r\na new request. The Transvaal government was asked to agree that a joint\r\ncommission of inquiry, made up of expert delegates representing the\r\nTransvaal and the British government, should be appointed to\r\ninvestigate the exact effect of the new franchise law.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this request fell as a shock upon a\r\ngovernment which had received from the power making this and other\r\nextraordinary demands a guaranty, in the convention of 1884, that it\r\nshould be in every sense independent in the management of its internal\r\naffairs. On the 21st of August President Kruger formally declined to\r\naccede to the request for a joint committee to investigate the effect\r\nof the new franchise law, and submitted an alternative proposition: The\r\nSouth African Republic would give a five years’ retroactive franchise,\r\neight new seats in the Volksraad and a vote for President and\r\nCommandant-General, conditioned upon Great Britain consenting:\r\n\r\n“1. In the future not to interfere in the internal affairs of the\r\nTransvaal Republic. 2. Not to insist further on its assertion of the\r\nexistence of suzerainty. 3. To agree to arbitration.”\r\n\r\nIn a dispatch dated the 2d of September, 1899, Mr. Chamberlain, having\r\nrejected President Kruger’s alternative proposals, suggested another\r\nconference, to be held at Cape Town, and ended with the significant\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n“Her Majesty’s government also desires to remind the government of the\r\nSouth African Republic that there are other matters of difference\r\nbetween the two governments which will not be settled by the grant of\r\npolitical representation to the uitlanders, and which are not proper\r\nsubjects for reference to arbitration.”\r\n\r\nIn dispatches printed on the 7th of September President Kruger\r\nsignified a willingness to attend the Cape Town conference, and, while\r\nholding that no good could come of a joint inquiry into the effect of\r\nthe new franchise law, he would agree that British representatives\r\nshould make an independent inquiry, after which any suggestions they\r\nmight make would be submitted to the raad. Concerning suzerainty he\r\nannounced the unalterable purpose of his people to adhere absolutely to\r\nthe convention of 1884.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of September the British cabinet formulated a note to the\r\nSouth African Republic very much in the nature of an ultimatum,\r\nrefusing point blank to entertain the proposal that Great Britain\r\nshould relinquish suzerainty over the Transvaal and pointedly\r\nintimating that the offer of a joint inquiry into the effect of the\r\nseven years’ franchise law would not remain open indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal’s rejoinder, printed unofficially on the 16th of\r\nSeptember, announced that the South African Republic withdrew the\r\nproposal to give a five years’ franchise, that it would adhere to the\r\noriginal seven years’ law already passed by the Volksraad, and that it\r\nwould, if necessary, adopt any suggestions Great Britain might make\r\nwith reference to the practical workings of the law.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of September, after three days’ consideration, the British\r\ncabinet gave out the text of another note to the South African\r\nRepublic, which read as follows:\r\n\r\n“The object Her Majesty’s government had in view in the recent\r\nnegotiations has been stated in a manner which cannot admit of\r\nmisunderstanding—viz.: To obtain such substantial and immediate\r\nrepresentation for the outlanders as will enable them to secure for\r\nthemselves that fair and just treatment which was formally promised\r\nthem in 1881, and which Her Majesty intended to secure for them when\r\nshe granted privileges of self-government to the Transvaal.\r\n\r\n“No conditions less comprehensive than those contained in the telegram\r\nof September 8 can be relied on to effect this object.\r\n\r\n“The refusal of the South African government to entertain the offer\r\nthus made—coming, as it does, after four months of protracted\r\nnegotiations, themselves the climax of five years of extended\r\nagitation—makes it useless to further pursue the discussion on the\r\nlines hitherto followed, and the imperial government is now compelled\r\nto consider the situation afresh and formulate its own proposals for a\r\nfinal settlement of the issues which have been created in South Africa\r\nby the policy constantly followed by the government of South Africa.\r\n\r\n“They will communicate the result of their deliberations in a later\r\ndispatch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE AFRICANDERS’ SECOND WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.—CONCLUDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “later dispatch” promised by the British cabinet was never sent.\r\nThe answer to it of the Transvaal government was, therefore, delayed\r\nfor several days, awaiting the new proposals that were to come as the\r\nresult of further deliberations on the part of Her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment. At last, on the eve of the outbreak of war, Mr. Chamberlain\r\ngave out, on the 10th of October, the text of the republic’s rejoinder\r\nto the British cabinet’s note of the 25th of September. It was\r\ntransmitted by cable, through Sir Alfred Milner, and read thus:\r\n\r\n“Dear Sir: The government of the South African Republic feels itself\r\ncompelled to refer the government of Her Majesty, Queen of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, once more to the convention of London, 1884,\r\nconcluded between this republic and the United Kingdom, and which, in\r\nArticle XIV., secures certain specific rights to the white population\r\nof this republic—namely: That all persons other than natives, on\r\nconforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic—\r\n\r\n“A—Will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel or\r\nreside in any part of the South African Republic.\r\n\r\n“B—They will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories,\r\nwarehouses, shops and other premises.\r\n\r\n“C—They may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents\r\nwhom they may think fit to employ.\r\n\r\n“D—They shall not be subject, in respect of their premises or property\r\nor in respect of their commerce and industry, to any taxes other than\r\nthose which are or may be imposed upon the citizens of the said\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n“This government wishes further to observe that these are the only\r\nrights which Her Majesty’s government has reserved in the above\r\nconvention with regard to the outlander population of this republic,\r\nand that a violation only of those rights could give that government a\r\nright to diplomatic representations or intervention; while, moreover,\r\nthe regulation of all other questions affecting the position of the\r\nrights of the outlander population under the above-mentioned convention\r\nis handed over to the government and representatives of the people of\r\nthe South African Republic.\r\n\r\n“Among the questions the regulation of which falls exclusively within\r\nthe competence of this government and of the Volksraad are included\r\nthose of the franchise and the representation of the people in this\r\nrepublic; and, although this exclusive right of this government and of\r\nthe Volksraad for the regulation of the franchise and the\r\nrepresentation of the people is indisputable, yet this government has\r\nfound occasion to discuss, in friendly fashion, the franchise and\r\nrepresentation of the people with Her Majesty’s government—without,\r\nhowever, recognizing any right thereto on the part of Her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n“This government has also, by the formulation of the now existing\r\nfranchise law and by a resolution with regard to the representation,\r\nconstantly held these friendly discussions before its eyes. On the part\r\nof Her Majesty’s government, however, the friendly nature of these\r\ndiscussions has assumed more and more a threatening tone, and the minds\r\nof the people of this republic and the whole of South Africa have been\r\nexcited and a condition of extreme tension has been created, owing to\r\nthe fact that Her Majesty’s government could no longer agree to the\r\nlegislation respecting the franchise and the resolution respecting\r\nrepresentation in this republic, and, finally, by your note of Sept.\r\n25, 1899, which broke off all friendly correspondence on the subject\r\nand intimated that Her Majesty’s government must now proceed to\r\nformulate its own proposals for the final settlement.\r\n\r\n“This government can only see in the above intimation from Her\r\nMajesty’s government a new violation of the convention of London, 1884,\r\nwhich does not reserve to Her Majesty’s government the right to a\r\nunilateral settlement of a question which is exclusively a domestic one\r\nfor this government, and which has been already regulated by this\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n“On account of the strained situation and the consequent serious loss\r\nin and interruption of trade in general, which the correspondence\r\nrespecting franchise and the representation of the people of this\r\nrepublic has carried in its train, Her Majesty’s government has\r\nrecently pressed for an early settlement, and finally pressed, by your\r\nintervention, for an answer within forty-eight hours, a demand\r\nsubsequently somewhat modified, to your note of September 12, replied\r\nto by the note of this government of September 15, and to your note of\r\nSeptember 25, 1899, and thereafter further friendly negotiations were\r\nbroken off, this government receiving an intimation that a proposal for\r\na final settlement would shortly be made.\r\n\r\n“Although this promise was once more repeated, the proposal, up to now,\r\nhas not reached this government.\r\n\r\n“Even while this friendly correspondence was still going on the\r\nincrease of troops on a large scale was introduced by Her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment, the troops being stationed in the neighborhood of the\r\nborders of this republic.\r\n\r\n“Having regard to occurrences in the history of this republic, which it\r\nis unnecessary here to call to mind, this republic felt obliged to\r\nregard this military force in the neighborhood of its borders as a\r\nthreat against the independence of the South African Republic, since it\r\nwas aware of no circumstances which could justify the presence of such\r\na military force in South Africa and in the neighborhood of its\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n“In answer to an inquiry with respect thereto, addressed to His\r\nExcellency, the High Commissioner, this government received, to its\r\ngreat astonishment, in answer a veiled insinuation that from the side\r\nof the republic an attack was being made on Her Majesty’s colonies,\r\nand, at the same time, a mysterious reference to possibilities whereby\r\nthis government was strengthened in its suspicion that the independence\r\nof this republic was being threatened.\r\n\r\n“As a defensive measure this government was, therefore, obliged to send\r\na portion of the burghers of this republic in order to offer requisite\r\nresistance to similar possibilities.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this correspondence that the British government\r\nhad failed to send the formulation of “its own proposals for a final\r\nsettlement” promised in the note of September 25, and that active\r\npreparations for war, even to the mobilization of troops, had been\r\ngoing on—on both sides—for some weeks.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August, forty-nine days before the British cabinet\r\nengaged to prolong friendly diplomatic correspondence on the subjects\r\nat issue by promising a later dispatch containing its own proposals for\r\na final settlement, Mr. Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of\r\nCommons which has become historic—a speech which signified past all\r\npossibility of mistake that at that early date war was a foregone\r\nconclusion. After deprecating the use of the word “war” unless it were\r\nabsolutely necessary, he went on to say:\r\n\r\n“The government had stated that they recognized the grievances under\r\nwhich their subjects in Africa were laboring. They had stated that they\r\nfound those grievances not only in themselves a serious cause for\r\ninterposition, but a source of danger to the whole of South Africa.\r\n\r\n“They (the government) said that their predominance, which both sides\r\nof the House had constantly asserted, was menaced by the action of the\r\nTransvaal government in refusing the redress of grievances, and in\r\nrefusing any consideration of the requests hitherto put in the most\r\nmoderate language of the suzerain power. They said that that was a\r\nstate of things which could not be long tolerated. They had said: ‘We\r\nhave put our hands to the plow and we will not turn back,’ and with\r\nthat statement I propose to rest content.”\r\n\r\nLanguage could not be plainer. It was the British government’s demand\r\nthat the South African Republic must accept British control of her\r\ninternal affairs—of affairs so purely domestic as the franchise and the\r\nrepresentation of her citizens—or fight. It is not a little remarkable\r\nin this connection that Germany, France, the United States of America\r\nand other powerful nations whose subjects were mingled with the English\r\nin that vast foreign population in the Transvaal, heard of no\r\ngrievances inflicted on their subjects by the South African Republic\r\nsufficient to call forth even a friendly diplomatic representation and\r\nrequest for redress.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August the 8th, the day after Mr. Chamberlain’s\r\nwarlike speech, the London papers announced that the Liverpool and\r\nManchester regiments, then at the Cape, had been ordered to Natal; that\r\nthe Fifteenth Hussars were to embark on the 23d of August, and that\r\ntroops were to be massed along the Transvaal frontier. On the 11th of\r\nAugust it was announced that 12,000 British troops were to be\r\ndispatched from India to South Africa, and on the same day a large\r\nconsignment of war stores, including medical requisites, was given out\r\nfrom the royal arsenal, Woolwich, for shipment to Natal, and the sum of\r\n$2,000,000 in gold was sent to South Africa for the War Office account.\r\nBritish troops began to arrive in South Africa from India and from\r\nEngland in the first week of October. By the 10th some 15,000 had\r\nlanded. These were hurried to the frontiers of the Orange Free\r\nState—both west and east—most of them being concentrated along the\r\nnorthern boundary of Natal, convenient to the southern frontier of the\r\nTransvaal.\r\n\r\nThe government of the South African Republic made no mistake as to the\r\nmeaning of Chamberlain’s belligerent speech in the House of Commons. On\r\nthe 8th of August orders were given for the purchase of 1,000 trek\r\noxen, to be used in the operations of the commissary department. On the\r\n11th the German steamer Reichstag arrived at Lorenzo Marquez with 401\r\ncases of ammunition. On the 12th it was decided to proceed at once with\r\nthe construction of fortified camps at Laing’s Nek and Majuba Hill, and\r\norders were issued for the preparation of armored trains. The\r\nmobilization of artillery was begun on the 13th, and the next day that\r\nforce went into camps of instruction to learn the handling of guns of\r\nthe latest pattern. On the 14th of August the Field Cornets were\r\nordered to distribute Mauser rifles to the burghers, and the government\r\nbegan the purchase of mules, provisions and general war supplies. Large\r\nquantities of arms and ammunition were dispatched on the 15th of August\r\nto Oudtshoorn, Aliwal Bethany, and other points in Cape Colony and the\r\nOrange Free State for the use of any Africanders who should rise\r\nagainst Great Britain when hostilities began. On the 19th of August\r\nanother German steamer, the Kœnig, arrived in Delagoa Bay with 2,000\r\ncases of cartridges for the Transvaal government. The same day fifty\r\ncases of ammunition each were dispatched to Kimberley, Jagersfontein\r\nand Aliwal North for the arming of sympathizers in those districts of\r\nCape Colony. On the same day 300 Transvaal artillerists, with guns,\r\nammunition and camp equipage, left Johannesburg for Komati Pass, in the\r\nLibombo Mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd so it went on during the “friendly diplomatic correspondence,”\r\nwhich terminated on the 25th of September—awaiting the “later dispatch”\r\nfrom the British cabinet, which never came; both sides arming and\r\nmaneuvering for strategic advantages in preparation for the struggle\r\nthat was seen to be inevitable.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that all the days spent in waiting for that “later dispatch”\r\nwere being used by Great Britain in massing her gigantic powers of war\r\nin South Africa and along the Transvaal frontier, and believing that no\r\nsuch dispatch would now come until the points of war were all secured\r\nby his great antagonist, President Kruger at last astonished the\r\nworld—and, most of all, Great Britain—by issuing an ultimatum\r\nsufficiently bold and defiant to have come from any of the first-rate\r\npowers of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe document was dated 5 o’clock, p. m., on Monday, October the 9th,\r\nand read as follows:\r\n\r\n“Her Majesty’s unlawful intervention in the internal affairs of this\r\nrepublic, in conflict with the London convention of 1884, and by the\r\nextraordinary strengthening of her troops in the neighborhood of the\r\nborders of this republic, has caused an intolerable condition of things\r\nto arise, to which this government feels itself obliged, in the\r\ninterest not only of this republic, but also of all South Africa, to\r\nmake an end as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“This government feels itself called upon and obliged to press\r\nearnestly and with emphasis for an immediate termination of this state\r\nof things, and to request Her Majesty’s government to give assurances\r\nupon the following four demands:\r\n\r\n“First—That all points of mutual difference be regulated by friendly\r\nrecourse to arbitration or by whatever amicable way may be agreed upon\r\nby this government and Her Majesty’s government.\r\n\r\n“Second—That all troops on the borders of this republic shall be\r\ninstantly withdrawn.\r\n\r\n“Third—That all re-enforcements of troops which have arrived in South\r\nAfrica since June 1, 1899, shall be removed from South Africa within a\r\nreasonable time, to be agreed upon with this government, and with the\r\nmutual assurance and guaranty on the part of this government that no\r\nattack upon or hostilities against any portion of the possessions of\r\nthe British government shall be made by this republic during the\r\nfurther negotiations within a period of time to be subsequently agreed\r\nupon between the governments; and this government will, on compliance\r\ntherewith, be prepared to withdraw the burghers of this republic from\r\nthe borders.\r\n\r\n“Fourth—That Her Majesty’s troops which are now on the high seas shall\r\nnot be landed in any part of South Africa.\r\n\r\n“This government presses for an immediate and an affirmative answer to\r\nthese four questions and earnestly requests Her Majesty’s government to\r\nreturn an answer before or upon Wednesday, October 11, 1899, not later\r\nthan 5 o’clock p. m.\r\n\r\n“It desires further to add that in the unexpected event of an answer\r\nnot satisfactory being received by it within the interval, it will with\r\ngreat regret be compelled to regard the action of Her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment as a formal declaration of war and will not hold itself\r\nresponsible for the consequences thereof, and that, in the event of any\r\nfurther movement of troops occurring within the above-mentioned time in\r\na nearer direction to our borders, this government will be compelled to\r\nregard that also as a formal declaration of war.”\r\n\r\nThis document was signed by F. W. Reitz, State Secretary, and handed by\r\nhim to Mr. Conyngham Greene, Her Majesty’s agent at Pretoria. On\r\nWednesday afternoon, October the 11th, at 3 o’clock, Mr. Greene\r\ndelivered the reply of his government, which read thus:\r\n\r\n“Her Majesty’s government declines even to consider the peremptory\r\ndemands of the Transvaal government.”\r\n\r\nWithin an hour the telegraphic wires had flashed through all the South\r\nAfrican Republic the ominous word “Oorlog”—war!\r\n\r\nMr. Conyngham Greene at once asked for his passport, and on the next\r\nday, October the 12th, with his family, he was sent, attended by a\r\nguard of honor, to the border of the Orange Free State, where a similar\r\nguard received and conducted him to British territory in Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nThursday, the 12th of October, was a busy and exciting day in both the\r\nTransvaal and the Orange Free State—for the two republics stood as one\r\nin the struggle. That night—twenty-four hours after war had been\r\ndeclared—30,000 burghers were on the borders ready to do battle. Of\r\nthese 20,000 invaded Natal under General Joubert, and the vanguard\r\nunder General Kock occupied Newcastle on the 13th of October. The other\r\n10,000, under General Piet Cronje, crossed the western border into\r\nBritish Bechuanaland and marched on Mafeking.\r\n\r\nThus, and for the causes set forth, began the Africanders’ Second War\r\nof Independence. It was not in the proposed scope of this book to treat\r\nof its fortunes. The prospect is that it will be a long and sanguinary\r\nwar. The story of it will afford abundant and interesting matter for a\r\nlater volume.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to show that in all the matters in dispute between the\r\ngovernment of the Transvaal and that of Great Britain, and in the war\r\nwhich resulted therefrom, the two Africander republics acted in\r\nsolidarity. Early in November, 1899, the President of the Orange Free\r\nState announced this to his people and to the world in the following\r\nproclamation:\r\n\r\n“Burghers of the Orange Free State: The time which we had so much\r\ndesired to avoid—the moment when we as a nation are compelled with arms\r\nto oppose injustice and shameless violence—is at hand. Our sister\r\nrepublic to the north of the Vaal river is about to be attacked by an\r\nunscrupulous enemy, who for many years has prepared herself and sought\r\npretexts for the violence of which he is now guilty, whose purpose is\r\nto destroy the existence of the Africander race.\r\n\r\n“With our sister republic we are not only bound by ties of blood, of\r\nsympathy and of common interests, but also by formal treaty which has\r\nbeen necessitated by circumstances. This treaty demands of us that we\r\nassist her if she should be unjustly attacked, which we unfortunately\r\nfor a long time have had too much reason to expect. We therefore cannot\r\npassively look on while injustice is done her, and while also our own\r\ndearly bought freedom is endangered, but are called as men to resist,\r\ntrusting the Almighty, firmly believing that He will never permit\r\ninjustice and unrighteousness to triumph.\r\n\r\n“Now that we thus resist a powerful enemy, with whom it has always been\r\nour highest desire to live in friendship, notwithstanding injustice and\r\nwrong done by him to us in the past, we solemnly declare in the\r\npresence of the Almighty God that we are compelled thereto by the\r\ninjustice done to our kinsmen and by the consciousness that the end of\r\ntheir independence will make our existence as an independent state of\r\nno significance, and that their fate, should they be obliged to bend\r\nunder an overwhelming power, will also soon after be our own fate.\r\n\r\n“Solemn treaties have not protected our sister republic against\r\nannexation, against conspiracy, against the claim of an abolished\r\nsuzerainty, against continuous oppression and interference, and now\r\nagainst a renewed attack which aims only at her downfall.\r\n\r\n“Our own unfortunate experiences in the past have also made it\r\nsufficiently clear to us that we cannot rely on the most solemn\r\npromises and agreements of Great Britain, when she has at her helm a\r\ngovernment prepared to trample on treaties, to look for feigned\r\npretexts for every violation of good faith by her committed. This is\r\nproved among other things by the unjust and unlawful British\r\nintervention, after we had overcome an armed and barbarous black tribe\r\non our eastern frontier, as also by the forcible appropriation of the\r\ndominion over part of our territory where the discovery of diamonds had\r\ncaused the desire for this appropriation, although contrary to existing\r\ntreaties. The desire and intention to trample on our rights as an\r\nindependent and sovereign nation, notwithstanding a solemn convention\r\nexisting between this state and Great Britain, have also been more than\r\nonce and are now again shown by the present government, by giving\r\nexpressions in public documents to an unfounded claim of paramountcy\r\nover the whole of South Africa, and therefore also over this state.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the South African Republic, Great Britain has moreover\r\nrefused until the present to allow her to regain her original position\r\nin respect to foreign affairs, a position which she had lost in no\r\nsense by her own faults. The original intention of the conventions to\r\nwhich the republic had consented under pressure and circumstances has\r\nbeen perverted and continually been used by the present British\r\nadministration as a means for the practice of tyranny and of injustice,\r\nand, among other things, for the support of a revolutionary propaganda\r\nwithin the republic in favor of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n“And while no redress has been offered, as justice demands, for\r\ninjustice done to the South African Republic on the part of the British\r\ngovernment; and while no gratitude is exhibited for the magnanimity\r\nshown at the request of the British government to British subjects who\r\nhad forfeited under the laws of the republic their lives and property,\r\nyet no feeling of shame has prevented the British government, now that\r\nthe gold mines of immense value have been discovered in the country, to\r\nmake claims of the republic, the consequence of which, if allowed, will\r\nbe that those who—or whose forefathers—have saved the country from\r\nbarbarism and have won it for civilization with their blood and their\r\ntears, will lose their control over the interests of the country to\r\nwhich they are justly entitled according to divine and human laws. The\r\nconsequence of these claims would be, moreover, that the greater part\r\nof the power will be placed in the hands of those who, foreigners by\r\nbirth, enjoy the privilege of depriving the country of its chief\r\ntreasure, while they have never shown any loyalty to a foreign\r\ngovernment. Besides, the inevitable consequence of the acceptance of\r\nthese claims would be that the independence of the country as a\r\nself-governing, independent sovereign republic would be irreparably\r\nlost. For years past British troops in great numbers have been placed\r\non the frontiers of our sister republic in order to compel her by fear\r\nto accede to the demands which would be pressed upon her, and in order\r\nto encourage revolutionary disturbances and the cunning plans of those\r\nwhose greed for gold is the cause of their shameless undertakings.\r\n\r\n“Those plans have now reached their climax in the open violence to\r\nwhich the present British government now resorts. While we readily\r\nacknowledge the honorable character of thousands of Englishmen who\r\nloathe such deeds of robbery and wrong, we cannot but abhor the\r\nshameless breaking of treaties, the feigned pretexts for the\r\ntransgression of law, the violation of international law and of justice\r\nand the numerous right-rending deeds of the British statesmen, who will\r\nnow force a war upon the South African Republic. On their heads be the\r\nguilt of blood, and may a just Providence reward all as they deserve.\r\n\r\n“Burghers of the Orange Free State, rise as one man against the\r\noppressor and the violator of right!\r\n\r\n“In the strife to which we are now driven have care to commit no deed\r\nunworthy of a Christian and of a burgher of the Orange Free State. Let\r\nus look forward with confidence to a fortunate end of this conflict,\r\ntrusting to the Higher Power without whose help human weapons are of no\r\navail.\r\n\r\n“May He bless our arms. Under His banner we advance to battle for\r\nliberty and for fatherland.\r\n\r\n    M. T. Steyn, State President.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY OF THE AFRICANDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of the physical structure of South Africa is necessary\r\nto an understanding of its resources, economic conditions and the\r\nlongstanding political problems which, to all appearance, are now\r\nnearing a final solution.\r\n\r\nNature has divided that part of Africa lying south of the Zambesi River\r\ninto three distinct and well-defined regions. A strip of lowland skirts\r\nthe coast of the Indian Ocean all the way from Cape Town around to\r\nNatal, Delagoa Bay and still northeast to the mouths of the Zambesi.\r\nBetween Durban, the principal port of Natal, and Cape Town this strip\r\nis very narrow in places—the hills coming down almost to the margin of\r\nthe sea. Beyond Durban, to the northeast, the low plain grows wider.\r\nThis belt of lowland is more or less swampy, and from Durban northward\r\nis exceedingly malarious and unhealthful. This feature is a prime\r\nfactor in the physical structure of the country and has had much to do\r\nwith shaping its history.\r\n\r\nThe second region is composed of the elevated and much broken surface\r\npresented by the Drakensburg or Quathlamba range of mountains, reaching\r\nfrom Cape Town to the Zambesi Valley—a distance of sixteen hundred\r\nmiles. In traveling inland, after leaving the level belt, at from\r\nthirty to sixty miles from the sea the hills rise higher and\r\nhigher—from three thousand to six thousand feet. These hills are only\r\nthe spurs of the principal range, some of whose peaks rise to an\r\nelevation of eleven thousand feet.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Quathlamba Mountains, to the west and north, is the third\r\nnatural division of South Africa—a vast tableland or plateau, varying\r\nfrom three thousand to five thousand feet above the sea level. This\r\nregion occupies about seven-eighths of the area of South Africa.\r\n\r\nTo a bird’s-eye view of the country the physical scheme is exceedingly\r\nsimple—a great plateau filling the interior, a belt of lowland\r\nbordering the Indian Ocean and one principal mountain range between the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nGeologically considered, the oldest formation is found in the northern\r\npart of the tableland and toward the northeastern end of the Quathlamba\r\nMountains. The principal formations in this region are granite and\r\ngneiss, believed to be of great antiquity—probably of the same age as\r\nthe Laurentian formations in America. The rocks of the Karoo district\r\nare not so ancient. There are no traces anywhere in South Africa of\r\nlate volcanic action, nor has any active volcano been discovered there;\r\nbut eruptive rocks of ancient date—porphyries and greenstones—are found\r\noverlying the sedimentary deposits in the Karoo district and in the\r\nmountain systems of Basutoland and the Orange Free State.\r\n\r\nThe African coast is notably poor in harbors. There is no haven between\r\nCape Town and Durban. From Durban to the Zambesi there are but two good\r\nports—that of Delagoa Bay and Beira. With the exception of Saldanha\r\nBay, twenty miles north of Cape Town, the western coast, for a thousand\r\nmiles, has no harbor.\r\n\r\nThe temperature in Southern Africa is much lower than the latitude\r\nwould lead one to expect. This is accounted for by the fact that there\r\nis a vast preponderance of water in the southern hemisphere, which has\r\nthe effect of giving a cooler temperature than prevails in a\r\ncorresponding northern latitude. The difference in both heat and cold\r\nrepresents over two degrees of difference in latitude. Thus, Cape Town,\r\n34° S., has a lower temperature in both summer and winter than\r\nGibraltar and Aleppo, in 36° N. Nevertheless, the thermometer registers\r\nhigh in some parts of South Africa. Even at Durban, in latitude 30° S.,\r\nthe heat is often severe, and the northern part of the Transvaal and\r\nthe British territories to the north of it lie within the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn. The mean temperature in South Africa proper is 70°\r\nFahrenheit in January and 80° in July.\r\n\r\nOver most of the country the climate is exceptionally dry. In the\r\nregion of Cape Colony there are well-defined summer and winter; but in\r\nthe rest of South Africa for about two-thirds of the year there is only\r\na dry season, when the weather is cooler, and a wet season of four or\r\nfive months, when the sun is the highest and the heat is most intense.\r\nThe rainy season is not so continuous, nor is there so great a\r\nprecipitation, as in some other hot countries. In the parts where the\r\nrainfall is heaviest, averaging over thirty inches in the year, the\r\nmoisture soon disappears by evaporation and absorption, and the surface\r\nremains parched till the next wet season. As a consequence of this the\r\nair is generally dry, clear and stimulating.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the effect upon climate of the physical\r\nstructure described above. The prevailing and rain-bringing winds are\r\nfrom the east and the southeast. They bring sufficient moisture to the\r\nlow plain along the sea coast, and passing inland the rain-bearing\r\nclouds water the foothills of the Quathlamba Mountains and precipitate\r\nsnow on the loftier peaks beyond them. A portion of the moisture is\r\ncarried still farther to the west and falls in showers on the eastern\r\npart of the plateau—the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, the eastern\r\nborder of Bechuanaland and the region northward toward the Zambesi.\r\nSections farther to the north and west receive but little of the annual\r\nrainfall, ranging from five to ten inches in the year. That little is\r\nsoon dissipated, the surface becomes dry and hard, and such vegetation\r\nas springs up under the brief showers soon dies. Much of this region is\r\na desert, and so must remain until more and more continuous moisture is\r\nsupplied, either by artificial irrigation or by some favorable change\r\nin natural conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom these permanent physical features—the lowlands along the coast,\r\nthe elevated plateau in the interior, the mountain range running\r\nbetween them, a burning sun and a dry atmosphere—have developed many of\r\nthe other natural phenomena of South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe rivers of that country—laid down in great numbers on the maps—are\r\nnot rivers during much of the year. In the dry season they are either\r\nwithout water altogether or consist of a succession of little pools\r\nscarcely sufficient to supply the cattle on their banks with drink. And\r\nwhen they are rivers they are, most of the time, such as can neither be\r\nforded nor navigated; the violent rains—continuing for hours and\r\nsometimes for many days—have converted them into roaring torrents.\r\n\r\nNow, if that country could have been entered by waterways, as were\r\nNorth and South America, it would not have remained an unknown land so\r\nlong. But there was no other means of penetrating it than the lumbering\r\nox-wagon, making at best a dozen miles a day, with frequent long halts\r\nin the neighborhood of good grass in order to rest and recuperate the\r\ncattle. It is this lack of navigable rivers that now compels the people\r\nto depend exclusively on railways for internal transportation and\r\ntravel. With the exception of tidal streams there is no internal water\r\ncommunication of any value.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the east coast rivers arises out of the nearness\r\nof the Quathlamba Mountains to the sea. Such rivers as take their rise\r\nin the mountains have very short courses, and the few that come from\r\nbeyond, finding channels through the mountain passes, are so obstructed\r\nby rapids and cataracts at the point of descent from the higher levels\r\nthat no boat can ascend them.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa presents to the foreigner from cooler climates no serious\r\ndanger as to health. The sun-heat would be trying were it not for the\r\ndryness of the atmosphere and the invariable coolness of the nights,\r\nwhich have the effect of a refreshing tonic. With due care in providing\r\nsufficient wraps for the occasional cold day in the dry season, and the\r\nmeans of comfortable sleep during the cool nights, there is nothing to\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe much-dreaded malarial fever has its habitat in the lowlands of both\r\nthe east and the west coast. Persons who are not immune to it can\r\nchoose their place of residence on the higher lands, or take refuge in\r\nquinine.\r\n\r\nThe dryness and purity of the air in many parts of South Africa—notably\r\nCeres, Kimberley, Beauport West and other places in the interior\r\nplateau—make it peculiarly suitable for persons suffering from any form\r\nof chest disease—always excepting tuberculosis, for which the sure\r\nremedy has not yet been discovered. But even the victims of that malady\r\nfind atmospheric and other conditions friendly to a prolongation of\r\nlife in the salubrious air and sunshine of the South African\r\ntablelands.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there can be no question as to the general good effect\r\nupon health of the South African climate. Europeans and Americans\r\nliving therein pursue their athletic sports with all the zest\r\nexperienced in their native climates, and the descendants of the\r\noriginal Dutch and Huguenot settlers—now in the sixth and seventh\r\ngenerations—have lost nothing of the stature nor of the physical energy\r\nthat characterized their forefathers.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa used to be the habitat of an unusually rich fauna. The\r\nlion, leopard, elephant, giraffe, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, antelope in\r\nthirty-one species, zebra, quagga, buffalo and various other wild\r\ncreatures—some of them savage, and all of them beautiful after their\r\nkind—abounded. But of late years all this has been changed. Since\r\nfirearms have been greatly improved and cheapened and the country has\r\nbeen opened to the Nimrods of the world and the swarming natives have\r\nprocured guns and learned to use them, the wild animals have been\r\nthinned out. There are now but two regions in South Africa where big\r\ngame can be killed in any great numbers—the Portuguese territory from\r\nthe Zambesi to Delagoa Bay, and the adjoining eastern frontier of the\r\nTransvaal.\r\n\r\nSnakes of various kinds and sizes, from the poisonous black mamba to\r\nthe python that grows to over twenty feet in length, used to infest\r\nmany parts of the country, but they have almost disappeared from the\r\ntemperate regions inhabited by the whites.\r\n\r\nThe farmers’ worst enemies are not now the great beasts and reptiles of\r\nformer years, but the baboons, which gather in the more rocky districts\r\nand kill the lambs, and two species of insects—the white ants and the\r\nlocusts—which sometimes ravage the eastern coast.\r\n\r\nBeyond that of most countries in the world of equal extent the flora of\r\nSouth Africa is rich in both genera and species. The neighborhood of\r\nCape Town and the warm, sub-tropical regions of eastern Cape Colony and\r\nNatal are specially affluent in beautiful flowers. In the Karoo\r\ndistrict, and northeastward over the plateau into Bechuanaland and the\r\nTransvaal, vegetation presents but little variety of aspect, owing in\r\npart to the general sameness of geological formations and in part to\r\nthe prevailing dryness of the surface.\r\n\r\nIn general, South Africa is comparatively bare of forests—a fact for\r\nwhich denudation by man cannot account, for it is yet a country new to\r\ncivilization. Some primitive forests are to be found on the south coast\r\nof Cape Colony and in Natal. These have been put under the care of a\r\nForest Department of the government. In the great Knysna forest wild\r\nelephants still roam at large. The trees, however, even in the\r\npreserved forests, are small, few of them being more than fifty or\r\nsixty feet in height. The yellowwood grows the tallest, but the less\r\nlofty sneezewood is the most useful to man. Up the hillsides north of\r\nGraham’s Town and King William’s Town are immense tracts of scrub from\r\nfour to eight feet high, with occasional patches of prickly pear—a\r\nformidable invader from America, through which both men and cattle make\r\ntheir passage at the cost of much effort and many irritating wounds\r\nfrom the sharp spines. A large part of this region, being suitable for\r\nlittle else, has been utilized for ostrich farming.\r\n\r\nIn the Karoo district and northward through Cape Colony, western\r\nBechuanaland and the German possessions in Namaqualand and Damaraland—a\r\ndesert region—there are few trees except small and thorny mimosas.\r\nFarther east, where there is a greater rainfall, the trees are more\r\nnumerous and less thorny. The plain around Kimberley, once well wooded,\r\nhas been stripped of its trees to furnish props for the diamond mines\r\nand fuel.\r\n\r\nThe lack of forests is one of the principal drawbacks to the\r\ndevelopment of South Africa. Timber is everywhere costly; the rainfall\r\nis less than it would be if the country were well wooded; and when\r\nrains do come the moisture is more rapidly dissipated by absorption,\r\nevaporation and sudden freshets because of the absence of shade. Of\r\nlate energetic measures have been taken to supply nature’s lack by\r\nartificial forestry. On the great veldt plateau in the vicinity of\r\nKimberley and of Pretoria and in other localities the people have\r\nplanted the Australian gum tree, the eucalyptus and several varieties\r\nof European trees, including the oak, which, besides being useful, is\r\nvery beautiful. If the practice be continued the country will reap an\r\nincalculable benefit, not only in appearance, but also in climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe largest political division of South Africa is Cape Colony. The area\r\nis about 292,000 square miles and the population, white and native, is\r\n2,011,305. The whites number about 400,000. But little of it is\r\nsuitable for agriculture, and considerable portions of it are too arid\r\nfor stock raising. Including the natives the population is only about\r\nseven to the square mile. On the lowlands skirting the sea on the south\r\nand west are some fruitful regions that give a profitable yield of\r\ngrapes and corn. On the tableland of the interior there is a rainfall\r\nof only from five to fifteen inches in the year. As a consequence the\r\nsurface is dry and unfriendly to vegetable life. In an area of three\r\nhundred miles by one hundred and fifty there is not a stream having a\r\ncurrent throughout the year, nor is there any moisture at all in the\r\ndry season except some shallow pools which are soon dried up by\r\nevaporation. Nevertheless, in this desert, bare of trees and of\r\nherbage, there is abundance of prickly shrubs, which are sufficiently\r\nsucculent when they sprout under the summer rains to afford good\r\nbrowsing for goats and sheep. In the northwestern part of the interior\r\nand northward to Kimberley and Mafeking, the country is better watered\r\nthan the more westerly regions, and grazing animals find a generous\r\ngrowth of grass as well as nutritious shrubs. In the southeastern part\r\nthe rainfall is still heavier. The foothills of the Quathlamba Range\r\ntoward the sea are covered in places with forests, the grass is more\r\nabundant and much of the land can be tilled to profit without\r\nartificial irrigation. In 1899 there were about 3,000 miles of railway\r\nand nearly 7,000 miles of telegraph open in the colony. The number of\r\nvessels entering the ports of Cape Colony in 1897 was 1,093, with a\r\ntotal tonnage of 2,694,370 tons; in addition to this there were 1,278\r\nvessels engaged in the coastwise trade, with a tonnage of 3,725,831\r\ntons. The foreign commerce of Cape Colony is large, including, as it\r\ndoes, the bulk of the import and export trade of all South Africa. The\r\ntotal importation of merchandise for 1897 was $80,127,495, and the\r\nexports, including a large proportion of the gold and diamond products\r\nof Kimberley and the Transvaal, amounted, in 1898, to $123,213,458.\r\n\r\nNatal, beyond any other part of South Africa, is favored by natural\r\nadvantages. It lies on the seaward slope of the Quathlamba Mountains,\r\nand its scenery is charmingly diversified by some of the lesser peaks\r\nand the foothills of that range. It is well watered by perennial\r\nstreams fed by the snows and springs of the mountains. While the higher\r\naltitudes to the west are bare, there is abundance of grass lower down\r\nand toward the coast there is plenty of wood. The climate in general is\r\nmuch warmer than that of Cape Colony; in the low strip bordering the\r\nsea it is almost tropical. This high temperature is not caused so much\r\nby latitude as by the current in the Mozambique Channel, which brings\r\nfrom the tropical regions of the Indian Ocean a vast stream of warm\r\nwater, which acts on the climate of Natal as does the Gulf Stream on\r\nthat of Georgia and the Carolinas. Nearly the whole of Natal may be\r\ncounted temperate; the soil is rich, the scenery is beautiful, and,\r\nwith the exception of certain malarious districts at the north, the\r\nclimate is healthful. Foreigners from Europe and America may reasonably\r\nhope to enjoy long life and prosperity in it. The principal crop for\r\nexport is sugar, but cereals of all kinds, coffee, indigo, arrowroot,\r\nginger, tobacco, rice, pepper, cotton and tea are grown to profit. The\r\ncoal fields of the colony are large, the output in 1897 being 244,000\r\ntons. There are 487 miles of railway, built and operated by the\r\ngovernment. The imports in 1897 amounted to nearly $30,000,000. Pop.\r\n828,500; whites, 61,000.\r\n\r\nThe Orange Free State, in its entire area of 48,000 square miles, is on\r\nthe great interior plateau at an altitude of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet\r\nabove the sea level. The surface is mostly level, but there are\r\noccasional hills—some of them rising to a height of 6,000 feet. The\r\nland is, for the most part, bare of trees, but affords good grazing for\r\ntwo-thirds of the year. The air is remarkably pure and bracing. There\r\nare no blizzards to encounter. There are, however, occasional violent\r\nthunderstorms, which precipitate enormous hailstones—large enough to\r\nkill the smaller animals, and even men. Notwithstanding the generally\r\nparched appearance of the country, the larger streams do not dry up in\r\nwinter. The southeastern part of the Free State, particularly the\r\nvalley of the Caledon River, is one of the best corn-growing regions in\r\nAfrica. In the main, however, with the exception of the river valleys,\r\nthe land is more suitable for pasture than for tillage. The grazing\r\nfarms are large and require the services of but few men; as a\r\nconsequence the population increases slowly. The Free State,\r\ncorresponding in size to the State of New York, has only about 80,000\r\nwhite inhabitants and 130,000 natives. The chief industry is\r\nagriculture and stock-raising. A railway, constructed by the Cape\r\nColony government, connects Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange\r\nFree State, with the ports of Cape Colony and Natal, and with Pretoria,\r\nthe capital of the South African Republic.\r\n\r\nThe South African Republic, commonly called the Transvaal, is 119,139\r\nsquare miles in area. The white population, numbering 345,397, is\r\nlargely concentrated in the Witwatersrand mining district. The native\r\ninhabitants number 748,759. All the Transvaal territory belongs to the\r\ninterior plateau, with the exception of a strip of lower land on the\r\neastern and northern borders. This lower section is malarious. It is\r\nthought, however, that drainage and cultivation will correct this, as\r\nthey have done in other fever districts. Like the Free State, the\r\nTransvaal is principally a grazing country. The few trees that exist in\r\nthe more sheltered parts are of little value, except those in the lower\r\nvalleys. The winters are severely cold, and the burning sun of summer\r\nsoon dries up the moisture and bakes the soil, causing the grass to be\r\nstunted and yellow during most of the year. Until about sixteen years\r\nago there was little in the surface appearance and known resources of\r\nthe Transvaal to attract settlers, and nothing to make it a desirable\r\npossession to any other people than its Africander inhabitants. In 1884\r\ndiscoveries of gold were made, the first of which that excited the\r\nworld being some rich auriferous veins on the Sterkfontein farm. In a\r\nlittle time it became known that probably the richest deposit of gold\r\nin the world was in the Witwatersrand district of the Transvaal. Later,\r\nin 1897, diamonds were discovered in the Transvaal, the first stone\r\nhaving been picked up at Reitfontein, near the Vaal River, in August of\r\nthat year. Since then the precious crystals have been found in the\r\nPretoria district, in Roodeplaats on the Pienaars River, at\r\nKameelfontein and at Buffelsduff. The output of gold in 1898 was\r\n$68,154,000, and of diamonds $212,812.01. The total output of gold\r\nsince it was first discovered amounts to over $300,000,000, with\r\n$3,500,000,000 “in sight,” as valued by experts. The commerce of the\r\nSouth African Republic, while necessarily great because of the large\r\nnumber of people employed by the mining industries, cannot be as\r\naccurately stated as that of states whose imports are all received\r\nthrough a given port or ports. Foreign goods reach it through several\r\nports in Cape Colony, Natal, Portuguese East Africa, and in smaller\r\nquantities from other ports on the coast. The total imports for 1897\r\nare estimated at $107,575,000.\r\n\r\nGriqualand West, a British possession bordering on Cape Colony on the\r\nsouth and on the Free State on the east, owes its chief importance to\r\nthe Kimberley diamond mines, near the western boundary of the Free\r\nState and 600 miles from Cape Town. These mines were opened in 1868 and\r\n1869. It is estimated that since that time $350,000,000 worth of\r\ndiamonds in the rough—worth double that sum after cutting—have been\r\ntaken out. This enormous production would have been greatly exceeded\r\nhad not the owners of the various mines in the group formed an\r\nagreement by which the annual output was limited to a small excess over\r\nthe annual demand in the world’s diamond markets. So plentiful is the\r\nsupply, and so inexpensive, comparatively, is the cost of mining that\r\nother diamond-producing works have almost entirely withdrawn from the\r\nindustry since the South African mines were opened. It has been\r\nestimated that ninety-eight per cent of the diamonds of commerce are\r\nnow supplied by these mines.\r\n\r\nThe British protectorate of Bechuanaland, lying to the north of Cape\r\nColony and Griqualand and to the west of the Transvaal, has an area of\r\nabout 213,000 square miles, with a population of 200,000—mostly\r\nnatives. A railway and telegraph line connect it with Cape Colony on\r\nthe south and Rhodesia on the north.\r\n\r\nRhodesia includes the territory formerly known as British South Africa\r\nand a large part of that known as British East Africa. The area is\r\nabout 750,000 square miles—equal to about one-fourth of the area of the\r\nUnited States of America, excluding Alaska. No exact statement of\r\npopulation can be made; estimates range from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000, of\r\nwhich only about 6,000 are whites. The entire territory is under the\r\nadministration of the British South African Company, organized and\r\nincorporated in 1889, subject to the British High Commissioner at Cape\r\nTown. Rhodesia lies chiefly within the tablelands of South Africa and\r\nhas large but yet undeveloped resources, including grazing and\r\nagricultural lands and important mining districts. Owing to the newness\r\nof the country to civilization no definite statement can be made\r\nrelative to its commerce. In all probability Rhodesia will open a field\r\nwherein enterprise along the lines favored by its natural resources and\r\nconditions will be richly rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.",
