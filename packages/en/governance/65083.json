Although it concerns most vitally the twenty millions of\r\nCaucasians and the eight millions of Negroes in eleven States of the\r\nSouth, still it is a national problem, because whatever affects one part\r\nof our national organism concerns the whole of it. Although this\r\nquestion has been considered from almost every conceivable standpoint,\r\nfew have turned to the laws of the States and of the Nation to see how\r\nthey bear upon it. It was with the hope of gaining new light on the\r\nsubject from this source that I undertook the present investigation.\r\n\r\nI have examined the Constitutions, statutes, and judicial decisions of\r\nthe United States and of the States and Territories between 1865 and the\r\npresent to find the laws that have made any distinctions between persons\r\non the basis of race. Reference has been made to some extent to laws in\r\nforce before 1865, but only as the background of later legislation and\r\ndecision. In order to make this study comparative as well as special,\r\nthe writer has abandoned his original plan of confining it to the\r\nSouthern States and laws applicable only to Negroes, and has extended it\r\nto include the whole United States and all the races.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Negro became a free man in 1865, the Federal\r\nGovernment undertook, by a series of constitutional amendments and\r\nstatutory enactments, to secure to him all the rights and privileges of\r\nan American citizen. My effort has been to ascertain how far this\r\nattempt has been successful. The inquiry has been: After forty-five\r\nyears of freedom from physical bondage, how much does the Negro lack of\r\nbeing, in truth, a full-fledged American citizen? What limitations upon\r\nhim are allowed or imposed by law because he is a Negro?\r\n\r\nThis is not meant, however, to be a legal treatise. Although the sources\r\nare, in the main, constitutions, statutes, and court reports, an effort\r\nhas been made to state the principles in an untechnical manner. Knowing\r\nthat copious citations are usually irksome to those who read for general\r\ninformation, I have relegated all notes to the ends of the chapters for\r\nthe benefit of the more curious reader who often finds them the most\r\nprofitable part of a book. There he will find citations of authorities\r\nfor practically every important statement made.\r\n\r\nAll the chapters, except the last two, were published serially in _The\r\nAmerican Law Review_/cite> during the year 1909. The substance of the\r\nchapter on “Separation of Races in Public Conveyances” was published\r\nalso in _The American Political Science Review_ for May, 1909.\r\n\r\nI wish that I could make public acknowledgment of my indebtedness to all\r\nwho have helped me in the preparation of this volume. Hundreds of public\r\nofficials in the South—mayors of cities, clerks of courts,\r\nattorneys-general, superintendents of public instruction, etc.—have\r\nresponded generously to my requests for information. I am thankful to\r\nMr. John H. Arnold, Librarian of the Harvard Law School, for access to\r\nthe stacks of that library, without which privilege my work would have\r\nbeen greatly delayed, and to his assistants for their uniform courtesy\r\nwhile I was making such constant demands upon them. I am under especial\r\nobligation to Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, of Harvard University, for\r\nhis direction and assistance in my examination of the sources and his\r\nvaluable advice while I have been preparing the material for publication\r\nin this form; also to Mr. Charles E. Grinnell, former Editor of _The\r\nAmerican Law Review_, for his encouragement and suggestions during the\r\npreparation of the articles for his magazine. Lastly, I would express my\r\ngratitude to Mr. Charles Vernon Imlay, of the New York Bar, the value of\r\nwhose painstaking help in the revision of the manuscript of this book is\r\ntruly inestimable.\r\n\r\n                                              GILBERT THOMAS STEPHENSON.\r\n\r\n WARREN PLACE, PENDLETON, N.

        INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n                   WHAT IS A RACE DISTINCTION IN LAW?\r\n\r\nA race distinction in the law is a requirement imposed by statute,\r\nconstitutional enactment, or judicial decision, prescribing for a person\r\nof one race a rule of conduct different from that prescribed for a\r\nperson of another race. If, for instance, a Negro is required to attend\r\none public school, a Mongolian another, and a Caucasian a still\r\ndifferent one, a race distinction is created, because the person must\r\nregulate his action accordingly as he belongs to one or another race.\r\nOr, if a person, upon entering a street car, is required by ordinance or\r\nstatute to take a seat in the front part of the car if he is a\r\nCaucasian, but in the rear if he is a Negro, this rule is a race\r\ndistinction recognized by law. Again, a race distinction is made by the\r\nlaw when intermarriage between Negroes and Caucasians is prohibited.\r\n\r\nDistinctions in law have been made on grounds other than race. Thus, in\r\nthose States in which men may vote by satisfying the prescribed\r\nrequirements, but in which women may not vote under any circumstances,\r\nthe law creates a distinction on the basis of sex. Laws forbidding\r\npersons under seven years of age from testifying in court and laws\r\nexempting from a poll tax persons under twenty-one years of age give\r\nrise to age distinctions. Other instances might be cited, but only race\r\ndistinctions have a place here.\r\n\r\n\r\n              DISTINCTIONS AND DISCRIMINATIONS CONTRASTED\r\n\r\nIt is important, at the outset, to distinguish clearly between race\r\n_distinctions_ and race _discriminations_; more so, because these\r\nwords are often used synonymously, especially when the Negro is\r\ndiscussed. A distinction between the Caucasian and the Negro, when\r\nrecognized and enforced by the law, has been interpreted as a\r\ndiscrimination against the latter. Negroes have recognized that they\r\nare the weaker of the two races numerically, except in the Black Belt\r\nof the South, and intellectually the less developed. Knowing that the\r\nvarious race distinctions have emanated almost entirely from white\r\nconstitution-makers, legislators, and judges, they regard these\r\ndistinctions as expressions of the aversion on the part of the\r\nCaucasian to association with the Negro. Naturally, therefore, they\r\nhave resented race distinctions upon the belief and, in many\r\ninstances, upon the experience that they are equivalent to race\r\ndiscriminations.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is an essential difference between race distinctions and\r\nrace discriminations. North Carolina, for example, has a law that white\r\nand Negro children shall not attend the same schools, but that separate\r\nschools shall be maintained. If the terms for all the public schools in\r\nthe State are equal in length, if the teaching force is equal in numbers\r\nand ability, if the school buildings are equal in convenience,\r\naccommodations, and appointments, a race distinction exists but not a\r\ndiscrimination. Identity of accommodation is not essential to avoid the\r\ncharge of discrimination. If there are in a particular school district\r\ntwice as many white children as there are Negro children, the school\r\nbuilding for the former should be twice as large as that for the latter.\r\nThe course of study need not be the same. If scientific investigation\r\nand experience show that in the education of the Negro child emphasis\r\nshould be placed on one course of study, and in the education of the\r\nwhite child, on another; it is not a discrimination to emphasize\r\nindustrial training in the Negro school, if that is better suited to the\r\nneeds of the Negro pupil, and classics in the white school if the latter\r\ncourse is more profitable to the white child. There is no discrimination\r\nso long as there is equality of opportunity, and this equality may often\r\nbe attained only by a difference in methods.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the term of the Negro school is four months, and\r\nthat of the white, eight; if the teachers in the Negro schools are\r\nunderpaid and inadequately or wrongly trained, and the teachers of the\r\nwhite schools are well paid and well trained; if Negro children are\r\nhoused in dilapidated, uncomfortable, and unsanitary buildings, and\r\nwhite children have new, comfortable, and sanitary buildings; if courses\r\nof study for Negro children are selected in a haphazard fashion without\r\nany regard to their peculiar needs, and a curriculum is carefully\r\nadapted to the needs of white children; if such conditions exist under\r\nthe law, race distinctions exist which are at the same time\r\ndiscriminations against Negroes. Where the tables are turned and Negro\r\nchildren are accorded better educational advantages than white, the\r\ndiscriminations are against Caucasians.\r\n\r\nA law of Virginia requires white and Negro passengers to occupy separate\r\ncoaches on railroad trains. If the coaches for both races are equally\r\nclean, equally comfortable, and equally well appointed; if both races\r\nare accorded equally courteous service by the employees of the railroad;\r\nif, in short, all the facilities for travel are equal for both races,\r\nrace distinctions exist but not race discriminations. The extent of\r\naccommodations need not be identical. The railroad company, for\r\ninstance, need furnish only the space requisite for the accommodation of\r\neach race. If, however, the white passengers are admitted to clean,\r\nwell-lighted, well-ventilated coaches and Negroes, to foul, unclean,\r\nuncomfortable coaches; if white coaches are well-policed, while Negro\r\npassengers are subjected to the insults of disorderly persons; if, in\r\nother words, the Negro passenger does not receive as good service for\r\nhis fare as the white, a discrimination against the Negro is made under\r\nthe guise of a legal distinction.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, one might consider each of the race distinctions\r\nrecognized in the law and show how it may be applied so as not to work a\r\ndiscrimination against either race and, as easily, how it may be used to\r\nwork an injustice to the weaker race. A race distinction connotes a\r\ndifference and nothing more. A discrimination necessarily implies\r\npartiality and favoritism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LEGAL AND ACTUAL DISTINCTIONS\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between actual race distinctions—those practiced\r\nevery day without the sanction of law—and legal race distinctions—those\r\neither sanctioned or required by statutes or ordinances. Law is\r\ncrystallized custom. Race distinctions now recognized by law were\r\nhabitually practiced long before they crystallized into statutes. Thus,\r\nactual separation of races on railroad coaches—if not in separate\r\ncoaches, certainly in separate seats or portions of the coach—obtained\r\nlong before the “Jim Crow” laws came into existence. Moreover,\r\nmiscegenation was punished before the legislature made it a crime. Some\r\nrace distinctions practiced to-day will probably be sanctioned by\r\nstatute in the future; others will persist as customs. In some Southern\r\ncities, for instance, there are steam laundries which will not accept\r\nNegro patronage. Everywhere in the South and in many places in other\r\nsections, there are separate churches for the races. It is practically a\r\nuniversal custom among the white people in the South never to address a\r\nNegro as “Mister” or “Mistress.” This custom obtains to some extent\r\nelsewhere. Thus, in a recent case before a justice of the peace in\r\nDelaware in which the parties were Negroes, one of them insisted upon\r\nspeaking of another Negro as “Mister.” The justice forbade him so to do,\r\nand, upon his persisting, fined him for contempt. Yet, these\r\ndistinctions and many others that might be cited are not required by\r\nlaw, and some of them, if expressed in statutes, would be\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nMost race distinctions, however, are still uncrystallized. But these\r\nwill be mentioned merely for illustration, since the purpose here is to\r\ndiscuss only those distinctions which have been expressed in\r\nconstitutions, statutes, and judicial decisions. Mr. Ray Stannard Baker\r\nin his “Following the Colour Line,”[1] has admirably depicted actual\r\nrace relations in the United States. He has gone in person out upon the\r\ncotton plantations of the Lower South; into the Negro districts of\r\ncities in the South, East, and North; into schools, churches, and court\r\nrooms; and has described how the Negro lives, what he does, what he\r\nthinks about himself and about the white man, and what the white man\r\nthinks about him. By studying the race distinctions he describes from\r\nthe other standpoint suggested—that is, by tracing their gradual\r\ncrystallization into statutes and judicial decisions, a better\r\nunderstanding may be had of race distinctions in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ALL RACE ELEMENTS INCLUDED\r\n\r\nAttention will be directed not only to the Negro but to other races in\r\nthe United States—the Mongolian in the Far West and the Indian in the\r\nSouthwest. Of course, by far the largest race element after the\r\nCaucasian is the Negro with its 8,833,994 people of whom eighty-four and\r\nseven-tenths per cent. are in the thirteen States of the South. But it\r\nwill be found that in those sections where the Indians have existed or\r\nstill exist in appreciable numbers and come into association with the\r\nCaucasian—that is, where they do not still maintain their tribal\r\nrelations—race distinctions have separated these two races. This is\r\nequally true of the Japanese and Chinese in the Pacific States. Most of\r\nthe discussion will necessarily be of the distinctions between\r\nCaucasians and Negroes, but as distinctions applicable to Mongolians and\r\nIndians arise, they will be mentioned to show that race consciousness is\r\nnot confined to any one section or race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PERIOD COVERED FROM 1865 TO PRESENT\r\n\r\nRace distinctions have existed and have been recognized in the law from\r\nthe beginning of the settlement of the New World, long before the\r\nthirteen colonies became free and independent States, or before the\r\nFederal Constitution was adopted. The first cargo of Negroes was landed\r\nin Virginia in 1619, only twelve years after the founding of Jamestown.\r\nIn 1630, eleven years later, the Virginia Assembly passed the following\r\nresolution:[2] “Hugh Davis to be soundly whipped before an assembly of\r\nNegroes and others, for abusing himself to the dishonor of God and the\r\nshame of Christians, by defiling his body in lying with a Negro.” Many\r\nof the Colonies—later States—prohibited intermarriage between Caucasians\r\nand Negroes whether the latter were slave or free. The Colonies and\r\nStates prohibited or limited the movements of free Negroes from one\r\ncolony or State to another, prescribed special punishment for adultery\r\nbetween white persons and Negroes, forbade persons of color to carry\r\nfirearms, and in divers other ways restricted the actions of Negroes.\r\n\r\nIt is not so profitable, however, at this day to study these early\r\ndistinctions, for the distinctions based on race were then inseparably\r\ninterwoven with those based on the state of slavery. Thus, it is\r\nimpossible to say whether a law was passed to regulate a person’s\r\nactions because he was a slave or because he was of the Negro race.\r\nMoreover, the laws relating to race and slave distinctions prior to 1858\r\nwere compiled by John Codman Hurd in his two-volume work entitled “The\r\nLaw of Freedom and Bondage in the United States,” published in 1858. Any\r\nattempt at a further treatment of the period covered by that work would\r\nresult only in a digest of a multitude of statutes, most of which have\r\nbeen obsolete for many years. But a greater reason for the futility of a\r\ndiscussion of race distinctions before 1865 is that prior to that date,\r\nas it has been so often expressed, the Negro was considered to have no\r\nrights which the white man was bound to respect. The Dred Scott\r\ndecision[3] in 1857 virtually held that a slave was not a citizen or\r\ncapable of becoming one, and this dictum, unnecessary to the decision of\r\nthe case, did much, says James Bryce,[4] “to precipitate the Civil War.”\r\nIf the Negro could enjoy only licenses, claiming nothing as of right, it\r\nis not very valuable to study the distinctions which the master imposed\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nThe year 1865 marked the beginning of the present era in race relations.\r\nIt was in that year that the Negro became a free man, and that the\r\nFederal Government undertook by successive legislative enactments to\r\nsecure and guarantee to him all the rights and privileges which the\r\nCaucasian race had so long enjoyed as its inalienable heritage.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation of 1862, issued as a military expedient,\r\ndeclared that, unless the seceding States were back in the Union by\r\nJanuary 1, 1863, all slaves in those States should be emancipated. This\r\ndid not apply to the Union States, as Delaware, which still had slaves.\r\nBut immediately upon the cessation of hostilities, Congress set to work\r\nto make emancipation general throughout the Union and to give the Negro\r\nall the rights of a citizen. The Thirteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, ratified December 18, 1865, abolished slavery and\r\ninvoluntary servitude except as a punishment for crime. The following\r\nApril, the first Civil Rights Bill[5] was passed, which declared that\r\n“all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign\r\npower, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens\r\nof the United States; and such citizens, of every race and color,\r\nwithout regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude, except as a punishment for crime ... shall have the same\r\nright, in every State and Territory in the United States, to make and\r\nenforce contracts, to sue, ... and to full and equal benefit of all laws\r\nand proceedings in the security of persons and property, as is enjoyed\r\nby white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishments and\r\npenalties, and to none other....”\r\n\r\nThese rights were enlarged by the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in\r\n1868, which provides that: “All persons born or naturalized in the\r\nUnited States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of\r\nthe United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall\r\nmake or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive\r\nany person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor\r\ndeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\r\nlaws.” Though the word “Negro” is not mentioned in this Amendment nor in\r\nany of the subsequent Federal enactments, it is not open to dispute that\r\nthe legislators had in mind primarily the protection of the Negro.\r\n\r\nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 was\r\nreënacted[6] in 1870, with the addition that it extended to all persons\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States, and that it provided that\r\nall persons should be subject to like taxes, licenses, and exactions of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified, which\r\ndeclared that the right of citizens of the United States to vote should\r\nnot be denied or abridged by the United States or by any States on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Bill[7] of 1875, the most sweeping of all such\r\nlegislation by Congress, declared that all persons within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States should be entitled to the full and\r\nequal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and\r\nprivileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, theatres, and\r\nother places of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and\r\nlimitations established by law, and applicable alike to citizens of\r\nevery race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude.\r\nIt also provided that jurors should not be excluded on account of race,\r\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of these Federal statutes and constitutional amendments\r\nhas been made in order to show the efforts of Congress to secure to the\r\nNegro every civil and political right of a full-fledged citizen of the\r\nUnited States. Later they will be discussed in detail. By the Civil\r\nRights Bill of 1875, Congress apparently intended to secure not only\r\nequal but identical accommodations in all public places for Negroes and\r\nCaucasians. If one looks only upon the surface of these several\r\nlegislative enactments, it would seem impossible to have a race\r\ndistinction recognized by law which did not violate some Federal statute\r\nor the Federal Constitution. But the succeeding pages will show that,\r\nunder the shadow of the statutes and the Constitution, the legislatures\r\nand courts of the States have built up a mass of race distinctions which\r\nthe Federal courts and Congress, even if so inclined, are impotent to\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Doubleday, Page & Co., 1908.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  1 Hen. 146, quoted in Hurd’s “Law of Freedom and Bondage,” I, p. 229.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  19 How. 393 (1857).\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  “American Commonwealth,” I, p. 257.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  14 Stat.

If a statute\r\nprovides that Negroes shall ride in separate coaches and attend separate\r\nschools, it is necessary to decide first who are included under the term\r\n“Negroes.” It would seem that physical indicia would be sufficient, and,\r\nin most instances, this is true. It is never difficult to distinguish\r\nthe full-blooded Negro, Indian, or Mongolian one from the other or from\r\nthe Caucasian. But the difficulty arises in the blurring of the color\r\nline by amalgamation. The amount of miscegenation between the Mongolian\r\nand other races represented in the United States is negligible; but the\r\nextent of intermixture between the Caucasian and the Negro, the Negro\r\nand the Indian, and the Caucasian and the Indian is appreciable, and\r\nproblems arising from it are serious.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely impossible to ascertain the number of mulattoes—that\r\nis, persons having both Caucasian and Negro blood in their veins—in the\r\nUnited States. Mr. Baker[9] says: “I saw plenty of men and women who\r\nwere unquestionably Negroes, Negroes in every physical characteristic,\r\nblack of countenance with thick lips and kinky hair, but I also met men\r\nand women as white as I am, whose assertions that they were really\r\nNegroes I accepted in defiance of the evidence of my own senses. I have\r\nseen blue-eyed Negroes and golden-haired Negroes; one Negro girl I met\r\nhad an abundance of soft, straight, red hair. I have seen Negroes I\r\ncould not easily distinguish from the Jewish or French types; I once\r\ntalked with a man I took at first to be a Chinaman but who told me he\r\nwas a Negro. And I have met several people, passing everywhere for\r\nwhite, who, I knew, had Negro blood.”\r\n\r\nA separate enumeration of mulattoes has been made four times—in 1850,\r\n1860, 1870, and 1890 respectively. The census authorities themselves\r\nsaid that the figures were of little value, and any attempt to\r\ndistinguish Negroes from mulattoes was abandoned in the census of 1900.\r\nIf a person is apparently white, the census enumerator will feel a\r\ndelicacy in asking him if he has Negro blood in his veins. If the\r\nenumerator does ask the question and if the other is honest in his\r\nanswer, it is often that the latter does not know his own ancestry. Dr.\r\nBooker T. Washington, for instance, has said that he does not know who\r\nhis father was.[10] Marital relations among Negroes during slavery were\r\nso irregular, and illicit intercourse between white men and slave women\r\nwas so common that the line of ancestry of many mulattoes is hopelessly\r\nlost. But Mr. Baker makes the rough estimate, which doubtless is\r\nsubstantially correct, that 3,000,000 of the 10,000,000 (_circa_)\r\nNegroes are visibly mulattoes. This one third of the total Negro\r\npopulation represents every degree of blood, of color, and of physical\r\ndemarcation from the fair complexion, light hair, blue eyes, thin lips,\r\nand sharp nose of the octoroon, who betrays scarcely a trace of his\r\nNegro blood, to the coal-black skin, kinky hair, brown eyes, thick lips,\r\nand flat nose of the man who has scarcely a trace of Caucasian blood. It\r\nis this gradual sloping off from one race into another which has made it\r\nnecessary for the law to set artificial lines.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty arising from the intermixture of the races was realized\r\nwhile the Negro was still a slave. Throughout the statutes prior to\r\n1860, one finds references to “persons of color,” a generic phrase\r\nincluding all who were not wholly Caucasian or Indian. This antebellum\r\nnomenclature has been brought over into modern statutes. It is\r\nsurprising to find how seldom the word “Negro” is used in the statutes\r\nand judicial decisions.\r\n\r\nSome States have fixed arbitrary definitions of “persons of color,”\r\n“Negroes,” and “mulattoes”; others, having enacted race distinctions,\r\nhave then defined whom they intended to include in each race. This has\r\nbeen done particularly in the laws prohibiting intermarriage. The\r\nConstitution of Oklahoma[11] provides that “wherever in this\r\nConstitution and laws of this State, the word or words, ‘colored,’ or\r\n‘colored race,’ or ‘Negro,’ or ‘Negro race,’ are used, the same shall be\r\nconstrued to mean, or apply to all persons of African descent. The term\r\n‘white’ shall include all other persons.”\r\n\r\nTaking up these definitions in the various States—many of them included\r\nwithin broader statutes—one finds that Alabama,[12] Kentucky,[13]\r\nMaryland,[14] Mississippi,[15] North Carolina,[16] Tennessee,[17] and\r\nTexas[18] define as a person of color one who is descended from a Negro\r\nto the third generation inclusive, though one ancestor in each\r\ngeneration may have been white. The Code Committee of Alabama of 1903\r\nsubstituted “fifth” for “third,” so that at present in that State one is\r\na person of color who has had any Negro blood in his ancestry in five\r\ngenerations.[19] The laws of Florida,[20] Georgia,[21] Indiana,[22]\r\nMissouri,[23] and South Carolina[24] declare that one is a person of\r\ncolor who has as much as one-eighth Negro blood: the laws of\r\nNebraska[25] and Oregon[26] say that one must have as much as one-fourth\r\nNegro blood in order to be classed with that race. Virginia[27] and\r\nMichigan apparently draw the line in a similar way. In Virginia, a\r\nmarriage between a white man and a woman who is of less than one-fourth\r\nNegro blood, “if it be but one drop less,” is legal. A woman whose\r\nfather was white, and whose mother’s father was white, and whose\r\ngreat-grandmother was of a brown complexion, is not a Negro in the sense\r\nof the statute.[28] In 1866, the court of Michigan, under a law limiting\r\nthe suffrage to “white male citizens,” held that all persons should be\r\nconsidered white who had less than one-fourth of African blood.[29] That\r\nState gave the right to vote also to male inhabitants of Indian descent,\r\nbut its court held that a person having one-eighth Indian blood,\r\none-fourth or three-eighths African, and the rest white was not included\r\nin that class.[30] Ohio limited the suffrage to white male citizens and\r\nmade it the duty of judges of election to challenge any one with a\r\n“distinct and visible admixture of African blood,” but the latter\r\nrequirement was held unconstitutional in 1867,[31] the court saying\r\nthat, where the white blood in a person predominated, he was to be\r\nconsidered white. This definition is interesting because it is the only\r\ninstance found of a court’s saying that a person with more than half\r\nwhite blood and the rest Negro should be considered white. In contrast\r\nwith this is the following sweeping definition laid down in the\r\nTennessee statute: “All Negroes, Mulattoes, Mestizoes,[32] and their\r\ndescendants, having any African blood in their veins, shall be known in\r\nthis State as ‘Persons of Color.’”[33] Arkansas also, in its statute\r\nseparating the races in trains, includes among persons of color all who\r\nhave “a visible and distinct admixture of African blood.”[34]\r\n\r\nIn everyday language, a mulatto is any person having both Caucasian and\r\nNegro blood. But several States have defined “mulatto” specifically. The\r\nSupreme Court of Alabama[35] held, in 1850, that a mulatto is the\r\noffspring of a Negro and a white person, that the offspring of a white\r\nperson and a mulatto is not a mulatto; but this definition was enlarged\r\nin 1867[36] to include anyone descended from Negro ancestors to the\r\nthird generation inclusive, though one ancestor in each generation be\r\nwhite. It has been seen already that this was recently extended to the\r\nfifth generation. The law of Missouri[37] defines a mulatto thus: “Every\r\nperson other than a Negro, any one of whose grandfathers or grandmothers\r\nis or shall have been a Negro, although his or her other progenitors,\r\nexcept those descending from the Negro, may have been white persons,\r\nshall be deemed a mulatto, and every such person who shall have\r\none-fourth or more Negro blood shall in like manner be deemed a\r\nmulatto.”\r\n\r\nSome States have allowed facts other than physical characteristics to be\r\npresumptive of race. Thus, it has been held in North Carolina[38] that,\r\nif one was a slave in 1865, it is to be presumed that he was a Negro.\r\nThe fact that one usually associates with Negroes has been held in the\r\nsame State proper evidence to go to the jury tending to show that he is\r\na Negro.[39] If a woman’s first husband was a white man, that fact, in\r\nTexas,[40] is admissible evidence tending to show that she is a white\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nOne may ascertain how some of the States define the other races from\r\ntheir laws against miscegenation. Thus, Mississippi, in prohibiting\r\nintermarriage between Caucasians and Mongolians, includes one having as\r\nmuch as one-eighth Mongolian blood. Oregon makes its similar law\r\napplicable to those having one-fourth or more Chinese or Kanakan[41]\r\nblood, or more than one-half Indian blood. Thus, three-eighths of Indian\r\nblood would not be sufficient to bar a man from intermarriage with a\r\nCaucasian, but one-fourth Negro, Chinese, or Kanakan blood would.\r\n\r\nThe above are the laws which define the races. The interpretation of\r\nthem is a different question. Some statutes say that one is a person of\r\ncolor—in effect, a Negro—if he is descended from a Negro to the third\r\ngeneration inclusive, though one ancestor in each generation may have\r\nbeen white; others define as a person of color a man who has as much as\r\none-eighth Negro blood; and still others, one who has as much as\r\none-fourth Negro blood.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram will probably clarify these definitions:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          G.G.F.

The first generation above him is that of his parents, M and\r\nN. If either of them is white and the other a Negro, X has one-half\r\nNegro blood and would be considered a Negro everywhere. The second\r\ngeneration is that of his grandparents, I, J, K, and L. If any one of\r\nthem is a Negro and the other three white, X has one-fourth Negro blood,\r\nand would be considered a Negro in every State except possibly Ohio. The\r\nthird generation is that of his great-grandparents, A, B, C, D, E, F, G,\r\nand H. If any one of these eight great-grandparents is a Negro, X has\r\none-eighth Negro blood and would be considered a Negro in every State\r\nwhich defines a person of color as one who has one-eighth Negro blood or\r\nis descended from a Negro to the third generation inclusive. Suppose,\r\nfor instance, the great-grandfather A was a Negro and all the rest of\r\nthe great-grandparents were white. The grandfather I would be half\r\nNegro; the father M would be one-fourth Negro; and X would be one-eighth\r\nNegro. Thus, though of the fourteen progenitors of X only three had\r\nNegro blood, X would nevertheless be considered a Negro.\r\n\r\nIn the above illustrations only one of the progenitors has been a Negro\r\nand his blood has been the only Negro blood introduced into the line.\r\nSuppose, however, that there is Negro blood in both branches of the\r\nfamily, as where a mulatto marries a mulatto or a mulatto marries a\r\nNegro. One with a mathematical turn of mind may take these three\r\ngenerations and work out the various other combinations which would give\r\nX one-half, one-fourth, one-eighth, or any other fraction of Negro\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that in practice one is a Negro or is classed with\r\nthat race if he has the least visible trace of Negro blood in his veins,\r\nor even if it is known that there was Negro blood in any one of his\r\nprogenitors. Miscegenation has never been a bridge upon which one might\r\ncross from the Negro race to the Caucasian, though it has been a\r\nthoroughfare from the Caucasian to the Negro. Judges and legislators\r\nhave gone the length of saying that one drop of Negro blood makes a man\r\na Negro, but to be a Caucasian one must be all Caucasian. This shows\r\nvery clearly that they have not considered Negro blood on a par with\r\nCaucasian; else, race affiliation would be determined by predominance of\r\nblood. By the latter test, if one had more Negro blood than white, he\r\nwould be considered a Negro; if more white than Negro, a Caucasian.\r\nTherefore, at the very threshold of this subject, even in the\r\ndefinitions of terms, one discovers a race distinction. Whether it is a\r\ndiscrimination depends upon what one considers the relative desirability\r\nof Caucasian and Negro ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PROPER NAME FOR BLACK MEN IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nHaving considered how the law defines that heterogeneous group of people\r\ncalled Negroes, one is brought face to face with the question: What, in\r\nactual practice, is the proper name for the black man in America? Is it\r\n“Negro?” Is it “colored person?” Is it “Afro-American?” If not one of\r\nthese, what is it? Among the members of that group, the matter of\r\nnomenclature is of more than academic interest. Thus, Rev. J. W. E.\r\nBowen, Professor of Historical Theology at Gamman Seminary, Atlanta, and\r\neditor of _The Voice of the Negro_, in 1906, published an article in\r\nthat paper with the pertinent title, “Who are We?”\r\n\r\nThe ways of speaking of members of the Negro race are various. In the\r\nlaws, as has been shown, they are called “Negroes,” “Persons of Color,”\r\n“Colored Persons,” “Africans,” and “Persons of African Descent”—more\r\noften “Persons of Color.” By those who would speak dispassionately and\r\nscientifically they are called Negroes and Afro-Americans. Those who are\r\nanxious not to wound the feelings of that race speak of them as “Colored\r\nPeople” or “Darkies”; while those who would speak contemptuously of them\r\nsay “Nigger” or “Coon.” “Nigger” is confined largely to the South;\r\n“Coon,” to the rest of the country. Again, one occasionally finds\r\n“Blacks” and “Black Men” in contradistinction to “Whites” and “White\r\nMen.”\r\n\r\nThe question of the proper name for persons of African descent was\r\nbrought into prominence in 1906. In that year a bill was laid before\r\nCongress relative to the schools of the City of Washington, which\r\nprovided that the Board of Education should consist of nine persons,\r\nthree of whom should be “of the colored race.” Representative Thetus W.\r\nSims, of Tennessee, objected to the phrase on the ground that it would\r\ninclude “Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Malays, Sandwich Islanders, or any\r\npersons of the colored race,” and insisted that “Negroes” or “persons of\r\nthe Negro race” should be substituted in its place. He wrote to Dr.\r\nBooker T. Washington, as one of the leaders of the Negro race, asking\r\nhis views as to the proper word. The following is part of his reply:\r\n“... It has been my custom to write and speak of the members of my race\r\nas Negroes, and when using the term ‘Negro’ as a race designation to\r\nemploy the capital ‘N.’ To the majority of the people among whom we live\r\nI believe this is customary and what is termed in the rhetorics ‘good\r\nusage.’... Rightly or wrongly, all classes have called us Negroes. We\r\ncannot escape that if we would. To cast it off would be to separate us,\r\nto a certain extent, from our history, and deprive us of much of the\r\ninspiration we now have to struggle on and upward. It is to our credit,\r\nnot to our shame, that we have risen so rapidly, more rapidly than most\r\nother peoples, from savage ancestors through slavery to civilization.\r\nFor my part, I believe the memory of these facts should be preserved in\r\nour name and traditions as it is preserved in the color of our faces. I\r\ndo not think my people should be ashamed of their history, nor of any\r\nname that people choose in good faith to give them.”[42]\r\n\r\nRepresentative Sims’s objection to the phrase “of the colored race”\r\nprecipitated a discussion throughout the country. The New York\r\n_Tribune_[43] made a canvass of a great many prominent Negroes and white\r\npersons to ascertain what they thought the Negro should be called. The\r\nresult of its inquiry is this: An average of eleven Negroes out of\r\ntwenty desired to be spoken of as Negroes. The other nine spurned the\r\nword as “insulting,” “contemptuous,” “degrading,” “vulgar.” Two argued\r\nfor “Afro-American,” two for “Negro-American,” one for “black man,” and\r\none was indifferent so long as he was not called “Nigger.” Of the white\r\nmen interviewed, ten out of thirteen, on an average, preferred the word\r\n“Negro.” The Negroes made a specially strong plea for capitalizing the\r\nword “Negro,” saying that it was not fair to accord that distinction to\r\ntheir dwarfish cousins, the Negritos in the Philippines, and to the many\r\nsavage tribes in Africa and deny it to the black man in America. They\r\nwere also strongly opposed to the word “Negress” as applied to the women\r\nof their race. This, they asserted, is objectionable because of its\r\nhistorical significance. For in times of slavery, “Negress” was the term\r\napplied to a woman slave at an auction, in contradistinction to “buck,”\r\nwhich referred to a male slave.\r\n\r\nE. A. Johnson, Professor of Law in Shaw University, North Carolina,\r\nsaid: “The term ‘Afro-American’ is suggestive of an attempt to disclaim\r\nas far as possible our Negro descent, and casts a slur upon it. It\r\nfosters the idea of the inferiority of the race, which is an incorrect\r\nnotion to instill into the Negro youth, whom we are trying to imbue with\r\nself-esteem and self-respect.”\r\n\r\nRev. J. W. E. Bowen, to whom reference has already been made, said: “Let\r\nthe Negroes, instead of bemourning their lot and fretting because they\r\nare Negroes and trying to escape themselves, rise up and wipe away the\r\nstain from this word by glorious and resplendent achievements. Good\r\nnames are not given; they are made.”\r\n\r\nRev. H. H. Proctor, pastor of the First Congregational Church, Atlanta,\r\nsaid: “What is needed is not to change the name of the people, but the\r\npeople of the name. Make the term so honorable that men will consider it\r\nan honor to be called a Negro.”\r\n\r\nRev. Walter H. Brooks, pastor of the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church,\r\nWashington, wrote: “The black people of America have but to augment\r\ntheir efforts in lives of self-elevation and culture, and men will cease\r\nto reproach us by any name whatever.”\r\n\r\nFinally, Charles W. Anderson, Collector of Internal Revenue, New York,\r\nsaid: “I am, therefore, inclined to favor the use of ‘Negro,’ partly\r\nbecause to drop it would expose me to the charge of being ashamed of my\r\nrace (and I hate any man who is ashamed of the race from which he\r\nsprung), and partly because I know that no name or term can confer or\r\nwithhold relative rank in this life. All races and men must win equality\r\nof rating and status for themselves.”\r\n\r\nOne is safe in concluding that the word “Negro” (with the capital “N”)\r\nwill eventually be applied to the black man in America. White people are\r\ndistinctly in favor of it: what Negroes now object to it do so because\r\nof its corrupt form, “Nigger.” As the Negro shows his ability to develop\r\ninto a respectable and useful citizen, contemptuous epithets will be\r\ndropped by all save the thoughtless and vicious, and “Negro” will be\r\nrecognized as the race name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  “Following the Colour Line,” p. 151.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, p. 151.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  “Up From Slavery,” p. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Art.

The speaking of such words is\r\nsaid to be actionable _per se_. In short, all the world knows that it is\r\ninjurious to a man to speak such words of him, and the court does not\r\nrequire proof of facts which all the world knows. Such words are (1)\r\nthose imputing an infamous crime; (2) those disparaging to a person in\r\nhis trade, business, office, or profession; and (3) those imputing a\r\nloathsome disease. Thus, to say that a man is a murderer is to impute to\r\nhim an infamous crime, and if he brings a suit for slander, it is not\r\nnecessary for him to prove that he has been damaged by the statement.\r\nThe result is the same if one says that a person will not pay his debts,\r\nbecause that injures him in his profession or business; or that a man\r\nhas the leprosy, because that is imputing to him a loathsome disease.\r\n\r\nFrom early times, it has been held to be slander, actionable _per se_,\r\nto say of a white man that he is a Negro or akin to a Negro. The courts\r\nhave placed this under the second class—that is, words disparaging to a\r\nperson in his trade, business, or profession. The first case in point\r\narose in South Carolina[44] in 1791, when the courts held that, if the\r\nwords were true, the party (the white person) would be deprived of all\r\ncivil rights, and moreover, would be liable to be tried in all cases,\r\nunder the “Negro Act,” without the privilege of a trial by jury, and\r\nthat “any words, therefore, which tended to subject a citizen to such\r\ndisabilities, were actionable.” In 1818, it was held actionable by a\r\ncourt of the same State to call a white man’s wife a mulatto.[45] But an\r\nOhio[46] court, the same year, held that it was not slander, actionable\r\n_per se_, to charge a white man with being akin to a Negro inasmuch as\r\nit did not charge any crime or exclude one from society. The only\r\nexplanation, apparently, of this conflict between the decisions of South\r\nCarolina and Ohio is that in the latter State it was not considered as\r\nmuch an insult to impute Negro blood to a white man as in the former. In\r\nNorth Carolina,[47] in 1860, there was the surprising decision that it\r\nwas not actionable _per se_ to call a white man a free Negro, even\r\nthough the white man was a minister of the gospel.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Louisiana,[48] in 1888, said: “Under the social\r\nhabits, customs, and prejudices prevailing in Louisiana, it cannot be\r\ndisputed that charging a white man with being a Negro is calculated to\r\ninflict injury and damage.... No one could make such a charge, knowing\r\nit to be false, without understanding that its effect would be injurious\r\nand without intending to injure.”\r\n\r\nIn 1900, a Reverend Mr. Upton delivered a temperance address near New\r\nOrleans. The reporters, desiring to be complimentary, referred to him as\r\na “cultured gentleman.” In the transmission of the dispatch by wire to\r\nthe New Orleans paper, the phrase was, by mistake, changed to “colored\r\ngentleman.” The _Times-Democrat_ of that city, unwilling to refer to a\r\nmember of the Negro race as a “colored gentleman,” changed it to\r\n“Negro,” and that was the word finally printed in the report. As soon as\r\nhe learned of the mistake, the editor of the paper duly retracted and\r\napologized. But Mr. Upton, not appeased, brought a suit for libel and\r\nrecovered fifty dollars damages.[49]\r\n\r\nThe _News and Courier_, of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1905, in\r\nreporting a suit by A. M. Flood against a street car company, referred\r\nto Mr. Flood as “colored.” The latter brought suit against the newspaper\r\nand recovered damages. In the course of its opinion, the court said:\r\n“When we think of the radical distinction subsisting between the white\r\nman and the black man, it must be apparent that to impute the condition\r\nof the Negro to a white man would affect his [the white man’s] social\r\nstatus, and, in case anyone publish a white man to be a Negro, it would\r\nnot only be galling to his pride, but would tend to interfere seriously\r\nwith the social relation of the white man with his fellow white men;\r\nand, to protect the white man from such a publication, it is necessary\r\nto bring such charge to an issue quickly.”[50] The court adds that its\r\ndecision does not violate the Amendments to the Federal Constitution,\r\nfor these do not refer to the social condition of the two races, but\r\nserve rather to give the two races equal civil and political rights.\r\nFinally, the court says, quoting People v. Gallagher: “... if one race\r\nbe inferior to the other socially, the Constitution of the United States\r\ncannot put them on the same plane.”[51]\r\n\r\nWhere laws separating the races in railroad trains and street cars are\r\nin force, and the duty devolves upon the conductors to assign passengers\r\nof the two races to their respective coaches or compartments, it is\r\nsurprising that they do not more often make the mistakes of assigning\r\nbright mulattoes to the white coach and dark-skinned white persons to\r\nthe colored. There are several instances where the latter mistake has\r\nbeen made. One would not expect a mulatto to resent being assigned to\r\nthe white coach and nothing would come of it, unless some white\r\npassenger recognized him as being a Negro and objected; but one would\r\nexpect a white person to resent being assigned to the “Jim Crow”\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\nIn Atlanta, in 1904, a certain Mr. Wolfe and his sister boarded a street\r\ncar and took seats in the part of the car reserved for white passengers.\r\nThe conductor asked them to move back, and when they asked the reason,\r\nhe answered that the rear of the car was for colored passengers. The\r\nlady asked if he thought they were colored, to which he replied:\r\n“Haven’t I seen you in colored company?” Mr. Wolfe demanded an apology,\r\nand later brought suit against the company. The court held that the\r\nstreet car company was liable, and that the good faith of the conductor\r\nin honestly thinking that they were Negroes would serve only in\r\nmitigation of damages. Two judges were of opinion that the company would\r\nnot be liable if the conductor used “extreme care and caution” to\r\nascertain the race of the passengers. The court held that it would take\r\njudicial notice of the social status of the two races and of their\r\nrespective superiority and inferiority, saying: “The question has never\r\nheretofore been directly raised in this State as to whether it is an\r\ninsult to seriously call a white man a Negro or to intimate that a\r\nperson apparently white is of African descent. We have no hesitation,\r\nhowever, after the most mature consideration of every phase of the\r\nquestion, in declaring our deliberate judgment to be that the wilful\r\nassertion or intimation embodied in the declaration now before us\r\nconstitutes an actionable wrong. We cannot shut our eyes to the facts of\r\nwhich courts are bound to take judicial notice. Certainly every court is\r\npresumed to know the habits of the people among which it is held, and\r\ntheir characteristics, as well as to know leading historical events and\r\nthe law of the land. To recognize inequality as to the civil or\r\npolitical rights belonging to any citizen or class of citizens, or to\r\nattempt to fix the social status of any citizen either by legislation or\r\njudicial decision, is repugnant to every principle underlying our\r\nrepublican form of government. Nothing is further from our purpose.\r\nUnder our institutions ‘every man is the architect of his own fortune.’\r\nEvery citizen, white and black, may gain, in every field of endeavor,\r\nthe recognition his associates may award. That is his right, and his own\r\nconcern. But the courts can take notice of the architecture without\r\nintermeddling with the building of the structure. It is a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that, viewed from a social standpoint, the Negro race\r\nis in mind and morals inferior to the Caucasian. The record of each from\r\nthe dawn of historic times denies equality. The fact was recognized by\r\ntwo of the leaders on opposite sides of the question of slavery, Abraham\r\nLincoln and A. H. Stephens.”[52]\r\n\r\nThe following is a recent case arising in Kentucky, in which it was held\r\nthat it is not slander _per se_ to call a white person a Negro: A white\r\nwoman entered a coach set apart for white people. The passengers therein\r\ncomplained that she was a Negro, and the brakeman, on hearing their\r\nremarks, asked her to go into the next coach. When, upon reaching the\r\nother coach, she found that it was set apart for Negroes, she left the\r\ntrain, which had not yet started from the station. She met the\r\nconductor, who, upon hearing her explanation, permitted her to go her\r\njourney in the white coach. Later, she brought suit against the railroad\r\ncompany and recovered a judgment for four thousand dollars. Upon appeal,\r\nthe judgment of the lower court was reversed, the higher court saying:\r\n“What race a person belongs to cannot always be determined infallibly\r\nfrom appearances, and mistake must inevitably be made. When a mistake is\r\nmade, the carrier is not liable in damages simply because a white person\r\nwas taken for a Negro, or _vice versa_. It is not a legal injury for a\r\nwhite person to be taken for a Negro. It was not contemplated by the\r\nstatute that the carrier should be an insurer as to the race of its\r\npassengers. The carrier is bound to exercise ordinary care in the\r\nmatter, but if it exercises ordinary care, and is not insulting to the\r\npassenger, it is not liable for damages.”[53]\r\n\r\nProbably the most recent case on the subject is one which arose about\r\ntwo years ago in Virginia. A certain Mrs. Stone boarded a train at\r\nMyrtle, Virginia. In spite of her protests, the conductor compelled her\r\nto go into the “Jim Crow” coach, thinking that she was a Negro. After\r\nshe had entered the car, a Negro passenger recognized her and said,\r\n“Lor’, Miss Rosa, this ain’t no place for you; you b’long in the cars\r\nback yonder.” Mrs. Stone rode on to Suffolk, the next station, and left\r\nthe train. She sued the railroad company for one thousand dollars\r\ndamages. It appeared that Mrs. Stone was much tanned: this probably\r\ncaused the conductor to mistake her for a Negro.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that all the courts which have held it\r\nactionable _per se_ to call a white person a Negro have been in the\r\nSouthern States. It is doubtful whether the courts in other sections\r\nwould take the same view, and even Kentucky, a Southern State, has\r\nrefused so to do. The attitude of the court depends upon whether it is\r\nthe consensus of opinion among the people of the community that it is\r\ninjurious to a white man in his business and social relations to be\r\ncalled a Negro.\r\n\r\nThe above is clearly another race distinction. Although there are many\r\ndecisions to the effect that it is actionable _per se_ to call a white\r\nperson a Negro, not one can be found deciding whether it would be so to\r\ncall a Negro a white person. One event looks, in a measure, in this\r\ndirection. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, in 1906, contracted\r\nwith a printer to have a new city directory issued. The time-honored\r\ncustom of the place was to distinguish white and Negro citizens by means\r\nof an asterisk placed before the names of all Negroes. After the\r\ndirectory had been distributed, it was found that asterisks had been\r\nplaced before the names of two highly respected white citizens, thus\r\nindicating that they were of Negro lineage. From what has been seen,\r\nthere is no doubt that this would found an action for libel. The\r\nnewspaper report says: “On the heels of this suit brought by Mr.\r\nLancaster [one of the white persons], it is said that Henry Pearson is\r\nseriously considering bringing suit against the same people because an\r\n_asterisk was not_[54] placed before his name. Henry is a Negro. In fact\r\nhe is one of the best-known Negroes in Asheville. He is at present\r\nproprietor of the Royal Victoria, a Negro hotel, and complains that he\r\nhas been the object of many unpleasant jests since the publication of\r\nthe directory, and likewise inquiries as to just ‘when he turned white.’\r\nPearson fears that if the report goes abroad that he is a white man it\r\nwill damage his hotel, and that the Negroes who make his place\r\nheadquarters and who pay into Henry’s hands many shekels will cease to\r\npatronize his hotel, and that his losses will be grievous.”[55] This\r\ncase is unique; whether it has been brought to court is as yet unknown.\r\nIt is probable that to sustain his action it would be necessary for the\r\nNegro to prove special damage to his business; whereas Mr. Lancaster\r\nwould not have to allege or prove any damage at all. But, save in such a\r\ncase as the above, it would be hard to imagine a circumstance in which a\r\ncourt would hold that it is injurious to a Negro in his trade, business,\r\noffice, profession, or in his social relations to be called a white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Eden v.

They have\r\nlong since become obsolete and were, during their existence, in a sense,\r\nanomalous; yet they are, perhaps, the most illuminating from a\r\nhistorical point of view of all the race distinctions in the law. They\r\nwere the result of the statutes that were enacted by the legislatures of\r\nthe Southern States between 1865 and 1868 for the definition and\r\nestablishment of the status of the Negro. The War closed in 1865; the\r\nFourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution was ratified July 28,\r\n1868; and the Reconstruction régime in the South was not under way till\r\n1868 or later. Therefore, during the interval between the close of the\r\nWar and the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment or the beginning of\r\nactive Reconstruction, the Southern States were free to adopt such\r\nmeasures as they saw fit to establish the relation between the races.\r\n\r\nThe legislatures faced a new problem, or rather an old problem increased\r\nmany fold in perplexity. They had to establish the industrial, legal,\r\nand political status of 4,000,000 people who had recently been slaves\r\nand were now freemen. It must be remembered that when the Southern\r\nlegislatures convened in 1865 their actions with regard to the Negro\r\nwere not beset by the limitations subsequently fixed by the Federal\r\nGovernment. The first Civil Rights Bill, that of 1866, had not been\r\npassed. The Southern States were at liberty to enact such statutes as\r\nthey thought proper and to draw upon their own experience and that of\r\nthe free States with regard to free Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “BLACK LAWS” OF FREE STATES\r\n\r\nThese statutes of 1865–68 are here called the “Black Laws.” This term\r\nwas first applied to the laws of the border and Northern States passed\r\nbefore and up to the Civil War to fix the position of free persons of\r\ncolor. It is well to make a cursory examination of these laws of the\r\nfree States, because they are prototypes of many of the statutes enacted\r\nby the Southern States while unhampered by Federal legislation. All the\r\nStates, North as well as South, had previously faced the problem of the\r\nfree Negro and made laws concerning him. Naturally, therefore, the\r\nSouth, now that all its Negroes were declared free, turned for\r\nprecedents to the other States which had already had experience with the\r\nfree Negro.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the statutes that had been enacted with regard\r\nto free Negroes by States lying outside of what was later the\r\nConfederacy:\r\n\r\nMaryland,[56] in 1846, denied Negroes, slave or free, the right to\r\ntestify in cases in which any white person was concerned, though it\r\npermitted the testimony of slaves against free Negroes. The\r\nConstitution[57] of 1851 forbade the legislature to pass any law\r\nabolishing the relation of master and servant.\r\n\r\nDelaware,[58] in 1851, prohibited the immigration of free Negroes from\r\nany State except Maryland: moreover, it forbade them to attend camp\r\nmeetings, except for religious worship under the control of white\r\npeople, or political gatherings. A law of 1852 provided that no free\r\nNegroes should have the right to vote or “to enjoy any other rights of a\r\nfreeman other than to hold property, or to obtain redress in law and in\r\nequity for any injury to his or her person or property.”\r\n\r\nMissouri,[59] in 1847, forbade the immigration into the State of any\r\nfree Negro; enacted that no person should keep a school for the\r\ninstruction of Negroes in reading and writing; forbade any religious\r\nmeetings of Negroes unless a justice of the peace, constable, or other\r\nofficer was present; and declared that schools and religious meetings\r\nfor free Negroes were “unlawful assemblages.”\r\n\r\nOhio, which probably had the most notorious “Black Laws” of any free\r\nState, “required colored people to give bonds for good behavior as a\r\ncondition of residence, excluded them from the schools, denied them the\r\nrights of testifying in courts of justice when a white man was party on\r\neither side, and subjected them to other unjust and degrading\r\ndisabilities.”[60]\r\n\r\nIndiana,[61] in 1851, prohibited free Negroes and mulattoes from coming\r\ninto the State, and fined all persons who employed or encouraged them to\r\nremain in the State between ten and five hundred dollars for each\r\noffense.[62] The fines were to be devoted to a fund for the colonization\r\nof Negroes.[63] A law, which was submitted to a special vote and passed\r\nby a majority of ninety thousand, prohibited intermarriage between the\r\nraces, provided for colonization of Negroes, and made incompetent the\r\ntestimony of persons having one-eighth or more Negro blood.[64]\r\n\r\nIllinois,[65] in 1853, made it a misdemeanor for a Negro to come into\r\nthe State with the intention of residing there, and provided that\r\npersons violating this law should be prosecuted and fined or sold for a\r\ntime to pay the fine.[66]\r\n\r\nIowa,[67] in 1851, forbade the immigration of free Negroes,[68] and\r\nprovided that free colored persons should not give testimony in cases in\r\nwhich a white man was a party.\r\n\r\nOregon,[69] in 1849, forbade the entrance of Negroes as settlers or\r\ninhabitants, the reason being that it would be dangerous to have them\r\nassociate with the Indians and incite the latter to hostility against\r\nwhite people.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of the “Black Laws” of some of the free States, incomplete\r\nas it is, is sufficient to show how those States regarded free Negroes.\r\nFirst, they tried to keep Negroes out; and, secondly, they subjected\r\nthose that remained to various disabilities. When the first Civil Rights\r\nBill was before Congress, the strongest opposition to its passage was on\r\nthe ground that it would compel the free States to repeal these “Black\r\nLaws” and allow Negroes to intermarry with whites, attend the same\r\nschools, sit on juries, vote, bear firearms,[70] etc. The free Negro\r\nconstituted a distinct class between the slave and the master, his\r\ncondition being more nearly that of a slave.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States had been afraid of the free Negro. He was a sort of\r\nirresponsible being, neither bond nor free, who was likely to spread and\r\nfoster discontent among the slaves. When a slave was emancipated, it was\r\ndesired that he leave the State forthwith. Thus, the Virginia\r\nConstitution[71] of 1850 provided that emancipated slaves who remained\r\nin the Commonwealth more than twelve months after they became actually\r\nfree, should forfeit their freedom and be reduced to slavery under such\r\nregulations as the law might prescribe. The free Negro was truly between\r\nthe devil and the deep sea. If he stayed in the State, he would be\r\nreënslaved; if he went to a free State, he would be liable to\r\nprosecution there for violating the laws against the immigration of free\r\npersons of color.\r\n\r\nAs one turns to the first laws passed by the Southern States after\r\nEmancipation, he should keep in mind that these States were only\r\ngrappling with the old problem of the free Negro, now on a much larger\r\nscale, which problem the free States had disposed of already in the\r\nmanner just seen. As yet, the Southern States had no conception of the\r\nNegro as a citizen with inalienable rights to be recognized and\r\nprotected. For instance, the Constitution of Mississippi[72] of 1832, as\r\namended August 1, 1865, abolished slavery and empowered the legislature\r\nto make laws for the protection and security of the persons and property\r\nof freedmen, and to guard “them and the State against any evils that may\r\narise from their sudden emancipation.” And the laws of South\r\nCarolina,[73] of the same year, provided that, “although such persons\r\n[Negroes] are not entitled to social or political equality with white\r\npersons,” they might hold property, make contracts, etc. except as\r\nhereinafter modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 RESTRICTIONS UPON MOVEMENT OF NEGROES\r\n\r\nAfter 1865 there was comparatively little legislation as to the movement\r\nof Negroes from one State to another. It would have been utterly\r\nimpossible to control the migration of the 4,000,000 Negroes then in the\r\nUnited States. In States where the free Negroes were numbered by only\r\nhundreds or even thousands, the entrance or exit of one was a noticeable\r\nevent. Where, however, Negroes were in the majority, a hundred might\r\nhave come or gone at once without being noticed. The Constitution of\r\nGeorgia[74] of 1865 empowered the general assembly to make laws for the\r\nregulation or prohibition of the immigration of free persons of color\r\ninto that State from other places; but the legislature seems not to have\r\nused this power.\r\n\r\nTwo years earlier, in 1863, the legislature of Kentucky[75] had declared\r\nthat it was unlawful for any Negro or mulatto claiming to be free under\r\nthe Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, or under any other\r\nproclamation by the Government of the United States, to migrate to or\r\nremain in the State. Any Negro violating this law was treated as a\r\nrunaway slave.\r\n\r\nA law of South Carolina,[76] of 1865, provided that no person of color\r\nshould migrate to or reside in the State unless, within twenty days\r\nafter his arrival, he entered into a bond with two freeholders as\r\nsureties in a penalty of one thousand dollars, conditioned on his good\r\nbehavior and for his support if he should become unable to support\r\nhimself. If he should fail to execute the required bond, he had to leave\r\nthe State within ten days, or be liable to corporal punishment. If,\r\nafter being so punished, he should still remain in the State fifteen\r\ndays longer, he was to be transported beyond the limits of the State for\r\nlife “or kept at hard labor, with occasional solitary confinement, for a\r\nperiod not exceeding five years.” The same punishment of banishment for\r\nlife, or confinement and hard labor for a term was prescribed for any\r\nperson of color coming or being brought into South Carolina after having\r\nbeen convicted of an infamous crime in another State.\r\n\r\nThat the Southern States believed that the day of the Negro as a laborer\r\nwas over was evidenced, not only by their efforts to keep Negroes out of\r\nthe State, but also by the fact that so many of them, during the first\r\nyears after the War, passed statutes encouraging and offering\r\ninducements to foreign immigrants. The movement to bring foreigners into\r\nthe South is still going on, but it has never met with much success.\r\n\r\nAlthough to-day many places, both in the North and in the South, do not\r\npermit Negroes to reside within their borders or even to stay over\r\nnight, the above are apparently the last instances where attempts to\r\nlimit the movement of Negroes[77] have been made by State legislatures.\r\nMost of the States have concluded to allow Negroes to come and go at\r\nwill, but to fix their status while in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n           LIMITATIONS UPON NEGROES IN RESPECT TO OCCUPATIONS\r\n\r\nFrom some occupations Negroes were wholly excluded; others, they were\r\npermitted to engage in, only after obtaining licenses. The Alabama\r\nCode[78] of 1867 provided that no free Negro should be licensed to keep\r\na tavern or to sell vinous or spirituous liquors. There had been a\r\nstatute of the same State which declared that a free Negro should not be\r\nemployed to sell or to assist in the sale of drugs or medicine, under a\r\npenalty of one hundred dollars, but this had been repealed in 1866.[79]\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina,[80] it was unlawful for a Negro either to own a\r\ndistillery of spirituous liquors or any establishment where they were\r\nsold. The violation of this law was a misdemeanor punishable by fine,\r\ncorporal punishment or hard labor. The law of this State[81] went still\r\nfurther by enacting that no person of color should pursue or practice\r\nthe art, trade, or business of an artisan, mechanic, or shopkeeper, “or\r\nany other trade, employment, or business (besides that of husbandry, or\r\nthat of a servant under contract for service or labor) on his own\r\naccount and for his own benefit, or in partnership with a white person,\r\nor as agent or servant of any person” until he should have obtained a\r\nlicense. This license was good for one year only. Before granting the\r\nlicense the judge had to be satisfied of the skill, fitness, and good\r\nmoral character of the applicant. If the latter wished to be a\r\nshopkeeper or peddler, the annual license fee was one hundred dollars;\r\nif a mechanic, artisan, or a member of any other trade, ten dollars. The\r\njudge might revoke the license upon a complaint made to him. Negroes\r\ncould not practice any mechanical art or trade without showing either\r\nthat they had served their term of apprenticeship or were then\r\npracticing the art or trade. For violation of this rule, the Negro had\r\nto pay a fine of double the amount of the license, one-half to go to the\r\ninformer.\r\n\r\nIn some States, there was a limitation upon the right of Negroes to hold\r\nland as tenants. A statute of Mississippi[82] in 1865 gave them the\r\nright to sue and be sued, to hold property, etc., but declared that the\r\nprovisions of the statute should not be construed to allow any freeman,\r\nfree Negro, or mulatto to rent or lease any lands, except in\r\nincorporated towns or cities in which places the corporate authorities\r\nshould control the same. The same statute required every freeman, free\r\nNegro, or mulatto to have on January 1, 1866, and annually thereafter, a\r\nlawful home and employment with written evidence thereof. If living in\r\nan incorporated town, he must have a license from the mayor, authorizing\r\nhim to do irregular job work—that is, if he was not under some written\r\ncontract for service; if living outside such a town, he must have a\r\nsimilar license from a member of the board of police of his precinct.\r\n\r\nTennessee,[83] on the other hand, went to the length of expressly\r\nthrowing open all trades to Negroes who complied with the license laws\r\nwhich were applicable to whites and blacks alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SALE OF FIREARMS AND LIQUOR TO NEGROES\r\n\r\nA fruitful subject of legislation was that relative to the sale of\r\nfirearms to Negroes. On January 15, 1866, the legislature of Florida[84]\r\nenacted a law declaring that it was unlawful for a Negro to own, use, or\r\nkeep in his possession or control “any bowie-knife, dirk, sword,\r\nfirearms or ammunition of any kind” unless he had obtained a license\r\nfrom the probate judge of the county. To get the license, he had to\r\npresent the certificate of two respectable citizens of the county as to\r\nthe peaceful and orderly character of the applicant. The violation of\r\nthis statute was a misdemeanor punishable by the forfeiture to the use\r\nof the informer of such firearms and ammunition and by standing in a\r\npillory one hour or by being whipped not over thirty-nine stripes.\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi[85] the law was that any freedman, free Negro, or\r\nmulatto, not in the military service of the United States nor having a\r\nspecified license, who should keep or carry firearms of any kind or any\r\nammunition, dirk, or bowie-knife should be punished by a fine of not\r\nover ten dollars, and all such arms, etc., should be forfeited to the\r\ninformer. The law further provided that, if any white person lent or\r\ngave a freedman, free Negro, or mulatto any firearms, ammunition, dirk,\r\nor bowie-knife, such white person should be fined not over fifty\r\ndollars, or imprisoned not over thirty days. South Carolina[86] did\r\nallow a Negro who was the owner of a farm, to keep a “shot-gun or rifle,\r\nsuch as is ordinarily used in hunting, but not a pistol, musket, or\r\nother firearm or weapon appropriate for purposes of war.”\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that some States forbade Negroes to make or sell\r\nintoxicating liquor. Others went a step further and made it unlawful to\r\nsell liquor to Negroes. It is worth noting that one of the early acts of\r\nthe legislature of Alabama[87] was to repeal such a law. But\r\nKentucky[88] forbade a coffee-house keeper to sell liquor to free\r\nNegroes under penalty of a bond of five hundred dollars. Mississippi[89]\r\nmade it an offence, punishable by a fine of not over fifty dollars or\r\nimprisonment for not more than thirty days, for a white man to sell,\r\ngive, or lend a Negro any intoxicating liquors, except that a master,\r\nmistress, or employer might give him spirituous liquors, but not in\r\nquantities sufficient to produce intoxication.\r\n\r\nThese laws against the sale of firearms and liquor to Negroes probably\r\ngrew out of a fear by the white people of a Negro uprising, such as had\r\noccurred during slavery. The South was in such a turmoil immediately\r\nafter the War that stringent precautionary measures were considered\r\nnecessary. These statutes have analogies in the present laws of the\r\nWestern States against the sale of firearms and liquor to Indians. The\r\nlaw of Arizona[90] declares that anyone who sells or gives intoxicating\r\nliquor to an Indian is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by\r\na fine of between one hundred and three hundred dollars or imprisoned\r\nbetween one and six months, or both. The sale or gift or repair of\r\nfirearms was added in 1883.[91] Idaho[92] has a law very much the same,\r\nmaking the fine, however, not over five hundred dollars or the term of\r\nimprisonment not over six months, or both. Dakota Territory,[93] in\r\n1865, made it a misdemeanor to sell or give liquor to Indians.\r\nNebraska,[94] in 1881, made it an offence punishable by a fine of fifty\r\ndollars to sell liquor to them, and in 1891 made it a felony to sell or\r\ngive liquor to any Indian not a citizen, attaching a fine of not over\r\none thousand dollars or imprisonment in the penitentiary between two and\r\nfive years. New Mexico[95] makes the punishment a fine between twenty\r\nand one hundred dollars or imprisonment not over three months. Utah[96]\r\nmakes the punishment a fine between ten and one hundred dollars. The law\r\nof Oregon[97] made it lawful for every _white_ male citizen of the age\r\nof sixteen to keep and carry certain arms, impliedly denying that right\r\nto other races. Washington[98] made the punishment for selling or giving\r\nliquor to Indians a fine of between twenty-five and one hundred dollars.\r\nAs late as 1903 one finds in the revised statutes of Maine[99] a\r\nprovision that one who sells or gives to an Indian intoxicating liquors\r\nforfeits not less than five nor more than twenty dollars, one-half to\r\ncomplainant. It must be clear that the foregoing laws were not passed\r\nsolely for the moral uplift of the Indian, but quite as much as a\r\nprotection to white people from drunken Indians. A similar motive must\r\nhave actuated the Southern States in enacting the laws of 1865–1868, and\r\nit has been, at least, one incentive for the present prohibition\r\nlegislation in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LABOR CONTRACTS OF NEGROES\r\n\r\nAnother common form of legislation with regard to free Negroes was that\r\nrelative to their contracts for personal service. A Florida[100] statute\r\nof 1865 required that all contracts with persons of color should be in\r\nwriting and fully explained to them before two credible witnesses, and\r\nthat one copy of the contract should be kept by the employer and the\r\nother by some judicial officer of the State and county wherein the\r\nservice was to be performed. Contracts for less than thirty days might\r\nbe oral. The Negro who failed to perform his contract by wilful\r\ndisobedience of orders, wanton impudence, or disrespect, failure or\r\nrefusal to do the work assigned to him, idleness, or abandonment of the\r\npremises, was treated as a vagrant. In 1866[101] the law ceased to be a\r\nrace distinction when, by a new enactment, it was greatly limited and\r\nmade applicable to whites and blacks alike.\r\n\r\nThe law of Kentucky[102] required contracts between white persons and\r\nNegroes to be in writing and attested by some white person. The\r\ncontracts were to be treated as entire, so that, if either party should,\r\nwithout good cause, abandon the contract, the other should be held to\r\nhave performed his obligation.\r\n\r\nMississippi[103] enacted that all contracts for labor with freedmen,\r\nfree Negroes, or mulattoes for a longer period than one month should be\r\nin writing, attested by two disinterested white persons in the county\r\nwhere the labor was to be performed, and read to the Negro by some\r\nofficer. If the laborer quit without good cause before the expiration of\r\nthe term, he forfeited his wages for the year up to the time of\r\nquitting. That State made it the duty of every civil officer and the\r\noption of every other person to arrest and carry back to his employer\r\nevery Negro laborer who had left, and the person making the arrest was\r\nentitled to receive five dollars as a fee and ten cents per mile from\r\nthe place of arrest to the place of delivery, the same to be paid by the\r\nemployer and taken out of the wages of the Negro. The Negro might appeal\r\nto a justice of the peace who might summarily try the merits of the\r\ncase. Then, either the master or the servant might appeal to the county\r\ncourt which had power to remand the deserter to the employer or to\r\ndispose of him otherwise as it thought right and just, and its decision\r\nwas final.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia[104] all contracts for service between a white person and a\r\nNegro for more than two months had to be in writing, signed by both\r\nparties, acknowledged before a justice of the peace, notary public,\r\nclerk of the county or corporation court, overseer of the poor, or two\r\nor more credible witnesses in the county or corporation where the work\r\nwas to be done. And the justice, notary, etc., had to read and explain\r\nthe contract to the Negro.\r\n\r\nOf all the Southern States, South Carolina[105] went much the furthest\r\ninto detail as to contracts for service. Persons of color who made\r\ncontracts for service or labor were to be known as servants, and those\r\nwith whom they contracted, as masters. Contracts for one month or more\r\nmust be in writing, attested by one white witness, and approved by the\r\njudge of the district court or a magistrate. If the period of service\r\nwas not mentioned, it was until the twenty-fifth of December next after\r\nmaking the contract. If the wages were not stipulated, they were to be\r\nfixed by the district judge or magistrate on application by one of the\r\nparties and notice to the other. A Negro, ten years or more of age,\r\nhaving no parent living in the district and not an apprentice, might\r\nmake a valid contract for a year or less. Contracts must be presented\r\nfor approval within twenty days. Contracts for one month or more were\r\nnot binding on the servant unless written and approved. Failure to make\r\nsuch a written contract was a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of from\r\nfive dollars to fifty dollars. If the servant received only board and\r\nclothing, a written contract was unnecessary. The fee for approval\r\nranged between twenty-five cents for a contract of one month or less to\r\none dollar for a contract for one year and one dollar for each year or\r\npart of a year in addition, half the fee to be paid by each party.\r\n\r\nLabor on farms was minutely regulated. Hours of labor, except on\r\nSundays, were from sunrise to sunset, with a reasonable interval for\r\nbreakfast and dinner. Servants must “rise at the dawn in the morning,\r\nfeed, water, and care for the animals on the farm, do the usual and\r\nneedful work about the premises, prepare their meals for the day, if\r\nrequired by the master, and begin the farm work or other work by\r\nsunrise.” They must be careful of all the animals and property of their\r\nmasters, and especially of the animals and implements used by them; must\r\nprevent them from injury by others. They were answerable for all\r\nproperty lost, destroyed, or injured by their negligence, dishonesty, or\r\nbad faith.\r\n\r\nAll lost time, not occasioned by the master, and all losses caused by\r\nneglect of duty might be deducted from the wages of the servant. Food,\r\nnursing, and other necessaries for the servant, while absent from work\r\non account of sickness or other cause, might also be deducted. Servants\r\nmust be quiet and orderly in their quarters, at their work, and on the\r\npremises. They must extinguish their lights and fires, and retire to\r\nrest at seasonable hours. Work at night and out-door work in bad weather\r\nwas not to be exacted except in cases of necessity.\r\n\r\nServants were not to be kept at home on Sundays unless to take care of\r\nthe premises or animals, for work of daily necessity, or on unusual\r\noccasions; and then only so many as were necessary to do the work.\r\nSunday work must be done by them in turn, except in cases of sickness or\r\ndisability, when the work might be assigned out of order. Those away on\r\nSunday must be back by sunset.\r\n\r\nMasters might give servants tasks, and might require them to rate\r\nthemselves as full hands, three-quarters, half, or one-quarter in order\r\nto determine the task. If the servant complained of the task, the\r\ndistrict judge or magistrate might reduce or increase it.\r\n\r\nVisitors of servants could not be invited or allowed by the servants to\r\ncome on the premises of the master without his express consent, nor\r\ncould servants be absent from the premises without such permission.\r\n\r\nIf the servant left his employment without good cause, he forfeited all\r\nthe wages due him. He must obey all lawful orders of the master or his\r\nagent, and “be honest, truthful, sober, civil, and diligent in his\r\nbusiness.” The master might moderately correct servants under eighteen\r\nyears of age. He was not liable to pay for any additional services of a\r\nservant, if they were necessary, except by express agreement.\r\n\r\nThe master might discharge the servant for: (1) wilful disobedience of\r\nthe lawful order of himself or his agent; (2) habitual negligence or\r\nindolence in business; (3) drunkenness, grossly immoral or illegal\r\nconduct; (4) want of respect and courtesy to himself, his family,\r\nguests, or agents; (5) or for prolonged absence from the premises, or\r\nabsence on two or more occasions without permission. Or, if the master\r\npreferred, he might report the servant to the district judge or\r\nmagistrate, who had power to inflict suitable corporal punishment or\r\nimpose a fine, and remand him to work; the fine to be deducted from the\r\nwages, if not paid. These were the means by which the judge or\r\nmagistrate might compel the servant to perform his contract.\r\n\r\nThe master was not liable to third persons for the voluntary trespasses,\r\ntorts, and misdemeanors of his servants. Nor was he liable for any\r\ncontract of his servant unless made with the master’s authority, nor for\r\nany acts of the servant unless done within the scope of his authority or\r\nin the course of his employment. It was the master’s duty to protect his\r\nservant from violence at the hands of others and to aid him in getting\r\nredress for injuries.\r\n\r\nFor a person to deprive the master of the services of his servant,\r\nknowing him to be such, by enticing him away, harboring him, detaining\r\nhim, beating, confining, disabling, or in any way injuring him was\r\npunishable by a fine of from twenty dollars to two hundred dollars, and\r\nimprisonment or hard labor for not over sixty days. In addition, the\r\nmaster might recover damages for loss of such services.\r\n\r\nThe master had the right to command the servant to aid him in the\r\ndefence of his own person, family, premises, or property. He did not\r\nhave to furnish medicine or medical assistance to the servant unless he\r\nespecially agreed to do so.\r\n\r\nThe master might inform a prospective employer of the character of a\r\nNegro who had been in his service, and this was a privileged\r\ncommunication unless falsely and maliciously made. The servant could not\r\nmake a new contract without producing the discharge of his former master\r\nor of the district judge or magistrate.\r\n\r\nIf the master was convicted of a felony or if he managed or controlled\r\nhis servants so as to make them a nuisance to the neighborhood, any\r\nwhite freeholder might complain to the district judge and have the\r\ncontract annulled, and the master could not employ any colored servant\r\nwithin two years.\r\n\r\nA servant had the right to leave his master’s service for: (1) an\r\ninsufficient supply of food; (2) an unauthorized battery upon his person\r\nor upon a member of his family, not committed in the defence of the\r\nperson, family, guest, or agent of the master; (3) invasion by the\r\nmaster of the conjugal rights of the servant; (4) or failure by the\r\nmaster to pay wages when due. In any one of the above cases, the servant\r\nmight collect his wages due him at the time of his departure.\r\n\r\nIf the master died, the contract—contrary to the usual rule of law—was\r\nnot terminated without the assent of the servant. His wages up to one\r\nyear took preference over other debts of the master. If the servant was\r\nwrongfully discharged, he could collect wages for the whole period of\r\nthe contract. Upon the servant’s discharge or the expiration of his term\r\nof service, the master must furnish him a certificate of discharge, and\r\nupon his request, a certificate of character. If the servant forged or\r\naltered this certificate—as by falsely claiming that he had been in a\r\ncertain previous service—he was guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a\r\nfine of not over one hundred dollars. All disputes as to alleged\r\nwrongful discharges or departures were to be heard by the district\r\njudge, who could compel the master to take back the servant or forfeit a\r\npenalty of a fine of twenty dollars; or compel the servant to return to\r\nhis master under pain of corporal punishment or fine.\r\n\r\nA servant was not liable for contracts made by the express authority of\r\nhis master. Nor was he liable civilly or criminally for any act done by\r\nthe command of his master in defence of his master’s person, family,\r\nguest, servant, premises, or property.\r\n\r\nNegroes employed as house servants had, at “all hours of the day and\r\nnight, and on all days of the week,” to answer promptly all calls and\r\nexecute all lawful orders and commands of the master’s family. They had\r\nto be especially civil and polite to their master, his family, and\r\nguests, for which they in turn should “receive gentle and kind\r\ntreatment.”\r\n\r\nThe statute provided for a regular form of contract between master and\r\nservant, which was understood to include all of the above stipulations\r\nunless otherwise provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            APPRENTICE LAWS\r\n\r\nThe early legislatures also made detailed apprentice laws. Although it\r\nis scarcely open to argument that, in making such laws, they did not\r\nhave in mind primarily Negroes, still many of the statutes made no\r\nmention of race, and, therefore, cannot be properly discussed here.\r\nThus, Alabama[106] had a long statute on apprentices, but the only\r\nreference to the Negro was the rule that, if the minor be a child of a\r\nfreedman, the former owner of the child should have the preference of\r\napprenticing him, if a suitable person.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky,[107] if the apprentice was white, the master must teach him\r\nreading, writing, and common arithmetic up to and including the “Rule of\r\nThree”; if a Negro, the master must pay at the end of the apprenticeship\r\nfifty dollars to a girl and one hundred dollars to a boy, but if the\r\nmaster should teach the apprentice to read and write, he was not bound\r\nto pay any money. In Kentucky, also, in apprenticing Negroes, preference\r\nwas given to their former owners, if the latter were suitable persons.\r\n\r\nMississippi[108] had an elaborate apprentice law which related only to\r\nfreedmen, free Negroes, and mulattoes. The sheriffs, justices of the\r\npeace, and other civil officers of the county had to report to the\r\nprobate court semiannually, in January and July, the names of all\r\nfreedmen, free Negroes, and mulattoes, under the age of eighteen, who\r\nwhere orphans or whose parents were unable or unwilling to support them.\r\nIt was the duty of the court, thereupon, to order the apprenticing of\r\nsuch minors, preference being given to their former masters if suitable\r\npersons. The master had to furnish a bond payable to the State\r\nconditioned upon his furnishing the minor with sufficient food and\r\nclothing, treating him humanely, giving him medical attention when sick,\r\nand, if the minor was under fifteen, teaching him or having him taught\r\nto read and write. Males were bound till they were twenty-one; females,\r\ntill they were eighteen. The master could inflict moderate corporal\r\nchastisement as a father or guardian might do; but in no case could he\r\ninflict cruel or inhuman punishment.\r\n\r\nIf the apprentice ran away, the master might pursue him and bring him\r\nbefore a justice of the peace who could remand him to the service of his\r\nmaster. If the apprentice refused to return, he might be put into jail\r\nuntil the next term of the court, when his case would be investigated.\r\nIf it was found that he left without cause, he could be punished like a\r\nhired freedman; but if he had a good cause, the court might discharge\r\nhim and enter judgment against his master for not over one hundred\r\ndollars to be paid to the apprentice. Anyone enticing an apprentice away\r\nfrom his master, knowingly employing him, furnishing him food or\r\nclothing, or giving or selling him liquor without the master’s consent\r\nwas guilty of a high misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nIf the master wished to get rid of the apprentice, he might go before\r\nthe probate court, which could cancel his bond, and re-apprentice the\r\nminor. If the master died, the court in re-apprenticing would give\r\npreference to the widow or other member of the family of the deceased.\r\nIf the master wished to move to another State and take his apprentice\r\nwith him, he had to execute a bond conditioned upon his compliance with\r\nthe apprentice laws of the State to which he was going. Any parent of a\r\nfree Negro or mulatto might apprentice his minor child, and if the age\r\ncould not be fixed by record testimony, the court fixed it.\r\n\r\nThe only race distinction made by North Carolina[109] was the law that\r\nno white child should be bound to a colored master or mistress, and this\r\ncame in 1874—long after the period here considered.\r\n\r\nThe apprentice laws of South Carolina[110] which applied only to Negroes\r\nwere almost as elaborate as those of Mississippi. A child over two years\r\nof age, born of a colored parent, might be bound as an apprentice to any\r\nrespectable white or colored person; if a male, till he was twenty-one;\r\nif a female, till she was eighteen. Illegitimate children might be bound\r\nout by their mother. If the child had no parent in the district; or if\r\nhis parents were paupers, or unable to support him, or were not teaching\r\nhim the habits of industry and honesty, or were of a notoriously bad\r\ncharacter or vagrants, or if either of them had been convicted of an\r\ninfamous crime, he might be apprenticed by the district judge or by a\r\nmagistrate. Males of twelve and females of ten had to sign the contract\r\nof apprenticeship and were bound thereby; but their refusal to sign\r\nwould not affect the validity of the instrument. If the apprenticeship\r\nwas voluntary, the contract had to be under seal, signed by the master,\r\nparent, and apprentice, attested by two credible witnesses, and approved\r\nby the district judge or magistrate. One copy of the contract was kept\r\nby the master, another, filed in the office of the clerk of court. The\r\nmaster had to pay three dollars for the approval of the contract by the\r\ndistrict judge or magistrate.\r\n\r\nOther duties devolving upon the master were to teach the apprentice the\r\nbusiness of husbandry or some other useful trade or business specified\r\nin the contract; to furnish him wholesome food and suitable clothing; to\r\nteach him habits of industry, honesty, and morality; to govern and treat\r\nhim with humanity; and if there was a colored school within convenient\r\ndistance, to send him to school as much as six weeks of each year after\r\nhe was ten years of age. The teacher of such school must have the\r\nlicense of the district judge to establish it.\r\n\r\nThe master could inflict moderate chastisement, impose reasonable\r\nrestraint on the apprentice, and bring him back if he ran away. If the\r\nmaster neglected his duty or subjected the apprentice to the danger of\r\nmoral contamination, the district judge might dissolve the relation of\r\nmaster and apprentice. All cases of dispute between master and\r\napprentice were to be tried before a magistrate, who had the power to\r\npunish the party found to be at fault. If the judge ordered the\r\napprentice discharged for immoderate correction or unlawful restraint,\r\nthe master might be indicted and punished by a fine of not over fifty\r\ndollars or imprisonment of thirty days. In addition, the apprentice had\r\nan action for damages.\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of the term of service, the apprentice was entitled\r\nto not over sixty dollars from his master. To the apprentice also\r\napplied the provisions for the servant under contract, which have been\r\nconsidered, except that the master was bound to furnish him medical aid,\r\nas he did not have to do in the case of the servant. And for apprentices\r\nalso, as in the case of servants, there was a regular form of contract\r\nwhich was understood to contain all the above stipulations.\r\n\r\nIn Delaware,[111] not a Southern State, but much like the Southern\r\nStates in its dealings with the Negro, in its code of 1852 as amended in\r\n1893, is this belated statute: “Any two justices of the peace, on\r\nreceiving information of any Negro or mulatto child in their county,\r\nhaving no parents in this State, or who, being under the age of fifteen\r\nyears, have no parent able to maintain them, or who do not bring them up\r\nto industry and stable employment, shall issue process to a constable\r\ncommanding him to bring such child before them at a specified time and\r\nplace, and to give notice thereof to the parents, if any, and shall\r\nthereupon inquire into their circumstances; and if it appear to be a\r\nproper case for binding such child, they shall proceed to bind said\r\nchild as a servant, unless they shall deem the binding, under the\r\ncircumstances, to be inexpedient.”\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of these apprentice laws was tested as early as\r\n1867.[112] A Negro girl, who had been a slave in Maryland and had been\r\nfreed by the Constitution of that State, November 1, 1864, was, two days\r\nlater, apprenticed by her mother to her former master. The laws\r\ngoverning Negro apprentices differed from those governing white\r\napprentices in that the master did not obligate himself to teach the\r\nNegro apprentice reading, writing, and arithmetic, and retained the\r\nright to transmit the apprentice anywhere in the county. Upon a petition\r\nfor a writ of _habeas corpus_, the Federal court held that the Maryland\r\nlaw resulted in practical slavery and, hence, violated the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment and the Civil Rights Bill of 1866.\r\n\r\nThe other Southern States had apprentice laws, possibly as detailed as\r\nthe ones here considered, but they cannot be treated of here because\r\nthey applied to white and colored children alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VAGRANCY LAWS\r\n\r\nThe present vagrancy laws of the South have been much criticised for the\r\nreason, as it is alleged, that they are used to get recruits for chain\r\ngangs and convict camps, and that Negro vagrants are taken up while\r\nwhite vagrants go scotfree. Be that as it may, the fault lies with the\r\nofficers, not with the law, for the law, on its face, applies to both\r\nraces equally. But the first years after the War did witness the\r\nenactment of vagrancy laws which had special application to Negroes.\r\nSome States passed vagrancy laws which made no race distinction, but, as\r\nin the case of apprentices, it is beyond dispute that they were aimed\r\nespecially at the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe following persons South Carolina[113] classed as vagrants: (1) all\r\npersons who have not some fixed and known place of abode, and some\r\nlawful and reputable employment; (2) those who have not some visible and\r\nknown means of a fair, honest, and reputable livelihood; (3) all common\r\nprostitutes; (4) those who are found wandering from place to place,\r\nvending, bartering, or peddling any articles or commodities without a\r\nlicense; (5) all common gamblers; (6) persons who lead idle or\r\ndisorderly lives, or keep or frequent disorderly or disreputable houses\r\nor places; (7) those who, not having sufficient means of support, are\r\nable to work and do not work; (8) those who (whether or not they own\r\nlands, or are lessees or mechanics) do not provide a reasonable and\r\nproper maintenance for themselves and families; (9) those who are\r\nengaged in representing publicly or privately, for fee or reward,\r\nwithout license, any tragedy, interlude, comedy, farce, play, or other\r\nsimilar entertainment, exhibition of the circus, sleight-of-hand,\r\nwaxworks, or the like; (10) those who, for private gain, without\r\nlicense, give any concert or musical entertainment, of any description;\r\n(11) fortune tellers; (12) sturdy beggars; (13) common drunkards; (14)\r\nthose who hunt game of any description, or fish on the land of others or\r\nfrequent the premises, contrary to the will of the occupants. That the\r\nSouth Carolina legislature had the Negro primarily in mind is shown by\r\nthe fact that this section is included in the act “to establish and\r\nregulate the domestic relations of persons of color and to amend the law\r\nin relation to paupers and vagrancy.”\r\n\r\nMississippi[114] had a vagrancy list almost as extensive as that above\r\nwith the addition that any freedmen, free Negroes, or mulattoes over\r\neighteen years of age, found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or\r\nthereafter, with no lawful employment or business, or found unlawfully\r\nassembling themselves together in the day or night time, and white\r\npersons “so assembling with freedmen, free Negroes, or mulattoes ... on\r\nterms of equality, or living in adultery or fornication with a\r\nfreedwoman, free Negro, or mulatto,” should be considered vagrants. The\r\nwhite man so convicted was punishable by a fine of two hundred dollars\r\nand imprisonment for not more than six months; the Negro, by a fine of\r\nfifty dollars and imprisonment for not over ten days. A Negro unable to\r\npay his fine might be hired out for the purpose, but no such provision\r\napplied to whites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PAUPER LAWS\r\n\r\nAnother perplexing problem that faced the Southern legislatures was how\r\nto meet the needs of the paupers, white and Negro. Much of the property\r\nof the white people had been swept away entirely or had greatly\r\ndeteriorated in value as a result of the War. Few of the Negroes, to be\r\nsure, had property to lose, but what was worse, they had lost their\r\nright to look to the white people for sustenance. Many of them were\r\nunable to support themselves, and the white people could not help them.\r\nThe legislatures, therefore, adopted the plan of levying a tax upon each\r\nrace for the support of its own indigents. South Carolina and\r\nMississippi again took the lead.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina,[115] when a person of color was unable to earn his\r\nsupport and was likely to become a public charge, the father and\r\ngrandfathers, mother and grandmothers, child and grandchildren, brother\r\nand sister of such a person should each according to ability contribute\r\nfor the support of his or her relative. In each judicial district there\r\nwas a “Board of Relief of Indigent Persons of Color,” consisting of from\r\nfour to eight magistrates, each magistrate looking after the indigent\r\nNegroes in his precinct. There was a fund, composed of fees paid for the\r\napproval of contracts for service, instruments of apprenticeship,\r\nlicenses, fines, penalties, forfeitures, and wages of convicts, for the\r\nrelief of indigent Negroes. If this fund was insufficient, the board\r\nmight impose a tax of one dollar upon all male persons of color between\r\neighteen and fifty, and fifty cents upon each female between eighteen\r\nand forty-five. This tax had to be paid on the day fixed or the person\r\nrendered himself liable to pay a double tax. It was the duty of every\r\noccupant of premises to make a report to the magistrate of any indigent\r\ncolored person thereon, and the magistrate had to make inquiry into the\r\ncondition and wants of such Negroes so reported. Moreover, the\r\nmagistrate had to make a semiannual report of the condition of such\r\nNegroes to the chairman of the Board of Relief. The machinery for taking\r\ncare of Negro paupers was worked out in more detail than it would be\r\nprofitable to go into here.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina made also these very humane provisions: Where, upon any\r\nfarm or lands, there were, on December 21, 1865, persons of color who\r\nwere formerly the slaves of the owner, lessee, or occupant of the farm\r\nor lands present there on November 10, 1865, and had been there six\r\nmonths previous, helpless, either from old age, infancy, disease, or\r\nother cause, and unable to maintain themselves and had no parent or\r\nother relative able to maintain them or to provide other houses or\r\nquarters, it was not lawful for the present or any subsequent owner,\r\nlessee, or occupant before January 1, 1867, to evict such helpless\r\nperson of color, under penalty of a fine of fifty dollars, or\r\nimprisonment of one month.\r\n\r\nThe law of Mississippi[116] provided that the same liabilities should\r\nrest on Negroes to support their indigents as upon white persons to\r\nsupport theirs. It levied a tax of one dollar upon every freedman, free\r\nNegro, or mulatto between eighteen and sixty to go into the Freedmen’s\r\nPauper Fund. If a Negro refused to pay the tax, he might be arrested and\r\nhired out till he had worked out the amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southern States between 1865 and 1868 passed many statutes relative\r\nto the marital relations of Negroes and to their right to testify in\r\ncourt. But these statutes are to be discussed in later chapters. It may\r\nbe said, however, in passing, that the district judge, so often referred\r\nto in connection with the South Carolina laws, was a special officer\r\nwhose main duty was to preside over cases and disputes to which Negroes\r\nwere parties.\r\n\r\nThis chapter has been confined to the early industrial distinctions\r\nbetween the races—that is, to those laws which related to the rights of\r\nthe Negro as a bread-winner. These are the distinctions brought forward\r\nby those who believed in radical reconstruction measures in the South,\r\nas an argument for their position. It was urged by such that, unless\r\nCongress stepped in and took a hand, the Southern States would reënslave\r\nthe Negro: they pointed particularly to the laws of Mississippi and\r\nSouth Carolina in confirmation of their contention. And there was\r\napparently good ground for such a view. The laws providing that colored\r\nlaborers should be called servants and their employers masters, that\r\nthey should arise at a certain time and work so many hours per day, that\r\nthey could not leave the premises or receive visitors without the\r\nmaster’s consent, and the like, sounded very much like prescribing the\r\nduties and privileges of a slave. But, on the other hand, many of the\r\nrequirements were for the protection of the Negro. Such, for instance,\r\nwere the statutes requiring contracts for service to be in writing and\r\nthe terms of them explained to the Negro; that helpless ex-slaves should\r\nnot be evicted from their old homes within two years from January 1,\r\n1865; that Negro paupers should be cared for; and that the master must\r\nteach his apprentice to read and write, must give him good food and\r\nclothing, and treat him humanely.\r\n\r\nA discussion, however, of the merits of these early laws is out of place\r\nhere. But it is only fair to remember, in reading them, that the\r\nSouthern legislatures were, in many instances, only following precedents\r\nthat had been set by the free States in dealing with free Negroes, and\r\nthat the States, either Northern or Southern, had not yet looked upon\r\nthe Negro as a citizen with the rights guaranteed him by the amended\r\nFederal Constitution. Industrial conditions in the South were so\r\ndemoralized by the War and Emancipation that the legislatures considered\r\nit imperative upon them to take immediate and positive steps to\r\nestablish an industrial relation between the races.\r\n\r\nPractically all of these laws were repealed or became dead letters as\r\nsoon as the Fourteenth Amendment was passed or, at least, as soon as the\r\ngovernment of the Southern States went into the hands of the\r\nReconstructionists. But they are still interesting historically as\r\nhaving furnished an argument for the radical régime of Reconstruction\r\nwhich Thaddeus Stevens and his supporters inaugurated and advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Md., 1846–47, chap. 27.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Art.

It is generally known\r\nthat the marriage ties between slaves were loose and their domestic\r\nrelations irregular. In some instances, slave marriages were solemnized\r\naccording to legal requirements, by either a white clergyman or other\r\nproper officer of the law; in others, there was the common law\r\nmarriage—that is, the parties lived together as husband and wife under a\r\nsimple, unrecorded agreement between themselves; in still other\r\ninstances, there was deplorable promiscuity.\r\n\r\nWhen the Negro was made a citizen, it became necessary at once to settle\r\nhis marital relations. If the usual slave marriages were not recognized\r\nas legal, then the offspring of such unions were bastards with the usual\r\ndisqualifications of that class, among which is their partial incapacity\r\nto inherit property. In order to secure to Negroes the rights of heirs,\r\nit was necessary to legalize slave marriages, at least to the extent of\r\ngiving to the children of such marriages the right of inheritance. This\r\nwas accomplished in one of three ways. Some States required the\r\nemancipated slaves to be remarried in order to legitimate their\r\noffspring; others required them to appear before an officer, declare\r\ntheir desire to continue to live together, and get a certificate; others\r\nstill, and these were in the majority, passed statutes legalizing all\r\nslave marriages. A few States did not adopt any one of these three\r\nmethods but left it to the courts to recognize the legality of such\r\nmarriages as cases arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              REMARRIAGES\r\n\r\nAmong the States which adopted the method of remarrying was\r\nFlorida,[117] which, by a law of 1866, required all colored persons\r\nliving together as husband and wife, who had not been legally married,\r\nand who wished to continue so to live together, to be married within\r\nnine months from the passage of the statute on January 11th. If they\r\nfailed to be married but continued to live together, they were punished\r\nas guilty of fornication and adultery. By the second marriage, their\r\nchildren were legitimated. The law made it incumbent upon the clerk of\r\nthe court, upon application by the parties and a tender of the required\r\nfee, to enter a certificate of marriage upon his register. Anyone\r\npracticing fraud upon Negroes by pretending to perform the marriage\r\nceremony without authority to do so was guilty of a misdemeanor and\r\npunishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, imprisonment\r\nnot over six months, or might be sentenced to stand in a pillory not\r\nover one hour. After the expiration of the nine months named in the\r\nstatute, the marriage requirements for white and colored persons were\r\nthe same. This statute of 1866[118] was amended, on December 14, of the\r\nsame year, to the effect that, if persons of color had lived together as\r\nhusband and wife and had recognized each other as such, they were to be\r\nconsidered married and their children to be legitimate. Thus, the\r\nnecessity of a remarriage was obviated. The amendment was added\r\napparently because of the great number of indictments for adultery\r\nagainst those who had not complied with the law of January 11th.\r\n\r\nThe Georgia[119] Constitution of 1865 directed the General Assembly at\r\nits next session to pass a law to legalize the existing slave marriages\r\nand to provide for the contracting and solemnizing of future marriages\r\nand, in connection with this, to define and regulate the Negro’s right\r\nto devise and inherit property. The General Assembly[120] responded in\r\n1866 by enacting a statute by which persons of color then living\r\ntogether as husband and wife were declared to be so. If the man had two\r\nreputed wives or the wife two reputed husbands, he or she must select\r\none of the two as wife or husband, with her or his consent, and have the\r\nceremony of marriage performed. If they continued to cohabit without\r\nmaking this choice, they were guilty of fornication and adultery. It was\r\nnot enough to make the selection and live faithful to the one chosen;\r\nthe marriage ceremony was a requisite.[121] Unless there were two\r\nreputed husbands or wives, the ceremony was not necessary.[122] By the\r\nsame act[123] the children of slave marriages were legitimated, and\r\nNegro ministers were given a similar right to perform marriage\r\nceremonies for Negroes as white ministers had for both races.\r\n\r\nMissouri,[124] in 1865, required all persons of color claiming to be\r\nmarried and wishing to continue in that relation to appear before some\r\none authorized to perform the ceremony and be joined in marriage.\r\n\r\nThe same year, South Carolina[125] passed a statute of ninety-nine\r\nsections relative to persons of color, eleven of which concerned their\r\nmarital relations. This statute established the relation of husband and\r\nwife between persons of color, and declared that those then living as\r\nsuch were husband and wife. If a man had two or more reputed wives or a\r\nwoman two or more reputed husbands, he or she must choose one of them by\r\nApril 1, 1866, and be remarried. Children born before the enactment of\r\nthis law were declared to be the legitimate offspring of their mother,\r\nand of their putative father also if they were acknowledged by him.\r\nThereafter, Negroes must be married as white people were—by a clergyman,\r\njudge, magistrate, or other judicial officer. The husband who abandoned\r\nhis wife or the wife who abandoned her husband, might be bound out from\r\nyear to year until he or she was willing to resume conjugal relations.\r\nAn abandoned wife was free to make a contract for service. South\r\nCarolina has been apparently the only State to provide for the children\r\nof white fathers and Negro mothers. A law[126] of 1872 declared that\r\nsuch children might inherit from their father if he did not marry\r\nanother woman but continued to live with their mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CERTIFICATES OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nKentucky, Louisiana, and Maryland provided for the marriage of former\r\nslaves by the second method enumerated above, the granting of\r\ncertificates. The Kentucky law[127] declared that all colored persons\r\nwho had been living together as husband and wife and who continued to do\r\nso should be regarded as legally married and their children legitimate.\r\nBut the man and woman must appear before the clerk of the county court\r\nand declare that they had been living and wished to continue to live as\r\nhusband and wife. Upon payment of fifty cents, the clerk recorded the\r\ndeclaration, and for twenty-five cents more issued a certificate thereof\r\nto the parties. It was not a sufficient compliance with the statute for\r\nthe parties to continue to live together without appearing before the\r\nclerk of the court.[128]\r\n\r\nAn interesting case[129] which arose under this Kentucky statute was as\r\nfollows: A Negro woman, an ex-slave and living as the wife of another\r\nex-slave, made her promissory note between the time of her emancipation\r\nand the date of this law. Under the provision of the statute, the man\r\nand woman appeared before the clerk of the court and obtained a marriage\r\ncertificate. Later, she was sued on the note and pleaded coverture. At\r\nthat time a married woman could not make a valid contract in her own\r\nname. The court held the plea bad, being of opinion that, as between the\r\nparties to the marriage, the statute validated their union from the\r\nbeginning, but as to third parties, the woman was still single and so\r\ncapable of making a valid contract.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, the same court[130] held that, if a Negro man and woman lived\r\ntogether while slaves as husband and wife, a customary marriage was\r\nestablished, the court saying in its opinion: “Since the passage of the\r\nAct of February, 1866, ... the general tendency of the decisions of this\r\ncourt has been to give that Act of 1866 a liberal construction with a\r\nview to effectuate its clearly defined purpose.” And a late statute[131]\r\nof 1898 further modified the law of 1866 by declaring that the children\r\nof above marriages might inherit property. If there was a subsequent\r\nmarriage and children born of it, the slave children shared with them\r\n_pro rata_.\r\n\r\nA statute of Louisiana,[132] in 1868, legalized all private or religious\r\nmarriages, provided that the parties, within two years, made a\r\ndeclaration of their marriage before a notary public or other competent\r\nofficer, giving the date of the marriage and the number and ages of the\r\nchildren. Though the statute did not mention Negroes, it must have been\r\npassed for their benefit.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the following case[133] came before the Louisiana court: A\r\nNegro’s parents, who had lived together as husband and wife, died before\r\nEmancipation. The majority of the court held that, if they had lived\r\ntill after Emancipation, their children would have been capable of\r\ninheriting their property, but, since they died before Emancipation,\r\ntheir marriage was never legalized, and their offspring could not so\r\ninherit. The dissenting opinion was that, since the slaves had done all\r\nthey could to be legally married, they should be recognized as married\r\nand their children should be legitimated.\r\n\r\nMaryland,[134] in 1867, confirmed and made valid all previous marriages\r\nbetween colored persons, but required them to prove before a justice of\r\nthe peace that they had been so married; and a certificate to that\r\neffect had to be filed with the clerk of the court. Thereafter, colored\r\npersons must secure licenses and be married in the same manner as white\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SLAVE MARRIAGES DECLARED LEGAL BY STATUTE\r\n\r\nThe last of the three methods of reconstructing the domestic relations\r\nof former slaves was by declaring slave marriages legal by statute. On\r\nSeptember 29, 1866, the Constitutional Convention of Alabama, which\r\nadopted an ordinance prohibiting slavery, also enacted[135] that all\r\nmarriages between freedmen and freedwomen, whether during slavery or\r\nafter, solemnized by one having or claiming to have the authority,\r\nshould be valid, if the parties were still living together. It was\r\nsubsequently held that, under this act, the woman had a right of dower,\r\nalthough the man had abandoned her and married another woman within a\r\nmonth after such act was passed.[136] In 1870, the Supreme Court of the\r\nState held that the children of slave marriages were not bastards, that\r\nby the elevation of their parents to citizenship, their heritable blood\r\nwas restored.[137]\r\n\r\nArkansas,[138] in 1866, legalized marriages of all persons of color who\r\nthen lived together as husband and wife and made their children\r\nlegitimate, but provided that thereafter all marriages of persons of\r\ncolor must be recorded. The same year Tennessee[139] passed a similar\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution[140] of Texas of 1869 declared that all persons should\r\nbe considered legally married who in slavery lived as husband and wife\r\nand after Emancipation either continued to live together till one died\r\nor were living together at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\r\nSuch a marriage completed by cohabitation after Emancipation was valid,\r\nthough the parties separated within five months and were not living\r\ntogether at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.[141]\r\n\r\nThe law of Virginia[142] provided that persons of color living as\r\nhusband and wife on February 27, 1866, whether or not any ceremony had\r\nbeen performed, should be considered as lawfully married and their\r\nchildren legitimate. If they had separated prior to that date the\r\nchildren of the woman, if recognized by the man to be his, were\r\nnevertheless legitimate. West Virginia[143] had practically the same\r\nlaw, except the latter clause about recognition by the father.\r\n\r\nIllinois,[144] as late as 1891, passed a statute to legalize slave\r\nmarriages and legitimate the children thereof. But this law did not\r\napply to a voidable slave marriage in another State, disaffirmed by a\r\nsubsequent legal marriage before the enactment of the statute.[145] A\r\nsimilar decision under a similar statute was rendered in Ohio[146] in\r\n1883. These decisions would indicate that a slave marriage was valid\r\nonly if there was no subsequent marriage of either party to a third\r\nperson. In 1876, New York[147] recognized as valid slave marriages\r\ncontracted in slave States with the consent of the master.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MARRIAGES BETWEEN SLAVES AND FREE NEGROES\r\n\r\nStatutes relative to marriages between free Negroes and slaves are not\r\nnumerous. Presumably, the term “persons of color” included both Negroes\r\nborn free and those who had been slaves. A Tennessee court,[148] in\r\n1882, held that the formal marriage of a free Negro and a slave, with\r\nthe consent of the master, followed by a cohabitation for years, was a\r\nvalid marriage and entitled the woman to dower.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FEDERAL LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States has had occasion to pass upon the\r\nvalidity of slave marriages only in connection with pensions to the\r\ndescendants of colored soldiers. An act[149] of 1873 provided that, in\r\ndetermining whether the widow of a Negro or Indian soldier and sailor is\r\nentitled to a pension, it is necessary only for the claimants to show\r\nthat she was married according to some ceremony, which she and the\r\ndeceased deemed obligatory, that they habitually recognized each other\r\nas husband and wife, and were so recognized by their neighbors, and that\r\nthey lived together up to the date of his enlistment. It was also\r\nprovided that the children of such marriages might claim their father’s\r\npension.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough they proceeded in different ways, practically all of the States\r\narrived at the same result. If slaves were married according to the\r\ncustom, if they lived as husband and wife both before and after\r\nEmancipation, their union was considered a valid marriage to all intents\r\nand purposes and the children thereof might inherit. Where the\r\nprocurement of a certificate or remarriage was required, if one of the\r\nparties took advantage of the opportunity to be freed from the early\r\nalliance, as happened in several amusing instances, and took another\r\nspouse, the second marriage was the valid one, and the children of the\r\nslave union could not inherit their parents’ property.\r\n\r\nIt scarcely needs to add that, at present, the marriage requirements as\r\nto license, age, etc., are in all States precisely the same both for\r\nwhite and colored people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Fla., 1865, p. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, 1866, p. 22.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Art.

The term “miscegenation” includes both\r\nintermarriage and all forms of illicit intercourse between the races.\r\nTwenty-six States and Territories, including all the Southern States,\r\nhave laws forbidding the admixture of the races; applying not only to\r\nNegroes, but also to Indians and Mongolians in States where the latter\r\nraces are present in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  INTERMARRIAGE DURING RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nIt is significant that during the years of Reconstruction in the South,\r\nwhen the Federal and State governments were endeavoring to eradicate\r\nrace distinctions, none of the statutes against miscegenation appear to\r\nhave been repealed. There is some meager authority—a case which arose in\r\nTennessee[150] in 1872, and two cases in North Carolina[151] in\r\n1877—which might tend to show that the statutes of two Southern States\r\nwere repealed. The Tennessee court was of opinion that intermarriage was\r\nnot prohibited in Mississippi, and the North Carolina courts arrived at\r\nthe same conclusion about South Carolina; but neither court specified\r\nthe years to which its statement applied, and a careful examination of\r\nthe annual laws of Mississippi and South Carolina between 1865 and 1880\r\nreveals no statutes repealing the laws against intermarriage in those\r\nStates. One is led to conclude, therefore, that the statutes against\r\nmiscegenation were disregarded in a few instances during Reconstruction,\r\nrather than repealed. This conclusion is helped out by the fact that the\r\nlegislatures manifested no inclination to permit miscegenation. The\r\nlegislature of South Carolina,[152] for instance, in 1865, before the\r\nState government went into the hands of the Reconstructionists, enacted\r\nlaws, covering twenty-five or more finely printed pages, defining the\r\nrights of Negroes in the most minute details, as was seen in considering\r\nthe “Black Laws” of 1865–68. These laws were repealed nine months later,\r\nbut the legislature was careful to add that the repealing act did not\r\napply to that part of the Act of 1865 which said that marriage between a\r\nwhite person and a person of color should be illegal and void. The\r\nlegislature of Texas,[153] in like manner, on November 10, 1866,\r\nrepealed most of its statutes relating to free Negroes, but added that\r\nnothing in the act should be construed to repeal any laws prohibiting\r\nintermarriage of the white and black races. The repealing statute of\r\nArkansas[154] of February 6, 1867, made practically the same exception\r\nas to intermarriage.\r\n\r\nDetermined as many of the Reconstruction promoters were to wipe out\r\nevery vestige of legally recognized race distinctions, they did not\r\nallow their zeal to carry them to the extent of legislating as to the\r\nsocial relations of the races. Georgia, probably fearing that some\r\nlegislature might attempt to enact such measures, in its Constitutions\r\nof 1868[155] and 1877[156] had this general statement: “The social\r\nstatus of the citizen shall never be the subject of legislation.” It\r\nwould seem, on first thought, that this requirement would defeat its own\r\npurpose. If marriage is a social status and if legislation as to the\r\nsocial status of the citizen is forever prohibited, how can a law\r\nprohibiting intermarriage be constitutional? In a test case[157] that\r\narose in 1869 the Supreme Court of the State very neatly explained away\r\nthis apparently embarrassing situation by saying, in effect, that the\r\nclause in the Constitution applied only to future legislation, and it\r\ndid not affect the law prohibiting intermarriage then in force. After\r\nquoting that clause in the Constitution, the court went on to say: “In\r\nso far as the marriage relation is connected with the social _status_,\r\nthe very reverse is true. That section of the Constitution forever\r\nprohibits legislation of any character regulating or interfering with\r\nthe social status. It leaves social rights and _status_ where it finds\r\nthem. It prohibits the legislature from repealing any laws in existence,\r\nwhich protect persons in the free regulation among themselves of matters\r\nproperly termed social, and it also prohibits the enactment of any new\r\nlaws on that subject in the future.” The Constitution of Alabama[9] of\r\n1901 provides against possible meddling by the legislature with domestic\r\nrelations in more outspoken terms: “The legislature shall never pass any\r\nlaw to authorize or legalize any marriage between any white person and a\r\nNegro or descendant of a Negro.”\r\n\r\n\r\n             PRESENT STATE OF THE LAW AGAINST INTERMARRIAGE\r\n\r\nThe present situation as regards intermarriage is as follows:\r\nIntermarriage between the Caucasian and other races is prohibited by the\r\nConstitutions of six States, all Southern, namely: Alabama,[158]\r\nFlorida,[159] Mississippi,[160] North Carolina,[161] South\r\nCarolina,[162] and Tennessee.[163] Intermarriage is prohibited by\r\nstatute also in the above States and in twenty other States and\r\nTerritories, namely: Alabama,[164] Arizona,[165] Arkansas,[166]\r\nCalifornia,[167] Colorado,[168] Delaware,[169] Florida,[170]\r\nGeorgia,[171] Idaho,[172] Indiana,[173] Kentucky,[174] Louisiana,[175]\r\nMaryland,[176] Mississippi,[177] Missouri,[178] Nebraska,[179]\r\nNevada,[180] North Carolina,[181] Oklahoma,[182] Oregon,[183] South\r\nCarolina,[184] Tennessee,[185] Texas,[186] Utah,[187] Virginia,[188] and\r\nWest Virginia.[189]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TO WHOM THE LAWS APPLY\r\n\r\nIn the interpretation of these statutes against intermarriage, it is\r\nnecessary, at the outset, to determine just who are included. If the\r\nstatutes had simply enacted that there should be no intermarriage\r\nbetween Caucasians, on the one side, and Negroes, Indians, or\r\nMongolians, on the other, they would have left the great body of\r\nmixed-blooded people to miscegenate as they pleased. Most of the States\r\navoided this difficulty by stating clearly to whom the laws apply.\r\nVirginia and Louisiana are the only States simply to enact in general\r\nterms that there shall be no intermarriage between white persons and\r\npersons of color; and even in Virginia judicial decisions clearly define\r\nthe term “person of color,” so there is no difficulty in knowing who is\r\nmeant by the statute. Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, and Kentucky\r\nprohibit intermarriage between white persons and Negroes or mulattoes.\r\nGeorgia, Texas, and Oklahoma place within the prohibition of their\r\nstatutes persons of African descent; West Virginia, Negroes; and\r\nFlorida, Negroes, expressly including every person with one-eighth or\r\nmore of Negro blood. Alabama makes its law apply to Negroes and their\r\ndescendants to the fifth generation, though one ancestor of each\r\ngeneration was white. The Indiana and Missouri statutes extend to all\r\npersons having one-eighth or more Negro blood; Maryland to Negroes or\r\npersons of Negro descent to the third generation inclusive. Tennessee\r\nincludes within the prohibition Negroes, mulattoes, or persons of mixed\r\nblood descended from a Negro to the third generation inclusive. The\r\nNebraska law applies to persons of one-fourth or more Negro blood.\r\n\r\nThe States which have a large Indian or Mongolian population include\r\nthese races within the prohibition. Thus, Arizona prohibits whites to\r\nintermarry with Negroes, Mongolians, or Indians and their descendants;\r\nCalifornia, with Negroes, Mongolians, or Indians and their descendants;\r\nCalifornia, with Negroes, Mongolians, or mulattoes. It is interesting to\r\nnote that the word “Mongolian” was not added to the California\r\nstatute[190] till 1905. This addition, coming, as it does, so nearly\r\ncontemporaneous with the school trouble in San Francisco, is evidence\r\nthat California is facing a race problem which it considers serious. The\r\nMississippi law applies to Negroes, mulattoes, persons who have\r\none-eighth or more Negro blood, Mongolians or persons who have\r\none-eighth or more Mongolian blood. Nevada includes black persons,\r\nmulattoes, Indians, Chinese; Oregon, in addition to Negroes, prohibits\r\nintermarriage with Chinese and with persons having one-fourth or more\r\nNegro, Chinese, or Kanaka blood or having more than one-half Indian\r\nblood. Utah includes simply Negroes and Mongolians; North Carolina,\r\nNegroes and Indians. South Carolina prohibits intermarriage between\r\nwhites and Indians, Negroes, mulattoes, mestizoes, or half-breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   EFFECT OF ATTEMPTED INTERMARRIAGE\r\n\r\nSuppose a white person and a person within any of the prohibited classes\r\ndo attempt to intermarry. What is the legal result? Indiana, Kentucky,\r\nMaryland, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Utah declare that such a\r\nmarriage is void; Colorado, Missouri, and Virginia, that it is\r\nabsolutely void; Arizona, Georgia, Oregon, and Tennessee, that it is\r\nnull and void; Delaware and Mississippi, that it is unlawful and void;\r\nand Arkansas, California, and Idaho, that it is illegal and void. The\r\nlaw of Florida declares that such a marriage is unlawful, utterly null\r\nand void and the issue bastards and so incapable of inheriting.\r\nLouisiana provides that such a marriage is prohibited, the celebration\r\nof it forbidden, that the celebration carries with it no effect, and\r\nthat the marriage is null and void. South Carolina enacts that it is\r\n“utterly null and void and of none effect.” The only legal effect of a\r\nmarriage thus declared void is to impose criminal liability upon the\r\nparties to it. The result is precisely the same as if no license had\r\nbeen obtained or ceremony performed and the parties had been indulging\r\nin illicit relations. A Virginia decision says: “No matter by what\r\nceremonies or solemnities, such marriage would have been the merest\r\nnullity, and the parties must have been regarded under our laws, as\r\nlewdly associating and cohabiting together....”[191]\r\n\r\nThe other States which prohibit intermarriage simply declare that\r\nmarriage between white persons and Negroes is illegal and prescribe a\r\npunishment for the violation of the statute against miscegenation, but\r\ndo not further define the legal effect of such a marriage contract. But\r\nwhether the marriage is declared “void” or “null and void” or\r\n“absolutely void” or only “illegal,” the result is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PUNISHMENT FOR INTERMARRIAGE\r\n\r\nPersons of different races who attempt to intermarry in violation of the\r\nlaws subject themselves everywhere to severe penalties. In Alabama, the\r\nlaw says they shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than\r\ntwo, nor more than seven years. In Colorado, they are guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor and punishable by a fine of from fifty dollars to five\r\nhundred dollars, or imprisonment for not less than three months nor more\r\nthan two years, or both. In Delaware, they are guilty of a misdemeanor\r\nand may be fined one hundred dollars. Florida says they shall be\r\nimprisoned in the State penitentiary not exceeding ten years or fined\r\nnot exceeding one thousand dollars. In Indiana, if they knowingly\r\nviolate the law—that is, if the white person knows the other is a Negro\r\nor of mixed blood—they are fined not less than one hundred dollars nor\r\nmore than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned in the State prison not\r\nless than one nor more than ten years. Maryland declares that they are\r\nguilty of an infamous crime, punishable by imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary not less than eighteen months nor more than ten years.\r\nMississippi makes the punishment a fine of five hundred dollars,\r\nimprisonment not exceeding ten years, or both. The law of Missouri\r\ndeclares that one who knowingly intermarries in violation of the statute\r\nshall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary two years or by a\r\nfine not less than one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county\r\njail not less than three months, or by both such fine and imprisonment,\r\nand adds that the jury shall determine the amount of Negro blood by\r\nappearance. Nevada enacts that the parties are guilty of a misdemeanor\r\nand shall be imprisoned in the State prison not less than one nor more\r\nthan two years. North Carolina brands an attempted intermarriage as an\r\ninfamous crime to be punished by imprisonment in the county jail or\r\nState prison not less than four months nor more than ten years, and the\r\nparties may also be fined at the discretion of the court. Oklahoma makes\r\nit a felony and provides that the parties shall be punished by a fine of\r\nnot less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or\r\nimprisonment not less than thirty days nor more than one year, or both.\r\nOregon simply makes it an offence punishable by imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary or county jail between three months and one year. South\r\nCarolina[192] declares attempted intermarriage is a misdemeanor\r\npunishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars or\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary from one to five years. Texas, by a law\r\nof 1858, still in force in 1879, prescribed a punishment for the white\r\nperson who attempted to marry a Negro but no punishment for the Negro. A\r\nFederal court[193] held that the difference of punishment was in\r\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment, but that the law against\r\nintermarriage was constitutional. Virginia provides that the parties\r\nshall be confined in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than\r\nfive years. West Virginia would confine them in jail not over one year\r\nand fine them not exceeding one hundred dollars. Thus, it appears that\r\nin most of the States intermarriage is considered a very serious\r\noffence, ranking in Colorado, Delaware, Nevada, and South Carolina, as a\r\nmisdemeanor; in Louisiana and North Carolina as an infamous crime; and\r\nin Tennessee and Oklahoma as a felony.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PUNISHMENT FOR ISSUING LICENSES\r\n\r\nWith no less severity do the States punish those who issue licenses to\r\npersons of one race to marry those of another. Alabama declares that\r\nanyone knowingly issuing a license for the marriage of a white and\r\ncolored person shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more\r\nthan one thousand dollars and may also be imprisoned in the county jail\r\nor sentenced to hard labor for the county for not more than six months.\r\nColorado makes it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of one hundred\r\ndollars. Florida punishes it by imprisonment not exceeding two years or\r\na fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. North Carolina simply\r\ndeclares it to be a misdemeanor without prescribing any punishment\r\ndifferent from that for other misdemeanors. Oklahoma makes it a\r\nmisdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more\r\nthan five hundred dollars, or imprisonment in the county jail not less\r\nthan thirty days nor more than one year, or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PUNISHMENT FOR PERFORMING THE CEREMONY\r\n\r\nA heavy penalty is laid also upon one who performs the ceremony for\r\nthose who marry in violation of the laws against miscegenation. Alabama\r\nprovides that any justice of the peace, minister, or other person, who\r\nknowingly performs the marriage ceremony between a white and colored\r\nperson, shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than\r\none thousand and, at the discretion of the court, imprisoned in the\r\ncountry jail or sentenced to hard labor for the county for not more than\r\nsix months. Arkansas makes anyone performing such a ceremony guilty of a\r\nhigh misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred\r\ndollars. Colorado declares that to perform the ceremony is a misdemeanor\r\npunishable by a fine of between fifty dollars and five hundred dollars\r\nor imprisonment between three months and two years, or both. In\r\nDelaware, it is a misdemeanor, and the punishment is a one hundred\r\ndollar fine. Florida either imprisons the person performing the ceremony\r\nnot over one year or imposes a fine on him not exceeding one thousand\r\ndollars. North Carolina simply defines it as a misdemeanor. Indiana\r\ndeclares that one who knowingly counsels or assists in such a marriage\r\nshall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one\r\nthousand dollars. Nevada makes one who performs the ceremony guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor and subjects him to imprisonment in the State prison not\r\nless than one year nor more than three years. Oklahoma makes it a\r\nmisdemeanor and imposes a fine of between one hundred dollars and five\r\nhundred dollars, or imprisonment between three months and a year, or\r\nboth. The law of Oregon declares that one who wilfully and knowingly\r\nperforms such marriage ceremony shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary\r\nor county jail from three months to one year and fined from one hundred\r\ndollars to one thousand dollars. South Carolina provides that one who\r\nknowingly and willingly unites persons of different races in the bonds\r\nof matrimony shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of\r\nnot less than five hundred dollars nor more than twelve months’\r\nimprisonment, or both. Virginia declares that he shall forfeit two\r\nhundred dollars, of which the informant shall get one-half; and West\r\nVirginia provides that the one who knowingly performs the ceremony shall\r\nbe guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not over two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COHABITATION WITHOUT INTERMARRIAGE\r\n\r\nA few States have statutes relative to illicit relations between white\r\nand colored persons, where no marriage is pretended to exist. Alabama\r\nimposes for this offence upon both man and woman the same punishment as\r\nfor intermarriage; a living together in adultery one day with intent to\r\ncontinue that relation has been held to constitute a violation of the\r\nstatute.[194] Florida declares that, if any white person and Negro or\r\nmulatto shall live together in adultery or fornication with each other,\r\neach shall be punished by imprisonment not exceeding a year, or by a\r\nfine not exceeding a thousand dollars. The law adds that any Negro man\r\nand white woman or any white man and Negro woman, not married to each\r\nother, who habitually live in and occupy in the night-time the same\r\nroom, no other person over fifteen years of age being present, shall be\r\npunished by imprisonment not exceeding twelve months, or by a fine not\r\nexceeding five hundred dollars. Nevada provides that, if any white\r\nperson shall live and cohabit with any black person, mulatto, Indian, or\r\nChinese, in a state of fornication, such person so offending shall be\r\nfined not over five hundred and not less than one hundred dollars, or\r\nimprisonment in the county jail between one and six months, or both.\r\nLouisiana[195] has the most recent and the most thorough-going statute\r\nagainst miscegenation; it was adopted July 1, 1908. It provides that\r\nconcubinage between a white person and a Negro is a felony, punishable\r\nby imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than one year.\r\nConcubinage is defined as unlawful cohabitation of white persons and\r\nNegroes whether open or secret. It was made the duty of the judges to\r\nspecially charge the grand juries upon this statute.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature about these statutes is that they impose a\r\nheavier penalty for cohabitation between a white and a colored person\r\nthan between two members of the same race. Yet they have been held to\r\ncomply with the Constitution of the United States. The reasons why such\r\nstatutes are held to be constitutional will be considered later.\r\n\r\n\r\n              STATES REPEALING LAWS AGAINST INTERMARRIAGE\r\n\r\nOnly five States that once had laws against miscegenation have repealed\r\nthem since 1865. New Mexico,[196] in 1866, Rhode Island,[197] in 1881,\r\nand Maine,[198] in 1883, repealed their laws against intermarriage\r\noutright. A statute of Michigan[199] in 1883 provided that all marriages\r\ntheretofore contracted between white persons and those wholly or in part\r\nof African descent should be valid and effectual and the offspring\r\nlegitimate, but it said nothing about marriages contracted in the\r\nfuture. Professor Frederick J. Stimson[200] has apparently interpreted\r\nthe statute to apply to marriages in the future as well as to those\r\nalready contracted. Finally, Ohio[201] in 1887 repealed its law of 1877,\r\nproviding for the punishment of persons of “pure white blood” who\r\nintermarry or have carnal intercourse with any Negro or person having a\r\ndistinct and visible admixture of African blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n          MARRIAGES BETWEEN THE NEGRO AND NON-CAUCASIAN RACES\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the States have not prohibited intermarriage\r\nbetween two different races except where one is the Caucasian. In no\r\nState is it unlawful for Mongolians and Indians, Negroes and Mongolians,\r\nor Negroes and Indians to intermarry. The only exception to the last is\r\nthat in North Carolina[202] it is unlawful for Negroes to intermarry\r\nwith Croatan Indians or to go to the same school with them. To this\r\nstatute hangs a beautiful historical tradition. In 1585, the date of the\r\nfirst attempt by Englishmen to colonize the New World, there was an\r\nisland off the coast of North Carolina called Croatoan. By the shifting\r\nof the sands, it is now probably a part of Hatteras or Ocracoke Island.\r\nIn 1587, a colony of one hundred and seventy-seven persons under John\r\nWhite was landed by Sir Walter Raleigh on this island. Here, the same\r\nyear, was born Virginia Dare, granddaughter of John White and the first\r\nchild of English parents born in America. Later, part of the colonists\r\nunder White had to go back to England to seek further aid. By agreement,\r\nthose left behind were to go over to the friendly Croatoan Indians if\r\nthey needed succor. When Governor White returned many months later, he\r\nfound the settlement deserted and carved upon a tree nearby the single\r\nword “Croatoan.” This supposedly meant that the colonists had gone over\r\nto the Croatoans. For some unexplained reason, the party under White\r\nnever went in search of their lost brethren. Not a word more has ever\r\nbeen heard of Virginia Dare and the others. A tradition says that they\r\nwent over to the Croatoans and eventually became absorbed into that\r\ntribe.[203] Credence is given to this by the fact that there are many\r\nCroatoan Indians—now called Croatans—with light complexion and blue\r\neyes. Recently a considerable body of mixed-blooded Indians in Robeson\r\nCounty, North Carolina, have laid claim to descent from this lost\r\ncolony, and the State has officially recognized them under a separate\r\nname as the “Croatan Indians.” Thus, all that is left of Virginia Dare\r\nand the Lost Colony is this tradition supported by the presence of\r\nIndians with fair skin and blue eyes, and the statute of North Carolina\r\nthat the blood of these early settlers shall not be further adulterated,\r\nby miscegenation, with the blood of the Negro.\r\n\r\n\r\n               EFFECT GIVEN TO MARRIAGES IN OTHER STATES\r\n\r\nThe next question is the interpretation of the laws against\r\nintermarriage. What effect will a State that prohibits miscegenation\r\ngive to a marriage between a white person and Negro in a State that\r\npermits intermarriage? What effect, for instance, will Virginia give to\r\na marriage of a white woman to a Negro man contracted in Massachusetts\r\nif the parties go to Virginia to live? If the Negro and white woman were\r\nresidents in good faith of Massachusetts or of some State that permits\r\nintermarriage at the time of their marriage, their marriage will, as a\r\ngeneral rule, be recognized as valid everywhere—even in the Southern\r\nStates. Several States, including Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana,\r\nKentucky, and probably others, in their statutes prohibiting\r\nintermarriage make the provision that, if the marriage is valid where\r\nconsummated, it will be considered valid by those States. A\r\nTennessee[204] court in 1872 did refuse to recognize as valid a marriage\r\ncelebrated in Mississippi when intermarriage was permitted in\r\nMississippi, but this appears to be the only case taking that view.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the parties leave a State which prohibits\r\nintermarriage and go to another State which allows it, solely for the\r\npurpose of evading the laws of the former State, the authority is\r\npractically unanimous that the marriage is not valid in the State the\r\nlaws of which they attempted to evade. This point is covered both by\r\nstatute and by judicial decision. A Delaware statute, for instance,\r\ndeclares that the Negro and white person are equally guilty if they are\r\nmarried in another State and move into Delaware as if they had been\r\nmarried in Delaware. Mississippi, also, punishes parties attempting to\r\nevade its laws by marrying out of the State and returning to\r\nMississippi, to the same extent as if they had attempted to intermarry\r\nin Mississippi. The Georgia statute, which is typical, is as follows:\r\n“All marriages solemnized in another State by parties intending at the\r\ntime to reside in this State shall have the same legal consequences and\r\neffect as if solemnized in this State. Parties residing in this State\r\ncannot evade any of the provisions of its laws as to marriage by going\r\ninto another State for the solemnization of the ceremony.” Statutes to\r\nthe same effect are in force in Arizona, Virginia, West Virginia, and\r\npossibly other States. In the absence of statute, the point is covered\r\nwith the same result by judicial decision. In the Tennessee case, to\r\nwhich reference has already been made, the court said: “Each State is\r\nsovereign, a government within, of, and for itself, with the inherent\r\nand reserved right to declare and maintain its own political economy for\r\nthe good of its citizens, and cannot be subjected to the recognition of\r\na fact or act contravening its public policy and against good morals, as\r\nlawful, because it was made or existed in a State having no prohibition\r\nagainst it or even promoting it.”\r\n\r\nIn 1878, a Negro man and a white woman went over from Virginia[205] into\r\nthe District of Columbia, were married, and returned to Virginia, where\r\nthey were prosecuted. The Virginia court held that, although the forms\r\nand ceremonies of marriage are governed by the laws of the place where\r\nmarriage is celebrated, the essentials of the contract depend upon and\r\nare governed by the laws of the country where the parties are domiciled\r\nat the time of the marriage, and in which the matrimonial residence is\r\ncontemplated. This case was affirmed by the Federal court[206] the next\r\nyear. A Georgia[207] couple who also went to the District of Columbia to\r\nbe married, returned to their native State, where they were indicted and\r\nconvicted for violating the Georgia statute against intermarriage.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Washington has been and is the City of Refuge for such\r\nmiscegenating couples. It has been held, however, in every case, that,\r\nwhen these people return to Southern States, no matter where married,\r\nthey are amenable to the laws of those States. In fact, there appears to\r\nbe only one American case with regard to Negroes which holds a contrary\r\ndoctrine, the case of Medway v. Needham.[208] There a white person and\r\nNegro, living in Massachusetts, which at the time, 1819, prohibited\r\nintermarriage, went to Rhode Island, where they were married and whence\r\nthey immediately returned. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that\r\na marriage, if valid where celebrated, is valid everywhere; the court\r\ntaking no account of the purpose of the parties to evade the law. In\r\nrendering this decision, the Court admitted that it was going counter to\r\nthe opinion of eminent jurists. The decision has not been followed, it\r\nappears, by any other court. It may be taken as settled that, if the\r\nparties leave the State for the purpose of evading its law, intending at\r\nthe time to return to that State, the marriage will not be recognized as\r\nvalid when they do return. But, if they leave the State to evade the\r\nlaw, not intending at the time to return and do gain a _bona fide_\r\nresidence in another State and, after that, do return, the marriage will\r\nbe recognized. In other words, to furnish a State grounds to declare\r\nvoid a marriage celebrated in another State where it is valid, the\r\nparties must intend not only to evade the law but also not to gain a\r\n_bona fide_ residence in the State to which they go.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been made to prohibit intermarriage in the District of\r\nColumbia. At the last session of the Sixtieth Congress, Senator Milton,\r\nof Florida, introduced a bill to make intermarriage between white\r\npersons and Negroes a crime punishable by imprisonment for ten years and\r\na fine of one thousand dollars, providing that one with one-eighth or\r\nmore Negro blood should come within the prohibition, declaring such\r\nmarriages to be null and void and the issue resulting from them\r\nillegitimate and so incapable of inheritance. This bill apparently died\r\nin the committee room. A resolution in the Senate to recall it from the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary was tabled on March 1, 1909, by a vote of 43\r\nto 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n               INTERMARRIAGE AND THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of State statutes and judicial decisions which\r\nhave refused to recognize marriages between Negroes and white persons\r\ncelebrated in other States or in the District of Columbia have been\r\nattacked on two grounds: First, that they are in violation of article\r\none, section ten, of the Constitution of the United States, which says,\r\nin part, that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts; and, secondly, that they contravene that part of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment which says that no State shall make or enforce any\r\nlaw which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nMarriage is declared by the statutes of the States which prohibit\r\nintermarriage, just as by other States, to be a civil contract. If it is\r\na contract and if marriage between a white person and a Negro in\r\nMassachusetts, for instance, is valid, when the parties go to South\r\nCarolina to live, how can the South Carolina courts declare the marriage\r\na nullity and prosecute the parties for fornication and adultery without\r\ncontravening the Federal Constitution? The only answer is: Marriage is a\r\ncivil contract, but it is something more. Almost without exception, the\r\ncourts have held that a State has the absolute control of the marriage\r\nstatus within its borders. The early case of State v. Gibson,[209]\r\ncoming in 1871 during Reconstruction, sounded a warning to the Federal\r\nGovernment’s interfering with the laws of marriage. The court said: “In\r\nthis State [Indiana] marriage is treated as a civil contract, but it is\r\nmore than a mere civil contract. It is a public institution established\r\nby God himself, is recognized in all Christian and civilized nations,\r\nand is essential to the peace, happiness, and well-being of society. In\r\nfact, society could not exist without the institution of marriage, for\r\nupon it all the social and domestic relations are based. The right of\r\nall the States to regulate and control, to guard, protect, and preserve\r\nthis God-given, civilizing, and Christianizing institution is of\r\ninestimable importance, and cannot be surrendered, nor can the States\r\nsuffer or permit any interference therewith. If the Federal Government\r\ncan determine who may marry in a State, there is no limit to its\r\npower....”\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Alabama[210] in 1872 declared that the laws against\r\nintermarriage did contravene the Civil Rights Bill and the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment. But this case was expressly overruled by Green v. State,[211]\r\nin which the court, answering both of the objections, said, “Marriage is\r\nnot a mere contract, but a social and domestic institution upon which\r\nare founded all society and order, to be regulated and controlled by the\r\nsovereign power for the good of the State; and the several States of the\r\nUnion in the adoption of the recent Amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States designed to secure to citizens rights of a civil or\r\npolitical nature only, and did not part with their hitherto unquestioned\r\npower of regulating, within their own borders, matters of purely social\r\nand domestic concern.”\r\n\r\nThere are Federal cases to support the position of the State Courts. But\r\nit is of no use to pile up citations of decisions further to establish\r\nthe well-accepted doctrine that marriage is more than a civil contract,\r\nthat it is a domestic institution, and that a State, by virtue of its\r\npolice power, has absolute control as to who may contract marriages or\r\nlive in that relation within its borders.[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-six States and Territories prohibit intermarriage between the\r\nwhite and other races. They recognize as valid such marriages when\r\ncontracted in a State which allows them, unless the parties are trying\r\nto evade the laws of the State of their domicile or of their intended\r\nmatrimonial residence. The States prescribe a heavier penalty for\r\nillicit intercourse between white persons and persons of another race\r\nthan for the same offence between two persons of the same race; they\r\ninflict heavy punishments upon ministers and other officials who perform\r\na marriage ceremony between a white person and one of another race, and\r\nupon those who issue licenses for such a marriage; and they declare the\r\noffspring of such marriages illegitimate and incapable of inheritance.\r\nIn each of these positions, the courts, Federal as well as State, have\r\nupheld the twenty-six States and Territories.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four States and Territories do not prohibit intermarriage between\r\nthe white and other races. It is not within the province of this study\r\nto consider the actual amount of admixture that is going on in these\r\nStates. But inasmuch as Boston has often been cited as the city in which\r\nthe number of marriages between white persons and Negroes is very large\r\n(estimated by Senator Money, of Mississippi, at 2,000 in 1902), the\r\nreport of the registry department of Boston for the years 1900–1907 is\r\nhere added:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INTERMARRIAGES IN BOSTON\r\n\r\n                      Colored man      White man    Total Number of\r\n                      White woman    Colored woman  Mixed Marriages\r\n         1900             32               3              35\r\n         1901             30               1              31\r\n         1902             25               4              29\r\n         1903             27               2              29\r\n         1904             27               1              28\r\n         1905             17               2              19\r\n         1906             17               2              19\r\n         1907             28               4              32\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that the number, never appreciably large, has been\r\nsteadily decreasing.\r\n\r\nThe following is what Mr. Ray Stannard Baker[213] has to say about the\r\nprecise fact of intermarriages in the Northern States in general: “In\r\nthe great majority of intermarriages the white women belong to the lower\r\nwalks of life. They are German, Irish, or other foreign women,\r\nrespectable but ignorant. As far as I can see from investigating a\r\nnumber of such cases, the home life is as happy as that of other people\r\nin the same stratum of life. But the white woman who marries a Negro is\r\nspeedily declassed: she is ostracised by the white people, and while she\r\nfinds a certain place among the Negroes, she is not even readily\r\naccepted as a Negro. In short, she is cut off from both races. When I\r\nwas at Xenia, O., I was told of a case of a white man who was arrested\r\nfor living with a Negro woman. The magistrate compelled him to marry the\r\nNegro woman as the worst punishment he could invent.\r\n\r\n“For this reason, although there are no laws in most Northern States\r\nagainst mixed marriages, and although the Negro population has been\r\nincreasing, the number of intermarriages is not only not increasing, but\r\nin many cities, as in Boston, it is decreasing. It is an unpopular\r\ninstitution.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  State v. Bell, 1872, 7 Baxter (Tenn.) 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  State v.

The latter\r\ndate marked the Negro’s final freedom from physical bondage. His body\r\ncould no longer be owned as chattel property. But there is a vast\r\ndifference between being able to say “No man owns my body,” and “I have\r\nthe same rights, privileges, and immunities as other free men.” This\r\ndifference the Thirty-ninth Congress—that of 1865–1866—fully realized,\r\nand grappled with.\r\n\r\nThe first ten Amendments were passed soon after the adoption of the\r\nConstitution to satisfy the demands of those who were jealous of the\r\npower of the Federal government. These, in brief, guaranteed to the\r\ncitizens of the United States (1) freedom of religion, speech, press,\r\nassembly, and of petition for redress of grievances; (2) the right to\r\nkeep and bear arms; (3) the right not to have soldiers quartered in\r\none’s house in time of peace without one’s consent; (4) freedom from\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures; (5) the right not to be denied life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law; (6) the right to trial\r\nby jury; (7) the right of the accused to be confronted by his accuser;\r\n(8) the right not to have one’s property taken for public use without\r\ncompensation; and (9) the right not to be subjected to cruel or unusual\r\npunishment, and not to have excessive bail required. These were\r\nlimitations upon the power of Congress, the States themselves having\r\nguaranteed such rights to their own citizens by their bill of rights.\r\nAfter the War, the Federal government was fearful that the States,\r\nparticularly those lately in rebellion, would not grant these rights or\r\nprivileges to the freedmen, who, according to the Dred Scott decision,\r\nwere not citizens. All the power that Congress had over the States, it\r\nseems, was to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment by appropriation\r\nlegislation. But it proceeded to make the most of the power it had,\r\nbiding its time when another amendment to the Constitution would give it\r\nmore power over the States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by Congress, under the power supposedly arising out\r\nof the Thirteenth Amendment, was an attempt to secure to the Negro his\r\nso-called “civil rights.” Unfortunately, there seems to be no succinct\r\ndefinition of this term. Bouvier[214] defines the phrase thus: “A term\r\napplied to certain rights secured to citizens of the United States by\r\nthe Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution and by\r\nvarious acts of Congress made in pursuance thereof.” This definition,\r\nhowever, helps little, and one is thrown back upon the Amendments and\r\nsubsidiary enactments themselves to work out from them what are the\r\ncivil rights of a citizen and of the Negro in particular.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and fall of 1865, between the close of the War and the\r\nconvening of Congress, there had developed on the part of the radical\r\nelement of the Republican party under Thaddeus Stevens an opposition to\r\nPresident Johnson’s Reconstruction plans. The first Civil Rights Bill\r\npassed the Senate on February 2, 1866, passed the House a few days\r\nlater, but on March 27, was returned with the veto of the President. It\r\nwas passed, however, over his veto on April 9, 1866, and was thereafter\r\nknown as the Civil Rights Bill[215] of 1866. The first section reads:\r\n“All persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign\r\npower, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens\r\nof the United States; and such citizens, of every race and color,\r\nwithout regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have\r\nbeen duly convicted, shall have the same right, in every State and\r\nTerritory in the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue,\r\nbe parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold,\r\nand convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefits of\r\nall laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is\r\nenjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishments,\r\npains, and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance,\r\nregulation, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the first phrase was intended to contravene the Dred\r\nScott decision and to establish the Negro’s citizenship. While the Bill\r\nwas before Congress, the great subject of debate was as to just what\r\nrights would be given thereby to the Negro. Some opposed it because they\r\nthought it would give him the right of suffrage, the right to intermarry\r\nwith whites, to attend the same schools and churches, to sit on juries,\r\nand to testify in courts. It must be remembered that the “Black Laws” of\r\nthe free States were still in force, and the Congressmen from those\r\nStates were as jealous of Federal interference on the subject as those\r\nfrom the Southern States.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose here to discuss the Civil Rights Bill as it was\r\nregarded by the people, but rather as it was interpreted by the courts.\r\nAlthough it stood scarcely more than two years before it was eclipsed\r\nand practically superseded by the Fourteenth Amendment, nevertheless it\r\nstood long enough to be tested by the courts.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes, prompted in some instances probably by white persons,\r\nundertook immediately to see what rights were really secured to them by\r\nthe Bill. In Tennessee and Mississippi, in 1866, convictions were had\r\nunder the existing State laws against intermarriage, as there had\r\npreviously been. Appeal to the Federal Supreme Court was talked of, but\r\nnothing came of it. With a view to testing their rights, Negroes in New\r\nYork demanded sleeper accommodations on railroads, and went to\r\nfashionable restaurants and demanded the right to sit with the white\r\npatrons, but in both instances were refused. In Baltimore they sought\r\naccommodations on street cars, in theatres, saloons, etc. with whites,\r\nbut were met with the same refusal.[216]\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the Bill was denied in 1867 by the Court of\r\nAppeals of Kentucky,[217] on the ground that it invaded the right of the\r\nState to regulate its own domestic concerns. But its constitutionality\r\nwas upheld in two cases: United States v. Rhodes,[218] 1866, in the\r\nCircuit Court, a case involving the right of a Negro to testify, and _In\r\nre_ Turner,[219] in the Circuit Court also, a Maryland case involving\r\nthe laws of apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIt appears that none of the cases involving the rights of Negroes in\r\npublic places, which are being considered particularly in this chapter,\r\nreached the higher courts. But Mr. Flack[220] says: “The instances we\r\nhave cited, however, are apparently sufficient to justify the conclusion\r\nthat the belief prevailed generally—north, east, west and\r\nsouth—especially among the Negroes, that the Civil Rights Bill gave the\r\ncolored people the same rights and privileges as white men as regards\r\ntravel, schools, theatres, churches, and the ordinary rights which may\r\nbe legally demanded. There also seems to have been a less general belief\r\nthat it also permitted the intermarriage of the races.”\r\n\r\nAs interesting as it would be to trace this Bill and the subsequent\r\nFederal enactments through Congress, it would take one too far afield.\r\nHe must accept the products as they came from the crucible of debate,\r\nand interpret their effect upon the rights of Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Bill of 1866 was practically superseded by the first\r\nsection of the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified by thirty-six States and\r\ndeclared operative July 28, 1868. This section reads as follows: “All\r\npersons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State\r\nwherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall\r\nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;\r\nnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\r\nwithout due process of law, or deny to any person within its\r\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”\r\n\r\nMr. Flack[221] says that the purpose in the adoption of this Amendment\r\nwas (1) to make the Bill of Rights (the first eight Amendments) binding\r\nupon the States as well as upon the Nation; (2) to give validity to the\r\nCivil Rights Bill of 1866; and (3) to declare who were citizens of the\r\nUnited States. As he shows by an analysis of the debates in Congress,\r\nthe constitutionality of the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 was doubted by\r\nmany of its able advocates, and it was natural that they should desire\r\nto make their tenets secure by incorporating them into the Constitution\r\nitself. It is worth remarking that on May 1, 1870, the Civil Rights Bill\r\nof 1866 was practically re-enacted.[222]\r\n\r\nThe words “Negro,” “race,” or “color” do not appear in the first section\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment; but a study of the speeches before the\r\nHouse and Senate would show that the legislators had the Negro primarily\r\nin mind, and so the court understood. In the Slaughter-House Cases[223]\r\nof 1872, cases not having to do with the Negro in the slightest degree,\r\nMr. Justice Miller gave an interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nwhich has stood as a landmark. He said: “... on the most casual\r\nexamination of the language of these Amendments [Thirteenth, Fourteenth,\r\nand Fifteenth], no one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading\r\npurpose found in them all, laying at the foundation of each, and without\r\nwhich none of them would have been even suggested; we mean the freedom\r\nof the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom,\r\nand the protection of the newly-made freeman and citizen from the\r\noppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over\r\nhim. It is true that only the Fifteenth Amendment, in terms, mentions\r\nthe Negro by speaking of his color and his slavery. But it is just as\r\ntrue that each of the other articles were addressed to the grievances of\r\nthat race, and designed to remedy them as the Fifteenth. We do not say\r\nthat no one else but the Negro can share in their protection.... But we\r\ndo say ... that in any fair and just construction of any section or\r\nphrase of these Amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which\r\nwe have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they\r\nwere designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the\r\nConstitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far\r\nas constitutional law can accomplish it.” Without further citation of\r\nauthorities, it may be assumed that the primary purpose of Congress in\r\ndrafting the Fourteenth Amendment was to secure and protect the rights\r\nand privileges of Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe next Federal legislation on the subject was the Civil Rights\r\nBill[224] of 1875, which declared that all persons within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States should be entitled to the full and\r\nequal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and\r\nprivileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, theatres and\r\nother places of public amusement, subject only to the conditions\r\nestablished by law and applicable alike to citizens of every race and\r\ncolor, regardless of any previous condition of servitude. The penalty\r\nfor the violation of this law was the forfeiture of five hundred dollars\r\nto the person aggrieved and a fine of not less than five hundred dollars\r\nnor more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment not less than three\r\nmonths nor more than one year. The District and Circuit Courts of the\r\nUnited States were given exclusive jurisdiction of offences against this\r\nstatute. District attorneys, marshals, and deputy marshals of the United\r\nStates, and commissioners appointed by the Federal courts were\r\nauthorized to proceed against those violating the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nThe years between 1865 and 1875 had witnessed changes in the attitude of\r\nCongress toward the civil rights of Negroes. The Bill of 1866 was\r\ngeneral in its terms, yet Congress did not feel secure till the\r\nFourteenth Amendment had been passed to give validity, in a sense, to\r\nwhat had already been done. Now in 1875 Congress passed a bill which far\r\nsurpassed in scope anything that had theretofore been undertaken. It is\r\nsurprising that the test case of its constitutionality did not reach the\r\ncourt of last resort before 1883. During the year of its passage, 1875,\r\ndoubt was thrown upon its validity by Judge Dick in charging the grand\r\njury of the Federal Circuit Court of North Carolina,[225] who said, in\r\npart: “Every man has a natural and inherent right of selecting his own\r\nassociates, and this natural right cannot be properly regulated by\r\nlegislative action, but must always be under the control of the\r\nindividual taste or inclination.” The same year, Judge Emmons, of the\r\nCircuit Court in Tennessee,[226] ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment\r\napplied to State and not individual action, and that the Federal\r\ngovernment could not require individual innkeepers, theatre managers,\r\netc., to entertain Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the Civil Rights Bill of 1875, however, was\r\nfinally settled in 1883. That year five cases[227] reached the Supreme\r\nCourt, all of which had to do with the civil rights of Negroes. Two of\r\nthem concerned the rights of colored persons in inns and hotels; two,\r\ntheir rights in theatres; and one, in railroad cars. Mr. Justice\r\nBradley, delivering the opinion of the court, took the ground that the\r\nfirst and second sections of the Civil Rights Bill were unconstitutional\r\nfor these reasons: (1) They are not authorized by the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment, abolishing and prohibiting slavery, because the separation of\r\nthe races in public places is not a badge of servitude. “It would be\r\nrunning the slavery argument into the ground,” he said, “to make it\r\napply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make\r\nas to the guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take\r\ninto his coach, or cab, or car, or admit to his concert or theatre, or\r\ndeal with in other matters of intercourse or business.” (2) The Civil\r\nRights Bill is not authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment, because that\r\nrefers to action by the State, while the Bill refers to individual\r\ndiscrimination. It is State action of a particular kind that is\r\nprohibited. “Individual invasion of individual rights,” he argued, “is\r\nnot the subject matter of the amendment.... It nullifies and makes void\r\nall State legislation, and State action of every kind, which impairs the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.... It does\r\nnot invest Congress with power to legislate upon subjects which are\r\nwithin the domain of State legislation; but to provide modes of relief\r\nagainst State legislation or State action.... It does not authorize\r\nCongress to create a code of municipal laws for the regulation of\r\nprivate rights, but to provide modes of redress against the operation of\r\nState laws, and the action of State officers, executive or judicial,\r\nwhen these are subversive of the fundamental rights specified in the\r\nAmendment ... until some State law has been passed, or some State action\r\nthrough its officers or agents has been taken, adverse to the rights of\r\ncitizens sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, no\r\nlegislation of the United States under said Amendment, nor any\r\nproceeding under such legislation, can be called into activity; for the\r\nprohibitions of the Amendment are against State laws and acts done under\r\nState authority.”\r\n\r\nThe effect of this decision is that the Federal government cannot\r\nprevent the curtailment of the civil rights of Negroes by individuals\r\nunless such individuals are acting under sanction of State statutes, and\r\nin that case, the Federal court can only declare that the State statute\r\nis unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n\r\n                STATE LEGISLATION BETWEEN 1865 AND 1883\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Bill of 1875 was the last effort of Congress to\r\nguarantee to Negroes their civil rights. It is well now to turn back in\r\npoint of time, and trace the action of the State legislatures on the\r\nsubject. It has been deemed advisable to let the year 1883 be the\r\ndividing point in the history of the latter legislation. Before that\r\ntime the States were moving in conjunction with the Nation; after, the\r\nimpotence of the Nation having been declared by its Supreme Court, the\r\nburden of defining and securing civil rights to Negroes devolved upon\r\nthe States. Moreover, it is well to treat the Southern States and the\r\nStates outside the South separately, because of the abnormal conditions\r\nin the former occasioned by Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _In States Outside of South_\r\n\r\nBetween 1865 and 1883 there was comparatively little legislation in the\r\nNorthern, Eastern, and Western States as to civil rights. This was\r\nnaturally so because these States were waiting to see what the Federal\r\ngovernment meant to do. A brief examination of what little legislation\r\nthere was will be made.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1865, Massachusetts[228] declared that there should be no\r\ndistinction, discrimination, or restriction on account of color or race\r\nin any licensed inn, public place of amusement, public conveyance, or\r\npublic meeting, and imposed a fine of fifty dollars for the violation of\r\nthis law. The next year it included theatres[229] within the\r\nprohibition, but weakened the force of the statute by saying that there\r\nshould be no exclusion or restriction “except for good cause.”\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Delaware[230] toward civil rights is probably the most\r\ninteresting of any of the Northern States. On April 11, 1873, its\r\nlegislature passed the following “joint resolution in opposition to\r\nmaking Negroes the equals of white men, politically or socially”:\r\n\r\n“That the members of this General Assembly, for the people they\r\nrepresent, and for themselves, jointly and individually, do hereby\r\ndeclare uncompromising opposition to a proposed act of Congress,\r\nintroduced by Hon. Charles Sumner at the last session, and now on file\r\nin the Senate of the United States, known as the ‘Supplemental Civil\r\nRights Bill,’ and all other measures intended or calculated to equalize\r\nor amalgamate the Negro race with the white race, politically or\r\nsocially, and especially do they proclaim unceasing opposition to making\r\nNegroes eligible to public offices, to sit on juries, and to their\r\nadmission into public schools where white children attend, and to the\r\nadmission on terms of equality with white people in the churches, public\r\nconveyances, places of amusement, or hotels, and to any measure designed\r\nor having the effect to promote the equality of the Negro with the white\r\nman in any of the relations of life, or which may possibly conduce to\r\nsuch result.\r\n\r\n“That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and our Representatives\r\nrequested to vote against and use all honorable means to defeat the\r\npassage by Congress of the bill referred to in the foregoing resolution,\r\nknown as the ‘Supplemental Civil Rights Bill,’ and all other measures of\r\na kindred nature, and any and every attempt to make the Negro the peer\r\nof the white man.”\r\n\r\nUpon the heels of this resolution, in 1875, Delaware[231] enacted a\r\nstatute on March 15, 1875, which provided that no keeper of an inn,\r\ntavern, hotel, or restaurant, or other place of public entertainment or\r\nrefreshment of travelers, guests, or customers, should be obliged by law\r\nto furnish entertainment or refreshment to persons whose reception or\r\nentertainment by him would be offensive to the major part of his\r\ncustomers, or would injure his business. The term “customers” was taken\r\nto include all who sought entertainment or refreshment. The proprietor\r\nof a theatre or other public place of amusement was not obliged to\r\nreceive into his show, or admit into the place where he was pursuing his\r\noccupation, any person whose presence there would be offensive to the\r\nmajor part of his spectators or patrons, and thereby injure his\r\nbusiness. Any carrier of passengers might make such arrangements in his\r\nbusiness as would, if necessary, assign a particular place in his cars,\r\ncarriages, or boats, to such of his customers as he might choose to\r\nplace there, and whose presence elsewhere would be offensive to the\r\nmajor part of the traveling public, where his business was conducted;\r\nbut the accommodations must be equal if the same price for carriage was\r\nrequired of all. This is still the law in Delaware. Taken in connection\r\nwith the joint resolution above, there is little doubt that the\r\nlegislature intended to make possible the drawing of a color line,\r\nthough it did not expressly say so. It is noteworthy that, during the\r\nstormy years of Reconstruction, some case testing its constitutionality\r\ndid not arise. Only one other State has had a statute anything like the\r\nDelaware law, and that is Tennessee, which statute and, with it,\r\napparently the only case involving the constitutionality of the law that\r\nhas reached the courts will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nA Kansas[232] statute of April 25, 1874, which is still law, provided\r\nthat there should be no distinction on account of race, color, or\r\nprevious condition of servitude in any State university, college, or\r\nother school of public instruction, or in any licensed inn, hotel,\r\nboarding house, or any place of public entertainment or amusement, or\r\nany steamboat, railroad, stage coach, omnibus, street car, or any other\r\nmeans of public carriage for persons or freight, under penalty of a fine\r\nof from ten to one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nNew York,[233] on April 9, 1874, passed a Civil Rights Bill which\r\nprohibited race distinctions in inns, public conveyances on land and\r\nwater, theatres, other public places of amusements, common schools,\r\npublic institutions of learning, and cemeteries. It further declared\r\nthat the discrimination against a citizen on account of color, by the\r\nuse of the word “white,” or any other term, in any law, statute,\r\nordinance, or regulation, should be repealed. In 1881, it specifically\r\nmentioned hotels, inns, taverns, restaurants, public conveyances,\r\ntheatres, and other places of public resort or amusement.[234]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _In South_\r\n\r\nOne would naturally expect that most of the legislation in the South\r\nguaranteeing civil rights to Negroes would have come during the period\r\nthat their governments were in the hands of the Reconstructionists, and\r\nsuch is the case.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 a Florida[235] statute made it a misdemeanor for a person of\r\ncolor to intrude himself into any religious or other public assembly of\r\nwhite persons, or into a railroad car or other public vehicle set apart\r\nfor the exclusive accommodation of white people, or for a white person\r\nso to intrude upon the accommodations of colored persons. By 1873,\r\nhowever, the political revolution had come, and a statute[236] of that\r\nyear forbade discrimination on account of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition of servitude, in the full and equal enjoyment of the\r\naccommodations, etc., of inns, public conveyances on land and water,\r\nlicensed theatres, other places of public amusement, common schools,\r\npublic institutions of learning, cemeteries, and benevolent associations\r\nsupported by general taxation. This prohibition did not apply to private\r\nschools or cemeteries established exclusively for white or colored\r\npersons. It added, as did the law of New York, that there should be no\r\ndiscrimination in any laws by using the word “white.”\r\n\r\nA statute of Louisiana[237] in 1869 prohibited any discrimination on\r\naccount of race or color by common carriers, innkeepers, hotel keepers,\r\nor keepers of public resorts. The license of such places had to contain\r\nthe stipulation that they must be open to all without distinction or\r\ndiscrimination on account of color. The penalty was forfeiture of the\r\nlicense and a suit for damages by the party aggrieved. This statute[238]\r\nwas strengthened in 1873 by the further provision that all persons,\r\nwithout regard to race or color, must have “equal and impartial\r\naccommodations” on public conveyances, in inns and other places of\r\npublic resort. It was the duty of the attorney-general to bring suit in\r\nthe name of the State to take away the license of anyone violating the\r\nlaw. The statute imposed a fine upon common carriers running from other\r\nStates into Louisiana who made any discrimination against citizens of\r\nthe latter on account of race or color.\r\n\r\nArkansas,[239] in 1873, required the same accommodations to be furnished\r\nto all by common carriers, keepers of public houses of entertainment,\r\ninns, hotels, restaurants, saloons, groceries, dramshops, or other\r\nplaces where liquor was sold, public schools, and benevolent\r\ninstitutions supported in whole or partly by general taxation.\r\n\r\nThe law of Tennessee[240] of 1875 is in a very different tone, it being\r\nvery much like, as has been said before, that of Delaware. That statute\r\nreads: “The rule of the common law giving a right of action to any\r\nperson excluded from any hotel, or public means of transportation, or\r\nplace of amusement, is hereby abrogated; and hereafter no keeper of any\r\nhotel, or public house, or carrier of passengers for hire, or\r\nconductors, drivers, or employees of such carrier or keeper, shall be\r\nbound, or under any obligation to entertain, carry, or admit any person,\r\nwhom he shall for any reason whatever, choose not to entertain, carry,\r\nor admit, to his house, hotel, carriage, or means of transportation or\r\nplace of amusement; nor shall any right exist in favor of any such\r\nperson so refused admission, but the right of such keepers of hotels and\r\npublic houses, carriers of passengers, and keepers of places of\r\namusement and their employees to control the access and admission or\r\nexclusion of persons to or from their public houses, means of\r\ntransportation, and places of amusement, shall be as perfect and\r\ncomplete as that of any person over his private house, carriage, or\r\nprivate theatre, or place of amusement for his family.” This Tennessee\r\nlaw is even more sweeping than that of Delaware. In the latter, common\r\ncarriers may provide separate accommodations for persons that would be\r\ndisagreeable to the major portion of the traveling public; in the\r\nformer, the common carrier might exclude such persons altogether.\r\nAccording to the Tennessee statute, every railroad company in the State\r\nhad a right to refuse absolutely to carry Negroes on its cars. Of\r\ncourse, this has been changed by its “Jim Crow” laws. The case of State\r\nv. Lasater,[241] dealing with the second section of the Tennessee\r\nstatute, has the following to say about the whole enactment: “This is an\r\nextraordinary statute. It is generally understood to have been passed to\r\navoid the supposed effects of an act of Congress on the same subject,\r\nknown as the Civil Rights Bill.”\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the Tennessee and Delaware statutes has not\r\nbeen tested, as far as is known. Therefore, in the absence of authority,\r\nan opinion on the matter is of little value, but the following\r\nsuggestion is ventured: Originally, hotels and inns were no more public\r\nplaces than a man’s dwelling, and one could choose his patrons just as\r\nhe could choose the guests he would entertain, and might exclude anyone\r\nwithout giving his reasons for it, as a merchant might refuse to sell\r\ngoods to anyone he chose. For historical reasons, which need not be\r\ndiscussed here, the courts held that an inn-keeper should not be allowed\r\nto refuse an applicant for entertainment unless he had some valid reason\r\nfor it. The common law thereafter considered hotels, etc., public\r\nplaces. It has been seen that the Civil Rights Cases held that the\r\nFederal government cannot prohibit a hotel-keeper from refusing to\r\nreceive an applicant, but that the regulation of such domestic relations\r\nis within the exclusive control of the State. If the State sees fit to\r\npass a statute abrogating the common law, as Tennessee and Delaware did,\r\nand making hotels, etc., private places, as they were originally, there\r\nseems to be no valid constitutional objection. The reasoning that\r\napplies to hotels will apply to other places now considered public,\r\npossibly even to public conveyances.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution of the legislature of North Carolina[242] of\r\n1877 is worth quoting in full. It is especially significant because it\r\nwas passed after the Reconstruction régime was over, and the State\r\ngovernment had passed back into hands of the Democratic party, with\r\nZebulon B. Vance as Governor.\r\n\r\n“_Whereas_, In the providence of God, the colored people have been set\r\nfree, and this is their country and their home, as well as that of the\r\nwhite people, and there should be nothing to prevent the two races from\r\ndwelling together in the land in harmony and peace;\r\n\r\n“_Whereas_, We recognize the duty of the stronger race to uphold the\r\nweaker, and that upon it rests the responsibility of an honest and\r\nfaithful endeavor to raise the weaker race to the level of intelligent\r\ncitizenship; and\r\n\r\n“_Whereas_, The colored people have been erroneously taught that\r\nlegislation under Democratic auspices would be inimical to their rights\r\nand interests, thereby causing a number of them to entertain honest\r\nfears in the premises,\r\n\r\n“The General Assembly of North Carolina do resolve, That, while we\r\nregard with repugnance the absurd attempts, by means of ‘Civil Rights’\r\nBills, to eradicate certain race distinctions, implanted by nature and\r\nsustained by the habits of forty centuries; and while we are sure that\r\ngood government demands for both races alike that the great\r\nrepresentation and executive offices of the country should be\r\nadministered by men of the highest intelligence and best experience in\r\npublic affairs, we do, nevertheless, heartily accord alike to every\r\ncitizen, without distinction of race or color, equality before the law.\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That we recognize the full purport and intent of that\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States which confers the\r\nright of suffrage and citizenship upon the people of color, and that\r\npart of the Constitution of North Carolina conferring educational\r\nprivileges upon both races: that we are disposed and determined to carry\r\nout in good faith these as all other constitutional provisions.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      STATE LEGISLATION AFTER 1883\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _In South_\r\n\r\nThe civil rights legislation in the South after 1883 may be shortly\r\ndisposed of, for an examination of the session laws of the Southern\r\nStates since that time reveals only one statute that can at all properly\r\nbe called a Civil Rights Bill. That was a statute of Tennessee[243] of\r\nMarch 25, 1885, providing against discrimination in theatres, shows,\r\nparks, places of public resort for observation of scenery or amusement\r\nof any kind whatever, where fee or toll is charged. But it adds this\r\nsignificant section: “That nothing herein contained shall be construed\r\nas interfering with the existing rights to provide separate\r\naccommodations and seats for colored and white persons at such places.”\r\nIt may be taken for granted that the Civil Rights Bills passed in the\r\nSouth by the Reconstruction administrations became inoperative, if they\r\nwere not actually repealed, as soon as the government reverted to the\r\nhands of the resident white people. Of course, all the Southern\r\nlegislation as to separate schools and separate accommodations in public\r\nconveyances relates to the civil rights of Negroes, and most of this has\r\ncome since 1883, but the discussion of these two important subjects is\r\npostponed to later chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _In States Outside of South_\r\n\r\nThe Federal Civil Rights Bill, as has been seen, was declared\r\nunconstitutional in 1883, and the national government was thereby\r\ndeclared impotent to secure for Negroes equality of accommodations in\r\npublic places. Thus the burden, as has been said before, was thrown upon\r\nthe States. Many of the States outside the South responded by adopting\r\nbills which practically copied the Civil Rights Bill of 1875. The\r\nfollowing is a list of the States that have such Civil Rights Bills with\r\nthe dates of their adoption and amendments: Connecticut,[244] 1884 and\r\n1905; Iowa,[245] 1884 and 1892; New Jersey,[246] 1884; Ohio,[247] 1884\r\nand 1894; Colorado,[248] 1885 and 1895; Illinois,[249] 1885;\r\nIndiana,[250] 1885; Massachusetts,[251] 1885, 1893, and 1895;\r\nMichigan,[252] 1885; Minnesota,[253] 1885, 1897, and 1899;\r\nNebraska,[254] 1885 and 1893; Rhode Island,[255] 1885; New York,[256]\r\n1893 and 1895; Pennsylvania,[257] 1887; Washington,[258] 1890;\r\nWisconsin,[259] 1895; and California,[260] 1897. The Kansas[261] bill\r\nhas already been considered.\r\n\r\nA clearer idea of what the various State statutes mean and how they\r\ndiffer from the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 may be got from the\r\naccompanying table. The list contains the names of places where all\r\ncitizens, without regard to race, color, or previous condition of\r\nservitude are guaranteed equality of accommodation. It will be noticed\r\nthat none of the Southern States have Civil Rights Bills and, therefore,\r\ndepend upon the courts to determine the rights of citizens in public\r\nplaces, and in addition the following States have no such statute:\r\nDelaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New\r\nHampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West\r\nVirginia, and Wyoming.\r\n\r\n                ANALYSIS OF THE STATE CIVIL RIGHTS BILLS\r\n\r\n ───────────────┬──────────┬────────┬───────────┬────────┬───────┬────\r\n                │          │        │

Each provides\r\nthat all citizens within the jurisdiction of the State, without regard\r\nto race, color, or previous condition of servitude, are entitled to the\r\nfull and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of\r\nthe various places mentioned. The offending party may be either indicted\r\nand fined or imprisoned, or he may be sued by the aggrieved party. In\r\nsome States, an action by the State is a bar to an action by the party\r\nand vice versa. One who aids or abets in a discrimination against a\r\nperson on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude is\r\npunished to the same extent as the one actually committing the act.\r\n\r\nHeretofore only legislative enactments, State and Federal, as to the\r\ncivil rights of Negroes have been considered. It is well now to turn to\r\nthe courts to see how the laws have been interpreted as regards various\r\npublic places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HOTELS\r\n\r\nOnly six States expressly forbid race distinctions in hotels. But it may\r\nbe assumed that the sixteen States which mention inns mean to include\r\nhotels.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 a Negro minister applied for a room at a Philadelphia hotel and\r\nwas refused accommodation, though one of the guests offered to share his\r\nroom with him. At that time there was no law in Pennsylvania requiring\r\nhotel-keepers to receive colored persons; but the Federal court[262]\r\nheld that the clerk might be liable under the Federal Civil Rights Bill\r\nof 1875.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 one Russ applied for a license to open a hotel in Pennsylvania.\r\nIn granting it, the court[263] took the occasion to express its view on\r\nrace distinctions in the following words: “A sober, respectable, and\r\nwell-behaved colored man or woman is entitled under the law of\r\nPennsylvania to be received in any house of entertainment and be treated\r\nin the same manner as any other guest. It is time that race\r\ndiscrimination ceased in this State.... No one objects any longer to his\r\n[the Negro’s] presence in a public conveyance or place of entertainment;\r\nthus far the prejudice of race has been overcome; it is quite certain\r\nthat the objection to his presence in a hotel or restaurant will also\r\npass away as soon as his right under the law to be there is recognized\r\nin fact as it now is by the letter of the statute.... It would be vain\r\nto deny that some race prejudice still exists among us, but the law does\r\nnot countenance it, and good citizens should strive to rise above it. We\r\ntrust the effort will be made and that toleration and moderation will\r\nmark the conduct of both races.”\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the members of the Indiana University football team went to the\r\nNutt House in Crawfordsville, Indiana, for accommodation. One of the\r\nmembers of the team was a Negro. The clerk refused to take the Negro in\r\nwith the rest of the guests, but offered to let him eat at the\r\n“ordinary.” The Negro, being a minor, brought suit through his next\r\nfriend, and the Indiana[264] court held that the Civil Rights Bill of\r\nthe State could not be satisfied by separate accommodations.\r\n\r\nThere is no case of race discrimination in the hotels of Massachusetts\r\nthat has reached the higher courts, but in April, 1896, the following\r\nresolution[265] was passed by the General Court of the State:\r\n\r\n“_Whereas_, On the twenty-ninth day of January, eighteen ninety-six, the\r\nReverend Benjamin W. Arnett, D.D., of Wilberforce, Ohio, senior bishop\r\nof the African Methodist Episcopal Church, president of the board of\r\ntrustees of Wilberforce University, and member of many learned\r\nsocieties, was refused entertainment at certain reputable hotels in the\r\ncity of Boston, because he was a colored man, in spite of the statute\r\nlaws against discrimination on account of color; therefore,\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the senate and house of representatives of the\r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, in general court assembled, successors of\r\nthose bodies which repeatedly elected Charles Sumner to the Senate of\r\nthe United States, and for four years received messages from John A.\r\nAndrew, hereby express their severest reprobation of such discrimination\r\nand their firm conviction of the truth of the clause of the Declaration\r\nof Independence wherein all men are declared to be created equal; and it\r\nis further\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That still more to be reprobated is the sentiment of any\r\npart of the public against any class of our fellow citizens whereby such\r\ndiscrimination is rendered possible, and that a vigorous campaign for\r\nstatute rights by the persons most aggrieved will meet the hearty\r\napproval and coöperation of the two branches of the General Court.” This\r\nis very significant as showing the actual attitude of the hotels of\r\nBoston toward receiving Negroes. Whether the “vigorous campaign” was\r\nconducted one cannot tell; certainly no case appears to have reached the\r\ncourts. And there is in Boston at present a Negro hotel.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the Lucerne Hotel in New York City in 1905, refused to\r\nlease a suite to a woman because she was a Jewess. It was a family\r\nhotel, containing small suites like those found in an ordinary apartment\r\nhouse, rented upon annual leases, transients not being solicited. The\r\nNew York court[266] held that it was not a hotel in the sense that the\r\nmanager must receive all applicants without regard to race or color. Of\r\ncourse, this case did not concern the Negro, but the same principle is\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RESTAURANTS\r\n\r\nRace discrimination in restaurants is prohibited by thirteen States; in\r\ntaverns, by one; in eating-houses, by eleven; in boarding-houses, by\r\none; in cafés, by one; in chop-houses, by one; and at lunch-counters, by\r\none. These will be considered under the general head of restaurants.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 a Negro was refused accommodation in a restaurant in New York.\r\nAt that time the laws of the State prohibited discrimination in inns.\r\nThe restaurant-keeper argued as a defence in the suit that followed that\r\nthe restaurant was not included in the term “inns.” The court[267] held\r\nthat the legislature meant by “inn” a place that furnished both lodging\r\nand food to guests, that “restaurant” had no fixed legal meaning, and\r\nthat the declaration was sufficient if it said “inn” and then explained\r\nit by calling it a restaurant.\r\n\r\nA Negro went to a restaurant in Detroit in 1887 and asked for\r\naccommodation. The clerk told him that he could not be served on the\r\nrestaurant side, but that he would be served if he went over on the\r\nsaloon side. The colored man complained to the proprietor and was told\r\nthat it was the rule of the house not to serve Negroes in the restaurant\r\nroom. The statute of Michigan required full and equal accommodation in\r\nrestaurants. The court[268] held that the statute would not be satisfied\r\nif the Negro were given as good accommodations but in a different room,\r\nsaying: “In Michigan there must be and is an absolute, unconditional\r\nequality of white and colored men before the law.... Whatever right a\r\nwhite man has in a public place, the black man has also.”\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a colored man went into a restaurant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\r\nAfter sitting at the table forty minutes without having his order taken,\r\nhe complained, and was told that he was not served because he was\r\ncolored. He left, and later brought suit. At the trial, it appeared that\r\nthe discrimination was not with the sanction of the proprietor, that he\r\nhad told the waiter to serve Negroes, that the waiter had refused to do\r\nso and was discharged therefor. Nevertheless, the court[269] held that\r\nthe proprietor was liable for the act of his servant, and gave\r\ncompensatory damages to the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe next year, a restaurant keeper refused to accommodate a Negro in\r\nLucas County, Ohio, and the court[270] allowed the Negro to recover the\r\npenalty prescribed by the law. The case was decided on a question of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 a Negro was serving on the jury in a civil case in Iowa. The\r\nbailiff had arranged with a boarding-house to serve meals. When the\r\nNegro, along with the other jurors, went for his meals, the\r\nboarding-house keeper refused to allow him to sit at the same table with\r\nthe others. It was not questioned that this was in violation of the\r\nCivil Rights Bill of the State if the boarding-house was an\r\n“eating-house” within the terms of the statute. The court[271] charged\r\nthe jury that such an eating-house as would come within the statute must\r\nbe a place where meals are served to anyone applying at the same prices\r\ncharged to all, but that, if meals are served only in pursuance of a\r\nprevious arrangement for particular individuals, rather than anyone who\r\nmay apply, it is a private boarding-house and not within the statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BARBER-SHOPS\r\n\r\nThirteen States provide that barbers must serve all persons without\r\nregard to race or color.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a barber in Lincoln, Nebraska, refused to shave a Negro because\r\nhe was “colored.” The Civil Rights Bill of that State mentions barbers.\r\nThe court[272] held: “A barber, by opening a shop and putting out his\r\nsign, thereby invites every orderly and well-behaved person who may\r\ndesire his services to enter his shop during business hours. The statute\r\nwill not permit him to say to one, you were a slave or the son of a\r\nslave, therefore I will not shave you. Such prejudices are unworthy of\r\nour better manhood, and are clearly prohibited by the statute.”\r\nBarber-shops were included within the provisions of the Massachusetts\r\nCivil Rights Bill in 1893, but, as a matter of fact, Negroes are not\r\neven now given the same accommodations as whites in barber-shops in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe statute of Connecticut requires equality of service in “places of\r\npublic accommodation.” A barber refused to serve one Faulkner because he\r\nwas a Negro, and the latter brought suit on the ground that a\r\nbarber-shop is a place of public accommodation and, hence, within the\r\nCivil Rights Bill of the State. The court[273] held that the barber-shop\r\nis not, in its nature, different from the places of business run for\r\nprivate gain, and that the common law has never recognized it as\r\npossessing the quality of a place of public accommodation, as a hotel,\r\npublic conveyance, etc.\r\n\r\nIt may be added here that most of the cases have involved the point as\r\nto what are places of public accommodation or amusement or resort. If\r\nthe place is mentioned in the Civil Rights Bill, it is, of course,\r\nwithin the prohibition, and it is a violation of the statute even to\r\nrequire separate accommodations, although equal in every other respect.\r\nBut a vast deal of litigation has arisen out of instances of Negroes\r\nbeing denied accommodation in places considered public in their nature\r\nbut which are not mentioned in the Civil Rights Bill of the State\r\nwherein the case arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BOOTBLACK STANDS\r\n\r\nIn the year 1901, Basso, a bootblack in the basement of one of the\r\nbusiness houses of Rochester, New York, refused to serve Burks because\r\nthe latter was a Negro. The law of New York, as has been seen, requires\r\nfull and equal accommodations in hotels and “other places of public\r\naccommodation.” The question, therefore, was: Is a bootblack stand a\r\nplace of “public accommodation”? The municipal court of Rochester, in\r\nwhich Burks brought suit, gave judgment for him, thereby answering the\r\nquestion in the affirmative. The county court reversed the decision. The\r\nappellate division reversed the county court and sustained the\r\nmunicipal. The court of appeals[274] reversed the appellate division\r\nthereby sustaining the county court, saying: “A bootblacking stand may\r\nbe said to be a place of public accommodation, like the store of a dry\r\ngoods merchant, a grocer, or the proverbial ‘butcher, baker, and\r\ncandlestick maker’; but that is very far from placing it in the same\r\ncategory with the places specifically named in the statute. Inns,\r\nhotels, and public conveyances are places of public accommodation in the\r\nbroadest sense, because they have always been denominated as such under\r\nthe common law. Bath-houses and barber-shops are not to be regarded as\r\nincluded within the statute under the general phrase, ‘and all other\r\nplaces of public accommodation.’ There is no more relation between a\r\nbootblacking stand and a public conveyance than there is between a\r\ntheatre or music-hall and a bath-house or barber-shop. There is, it is\r\ntrue, a superficial resemblance between the occupation of the barber and\r\nthat of the bootblack, in the sense that both minister to the personal\r\ncomfort and convenience of others; but the same argument could be\r\nextended far beyond the limits necessary to demonstrate that not ‘all\r\nother places of public accommodation’ are included by relation within\r\nthe category of the things specifically enumerated in the statute.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BILLIARD-ROOMS\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts in 1866, a certain Negro was refused, because of his\r\nrace or color, the use of a billiard-room. At that time a statute of the\r\nCommonwealth required equal accommodation in public places of amusement.\r\nThe Supreme Court[275] of Massachusetts, in which the Negro’s case was\r\nfinally heard, held that there was no proof that the room was licensed,\r\nand added: “It cannot be supposed that it was the intent of the\r\nlegislature to prescribe the manner in which persons should use their\r\nown premises or permit others to use them, if they did not carry on\r\ntherein an occupation or business, or suffer other persons to\r\nappropriate them to a purpose, which required a license in order to\r\nrender such an appropriation lawful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SALOONS\r\n\r\nOnly two States, Minnesota and Wisconsin, mention saloons in their Civil\r\nRights Bills. And in Minnesota, they were not added till 1899, as a\r\nresult of the following case: A Negro was denied accommodation in a\r\nsaloon. At that time, the statute required equal accommodations in inns\r\nand “places of public resort, refreshment, accommodation, or\r\nentertainment.” The court[276] of that State, in passing on the case,\r\nheld that a saloon is not among the other “places of public\r\nrefreshment.” The court suggests that “or other” means “other such like”\r\nand includes only places of the same nature as those already mentioned\r\nspecifically in the statute. About the Negro, the court said: “It is a\r\nwell-known fact that, owing to an unreasonable race prejudice which\r\nstill exists to some extent, the promiscuous entertainment of persons of\r\ndifferent races in places where intoxicating drinks are sold not\r\ninfrequently result in personal conflicts, especially when the passions\r\nof men are inflamed by liquor. Hence the legislature might have omitted\r\nsaloons for that reason.” The next year the legislature answered\r\notherwise by adding saloons to the Civil Rights Bill.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a bar-keeper in Ohio charged a Negro thirty cents for a\r\ncocktail, the regular price to white customers being only fifteen cents.\r\nThe Civil Rights Bill of Ohio did not mention saloons, but said “other\r\nplaces of public accommodation and amusement.” The court[277] held that\r\nsaloons were not included, adding, in the same spirit as the Minnesota\r\ncourt “... nor should we interpret this statute as encouraging a tariff\r\nwhich the clearly defined policy of the State discourages.”\r\n\r\nA statute of Louisiana[278] of 1908 requires separate saloons for white\r\nand colored persons. The Louisiana court,[279] in July, 1909, held that\r\nthe sale of liquor to white and colored persons must not be conducted in\r\nthe same building, and that the statute is not obeyed by providing\r\nseparate bars in the same building. The saloon keeper had attempted to\r\navoid paying taxes on two saloons by operating two bars in the same\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nIn Atlanta,[280] before State prohibition began, there were separate\r\nsaloons for the white and colored people. An ordinance of\r\nNashville,[281] Tennessee, which went into effect July 7, 1907, required\r\nthe segregation of the races in saloons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SODA FOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nThe keeper of a soda fountain in Illinois in 1896 refused to sell cold\r\ndrinks to a Negro. At that time the law required equal accommodation in\r\ninns and “all other places of accommodation and amusement.” The\r\ncourt[282] of that State held that a soda fountain is not such a place\r\nof accommodation or amusement. “Such a place,” the court argued, “can be\r\nconsidered a place of accommodation or amusement to no greater extent\r\nthan a places where dry goods or clothing, boots and shoes, hats and\r\ncaps, or groceries, are dispensed. The personal liberty of an individual\r\nin his business transactions, and his freedom from restrictions, is a\r\nquestion of utmost moment, and no construction can be adopted by which\r\nan individual right of action will be included as controlled within a\r\nlegislative enactment, unless clearly expressed in such enactment and\r\ncertainly included within the constitutional limitation on the power of\r\nthe legislature.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THEATRES\r\n\r\nThe question of the rights of Negroes in theatres has given rise to a\r\nnumber of judicial decisions. Fifteen States provide by statute that\r\nthere shall be no race distinction in theatres. In 1873, the laws of\r\nMississippi, under the Reconstruction government, declared that all\r\npersons, without distinction as to race, color, or previous condition of\r\nservitude, should have equal and impartial enjoyment of theatres. One\r\nDonnell, held in custody for refusing to pay a fine for violating this\r\nlaw by refusing to sell theatre tickets to two Negroes, petitioned for a\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_. The court[283] held that the law was not\r\nunconstitutional, because it in no way appropriated private property to\r\npublic use.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in reply to a question whether it was a crime to refuse\r\na Negro equal accommodations in a hotel, Judge Emmons in Tennessee\r\ncharged the grand jury[284] that the Federal government had no right to\r\nrequire individual innkeepers, theatre managers, etc., to entertain\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 a Negro in Louisiana bought a ticket to a theatre, which he was\r\nnot allowed to use on account of his color. He sued for five thousand\r\ndollars damages. The Constitution of that State, at the time, guaranteed\r\nequal accommodations in public places. The Louisiana court[285] held\r\nthat this law “does not enumerate a mere abstraction, but it guarantees\r\nsubstantial rights.” The Negro’s claim was sustained, but the damages\r\nwere reduced to three hundred dollars and costs. Both this and the\r\nMississippi case arose in the South and were decided favorably to the\r\nrights of the Negro, but both came during the Reconstruction régime.\r\nSince then, no such case appears to have risen in the South.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a Negro woman in Illinois, having been refused tickets to a\r\ntheatre, had a white man buy them for herself and her husband. On\r\npresenting the tickets they were refused admission to seats in the\r\ntheatre which the tickets called for. At the resulting trial, the\r\nproprietor offered to prove that he had, “in order to avoid collision\r\nbetween the races, adopted a rule (and that such rule was necessary) to\r\nthe effect that the colored people should have one row to themselves in\r\neach part of the house, or as many rows as the tickets which they bought\r\nwould call for.” This evidence was rejected, the court[286] holding that\r\nthe Civil Rights Bill of Illinois could not be satisfied by separate\r\naccommodations.\r\n\r\nMissouri has no Civil Rights Bill. A Negro, mistaken for a white man by\r\nthe clerk in the box-office, bought tickets for seats in the orchestra\r\nof a Kansas City theatre. When he presented his tickets to the usher he\r\nwas refused the seats called for, but was offered in exchange balcony\r\nseats reserved for Negroes. The court[287] before which the case was\r\ntried held that the rule of the theatre requiring separate\r\naccommodations for the races was not a violation of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\nThe most recent case[288] appears to be a 1905 case in New York in which\r\na Negro was ejected from a theatre by an employee. The proprietor was\r\npermitted to show that the ejectment was done while he was away and\r\ncontrary to his orders, and that he permitted Negroes to enjoy the\r\nprivileges of the place. A verdict was thereupon found for him, but the\r\ncase was remanded by the appellate court for a new trial, on the ground\r\nthat the evidence was improperly admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SKATING RINKS\r\n\r\nCalifornia, Illinois, and Massachusetts have considered skating rinks of\r\nenough importance to include them in their Civil Rights Bills. In 1885\r\nthe keeper of a skating rink in Iowa refused to let a Negro use it, and\r\nthe Negro brought suit. The court[289] held that the exclusion of a\r\ncolored man from a skating rink not licensed is not illegal. The New\r\nYork court[290] has held that a skating rink is a “place of public\r\namusement” within the meaning of the statute, so that a keeper of one\r\ncannot refuse admission to a Negro.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CEMETERIES\r\n\r\nThe early Civil Rights Bills of New York, Florida, and Kansas prohibited\r\nrace distinctions in public cemeteries. This stipulation, however, does\r\nnot appear in the present statutes of any of the States, except Kansas.\r\nRace distinctions in cemeteries are common. The legislature of\r\nMississippi[291] of 1900, for instance, gave the Ladies’ Auxiliary\r\nCemetery Association, an organization of white women, permission to\r\nremove the monument and remains of the Negro State Secretary of State,\r\nJames Lynch, from the white to the Negro cemetery in Jackson,\r\nMississippi, provided it was done without expense to the State.\r\n\r\nThe Raleigh, N. C., _News and Observer_ of February 20, 1906, quotes the\r\nGermantown, Pa., _Guide_ as calling on the people to provide a cemetery\r\nwhere Negroes may be buried, saying that “unless something is done, the\r\nbodies of the colored poor will be denied the right of decent burial,\r\nfor their disposal, of necessity, will be by means of the dissecting\r\nrooms of anatomical boards.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Bills of the eighteen States have now been analyzed,\r\nand the judicial decisions arising therefrom have been considered. It is\r\nnoticeable that, if one excepts the theatre cases of the Reconstruction\r\nperiod, not a case has come from a Southern State. The explanation must\r\nbe that those States have never undertaken to require hotel-keepers,\r\netc., to offer accommodations without regard to color: the Negroes have\r\ntaken for granted that they would not be admitted to such places, except\r\nupon condition that they would accept the accommodations set apart for\r\ntheir race, and consequently have not applied for admission upon any\r\nother terms. In the other States the courts have, as a rule, interpreted\r\nthe Civil Rights Bills very strictly. If a place is not specifically\r\nmentioned in the statute, courts have been very slow to include it under\r\nthe general head of “other places of amusement or accommodation.” In\r\nother words, this phrase, which is, in substance, tacked on to every\r\nstatute, is a dead letter. The courts are chary, as they should be, of\r\ninvading individual liberty and freedom of business. But if a place is\r\nspecifically mentioned in the statute, the law is not satisfied by\r\noffering separate accommodations to Negroes, even though such\r\naccommodations are equal for both races in every respect; they must be\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n\r\n               RACE DISCRIMINATION BY INSURANCE COMPANIES\r\n\r\nSome allied topics may be properly discussed under the general head of\r\ncivil rights.\r\n\r\nFive States—Connecticut,[292] Massachusetts,[293] Ohio,[294] New\r\nYork,[295] and Michigan,[296]—have deemed it necessary to pass laws\r\nprohibiting any discrimination on account of race or color by life\r\ninsurance companies. All of the statutes are essentially the same. They\r\ndeclare that no life insurance company shall make any distinction or\r\ndiscrimination between white and colored persons wholly or partly of\r\nAfrican descent, as to premiums or rates charged for policies; nor shall\r\nsuch company demand higher premiums from colored persons than from\r\nwhites of the same age, sex, general condition of health, and hope of\r\nlongevity; nor shall it make or require any rebate, diminution, or\r\ndiscount upon the sum to be paid on the policy in case of the death of\r\nthe colored person. Such a company is forbidden to add any stipulation\r\nby which the insured binds himself, his heirs, executors, assigns, etc.,\r\nto accept any sum less than the face value of the policy. Massachusetts\r\nprovides that if a company refuses to insure a colored person making\r\napplication, it must, upon his request, give him a certificate of the\r\nregular examining physician, saying that the refusal was not because the\r\napplicant is a person of color, but solely upon the grounds of general\r\nhealth and prospect of longevity as would be applicable to white persons\r\nof the same age and sex.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut statute enacts that any condition or stipulation in the\r\npolicy, inserted because of the color or race of the insured, shall be\r\nvoid. Ohio provides that any corporation, or officer or agent of such\r\ncorporation, violating the provisions of its statute, shall be fined for\r\neach offence not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two hundred\r\ndollars, but that nothing in the act shall be construed as to require\r\nany agent or company to take or receive the application for insurance of\r\nany person. New York makes the violation of the law a misdemeanor\r\npunishable by a fine of from fifty dollars to five hundred dollars.\r\nMichigan goes a step further and declares that anyone violating the law\r\nshall forfeit to the State five hundred dollars, to be recovered by the\r\nattorney general, and that any officer or agent who violates it shall be\r\nguilty of a misdemeanor and punished by imprisonment in the county jail\r\nnot over one year or by a fine of from fifty dollars to five hundred\r\ndollars, or both.\r\n\r\nThere must have been instances of discrimination by life insurance\r\ncompanies against Negroes, else these States would not have thought it\r\nnecessary to enact such statutes. The explanation of this discrimination\r\nis probably not so much race prejudice as the general belief, based upon\r\nstatistics, that the Negro, particularly in the colder climate of the\r\nNorth and West, has not the same hope of longevity as the white man,\r\nbeing more subject to pulmonary and other mortal diseases. If the risk\r\nof mortality of the Negro is greater, the insurance company argued that\r\nit was justified in seeking compensation for assuming this increased\r\nrisk by charging a higher premium. No case has been found arising under\r\nthese statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  RACE DISCRIMINATIONS BY LABOR UNIONS\r\n\r\nThe attitude of labor organizations toward Negroes has of late been the\r\nsubject of much comment, especially by the Negroes themselves, who\r\ncomplain that they are handicapped in the struggle for existence because\r\nof the hostility of such organizations. Mr. Baker,[297] speaking of the\r\nNorth, said: “And yet, although I expected to find the Negro wholly\r\nostracised by union labor, I discovered that where the Negro becomes\r\nnumerous or skilful enough, he, like the Italian or Russian Jew, begins\r\nto force his way into the unions.... They have got in, ... not because\r\nthey are wanted, or because they are liked, but because, by being\r\nprepared, skilled, and energetic, the unions have had to take them in as\r\na matter of self-protection.... In several great industries North and\r\nSouth, indeed, the Negro is as much a part of labor unionism as the\r\nwhite man.” There seems to be more opposition to Negroes joining the\r\nunions of Philadelphia than most Northern cities.[298]\r\n\r\nOne would expect to find, where the conflict between white and colored\r\nlaborers exists, some evidence of it in statutes or court reports. But\r\nthis resolution of the General Court of Massachusetts,[299] passed in\r\n1904, is the only trace that has been found: “_Whereas_, the national\r\nleague of American wheelmen, at their convention held in Louisville,\r\nKentucky, on the twentieth day of February, in the present year, voted\r\nto exclude colored persons from membership in said organization, which\r\nexclusion affects the members of the organization resident in\r\nMassachusetts; _Resolved_, That the General Court deprecates the action\r\nof the organization above referred to, and regards the enforcement of\r\ndiscriminations of this character as a revival of baseless and obsolete\r\nprejudices.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHURCHES\r\n\r\nColorado is the only State that has undertaken by legislation to\r\nguarantee to Negroes full and equal accommodations in churches. The rest\r\nhave left it to the churches themselves to decide the matter.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that during slavery the Negroes, for the most\r\npart, attended the white churches, where galleries were set apart for\r\nthem, were members thereof, and were served by white ministers. After\r\nEmancipation, the Negroes withdrew from the white churches and built\r\nplaces of worship of their own. To-day, in all parts of the country,\r\nwhere Negroes live in considerable numbers, they have their own\r\nchurches. In such cities as Boston, where the doors of all churches are\r\nin theory open to every race, Negro churches are found in the Negro\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is practically race separation in the churches of the\r\nwhole country, all the difficulties have not been solved. In 1903, the\r\nFreedman’s Aid and Southern Educational Society, an organization of the\r\nbishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, general secretaries of the\r\nchurch department, and leading laymen, met in session in Lincoln,\r\nNebraska. Inasmuch as the purpose of this body was to devise and discuss\r\nmeans of improving the educational opportunities of the Southern\r\nNegroes, the churchmen of that race were present in good numbers. Some\r\nof the hotels in the city gave notice that they could not allow the\r\ncolored delegates to eat in the main dining rooms, but that they could\r\nfurnish them sleeping accommodations and serve them meals in their\r\napartments.[300] It is along this line that the difficulty usually\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nThe Baptist denomination recently organized the General Baptist\r\nConvention of America, which held its first meeting in St. Louis in\r\n1905. The next meeting was to have been in Louisville, Kentucky, May 5\r\nand 16, 1906. The executive committee of the convention postponed the\r\nmeeting for a year, assigning as their reason, or one of their reasons,\r\nthe fact that they experienced difficulty in securing a church in which\r\nto hold the convention, the white Baptists being averse to having the\r\ncolored members of the denomination assemble with them. It was arranged\r\nlater that the whites and Negroes should meet in the same edifice, but\r\nthat the Negroes should be restricted to the use of the balconies. This,\r\nhowever, was resented by the Negroes.[301]\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian Church also has had to face the race problem. In its\r\ngeneral assembly at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1906, the committee on church\r\npolicies recommended the erection of a synod in Alabama to include the\r\npresbyteries of Birmingham, Levere, and Rogersville, which are composed\r\nof colored churches. They had hitherto been included in the synod of\r\nTennessee. The report provoked such a discussion that it was carried\r\nover to the next meeting, and no subsequent account has appeared.[302]\r\nAt the general assembly of 1908, held in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the\r\nquestion arose again out of a report of the Board of Freedmen’s\r\nMissions, some of the members from the North resenting such a separation\r\nin the missionary efforts.[303]\r\n\r\nThe Episcopal Church has probably had the most difficulty with the race\r\nproblem. This Church has had no separate organization for Negroes. Both\r\nraces meet together in the annual diocese conventions, without\r\ndistinction, and participate in the business of the Church. At one of\r\nthese conventions, held at Tarboro, North Carolina, in 1907, the\r\nfollowing resolution was passed: “That the time has come when the\r\nwelfare of both races in the Southern States requires that each race\r\nshould have its own ecclesiastical legislative assemblies, and that we\r\nurge the General Convention to take immediate action.” The colored\r\nclergy and congregations had already expressed their willingness to\r\nsubmit the whole matter to the general convention. In speaking for\r\nseparation, Bishop Cheshire, of North Carolina, said: “I have come to\r\nthis conclusion in spite of the sentiments and convictions of a\r\nlifetime, and though my mind and conscience compel my assent to this\r\nnecessity, my heart still clings to the old ideal of a church and a\r\ndiocese which in its annual gatherings should represent visibly the\r\noneness of all races and colors in Christ.... We must confront the\r\nactual facts of the day. I believe that, in one way or another, both the\r\nwhite race and the colored race, consciously or unconsciously, demand a\r\ndifferent arrangement of our ecclesiastical institutions. I believe that\r\nsome separate organization for our colored work is coming in the near\r\nfuture.”[304] At the general convention, which met in Richmond,\r\nVirginia, in October, 1907, the question of the separation of the races\r\nwas much discussed, but the actual outcome has not been learned. It\r\ndeveloped in the debate that the Southern bishops desired separation,\r\nwishing to be relieved of the burden of the Negroes in their dioceses,\r\nwhile the bishops from other sections preferred the present arrangement,\r\nnot desiring to be burdened with a class of people not in their\r\ndioceses.[305]\r\n\r\nThe Young Men’s Christian Associations of the Northern cities have to\r\nmeet the problem of the Negro. The New Haven, Connecticut, people\r\nrefused to permit Negroes to attend the Y. M. C. A., and a separate\r\nbuilding had to be provided for them.[306]\r\n\r\nWithin the colored church itself there is manifest a conflict between\r\nthe Negroes proper and mulattoes. There is a town in North Carolina in\r\nwhich they have practical separation in the churches, the black Negroes\r\ngoing to one church and the bright mulattoes to another. A similar\r\nseparation of the Negroes and mulattoes in churches exists, to some\r\nextent, in Charleston, South Carolina. At a Negro Christian Congress at\r\nWashington City, in 1906, the chairman of the meeting was charged with\r\nremoving from the program dark-skinned men and substituting\r\nlight-skinned men. It provoked such a discussion as to divide the\r\nmeeting into two factions.[307]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NEGROES IN THE MILITIA\r\n\r\nThe Brownsville affair—that is, the dismissal without honor, through the\r\norder of President Roosevelt, of a whole regiment of Negro soldiers\r\nbecause of the misconduct of some of them and the refusal of the others\r\nto testify against the guilty ones, and the championship of the cause of\r\nthe Negroes by Senator Foraker—has brought into much prominence the\r\nquestion of the Negro as a soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States have been and are unfavorable to allowing Negroes to\r\nserve in the militia. South Carolina,[308] in 1865, declared that\r\npersons of color constituted no part of the militia of the State.\r\nArkansas,[309] in 1867, accorded to Negroes all the rights of white\r\ncitizens, with a few exceptions, one of which was that nothing in the\r\nstatute should be construed as modifying any statute or common law usage\r\nin the State respecting the service of Negroes in the militia. North\r\nCarolina[310] provided that white and colored members of the detailed\r\nmilitia should not be compelled to serve in the same companies.\r\nGeorgia,[311] in 1905, by statute, abolished the colored troops of the\r\nState, active and retired, and discharged the officers and men from the\r\nmilitary service of the State.\r\n\r\nThere is very little legislation on the subject in the other States. In\r\n1879, the legislature of Connecticut[312] authorized the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the State militia to organize four independent\r\nNegro companies of infantry to be part of the National Guard. West\r\nVirginia,[313] in 1889, provided that, if any colored troops should be\r\norganized, they should be enlisted and kept separate and apart from the\r\nother troops, and should be formed into separate companies and\r\nregiments. New Jersey,[314] in 1895, made provision for four companies\r\nof colored infantry, presumably meaning that they should be all colored\r\nand kept separate from the other troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SEPARATION OF STATE DEPENDENTS\r\n\r\nThe Southern States, as a rule, require a separation by race of inmates\r\nof State charitable and penal institutions, and where it is not provided\r\nfor by statute, it is done as a matter of custom. Alabama,[315] for\r\ninstance, makes it unlawful for any jailer or sheriff, having charge of\r\nwhite and colored prisoners before conviction, to imprison them\r\npermanently together in the same apartments of the jail or other places\r\nof safe-keeping, if there are enough separate apartments. It is also\r\nunlawful[316] for white and colored convicts to be chained together,\r\nallowed to sleep together, or confined in the same room or apartment\r\nwhen not at work.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Arkansas[317] passed a statute in 1903, directing\r\nthat in the State penitentiary and in all county jails, stockades,\r\nconvict camps, and all other places where prisoners are confined,\r\nseparate apartments should be provided and maintained for white and\r\nNegro prisoners. Separate bunks, beds, bedding, dining tables, and other\r\nfurnishings were required, and after they had once been assigned to a\r\nprisoner of one race they must not be changed to the use of one of the\r\nother race. White prisoners must not be handcuffed or otherwise chained\r\nor tied to a Negro prisoner.\r\n\r\nGeorgia[318] does not allow prison-keepers, or firms leasing or\r\ncontrolling convicts, to confine white and colored convicts together, or\r\nto work them chained together, or to chain them together in going to and\r\nfrom their work or at any other time. Mississippi[319] provides that no\r\ndiscrimination shall be made on account of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition, in working convicts. This does not mean that they shall not\r\nbe separated, as they are in Georgia, but is simply a prohibition\r\nagainst discrimination in the quality of work assigned to the two races.\r\nAt the last session of the legislature of North Carolina,[320] a bill\r\nwas passed providing for the separation of white and colored prisoners\r\nin the State penitentiary and in the State and county convict camps\r\nduring sleeping and eating hours.\r\n\r\nThat a separation of the two races exists in the jails of Washington\r\nCity is evidenced by a protest issued a year or so ago by the National\r\nEqual Rights Council of that city, a Negro organization, against the\r\nseparation of the white and colored prisoners in the jails of the city.\r\nThere was no allegation, however, that the cells were not equal in\r\naccommodation, the objection being raised solely at the principle of\r\nseparation.[321]\r\n\r\nAs to reformatories, Georgia[322] provides that they shall be so\r\nconstructed as to keep white and colored inmates separate. West\r\nVirginia[323] requires that the white and colored inmates of its reform\r\nschool for boys shall be kept separate, and the inmates of its\r\nindustrial home for girls (also a reformatory) shall be separate as far\r\nas practicable.\r\n\r\nAs to paupers, Alabama[324] authorizes the county commissioners of\r\nWashington County to keep separate accommodations for the maintenance of\r\nwhite and colored paupers.\r\n\r\nNot many States have statutes which say in so many words that lunatics,\r\nand that the deaf, mute, and blind shall be kept separated according to\r\nrace; but one finds appropriations for colored asylums and schools,\r\netc., and one is justified in concluding that, where a colored asylum or\r\nschool is built, the colored persons are not allowed in the other\r\nasylums and schools of the State. Alabama,[325] for instance, has a\r\nschool for the Negro deaf and blind at Talladega, under the control and\r\nmanagement of the board of trustees of the white school for the deaf,\r\nand makes an annual appropriation for the support of the school.\r\nArkansas[326] also provides that applicants to the deaf-mute asylums\r\nshall be received without restriction on account of race or color, but\r\ndoes not forbid their separation by race within the asylum.\r\nTennessee,[327] as early as 1866, provided that there should be separate\r\nasylums for the colored blind, deaf and dumb, and lunatics, and the\r\ntrustees of these institutions were given power to prepare buildings for\r\ncolored insane, “so as to keep them secure and safe, and yet separate\r\nand apart from the white patients.” In 1881, that State[328]\r\nappropriated $25,000 to provide accommodations for the colored blind at\r\nNashville, and the same amount for the colored deaf and dumb at\r\nKnoxville. Kentucky[329] likewise provided in 1876 that white and\r\ncolored lunatics should not be kept in the same building. New York[330]\r\nhas on many occasions made appropriations for asylums for colored\r\nchildren, thus leaving the impression that such children are not\r\nadmitted to the white asylums. North Carolina[331] maintains separate\r\nasylums for its white and colored insane. And Georgia[332] requires the\r\nasylums of the State to provide apartments for the insane Negro\r\nresidents of the State. Indiana,[333] in 1879, made an appropriation to\r\nassociations formed for the purpose of maintaining an asylum for colored\r\norphan children. The West Virginia[334] asylum for insane must have\r\nseparate wards for white and colored patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  Bouvier’s “Law Dictionary,” I, p. 331.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  14 Stat.

That it shall be unlawful for any person, corporation or\r\nassociation of persons to maintain or operate any college, school or\r\ninstitution where persons of the white and Negro races are both received\r\nas pupils for instruction; and any person or corporation who shall\r\noperate or maintain any such college, school or institution shall be\r\nfined one thousand dollars, and any person or corporation who may be\r\nconvicted of violating the provisions of this act shall be fined one\r\nhundred dollars for each day they may operate said school, college or\r\ninstitution after such conviction.\r\n\r\n“Sec. 2. That any instructor who shall teach in any school, college or\r\ninstitution where members of said two races are received as pupils for\r\ninstruction shall be guilty of operating and maintaining same and fined\r\nas provided in the first section hereof.\r\n\r\n“Sec. 3. It shall be unlawful for any white person to attend any school\r\nor institution where Negroes are received as pupils or receive\r\ninstruction, and it shall be unlawful for any Negro or colored person to\r\nattend any school or institution where white persons are received as\r\npupils, or receive instruction. Any persons so offending shall be fined\r\nfifty dollars for each day he attends such institution or school:\r\nProvided, That the provisions of this law shall not apply to any penal\r\ninstitution or house of reform.\r\n\r\n“Sec. 4. Nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent any private\r\nschool, college or institution of learning from maintaining a separate\r\nand distinct branch thereof, in a different locality, not less than\r\ntwenty-five miles distant, for the education exclusively of one race or\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n“Sec. 5. This act shall not take effect, or be in operation before the\r\nfifteenth day of July, Nineteen Hundred and Four.”\r\n\r\nThis law was general in its terms, requiring, under heavy penalty, the\r\nseparation of the white and colored races in all schools of the State,\r\nprivate as well as public. But at the time of the consideration of the\r\nbill, the legislators probably knew that there was only one school in\r\nthe State which admitted both white and colored students. That was Berea\r\nCollege, which had been established about fifty years before for the\r\npurpose of “promoting the cause of Christ” and of giving general and\r\nnonsectarian instruction to “all youth of good moral character.” It was\r\nprimarily for the benefit of the mountain whites of Kentucky, Tennessee,\r\nVirginia, and the Carolinas. After the Civil War, the doors of the\r\nschool had been opened to Negroes, and in 1904, Berea had a student-body\r\nof nine hundred and twenty-seven, of whom one hundred and seventy-four\r\nwere Negroes.[336] The President and Trustees of the college protested\r\nagainst the enactment of the above law, but to no avail. When the\r\nsession of 1904–5 began, the colored students were refused admission.\r\nThe college at once took steps to aid these Negro youths. It bore the\r\ntransportation expenses of about a hundred of them to Fisk University,\r\nKnoxville College, Hampton Institute, and other distinctly colored\r\nschools. The white students left behind gave to the colored students\r\nleaving Berea the following expression of their regard for them:\r\n\r\n“Friends and Fellow-Students: As we meet for the first time under new\r\nconditions to enjoy the great privileges of Berea College, we think at\r\nonce of you who are now deprived of these privileges. Our sense of\r\njustice shows us that others have the same rights as ourselves, and the\r\nteaching of Christ leads us to ‘remember them that are in bonds as bound\r\nwith them.’\r\n\r\n“We realize that you are excluded from the class rooms of Berea College,\r\nwhich we so highly prize, by no fault of your own, and that this\r\nhardship is a part of a long line of deprivations under which you live.\r\nBecause you were born in a race long oppressed and largely untaught and\r\nundeveloped, heartless people feel more free to do you wrong, and\r\nthoughtless people meet your attempts at self-improvement with\r\nindifference or scorn. Even good people sometimes fear to recognize your\r\nworth, or take your part in a neighborly way because of the violences\r\nand prejudices around us.\r\n\r\n“We are glad that we have known you, or known about you, and that we\r\nknow you are rising above all discouragements, and showing a capacity\r\nand a character that give promise for your people.... And you will\r\nalways have our friendship, and the friendship of the best people\r\nthroughout the world. We hope never to be afraid or ashamed to show our\r\napproval of any colored person who has the character and worth of most\r\nof the colored students of Berea. We are glad that the college is\r\nproviding funds to assist you in continuing your education, and we are\r\nsure the institution will find ways in which to do its full duty by the\r\ncolored race.”[337]\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the statute separating the races in schools\r\naroused much comment throughout the country, the northern and eastern\r\npress being, as a rule, hostile to it, the southern press coming to its\r\ndefence. Haste was made to have a test case involving the\r\nconstitutionality of the law heard. On June 12, 1906, the Kentucky Court\r\nof Appeals in the case of Berea College v. The Commonwealth[338] upheld\r\nits constitutionality, being of opinion that the law in question did not\r\nviolate the Bill of Rights of the State Constitution, because the\r\nrequirement of separation was a reasonable exercise of the police power\r\nof the State, and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving\r\nBerea College of its property without due process of law, because the\r\nright to teach white and colored children in a private school at the\r\nsame time and place was not a property right, but the court added that\r\nthat part of the statute requiring a separate school for the other race,\r\nif established, to be at a distance of not less than twenty-five miles,\r\nwas unreasonable. The court took the position that the white and black\r\nraces are naturally antagonistic, and that the enforced separation of\r\nthe children in schools is in line with the preservation of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States,[339] on November 9, 1908,\r\naffirmed the opinion of the State court. Mr. Justice Brewer, however,\r\nplaced his decision upon the ground that the legislature has a right, by\r\nexpress reservation, to amend the charter so long as the amendment does\r\nnot defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant under the\r\ncharter. Mr. Justice Harlan, in a dissenting opinion, said the court\r\nshould meet the entire question squarely and decide whether it is a\r\ncrime under any conditions to educate white children and Negro children\r\nat the same institution. He said that the Kentucky statute was void as\r\nan arbitrary invasion of the rights of liberty and property granted by\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment against unauthorized State action. “Have we,”\r\nhe asked, “become so inoculated with prejudice of race that an American\r\ngovernment, professedly based on the principles of freedom, and charged\r\nwith the protection of all citizens alike, can make distinction between\r\nsuch citizens in the matter of their voluntary meeting for innocent\r\npurposes simply because of their respective races? Further, if the lower\r\ncourt be right, then a State may make it a crime for white and colored\r\npersons to frequent the same market places at the same time, or appear\r\nin an assemblage of citizens convened to consider questions of a public\r\nor political nature in which all citizens, without regard to race, are\r\nequally interested. Many other illustrations might be given to show the\r\nmischievous, not to say cruel, character of the statute in question, and\r\nhow inconsistent such legislation is with the great principle of the\r\nequality of citizens before the law.” Mr. Justice Harlan added that he\r\ndid not wish to be understood as criticising the system of separate\r\npublic schools for the races, but that his censure was directed at the\r\npenal provision of the Kentucky law involved in this case, which he\r\nconsidered unconstitutional, and so vitiating the whole statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n       EXCLUSION OF JAPANESE FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF SAN FRANCISCO\r\n\r\nThe second incident, which opened the question of the separation of the\r\nraces in schools and which led to international comment, was the\r\nexclusion of the Japanese children from the public schools of the city\r\nof San Francisco. A law was enacted by the California Legislature[340]\r\non March 12, 1872, which provided that school trustees should have the\r\npower to establish separate schools for Indian children and for the\r\nchildren of Mongolian and Chinese descent, and, when separate schools\r\nwere furnished, to keep Indian, Mongolian, and Chinese children from\r\nattending any other school. The law was amended[341] in 1880, 1885,\r\n1891, 1893, 1895, and 1903, but the provision for separation of the\r\nraces remained essentially unchanged. This law was not enforced until\r\n1901, when the labor vote became predominant. Then, according to\r\nSecretary Metcalf,[342] who investigated the conditions, the labor\r\nunionists began a crusade to exclude the Japanese laborers from\r\nCalifornia, as the Chinese had already been excluded. On May 6, 1905,\r\nthe Board of Education of San Francisco passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n“That the Board of Education is determined in its efforts to effect the\r\nestablishment of separate schools for Chinese and Japanese pupils, not\r\nonly for the purpose of relieving the congestion at present prevailing\r\nin our schools, but also for the higher end that our children should not\r\nbe placed in any position where their youthful impressions may be\r\naffected by association with pupils of the Mongolian race.” On October\r\n1, 1906, the Board took the next step and adopted this resolution: “That\r\nin accordance with Article X, Section 1662, of the school law of\r\nCalifornia, principals are hereby directed to send all Chinese, Japanese\r\nor Korean children to the Oriental Public School, situated on the south\r\nside of Cary street between Powell and Mason streets, on and after\r\nMonday, October 15, 1906.”\r\n\r\nOn the day the latter rule went into effect there were 28,736 school\r\nchildren in San Francisco, of whom ninety-three were Japanese\r\ndistributed in twenty-three primary and grammar schools of the city[343]\r\nand nearly half the Japanese children were in two of the twenty-three\r\nschools. When the primary schools, except the Oriental, were closed to\r\nthe Japanese children the Japanese residents became indignant. They\r\nappealed to their consul, and he, to their ambassador at Washington. The\r\nlatter, in turn, called on the President, reporting the matter at the\r\nsame time to the home government. Alarmists began to talk of war with\r\nJapan. President Roosevelt dispatched Secretary Metcalf to California to\r\nmake investigations. To use the President’s words, “I authorized and\r\ndirected Secretary Metcalf to state that if there was failure to protect\r\npersons and property, then the entire power of the Federal government\r\nwithin the limits of the Constitution would be used promptly and\r\nvigorously to enforce the observance of our treaty, the supreme law of\r\nthe land, which treaty guaranteed to the Japanese residents everywhere\r\nin the Union full and perfect protection for their persons and property,\r\nand to this end everything in my power would be done, and all the forces\r\nof the United States, both civil and military, which I could lawfully\r\nemploy, would be employed.” Mayor Schmitz and a number of prominent men\r\nof the city hurried across the continent to confer with the President. A\r\ntroublesome point of constitutional law was involved. It was admitted\r\nthat public education is distinctly a State function. A treaty is\r\ndeclared by the Federal Constitution[344] to be the “supreme law of the\r\nland.” Is a treaty the “supreme law of the land” in the sense that the\r\nPresident or Supreme Court can treat as invalid a State statute which\r\ncontravenes it, or must the Federal government bow in submission to that\r\nState statute even though it is counter to a treaty obligation? The\r\ntreaty of 1894 with Japan accorded to the Japanese residents in the\r\nUnited States the rights and privileges of the “most favored nation.”\r\nThe State of California had declared that Mongolian children, among\r\nwhich were Japanese, might, at the discretion of the Board of Education,\r\nbe required to go to separate schools for their race. The children of\r\nthe other “most favored” nations were permitted to attend the regular\r\npublic schools. Is admission to the regular public schools one of the\r\nrights and privileges guaranteed to Japanese children by the treaty,\r\nwhich cannot be limited by a State, or does the State of California, by\r\nits police power, have a right to separate the school children by race,\r\nregardless of national treaties? These questions, however, did not have\r\nto be answered; before the crisis came, all parties seemed to have\r\narrived at a satisfactory compromise. It was an agreement that all\r\nJapanese children not over fourteen years of age should be readmitted to\r\nthe primary schools, and those over that age should be admitted to the\r\nschools of higher grade, and the Japanese coolie labor should be\r\nexcluded. Thus was obviated what at one time looked like the approach of\r\nan international controversy over the separation of the races in\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of the California legislature, that of 1909,\r\nseveral bills concerning the Japanese were introduced, one of which was\r\nas follows: “Every school, unless otherwise provided by law, must be\r\nopen for the admission of all children between six and twenty-one years\r\nof age residing in the district, and the Board of School Trustees or\r\ncity Board of Education have power to admit adults and children not\r\nresiding in the district whenever good reasons exist therefor.\r\n\r\n“Trustees shall have the power to remove children of filthy or vicious\r\nhabits or children suffering from contagious or infectious diseases, and\r\nalso to establish separate schools for Indian children and for children\r\nof Mongolian or Japanese or Chinese descent.\r\n\r\n“When such separate schools are established, Indian, Chinese, Japanese\r\nor Mongolian children must not be admitted into any other school;\r\nprovided, that in cities and towns in which the kindergarten has been\r\nadopted, or may hereafter be adopted as part of the public primary\r\nschools, children may be admitted to such kindergarten classes at the\r\nage of four years; and provided further, that in cities or school\r\ndistricts in which separate classes have been or may hereafter be\r\nestablished for the instruction of the deaf, children may be admitted to\r\nsuch classes at the age of three years.” Practically the only difference\r\nbetween this bill and the present law is the insertion of\r\n“Japanese.”[345]\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt considered this and the other bills of such serious\r\nimport that he telegraphed to the Governor of the State to use his\r\ninfluence to prevent enactments of this nature. After a long fight the\r\nbill was killed. The legislature made an appropriation for a census of\r\nthe Japanese in California in order to see just how serious the problem\r\nwas.[346]\r\n\r\nThe people along the Canadian Pacific coast are facing a question\r\nsimilar to that in California. A member of the provincial Parliament\r\nfrom Manaimo, British Columbia, has recently given notice that he will\r\nintroduce a measure providing for the exclusion of Oriental children\r\nfrom public schools, declaring that his purpose is to compel the\r\ngovernment to maintain separate schools.[347]\r\n\r\n\r\n         DR. CHARLES W. ELIOT ON SEPARATION OF RACES IN SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe third incident referred to, though not a matter of legislation, did\r\nmuch to focus the attention of the country at large upon the question of\r\nthe separation of the races in schools. The Twentieth Century Club of\r\nBoston met at luncheon on the 14th of February, 1907, to consider the\r\nsituation of Berea College. Dr. Charles W. Eliot, then President of\r\nHarvard University, was one of the speakers. In the course of his\r\nremarks, he said: “If the numbers of whites and blacks were more nearly\r\nequal [in Boston] we might feel like segregating the one from the other\r\nin our own schools. It may be that as large and generous a work can be\r\ndone for the Negro in this way as in mixed schools. So the separation of\r\nthe races in the Berea schools is not really an abandonment of the\r\nprinciple, although it may be a departure from the original purpose.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps if there were as many Negroes here as there we might think it\r\nbetter for them to be in separate schools. At present Harvard has about\r\nfive thousand white students and about thirty of the colored race. The\r\nlatter are hidden in the great mass and are not noticeable. If they were\r\nequal in numbers or in a majority, we might deem a separation\r\nnecessary.”[348]\r\n\r\nThese conservative and guarded words of the head of the University which\r\nhas, above all other American institutions of learning, preserved and\r\nencouraged the “open-door policy” toward students of all races, struck\r\nconsternation to the radicals of both the white and colored races in the\r\nNorth and East, and gladdened the hearts of many of the South and West\r\nwho are facing their own race problems. One side felt that it had lost\r\nan illustrious standard-bearer; the other, that it had won a strong\r\nally.\r\n\r\nThese three incidents show that the separation of the races in schools\r\nis a live question, worthy of an investigation. It is probable that\r\nthere are many private and public schools outside of the South which do\r\nnot, in fact, admit colored students. Probably there are schools which\r\nwould close their doors to white applicants. It may be that there are\r\nactual discriminations against one or the other race in those schools\r\nwhich claim to make no distinction on account of race or color. But many\r\nsuch matters as these have not come under the eye of the law, and so\r\nhave no place here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SEPARATION BEFORE 1865\r\n\r\nAlthough one need not consider in detail the laws separating the races\r\nin schools before the Civil War, because the public school system then\r\nwas poorly developed, as a rule, and the Negro had not attained the\r\nrights of a citizen in many States, still it is well to look into some\r\nof the antebellum statutes and decisions to find precedents for later\r\nstatutes and rulings of the courts upon this subject.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, prior to 1848, no provision was made for the public education\r\nof colored children, and the property of colored persons was not taxed\r\nfor school purposes. In fact, a law[349] of February 10, 1829, expressly\r\nexcluded black and mulattoes from the public schools. In 1834, the child\r\nof a man three-quarters white and of a white woman was denied admission\r\nto a public school. In a case[350] arising out of it, the court held\r\nthat a child with more than one-half white blood is entitled to the\r\nprivilege of the whites, saying: “We think the term white as used in the\r\nlaw describes _blood_ and not _complexion_.... The plaintiff’s children,\r\ntherefore, are white within the meaning of the law, though the\r\ndefendants have had the shabby meanness to ask from him his contribution\r\nof tax, and exclude his children from the benefit of the school he\r\nhelped to support.”\r\n\r\nIn 1848, a law[351] of the same State provided for the levy of a tax\r\nupon the property of colored persons for the support of colored schools,\r\nif the objection was made to the admission of colored children into\r\nwhite schools. It prohibited the application of any part of the tax paid\r\nby white persons to the support of colored schools unless the whites\r\nassented thereto. A law having so many options was objectionable and was\r\nrepealed within a year. The next year, 1849, a statute[352] was enacted\r\nwith regard to the education of colored children, but this appropriated\r\nto the colored schools only the funds arising from taxes paid by colored\r\npersons. The year before the white patron of a school had brought an\r\naction against the directors because they erroneously admitted colored\r\nchildren to the school, thus contriving, he said, “to deprive him of the\r\nbenefit” of sending his children to the school. The court[353] ruled\r\nthat the directors were not liable because they did not act with corrupt\r\nmotives, but had simply misjudged the law.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1849 gave rise to a difficulty. The Constitution of Ohio, by\r\nrestricting the electorate to white persons, had provided that those\r\nentrusted with any power connected with the government of the State\r\nshould be white persons. Are school directors entrusted with any\r\ngovernmental power? The court[354] held that they are not, in the sense\r\nof the Constitution, and that colored persons might be directors of\r\ncolored schools. A statute[355] of 1853 repealed that of 1849 and\r\nprovided for a division of the public school funds in proportion to the\r\nnumber of children of school age, regardless of color. But separate\r\nschools were still maintained. Under this law, it was held[356] that the\r\nchildren of three-eighths African and five-eighths white blood, who were\r\ndistinctly colored and generally treated and regarded as colored\r\nchildren by the community wherein they resided, should not be, as of\r\nright, entitled to admission into white schools.[357] In 1841, it had\r\nbeen held that a youth of Negro, Indian, and white blood, but of more\r\nthan half white blood, was entitled to the benefit of the school fund.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana,[358] in 1850, the public school law provided for a tax levy\r\nfor the support of the schools, but omitted “all Negroes and mulattoes”\r\nfrom the tax list. Some colored children applied for admission, not as\r\nbeneficiaries of the public school fund, but offering to pay their own\r\ntuition. The court[359] of that State held that they could not be\r\nreceived if the resident parents of white children attending or desiring\r\nto attend the school objected, saying: “This [the exclusion of the\r\ncolored children] has not been done because they do not need education,\r\nnor because their wealth was such as to render aid undesirable, but\r\nbecause black children were deemed unfit associates of white, as school\r\ncompanions. Now, surely, this reason operates with equal force against\r\nsuch children attending the schools at their own, as at the public\r\nexpense.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of Roberts v. The City of Boston,[360] which was argued\r\nbefore the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1849, in which Charles\r\nSumner was counsel for the plaintiff, the court gives the following\r\ninteresting information: “The colored population of Boston constitute\r\nless than one sixty-second part of the entire population of the city.\r\nFor half a century, separate schools have been kept in Boston for\r\ncolored children, and the primary school for colored children in Belknap\r\nstreet was established in 1820, and has been kept there ever since. The\r\nteachers of this school have the same compensation and qualifications as\r\nin other like schools in the city. Schools for colored children were\r\noriginally established at the request of colored citizens, whose\r\nchildren could not attend the public schools, on account of the\r\nprejudice then existing against them....\r\n\r\n“In 1846, George Putnam and other colored citizens of Boston petitioned\r\nthe primary school committee that exclusive schools for colored children\r\nmight be abolished, and the committee, on the 22d of June, 1846, adopted\r\nthe report of a sub-committee, and a resolution appended thereto, which\r\nwas in the following words:\r\n\r\n“‘Resolved, that in the opinion of this board, the continuance of the\r\nseparate schools for colored children, and the regular attendance of all\r\nsuch children upon the school, is not only legal and just, but is best\r\nadapted to promote the education of that class of our population.’”\r\n\r\nAt the time of this case, there were one hundred and sixty primary\r\nschools in Boston, of which two were set apart for colored children. The\r\nfacts of the case were these: A colored child applied for admission to a\r\nwhite school on the ground that the colored primary school was one-fifth\r\nof a mile farther from her home. The general school committee refused\r\nher admission, and the colored girl, through her father, sued the city\r\nof Boston. The Supreme Court upheld the power of the committee to\r\nprovide separate schools for colored children and prohibit their\r\nattendance at other schools. The court also said: “It is urged, that\r\nthis maintenance of separate schools tends to deepen and perpetuate the\r\nodious distinction of caste, founded in a deep-rooted prejudice in\r\npublic opinion. This prejudice, if it exists, is not created by law, and\r\nprobably cannot be changed by law. Whether this distinction and\r\nprejudice, existing in the opinion and feelings of the community, would\r\nnot be as effectually fostered by compelling colored and white children\r\nto associate together in the same schools, may well be doubted; at all\r\nevents, it is a fair and proper question for the committee to consider\r\nand decide upon, having in view the best interests of both classes of\r\nchildren placed under their superintendence, and we cannot say, that\r\ntheir decision upon it is not founded on just grounds of reason and\r\nexperience, and in the results of a discriminating and honest judgment.”\r\nThis line of argument is familiar to those who have studied the\r\ndecisions of Southern courts upon the separation of the races in\r\nschools, in public conveyances, hotels, theatres, and other public\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the courts and legislatures of Indiana, Ohio, and\r\nMassachusetts, not one of which is a Southern State, toward the\r\nassociation of white and colored school children shows that there was\r\nample precedent for the laws of the postbellum period. It is probable\r\nthat a careful examination of the annual statutes of the other States\r\nbefore 1865 would reveal that separation was required in them also; that\r\nis, where any provision at all was made for the public instruction of\r\nNegroes. For instance, the law in Delaware[361] in 1852 was that the\r\npublic school should be free to all white children of the district over\r\nfive years old. The inference to be drawn is that colored children were\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n             PRESENT EXTENT OF SEPARATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_a_) _In South_\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of general knowledge that white and colored children are\r\nnot permitted to attend the same public schools in the South. The\r\nseparation is required both by State Constitutions and statutes.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutions of Alabama of 1875[362] and 1901[363] provide for a\r\nsystem of public schools, but add that separate schools must be\r\nmaintained for white and colored children. The laws[364] of 1868 have\r\nthis provision: “In no case shall it be lawful to unite in one school\r\nboth colored and white children, unless it be by the unanimous consent\r\nof the parents and guardians of such children; but said trustees shall\r\nin all other cases provide separate schools for both white and colored\r\nchildren.” The separation is also required in the laws of 1878[365] and\r\n1884.[366]\r\n\r\nArkansas has no constitutional provision as to separation, but an\r\nact[367] of 1867 reads: “No Negro or mulatto shall be permitted to\r\nattend any public school in this State, except such schools as may be\r\nestablished exclusively for colored persons.” And a statute of 1873[368]\r\ndeclares that the board of education must provide separate schools.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution[369] of Florida of 1887 provides that white and colored\r\nchildren shall not be taught in the same school, but that impartial\r\nprovision shall be made for both. A statute[370] of 1895, which will be\r\nconsidered later, makes it a penal offence to educate white and Negro\r\nchildren in the same schools, whether public or private or parochial.\r\n\r\nUnder a Georgia statute[371] of 1866, any free white citizen between the\r\nages of six and twenty-one years and any disabled and indigent soldier\r\nof the State under the age of thirty might have instruction in the\r\nschools free of charge. This would seem to leave out the colored\r\nchildren. But the Constitution[372] of 1877 requires separate schools;\r\nso do the laws of 1872.[373]\r\n\r\nThe laws of Kentucky[374] of 1870 provided that it should be the duty of\r\nthe trustees of the common schools of that State to invite and encourage\r\nindigent white children in the district to attend the school, and to\r\ninform them and their parents that such was their right for which the\r\nState paid, though they themselves might contribute toward paying the\r\nexpenses of the school. The annual report of the trustees must always\r\nshow that this duty had been performed; and no arrangement should be\r\nmade for the benefit of some individuals of this description to the\r\nexclusion of others. Again, apparently no provision was made for the\r\ncolored children, but the Constitution[375] of 1891 declares that in the\r\ndistribution of the school fund no distinction shall be made on account\r\nof race or color, but that separate schools must be maintained. The\r\nstatute[376] of 1904, under which the Berea College case arose, applies\r\nto both public and private schools and requires a separation of the\r\nraces in both.\r\n\r\nThe government of Louisiana was early in the hands of the\r\nReconstructionists, as its statutes show. The Constitution[377] of 1868\r\nsaid: “There shall be no separate schools or institutions of learning\r\nestablished exclusively for any race by the State of Louisiana.” A\r\nseparation of the races in schools had been required by the\r\nConstitutions of 1845[378] and 1852,[379] which makes this provision of\r\nthe Constitution of 1868 all the more significant. In 1871 provision was\r\nmade for an institution for the instruction of the blind, and an\r\nindustrial home for the blind at Baton Rouge. The statute[380] relative\r\nto these concluded thus: “... no part of this act shall be construed so\r\nas to deprive any person on account of race or color of the privilege of\r\nadmittance to the institution.” A law[381] of 1875 which established an\r\nagricultural and mechanical college provided that there should be no\r\ndiscrimination of race or color in the admission, management, or\r\ndiscipline of the institution. The Constitution of 1879 did not\r\nexpressly prohibit the separation of the races in schools, as that of\r\n1868 had done, but on the other hand it did not require separation. It\r\nseems, rather, to have left the matter in the hands of the legislature.\r\nThe first reference made to separate schools was in 1880, when a\r\nuniversity was established for the education of persons of color, called\r\nthe Southern University, four of the twelve trustees of which were to be\r\nNegroes.[382] Finally, the Constitution[383] of 1898 requires the\r\ngeneral assembly to establish free public schools for the white and\r\ncolored races.\r\n\r\nA Maryland statute[384] of 1870 declared that all the taxes paid for\r\nschool purposes by the colored people in any county or in the city of\r\nBaltimore, together with donations for that purpose, should be set aside\r\nfor maintaining schools for colored children. The school commissioners\r\nwere given power to make further appropriations as they should deem\r\nproper to assist the colored schools. A law[385] of 1872 provided that\r\nthe school commissioners should establish one or more public schools in\r\neach election district for colored children, which must be kept open as\r\nlong as the other public schools of the county were kept open. They are\r\nsubject to the same laws and must furnish instruction in the same\r\nbranches as the white schools. The taxes paid for school purposes by\r\ncolored persons must be devoted to the maintenance of colored schools.\r\nThis is the Maryland law,[386] in substance, as it exists at present,\r\nexcept that a separate school does not have to be provided in each\r\nelection district unless the colored population in that district\r\nwarrants the board in establishing a colored school. Where there are not\r\nenough Negroes in a district to have a school of their own, presumably,\r\nthey go to the colored schools in neighboring districts.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1878 a statute of Mississippi[387] provided that schools\r\nshould be arranged in each county so as to afford ample free school\r\nfacilities for all educable youths in the county, prohibiting the\r\nteaching of white and colored pupils in the same school-house, and the\r\nConstitution[388] of 1890 reiterated this requirement of separation. The\r\ncounty school boards are given power to locate one or more schools for\r\nIndians in counties where there are enough Indians to form a\r\nschool.[389]\r\n\r\nMissouri seems not to have lost an opportunity to express its belief in\r\nseparate schools for the races. The Constitution[390] of 1865 made that\r\nrequirement, adding that the school fund must be appropriated in\r\nproportion to the number of children without regard to color. Such\r\nseparation is required by the laws of 1865,[391] of 1868,[392] of\r\n1869,[393] by the Constitution of 1875,[394] and by a law of 1889,[395]\r\nwhich last made it unlawful for colored children to attend a white\r\nschool, or white children, a colored school.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of North Carolina[396] of 1875 declares that “the\r\nchildren of the white and the children of the colored shall be taught in\r\nseparate public schools, but there shall be no discrimination made in\r\nfavor of, or to the prejudice of either race.” According to the\r\nstatute[397] of 1901, a child descended from a Negro to the third\r\ngeneration inclusive should not attend a white school. This was\r\namended[398] in 1903 to the effect that no child with Negro blood in his\r\nveins, “however remote the strain,” shall attend a school for the white\r\nrace. The present statute[399] also provides that the descendants of\r\nCroatan Indians now living in Robeson and Richmond counties shall have\r\nseparate schools for their children. It will be remembered that it is\r\nthe Croatan Indians who are prohibited from intermarrying with Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Oklahoma[400] had the following peculiar arrangement\r\nfor separate schools till 1901: In each county an election was held\r\nevery three years at which all the qualified school electors could vote\r\nfor or against the maintenance of separate schools in that county. If a\r\nmajority voted against separation, then the white and colored children\r\nmight attend the same school; but if a majority voted for separation\r\nseparate schools had to be provided. In counties which separate schools\r\nwere voted in the schools for whites and blacks had to be equal in\r\nlength of terms and in facilities. Any failure to comply with the law\r\nrendered the act for establishing separate schools void, and immediately\r\nthe schools were opened to both races. In 1901[401] separate schools\r\nwere required all over the Territory. In case the children of one race\r\nin a district did not exceed ten, they were to be transferred to a\r\nschool for their race in another district instead of a separate school\r\nbeing maintained for them, provided the distance was not over two miles\r\nand a half. The white and colored schools were to be furnished with the\r\nsame kind of furniture and equipment. No white teacher should teach in a\r\ncolored school and _vice versa_. The Constitution[402] of the State of\r\nOklahoma, adopted September 17, 1907, provides: “Separate schools for\r\nwhite and colored children, with like accommodation, shall be provided\r\nby the legislature and impartially maintained. The term ‘colored\r\nchildren,’ as used in this section, shall be construed to mean children\r\nof African descent. The term ‘white children’ shall include all other\r\nchildren.” An Oklahoma statute[403] of 1907 requires complete separation\r\nof the races in schools, with impartial facilities for both races. By\r\n“colored children,” it means those that have any “quantum of Negro\r\nblood.” The teacher who knowingly and willingly permits a child of one\r\nrace to be taught in a school for another race is guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor, and may be punished by a fine of between ten and a hundred\r\ndollars and, in addition, may have his certificate cancelled and be\r\nunable to secure another for a year. The separation applies to private\r\nschools and colleges as well as public schools.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina government was, like that of Louisiana, early under\r\nReconstruction. The Constitution[404] of 1868 provided that “all the\r\npublic schools, colleges and universities of this State, supported in\r\nwhole or in part by the public school fund, should be free and open to\r\nall the children and youths of that State, without regard to race or\r\ncolor.” In fact, the University of South Carolina was open to Negroes\r\ndirectly after the War.[405] But the Constitution[406] of 1895 requires\r\nseparate schools, and adds that “no child of either race shall ever be\r\npermitted to attend a school provided for children of the other race.”\r\nThe Negro public schools of the city of Charleston are taught by white\r\npeople, mostly Southern-born white people.\r\n\r\nTennessee, by its laws[407] of 1866, by its Constitution[408] of 1870,\r\nand by its laws[409] of 1873 requires separate public schools for the\r\nwhite and colored children. A statute[410] of 1901 prohibits the\r\nco-education of the white and colored races in private schools.\r\n\r\nThe Texas Constitution[411] of 1876 provided for separate schools and\r\nimpartial accommodations for both races. A school-house constructed in\r\npart by voluntary subscription by colored parents and guardians and for\r\na colored school community shall not be used without their consent for\r\nthe education of white children, and _vice versa_.[412] The separate\r\nschool requirement was repeated in the laws of 1884,[413] 1893,[414] and\r\n1895.[415] The Texas provision is that a school which receives both\r\nwhite and colored pupils shall not receive any of the public school\r\nfund, which amounts to saying that it is not unlawful to educate white\r\nand colored children together in private schools.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Virginia of 1870 did not declare that the races must\r\nbe separated in schools. But statutes of 1882[416] and 1896[417] provide\r\nthat white and colored persons shall not be taught in the same school\r\nbut in separate schools, under the same general regulations as to\r\nmanagement, usefulness, and efficiency. The Virginia Constitution[418]\r\nof 1902 has the terse statement that white and colored children shall\r\nnot be taught in the same school.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (_b_) _In States Outside of South_\r\n\r\nBesides the Southern States, which have just been considered, there are\r\nother States which require or permit a separation of the races in\r\nschools. The separation of the white and Japanese children in the public\r\nschools of San Francisco has already been discussed. That was only a\r\npart of the legislation of California. A statute[419] enacted during the\r\nsession of 1869–70 read: “The education of children of African descent\r\nand Indian children shall be provided for in separate schools. Upon the\r\nwritten application of the parents or guardians of at least ten such\r\nchildren to the board of trustees or board of education, a separate\r\nschool shall be established for the education of such children; and the\r\neducation of a less number may be provided for by the trustees in\r\nseparate schools in any other manner.” In 1874 a Negro child was refused\r\nadmission to a white school in that State. In a test case which arose\r\nthe constitutionality of the statute was supported, the court[420] being\r\nof opinion that the statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment if\r\nappropriate schools for colored children were maintained. But, it added,\r\nunless such separate schools are actually maintained, colored children\r\nmust be admitted to the regular public schools along with the white\r\nchildren. This latter ruling became part of a statute of 1880. Prior to\r\n1880 the law had been that “every school, unless otherwise provided by\r\nlaw, must be open for the admission of all white children....” This was\r\namended in 1880[421] by the omission of the word “white” and by\r\nrepealing the sections providing for Negro and Indian schools. On the\r\nstrength of this amendment, a Negro, upon being refused admission to the\r\nwhite schools, brought suit,[422] and it was held that, as the law\r\nstood, colored children had equal rights with white children to\r\nadmission to any public school, even though separate schools were\r\nmaintained. The court said: “The whole policy of the legislative\r\ndepartment of the government upon this matter is easily gathered from\r\nthe course of legislation shown therein; and there can be no doubt but\r\nthat it was never intended that, as a matter of classification of\r\npupils, the right to establish separate schools for children of African\r\ndescent, and thereby to exclude them from white schools ... should be\r\ngiven to such boards [of education].” It was earlier, in 1872, that the\r\nprovision for separate schools for Mongolians was made. The law of\r\nCalifornia seems now to be that Negro children may attend the same\r\nschools as whites, but Japanese, Chinese, and Korean children must go to\r\nseparate schools if the board of education sees fit to provide them.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Delaware,[423] in 1881, appropriated two thousand\r\nfour hundred dollars annually for the education of colored children. In\r\n1889 three colored schools[424] were incorporated and placed in control\r\nof boards of trustees elected by the voters of the district. These\r\nincorporated schools[425] as such were abolished in 1893, and after that\r\nthey were placed under the supervision of the regular county\r\nsuperintendent just as the other public schools. The same State,[426] in\r\n1898, provided for the establishment of separate kindergartens. Thus,\r\nDelaware is as strict as the Southern States in requiring separate\r\nschools for the races.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Illinois statutes[427] clearly state that any school\r\nofficer who excludes from a public school any child on account of color\r\nshall be fined from five dollars to one hundred dollars for each\r\noffence, and prohibits school directors and officers from excluding,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, children on account of color, still the numerous\r\ncases which have arisen involving the point show that the school\r\nofficers have not always been in thorough agreement with the law.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the school directors of McLean County, Illinois, erected a\r\nseparate school building, twelve by fourteen feet, for the exclusive\r\npurpose of educating the three or four colored children in the district\r\ntherein. It was admitted that there was plenty of room for them in the\r\nregular school building. One of the taxpayers of the district petitioned\r\nfor an injunction against the building of the house, but it was\r\ncompleted before any decision was rendered. In a case which arose later,\r\nthe court[428] held that the school directors had no right to make such\r\na discrimination against Negroes, and that any taxpayer might object. In\r\n1882 the board of education of Quincy, Illinois, divided the city into\r\neight districts and set apart one school for Negroes. A case arising\r\nover this division and segregation, the court[429] ruled that, in the\r\nabsence of State legislation, the board had no power to establish\r\nseparate schools for Negroes. In 1886 the school board of Upper Alton\r\npassed a resolution excluding colored children from the white school\r\nunless they had reached the high school grade. A Negro, whose children\r\nbelow high school grade were refused admission to the white school,\r\nbrought suit, and the court[430] held that the school board had no power\r\nto separate the children on account of color. In 1899 the common council\r\nof Alton established a school for Negroes, but the court[431] held that\r\nthis involved an illegal discrimination against them. The Associated\r\nPress report[432] of November 28, 1906, had the following statement:\r\n“East St. Louis, Ill., Nov. 28, 1906—A large brick building at 1,400\r\nMissouri avenue, which was leased last week by the Board of Education\r\nfor a Negro school, was destroyed by fire to-day, and there is evidence\r\nthat prejudice against the establishment of a school for Negroes caused\r\nthe building to be set on fire. Late last night the building was\r\ndiscovered to be on fire, but prompt action saved it. The firemen found\r\nrags soaked in oil on the second floor hallway. The destruction of the\r\nbuilding to-day makes the second building leased for a Negro school that\r\nhas been burned within the last two weeks.” The latest Illinois case on\r\nthe subject is that of April 23, 1908, The People v. The Mayor, etc., of\r\nAlton.[433] A Negro’s children were excluded from the public school most\r\nconvenient to them and directed to a colored school less convenient. He\r\npetitioned for a writ of _mandamus_ against the mayor and common council\r\nto compel them to admit his children to the most convenient school, and\r\nafter the case had been tried seven times by juries in the circuit\r\ncourt, the writ was finally granted by the Supreme Court. Although all\r\nof these cases were decided against race separation they show that there\r\nis still an appreciable feeling in Illinois against the white and\r\ncolored children being taught in the same schools. The trouble at Alton\r\nis not yet over. After a fourteen years’ fight the Negroes won, as has\r\nbeen seen, before the Supreme Court of the State. But when the Negro\r\nchildren applied for admission to the public schools, they were again\r\nrefused. Before the schools were opened for the session of 1908–09, many\r\nof the Negroes were visited and induced to send their children to the\r\nfour Negro schools built in Alton. But forty other Negroes filed a\r\npetition for a writ of _mandamus_ against the mayor and council of Alton\r\nseeking to have them answer why they refused to obey the mandate of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State.[434]\r\n\r\nA statute[435] of Indiana of 1869 required the trustees of schools to\r\norganize separate but equal schools for Negroes. If there were not\r\nenough Negroes in the district for a school, two or more districts might\r\nbe consolidated for that purpose. If there were not enough within a\r\nreasonable distance, then the trustees might provide such other means of\r\neducation of colored children as would employ their proportion of the\r\nschool fund to the best advantage. A case[436] testing the\r\nconstitutionality of this law, which arose in 1874, is one of the most\r\nexhaustive cases on the subject. The father of Negro children applied\r\nfor a mandate to compel the admission of them to white schools. The\r\ncourt held that the separation of the races in schools is not in\r\nviolation of the Federal or the State Constitution. The common schools,\r\nit was said, are based upon State legislation, are domestic\r\ninstitutions, and, as such, subject to the exclusive control of the\r\nconstituted authorities of the State. The Federal Constitution does not\r\nprovide for any general system of education to be conducted and\r\ncontrolled by the national government, nor does it vest in Congress any\r\npower to exercise a general or special supervision over the State on the\r\nsubject of education. Under the Constitution of Indiana the common\r\nschool system must be general, uniform, and equally open to all, but\r\nuniformity will be secured where all schools of the same grade have the\r\nsame system of government and discipline, the same branches of learning\r\ntaught, and the same qualifications for admission. The court said: “In\r\nour opinion the classification of scholars on the basis of race or\r\ncolor, and their education in separate schools, involve questions of\r\ndomestic policy which are within the legislative discretion and control,\r\nand do not amount to an exclusion of either class ... there would be as\r\nmuch lawful reason for complaint by one scholar in the same school that\r\nhe could not occupy the seat of another scholar therein at the same time\r\nthe latter occupied it, or by scholars in different classes in the same\r\nschool, that they were not placed in the same class, or by scholars in\r\ndifferent schools, that they were not all placed in the same school, as\r\nthere is that black and white children are placed in distinct classes\r\nand taught in separate schools.”\r\n\r\nIn 1877, the Indiana law of 1869 was amended[437] so that the school\r\ndirectors _might_ (not _must_) organize separate schools for the races.\r\nIn case a colored school was not provided, the colored children should\r\nbe allowed to attend the regular white school. When the colored child\r\nhad reached a grade higher than that taught in the colored school, he\r\nmust be admitted to the regular high school, and no distinction therein\r\nshould be made on account of race or color. In 1882, there were only\r\nabout six Negro children in a certain district, and the trustees were\r\nindicted for not establishing a separate school for them. The court[438]\r\nruled that it was impracticable to maintain a separate school for so\r\nsmall a number. In 1883, a Negro pupil brought suit on the ground that\r\nhe was not admitted to the white high school, under the law of 1877, but\r\nhe did not show that he had passed the required examination. The\r\ncourt[439] held that the discretion as to the competency of the child is\r\na matter for the board of education, not the court.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Iowa have not since 1865 required or permitted a separation\r\nof the races in schools. In 1868, a Negro girl, denied admission to the\r\ngraded schools of Muscatine, brought suit, and the court[440] gave\r\nrelief, saying that the school directors could not require Negroes to\r\nattend separate schools; that if separate schools for Negroes are\r\nprescribed, the same might as well be done for German, Irish, and French\r\nchildren. The same principle has been affirmed in subsequent decisions\r\nwhich show that there have been instances in that State of school boards\r\ntrying to separate the races.[441]\r\n\r\nBy the statutes[442] of Kansas of 1868 the boards of education of cities\r\nof the first class—that is, cities of over 150,000 inhabitants—had the\r\n“power to organize and maintain separate schools for the education of\r\nwhite and colored children.” This power was omitted in a revision of the\r\nschool law[443] in 1876, and consequently repealed by implication. But\r\nin 1879 a statute[444] was passed amending the school law, which revived\r\nthe power to separate the races in cities of the first class “except in\r\nthe high school, where no discrimination shall be made on account of\r\ncolor.” The constitutionality of this statute was upheld by the Supreme\r\nCourt[445] of Kansas in 1903, and again in 1909. The State has not given\r\nthis power of separation to cities of the second class, so the\r\ncourts[446] have held that, except in cities of the first class, the\r\ncolored children must be admitted to the schools along with the white\r\nchildren. The Superintendent of Public Schools of Kansas,[447] in\r\nAugust, 1906, said: “There is a movement in Kansas looking toward the\r\nsegregation of the races in the public schools, where the per cent. of\r\ncolored population will warrant the separation.”\r\n\r\nA law[448] of Nevada of 1865 excluded Negroes, Mongolians, and Indians\r\nfrom the public schools, and prescribed as a punishment to the school\r\nopening its doors to all races a withdrawal of its share of the public\r\nschool fund. The school officials might, however, if they deemed it\r\nadvisable, establish a separate school for the children of Negroes,\r\nMongolians, and Indians, to be supported out of the public school fund.\r\nIn 1872 it was held[449] that a _mandamus_ would lie compelling trustees\r\nto admit colored persons to the public schools where separate schools\r\nwere not provided for such persons. No subsequent reference to the\r\nsubject appears in the statutes or reports, so it may be assumed that\r\nseparate schools no longer exist in Nevada.\r\n\r\nA statute[450] of New Jersey of 1881 made it unlawful to exclude anyone\r\nfrom the public school on account of “religion, nationality, or color.”\r\nThe town of Burlington had four public schools, one of which had been\r\nset apart for Negroes. A Negro petitioned for a writ of _mandamus_ to\r\ncompel the trustees to admit his children to the white schools, and the\r\ncourt[451] issued the writ. About four years ago the public schools of\r\nEast Orange, New Jersey, adopted the policy of teaching the Negro pupils\r\nin separate classes; but it was soon abandoned because, the school\r\nauthorities said, “it seemed like going back to old ideas.”[452]\r\n\r\nThe city of Buffalo, New York, under a provision of its charter,\r\nestablished separate schools for Negroes, and this action was upheld by\r\nthe court[453] on the ground that the right to attend common schools is\r\na legislative grant and not a constitutional guarantee. The city of\r\nAlbany also set apart one school for Negroes, and this was held[454]\r\nconstitutional in 1872. And in 1883, the Supreme Court[455] of that\r\nState held that, if separate schools are provided for colored children,\r\nthey may be excluded from the white schools. In 1899, the same was\r\nheld[456] for the Borough of Queens. These decisions were under the law\r\nof 1864,[457] reënacted in 1894,[458] which gave power to the school\r\nauthorities of cities and incorporated villages, when they deemed it\r\nexpedient, to establish separate schools. But this law was repealed in\r\n1900,[459] and the present law reads: “No person shall be refused\r\nadmission to or be excluded from any public school in the State of New\r\nYork on account of race or color.”\r\n\r\nAn Ohio statute[460] of 1878 gave the boards of education discretionary\r\npower to establish separate schools for Negroes. This law was repealed\r\nin 1887,[461] and thereafter all public schools were open to colored\r\nchildren.[462]\r\n\r\nIn 1869, persons of color were not admitted to the subdistrict schools\r\nof Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,[463] but this law was repealed in 1872.[464]\r\nAn earlier statute of 1854 had provided for separate schools for Negroes\r\nwhere there were more than twenty in the district. The school directors\r\nof Wilkesbarre had united two districts, each having less than twenty\r\ncolored children, and put up a school building for Negroes; but the\r\ncourt[465] held that this was in violation of the law of 1854. This law\r\nwas repealed in 1881,[466] and it was thereafter unlawful to make any\r\ndistinction whatever on account of race or color. The next year, it was\r\nheld[467] that the school directors could not keep open schools for\r\nNegroes exclusively.\r\n\r\nA West Virginia law[468] of 1865 required the boards of education to\r\nestablish separate schools for Negroes where there were more than thirty\r\nchildren of that race in the district. But if the average daily\r\nattendance was less than fifteen for a month, the school should be\r\ndiscontinued for any period not exceeding six months. If there were less\r\nthan thirty children in the district or the attendance was less than\r\nfifteen, the money should be reserved and used for colored education as\r\nthe board thought best. A statute[469] of 1871 and the Constitution[470]\r\nof 1872 provided that white and colored persons should not be taught\r\ntogether. A separate school for Negroes must be established when the\r\nnumber in the district exceeds twenty-five. If less, the trustees of two\r\nor more districts may establish a joint school. The Supreme Court[471]\r\nof that State has held that the constitutional provision requiring\r\nseparate schools does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, but that the\r\nterms of the schools of both races must be of the same length. Thus,\r\nWest Virginia is as strict as Virginia or any Southern State in\r\nseparating the races in schools.\r\n\r\nWyoming has the following statute[472]: “When there are fifteen or more\r\ncolored children within any school district, the board of directors\r\nthereof, with the approval of the county superintendent of schools, may\r\nprovide a separate school for the instruction of such colored children.”\r\n\r\nThe statutes[473] of Arizona, until 1909, declared that no child should\r\nbe refused admission to any public school on account of race or color.\r\nLast year, however, the school law of that Territory was amended[474] so\r\nas to give the board of trustees of school districts power, when they\r\ndeem it advisable, to segregate pupils of the African from pupils of the\r\nwhite race and to provide all accommodations made necessary by such\r\nsegregation, but the power to segregate shall be exercised only where\r\nthe number of pupils of the African race shall exceed eight in any\r\nschool district. This amendment was passed over the Governor’s veto by a\r\ntwo-thirds’ vote of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutions of Colorado[475] of 1876 and of Idaho[476] of 1889\r\nprovide that no distinction or classification of pupils shall be made on\r\naccount of race or color, and the judicial decisions of those States do\r\nnot show any attempts by the school boards to draw color lines.\r\n\r\nSeparate schools were abolished by law in Massachusetts in 1857.[477]\r\nThe present statute[478] declares that no child shall be excluded from a\r\npublic school of any city or town on account of race or color. In\r\npractice, the matter is not entirely at rest in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe law[479] of Michigan prohibits the segregation of the races in\r\nschools. Because of objections made by white students, two Negroes,[480]\r\nin 1908, were refused admission to the Grand Rapids, Michigan, Medical\r\nCollege, a private institution. The Negroes appealed to the State\r\ncircuit court, which issued a writ of _mandamus_ compelling the school\r\nto admit them. When this was granted and they were accordingly admitted,\r\nthirty-four members of the junior class of the school “struck,” and the\r\nauthorities suspended the class for a time. The Supreme Court[481] of\r\nMichigan later reversed the order granting the writ of _mandamus_,\r\nsaying that a private institution of learning, though incorporated, has\r\na right to say whom it will receive.\r\n\r\nA statute[482] of Minnesota declares that a district shall not classify\r\nits pupils with reference to race or color, nor separate them into\r\ndifferent schools or departments upon such grounds. The punishment for\r\nviolation of this law by a district is a forfeiture of its share of the\r\npublic school fund so long as the classification or separation\r\ncontinues. The Territory of New Mexico[483] makes it a misdemeanor for a\r\nteacher or school director to exclude any child on account of race or\r\nnationality, under penalty of a fine from fifty dollars to one hundred\r\ndollars and three months imprisonment, and being forever barred from\r\nteaching school or holding any office of profit or honor in the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe separation of the races in public schools is required by the\r\nConstitutions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,\r\nVirginia, and West Virginia. Complete separation is required by statute\r\nin all of the above-named States and, besides those, also in Arkansas,\r\nMaryland, and Delaware. A discretionary power is given to the school\r\nboards to establish separate schools in Arizona; in Indiana; in\r\nCalifornia, as to schools for Indians, Chinese, and Mongolians; in\r\nKansas, in cities of over 150,000 inhabitants; and in Wyoming, in\r\ndistricts having fifteen or more colored pupils. The following States\r\nthat once had separate schools now prohibit them: Illinois,\r\nMassachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In\r\naddition to these, separate schools are not allowed in Colorado, Idaho,\r\nIowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Rhode Island. There are other\r\nStates which have never seen fit to make any mention one way or the\r\nother of race distinctions in schools, either in statutes or court\r\nreports; so one is warranted in inferring that the schools are open to\r\nall. They are Connecticut, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota,\r\nOregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Washington.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, public education is distinctly a State\r\nfunction. The Federal government, in the main, has not undertaken to\r\nhave anything to do with it, but Congress, by its exclusive\r\njurisdiction, has supreme control over the public schools of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and the provisions that it has made there for the\r\nseparation of the races show in an interesting way the attitude of the\r\nnational government upon the subject. A statute[484] of 1864 reads:\r\n“That any white resident of said county shall be privileged to place his\r\nor her child or ward at any one of the schools provided for the\r\neducation of white children in said county he or she may think proper to\r\nselect, with the consent of the trustees of both districts; and any\r\ncolored resident shall have the same rights with respect to colored\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n“That it shall be the duty of said commissioners to provide suitable and\r\nconvenient houses or rooms for holding schools for colored children....”\r\nThe commissioner might impose a tax of fifty cents _per capita_ upon the\r\npatrons of the school to aid in its support, but no child should be\r\nexcluded because its parents or guardians could not pay the tax. The\r\nschool fund was to be divided in proportion to the number of school\r\nchildren, regardless of race.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 an increase of the Federal appropriation[485] to schools was\r\naccompanied with the following proviso: “That no money shall be paid out\r\nunder this act to any State or Territory for the support or maintenance\r\nof a college where a distinction of race or color is made on the\r\nadmission of students, but the establishment and maintenance of such\r\ncolleges separately for white and colored students shall be held to be a\r\ncompliance with the provisions of the act, if the funds received in such\r\nState or territory be equitably divided as hereinafter set forth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SEPARATION IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThus far, except in the matter of Berea College, the separation of the\r\nraces in private schools only has been considered. Legislation as to\r\nprivate schools is comparatively meagre. A statute[486] of Florida of\r\n1895 makes it a penal offence to conduct a school of any grade—public,\r\nprivate, or parochial—wherein white persons and Negroes are instructed\r\nor boarded within the same building, or taught in the same class, or at\r\nthe same time by the same teacher. The punishment for violating the law\r\nby patronizing or teaching in such a school is a fine of from one\r\nhundred and fifty to five hundred dollars, or imprisonment from three to\r\nsix months. A statute[487] of Tennessee of 1901 makes it lawful for any\r\nschool, academy, or other place of learning to receive both white and\r\ncolored pupils at the same time. It is unlawful for any teacher to allow\r\nthem to attend the same school or to teach them together or to allow\r\nthem to be taught together, under a penalty of fifty dollars for each\r\noffence and imprisonment from thirty days to six months. The most recent\r\nstatute on the subject of private schools is that of Oklahoma in 1908.\r\nIt is plainly modeled after the Kentucky law of 1904. Under the Oklahoma\r\nstatute,[488] it is unlawful for a person, corporation, or association\r\nof persons to maintain or operate any college, school, or institution\r\nwhere persons of the white and colored races are both received as pupils\r\nfor instruction. The person, corporation, or association that operates a\r\nschool in violation of the statute is guilty of a misdemeanor, and may\r\nbe fined not less than one hundred nor more than five hundred dollars.\r\nEach day such a school is kept open is a separate offence. One who\r\nteaches in such a school is guilty of a misdemeanor and may be fined\r\nfrom ten to fifty dollars for each day. One who goes to such a school as\r\na pupil may be fined from five to twenty dollars for each day. It is not\r\nunlawful, however, for a private school to maintain a separate and\r\ndistinct branch thereof “in a different locality.” The Kentucky statute,\r\nit will be remembered, required the separate branch to be, at least,\r\ntwenty-five miles from the main school. The Oklahoma legislature\r\ndeclared that it was necessary “for the immediate preservation of the\r\npublic peace, health, and safety” that this act take effect at once.\r\n\r\nFlorida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are the only States that\r\nexpressly prohibit the teaching of white and colored persons in the same\r\nprivate school. Other States—as Georgia and Texas—declare that, if a\r\nschool admits both races, it shall have none of the public school fund,\r\nsaying, by implication, that one may operate a school for both races if\r\nhe will give up his claim to State aid. On the other hand, Minnesota has\r\nenacted a statute to the effect that, if a school refuses to admit\r\npupils of both races, it shall have none of the public school fund, thus\r\nsaying, by implication, that it is not unlawful to conduct a private\r\nschool exclusively for one race. The recent decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Michigan to the effect that a private school may exclude\r\nNegroes even though the law of the State requires public schools to be\r\nopen to all, regardless of race or color, has been considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       EQUALITY OF ACCOMMODATIONS\r\n\r\nIn general, the “accommodations, advantages, and facilities” of schools\r\nfor Negroes are to be equal to those for white children, but the\r\nrequirement has, in many cases, been loosely construed. It has been held\r\nin Missouri[489] and Ohio,[490] for instance, that it is not an unjust\r\ndiscrimination for the colored children to have to walk farther to\r\nschool than the white children. The Supreme Court[491] of Kansas in 1903\r\ndecided that uniformity of schools for white and colored children did\r\nnot require equality of buildings. The court said: “True, for the\r\naccommodation of a numerous white population a much larger and more\r\nimposing school building is provided than that set apart for the few\r\ncolored children in the district. This, however, is but an incidental\r\nmatter, and necessarily unavoidable in the administration of any\r\nextended school system. School-houses cannot be identical in every\r\nrespect; but parents cannot, on this account, dictate the one their\r\nchildren shall attend.”\r\n\r\nThe County Board of Education of Richmond County, Georgia, in 1880,\r\nestablished a high school for Negroes, but in 1897 it was discontinued\r\nfor economic reasons, because the money to educate fifty or sixty\r\nNegroes in the high school would give the rudiments of education to two\r\nhundred of the four hundred young Negroes in the county who were crowded\r\nout. It was understood that the school would be re-opened as soon as\r\neconomic considerations permitted. A Negro brought suit against the\r\nboard for discrimination against his race in that the white high school\r\nto which the Board made contributions had not been closed also. The\r\nSupreme Court of that State held[492] that the Board had the right to\r\nestablish or discontinue high schools when the interests and convenience\r\nof the people require it. There were more white children of the\r\nhigh-school grade than colored; therefore, the court argued, the Board\r\nwas justified in continuing the white high school. The case was appealed\r\nto the Supreme Court[493] of the United States, which affirmed the\r\ndecision of the State court. Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion\r\nof the court, said: “... while all admit that the benefits and burdens\r\nof public taxation must be shared by the citizens without discrimination\r\nagainst any class on account of their race, the education of the people\r\nin the schools maintained by State taxation is a matter belonging to the\r\nrespective States, and any interference on the part of the Federal\r\nauthority with the management of such schools cannot be justified except\r\nin the case of clear and unmistakable disregard of rights secured by the\r\nsupreme law of the land.”\r\n\r\nIn general, where separate schools are required, it is said that they\r\nmust be equal for both races; but it has been held that it is not an\r\nunjust discrimination to build more imposing school-houses for the many\r\nwhite children than for the few colored children; to require the\r\nchildren of one race to walk farther to school than the other, or to\r\nmaintain high schools for one race without doing so for the other. Only\r\na very few States have escaped altogether the question of the separation\r\nof the races in schools. Even where the State statutes have declared\r\npoint-blank by statute that there shall be no distinction on account of\r\nrace or color, the suits that have arisen in those States show that the\r\nschool boards have tried to evade the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DIVISION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL FUND\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that the Negro has had and is now getting much\r\nmore than his share of the public school fund. It is said that the Negro\r\nis getting nearly half the money, while he is paying only a very small\r\npercentage of the taxes. Thus, the following is the estimate of Mr. J.\r\nY. Joyner, Superintendent of Public Instruction of North Carolina: “Upon\r\nthe most liberal estimate, it seems that in 1908 the Negroes received\r\nfor the maintenance of their public schools in North Carolina about\r\ntwice as much as they paid directly or indirectly for this purpose. I\r\nthink that this is about in accordance with the experience and\r\nobservation of those familiar with the administration of the public\r\nschools in North Carolina. My own opinion is that the white people pay,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, for the education of the Negro more rather than\r\nless than one dollar for every dollar that the Negro pays, directly or\r\nindirectly for that purpose.” Mr. J. D. Eggleston, Jr., Superintendent\r\nof Public Instruction of Virginia, estimates that the public school fund\r\nfor Negroes in that State is $500,000, of which the Negro pays $87,000,\r\nor less than one-fifth.[494]\r\n\r\nThere have been fitful efforts from time to time to divide the public\r\nschool fund in proportion to the amount of taxes paid by each race. The\r\nmost recent and thorough-going effort[495] to have the school fund so\r\napportioned was made by Ex-Governor James K. Vardaman, of Mississippi.\r\nBut his effort, like that of those before him, came to naught. The white\r\ntaxpayers of the South have not shown any very evident desire to\r\nwithdraw their financial aid from the colored public schools. But there\r\nhas been enough legislation on different phases of the question of the\r\napportionment of the school money to deserve attention.\r\n\r\nIn Alabama,[496] in 1896, all poll tax money paid by colored persons\r\nwent to the support of colored schools, and all that paid by white\r\npersons, to the support of white schools. The present Code apparently\r\ndoes not require this separation of taxes; but in the provisions for\r\nspecial tax districts[497] for school purposes, the law provides that\r\nthe amount paid by whites and blacks shall be kept separate, presumably\r\nmeaning that the funds arising from special taxation shall be\r\napportioned according to the amount paid by each race. Though Delaware\r\nusually makes an annual appropriation for colored schools, nevertheless\r\nin 1875,[498] and again in 1887,[499] it provided for a tax of thirty\r\ncents on the hundred dollars upon the property of colored persons for\r\nthe maintenance of colored schools.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of Kentucky with regard to the raising and apportionment\r\nof its public school fund has been unique. In 1866,[500] all capitation\r\ntaxes paid by Negroes and, in addition, a tax of two dollars _per\r\ncapita_ upon Negroes went toward the support of their paupers and the\r\neducation of their children. In 1869,[501] a vote was taken upon the\r\npropriety of levying a tax of fifteen cents on the hundred dollars upon\r\nthe property of white persons for the support of white schools\r\nexclusively. In 1873,[502] a property tax of twenty cents on the hundred\r\ndollars and a poll tax of one dollar were levied upon Negroes of\r\nMcCracken County for the maintenance of their schools. The same method\r\nof taxation was adopted for Bowling Green[503] and Catlettsburg[504] and\r\nGarrard County.[505] As to the last-mentioned place, there was a\r\nprovision that in the county white and colored school-houses must be not\r\nless than a half mile apart, and in towns not less than eight hundred\r\nfeet. In Bracken County[506] a special tax of twenty-five cents on the\r\nhundred dollars was levied upon the property of whites for their\r\nschools, not applying to Negroes at all. The constitutionality[507] of\r\nthis law was upheld by the Supreme Court of Kentucky on the ground that\r\nwhatever benefits the Negro is entitled to under the school system he\r\nreceives as a citizen of Kentucky, not as a citizen of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, the same State[508] provided for a uniform system of schools\r\nfor Negroes. The sources of the revenue for the schools were (1) a tax\r\nof twenty cents on the hundred dollars upon the property of Negroes, (2)\r\ntheir poll taxes, (3) their dog taxes, (4) taxes on deeds, suits and\r\nlicenses collected from colored persons, (5) fines, penalties, and\r\nforfeitures collected from them, (6) sums received from Congress,\r\nprovided the apportionment to each colored child did not exceed that to\r\neach white child, and (7) gifts, donations, and grants. Colored\r\nschool-houses must not be erected within one mile of a white\r\nschool-house in the country and six hundred feet in towns. In 1880,\r\nOwensboro[509] was authorized to levy a tax of thirty cents on the\r\nhundred dollars and two dollars on the poll upon Negroes for colored\r\nschools, provided the Negroes voted to tax themselves for this purpose.\r\nThis law was held[510] unconstitutional by the Federal district court in\r\n1883, the court saying: “If taxes can be distributed according to color\r\nor race classification, no good reason why a division might not be made\r\naccording to the amount paid by each taxpayer, and thus limit the\r\nbenefits and distribute the protection of the laws by a classification\r\nbased upon the wealth of the taxpayer. Such distribution would entirely\r\nignore the spirit of our republican institutions and would not be the\r\nequal protection of the laws as understood by the people of the State at\r\nthe time of the adoption of this (the Fourteenth) amendment.” The laws\r\nof Kentucky of 1874 were held[511] unconstitutional in 1885. In 1886,\r\nElkton[512] was authorized to levy a tax of two dollars on the poll and\r\nninety-five cents on the hundred dollars upon Negroes if they voted thus\r\nto tax themselves. Apparently the last act of legislation[513] with\r\nregard to the school fund in Kentucky was in 1904, when provision was\r\nmade for a system of graded schools in cities of the fourth class, but\r\nthe property or polls of one race were not to be taxed for the support\r\nof the schools of the other. A recent Kentucky case has held[514] that,\r\nafter the regular public school fund of the State has been apportioned\r\namong the districts in proportion to the number of children regardless\r\nof race, then it is not improper for a district to supplement that fund\r\nby a tax on the property of white persons for the further support of\r\nwhite schools and upon the property of Negroes for their schools. Thus,\r\nit appears that Kentucky is honeycombed with the special tax districts\r\nwherein each race supports its own schools. Whether this arrangement is\r\nconstitutional or not is still in doubt, as no square decision on the\r\npoint has yet been rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nFor some years North Carolina has been exercising the principle of\r\nlocal, special taxation to supplement the general public school fund. In\r\nseveral instances, about 1886, the communities levied the tax only upon\r\nthe whites for the benefit of white schools, but this was held[515]\r\nunconstitutional by the State Supreme Court, and the attempt to thus\r\ndistinguish between the races does not appear to have been made since.\r\nThe courts of Kentucky and North Carolina are in conflict, due to the\r\ndifferences in the constitutions of those States, on the question of\r\nspecial taxation by each race for its own schools. The local tax\r\ndistricts in North Carolina have recently been increasing at the rate of\r\nabout two a day, but the tax is levied upon colored persons as well as\r\nwhite, and all the schools share the benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Texas[516] of 1866 provided that all taxes collected\r\nfrom Negroes should go to maintain their public schools, and that it\r\nshould be the duty of the legislature to encourage schools among these\r\npeople. This provision, however, does not appear in the later\r\nConstitution of Texas.\r\n\r\nThus, one sees that, here and there, particularly in Kentucky, there are\r\nprecedents for a division of the school fund in proportion to the taxes\r\npaid by each race, but there has not been any general movement in this\r\ndirection. One is justified in concluding that, although the Southern\r\nStates stand steadfastly for race separation in both public and private\r\nschools, they do not desire a division of the public school funds except\r\nin proportion to the number of children of school age. It is true that\r\nthere have been some local legislative acts looking in that direction,\r\nand a few sporadic political movements to the same effect; nevertheless,\r\nthe fact that the local legislation has not become general since the\r\nNegro has been practically eliminated from politics and that the\r\npolitical movements have met with such scanty popular support show that\r\nthe people are satisfied with the present arrangement as to the division\r\nof the school fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Ky., 1904, pp. 181–82.\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  _The Outlook_, vol. 85, pp. 921–23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  _The Nation_, vol. 79, pp. 389–90.\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  94 S.

This arises largely from the\r\nfact that these legislative enactments are of general concern, while the\r\nother legal distinctions have directly affected only certain classes of\r\neach race. Laws prohibiting intermarriage, for instance, concern only\r\nthose of marriageable age; suffrage restrictions apply only to males of\r\nvoting age; and statutes requiring separate schools affect immediately\r\nonly children and youths; but the laws requiring white and colored\r\npassengers to occupy separate seats, compartments, or coaches concern\r\nevery man, woman, and child, who travels, the country over. They affect\r\nnot only those living in the States where the laws are in force, but the\r\nentire traveling public. The white man or the Negro in Massachusetts may\r\nnot care anything about the suffrage restrictions of South Carolina,\r\nbut, if he travels through the South, he must experience the\r\nrequirements of the “Jim Crow” laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ORIGIN OF “JIM CROW”\r\n\r\nThe phrase “Jim Crow” has become so inseparably affixed to the laws\r\nseparating the races in public conveyances that two States, North\r\nCarolina and Maryland, have indexed the laws on that subject under “J”\r\nin some of their annual statutes. The earliest public use of the phrase\r\nappears to have been in 1835, when Thomas D. Rice, the first Negro\r\nminstrel, brought out in Washington a dramatic song and Negro dance\r\ncalled “Jim Crow.” The late actor, Joseph Jefferson, when only four\r\nyears old, appeared in this dance.[517] In 1841 “Jim Crow” was first\r\nused in Massachusetts to apply to a railroad car set apart for the use\r\nof Negroes.[518] The phrase, then, has a somewhat more dignified origin\r\nthan is ordinarily attributed to it by those who have considered it as\r\nonly an opprobrious comparison of the color of the Negro with that of\r\nthe crow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION PRIOR TO 1875\r\n\r\nThe first “Jim Crow” laws are those of Florida and Mississippi in 1865,\r\nand Texas in 1866. The laws[519] of Florida provided: “That if any\r\nNegro, mulatto, or other person of color shall intrude himself into ...\r\nany railroad car or other public vehicle set apart for the exclusive\r\naccommodation of white people, he shall be deemed guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to stand in pillory\r\nfor one hour, or be whipped, not exceeding thirty-nine stripes, or both,\r\nat the discretion of the jury, nor shall it be lawful for any white\r\nperson to intrude himself into any railroad car or other public vehicle\r\nset apart for the exclusive accommodation of persons of color, under the\r\nsame penalties.” The law[520] of Mississippi was as follows: “That it\r\nshall be unlawful for any officer, station agent, conductor, or employee\r\non any railroad in this State, to allow any freedman, Negro, or mulatto,\r\nto ride in any first-class passenger cars, set apart, or used by, and\r\nfor white persons; and any person offending against the provisions of\r\nthis section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction\r\nthereof, before the circuit court of the county in which said offence\r\nwas committed, shall be fined not less than fifty dollars, nor more than\r\nfive hundred dollars; and shall be imprisoned in the county jail until\r\nsuch fine and costs of prosecution are paid: Provided, that this section\r\nof this act shall not apply in the case of Negroes or mulattoes,\r\ntraveling with their mistresses, in the capacity of nurses.” Texas[521]\r\nsimply provided that every railroad company should be required to attach\r\nto each passenger train run by it one car for the special accommodation\r\nof freedmen.\r\n\r\nOther Southern States, perhaps, would have undertaken similar\r\nlegislation, had the legislatures been left unfettered; but under the\r\nReconstruction régime, a number of the States even passed laws\r\nprohibiting discrimination against Negroes in public conveyances. In\r\n1870, the Georgia legislature[522] enacted a statute requiring the\r\nrailroads in the State to furnish equal accommodations to all, without\r\nregard to race, color, or previous condition, when a greater amount of\r\nfare was exacted than had been exacted before January 1, 1861, which had\r\nbeen at that time half-fare for persons of color. Texas,[523] in 1871,\r\nrepealed the law of 1866 and prohibited public carriers “from making any\r\ndistinctions in the carrying of passengers” on account of race, color,\r\nor previous condition, making the violation of the law a misdemeanor\r\npunishable by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than five\r\nhundred dollars, or imprisonment for not less than thirty or more than\r\nninety days, or both. In 1873, Louisiana[524] prohibited common carriers\r\nfrom making any discrimination against any citizen of the State or of\r\nthe United States on account of race or color, and went further still by\r\nprohibiting common carriers from other States from making such\r\ndiscriminations while in the State. Out of this latter provision arose\r\nthe great case of Hall v. DeCuir, which will be discussed later. In\r\n1874, Arkansas[525] prohibited any public carrier from making any rules\r\nfor the government or control of his business which should not affect\r\nall persons alike, without regard to race or color.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, some of the States outside the South were taking\r\nsteps to adjust the privileges of persons of color. In 1866,\r\nMassachusetts[526] made it unlawful’“to exclude persons from or\r\nrestrict them in ... any public conveyance ... except for good cause.”\r\nThe following year, Pennsylvania[527] enacted a statute prohibiting\r\nrailroads from excluding persons from their cars or requiring them to\r\nride in different parts of the cars on account of color or race, also\r\nprohibiting the conductor or other agent of the railroad from throwing\r\nthe car off the track to prevent such persons from riding. This law\r\nwas passed just a few days before the famous case of West Chester and\r\nPhiladelphia Railway Company v. Mills was decided, which case will\r\nalso be discussed later.\r\n\r\nA statute of Delaware[528] of 1875, as has been seen, declared that the\r\ncarriers of passengers might make such arrangements in their business as\r\nwould, if necessary, assign a particular place in their cars, carriages,\r\nor boats to such of their customers as they might choose to place there,\r\nand whose presence elsewhere would be offensive to the major part of the\r\ntraveling public, where their business was conducted; but the\r\naccommodations must be equal for all if the same price for carriage was\r\nrequired from all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LEGISLATION BETWEEN 1865 AND 1881\r\n\r\nBefore considering the “Jim Crow” laws of the Southern States, it will\r\nbe instructive to look into some of the court decisions between 1865 and\r\n1881, the latter being the date of adoption of the first “Jim Crow” law\r\nof the second period, to see what steps the railroad, street car, and\r\nsteamboat companies had taken to separate the races, in the absence of\r\nState legislation upon the subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, a colored woman ejected from a street car in Philadelphia[529]\r\nbrought action against the conductor, who pleaded that there was a rule\r\nestablished by the road superintendent that Negroes should be excluded\r\nfrom the cars. The court held that the conductor had no right to eject a\r\npassenger on account of race or color, and that a regulation of the\r\ncompany would not be a defence to the action.\r\n\r\nJust a few days after the Pennsylvania legislature passed the act\r\nprohibiting discriminations against persons of color in public\r\nconveyances, to which reference has been made, the Supreme Court of the\r\nState ruled[530] that it was not an unreasonable regulation of the\r\nrailroad company to separate the passengers so as to promote personal\r\ncomfort and convenience. This is interesting because it is the earliest\r\ncase found supporting the legality of the separation of races in public\r\nconveyances. Since the case arose before the Civil Rights Bill of the\r\nCommonwealth was adopted, it does not purport to rule upon the\r\nconstitutionality of that act.\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco,[531] in 1868, a street car conductor refused to stop\r\nfor a colored woman, saying, “We don’t take colored people in the cars,”\r\nwhereupon she brought an action against the company and was awarded\r\ndamages by the lower court. Here there is an implication that the\r\nrailroad company had a regulation excluding persons of color from street\r\ncars.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company[532] refused to\r\nadmit a colored woman to the car set apart for ladies and gentlemen\r\naccompanying them. Whereupon she brought an action and recovered two\r\nhundred dollars damages. It does not appear from the case that the\r\nrailroad had set apart any car or part of a car for the exclusive\r\naccommodation of colored persons.\r\n\r\nA steamboat company in Iowa, in 1873, had a regulation that colored\r\npassengers should not eat at the regular tables, but at a table on the\r\n“guards” of the boat. The Supreme Court of that State held[533] that\r\nthis rule was unreasonable and, therefore, illegal.\r\n\r\nThe first case to reach the Supreme Court of the United States involving\r\nthe separation of white and colored passengers on cars was one brought\r\nagainst the Washington, Alexandria, and Georgetown Railroad Company, in\r\n1873. This road was chartered by Congress in 1863 with the provision\r\nthat no person should be excluded from the cars on account of color. A\r\nNegro woman, with an ordinary first-class ticket, was made to ride in a\r\nseparate coach precisely like that used by the white passengers. The\r\ncourt ruled[534] that the Act of 1863 meant that persons of color should\r\ntravel in the same cars as white persons without any distinction being\r\nmade; that, therefore, the law was not satisfied by the company’s\r\nproviding cars assigned exclusively to persons of color, though they\r\nwere as good as those assigned to white passengers.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the Louisiana[535] legislature passed a law prohibiting\r\nrailroad, street car, and steamboat companies from making any\r\ndiscrimination on account of race or color. In the often-cited case of\r\nHall v. DeCuir,[536] a test case arising under this act in 1875, the\r\nSupreme Court ruled that the Louisiana act was unconstitutional because\r\nit was an interference with interstate commerce. Chief Justice Waite, in\r\ndelivering the opinion of the court, said: “If each State was at liberty\r\nto regulate the conduct of carriers while within its jurisdiction, the\r\nconfusion likely to follow could not but be productive of great\r\ninconvenience and unnecessary hardship.” This case has stood as a\r\nwarning to the Southern States that they must be careful to mention in\r\ntheir “Jim Crow” laws that they apply only to intrastate passengers.\r\nBut, as will be seen later, though this case has not been overruled, it\r\nhas been refined upon.\r\n\r\nIn a case[537] arising in the Federal District Court of Texas in 1877,\r\nit was held that for a railroad employee to deny to a passenger the\r\nright to ride in the only car appropriated for the use of ladies,\r\nbecause she was a colored woman, was a violation of the Civil Rights\r\nBill. But the judge, in charging the jury at the trial, said that, if\r\nthere were two cars equally fit and appropriate, then the white and\r\ncolored passengers might be separated.\r\n\r\nThe above are only a few of the many cases which arose between 1865 and\r\n1881, involving the separation of white and colored passengers; they are\r\ncited to show that, in the absence of legislative authority, many of the\r\npublic conveyance companies had regulations of their own separating the\r\nraces. The “Jim Crow” laws, in other words, coming later, did scarcely\r\nmore than to legalize an existing and widespread custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SEPARATION OF PASSENGERS ON STEAMBOATS\r\n\r\nAs already suggested, the “Jim Crow” laws apply to three classes of\r\nvehicles, namely: steamboats, railroad cars, and street cars. There is\r\ncomparatively little legislation about white and colored passengers on\r\nsteamboats. North Carolina[538] is the only State to include steamboats\r\nin the regular “Jim Crow” law. It requires all steamboat companies\r\nengaged as common carriers in the transportation of passengers for hire\r\nto provide separate but equal accommodations for the white and colored\r\nraces of all steamboats carrying passengers. The violation of this law\r\nis punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars; each day is considered a\r\nseparate offence.\r\n\r\nOn February 9, 1900, the Virginia[539] legislature enacted a statute\r\nrequiring the separation of white and colored passengers on all\r\nsteamboats carrying passengers and plying in the waters within the\r\njurisdiction of the State in the sitting, sleeping, and eating\r\napartments, so far as the “construction of the boat and due\r\nconsideration for comfort of passengers” would permit. There must be no\r\ndifference in the quality of accommodations. The law makes an exception\r\nof nurses and other attendants traveling with their employers, and\r\nofficers in charge of prisoners. For disobeying the law, the boat\r\nofficer is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than\r\ntwenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. Any passenger\r\nwilfully disobeying the law is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a\r\nfine of not less than five dollars nor more than fifty dollars or by\r\nimprisonment for not less than thirty days, or both. The boat officer\r\nmay eject an offending passenger at any landing place, and neither he\r\nnor the steamboat company will be liable. In 1901, the above law[540]\r\nwas made more stringent by omitting the provision about the construction\r\nof the boat and consideration for the comfort of the passengers, quoted\r\nabove. In 1904, South Carolina[541] required all ferries to have\r\nseparate cabins for white and colored passengers.\r\n\r\nThe above legislation seems to be the only legislation as to steamboats\r\nup to the present; but it does not measure the separation of the races\r\non steamboats, inasmuch as the companies in the various States have\r\nadopted regulations requiring separate accommodations for the races.\r\nThis custom applies to interstate as well as to intrastate travel. The\r\nsteamers plying between Boston and the ports of the South, for instance,\r\nprovide separate dining tables, separate toilet rooms, and separate\r\nsmoking rooms for the white and colored passengers. This regulation of\r\ninterstate travel is upheld by two Federal cases, one in Georgia[542] in\r\n1879 and the other in Maryland[543] in 1885, which held in substance,\r\nthat, inasmuch as Congress has enacted no law which forbids interstate\r\ncommon carriers from separating white and colored passengers so long as\r\nthe accommodations are equal, during congressional inaction, the\r\ncompanies may make their own regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SEPARATION OF PASSENGERS IN RAILROAD CARS\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the transient “Jim Crow” laws of Mississippi,\r\nFlorida, and Texas of 1865–67, the first State to adopt a comprehensive\r\nlaw separating the white and colored passengers on railroad cars was\r\nTennessee[544] which did so in 1881. The statute of that State stood\r\nalone until 1887, when a series of “Jim Crow” laws were enacted by the\r\nStates in the following order: Florida,[545] 1887; Mississippi,[546]\r\n1888; Texas,[547] 1889; Louisiana,[548] 1890; Alabama,[549]\r\nKentucky,[550] Arkansas,[551] and Georgia,[552] 1891. For some years\r\nthereafter the subject remained untouched by the legislatures, save an\r\namending statute now and then; but in 1898–99, the other Southern States\r\nbegan to fall into line: South Carolina,[553] 1898; North Carolina,[554]\r\n1899; Virginia,[555] 1900; Maryland,[556] 1904; Oklahoma,[557] 1907. It\r\nappears that Missouri is the only Southern State which has not separated\r\nthe races in railroad cars.\r\n\r\nThe details of the “Jim Crow” laws as to railroads are very nearly the\r\nsame in all the Southern States. They require white persons, on the one\r\nhand, and “Negroes,” “persons of color,” “persons of African descent,”\r\netc., on the other, to occupy separate seats, compartments, or coaches.\r\nThe legal meaning of the above-mentioned phrases has already been\r\nconsidered. It is safe to say, as the Arkansas statute does declare,\r\nthat, if one has a visible and distinct admixture of African blood, he\r\nmust accept the accommodations furnished colored passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Interstate and Intrastate Travel_\r\n\r\nThe first great question that arises is the extent of application of the\r\nlaws. The statutes declare that they apply to all railroads doing\r\nbusiness in the State. But just what does this mean? It has been\r\ngenerally understood and the principle has been confirmed by judicial\r\ndecisions[558] that States may pass laws separating passengers going one\r\nfrom one point to another in the same State. But how about passengers\r\ncoming from or going to points outside the State? Suppose, for instance,\r\na colored passenger were to board a train at Philadelphia for\r\nEvansville, Indiana, and go through Maryland, West Virginia, and\r\nKentucky. Pennsylvania and West Virginia have no “Jim Crow” laws;\r\nMaryland and Kentucky have. When the colored passenger reaches the\r\nMaryland line, must he enter a car set apart for colored people? When he\r\nreaches the West Virginia line, may he go back into the coach with white\r\npassengers? When, again, he reaches the Kentucky line, will he be forced\r\nto return to the car set apart for his race? And, finally, when he comes\r\nto Indiana, may he once more return to the car for white passengers? Or,\r\nsuppose a railroad from Ohio to Indiana has only a few miles of its\r\ntrack in Kentucky and only two depôts in that State. Must the railroad\r\nfurnish separate accommodations for the white and colored passengers\r\ngoing between those two points in Kentucky? If these questions had been\r\nasked thirty years ago or at the time of the Hall v. DeCuir case, there\r\nis no doubt that the Federal courts would have held that it was an\r\nunwarranted interference with interstate commerce or would lead to too\r\nmuch confusion.\r\n\r\nThe law of Alabama of 1891 contained the provision that “this act shall\r\nnot apply to cases where white or colored passengers enter this State\r\nupon such railroads under contract for their transportation made in\r\nother States where like laws to this do not prevail.” Since these laws,\r\nhowever, have become so prevalent throughout the South, the courts seem\r\nto have swung over to the side of public opinion. In 1889, the Supreme\r\nCourt of Mississippi held[559] that though the “Jim Crow” law of that\r\nState applied only to intrastate travel, it was not an unwarranted\r\nburden upon interstate railroads to require them to furnish separate\r\naccommodations for the races as soon as they came across the State line.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, the “Jim Crow” law of Kentucky was declared unconstitutional by\r\nthe Federal Circuit Court[560] because the language of the acts was so\r\ncomprehensive as to embrace all passengers, whether their passage\r\ncommenced or ended within the State or otherwise and thus interfered\r\nwith interstate commerce. Four years later, however, the Court of\r\nAppeals[561] of Kentucky, considering the same statute, ruled that the\r\nlaw of that State was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment or\r\nthe “interstate commerce clause” of the Federal Constitution, arguing\r\nthat, if it did apply to interstate passengers, which was not conceded,\r\nit would be construed to apply only to transportation within the State.\r\nUnder this latter ruling apparently the colored passenger going from\r\nWest Virginia to Indiana through Kentucky would have to ride in the car\r\nprovided for his race in that State.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1898, the Supreme Court[562] of Tennessee held that it\r\nwas a proper exercise of the police power to require even interstate\r\npassengers to occupy separate accommodations while in that State. The\r\nlast case[563] upon this point, decided April 16, 1907, held that a\r\nrailroad company may, independently of statute, adopt and enforce rules\r\nrequiring colored passengers, although they are interstate passengers,\r\nto occupy separate coaches or compartments.\r\n\r\nThus the matter stands. In the absence of a recent United States Supreme\r\nCourt decision upon the point, it would be unsafe to make a\r\ngeneralization. But it is clear that there has been, in the point of\r\nview of the Federal judiciary, a reaction from the extreme doctrine of\r\nHall v. DeCuir. All the lower courts, both State and Federal, are\r\ninclined to make the laws apply to all passengers, both intrastate and\r\ninterstate, so long as they are within the borders of the particular\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Sleeping Cars_\r\n\r\nIn a number of the “Jim Crow” laws there are special provisions about\r\nPullman cars. Oklahoma and Texas provide that carriers may haul sleeping\r\nor chair cars for the exclusive use of either race separately, but not\r\njointly. Georgia goes farthest in legislation on this point. In 1899,\r\nthe legislature provided that, in assigning seats and berths on sleeping\r\ncars, white and colored passengers must be separated; but declared that\r\nnothing in the act should be construed to compel sleeping-car companies\r\nto carry persons of color in sleeping or parlor cars. The act does not\r\napply to nurses and servants with their employers, who may enter and\r\nride in the car with their employers. The conductors are made special\r\npolicemen to enforce the law, and the failure or refusal to do so is\r\npunishable as a misdemeanor. The “Jim Crow” laws in Maryland, North\r\nCarolina, and Virginia do not apply to Pullman cars or to through\r\nexpress trains; nor, in South Carolina, to through vestibule trains.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Texas,[564] in 1897, held that a colored\r\npassenger in a Pullman car, going from a point outside of Texas into\r\nthat State, might be compelled, upon reaching the Texas line, to enter a\r\nPullman car set apart for passengers of his own race, provided the\r\naccommodations were equal. This decision is in harmony with those\r\nalready considered with reference to day coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Waiting-Rooms_\r\n\r\nThree States, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, require separate\r\nwaiting-rooms at railroad depôts. In Mississippi, the railroad\r\ncommission was given power in 1888 to designate separate waiting-rooms,\r\nif it deemed such proper. In most, if not all, of the other Southern\r\nStates, separate waiting-rooms are provided by the railroad companies on\r\ntheir own initiative, and this action on their part was held\r\nconstitutional[565] in South Carolina in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe most recent legislation along this line was an act of South Carolina\r\nof February 23, 1906, requiring a separation of the races in all station\r\nrestaurants and eating-houses, imposing a heavy fine for its violation.\r\nIt is probable that the necessity or propriety of this law was suggested\r\nby the disturbance which arose at Hamlet, North Carolina, near the South\r\nCarolina line, when the proprietor of the Seaboard Air Line Railway\r\neating-house at that place allowed a party of Negroes, one of whom was\r\nDr. Booker T. Washington, to eat in the main dining room, while the\r\nwhite guests were fed in a side room.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Trains to which Laws do not Apply_\r\n\r\nThere are certain classes of trains to which the “Jim Crow” laws do not\r\napply. In Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia, they do not apply to\r\nfreight trains carrying passengers in the caboose cars. South Carolina\r\nexempts narrow-gauged roads from the requirements of the law. North\r\nCarolina gives its railroad commissioners power to exempt branch lines\r\nand narrow-gauged roads if, in their judgment, separation is unnecessary\r\nto secure the comfort of passengers. South Carolina provides that, where\r\na railroad is under forty miles in length and operates both a freight\r\nand a passenger train daily, the law applies only to the passenger\r\ntrain. These two States also except relief trains in case of accident.\r\nWhether there is statutory exemption or not, the railway company cannot\r\nbe held responsible for not separating the passengers in case of an\r\naccident.[566] Oklahoma allows the running of extra or special trains or\r\ncars for the exclusive accommodation of either race, if the regular\r\ntrains or cars are operated upon regular schedule. Texas provides that\r\nthe provisions of its act shall not apply to any excursion train run\r\nstrictly as such for the benefit of either race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Passengers to whom Law does not Apply_\r\n\r\nCertain classes of passengers are exempt from the laws. There is, for\r\ninstance, an exemption in favor of nurses attending the children or sick\r\nof the other race in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The Florida\r\nprovision is that nothing in the act shall be construed to prevent\r\nfemale colored nurses having the care of children or sick persons from\r\nriding in cars for white passengers. North Carolina excepts “Negro\r\nservants in attendance on their employers.” These two qualifications\r\nsound innocent enough, but probably upon a test they would be declared\r\nunconstitutional. It would be considered class legislation in that\r\n_colored_ nurses and _Negro_ servants are specifically mentioned instead\r\nof exempting nurses and servants in general. In fact, the point has been\r\ndecided in the case of street-car provisions with similar wording.\r\n\r\nArkansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia expressly\r\nexempt the employees of a railroad in the discharge of their duty from\r\nthe requirements of the “Jim Crow” laws. Where such exemption is not so\r\nmade in the statute, it must be taken for granted, for it would be\r\nmanifestly unreasonable to prohibit a white conductor from going into\r\nthe colored coach to collect tickets, or a colored porter from going\r\ninto the coach for white passengers to regulate the ventilation or for\r\nany other purpose of his employment. It may be noted, however, that in\r\nStates where these laws apply, the white conductor usually assists the\r\nwhite passengers in entering and leaving the cars, while colored porters\r\nattend to the colored passengers.\r\n\r\nMost of the States provide that the laws do not apply to officers in\r\ncharge of prisoners. Arkansas declares that “officers accompanying\r\nprisoners may be assigned to the coach or room to which said prisoners\r\nbelong by reason of race.” Louisiana, on the contrary, exempts prisoners\r\nin the charge of officers from the “Jim Crow” laws. The South Carolina\r\nlaw exempts lunatics as well. The law of Kentucky exempts “officers in\r\ncharge of prisoners.” When, in a case which arose in Kentucky, a sheriff\r\nwent to take a Negro lunatic over the road, the conductor required the\r\nlunatic to stay in the colored coach, and gave the sheriff the choice of\r\nstaying with the lunatic or leaving him and riding in the car for white\r\npassengers. The court[567] upheld the action of the conductor, ruling\r\nthat the exemption applied only to the officers, not to the prisoners.\r\nThe law has the same effect as if it said that the officer should ride\r\nin the car set apart for the race of the prisoner or lunatic, because it\r\nis his duty to guard his charge, and, if the prisoner or lunatic must\r\nstay in the car for his race, the officer must stay there with him.\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Maryland exempt prisoners from the\r\nrequirements of the “Jim Crow” laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Nature of Accommodations_\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of railroad accommodations, all “Jim Crow” laws\r\nprovide, in substance, that the accommodations for white and colored\r\npassengers must be equal for both races. Florida provides that the\r\ncoaches for colored passengers (with first-class tickets) must be\r\nequally good and provided with the same facilities for comfort as those\r\nfor white passengers with first-class tickets. Kentucky, Maryland, and\r\nVirginia prohibit any difference in quality, convenience, or\r\naccommodation. Tennessee provides that the first-class coaches for\r\ncolored passengers must “be kept in good repair, and with the same\r\nconvenience and subject to the same rules governing other first-class\r\ncars, preventing smoking and obscene language.”\r\n\r\nThere is no one point upon which the courts are more in accord than that\r\nthere is no ground of action so long as the accommodations are\r\nsubstantially equal.[568] The great working principle was enunciated in\r\n1885 in the Circuit Court[569] of Tennessee in the doctrine that\r\nequality of accommodation does not mean identity of accommodation. And,\r\nindeed, the railroad company is not liable for damages even for\r\ninequality of accommodation, unless it is proved that the plaintiff\r\nactually sustained damages by such inequality.[570]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Means of Separation_\r\n\r\nThe actual separation of the races is accomplished by requiring\r\nrailroads to furnish on each passenger train either separate cars or one\r\ncar divided into separate compartments by a partition. Each State gives\r\nthe choice. In case of the division of the car into compartments, the\r\npartition must, in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, be made of wood; in\r\nKentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Texas, it must be “substantial”; and\r\nin Maryland and Texas, it must have a door in it. Arkansas requires only\r\na partitioned car on roads less than thirty miles long, but separate\r\ncars on longer roads, though a train on any road may carry one\r\npartitioned car.\r\n\r\nMaryland and North Carolina provide that, in case the car or compartment\r\nfor either race becomes filled and no extra cars can be obtained and the\r\nincreased number of passengers could not have been foreseen, the\r\nconductor may assign a portion of the car or compartment for one race to\r\nthe passengers of the other race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Designation of Separation_\r\n\r\nSeveral States specify a means by which the public shall be notified of\r\nthe existence of the “Jim Crow” requirements. Arkansas requires the law\r\nto be posted in each coach and waiting-room; Louisiana, in each coach\r\nand ticket-office; Texas, in each coach and depôt. In Kentucky,\r\nMaryland, Oklahoma, and Texas, each coach or compartment must bear in\r\nsome conspicuous place appropriate words, in plain letters, to indicate\r\nthe race for which it was set apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Punishment for Violating Law_\r\n\r\nCertain liabilities are incurred for the violation of the “Jim Crow”\r\nlaws. The three parties concerned are the passenger, the conductor or\r\nmanager of the train, and the railroad company itself. If a passenger\r\nrefuses to occupy the coach or compartment to which he, by his race,\r\nbelongs, the conductor may refuse to carry him and may eject him if he\r\nis already on the train; and for this neither the conductor nor the\r\nrailroad company is liable. In Georgia and Texas, conductors are given\r\nexpress power to enforce the law, and in other States the power is\r\nimplied. Some States punish passengers for wilfully riding in the wrong\r\ncar by a fine ranging from a minimum of five dollars in Maryland and\r\nTexas to a maximum of one thousand dollars in Georgia, or imprisonment\r\nfrom twenty days in Louisiana to six months in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe conductor is liable for two kinds of offences: (1) for assigning a\r\npassenger to a car or compartment to which he does not by race belong,\r\nand (2) for failing to separate passengers. Most of the States consider\r\nthe two violations as one. Only Arkansas and Louisiana prescribe\r\nseparate punishments for assigning the passenger to the wrong car—a fine\r\nof twenty-five dollars in Arkansas and a fine of twenty-five dollars or\r\ntwenty days’ imprisonment in Louisiana. The punishment for refusing to\r\nenforce the law is a fine varying from a minimum of five dollars in\r\nTexas to a maximum of one thousand dollars in Georgia, or, in a few\r\nStates, imprisonment of varying length. In Texas, the fines collected\r\nare applied to the common school fund of the State.\r\n\r\nThe fine imposed upon railroad companies for failing or refusing to\r\nfurnish separate accommodations, varies between twenty-five dollars and\r\none thousand dollars for each offence, and for this purpose each trip\r\nthat the train makes is considered a separate offence. If, however, the\r\nrailroad company provides the required separate cars or compartments and\r\nthe conductor fails to enforce the law or violates its provisions, it is\r\nthe conductor, not the company, who is liable.[571]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Separation of Postal Clerks_\r\n\r\nA special question has arisen out of the Federal postal cars on which\r\nboth white and colored clerks are employed. At present, they are obliged\r\nto sleep in the same cars, and at the terminals of long runs dormitories\r\nare provided for them, but without any race separation. The post-office\r\ndepartment has said that such regulation is beyond its control.[572]\r\nThus the matter stands, with a growing discontent on the part of the\r\nwhite postal clerks to be so intimately associated with the colored\r\nclerks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Jim Crow” laws in the South, so far as the railroads are concerned,\r\nare very nearly complete. Missouri, as has been said, is the only one of\r\nthe Southern States which has not, by express enactment, separated the\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SEPARATION OF PASSENGERS IN STREET CARS\r\n\r\nThe third division of the subject is the separation of races in street\r\ncars. This is a field of much more active legislation than any of the\r\npreceding, in which much has been done recently and in which much more\r\nis likely to be done.\r\n\r\nOf the thirteen separate coach laws just considered, six of them—those\r\nof Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and\r\nTexas—except street railroads from their application. Georgia and\r\nOklahoma alone make their laws all inclusive, embracing electric and\r\nstreet cars as well as railroad coaches. It is safe to assume that the\r\nlaws of the other States refer only to railroad coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Present Extent of Separation_\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the early law of Georgia[573] of 1891, the “Jim\r\nCrow” street car laws came in with the new century. So far, eight of the\r\nSouthern States have passed general statutes to separate the races on\r\nstreet cars, in the following order: Georgia,[573] 1891; Louisiana,[574]\r\n1902; Mississippi,[575] 1904; Tennessee,[576] and Florida,[577] 1905;\r\nVirginia,[578] 1906, and North Carolina,[579] and Oklahoma,[580] 1907.\r\nThe statute of Arkansas,[581] of 1903, might be included in the above\r\nlist, but it applies only to cities of the first class. Some States\r\npassed laws of special application before they made them general. Thus,\r\nin 1902, the legislature of Virginia[582] separated the white and\r\ncolored passengers on street cars going between Alexandria and points in\r\nFairfax and Alexandria Counties; and in 1901, between Richmond and Seven\r\nPines. And so Tennessee,[583] in 1903, made the regular separate coach\r\nlaw apply to street cars in counties having 150,000 inhabitants or over,\r\nas shown by the census of 1900 or any subsequent Federal census. Memphis\r\nonly came within this law. In 1905, South Carolina[584] required the\r\nseparation of the races on “electric railways outside of the corporate\r\nlimits of cities and towns.” This State has not yet made the law\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe extent of legislation at present is as follows: Georgia and\r\nOklahoma, by their regular “Jim Crow” laws, require the white and\r\ncolored passengers on street cars to be separated. Louisiana,\r\nMississippi, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina have\r\nseparated the races by statutes specially applicable to street cars.\r\nArkansas, by statute, requires a separation in cities of the first\r\nclass; and South Carolina, on suburban lines. Maryland, South Carolina,\r\nAlabama, Texas, Kentucky and Missouri do not, by statute, require the\r\nraces to be separated on street cars in cities. But the absence of\r\nlegislative enactments does not mean at all that races are not actually\r\nseparated on street cars. In order to find out the extent of actual\r\nseparation, the author made inquiry of the mayors of every city of\r\n10,000 or more inhabitants in the Southern States and in West Virginia\r\nand Kansas. Some generalizations may be made from the almost complete\r\nnumber of replies received. It may be assumed that the races are\r\nseparated in the above-mentioned States which have statutes on the\r\nsubject. It appears that the white and colored passengers are _not_\r\nseparated on the street cars of any of the cities of Kansas, Kentucky,\r\nMaryland, Missouri, and West Virginia. In the absence of State laws,\r\neither the municipal authorities or the street railway companies\r\nthemselves provide for and require separation in the cities of Alabama\r\nand South Carolina. Thus, though there is no ordinance on the subject in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, separation is required by the company\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Method of Separation_\r\n\r\nThe city ordinances and regulations requiring separation on street cars\r\nare practically the same as the State statutes on the subject. The\r\nordinances, regulations, and statutes all require that the\r\naccommodations for passengers of both races shall be equal. The three\r\nmethods of separation are (1) separate cars, (2) partitioned cars, and\r\n(3) seats assigned to each race. The only city that unqualifiedly\r\nrequires separate cars is Montgomery, Alabama. The ordinance was passed\r\nOctober 15, 1906, over the mayor’s veto, he vetoing it because he\r\nbelieved it would be impracticable. When the law went into effect,\r\nNovember 23, the service was materially reduced because of the scarcity\r\nof cars.[585] The State laws of Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi give\r\nthe choice of using two or more cars or partitioned cars. A number of\r\nthe ordinances require that the cars be divided either by movable\r\nscreens or partitions. They are movable so as to apportion the seating\r\ncapacity to the requirements of each race. But in by far the greatest\r\nnumber of cases, the separation is accomplished by the conductor\r\nassigning white and colored passengers to different seats. Practically\r\nwithout exception, the colored passengers are required to be seated from\r\nthe rear to the front of the car; the white, from the front to the rear.\r\nOn railroad cars, the colored passengers are almost invariably assigned\r\nto the front compartments. The colored passengers on street cars are\r\nseated in the rear in order—to give the reason as stated by the mayor of\r\nBirmingham, Alabama—to do “away with the disagreeable odors that would\r\nnecessarily follow the breezes.” In the closed cars of that city,\r\nhowever, the colored passengers are seated in front so as to give the\r\nwhite passengers the rear for smoking. In other cities, the two rear\r\nseats are reserved for smoking, so the colored passengers begin to sit\r\non the third seat from the rear. As the car fills, the races get nearer\r\nand nearer to one another. North Carolina provides that white and\r\ncolored passengers shall not occupy contiguous seats on the same bench.\r\nVirginia, likewise, prohibits white and colored passengers from sitting\r\nside by side on the same bench unless all the other seats are filled.\r\nThe conductor has the power to require passengers to change their seats\r\nas often as is needful to secure actual separation of the races. The\r\nlaws do not prohibit the running of special cars exclusively for either\r\nrace, provided the regular cars are run.\r\n\r\nThe cars or compartments are to be clearly designated to show to which\r\nrace they belong. Several statutes and ordinances require that the\r\nplacard “WHITE” or “COLORED,” in plain letters, not less than two inches\r\nhigh, shall be upon each end of the car or compartment, or upon the\r\nsides of the open cars. A recent case[586] in Mississippi would seem to\r\nhold that the sign must be large enough to be seen in all parts of the\r\ncar. The laws of Mississippi and Louisiana require that the law be\r\nposted in the car; in Virginia, the substance of the law is posted in\r\nthe car. In Houston, Texas, the race to which the seat belongs is posted\r\non the back of the seat. In several cities, any one tampering with such\r\na sign will be punished by a heavy fine.\r\n\r\nThe law of North Carolina probably contains a fatal defect in that it\r\nrequires separation “as far as practicable.” Of course, this would allow\r\nthe conductors or companies to make numberless exceptions. As a matter\r\nof fact, most of the North Carolina cities had been contemplating such a\r\nseparation, and, when the law went into effect the first of April, 1907,\r\nwere ready to regard and enforce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Enforcement of Laws_\r\n\r\nIn practically all of the cities, the street-car conductors and motormen\r\nare special policemen to enforce the law. For the ejectment of a\r\nwilfully disobedient passenger, they incur no penalty either upon\r\nthemselves or the company. North Carolina provides that the conductor\r\nshall not be liable if he makes the mistake of assigning a passenger to\r\nthe wrong seat. In several of the cities, it is the duty of the regular\r\npolice officers to arrest passengers whom they see riding in the wrong\r\ncars. The penalty upon the conductor for knowingly failing or refusing\r\nto enforce the law varies all the way from a minimum fine of one dollar\r\nin Montgomery, Alabama, to five hundred dollars in Jacksonville,\r\nFlorida, or imprisonment from one to ninety days. The liability of the\r\ncompany is correspondingly heavy in proportion. Each trip made without\r\nproviding for the requirements of the law is expressly declared a\r\nseparate offence. In Pensacola, Florida, the fine upon the company for\r\nnot furnishing separate accommodations is fifty dollars a day.\r\n\r\nWhen a passenger consciously disobeys the law, he may be fined; and if\r\nhe insists upon occupying the wrong seat, the conductor may eject him\r\nfrom the car. According to the Virginia law, “in case such passenger\r\nejected shall have paid his fare upon said car, he shall not be entitled\r\nto any part of said fare.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Exemptions_\r\n\r\nThe only phase of these “Jim Crow” street-car laws which has given rise\r\nto any serious discussion is the question of the exemptions from\r\napplication. Most of the States and cities simply except nurses of one\r\nrace in attendance upon the children or sick of the other race, the\r\nnurse going into the car to which the child or sick person belongs. Of\r\ncourse, the street-car employees are excepted, and Virginia excepts\r\nofficers in charge of prisoners and lunatics. But Florida and North\r\nCarolina declared that the law should not apply to _colored_ nurses in\r\nattendance upon _white_ children or _white_ sick people; and Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, has the same in its ordinance. The constitutionality of the\r\nFlorida law was tested five years ago in the Supreme Court[587] of that\r\nState, and was declared to violate the Fourteenth Amendment, the court,\r\nin its opinion, saying: “It gives to the Caucasian mistress the right to\r\nhave her child attended in the Caucasian department of the car by its\r\nAfrican nurse, and withholds from the African mistress the equal right\r\nto have her child attended in the African department by its Caucasian\r\nnurse.” This is the same discrimination as to the invalid adult\r\nCaucasian attended by a colored nurse. As soon as the Florida State law\r\nwas declared unconstitutional, the cities passed ordinances making the\r\nprovision apply to nurses of either race. The North Carolina law was\r\nnever tested, for it was amended before a test case reached the courts.\r\nThe North Carolina legislature[588] of 1909 obviated all possible\r\ndifficulty by amending its law to the effect that the nurses of the\r\nchildren or sick or infirm of one race might ride in the car set apart\r\nfor the race of the infant or sick or infirm person so attended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 517:\r\n\r\n  _Century Dictionary_, I, p. 546.\r\n\r\nFootnote 518:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, IV, p. 3233.\r\n\r\nFootnote 519:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Fla., 1865, p. 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 520:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Miss., 1865, pp. 231–32.\r\n\r\nFootnote 521:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Texas, 1866, p. 97.\r\n\r\nFootnote 522:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Ga., 1870, pp. 427–28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 523:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Texas, 1871, 2d sess., p. 16.\r\n\r\nFootnote 524:\r\n\r\n  Acts of La., 1873, pp. 156–57.\r\n\r\nFootnote 525:\r\n\r\n  Acts of Ark., 1873, pp. 15–19.\r\n\r\nFootnote 526:\r\n\r\n  Acts and Resolves of Mass., 1866–67, p. 242.\r\n\r\nFootnote 527:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Pa., 1867, pp. 38–39.\r\n\r\nFootnote 528:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Del., 1875–77, p. 322.\r\n\r\nFootnote 529:\r\n\r\n  Derry v.

It is in each of these capacities that the Negro in the court\r\nroom is to be considered, but some of them permit of only brief mention.\r\nHow the Negro actually fares in the court room—whether he gets justice\r\nas often as the white person does, whether his testimony has as much\r\nweight with the jury and court as that of the white witness, whether the\r\nNegro attorney or judge is accorded as much courtesy as the white man in\r\na similar position—would make an interesting and profitable study, but\r\nsuch a study is largely outside the field of this investigation. It\r\nshould be kept in mind now, as in the previous chapters, that only those\r\ndistinctions are considered which have come within the pale of the law\r\nsince 1865, either in the form of statutory enactment or judicial\r\ndecision. Where mention is made of some of the actual extralegal race\r\ndistinctions in the court room, it is only for illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              AS SPECTATOR\r\n\r\nThe court room, while the court is in session, is open to all citizens,\r\nregardless of race or color. No instance has been found either in the\r\nstatutes or judicial reports of one’s admission to or exclusion from the\r\ncourt room being dependent upon his race or color. It is to be noticed,\r\nhowever, in Southern court rooms that the spectators are separated by\r\nrace, Negroes usually occupying seats on one side of the room and white\r\npeople on the other. This must be entirely a matter of custom, as no\r\ncase has been found of such separation being required by law or\r\nordinance. While this point has not been deemed important enough for a\r\nspecial investigation, it is presumed that one will find the races\r\nseparated in the court room in those States or communities where they\r\nare separated in other places—as in public conveyances, schools, and\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nA Negro in the South, as elsewhere, has, legally and actually, as good\r\nan opportunity to observe court proceedings as a white person, though\r\ncustom may require him to sit in a different part of the court room from\r\nthat occupied by the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AS JUDGE\r\n\r\nLittle within the scope of this chapter can be said of the Negro as a\r\njudge. There are cases still in the North of Negroes sitting on the\r\nbench, mostly in lower courts, and there may be instances, here and\r\nthere, in the South, of Negroes holding judicial offices. Certainly, the\r\nNegro elector is eligible, both under Federal and State Constitutions,\r\nto hold a judgeship. Whether or not there are Negroes on the bench in a\r\ngiven State is not determined by the legislatures or the courts, but by\r\nthe appointing power or by the choice of the people at the polls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               AS LAWYER\r\n\r\nA Negro is eligible to practice law in every State; that is, nothing to\r\nthe contrary appears in any of the State or Federal statutes now in\r\nforce. Negroes may be admitted to the bar everywhere upon proving the\r\nsame qualifications and passing the same examinations as required of\r\nother applicants for license. But this has not always been so. The\r\nprivilege of practicing law in Iowa,[589] for instance, was, until 1870,\r\nrestricted to white males. In that year it was extended to women and to\r\nmembers of other races than the white. Only one State appears to have\r\nconsidered it needful to guarantee by statutory enactment the right to\r\npractice law to the Negro. An act of the Colorado[590] legislature in\r\n1897 reads: “No persons shall be denied the right to practice as\r\naforesaid on account of race or sex.”\r\n\r\nIn 1877, a Negro, with a license to practice law in Massachusetts and\r\nthe Circuit and District courts of the United States in the city of\r\nBaltimore, applied for a license to practice in the State courts of\r\nMaryland. The laws of Maryland[591] of 1872 limited the privilege of\r\nadmission to the bar to white male citizens. The Negro brought suit\r\nbecause he was refused admission to the Maryland bar, and the Court of\r\nAppeals of Maryland[592] held that the State had a right to limit the\r\nprivilege of practicing law to white males, holding that such a\r\nlimitation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court said, in\r\npart: “The privilege of admission to the office of an attorney cannot be\r\nsaid to be a right or immunity belonging to the citizen, but is governed\r\nand regulated by the Legislature, which may prescribe the qualifications\r\nrequired and designate the class of persons who may be admitted. The\r\npower of regulating the admission of attorneys in the courts of a State\r\nis one belonging to the State, and not to the Federal Government. As\r\nsaid by Mr. Justice Bradley in Bradwell’s case:[593] ‘In the nature of\r\nthings it is not every citizen of every age, sex and condition that is\r\nqualified for every calling and position. It is the prerogative of the\r\nlegislator to prescribe regulations founded on nature, reason and\r\nexperience, for the due admission of qualified persons to professions\r\nand callings demanding special skill and confidence. This fairly belongs\r\nto the police power of the State.’” According to the opinion in this\r\ncase, which has not been overruled so far as has been found, a State\r\nlegislature may, in the exercise of its police power, limit the\r\nprivilege of practicing law to white males or to white people, and thus\r\ndebar the Negro altogether. In the latest collection of Maryland laws,\r\nhowever, that of 1904, no mention is made of race in the prescribed\r\nqualifications for admission to the bar, but no express repeal has been\r\nfound in the annual statutes of the law of 1872 which limited the\r\nprivilege of practicing law to white males. The presumption is, however,\r\nthat Maryland, in common with the other States, now admits Negro\r\napplicants on the same terms as white.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that Negro lawyers in the Southern States are few,\r\nand it is considered that the field there for the Negro lawyer is not\r\npromising. There were seven hundred and twenty-eight Negro lawyers in\r\nthe United States in 1900. The following notice in _The Emmanuel\r\nMagazine_ of July 3, 1909, a monthly publication by a Negro in\r\nWashington, North Carolina, is interesting in this connection: “Mr. E.\r\nW. Canady, a respectable colored lawyer of Durham, N. C., not long since\r\nreceived three thousand four hundred dollars for his service at the bar\r\nin representing one case. This speaks more for him than anything else\r\npossibly could. It shows the public’s confidence in his ability both as\r\na lawyer and a gentleman of integrity. It also shows that, at least in\r\nsome cases, a Negro can get justice in a Southern court, not only for\r\nhimself, but for others. The profession of law is the most difficult one\r\na colored man can follow in the South, because he must deal with white\r\njudges, white jurors, white lawyers, and, sometimes, white witnesses,\r\nand a public sentiment which is created by the whites. If he keep his\r\nsoul well equipoised and act gently and manfully—not bootlicking, but\r\nseeking the peace of the city wherein he dwelleth, as Jeremiah advised\r\nthe Jews of Babylon to do, he can fare equally as well, if not better,\r\nin the South as he can in the North. I was not a little surprised when I\r\nasked Mr. Canady how the judges treated him and he said, ‘Oh, they’ll\r\ntreat you all right, if you act rightly; they are bound to follow the\r\nlaw, you know.’ This should encourage more young men to take up this\r\nprofession.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               AS WITNESS\r\n\r\nWhen one comes to the Negro as a witness, he finds much legislation and\r\nmany judicial decisions, but they are confined largely to the first\r\nyears after Emancipation; that is, to the years during which the rights\r\nand privileges of the Negro as a freeman were being defined and fixed.\r\nThe Negro slave had been either deemed incompetent as a witness, or, if\r\ndeemed competent, his testimony was admitted only in certain actions.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, a white man in Kentucky was indicted for entering the house of\r\na Negro and committing larceny. At the time a Negro in that State could\r\nnot testify against a white man. A Circuit Court[594] of the United\r\nStates decided that it could take jurisdiction of this case under the\r\nCivil Rights Bill of 1866, holding that the Negro, as a citizen, had the\r\nright to be a witness in court. This appears to be the only case in\r\nwhich the Federal court has adjudicated upon the right of a Negro to\r\ntestify.\r\n\r\nA law of Alabama[595] of 1865 made Negroes competent to testify only in\r\nopen court and only in cases, civil or criminal, to which a freedman,\r\nfree Negro, or mulatto, was a party. This was reënacted in 1867.[596] In\r\n1886, a white man in Mobile was tried for the murder of a Negro. All the\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution were Negroes, and all for the defendant,\r\nwhite people. The question of the color of witnesses was raised, and the\r\ncity court of Mobile charged: “... it is immaterial whether the\r\nwitnesses were white or black, if you believe beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat black witnesses are telling the truth, it is as much your duty to\r\nconvict on their evidence as though they were white.” There was an\r\nexception to this charge, but the Supreme Court of Alabama[597]\r\noverruled the exception. The present law of Alabama seems to be that the\r\ncolor of the witness is immaterial in determining his competency.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Arkansas,[598] in 1869, held that by the Civil\r\nRights Bill of 1866 the laws prohibiting Negroes from testifying became\r\ninoperative. No other case on the point seems to have arisen in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution[599] of Florida of 1865 permitted Negroes to testify\r\nonly in proceedings founded upon injury to a Negro or in cases affecting\r\nthe rights and remedies of Negroes. A statute[600] of the same year,\r\nrelative to testimony in general, provided that the testimony of Negroes\r\nshould not be taken by deposition in writing or upon written\r\ninterrogation, or “otherwise than in such manner as will enable the\r\ncourt or jury to judge the credibility of the witness.”\r\n\r\nThe Constitution[601] of Georgia of 1865 made it the duty of the general\r\nassembly to provide laws prescribing in what cases the testimony of\r\nNegroes should be admitted in the courts. This is the only reference to\r\nthe Negro as a witness found in the Georgia statutes or court reports.\r\n\r\nKentucky,[602] in 1865, provided that Negroes and mulattoes should be\r\ncompetent witnesses in all civil proceedings in which Negroes or\r\nmulattoes were the only parties interested in the issue, and in all\r\ncriminal proceedings in which Negroes or mulattoes were the defendants.\r\nIn 1867, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky[603] held that the law of\r\nKentucky prohibiting a Negro from testifying against a white person was\r\nstill in force and was not rendered inoperative by the Civil Rights Bill\r\nof 1866.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution[604] of Maryland of 1867 provided that no person should\r\nbe incompetent as a witness on account of race or color unless\r\nthereafter so declared by an act of the general assembly. The general\r\nassembly appears not to have acted.\r\n\r\nMississippi,[605] in 1865, provided that freedmen, free Negroes, and\r\nmulattoes, should be competent in all civil cases to which a freedman,\r\nfree Negro, or mulatto was a party, and in criminal cases in which the\r\ncrime charged was alleged to have been committed by a white person upon\r\na freedman, free Negro, or mulatto. But in 1867, Negroes were given the\r\nright to testify on the same terms as white people.[606] In 1865, South\r\nCarolina[607] declared that Negroes might testify in cases to which a\r\nperson of color was a party. Tennessee,[608] the same year, provided\r\nthat Negroes and Indians should be competent as witnesses “in as full\r\nmeasure as such persons are by an act of Congress competent witnesses in\r\nall the courts of the United States.”\r\n\r\nThe Constitution[609] of Texas of 1866 contains the following section:\r\n“Africans and their descendants shall not be prohibited, on account of\r\ntheir color or race, from testifying orally, as witnesses, in any case,\r\ncivil or criminal, involving the right of injury to, or crime against,\r\nany of them in person or property, under the same rules of evidence that\r\nmay be applicable to the white race; the credibility of their testimony\r\nto be determined by the court or jury hearing the same; and the\r\nlegislature shall have power to authorize them to testify as witnesses\r\nin all other cases, under such regulations that may be prescribed, as to\r\nfacts hereafter occurring.” In pursuance of this authority, the\r\nlegislature[610] enacted that persons of color should not testify except\r\nwhere a prosecution was against a person of color or where the alleged\r\noffence was against the person or property of a person of color. But in\r\n1868, the Supreme Court[611] of Texas held that the first section of the\r\nCivil Rights Bill gave Negroes the right to testify, and in 1871 the\r\nlegislature[612] said that in the courts of that State there shall be no\r\nexclusion of any witness on account of color.\r\n\r\nVirginia,[613] in 1866, provided that Negroes and Indians should be\r\ncompetent to testify in cases in which a Negro or Indian was a party.\r\nThe testimony of Negroes had to be “_ore tenus_, and not by deposition.”\r\nThe next year, this law was repealed and a statute[614] enacted that\r\ncolored persons should be competent to testify “as if they were white.”\r\n\r\nThus far the legislation on Negro testimony in the Southern States only\r\nhas been given. Similar questions have arisen in some of the other\r\nStates. Thus, by an early statute of California[615] “no Indian, or\r\nperson having one-half or more Indian blood, or Mongolian, or Chinese,”\r\nwas permitted to give evidence in favor of or against a white person.\r\nThe Supreme Court[616] of the State held in 1869 that this statute\r\nviolated the Civil Rights Bill and was therefore null and void. A\r\nminority of the court, however, dissented on the ground that the Civil\r\nRights Bill itself was unconstitutional as interfering with the domestic\r\nrelations of citizens.\r\n\r\nA law of Indiana[617] of 1865 provided that all persons of competent\r\nage, without distinction as to color or blood, should be competent as\r\nwitnesses, but provided that no Negro or mulatto who had come, or who\r\nshould thereafter come into this State in violation of the thirteenth\r\narticle of the Constitution of the State (prohibiting the immigration of\r\nfree Negroes) should, while said article continued in force, be\r\ncompetent as a witness in any case in which a white person was a party\r\nin interest. It also provided[618] that where a Negro, Indian, or person\r\nexcluded on account of mixed blood was a party in the case, his opponent\r\nshould be excluded. Nevada,[619] the same year, gave Negroes the right\r\nto testify, but not in favor of or against a white person, and also\r\nprovided that the credibility of such Negro, black, or mulatto person\r\nshould be left entirely with the jury. Washington,[620] in 1866,\r\nprovided that no one should be incompetent as a witness “by reason of\r\nhaving Negro blood.” But in 1869, the legislature[621] said that Indians\r\nor persons having over one-half Indian blood should not be competent to\r\ntestify in an action or proceeding to which a white person was a party.\r\nWest Virginia[622] passed a law in 1866 that no person should be\r\nincompetent as a witness on account of race or color.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years after Emancipation, the States were very doubtful\r\nof the Negro’s fitness as a witness. In saying, as many of them did,\r\nthat he could be a witness only in cases in which a Negro was a party,\r\nthey were following the “Black Laws” before the War, to which reference\r\nwas made in the chapter on “The Black Laws of 1865–68.” That they were\r\ndoubtful of the testimony of the Negro is shown by the provision of the\r\nact that the Negro’s credibility should be the subject of a special\r\ncharge by the court and that his testimony should be given orally. It\r\nhas been seen that some of the States soon repealed their laws\r\ndiscriminating against the Negro as a witness, and that others enacted\r\nstatutes allowing him to testify upon the same terms and conditions as a\r\nwhite person. In some of the States, the records do not show that the\r\nright to testify in court has yet been given to the Negro. But it must\r\nbe taken as settled that, even in those States which are silent on the\r\nsubject, the Negro does have the same right to testify as the white\r\nperson. How much weight is actually given to his testimony is a matter\r\nnot of law, but of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact, or jury,\r\nas the case may be. It may be said, in short, that, at present, the\r\nright of the Negro to testify in court is precisely co-extensive with\r\nthe right of the white person.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AS JUROR\r\n\r\nMost of the legislation and suits concerning the Negro as a witness came\r\nduring the years between 1865 and 1870. Since then, the right of the\r\nNegro to testify in court has been generally undisputed. With the Negro\r\nas a juror, it has been different. There has not been a great deal of\r\nlegislation about the Negro as a juror, not even during the years\r\n1865–70 which were so prolific of race legislation. But the court\r\nreports from 1865 have been abundantly supplied with cases that have to\r\ndo with the Negro as a juror, not referring so much to his right to\r\nserve as to his actual service on the jury. First, reference will be\r\nmade to the legislation on the topic, then a number of cases will be\r\ndiscussed, most of which have turned upon a few fundamental principles\r\nof constitutional law, and, finally, a word will be said of Negro jury\r\nservice as it actually exists.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the Civil Rights Bill[623] of 1875 reads: “That no\r\ncitizen possessing all other qualifications which are or may be\r\nprescribed by law shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit\r\njuror in any court of the United States, or of any State, on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude, and any officer or\r\nother person charged with any duty in the selection or summoning of\r\njurors who shall exclude or fail to summon any citizen for the cause\r\naforesaid shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor, and be fined not more than five thousand dollars.” As was\r\nseen in the previous chapter on the civil rights of Negroes, the first\r\nsections of the Civil Rights Bill were declared unconstitutional in\r\n1883. But, as will be seen in the discussion of the cases that have\r\narisen about the Negro as a juror, the section quoted above has stood\r\nthe test of constitutionality and is still a part of our Federal statute\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nWhen the States outside the South saw, in 1883, that the Federal\r\nGovernment was impotent to secure civil rights to Negroes, they began to\r\nenact Civil Rights Bills of their own, which virtually copied the\r\nFederal statutes of 1875. The following States enacted statutes\r\npractically the same as the Federal law referring to jury service:\r\nIndiana,[624] in 1885; Michigan,[625] in 1885; New York,[626] in 1895;\r\nOhio,[627] in 1884, and Rhode Island,[628] in 1885. The only difference\r\nbetween these State statutes and the Federal statute is in the\r\npunishment for keeping a person off the jury because of his race or\r\ncolor. Indiana and Michigan impose a fine of not less than one hundred\r\ndollars or imprisonment of not more than thirty days, or both; New York\r\nimposes a fine of from one hundred dollars to five hundred dollars or\r\nimprisonment from thirty to ninety days, or both; Ohio imposes a fine\r\nfrom fifty dollars to five hundred dollars or imprisonment between\r\nthirty and ninety days, or both; Rhode Island imposes a fine not to\r\nexceed one hundred dollars. This is practically all of the jury\r\nlegislation outside the South, which has been found.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas,[629] in 1867, a law granting certain rights to Negroes had\r\nthe following provision: “That nothing herein contained shall be\r\nconstrued to repeal or modify any statute or common law usage of this\r\nState respecting ... service on juries.” Though nothing is said of it,\r\none may infer that this meant that Negroes were not to sit on juries. A\r\nLouisiana[630] law of 1880 states that, in the selection of jurors,\r\n“there shall be no distinction made on account of race, color, or\r\nprevious condition.” This State at the time was in the hands of the\r\nReconstructionists. Mississippi,[631] in 1867, provided that freedmen\r\nshould not be competent to serve as petit or grand jurors. A law of\r\nTennessee[632] of 1866, giving Negroes the right to testify, had the\r\nprovision that it should not be construed to give colored persons the\r\nright to sit on juries in that State. The same year, a law[633]\r\nrepealing certain other acts had the provision that nothing in the act\r\nshould be construed to admit persons of color to serve on the jury. But\r\nin 1868, the Negroes of Tennessee[634] were given full rights in this\r\nrespect. This appears to be all of the legislation as to Negro jurors in\r\nthe South between 1865 and the present.\r\n\r\nThat the statute of 1875 prohibiting the exclusion of persons from jury\r\nservice on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude is\r\nconstitutional, has been decided in a series of cases before the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States.[635] The mere fact that no Negroes are on a\r\ncertain jury does not indicate that the Fourteenth Amendment, under\r\nwhich all these jury cases arise, has been violated; it must be shown\r\nthat the Negroes were kept off the jury consciously by State officials\r\nbecause of their race, color, or previous condition.[636] The Fourteenth\r\nAmendment is violated, however, when the officers of the State keep\r\nNegroes off the juries for these causes. The Supreme Court[637] of the\r\nUnited States said in 1899: “Whenever by an action of a State, whether\r\nthrough its legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or\r\nadministrative officers, all persons of the African race are excluded,\r\nsolely because of their race or color, from serving as grand jurors in\r\nthe criminal prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal\r\nprotection of the laws is denied to him contrary to the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States.”\r\n\r\nA custom seems to have grown up among some lawyers, particularly in the\r\nSouth, to move to quash the indictment whenever a Negro is on trial for\r\na crime and there are no Negroes on the grand jury. With almost absolute\r\nuniformity, the State courts have held that there is no ground for\r\nquashing the indictment unless it is shown that Negroes were kept off\r\nthe juries purposely and because of their race or color.[638] The cases\r\nshow also that, if a Negro is kept off the grand jury because of his\r\nrace, there is ground for quashing the indictment. Texas has furnished\r\nfar more of these jury cases than any other Southern State. Wherever the\r\njury commissioners have betrayed in any way the fact that they kept\r\nNegroes off the juries because of their race, the indictment has been\r\nquashed. A few instances will suffice. In one case the commissioners\r\nsaid that they did not put Negroes on the jury because they considered\r\nthem unfit; this was held[639] to be in violation of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment. When, again, they said that they kept Negroes off the juries\r\nbecause their presence “would be offensive to the white jurors,” the\r\nindictment was quashed.[640] In a county of 11,000 voters in Texas,\r\nabout 1,000 of them were Negroes, of whom 600 or 700 were competent to\r\nbe jurors. No Negro had ever been on a jury there. The commissioners\r\nadmitted that they would not put a Negro on if they knew it. The\r\nindictment was quashed.[641] In another case,[642] they said they would\r\nnot put Negroes on juries because it would create a conflict between the\r\nraces which would injure the Negroes. This was held a sufficient\r\nadmission to quash the indictment. In a case arising as late as 1903,\r\nthe commissioners undertook to satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment by\r\nputting on a Negro. They put on a Negro who had either moved out of the\r\ncounty or was dead. This was held to be enough of a race discrimination\r\nto quash the indictment.[643]\r\n\r\nNo matter how large a percentage of the population is colored, if it is\r\nnot proved that Negroes were kept off the jury because of race or color,\r\nthere is no ground for objection. Thus, it was found that a Negro had\r\nnever been known to sit on a grand jury in Bexar County, Texas, where\r\nthere were 7,000 or 8,000 possible jurors, of whom 600 or 700 were\r\ncolored. It was not proved, however, that they were kept off on account\r\nof race or color, and it was held that there was no ground for quashing\r\nan indictment.[644]\r\n\r\nThe following interesting case arose in Utah in 1900: A white person\r\nrefused to serve on a jury with a Negro, and wrote a note making a\r\ncomplaint. The Negro was thereupon excluded from the jury. Later, the\r\nNegro brought an action against the white man to recover damages to the\r\nextent of the jury fees. The court held[645] that, while color was not a\r\ntest of one’s fitness to be a juror, a written objection to serve on a\r\njury with a Negro is no ground for an action for damages by a colored\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe latest case of race distinction in juries comes from Oklahoma. There\r\nwere four Negroes on a jury, and for that reason the judge discharged\r\nthe jury. He said that the State had separate cars, separate schools,\r\nand separate tables for Negroes and whites, and “he would not insult\r\nwhite men by making them serve on a jury with Negroes.” The case is so\r\nrecent as to be reported, as yet, only in the newspapers.[646]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional right of the Negro to serve on a jury or to be tried\r\nbefore a jury composed, in whole or in part, of Negroes, is well\r\nexpressed in a recent Texas case[647] as follows: “It is not a question\r\nas to the right of a Negro, or any number of Negroes, to sit on a grand\r\njury, that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nState was intended to provide for; but it was intended, where a Negro\r\nwas on trial, to prevent discrimination against the Negro race in the\r\nformation of the grand jury, which presented the indictment, and only in\r\ncase Negroes are intentionally excluded from the grand jury is he denied\r\nthe equal protection of the laws. It was never intended by the\r\nFourteenth Amendment to guaranty a Negro defendant a full Negro grand\r\njury, or to guaranty to him any particular number of grand jurors, but\r\nit was intended to prevent intentional exclusion from the grand jury.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Actual Jury Service by Negroes in South_\r\n\r\nIn treating the Negro as a juror, the writer departed from the habit of\r\nconfining his discussion to the race distinctions manifested in statutes\r\nand judicial reports. As he went through the statutes and reports, these\r\nquestions arose in his mind: Do Negroes actually serve on the juries in\r\nthose communities where they are numerous? If so, what satisfaction have\r\nthey given? In order to obtain answers to these questions, he sent out\r\nletters to the clerks of court in every county in the Southern States in\r\nwhich Negroes constituted one-half or more of the population in 1900.\r\nOver three hundred letters were sent out containing the following\r\ninquiry: “I wish to know to what extent Negroes actually serve on\r\njuries, how Negro jurors are regarded by the court and the people at\r\nlarge, whether the number of colored jurors has increased or decreased\r\nin late years, what has been the experience of your county as to the\r\nsatisfaction of colored jurors?” Of course, as many replies were not\r\nreceived; but the replies that were received indicate the extent of\r\nNegro jury service in the Southern States. These replies will be quoted\r\nfrom freely in each case, the State and the number of Negroes and white\r\npeople in the particular county will be given, but not the name of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n_Alabama._—County No. 1, 10,000 white people, 13,000 Negroes: “Negroes\r\nare not allowed to sit upon juries in this county. It sometimes happens\r\nthat names of Negroes are placed in our jury-box by mistake on the part\r\nof the jury commissioners, and are regularly drawn to serve as jurors;\r\nthis, however, is a very rare occurrence. Once in the past four years, a\r\nNegro was drawn as a grand juror (by mistake) who appeared and insisted\r\nupon the court’s impaneling him with other jurors, which was done in\r\naccordance with law, the court having no legal right to discharge or\r\nexcuse him. My recollection is he served two days, when he was taken out\r\nat night and severely beaten, and was then discharged on his own\r\npetition by the court. This will convey to your mind that Negro jurors\r\nare not very wholesomely regarded and tolerated in this county. The fact\r\nis, Negroes have never been or never will be allowed to sit on juries in\r\nthis county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 5,000 white people, 21,000 Negroes: “I have lived in this\r\ncounty for more than sixty-six years, and we have never had a Negro\r\njuror in that time, nor do I ever expect to see one in the jury-box in\r\nthis county. Our adjoining counties have all had them, a number of years\r\nago.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 5,000 white people, 27,000 Negroes: “Negroes do not serve\r\non juries in our courts. Such a state of affairs would be considered by\r\nthe people of this county as farcical. The Lord defend us from having\r\njurors of a race of people who are absolutely without regard for an\r\noath.”\r\n\r\n_Arkansas._—County No. 1, 1,800 white people, 12,600 Negroes: “No\r\nNegroes serve in this county on regular juries. Sometimes when hard to\r\nobtain white jurors, a few Negroes may be taken in cases in J. P.\r\nCourts, but not often. Even this habit is smaller than formerly, falling\r\noff every year. Colored jurors [are] not looked upon as intelligent, and\r\nvery few as honest and possessing integrity, and they, as a rule, are\r\nalso uneducated.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 14,000 white people, 29,800 Negroes: “No Negroes have\r\nserved on juries in the court of this county since 1894. Prior to that\r\ntime it was a common thing for them to be in the majority. I believe the\r\nNegroes are fairly well pleased with the verdicts of all white jurors,\r\nas the question is nearly always propounded to the juror, when it is a\r\nNegro defendant: ‘Would you give the defendant the same consideration as\r\nif he was a white man?’”\r\n\r\n_Florida._—County No. 1, 17,000 white people, 22,000 Negroes: “It has\r\nbeen many years since a Negro sat upon a jury in this court, and the\r\nprobability is, it will be many more. Negroes are not regarded as good\r\njurors, and I believe it to be a fact that a Negro would prefer being\r\ntried by a white jury than a mixed jury, or a jury composed wholly of\r\nNegroes; this applies to both civil and criminal matters.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 11,000 white people, 12,000 Negroes: “Negroes do not sit\r\non the jury in this county, and have not since the days of ‘Carpet-Bag\r\nRule.’ I do not think a county in this State permits a Negro juryman.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 6,000 white people, 8,000 Negroes: “Negro jurymen or other\r\nofficers are a thing of the past in our county and State. The oldest\r\nperson can hardly recall the time when we had such in our county, with\r\nthe exception of a very few years just after the war.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 9,000 white people, 15,000 Negroes: “... in the circuit\r\ncourt of the State it is very seldom that a Negro serves on the jury.\r\nNegroes, as a rule, are not good jurors, for the reason that they are\r\nusually very ignorant and can be easily influenced by others in the\r\nrendering of their verdict. The Negro jurors, so far as the State courts\r\nare concerned, are almost eliminated. In the Federal courts of the\r\nState, a large number of Negroes serve on the juries....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 5, 2,300 white people, 2,700 Negroes: “The laws of this State\r\nrequire that the county commissioners select not less than 290 nor more\r\nthan 310 ‘persons of approved integrity, fair character, sound judgment\r\nand intelligence’ to serve as jurors. Therefore, because most of the\r\nelder Negroes are illiterate and because most of the younger ones that\r\nremain here are of other than fair character, there are but few Negroes,\r\nabout one per cent., whose names are drawn or selected to go into the\r\njury-box. If one is drawn as juror ... he serves as such juror, and no\r\none has ever objected to one so far as I know of. My experience covers a\r\nperiod of ten years, during which time ... we have had only two Negroes\r\ndrawn as jurors. No person has ever appealed a case on account of not\r\nhaving a Negro on the jury, nor has there been anything said outside on\r\naccount of the practical elimination of the Negro from jury duty.”\r\n\r\n_Georgia._—County No. 1, 5,000 white people, 24,000 Negroes: “No Negroes\r\nserve on our jury. There are no Negro names in the jury-box.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 5,900 white people, 6,800 Negroes: “No Negroes have ever\r\nbeen placed in the jury-box in this county. They are not regarded as\r\ncompetent or reliable as jurors, hence they have not [been] tried as\r\nsuch in this county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 5,000 white people, 12,000 Negroes: “Negroes do not serve\r\nas jurors in this county, for several reasons to wit: Incompetency,\r\nstrong prejudices, superstitiousness, and general unfitness in regard to\r\nequity.... It happens frequently they are drawn and serve on juries in\r\nwhat we term here United States courts....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 1,500 white people, 8,800 Negroes: “Negroes do not serve\r\non the juries in this county.... None of the Negroes in this county have\r\never been placed in such [jury] boxes.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 5, 4,000 white people, 9,000 Negroes: “We do not have Negroes\r\nas jurors; we tried them and found them incompetent and otherwise\r\ndisqualified.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 6, 7,000 white people, 11,000 Negroes: “No Negroes serve on\r\nthe jury in this county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 7, 4,800 white people, 5,000 Negroes: “Not a blooming one\r\n[Negro juror], and not likely to be.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 8, 2,000 white people, 5,800 Negroes: “There are no Negro\r\njurors in this county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 9, 6,000 white people, 7,000 Negroes: “I have lived here all\r\nmy life and do not know that there has been any Negro who has served on\r\nthe jury in this county. I am quite sure there has been none for the\r\npast 20 or 30 years.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 10, 2,500 white people, 4,000 Negroes: “... There has never\r\nbeen a Negro juror to serve in this county nor any other county\r\nsurrounding this to my knowledge. We revise our jury-boxes biennially,\r\nand never have yet put a Negro’s name on the list of jurors. And I think\r\nthis is the practice all over the State. I am satisfied if one should be\r\nput on any jury that the white men on would flatly refuse to serve at\r\nall....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 11, 5,000 white people, 6,000 Negroes: “... There is no\r\nrecord of Negroes ever serving as jurors in this county.”\r\n\r\n_Kentucky._—No replies have come from the seven counties of Kentucky in\r\nwhich Negroes constitute a large percentage of the population. But the\r\nfollowing is quoted from a letter from the Assistant Attorney General of\r\nthe State: “Negro jurors are sometimes selected in various parts of the\r\nState, and I presume all over the State. Twenty years ago the custom was\r\nmore prevalent than at present of putting Negroes on the juries. They\r\nwere the best class of Negroes, and I am reliably informed that in\r\nvarious parts of the State the Negroes themselves requested to be left\r\noff the juries, which may account for the fact that the practice seems\r\nto have fallen into disuse.”\r\n\r\n_Louisiana._—Parish No. 1, 3,900 white people, 12,700 Negroes: “... we\r\nnow have no Negroes to serve on the jury here at all. Some years ago we\r\nhad Negro jurors, but they proved so unsatisfactory that they were\r\ngradually dropped out and for several years [we] have had no Negroes at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nParish No. 2, 8,800 white people, 11,300 Negroes: “... Negroes serve as\r\njurors in this parish to a limited extent. The jury commissioners, when\r\nthey know of an exceptionally good, honest, sober and industrious Negro,\r\nhave no objections to placing his name in the jury-box. It is true,\r\nhowever, that the number is very limited, owing to the fact that very\r\nfew Negroes will come to the standard as far as the above qualifications\r\nare concerned. Out of the 300 names in the jury-box from which we draw\r\nour juries, there are about a dozen Negroes. The Negroes as jurors do\r\nnot give any trouble; they always follow the suggestions and advice of\r\nthe white jurors.”\r\n\r\nParish No. 3, 11,000 white people, 17,800 Negroes: “... in this parish\r\nNegroes have served on both our grand and petit juries ever since the\r\nCivil War. Only the very best of our Negroes are drawn on the jury; they\r\nusually constitute about one-half of the panel on the petit jury and on\r\nthe grand jury they are always represented, but in a much smaller\r\nproportion. The number of Negroes with us fit for jury service is not\r\nincreasing as one would think would be the case considering their\r\nadvantage for an education. They render very good service, rather prone\r\nto convict in serious personal injury cases, inflict capital punishment\r\nmore readily than white juries and generally want all law enforced,\r\nespecially against bad men of their own race, as they know this is their\r\nbest protection.”\r\n\r\nParish No. 4, 2,000 white people, 13,700 Negroes: “... we have had one\r\nNegro on the petit jury the last criminal term of court in a murder case\r\nof another Negro. He is the only Negro that has sat on the jury for two\r\nor three years in our parish. We do not allow any Negroes to sit on the\r\ngrand jury in our parish. There are three names of Negroes in the\r\njury-box that we draw our general venire from, as well as I remember,\r\npossibly one or two more, but not more than that number, as well as I\r\nremember. We used to have as many Negroes as white jurors here ten or\r\ntwelve years ago.”\r\n\r\n_Mississippi._—County No. 1, 4,000 white people, 31,000 Negroes: “...\r\nNegroes do serve on juries in our circuit courts, also in our\r\nmagistrate’s court. As to the extent Negro jurors serve Negro jurors are\r\ndecreasing in late years. It requires certain qualifications to make\r\nthem competent under the Constitution of the State of Mississippi,\r\nto-wit: Every male inhabitant of the State, except idiots, insane\r\npersons, and Indians not taxed, who is a citizen of the United States,\r\ntwenty-one years old and upwards, who resided in the State two years,\r\nand one year in the election district, or in the incorporated city or\r\ntown in which he offers to vote, and who is duly registered, and has\r\nnever been convicted of bribery, burglary, theft, arson, obtaining money\r\nor goods under false pretenses, perjury, forgery, embezzlement or\r\nbigamy, and who has paid, on or before the first day of February of the\r\nyear in which he shall offer to vote, all taxes which have been legally\r\nrequired of him, and is able to read any section of the Constitution of\r\nthe State, or is able to understand the same, when read to him, is a\r\nqualified voter, and can be a member of either our grand jury or a petit\r\njury if drawn as such. Our Negro jurors are either ministers or school\r\nteachers, with some farmers. The majority of them fail to pay their\r\ntaxes, which disqualifies them from jury service. Negro jurors are not\r\nregarded by our courts as good jurymen, but we are compelled to use them\r\nwhen drawn and they are qualified to serve.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 8,000 white people, 11,700 Negroes: “... Negroes sitting\r\non jury and paying poll-tax is a thing of the past in my county. Only\r\nabout 25 or 30 [are] registered. Disfranchised on educational\r\nqualification.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 3,000 white people, 23,000 Negroes: “In my judicial\r\ndistrict there are five counties, in three of which Negroes serve upon\r\nthe juries in about the proportion that they are qualified under the\r\nlaw. The qualifications for jurors are very strict in this State and\r\ncomparatively few Negroes can qualify legally. In limited numbers they\r\nmake very satisfactory jurors when the rights of their people are\r\ninvolved. As a rule, a Negro does not like to try a white man’s case;\r\nthey are much more inclined to convict Negroes charged with crime than\r\nare the white jurors, and Negro defendants always challenge Negro\r\njurors. In the ‘Black Belt’ of Mississippi, a Negro can always receive a\r\nfair trial in the courts, but this is not so certain in the white\r\ncounties. In the two counties where Negroes do not serve upon the\r\njuries, there are practically no Negroes qualified under the law,\r\nbecause none are registered voters.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 6,000 white people, 18,000 Negroes: “We don’t have any\r\nNegro jurors at all in this county. We have very few registered Negroes\r\nin the county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 5, 7,000 white people, 7,000 Negroes: “... Negroes do sit on\r\njuries in this county at times. They have a right to serve as jurors\r\nwhen they have duly registered and paid their tax and some other\r\nqualifications.... But the Board of Supervisors draws the names of 200\r\nor more persons on the first Monday of January in each year and puts\r\nthem in a box, so many for each supervisor’s district. But of late years\r\nthe supervisors have not put many names of Negroes in the jury-box;\r\ntherefore, we have not had very [many] Negro jurors. But we have one or\r\ntwo Negro jurors nearly every term of our court [circuit court]....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 6, 8,000 white people, 28,700 Negroes: “The jury law in this\r\nState makes no discrimination on account of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition of servitude, and no man is excluded from the jury on account\r\nof his color.... In some of the counties of the State, the boards of\r\nsupervisors select some Negroes for jury service, but the great trouble\r\nis, there are comparatively few Negroes in any county, and none in some\r\nof the counties, who can measure up to the qualifications prescribed by\r\nlaw.... The criminal element in Mississippi is composed largely of the\r\nNegro race, and as a matter of fact, the persons of that race charged\r\nwith crime and the lawyers who defend them, the large majority of whom\r\nare of the white race, do not want Negroes on the jury, and Negroes are\r\nalmost invariably challenged. If Negroes chance to be summoned on a\r\nspecial venire in a capital case with white men, they [the Negroes]\r\ndisqualify to avoid service, sometimes by claiming that they are not\r\nregistered voters, but generally by claiming that they are opposed to\r\nthe death penalty.\r\n\r\n“The following incident happened in one of our courts and may help to\r\nshed some light on the subject-matter wanted: A Negro was indicted for\r\nmanslaughter. He was too poor to employ counsel to conduct his case, and\r\nit not being a capital case, the court could not appoint counsel for\r\nhim, and told him so. He said he would do the best he could without a\r\nlawyer, and the court told him of his rights under the law, that he\r\ncould look over the jury, and of his right to challenge four of them if\r\nhe was dissatisfied with the panel as it stood. There were four Negroes\r\non the jury, and he very promptly advised the court that he was not\r\nsatisfied; the court told him he had a right to object to four of them,\r\nand he very quickly told the court, ‘Ef dat is so, dem niggers can stand\r\naside.’ They were excused by the court, and the sheriff was ordered to\r\ncomplete the panel from the very best citizens to be had, which was\r\ndone, the jury being, when complete, all white men. The defendant\r\naddressed the jury in his own defence and was acquitted.\r\n\r\n“In my county ... we have had no Negroes on the jury for the past 15\r\nyears or more. We have some 30,000 colored population in this\r\ncounty, ... and we have only about 175 registered in the county. The\r\nboard of supervisors, as a rule, does not place their names in the box,\r\nfor the reason that, as above stated, they will not serve if any way out\r\nof it can be found.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 7, 1,000 white people, 4,000 Negroes: “... we have no Negro\r\njurors in this county at all.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 8, 8,000 white people, 12,000 Negroes: “There are only 400\r\nwhite qualified electors in this county, only about 30 qualified Negro\r\nelectors. We never have a term of court without having several Negroes\r\non it, besides we always have Negroes on the trial juries. It is not\r\noften that they sit on a case unless a Negro lawyer has one side of it.\r\nThey do not believe in convicting one of their color. They are\r\nobjectionable in every sense of the word. They are not regarded by the\r\nother members of the jury. Negro jurors are on the increase in recent\r\nyears....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 9, 4,000 white people, 12,000 Negroes: “No Negroes have\r\nserved on jury in this county since Republican party.”\r\n\r\n_Missouri._—County No. 1, 24,000 white people, 4,500 Negroes: “... As\r\nfar as I am informed, and certainly since I have been connected with the\r\ncourt here, no Negroes have served as jurors either in our court or in\r\nany justice of the peace court in this county. While probably under our\r\nlaws Negroes would be legal jurors, the county court of this county will\r\nnot draw them as jurors, and the Sheriff, when he has to get jurors,\r\nwill not summon them. And I do not believe our lawyers here would permit\r\na Negro to remain on a jury before which they would have to try a case.\r\nFurther, I am sure that no white man here would serve on a jury with a\r\nNegro, even though his refusal to so serve would subject him to a jail\r\nsentence....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 21,000 white people, 4,000 Negroes: “... we have never\r\nknown of a Negro juror in ... county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 28,000 white people, 4,700 Negroes: “Negroes never have\r\nthis burden heaped upon them in this State.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 540,000 white people, 35,500 Negroes: “We do not have many\r\nNegro jurors. I have occupied this post but six months, and in that time\r\nwe have had but two Negroes called for service. Our jury canvass is made\r\nbiennially. All names placed in the wheel are taken just as drawn from\r\nthe same on orders from the various divisions of court. A few of the\r\nmore intelligent Negroes are placed on the jury list. I made inquiry\r\nwhen two Negroes served on a jury last week. The other jurors did not\r\nseem to feel any antipathy. Of course, a little surprise was manifested\r\nat seeing them in court when their names were called. Neither the\r\nattorneys for the plaintiff nor [for] the defence challenged them but\r\naccepted them on the jury. My predecessors never placed many of the\r\nNegroes’ names in the wheel as I understand from them.” This letter was\r\nfrom the jury commissioner, not the clerk of the court.\r\n\r\n_North Carolina._—County No. 1, 6,800 white people, 8,000 Negroes: “...\r\nof late years very few Negroes serve on the juries in this county for\r\nthe reasons that they are an illiterate race and moral character not\r\nwhat it should be. Further, he is easily influenced, deciding with a\r\njuror whom he may like instead of weighing the evidence and deciding\r\naccordingly. The number of Negro jurors has decreased for the past few\r\nyears on account of the Negro of to-day [being] morally not as good as\r\nthe Negro of several years ago.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 11,000 white people, 19,000 Negroes: “I will say that\r\nNegroes do not serve on the jury in this county and have not since we,\r\nthe white people, got the government in our hands. When the Republican\r\nparty was in power Negroes were drawn, both regular and talis jurors,\r\nand not one out of one hundred was a competent juror, but, strange to\r\nsay, when a Negro was on trial, he would always prefer the white men to\r\ntry his case.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 5,800 white people, 8,300 Negroes: “Negroes occasionally\r\nserve on juries in ... county, but not to as great extent as they did\r\nbefore the passage of the Amendment [the suffrage amendment in 1900].\r\nThe County Commissioners have been more particular about the names that\r\nare left in the box from which jurors are drawn. Only the best, most\r\nreliable and most intelligent Negroes are left in the box. Sometimes it\r\nhappens that a few are called as talismen, but not then until the\r\nsheriff has exhausted his best efforts to get white men. Those called\r\nare very apt to be good, reliable men, and with a majority of white men\r\nin the jury-box are not disposed or able to do wrong. My experience as\r\nclerk for 20 years is that they make good jurors, and are apt to be\r\ndisposed, in criminal actions, to execute the law even against their own\r\nrace. Judge ... says that white men on the jury are everywhere disposed\r\nto lean toward a Negro litigant, especially if the Negro is of the\r\nold-class, before-the-war Negro gentleman and the white man is of these\r\nlater days ‘common trash.’ I am told by the judges that in some counties\r\nthe sheriffs would not dare to call a Negro as a talisman even, but, as\r\nI have said, we have them not very frequently and without complaint. I\r\nnotice that the opposing lawyers are slow in challenging them when so\r\ncalled....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 12,600 white people, 13,100 Negroes: “...

We still have\r\nsome Negro jurors at every term of our courts, but not near so many as\r\nin former years. Our County Commissioners ... are very careful in\r\nputting the names of only good, respectable Negroes in the jury box. The\r\nconsequence is we have very few Negroes on our juries, but those we have\r\nare well disposed and the most intelligent Negroes of the county, and\r\nmake very acceptable jurors. I have been struck with the fact that our\r\nlawyers in selecting the jury for both criminal and civil cases, seldom\r\never object to the Negroes who are on the regular panel. If this is\r\nalways kept up, with only the best and most intelligent Negroes in the\r\ncounty in the jury-box, all will be well and our people will not object.\r\nBut in former years, when sometimes the majority of the jury would be\r\nNegroes, there was great dissatisfaction.”\r\n\r\n_Oklahoma._—County No. 1, 15,000 white people, 2,400 Negroes: “Negroes\r\nhave served on both grand and petit juries nearly every term of court\r\nwith the exception of the last two terms of the district court. There\r\nare some Negro names in the box, but they did not happen to be drawn by\r\nthe Sheriff or myself. The men who have sat have given satisfaction to\r\nthe litigants, but have been objectionable to the other jurors. Where it\r\nhas come to a locked-up jury, and where they have to eat and be closely\r\nconfined with the white man, I have heard some complaint. The court and\r\nofficials who are all white Republicans—except the sheriff—treat Negroes\r\nwith utmost fairness.”\r\n\r\n_South Carolina._—County No. 1, 9,000 white people, 19,000 Negroes: “...\r\nI have only been in office for [the] last four years, but since I have\r\nbeen in office I have had a good many Negroes on juries. Year before\r\nlast I had Negroes on juries three consecutive courts, and every year I\r\nhave several of them. We always put the names of those qualified to act\r\nin our jury-box, but it is a bad condition of affairs when you go over\r\nthe Negroes of the county, and find how few are qualified to act. The\r\nNegro jurors have increased in our section.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 5,000 white people, 17,000 Negroes: “... The number of\r\nNegro jurors has decreased in late years. I do not think that a great\r\nnumber of Negro jurors would impress very favorably the court and the\r\npeople at large.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 10,000 white people, 19,000 Negroes: “... I do not\r\nremember ever to have seen a Negro on the jury in this county. I am\r\ntold, however, that one served occasionally for only awhile after 1876.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 18,000 white people, 41,000 Negroes: “In my experience\r\ncovering ten years or more, I find it difficult to get a large array of\r\ncompetent jurors.

As to\r\nNegro jurors ... as a rule, in the County Court about one-tenth are\r\nNegroes, and they are rarely ever discriminated against. I do not recall\r\na case where they have been rejected on account of race or color by\r\nwhite men. As a rule, they are not so acceptable to Negro litigants as\r\nthey are to those of the other races. There are a larger per cent. of\r\nNegroes in the district court, and there is rarely any criticism. In\r\nfact, no prejudice exists here against them as jurors, largely from the\r\nfact that only our best Negro citizens are drawn on the juries.... I\r\nthink the per cent. of Negro jurors has increased. They are simply\r\naccepted or struck off as any other citizen. I believe more are accepted\r\nby white than colored litigants. They have served on some of our very\r\nimportant cases....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 14,000 white people, 9,000 Negroes: “We haven’t had any\r\nNegroes on the jury in ... county for several years.

It has been the\r\nrule of ... county to have Negroes on the grand and petit juries. They\r\nhave given satisfaction. The colored jurors are represented by about 25\r\nper cent. of the jurors.”\r\n\r\nThe cases quoted from in the earlier part of this chapter show even\r\nbetter than these letters the attitude of Texas toward Negro jurors.\r\n\r\n_Virginia._—County No. 1, 6,700 white people, 8,500 Negroes: “No Negro\r\njuror in this court for ten years, and I don’t think that there will\r\never be....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 2, 3,900 white people, 5,500 Negroes: “... from\r\nreconstruction days up to ten or twelve years ago a few Negroes served\r\non the jury of this county. My impression is ... that they made very\r\nlittle impression in the jury, and they were completely dominated by\r\nwhite men in said bodies, who were, of course, greatly in the majority.\r\nAt this time no Negro jurors are drawn at all.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 3, 3,000 white people, 6,000 Negroes: “... there are no\r\nNegroes on our jury list. On several occasions when we had to make up a\r\njury we have put a few on. The impression is here that it does not do to\r\nmix the races even in the jury-box.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 4, 17,900 white people, 19,200 Negroes: “Negroes under our\r\nConstitution are not debarred from serving as jurors in Virginia, but\r\nowing to the nature and disposition of the Negro to follow and not lead,\r\nwe seldom place them on trial juries.

There is hardly ever a jury drawn without some Negroes being\r\non it. Of course, the judge selects those Negroes who are best qualified\r\nfor the service.... Naturally, the number of Negro jurors is not near so\r\nlarge as that of the whites, for the reason ... that all jurors are\r\nselected with reference to their qualifications.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 6, 4,000 white people, 4,800 Negroes: “... we never have any\r\nNegroes on juries in my county. Haven’t had any for about fifteen\r\nyears....”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 7, 10,000 white people, 13,000 Negroes: “... Negroes do not\r\nserve on juries in this county, and it has been about twenty years since\r\nthey did jury service here.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 8, 2,300 white people, 4,400 Negroes: “Since the adoption of\r\nthe new Constitution for this State ... Negroes no longer serve as\r\njurors in this county. Prior to that time they appeared regularly in our\r\ncourts, and made good jurors in the civil as well as criminal business.\r\nOf course, in selecting them, only the best of their race were chosen.\r\nAnd I can’t recall an instance, with an experience of sixteen years as\r\nclerk of the courts, that any objection was ever raised against them as\r\njurors.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 9, 5,500 white people, 5,600 Negroes: “We don’t have colored\r\nmen on jury in this county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 10, 9,000 white people, 13,600 Negroes: “Negroes are not\r\nallowed to serve on juries in this county.”\r\n\r\nCounty No. 11, 1,100 white people, 3,700 Negroes: “We have not had any\r\nNegroes to serve on the jury in this county for twelve or fifteen years,\r\nand when they did, they gave very poor satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n_Summary_: With such incomplete statistics, conclusions as to the actual\r\nservice of the Negro as a juror can hardly be more than guesses. Some of\r\nthe clerks of court say that the number of Negro jurors in their\r\ncounties is increasing; others, that it is decreasing. Some say that\r\nrace does not come into the consideration of fitness for jury service;\r\nothers, that Negroes are not allowed on juries at all. Some say that\r\nNegro jurors have given satisfaction; others, that they have been\r\nscarcely more than figureheads following the lead of white jurors.\r\nSeveral of the clerks think that Negro litigants are reluctant to have\r\nNegro jurors sit on their cases. Some feel that Negro jurors are more\r\nprone to convict than white jurors are. It is undoubtedly true that\r\nthere are not as many Negroes qualified for jury service under the laws\r\nof the Southern States as there were twenty-five years ago, say. Usually\r\none must be an elector to be qualified for jury service. The great\r\nmajority of the Negroes have been unable to satisfy the suffrage tests\r\nand have been disfranchised. They are, consequently, not electors and\r\nnot eligible to serve as jurors. Hence, if the selection of jurors is\r\nconducted with absolute impartiality, there will be comparatively few\r\nNegroes retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SEPARATE COURTS\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina appears to be the only State which has ever provided a\r\nseparate court for the trial of cases in which Negroes have interests at\r\nissue. That was called the District Court, provided for by a\r\nstatute[648] approved December 19, 1865, which statute was repealed\r\nSeptember 21, 1866; so the law was in force less than a year. The\r\nseventh section of the act of forty-nine sections is: “The District\r\nCourt shall have exclusive jurisdiction, subject to appeal, of all civil\r\ncases where one or both of the parties are persons of color, and of all\r\ncriminal cases wherein the accused is a person of color, and also of all\r\ncases of misdemeanor affecting the person or property of a person of\r\ncolor, and of all cases of bastardy, and of all cases of vagrancy, not\r\ntried before a Magistrate....” The Magistrate was given jurisdiction\r\nover small disputes, controversies and complaints that arose in his\r\nneighborhood between persons of color, or between persons of color and\r\nwhite persons, and of petty misdemeanors committed by or toward persons\r\nof color, between master and servant, between master and apprentice, and\r\nbetween employer and laborer, and civil suits involving not over twenty\r\ndollars in which a person of color was a party. An indictment of a white\r\nperson for the homicide of a person of color had to be tried in the\r\nregular superior court; and so had all other indictments in which a\r\nwhite person was accused of a capital felony affecting the person or\r\nproperty of a person of color. In these forty-nine sections the\r\njurisdiction of this special court for persons of color is worked out in\r\ndetail; but inasmuch as the law was in force less than a year and was\r\none of the ephemeral “Black Laws” already considered, there is no need\r\nto go into it further. Suffice it to say that in the South at present,\r\nas in other sections, the people of all races and colors have their\r\nrights adjudicated by the same court.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DIFFERENT PUNISHMENTS\r\n\r\nAlabama, Florida, and Georgia prescribe a heavier punishment for\r\nfornication and adultery between white people and Negroes than between\r\nmembers of the same race. On first consideration this appears to be a\r\ncase of different punishment. As was said by the Supreme Court of\r\nAlabama[649]: “The fact that a different punishment is affixed to the\r\noffence of adultery when committed between a Negro and a white person,\r\nand when committed between two white persons or two Negroes, does not\r\nconstitute a discrimination against or in favor of either race. The\r\ndiscrimination is not directed against the person of any particular\r\ncolor or race, but against the offence, the nature of which is\r\ndetermined by the opposite colors of the cohabiting parties. The\r\npunishment of each offending party, white and black, is precisely the\r\nsame.” The constitutionality of these statutes as to cohabitation\r\nbetween persons of different races has been upheld by the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States.[650]\r\n\r\nThe following are instances of race distinction in the matter of\r\noffences and punishment. South Carolina,[651] in 1865, said that a\r\nperson of color who committed assault upon a white woman with intent to\r\nravish her, or who had sexual intercourse with a white woman by\r\nimpersonating her husband, should be guilty of a felony “without benefit\r\nof clergy.” Florida[652] made it a capital crime to assault a white\r\nfemale with intent to commit rape or to be accessory thereto.\r\nKentucky[653] provided that all persons, without distinction of color,\r\nwould be subject to the same pains and penalties for felonies and\r\nmisdemeanors, adding: “The laws now in force for the punishment of\r\nNegroes and mulattoes for rape on white women are hereby continued in\r\nforce.” This was amended[654] in 1869, but the offence was still against\r\nwhite women. The race distinction in these statutes lies in the fact\r\nthat heavy punishment was prescribed for an assault upon a white woman,\r\nbut no such protection was accorded a Negro woman.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina made it a felony “with benefit of clergy” for a servant\r\nto steal a chattel, money, or valuable security to the value of ten\r\ndollars belonging to, or in the possession or power of his master or\r\nemployer. It was an “aggravated misdemeanor” for a servant to steal such\r\nproperty below the value of five dollars. The servant had no right to\r\nsell any farm produce without the written evidence from his master or\r\nthe District Judge or Magistrate that he had a right to do so. But all\r\nsuch race distinctions in the matter of punishment passed away, as did\r\nthe other “Black Laws,” in 1866.\r\n\r\nThere are certain statutes as to crimes which, though they do not\r\nmention the Negro in so many words, are thought by many to have peculiar\r\napplication to him. The vagrancy laws of the Southern States, for\r\ninstance, have been considered as directed primarily against Negroes.\r\nSome of the States made it a crime for one to sell cotton in bags\r\nbetween certain hours of the night. This was probably a result of the\r\nhabit attributed to the Negro of hiding cotton in the jambs of the\r\nfences and woods in the daytime to take to the cross-roads store at\r\nnight. Missouri,[655] in 1903, made chicken-stealing a felony punishable\r\nby imprisonment for five years, or a fine of two hundred dollars. The\r\nnext year, Kentucky[656] passed the following statute: “That if any\r\nperson shall steal chickens, turkeys, ducks, or other fowls of the value\r\nof two dollars, or more, he shall be confined in the penitentiary not\r\nless than one nor more than five years.” Whether this is an indirect\r\nrace distinction or not, the writer will not take it upon himself to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nSome of the States have enacted statutes to the effect that the\r\npunishment for the members of all races shall be the same for the same\r\noffence. Delaware[657] did so in 1867. In Mississippi,[658] in 1865,\r\nNegroes were given the right to procure the arrest of a white person;\r\nbut, if the arrest were false and malicious, the Negro must pay all the\r\ncosts, be fined not over fifty dollars, and imprisoned not over twenty\r\ndays. In 1867, however, a statute said that Negroes must have the same\r\npunishment as white people. South Carolina,[659] as has been seen,\r\nrepealed all laws prescribing different punishment for Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting bit of news is taken from an Associated Press\r\nreport of July 21, 1909: “Mobile, Ala.—The commissioners to-day\r\nestablished a curfew law for Negroes. Commencing to-night, all the\r\nblacks must be at home or in bed at 10 P.M. Any of them caught wandering\r\nat large will be locked up. This action is due to an epidemic of\r\nhold-ups perpetrated by Negroes.”\r\n\r\nA recent instance of race distinction in the court room seems to come\r\nfrom New York. A Pullman porter, named Griffin, was arrested in\r\nMontreal, charged with stealing a pocket-book, but the charge was not\r\nsubstantiated and he was released. He thereupon brought suit against\r\nDaniel F. Brady, who caused his arrest, and obtained a verdict for two\r\nthousand five hundred dollars in damages. The Supreme Court of New York\r\nreduced the damages from two thousand five hundred dollars to three\r\nhundred dollars. Upon an appeal by Griffin, the appellate division of\r\nthe Supreme Court sustained the order reducing the damages. The\r\nfollowing is a part of the opinion of Judge Drugo of the Supreme\r\nCourt[660] whose order was sustained: “You cannot say that he [Griffin]\r\nis just the same as a white man, when you come to say how much his name\r\nwill suffer. He might suffer more. But, after all, what are the\r\nprobabilities about it? Is it likely that when a colored man is arrested\r\nand imprisoned he feels just as much shame as a white man of any\r\ncircumstance might?\r\n\r\n“I think if you were to take the Mayor of the city and arrest him he\r\nwould feel very much more humiliated than this porter, from the fact\r\nthat he was the Mayor and not a colored man, for if a colored man he\r\nmight not feel quite as much humiliation and shame.\r\n\r\n“In one sense a colored man is just as good as a white man, for the law\r\nsays he is, but he has not the same amount of injury under all\r\ncircumstances that a white man would have. Maybe in a colored community\r\ndown South, where white men were held in great disfavor, he might be\r\nmore injured, but after all that is not this sort of a community. In\r\nthis sort of a community, I dare say the amount of evil that would flow\r\nto the colored man would not be as great as it probably would be to a\r\nwhite man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Ia., 1870, p. 21.\r\n\r\nFootnote 590:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Colo., 1897, p. 115.\r\n\r\nFootnote 591:\r\n\r\n  Laws of Md., 1872, p. 134; 1876, p. 469.\r\n\r\nFootnote 592:\r\n\r\n  _In re_ Taylor, 1877, 48 Md. 28, at p. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 593:\r\n\r\n  Bradwell v.

It is plain that, if a State or the United States makes a law\r\nthat in any way denies or abridges the right of a citizen to vote on\r\naccount of his race, such an enactment is in violation of the Amendment.\r\nThe only State or Federal statute or State constitutional provision\r\ninvolving a race distinction that would be valid under the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment would be one that did not amount to a denial or abridgment of\r\nthe right to vote. For instance, a State might require white and Negro\r\nelectors to cast their ballots in different boxes, or in different parts\r\nof the booth, or even in different booths; or it might require them to\r\nregister on different days, or before different registrars. If the Negro\r\nwas given the same opportunity to register and vote as the white man,\r\nthe requirements of separate registering and balloting would be race\r\ndistinctions in the matter of suffrage, but they would not be denials or\r\nabridgments of the right to vote and, hence, might be supported under\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment. Any such requirements have not been found in\r\nthe State Constitutions or statutes; they are only suggested as possible\r\nrace distinctions which might be permissible.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the race distinctions to be considered in\r\nthis chapter exist, not in conformity to law, as in the case of separate\r\nschools and public conveyances, but in defiance of law or by legal\r\nsubterfuges, and are properly called discriminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NEGRO SUFFRAGE BEFORE 1865\r\n\r\nThe suffrage requirements as to race up to 1865 serve as a background\r\nfor the events after that date. A review[661] of the acts of territorial\r\ngovernment and State Constitutions of the Territories and States of the\r\nUnited States reveals the following facts: Maine, Massachusetts, New\r\nHampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont appear not to have had any race\r\ndistinctions in suffrage. Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado,\r\nFlorida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina,\r\nand West Virginia never permitted any but white males to vote at any\r\ntime between the Revolution and 1865. The Constitutions of Kansas[662]\r\nof 1855 and of Minnesota[663] of 1857 permitted civilized Indians to\r\nvote, though the same privilege was not extended to Negroes.\r\nKentucky,[664] in 1799, gave the suffrage to “free” persons, but\r\nexpressly excepted Negroes, mulattoes, and Indians. Texas,[665] in 1845,\r\ngave the right to vote to free male persons but excepted Indians not\r\ntaxed, Africans, and descendants of Africans.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-named States which either made no race distinctions at\r\nall or else always made distinctions as to Negroes, several States, at\r\none time or another, extended a limited suffrage to Negroes. The\r\nConstitution of New York[666] of 1821, giving the right to vote to male\r\ncitizens, had the provision that “no man of color, unless he shall have\r\nbeen for three years a citizen of this State, and for one year next\r\npreceding any election shall be seized and possessed of a freehold\r\nestate of the value of two hundred and fifty dollars, over and above all\r\ndebts and incumbrances charged thereon, and shall have been actually\r\nrated and paid a tax thereon, shall be entitled to vote at any such\r\nelection.” There was no property test for white voters. The\r\nConstitution[667] of 1846 had the same provision about Negro voters. The\r\nquestion of equal suffrage to Negroes was submitted[668] separately in\r\n1846, and rejected by a vote of 85,306 to 223,834. It was again\r\nsubmitted in 1860, with like result, the vote being 197,503 to 337,984.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of North Carolina[669] of 1835, as amended, provided\r\nthat no free Negro, free mulatto, or free person of mixed blood,\r\ndescended from Negro ancestors to the fourth generation inclusive,\r\nthough one ancestor in each generation might have been a white person,\r\nshould vote for members of the “senate or house of commons” of the\r\nState. Negroes who paid a certain poll tax were allowed to vote until\r\nthis Amendment went into effect. Governor W. W. Kitchin,[670] of that\r\nState, says: “There were 21,000 free Negroes in North Carolina in 1835,\r\n4,000 of whom were entitled then to vote.” After 1835 Negroes were not\r\nallowed to vote there again until after the War.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of Tennessee[671] of 1834 provided that no person\r\nshould be disqualified from voting in any election who was then by the\r\nlaws of the State a competent witness in a court of justice against a\r\nwhite person. One cannot tell how many Negroes were qualified to vote\r\nunder this provision. The Constitution of Wisconsin[672] of 1848 limited\r\nthe privilege of voting to white persons, but the Supreme Court[673] of\r\nthat State held in 1866 that suffrage had been extended to Negroes by a\r\nvote of the people at the general election on November 6, 1849.\r\n\r\nSeveral States which at first allowed Negro freemen to vote later\r\nwithdrew the privilege. Until the Revolution, they were allowed to vote\r\nin every State except Georgia and South Carolina. Between 1792 and 1834,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky denied the suffrage to\r\nNegroes. As has been seen, North Carolina permitted a restricted Negro\r\nsuffrage until 1835. New Jersey took the suffrage from the Negro in\r\n1807, Connecticut in 1814, and Pennsylvania in 1838; and Tennessee, in\r\n1834, limited the right to those Negroes who were competent as witnesses\r\nagainst white persons. New York, in 1821, required a very high property\r\nqualification not required of white persons.[674] Wisconsin alone\r\nchanged its law so as to allow Negroes to vote on equality with white\r\npersons. New York tried twice to do so, but failed each time.\r\n\r\nIn each of the acts of territorial government drawn up by Congress,\r\nsuffrage was restricted to free white persons. This fact, together with\r\nthe fact that the West Virginia Constitution of 1861–63 also restricted\r\nthe suffrage to white persons, tends to show the attitude of the\r\nNational Government in the early days toward Negro suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SUFFRAGE BETWEEN 1865 AND 1870\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the only States that permitted Negroes to vote on the same\r\nfooting as white persons were Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode\r\nIsland, Vermont, and Wisconsin. New York and Tennessee permitted a\r\nrestricted Negro suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the suffrage laws between 1865 and 1870 indicate what\r\nmight have taken place had not the United States interfered with the\r\nFifteenth Amendment. The Reconstruction Constitutions[675] of the\r\nSouthern States in 1868 and 1869 extended the suffrage to Negroes. These\r\nConstitutions, however, did not express the will of the Southern white\r\npeople at the time in regard to suffrage. The Constitution of\r\nMaryland,[676] of 1867, permitted only white persons to vote; and that\r\nof Nebraska,[677] of 1866–67, under which it sought admission to the\r\nUnion, did not give the suffrage to Negroes.\r\n\r\nNegro suffrage was voted down in New York[678] in 1868, as it had been\r\nin 1846 and 1860, by a vote of 282,403 to 249,802. By the act of\r\nterritorial government of Colorado, of 1861, suffrage was restricted to\r\nwhite persons. But an act of the legislature[679] of that Territory,\r\nenacted in November, 1861, seemed to extend the right to vote to\r\nNegroes. This was amended,[680] however, in 1864, by expressly excluding\r\nNegroes and mulattoes from the suffrage. The legislature of\r\nConnecticut[681] of 1865 proposed an amendment to the Constitution\r\nwhereby Negroes would be given the right to vote, the same to be\r\nsubmitted to the people for their ratification. Minnesota[682] and\r\nWisconsin,[683] in 1865, submitted constitutional amendments providing\r\nfor Negro suffrage. According to Representative Hardwick,[684] of\r\nGeorgia, “Negro suffrage was rejected by decisive majorities.” It was\r\nafter the 1865 Amendment had been defeated at the polls in Wisconsin\r\nthat the Supreme Court of that State, as has been seen, held that\r\nNegroes had been given the right to vote by a law of 1849.\r\n\r\nThe word “white” was stricken from the Constitution of Iowa[685] by the\r\nlegislature of 1867–68, and this action was ratified by a vote of\r\n105,384 to 81,384. Minnesota[686] amended its Constitution in 1868 so as\r\nto extend suffrage to Negroes. On December 30, 1867, the word “white”\r\nwas stricken from the election laws of Dakota Territory.[687]\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 1867, Congress passed, over the President’s veto, a bill\r\nfirst introduced in 1865 establishing Negro suffrage in the District of\r\nColumbia. Before its passage, provision had been made by Congress to\r\nsubmit the question to a vote of the people. The extension of suffrage\r\nto Negroes was rejected by a vote of 6,521 to 35 in Washington City and\r\n812 to 1 in Georgetown. In spite of this vote the Thirty-ninth Congress\r\nordained Negro suffrage for the District. After four years, the\r\ngovernment of the District was so changed that suffrage was taken from\r\nall the residents. In 1866, Congress established Negro suffrage in all\r\nthe Territories of the United States.[688]\r\n\r\nThe second section of the Fourteenth Amendment, proposed June 16, 1866,\r\nand declared in force June 28, 1868, reads: “Representatives shall be\r\napportioned among the several States according to their respective\r\nnumbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding\r\nIndians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the\r\nchoice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers\r\nof a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any\r\nof the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,\r\nand citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for\r\nparticipation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation\r\ntherein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male\r\ncitizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one\r\nyears of age in such State.” The Amendment did not prohibit the denial\r\nor abridgment of the right to vote on account of race or color, but\r\nprovided that, if such right was denied or abridged, the State must\r\nsuffer the consequence of having its representation in Congress reduced.\r\nOne feels safe in saying that the purpose of the National Government in\r\nadopting this section of the Fourteenth Amendment was to induce the\r\nStates, particularly the Southern States, to extend suffrage to the\r\nNegro. With the possible exception of Minnesota, no State appears to\r\nhave heeded the warning between 1868 and 1870.\r\n\r\nOne cannot say what would have been the result had the National\r\nGovernment rested there—whether or not of their own accord the various\r\nStates would have extended the suffrage to Negroes—because, within less\r\nthan two years, the Fifteenth Amendment had deprived the States of any\r\nchoice in the matter by providing that they _must_ not deny or abridge\r\nthe right to vote on account of race or color.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SUFFRAGE BETWEEN 1870 AND 1890\r\n\r\nAt the time of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, in 1870, the\r\nfollowing States still restricted the suffrage to white persons:\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,\r\nMaryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.\r\nIllinois[689] adopted a new Constitution in 1870 which omitted the word\r\n“white.” Missouri[690] amended its Constitution on November 8, 1870,\r\nafter the Fifteenth Amendment went into effect, by erasing the word\r\n“white,” and Virginia,[691] in its Constitution of 1870, extended the\r\nsuffrage to “male citizens.” It is needless to say that all the\r\nConstitutions adopted since 1870 have omitted the word “white” from the\r\nsuffrage qualifications, so it is not worth while to note the various\r\nConstitutions and Amendments that have been adopted since that date. But\r\nin some State Constitutions which have not been changed within the last\r\nforty years, one still finds the provision that only “white male\r\ncitizens” are electors. This is true of Maryland.[692] Attempts have\r\nbeen made to amend the Constitution by erasing the word “white,” but the\r\nobjection has been made that it is null and void[693] anyway by the\r\nFifteenth Amendment, and that it would be too expensive to call a\r\nconstitutional convention or hold an election solely for the purpose of\r\nerasing a “dead” word.\r\n\r\nThe history of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment—the\r\nopposition it provoked and the means that had to be adopted to procure\r\nits ratification by the Southern States—is found in the records of\r\nCongress, newspapers, and political discussions of that day. Very little\r\nof it has been preserved in the laws of the States. In the following\r\nresolution by the legislature of Oregon[694] is found one of the few\r\ntraces of the opposition to the Amendment occurring in the laws of a\r\nState outside the South:\r\n\r\n“Whereas, the State of Oregon was, on the fourteenth day of February,\r\nA.D., 1859, admitted into the Federal Union, vested with the right to\r\ndeclare what persons should be entitled to vote within her boundaries;\r\nand until she, by her voluntary act, surrenders that right, the Congress\r\nof the United States has no authority to interfere with the conditions\r\nof suffrage within the boundaries of the State of Oregon: and\r\n\r\n“Whereas, the Congress of the United States, by means of an arbitrary\r\nmajority of votes acquired by the power of the bayonet, has sought to\r\nforce upon the several States the so-called Fifteenth Amendment to the\r\nFederal Constitution, in direct violation of the terms under which the\r\nState of Oregon was admitted into the Sisterhood of States; therefore\r\n\r\n“Be it resolved by the Senate, the House concurring:\r\n\r\n“That the so-called Fifteenth Amendment is an infringement upon the\r\npopular rights, and a direct falsification of the pledges made to the\r\nState of Oregon by the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n“Resolved, that the said Fifteenth Amendment be and the same is hereby\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n“Resolved, that the Governor be requested to transmit copies of this\r\nresolution to the Secretary of State of the United States and to the\r\nSenators and Representatives from the State of Oregon in the Congress of\r\nthe United States.”\r\n\r\nThe probable explanation of this opposition of Oregon to the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment lies in its unwillingness to give the ballot to the Japanese,\r\nChinese, and Indians in the State.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of New York[695] toward Negro suffrage in 1870 appears to be\r\ndifferent from that of Oregon. A statute was passed prohibiting any\r\nregistrar or inspector of elections to demand any oath or ask any\r\nquestions of a Negro different from what was demanded of white persons,\r\nor to reject the name of any colored person from registry except for the\r\nsame causes as would make it his duty to reject the name of a white\r\nperson. The violation of this statute was a misdemeanor, punishable by a\r\nfine of five hundred dollars and imprisonment for six months.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the prohibitions of the Fifteenth Amendment effective,\r\non May 31, 1870, two months after the ratification of the Amendment,\r\nCongress passed an Act,[696] the first section of which reads: “All\r\ncitizens of the United States, who are or shall be otherwise qualified\r\nby law to vote at any election by the people in any State, Territory,\r\ndistrict, county, city, parish, township, school district, municipality,\r\nor other territorial division, shall be entitled and allowed to vote at\r\nall such elections without distinction of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition of servitude, any constitution, law, custom, usage, or\r\nregulation in any State, Territory, or by or under its authority, to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nThe fourth section of the “Enforcement Act,” as the Act of 1870 was\r\ncalled, provided for the punishment of any person who should, by force,\r\nbribery, threats, intimidation, or other unlawful means, hinder, delay,\r\nor combine with others to hinder, delay, prevent, or obstruct any\r\ncitizen from doing any act required to be done to qualify him to vote,\r\nor from voting at any election.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, two inspectors of a municipal election in Kentucky were\r\nindicted for refusing to receive and count the vote of a Negro. The\r\nSupreme Court[697] of the United States, to which the case came by\r\nreason of a division of opinion of the Circuit Court, held that the\r\nFifteenth Amendment did not confer the right of suffrage, but rather\r\ninvested citizens with the right of exemption from discrimination in the\r\nexercise of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or\r\nprevious condition of servitude. The fourth section of the Act of 1870,\r\nby its language, did not confine its operation to unlawful\r\ndiscrimination on account of race or color and was, therefore,\r\nunconstitutional. The “Enforcement Act” of 1870, like the Civil Rights\r\nBill of 1875, failed in its desired effect because it was too\r\nfar-reaching in its scope. Had the Act of 1870 been upheld, the Federal\r\nauthorities would have taken complete control of all elections, State as\r\nwell as Federal.\r\n\r\nThe years between 1870 and 1890 are known for the actual race\r\ndistinctions in suffrage. Between 1870 and 1877, the white people of the\r\nSouth were largely disfranchised, not because of their race, but because\r\nof their participation in the War. After 1877, the Negroes were largely\r\ndisfranchised by unlawful methods adopted by the white people of the\r\nSouth. If this were a history of the actual race distinctions in\r\nsuffrage, it would be necessary to consider at length the “tissue\r\nballots,” the stuffing of ballot boxes, the intimidation of Negroes by\r\nthe Ku Klux Klan and other bodies of white men, and other election\r\ndevices and practices in the South at that time. But this study, as has\r\nbeen said before, is confined to the race distinctions _in_ the law, not\r\nthose _in defiance of_ the law. Out of all the suffrage irregularities\r\nof the period very little suffrage law was evolved. Few judicial\r\ndecisions and no statutes bearing directly on the relation of race to\r\nsuffrage have been found.\r\n\r\nSome cases of intimidation of Negroes at the polls reached the courts of\r\nrecord. In Lawrence County, Ohio, in 1870, for instance, two white men\r\nby threats of violence kept three Negroes from voting. One of the white\r\nmen was convicted in the Federal court[698] under the Act of 1870, and\r\nimprisoned six months; the other was acquitted because he had not been\r\nheard to use threatening language. In 1871 a white man in South Carolina\r\nwas convicted in the Federal court[699] for conspiring to keep a Negro\r\nfrom voting at a congressional election. The same year, in a contested\r\nelection for mayor of Leavenworth, Kansas, the defeated candidate\r\nclaimed that he would have been elected had not a number of Negroes been\r\nimproperly kept from voting. He did not show that they had been in the\r\nward thirty days as required by the election law of the State, and the\r\ncourt[700] held that Negroes must satisfy the same requirements as to\r\nresidence as other voters. In a State election in Louisiana, in 1872, it\r\nwas claimed, upon the affidavits of four thousand voters, that the votes\r\nof ten thousand Negroes had been suppressed because of their race and\r\ncolor.[701] A tax collector in Delaware, in 1873, refused or failed to\r\ncollect taxes from Negroes when the payment of taxes was a prerequisite\r\nto voting. The Federal court[702] held that it had jurisdiction because\r\nthe tax collector was a State officer and, thus, it was the State\r\ndenying and abridging the right to vote on account of race. Over one\r\nhundred men were indicted in the Federal court of Louisiana in 1874 for\r\nintimidating Negroes at the polls.[703] The same year the judges of the\r\nmunicipal election of Petersburg, Virginia, were indicted for refusing\r\nto allow a number of Negroes to vote.[704] In 1878, a Negro in Illinois\r\nwho was denied the right to vote at a school election sued and recovered\r\na hundred dollars damages.[705] In Georgia, in 1844, several white men\r\nwere convicted in the circuit court of the United States for\r\nintimidating, beating, and maltreating Negroes to keep them from voting.\r\nThe Supreme Court[706] held that Congress had power to regulate Federal\r\nelections and could prevent such intimidation.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that nearly all of the cases cited above are along\r\nthe same line—intimidation of Negroes to keep them from voting. Several\r\nconstitutional principles, however, relating to suffrage were evolved\r\nout of the cases decided during this period. In some of these cases a\r\nNegro was not a party at all. It was thought at first, for instance,\r\nthat suffrage was a right of citizenship and that the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment entitled every citizen to vote. Consequently, a proceeding was\r\nstarted in the courts of Kentucky in 1874 to establish the right of a\r\nwoman to vote. The case went up to the Supreme Court[707] of the United\r\nStates which held that the Constitution of the United States does not\r\nconfer the right of suffrage upon anyone. Next, it was thought that the\r\nFifteenth Amendment conferred the right to vote upon Negroes, but the\r\ncase of United States v. Reese settled this point by deciding that the\r\nAmendment did not confer upon Negroes the right to vote, but the right\r\nnot to be discriminated in voting on account of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition of servitude.[708] Despite the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\nAmendments, the principle remains that the individual States retain the\r\nright to prescribe the qualifications for voting so long as they do not\r\ndiscriminate against persons on account of race, color, or previous\r\ncondition of servitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SOUTHERN SUFFRAGE AMENDMENTS SINCE 1890\r\n\r\nIn 1890, a distinct departure was made in the development of the law of\r\nsuffrage. For thirteen years, roughly speaking, the Negroes had been in\r\na great measure disfranchised by the illegal means already referred to.\r\nAccording to the Constitutions and laws of the Southern States, the\r\nNegro had precisely the same right to vote as the white person. Yet he\r\ndid not vote, or, if he voted, his ballot came to naught. The Southern\r\nwhite people, wearied of using underhand methods of eliminating the\r\neffect of Negro suffrage, turned to seek a method under the law to\r\naccomplish the same result. The Fifteenth Amendment seemed to offer an\r\ninsuperable obstacle. The problem was how to evade this constitutional\r\nprovision. Speaking of this difficulty, the Supreme Court of\r\nMississippi[709] said: “Within the field of permissible action under the\r\nlimitations proposed by the Federal Constitution, the Convention [the\r\nConstitutional Convention of Mississippi, 1890] swept the field of\r\nexpedients to obstruct the exercise of suffrage by the Negro race. By\r\nreason of its previous condition of servitude and dependency, this race\r\nhad acquired or accentuated certain peculiarities of habit, or\r\ntemperament, and of character, which clearly distinguished it as a race\r\nfrom the whites. A patient, docile people; but careless, landless,\r\nmigratory within certain limits, without forethought; and its criminal\r\nmembers given to furtive offences rather than the robust crimes of the\r\nwhites. Restrained by the Federal Constitution from discriminating\r\nagainst the Negro race, the Convention discriminated against its\r\ncharacteristics and the offences to which its criminal members are\r\nprone.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1890 the Southern States have, one by one, adopted new\r\nConstitutions or amended their old ones so as to change considerably the\r\nqualifications of voters. Suffrage amendments have been adopted by the\r\nSouthern States in the following order: Mississippi,[710] 1890; South\r\nCarolina,[711] 1895; Louisiana,[712] 1898; North Carolina,[713] 1900;\r\nAlabama,[714] 1901; Virginia,[715] 1901; and Georgia,[716] 1908.\r\nMaryland[717] has made two separate attempts, one in 1905 and the other\r\nin 1909, to amend its Constitution, but has failed in both instances.\r\nFlorida, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Texas have not made any constitutional\r\nchanges in the matter of suffrage which might be called “Suffrage\r\nAmendments.”\r\n\r\nThe phrase, “the Suffrage Amendments in the South,” has been used so\r\noften that the idea prevails among those unfamiliar with the laws on the\r\nsubject that suffrage qualifications in the Southern States are\r\nfundamentally different from those in other States. With the hope of\r\nmaking plain wherein suffrage laws in the South are similar to and\r\nwherein they differ from the corresponding laws of other States, a table\r\nof the qualifications of electors in all the States and Territories of\r\nthe United States, including Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the\r\nPhilippines, is given (see pp. 322–339). The requirements for voters\r\nwill be taken in the order given in the tables and considered with\r\nreference to the ways in which they lend themselves to race distinctions\r\nand discriminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Citizenship_\r\n\r\nIn order to vote, one must be a citizen of the United States or an alien\r\nwho has taken the formal step toward naturalization of declaring his\r\nintention to become a citizen, with the exception that, in a few States,\r\nan Indian who has severed his tribal relationship may vote. This\r\nsuffrage qualification does not easily lend itself to race distinction\r\nor discrimination. It lies within the power of the United States, not of\r\nthe States, to say what alien residents may become citizens.[718] If\r\nCongress says, as it does in the Chinese Exclusion Act,[719] that\r\nChinese not natives of this country cannot become citizens, it follows\r\nthat they cannot demand of a State the privilege of voting. At present,\r\na statute[720] specially provides for the naturalization of aliens of\r\nAfrican nativity and persons of African descent, requiring that the same\r\nrules shall apply to them as to free white persons.\r\n\r\nThe only case that has been found involving the citizenship of a Negro\r\narose in Michigan in 1872.[721] A Negro, born in Canada of parents who\r\nhad been slaves in Virginia but who had gone to Canada in 1834, went to\r\nMichigan at the age of twenty. The question was whether he was a citizen\r\nof the United States and, so, entitled to registration as a voter. The\r\nSupreme Court of the State held that, when his parents went to Canada,\r\nthey were no longer under the jurisdiction of this country. The son was\r\nnot born of citizens of the United States, nor was he born under the\r\njurisdiction of the United States, and, therefore, was not a citizen of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe citizenship requirement in the Southern States is essentially the\r\nsame as that in other States and cannot be said, in any way, to involve\r\na race distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _Age_\r\n\r\nIn all of the States and organized Territories an elector must be\r\ntwenty-one years of age or over. In the Philippines the age limit is\r\ntwenty-three. There seems to be no possible race distinction in the age\r\nrequirement. It may be that, because of the less careful record of dates\r\nof birth among Negroes, more of that race are unable to prove that they\r\nare twenty-one years old; but this is only a question of evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _Sex_\r\n\r\nAll except four of the States limit the suffrage to males. This\r\nrequirement cannot possibly involve a race distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Residence_\r\n\r\nAll States and Territories require that the voter shall have resided for\r\na certain length of time previous to the election in the particular\r\nState or Territory, in the County, and in the precinct, ward, town, or\r\nother political division in which he offers to vote. The residence in\r\nthe State varies from three months to two years, in the County or its\r\ncorresponding division from thirty days to one year, and in the\r\nprecinct, ward, or town from ten days to one year. It is noticeable that\r\nin the Southern States the required residence is, as a rule, somewhat\r\nlonger than in the other States. Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, and Virginia all require a residence of two\r\nyears in the State, while Rhode Island is the only State outside the\r\nSouth that requires a State residence of that length. Mississippi is the\r\nonly State that requires a voter to be a resident of the precinct one\r\nyear. Louisiana requires six months in the precinct, while thirty days\r\nis the favorite residence with the other States.\r\n\r\nThe greater term of residence required in the South may lend itself to\r\nrace distinction in case one race is more migratory than the other. If,\r\nfor instance, the Negro is more apt to move about from place to place\r\nthan the white person, more Negroes than whites will be unable to\r\nsatisfy the residence qualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Payment of Taxes_\r\n\r\nThe following States require the payment of poll taxes as a prerequisite\r\nto voting: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Tennessee. Of these Alabama, Arkansas, and North Carolina\r\nrequire the payment of the poll tax for only one year preceding the\r\nelection; Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, for two years preceding;\r\nand Virginia, for three years preceding the election. Some States\r\nrequire payment of both property and poll taxes; and some, only the\r\nlatter. The law of Delaware is that the voter must have paid a county\r\ntax within two years, assessed six months before the election, not\r\nspecifying whether it is a poll or property tax. Georgia provides that\r\nall taxes legally required since 1877 must have been paid six months\r\nbefore the election. Pennsylvania requires the payment of a State or\r\ncounty tax within two years to be assessed two months and paid one month\r\nbefore the election. South Carolina demands, not only the payment of the\r\npoll tax, but of all taxes for the preceding year. In the Philippines,\r\nthe elector must satisfy other tests or show payment of an annual tax of\r\nfifteen dollars.\r\n\r\nThe payment of taxes as a prerequisite to voting is not peculiar to the\r\nSouthern States, such a requirement being found in Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, and the Philippines as well. The poll tax and the\r\nrequirement of payment for more than the year next preceding the\r\nelection are found mostly in the Southern States. In the Philippines\r\nalone, it appears, the payment of taxes is an alternative requirement;\r\nthat is, if one cannot satisfy this qualification, he may, nevertheless,\r\nqualify under other tests; but in the States, he must not only show his\r\npayment of taxes but be qualified as well in other respects.\r\n\r\nIn two ways this qualification lends itself to race distinctions. In the\r\nfirst place, if Negroes are more shiftless and less inclined to pay\r\ntheir taxes than white people, more of them will be unable to satisfy\r\nthis test. Secondly, if they are careless about preserving their tax\r\nreceipts for one, two, or three successive years, they will be unable to\r\nprove the payment of taxes and, thereby, be disqualified to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Ownership of Property_\r\n\r\nThe next qualification may be said to be in a sense peculiar to the\r\nSouthern States, yet not entirely so. In Rhode Island, one must own\r\nproperty worth one hundred and thirty-four dollars on which taxes of the\r\npreceding year have been paid or must pay an annual rental of seven\r\ndollars to be entitled to vote for city councillors and to vote on\r\nquestions of finances. In Alaska, to be entitled to vote in municipal\r\nelections, one must be the owner of substantial property interests in\r\nthe municipality. In the Philippines, the voter must be able to satisfy\r\nother tests or else be the owner of property assessed at two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe property test in the Southern States is an alternative of the\r\neducational tests. That is, if the applicant cannot satisfy the\r\neducational test but can satisfy the property test, he may register and\r\nvote; or he may do so if he can satisfy the education but not the\r\nproperty test. Unless special mention is made at the time, this will be\r\nunderstood in the following discussion of these two qualifications. When\r\nit is said that such and such property or educational qualification is\r\nrequired, it is meant only that it is required in case its alternative\r\ncannot be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, the property requirement is that the applicant for\r\nregistration be the owner or the husband of the owner of forty acres of\r\nland in the State in which they reside or of real or personal property\r\nworth three hundred dollars upon which taxes for the preceding year have\r\nbeen paid. In Georgia the requirement is forty acres of land in the\r\nState or five hundred dollars worth of property in the State. In\r\nLouisiana, the requirement is three hundred dollars worth of property\r\nand payment of the personal taxes. South Carolina prescribes three\r\nhundred dollars worth of property on which the taxes for the preceding\r\nyear have been paid. Of the Southern States which have altered their\r\nsuffrage laws since 1890, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia have\r\nnot provided any permanent property test.\r\n\r\nThe property qualifications cause the disfranchisement of more of one\r\nrace than of the other only in so far as the first is more shiftless and\r\nmore delinquent in the payment of taxes than the other. If the Negro is\r\ngiven the same opportunity as the white to acquire property, he has an\r\nequal opportunity to register under the property clause of the suffrage\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Educational Test_\r\n\r\nIn no sense is the educational qualification peculiar to the Southern\r\nStates. As early as 1855, Connecticut required of voters ability to read\r\nthe State Constitution. The present requirement, as amended in 1897, is\r\nability to read the Constitution and statutes of the State in English.\r\nIn 1857, Massachusetts added as a prerequisite to voting ability to read\r\nthe Constitution of the State in English and write one’s name. The\r\nConstitution of Wyoming of 1889 provides that the applicant for\r\nregistration must be able to read the Constitution of the State.\r\nCalifornia, in 1894, required ability to read the Constitution in\r\nEnglish and write one’s name. Similar requirements were made in Maine in\r\n1893 and in Delaware in 1900. In the territorial possessions of the\r\nUnited States, a Hawaiian elector must read, speak, and write English or\r\nHawaiian, and a Filipino must speak, read, and write English or Spanish.\r\nIn the Philippines this qualification is an alternative of the ownership\r\nof property; in Hawaii and the States mentioned above the educational\r\nqualification is absolute.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States now to be considered, it is to be remembered that\r\nthe applicant must satisfy either the education or the property test,\r\nnot both. In Alabama he must be able to read and write the Constitution\r\nof the United States in English unless physically disabled. In Georgia\r\nhe must be able to read and write in English the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States or of Georgia, or if physically disabled from reading and\r\nwriting, to “understand and give a reasonable interpretation” of the\r\nConstitution of the United States or of Georgia, when read to him. In\r\nLouisiana he must be able to read and write and must make his\r\napplication for registration in his own handwriting. Mississippi\r\nrequires that the applicant must be able to read or understand or\r\nreasonably interpret any part of the Constitution of the State. North\r\nCarolina requires ability to read and write the State Constitution in\r\nEnglish; South Carolina requires also an ability to read and write the\r\nConstitution, but does not specify that the test must be in English.\r\nVirginia does not declare that the applicant must be able to read and\r\nwrite, but requires him to make his application for registration in his\r\nown handwriting, and prepare and deposit his ballot without aid. This\r\ndoes not apply to those registering under the “Grandfather Clause” to be\r\nconsidered later.\r\n\r\nAll States[722] and Territories, except Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and New Mexico have adopted a blanket\r\nofficial ballot which is, in effect, the requirement of an educational\r\nqualification for voting. By this system the State provides a uniform\r\nballot containing the names of all persons of all parties to be voted\r\nfor, and requires the voter to mark and deposit his own ballot. Where no\r\nparty emblem—as the elephant, cock, or anvil—heads the list of\r\ncandidates of a particular party, it is wellnigh impossible for one to\r\nmark his ballot properly unless he is able both to read and write.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States are more lenient in their educational tests than\r\nother States in allowing a person otherwise qualified to vote if he has\r\neither education or property; while in the latter he must have a certain\r\namount of education no matter how much property he owns.\r\n\r\nEducational qualifications easily permit race distinctions in several\r\nways. In the first place, registration officers may give a difficult\r\npassage of the Constitution to a Negro, and a very easy passage to a\r\nwhite person, or _vice versa_. He may permit halting reading by one and\r\nrequire fluent reading by the other. He may let illegible scratching on\r\npaper suffice for the signature of one and require of the other a\r\nlegible handwriting. But race discriminations in such cases rest with\r\nthe officers; they do not have their basis in the law itself.\r\n\r\nThe educational clause of the proposed Maryland suffrage amendment,\r\nrecently defeated at the polls by the voters of that State, restricted\r\nthe right to vote to a “person who, in the presence of the officers of\r\nregistration, shall, in his own handwriting, with pen and ink, without\r\nany aid, suggestion, or memorandum whatever addressed to him by any of\r\nthe officers of registration, make application to register correctly,\r\nstating in such application his name, age, date, and place of birth;\r\nresidence and occupation at the time and for the two years next\r\npreceding; the name or names of his employer or employers, if any, at\r\nthe time and for the two years next preceding; and whether he has\r\npreviously voted, and, if so, the State, county, city, and district, or\r\nprecinct in which he voted last. Also the name in full of the President\r\nof the United States, of one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, of the Governor of Maryland, of one of the Judges of the\r\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland, and of the Mayor of Baltimore City, if the\r\napplicant resides in Baltimore City, or of one of the County\r\nCommissioners of the County in which the applicant resides.” It is easy\r\nto see how race discriminations could have been made under this proposed\r\namendment, but it need not be discussed inasmuch as it failed to become\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “_Grandfather Clauses_”\r\n\r\nThe “Grandfather Clauses” are, in a real sense, peculiar to the Southern\r\nStates, though there are a few somewhat similar provisions in other\r\nStates. For instance, Illinois, by its Constitution of 1870, allowed\r\nthose to vote who had the right to vote on April 1, 1848, provided, of\r\ncourse, they satisfied the age, sex, and residence qualifications. When\r\nMaine added its educational requirement in 1893, it provided that this\r\nqualification should not apply to anyone who had the right to vote in\r\nJanuary, 1893, or to anyone sixty years of age at that time.\r\nMassachusetts had made a similar provision in 1857. The Constitution of\r\nWyoming of 1889 had said that nothing in it, except the provisions about\r\nidiots, lunatics, and convicts, should be construed to deprive any one\r\nof the right to vote who had that right at the time of the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution. New Hampshire does not allow paupers to vote, but it\r\nprovides that one who served in the Rebellion and was honorably\r\ndischarged shall not be disfranchised because he has received aid from\r\nthe public. In the Philippines, one unable to satisfy the educational or\r\nproperty test, may, nevertheless, vote if he held a substantial office\r\nunder the Spanish régime.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the “Grandfather Clause,” in short, is that one who is\r\nnot able to satisfy either the educational or property tests may,\r\nnevertheless, continue to be a voter for life if he was a voter in 1867\r\nor is an old soldier or the lineal descendant of such voter or soldier,\r\nprovided he registers prior to a fixed date. Alabama permits all who\r\nserved honorably in the forces of the United States in the War of 1812,\r\nthe War with Mexico, any war with Indians, the War between the States,\r\nthe War with Spain, or in the forces of the Confederate States or of the\r\nState during the War between the States and the lawful descendants of\r\nthose and all who are of good character and who understand the duties\r\nand obligations of citizens under a republican form of government, to\r\nregister before December 20, 1902. The clause in the Georgia\r\nConstitution is like that of Alabama, except that the privilege is\r\nextended to veterans of the Revolutionary War and their descendants, and\r\nthe character and understanding clause is permanent. To take advantage\r\nof the “Grandfather Clause” in Georgia one must register before January\r\n1, 1915. Louisiana provided that one entitled to vote in any State\r\nJanuary 1, 1867, son or grandson of such a one twenty-one years old or\r\nover in 1898, or a foreigner naturalized before January 1, 1898, who had\r\nresided in the State five years preceding his application for\r\nregistration, might register before September 1, 1898. North Carolina\r\nallowed one who had the right to vote on January 1, 1867, and the lineal\r\ndescendant of such a one to be registered prior to December 1, 1908.\r\nBefore January 1, 1898, one could register in South Carolina who could\r\nread the Constitution of the State or understand and explain it. In\r\nVirginia one might register up to 1904 who, before 1902, served in the\r\narmy or navy of the United States or of the Confederate States or of\r\nVirginia or who was the son of such a one, or who owned property on\r\nwhich the State tax was one dollar, or who was able to read and explain\r\nor to understand and explain the Constitution of the State. Mississippi\r\nhas no “Grandfather Clause.”\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia, the fact that one was a soldier\r\nenabled him to register under the “Grandfather Clause”; in Louisiana and\r\nNorth Carolina, that he was a voter in 1867. In each State the lineal\r\ndescendants of such soldiers or voters in 1867 might register under the\r\n“Grandfather Clause.” In Alabama one might register, though he was not\r\nan old soldier or descendant of one, if he understood the duties and\r\nobligations of citizenship and was of good character. In Virginia and\r\nSouth Carolina, one could register under the “Grandfather Clause” if he\r\ncould understand and explain the Constitution when read to him; and, in\r\nVirginia, if he owned property taxed as much as one dollar a year.\r\n\r\nThe “Grandfather Clauses” are all temporary. Those classes of men\r\ncovered by the clauses are given a certain time within which to have\r\ntheir names entered on a permanent registry. If they are once entered on\r\nthe permanent register, they are voters for life unless excluded because\r\nof some crime or because they become public charges. If they fail,\r\nhowever, to register within the limited time, and still wish to become\r\nelectors, they must satisfy the same tests as other applicants for\r\nregistration. For instance, one who could vote in North Carolina in 1867\r\nmight have his name entered on the permanent register prior to December\r\n1, 1908, and thereby become a voter for life, though he had neither\r\nproperty nor literacy; if he failed to register by that date, he had to\r\nsatisfy the educational test as any other applicant would have to do.\r\nThe length of duration of the “Grandfather Clauses” varies from a few\r\nmonths to several years. Thus, the “Grandfather Clause” of South\r\nCarolina was of avail from 1895 to 1898; of Louisiana, from May 16,\r\n1898, to September 1, 1898; of North Carolina, from July 1, 1900, to\r\nDecember 1, 1908; of Alabama, from 1901 to 1903; Virginia, from 1902 to\r\n1904; and in Georgia, it extends from 1908 to 1915. It will be seen that\r\nGeorgia is the only State in which the “Grandfather Clause” is still in\r\nforce. All who registered within the dates given above are still\r\nelectors and will continue to be as long as they live unless excluded\r\nfrom the suffrage because of crime or the like; those who have not\r\nregistered under the “Grandfather Clauses” cannot do so now, except in\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe “Grandfather Clauses” are more nearly race distinctions than any\r\nother sections of the suffrage laws for the reason that so many white\r\nmen in the Southern States and so few Negroes are either old soldiers or\r\ndescendants of old soldiers or had the right to vote in 1867. Yet they\r\nare not, technically speaking, race distinctions because, if one was a\r\nveteran or son of one, he might register regardless of his race or\r\ncolor. As a matter of fact, a considerable number of Negroes in the\r\nSouthern States, who were Federal soldiers in the Civil War, have\r\nregistered under the “Grandfather Clauses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                “_Understanding and Character Clauses_”\r\n\r\nThe “Understanding Clauses” do not have as large a place in the suffrage\r\nlaws of the Southern States as is commonly believed. In only two\r\nStates—Georgia and Mississippi—is the “Understanding Clause” permanent.\r\nIn Georgia, one may register if he is of good character and understands\r\nthe duties and obligations of citizens under a republican form of\r\ngovernment, although he has neither education nor property. In\r\nMississippi, one who cannot read may register if he can understand and\r\nreasonably interpret the Constitution when read to him. A distinction\r\nmust be made between these two “Understanding Clauses.” In Georgia the\r\nrequirement is the understanding of the duties of citizens of a\r\nrepublican form of government; in Mississippi it is understanding the\r\nState Constitution when read. In three other States—Alabama, South\r\nCarolina, and Virginia—the “Understanding Clause” of the Mississippi\r\ntype is part of the “Grandfather” section, and became inoperative with\r\nthe “Grandfather Clauses.” The Georgia provision which allows one to\r\nregister, regardless of education or property, if he is of good moral\r\ncharacter has a prototype in the Constitution of Connecticut which\r\nrequires all electors to be of good moral character, and the\r\nConstitution of Vermont which requires the electors to be of quiet and\r\npeaceable behavior.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the permanent “Understanding Clauses” of\r\nMississippi and Georgia lend themselves to race discrimination. The\r\nConstitution of Mississippi provides that the applicant for registration\r\nmust be able either to read or understand and reasonably interpret the\r\nConstitution. The registrar who so desires may easily disqualify members\r\nof one race by asking them to explain more difficult passages of the\r\nConstitution or by requiring of them a more scholarly interpretation of\r\nsuch passages than he demands of members of the other race whom he\r\ndesires to have qualify as electors. In Georgia the registrar who passes\r\nupon an applicant’s understanding of the duties and obligations of\r\ncitizens under a republican form of government may set a higher standard\r\nfor one race than for the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Persons Excluded from Suffrage_\r\n\r\nCertain classes of persons are excluded from the franchise because they\r\nare considered incapable or unfit to take a hand in governmental\r\nmatters. The classes excluded are practically the same in all the\r\nStates, and there is slight evidence of any race distinction in such\r\ncases. The following States do not allow paupers to vote: Delaware,\r\nMaine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South\r\nCarolina, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Other States, including\r\nLouisiana, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, exclude the\r\ninmates of public institutions of charity, Louisiana and Oklahoma making\r\nan exception of Soldiers’ Homes. Practically all the States exclude\r\nidiots and insane persons from the suffrage. Other classes, though not\r\nexcluded from the suffrage, are not allowed to get the required\r\nresidence to become electors. Thus, in a number of States, students in\r\nschools, unless self-supporting, do not get the required residence by\r\nliving at the school. In a great majority of the States, soldiers and\r\nsailors in service do not gain an electoral residence in a State,\r\ncounty, or precinct by being stationed therein. California, Idaho,\r\nNevada, and Oregon exclude all but American-born Chinese. Where the\r\nChinese, because of the Federal naturalization laws, are incapable of\r\nbecoming citizens, they cannot be electors, because all the States\r\nrequire the electors to be either citizens or persons who have formally\r\ndeclared their intention to become citizens. Idaho, Maine, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Washington, and\r\nWisconsin exclude tribal Indians, or, what is perhaps the same, Indians\r\nnot taxed.\r\n\r\nAll States exclude from the suffrage those who have been convicted of\r\ncertain crimes; that is, those who may have served out their terms of\r\nimprisonment, but who have not been restored to their civil rights by\r\nthe executive department of the State. Treason and felonies like\r\nembezzlement and bribery are the crimes most frequently mentioned. One\r\nfinds here a possible race distinction. The Southern States have greatly\r\nadded to the list of crimes which operate as an exclusion from the\r\nsuffrage. By the Constitution of Alabama of 1875, for instance, the\r\nfollowing were excluded from suffrage: Those convicted of treason,\r\nembezzlement of public funds, malfeasance in office, larceny, bribery,\r\nor any other crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary. The\r\nlast Constitution of Alabama is more specific; it mentions the following\r\ncrimes as having the effect of excluding from the suffrage those\r\nconvicted of them: Treason, murder, arson, embezzlement, malfeasance in\r\noffice, larceny, receiving stolen property, obtaining property or money\r\nunder false pretenses, perjury, subornation of perjury, robbery, assault\r\nwith intent to rob, burglary, forgery, bribery, assault and battery on\r\nwife, bigamy, living in adultery, sodomy, incest, rape, miscegenation,\r\ncrime against nature, or any crime punishable by imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary, or of any infamous crime or crimes involving moral\r\nturpitude; also any person who shall be convicted as a vagrant or tramp,\r\nor of selling or offering to sell his vote or the vote of another, or of\r\nmaking or offering to make false return in any election by the people or\r\nin any primary election to procure the nomination or election of any\r\nperson to any office, or of suborning any witness or registrar to secure\r\nthe registration of any person as an elector. Delaware and several other\r\nStates, on the other hand, exclude only those who have been convicted of\r\na felony. If, as the Supreme Court of Mississippi said, the Negro is\r\nmore given to furtive offences than to the robust crimes of the whites,\r\nthe exclusions of the Alabama law would seem to be directed toward these\r\noffences. If more Negroes than whites are guilty of such crimes as\r\nlarceny and wife-beating, and of sexual irregularities, then the law\r\noperates to disqualify for the suffrage more Negroes than whites.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SUFFRAGE IN INSULAR POSSESSIONS OF UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nThe suffrage qualifications in the insular possessions of the United\r\nStates are particularly significant in that they tend to show the\r\npresent attitude of Congress toward the elective franchise. The Act of\r\nApril 30, 1900, providing a government for the Territory of Hawaii,\r\nrestricts suffrage to those who can speak, read, and write the English\r\nor Hawaiian language—a strict educational test. In the Philippines to be\r\nan elector one must be a native of the Philippines, twenty-three years\r\nof age or over, and must have paid an annual tax of fifteen dollars, or\r\nbe the owner of property assessed at two hundred and fifty dollars, or\r\nbe able to speak, read, and write English or Spanish, or have held\r\nsubstantial office under the Spanish régime. It will be noticed that the\r\ntax payment, educational, property, and office-holding tests are\r\nalternatives, so the satisfaction of any one of the four is sufficient.\r\nManhood suffrage, as provided by the “Foraker Act”[723] of 1900, is\r\nstill in force in Porto Rico. But this seems destined soon to give way\r\nto a restricted suffrage. Secretary of War Dickinson has recently issued\r\na report on the conditions in Porto Rico in which he suggests an\r\namendment of the suffrage laws to the effect that, after the general\r\nelection of 1910, the qualified voters for any election shall consist\r\nonly of citizens of the United States, who, with such other\r\nqualifications as are required by the laws of Porto Rico, “are able to\r\nread and write; or on the day of registration shall own taxable real\r\nestate in their own right and name; or who are on said day _bona fide_\r\nmembers of a firm or corporation which shall own taxable real estate in\r\nthe name of such firm or corporation; or on the day of registration\r\nshall possess and produce to the Board of Registration tax receipts\r\nshowing the payment of any kind of taxes for the last six months of the\r\nyear in which the election is held.” President Taft, in transmitting the\r\nreport to Congress, indorsed Secretary Dickinson’s suggestions,\r\nsaying[723]: “It is much better in the interests of the people of the\r\nisland that the suffrage should be limited by an educational and\r\nproperty qualification.” The above suffrage qualifications for the\r\ninsular possessions of the United States is evidence that the attitude\r\nof Congress toward universal suffrage has been considerably modified\r\nwithin recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SUFFRAGE AMENDMENTS\r\n\r\nThe first “Suffrage Amendment” of the Southern States, that of\r\nMississippi, was adopted twenty years ago, and yet no case involving the\r\nconstitutionality of these laws has been squarely presented to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States. The one most nearly in point was\r\nWilliams v. Mississippi[724] in 1898. Williams, a Negro, had been\r\nindicted by a jury composed wholly of white men. The law required that a\r\njuror should be an elector. Williams contended that the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution about suffrage were a scheme to discriminate against\r\nNegroes, that the discrimination was effected, not by the wording of the\r\nlaw, but by the powers vested in the administrative officers. The United\r\nStates Supreme Court refused to interfere, saying that the laws did not,\r\non their face, discriminate against the races, and that it “had not been\r\nshown that their actual administration was evil, only that evil was\r\npossible under them.”\r\n\r\nSeveral suits[725] have been brought, the purpose of which has been to\r\ntest the constitutionality of these laws, but they have all been decided\r\non points of procedure or on technical grounds.\r\n\r\nAt present, the suffrage laws of the Southern States stand judicially\r\nunimpugned in the light of the Fifteenth Amendment. Mr. John Mabry\r\nMathews[726] says that the Supreme Court has shown an “apparent desire\r\nto shift the duty of redressing such wrongs [those arising under the\r\nsuffrage laws] upon the political department of the Government. So far\r\nas Congress has given any indication of its attitude upon the subject,\r\nit has intimated that the matter is one for judicial settlement. But the\r\nabsence of congressional legislation would in any case hamper the\r\nefficiency of the courts in securing the practical enforcement of the\r\nAmendment. The real reason behind the attitude of both Congress and the\r\ncourts is the apathetic tone of public opinion, which is the final\r\narbiter of the question. In the technical sense, the Amendment is still\r\na part of the supreme law of the land. But as a phenomenon of the social\r\nconsciousness, a rule of conduct, no matter how authoritatively\r\npromulgated by the nation, if not supported by the force of public\r\nopinion, is already in process of repeal.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot be safely conjectured what the Supreme Court will say when it\r\nsquarely faces the suffrage laws of the South in their relation to the\r\nFifteenth Amendment. Until then, each is entitled to his opinion. That\r\nthe citizenship, age, sex, and residence qualifications are in perfect\r\nconformity to the Amendment there is no doubt. The qualifications of tax\r\npayment, property, and education existed long before the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment in the States of the men most active in securing the adoption\r\nof that Amendment. It is hardly to be supposed that the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania understood the\r\nAmendment they were advocating to be nullifying the suffrage laws of\r\ntheir respective States. Moreover, a property or educational test is not\r\nan abridgment or denial of the right to vote, because it lies within the\r\npower of everyone, regardless of race, to accumulate property and\r\nacquire literacy.\r\n\r\nThe “Grandfather Clauses” are the most doubtful parts of the suffrage\r\nlaws. In one sense, they are not at all a denial or an abridgment of the\r\nright to vote. Granting that the property and educational tests are\r\nconstitutional, the “Grandfather Clause,” instead of abridging or\r\ndenying, enlarges the right to vote by giving the suffrage to those who\r\nwould be disqualified under the property or educational tests. Be that\r\nas it may, the Southern States are more uneasy about the\r\nconstitutionality of these provisions than of any others. For instance,\r\nat the last two sessions of the legislature of North Carolina bills were\r\nintroduced to extend the “Grandfather Clause” of that State to 1812 and\r\n1816 respectively. In each case the bill was defeated, the argument\r\nagainst it being that it was unwise to open up the suffrage question\r\nagain, lest the amendment be brought into court.[727]\r\n\r\nA leading thinker on constitutional law has given the unpublished\r\nopinion that the “Grandfather Clauses” are in violation of the tenth\r\nsection of the first article of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwhich says that no State shall grant any title of nobility. His idea is\r\nthat an order of nobility is created whenever a class of persons is\r\ngranted exceptional political privileges, that the old soldiers and\r\nlineal descendants constitute such a class, and that the title of\r\nnobility is “Elector,” whether expressed or not.\r\n\r\nIf the “Grandfather Clause” should be declared unconstitutional on the\r\nground just suggested or on any other ground, the next question would be\r\nwhether that would nullify the other sections of the suffrage laws, such\r\nas the educational and property tests. This depends upon whether the\r\ndifferent sections of the laws are separable, whether the legislature or\r\nthe people would have adopted the educational and property tests, etc.,\r\nif they had thought the “Grandfather Clause” unenforceable.[728] North\r\nCarolina prepared for just such a contingency by inserting the following\r\nsection in its Suffrage Amendment: “That this amendment to the\r\nConstitution is presented and adopted as one indivisible plan for the\r\nregulation of the suffrage, with the intent and purpose to so connect\r\nthe different parts, and to make them so dependent upon each other that\r\nthe whole shall stand or fall together.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MARYLAND AND FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT\r\n\r\nIn the preceding section it has been assumed that the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment is an integral part of the Constitution of the United States.\r\nWhether or not this assumption is warranted is brought into question by\r\na recent action of the legislature of Maryland.\r\n\r\nAs has been said earlier in this chapter, Maryland has made two\r\nunsuccessful attempts to amend its suffrage laws in such a way as would\r\ndisfranchise a large number of the present Negro voters in that State.\r\nThe letter of the Constitution of Maryland at present restricts suffrage\r\nto _white_ male citizens; but it has been taken for granted that the\r\nword “white” became inoperative under the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nOut of the discussion of Negro suffrage in Maryland has arisen the\r\nquestion whether or not the Fifteenth Amendment itself is valid. At the\r\nlast session of the legislature of that State, that of 1910, the\r\nso-called Digges Bills were introduced and passed by both houses. The\r\npurpose of these bills was to disfranchise all Negroes who have not\r\nowned five hundred dollars’ worth of property for two years before their\r\napplication for registration, upon which all taxes have been paid during\r\nthose two years. This disfranchisement applied only to State and\r\nmunicipal elections. The bills failed to become laws only because they\r\nwere vetoed by the Governor of the State.\r\n\r\nUpon the failure of the Digges Bills to be passed, a constitutional\r\namendment[729] was drafted and approved by the required three-fifths of\r\nall the members of both houses of the legislature, which embodied the\r\nsame features as the Digges Bills. This amendment is to be voted upon by\r\nthe people at the general election in November, 1911. This amendment\r\nprovides for the Australian ballot and for uniform election laws\r\nthroughout the State. In the event of the amendment being declared\r\nunconstitutional, the laws now in force in Maryland are to be revived\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the proposed Maryland amendment is directly dependent\r\nupon the invalidity of the Fifteenth Amendment. Under the proposed\r\namendment, no property qualification whatever is required of _white_\r\nmale citizens applying for registration, while a heavy property\r\nqualification is required of _every other_ male citizen—and this must\r\ninclude Negroes—applying for registration. Thus, in violation of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment, the right of citizens of the United States to vote\r\nwould be denied or abridged by the State of Maryland on account of race\r\nor color.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the Fifteenth Amendment is questioned on the following\r\ngrounds, among others: (1) The fifth article of the Federal Constitution\r\nprovides that Congress, “whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem\r\nit necessary,” shall propose amendments to the Constitution. It is\r\nclaimed that only thirty-nine of the sixty-six members of the Senate,\r\nless than two-thirds, voted to submit the Fifteenth Amendment to the\r\nStates for their ratification. (2) Maryland was one of the two\r\nStates—the other being Delaware—that refused to ratify either the\r\nThirteenth, Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment. It is claimed, therefore,\r\nthat Maryland is not bound by the Fifteenth Amendment, which it did not\r\nratify. (3) The fifth article of the Constitution, after providing the\r\ntwo ways in which the Constitution may be amended, adds that “no State,\r\nwithout its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the\r\nSenate.” Upon this last clause, Mr. Arthur W. Machen, Jr., in a recent\r\narticle in _The Harvard Law Review_,[730] has founded an ingenious\r\nargument that the Fifteenth Amendment is void. His reasoning on this\r\npoint is, in brief, that the State meant here is the citizens or voters\r\nor the government of the State, and not the territory. By the\r\nenfranchisement of the Negroes after the War, the composition of the\r\nState was changed, a body of persons became part of the State who were\r\nnot a part of it before, and thus the State was deprived of its equal\r\nsuffrage in the Senate. Mr. Machen says: “The Fifteenth Amendment\r\namounts to a compulsory annexation to each State that refused to ratify\r\nit of a black San Domingo within its borders. It is no less\r\nobjectionable than the annexation of the San Domingo in the Spanish\r\nmain.”\r\n\r\nWhether or not any or all of the above objections and the others that\r\nare urged against the Fifteenth Amendment are valid cannot now be\r\nanswered, because the validity of the Amendment has been assumed by the\r\ncourts rather than decided upon after argument. Until after the election\r\nof November, 1911, attention will be centered upon Maryland. If the\r\nproposed amendment to the State Constitution is ratified by the people,\r\nthen haste will no doubt be made to have its constitutionality tested,\r\nin which case the validity of the Fifteenth Amendment will be directly\r\nraised. The Southern States, as a rule, deplore this action on the part\r\nof Maryland because they fear that it will open up the whole suffrage\r\nquestion. It is deplored by people over the country as a whole because\r\nthey fear that it will revive the ill feeling among the sections\r\noccasioned by Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   EXTENT OF ACTUAL DISFRANCHISEMENT\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say how many persons have been disfranchised under\r\nthe suffrage laws. No doubt many who are capable of satisfying the\r\nqualifications do not register, or, if they register, do not vote. This\r\nis probably due to the one-party system in the South. The following\r\nfigures show either the extent of actual disfranchisement or the\r\npolitical apathy in the Southern States: In one county in Mississippi,\r\nwith a population of about 8,000 whites and 11,700 Negroes in 1900,\r\nthere were only twenty-five or thirty qualified Negro voters in 1908,\r\nthe rest being disqualified, it is said, on the educational test. In\r\nanother county, with 30,000 Negroes, only about 175 were registered\r\nvoters. In still another county of Mississippi, with 8,000 whites and\r\n12,000 Negroes, only 400 white men and about 30 Negroes are qualified\r\nelectors. The clerk of court of a county in North Carolina, with a\r\npopulation of 5,700 whites and 6,700 Negroes, writes that a Negro has\r\nnever voted in the County. As a general rule, taking the country at\r\nlarge, about one person in five is a male of voting age. In Iowa four\r\nout of five possible voters have actually voted in the last four\r\nelections; in Georgia, a State of nearly the same population, the\r\nproportion is one to six. In Mississippi, in 1906, only one out of\r\neighteen males of voting age actually voted; in Georgia, one out of\r\nfifteen. In a district in Mississippi with a population of 190,885,\r\n2,091 votes were cast for the Representative, John Sharp Williams, in\r\n1906; in a district in Connecticut with a population of 247,875, 46,425\r\nvotes were cast for Representative Litchfield. These figures show that\r\nthe ratio of actual voters to total population in the Southern States is\r\nastoundingly smaller than in other States.[731]\r\n\r\n\r\n            QUALIFICATIONS FOR VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n ──────────────────┬────────────┬────┬───────┬───────────────────────────────\r\n      STATE OR     │Citizenship.│Age.│ Sex.  │    PREVIOUS RESIDENCE IN—\r\n     TERRITORY.    │            │    │       │\r\n ──────────────────┼────────────┼────┼───────┼──────┬──────────────┬─────────\r\n                   │            │    │       │State.│   County.    │Precinct.\r\n ──────────────────┼────────────┼────┼───────┼──────┼──────────────┼─────────\r\n Alabama[714]      │Citizen of  │21  │Male.  │2 yrs.│1 yr.         │3 mo.\r\n                   │U.

661:\r\n\r\n  The following table, giving the dates of the Constitutions of the\r\n  various States and the Organic Laws of the Territories with the\r\n  sections referring to suffrage, up to and including 1865, indicates\r\n  the extent to which suffrage was restricted to white people before and\r\n  at that date. “White,” “white freeman,” “free white,” etc., mean that\r\n  only white persons or white freemen or free white persons had the\r\n  elective franchise. Where the suffrage is given to male “citizens” or\r\n  “inhabitants” whether Negroes were included depends upon whether they\r\n  were treated in those States as “citizens” or “inhabitants.”\r\n\r\n Alabama,       Const.,  1819,   art.

Now, however, that the various race\r\ndistinctions have been reviewed at some length, it may be worth while to\r\nconsider what conclusions the facts warrant and what practical lessons\r\nthey suggest.\r\n\r\n\r\n             RACE DISTINCTIONS NOT CONFINED TO ONE SECTION\r\n\r\nRace distinctions are not confined to any one section of the country.\r\nThis conclusion is the most patent of all. There is scarcely a State or\r\nTerritory in the Union where legislative or judicial records do not\r\nreveal the actual existence of at least some race distinctions. Of the\r\ntwenty-six States and Territories that prohibit intermarriage, more than\r\nhalf, extending from Delaware to Oregon, are outside the South. Negroes\r\nhave, on account of their race, been excluded, usually contrary to the\r\nlocal laws, from hotels in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New\r\nYork, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Iowa; from barber-shops, in\r\nNebraska and Connecticut; from bootblack stands, in New York; from\r\nbilliard-rooms, in Massachusetts; from saloons, in Minnesota and Ohio;\r\nfrom soda fountains, in Illinois; from theatres, in Illinois and New\r\nYork; from skating rinks in New York and Iowa; and the bodies of Negroes\r\nhave been refused burial with those of white persons in Pennsylvania. It\r\nis not meant here that Negroes are always excluded from such places in\r\nthese States, but that instances of such exclusions are found in the\r\nlaws. Most of the States have at one time or another made distinctions\r\nbetween the races in schools. California and other States of the Far\r\nWest are demanding separate schools for Japanese. Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, and Iowa, besides other States of the Middle West, clash from\r\ntime to time with their school boards for attempting to separate the\r\nraces in schools. Delaware is diligent in providing separate schools for\r\nwhite persons and Negroes. In Massachusetts, until 1857, the school\r\nboard of Boston provided a separate school for Negroes in that city. As\r\nto public conveyances, the term “Jim Crow,” applied to a car set apart\r\nfor Negroes, was first used in Massachusetts, and it was in Pennsylvania\r\nthat the first leading case involving the right of street car companies\r\nto separate their passengers by race arose. Instances of actual\r\ndiscrimination against Negroes by common carriers were found in\r\nIllinois, Iowa, and California. How common race distinctions are in the\r\nStates mentioned the above resumé does not clearly show, because the\r\ngreat majority of grievances caused by race distinctions do not reach\r\nthe court. But when one finds that the legislature has deemed it\r\nadvisable to enact a law against race distinctions, it is reasonable to\r\nassume that they did in fact exist. For instance, five States, all\r\noutside the South, prohibit discriminations by insurance companies on\r\naccount of race. Had these companies not evinced signs of discrimination\r\nagainst Negroes, such statutes would not have been enacted. It is well\r\nknown that race distinctions are common in the South.\r\n\r\nWere this general prevalence of race distinctions fully realized, the\r\nresult would be a kindlier feeling one to another among the white people\r\nof the various sections. They would then see that the presence or\r\nabsence of race distinctions is due, not to any inherent difference in\r\nthe character of the people, but to diverse conditions and environment.\r\nWhen, therefore, the Negro children of Upper Alton, Illinois, are seen\r\nto constitute an appreciable percentage of the school population, the\r\npeople of that town, as the people of a Southern town would do under\r\nsimilar circumstances, demand for them a separate school.\r\n\r\n\r\n               RACE DISTINCTIONS NOT CONFINED TO ONE RACE\r\n\r\nRace distinctions are not confined to any one race. It is true that most\r\nof the statutes and judicial decisions above referred to relate to the\r\nNegro because he belongs to a race which is the largest non-Caucasian\r\nelement in the United States. Where, however, other race elements exist\r\nin considerable numbers, similar distinctions are sanctioned. One finds,\r\nfor instance, in California and other States of the Far West, where\r\nJapanese are numerous, laws prohibiting intermarriage between Mongolians\r\nand Caucasians, and requiring separate schools for the two races.\r\nSimilar laws have been enacted wherever there is an appreciable number\r\nof Indians. Wherever, in other words, any two races have lived together\r\nin this country in anything like equal numbers, race distinctions have\r\nbeen recognized in the law sooner or later; and, before becoming legally\r\nrecognized, have existed in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    RACE DISTINCTIONS NOT DECREASING\r\n\r\nRace distinctions do not appear to be decreasing. On the contrary,\r\ndistinctions heretofore existing only in custom tend to crystallize into\r\nlaw. As a matter of fact, most of the distinctions which are described\r\nabove as the “Black Laws of 1865–68” are no longer in force. No State\r\nnow carries statutes prescribing the hour when a Negro laborer must\r\narise, requiring his contracts to be in writing, prohibiting him from\r\nleaving the plantation or receiving visitors without his employer’s\r\nconsent, or exacting a license fee of him before he can engage in\r\ncertain trades. These laws were vestiges of the slave system and\r\nsurvived but a short time after that system had been abolished.\r\nLikewise, those statutes which prohibited Negroes from testifying in\r\ncourt against white persons were repealed during the first few years\r\nafter Emancipation. But distinctions which are not the direct results of\r\nslavery have found an increasing recognition in the law. Thus, though\r\nFlorida, Mississippi, and Texas had separate railroad coaches for\r\nfreedmen in 1866, the regular “Jim Crow” laws did not begin to creep\r\ninto the statutes of the Southern States till 1881. Now every Southern\r\nState, except Missouri, has a law separating the races in railroad cars.\r\nMississippi, in 1888, was the first State to require separate\r\nwaiting-rooms. Louisiana, in 1902, took the lead in compelling separate\r\nstreet car accommodations, being followed by most of the Southern States\r\nwithin the last seven years.\r\n\r\nA similar tendency toward crystallization of race distinctions into law\r\nis found in schools. Though Massachusetts permitted separate schools as\r\nearly as 1800, and though the Southern States required them from the\r\nbeginning of their public school system, it is only recently that any\r\nStates have seen fit to create distinctions in private schools by\r\nlegislation. At present, Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Tennessee\r\nprohibit the teaching of white and Negro students in the same private\r\nschools, and their action in so doing the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates in the Berea College case has decided to be constitutional.\r\nMoreover, the Japanese school question of the West has become of\r\nnational concern only within the last two years.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of suffrage also one observes the same general trend of\r\npractices slowly passing into statutes. Between 1877 and 1890 Negroes in\r\nthe South were disfranchised to a great extent in defiance of law.\r\nBeginning with Mississippi in 1890 and ending with Georgia in 1908,\r\nseven Southern States have made constitutional provisions which, though\r\nnot in letter creating race distinctions, lend themselves to race\r\ndiscriminations.\r\n\r\nThat actual race distinctions still persist outside the South is shown\r\nby recent decisions. For instance, within a year, the Appellate Division\r\nof the Supreme Court of New York, in reducing damages awarded in the\r\ncourt below to a Negro porter for false imprisonment, held that by\r\nreason of his race, he did not suffer as much damage as would a white\r\nman under like circumstances. The New York _Times_ of November 19, 1909,\r\nrefers to a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Iowa as holding that\r\na coffee company licensed under the State laws, being a private concern,\r\nhas the right to refuse to serve a Negro.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as a whole, actual race distinctions in the United States are\r\nnot increasing; but distinctions, formerly sanctioned only by custom,\r\nare now either permitted or required by law, and the number of recent\r\nsuits in States outside the South indicates that actual discriminations\r\nare as prevalent as they have been at any time since 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n               DISTINCTIONS NOT BASED ON RACE SUPERIORITY\r\n\r\nWhat is the fundamental cause of race distinctions? No comparison of\r\nlaws can formulate an answer to that question; but the personal\r\nobservation of the writer leads to the belief that race distinctions are\r\nnot based fundamentally upon the feeling by one race of superiority to\r\nthe other, but are rather the outgrowth of race consciousness. If\r\nNegroes were in every way equally advanced with white people, race\r\ndistinctions would probably be even more pronounced than now; because,\r\nin addition to physical differentiation, there would be the rivalry of\r\nequally matched races. Thus, the widespread prejudice entertained by\r\nGentiles toward Jews, resulting in actual, if not legal, distinctions,\r\nis due, not to any notion that Jews are intellectually or morally\r\ninferior to any people, but to a race consciousness which each\r\npossesses. The exclusion of the Japanese was due, not so much to an\r\nintellectual or moral inferiority of that race to the white race, as to\r\na difference in their racial ideals. So long as two races living side by\r\nside have each an _amour propre_, the more numerous may be expected to\r\nprescribe distinctions to which the less numerous must submit; that is,\r\nuntil the spirit of universal brotherhood is a more compelling force\r\nthan it is at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n SOLUTION OF RACE PROBLEM HINDERED BY MULTIPLICITY OF PROPOSED REMEDIES\r\n\r\nIf the above generalizations are correct, they should enable one to draw\r\nsome practical conclusions for dealing with race problems. The proper\r\nadjustment of race relations is being retarded by the multiplicity of\r\nsuggested solutions, many of them conflicting and thus hindering one\r\nanother, some of them parallel and necessarily duplicating expenditure\r\nof energy. For instance, some men, including both Negroes and white\r\npersons, believe that the proper solution of the race problem is the\r\ndeportation of the Negro race; others, that it is the segregation of\r\nthat race in some portion of the United States or colonization in some\r\nterritorial possession; while others believe that the South should\r\nremain the permanent home of the majority of Negroes. Advocates of\r\nterritorial separation of one sort or another think that efforts should\r\nbe directed toward getting the Negro to his new home as soon as\r\npossible. Those who believe that the home of the Negro will remain in\r\nthis country are divided upon the steps to be taken. Some of this class\r\napprove of further education of the Negro, being divided, however, into\r\ntwo overlapping groups, the one emphasizing literary training, and the\r\nother industrial. Others of this class maintain that any sort of\r\nsystematic education of the Negro is only hastening an inevitable race\r\nconflict. In the midst of these conflicting opinions, the Negro problem,\r\ninstead of reaching a complete or even partial solution, is only being\r\naggravated.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of prophesying what the final solution will be, but one\r\nis justified in believing that the inevitable changes will be gradual.\r\nWhether or not the final adjustment is a segregation of the Negro race,\r\none can hardly expect it to come in one, two, or even six decades. A\r\ncentury hence the white people will probably be living side by side with\r\nNegroes as they do now. The duty of the American people is to act\r\nproperly toward all races in their own lifetime: the far future will\r\ntake care of itself. The difficult thing to ascertain is the proper mode\r\nof acting to-day. The solution of the race problem, when it does come,\r\nwill doubtless be a composite result. The race relations are not the\r\nsame in different sections of the country or in different States of the\r\nSouth or even in different counties of the same State. Though the proper\r\nsteps now to be taken in the various sections or States or counties may\r\nbe different, there can, in the nature of things, be but one best mode\r\nof action for each community. That must be one for which all people,\r\nregardless of race or section, may profitably strive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SEARCH FOR A COMMON PLATFORM\r\n\r\nA noticeable effort has been made during the past few years by students\r\nof race relations to construct a platform upon which all men of every\r\nrace may stand and work together for the permanent settlement of all\r\nracial antagonisms. This is evidenced by the organization of late years\r\nof national movements which have enlisted the support of men of\r\ndifferent sections and races. One of these, the Southern Education\r\nAssociation, has been promoted by men from the North and East as well as\r\nby men from the South, by both Negroes and white people. Soon after the\r\nAtlanta riots of two years ago, a conference of Southern white men and\r\nNegroes was held at Atlanta, for the purpose of promoting harmony\r\nbetween the races in the South. Within a few months a conference of\r\nNorthern and Southern white men has met in Washington City to consider\r\nthe Negro problem. Still more recently a group of Southern students in\r\nHarvard University, realizing that the race relations were different in\r\ndifferent localities of the South, have organized an informal club to\r\nstudy the practical problems arising out of the presence of the Negro in\r\nthe South and to exchange ideas formed from observation and experience\r\nin their respective localities. There are other indications of a desire\r\nto work out a common set of principles by which everyone may be\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PROPER PLACE OF RACE DISTINCTIONS\r\n\r\nAssuming that it is possible to formulate a platform deserving the\r\napproval of all races, it is appropriate for a student of any phase of\r\nrace relations to suggest a plank for it. A student in the special field\r\nof race distinctions in American law may endeavor to show the place that\r\nsuch legal distinctions properly hold, bearing in mind all the while\r\nthat the whole issue springs out of race consciousness as it actually\r\nexists to-day, not as it should be or as it may be in the distant\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nLet one imagine the existence of a Federal statute—waiving the question\r\nof its constitutionality—prohibiting States from legalizing race\r\ndistinctions, so that all public places of amusement, accommodation, and\r\ninstruction would be, so far as the law could make them, open to all\r\npersons, regardless of race. Such a measure, far from effecting its\r\npurpose, would doubtless be the beginning of extensive race\r\ndiscriminations. Once abolish separate hotel accommodations and the\r\nwhite race, wherever it is in the majority, would monopolize every\r\nhotel, leaving other races either to walk the streets or to find\r\naccommodations in private houses. Were separate street car\r\naccommodations forbidden in cities where there is a fairly large\r\npercentage of Negroes, if any passenger were forced to stand or be\r\ncrowded off the car altogether, it would be the Negro. Were separate\r\nschools not permitted, Negro children might possibly be excluded from\r\nschools altogether in defiance of the law; but even if admitted, their\r\ninterests, if different from those of the more numerous race, would have\r\nto be sacrificed. A further review of race distinctions now legally\r\nrecognized would only more fully substantiate the conclusion that, with\r\nrace feeling as it is, if such distinctions were not recognized and\r\nenforced, the stronger race would naturally appropriate the best for\r\nitself and leave the weaker race to fare as it could.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let one imagine that the same laws recognizing race\r\ndistinctions as now exist in the South obtained in all communities where\r\ntwo races are nearly equal in numbers. Suppose, for instance, that\r\nseparate hotels were permitted in all cities which receive an\r\nappreciable number of Negro travelers. Respectable Negroes might then\r\nsecure comfortable entertainment in hotels provided for their race and\r\nthus escape the inconvenience and humiliation of being denied admission\r\nto hotels maintained exclusively for white persons. If separate schools\r\nwere provided, Negro children would be free to pursue, unhampered by\r\nrequirements prescribed for the more developed race and unembittered by\r\ncontinuous manifestations of race prejudice, a curriculum especially\r\nadapted to their own needs. Wherever separate railroad and street car\r\naccommodations were provided, a Negro might enter the car or compartment\r\nreserved for his race and go his way in peace, unmolested by the\r\nthoughtless or vicious of the other race. The result, therefore, of the\r\nhonest enforcement of race distinctions would be to the advantage of the\r\nweaker race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  OBLITERATION OF RACE DISCRIMINATIONS\r\n\r\nThe people of the different sections and races, instead of inquiring\r\ninto the truth or falsity of such a conclusion, have been agitating the\r\ntheoretical right and wrong of race distinctions. Meanwhile, indications\r\nare that legalized race distinctions have been unfairly enforced. For\r\ninstance, statutes require that equal accommodations be given Negro\r\npassengers in public conveyances; yet, while people have been debating\r\nthe constitutionality and justification of the “Jim Crow” laws, railroad\r\ncompanies have been compelling Negroes to occupy uncomfortable and\r\nunsanitary coaches and waiting-rooms, and this though Negroes paid the\r\nsame fare as white passengers. Furthermore, while they have been arguing\r\nthe constitutionality of the suffrage laws of the South, white\r\nregistrars have been putting unfair tests to Negro applicants for\r\nregistration, and by so doing have made the laws a tool by which to work\r\ninjustice to the Negro. While, finally, they have been strenuously\r\ndiscussing the school laws, Negro children have been suffering from, not\r\nonly inadequate but, in many cases, improper training by ignorant Negro\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nIn suggesting the benefits that would accrue to the weaker race from\r\nlegalized race distinctions, it is assumed that such distinctions would\r\napply only in communities in which two races live side by side in\r\nsomething like equal numbers. The white people of the South should\r\nrecognize the inexpediency of requiring separate schools, separate\r\nrailroad and street cars, separate hotels, and separate accommodations\r\nin general for the colored races in most places outside the South where\r\nthey constitute, in many instances, not more than one-tenth of the total\r\npopulation. The white people in the places last mentioned should\r\nrecognize that it would be equally unwise to crowd together white and\r\ncolored races in schools, public conveyances, hotels, theatres, and\r\nother public places in the South. Colored people everywhere should\r\nrealize that a race distinction is not necessarily a badge of racial\r\ninferiority, but may be simply a natural result of racial\r\ndifferentiation. Race distinctions may, therefore, have a very\r\nappropriate place in communities where, as has been said before, two\r\nraces are about equal in numbers, at least where there are enough of the\r\nsubordinate race to arouse in the dominant a feeling of race\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nWhere, under the above view, race distinctions are justifiable, and are\r\nenacted into law, the people of all races should unite in demanding that\r\nthe laws be fairly applied. If, for instance, the presence of sufficient\r\nNegroes make it advisable to separate the races in public conveyances,\r\nthe white people should unite with them in demanding that they be given\r\nequal accommodations. The Negro who has paid a first-class fare is\r\nentitled to coaches and waiting-rooms as sanitary, comfortable, and\r\nconvenient as those provided for white persons paying the same fare.\r\nWith separate schools provided, they should insist that each race be\r\ngiven an equal opportunity to get the sort of training it most needs to\r\ndo its work. This training may be different. The Southern Education\r\nAssociation[776] in session at Lexington, Kentucky, said: “On account of\r\neconomic and psychological differences in the two races we believe there\r\nshould be a difference in the courses of study and methods of teaching,\r\nand that there should be such an adjustment of school curricula as shall\r\nmeet the evident needs of Negro youth.” If it is true that the Negro\r\nchild needs a different sort of training from the white, then it is a\r\ndiscrimination to give him the training peculiarly suited to the child\r\nof the other race. People may demand for the two races equal educational\r\nopportunities, and at the same time advocate different courses of study\r\nand methods of teaching.\r\n\r\nIn States which have added new qualifications for suffrage, both races\r\nmay demand their impartial application. A Negro public spirited enough\r\nto pay his taxes, with education enough to read and write, or thrifty\r\nenough to accumulate the required amount of property should be allowed\r\nto register and vote as freely as a white man with similar\r\nqualifications. A white registrar who discriminates against a Negro\r\napplicant, by setting for him more difficult tests than are set for\r\nwhite applicants, is doing an injustice to the white people equally as\r\ngreat as that done to the Negroes. John B. Knox,[777] President of the\r\nAlabama Constitutional Convention of 1901, said at that time: “If we\r\nwould have white supremacy, we must establish it by law—not by force or\r\nfraud. If you teach your boy that it is right to buy a vote, it is an\r\neasy step for him to learn to use money to bribe or corrupt officials or\r\ntrustees of any class. If you teach your boy that it is right to steal a\r\nvote, it is an easy step for him to believe that it is right to steal\r\nwhatever he may need or greatly desire.” Speaking from the standpoint of\r\nthe Negro, Dr. Booker T. Washington[778] said: “As a rule, I believe in\r\nuniversal, free suffrage, but I believe that in the South we are\r\nconfronted with peculiar conditions that justify the protection of the\r\nballot in many of the States, for a while at least, either by an\r\neducational test, a property test, or by both combined; but whatever\r\ntests are required, they should be made to apply with equal and exact\r\njustice to both races.” All people, white and black, should unite, not\r\nto secure the repeal of the suffrage laws, but to secure their\r\nenforcement with absolute impartiality.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of both races—and this conclusion applies equally to the\r\nother non-Caucasian races—requires the recognition of race distinctions\r\nand the obliteration of race discriminations. The races should be\r\nseparated wherever race friction might result from their enforced\r\nassociation. The white race cannot attain its highest development when\r\ncontinually venting its spite upon the less fortunate race. Nor, indeed,\r\ncan the Negro race reach its highest development when continually\r\nsubjected to the oppressions of the more fortunate race.\r\n\r\nSuch a recognition of race distinctions and such an obliteration of race\r\ndiscriminations as are here advocated constitute principles by which all\r\npeople, of every section and of every race, may stand and labor for the\r\npromotion of good feeling between all sections and harmony between all\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\nFootnote 776:\r\n\r\n  Raleigh, N.
