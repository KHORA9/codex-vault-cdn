This question contains the following useful and important\r\ninstruction: That no man or body of men should attempt the\r\naccomplishment of any great object without duly estimating the evils and\r\nbenefits probably resulting from it. Such a rule of life and adopted and\r\nadhered to would have prevented many schemes and projects which have\r\ncost much, and which have been productive of nothing but the disgrace to\r\ntheir authors and misery to the human race--it would induce men to obey\r\nthe dictates of experience rather than the dreams of enthusiasm, and\r\nwould drive from the world a species of wisdom which is indeed folly.\r\n\r\nAn attempt is now making in this State to change the vital principles of\r\nour government, to remove from office all our present rulers, and to\r\nintroduce a new order of things. To these innovations the people are\r\ninvited, allured and exhorted.--To effect these objects no pains are\r\nspared--no exertions are omitted.\r\n\r\nAn important question here arises, viz. Would the accomplishment of the\r\nobject be worth the cost?--An individual who neither holds an office\r\nnor seeks one--who can have nothing in view but the maintenance of that\r\norder of things which shall most effectually promote public and private\r\nhappiness, and who has the same interest in the welfare of society as\r\nthe great body of his fellow citizens, requests the dispassionate\r\nattention of the reader, while he considers this important subject. He\r\nwill use no weapon but truth and truth will be regarded by all except\r\nthose who love darkness rather than light.\r\n\r\nTo exhibit a correct view of the subject, it will be proper, first, to\r\nenquire into the present condition of Connecticut, and secondly, to\r\nexamine the various plans or projects proposed for our adoption, and\r\nestimate the probably cost attending them. We can then in the third\r\nplace form a just opinion of the propriety of the proposed changes.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Connecticut first claims our attention.\r\n\r\nThat our climate, soil and situation are such as to insure as much\r\nhealth, riches and prosperity as any people can rationally wish, seems\r\nnot to be doubted. Our natural advantages do not indeed promise such an\r\naccumulation of wealth as might satisfy that avarice which like the\r\nhorse leach is constantly crying give--give--they are such however as\r\nwill in ordinary cases, ensure to industry an ample reward and this\r\nshould satisfy a virtuous mind.\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of knowledge is greater than in any other part of the\r\nglobe of equal dimensions. Such are the excellent provisions of our\r\nlaws, and the virtuous habits of our citizens, that schools of\r\ninstruction in all useful knowledge are to be found in every place where\r\nthey are needed. There is no village in this State which will not attest\r\nto this fact. In various places also flourishing academies are\r\nsupported, in which the higher branches of science are taught, and our\r\nCollege is at once our ornament and our pride. Religious instruction is\r\nalso brought almost to every man's door, so that none can justly\r\ncomplain that they are denied the means of growing wiser and better. By\r\nthe liberality of the benevolent private libraries are every where found\r\nwhich, with the other sources of information, evince the superiority of\r\nour condition to that of any other people, in the means of gaining\r\nvaluable knowledge. To those, who with the writer, believe that\r\nignorance is the parent of vice, and that the civilized is preferable to\r\nthe savage state, our situation, in the above particulars, demands the\r\ngratitude of every heart.\r\n\r\nOur constitution and government are perfectly free, and our laws are\r\nmild, equitable and just. To the truth of this position there is the\r\nmost ample and unequivocal proof.\r\n\r\n1. Those who seek to revolutionize the State declare this to be the\r\nnature of our government with few exceptions.--Such testimony cannot be\r\ndoubted--it is the testimony of a man against himself. Ask your\r\nneighbour to point you to the evils under which he labours--ask him to\r\nname the man who is oppressed except by his vices or his follies, and if\r\nhe be honest, he will tell you that there is no such man--if he be\r\ndishonest, his silence will be proof in point.\r\n\r\n2. Strangers who reside here a sufficient time to learn our laws,\r\nuniversally concur in their declarations on this subject. They will ask,\r\nwith surprize, why the people of Connecticut should complain? They see\r\nevery man indulged in worshiping  God as he pleases, and they see many\r\nindulged in neglecting his worship entirely--They see men every where\r\nenjoying the liberty of doing what is right--and such liberty they\r\nrightly decide is the perfection of freedom.\r\n\r\n3. The experience of a century and a half, affords irresistible proof on\r\nthis subject. During this long period convulsions have shaken many parts\r\nof the earth, and there has been a mighty waste of human happiness.\r\nEmpires and Kingdoms have been prostrated, and the sword hath been\r\ndevouring without cessation. This state too hath been threatened--\r\nclouds have gathered and portended a dreadful desolation, but we have\r\nbeen defended, protected and saved. No essential changes in our\r\ngovernment have ever taken place--formed by men who knew the important\r\ndifference between liberty and licentiousness, it has been our shield--\r\nour strong tower--our secure fortress.--To the calls of our country we\r\nhave ever been obedient--No state hath more cheerfully met danger--no\r\nstate hath more readily or effectually resisted foreign aggression.\r\nWashington while living was a witness to this fact, and tho' dead he yet\r\nspeaketh. While plots, insurrections and rebellions have distressed many\r\nstates and nations, Connecticut hath enjoyed an internal peace and\r\ntranquility, which forcibly demonstrates the wisdom and equity of her\r\nGovernment.--Such a Government, administered by men of virtue and\r\ntalents, has produced the most benign effects, and our prosperity is\r\ncalculated to excite the warmest expressions of gratitude rather than\r\nthe murmurs of disaffection.\r\n\r\n4. Our Treasury exhibits the truth of these remarks. It is clear from the\r\nstatement in the Appendix, to which every reader will advert with\r\npleasure, that the people of Connecticut annually receive thirty seven\r\nthousand four hundred and fifty-five dollars and seventy six cents more\r\nfrom the Treasury than they pay into it by taxes and duties.--At the\r\nclose of the late war such had been our exertions, we were encumbered\r\nwith a debt of nearly two millions of dollars. Now that debt is paid and\r\nwe have nearly that sum in advance. Where is the state which can justly\r\nboast of greater prosperity?\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this enviable situation a clamour is excited, the\r\npeople are agitated, and discord, with its train of evils, is\r\nprevailing. Some of our citizens, in the height of political prosperity,\r\nare seeking to destroy an order of things which has prevailed an hundred\r\nand fifty years, and throw themselves into the arms of projectors and\r\nreformers. Is there nothing unaccountable in such conduct? Is there\r\nnothing calculated to excite indignation? My fellow citizens, shall any\r\nconsiderable portion of the people of Connecticut subject themselves to\r\nthe reproach which rested on an ancient people? \"The ox knoweth his\r\nowner and the ass his master's crib, but my people do not know, Israel\r\ndoth not consider.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly. Let us examine some of the plans and projects proposed for our\r\nadoption and estimate the probably cost attending them.– Here we must\r\nspeak with less certainty--What the present condition of Connecticut is\r\nwe know--respecting its future destiny we can only judge by arguing\r\nfrom cause to effect. Why a man who regards the happiness of his fellow\r\nmen, should attempt a change here, is too wonderful for an ordinary\r\ncapacity. No prudent farmer ever pulled up a hill of corn, which was\r\nflourishing, to see if there was not a worm at the root.\r\n\r\nOne of these projects is the repeal of all laws for the support of\r\nreligious institutions. The language of those who favor the measure is,\r\nthat religion will take care of itself--that no external aid is\r\nnecessary--that all legislative interference is impious. Many, and it\r\nis believed by far the greater part, of those who make these\r\ndeclarations, intend to throw down all the barriers which christianity\r\nhas erected against vice. They are obstinately determined to banish from\r\nthe public mind all affection and veneration for the Clergy, and respect\r\nfor the institutions of religion, and to reduce Connecticut to that\r\ncondition which knows no distinction between \"him who serveth God and\r\nhim who serveth him not.\" They wish to see a Republic without religion;\r\nand should they be gratified, the consequence would speedily be, a\r\nmiserable race of men without virtue, walling in vice and ripening for a\r\ndreadful destruction. If infinite truth is to be credited, \"God will\r\npour out his indignation on the heathen who know him not.\"\r\n\r\nThese reformers, under the specious pretext of exercising unbounded\r\nliberality in matters of religion, become intolerant to all who differ\r\nfrom them, charging the professors of christianity with breathing out a\r\nspirit of persecution, they become the most furious persecutors, and\r\nwhile they affect to possess great moderation and candor towards all\r\ndenominations of Christians, they clearly evince that they would grant\r\nindulgence or protection to none. On the other hand a great majority of\r\nthe people and the Legislature, insist that every man in the community\r\nwho is able, should contribute, in some way, towards the support of the\r\ninstitutions of religion. No wish is entertained to legislate in matters\r\nof faith, or to establish one sect in preference to another. Our laws\r\npermit every man to worship God when, where, and in the manner most\r\nagreeable to his principles or to his inclination, and not the least\r\nrestraint is imposed; all ideas of dictating to the conscience are\r\ndiscarded, and every man \"sits under his own vine and fig tree.\" Our\r\nlaws only enforce the great principle abovementioned that the members of\r\nthe community should contribute towards the support of these\r\ninstitutions, as means to promote the prosperity of the people in the\r\nsame manner as they provide for the public accommodation, peace and\r\nhappiness, by the maintenance of the roads and bridges, the organization\r\nof the militia, and the support of schools of instruction. Should\r\nobjections be urged by any individuals that they cannot conscientiously\r\ncontribute to the promotion of these objects, their objections would be\r\ndisregarded. There is a class of men, very respectable for the sobriety\r\nof their habits, and their peaceful deportment, who always refuse to be\r\ntaxed for military defence. No one doubts that in their opposition, they\r\nare conscientious, and yet few doubt the propriety of enforcing such\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThe principle now advocated is interwoven with all our laws and habits\r\n--it has existed from the first settlement of the State--it has produced\r\nmuch good--it ought not therefore to be abandoned without the utmost\r\ndeliberation. The clamor against this principle, is the clamor of those\r\nwho wish to see the State revolutionized--it is the clamor of those\r\nturbulent spirits which delight in confusion and which pull down and\r\ndestroy with a dexterity which they never shew in building up. Let the\r\nsober citizens of Connecticut look at the authors of this clamor--Let\r\nthem view such men as Abraham Bishop, and eye the path which they have\r\ntrodden from their youth, and then ask their own hearts, if they are not\r\nunder some apprehension, lest if they should enlist under such leaders\r\nand fight their cause, they may be found contending against the best\r\ninterests of society, and \"fighting against God.\"\r\n\r\nAnother project zealously supported is that of Districting the State for\r\nthe choice of Assistants, and Representatives in Congress. The only\r\nargument which is urged for the adoption of this measure with any\r\nplausibility, is that in the District elections the candidate would be\r\nbetter known. To this argument it may be replied, the State of\r\nConnecticut is so limited in its extent, information of all kinds is so\r\ngenerally diffused, and there is such a flood of newspapers that the\r\ncharacters of all the candidates for office may be thoroughly known by\r\nall who will bestow any attention to the subject. This State is scarcely\r\nmore extensive than a single county in many other States, and the\r\nintercourse of the inhabitants of the various parts with each other is\r\nsuch that no evil can exist in our present mode of elections--But there\r\nare serious and weighty objections against District elections.\r\n\r\n1. Such elections open wide the door for intrigue.--As this door,\r\nalready too widely extended, the most alarming mischiefs enter--\r\nmischiefs which sap the foundations of an elective government by\r\ncorrupting the minds of the freemen and this converting an election\r\nground into a theatre on which is displayed the most vile and\r\ndemoralizing practices. Let the reader satisfy himself as to the truth\r\nof this observation by examining the history of an election in the\r\nSouthern States, where this mode alone is adopted. Let him learn that\r\nthey candidates for office and his host of dependents and tools, are\r\nemployed for weeks before and on the days of election, in the most\r\ninfamous intrigues, and that falsehood and bribery are so much in\r\nfashion, and are so universally resorted to, that success invariably\r\nattends the most impudent and the most profligate, while the man of\r\nmodesty and virtue, though possessing the fairest claims to promotion,\r\nis abashed, confounded and overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n2ndly. The candidate when elected becomes the creature of the district\r\nand not the ruler of a State--He is and must be devoted to the interest\r\nof that portion of the community which has elected him, and their views\r\nand schemes must be patronized though they oppose the welfare of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n3rdly. Such elections do not secure the best talents. If talents and\r\nworth are of consideration, surely they should be at the command of the\r\npublic. It is of no moment where a man dwells, but it is of immense\r\nimportance that he be a wise man rather than a fool--a man of integrity\r\nrather than a knave.\r\n\r\n4thly. Experience, the only save and unerring guide, is altogether in\r\nfavor of elections at large rather than by Districts. The representation\r\nof this State in Congress has ever been of the most respectable\r\ncharacter--It is not too much to say that no State in the Union can\r\njustly claim a superiority to Connecticut in this respect. The fame may\r\nbe affirmed, with truth, of the upper house of the Legislature of this\r\nState. Has there not been a constant succession of able and wise men in\r\nthat branch of the administration of Connecticut? For more than a\r\ncentury we have preserved an unexampled prosperity.--shall we hazard\r\nour interests on the speculations of zealous partizans who are\r\nconstantly bewildering themselves and their followers in new schemes?\r\n\r\nAnother project is that of universal suffrage. The streets resound with\r\nthe clamour that men are deprived of the invaluable privilege of\r\nchoosing their rulers, and the people are invited to extend this\r\nprivilege to all who pay taxes and do military duty. It is now\r\ndiscovered that Connecticut, in this particular, is not free.--The\r\ngreat argument urged in support of universal suffrage is that taxation\r\nand representation should go hand in hand--it is said that this maxim\r\nwas deemed just during the revolutionary war, and that Americans adhered\r\nto it as a fundamental principle.--This principle the writer readily\r\nrecognizes as a sound and indisputable position in every free\r\ngovernment. But what is the meaning of the maxim? Does it intend that\r\nevery person who is taxed, can of right claim the privilege of giving\r\nhis suffrage? If so persons convicted of offences, or who are infamous\r\nfor their vices may vote--for such persons are not outlawed.--On this\r\nprinciple, women of full age and unmarried, are also to be admitted.--\r\nMinors also whose property is taxed, should be permitted to exercise\r\nthis franchise, at least by guardian or proxy. What then is the true\r\nmeaning of the maxim, that representation and taxation are inseparable?\r\nHere all writers agree--it means that no community should be taxed by\r\nthe legislature unless that community is, or might have been represented\r\nin such legislature.--Hence several towns in this State till lately,\r\nwere not represented in the General Assembly, and of course not taxed.--\r\nBarkhempsted, Colebrook, and Winchester, it is believed, were of this\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThis State and the other States understood this maxim precisely as now\r\nexplained, in their opposition to Great-Britain.--We complained that\r\nthe colonies should not be taxed because they were not represented in\r\nparliament. In this view of the subject the maxim is wise and just.\r\n\r\nAgain, is not every town in Connecticut now represented in the\r\nlegislature, and of course each individual equally with every other? In\r\nthe representative of Hartford, for example, a representative of the\r\nfreemen of Hartford, or of the town of Hartford? The truth is, every\r\nman, woman and child are represented.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that many persons are excluded from giving their\r\nsuffrages who have life, liberty and reputation to protect. On a close\r\nattention to this fact it will be found that the number of those worthy\r\nmembers of society who do not possess the legal qualification, is small,\r\nand if men are to have an influence in elections according to the amount\r\nof their taxes, why should not the man who pays fifty dollars, be\r\nentitled to more than one vote? No one pleads for such a privilege, but\r\nthere are many who insist that the man without a cent of property shall\r\nhave the same direction in the choice of those who are charged with the\r\ninterests of the community, as he who is worth thousands of dollars. A\r\nfriend to the rights of man seems to feel no alarm at the idea that one\r\nwho exhausts his earnings in the grog-shop, should have an influence in\r\nelections in proportion to strength of his lungs, or his activity in\r\nintrigue, but he is greatly agitated from an apprehension that men who\r\nhave property to protect, will not promote the well being of society. A\r\njuror who is to decide on the controversies of his neighbours--an\r\nappraiser of land--a distributor of a deceased persons estate, must be\r\nfreeholders by a standing law which is the subject of no ensure, and yet\r\nit is said that in the important transaction of choosing men to enact\r\nlaws, and to appoint those who are to decide on, and execute those laws,\r\nno qualifications are necessary.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is insisted by those who oppose universal suffrage, and the\r\nreader is desired to notice the remark with attention, that no community\r\ncan be safe unless the power of elections resides principally with the\r\ngreat body of the landholders. Such an influence had this principle on\r\nthose wise men who formed our laws, that a mere trifle in real property\r\ngives the right of suffrage, while a man may be excluded who is the\r\nproprietor of personal property to a large amount.\r\n\r\nLandholders have an enduring interest in the welfare of the community.\r\nThey are lords of their own soil, and of course, to a certain degree,\r\nindependent--they therefore will resist tyranny--they will equally\r\noppose anarchy because they are aware that in any storm which may arise\r\nthey must abide its fury. The merchant, with his thousands, can seek a\r\nshelter--to the mere bird of passage, who has no \"abiding country and\r\nwho seeks none to come,\" it is of little moment whether stability or\r\nconfusion predominate, but to the former who is enchained to the State,\r\npeace and order is of inestimable value.\r\n\r\nWhat, my fellow citizens, is the attempt now making? What is the\r\nlanguage of those who advocate universal suffrage? It is nothing less\r\nthan an effort to rest from the farmers of Connecticut that controul\r\nover the elections which is their only fortress of safety. Let men who\r\nwish to protect their invaluable rights ponder on these things, and let\r\nthem at the same time, remember that no nation in which universal\r\nsuffrage hath been allowed, hath remained free and happy.\r\n\r\nAnother project urged, with great vehemence, is, to displace all our\r\npresent rulers--by those, is meant our legislators in the general and\r\nstate Government--our judges and magistrates of every grade. That such\r\nis a darling object with those who seek to revolutionize Connecticut,\r\nthere is no doubt. Is such a measure wise? Who are these rulers? A\r\ncandid observer must reply, they are men in whose hands power has been\r\nwisely placed by the people, and who have never abused that power, men\r\nof unquestionable talents and of spotless fame. Among them are your\r\nTrumbulls, your Ellsworths, your Hillhouses, your Griswolds, your\r\nGoodriches and your Cavenports, men tried and approved. Among them there\r\nis one who was side by side with your beloved Washington during the\r\nrevolutionary war, who has repeatedly been elected your first\r\nmagistrate, and, against whom, the tongue of slander never moved but in\r\nthe hard service of a harder master. There is another, who, for more\r\nthan twenty years has been employed in the first offices in the gift of\r\nhis country, and whose probity and talents are second to those of none\r\nof his contemporaries. Among these are many who must enjoy the affection\r\nand veneration of their countrymen while superior worth is regarded.\r\nAgainst these men the cry is raised--not the cry of the oppressed, for\r\nGod knows no man in Connecticut is oppressed, but the cry of those who\r\npant for office, and who can rise only on the ruins of others.\r\n\r\nYour judges also to whom is committed the administration of justice, are\r\nmarked out as the victims of party spirit. Is not a wise and faithful\r\nexecution of the laws the chief object of every good Government? Without\r\nthis who is safe for a moment? Without this, liberty can exist only in\r\nname--The name indeed may be blasphemously uttered, but the substance\r\nis gone with the liberty of all who have relied on professions. Let the\r\npeople of Connecticut look at their tribunals of justice. Are they not\r\nfilled with men of incorruptible integrity? Where has innocence received\r\na more ample protection? Is not the transgressor punished, and are not\r\nthe wrongs of the injured redressed? Are not our mild laws executed in\r\nmercy, and is not justice awarded with impartiality to individuals? Can\r\nyou look at the seat of justice and say \"iniquity is there?\" Dare any\r\nman say that the judges of our high Courts are not upright, intelligent\r\nand learned? Who then can justly complain? Yet the stripling of\r\nyesterday--the bold projector--the unprincipled ad ambitious, with a\r\nhost of deceived followers, with matchless effrontery, arraign the\r\nconduct of these magistrates and loudly demand that they be driven from\r\ntheir offices, and from public confidence.\r\n\r\nAnother favorite scheme is to elevate to all the offices of importance\r\nmen who have never enjoyed the public confidence. The language of these\r\nrevolutionists is, respecting the men in power in Connecticut, \"We will\r\nnot have these men to rule over us\"--We will fill their places with men\r\nof our choice--the creatures of our hands, and who will be subservient\r\nto our views. But, my countrymen, before you join in this project, pause\r\nand enquire, who are these men who thus assert their claim to rule over\r\nyou? Who are these men who place themselves in the corners of the\r\nstreets and cry \"Oh, that we were made judges in the land?\" It is no\r\npart of the writer's design to hunt vice from its guilty retreat, to\r\nexpose before an insulted people, the horrid features which distinguish\r\ncertain individuals who challenge popular applause, or to attach private\r\ncharacter, but justice demands that men who boldly claim to be the\r\nrulers of the free and happy state of Connecticut, should be known. The\r\nmen who are to stand in the places of our Trumbulls and our Ellsworths\r\nshould not shrink from public investigation. To those who respect the\r\nauthority of God it is a matter of no small moment that those who rule\r\nover men should be just, ruling in the fear of God nor will men,\r\naccustomed to revere this solemn declaration, lend their aid to elevate\r\nmen of vicious and corrupt lives, without some dismay.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to tell us that men will be selected of more virtue and\r\ntalents than those now in power--such a pretence is vain--no man in\r\nhis senses will regard it--no man makes such a pretence but for wicked\r\npurpose. If we are directed to turn our eyes to those who for years past\r\nhave been held up in the unsuccessful nominations, and are told that\r\nthese are to be substituted for the men who now guide our Councils, what\r\nare we to expect? An appeal may be made to every man not bewildered in\r\nthis new and destructive madness--he may be asked who among these men\r\nstand-forth with fair claims to public confidence? Where among them, can\r\nbe found the polished scholar--the able civilian, the enlightened\r\njudge? Do we see in a single individual an assemblage of talents united\r\nwith virtue sufficient to qualify him for the seat of justice? If there\r\nare such men they have hitherto hid their talents I the earth. It will\r\nnot here be forgotten that the attempt is, to reject men long known and\r\nrespected, and to fill their places with those who are without a witness\r\nin their favor.\r\n\r\nA still more mischievous and alarming project is, that of making a new\r\nConstitution for Connecticut. This project originates entirely in a\r\nspirit of Jacobinism--it is a new theme on which to descant to effect a\r\nrevolution in Connecticut. The object is, by false assertions, to induce\r\na belief that no Constitution exists and that tyranny prevails. This\r\nparty always address the passions and never the understanding.--Review\r\ntheir measures for a few years, and you will distinctly perceive their\r\nmotives and aims.\r\n\r\nTo create disaffection and hatred towards those who formerly\r\nadministered the general Government, it was boldly asserted that the\r\ntreasury had been plundered. Even the illustrious Saviour of his Country\r\nwas accused of embezzling public money, and his followers could not\r\nexpect a less happy fate. Men of the most unsuspected integrity, were\r\nopenly attacked by anonymous publications, or dispoiled of their good\r\nname by secret insinuations. These calumnies were kept in circulation by\r\ntheir authors till impudence itself was abashed, and the object in view\r\nobtained--not a tittle of proof was ever adduced, and investigation\r\nalways shewed that the charges were not only false, but entirely\r\ngroundless.\r\n\r\nFor the same unworthy purpose it was asserted in every circle of\r\nopposition that salaries were too high, and the incomes of office\r\nenormous. Every tavern resounded with this grievance. At length the\r\nprincipal authors of this clamor got into place, and the clamor was\r\nhushed. Yes, men who urged the people of Connecticut almost to rebellion\r\non this account, stept into the places and, without a blush, took more\r\nfrom the people than their predecessors. Look at Mr. Babcock's paper in\r\n1799 and 1800, and see its columns filled with railing against high\r\nsalaries--Look at it since Abraham Bishop takes 3000 dollars a year,\r\nand Alexander Wolcott more than four, and find, if you can, a complaint\r\non this subject. Such meanness, such baseness, such hypocrisy in office\r\nseekers, exhibit in strong colors the depravity of human nature and\r\nteach us what dependence may justly be placed on pretensions and\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\nTo inflame the passions and to create animosity, various subjects have\r\nbeen successively seized upon, and pressed into the service of the\r\nrevolutionists--Every quarrel however trivial is noticed--every seed\r\nof discord however small is nourished to disseminate murmurs and to\r\nfurther the great object.-Various classes of the community are told,\r\nwith apparent anxiety for their welfare, that they are oppressed, and\r\nthat a new order of things must arise, or that they will be enslaved.\r\nNew subjects are started as old ones cease to operate, and thus all that\r\ningenuity and art, industry and perseverance, can devise or effect is\r\naccomplished. Thus, that numerous and respectably body of Christians\r\ncalled Episcopalians have been told, and repeatedly told, that the more\r\nnumerous denomination were seeking to deprive them of their just and\r\nequal rights, and to subject them to the tyranny of an overbearing\r\nmajority--These tales were reiterated till their authors found them\r\nuseless from their folly and falsehood. At another time the Baptists are\r\naddressed by a set of men who denied the reality of any religion and the\r\nmost earnest yearnings for their welfare. They tyranny of the\r\nLegislature was painted in horrid colors, and they were exhorted to lend\r\ntheir aid to vindicate the cause of the oppressed. Those who\r\nconscientiously believe that no taxes ought to be paid for the support\r\nof religion, and those who wish that religion might no more infest the\r\nresidence of men, were addressed with considerations adapted to their\r\nrespective cases. At one time men destitute of property are seduced by\r\nthe alluring doctrine of universal suffrage--then the farmer is told\r\nthat taxes are too high on land, and, with the same breath, the mechanic\r\nis sagely informed, that the poll tax should be repealed, and the burden\r\nfall back on the land holder.\r\n\r\nFestivals under the pretence of honoring the election of Mr. Jefferson\r\nand Mr. Burr, and of extolling the wisdom of the purchase of Louisiana,\r\nbut with a real design to blazen the fame of those who assume the\r\ncharacter of friends of the people that they may the more readily\r\ndestroy the most free and equitable Government in the world, are\r\ncontinually holden, and the discontented, the factious, the ambitious\r\nand the corrupt, are collected and flattered with declamations in the\r\nvarious shapes of prayers, sermons and orations. Thus a people enjoying\r\nthe height of political prosperity are cajoled into a belief that men\r\nwithout virtue, without the restraints of the gospel, without a particle\r\nof real regard for their fellow men, are their best friends, and are\r\nanxiously laboring to promote their good. Let such remember, that when\r\nthe Ethiopian shall change his skin, when the Leopard shall change his\r\nspots, and when bitter fountains shall send forth sweet water, then will\r\nthose who flatter the people with their tongues, and deceive them with\r\ntheir lips seek their happiness. Such are some of the measures resorted\r\nto by those who have sworn in their wrath that Connecticut shall be\r\nrevolutionized. Finding all these ineffectual, and that the good sence\r\nand virtue of Connecticut has hitherto opposed an inseparable barrier to\r\nall their plans, they now exclaim Connecticut has no Constitution. Such\r\na gross absurdity could never have been promulgated till the mind was in\r\nsome degree prepared, by being accustomed to misrepresentation. This was\r\nwell known to Mr. Bishop, who has for years been in the habit of\r\ndisregarding moral obligation. In the year 1789 this Orator pronounced\r\nseveral inflammatory invectives against the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, to which he was a bitter enemy till he obtained an office under\r\nit worth three thousand dollars a year. At that time his language was,\r\nThe Constitution of Connecticut is the best in the world--it has grown\r\nup with the people, and is fitted to their condition.--Now this\r\nconsistent man who is endeavoring to gull the people that he may\r\nsuccessfully tyrannize over them, avows that they are without a\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens, examine this head of clamor with candor, read the\r\nsolemn declaration of Washington in the title page, attend to the\r\nfollowing remarks, and then tell me if you do not perceive in this\r\nproject, with the manner in which it is supported and attempted to be\r\naccomplished, enough of the revolutionary spirit of France, to excite\r\nthe indignation of every real friend to the peace and happiness of\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\n1. If there be no Constitution in Connecticut then your Huntingtons,\r\nyour Trumbulls, your Shermans, your Wolcotts and your Davenports, with\r\nmany other worthies, who were your defence in war, and your ornament in\r\npeace, and who are now sleeping with their fathers, were wicked usurpers\r\n--they ruled their fellow citizens without authority--they were\r\nTYRANTS. Let Judd and Bishop approach the sepulchures of these venerable\r\nmen--let them lift the covering from these venerable ashes and in the\r\nface of heaven pronounce them TYRANTS!! Could you see them approach\r\ntheir dust with such language on their tongues, you would see them\r\nretreat with horrible confusion from these relicks of departed worth.\r\n\r\n2. The present rulers are acting also without authority, and their laws\r\nare void--then you are already in the midst of anarchy and wild misrule\r\n--then has no man a title to an inch of land, and you are ready for an\r\nequal of division of property--all protection of life and liberty is at\r\nan end, and the will of a mob is now to prevail.\r\n\r\n3. If indeed there is no Constitution, then the oath which has been\r\nadministered in your freemen's meetings for twenty years, by which each\r\nman has sworn \"to be true and faithful to the Constitution\" of the\r\nstate, is worse than impious profanation of the name of God--then your\r\njudges, magistrates and jurors have stripped men of their property,\r\ncondemned some to Newgate and others to the Post, the Pillory and the\r\nGallows without a warrant, and are therefore murderers.--O thou God of\r\norder in this our condition!!! But,\r\n\r\n4. We have a Constitution--a free and happy Constitution. It was to our\r\nfathers like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land--it has enabled\r\nthem to transmit to us a fair and glorious inheritance--if we suffer\r\nrevolutionists to rob us of this birth right \"then we are bastards and\r\nnot sons.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a fact as well authenticated as the settlement of the state, that\r\na Constitution was formed by the people of the then colony of\r\nConnecticut, before the Charter of King Charles. This Charter was a\r\nguarantee of that Constitution. Trumbull's history of Connecticut gives\r\nus this Constitution and its origin. On our separation from Great-\r\nBritain, the people, thro' their representatives, made the following\r\ndeclaration on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"An Act containing an Abstract and Declaration of the Rights and\r\nPrivileges of the People of this State, and securing the same. THE\r\nPeople of this State, being by the Providence of God, free and\r\nindependent, have the sole and exclusive Right of governing themselves\r\nas a free, sovereign, and independent State; and having from their\r\nAncestors derived a free and excellent Constitution of Government\r\nwhereby the Legislature depends on the free and annual Election of the\r\nPeople, they have the best Security for the Preservation of their civil\r\nand religious Rights and Liberties. And forasmuch as the free Fruition\r\nof such Liberties and Privileges as Humanity, Civility and Christianity\r\ncall for, as is due to every Man in his Place and Proportion, without\r\nImpeachment and Infringement, hath ever been, and wilt be the\r\nTranquility and Stability of Churches and Commonwealths; and the Denial\r\nthereof, the Disturbance, if not the Ruin of both.\r\n\r\nPAR. I.  BE it enacted and declared by the Governor, and Council and\r\nHouse of Representatives, in General Court assembled: That the ancient\r\nForm of Civil Government, contained in the Charter from Charles the\r\nSecond, King of England, and adopted by the People of this State, shall\r\nbe and remain the Civil Constitution of this State under the sole\r\nauthority of the People thereof, independent of any King or Prince\r\nwhatever. And that this Republic is, and shall forever be and remain, a\r\nfree, sovereign and independent Sate, by the Name of the STATE of\r\nCONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n2. And be it further enacted and declared, That no Man's Land shall be\r\ntaken away: No Man's Honor or good Name shall be stained: No Man's\r\nPerson shall be arrested, restrained, banished, dismembered, nor any\r\nWays punished: No Man shall be deprived of his Wife or Children; No\r\nMan's Goods or Estate shall be taken away from him nor any Ways\r\nindamaged under the Color of Law, or Countenance of Authority; unless\r\nclearly warranted by the Laws of this State.\r\n\r\n3. That all the Free Inhabitants of this or any other of the United\r\nStates of America, and Foreigners in Amity with this State, shall enjoy\r\nthe same justice and Law within this State, which is general for the\r\nState in all Cases proper for the Cognizance of the Civil Authority and\r\nCourt of Judicature within the same, and that without Partiality or\r\nDelay.\r\n\r\n4. And that no Man's Person shall be restrained, or imprisoned, by any\r\nAuthority whatsoever, before the Law hat sentenced him thereunto, if he\r\ncan and will give sufficient Security, Bail, or Mainprize for his\r\nAppearance and good Behaviour in the mean Time, unless it be for Capital\r\nCrimes, Contempt in open Court, or in such Cases wherein some express\r\nLaw doth allow of, or order the same.\"\r\n\r\nThese proceedings have been regarded as the ark of our political safety\r\nby the great and the good of all parties, who have gone before us. Never\r\ntill this year have we heard, or even suspected that our state was\r\ngoverned by lawless mobs. Now, as a means to effect a revolution, for\r\nthe first time, have a few designing men endeavored to excite alarm--\r\nthey have indeed excited alarm--sober men of their own party are\r\nalarmed--honest men, who are not misguided, see the whole extent of this\r\nproject and they will frown it into contempt.\r\n\r\n5. Mr. Edwards, as chairman of a body of men whom he calls a State\r\nCommittee, on the 30th of July, without consulting even his brethren of\r\nthe Committee, ordered delegates to meet at New-Haven on the 5th\r\nWednesday of August. In those towns where enough could not be assembled\r\nto elect a member, the person written to, was authorized to attend and\r\ntake a seat. In some towns the proposition was rejected even by\r\nRepublicans. The delegates thus chosen, with all who united with their\r\nopinions, and chose to attend, met at the time and place appointed--shut\r\ntheir doors against every eye and ear--sat one day, formed an address,\r\nordered ten thousand copies printed and dissolved. This address we have\r\nseen. It deserves some notice:\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracts our attention is, that William Judd, Esq.\r\nof Farmington, is appointed chairman. This was an admirable provision\r\n--such a meeting should certainly have such a head. A man with the habit\r\nof devoting his feeble talents to intrigue, and who is noticeable only\r\nfor an ostentatious parade, would preside in such an assembly with\r\npeculiar grace. His acquaintance could not but approve of this\r\nexhibition of the power of inflammable air and be pleased with its\r\neffects [on] an exhausted receiver. The meeting thus organized proceeded\r\nto stile this Convention as follows: \"AT a meeting of Delegates from\r\nninety-seven towns of the state of Connecticut, convened at New-Haven on\r\nthe 29th of August, 1804.\" Delegates--Delegates do they stile themselves?\r\nThe people would be obliged to this Convention to disclose their\r\nauthority. Who commissioned these gentlemen for this important labor of\r\nproviding them with a Constitution? The truth is not a man in that\r\nConvention was chosen by a majority of the people of [their] town--in\r\nmany instances with less than a quarter part, and in general with less\r\nthan a tenth----yet they call themselves Delegates. Thus [the]\r\nConvention with Major Judd in the chair, precede their address [with] a\r\ngrosly deceptive declaration---a declaration notoriously false and\r\n[impu]dent. They then declare it as their unanimous opinion, \"that the\r\npeople of this state are at present without a Constitution of civil\r\nGovernment.\" This was to have been expected. Mr. Edwards ordered them to\r\nmeet for that purpose, and shall they not obey their master? Bishop and\r\nWolcott have repeatedly directed them to make this declaration, and\r\nMajor Judd knows it to be true. Can any man doubt either the truth of\r\nthis remark or the sincerity with which it is uttered? Is it not clear\r\nthat this whole proceeding originates in a pure unmixed affection for\r\nthe people and a sacred regard to truth? My fellow citizens, look at the\r\nwhole course of the lives of Judd, (I place him first on the list\r\nbecause he was chairman) of Bishop and of Wolcott, and say if they have\r\nnot ever been under the influence of the most disinterested virtue and\r\nthe most exalted patriotism? Look also at these Delegates from ninety-\r\nseven towns, and say if they can have any other object in view but the\r\ndignity, happiness and glory of their country? Individuals can only\r\nvouch for individuals. The writer can vouch for about thirty with Major\r\nJudd at their head.\r\n\r\nIf any reader shall think that the subject is treated with too much\r\nlevity, he should reflect that we are now animadverting on this\r\nConvention in their appointment of chairman, their stiling themselves\r\nDelegates from ninety-seven towns, and their declaration that we have no\r\nConstitution. On these subjects it is scarcely possible to be serious.\r\n\r\nThe address proceeds to declare how many of the confederated states have\r\nmade for themselves Constitutions. We ask, which of them is more\r\nprosperous than Connecticut? In which of them are the great interests of\r\nSociety better secured? In New-York a Convention was called about three\r\nyears since to amend their Constitution. In Pennsylvania they have had\r\ntwo Constitutions and they are now on the eve of a civil war. Duane the\r\ngreat moving spring of all Jacobin societies, a vile outcast from\r\nEurope, reigns with uncontroled sway in every measure, and every man of\r\nvirtue is denounced.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia they have had two Constitutions, and in Vermont two, and who\r\ndare pronounce their political situation equal to that of Connecticut.\r\nThe people of France have had six Constitutions within fifteen years,\r\nand where are those Constitutions? In the grave of anarchy and despotism\r\nwith millions of deluded inhabitants who have been sacrificed by the\r\nRobespieres and the Bishops of that suffering nation. To that suffering\r\nnation turn your eyes and reflect that the mighty mass of woe under\r\nwhich they have groaned, was produced by an ambition, fierce, cruel and\r\ndestructive as hell, and that an ambition alike terrible reigns every\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nRead this address attentively, and you will be struck with the idea that\r\nno grievance is mentioned----not a single evil is pointed out---indeed\r\nthe Convention declare that they must be \"excused a detail of the\r\nnumerous wrongs which have arrived to us under this Government\"----these\r\nare their words---they are excused indeed---yes, they are excused from\r\nnot polluting their address with falsehoods in this particular---full\r\nwell they knew that no such wrongs existed----full well they anticipated\r\nthat a certain detection would follow any such attempt at imposition.\r\nThe leaders in this Convention knew full well that there is intelligence\r\nenough in Connecticut to meet them on any complaint, and to shew that it\r\nis groundless. They, therefore, prudently decline to be explicit, and\r\nyielding to us that the Government is now well administered, they shew a\r\ngreat anxiety for the safety of the \"next generation.\" What an astonishing\r\ndisplay of philanthropy!! Bishop and Wolcott are not at ease in their\r\nhearts while there is a prospect that even the generations which succeed\r\nus, will experience a woe!!\r\n\r\nAfter many remarks directed to the passions, without proposing in\r\nspecific terms a single provision of their newly projected Constitution,\r\nwithout laying their finger upon a single grievance, without urging a\r\nsingle argument tending to shew that a Constitution does not exist, the\r\naddress unmakes itself---it unmasks the Convention---it unmasks these\r\npatriotic Delegates, and discovers the true cause of this Jacobinic\r\nmeeting. Towards the close of it, speaking of the people, it says, \"By\r\ntheir votes will be known their decision. If a Constitution appears\r\ndesirable, they will vote for men who are in favor of it.\" Here the\r\nConvention speak which all may understand---but lest they had not made\r\nthemselves sufficiently intelligible, they add, \"We ask men of all\r\nparties to attend punctually at proxies and to continue a contest of\r\nvotes till the great question whether this state shall have a\r\nConstitution be settled finally and forever.\" Now, the plain English of\r\nthese sentences is this \"We who are here assembled in Convention wish\r\nthe people of Connecticut to vote for such men, in future, for office,\r\nas are in favor of a new Constitution---we have already declared that we\r\nare in favor of such a Constitution---pray therefore vote for us and\r\ncontinue\" the context \"till we succeed and then\"---yes---my fellow-\r\ncitizens, and then, what will they do? Why laugh at your folly---take\r\nall the offices and leave you to take care of yourselves. IF such would\r\nnot be their conduct then the sun will no more rise in the east.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the convention pray cease your pretensions to promotion\r\ntill the people discover your merit. If you are honest, great and wise\r\nyou will certainly be noticed and promoted--if you are pygmy\r\npoliticians, the mushroom growth of an hour, dressed only with the\r\nlittle brief authority of self created delegates to a self created\r\nconvention to aggrandise yourselves, then probably you will live with\r\nlittle further notice, and it will only be said hereafter of you that\r\nyou belonged to an assembly convened at New-Haven on the 29th of August\r\n1804, which sprang up in a day, chose major Judd chairman; and like\r\n\"Jonah's Gourd withered in a day.\"\r\n\r\nIn this convention the question was much discussed whether the address\r\nshould be made to the people or to the constituted authority of our\r\nState, the legislature. Some honest republicans insisted that it was\r\nproper to apply to the Legislature, but this was opposed by the young\r\nlawyers and the leaders of the party universally--full well they knew\r\nthat such a measure would not answer their purpose--Mobs never talk of\r\nany authority except that of the sovereign people--To the sovereign\r\npeople they go, and to the sovereign people they appeal till a sovereign\r\npeople are cruelly insulted, cajoled and enslaved. Marat, Robespierre\r\nand Bonaparte told the sovereign people that they were all in all till\r\nthey had robbed them of their dearest interests, and enchained them in\r\ndespotism, and they now mock them with such declarations as these,* \"The\r\nperfectability of human nature, the worst disease of man\"-\"the caprice\r\nof elections must be destroyed\"-\"the people cannot govern themselves\"\r\n\r\nHaving examined some of the plans or projects proposed for our adoption,\r\nwe will now estimate the probably cost attending them. It is to be\r\nrecollected that the proposition is to change the vital principles of\r\nour government--to displace our present rulers and to fill their places\r\nwith men who never enjoyed the public confidence. To determine whether\r\nthese objects are worth accomplishing, it is necessary to COUNT THE\r\nCOST.\r\n\r\n1. One part of this cost will be an increase of the violence of parties.\r\nMen who regard their property, their liberty and their lives, will not\r\nyield them a willing sacrifice to the demands of the ambitious and\r\nunprincipled--men who faced danger and braved death during a seven years\r\nwar--men whose veins are warm with the blood of their venerable\r\nancestors who planted this happy state, and defended it amidst\r\ninnumerable hardships and calamities--men who deem their birthright\r\nsacred--their own freedom valuable, and their children dear as their own\r\nblood, will not calmly, nor cowardly suffer those who have no claims but\r\ntheir impudence, to storm their fortress and to capture them. They will\r\ndefend it in all lawful ways.-Bishop and Wolcott, and a thousand other\r\nmercenary hirelings may attempt to subdue or terrify them--a proud and\r\nhaughty leader who under the guise of patriotism, is attempting to\r\nundermine the happiness of the best regulated and freest State in the\r\nUnion, with a thousand sycophants, conspiring to bring us under the yoke\r\nof Virginia, may exhaust their ingenuity and malice, still Connecticut\r\nwill remain unshaken. She will never crouch like Isachar to chains and\r\nfetters while any portion of the noble spirit of her ancestors who\r\ntransmitted this fair inheritance at a mighty expense, remains to impel\r\nthem to noble exertions.--It is ardently to be wished that the passions\r\nof those who seek to overturn the venerable institutions of Connecticut,\r\nmy subside, and that a spirit of reconciliation and moderation may\r\nsucceed to that madness which threatens our peace.--If however the\r\ncontroversy is to be continued and a mob insist on the right to rule,\r\nfreemen will protect their lives and their liberties.--And is not the\r\npeace and tranquility of the State of importance? We have been told with\r\nmore truth than sincerity that \"life itself is a dreary thing\" without\r\n\"harmony in social intercourse.\" Happy would it have been if the author\r\nof that just and pertinent remark had not contributed more than any\r\nother man in the United States to embitter parties, and to render life\r\nindeed a \"dreary thing.\"\r\n\r\n2. Another item in the expense of accomplishing these projects, is a\r\ncorruption of morals. To revolutionize Connecticut it will be necessary\r\nto circulate, without any intermission, many gross falsehoods respecting\r\nthe men in power, the judges, legislators and magistrates, and the acts\r\nand proceedings of the General Assembly. We have seen the columns of the\r\nMercury and the Republican Farmer filled with vile libels.--WE have seen\r\nAbraham Bishop followed by hundreds enter a temple devoted to the\r\nservice of God, and we have heard him there utter the most malignant\r\nslanders on the Clergy, the Legislature and the Courts of law.--We have\r\nseen him publicly denounce one class and another of his fellow citizens\r\nas hypocrites, old tories and traitors.--We have seen him receiving for\r\nthis, the applause of a wretched collection of disappointed, ambitious\r\nand corrupt men. This has been borne and the author despised, and\r\nindignantly hissed from the society of the respectable and virtuous--but\r\nthe end is not gained--new themes of reviling--new subjects of abuse\r\nmust be sought, and the party who wish to effect a revolution, are\r\npledged to uphold and protect the agents however wicked. What then may\r\nnow be expected? That dreadful declaration \"Truth is fallen in their\r\nstreets\" will soon be but an inconsiderable part of our miserable\r\ncharacter. It need not be added that such a condition evinces great\r\ncorruption of morals.\r\n\r\n3. Another part of this expense will be the elevation of men to office\r\nwho are unworthy of public confidence. What can a nation or state expect\r\nfrom such men? What could now be expected from these men but that they\r\nbecome immediately the creatures of a party--the tools of a faction? Is\r\nit worthy of no consideration that judges who are to be the arbiters of\r\ncontroversies--who are to adjudicate on the lives of their fellow\r\ncitizens, and to whom is committed the dearest and highest interests of\r\nsociety, should be men of virtue--of wisdom and of unsullied reputation?\r\nCan a Court be a shield against the proud oppressor when a daring leader\r\ncan crush them with his nod? Be not deceived my fellow citizens--no\r\nnation hath yet made such an experiment without feeling its bitter and\r\ndreadful effects. See the revolutionary tribunals of France--See in them\r\na melancholy picture of corrupt courts and unprincipled judges--The\r\ncruelty of that nation hath appeared no where more infernal than through\r\ntheir forms of law and in their sanctuaries of justice--a corrupt\r\njudgment seat is the greatest curse with which a people can be punished.\r\nIn the mean time all subordinate tribunals will partake of the same\r\ncharacter.--Thus instead of a government of laws, there will be the\r\ntyranny of a desperate faction.--Let no one reply that there is no\r\ndanger of such evils in Connecticut. We now see a few leaders controul a\r\nparty of several thousands--We have seen six hundred meet and applaud\r\nthe purchase of Louisiana when not one in five of them could form any\r\nopinion on the merits of the bargain--WE have seen a few leaders direct\r\nthe offering of incense to Burr while the great body of their followers\r\ncursed him--We see a party suffering the pride of Virginia to controul\r\nthe government of the Union and to oppress New-England with a heavy\r\nimpost because she would not submit to internal taxes--We see a few\r\nleaders direct a convention of about two hundred to issue an address to\r\nthe people of Connecticut, which address contains on the face of it many\r\npalpable falsehoods.--And cannot these same leaders controul a Court?\r\n\r\n4. Another part of the cost of these projects, is the loss of all our\r\ninstitutions of religion.--It is not here intended that these\r\ninstitutions will be at once abolished--Such a measure would alarm some\r\nhonest men of the party--a gradual but sure destruction is the evil to\r\nbe feared. The constitution of the United States was first attacked by\r\nan unconstitutional repeal of a law, and now the independence of the\r\nSupreme Court is to be destroyed, by impeachments of the judges. So will\r\nit fare with your institutions. The principle openly advocated is that\r\nnone shall be obliged to contribute for the support of religious\r\ninstitutions. This once established destroys the vitals of the system,\r\nand the residue of its existence will be misery and wretchedness. Shall\r\na party avowing this sentiment and seeking by every artifice to give it\r\neffect, receive the support of a people who have derived such\r\nsubstantial benefits from these institutions? Shall we look in vain\r\nthro' the ranks of that party for one to lift up his voice against this\r\ndaring and dangerous innovation? Are there not many who either do not\r\nbelieve this to be the object of their leaders, or if such shall be\r\ntheir object, who are determined to resist them? Yes, there are many who\r\nact with them, who still intend to progress to no such excesses. Let\r\nsuch view the conduct of similar parties--Let such not be deceived--This\r\nis indeed their object--They do not avow it to you, they know you would\r\nreject it, but they have made a vow that the influence of the Clergy\r\nshall be destroyed--this can be done in no other way. Nor can you resist\r\nthem--they regard you now because they wish your assistance to confer on\r\nthem power, but will they regard you when your exertions can neither aid\r\nnor defeat their designs?--surely not--such has been the conduct of all\r\nfactions.--It will be theirs should they prevail--The world has not\r\nfurnished one solitary exception, nor can you expect one in this case.\r\nThey seek their own good, and not the good of others, if inspiration is\r\nto be credited.\r\n\r\nIn return for these losses what good is to acrue to the people? Will you\r\nhazard these evils without a fair and reasonable expectation of some\r\nsolid benefits? Is it then unreasonable to enquire what good is to be\r\nobtained? Do the characters of these men elevate your hopes? You know\r\nmany of them in private life--do they there abound in good works? Shall\r\nthey be heard and regarded when they demand of you to displace your\r\nfaithful and approved rulers, and commit to them your all? Modest men\r\nwill wait your notice and rise at your request. Shall the impudent,\r\nbanish them from your affections and usurp their places in your hearts?\r\n\r\nLet it again be asked what good will result to Connecticut by a new\r\nConstitution, by the prevalence of revolutionary principles? France,\r\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands, Italy and Holland, have seen revolution\r\nafter revolution, one new Constitution after another, and liberty has a\r\nthousand times been immovably established. Altars have been demolished\r\n--Temples polluted, Kings, Queens, Nobles and Priests murdered in the\r\ncause of liberty--millions have perished--religion banished, and the\r\nworship of God prohibited--projectors have exhausted their ingenuity\r\n--the treasures of wealth have been wasted and the peace of the world\r\nsacrificed! What is the result? An accumulation of misery which baffles\r\nall description. Not an individual is more happy or more virtuous. Not a\r\nnation more prosperous--not a tittle added to human felicity. Ye\r\nreformers, look at France--behold the crimes which have risen up to\r\ndemand the vengeance of God--see the woes which you have brought on the\r\nrace of man, and tremble lest your works should follow you?\r\n\r\nIf this picture is too glaring, look at our sister states in which\r\nrevolutions have been effected, and shew us the benefit. A noisy or\r\nseditious individual has obtained a lucrative office--an ambitious\r\nleader is in the char of state satiating his pride, or like Abraham\r\nBishop gratifying his passion for ignoble pelf, upon his thousands.--He\r\ndrives his carriage by his industrious neighbor who has toiled for him\r\nat an election, cracks his whip, and laughs at the folly of his dupe,\r\nand will laugh till he may need his services again, and then he will\r\nagain cringe and bow and flatter and gull. But is the mechanic, the\r\nfarmer, the merchant profited? Is society enriched, or the public good\r\npromoted?\r\n\r\nIn this view of the subject we will briefly ask, in the third place, is\r\nit proper to make the proposed changes--to adopt these projects? If no\r\nbenefits will result--if much evil will probably ensue--the course of\r\nduty and interest is plain. Aware, however, that it may be said many of\r\nthe dangers are imaginary, and are founded upon the supposition that we\r\nshall act with as little discretion and prudence as the people of other\r\ncountries, it is important to observe that revolutions are the same, in\r\nnature in every nation. Those who speak of a new Constitution, and of\r\nthorough reforms, should recollect that the promoters of these schemes\r\nin France, constantly amused the people with the idea that a new order\r\nof things--new rights--new principles, were to arise. Who does not\r\nrecollect to have read of the perfectability human nature--of the\r\nenlightened age of regenerated France? She boldly proclaimed herself the\r\nexample of the world, and all nations were invited to see her glory, and\r\nenjoy her blessed liberty and her glorious equality. But mark the issue\r\n--Not twelve years have elapsed before she has returned to an inglorious\r\ndespotism--She has exchanged her Capets for a foreign usurper, with an\r\nincalculable loss, and here her history ends. Such is the constant\r\ntermination of such revolutions, and shall we claim to be an exception?\r\nHow do we judge as to the propriety of any course of life except by\r\nobservation, experience or history? We see industry and integrity\r\nrewarded with competence or wealth--we see intemperance and sloth\r\nfollowed with disease, loss of reputation and poverty. These are sure\r\ngrounds on which to predict respecting our neighbors, and by which to\r\nregulate our own conduct. On similar principles a wise people regard the\r\nconduct of other nations, and are solemnly admonished by their example.\r\nLet not then the projector persuade us to adopt his theories with proofs\r\nof their danger thus glaring before our eyes. Look at the conduct of our\r\nrevolutionists for four years past, and see if you do not discover the\r\ngenuine principles of the Jacobins of France--Recollect also that they\r\nhad first a Convention--then an Executive Directory--then a Consul for\r\nyears--then a Consul for life, and then an usurper with an hereditary\r\ndescent in his family. At each successive revolution the people were\r\ncourted--were flattered--were promised transcendent felicity. The people\r\nswore eternal hatred to Monarchy, and eternal fidelity to Constitutions,\r\ntill, heaven, weary of their perjuries, sent them a despot in his wrath.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens human nature is the same here as in France--Then\r\nbefore you give ear to the songs of enchantment Count the Cost--Before\r\nyou sell your birthright for a mess of pottage Count the Cost. Before\r\nyou consent to yield up the institutions of your wise and pious\r\nancestors, Count the Cost--Before you admit universal suffrage Count the\r\nCost--Before you submit to the mischievous doctrine of district\r\nelections, Count the Cost.--Before you reject from office the men whom\r\nyour hearts approve, Count the Cost, the great cost of weak and wicked\r\nrulers.--Before you consent to be governed by men whose impudence, and\r\nvice constitute many of their claims to promotion, Count the Cost. This\r\nevil you can prevent by attending with punctuality on our elections. The\r\nfreemen of Connecticut are mighty when they arise in their strength. No\r\nfreeman can justify absence except from necessity.--That people who will\r\nnot faithfully attend upon the Choice of their rulers, cannot expect to\r\nretain their freedom.--Trust not to a majority--say not that things will\r\ngo well without me--Such language is unbecoming freemen--Despair not of\r\na majority--if you will not \"go with the multitude to do evil,\" go\r\nagainst them to do good. Before you neglect an election Count the Cost\r\n--If the loss of your Vote should prove the loss of an election of a\r\nsingle man, then will you not have Counted the Cost.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens--WE have a government which has protected us a\r\nCentury and an half--we have enjoyed unexampled prosperity.--WE may\r\ntransmit a glorious inheritance to posterity.--The writer has children\r\ndear to him as his own blood--these children are to him a sacred\r\ndeposit--He can, with confidence, commit their political interests to\r\nsuch a government as Connecticut has enjoyed.--He is persuaded that if\r\nthey feel the iron hand of despotism, it will not be from such a\r\ngovernment, and such rulers as we now possess--Before he yields his own,\r\nand their dear, and inestimable rights to the wild projects of the\r\nreformers of this age, he is firmly resolved to sit down and Count the\r\nCost, and he entreats his fellow citizens to adopt similar resolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nA View of the Fiscal Concerns of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Funds of the Civil List.\r\n                                              Dols.
