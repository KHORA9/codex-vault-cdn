INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OUTSIDE AND THE PICTURES\r\nIN OUR HEADS\r\n\r\nThere is an island in the ocean where in 1914 a few Englishmen,\r\nFrenchmen, and Germans lived. No cable reaches that island, and the\r\nBritish mail steamer comes but once in sixty days. In September it had\r\nnot yet come, and the islanders were still talking about the latest\r\nnewspaper which told about the approaching trial of Madame Caillaux\r\nfor the shooting of Gaston Calmette. It was, therefore, with more than\r\nusual eagerness that the whole colony assembled at the quay on a day\r\nin mid-September to hear from the captain what the verdict had been.\r\nThey learned that for over six weeks now those of them who were\r\nEnglish and those of them who were French had been fighting in behalf\r\nof the sanctity of treaties against those of them who were Germans.\r\nFor six strange weeks they had acted as if they were friends, when in\r\nfact they were enemies.\r\n\r\nBut their plight was not so different from that of most of the\r\npopulation of Europe. They had been mistaken for six weeks, on the\r\ncontinent the interval may have been only six days or six hours. There\r\nwas an interval. There was a moment when the picture of Europe on\r\nwhich men were conducting their business as usual, did not in any way\r\ncorrespond to the Europe which was about to make a jumble of their\r\nlives. There was a time for each man when he was still adjusted to an\r\nenvironment that no longer existed. All over the world as late as July\r\n25th men were making goods that they would not be able to ship, buying\r\ngoods they would not be able to import, careers were being planned,\r\nenterprises contemplated, hopes and expectations entertained, all in\r\nthe belief that the world as known was the world as it was. Men were\r\nwriting books describing that world. They trusted the picture in their\r\nheads. And then over four years later, on a Thursday morning, came the\r\nnews of an armistice, and people gave vent to their unutterable relief\r\nthat the slaughter was over. Yet in the five days before the real\r\narmistice came, though the end of the war had been celebrated, several\r\nthousand young men died on the battlefields.\r\n\r\nLooking back we can see how indirectly we know the environment in\r\nwhich nevertheless we live. We can see that the news of it comes to us\r\nnow fast, now slowly; but that whatever we believe to be a true\r\npicture, we treat as if it were the environment itself. It is harder\r\nto remember that about the beliefs upon which we are now acting, but\r\nin respect to other peoples and other ages we flatter ourselves that\r\nit is easy to see when they were in deadly earnest about ludicrous\r\npictures of the world. We insist, because of our superior hindsight,\r\nthat the world as they needed to know it, and the world as they did\r\nknow it, were often two quite contradictory things. We can see, too,\r\nthat while they governed and fought, traded and reformed in the world\r\nas they imagined it to be, they produced results, or failed to produce\r\nany, in the world as it was. They started for the Indies and found\r\nAmerica. They diagnosed evil and hanged old women. They thought they\r\ncould grow rich by always selling and never buying. A caliph, obeying\r\nwhat he conceived to be the Will of Allah, burned the library at\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nWriting about the year 389, St. Ambrose stated the case for the\r\nprisoner in Plato's cave who resolutely declines to turn his head. \"To\r\ndiscuss the nature and position of the earth does not help us in our\r\nhope of the life to come. It is enough to know what Scripture states.\r\n'That He hung up the earth upon nothing' (Job xxvi. 7). Why then argue\r\nwhether He hung it up in air or upon the water, and raise a\r\ncontroversy as to how the thin air could sustain the earth; or why, if\r\nupon the waters, the earth does not go crashing down to the bottom?...\r\nNot because the earth is in the middle, as if suspended on even\r\nbalance, but because the majesty of God constrains it by the law of\r\nHis will, does it endure stable upon the unstable and the void.\"\r\n[Footnote: Hexaemeron, i. cap 6, quoted in _The Mediæval Mind_,\r\nby Henry Osborn Taylor, Vol. i, p. 73.]\r\n\r\nIt does not help us in our hope of the life to come. It is enough to\r\nknow what Scripture states. Why then argue? But a century and a half\r\nafter St. Ambrose, opinion was still troubled, on this occasion by the\r\nproblem of the antipodes. A monk named Cosmas, famous for his\r\nscientific attainments, was therefore deputed to write a Christian\r\nTopography, or \"Christian Opinion concerning the World.\" [Footnote:\r\nLecky, _Rationalism in Europe_, Vol. I, pp. 276-8.] It is clear\r\nthat he knew exactly what was expected of him, for he based all his\r\nconclusions on the Scriptures as he read them. It appears, then, that\r\nthe world is a flat parallelogram, twice as broad from east to west as\r\nit is long from north to south., In the center is the earth surrounded\r\nby ocean, which is in turn surrounded by another earth, where men\r\nlived before the deluge. This other earth was Noah's port of\r\nembarkation. In the north is a high conical mountain around which\r\nrevolve the sun and moon. When the sun is behind the mountain it is\r\nnight. The sky is glued to the edges of the outer earth. It consists\r\nof four high walls which meet in a concave roof, so that the earth is\r\nthe floor of the universe. There is an ocean on the other side of the\r\nsky, constituting the \"waters that are above the firmament.\" The space\r\nbetween the celestial ocean and the ultimate roof of the universe\r\nbelongs to the blest. The space between the earth and sky is inhabited\r\nby the angels. Finally, since St. Paul said that all men are made to\r\nlive upon the \"face of the earth\" how could they live on the back\r\nwhere the Antipodes are supposed to be? With such a passage before\r\nhis eyes, a Christian, we are told, should not 'even speak of the\r\nAntipodes.'\" [Footnote: _Id._]\r\n\r\nFar less should he go to the Antipodes; nor should any Christian\r\nprince give him a ship to try; nor would any pious mariner wish to\r\ntry. For Cosmas there was nothing in the least absurd about his map.\r\nOnly by remembering his absolute conviction that this was the map of\r\nthe universe can we begin to understand how he would have dreaded\r\nMagellan or Peary or the aviator who risked a collision with the\r\nangels and the vault of heaven by flying seven miles up in the air. In\r\nthe same way we can best understand the furies of war and politics by\r\nremembering that almost the whole of each party believes absolutely in\r\nits picture of the opposition, that it takes as fact, not what is, but\r\nwhat it supposes to be the fact. And that therefore, like Hamlet, it\r\nwill stab Polonius behind the rustling curtain, thinking him the king,\r\nand perhaps like Hamlet add:\r\n\r\n  \"Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!\r\n  I took thee for thy better; take thy fortune.\"\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nGreat men, even during their lifetime, are usually known to the public\r\nonly through a fictitious personality. Hence the modicum of truth in\r\nthe old saying that no man is a hero to his valet. There is only a\r\nmodicum of truth, for the valet, and the private secretary, are often\r\nimmersed in the fiction themselves. Royal personages are, of course,\r\nconstructed personalities. Whether they themselves believe in their\r\npublic character, or whether they merely permit the chamberlain to\r\nstage-manage it, there are at least two distinct selves, the public\r\nand regal self, the private and human. The biographies of great people\r\nfall more or less readily into the histories of these two selves. The\r\nofficial biographer reproduces the public life, the revealing memoir\r\nthe other. The Charnwood Lincoln, for example, is a noble portrait,\r\nnot of an actual human being, but of an epic figure, replete with\r\nsignificance, who moves on much the same level of reality as Aeneas or\r\nSt. George. Oliver's Hamilton is a majestic abstraction, the sculpture\r\nof an idea, \"an essay\" as Mr. Oliver himself calls it, \"on American\r\nunion.\" It is a formal monument to the state-craft of federalism,\r\nhardly the biography of a person. Sometimes people create their own\r\nfacade when they think they are revealing the interior scene. The\r\nRepington diaries and Margot Asquith's are a species of\r\nself-portraiture in which the intimate detail is most revealing as an\r\nindex of how the authors like to think about themselves.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting kind of portraiture is that which arises\r\nspontaneously in people's minds. When Victoria came to the throne,\r\nsays Mr. Strachey, [Footnote: Lytton Strachey, _Queen Victoria_,\r\np. 72.] \"among the outside public there was a great wave of\r\nenthusiasm. Sentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the\r\nspectacle of the little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair\r\nand pink cheeks, driving through her capital, filled the hearts of the\r\nbeholders with raptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all,\r\nstruck everybody with overwhelming force was the contrast between\r\nQueen Victoria and her uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and\r\nselfish, pigheaded and ridiculous, with their perpetual burden of\r\ndebts, confusions, and disreputabilities--they had vanished like the\r\nsnows of winter and here at last, crowned and radiant, was the\r\nspring.\"\r\n\r\nM. Jean de Pierrefeu [Footnote: Jean de Pierrefeu, _G. Q. G. Trois\r\nans au Grand Quartier General_, pp 94-95.] saw hero-worship at\r\nfirst hand, for he was an officer on Joffre's staff at the moment of\r\nthat soldier's greatest fame:\r\n\r\n\"For two years, the entire world paid an almost divine homage to the\r\nvictor of the Marne. The baggage-master literally bent under the\r\nweight of the boxes, of the packages and letters which unknown people\r\nsent him with a frantic testimonial of their admiration. I think that\r\noutside of General Joffre, no commander in the war has been able to\r\nrealize a comparable idea of what glory is. They sent him boxes of\r\ncandy from all the great confectioners of the world, boxes of\r\nchampagne, fine wines of every vintage, fruits, game, ornaments and\r\nutensils, clothes, smoking materials, inkstands, paperweights. Every\r\nterritory sent its specialty. The painter sent his picture, the\r\nsculptor his statuette, the dear old lady a comforter or socks, the\r\nshepherd in his hut carved a pipe for his sake. All the manufacturers\r\nof the world who were hostile to Germany shipped their products,\r\nHavana its cigars, Portugal its port wine. I have known a hairdresser\r\nwho had nothing better to do than to make a portrait of the General\r\nout of hair belonging to persons who were dear to him; a professional\r\npenman had the same idea, but the features were composed of thousands\r\nof little phrases in tiny characters which sang the praise of the\r\nGeneral. As to letters, he had them in all scripts, from all\r\ncountries, written in every dialect, affectionate letters, grateful,\r\noverflowing with love, filled with adoration. They called him Savior\r\nof the World, Father of his Country, Agent of God, Benefactor of\r\nHumanity, etc.... And not only Frenchmen, but Americans, Argentinians,\r\nAustralians, etc. etc.... Thousands of little children, without their\r\nparents' knowledge, took pen in hand and wrote to tell him their love:\r\nmost of them called him Our Father. And there was poignancy about\r\ntheir effusions, their adoration, these sighs of deliverance that\r\nescaped from thousands of hearts at the defeat of barbarism. To all\r\nthese naif little souls, Joffre seemed like St. George crushing the\r\ndragon. Certainly he incarnated for the conscience of mankind the\r\nvictory of good over evil, of light over darkness.\r\n\r\nLunatics, simpletons, the half-crazy and the crazy turned their\r\ndarkened brains toward him as toward reason itself. I have read the\r\nletter of a person living in Sydney, who begged the General to save\r\nhim from his enemies; another, a New Zealander, requested him to send\r\nsome soldiers to the house of a gentleman who owed him ten pounds and\r\nwould not pay.\r\n\r\nFinally, some hundreds of young girls, overcoming the timidity of\r\ntheir sex, asked for engagements, their families not to know about it;\r\nothers wished only to serve him.\"\r\n\r\nThis ideal Joffre was compounded out of the victory won by him, his\r\nstaff and his troops, the despair of the war, the personal sorrows,\r\nand the hope of future victory. But beside hero-worship there is the\r\nexorcism of devils. By the same mechanism through which heroes are\r\nincarnated, devils are made. If everything good was to come from\r\nJoffre, Foch, Wilson, or Roosevelt, everything evil originated in the\r\nKaiser Wilhelm, Lenin and Trotsky. They were as omnipotent for evil as\r\nthe heroes were omnipotent for good. To many simple and frightened\r\nminds there was no political reverse, no strike, no obstruction, no\r\nmysterious death or mysterious conflagration anywhere in the world of\r\nwhich the causes did not wind back to these personal sources of evil.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWorldwide concentration of this kind on a symbolic personality is rare\r\nenough to be clearly remarkable, and every author has a weakness for\r\nthe striking and irrefutable example. The vivisection of war reveals\r\nsuch examples, but it does not make them out of nothing. In a more\r\nnormal public life, symbolic pictures are no less governant of\r\nbehavior, but each symbol is far less inclusive because there are so\r\nmany competing ones. Not only is each symbol charged with less feeling\r\nbecause at most it represents only a part of the population, but even\r\nwithin that part there is infinitely less suppression of individual\r\ndifference. The symbols of public opinion, in times of moderate\r\nsecurity, are subject to check and comparison and argument. They come\r\nand go, coalesce and are forgotten, never organizing perfectly the\r\nemotion of the whole group. There is, after all, just one human\r\nactivity left in which whole populations accomplish the union sacrée.\r\nIt occurs in those middle phases of a war when fear, pugnacity, and\r\nhatred have secured complete dominion of the spirit, either to crush\r\nevery other instinct or to enlist it, and before weariness is felt.\r\n\r\nAt almost all other times, and even in war when it is deadlocked, a\r\nsufficiently greater range of feelings is aroused to establish\r\nconflict, choice, hesitation, and compromise. The symbolism of public\r\nopinion usually bears, as we shall see, [Footnote: Part V.] the marks\r\nof this balancing of interest. Think, for example, of how rapidly,\r\nafter the armistice, the precarious and by no means successfully\r\nestablished symbol of Allied Unity disappeared, how it was followed\r\nalmost immediately by the breakdown of each nation's symbolic picture\r\nof the other: Britain the Defender of Public Law, France watching at\r\nthe Frontier of Freedom, America the Crusader. And think then of how\r\nwithin each nation the symbolic picture of itself frayed out, as party\r\nand class conflict and personal ambition began to stir postponed\r\nissues. And then of how the symbolic pictures of the leaders gave way,\r\nas one by one, Wilson, Clemenceau, Lloyd George, ceased to be the\r\nincarnation of human hope, and became merely the negotiators and\r\nadministrators for a disillusioned world.\r\n\r\nWhether we regret this as one of the soft evils of peace or applaud it\r\nas a return to sanity is obviously no matter here. Our first concern\r\nwith fictions and symbols is to forget their value to the existing\r\nsocial order, and to think of them simply as an important part of the\r\nmachinery of human communication. Now in any society that is not\r\ncompletely self-contained in its interests and so small that everyone\r\ncan know all about everything that happens, ideas deal with events\r\nthat are out of sight and hard to grasp. Miss Sherwin of Gopher\r\nPrairie, [Footnote: See Sinclair Lewis, _Main Street_.] is aware\r\nthat a war is raging in France and tries to conceive it. She has never\r\nbeen to France, and certainly she has never been along what is now the\r\nbattlefront.\r\n\r\nPictures of French and German soldiers she has seen, but it is\r\nimpossible for her to imagine three million men. No one, in fact, can\r\nimagine them, and the professionals do not try. They think of them as,\r\nsay, two hundred divisions. But Miss Sherwin has no access to the\r\norder of battle maps, and so if she is to think about the war, she\r\nfastens upon Joffre and the Kaiser as if they were engaged in a\r\npersonal duel. Perhaps if you could see what she sees with her mind's\r\neye, the image in its composition might be not unlike an Eighteenth\r\nCentury engraving of a great soldier. He stands there boldly unruffled\r\nand more than life size, with a shadowy army of tiny little figures\r\nwinding off into the landscape behind. Nor it seems are great men\r\noblivious to these expectations. M. de Pierrefeu tells of a\r\nphotographer's visit to Joffre. The General was in his \"middle class\r\noffice, before the worktable without papers, where he sat down to\r\nwrite his signature. Suddenly it was noticed that there were no maps\r\non the walls. But since according to popular ideas it is not possible\r\nto think of a general without maps, a few were placed in position for\r\nthe picture, and removed soon afterwards.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._,\r\np. 99.]\r\n\r\nThe only feeling that anyone can have about an event he does not\r\nexperience is the feeling aroused by his mental image of that event.\r\nThat is why until we know what others think they know, we cannot truly\r\nunderstand their acts. I have seen a young girl, brought up in a\r\nPennsylvania mining town, plunged suddenly from entire cheerfulness\r\ninto a paroxysm of grief when a gust of wind cracked the kitchen\r\nwindow-pane. For hours she was inconsolable, and to me incomprehensible.\r\nBut when she was able to talk, it transpired that if a window-pane\r\nbroke it meant that a close relative had died. She was, therefore,\r\nmourning for her father, who had frightened her into running away\r\nfrom home. The father was, of course, quite thoroughly alive as a\r\ntelegraphic inquiry soon proved. But until the telegram came, the\r\ncracked glass was an authentic message to that girl. Why it was\r\nauthentic only a prolonged investigation by a skilled psychiatrist\r\ncould show. But even the most casual observer could see that the girl,\r\nenormously upset by her family troubles, had hallucinated a complete\r\nfiction out of one external fact, a remembered superstition, and a\r\nturmoil of remorse, and fear and love for her father.\r\n\r\nAbnormality in these instances is only a matter of degree. When an\r\nAttorney-General, who has been frightened by a bomb exploded on his\r\ndoorstep, convinces himself by the reading of revolutionary literature\r\nthat a revolution is to happen on the first of May 1920, we recognize\r\nthat much the same mechanism is at work. The war, of course, furnished\r\nmany examples of this pattern: the casual fact, the creative\r\nimagination, the will to believe, and out of these three elements, a\r\ncounterfeit of reality to which there was a violent instinctive\r\nresponse. For it is clear enough that under certain conditions men\r\nrespond as powerfully to fictions as they do to realities, and that in\r\nmany cases they help to create the very fictions to which they\r\nrespond. Let him cast the first stone who did not believe in the\r\nRussian army that passed through England in August, 1914, did not\r\naccept any tale of atrocities without direct proof, and never saw a\r\nplot, a traitor, or a spy where there was none. Let him cast a stone\r\nwho never passed on as the real inside truth what he had heard someone\r\nsay who knew no more than he did.\r\n\r\nIn all these instances we must note particularly one common factor. It\r\nis the insertion between man and his environment of a pseudo-environment.\r\nTo that pseudo-environment his behavior is a response. But because it\r\n_is_ behavior, the consequences, if they are acts, operate not in\r\nthe pseudo-environment where the behavior is stimulated, but in the\r\nreal environment where action eventuates. If the behavior is not a\r\npractical act, but what we call roughly thought and emotion, it may\r\nbe a long time before there is any noticeable break in the texture of\r\nthe fictitious world. But when the stimulus of the pseudo-fact results\r\nin action on things or other people, contradiction soon develops.\r\nThen comes the sensation of butting one's head against a stone wall,\r\nof learning by experience, and witnessing Herbert Spencer's tragedy\r\nof the murder of a Beautiful Theory by a Gang of Brutal Facts, the\r\ndiscomfort in short of a maladjustment. For certainly, at the level of\r\nsocial life, what is called the adjustment of man to his environment\r\ntakes place through the medium of fictions.\r\n\r\nBy fictions I do not mean lies. I mean a representation of the\r\nenvironment which is in lesser or greater degree made by man himself.\r\nThe range of fiction extends all the way from complete hallucination\r\nto the scientists' perfectly self-conscious use of a schematic model,\r\nor his decision that for his particular problem accuracy beyond a\r\ncertain number of decimal places is not important. A work of fiction\r\nmay have almost any degree of fidelity, and so long as the degree of\r\nfidelity can be taken into account, fiction is not misleading. In\r\nfact, human culture is very largely the selection, the rearrangement,\r\nthe tracing of patterns upon, and the stylizing of, what William James\r\ncalled \"the random irradiations and resettlements of our\r\nideas.\" [Footnote: James, _Principles of Psychology_, Vol. II, p.\r\n638] The alternative to the use of fictions is direct exposure to the\r\nebb and flow of sensation. That is not a real alternative, for however\r\nrefreshing it is to see at times with a perfectly innocent eye,\r\ninnocence itself is not wisdom, though a source and corrective of\r\nwisdom. For the real environment is altogether too big, too complex,\r\nand too fleeting for direct acquaintance. We are not equipped to deal\r\nwith so much subtlety, so much variety, so many permutations and\r\ncombinations. And although we have to act in that environment, we have\r\nto reconstruct it on a simpler model before we can manage with it. To\r\ntraverse the world men must have maps of the world. Their persistent\r\ndifficulty is to secure maps on which their own need, or someone\r\nelse's need, has not sketched in the coast of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe analyst of public opinion must begin then, by recognizing the\r\ntriangular relationship between the scene of action, the human picture\r\nof that scene, and the human response to that picture working itself\r\nout upon the scene of action. It is like a play suggested to the\r\nactors by their own experience, in which the plot is transacted in the\r\nreal lives of the actors, and not merely in their stage parts. The\r\nmoving picture often emphasizes with great skill this double drama of\r\ninterior motive and external behavior. Two men are quarreling,\r\nostensibly about some money, but their passion is inexplicable. Then\r\nthe picture fades out and what one or the other of the two men sees\r\nwith his mind's eye is reënacted. Across the table they were\r\nquarreling about money. In memory they are back in their youth when\r\nthe girl jilted him for the other man. The exterior drama is\r\nexplained: the hero is not greedy; the hero is in love.\r\n\r\nA scene not so different was played in the United States Senate. At\r\nbreakfast on the morning of September 29, 1919, some of the Senators\r\nread a news dispatch in the _Washington Post_ about the landing\r\nof American marines on the Dalmatian coast. The newspaper said:\r\n\r\nFACTS NOW ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\n\"The following important facts appear already _established_. The\r\norders to Rear Admiral Andrews commanding the American naval forces in\r\nthe Adriatic, came from the British Admiralty via the War Council and\r\nRear Admiral Knapps in London. The approval or disapproval of the\r\nAmerican Navy Department was not asked....\r\n\r\nWITHOUT DANIELS' KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Daniels was admittedly placed in a peculiar position when cables\r\nreached here stating that the forces over which he is presumed to have\r\nexclusive control were carrying on what amounted to naval warfare\r\nwithout his knowledge. It was fully realized that the _British\r\nAdmiralty might desire to issue orders to Rear Admiral Andrews_ to\r\nact on behalf of Great Britain and her Allies, because the situation\r\nrequired sacrifice on the part of some nation if D'Annunzio's\r\nfollowers were to be held in check.\r\n\r\n\"It was further realized that _under the new league of nations plan\r\nforeigners would be in a position to direct American Naval forces in\r\nemergencies_ with or without the consent of the American Navy\r\nDepartment....\" etc. (Italics mine).\r\n\r\nThe first Senator to comment is Mr. Knox of Pennsylvania. Indignantly\r\nhe demands investigation. In Mr. Brandegee of Connecticut, who spoke\r\nnext, indignation has already stimulated credulity. Where Mr. Knox\r\nindignantly wishes to know if the report is true, Mr. Brandegee, a\r\nhalf a minute later, would like to know what would have happened if\r\nmarines had been killed. Mr. Knox, interested in the question, forgets\r\nthat he asked for an inquiry, and replies. If American marines had\r\nbeen killed, it would be war. The mood of the debate is still\r\nconditional. Debate proceeds. Mr. McCormick of Illinois reminds the\r\nSenate that the Wilson administration is prone to the waging of small\r\nunauthorized wars. He repeats Theodore Roosevelt's quip about \"waging\r\npeace.\" More debate. Mr. Brandegee notes that the marines acted \"under\r\norders of a Supreme Council sitting somewhere,\" but he cannot recall\r\nwho represents the United States on that body. The Supreme Council is\r\nunknown to the Constitution of the United States. Therefore Mr. New of\r\nIndiana submits a resolution calling for the facts.\r\n\r\nSo far the Senators still recognize vaguely that they are discussing a\r\nrumor. Being lawyers they still remember some of the forms of\r\nevidence. But as red-blooded men they already experience all the\r\nindignation which is appropriate to the fact that American marines\r\nhave been ordered into war by a foreign government and without the\r\nconsent of Congress. Emotionally they want to believe it, because they\r\nare Republicans fighting the League of Nations. This arouses the\r\nDemocratic leader, Mr. Hitchcock of Nebraska. He defends the Supreme\r\nCouncil: it was acting under the war powers. Peace has not yet been\r\nconcluded because the Republicans are delaying it. Therefore the\r\naction was necessary and legal. Both sides now assume that the report\r\nis true, and the conclusions they draw are the conclusions of their\r\npartisanship. Yet this extraordinary assumption is in a debate over a\r\nresolution to investigate the truth of the assumption. It reveals how\r\ndifficult it is, even for trained lawyers, to suspend response until\r\nthe returns are in. The response is instantaneous. The fiction is\r\ntaken for truth because the fiction is badly needed.\r\n\r\nA few days later an official report showed that the marines were not\r\nlanded by order of the British Government or of the Supreme Council.\r\nThey had not been fighting the Italians. They had been landed at the\r\nrequest of the Italian Government to protect Italians, and the\r\nAmerican commander had been officially thanked by the Italian\r\nauthorities. The marines were not at war with Italy. They had acted\r\naccording to an established international practice which had nothing\r\nto do with the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe scene of action was the Adriatic. The picture of that scene in the\r\nSenators' heads at Washington was furnished, in this case probably\r\nwith intent to deceive, by a man who cared nothing about the Adriatic,\r\nbut much about defeating the League. To this picture the Senate\r\nresponded by a strengthening of its partisan differences over the\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nWhether in this particular case the Senate was above or below its\r\nnormal standard, it is not necessary to decide. Nor whether the Senate\r\ncompares favorably with the House, or with other parliaments. At the\r\nmoment, I should like to think only about the world-wide spectacle of\r\nmen acting upon their environment, moved by stimuli from their\r\npseudo-environments. For when full allowance has been made for\r\ndeliberate fraud, political science has still to account for such\r\nfacts as two nations attacking one another, each convinced that it is\r\nacting in self-defense, or two classes at war each certain that it\r\nspeaks for the common interest. They live, we are likely to say, in\r\ndifferent worlds. More accurately, they live in the same world, but\r\nthey think and feel in different ones.\r\n\r\nIt is to these special worlds, it is to these private or group, or\r\nclass, or provincial, or occupational, or national, or sectarian\r\nartifacts, that the political adjustment of mankind in the Great\r\nSociety takes place. Their variety and complication are impossible to\r\ndescribe. Yet these fictions determine a very great part of men's\r\npolitical behavior. We must think of perhaps fifty sovereign\r\nparliaments consisting of at least a hundred legislative bodies. With\r\nthem belong at least fifty hierarchies of provincial and municipal\r\nassemblies, which with their executive, administrative and legislative\r\norgans, constitute formal authority on earth. But that does not begin\r\nto reveal the complexity of political life. For in each of these\r\ninnumerable centers of authority there are parties, and these parties\r\nare themselves hierarchies with their roots in classes, sections,\r\ncliques and clans; and within these are the individual politicians,\r\neach the personal center of a web of connection and memory and fear\r\nand hope.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other, for reasons often necessarily obscure, as the result\r\nof domination or compromise or a logroll, there emerge from these\r\npolitical bodies commands, which set armies in motion or make peace,\r\nconscript life, tax, exile, imprison, protect property or confiscate\r\nit, encourage one kind of enterprise and discourage another,\r\nfacilitate immigration or obstruct it, improve communication or censor\r\nit, establish schools, build navies, proclaim \"policies,\" and\r\n\"destiny,\" raise economic barriers, make property or unmake it, bring\r\none people under the rule of another, or favor one class as against\r\nanother. For each of these decisions some view of the facts is taken\r\nto be conclusive, some view of the circumstances is accepted as the\r\nbasis of inference and as the stimulus of feeling. What view of the\r\nfacts, and why that one?\r\n\r\nAnd yet even this does not begin to exhaust the real complexity. The\r\nformal political structure exists in a social environment, where there\r\nare innumerable large and small corporations and institutions,\r\nvoluntary and semi-voluntary associations, national, provincial, urban\r\nand neighborhood groupings, which often as not make the decision that\r\nthe political body registers. On what are these decisions based?\r\n\r\n\"Modern society,\" says Mr. Chesterton, \"is intrinsically insecure\r\nbecause it is based on the notion that all men will do the same thing\r\nfor different reasons.... And as within the head of any convict may be\r\nthe hell of a quite solitary crime, so in the house or under the hat\r\nof any suburban clerk may be the limbo of a quite separate philosophy.\r\nThe first man may be a complete Materialist and feel his own body as a\r\nhorrible machine manufacturing his own mind. He may listen to his\r\nthoughts as to the dull ticking of a clock. The man next door may be a\r\nChristian Scientist and regard his own body as somehow rather less\r\nsubstantial than his own shadow. He may come almost to regard his own\r\narms and legs as delusions like moving serpents in the dream of\r\ndelirium tremens. The third man in the street may not be a Christian\r\nScientist but, on the contrary, a Christian. He may live in a fairy\r\ntale as his neighbors would say; a secret but solid fairy tale full of\r\nthe faces and presences of unearthly friends. The fourth man may be a\r\ntheosophist, and only too probably a vegetarian; and I do not see why\r\nI should not gratify myself with the fancy that the fifth man is a\r\ndevil worshiper.... Now whether or not this sort of variety is\r\nvaluable, this sort of unity is shaky. To expect that all men for all\r\ntime will go on thinking different things, and yet doing the same\r\nthings, is a doubtful speculation. It is not founding society on a\r\ncommunion, or even on a convention, but rather on a coincidence. Four\r\nmen may meet under the same lamp post; one to paint it pea green as\r\npart of a great municipal reform; one to read his breviary in the\r\nlight of it; one to embrace it with accidental ardour in a fit of\r\nalcoholic enthusiasm; and the last merely because the pea green post\r\nis a conspicuous point of rendezvous with his young lady. But to\r\nexpect this to happen night after night is unwise....\" [Footnote: G.\r\nK. Chesterton, \"The Mad Hatter and the Sane Householder,\" _Vanity\r\nFair_, January, 1921, p. 54]\r\n\r\nFor the four men at the lamp post substitute the governments, the\r\nparties, the corporations, the societies, the social sets, the trades\r\nand professions, universities, sects, and nationalities of the world.\r\nThink of the legislator voting a statute that will affect distant\r\npeoples, a statesman coming to a decision. Think of the Peace\r\nConference reconstituting the frontiers of Europe, an ambassador in a\r\nforeign country trying to discern the intentions of his own government\r\nand of the foreign government, a promoter working a concession in a\r\nbackward country, an editor demanding a war, a clergyman calling on\r\nthe police to regulate amusement, a club lounging-room making up its\r\nmind about a strike, a sewing circle preparing to regulate the\r\nschools, nine judges deciding whether a legislature in Oregon may fix\r\nthe working hours of women, a cabinet meeting to decide on the\r\nrecognition of a government, a party convention choosing a candidate\r\nand writing a platform, twenty-seven million voters casting their\r\nballots, an Irishman in Cork thinking about an Irishman in Belfast, a\r\nThird International planning to reconstruct the whole of human\r\nsociety, a board of directors confronted with a set of their\r\nemployees' demands, a boy choosing a career, a merchant estimating\r\nsupply and demand for the coming season, a speculator predicting the\r\ncourse of the market, a banker deciding whether to put credit behind a\r\nnew enterprise, the advertiser, the reader of advertisments.... Think\r\nof the different sorts of Americans thinking about their notions of\r\n\"The British Empire\" or \"France\" or \"Russia\" or \"Mexico.\" It is not so\r\ndifferent from Mr. Chesterton's four men at the pea green lamp post.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nAnd so before we involve ourselves in the jungle of obscurities about\r\nthe innate differences of men, we shall do well to fix our attention\r\nupon the extraordinary differences in what men know of the world.\r\n[Footnote: _Cf_. Wallas, _Our Social Heritage_, pp. 77 _et seq_.]\r\nI do not doubt that there are important biological differences. Since\r\nman is an animal it would be strange if there were not. But as\r\nrational beings it is worse than shallow to generalize at all\r\nabout comparative behavior until there is a measurable similarity\r\nbetween the environments to which behavior is a response.\r\n\r\nThe pragmatic value of this idea is that it introduces a much needed\r\nrefinement into the ancient controversy about nature and nurture,\r\ninnate quality and environment. For the pseudo-environment is a hybrid\r\ncompounded of \"human nature\" and \"conditions.\" To my mind it shows the\r\nuselessness of pontificating about what man is and always will be from\r\nwhat we observe man to be doing, or about what are the necessary\r\nconditions of society. For we do not know how men would behave in\r\nresponse to the facts of the Great Society. All that we really know is\r\nhow they behave in response to what can fairly be called a most\r\ninadequate picture of the Great Society. No conclusion about man or\r\nthe Great Society can honestly be made on evidence like that.\r\n\r\nThis, then, will be the clue to our inquiry. We shall assume that what\r\neach man does is based not on direct and certain knowledge, but on\r\npictures made by himself or given to him. If his atlas tells him that\r\nthe world is flat he will not sail near what he believes to be the\r\nedge of our planet for fear of falling off. If his maps include a\r\nfountain of eternal youth, a Ponce de Leon will go in quest of it. If\r\nsomeone digs up yellow dirt that looks like gold, he will for a time\r\nact exactly as if he had found gold. The way in which the world is\r\nimagined determines at any particular moment what men will do. It does\r\nnot determine what they will achieve. It determines their effort,\r\ntheir feelings, their hopes, not their accomplishments and results.\r\nThe very men who most loudly proclaim their \"materialism\" and their\r\ncontempt for \"ideologues,\" the Marxian communists, place their entire\r\nhope on what? On the formation by propaganda of a class-conscious\r\ngroup. But what is propaganda, if not the effort to alter the picture\r\nto which men respond, to substitute one social pattern for another?\r\nWhat is class consciousness but a way of realizing the world? National\r\nconsciousness but another way? And Professor Giddings' consciousness\r\nof kind, but a process of believing that we recognize among the\r\nmultitude certain ones marked as our kind?\r\n\r\nTry to explain social life as the pursuit of pleasure and the\r\navoidance of pain. You will soon be saying that the hedonist begs the\r\nquestion, for even supposing that man does pursue these ends, the\r\ncrucial problem of why he thinks one course rather than another likely\r\nto produce pleasure, is untouched. Does the guidance of man's\r\nconscience explain? How then does he happen to have the particular\r\nconscience which he has? The theory of economic self-interest? But how\r\ndo men come to conceive their interest in one way rather than another?\r\nThe desire for security, or prestige, or domination, or what is\r\nvaguely called self-realization? How do men conceive their security,\r\nwhat do they consider prestige, how do they figure out the means of\r\ndomination, or what is the notion of self which they wish to realize?\r\nPleasure, pain, conscience, acquisition, protection, enhancement,\r\nmastery, are undoubtedly names for some of the ways people act. There\r\nmay be instinctive dispositions which work toward such ends. But no\r\nstatement of the end, or any description of the tendencies to seek it,\r\ncan explain the behavior which results. The very fact that men\r\ntheorize at all is proof that their pseudo-environments, their\r\ninterior representations of the world, are a determining element in\r\nthought, feeling, and action. For if the connection between reality\r\nand human response were direct and immediate, rather than indirect and\r\ninferred, indecision and failure would be unknown, and (if each of us\r\nfitted as snugly into the world as the child in the womb), Mr. Bernard\r\nShaw would not have been able to say that except for the first nine\r\nmonths of its existence no human being manages its affairs as well as\r\na plant.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in adapting the psychoanalytic scheme to\r\npolitical thought arises in this connection. The Freudians are\r\nconcerned with the maladjustment of distinct individuals to other\r\nindividuals and to concrete circumstances. They have assumed that if\r\ninternal derangements could be straightened out, there would be little\r\nor no confusion about what is the obviously normal relationship. But\r\npublic opinion deals with indirect, unseen, and puzzling facts, and\r\nthere is nothing obvious about them. The situations to which public\r\nopinions refer are known only as opinions. The psychoanalyst, on the\r\nother hand, almost always assumes that the environment is knowable,\r\nand if not knowable then at least bearable, to any unclouded\r\nintelligence. This assumption of his is the problem of public opinion.\r\nInstead of taking for granted an environment that is readily known,\r\nthe social analyst is most concerned in studying how the larger\r\npolitical environment is conceived, and how it can be conceived more\r\nsuccessfully. The psychoanalyst examines the adjustment to an X,\r\ncalled by him the environment; the social analyst examines the X,\r\ncalled by him the pseudo-environment.\r\n\r\nHe is, of course, permanently and constantly in debt to the new\r\npsychology, not only because when rightly applied it so greatly helps\r\npeople to stand on their own feet, come what may, but because the\r\nstudy of dreams, fantasy and rationalization has thrown light on how\r\nthe pseudo-environment is put together. But he cannot assume as his\r\ncriterion either what is called a \"normal biological career\"\r\n[Footnote: Edward J. Kempf, _Psychopathology_, p. 116.] within\r\nthe existing social order, or a career \"freed from religious\r\nsuppression and dogmatic conventions\" outside. [Footnote: _Id_.,\r\np. 151.] What for a sociologist is a normal social career? Or one\r\nfreed from suppressions and conventions? Conservative critics do, to\r\nbe sure, assume the first, and romantic ones the second. But in\r\nassuming them they are taking the whole world for granted. They are\r\nsaying in effect either that society is the sort of thing which\r\ncorresponds to their idea of what is normal, or the sort of thing\r\nwhich corresponds to their idea of what is free. Both ideas are merely\r\npublic opinions, and while the psychoanalyst as physician may perhaps\r\nassume them, the sociologist may not take the products of existing\r\npublic opinion as criteria by which to study public opinion.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe world that we have to deal with politically is out of reach, out\r\nof sight, out of mind. It has to be explored, reported, and imagined.\r\nMan is no Aristotelian god contemplating all existence at one glance.\r\nHe is the creature of an evolution who can just about span a\r\nsufficient portion of reality to manage his survival, and snatch what\r\non the scale of time are but a few moments of insight and happiness.\r\nYet this same creature has invented ways of seeing what no naked eye\r\ncould see, of hearing what no ear could hear, of weighing immense\r\nmasses and infinitesimal ones, of counting and separating more items\r\nthan he can individually remember. He is learning to see with his mind\r\nvast portions of the world that he could never see, touch, smell,\r\nhear, or remember. Gradually he makes for himself a trustworthy\r\npicture inside his head of the world beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nThose features of the world outside which have to do with the behavior\r\nof other human beings, in so far as that behavior crosses ours, is\r\ndependent upon us, or is interesting to us, we call roughly public\r\naffairs. The pictures inside the heads of these human beings, the\r\npictures of themselves, of others, of their needs, purposes, and\r\nrelationship, are their public opinions. Those pictures which are\r\nacted upon by groups of people, or by individuals acting in the name\r\nof groups, are Public Opinion with capital letters. And so in the\r\nchapters which follow we shall inquire first into some of the reasons\r\nwhy the picture inside so often misleads men in their dealings with\r\nthe world outside. Under this heading we shall consider first the\r\nchief factors which limit their access to the facts. They are the\r\nartificial censorships, the limitations of social contact, the\r\ncomparatively meager time available in each day for paying attention\r\nto public affairs, the distortion arising because events have to be\r\ncompressed into very short messages, the difficulty of making a small\r\nvocabulary express a complicated world, and finally the fear of facing\r\nthose facts which would seem to threaten the established routine of\r\nmen's lives.\r\n\r\nThe analysis then turns from these more or less external limitations\r\nto the question of how this trickle of messages from the outside is\r\naffected by the stored up images, the preconceptions, and prejudices\r\nwhich interpret, fill them out, and in their turn powerfully direct\r\nthe play of our attention, and our vision itself. From this it\r\nproceeds to examine how in the individual person the limited messages\r\nfrom outside, formed into a pattern of stereotypes, are identified\r\nwith his own interests as he feels and conceives them. In the\r\nsucceeding sections it examines how opinions are crystallized into\r\nwhat is called Public Opinion, how a National Will, a Group Mind, a\r\nSocial Purpose, or whatever you choose to call it, is formed.\r\n\r\nThe first five parts constitute the descriptive section of the book.\r\nThere follows an analysis of the traditional democratic theory of\r\npublic opinion. The substance of the argument is that democracy in its\r\noriginal form never seriously faced the problem which arises because\r\nthe pictures inside people's heads do not automatically correspond\r\nwith the world outside. And then, because the democratic theory is\r\nunder criticism by socialist thinkers, there follows an examination of\r\nthe most advanced and coherent of these criticisms, as made by the\r\nEnglish Guild Socialists. My purpose here is to find out whether these\r\nreformers take into account the main difficulties of public opinion.\r\nMy conclusion is that they ignore the difficulties, as completely as\r\ndid the original democrats, because they, too, assume, and in a much\r\nmore complicated civilization, that somehow mysteriously there exists\r\nin the hearts of men a knowledge of the world beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nI argue that representative government, either in what is ordinarily\r\ncalled politics, or in industry, cannot be worked successfully, no\r\nmatter what the basis of election, unless there is an independent,\r\nexpert organization for making the unseen facts intelligible to those\r\nwho have to make the decisions. I attempt, therefore, to argue that\r\nthe serious acceptance of the principle that personal representation\r\nmust be supplemented by representation of the unseen facts would alone\r\npermit a satisfactory decentralization, and allow us to escape from\r\nthe intolerable and unworkable fiction that each of us must acquire a\r\ncompetent opinion about all public affairs. It is argued that the\r\nproblem of the press is confused because the critics and the\r\napologists expect the press to realize this fiction, expect it to make\r\nup for all that was not foreseen in the theory of democracy, and that\r\nthe readers expect this miracle to be performed at no cost or trouble\r\nto themselves. The newspapers are regarded by democrats as a panacea\r\nfor their own defects, whereas analysis of the nature of news and of\r\nthe economic basis of journalism seems to show that the newspapers\r\nnecessarily and inevitably reflect, and therefore, in greater or\r\nlesser measure, intensify, the defective organization of public\r\nopinion. My conclusion is that public opinions must be organized for\r\nthe press if they are to be sound, not by the press as is the case\r\ntoday. This organization I conceive to be in the first instance the\r\ntask of a political science that has won its proper place as\r\nformulator, in advance of real decision, instead of apologist, critic,\r\nor reporter after the decision has been made. I try to indicate that\r\nthe perplexities of government and industry are conspiring to give\r\npolitical science this enormous opportunity to enrich itself and to\r\nserve the public. And, of course, I hope that these pages will help a\r\nfew people to realize that opportunity more vividly, and therefore to\r\npursue it more consciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nAPPROACHES TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. CENSORSHIP AND PRIVACY\r\n   \"    3. CONTACT AND OPPORTUNITY\r\n   \"    4. TIME AND ATTENTION\r\n   \"    5. SPEED, WORDS, AND CLEARNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCENSORSHIP AND PRIVACY\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe picture of a general presiding over an editorial conference at the\r\nmost terrible hour of one of the great battles of history seems more\r\nlike a scene from The Chocolate Soldier than a page from life. Yet we\r\nknow at first hand from the officer who edited the French communiqués\r\nthat these conferences were a regular part of the business of war;\r\nthat in the worst moment of Verdun, General Joffre and his cabinet met\r\nand argued over the nouns, adjectives, and verbs that were to be\r\nprinted in the newspapers the next morning.\r\n\r\n\"The evening communiqué of the twenty-third (February 1916)\" says M.\r\nde Pierrefeu, [Footnote: _G. Q. G_., pp. 126-129.] \"was edited in\r\na dramatic atmosphere. M. Berthelot, of the Prime Minister's office,\r\nhad just telephoned by order of the minister asking General Pellé to\r\nstrengthen the report and to emphasize the proportions of the enemy's\r\nattack. It was necessary to prepare the public for the worst outcome\r\nin case the affair turned into a catastrophe. This anxiety showed\r\nclearly that neither at G. H. Q. nor at the Ministry of War had the\r\nGovernment found reason for confidence. As M. Berthelot spoke, General\r\nPellé made notes. He handed me the paper on which he had written the\r\nGovernment's wishes, together with the order of the day issued by\r\nGeneral von Deimling and found on some prisoners, in which it was\r\nstated that this attack was the supreme offensive to secure peace.\r\nSkilfully used, all this was to demonstrate that Germany was letting\r\nloose a gigantic effort, an effort without precedent, and that from\r\nits success she hoped for the end of the war. The logic of this was\r\nthat nobody need be surprised at our withdrawal. When, a half hour\r\nlater, I went down with my manuscript, I found gathered together in\r\nColonel Claudel's office, he being away, the major-general, General\r\nJanin, Colonel Dupont, and Lieutenant-Colonel Renouard. Fearing that I\r\nwould not succeed in giving the desired impression, General Pellé had\r\nhimself prepared a proposed communiqué. I read what I had just done.\r\nIt was found to be too moderate. General Pellé's, on the other hand,\r\nseemed too alarming. I had purposely omitted von Deimling's order of\r\nthe day. To put it into the communiqué _would be to break with the\r\nformula to which the public was accustomed_, would be to transform\r\nit into a kind of pleading. It would seem to say: 'How do you suppose\r\nwe can resist?' There was reason to fear that the public would be\r\ndistracted by this change of tone and would believe that everything\r\nwas lost. I explained my reasons and suggested giving Deimling's text\r\nto the newspapers in the form of a separate note.\r\n\r\n\"Opinion being divided, General Pellé went to ask General de Castelnau\r\nto come and decide finally. The General arrived smiling, quiet and\r\ngood humored, said a few pleasant words about this new kind of\r\nliterary council of war, and looked at the texts. He chose the simpler\r\none, gave more weight to the first phrase, inserted the words 'as had\r\nbeen anticipated,' which supply a reassuring quality, and was flatly\r\nagainst inserting von Deimling's order, but was for transmitting it to\r\nthe press in a special note ... \" General Joffre that evening read the\r\ncommuniqué carefully and approved it.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours those two or three hundred words would be read all\r\nover the world. They would paint a picture in men's minds of what was\r\nhappening on the slopes of Verdun, and in front of that picture people\r\nwould take heart or despair. The shopkeeper in Brest, the peasant in\r\nLorraine, the deputy in the Palais Bourbon, the editor in Amsterdam or\r\nMinneapolis had to be kept in hope, and yet prepared to accept\r\npossible defeat without yielding to panic. They are told, therefore,\r\nthat the loss of ground is no surprise to the French Command. They are\r\ntaught to regard the affair as serious, but not strange. Now, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the French General Staff was not fully prepared for\r\nthe German offensive. Supporting trenches had not been dug,\r\nalternative roads had not been built, barbed wire was lacking. But to\r\nconfess that would have aroused images in the heads of civilians that\r\nmight well have turned a reverse into a disaster. The High Command\r\ncould be disappointed, and yet pull itself together; the people at\r\nhome and abroad, full of uncertainties, and with none of the\r\nprofessional man's singleness of purpose, might on the basis of a\r\ncomplete story have lost sight of the war in a melee of faction and\r\ncounter-faction about the competence of the officers. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of letting the public act on all the facts which the\r\ngenerals knew, the authorities presented only certain facts, and these\r\nonly in such a way as would be most likely to steady the people.\r\n\r\nIn this case the men who arranged the pseudo-environment knew what the\r\nreal one was. But a few days later an incident occurred about which\r\nthe French Staff did not know the truth. The Germans announced\r\n[Footnote: On February 26, 1916. Pierrefeu, _G. Q. G._, pp. 133\r\n_et seq_.] that on the previous afternoon they had taken Fort\r\nDouaumont by assault. At French headquarters in Chantilly no one\r\ncould understand this news. For on the morning of the twenty-fifth,\r\nafter the engagement of the XXth corps, the battle had taken a turn\r\nfor the better. Reports from the front said nothing about Douaumont.\r\nBut inquiry showed that the German report was true, though no one as\r\nyet knew how the fort had been taken. In the meantime, the German\r\ncommuniqué was being flashed around the world, and the French had to\r\nsay something. So headquarters explained. \"In the midst of total\r\nignorance at Chantilly about the way the attack had taken place, we\r\nimagined, in the evening communiqué of the 26th, a plan of the attack\r\nwhich certainly had a thousand to one chance of being true.\" The\r\ncommuniqué of this imaginary battle read:\r\n\r\n\"A bitter struggle is taking place around Fort de Douaumont which is\r\nan advanced post of the old defensive organization of Verdun. The\r\nposition taken this morning by the enemy, _after several\r\nunsuccessful assaults that cost him very heavy losses_, has been\r\nreached again and passed by our troops whom the enemy has not been\r\nable to drive back.\" [Footnote: This is my own translation: the\r\nEnglish translation from London published in the New York Times of\r\nSunday, Feb. 27, is as follows:\r\n\r\nLondon, Feb. 26 (1916). A furious struggle has been in progress around\r\nFort de Douaumont which is an advance element of the old defensive\r\norganization of Verdun fortresses. The position captured this morning\r\nby the enemy after several fruitless assaults which cost him extremely\r\nheavy losses, [Footnote: The French text says \"pertes tres elevees.\"\r\nThus the English translation exaggerates the original text.] was\r\nreached again and gone beyond by our troops, which all the attempts of\r\nthe enemy have not been able to push back.\"]\r\n\r\nWhat had actually happened differed from both the French and German\r\naccounts. While changing troops in the line, the position had somehow\r\nbeen forgotten in a confusion of orders. Only a battery commander and\r\na few men remained in the fort. Some German soldiers, seeing the door\r\nopen, had crawled into the fort, and taken everyone inside prisoner. A\r\nlittle later the French who were on the slopes of the hill were\r\nhorrified at being shot at from the fort. There had been no battle at\r\nDouaumont and no losses. Nor had the French troops advanced beyond it\r\nas the communiqués seemed to say. They were beyond it on either side,\r\nto be sure, but the fort was in enemy hands.\r\n\r\nYet from the communiqué everyone believed that the fort was half\r\nsurrounded. The words did not explicitly say so, but \"the press, as\r\nusual, forced the pace.\" Military writers concluded that the Germans\r\nwould soon have to surrender. In a few days they began to ask\r\nthemselves why the garrison, since it lacked food, had not yet\r\nsurrendered. \"It was necessary through the press bureau to request\r\nthem to drop the encirclement theme.\" [Footnote: Pierrefeu, _op.\r\ncit._, pp. 134-5.]\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe editor of the French communiqué tells us that as the battle\r\ndragged out, his colleagues and he set out to neutralize the\r\npertinacity of the Germans by continual insistence on their terrible\r\nlosses. It is necessary to remember that at this time, and in fact\r\nuntil late in 1917, the orthodox view of the war for all the Allied\r\npeoples was that it would be decided by \"attrition.\" Nobody believed\r\nin a war of movement. It was insisted that strategy did not count, or\r\ndiplomacy. It was simply a matter of killing Germans. The general\r\npublic more or less believed the dogma, but it had constantly to be\r\nreminded of it in face of spectacular German successes.\r\n\r\n\"Almost no day passed but the communiqué.... ascribed to the Germans\r\nwith some appearance of justice heavy losses, extremely heavy, spoke\r\nof bloody sacrifices, heaps of corpses, hecatombs. Likewise the\r\nwireless constantly used the statistics of the intelligence bureau at\r\nVerdun, whose chief, Major Cointet, had invented a method of\r\ncalculating German losses which obviously produced marvelous results.\r\nEvery fortnight the figures increased a hundred thousand or so. These\r\n300,000, 400,000, 500,000 casualties put out, divided into daily,\r\nweekly, monthly losses, repeated in all sorts of ways, produced a\r\nstriking effect. Our formulae varied little: 'according to prisoners\r\nthe German losses in the course of the attack have been considerable' ...\r\n'it is proved that the losses' ... 'the enemy exhausted by his losses\r\nhas not renewed the attack' ... Certain formulae, later abandoned\r\nbecause they had been overworked, were used each day: 'under\r\nour artillery and machine gun fire' ... 'mowed down by our artillery\r\nand machine gun fire' ... Constant repetition impressed the neutrals\r\nand Germany itself, and helped to create a bloody background in spite\r\nof the denials from Nauen (the German wireless) which tried vainly to\r\ndestroy the bad effect of this perpetual repetition.\" [Footnote: _Op.\r\ncit._, pp. 138-139.]\r\n\r\nThe thesis of the French Command, which it wished to establish\r\npublicly by these reports, was formulated as follows for the guidance\r\nof the censors:\r\n\r\n\"This offensive engages the active forces of our opponent whose\r\nmanpower is declining. We have learned that the class of 1916 is\r\nalready at the front. There will remain the 1917 class already being\r\ncalled up, and the resources of the third category (men above\r\nforty-five, or convalescents). In a few weeks, the German forces\r\nexhausted by this effort, will find themselves confronted with all the\r\nforces of the coalition (ten millions against seven millions).\"\r\n[Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 147.]\r\n\r\nAccording to M. de Pierrefeu, the French command had converted itself\r\nto this belief. \"By an extraordinary aberration of mind, only the\r\nattrition of the enemy was seen; it appeared that our forces were not\r\nsubject to attrition. General Nivelle shared these ideas. We saw the\r\nresult in 1917.\"\r\n\r\nWe have learned to call this propaganda. A group of men, who can\r\nprevent independent access to the event, arrange the news of it to\r\nsuit their purpose. That the purpose was in this case patriotic does\r\nnot affect the argument at all. They used their power to make the\r\nAllied publics see affairs as they desired them to be seen. The\r\ncasualty figures of Major Cointet which were spread about the world\r\nare of the same order. They were intended to provoke a particular kind\r\nof inference, namely that the war of attrition was going in favor of\r\nthe French. But the inference is not drawn in the form of argument. It\r\nresults almost automatically from the creation of a mental picture of\r\nendless Germans slaughtered on the hills about Verdun. By putting the\r\ndead Germans in the focus of the picture, and by omitting to mention\r\nthe French dead, a very special view of the battle was built up. It\r\nwas a view designed to neutralize the effects of German territorial\r\nadvances and the impression of power which the persistence of the\r\noffensive was making. It was also a view that tended to make the\r\npublic acquiesce in the demoralizing defensive strategy imposed upon\r\nthe Allied armies. For the public, accustomed to the idea that war\r\nconsists of great strategic movements, flank attacks, encirclements,\r\nand dramatic surrenders, had gradually to forget that picture in favor\r\nof the terrible idea that by matching lives the war would be won.\r\nThrough its control over all news from the front, the General Staff\r\nsubstituted a view of the facts that comported with this strategy.\r\n\r\nThe General Staff of an army in the field is so placed that within\r\nwide limits it can control what the public will perceive. It controls\r\nthe selection of correspondents who go to the front, controls their\r\nmovements at the front, reads and censors their messages from the\r\nfront, and operates the wires. The Government behind the army by its\r\ncommand of cables and passports, mails and custom houses and blockades\r\nincreases the control. It emphasizes it by legal power over\r\npublishers, over public meetings, and by its secret service. But in\r\nthe case of an army the control is far from perfect. There is always\r\nthe enemy's communiqué, which in these days of wireless cannot be kept\r\naway from neutrals. Above all there is the talk of the soldiers, which\r\nblows back from the front, and is spread about when they are on\r\nleave. [Footnote: For weeks prior to the American attack at St. Mihiel\r\nand in the Argonne-Meuse, everybody in France told everybody else the\r\ndeep secret.] An army is an unwieldy thing. And that is why the naval\r\nand diplomatic censorship is almost always much more complete. Fewer\r\npeople know what is going on, and their acts are more easily\r\nsupervised.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWithout some form of censorship, propaganda in the strict sense of the\r\nword is impossible. In order to conduct a propaganda there must be\r\nsome barrier between the public and the event. Access to the real\r\nenvironment must be limited, before anyone can create a\r\npseudo-environment that he thinks wise or desirable. For while people\r\nwho have direct access can misconceive what they see, no one else can\r\ndecide how they shall misconceive it, unless he can decide where they\r\nshall look, and at what. The military censorship is the simplest form\r\nof barrier, but by no means the most important, because it is known to\r\nexist, and is therefore in certain measure agreed to and discounted.\r\n\r\nAt different times and for different subjects some men impose and\r\nother men accept a particular standard of secrecy. The frontier\r\nbetween what is concealed because publication is not, as we say,\r\n\"compatible with the public interest\" fades gradually into what is\r\nconcealed because it is believed to be none of the public's business.\r\nThe notion of what constitutes a person's private affairs is elastic.\r\nThus the amount of a man's fortune is considered a private affair, and\r\ncareful provision is made in the income tax law to keep it as private\r\nas possible. The sale of a piece of land is not private, but the price\r\nmay be. Salaries are generally treated as more private than wages,\r\nincomes as more private than inheritances. A person's credit rating is\r\ngiven only a limited circulation. The profits of big corporations are\r\nmore public than those of small firms. Certain kinds of conversation,\r\nbetween man and wife, lawyer and client, doctor and patient, priest\r\nand communicant, are privileged. Directors' meetings are generally\r\nprivate. So are many political conferences. Most of what is said at a\r\ncabinet meeting, or by an ambassador to the Secretary of State, or at\r\nprivate interviews, or dinner tables, is private. Many people regard\r\nthe contract between employer and employee as private. There was a\r\ntime when the affairs of all corporations were held to be as private\r\nas a man's theology is to-day. There was a time before that when his\r\ntheology was held to be as public a matter as the color of his eyes.\r\nBut infectious diseases, on the other hand, were once as private as\r\nthe processes of a man's digestion. The history of the notion of\r\nprivacy would be an entertaining tale. Sometimes the notions violently\r\nconflict, as they did when the bolsheviks published the secret\r\ntreaties, or when Mr. Hughes investigated the life insurance\r\ncompanies, or when somebody's scandal exudes from the pages of Town\r\nTopics to the front pages of Mr. Hearst's newspapers.\r\n\r\nWhether the reasons for privacy are good or bad, the barriers exist.\r\nPrivacy is insisted upon at all kinds of places in the area of what is\r\ncalled public affairs. It is often very illuminating, therefore, to\r\nask yourself how you got at the facts on which you base your opinion.\r\nWho actually saw, heard, felt, counted, named the thing, about which\r\nyou have an opinion? Was it the man who told you, or the man who told\r\nhim, or someone still further removed? And how much was he permitted\r\nto see? When he informs you that France thinks this and that, what\r\npart of France did he watch? How was he able to watch it? Where was he\r\nwhen he watched it? What Frenchmen was he permitted to talk to, what\r\nnewspapers did he read, and where did they learn what they say? You\r\ncan ask yourself these questions, but you can rarely answer them. They\r\nwill remind you, however, of the distance which often separates your\r\npublic opinion from the event with which it deals. And the reminder is\r\nitself a protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCONTACT AND OPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nWhile censorship and privacy intercept much information at its source,\r\na very much larger body of fact never reaches the whole public at all,\r\nor only very slowly. For there are very distinct limits upon the\r\ncirculation of ideas.\r\n\r\nA rough estimate of the effort it takes to reach \"everybody\" can be\r\nhad by considering the Government's propaganda during the war.\r\nRemembering that the war had run over two years and a half before\r\nAmerica entered it, that millions upon millions of printed pages had\r\nbeen circulated and untold speeches had been delivered, let us turn to\r\nMr. Creel's account of his fight \"for the minds of men, for the\r\nconquest of their convictions\" in order that \"the gospel of\r\nAmericanism might be carried to every corner of the globe.\"\r\n[Footnote: George Creel, _How We Advertised America._]\r\n\r\nMr. Creel had to assemble machinery which included a Division of News\r\nthat issued, he tells us, more than six thousand releases, had to\r\nenlist seventy-five thousand Four Minute Men who delivered at least\r\nseven hundred and fifty-five thousand, one hundred and ninety speeches\r\nto an aggregate of over three hundred million people. Boy scouts\r\ndelivered annotated copies of President Wilson's addresses to the\r\nhouseholders of America. Fortnightly periodicals were sent to six\r\nhundred thousand teachers. Two hundred thousand lantern slides were\r\nfurnished for illustrated lectures. Fourteen hundred and thirty-eight\r\ndifferent designs were turned out for posters, window cards, newspaper\r\nadvertisements, cartoons, seals and buttons. The chambers of commerce,\r\nthe churches, fraternal societies, schools, were used as channels of\r\ndistribution. Yet Mr. Creel's effort, to which I have not begun to do\r\njustice, did not include Mr. McAdoo's stupendous organization for the\r\nLiberty Loans, nor Mr. Hoover's far reaching propaganda about food,\r\nnor the campaigns of the Red Cross, the Y. M. C. A., Salvation Army,\r\nKnights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, not to mention the\r\nindependent work of patriotic societies, like the League to Enforce\r\nPeace, the League of Free Nations Association, the National Security\r\nLeague, nor the activity of the publicity bureaus of the Allies and of\r\nthe submerged nationalities.\r\n\r\nProbably this is the largest and the most intensive effort to carry\r\nquickly a fairly uniform set of ideas to all the people of a nation.\r\nThe older proselyting worked more slowly, perhaps more surely, but\r\nnever so inclusively. Now if it required such extreme measures to\r\nreach everybody in time of crisis, how open are the more normal\r\nchannels to men's minds? The Administration was trying, and while the\r\nwar continued it very largely succeeded, I believe, in creating\r\nsomething that might almost be called one public opinion all over\r\nAmerica. But think of the dogged work, the complicated ingenuity, the\r\nmoney and the personnel that were required. Nothing like that exists\r\nin time of peace, and as a corollary there are whole sections, there\r\nare vast groups, ghettoes, enclaves and classes that hear only vaguely\r\nabout much that is going on.\r\n\r\nThey live in grooves, are shut in among their own affairs, barred out\r\nof larger affairs, meet few people not of their own sort, read little.\r\nTravel and trade, the mails, the wires, and radio, railroads,\r\nhighways, ships, motor cars, and in the coming generation aeroplanes,\r\nare, of course, of the utmost influence on the circulation of ideas.\r\nEach of these affects the supply and the quality of information and\r\nopinion in a most intricate way. Each is itself affected by technical,\r\nby economic, by political conditions. Every time a government relaxes\r\nthe passport ceremonies or the customs inspection, every time a new\r\nrailway or a new port is opened, a new shipping line established,\r\nevery time rates go up or down, the mails move faster or more slowly,\r\nthe cables are uncensored and made less expensive, highways built, or\r\nwidened, or improved, the circulation of ideas is influenced. Tariff\r\nschedules and subsidies affect the direction of commercial enterprise,\r\nand therefore the nature of human contracts. And so it may well\r\nhappen, as it did for example in the case of Salem, Massachusetts,\r\nthat a change in the art of shipbuilding will reduce a whole city from\r\na center where international influences converge to a genteel\r\nprovincial town. All the immediate effects of more rapid transit are\r\nnot necessarily good. It would be difficult to say, for example, that\r\nthe railroad system of France, so highly centralized upon Paris, has\r\nbeen an unmixed blessing to the French people.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that problems arising out of the means of\r\ncommunication are of the utmost importance, and one of the most\r\nconstructive features of the program of the League of Nations has been\r\nthe study given to railroad transit and access to the sea. The\r\nmonopolizing of cables, [Footnote: Hence the wisdom of taking Yap\r\nseriously.] of ports, fuel stations, mountain passes, canals, straits,\r\nriver courses, terminals, market places means a good deal more than\r\nthe enrichment of a group of business men, or the prestige of a\r\ngovernment. It means a barrier upon the exchange of news and opinion.\r\nBut monopoly is not the only barrier. Cost and available supply are\r\neven greater ones, for if the cost of travelling or trading is\r\nprohibitive, if the demand for facilities exceeds the supply, the\r\nbarriers exist even without monopoly.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe size of a man's income has considerable effect on his access to\r\nthe world beyond his neighborhood. With money he can overcome almost\r\nevery tangible obstacle of communication, he can travel, buy books and\r\nperiodicals, and bring within the range of his attention almost any\r\nknown fact of the world. The income of the individual, and the income\r\nof the community determine the amount of communication that is\r\npossible. But men's ideas determine how that income shall be spent,\r\nand that in turn affects in the long run the amount of income they\r\nwill have. Thus also there are limitations, none the less real,\r\nbecause they are often self-imposed and self-indulgent.\r\n\r\nThere are portions of the sovereign people who spend most of their\r\nspare time and spare money on motoring and comparing motor cars, on\r\nbridge-whist and post-mortems, on moving-pictures and potboilers,\r\ntalking always to the same people with minute variations on the same\r\nold themes. They cannot really be said to suffer from censorship, or\r\nsecrecy, the high cost or the difficulty of communication. They suffer\r\nfrom anemia, from lack of appetite and curiosity for the human scene.\r\nTheirs is no problem of access to the world outside. Worlds of\r\ninterest are waiting for them to explore, and they do not enter.\r\n\r\nThey move, as if on a leash, within a fixed radius of acquaintances\r\naccording to the law and the gospel of their social set. Among men the\r\ncircle of talk in business and at the club and in the smoking car is\r\nwider than the set to which they belong. Among women the social set\r\nand the circle of talk are frequently almost identical. It is in the\r\nsocial set that ideas derived from reading and lectures and from the\r\ncircle of talk converge, are sorted out, accepted, rejected, judged\r\nand sanctioned. There it is finally decided in each phase of a\r\ndiscussion which authorities and which sources of information are\r\nadmissible, and which not.\r\n\r\nOur social set consists of those who figure as people in the phrase\r\n\"people are saying\"; they are the people whose approval matters most\r\nintimately to us. In big cities among men and women of wide interests\r\nand with the means for moving about, the social set is not so rigidly\r\ndefined. But even in big cities, there are quarters and nests of\r\nvillages containing self-sufficing social sets. In smaller communities\r\nthere may exist a freer circulation, a more genuine fellowship from\r\nafter breakfast to before dinner. But few people do not know,\r\nnevertheless, which set they really belong to, and which not.\r\n\r\nUsually the distinguishing mark of a social set is the presumption\r\nthat the children may intermarry. To marry outside the set involves,\r\nat the very least, a moment of doubt before the engagement can be\r\napproved. Each social set has a fairly clear picture of its relative\r\nposition in the hierarchy of social sets. Between sets at the same\r\nlevel, association is easy, individuals are quickly accepted,\r\nhospitality is normal and unembarrassed. But in contact between sets\r\nthat are \"higher\" or \"lower,\" there is always reciprocal hesitation, a\r\nfaint malaise, and a consciousness of difference. To be sure in a\r\nsociety like that of the United States, individuals move somewhat\r\nfreely out of one set into another, especially where there is no\r\nracial barrier and where economic position changes so rapidly.\r\n\r\nEconomic position, however, is not measured by the amount of income.\r\nFor in the first generation, at least, it is not income that\r\ndetermines social standing, but the character of a man's work, and it\r\nmay take a generation or two before this fades out of the family\r\ntradition. Thus banking, law, medicine, public utilities, newspapers,\r\nthe church, large retailing, brokerage, manufacture, are rated at a\r\ndifferent social value from salesmanship, superintendence, expert\r\ntechnical work, nursing, school teaching, shop keeping; and those, in\r\nturn, are rated as differently from plumbing, being a chauffeur,\r\ndressmaking, subcontracting, or stenography, as these are from being a\r\nbutler, lady's maid, a moving picture operator, or a locomotive\r\nengineer. And yet the financial return does not necessarily coincide\r\nwith these gradations.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhatever the tests of admission, the social set when formed is not a\r\nmere economic class, but something which more nearly resembles a\r\nbiological clan. Membership is intimately connected with love,\r\nmarriage and children, or, to speak more exactly, with the attitudes\r\nand desires that are involved. In the social set, therefore, opinions\r\nencounter the canons of Family Tradition, Respectability, Propriety,\r\nDignity, Taste and Form, which make up the social set's picture of\r\nitself, a picture assiduously implanted in the children. In this\r\npicture a large space is tacitly given to an authorized version of\r\nwhat each set is called upon inwardly to accept as the social standing\r\nof the others. The more vulgar press for an outward expression of the\r\ndeference due, the others are decently and sensitively silent about\r\ntheir own knowledge that such deference invisibly exists. But that\r\nknowledge, becoming overt when there is a marriage, a war, or a social\r\nupheaval, is the nexus of a large bundle of dispositions classified by\r\nTrotter [Footnote: W. Trotter, Instincts of the Herd in War and Peace.]\r\nunder the general term instinct of the herd.\r\n\r\nWithin each social set there are augurs like the van der Luydens and\r\nMrs. Manson Mingott in \"The Age of Innocence,\" [Footnote: Edith\r\nWharton, _The Age of Innocence._] who are recognized as the\r\ncustodians and the interpreters of its social pattern. You are made,\r\nthey say, if the van der Luydens take you up. The invitations to their\r\nfunctions are the high sign of arrival and status. The elections to\r\ncollege societies, carefully graded and the gradations universally\r\naccepted, determine who is who in college. The social leaders,\r\nweighted with the ultimate eugenic responsibility, are peculiarly\r\nsensitive. Not only must they be watchfully aware of what makes for\r\nthe integrity of their set, but they have to cultivate a special gift\r\nfor knowing what other social sets are doing. They act as a kind of\r\nministry of foreign affairs. Where most of the members of a set live\r\ncomplacently within the set, regarding it for all practical purposes\r\nas the world, the social leaders must combine an intimate knowledge of\r\nthe anatomy of their own set with a persistent sense of its place in\r\nthe hierarchy of sets.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchy, in fact, is bound together by the social leaders. At\r\nany one level there is something which might almost be called a social\r\nset of the social leaders. But vertically the actual binding together\r\nof society, in so far as it is bound together at all by social\r\ncontact, is accomplished by those exceptional people, frequently\r\nsuspect, who like Julius Beaufort and Ellen Olenska in \"The Age of\r\nInnocence\" move in and out. Thus there come to be established personal\r\nchannels from one set to another, through which Tarde's laws of\r\nimitation operate. But for large sections of the population there are\r\nno such channels. For them the patented accounts of society and the\r\nmoving pictures of high life have to serve. They may develop a social\r\nhierarchy of their own, almost unnoticed, as have the Negroes and the\r\n\"foreign element,\" but among that assimilated mass which always\r\nconsiders itself the \"nation,\" there is in spite of the great\r\nseparateness of sets, a variety of personal contacts through which a\r\ncirculation of standards takes place.\r\n\r\nSome of the sets are so placed that they become what Professor Ross\r\nhas called \"radiant points of conventionality.\" [Footnote: Ross,\r\n_Social Psychology_, Ch. IX, X, XI.] Thus the social superior is\r\nlikely to be imitated by the social inferior, the holder of power is\r\nimitated by subordinates, the more successful by the less successful,\r\nthe rich by the poor, the city by the country. But imitation does not\r\nstop at frontiers. The powerful, socially superior, successful, rich,\r\nurban social set is fundamentally international throughout the western\r\nhemisphere, and in many ways London is its center. It counts among its\r\nmembership the most influential people in the world, containing as it\r\ndoes the diplomatic set, high finance, the upper circles of the army\r\nand the navy, some princes of the church, a few great newspaper\r\nproprietors, their wives and mothers and daughters who wield the\r\nscepter of invitation. It is at once a great circle of talk and a real\r\nsocial set. But its importance comes from the fact that here at last\r\nthe distinction between public and private affairs practically\r\ndisappears. The private affairs of this set are public matters, and\r\npublic matters are its private, often its family affairs. The\r\nconfinements of Margot Asquith like the confinements of royalty are,\r\nas the philosophers say, in much the same universe of discourse as a\r\ntariff bill or a parliamentary debate.\r\n\r\nThere are large areas of governments in which this social set is not\r\ninterested, and in America, at least, it has exercised only a\r\nfluctuating control over the national government. But its power in\r\nforeign affairs is always very great, and in war time its prestige is\r\nenormously enhanced. That is natural enough because these\r\ncosmopolitans have a contact with the outer world that most people do\r\nnot possess. They have dined with each other in the capitals, and\r\ntheir sense of national honor is no mere abstraction; it is a concrete\r\nexperience of being snubbed or approved by their friends. To Dr.\r\nKennicott of Gopher Prairie it matters mighty little what Winston\r\nthinks and a great deal what Ezra Stowbody thinks, but to Mrs. Mingott\r\nwith a daughter married to the Earl of Swithin it matters a lot when\r\nshe visits her daughter, or entertains Winston himself. Dr. Kennicott\r\nand Mrs. Mingott are both socially sensitive, but Mrs. Mingott is\r\nsensitive to a social set that governs the world, while Dr.\r\nKennicott's social set governs only in Gopher Prairie. But in matters\r\nthat effect the larger relationships of the Great Society, Dr.\r\nKennicott will often be found holding what he thinks is purely his own\r\nopinion, though, as a matter of fact, it has trickled down to Gopher\r\nPrairie from High Society, transmuted on its passage through the\r\nprovincial social sets.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nIt is no part of our inquiry to attempt an account of the social\r\ntissue. We need only fix in mind how big is the part played by the\r\nsocial set in our spiritual contact with the world, how it tends to\r\nfix what is admissible, and to determine how it shall be judged.\r\nAffairs within its immediate competence each set more or less\r\ndetermines for itself. Above all it determines the detailed\r\nadministration of the judgment. But the judgment itself is formed on\r\npatterns [Footnote: _Cf_. Part III] that may be inherited from\r\nthe past, transmitted or imitated from other social sets. The highest\r\nsocial set consists of those who embody the leadership of the Great\r\nSociety. As against almost every other social set where the bulk of\r\nthe opinions are first hand only about local affairs, in this Highest\r\nSociety the big decisions of war and peace, of social strategy and the\r\nultimate distribution of political power, are intimate experiences\r\nwithin a circle of what, potentially at least, are personal\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nSince position and contact play so big a part in determining what can\r\nbe seen, heard, read, and experienced, as well as what it is\r\npermissible to see, hear, read, and know, it is no wonder that moral\r\njudgment is so much more common than constructive thought. Yet in\r\ntruly effective thinking the prime necessity is to liquidate\r\njudgments, regain an innocent eye, disentangle feelings, be curious\r\nand open-hearted. Man's history being what it is, political opinion on\r\nthe scale of the Great Society requires an amount of selfless\r\nequanimity rarely attainable by any one for any length of time. We are\r\nconcerned in public affairs, but immersed in our private ones. The\r\ntime and attention are limited that we can spare for the labor of not\r\ntaking opinions for granted, and we are subject to constant\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTIME AND ATTENTION\r\n\r\nNATURALLY it is possible to make a rough estimate only of the amount\r\nof attention people give each day to informing themselves about public\r\naffairs. Yet it is interesting that three estimates that I have\r\nexamined agree tolerably well, though they were made at different\r\ntimes, in different places, and by different methods. [Footnote: July,\r\n1900. D. F. Wilcox, _The American Newspaper: A Study in Social\r\nPsychology_, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social\r\nScience, vol. xvi, p. 56. (The statistical tables are reproduced in\r\nJames Edward Rogers, _The American Newspaper_.)\r\n\r\n1916 (?) W. D. Scott, _The Psychology of Advertising_, pp.\r\n226-248. See also Henry Foster Adams, _Advertising and its Mental\r\nLaws_, Ch. IV.\r\n\r\n1920 _Newspaper Reading Habits of College Students_, by Prof.\r\nGeorge Burton Hotchkiss and Richard B. Franken, published by the\r\nAssociation of National Advertisers, Inc., 15 East 26th Street, New\r\nYork City.]\r\n\r\nA questionnaire was sent by Hotchkiss and Franken to 1761 men and\r\nwomen college students in New York City, and answers came from all but\r\na few. Scott used a questionnaire on four thousand prominent business\r\nand professional men in Chicago and received replies from twenty-three\r\nhundred. Between seventy and seventy-five percent of all those who\r\nreplied to either inquiry thought they spent a quarter of an hour a\r\nday reading newspapers. Only four percent of the Chicago group guessed\r\nat less than this and twenty-five percent guessed at more. Among the\r\nNew Yorkers a little over eight percent figured their newspaper\r\nreading at less than fifteen minutes, and seventeen and a half at\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nVery few people have an accurate idea of fifteen minutes, so the\r\nfigures are not to be taken literally. Moreover, business men,\r\nprofessional people, and college students are most of them liable to a\r\ncurious little bias against appearing to spend too much time over the\r\nnewspapers, and perhaps also to a faint suspicion of a desire to be\r\nknown as rapid readers. All that the figures can justly be taken to\r\nmean is that over three quarters of those in the selected groups rate\r\nrather low the attention they give to printed news of the outer world.\r\n\r\nThese time estimates are fairly well confirmed by a test which is less\r\nsubjective. Scott asked his Chicagoans how many papers they read each\r\nday, and was told that\r\n\r\n  14 percent read but one paper\r\n  46    \"      \"  two papers\r\n  21    \"      \"  three papers\r\n  10    \"      \"  four papers\r\n   3    \"      \"  five papers\r\n   2    \"      \"  six papers\r\n   3    \"      \"  all the papers (eight\r\n          at the time of this inquiry).\r\n\r\nThe two- and three-paper readers are sixty-seven percent, which comes\r\nfairly close to the seventy-one percent in Scott's group who rate\r\nthemselves at fifteen minutes a day. The omnivorous readers of from\r\nfour to eight papers coincide roughly with the twenty-five percent who\r\nrated themselves at more than fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIt is still more difficult to guess how the time is distributed. The\r\ncollege students were asked to name \"the five features which interest\r\nyou most.\" Just under twenty percent voted for \"general news,\" just\r\nunder fifteen for editorials, just under twelve for \"politics,\" a\r\nlittle over eight for finance, not two years after the armistice a\r\nlittle over six for foreign news, three and a half for local, nearly\r\nthree for business, and a quarter of one percent for news about\r\n\"labor.\" A scattering said they were most interested in sports,\r\nspecial articles, the theatre, advertisements, cartoons, book reviews,\r\n\"accuracy,\" music, \"ethical tone,\" society, brevity, art, stories,\r\nshipping, school news, \"current news,\" print. Disregarding these,\r\nabout sixty-seven and a half percent picked as the most interesting\r\nfeatures news and opinion that dealt with public affairs.\r\n\r\nThis was a mixed college group. The girls professed greater interest\r\nthan the boys in general news, foreign news, local news, politics,\r\neditorials, the theatre, music, art, stories, cartoons,\r\nadvertisements, and \"ethical tone.\" The boys on the other hand were\r\nmore absorbed in finance, sports, business page, \"accuracy\" and\r\n\"brevity.\" These discriminations correspond a little too closely with\r\nthe ideals of what is cultured and moral, manly and decisive, not to\r\nmake one suspect the utter objectivity of the replies.\r\n\r\nYet they agree fairly well with the replies of Scott's Chicago\r\nbusiness and professional men. They were asked, not what features\r\ninterested them most, but why they preferred one newspaper to another.\r\nNearly seventy-one percent based their conscious preference on local\r\nnews (17.8%), or political (15.8%) or financial (11.3%), or foreign\r\n(9.5%), or general (7.2%), or editorials (9%). The other thirty\r\npercent decided on grounds not connected with public affairs. They\r\nranged from not quite seven who decided for ethical tone, down to one\r\ntwentieth of one percent who cared most about humor.\r\n\r\nHow do these preferences correspond with the space given by newspapers\r\nto various subjects? Unfortunately there are no data collected on this\r\npoint for the newspapers read by the Chicago and New York groups at\r\nthe time the questionnaires were made. But there is an interesting\r\nanalysis made over twenty years ago by Wilcox. He studied one hundred\r\nand ten newspapers in fourteen large cities, and classified the\r\nsubject matter of over nine thousand columns.\r\n\r\nAveraged for the whole country the various newspaper matter was found\r\nto fill:\r\n\r\n                        { (a) War News       17.9\r\n                        {                          { Foreign   1.2\r\n                        { (b) General \"      21.8  { Politics  6.4\r\nI.

Advertisements  32.1\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to bring this table into a fair comparison, it is necessary\r\nto exclude the space given to advertisements, and recompute the\r\npercentages. For the advertisements occupied only an infinitesimal\r\npart of the conscious preference of the Chicago group or the college\r\ngroup. I think this is justifiable for our purposes because the press\r\nprints what advertisements it can get, [Footnote: Except those which it\r\nregards as objectionable, and those which, in rare instances, are\r\ncrowded out.] whereas the rest of the paper is designed to the taste\r\nof its readers. The table would then read:\r\n\r\n                         {War News      26.4-\r\n                         {                    {Foreign   1.8-\r\n  I.

Since that time the proportion of features to news has\r\nundoubtedly increased, and so has the circulation and the size of\r\nnewspapers. Therefore, if to-day you could secure accurate replies\r\nfrom more typical groups than college students or business and\r\nprofessional men, you would expect to find a smaller percentage of\r\ntime devoted to public affairs, as well as a smaller percentage of\r\nspace. On the other hand you would expect to find that the average man\r\nspends more than the quarter of an hour on his newspaper, and that\r\nwhile the percentage of space given to public affairs is less than\r\ntwenty years ago the net amount is greater.\r\n\r\nNo elaborate deductions are to be drawn from these figures. They help\r\nmerely to make somewhat more concrete our notions of the effort that\r\ngoes day by day into acquiring the data of our opinions. The\r\nnewspapers are, of course, not the only means, but they are certainly\r\nthe principal ones. Magazines, the public forum, the chautauqua, the\r\nchurch, political gatherings, trade union meetings, women's clubs, and\r\nnews serials in the moving picture houses supplement the press. But\r\ntaking it all at the most favorable estimate, the time each day is\r\nsmall when any of us is directly exposed to information from our\r\nunseen environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSPEED, WORDS, AND CLEARNESS\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe unseen environment is reported to us chiefly by words. These words\r\nare transmitted by wire or radio from the reporters to the editors who\r\nfit them into print. Telegraphy is expensive, and the facilities are\r\noften limited. Press service news is, therefore, usually coded. Thus a\r\ndispatch which reads,--\r\n\r\n\"Washington, D. C. June I.--The United States regards the question of\r\nGerman shipping seized in this country at the outbreak of hostilities\r\nas a closed incident,\"\r\n\r\nmay pass over the wires in the following form:\r\n\r\n\"Washn i. The Uni Stas rgds tq of Ger spg seized in ts cou at t outbk\r\no hox as a clod incident.\" [Footnote: Phillip's Code.]\r\n\r\nA news item saying:\r\n\r\n\"Berlin, June 1, Chancellor Wirth told the Reichstag to-day in\r\noutlining the Government's program that 'restoration and\r\nreconciliation would be the keynote of the new Government's policy.'\r\nHe added that the Cabinet was determined disarmament should be carried\r\nout loyally and that disarmament would not be the occasion of the\r\nimposition of further penalties by the Allies.\"\r\n\r\nmay be cabled in this form:\r\n\r\n\"Berlin 1. Chancellor Wirth told t Reichstag tdy in outlining the gvts\r\npgn tt qn restoration & reconciliation wd b the keynote f new gvts\r\npolicy. qj He added ttt cabinet ws dtmd disarmament sd b carried out\r\nloyally & tt disarmament wd n b. the ocan f imposition of further\r\npenalties bi t alis.\"\r\n\r\nIn this second item the substance has been culled from a long speech\r\nin a foreign tongue, translated, coded, and then decoded. The\r\noperators who receive the messages transcribe them as they go along,\r\nand I am told that a good operator can write fifteen thousand or even\r\nmore words per eight hour day, with a half an hour out for lunch and\r\ntwo ten minute periods for rest.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nA few words must often stand for a whole succession of acts, thoughts,\r\nfeelings and consequences. We read:\r\n\r\n\"Washington, Dec. 23--A statement charging Japanese military\r\nauthorities with deeds more 'frightful and barbarous' than anything\r\never alleged to have occurred in Belgium during the war was issued\r\nhere to-day by the Korean Commission, based, the Commission said, on\r\nauthentic reports received by it from Manchuria.\"\r\n\r\nHere eyewitnesses, their accuracy unknown, report to the makers of\r\n'authentic reports'; they in turn transmit these to a commission five\r\nthousand miles away. It prepares a statement, probably much too long\r\nfor publication, from which a correspondent culls an item of print\r\nthree and a half inches long. The meaning has to be telescoped in such\r\na way as to permit the reader to judge how much weight to give to the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether a supreme master of style could pack all the\r\nelements of truth that complete justice would demand into a hundred\r\nword account of what had happened in Korea during the course of\r\nseveral months. For language is by no means a perfect vehicle of\r\nmeanings. Words, like currency, are turned over and over again, to\r\nevoke one set of images to-day, another to-morrow. There is no\r\ncertainty whatever that the same word will call out exactly the same\r\nidea in the reader's mind as it did in the reporter's. Theoretically,\r\nif each fact and each relation had a name that was unique, and if\r\neveryone had agreed on the names, it would be possible to communicate\r\nwithout misunderstanding. In the exact sciences there is an approach\r\nto this ideal, and that is part of the reason why of all forms of\r\nworld-wide cooperation, scientific inquiry is the most effective.\r\n\r\nMen command fewer words than they have ideas to express, and language,\r\nas Jean Paul said, is a dictionary of faded metaphors. [Footnote:\r\nCited by White, _Mechanisms of Character Formation._] The\r\njournalist addressing half a million readers of whom he has only a dim\r\npicture, the speaker whose words are flashed to remote villages and\r\noverseas, cannot hope that a few phrases will carry the whole burden\r\nof their meaning. \"The words of Lloyd George, badly understood and\r\nbadly transmitted,\" said M. Briand to the Chamber of Deputies,\r\n[Footnote: Special Cable to _The New York Times,_ May 25, 1921,\r\nby Edwin L, James. ] \"seemed to give the Pan-Germanists the idea that\r\nthe time had come to start something.\" A British Prime Minister,\r\nspeaking in English to the whole attentive world, speaks his own\r\nmeaning in his own words to all kinds of people who will see their\r\nmeaning in those words. No matter how rich or subtle--or rather the\r\nmore rich and the more subtle that which he has to say, the more his\r\nmeaning will suffer as it is sluiced into standard speech and then\r\ndistributed again among alien minds. [Footnote: In May of 1921,\r\nrelations between England and France were strained by the insurrection\r\nof M. Korfanty in Upper Silesia. The London Correspondence of the\r\n_Manchester Guardian_ (May 20, 1921), contained the following\r\nitem:\r\n\r\n\"The Franco-English Exchange in Words.\r\n\r\n\"In quarters well acquainted with French ways and character I find a\r\ntendency to think that undue sensibility has been shown by our press\r\nand public opinion in the lively and at times intemperate language of\r\nthe French press through the present crisis. The point was put to me\r\nby a well-informed neutral observer in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\"Words, like money, are tokens of value. They represent meaning,\r\ntherefore, and just as money, their representative value goes up and\r\ndown. The French word 'etonnant' was used by Bossuet with a terrible\r\nweight of meaning which it has lost to-day. A similar thing can be\r\nobserved with the English word 'awful.' Some nations constitutionally\r\ntend to understate, others to overstate. What the British Tommy called\r\nan unhealthy place could only be described by an Italian soldier by\r\nmeans of a rich vocabulary aided with an exuberant mimicry. Nations\r\nthat understate keep their word-currency sound. Nations that overstate\r\nsuffer from inflation in their language.\r\n\r\n\"Expressions such as 'a distinguished scholar,' 'a clever writer,'\r\nmust be translated into French as 'a great savant,' 'an exquisite\r\nmaster.' It is a mere matter of exchange, just as in France one pound\r\npays 46 francs, and yet one knows that that does not increase its\r\nvalue at home. Englishmen reading the French press should endeavour to\r\nwork out a mental operation similar to that of the banker who puts\r\nback francs into pounds, and not forget in so doing that while in\r\nnormal times the change was 25 it is now 46 on account of the war. For\r\nthere is a war fluctuation on word exchanges as well as on money\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\n\"The argument, one hopes, works both ways, and Frenchmen do not fail\r\nto realize that there is as much value behind English reticence as\r\nbehind their own exuberance of expression.\"]\r\n\r\nMillions of those who are watching him can read hardly at all.\r\nMillions more can read the words but cannot understand them. Of those\r\nwho can both read and understand, a good three-quarters we may assume\r\nhave some part of half an hour a day to spare for the subject. To them\r\nthe words so acquired are the cue for a whole train of ideas on which\r\nultimately a vote of untold consequences may be based. Necessarily the\r\nideas which we allow the words we read to evoke form the biggest part\r\nof the original data of our opinions. The world is vast, the\r\nsituations that concern us are intricate, the messages are few, the\r\nbiggest part of opinion must be constructed in the imagination.\r\n\r\nWhen we use the word \"Mexico\" what picture does it evoke in a resident\r\nof New York? Likely as not, it is some composite of sand, cactus, oil\r\nwells, greasers, rum-drinking Indians, testy old cavaliers flourishing\r\nwhiskers and sovereignty, or perhaps an idyllic peasantry à la Jean\r\nJacques, assailed by the prospect of smoky industrialism, and fighting\r\nfor the Rights of Man. What does the word \"Japan\" evoke? Is it a vague\r\nhorde of slant-eyed yellow men, surrounded by Yellow Perils, picture\r\nbrides, fans, Samurai, banzais, art, and cherry blossoms? Or the word\r\n\"alien\"? According to a group of New England college students, writing\r\nin the year 1920, an alien was the following: [Footnote: _The New\r\nRepublic_: December 29, 1920, p. 142. ]\r\n\r\n\"A person hostile to this country.\"\r\n\"A person against the government.\"\r\n\"A person who is on the opposite side.\"\r\n\"A native of an unfriendly country.\"\r\n\"A foreigner at war.\"\r\n\"A foreigner who tries to do harm to the country he is in.\"\r\n\"An enemy from a foreign land.\"\r\n\"A person against a country.\" etc....\r\n\r\nYet the word alien is an unusually exact legal term, far more exact\r\nthan words like sovereignty, independence, national honor, rights,\r\ndefense, aggression, imperialism, capitalism, socialism, about which\r\nwe so readily take sides \"for\" or \"against.\"\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe power to dissociate superficial analogies, attend to differences\r\nand appreciate variety is lucidity of mind. It is a relative faculty.\r\nYet the differences in lucidity are extensive, say as between a newly\r\nborn infant and a botanist examining a flower. To the infant there is\r\nprecious little difference between his own toes, his father's watch,\r\nthe lamp on the table, the moon in the sky, and a nice bright yellow\r\nedition of Guy de Maupassant. To many a member of the Union League\r\nClub there is no remarkable difference between a Democrat, a\r\nSocialist, an anarchist, and a burglar, while to a highly\r\nsophisticated anarchist there is a whole universe of difference\r\nbetween Bakunin, Tolstoi, and Kropotkin. These examples show how\r\ndifficult it might be to secure a sound public opinion about de\r\nMaupassant among babies, or about Democrats in the Union League Club.\r\n\r\nA man who merely rides in other people's automobiles may not rise to\r\nfiner discrimination than between a Ford, a taxicab, and an\r\nautomobile. But let that same man own a car and drive it, let him, as\r\nthe psychoanalysts would say, project his libido upon automobiles, and\r\nhe will describe a difference in carburetors by looking at the rear\r\nend of a car a city block away. That is why it is often such a relief\r\nwhen the talk turns from \"general topics\" to a man's own hobby. It is\r\nlike turning from the landscape in the parlor to the ploughed field\r\noutdoors. It is a return to the three dimensional world, after a\r\nsojourn in the painter's portrayal of his own emotional response to\r\nhis own inattentive memory of what he imagines he ought to have seen.\r\n\r\nWe easily identify, says Ferenczi, two only partially similar things:\r\n[Footnote: Internat. Zeitschr, f. Arztl. Psychoanalyse, 1913.\r\nTranslated and republished by Dr. Ernest Jones in S. Ferenczi,\r\n_Contributions to Psychoanalysis_, Ch. VIII, _Stages in the\r\nDevelopment of the Sense of Reality_.] the child more easily than\r\nthe adult, the primitive or arrested mind more readily than the\r\nmature. As it first appears in the child, consciousness seems to be an\r\nunmanageable mixture of sensations. The child has no sense of time,\r\nand almost none of space, it reaches for the chandelier with the same\r\nconfidence that it reaches for its mother's breast, and at first with\r\nalmost the same expectation. Only very gradually does function define\r\nitself. To complete inexperience this is a coherent and\r\nundifferentiated world, in which, as someone has said of a school of\r\nphilosophers, all facts are born free and equal. Those facts which\r\nbelong together in the world have not yet been separated from those\r\nwhich happen to lie side by side in the stream of consciousness.\r\n\r\nAt first, says Ferenczi, the baby gets some of the things it wants by\r\ncrying for them. This is \"the period of magical hallucinatory\r\nomnipotence.\" In its second phase the child points to the things it\r\nwants, and they are given to it. \"Omnipotence by the help of magic\r\ngestures.\" Later, the child learns to talk, asks for what it wishes,\r\nand is partially successful. \"The period of magic thoughts and magic\r\nwords.\" Each phase may persist for certain situations, though overlaid\r\nand only visible at times, as for example, in the little harmless\r\nsuperstitions from which few of us are wholly free. In each phase,\r\npartial success tends to confirm that way of acting, while failure\r\ntends to stimulate the development of another. Many individuals,\r\nparties, and even nations, rarely appear to transcend the magical\r\norganization of experience. But in the more advanced sections of the\r\nmost advanced peoples, trial and error after repeated failure has led\r\nto the invention of a new principle. The moon, they learn, is not\r\nmoved by baying at it. Crops are not raised from the soil by spring\r\nfestivals or Republican majorities, but by sunlight, moisture, seeds,\r\nfertilizer, and cultivation. [Footnote: Ferenczi, being a pathologist,\r\ndoes not describe this maturer period where experience is organized as\r\nequations, the phase of realism on the basis of science.]\r\n\r\nAllowing for the purely schematic value of Ferenczi's categories of\r\nresponse, the quality which we note as critical is the power to\r\ndiscriminate among crude perceptions and vague analogies. This power\r\nhas been studied under laboratory conditions. [Footnote: See, for\r\nexample, Diagnostische Assoziation Studien, conducted at the\r\nPsychiatric University Clinic in Zurich under the direction of Dr. C.\r\nG. Jung. These tests were carried on principally under the so-called\r\nKrapelin-Aschaffenburg classification. They show reaction time,\r\nclassify response to the stimulant word as inner, outer, and clang,\r\nshow separate results for the first and second hundred words, for\r\nreaction time and reaction quality when the subject is distracted by\r\nholding an idea in mind, or when he replies while beating time with a\r\nmetronome. Some of the results are summarized in Jung, _Analytical\r\nPsychology_, Ch. II, transl. by Dr. Constance E. Long.] The Zurich\r\nAssociation Studies indicate clearly that slight mental fatigue, an\r\ninner disturbance of attention or an external distraction, tend to\r\n\"flatten\" the quality of the response. An example of the very \"flat\"\r\ntype is the clang association (cat-hat), a reaction to the sound and\r\nnot to the sense of the stimulant word. One test, for example, shows a\r\n9% increase of clang in the second series of a hundred reactions. Now\r\nthe clang is almost a repetition, a very primitive form of analogy.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nIf the comparatively simple conditions of a laboratory can so readily\r\nflatten out discrimination, what must be the effect of city life? In\r\nthe laboratory the fatigue is slight enough, the distraction rather\r\ntrivial. Both are balanced in measure by the subject's interest and\r\nself-consciousness. Yet if the beat of a metronome will depress\r\nintelligence, what do eight or twelve hours of noise, odor, and heat\r\nin a factory, or day upon day among chattering typewriters and\r\ntelephone bells and slamming doors, do to the political judgments\r\nformed on the basis of newspapers read in street-cars and subways? Can\r\nanything be heard in the hubbub that does not shriek, or be seen in\r\nthe general glare that does not flash like an electric sign? The life\r\nof the city dweller lacks solitude, silence, ease. The nights are\r\nnoisy and ablaze. The people of a big city are assaulted by incessant\r\nsound, now violent and jagged, now falling into unfinished rhythms,\r\nbut endless and remorseless. Under modern industrialism thought goes\r\non in a bath of noise. If its discriminations are often flat and\r\nfoolish, here at least is some small part of the reason. The sovereign\r\npeople determines life and death and happiness under conditions where\r\nexperience and experiment alike show thought to be most difficult.\r\n\"The intolerable burden of thought\" is a burden when the conditions\r\nmake it burdensome. It is no burden when the conditions are favorable.\r\nIt is as exhilarating to think as it is to dance, and just as natural.\r\n\r\nEvery man whose business it is to think knows that he must for part of\r\nthe day create about himself a pool of silence. But in that\r\nhelter-skelter which we flatter by the name of civilization, the\r\ncitizen performs the perilous business of government under the worst\r\npossible conditions. A faint recognition of this truth inspires the\r\nmovement for a shorter work day, for longer vacations, for light, air,\r\norder, sunlight and dignity in factories and offices. But if the\r\nintellectual quality of our life is to be improved that is only the\r\nmerest beginning. So long as so many jobs are an endless and, for the\r\nworker, an aimless routine, a kind of automatism using one set of\r\nmuscles in one monotonous pattern, his whole life will tend towards an\r\nautomatism in which nothing is particularly to be distinguished from\r\nanything else unless it is announced with a thunderclap. So long as he\r\nis physically imprisoned in crowds by day and even by night his\r\nattention will flicker and relax. It will not hold fast and define\r\nclearly where he is the victim of all sorts of pother, in a home which\r\nneeds to be ventilated of its welter of drudgery, shrieking children,\r\nraucous assertions, indigestible food, bad air, and suffocating\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nOccasionally perhaps we enter a building which is composed and\r\nspacious; we go to a theatre where modern stagecraft has cut away\r\ndistraction, or go to sea, or into a quiet place, and we remember how\r\ncluttered, how capricious, how superfluous and clamorous is the\r\nordinary urban life of our time. We learn to understand why our addled\r\nminds seize so little with precision, why they are caught up and\r\ntossed about in a kind of tarantella by headlines and catch-words, why\r\nso often they cannot tell things apart or discern identity in apparent\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nBut this external disorder is complicated further by internal.\r\nExperiment shows that the speed, the accuracy, and the intellectual\r\nquality of association is deranged by what we are taught to call\r\nemotional conflicts. Measured in fifths of a second, a series of a\r\nhundred stimuli containing both neutral and hot words may show a\r\nvariation as between 5 and 32 or even a total failure to respond at\r\nall. [Footnote: Jung, _Clark Lectures_.] Obviously our public\r\nopinion is in intermittent contact with complexes of all sorts; with\r\nambition and economic interest, personal animosity, racial prejudice,\r\nclass feeling and what not. They distort our reading, our thinking,\r\nour talking and our behavior in a great variety of ways.\r\n\r\nAnd finally since opinions do not stop at the normal members of\r\nsociety, since for the purposes of an election, a propaganda, a\r\nfollowing, numbers constitute power, the quality of attention is still\r\nfurther depressed. The mass of absolutely illiterate, of\r\nfeeble-minded, grossly neurotic, undernourished and frustrated\r\nindividuals, is very considerable, much more considerable there is\r\nreason to think than we generally suppose. Thus a wide popular appeal\r\nis circulated among persons who are mentally children or barbarians,\r\npeople whose lives are a morass of entanglements, people whose\r\nvitality is exhausted, shut-in people, and people whose experience has\r\ncomprehended no factor in the problem under discussion. The stream of\r\npublic opinion is stopped by them in little eddies of misunderstanding,\r\nwhere it is discolored with prejudice and far fetched analogy.\r\n\r\nA \"broad appeal\" takes account of the quality of association, and is\r\nmade to those susceptibilities which are widely distributed. A\r\n\"narrow\" or a \"special\" appeal is one made to those susceptibilities\r\nwhich are uncommon. But the same individual may respond with very\r\ndifferent quality to different stimuli, or to the same stimuli at\r\ndifferent times. Human susceptibilities are like an alpine country.\r\nThere are isolated peaks, there are extensive but separated plateaus,\r\nand there are deeper strata which are quite continuous for nearly all\r\nmankind. Thus the individuals whose susceptibilities reach the\r\nrarefied atmosphere of those peaks where there exists an exquisitive\r\ndifference between Frege and Peano, or between Sassetta's earlier and\r\nlater periods, may be good stanch Republicans at another level of\r\nappeal, and when they are starving and afraid, indistinguishable from\r\nany other starving and frightened person. No wonder that the magazines\r\nwith the large circulations prefer the face of a pretty girl to any\r\nother trade mark, a face, pretty enough to be alluring, but innocent\r\nenough to be acceptable. For the \"psychic level\" on which the stimulus\r\nacts determines whether the public is to be potentially a large or a\r\nsmall one.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThus the environment with which our public opinions deal is refracted\r\nin many ways, by censorship and privacy at the source, by physical and\r\nsocial barriers at the other end, by scanty attention, by the poverty\r\nof language, by distraction, by unconscious constellations of feeling,\r\nby wear and tear, violence, monotony. These limitations upon our\r\naccess to that environment combine with the obscurity and complexity\r\nof the facts themselves to thwart clearness and justice of perception,\r\nto substitute misleading fictions for workable ideas, and to deprive\r\nus of adequate checks upon those who consciously strive to mislead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nSTEREOTYPES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.

THE DETECTION OF STEREOTYPES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSTEREOTYPES\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nEach of us lives and works on a small part of the earth's surface,\r\nmoves in a small circle, and of these acquaintances knows only a few\r\nintimately. Of any public event that has wide effects we see at best\r\nonly a phase and an aspect. This is as true of the eminent insiders\r\nwho draft treaties, make laws, and issue orders, as it is of those who\r\nhave treaties framed for them, laws promulgated to them, orders given\r\nat them. Inevitably our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach\r\nof time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe.\r\nThey have, therefore, to be pieced together out of what others have\r\nreported and what we can imagine.\r\n\r\nYet even the eyewitness does not bring back a naéve picture of the\r\nscene. [Footnote: _E. g. cf._ Edmond Locard, _L'Enquête Criminelle\r\net les Méthodes Scientifiques._ A great deal of interesting material has\r\nbeen gathered in late years on the credibility of the witness, which\r\nshows, as an able reviewer of Dr. Locard's book says in _The\r\nTimes_ (London) Literary Supplement (August 18, 1921), that\r\ncredibility varies as to classes of witnesses and classes of events,\r\nand also as to type of perception. Thus, perceptions of touch, odor,\r\nand taste have low evidential value. Our hearing is defective and\r\narbitrary when it judges the source and direction of sound, and in\r\nlistening to the talk of other people \"words which are not heard will\r\nbe supplied by the witness in all good faith. He will have a theory of\r\nthe purport of the conversation, and will arrange the sounds he heard\r\nto fit it.\" Even visual perceptions are liable to great error, as in\r\nidentification, recognition, judgment of distance, estimates of\r\nnumbers, for example, the size of a crowd. In the untrained observer,\r\nthe sense of time is highly variable. All these original weaknesses\r\nare complicated by tricks of memory, and the incessant creative\r\nquality of the imagination. _Cf_. also Sherrington, _The  Integrative\r\nAction of the Nervous System_, pp. 318-327.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Hugo Münsterberg wrote a popular book on this\r\nsubject called _On the Witness Stand_.] For experience seems to\r\nshow that he himself brings something to the scene which later he\r\ntakes away from it, that oftener than not what he imagines to be the\r\naccount of an event is really a transfiguration of it. Few facts in\r\nconsciousness seem to be merely given. Most facts in consciousness\r\nseem to be partly made. A report is the joint product of the knower\r\nand known, in which the role of the observer is always selective and\r\nusually creative. The facts we see depend on where we are placed, and\r\nthe habits of our eyes.\r\n\r\nAn unfamiliar scene is like the baby's world, \"one great, blooming,\r\nbuzzing confusion.\" [Footnote: Wm. James, _Principles of\r\nPsychology_, Vol. I, p. 488.] This is the way, says Mr. John Dewey,\r\n[Footnote: John Dewey, _How We Think_, pg 121.] that any new\r\nthing strikes an adult, so far as the thing is really new and strange.\r\n\"Foreign languages that we do not understand always seem jibberings,\r\nbabblings, in which it is impossible to fix a definite, clear-cut,\r\nindividualized group of sounds. The countryman in the crowded street,\r\nthe landlubber at sea, the ignoramus in sport at a contest between\r\nexperts in a complicated game, are further instances. Put an\r\ninexperienced man in a factory, and at first the work seems to him a\r\nmeaningless medley. All strangers of another race proverbially look\r\nalike to the visiting stranger. Only gross differences of size or\r\ncolor are perceived by an outsider in a flock of sheep, each of which\r\nis perfectly individualized to the shepherd. A diffusive blur and an\r\nindiscriminately shifting suction characterize what we do not\r\nunderstand. The problem of the acquisition of meaning by things, or\r\n(stated in another way) of forming habits of simple apprehension, is\r\nthus the problem of introducing (1) _definiteness_ and _distinction_\r\nand (2) _consistency_ or _stability_ of meaning into what is\r\notherwise vague and wavering.\"\r\n\r\nBut the kind of definiteness and consistency introduced depends upon\r\nwho introduces them. In a later passage [Footnote: _op. cit._, p.\r\n133.] Dewey gives an example of how differently an experienced layman\r\nand a chemist might define the word metal. \"Smoothness, hardness,\r\nglossiness, and brilliancy, heavy weight for its size ... the\r\nserviceable properties of capacity for being hammered and pulled\r\nwithout breaking, of being softened by heat and hardened by cold, of\r\nretaining the shape and form given, of resistance to pressure and\r\ndecay, would probably be included\" in the layman's definition. But the\r\nchemist would likely as not ignore these esthetic and utilitarian\r\nqualities, and define a metal as \"any chemical element that enters\r\ninto combination with oxygen so as to form a base.\"\r\n\r\nFor the most part we do not first see, and then define, we define\r\nfirst and then see. In the great blooming, buzzing confusion of the\r\nouter world we pick out what our culture has already defined for us,\r\nand we tend to perceive that which we have picked out in the form\r\nstereotyped for us by our culture. Of the great men who assembled at\r\nParis to settle the affairs of mankind, how many were there who were\r\nable to see much of the Europe about them, rather than their\r\ncommitments about Europe? Could anyone have penetrated the mind of M.\r\nClemenceau, would he have found there images of the Europe of 1919, or\r\na great sediment of stereotyped ideas accumulated and hardened in a\r\nlong and pugnacious existence? Did he see the Germans of 1919, or the\r\nGerman type as he had learned to see it since 1871? He saw the type,\r\nand among the reports that came to him from Germany, he took to heart\r\nthose reports, and, it seems, those only, which fitted the type that\r\nwas in his mind. If a junker blustered, that was an authentic German;\r\nif a labor leader confessed the guilt of the empire, he was not an\r\nauthentic German.\r\n\r\nAt a Congress of Psychology in Göttingen an interesting experiment was\r\nmade with a crowd of presumably trained observers. [Footnote: A. von\r\nGennep, _La formation des légendes_, pp. 158-159. Cited F. van\r\nLangenhove, _The Growth of a Legend_, pp. 120-122.]\r\n\r\n\"Not far from the hall in which the Congress was sitting there was a\r\npublic fete with a masked ball. Suddenly the door of the hall was\r\nthrown open and a clown rushed in madly pursued by a negro, revolver\r\nin hand. They stopped in the middle of the room fighting; the clown\r\nfell, the negro leapt upon him, fired, and then both rushed out of the\r\nhall. The whole incident hardly lasted twenty seconds.\r\n\r\n\"The President asked those present to write immediately a report since\r\nthere was sure to be a judicial inquiry. Forty reports were sent in.\r\nOnly one had less than 20% of mistakes in regard to the principal\r\nfacts; fourteen had 20% to 40% of mistakes; twelve from 40% to 50%;\r\nthirteen more than 50%. Moreover in twenty-four accounts 10% of the\r\ndetails were pure inventions and this proportion was exceeded in ten\r\naccounts and diminished in six. Briefly a quarter of the accounts were\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\n\"It goes without saying that the whole scene had been arranged and\r\neven photographed in advance. The ten false reports may then be\r\nrelegated to the category of tales and legends; twenty-four accounts\r\nare half legendary, and six have a value approximating to exact\r\nevidence.\"\r\n\r\nThus out of forty trained observers writing a responsible account of a\r\nscene that had just happened before their eyes, more than a majority\r\nsaw a scene that had not taken place. What then did they see? One\r\nwould suppose it was easier to tell what had occurred, than to invent\r\nsomething which had not occurred. They saw their stereotype of such a\r\nbrawl. All of them had in the course of their lives acquired a series\r\nof images of brawls, and these images flickered before their eyes. In\r\none man these images displaced less than 20% of the actual scene, in\r\nthirteen men more than half. In thirty-four out of the forty observers\r\nthe stereotypes preempted at least one-tenth of the scene.\r\n\r\nA distinguished art critic has said [Footnote: Bernard Berenson,\r\n_The Central Italian Painters of the Renaissance_, pp. 60, _et\r\nseq_.] that \"what with the almost numberless shapes assumed by an\r\nobject. ... What with our insensitiveness and inattention, things\r\nscarcely would have for us features and outlines so determined and\r\nclear that we could recall them at will, but for the stereotyped\r\nshapes art has lent them.\" The truth is even broader than that, for\r\nthe stereotyped shapes lent to the world come not merely from art, in\r\nthe sense of painting and sculpture and literature, but from our moral\r\ncodes and our social philosophies and our political agitations as\r\nwell. Substitute in the following passage of Mr. Berenson's the words\r\n'politics,' 'business,' and 'society,' for the word 'art' and the\r\nsentences will be no less true: \"... unless years devoted to the study\r\nof all schools of art have taught us also to see with our own eyes, we\r\nsoon fall into the habit of moulding whatever we look at into the\r\nforms borrowed from the one art with which we are acquainted. There is\r\nour standard of artistic reality. Let anyone give us shapes and colors\r\nwhich we cannot instantly match in our paltry stock of hackneyed forms\r\nand tints, and we shake our heads at his failure to reproduce things\r\nas we know they certainly are, or we accuse him of insincerity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Berenson speaks of our displeasure when a painter \"does not\r\nvisualize objects exactly as we do,\" and of the difficulty of\r\nappreciating the art of the Middle Ages because since then \"our manner\r\nof visualizing forms has changed in a thousand ways.\" [Footnote:\r\n_Cf._ also his comment on _Dante's Visual Images, and his Early\r\nIllustrators_ in _The Study and Criticism of Italian Art_ (First\r\nSeries), p. 13. \"_We_ cannot help dressing Virgil as a Roman,\r\nand giving him a 'classical profile' and 'statuesque carriage,' but\r\nDante's visual image of Virgil was probably no less mediaeval, no\r\nmore based on a critical reconstruction of antiquity, than his entire\r\nconception of the Roman poet. Fourteenth Century illustrators make\r\nVirgil look like a mediaeval scholar, dressed in cap and gown, and\r\nthere is no reason why Dante's visual image of him should have been\r\nother than this.\"] He goes on to show how in regard to the human\r\nfigure we have been taught to see what we do see. \"Created by\r\nDonatello and Masaccio, and sanctioned by the Humanists, the new canon\r\nof the human figure, the new cast of features ... presented to the\r\nruling classes of that time the type of human being most likely to win\r\nthe day in the combat of human forces... Who had the power to break\r\nthrough this new standard of vision and, out of the chaos of things,\r\nto select shapes more definitely expressive of reality than those\r\nfixed by men of genius? No one had such power. People had perforce to\r\nsee things in that way and in no other, and to see only the shapes\r\ndepicted, to love only the ideals presented....\" [Footnote: _The\r\nCentral Italian Painters_, pp. 66-67.]\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIf we cannot fully understand the acts of other people, until we know\r\nwhat they think they know, then in order to do justice we have to\r\nappraise not only the information which has been at their disposal,\r\nbut the minds through which they have filtered it. For the accepted\r\ntypes, the current patterns, the standard versions, intercept\r\ninformation on its way to consciousness. Americanization, for example,\r\nis superficially at least the substitution of American for European\r\nstereotypes. Thus the peasant who might see his landlord as if he were\r\nthe lord of the manor, his employer as he saw the local magnate, is\r\ntaught by Americanization to see the landlord and employer according\r\nto American standards. This constitutes a change of mind, which is, in\r\neffect, when the inoculation succeeds, a change of vision. His eye\r\nsees differently. One kindly gentlewoman has confessed that the\r\nstereotypes are of such overweening importance, that when hers are not\r\nindulged, she at least is unable to accept the brotherhood of man and\r\nthe fatherhood of God: \"we are strangely affected by the clothes we\r\nwear. Garments create a mental and social atmosphere. What can be\r\nhoped for the Americanism of a man who insists on employing a London\r\ntailor? One's very food affects his Americanism. What kind of American\r\nconsciousness can grow in the atmosphere of sauerkraut and Limburger\r\ncheese? Or what can you expect of the Americanism of the man whose\r\nbreath always reeks of garlic?\" [Footnote: Cited by Mr. Edward Hale\r\nBierstadt, _New Republic_, June 1 1921 p. 21.]\r\n\r\nThis lady might well have been the patron of a pageant which a friend\r\nof mine once attended. It was called the Melting Pot, and it was given\r\non the Fourth of July in an automobile town where many foreign-born\r\nworkers are employed. In the center of the baseball park at second\r\nbase stood a huge wooden and canvas pot. There were flights of steps\r\nup to the rim on two sides. After the audience had settled itself, and\r\nthe band had played, a procession came through an opening at one side\r\nof the field. It was made up of men of all the foreign nationalities\r\nemployed in the factories. They wore their native costumes, they were\r\nsinging their national songs; they danced their folk dances, and\r\ncarried the banners of all Europe. The master of ceremonies was the\r\nprincipal of the grade school dressed as Uncle Sam. He led them to the\r\npot. He directed them up the steps to the rim, and inside. He called\r\nthem out again on the other side. They came, dressed in derby hats,\r\ncoats, pants, vest, stiff collar and polka-dot tie, undoubtedly, said\r\nmy friend, each with an Eversharp pencil in his pocket, and all\r\nsinging the Star-Spangled Banner.\r\n\r\nTo the promoters of this pageant, and probably to most of the actors,\r\nit seemed as if they had managed to express the most intimate\r\ndifficulty to friendly association between the older peoples of\r\nAmerica and the newer. The contradiction of their stereotypes\r\ninterfered with the full recognition of their common humanity. The\r\npeople who change their names know this. They mean to change\r\nthemselves, and the attitude of strangers toward them.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, some connection between the scene outside and the\r\nmind through which we watch it, just as there are some long-haired men\r\nand short-haired women in radical gatherings. But to the hurried\r\nobserver a slight connection is enough. If there are two bobbed heads\r\nand four beards in the audience, it will be a bobbed and bearded\r\naudience to the reporter who knows beforehand that such gatherings are\r\ncomposed of people with these tastes in the management of their hair.\r\nThere is a connection between our vision and the facts, but it is\r\noften a strange connection. A man has rarely looked at a landscape,\r\nlet us say, except to examine its possibilities for division into\r\nbuilding lots, but he has seen a number of landscapes hanging in the\r\nparlor. And from them he has learned to think of a landscape as a rosy\r\nsunset, or as a country road with a church steeple and a silver moon.\r\nOne day he goes to the country, and for hours he does not see a single\r\nlandscape. Then the sun goes down looking rosy. At once he recognizes\r\na landscape and exclaims that it is beautiful. But two days later,\r\nwhen he tries to recall what he saw, the odds are that he will\r\nremember chiefly some landscape in a parlor.\r\n\r\nUnless he has been drunk or dreaming or insane he did see a sunset,\r\nbut he saw in it, and above all remembers from it, more of what the\r\noil painting taught him to observe, than what an impressionist\r\npainter, for example, or a cultivated Japanese would have seen and\r\ntaken away with him. And the Japanese and the painter in turn will\r\nhave seen and remembered more of the form they had learned, unless\r\nthey happen to be the very rare people who find fresh sight for\r\nmankind. In untrained observation we pick recognizable signs out of\r\nthe environment. The signs stand for ideas, and these ideas we fill\r\nout with our stock of images. We do not so much see this man and that\r\nsunset; rather we notice that the thing is man or sunset, and then see\r\nchiefly what our mind is already full of on those subjects.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThere is economy in this. For the attempt to see all things freshly\r\nand in detail, rather than as types and generalities, is exhausting,\r\nand among busy affairs practically out of the question. In a circle of\r\nfriends, and in relation to close associates or competitors, there is\r\nno shortcut through, and no substitute for, an individualized\r\nunderstanding. Those whom we love and admire most are the men and\r\nwomen whose consciousness is peopled thickly with persons rather than\r\nwith types, who know us rather than the classification into which we\r\nmight fit. For even without phrasing it to ourselves, we feel\r\nintuitively that all classification is in relation to some purpose not\r\nnecessarily our own; that between two human beings no association has\r\nfinal dignity in which each does not take the other as an end in\r\nhimself. There is a taint on any contact between two people which does\r\nnot affirm as an axiom the personal inviolability of both.\r\n\r\nBut modern life is hurried and multifarious, above all physical\r\ndistance separates men who are often in vital contact with each other,\r\nsuch as employer and employee, official and voter. There is neither\r\ntime nor opportunity for intimate acquaintance. Instead we notice a\r\ntrait which marks a well known type, and fill in the rest of the\r\npicture by means of the stereotypes we carry about in our heads. He is\r\nan agitator. That much we notice, or are told. Well, an agitator is\r\nthis sort of person, and so _he_ is this sort of person. He is an\r\nintellectual. He is a plutocrat. He is a foreigner. He is a \"South\r\nEuropean.\" He is from Back Bay. He is a Harvard Man. How different\r\nfrom the statement: he is a Yale Man. He is a regular fellow. He is a\r\nWest Pointer. He is an old army sergeant. He is a Greenwich Villager:\r\nwhat don't we know about him then, and about her? He is an\r\ninternational banker. He is from Main Street.\r\n\r\nThe subtlest and most pervasive of all influences ere those which\r\ncreate and maintain the repertory of stereotypes. We are told about\r\nthe world before we see it. We imagine most things before we\r\nexperience them. And those preconceptions, unless education has made\r\nus acutely aware, govern deeply the whole process of perception. They\r\nmark out certain objects as familiar or strange, emphasizing the\r\ndifference, so that the slightly familiar is seen as very familiar,\r\nand the somewhat strange as sharply alien. They are aroused by small\r\nsigns, which may vary from a true index to a vague analogy. Aroused,\r\nthey flood fresh vision with older images, and project into the world\r\nwhat has been resurrected in memory. Were there no practical\r\nuniformities in the environment, there would be no economy and only\r\nerror in the human habit of accepting foresight for sight. But there\r\nare uniformities sufficiently accurate, and the need of economizing\r\nattention is so inevitable, that the abandonment of all stereotypes\r\nfor a wholly innocent approach to experience would impoverish human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is the character of the stereotypes, and the gullibility\r\nwith which we employ them. And these in the end depend upon those\r\ninclusive patterns which constitute our philosophy of life. If in that\r\nphilosophy we assume that the world is codified according to a code\r\nwhich we possess, we are likely to make our reports of what is going\r\non describe a world run by our code. But if our philosophy tells us\r\nthat each man is only a small part of the world, that his intelligence\r\ncatches at best only phases and aspects in a coarse net of ideas,\r\nthen, when we use our stereotypes, we tend to know that they are only\r\nstereotypes, to hold them lightly, to modify them gladly. We tend,\r\nalso, to realize more and more clearly when our ideas started, where\r\nthey started, how they came to us, why we accepted them. All useful\r\nhistory is antiseptic in this fashion. It enables us to know what\r\nfairy tale, what school book, what tradition, what novel, play,\r\npicture, phrase, planted one preconception in this mind, another in\r\nthat mind.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThose who wish to censor art do not at least underestimate this\r\ninfluence. They generally misunderstand it, and almost always they are\r\nabsurdly bent on preventing other people from discovering anything not\r\nsanctioned by them. But at any rate, like Plato in his argument about\r\nthe poets, they feel vaguely that the types acquired through fiction\r\ntend to be imposed on reality. Thus there can be little doubt that the\r\nmoving picture is steadily building up imagery which is then evoked by\r\nthe words people read in their newspapers. In the whole experience of\r\nthe race there has been no aid to visualization comparable to the\r\ncinema. If a Florentine wished to visualize the saints, he could go to\r\nthe frescoes in his church, where he might see a vision of saints\r\nstandardized for his time by Giotto. If an Athenian wished to\r\nvisualize the gods he went to the temples. But the number of objects\r\nwhich were pictured was not great. And in the East, where the spirit\r\nof the second commandment was widely accepted, the portraiture of\r\nconcrete things was even more meager, and for that reason perhaps the\r\nfaculty of practical decision was by so much reduced. In the western\r\nworld, however, during the last few centuries there has been an\r\nenormous increase in the volume and scope of secular description, the\r\nword picture, the narrative, the illustrated narrative, and finally\r\nthe moving picture and, perhaps, the talking picture.\r\n\r\nPhotographs have the kind of authority over imagination to-day, which\r\nthe printed word had yesterday, and the spoken word before that. They\r\nseem utterly real. They come, we imagine, directly to us without human\r\nmeddling, and they are the most effortless food for the mind\r\nconceivable. Any description in words, or even any inert picture,\r\nrequires an effort of memory before a picture exists in the mind. But\r\non the screen the whole process of observing, describing, reporting,\r\nand then imagining, has been accomplished for you. Without more\r\ntrouble than is needed to stay awake the result which your imagination\r\nis always aiming at is reeled off on the screen. The shadowy idea\r\nbecomes vivid; your hazy notion, let us say, of the Ku Klux Klan,\r\nthanks to Mr. Griffiths, takes vivid shape when you see the Birth of a\r\nNation. Historically it may be the wrong shape, morally it may be a\r\npernicious shape, but it is a shape, and I doubt whether anyone who\r\nhas seen the film and does not know more about the Ku Klux Klan than\r\nMr. Griffiths, will ever hear the name again without seeing those\r\nwhite horsemen.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nAnd so when we speak of the mind of a group of people, of the French\r\nmind, the militarist mind, the bolshevik mind, we are liable to\r\nserious confusion unless we agree to separate the instinctive\r\nequipment from the stereotypes, the patterns, and the formulae which\r\nplay so decisive a part in building up the mental world to which the\r\nnative character is adapted and responds. Failure to make this\r\ndistinction accounts for oceans of loose talk about collective minds,\r\nnational souls, and race psychology. To be sure a stereotype may be so\r\nconsistently and authoritatively transmitted in each generation from\r\nparent to child that it seems almost like a biological fact. In some\r\nrespects, we may indeed have become, as Mr. Wallas says, [Footnote:\r\nGraham Wallas, _Our Social Heritage_, p. 17.] biologically\r\nparasitic upon our social heritage. But certainly there is not the\r\nleast scientific evidence which would enable anyone to argue that men\r\nare born with the political habits of the country in which they are\r\nborn. In so far as political habits are alike in a nation, the first\r\nplaces to look for an explanation are the nursery, the school, the\r\nchurch, not in that limbo inhabited by Group Minds and National Souls.\r\nUntil you have thoroughly failed to see tradition being handed on from\r\nparents, teachers, priests, and uncles, it is a solecism of the worst\r\norder to ascribe political differences to the germ plasm.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to generalize tentatively and with a decent humility\r\nabout comparative differences within the same category of education\r\nand experience. Yet even this is a tricky enterprise. For almost no\r\ntwo experiences are exactly alike, not even of two children in the\r\nsame household. The older son never does have the experience of being\r\nthe younger. And therefore, until we are able to discount the\r\ndifference in nurture, we must withhold judgment about differences of\r\nnature. As well judge the productivity of two soils by comparing their\r\nyield before you know which is in Labrador and which in Iowa, whether\r\nthey have been cultivated and enriched, exhausted, or allowed to run\r\nwild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSTEREOTYPES AS DEFENSE\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHERE is another reason, besides economy of effort, why we so often\r\nhold to our stereotypes when we might pursue a more disinterested\r\nvision. The systems of stereotypes may be the core of our personal\r\ntradition, the defenses of our position in society.\r\n\r\nThey are an ordered, more or less consistent picture of the world, to\r\nwhich our habits, our tastes, our capacities, our comforts and our\r\nhopes have adjusted themselves. They may not be a complete picture of\r\nthe world, but they are a picture of a possible world to which we are\r\nadapted. In that world people and things have their well-known places,\r\nand do certain expected things. We feel at home there. We fit in. We\r\nare members. We know the way around. There we find the charm of the\r\nfamiliar, the normal, the dependable; its grooves and shapes are where\r\nwe are accustomed to find them. And though we have abandoned much that\r\nmight have tempted us before we creased ourselves into that mould,\r\nonce we are firmly in, it fits as snugly as an old shoe.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that any disturbance of the stereotypes seems like an\r\nattack upon the foundations of the universe. It is an attack upon the\r\nfoundations of _our_ universe, and, where big things are at\r\nstake, we do not readily admit that there is any distinction between\r\nour universe and the universe. A world which turns out to be one in\r\nwhich those we honor are unworthy, and those we despise are noble, is\r\nnerve-racking. There is anarchy if our order of precedence is not the\r\nonly possible one. For if the meek should indeed inherit the earth, if\r\nthe first should be last, if those who are without sin alone may cast\r\na stone, if to Caesar you render only the things that are Caesar's,\r\nthen the foundations of self-respect would be shaken for those who\r\nhave arranged their lives as if these maxims were not true. A pattern\r\nof stereotypes is not neutral. It is not merely a way of substituting\r\norder for the great blooming, buzzing confusion of reality. It is not\r\nmerely a short cut. It is all these things and something more. It is\r\nthe guarantee of our self-respect; it is the projection upon the world\r\nof our own sense of our own value, our own position and our own\r\nrights. The stereotypes are, therefore, highly charged with the\r\nfeelings that are attached to them. They are the fortress of our\r\ntradition, and behind its defenses we can continue to feel ourselves\r\nsafe in the position we occupy.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhen, for example, in the fourth century B. C., Aristotle wrote his\r\ndefense of slavery in the face of increasing skepticism, [Footnote:\r\nZimmern: _Greek Commonwealth_. See his footnote, p. 383.] the\r\nAthenian slaves were in great part indistinguishable from free\r\ncitizens Mr. Zimmern quotes an amusing passage from the Old Oligarch\r\nexplaining the good treatment of the slaves. \"Suppose it were legal\r\nfor a slave to be beaten by a citizen, it would frequently happen that\r\nan Athenian might be mistaken for a slave or an alien and receive a\r\nbeating;--since the Athenian people is not better clothed than the\r\nslave or alien, nor in personal appearance is there any superiority.\"\r\nThis absence of distinction would naturally tend to dissolve the\r\ninstitution. If free men and slaves looked alike, what basis was there\r\nfor treating them so differently? It was this confusion which\r\nAristotle set himself to clear away in the first book of his Politics.\r\nWith unerring instinct he understood that to justify slavery he must\r\nteach the Greeks a way of _seeing_ their slaves that comported\r\nwith the continuance of slavery.\r\n\r\nSo, said Aristotle, there are beings who are slaves by nature.\r\n[Footnote: _Politics_, Bk. 1, Ch. 5.] \"He then is by nature\r\nformed a slave, who is fitted to become the chattel of another person,\r\n_and on that account is so_.\" All this really says is that\r\nwhoever happens to be a slave is by nature intended to be one.\r\nLogically the statement is worthless, but in fact it is not a\r\nproposition at all, and logic has nothing to do with it. It is a\r\nstereotype, or rather it is part of a stereotype. The rest follows\r\nalmost immediately. After asserting that slaves perceive reason, but\r\nare not endowed with the use of it, Aristotle insists that \"it is the\r\nintention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and free men\r\ndifferent from each other, that the one should be robust for their\r\nnecessary purposes, but the other erect; useless indeed for such\r\nservile labours, but fit for civil life... It is clear then that some\r\nmen are free by nature, and others are slaves. ...\"\r\n\r\nIf we ask ourselves what is the matter with Aristotle's argument, we\r\nfind that he has begun by erecting a great barrier between himself and\r\nthe facts. When he had said that those who are slaves are by nature\r\nintended to be slaves, he at one stroke excluded the fatal question\r\nwhether those particular men who happened to be slaves were the\r\nparticular men intended by nature to be slaves. For that question\r\nwould have tainted each case of slavery with doubt. And since the fact\r\nof being a slave was not evidence that a man was destined to be one,\r\nno certain test would have remained. Aristotle, therefore, excluded\r\nentirely that destructive doubt. Those who are slaves are intended to\r\nbe slaves. Each slave holder was to look upon his chattels as natural\r\nslaves. When his eye had been trained to see them that way, he was to\r\nnote as confirmation of their servile character the fact that they\r\nperformed servile work, that they were competent to do servile work,\r\nand that they had the muscles to do servile work.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect stereotype. Its hallmark is that it precedes the\r\nuse of reason; is a form of perception, imposes a certain character on\r\nthe data of our senses before the data reach the intelligence. The\r\nstereotype is like the lavender window-panes on Beacon Street, like\r\nthe door-keeper at a costume ball who judges whether the guest has an\r\nappropriate masquerade. There is nothing so obdurate to education or\r\nto criticism as the stereotype. It stamps itself upon the evidence in\r\nthe very act of securing the evidence. That is why the accounts of\r\nreturning travellers are often an interesting tale of what the\r\ntraveller carried abroad with him on his trip. If he carried chiefly\r\nhis appetite, a zeal for tiled bathrooms, a conviction that the\r\nPullman car is the acme of human comfort, and a belief that it is\r\nproper to tip waiters, taxicab drivers, and barbers, but under no\r\ncircumstances station agents and ushers, then his Odyssey will be\r\nreplete with good meals and bad meals, bathing adventures,\r\ncompartment-train escapades, and voracious demands for money. Or if he\r\nis a more serious soul he may while on tour have found himself at\r\ncelebrated spots. Having touched base, and cast one furtive glance at\r\nthe monument, he buried his head in Baedeker, read every word through,\r\nand moved on to the next celebrated spot; and thus returned with a\r\ncompact and orderly impression of Europe, rated one star, or two.\r\n\r\nIn some measure, stimuli from the outside, especially when they are\r\nprinted or spoken words, evoke some part of a system of stereotypes,\r\nso that the actual sensation and the preconception occupy\r\nconsciousness at the same time. The two are blended, much as if we\r\nlooked at red through blue glasses and saw green. If what we are\r\nlooking at corresponds successfully with what we anticipated, the\r\nstereotype is reinforced for the future, as it is in a man who knows\r\nin advance that the Japanese are cunning and has the bad luck to run\r\nacross two dishonest Japanese.\r\n\r\nIf the experience contradicts the stereotype, one of two things\r\nhappens. If the man is no longer plastic, or if some powerful interest\r\nmakes it highly inconvenient to rearrange his stereotypes, he pooh-\r\npoohs the contradiction as an exception that proves the rule,\r\ndiscredits the witness, finds a flaw somewhere, and manages to forget\r\nit. But if he is still curious and open-minded, the novelty is taken\r\ninto the picture, and allowed to modify it. Sometimes, if the incident\r\nis striking enough, and if he has felt a general discomfort with his\r\nestablished scheme, he may be shaken to such an extent as to distrust\r\nall accepted ways of looking at life, and to expect that normally a\r\nthing will not be what it is generally supposed to be. In the extreme\r\ncase, especially if he is literary, he may develop a passion for\r\ninverting the moral canon by making Judas, Benedict Arnold, or Caesar\r\nBorgia the hero of his tale.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe role played by the stereotype can be seen in the German tales\r\nabout Belgian snipers. Those tales curiously enough were first refuted\r\nby an organization of German Catholic priests known as Pax. [Footnote:\r\nFernand van Langenhove, _The Growth of a Legend._ The author is a\r\nBelgian sociologist.] The existence of atrocity stories is itself not\r\nremarkable, nor that the German people gladly believed them. But it is\r\nremarkable that a great conservative body of patriotic Germans should\r\nhave set out as early as August 16, 1914, to contradict a collection\r\nof slanders on the enemy, even though such slanders were of the utmost\r\nvalue in soothing the troubled conscience of their fellow countrymen.\r\nWhy should the Jesuit order in particular have set out to destroy a\r\nfiction so important to the fighting morale of Germany?\r\n\r\nI quote from M. van Langenhove's account:\r\n\r\n\"Hardly had the German armies entered Belgium when strange rumors\r\nbegan to circulate. They spread from place to place, they were\r\nreproduced by the press, and they soon permeated the whole of Germany.\r\nIt was said that the Belgian people, _instigated by the clergy,_\r\nhad intervened perfidiously in the hostilities; had attacked by\r\nsurprise isolated detachments; had indicated to the enemy the\r\npositions occupied by the troops; that old men, and even children, had\r\nbeen guilty of horrible atrocities upon wounded and defenseless German\r\nsoldiers, tearing out their eyes and cutting off fingers, nose or\r\nears; _that the priests from their pulpits had exhorted the people\r\nto commit these crimes, promising them as a reward the kingdom of\r\nheaven, and had even taken the lead in this barbarity._\r\n\r\n\"Public credulity accepted these stories. The highest powers in the\r\nstate welcomed them without hesitation and endorsed them with their\r\nauthority...\r\n\r\n\"In this way public opinion in Germany was disturbed and a lively\r\nindignation manifested itself, _directed especially against the\r\npriests_ who were held responsible for the barbarities attributed\r\nto the Belgians... By a natural diversion _the anger_ to which\r\nthey were a prey _was directed_ by the Germans _against the\r\nCatholic clergy generally._ Protestants allowed the old religious\r\nhatred to be relighted in their minds and delivered themselves to\r\nattacks against Catholics. A new _Kulturkampf_ was let loose.\r\n\r\n\"The Catholics did not delay in taking action against this hostile\r\nattitude.\" (Italics mine) [Footnote: _Op. cit._, pp. 5-7]\r\n\r\nThere may have been some sniping. It would be extraordinary if every\r\nangry Belgian had rushed to the library, opened a manual of\r\ninternational law, and had informed himself whether he had a right to\r\ntake potshot at the infernal nuisance tramping through his streets. It\r\nwould be no less extraordinary if an army that had never been under\r\nfire, did not regard every bullet that came its way as unauthorized,\r\nbecause it was inconvenient, and indeed as somehow a violation of the\r\nrules of the Kriegspiel, which then constituted its only experience of\r\nwar. One can imagine the more sensitive bent on convincing themselves\r\nthat the people to whom they were doing such terrible things must be\r\nterrible people. And so the legend may have been spun until it reached\r\nthe censors and propagandists, who, whether they believed it or not,\r\nsaw its value, and let it loose on the German civilians. They too were\r\nnot altogether sorry to find that the people they were outraging were\r\nsub-human. And, above all, since the legend came from their heroes,\r\nthey were not only entitled to believe it, they were unpatriotic if\r\nthey did not.\r\n\r\nBut where so much is left to the imagination because the scene of\r\naction is lost in the fog of war, there is no check and no control.\r\nThe legend of the ferocious Belgian priests soon tapped an old hatred.\r\nFor in the minds of most patriotic protestant Germans, especially of\r\nthe upper classes, the picture of Bismarck's victories included a long\r\nquarrel with the Roman Catholics. By a process of association, Belgian\r\npriests became priests, and hatred of Belgians a vent for all their\r\nhatreds. These German protestants did what some Americans did when\r\nunder the stress of war they created a compound object of hatred out\r\nof the enemy abroad and all their opponents at home. Against this\r\nsynthetic enemy, the Hun in Germany and the Hun within the Gate, they\r\nlaunched all the animosity that was in them.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic resistance to the atrocity tales was, of course,\r\ndefensive. It was aimed at those particular fictions which aroused\r\nanimosity against all Catholics, rather than against Belgian Catholics\r\nalone. The _Informations Pax_, says M. van Langenhove, had only\r\nan ecclesiastical bearing and \"confined their attention almost\r\nexclusively to the reprehensible acts attributed to the priests.\" And\r\nyet one cannot help wondering a little about what was set in motion in\r\nthe minds of German Catholics by this revelation of what Bismarck's\r\nempire meant in relation to them; and also whether there was any\r\nobscure connection between that knowledge and the fact that the\r\nprominent German politician who was willing in the armistice to sign\r\nthe death warrant of the empire was Erzberger, [Footnote: Since this\r\nwas written, Erzberger has been assassinated.] the leader of the\r\nCatholic Centre Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBLIND SPOTS AND THEIR VALUE\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nI HAVE been speaking of stereotypes rather than ideals, because the\r\nword ideal is usually reserved for what we consider the good, the true\r\nand the beautiful. Thus it carries the hint that here is something to\r\nbe copied or attained. But our repertory of fixed impressions is wider\r\nthan that. It contains ideal swindlers, ideal Tammany politicians,\r\nideal jingoes, ideal agitators, ideal enemies. Our stereotyped world\r\nis not necessarily the world we should like it to be. It is simply the\r\nkind of world we expect it to be. If events correspond there is a\r\nsense of familiarity, and we feel that we are moving with the movement\r\nof events. Our slave must be a slave by nature, if we are Athenians\r\nwho wish to have no qualms. If we have told our friends that we do\r\neighteen holes of golf in 95, we tell them after doing the course in\r\n110, that we are not ourselves to-day. That is to say, we are not\r\nacquainted with the duffer who foozled fifteen strokes.\r\n\r\nMost of us would deal with affairs through a rather haphazard and\r\nshifting assortment of stereotypes, if a comparatively few men in each\r\ngeneration were not constantly engaged in arranging, standardizing,\r\nand improving them into logical systems, known as the Laws of\r\nPolitical Economy, the Principles of Politics, and the like. Generally\r\nwhen we write about culture, tradition, and the group mind, we are\r\nthinking of these systems perfected by men of genius. Now there is no\r\ndisputing the necessity of constant study and criticism of these\r\nidealized versions, but the historian of people, the politician, and\r\nthe publicity man cannot stop there. For what operates in history is\r\nnot the systematic idea as a genius formulated it, but shifting\r\nimitations, replicas, counterfeits, analogies, and distortions in\r\nindividual minds.\r\n\r\nThus Marxism is not necessarily what Karl Marx wrote in Das Kapital,\r\nbut whatever it is that all the warring sects believe, who claim to be\r\nthe faithful. From the gospels you cannot deduce the history of\r\nChristianity, nor from the Constitution the political history of\r\nAmerica. It is Das Kapital as conceived, the gospels as preached and\r\nthe preachment as understood, the Constitution as interpreted and\r\nadministered, to which you have to go. For while there is a\r\nreciprocating influence between the standard version and the current\r\nversions, it is these current versions as distributed among men which\r\naffect their behavior. [Footnote: But unfortunately it is ever so much\r\nharder to know this actual culture than it is to summarize and to\r\ncomment upon the works of genius. The actual culture exists in people\r\nfar too busy to indulge in the strange trade of formulating their\r\nbeliefs. They record them only incidentally, and the student rarely\r\nknows how typical are his data. Perhaps the best he can do is to\r\nfollow Lord Bryce's suggestion [_Modern Democracies_, Vol. i, p.\r\n156] that he move freely \"among all sorts and conditions of men,\" to\r\nseek out the unbiassed persons in every neighborhood who have skill in\r\nsizing up. \"There is a _flair_ which long practise and 'sympathetic\r\ntouch' bestow. The trained observer learns how to profit by small\r\nindications, as an old seaman discerns, sooner than the landsman,\r\nthe signs of coming storm.\" There is, in short, a vast amount of\r\nguess work involved, and it is no wonder that scholars, who enjoy\r\nprecision, so often confine their attentions to the neater formulations\r\nof other scholars.]\r\n\r\n\"The theory of Relativity,\" says a critic whose eyelids, like the Lady\r\nLisa's, are a little weary, \"promises to develop into a principle as\r\nadequate to universal application as was the theory of Evolution. This\r\nlatter theory, from being a technical biological hypothesis, became an\r\ninspiring guide to workers in practically every branch of knowledge:\r\nmanners and customs, morals, religions, philosophies, arts, steam\r\nengines, electric tramways--everything had 'evolved.' 'Evolution'\r\nbecame a very general term; it also became imprecise until, in many\r\ncases, the original, definite meaning of the word was lost, and the\r\ntheory it had been evoked to describe was misunderstood. We are hardy\r\nenough to prophesy a similar career and fate for the theory of\r\nRelativity. The technical physical theory, at present imperfectly\r\nunderstood, will become still more vague and dim. History repeats\r\nitself, and Relativity, like Evolution, after receiving a number of\r\nintelligible but somewhat inaccurate popular expositions in its\r\nscientific aspect, will be launched on a world-conquering career. We\r\nsuggest that, by that time, it will probably be called _Relativismus_.\r\nMany of these larger applications will doubtless be justified; some will\r\nbe absurd and a considerable number will, we imagine, reduce to truisms.\r\nAnd the physical theory, the mere seed of this mighty growth, will become\r\nonce more the purely technical concern of scientific men.\" [Footnote:\r\n_The Times_ (London), _Literary Supplement_, June 2, 1921, p.\r\n352. Professor Einstein said when he was in America in 1921 that\r\npeople tended to overestimate the influence of his theory, and to\r\nunder-estimate its certainty.]\r\n\r\nBut for such a world-conquering career an idea must correspond,\r\nhowever imprecisely, to something. Professor Bury shows for how long a\r\ntime the idea of progress remained a speculative toy. \"It is not\r\neasy,\" he writes, [Footnote: J. B. Bury, _The Idea of Progress_,\r\np. 324.] \"for a new idea of the speculative order to penetrate and\r\ninform the general consciousness of a community until it has assumed\r\nsome external and concrete embodiment, or is recommended by some\r\nstriking material evidence. In the case of Progress both these\r\nconditions were fulfilled (in England) in the period 1820-1850.\" The\r\nmost striking evidence was furnished by the mechanical revolution.\r\n\"Men who were born at the beginning of the century had seen, before\r\nthey had passed the age of thirty, the rapid development of steam\r\nnavigation, the illumination of towns and houses by gas, the opening\r\nof the first railway.\" In the consciousness of the average householder\r\nmiracles like these formed the pattern of his belief in the\r\nperfectibility of the human race.\r\n\r\nTennyson, who was in philosophical matters a fairly normal person,\r\ntells us that when he went by the first train from Liverpool to\r\nManchester (1830) he thought that the wheels ran in grooves. Then he\r\nwrote this line:\r\n\r\n\"Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of\r\nchange.\" [Footnote: 2 Tennyson, _Memoir by his Son_, Vol. I, p.\r\n195. Cited by Bury, _op. cit_., p. 326.]\r\n\r\nAnd so a notion more or less applicable to a journey between Liverpool\r\nand Manchester was generalized into a pattern of the universe \"for\r\never.\" This pattern, taken up by others, reinforced by dazzling\r\ninventions, imposed an optimistic turn upon the theory of evolution.\r\nThat theory, of course, is, as Professor Bury says, neutral between\r\npessimism and optimism. But it promised continual change, and the\r\nchanges visible in the world marked such extraordinary conquests of\r\nnature, that the popular mind made a blend of the two. Evolution first\r\nin Darwin himself, and then more elaborately in Herbert Spencer, was a\r\n\"progress towards perfection.\"\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe stereotype represented by such words as \"progress\" and\r\n\"perfection\" was composed fundamentally of mechanical inventions. And\r\nmechanical it has remained, on the whole, to this day. In America more\r\nthan anywhere else, the spectacle of mechanical progress has made so\r\ndeep an impression, that it has suffused the whole moral code. An\r\nAmerican will endure almost any insult except the charge that he is\r\nnot progressive. Be he of long native ancestry, or a recent immigrant,\r\nthe aspect that has always struck his eye is the immense physical\r\ngrowth of American civilization. That constitutes a fundamental\r\nstereotype through which he views the world: the country village will\r\nbecome the great metropolis, the modest building a skyscraper, what is\r\nsmall shall be big; what is slow shall be fast; what is poor shall be\r\nrich; what is few shall be many; whatever is shall be more so.\r\n\r\nNot every American, of course, sees the world this way. Henry Adams\r\ndidn't, and William Allen White doesn't. But those men do, who in the\r\nmagazines devoted to the religion of success appear as Makers of\r\nAmerica. They mean just about that when they preach evolution,\r\nprogress, prosperity, being constructive, the American way of doing\r\nthings. It is easy to laugh, but, in fact, they are using a very great\r\npattern of human endeavor. For one thing it adopts an impersonal\r\ncriterion; for another it adopts an earthly criterion; for a third it\r\nis habituating men to think quantitatively. To be sure the ideal\r\nconfuses excellence with size, happiness with speed, and human nature\r\nwith contraption. Yet the same motives are at work which have ever\r\nactuated any moral code, or ever will. The desire for the biggest, the\r\nfastest, the highest, or if you are a maker of wristwatches or\r\nmicroscopes the smallest; the love in short of the superlative and the\r\n\"peerless,\" is in essence and possibility a noble passion.\r\n\r\nCertainly the American version of progress has fitted an extraordinary\r\nrange of facts in the economic situation and in human nature. It\r\nturned an unusual amount of pugnacity, acquisitiveness, and lust of\r\npower into productive work. Nor has it, until more recently perhaps,\r\nseriously frustrated the active nature of the active members of the\r\ncommunity. They have made a civilization which provides them who made\r\nit with what they feel to be ample satisfaction in work, mating and\r\nplay, and the rush of their victory over mountains, wildernesses,\r\ndistance, and human competition has even done duty for that part of\r\nreligious feeling which is a sense of communion with the purpose of\r\nthe universe. The pattern has been a success so nearly perfect in the\r\nsequence of ideals, practice, and results, that any challenge to it is\r\ncalled un-American.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, this pattern is a very partial and inadequate way of\r\nrepresenting the world. The habit of thinking about progress as\r\n\"development\" has meant that many aspects of the environment were\r\nsimply neglected. With the stereotype of \"progress\" before their eyes,\r\nAmericans have in the mass seen little that did not accord with that\r\nprogress. They saw the expansion of cities, but not the accretion of\r\nslums; they cheered the census statistics, but refused to consider\r\novercrowding; they pointed with pride to their growth, but would not\r\nsee the drift from the land, or the unassimilated immigration. They\r\nexpanded industry furiously at reckless cost to their natural\r\nresources; they built up gigantic corporations without arranging for\r\nindustrial relations. They grew to be one of the most powerful nations\r\non earth without preparing their institutions or their minds for the\r\nending of their isolation. They stumbled into the World War morally\r\nand physically unready, and they stumbled out again, much\r\ndisillusioned, but hardly more experienced.\r\n\r\nIn the World War the good and the evil influence of the American\r\nstereotype was plainly visible. The idea that the war could be won by\r\nrecruiting unlimited armies, raising unlimited credits, building an\r\nunlimited number of ships, producing unlimited munitions, and\r\nconcentrating without limit on these alone, fitted the traditional\r\nstereotype, and resulted in something like a physical miracle.\r\n[Footnote: I have in mind the transportation and supply of two million\r\ntroops overseas. Prof. Wesley Mitchell points out that the total\r\nproduction of goods after our entrance into the war did not greatly\r\nincrease in volume over that of the year 1916; but that production for\r\nwar purposes did increase.] But among those most affected by the\r\nstereotype, there was no place for the consideration of what the\r\nfruits of victory were, or how they were to be attained. Therefore,\r\naims were ignored, or regarded as automatic, and victory was\r\nconceived, because the stereotype demanded it, as nothing but an\r\nannihilating victory in the field. In peace time you did not ask what\r\nthe fastest motor car was for, and in war you did not ask what the\r\ncompletest victory was for. Yet in Paris the pattern did not fit the\r\nfacts. In peace you can go on endlessly supplanting small things with\r\nbig ones, and big ones with bigger ones; in war when you have won\r\nabsolute victory, you cannot go on to a more absolute victory. You\r\nhave to do something on an entirely different pattern. And if you lack\r\nsuch a pattern, the end of the war is to you what it was to so many\r\ngood people, an anticlimax in a dreary and savorless world.\r\n\r\nThis marks the point where the stereotype and the facts, that cannot\r\nbe ignored, definitely part company. There is always such a point,\r\nbecause our images of how things behave are simpler and more fixed\r\nthan the ebb and flow of affairs. There comes a time, therefore, when\r\nthe blind spots come from the edge of vision into the center. Then\r\nunless there are critics who have the courage to sound an alarm, and\r\nleaders capable of understanding the change, and a people tolerant by\r\nhabit, the stereotype, instead of economizing effort, and focussing\r\nenergy as it did in 1917 and 1918, may frustrate effort and waste\r\nmen's energy by blinding them, as it did for those people who cried\r\nfor a Carthaginian peace in 1919 and deplored the Treaty of Versailles\r\nin 1921.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nUncritically held, the stereotype not only censors out much that needs\r\nto be taken into account, but when the day of reckoning comes, and the\r\nstereotype is shattered, likely as not that which it did wisely take\r\ninto account is ship-wrecked with it. That is the punishment assessed\r\nby Mr. Bernard Shaw against Free Trade, Free Contract, Free\r\nCompetition, Natural Liberty, Laissez-faire, and Darwinism. A hundred\r\nyears ago, when he would surely have been one of the tartest advocates\r\nof these doctrines, he would not have seen them as he sees them\r\nto-day, in the Infidel Half Century, [Footnote: _Back to\r\nMethuselah_. Preface.] to be excuses for \"'doing the other fellow\r\ndown' with impunity, all interference by a guiding government, all\r\norganization except police organization to protect legalized fraud\r\nagainst fisticuffs, all attempt to introduce human purpose and design\r\nand forethought into the industrial welter being 'contrary to the laws\r\nof political economy'\" He would have seen, then, as one of the\r\npioneers of the march to the plains of heaven [Footnote: _The\r\nQuintessence of Ibsenism_] that, of the kind of human purpose and\r\ndesign and forethought to be found in a government like that of Queen\r\nVictoria's uncles, the less the better. He would have seen, not the\r\nstrong doing the weak down, but the foolish doing the strong down. He\r\nwould have seen purposes, designs and forethoughts at work,\r\nobstructing invention, obstructing enterprise, obstructing what he\r\nwould infallibly have recognized as the next move of Creative\r\nEvolution.\r\n\r\nEven now Mr. Shaw is none too eager for the guidance of any guiding\r\ngovernment he knows, but in theory he has turned a full loop against\r\nlaissez-faire. Most advanced thinking before the war had made the same\r\nturn against the established notion that if you unloosed everything,\r\nwisdom would bubble up, and establish harmony. Since the war, with its\r\ndefinite demonstration of guiding governments, assisted by censors,\r\npropagandists, and spies, Roebuck Ramsden and Natural Liberty have\r\nbeen readmitted to the company of serious thinkers.\r\n\r\nOne thing is common to these cycles. There is in each set of\r\nstereotypes a point where effort ceases and things happen of their own\r\naccord, as you would like them to. The progressive stereotype,\r\npowerful to incite work, almost completely obliterates the attempt to\r\ndecide what work and why that work. Laissez-faire, a blessed release\r\nfrom stupid officialdom, assumes that men will move by spontaneous\r\ncombustion towards a pre-established harmony. Collectivism, an\r\nantidote to ruthless selfishness, seems, in the Marxian mind, to\r\nsuppose an economic determinism towards efficiency and wisdom on the\r\npart of socialist officials. Strong government, imperialism at home\r\nand abroad, at its best deeply conscious of the price of disorder,\r\nrelies at last on the notion that all that matters to the governed\r\nwill be known by the governors. In each theory there is a spot of\r\nblind automatism.\r\n\r\nThat spot covers up some fact, which if it were taken into account,\r\nwould check the vital movement that the stereotype provokes. If the\r\nprogressive had to ask himself, like the Chinaman in the joke, what he\r\nwanted to do with the time he saved by breaking the record, if the\r\nadvocate of laissez-faire had to contemplate not only free and\r\nexuberant energies of men, but what some people call their human\r\nnature, if the collectivist let the center of his attention be\r\noccupied with the problem of how he is to secure his officials, if the\r\nimperialist dared to doubt his own inspiration, you would find more\r\nHamlet and less Henry the Fifth. For these blind spots keep away\r\ndistracting images, which with their attendant emotions, might cause\r\nhesitation and infirmity of purpose. Consequently the stereotype not\r\nonly saves time in a busy life and is a defense of our position in\r\nsociety, but tends to preserve us from all the bewildering effect of\r\ntrying to see the world steadily and see it whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCODES AND THEIR ENEMIES\r\n\r\nANYONE who has stood at the end of a railroad platform waiting for a\r\nfriend, will recall what queer people he mistook for him. The shape of\r\na hat, a slightly characteristic gait, evoked the vivid picture in his\r\nmind's eye. In sleep a tinkle may sound like the pealing of a great\r\nbell; the distant stroke of a hammer like a thunderclap. For our\r\nconstellations of imagery will vibrate to a stimulus that is perhaps\r\nbut vaguely similar to some aspect of them. They may, in\r\nhallucination, flood the whole consciousness. They may enter very\r\nlittle into perception, though I am inclined to think that such an\r\nexperience is extremely rare and highly sophisticated, as when we gaze\r\nblankly at a familiar word or object, and it gradually ceases to be\r\nfamiliar. Certainly for the most part, the way we see things is a\r\ncombination of what is there and of what we expected to find. The\r\nheavens are not the same to an astronomer as to a pair of lovers; a\r\npage of Kant will start a different train of thought in a Kantian and\r\nin a radical empiricist; the Tahitian belle is a better looking person\r\nto her Tahitian suitor than to the readers of the _National\r\nGeographic Magazine_.\r\n\r\nExpertness in any subject is, in fact, a multiplication of the number\r\nof aspects we are prepared to discover, plus the habit of discounting\r\nour expectations. Where to the ignoramus all things look alike, and\r\nlife is just one thing after another, to the specialist things are\r\nhighly individual. For a chauffeur, an epicure, a connoisseur, a\r\nmember of the President's cabinet, or a professor's wife, there are\r\nevident distinctions and qualities, not at all evident to the casual\r\nperson who discusses automobiles, wines, old masters, Republicans, and\r\ncollege faculties.\r\n\r\nBut in our public opinions few can be expert, while life is, as Mr.\r\nBernard Shaw has made plain, so short. Those who are expert are so on\r\nonly a few topics. Even among the expert soldiers, as we learned\r\nduring the war, expert cavalrymen were not necessarily brilliant with\r\ntrench-warfare and tanks. Indeed, sometimes a little expertness on a\r\nsmall topic may simply exaggerate our normal human habit of trying to\r\nsqueeze into our stereotypes all that can be squeezed, and of casting\r\ninto outer darkness that which does not fit.\r\n\r\nWhatever we recognize as familiar we tend, if we are not very careful,\r\nto visualize with the aid of images already in our mind. Thus in the\r\nAmerican view of Progress and Success there is a definite picture of\r\nhuman nature and of society. It is the kind of human nature and the\r\nkind of society which logically produce the kind of progress that is\r\nregarded as ideal. And then, when we seek to describe or explain\r\nactually successful men, and events that have really happened, we read\r\nback into them the qualities that are presupposed in the stereotypes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese qualities were standardized rather innocently by the older\r\neconomists. They set out to describe the social system under which\r\nthey lived, and found it too complicated for words. So they\r\nconstructed what they sincerely hoped was a simplified diagram, not so\r\ndifferent in principle and in veracity from the parallelogram with\r\nlegs and head in a child's drawing of a complicated cow. The scheme\r\nconsisted of a capitalist who had diligently saved capital from his\r\nlabor, an entrepreneur who conceived a socially useful demand and\r\norganized a factory, a collection of workmen who freely contracted,\r\ntake it or leave it, for their labor, a landlord, and a group of\r\nconsumers who bought in the cheapest market those goods which by the\r\nready use of the pleasure-pain calculus they knew would give them the\r\nmost pleasure. The model worked. The kind of people, which the model\r\nassumed, living in the sort of world the model assumed, invariably\r\ncoöperated harmoniously in the books where the model was described.\r\n\r\nWith modification and embroidery, this pure fiction, used by\r\neconomists to simplify their thinking, was retailed and popularized\r\nuntil for large sections of the population it prevailed as the\r\neconomic mythology of the day. It supplied a standard version of\r\ncapitalist, promoter, worker and consumer in a society that was\r\nnaturally more bent on achieving success than on explaining it. The\r\nbuildings which rose, and the bank accounts which accumulated, were\r\nevidence that the stereotype of how the thing had been done was\r\naccurate. And those who benefited most by success came to believe they\r\nwere the kind of men they were supposed to be. No wonder that the\r\ncandid friends of successful men, when they read the official\r\nbiography and the obituary, have to restrain themselves from asking\r\nwhether this is indeed their friend.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTo the vanquished and the victims, the official portraiture was, of\r\ncourse, unrecognizable. For while those who exemplified progress did\r\nnot often pause to inquire whether they had arrived according to the\r\nroute laid down by the economists, or by some other just as\r\ncreditable, the unsuccessful people did inquire. \"No one,\" says\r\nWilliam James, [Footnote: _The Letters of William James,_ Vol. I,\r\np.65] \"sees further into a generalization than his own knowledge of\r\ndetail extends.\" The captains of industry saw in the great trusts\r\nmonuments of (their) success; their defeated competitors saw the\r\nmonuments of (their) failure. So the captains expounded the economies\r\nand virtues of big business, asked to be let alone, said they were the\r\nagents of prosperity, and the developers of trade. The vanquished\r\ninsisted upon the wastes and brutalities of the trusts, and called\r\nloudly upon the Department of Justice to free business from\r\nconspiracies. In the same situation one side saw progress, economy,\r\nand a splendid development; the other, reaction, extravagance, and a\r\nrestraint of trade. Volumes of statistics, anecdotes about the real\r\ntruth and the inside truth, the deeper and the larger truth, were\r\npublished to prove both sides of the argument.\r\n\r\nFor when a system of stereotypes is well fixed, our attention is\r\ncalled to those facts which support it, and diverted from those which\r\ncontradict. So perhaps it is because they are attuned to find it, that\r\nkindly people discover so much reason for kindness, malicious people\r\nso much malice. We speak quite accurately of seeing through\r\nrose-colored spectacles, or with a jaundiced eye. If, as Philip\r\nLittell once wrote of a distinguished professor, we see life as\r\nthrough a class darkly, our stereotypes of what the best people and\r\nthe lower classes are like will not be contaminated by understanding.\r\nWhat is alien will be rejected, what is different will fall upon\r\nunseeing eyes. We do not see what our eyes are not accustomed to take\r\ninto account. Sometimes consciously, more often without knowing it, we\r\nare impressed by those facts which fit our philosophy.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThis philosophy is a more or less organized series of images for\r\ndescribing the unseen world. But not only for describing it. For\r\njudging it as well. And, therefore, the stereotypes are loaded with\r\npreference, suffused with affection or dislike, attached to fears,\r\nlusts, strong wishes, pride, hope. Whatever invokes the stereotype is\r\njudged with the appropriate sentiment. Except where we deliberately\r\nkeep prejudice in suspense, we do not study a man and judge him to be\r\nbad. We see a bad man. We see a dewy morn, a blushing maiden, a\r\nsainted priest, a humorless Englishman, a dangerous Red, a carefree\r\nbohemian, a lazy Hindu, a wily Oriental, a dreaming Slav, a volatile\r\nIrishman, a greedy Jew, a 100% American. In the workaday world that is\r\noften the real judgment, long in advance of the evidence, and it\r\ncontains within itself the conclusion which the evidence is pretty\r\ncertain to confirm. Neither justice, nor mercy, nor truth, enter into\r\nsuch a judgment, for the judgment has preceded the evidence. Yet a\r\npeople without prejudices, a people with altogether neutral vision, is\r\nso unthinkable in any civilization of which it is useful to think,\r\nthat no scheme of education could be based upon that ideal. Prejudice\r\ncan be detected, discounted, and refined, but so long as finite men\r\nmust compress into a short schooling preparation for dealing with a\r\nvast civilization, they must carry pictures of it around with them,\r\nand have prejudices. The quality of their thinking and doing will\r\ndepend on whether those prejudices are friendly, friendly to other\r\npeople, to other ideas, whether they evoke love of what is felt to be\r\npositively good, rather than hatred of what is not contained in their\r\nversion of the good.\r\n\r\nMorality, good taste and good form first standardize and then\r\nemphasize certain of these underlying prejudices. As we adjust\r\nourselves to our code, we adjust the facts we see to that code.\r\nRationally, the facts are neutral to all our views of right and wrong.\r\nActually, our canons determine greatly what we shall perceive and how.\r\n\r\nFor a moral code is a scheme of conduct applied to a number of typical\r\ninstances. To behave as the code directs is to serve whatever purpose\r\nthe code pursues. It may be God's will, or the king's, individual\r\nsalvation in a good, solid, three dimensional paradise, success on\r\nearth, or the service of mankind. In any event the makers of the code\r\nfix upon certain typical situations, and then by some form of\r\nreasoning or intuition, deduce the kind of behavior which would\r\nproduce the aim they acknowledge. The rules apply where they apply.\r\n\r\nBut in daily living how does a man know whether his predicament is the\r\none the law-giver had in mind? He is told not to kill. But if his\r\nchildren are attacked, may he kill to stop a killing? The Ten\r\nCommandments are silent on the point. Therefore, around every code\r\nthere is a cloud of interpreters who deduce more specific cases.\r\nSuppose, then, that the doctors of the law decide that he may kill in\r\nself-defense. For the next man the doubt is almost as great; how does\r\nhe know that he is defining self-defense correctly, or that he has not\r\nmisjudged the facts, imagined the attack, and is really the aggressor?\r\nPerhaps he has provoked the attack. But what is a provocation? Exactly\r\nthese confusions infected the minds of most Germans in August, 1914.\r\n\r\nFar more serious in the modern world than any difference of moral code\r\nis the difference in the assumptions about facts to which the code is\r\napplied. Religious, moral and political formulae are nothing like so\r\nfar apart as the facts assumed by their votaries. Useful discussion,\r\nthen, instead of comparing ideals, reexamines the visions of the\r\nfacts. Thus the rule that you should do unto others as you would have\r\nthem do unto you rests on the belief that human nature is uniform. Mr.\r\nBernard Shaw's statement that you should not do unto others what you\r\nwould have them do unto you, because their tastes may be different,\r\nrests on the belief that human nature is not uniform. The maxim that\r\ncompetition is the life of trade consists of a whole tome of\r\nassumptions about economic motives, industrial relations, and the\r\nworking of a particular commercial system. The claim that America will\r\nnever have a merchant marine, unless it is privately owned and\r\nmanaged, assumes a certain proved connection between a certain kind of\r\nprofit-making and incentive. The justification by the bolshevik\r\npropagandist of the dictatorship, espionage, and the terror, because\r\n\"every state is an apparatus of violence\" [Footnote: See _Two Years\r\nof Conflict on the Internal Front_, published by the Russian\r\nSocialist Federated Soviet Republic, Moscow, 1920. Translated by\r\nMalcolm W. Davis for the _New York Evening Post_, January 15,\r\n1921.] is an historical judgment, the truth of which is by no means\r\nself-evident to a non-communist.\r\n\r\nAt the core of every moral code there is a picture of human nature, a\r\nmap of the universe, and a version of history. To human nature (of the\r\nsort conceived), in a universe (of the kind imagined), after a history\r\n(so understood), the rules of the code apply. So far as the facts of\r\npersonality, of the environment and of memory are different, by so far\r\nthe rules of the code are difficult to apply with success. Now every\r\nmoral code has to conceive human psychology, the material world, and\r\ntradition some way or other. But in the codes that are under the\r\ninfluence of science, the conception is known to be an hypothesis,\r\nwhereas in the codes that come unexamined from the past or bubble up\r\nfrom the caverns of the mind, the conception is not taken as an\r\nhypothesis demanding proof or contradiction, but as a fiction accepted\r\nwithout question. In the one case, man is humble about his beliefs,\r\nbecause he knows they are tentative and incomplete; in the other he is\r\ndogmatic, because his belief is a completed myth. The moralist who\r\nsubmits to the scientific discipline knows that though he does not\r\nknow everything, he is in the way of knowing something; the dogmatist,\r\nusing a myth, believes himself to share part of the insight of\r\nomniscience, though he lacks the criteria by which to tell truth from\r\nerror. For the distinguishing mark of a myth is that truth and error,\r\nfact and fable, report and fantasy, are all on the same plane of\r\ncredibility.\r\n\r\nThe myth is, then, not necessarily false. It might happen to be wholly\r\ntrue. It may happen to be partly true. If it has affected human\r\nconduct a long time, it is almost certain to contain much that is\r\nprofoundly and importantly true. What a myth never contains is the\r\ncritical power to separate its truths from its errors. For that power\r\ncomes only by realizing that no human opinion, whatever its supposed\r\norigin, is too exalted for the test of evidence, that every opinion is\r\nonly somebody's opinion. And if you ask why the test of evidence is\r\npreferable to any other, there is no answer unless you are willing to\r\nuse the test in order to test it.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe statement is, I think, susceptible of overwhelming proof, that\r\nmoral codes assume a particular view of the facts. Under the term\r\nmoral codes I include all kinds: personal, family, economic,\r\nprofessional, legal, patriotic, international. At the center of each\r\nthere is a pattern of stereotypes about psychology, sociology, and\r\nhistory. The same view of human nature, institutions or tradition\r\nrarely persists through all our codes. Compare, for example, the\r\neconomic and the patriotic codes. There is a war supposed to affect\r\nall alike. Two men are partners in business. One enlists, the other\r\ntakes a war contract. The soldier sacrifices everything, perhaps even\r\nhis life. He is paid a dollar a day, and no one says, no one believes,\r\nthat you could make a better soldier out of him by any form of\r\neconomic incentive. That motive disappears out of his human nature.\r\nThe contractor sacrifices very little, is paid a handsome profit over\r\ncosts, and few say or believe that he would produce the munitions if\r\nthere were no economic incentive. That may be unfair to him. The point\r\nis that the accepted patriotic code assumes one kind of human nature,\r\nthe commercial code another. And the codes are probably founded on\r\ntrue expectations to this extent, that when a man adopts a certain\r\ncode he tends to exhibit the kind of human nature which the code\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nThat is one reason why it is so dangerous to generalize about human\r\nnature. A loving father can be a sour boss, an earnest municipal\r\nreformer, and a rapacious jingo abroad. His family life, his business\r\ncareer, his politics, and his foreign policy rest on totally different\r\nversions of what others are like and of how he should act. These\r\nversions differ by codes in the same person, the codes differ somewhat\r\namong persons in the same social set, differ widely as between social\r\nsets, and between two nations, or two colors, may differ to the point\r\nwhere there is no common assumption whatever. That is why people\r\nprofessing the same stock of religious beliefs can go to war. The\r\nelement of their belief which determines conduct is that view of the\r\nfacts which they assume.\r\n\r\nThat is where codes enter so subtly and so pervasively into the making\r\nof public opinion. The orthodox theory holds that a public opinion\r\nconstitutes a moral judgment on a group of facts. The theory I am\r\nsuggesting is that, in the present state of education, a public\r\nopinion is primarily a moralized and codified version of the facts. I\r\nam arguing that the pattern of stereotypes at the center of our codes\r\nlargely determines what group of facts we shall see, and in what light\r\nwe shall see them. That is why, with the best will in the world, the\r\nnews policy of a journal tends to support its editorial policy; why a\r\ncapitalist sees one set of facts, and certain aspects of human nature,\r\nliterally sees them; his socialist opponent another set and other\r\naspects, and why each regards the other as unreasonable or perverse,\r\nwhen the real difference between them is a difference of perception.\r\nThat difference is imposed by the difference between the capitalist\r\nand socialist pattern of stereotypes. \"There are no classes in\r\nAmerica,\" writes an American editor. \"The history of all hitherto\r\nexisting society is the history of class struggles,\" says the\r\nCommunist Manifesto. If you have the editor's pattern in your mind,\r\nyou will see vividly the facts that confirm it, vaguely and\r\nineffectively those that contradict. If you have the communist\r\npattern, you will not only look for different things, but you will see\r\nwith a totally different emphasis what you and the editor happen to\r\nsee in common.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nAnd since my moral system rests on my accepted version of the facts,\r\nhe who denies either my moral judgments or my version of the facts, is\r\nto me perverse, alien, dangerous. How shall I account for him? The\r\nopponent has always to be explained, and the last explanation that we\r\never look for is that he sees a different set of facts. Such an\r\nexplanation we avoid, because it saps the very foundation of our own\r\nassurance that we have seen life steadily and seen it whole. It is\r\nonly when we are in the habit of recognizing our opinions as a partial\r\nexperience seen through our stereotypes that we become truly tolerant\r\nof an opponent. Without that habit, we believe in the absolutism of\r\nour own vision, and consequently in the treacherous character of all\r\nopposition. For while men are willing to admit that there are two\r\nsides to a \"question,\" they do not believe that there are two sides to\r\nwhat they regard as a \"fact.\" And they never do believe it until after\r\nlong critical education, they are fully conscious of how second-hand\r\nand subjective is their apprehension of their social data.\r\n\r\nSo where two factions see vividly each its own aspect, and contrive\r\ntheir own explanations of what they see, it is almost impossible for\r\nthem to credit each other with honesty. If the pattern fits their\r\nexperience at a crucial point, they no longer look upon it as an\r\ninterpretation. They look upon it as \"reality.\" It may not resemble\r\nthe reality, except that it culminates in a conclusion which fits a\r\nreal experience. I may represent my trip from New York to Boston by a\r\nstraight line on a map, just as a man may regard his triumph as the\r\nend of a straight and narrow path. The road by which I actually went\r\nto Boston may have involved many detours, much turning and twisting,\r\njust as his road may have involved much besides pure enterprise, labor\r\nand thrift. But provided I reach Boston and he succeeds, the airline\r\nand the straight path will serve as ready made charts. Only when\r\nsomebody tries to follow them, and does not arrive, do we have to\r\nanswer objections. If we insist on our charts, and he insists on\r\nrejecting them, we soon tend to regard him as a dangerous fool, and he\r\nto regard us as liars and hypocrites. Thus we gradually paint\r\nportraits of each other. For the opponent presents himself as the man\r\nwho says, evil be thou my good. He is an annoyance who does not fit\r\ninto the scheme of things. Nevertheless he interferes. And since that\r\nscheme is based in our minds on incontrovertible fact fortified by\r\nirresistible logic, some place has to be found for him in the scheme.\r\nRarely in politics or industrial disputes is a place made for him by\r\nthe simple admission that he has looked upon the same reality and seen\r\nanother aspect of it. That would shake the whole scheme.\r\n\r\nThus to the Italians in Paris Fiume was Italian It was not merely a\r\ncity that it would be desirable to include within the Italian kingdom.\r\nIt was Italian. They fixed their whole mind upon the Italian majority\r\nwithin the legal boundaries of the city itself. The American\r\ndelegates, having seen more Italians in New York than there are in\r\nFiume, without regarding New York as Italian, fixed their eyes on\r\nFiume as a central European port of entry. They saw vividly the\r\nJugoslavs in the suburbs and the non-Italian hinterland. Some of the\r\nItalians in Paris were therefore in need of a convincing explanation\r\nof the American perversity. They found it in a rumor which started, no\r\none knows where, that an influential American diplomat was in the\r\nsnares of a Jugoslav mistress. She had been seen.... He had been\r\nseen.... At Versailles just off the boulevard. ... The villa with the\r\nlarge trees.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather common way of explaining away opposition. In their\r\nmore libelous form such charges rarely reach the printed page, and a\r\nRoosevelt may have to wait years, or a Harding months, before he can\r\nforce an issue, and end a whispering campaign that has reached into\r\nevery circle of talk. Public men have to endure a fearful amount of\r\npoisonous clubroom, dinner table, boudoir slander, repeated,\r\nelaborated, chuckled over, and regarded as delicious. While this sort\r\nof thing is, I believe, less prevalent in America than in Europe, yet\r\nrare is the American official about whom somebody is not repeating a\r\nscandal.\r\n\r\nOut of the opposition we make villains and conspiracies. If prices go\r\nup unmercifully the profiteers have conspired; if the newspapers\r\nmisrepresent the news, there is a capitalist plot; if the rich are too\r\nrich, they have been stealing; if a closely fought election is lost,\r\nthe electorate was corrupted; if a statesman does something of which\r\nyou disapprove, he has been bought or influenced by some discreditable\r\nperson. If workingmen are restless, they are the victims of agitators;\r\nif they are restless over wide areas, there is a conspiracy on foot.\r\nIf you do not produce enough aeroplanes, it is the work of spies; if\r\nthere is trouble in Ireland, it is German or Bolshevik \"gold.\" And if\r\nyou go stark, staring mad looking for plots, you see all strikes, the\r\nPlumb plan, Irish rebellion, Mohammedan unrest, the restoration of\r\nKing Constantine, the League of Nations, Mexican disorder, the\r\nmovement to reduce armaments, Sunday movies, short skirts, evasion of\r\nthe liquor laws, Negro self-assertion, as sub-plots under some\r\ngrandiose plot engineered either by Moscow, Rome, the Free Masons, the\r\nJapanese, or the Elders of Zion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE DETECTION OF STEREOTYPES\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nSkilled diplomatists, compelled to talk out loud to the warring\r\npeoples, learned how to use a large repertory of stereotypes. They\r\nwere dealing with a precarious alliance of powers, each of which was\r\nmaintaining its war unity only by the most careful leadership. The\r\nordinary soldier and his wife, heroic and selfless beyond anything in\r\nthe chronicles of courage, were still not heroic enough to face death\r\ngladly for all the ideas which were said by the foreign offices of\r\nforeign powers to be essential to the future of civilization. There\r\nwere ports, and mines, rocky mountain passes, and villages that few\r\nsoldiers would willingly have crossed No Man's Land to obtain for\r\ntheir allies.\r\n\r\nNow it happened in one nation that the war party which was in control\r\nof the foreign office, the high command, and most of the press, had\r\nclaims on the territory of several of its neighbors. These claims were\r\ncalled the Greater Ruritania by the cultivated classes who regarded\r\nKipling, Treitschke, and Maurice Barres as one hundred percent\r\nRuritanian. But the grandiose idea aroused no enthusiasm abroad. So\r\nholding this finest flower of the Ruritanian genius, as their poet\r\nlaureate said, to their hearts, Ruritania's statesmen went forth to\r\ndivide and conquer. They divided the claim into sectors. For each\r\npiece they invoked that stereotype which some one or more of their\r\nallies found it difficult to resist, because that ally had claims for\r\nwhich it hoped to find approval by the use of this same stereotype.\r\n\r\nThe first sector happened to be a mountainous region inhabited by\r\nalien peasants. Ruritania demanded it to complete her natural\r\ngeographical frontier. If you fixed your attention long enough on the\r\nineffable value of what is natural, those alien peasants just\r\ndissolved into fog, and only the slope of the mountains was visible.\r\nThe next sector was inhabited by Ruritanians, and on the principle\r\nthat no people ought to live under alien rule, they were re-annexed.\r\nThen came a city of considerable commercial importance, not inhabited\r\nby Ruritanians. But until the Eighteenth Century it had been part of\r\nRuritania, and on the principle of Historic Right it was annexed.\r\nFarther on there was a splendid mineral deposit owned by aliens and\r\nworked by aliens. On the principle of reparation for damage it was\r\nannexed. Beyond this there was a territory inhabited 97% by aliens,\r\nconstituting the natural geographical frontier of another nation,\r\nnever historically a part of Ruritania. But one of the provinces which\r\nhad been federated into Ruritania had formerly traded in those\r\nmarkets, and the upper class culture was Ruritanian. On the principle\r\nof cultural superiority and the necessity of defending civilization,\r\nthe lands were claimed. Finally, there was a port wholly disconnected\r\nfrom Ruritania geographically, ethnically, economically, historically,\r\ntraditionally. It was demanded on the ground that it was needed for\r\nnational defense.\r\n\r\nIn the treaties that concluded the Great War you can multiply examples\r\nof this kind. Now I do not wish to imply that I think it was possible\r\nto resettle Europe consistently on any one of these principles. I am\r\ncertain that it was not. The very use of these principles, so\r\npretentious and so absolute, meant that the spirit of accommodation\r\ndid not prevail and that, therefore, the substance of peace was not\r\nthere. For the moment you start to discuss factories, mines,\r\nmountains, or even political authority, as perfect examples of some\r\neternal principle or other, you are not arguing, you are fighting.\r\nThat eternal principle censors out all the objections, isolates the\r\nissue from its background and its context, and sets going in you some\r\nstrong emotion, appropriate enough to the principle, highly\r\ninappropriate to the docks, warehouses, and real estate. And having\r\nstarted in that mood you cannot stop. A real danger exists. To meet it\r\nyou have to invoke more absolute principles in order to defend what is\r\nopen to attack. Then you have to defend the defenses, erect buffers,\r\nand buffers for the buffers, until the whole affair is so scrambled\r\nthat it seems less dangerous to fight than to keep on talking.\r\n\r\nThere are certain clues which often help in detecting the false\r\nabsolutism of a stereotype. In the case of the Ruritanian propaganda\r\nthe principles blanketed each other so rapidly that one could readily\r\nsee how the argument had been constructed. The series of\r\ncontradictions showed that for each sector that stereotype was\r\nemployed which would obliterate all the facts that interfered with the\r\nclaim. Contradiction of this sort is often a good clue.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nInability to take account of space is another. In the spring of 1918,\r\nfor example, large numbers of people, appalled by the withdrawal of\r\nRussia, demanded the \"reestablishment of an Eastern Front.\" The war,\r\nas they had conceived it, was on two fronts, and when one of them\r\ndisappeared there was an instant demand that it be recreated. The\r\nunemployed Japanese army was to man the front, substituting for the\r\nRussian. But there was one insuperable obstacle. Between Vladivostok\r\nand the eastern battleline there were five thousand miles of country,\r\nspanned by one broken down railway. Yet those five thousand miles\r\nwould not stay in the minds of the enthusiasts. So overwhelming was\r\ntheir conviction that an eastern front was needed, and so great their\r\nconfidence in the valor of the Japanese army, that, mentally, they had\r\nprojected that army from Vladivostok to Poland on a magic carpet. In\r\nvain our military authorities argued that to land troops on the rim of\r\nSiberia had as little to do with reaching the Germans, as climbing\r\nfrom the cellar to the roof of the Woolworth building had to do with\r\nreaching the moon.\r\n\r\nThe stereotype in this instance was the war on two fronts. Ever since\r\nmen had begun to imagine the Great War they had conceived Germany held\r\nbetween France and Russia. One generation of strategists, and perhaps\r\ntwo, had lived with that visual image as the starting point of all\r\ntheir calculations. For nearly four years every battle-map they saw\r\nhad deepened the impression that this was the war. When affairs took a\r\nnew turn, it was not easy to see them as they were then. They were\r\nseen through the stereotype, and facts which conflicted with it, such\r\nas the distance from Japan to Poland, were incapable of coming vividly\r\ninto consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the American authorities dealt with the\r\nnew facts more realistically than the French. In part, this was\r\nbecause (previous to 1914) they had no preconception of a war upon the\r\ncontinent; in part because the Americans, engrossed in the\r\nmobilization of their forces, had a vision of the western front which\r\nwas itself a stereotype that excluded from _their_ consciousness\r\nany very vivid sense of the other theatres of war. In the spring of\r\n1918 this American view could not compete with the traditional French\r\nview, because while the Americans believed enormously in their own\r\npowers, the French at that time (before Cantigny and the Second Marne)\r\nhad the gravest doubts. The American confidence suffused the American\r\nstereotype, gave it that power to possess consciousness, that\r\nliveliness and sensible pungency, that stimulating effect upon the\r\nwill, that emotional interest as an object of desire, that congruity\r\nwith the activity in hand, which James notes as characteristic of what\r\nwe regard as \"real.\" [Footnote: _Principles of Psychology_, Vol.\r\nII, p. 300.] The French in despair remained fixed on their accepted\r\nimage. And when facts, gross geographical facts, would not fit with\r\nthe preconception, they were either censored out of mind, or the facts\r\nwere themselves stretched out of shape. Thus the difficulty of the\r\nJapanese reaching the Germans five thousand miles away was, in\r\nmeasure, overcome by bringing the Germans more than half way to meet\r\nthem. Between March and June 1918, there was supposed to be a German\r\narmy operating in Eastern Siberia. This phantom army consisted of some\r\nGerman prisoners actually seen, more German prisoners thought about,\r\nand chiefly of the delusion that those five thousand intervening miles\r\ndid not really exist. [Footnote: See in this connection Mr. Charles\r\nGrasty's interview with Marshal Foch, _New York Times_, February\r\n26, 1918. \"Germany is walking through Russia. America and Japan, who\r\nare in a position to do so, should go to meet her in Siberia.\" See\r\nalso the resolution by Senator King of Utah, June 10, 1918, and Mr.\r\nTaft's statement in the _New York Times_, June 11, 1918, and the\r\nappeal to America on May 5, 1918, by Mr. A. J. Sack, Director of the\r\nRussian Information Bureau: \"If Germany were in the Allied place...\r\nshe would have 3,000,000 fighting on the East front within a year.\"]\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nA true conception of space is not a simple matter. If I draw a\r\nstraight line on a map between Bombay and Hong Kong and measure the\r\ndistance, I have learned nothing whatever about the distance I should\r\nhave to cover on a voyage. And even if I measure the actual distance\r\nthat I must traverse, I still know very little until I know what ships\r\nare in the service, when they run, how fast they go, whether I can\r\nsecure accommodation and afford to pay for it. In practical life space\r\nis a matter of available transportation, not of geometrical planes, as\r\nthe old railroad magnate knew when he threatened to make grass grow in\r\nthe streets of a city that had offended him. If I am motoring and ask\r\nhow far it is to my destination, I curse as an unmitigated booby the\r\nman who tells me it is three miles, and does not mention a six mile\r\ndetour. It does me no good to be told that it is three miles if you\r\nwalk. I might as well be told it is one mile as the crow flies. I do\r\nnot fly like a crow, and I am not walking either. I must know that it\r\nis nine miles for a motor car, and also, if that is the case, that six\r\nof them are ruts and puddles. I call the pedestrian a nuisance who\r\ntells me it is three miles and think evil of the aviator who told me\r\nit was one mile. Both of them are talking about the space they have to\r\ncover, not the space I must cover.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing of boundary lines absurd complications have arisen\r\nthrough failure to conceive the practical geography of a region. Under\r\nsome general formula like self-determination statesmen have at various\r\ntimes drawn lines on maps, which, when surveyed on the spot, ran\r\nthrough the middle of a factory, down the center of a village street,\r\ndiagonally across the nave of a church, or between the kitchen and\r\nbedroom of a peasant's cottage. There have been frontiers in a grazing\r\ncountry which separated pasture from water, pasture from market, and\r\nin an industrial country, railheads from railroad. On the colored\r\nethnic map the line was ethnically just, that is to say, just in the\r\nworld of that ethnic map.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nBut time, no less than space, fares badly. A common example is that of\r\nthe man who tries by making an elaborate will to control his money\r\nlong after his death. \"It had been the purpose of the first William\r\nJames,\" writes his great-grandson Henry James, [Footnote: _The\r\nLetters of William James_, Vol. I, p. 6.] \"to provide that his\r\nchildren (several of whom were under age when he died) should qualify\r\nthemselves by industry and experience to enjoy the large patrimony\r\nwhich he expected to bequeath to them, and with that in view he left a\r\nwill which was a voluminous compound of restraints and instructions.\r\nHe showed thereby how great were both his confidence in his own\r\njudgment and his solicitude for the moral welfare of his descendants.\"\r\nThe courts upset the will. For the law in its objection to\r\nperpetuities recognizes that there are distinct limits to the\r\nusefulness of allowing anyone to impose his moral stencil upon an\r\nunknown future. But the desire to impose it is a very human trait, so\r\nhuman that the law permits it to operate for a limited time after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe amending clause of any constitution is a good index of the\r\nconfidence the authors entertained about the reach of their opinions\r\nin the succeeding generations. There are, I believe, American state\r\nconstitutions which are almost incapable of amendment. The men who\r\nmade them could have had but little sense of the flux of time: to them\r\nthe Here and Now was so brilliantly certain, the Hereafter so vague or\r\nso terrifying, that they had the courage to say how life should run\r\nafter they were gone. And then because constitutions are difficult to\r\namend, zealous people with a taste for mortmain have loved to write on\r\nthis imperishable brass all kinds of rules and restrictions that,\r\ngiven any decent humility about the future, ought to be no more\r\npermanent than an ordinary statute.\r\n\r\nA presumption about time enters widely into our opinions. To one\r\nperson an institution which has existed for the whole of his conscious\r\nlife is part of the permanent furniture of the universe: to another it\r\nis ephemeral. Geological time is very different from biological time.\r\nSocial time is most complex. The statesman has to decide whether to\r\ncalculate for the emergency or for the long run. Some decisions have\r\nto be made on the basis of what will happen in the next two hours;\r\nothers on what will happen in a week, a month, a season, a decade,\r\nwhen the children have grown up, or their children's children. An\r\nimportant part of wisdom is the ability to distinguish the\r\ntime-conception that properly belongs to the thing in hand. The person\r\nwho uses the wrong time-conception ranges from the dreamer who ignores\r\nthe present to the philistine who can see nothing else. A true scale\r\nof values has a very acute sense of relative time.\r\n\r\nDistant time, past and future, has somehow to be conceived. But as\r\nJames says, \"of the longer duration we have no direct 'realizing'\r\nsense.\" [Footnote: _Principles of Psychology_, Vol. I, p. 638.]\r\nThe longest duration which we immediately feel is what is called the\r\n\"specious present.\" It endures, according to Titchener, for about six\r\nseconds. [Footnote: Cited by Warren, _Human Psychology_, p. 255.]\r\n\"All impressions within this period of time are present to us _at\r\nonce_. This makes it possible for us to perceive changes and events\r\nas well as stationary objects. The perceptual present is supplemented\r\nby the ideational present. Through the combination of perceptions with\r\nmemory images, entire days, months, and even years of the past are\r\nbrought together into the present.\"\r\n\r\nIn this ideational present, vividness, as James said, is proportionate\r\nto the number of discriminations we perceive within it. Thus a\r\nvacation in which we were bored with nothing to do passes slowly while\r\nwe are in it, but seems very short in memory. Great activity kills\r\ntime rapidly, but in memory its duration is long. On the relation\r\nbetween the amount we discriminate and our time perspective James has\r\nan interesting passage: [Footnote: _Op. cit._, Vol. I, p. 639.]\r\n\r\n\"We have every reason to think that creatures may possibly differ\r\nenormously in the amounts of duration which they intuitively feel, and\r\nin the fineness of the events that may fill it. Von Baer has indulged\r\nin some interesting computations of the effect of such differences in\r\nchanging the aspect of Nature. Suppose we were able, within the length\r\nof a second, to note 10,000 events distinctly, instead of barely 10 as\r\nnow; [Footnote: In the moving picture this effect is admirably produced\r\nby the ultra-rapid camera.] if our life were then destined to hold the\r\nsame number of impressions, it might be 1000 times as short. We should\r\nlive less than a month, and personally know nothing of the change of\r\nseasons. If born in winter, we should believe in summer as we now\r\nbelieve in the heats of the carboniferous era. The motions of organic\r\nbeings would be so slow to our senses as to be inferred, not seen. The\r\nsun would stand still in the sky, the moon be almost free from change,\r\nand so on. But now reverse the hypothesis and suppose a being to get\r\nonly one 1000th part of the sensations we get in a given time, and\r\nconsequently to live 1000 times as long. Winters and summers will be\r\nto him like quarters of an hour. Mushrooms and the swifter growing\r\nplants will shoot into being so rapidly as to appear instantaneous\r\ncreations; annual shrubs will rise and fall from the earth like\r\nrestless boiling water springs; the motions of animals will be as\r\ninvisible as are to us the movements of bullets and cannon-balls; the\r\nsun will scour through the sky like a meteor, leaving a fiery trail\r\nbehind him, etc.\"\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nIn his Outline of History Mr. Wells has made a gallant effort to\r\nvisualize \"the true proportions of historical to geological time\"\r\n[Footnote: 1 Vol. II, p. 605. See also James Harvey Robinson, _The\r\nNew History,_ p. 239.] On a scale which represents the time from\r\nColumbus to ourselves by three inches of space, the reader would have\r\nto walk 55 feet to see the date of the painters of the Altamara caves,\r\n550 feet to see the earlier Neanderthalers, a mile or so to the last\r\nof the dinosaurs. More or less precise chronology does not begin until\r\nafter 1000 B.C., and at that time \"Sargon I of the Akkadian-Sumerian\r\nEmpire was a remote memory,... more remote than is Constantine the\r\nGreat from the world of the present day.... Hammurabi had been dead a\r\nthousand years... Stonehedge in England was already a thousand years\r\nold.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wells was writing with a purpose. \"In the brief period of ten\r\nthousand years these units (into which men have combined) have grown\r\nfrom the small family tribe of the early neolithic culture to the vast\r\nunited realms--vast yet still too small and partial--of the present\r\ntime.\" Mr. Wells hoped by changing the time perspective on our present\r\nproblems to change the moral perspective. Yet the astronomical measure\r\nof time, the geological, the biological, any telescopic measure which\r\nminimizes the present is not \"more true\" than a microscopic. Mr.\r\nSimeon Strunsky is right when he insists that \"if Mr. Wells is\r\nthinking of his subtitle, The Probable Future of Mankind, he is\r\nentitled to ask for any number of centuries to work out his solution.\r\nIf he is thinking of the salvaging of this western civilization,\r\nreeling under the effects of the Great War, he must think in decades\r\nand scores of years.\" [Footnote: In a review of _The Salvaging of\r\nCivilization, The Literary Review of the N. Y. Evening Post_, June\r\n18, 1921, p. 5.] It all depends upon the practical purpose for which\r\nyou adopt the measure. There are situations when the time perspective\r\nneeds to be lengthened, and others when it needs to be shortened.\r\n\r\nThe man who says that it does not matter if 15,000,000 Chinese die of\r\nfamine, because in two generations the birthrate will make up the\r\nloss, has used a time perspective to excuse his inertia. A person who\r\npauperizes a healthy young man because he is sentimentally\r\noverimpressed with an immediate difficulty has lost sight of the\r\nduration of the beggar's life. The people who for the sake of an\r\nimmediate peace are willing to buy off an aggressive empire by\r\nindulging its appetite have allowed a specious present to interfere\r\nwith the peace of their children. The people who will not be patient\r\nwith a troublesome neighbor, who want to bring everything to a\r\n\"showdown\" are no less the victims of a specious present.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nInto almost every social problem the proper calculation of time\r\nenters. Suppose, for example, it is a question of timber. Some trees\r\ngrow faster than others. Then a sound forest policy is one in which\r\nthe amount of each species and of each age cut in each season is made\r\ngood by replanting. In so far as that calculation is correct the\r\ntruest economy has been reached. To cut less is waste, and to cut more\r\nis exploitation. But there may come an emergency, say the need for\r\naeroplane spruce in a war, when the year's allowance must be exceeded.\r\nAn alert government will recognize that and regard the restoration of\r\nthe balance as a charge upon the future.\r\n\r\nCoal involves a different theory of time, because coal, unlike a tree,\r\nis produced on the scale of geological time. The supply is limited.\r\nTherefore a correct social policy involves intricate computation of\r\nthe available reserves of the world, the indicated possibilities, the\r\npresent rate of use, the present economy of use, and the alternative\r\nfuels. But when that computation has been reached it must finally be\r\nsquared with an ideal standard involving time. Suppose, for example,\r\nthat engineers conclude that the present fuels are being exhausted at\r\na certain rate; that barring new discoveries industry will have to\r\nenter a phase of contraction at some definite time in the future. We\r\nhave then to determine how much thrift and self-denial we will use,\r\nafter all feasible economies have been exercised, in order not to rob\r\nposterity. But what shall we consider posterity? Our grandchildren?\r\nOur great grandchildren? Perhaps we shall decide to calculate on a\r\nhundred years, believing that to be ample time for the discovery of\r\nalternative fuels if the necessity is made clear at once. The figures\r\nare, of course, hypothetical. But in calculating that way we shall be\r\nemploying what reason we have. We shall be giving social time its\r\nplace in public opinion. Let us now imagine a somewhat different case:\r\na contract between a city and a trolley-car company. The company says\r\nthat it will not invest its capital unless it is granted a monopoly of\r\nthe main highway for ninety-nine years. In the minds of the men who\r\nmake that demand ninety-nine years is so long as to mean \"forever.\"\r\nBut suppose there is reason to think that surface cars, run from a\r\ncentral power plant on tracks, are going out of fashion in twenty\r\nyears. Then it is a most unwise contract to make, for you are\r\nvirtually condemning a future generation to inferior transportation.\r\nIn making such a contract the city officials lack a realizing sense of\r\nninety-nine years. Far better to give the company a subsidy now in\r\norder to attract capital than to stimulate investment by indulging a\r\nfallacious sense of eternity. No city official and no company official\r\nhas a sense of real time when he talks about ninety-nine years.\r\n\r\nPopular history is a happy hunting ground of time confusions. To the\r\naverage Englishman, for example, the behavior of Cromwell, the\r\ncorruption of the Act of Union, the Famine of 1847 are wrongs suffered\r\nby people long dead and done by actors long dead with whom no living\r\nperson, Irish or English, has any real connection. But in the mind of\r\na patriotic Irishman these same events are almost contemporary. His\r\nmemory is like one of those historical paintings, where Virgil and\r\nDante sit side by side conversing. These perspectives and\r\nforeshortenings are a great barrier between peoples. It is ever so\r\ndifficult for a person of one tradition to remember what is\r\ncontemporary in the tradition of another.\r\n\r\nAlmost nothing that goes by the name of Historic Rights or Historic\r\nWrongs can be called a truly objective view of the past. Take, for\r\nexample, the Franco-German debate about Alsace-Lorraine. It all\r\ndepends on the original date you select. If you start with the Rauraci\r\nand Sequani, the lands are historically part of Ancient Gaul. If you\r\nprefer Henry I, they are historically a German territory; if you take\r\n1273 they belong to the House of Austria; if you take 1648 and the\r\nPeace of Westphalia, most of them are French; if you take Louis XIV\r\nand the year 1688 they are almost all French. If you are using the\r\nargument from history you are fairly certain to select those dates in\r\nthe past which support your view of what should be done now.\r\n\r\nArguments about \"races\" and nationalities often betray the same\r\narbitrary view of time. During the war, under the influence of\r\npowerful feeling, the difference between \"Teutons\" on the one hand,\r\nand \"Anglo-Saxons\" and French on the other, was popularly believed to\r\nbe an eternal difference. They had always been opposing races. Yet a\r\ngeneration ago, historians, like Freeman, were emphasizing the common\r\nTeutonic origin of the West European peoples, and ethnologists would\r\ncertainly insist that the Germans, English, and the greater part of\r\nthe French are branches of what was once a common stock. The general\r\nrule is: if you like a people to-day you come down the branches to the\r\ntrunk; if you dislike them you insist that the separate branches are\r\nseparate trunks. In one case you fix your attention on the period\r\nbefore they were distinguishable; in the other on the period after\r\nwhich they became distinct. And the view which fits the mood is taken\r\nas the \"truth.\"\r\n\r\nAn amiable variation is the family tree. Usually one couple are\r\nappointed the original ancestors, if possible, a couple associated\r\nwith an honorific event like the Norman Conquest. That couple have no\r\nancestors. They are not descendants. Yet they were the descendants of\r\nancestors, and the expression that So-and-So was the founder of his\r\nhouse means not that he is the Adam of his family, but that he is the\r\nparticular ancestor from whom it is desirable to start, or perhaps the\r\nearliest ancestor of which there is a record. But genealogical tables\r\nexhibit a deeper prejudice. Unless the female line happens to be\r\nespecially remarkable descent is traced down through the males. The\r\ntree is male. At various moments females accrue to it as itinerant\r\nbees light upon an ancient apple tree.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nBut the future is the most illusive time of all. Our temptation here\r\nis to jump over necessary steps in the sequence; and as we are\r\ngoverned by hope or doubt, to exaggerate or to minimize the time\r\nrequired to complete various parts of a process. The discussion of the\r\nrole to be exercised by wage-earners in the management of industry is\r\nriddled with this difficulty. For management is a word that covers\r\nmany functions. [Footnote: Cf. Carter L. Goodrich, The Frontier of\r\nControl.] Some of these require no training; some require a little\r\ntraining; others can be learned only in a lifetime. And the truly\r\ndiscriminating program of industrial democratization would be one\r\nbased on the proper time sequence, so that the assumption of\r\nresponsibility would run parallel to a complementary program of\r\nindustrial training. The proposal for a sudden dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat is an attempt to do away with the intervening time of\r\npreparation; the resistance to all sharing of responsibility an\r\nattempt to deny the alteration of human capacity in the course of\r\ntime. Primitive notions of democracy, such as rotation in office, and\r\ncontempt for the expert, are really nothing but the old myth that the\r\nGoddess of Wisdom sprang mature and fully armed from the brow of Jove.\r\nThey assume that what it takes years to learn need not be learned at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhenever the phrase \"backward people\" is used as the basis of a\r\npolicy, the conception of time is a decisive element. The Covenant of\r\nthe League of Nations says, [Footnote: Article XIX.] for example, that\r\n\"the character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of\r\nthe development of the people,\" as well as on other grounds. Certain\r\ncommunities, it asserts, \"have reached a stage of development\" where\r\ntheir independence can be provisionally recognized, subject to advice\r\nand assistance \"until such time as they are able to stand alone.\" The\r\nway in which the mandatories and the mandated conceive that time will\r\ninfluence deeply their relations. Thus in the case of Cuba the\r\njudgment of the American government virtually coincided with that of\r\nthe Cuban patriots, and though there has been trouble, there is no\r\nfiner page in the history of how strong powers have dealt with the\r\nweak. Oftener in that history the estimates have not coincided. Where\r\nthe imperial people, whatever its public expressions, has been deeply\r\nconvinced that the backwardness of the backward was so hopeless as not\r\nto be worth remedying, or so profitable that it was not desirable to\r\nremedy it, the tie has festered and poisoned the peace of the world.\r\nThere have been a few cases, very few, where backwardness has meant to\r\nthe ruling power the need for a program of forwardness, a program with\r\ndefinite standards and definite estimates of time. Far more\r\nfrequently, so frequently in fact as to seem the rule, backwardness\r\nhas been conceived as an intrinsic and eternal mark of inferiority.\r\nAnd then every attempt to be less backward has been frowned upon as\r\nthe sedition, which, under these conditions, it undoubtedly is. In our\r\nown race wars we can see some of the results of the failure to realize\r\nthat time would gradually obliterate the slave morality of the Negro,\r\nand that social adjustment based on this morality would begin to break\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIt is hard not to picture the future as if it obeyed our present\r\npurposes, to annihilate whatever delays our desire, or immortalize\r\nwhatever stands between us and our fears.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nIn putting together our public opinions, not only do we have to\r\npicture more space than we can see with our eyes, and more time than\r\nwe can feel, but we have to describe and judge more people, more\r\nactions, more things than we can ever count, or vividly imagine. We\r\nhave to summarize and generalize. We have to pick out samples, and\r\ntreat them as typical.\r\n\r\nTo pick fairly a good sample of a large class is not easy. The problem\r\nbelongs to the science of statistics, and it is a most difficult\r\naffair for anyone whose mathematics is primitive, and mine remain\r\nazoic in spite of the half dozen manuals which I once devoutly\r\nimagined that I understood. All they have done for me is to make me a\r\nlittle more conscious of how hard it is to classify and to sample, how\r\nreadily we spread a little butter over the whole universe.\r\n\r\nSome time ago a group of social workers in Sheffield, England, started\r\nout to substitute an accurate picture of the mental equipment of the\r\nworkers of that city for the impressionistic one they had. [Footnote:\r\n_The Equipment of the Worker_.] They wished to say, with some\r\ndecent grounds for saying it, how the workers of Sheffield were\r\nequipped. They found, as we all find the moment we refuse to let our\r\nfirst notion prevail, that they were beset with complications. Of the\r\ntest they employed nothing need be said here except that it was a\r\nlarge questionnaire. For the sake of the illustration, assume that the\r\nquestions were a fair test of mental equipment for English city life.\r\nTheoretically, then, those questions should have been put to every\r\nmember of the working class. But it is not so easy to know who are the\r\nworking class. However, assume again that the census knows how to\r\nclassify them. Then there were roughly 104,000 men and 107,000 women\r\nwho ought to have been questioned. They possessed the answers which\r\nwould justify or refute the casual phrase about the \"ignorant workers\"\r\nor the \"intelligent workers.\" But nobody could think of questioning\r\nthe whole two hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nSo the social workers consulted an eminent statistician, Professor\r\nBowley. He advised them that not less than 408 men and 408 women would\r\nprove to be a fair sample. According to mathematical calculation this\r\nnumber would not show a greater deviation from the average than 1 in\r\n22. [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 65.] They had, therefore, to\r\nquestion at least 816 people before they could pretend to talk about\r\nthe average workingman. But which 816 people should they approach? \"We\r\nmight have gathered particulars concerning workers to whom one or\r\nanother of us had a pre-inquiry access; we might have worked through\r\nphilanthropic gentlemen and ladies who were in contact with certain\r\nsections of workers at a club, a mission, an infirmary, a place of\r\nworship, a settlement. But such a method of selection would produce\r\nentirely worthless results. The workers thus selected would not be in\r\nany sense representative of what is popularly called 'the average run\r\nof workers;' they would represent nothing but the little coteries to\r\nwhich they belonged.\r\n\r\n\"The right way of securing 'victims,' to which at immense cost of time\r\nand labour we rigidly adhered, is to get hold of your workers by some\r\n'neutral' or 'accidental' or 'random' method of approach.\" This they\r\ndid. And after all these precautions they came to no more definite\r\nconclusion than that on their classification and according to their\r\nquestionnaire, among 200,000 Sheffield workers \"about one quarter\"\r\nwere \"well equipped,\" \"approaching three-quarters\" were \"inadequately\r\nequipped\" and that \"about one-fifteenth\" were \"mal-equipped.\"\r\n\r\nCompare this conscientious and almost pedantic method of arriving at\r\nan opinion, with our usual judgments about masses of people, about the\r\nvolatile Irish, and the logical French, and the disciplined Germans,\r\nand the ignorant Slavs, and the honest Chinese, and the untrustworthy\r\nJapanese, and so on and so on. All these are generalizations drawn\r\nfrom samples, but the samples are selected by a method that\r\nstatistically is wholly unsound. Thus the employer will judge labor by\r\nthe most troublesome employee or the most docile that he knows, and\r\nmany a radical group has imagined that it was a fair sample of the\r\nworking class. How many women's views on the \"servant question\" are\r\nlittle more than the reflection of their own treatment of their\r\nservants? The tendency of the casual mind is to pick out or stumble\r\nupon a sample which supports or defies its prejudices, and then to\r\nmake it the representative of a whole class.\r\n\r\nA great deal of confusion arises when people decline to classify\r\nthemselves as we have classified them. Prophecy would be so much\r\neasier if only they would stay where we put them. But, as a matter of\r\nfact, a phrase like the working class will cover only some of the\r\ntruth for a part of the time. When you take all the people, below a\r\ncertain level of income, and call them the working class, you cannot\r\nhelp assuming that the people so classified will behave in accordance\r\nwith your stereotype. Just who those people are you are not quite\r\ncertain. Factory hands and mine workers fit in more or less, but farm\r\nhands, small farmers, peddlers, little shop keepers, clerks, servants,\r\nsoldiers, policemen, firemen slip out of the net. The tendency, when\r\nyou are appealing to the \"working class,\" is to fix your attention on\r\ntwo or three million more or less confirmed trade unionists, and treat\r\nthem as Labor; the other seventeen or eighteen million, who might\r\nqualify statistically, are tacitly endowed with the point of view\r\nascribed to the organized nucleus. How very misleading it was to\r\nimpute to the British working class in 1918-1921 the point of view\r\nexpressed in the resolutions of the Trades Union Congress or in the\r\npamphlets written by intellectuals.\r\n\r\nThe stereotype of Labor as Emancipator selects the evidence which\r\nsupports itself and rejects the other. And so parallel with the real\r\nmovements of working men there exists a fiction of the Labor Movement,\r\nin which an idealized mass moves towards an ideal goal. The fiction\r\ndeals with the future. In the future possibilities are almost\r\nindistinguishable from probabilities and probabilities from\r\ncertainties. If the future is long enough, the human will might turn\r\nwhat is just conceivable into what is very likely, and what is likely\r\ninto what is sure to happen. James called this the faith ladder, and\r\nsaid that \"it is a slope of goodwill on which in the larger questions\r\nof life men habitually live.\" [Footnote: William James, _Some\r\nProblems of Philosophy_, p. 224.]\r\n\r\n\"1. There is nothing absurd in a certain view of the world being true,\r\nnothing contradictory;\r\n\r\n2. It _might_ have been true under certain conditions;\r\n\r\n3. It _may_ be true even now;\r\n\r\n4. It is _fit_ to be true;\r\n\r\n5. It _ought_ to be true;\r\n\r\n6. It _must_ be true;\r\n\r\n7. It _shall_ be true, at any rate true for me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he added in another place, [Footnote: _A Pluralistic\r\nUniverse_, p. 329.] \"your acting thus may in certain special cases\r\nbe a means of making it securely true in the end.\" Yet no one would\r\nhave insisted more than he, that, so far as we know how, we must avoid\r\nsubstituting the goal for the starting point, must avoid reading back\r\ninto the present what courage, effort and skill might create in the\r\nfuture. Yet this truism is inordinately difficult to live by, because\r\nevery one of us is so little trained in the selection of our samples.\r\n\r\nIf we believe that a certain thing ought to be true, we can almost\r\nalways find either an instance where it is true, or someone who\r\nbelieves it ought to be true. It is ever so hard when a concrete fact\r\nillustrates a hope to weigh that fact properly. When the first six\r\npeople we meet agree with us, it is not easy to remember that they may\r\nall have read the same newspaper at breakfast. And yet we cannot send\r\nout a questionnaire to 816 random samples every time we wish to\r\nestimate a probability. In dealing with any large mass of facts, the\r\npresumption is against our having picked true samples, if we are\r\nacting on a casual impression.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nAnd when we try to go one step further in order to seek the causes and\r\neffects of unseen and complicated affairs, haphazard opinion is very\r\ntricky. There are few big issues in public life where cause and effect\r\nare obvious at once. They are not obvious to scholars who have devoted\r\nyears, let us say, to studying business cycles, or price and wage\r\nmovements, or the migration and the assimilation of peoples, or the\r\ndiplomatic purposes of foreign powers. Yet somehow we are all supposed\r\nto have opinions on these matters, and it is not surprising that the\r\ncommonest form of reasoning is the intuitive, post hoc ergo propter\r\nhoc.\r\n\r\nThe more untrained a mind, the more readily it works out a theory that\r\ntwo things which catch its attention at the same time are causally\r\nconnected. We have already dwelt at some length on the way things\r\nreach our attention. We have seen that our access to information is\r\nobstructed and uncertain, and that our apprehension is deeply\r\ncontrolled by our stereotypes; that the evidence available to our\r\nreason is subject to illusions of defense, prestige, morality, space,\r\ntime, and sampling. We must note now that with this initial taint,\r\npublic opinions are still further beset, because in a series of events\r\nseen mostly through stereotypes, we readily accept sequence or\r\nparallelism as equivalent to cause and effect.\r\n\r\nThis is most likely to happen when two ideas that come together arouse\r\nthe same feeling. If they come together they are likely to arouse the\r\nsame feeling; and even when they do not arrive together a powerful\r\nfeeling attached to one is likely to suck out of all the corners of\r\nmemory any idea that feels about the same. Thus everything painful\r\ntends to collect into one system of cause and effect, and likewise\r\neverything pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"IId IIm (1675) This day I hear that G[od] has shot an arrow into the\r\nmidst of this Town. The small pox is in an ordinary ye sign of the\r\nSwan, the ordinary Keepers name is Windsor. His daughter is sick of\r\nthe disease. It is observable that this disease begins at an alehouse,\r\nto testify God's displeasure agt the sin of drunkenness & yt of\r\nmultiplying alehouses!\" [Footnote: _The Heart of the Puritan_, p.\r\n177, edited by Elizabeth Deering Hanscom.]\r\n\r\nThus Increase Mather, and thus in the year 1919 a distinguished\r\nProfessor of Celestial Mechanics discussing the Einstein theory:\r\n\r\n\"It may well be that.... Bolshevist uprisings are in reality the\r\nvisible objects of some underlying, deep, mental disturbance,\r\nworld-wide in character.... This same spirit of unrest has invaded\r\nscience.\" [Footnote: Cited in _The New Republic_, Dec. 24, 1919,\r\np. 120.]\r\n\r\nIn hating one thing violently, we readily associate with it as cause\r\nor effect most of the other things we hate or fear violently. They may\r\nhave no more connection than smallpox and alehouses, or Relativity and\r\nBolshevism, but they are bound together in the same emotion. In a\r\nsuperstitious mind, like that of the Professor of Celestial Mechanics,\r\nemotion is a stream of molten lava which catches and imbeds whatever\r\nit touches. When you excavate in it you find, as in a buried city, all\r\nsorts of objects ludicrously entangled in each other. Anything can be\r\nrelated to anything else, provided it feels like it. Nor has a mind in\r\nsuch a state any way of knowing how preposterous it is. Ancient fears,\r\nreinforced by more recent fears, coagulate into a snarl of fears where\r\nanything that is dreaded is the cause of anything else that is\r\ndreaded.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nGenerally it all culminates in the fabrication of a system of all\r\nevil, and of another which is the system of all good. Then our love of\r\nthe absolute shows itself. For we do not like qualifying\r\nadverbs. [Footnote: _Cf_. Freud's discussion of absolutism in\r\ndreams, _Interpretation of Dreams_, Chapter VI, especially pp.\r\n288, _et seq_.] They clutter up sentences, and interfere with\r\nirresistible feeling. We prefer most to more, least to less, we\r\ndislike the words rather, perhaps, if, or, but, toward, not quite,\r\nalmost, temporarily, partly. Yet nearly every opinion about public\r\naffairs needs to be deflated by some word of this sort. But in our\r\nfree moments everything tends to behave absolutely,--one hundred\r\npercent, everywhere, forever.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to say that our side is more right than the enemy's,\r\nthat our victory will help democracy more than his. One must insist\r\nthat our victory will end war forever, and make the world safe for\r\ndemocracy. And when the war is over, though we have thwarted a greater\r\nevil than those which still afflict us, the relativity of the result\r\nfades out, the absoluteness of the present evil overcomes our spirit,\r\nand we feel that we are helpless because we have not been\r\nirresistible. Between omnipotence and impotence the pendulum swings.\r\n\r\nReal space, real time, real numbers, real connections, real weights\r\nare lost. The perspective and the background and the dimensions of\r\naction are clipped and frozen in the stereotype.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nINTERESTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. THE ENLISTING OF INTEREST\r\n   \"    12. SELF-INTEREST RECONSIDERED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ENLISTING OF INTEREST\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBUT the human mind is not a film which registers once and for all each\r\nimpression that comes through its shutters and lenses. The human mind\r\nis endlessly and persistently creative. The pictures fade or combine,\r\nare sharpened here, condensed there, as we make them more completely\r\nour own. They do not lie inert upon the surface of the mind, but are\r\nreworked by the poetic faculty into a personal expression of\r\nourselves. We distribute the emphasis and participate in the action.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this we tend to personalize quantities, and to\r\ndramatize relations. As some sort of allegory, except in acutely\r\nsophisticated minds, the affairs of the world are represented. Social\r\nMovements, Economic Forces, National Interests, Public Opinion are\r\ntreated as persons, or persons like the Pope, the President, Lenin,\r\nMorgan or the King become ideas and institutions. The deepest of all\r\nthe stereotypes is the human stereotype which imputes human nature to\r\ninanimate or collective things.\r\n\r\nThe bewildering variety of our impressions, even after they have been\r\ncensored in all kinds of ways, tends to force us to adopt the greater\r\neconomy of the allegory. So great is the multitude of things that we\r\ncannot keep them vividly in mind. Usually, then, we name them, and let\r\nthe name stand for the whole impression. But a name is porous. Old\r\nmeanings slip out and new ones slip in, and the attempt to retain the\r\nfull meaning of the name is almost as fatiguing as trying to recall\r\nthe original impressions. Yet names are a poor currency for thought.\r\nThey are too empty, too abstract, too inhuman. And so we begin to see\r\nthe name through some personal stereotype, to read into it, finally to\r\nsee in it the incarnation of some human quality.\r\n\r\nYet human qualities are themselves vague and fluctuating. They are\r\nbest remembered by a physical sign. And therefore, the human qualities\r\nwe tend to ascribe to the names of our impressions, themselves tend to\r\nbe visualized in physical metaphors. The people of England, the\r\nhistory of England, condense into England, and England becomes John\r\nBull, who is jovial and fat, not too clever, but well able to take\r\ncare of himself. The migration of a people may appear to some as the\r\nmeandering of a river, and to others like a devastating flood. The\r\ncourage people display may be objectified as a rock; their purpose as\r\na road, their doubts as forks of the road, their difficulties as ruts\r\nand rocks, their progress as a fertile valley. If they mobilize their\r\ndread-naughts they unsheath a sword. If their army surrenders they are\r\nthrown to earth. If they are oppressed they are on the rack or under\r\nthe harrow.\r\n\r\nWhen public affairs are popularized in speeches, headlines, plays,\r\nmoving pictures, cartoons, novels, statues or paintings, their\r\ntransformation into a human interest requires first abstraction from\r\nthe original, and then animation of what has been abstracted. We\r\ncannot be much interested in, or much moved by, the things we do not\r\nsee. Of public affairs each of us sees very little, and therefore,\r\nthey remain dull and unappetizing, until somebody, with the makings of\r\nan artist, has translated them into a moving picture. Thus the\r\nabstraction, imposed upon our knowledge of reality by all the\r\nlimitations of our access and of our prejudices, is compensated. Not\r\nbeing omnipresent and omniscient we cannot see much of what we have to\r\nthink and talk about. Being flesh and blood we will not feed on words\r\nand names and gray theory. Being artists of a sort we paint pictures,\r\nstage dramas and draw cartoons out of the abstractions.\r\n\r\nOr, if possible, we find gifted men who can visualize for us. For\r\npeople are not all endowed to the same degree with the pictorial\r\nfaculty. Yet one may, I imagine, assert with Bergson that the\r\npractical intelligence is most closely adapted to spatial\r\nqualities. [Footnote: _Creative Evolution_, Chs. III, IV.] A\r\n\"clear\" thinker is almost always a good visualizer. But for that same\r\nreason, because he is \"cinematographic,\" he is often by that much\r\nexternal and insensitive. For the people who have intuition, which is\r\nprobably another name for musical or muscular perception, often\r\nappreciate the quality of an event and the inwardness of an act far\r\nbetter than the visualizer. They have more understanding when the\r\ncrucial element is a desire that is never crudely overt, and appears\r\non the surface only in a veiled gesture, or in a rhythm of speech.\r\nVisualization may catch the stimulus and the result. But the\r\nintermediate and internal is often as badly caricatured by a\r\nvisualizer, as is the intention of the composer by an enormous soprano\r\nin the sweet maiden's part.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though they have often a peculiar justice, intuitions\r\nremain highly private and largely incommunicable. But social\r\nintercourse depends on communication, and while a person can often\r\nsteer his own life with the utmost grace by virtue of his intuitions,\r\nhe usually has great difficulty in making them real to others. When he\r\ntalks about them they sound like a sheaf of mist. For while intuition\r\ndoes give a fairer perception of human feeling, the reason with its\r\nspatial and tactile prejudice can do little with that perception.\r\nTherefore, where action depends on whether a number of people are of\r\none mind, it is probably true that in the first instance no idea is\r\nlucid for practical decision until it has visual or tactile value. But\r\nit is also true, that no visual idea is significant to us until it has\r\nenveloped some stress of our own personality. Until it releases or\r\nresists, depresses or enhances, some craving of our own, it remains\r\none of the objects which do not matter.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nPictures have always been the surest way of conveying an idea, and\r\nnext in order, words that call up pictures in memory. But the idea\r\nconveyed is not fully our own until we have identified ourselves with\r\nsome aspect of the picture. The identification, or what Vernon Lee has\r\ncalled empathy, [Footnote: _Beauty and Ugliness_.] may be almost\r\ninfinitely subtle and symbolic. The mimicry may be performed without\r\nour being aware of it, and sometimes in a way that would horrify those\r\nsections of our personality which support our self-respect. In\r\nsophisticated people the participation may not be in the fate of the\r\nhero, but in the fate of the whole idea to which both hero and villain\r\nare essential. But these are refinements.\r\n\r\nIn popular representation the handles for identification are almost\r\nalways marked. You know who the hero is at once. And no work promises\r\nto be easily popular where the marking is not definite and the choice\r\nclear. [Footnote: A fact which bears heavily on the character of news.\r\n_Cf_. Part VII.] But that is not enough. The audience must have\r\nsomething to do, and the contemplation of the true, the good and the\r\nbeautiful is not something to do. In order not to sit inertly in the\r\npresence of the picture, and this applies as much to newspaper stories\r\nas to fiction and the cinema, the audience must be exercised by the\r\nimage. Now there are two forms of exercise which far transcend all\r\nothers, both as to ease with which they are aroused, and eagerness\r\nwith which stimuli for them are sought. They are sexual passion and\r\nfighting, and the two have so many associations with each other, blend\r\ninto each other so intimately, that a fight about sex outranks every\r\nother theme in the breadth of its appeal. There is none so engrossing\r\nor so careless of all distinctions of culture and frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe sexual motif figures hardly at all in American political imagery.\r\nExcept in certain minor ecstasies of war, in an occasional scandal, or\r\nin phases of the racial conflict with Negroes or Asiatics, to speak of\r\nit at all would seem far-fetched. Only in moving pictures, novels, and\r\nsome magazine fiction are industrial relations, business competition,\r\npolitics, and diplomacy tangled up with the girl and the other woman.\r\nBut the fighting motif appears at every turn. Politics is interesting\r\nwhen there is a fight, or as we say, an issue. And in order to make\r\npolitics popular, issues have to be found, even when in truth and\r\njustice, there are none,--none, in the sense that the differences of\r\njudgment, or principle, or fact, do not call for the enlistment of\r\npugnacity. [Footnote: _Cf_. Frances Taylor Patterson, _Cinema\r\nCraftsmanship_, pp. 31-32. \"III. If the plot lacks suspense: 1. Add\r\nan antagonist, 2. Add an obstacle, 3. Add a problem, 4. Emphasize one\r\nof the questions in the minds of the spectator.,..\"]\r\n\r\nBut where pugnacity is not enlisted, those of us who are not directly\r\ninvolved find it hard to keep up our interest. For those who are\r\ninvolved the absorption may be real enough to hold them even when no\r\nissue is involved. They may be exercised by sheer joy in activity, or\r\nby subtle rivalry or invention. But for those to whom the whole\r\nproblem is external and distant, these other faculties do not easily\r\ncome into play. In order that the faint image of the affair shall mean\r\nsomething to them, they must be allowed to exercise the love of\r\nstruggle, suspense, and victory.\r\n\r\nMiss Patterson [Footnote: _Op. cit._, pp. 6-7.] insists that\r\n\"suspense... constitutes the difference between the masterpieces in\r\nthe Metropolitan Museum of Art and the pictures at the Rivoli or the\r\nRialto Theatres.\" Had she made it clear that the masterpieces lack\r\neither an easy mode of identification or a theme popular for this\r\ngeneration, she would be wholly right in saying that this \"explains\r\nwhy the people straggle into the Metropolitan by twos and threes and\r\nstruggle into the Rialto and Rivoli by hundreds. The twos and threes\r\nlook at a picture in the Art Museum for less than ten minutes--unless\r\nthey chance to be art students, critics, or connoisseurs. The hundreds\r\nin the Rivoli or the Rialto look at the picture for more than an hour.\r\nAs far as beauty is concerned there can be no comparison of the merits\r\nof the two pictures. Yet the motion picture draws more people and\r\nholds them at attention longer than do the masterpieces, not through\r\nany intrinsic merit of its own, but because it depicts unfolding\r\nevents, the outcome of which the audience is breathlessly waiting. It\r\npossesses the element of struggle, which never fails to arouse\r\nsuspense.\"\r\n\r\nIn order then that the distant situation shall not be a gray flicker\r\non the edge of attention, it should be capable of translation into\r\npictures in which the opportunity for identification is recognizable.\r\nUnless that happens it will interest only a few for a little while. It\r\nwill belong to the sights seen but not felt, to the sensations that\r\nbeat on our sense organs, and are not acknowledged. We have to take\r\nsides. We have to be able to take sides. In the recesses of our being\r\nwe must step out of the audience on to the stage, and wrestle as the\r\nhero for the victory of good over evil. We must breathe into the\r\nallegory the breath of our life.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAnd so, in spite of the critics, a verdict is rendered in the old\r\ncontroversy about realism and romanticism. Our popular taste is to\r\nhave the drama originate in a setting realistic enough to make\r\nidentification plausible and to have it terminate in a setting\r\nromantic enough to be desirable, but not so romantic as to be\r\ninconceivable. In between the beginning and the end the canons are\r\nliberal, but the true beginning and the happy ending are landmarks.\r\nThe moving picture audience rejects fantasy logically developed,\r\nbecause in pure fantasy there is no familiar foothold in the age of\r\nmachines. It rejects realism relentlessly pursued because it does not\r\nenjoy defeat in a struggle that has become its own.\r\n\r\nWhat will be accepted as true, as realistic, as good, as evil, as\r\ndesirable, is not eternally fixed. These are fixed by stereotypes,\r\nacquired from earlier experiences and carried over into judgment of\r\nlater ones. And, therefore, if the financial investment in each film\r\nand in popular magazines were not so exorbitant as to require instant\r\nand widespread popularity, men of spirit and imagination would be able\r\nto use the screen and the periodical, as one might dream of their\r\nbeing used, to enlarge and to refine, to verify and criticize the\r\nrepertory of images with which our imaginations work. But, given the\r\npresent costs, the men who make moving pictures, like the church and\r\nthe court painters of other ages, must adhere to the stereotypes that\r\nthey find, or pay the price of frustrating expectation. The\r\nstereotypes can be altered, but not in time to guarantee success when\r\nthe film is released six months from now.\r\n\r\nThe men who do alter the stereotypes, the pioneering artists and\r\ncritics, are naturally depressed and angered at managers and editors\r\nwho protect their investments. They are risking everything, then why\r\nnot the others? That is not quite fair, for in their righteous fury\r\nthey have forgotten their own rewards, which are beyond any that their\r\nemployers can hope to feel. They could not, and would not if they\r\ncould, change places. And they have forgotten another thing in the\r\nunceasing war with Philistia. They have forgotten that they are\r\nmeasuring their own success by standards that artists and wise men of\r\nthe past would never have dreamed of invoking. They are asking for\r\ncirculations and audiences that were never considered by any artist\r\nuntil the last few generations. And when they do not get them, they\r\nare disappointed.\r\n\r\nThose who catch on, like Sinclair Lewis in \"Main Street,\" are men who\r\nhave succeeded in projecting definitely what great numbers of other\r\npeople were obscurely trying to say inside their heads. \"You have said\r\nit for me.\" They establish a new form which is then endlessly copied\r\nuntil it, too, becomes a stereotype of perception. The next pioneer\r\nfinds it difficult to make the public see Main Street any other way.\r\nAnd he, like the forerunners of Sinclair Lewis, has a quarrel with the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThis quarrel is due not only to the conflict of stereotypes, but to\r\nthe pioneering artist's reverence for his material. Whatever the plane\r\nhe chooses, on that plane he remains. If he is dealing with the\r\ninwardness of an event he follows it to its conclusion regardless of\r\nthe pain it causes. He will not tag his fantasy to help anyone, or cry\r\npeace where there is no peace. There is his America. But big audiences\r\nhave no stomach for such severity. They are more interested in\r\nthemselves than in anything else in the world. The selves in which\r\nthey are interested are the selves that have been revealed by schools\r\nand by tradition. They insist that a work of art shall be a vehicle\r\nwith a step where they can climb aboard, and that they shall ride, not\r\naccording to the contours of the country, but to a land where for an\r\nhour there are no clocks to punch and no dishes to wash. To satisfy\r\nthese demands there exists an intermediate class of artists who are\r\nable and willing to confuse the planes, to piece together a\r\nrealistic-romantic compound out of the inventions of greater men, and,\r\nas Miss Patterson advises, give \"what real life so rarely does-the\r\ntriumphant resolution of a set of difficulties; the anguish of virtue\r\nand the triumph of sin... changed to the glorifications of virtue and\r\nthe eternal punishment of its enemy.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p.\r\n46. \"The hero and heroine must in general possess youth, beauty,\r\ngoodness, exalted self-sacrifice, and unalterable constancy.\"]\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe ideologies of politics obey these rules. The foothold of realism\r\nis always there. The picture of some real evil, such as the German\r\nthreat or class conflict, is recognizable in the argument. There is a\r\ndescription of some aspect of the world which is convincing because it\r\nagrees with familiar ideas. But as the ideology deals with an unseen\r\nfuture, as well as with a tangible present, it soon crosses\r\nimperceptibly the frontier of verification. In describing the present\r\nyou are more or less tied down to common experience. In describing\r\nwhat nobody has experienced you are bound to let go. You stand at\r\nArmageddon, more or less, but you battle for the Lord, perhaps.... A\r\ntrue beginning, true according to the standards prevailing, and a\r\nhappy ending. Every Marxist is hard as nails about the brutalities of\r\nthe present, and mostly sunshine about the day after the dictatorship.\r\nSo were the war propagandists: there was not a bestial quality in\r\nhuman nature they did not find everywhere east of the Rhine, or west\r\nof it if they were Germans. The bestiality was there all right. But\r\nafter the victory, eternal peace. Plenty of this is quite cynically\r\ndeliberate. For the skilful propagandist knows that while you must\r\nstart with a plausible analysis, you must not keep on analyzing,\r\nbecause the tedium of real political accomplishment will soon destroy\r\ninterest. So the propagandist exhausts the interest in reality by a\r\ntolerably plausible beginning, and then stokes up energy for a long\r\nvoyage by brandishing a passport to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe formula works when the public fiction enmeshes itself with a\r\nprivate urgency. But once enmeshed, in the heat of battle, the\r\noriginal self and the original stereotype which effected the junction\r\nmay be wholly lost to sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSELF-INTEREST RECONSIDERED\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHEREFORE, the identical story is not the same story to all who hear\r\nit. Each will enter it at a slightly different point, since no two\r\nexperiences are exactly alike; he will reenact it in his own way, and\r\ntransfuse it with his own feelings. Sometimes an artist of compelling\r\nskill will force us to enter into lives altogether unlike our own,\r\nlives that seem at first glance dull, repulsive, or eccentric. But\r\nthat is rare. In almost every story that catches our attention we\r\nbecome a character and act out the role with a pantomime of our own.\r\nThe pantomime may be subtle or gross, may be sympathetic to the story,\r\nor only crudely analogous; but it will consist of those feelings which\r\nare aroused by our conception of the role. And so, the original theme\r\nas it circulates, is stressed, twisted, and embroidered by all the\r\nminds through which it goes. It is as if a play of Shakespeare's were\r\nrewritten each time it is performed with all the changes of emphasis\r\nand meaning that the actors and audience inspired.\r\n\r\nSomething very like that seems to have happened to the stories in the\r\nsagas before they were definitively written down. In our time the\r\nprinted record, such as it is, checks the exuberance of each\r\nindividual's fancy. But against rumor there is little or no checks and\r\nthe original story, true or invented, grows wings and horns, hoofs and\r\nbeaks, as the artist in each gossip works upon it. The first\r\nnarrator's account does not keep its shape and proportions. It is\r\nedited and revised by all who played with it as they heard it, used it\r\nfor day dreams, and passed it on. [Footnote: For an interesting\r\nexample, see the case described by C. J. Jung, _Zentralblatt für\r\nPsychoanalyse_, 1911, Vol. I, p. 81. Translated by Constance Long,\r\nin _Analytical Psychology_, Ch. IV.]\r\n\r\nConsequently the more mixed the audience, the greater will be the\r\nvariation in the response. For as the audience grows larger, the\r\nnumber of common words diminishes. Thus the common factors in the\r\nstory become more abstract. This story, lacking precise character of\r\nits own, is heard by people of highly varied character. They give it\r\ntheir own character.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe character they give it varies not only with sex and age, race and\r\nreligion and social position, but within these cruder classifications,\r\naccording to the inherited and acquired constitution of the\r\nindividual, his faculties, his career, the progress of his career, an\r\nemphasized aspect of his career, his moods and tenses, or his place on\r\nthe board in any of the games of life that he is playing. What reaches\r\nhim of public affairs, a few lines of print, some photographs,\r\nanecdotes, and some casual experience of his own, he conceives through\r\nhis set patterns and recreates with his own emotions. He does not take\r\nhis personal problems as partial samples of the greater environment.\r\nHe takes his stories of the greater environment as a mimic enlargement\r\nof his private life.\r\n\r\nBut not necessarily of that private life as he would describe it to\r\nhimself. For in his private life the choices are narrow, and much of\r\nhimself is squeezed down and out of sight where it cannot directly\r\ngovern his outward behavior. And thus, beside the more average people\r\nwho project the happiness of their own lives into a general good will,\r\nor their unhappiness into suspicion and hate, there are the outwardly\r\nhappy people who are brutal everywhere but in their own circle, as\r\nwell as the people who, the more they detest their families, their\r\nfriends, their jobs, the more they overflow with love for mankind.\r\n\r\nAs you descend from generalities to detail, it becomes more apparent\r\nthat the character in which men deal with their affairs is not fixed.\r\nPossibly their different selves have a common stem and common\r\nqualities, but the branches and the twigs have many forms. Nobody\r\nconfronts every situation with the same character. His character\r\nvaries in some degree through the sheer influence of time and\r\naccumulating memory, since he is not an automaton. His character\r\nvaries, not only in time, but according to circumstance. The legend of\r\nthe solitary Englishman in the South Seas, who invariably shaves and\r\nputs on a black tie for dinner, bears witness to his own intuitive and\r\ncivilized fear of losing the character which he has acquired. So do\r\ndiaries, and albums, and souvenirs, old letters, and old clothes, and\r\nthe love of unchanging routine testify to our sense of how hard it is\r\nto step twice in the Heraclitan river.\r\n\r\nThere is no one self always at work. And therefore it is of great\r\nimportance in the formation of any public opinion, what self is\r\nengaged. The Japanese ask the right to settle in California. Clearly\r\nit makes a whole lot of difference whether you conceive the demand as\r\na desire to grow fruit or to marry the white man's daughter. If two\r\nnations are disputing a piece of territory, it matters greatly whether\r\nthe people regard the negotiations as a real estate deal, an attempt\r\nto humiliate them, or, in the excited and provocative language which\r\nusually enclouds these arguments, as a rape. For the self which takes\r\ncharge of the instincts when we are thinking about lemons or distant\r\nacres is very different from the self which appears when we are\r\nthinking even potentially as the outraged head of a family. In one\r\ncase the private feeling which enters into the opinion is tepid, in\r\nthe other, red hot. And so while it is so true as to be mere tautology\r\nthat \"self-interest\" determines opinion, the statement is not\r\nilluminating, until we know which self out of many selects and directs\r\nthe interest so conceived.\r\n\r\nReligious teaching and popular wisdom have always distinguished\r\nseveral personalities in each human being. They have been called the\r\nHigher and Lower, the Spiritual and the Material, the Divine and the\r\nCarnal; and although we may not wholly accept this classification, we\r\ncannot fail to observe that distinctions exist. Instead of two\r\nantithetic selves, a modern man would probably note a good many not so\r\nsharply separated. He would say that the distinction drawn by\r\ntheologians was arbitrary and external, because many different selves\r\nwere grouped together as higher provided they fitted into the\r\ntheologian's categories, but he would recognize nevertheless that here\r\nwas an authentic clue to the variety of human nature.\r\n\r\nWe have learned to note many selves, and to be a little less ready to\r\nissue judgment upon them. We understand that we see the same body, but\r\noften a different man, depending on whether he is dealing with a\r\nsocial equal, a social inferior, or a social superior; on whether he\r\nis making love to a woman he is eligible to marry, or to one whom he\r\nis not; on whether he is courting a woman, or whether he considers\r\nhimself her proprietor; on whether he is dealing with his children,\r\nhis partners, his most trusted subordinates, the boss who can make him\r\nor break him; on whether he is struggling for the necessities of life,\r\nor successful; on whether he is dealing with a friendly alien, or a\r\ndespised one; on whether he is in great danger, or in perfect\r\nsecurity; on whether he is alone in Paris or among his family in\r\nPeoria.\r\n\r\nPeople differ widely, of course, in the consistency of their\r\ncharacters, so widely that they may cover the whole gamut of\r\ndifferences between a split soul like Dr. Jekyll's and an utterly\r\nsingleminded Brand, Parsifal, or Don Quixote. If the selves are too\r\nunrelated, we distrust the man; if they are too inflexibly on one\r\ntrack we find him arid, stubborn, or eccentric. In the repertory of\r\ncharacters, meager for the isolated and the self-sufficient, highly\r\nvaried for the adaptable, there is a whole range of selves, from that\r\none at the top which we should wish God to see, to those at the bottom\r\nthat we ourselves do not dare to see. There may be octaves for the\r\nfamily,--father, Jehovah, tyrant,--husband, proprietor, male,--lover,\r\nlecher,--for the occupation,--employer, master, exploiter,--competitor,\r\nintriguer, enemy,--subordinate, courtier, snob. Some never come out\r\ninto public view. Others are called out only by exceptional circumstances.\r\nBut the characters take their form from a man's conception of the\r\nsituation in which he finds himself. If the environment to which he\r\nis sensitive happens to be the smart set, he will imitate the character\r\nhe conceives to be appropriate. That character will tend to act as\r\nmodulator of his bearing, his speech, his choice of subjects, his\r\npreferences. Much of the comedy of life lies here, in the way people\r\nimagine their characters for situations that are strange to them: the\r\nprofessor among promoters, the deacon at a poker game, the\r\ncockney in the country, the paste diamond among real diamonds.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nInto the making of a man's characters there enters a variety of\r\ninfluences not easily separated. [Footnote: For an interesting sketch\r\nof the more noteworthy early attempts to explain character, see the\r\nchapter called \"The Antecedents of the Study of Character and\r\nTemperament,\" in Joseph Jastrow's _The Psychology of Conviction_.]\r\nThe analysis in its fundamentals is perhaps still as doubtful as it\r\nwas in the fifth century B. C. when Hippocrates formulated the\r\ndoctrine of the humors, distinguished the sanguine, the\r\nmelancholic, the choleric, and the phlegmatic dispositions, and\r\nascribed them to the blood, the black bile, the yellow bile, and the\r\nphlegm. The latest theories, such as one finds them in Cannon,\r\n[Footnote: _Bodily Changes in Pleasure, Pain and Anger_.] Adler,\r\n[Footnote: _The Neurotic Constitution_.] Kempf, [Footnote: _The\r\nAutonomic Functions and the Personality; Psychopathology. Cf_. also\r\nLouis Berman: _The Glands Regulating Personality_.] appear to\r\nfollow much the same scent, from the outward behavior and the inner\r\nconsciousness to the physiology of the body. But in spite of an\r\nimmensely improved technique, no one would be likely to claim that\r\nthere are settled conclusions which enable us to set apart nature from\r\nnurture, and abstract the native character from the acquired. It is\r\nonly in what Joseph Jastrow has called the slums of psychology that\r\nthe explanation of character is regarded as a fixed system to be\r\napplied by phrenologists, palmists, fortune-tellers, mind-readers, and\r\na few political professors. There you will still find it asserted that\r\n\"the Chinese are fond of colors, and have their eyebrows much vaulted\"\r\nwhile \"the heads of the Calmucks are depressed from above, but very\r\nlarge laterally, about the organ which gives the inclination to\r\nacquire; and this nation's propensity to steal, etc., is admitted.\"\r\n[Footnote: _Jastrow, op. cit._, p. 156.]\r\n\r\nThe modern psychologists are disposed to regard the outward behavior\r\nof an adult as an equation between a number of variables, such as the\r\nresistance of the environment, repressed cravings of several\r\nmaturities, and the manifest personality. [Footnote: Formulated by\r\nKempf, _Psychopathology_, p. 74, as follows:\r\n\r\nManifest wishes                }\r\n     over                      }\r\nLater Repressed Wishes         }\r\n     Over                      } opposed by the resistance of the\r\nAdolescent Repressed Wishes    }       environment=Behavior\r\n     Over                      }\r\nPreadolescent Repressed Wishes }\r\n] They permit us to suppose, though I have not seen the notion\r\nformulated, that the repression or control of cravings is fixed not in\r\nrelation to the whole person all the time, but more or less in respect\r\nto his various selves. There are things he will not do as a patriot\r\nthat he will do when he is not thinking of himself as a patriot. No\r\ndoubt there are impulses, more or less incipient in childhood, that\r\nare never exercised again in the whole of a man's life, except as they\r\nenter obscurely and indirectly into combination with other impulses.\r\nBut even that is not certain, since repression is not irretrievable.\r\nFor just as psychoanalysis can bring to the surface a buried impulse,\r\nso can social situations. [Footnote: _Cf._ the very interesting\r\nbook of Everett Dean Martin, _The Behavior of Crowds_.\r\n\r\nAlso Hobbes, _Leviathan_, Part II, Ch. 25. \"For the passions of\r\nmen, which asunder are moderate, as the heat of one brand, in an\r\nassembly are like many brands, that inflame one another, especially\r\nwhen they blow one another with orations....\"\r\n\r\nLeBon, _The Crowd_, elaborates this observation of Hobbes's.] It\r\nis only when our surroundings remain normal and placid, when what is\r\nexpected of us by those we meet is consistent, that we live without\r\nknowledge of many of our dispositions. When the unexpected occurs, we\r\nlearn much about ourselves that we did not know.\r\n\r\nThe selves, which we construct with the help of all who influence us,\r\nprescribe which impulses, how emphasized, how directed, are\r\nappropriate to certain typical situations for which we have learned\r\nprepared attitudes. For a recognizable type of experience, there is a\r\ncharacter which controls the outward manifestations of our whole\r\nbeing. Murderous hate is, for example, controlled in civil life.\r\nThough you choke with rage, you must not display it as a parent,\r\nchild, employer, politician. You would not wish to display a\r\npersonality that exudes murderous hate. You frown upon it, and the\r\npeople around you also frown. But if a war breaks out, the chances are\r\nthat everybody you admire will begin to feel the justification of\r\nkilling and hating. At first the vent for these feelings is very\r\nnarrow. The selves which come to the front are those which are attuned\r\nto a real love of country, the kind of feeling that you find in Rupert\r\nBrooke, and in Sir Edward Grey's speech on August 3,1914, and in\r\nPresident Wilson's address to Congress on April 2, 1917. The reality\r\nof war is still abhorred, and what war actually means is learned but\r\ngradually. For previous wars are only transfigured memories. In that\r\nhoneymoon phase, the realists of war rightly insist that the nation is\r\nnot yet awake, and reassure each other by saying: \"Wait for the\r\ncasualty lists.\" Gradually the impulse to kill becomes the main\r\nbusiness, and all those characters which might modify it,\r\ndisintegrate. The impulse becomes central, is sanctified, and\r\ngradually turns unmanageable. It seeks a vent not alone on the idea of\r\nthe enemy, which is all the enemy most people actually see during the\r\nwar, but upon all the persons and objects and ideas that have always\r\nbeen hateful. Hatred of the enemy is legitimate. These other hatreds\r\nhave themselves legitimized by the crudest analogy, and by what, once\r\nhaving cooled off, we recognize as the most far-fetched analogy. It\r\ntakes a long time to subdue so powerful an impulse once it goes loose.\r\nAnd therefore, when the war is over in fact, it takes time and\r\nstruggle to regain self-control, and to deal with the problems of\r\npeace in civilian character.\r\n\r\nModern war, as Mr. Herbert Croly has said, is inherent in the\r\npolitical structure of modern society, but outlawed by its ideals. For\r\nthe civilian population there exists no ideal code of conduct in war,\r\nsuch as the soldier still possesses and chivalry once prescribed. The\r\ncivilians are without standards, except those that the best of them\r\nmanage to improvise. The only standards they possess make war an\r\naccursed thing. Yet though the war may be a necessary one, no moral\r\ntraining has prepared them for it. Only their higher selves have a\r\ncode and patterns, and when they have to act in what the higher\r\nregards as a lower character profound disturbance results.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of characters for all the situations in which men may\r\nfind themselves is one function of a moral education. Clearly then, it\r\ndepends for its success upon the sincerity and knowledge with which\r\nthe environment has been explored. For in a world falsely conceived,\r\nour own characters are falsely conceived, and we misbehave. So the\r\nmoralist must choose: either he must offer a pattern of conduct for\r\nevery phase of life, however distasteful some of its phases may be, or\r\nhe must guarantee that his pupils will never be confronted by the\r\nsituations he disapproves. Either he must abolish war, or teach people\r\nhow to wage it with the greatest psychic economy; either he must\r\nabolish the economic life of man and feed him with stardust and dew,\r\nor he must investigate all the perplexities of economic life and offer\r\npatterns of conduct which are applicable in a world where no man is\r\nself-supporting. But that is just what the prevailing moral culture so\r\ngenerally refuses to do. In its best aspects it is diffident at the\r\nawful complication of the modern world. In its worst, it is just\r\ncowardly. Now whether the moralists study economics and politics and\r\npsychology, or whether the social scientists educate the moralists is\r\nno great matter. Each generation will go unprepared into the modern\r\nworld, unless it has been taught to conceive the kind of personality\r\nit will have to be among the issues it will most likely meet.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nMost of this the naive view of self-interest leaves out of account. It\r\nforgets that self and interest are both conceived somehow, and that\r\nfor the most part they are conventionally conceived. The ordinary\r\ndoctrine of self-interest usually omits altogether the cognitive\r\nfunction. So insistent is it on the fact that human beings finally\r\nrefer all things to themselves, that it does not stop to notice that\r\nmen's ideas of all things and of themselves are not instinctive. They\r\nare acquired.\r\n\r\nThus it may be true enough, as James Madison wrote in the tenth paper\r\nof the Federalist, that \"a landed interest, a manufacturing interest,\r\na mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\r\ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\r\ndifferent classes, actuated by different sentiments and views.\" But if\r\nyou examine the context of Madison's paper, you discover something\r\nwhich I think throws light upon that view of instinctive fatalism,\r\ncalled sometimes the economic interpretation of history. Madison was\r\narguing for the federal constitution, and \"among the numerous\r\nadvantages of the union\" he set forth \"its tendency to break and\r\ncontrol the violence of faction.\" Faction was what worried Madison.\r\nAnd the causes of faction he traced to \"the nature of man,\" where\r\nlatent dispositions are \"brought into different degrees of activity,\r\naccording to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for\r\ndifferent opinions concerning religion, concerning government and many\r\nother points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to\r\ndifferent leaders ambitiously contending for preeminence and power, or\r\nto persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting\r\nto the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties,\r\ninflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more\r\ndisposed to vex and oppress each other, than to coöperate for their\r\ncommon good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into\r\nmutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents\r\nitself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been\r\nsufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most\r\nviolent conflicts. But the _most common_ and _durable_ source\r\nof factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property.\"\r\n\r\nMadison's theory, therefore, is that the propensity to faction may be\r\nkindled by religious or political opinions, by leaders, but most\r\ncommonly by the distribution of property. Yet note that Madison claims\r\nonly that men are divided by their relation to property. He does not\r\nsay that their property and their opinions are cause and effect, but\r\nthat differences of property are the causes of differences of opinion.\r\nThe pivotal word in Madison's argument is \"different.\" From the\r\nexistence of differing economic situations you can tentatively infer a\r\nprobable difference of opinions, but you cannot infer what those\r\nopinions will necessarily be.\r\n\r\nThis reservation cuts radically into the claims of the theory as that\r\ntheory is usually held. That the reservation is necessary, the\r\nenormous contradiction between dogma and practice among orthodox\r\nsocialists bears witness. They argue that the next stage in social\r\nevolution is the inevitable result of the present stage. But in order\r\nto produce that inevitable next stage they organize and agitate to\r\nproduce \"class consciousness.\" Why, one asks, does not the economic\r\nsituation produce consciousness of class in everybody? It just\r\ndoesn't, that is all. And therefore the proud claim will not stand\r\nthat the socialist philosophy rests on prophetic insight into destiny.\r\nIt rests on an hypothesis about human nature. [Footnote: _Cf._\r\nThorstein Veblen, \"The Socialist Economics of Karl Marx and His\r\nFollowers,\" in _The Place of Science in Modern Civilization,_\r\nesp. pp. 413-418.]\r\n\r\nThe socialist practice is based on a belief that if men are\r\neconomically situated in different ways, they can then be induced to\r\nhold certain views. Undoubtedly they often come to believe, or can be\r\ninduced to believe different things, as they are, for example,\r\nlandlords or tenants, employees or employers, skilled or unskilled\r\nlaborers, wageworkers or salaried men, buyers or sellers, farmers or\r\nmiddle-men, exporters or importers, creditors or debtors. Differences\r\nof income make a profound difference in contact and opportunity. Men\r\nwho work at machines will tend, as Mr. Thorstein Veblen has so\r\nbrilliantly demonstrated, [Footnote: _The Theory of Business\r\nEnterprise_.] to interpret experience differently from handicraftsmen\r\nor traders. If this were all that the materialistic conception of politics\r\nasserted, the theory would be an immensely valuable hypothesis that\r\nevery interpreter of opinion would have to use. But he would often\r\nhave to abandon the theory, and he would always have to be on\r\nguard. For in trying to explain a certain public opinion, it is rarely\r\nobvious which of a man's many social relations is effecting a particular\r\nopinion. Does Smith's opinion arise from his problems as a landlord,\r\nan importer, an owner of railway shares, or an employer? Does\r\nJones's opinion, Jones being a weaver in a textile mill, come from\r\nthe attitude of his boss, the competition of new immigrants, his wife's\r\ngrocery bills, or the ever present contract with the firm which is\r\nselling him a Ford car and a house and lot on the instalment plan?\r\nWithout special inquiry you cannot tell. The economic determinist\r\ncannot tell.\r\n\r\nA man's various economic contacts limit or enlarge the range of his\r\nopinions. But which of the contacts, in what guise, on what theory,\r\nthe materialistic conception of politics cannot predict. It can\r\npredict, with a high degree of probability, that if a man owns a\r\nfactory, his ownership will figure in those opinions which seem to\r\nhave some bearing on that factory. But how the function of being an\r\nowner will figure, no economic determinist as such, can tell you.\r\nThere is no fixed set of opinions on any question that go with being\r\nthe owner of a factory, no views on labor, on property, on management,\r\nlet alone views on less immediate matters. The determinist can predict\r\nthat in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the owner will resist\r\nattempts to deprive him of ownership, or that he will favor\r\nlegislation which he thinks will increase his profits. But since there\r\nis no magic in ownership which enables a business man to know what\r\nlaws will make him prosper, there is no chain of cause and effect\r\ndescribed in economic materialism which enables anyone to prophesy\r\nwhether the owner will take a long view or a short one, a competitive\r\nor a cooperative.\r\n\r\nDid the theory have the validity which is so often claimed for it, it\r\nwould enable us to prophesy. We could analyze the economic interests\r\nof a people, and deduce what the people was bound to do. Marx tried\r\nthat, and after a good guess about the trusts, went wholly wrong. The\r\nfirst socialist experiment came, not as he predicted, out of the\r\nculmination of capitalist development in the West, but out of the\r\ncollapse of a pre-capitalist system in the East. Why did he go wrong?\r\nWhy did his greatest disciple, Lenin, go wrong? Because the Marxians\r\nthought that men's economic position would irresistibly produce a\r\nclear conception of their economic interests. They thought they\r\nthemselves possessed that clear conception, and that what they knew\r\nthe rest of mankind would learn. The event has shown, not only that a\r\nclear conception of interest does not arise automatically in everyone,\r\nbut that it did not arise even in Marx and Lenin themselves. After all\r\nthat Marx and Lenin have written, the social behavior of mankind is\r\nstill obscure. It ought not to be, if economic position alone\r\ndetermined public opinion. Position ought, if their theory were\r\ncorrect, not only to divide mankind into classes, but to supply each\r\nclass with a view of its interest and a coherent policy for obtaining\r\nit. Yet nothing is more certain than that all classes of men are in\r\nconstant perplexity as to what their interests are. [Footnote: As a\r\nmatter of fact, when it came to the test, Lenin completely abandoned\r\nthe materialistic interpretation of politics. Had he held sincerely to\r\nthe Marxian formula when he seized power in 1917, he would have said\r\nto himself: according to the teachings of Marx, socialism will develop\r\nout of a mature capitalism... here am I, in control of a nation that\r\nis only entering upon a capitalist development... it is true that I am\r\na socialist, but I am a scientific socialist... it follows that for\r\nthe present all idea of a socialist republic is out of the question...\r\nwe must advance capitalism in order that the evolution which Marx\r\npredicted may take place. But Lenin did nothing of the sort. Instead\r\nof waiting for evolution to evolve, he tried by will, force, and\r\neducation, to defy the historical process which his philosophy\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nSince this was written Lenin has abandoned communism on the ground\r\nthat Russia does not possess the necessary basis in a mature\r\ncapitalism. He now says that Russia must create capitalism, which will\r\ncreate a proletariat, which will some day create communism. This is at\r\nleast consistent with Marxist dogma. But it shows how little\r\ndeterminism there is in the opinions of a determinist.]\r\n\r\nThis dissolves the impact of economic determinism. For if our economic\r\ninterests are made up of our variable concepts of those interests,\r\nthen as the master key to social processes the theory fails. That\r\ntheory assumes that men are capable of adopting only one version of\r\ntheir interest, and that having adopted it, they move fatally to\r\nrealize it. It assumes the existence of a specific class interest.\r\nThat assumption is false. A class interest can be conceived largely or\r\nnarrowly, selfishly or unselfishly, in the light of no facts, some\r\nfacts, many facts, truth and error. And so collapses the Marxian\r\nremedy for class conflicts. That remedy assumes that if all property\r\ncould be held in common, class differences would disappear. The\r\nassumption is false. Property might well be held in common, and yet\r\nnot be conceived as a whole. The moment any group of people failed to\r\nsee communism in a communist manner, they would divide into classes on\r\nthe basis of what they saw.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the existing social order Marxian socialism emphasizes\r\nproperty conflict as the maker of opinion, in respect to the loosely\r\ndefined working class it ignores property conflict as the basis of\r\nagitation, in respect to the future it imagines a society without\r\nproperty conflict, and, therefore, without conflict of opinion. Now in\r\nthe existing social order there may be more instances where one man\r\nmust lose if another is to gain, than there would be under socialism,\r\nbut for every case where one must lose for another to gain, there are\r\nendless cases where men simply imagine the conflict because they are\r\nuneducated. And under socialism, though you removed every instance of\r\nabsolute conflict, the partial access of each man to the whole range\r\nof facts would nevertheless create conflict. A socialist state will\r\nnot be able to dispense with education, morality, or liberal science,\r\nthough on strict materialistic grounds the communal ownership of\r\nproperties ought to make them superfluous. The communists in Russia\r\nwould not propagate their faith with such unflagging zeal if economic\r\ndeterminism were alone determining the opinion of the Russian people.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe socialist theory of human nature is, like the hedonistic calculus,\r\nan example of false determinism. Both assume that the unlearned\r\ndispositions fatally but intelligently produce a certain type of\r\nbehavior. The socialist believes that the dispositions pursue the\r\neconomic interest of a class; the hedonist believes that they pursue\r\npleasure and avoid pain. Both theories rest on a naive view of\r\ninstinct, a view, defined by James, [Footnote: _Principles of\r\nPsychology_, Vol. II, p. 383.] though radically qualified by him,\r\nas \"the faculty of acting in such a way as to produce certain ends,\r\nwithout foresight of the ends and without previous education in the\r\nperformance.\"\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether instinctive action of this sort figures at all\r\nin the social life of mankind. For as James pointed out: [Footnote:\r\n_Op. cit._, Vol. II, p. 390.] \"every instinctive act in an animal\r\nwith memory must cease to be 'blind' after being once repeated.\"\r\nWhatever the equipment at birth, the innate dispositions are from\r\nearliest infancy immersed in experience which determines what shall\r\nexcite them as stimulus. \"They become capable,\" as Mr. McDougall\r\nsays, [Footnote: Introduction to _Social Psychology_, Fourth\r\nEdition, pp. 31-32.] \"of being initiated, not only by the perception\r\nof objects of the kind which directly excite the innate disposition,\r\nthe natural or native excitants of the instinct, but also by ideas of\r\nsuch objects, and by perceptions and by ideas of objects of other\r\nkinds.\" [Footnote: \"Most definitions of instincts and instinctive\r\nactions take account only of their conative aspects... and it is a\r\ncommon mistake to ignore the cognitive and affective aspects of the\r\ninstinctive mental process.\" Footnote _op. cit._, p. 29.]\r\n\r\nIt is only the \"central part of the disposition\" [Footnote: p. 34.]\r\nsays Mr. McDougall further, \"that retains its specific character and\r\nremains common to all individuals and all situations in which the\r\ninstinct is excited.\" The cognitive processes, and the actual bodily\r\nmovements by which the instinct achieves its end may be indefinitely\r\ncomplicated. In other words, man has an instinct of fear, but what he\r\nwill fear and how he will try to escape, is determined not from birth,\r\nbut by experience.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for this variability, it would be difficult to conceive\r\nthe inordinate variety of human nature. But when you consider that all\r\nthe important tendencies of the creature, his appetites, his loves,\r\nhis hates, his curiosity, his sexual cravings, his fears, and\r\npugnacity, are freely attachable to all sorts of objects as stimulus,\r\nand to all kinds of objects as gratification, the complexity of human\r\nnature is not so inconceivable. And when you think that each new\r\ngeneration is the casual victim of the way a previous generation was\r\nconditioned, as well as the inheritor of the environment that\r\nresulted, the possible combinations and permutations are enormous.\r\n\r\nThere is no prima facie case then for supposing that because persons\r\ncrave some particular thing, or behave in some particular way, human\r\nnature is fatally constituted to crave that and act thus. The craving\r\nand the action are both learned, and in another generation might be\r\nlearned differently. Analytic psychology and social history unite in\r\nsupporting this conclusion. Psychology indicates how essentially\r\ncasual is the nexus between the particular stimulus and the particular\r\nresponse. Anthropology in the widest sense reinforces the view by\r\ndemonstrating that the things which have excited men's passions, and\r\nthe means which they have used to realize them, differ endlessly from\r\nage to age and from place to place.\r\n\r\nMen pursue their interest. But how they shall pursue it is not fatally\r\ndetermined, and, therefore, within whatever limits of time this planet\r\nwill continue to support human life, man can set no term upon the\r\ncreative energies of men. He can issue no doom of automatism. He can\r\nsay, if he must, that for his life there will be no changes which he\r\ncan recognize as good. But in saying that he will be confining his\r\nlife to what he can see with his eye, rejecting what he might see with\r\nhis mind; he will be taking as the measure of good a measure which is\r\nonly the one he happens to possess. He can find no ground for\r\nabandoning his highest hopes and relaxing his conscious effort unless\r\nhe chooses to regard the unknown as the unknowable, unless he elects\r\nto believe that what no one knows no one will know, and that what\r\nsomeone has not yet learned no one will ever be able to teach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF A COMMON WILL\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. THE TRANSFER OF INTEREST\r\n   \"    14. YES OR NO\r\n   \"    15. LEADERS AND THE RANK AND FILE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSFER OF INTEREST\r\n\r\nThis goes to show that there are many variables in each man's\r\nimpressions of the invisible world. The points of contact vary, the\r\nstereotyped expectations vary, the interest enlisted varies most\r\nsubtly of all. The living impressions of a large number of people are\r\nto an immeasurable degree personal in each of them, and unmanageably\r\ncomplex in the mass. How, then, is any practical relationship\r\nestablished between what is in people's heads and what is out there\r\nbeyond their ken in the environment? How in the language of democratic\r\ntheory, do great numbers of people feeling each so privately about so\r\nabstract a picture, develop any common will? How does a simple and\r\nconstant idea emerge from this complex of variables? How are those\r\nthings known as the Will of the People, or the National Purpose, or\r\nPublic Opinion crystallized out of such fleeting and casual imagery?\r\n\r\nThat there is a real difficulty here was shown by an angry tilt in the\r\nspring of 1921 between the American Ambassador to England and a very\r\nlarge number of other Americans. Mr. Harvey, speaking at a British\r\ndinner table, had assured the world without the least sign of\r\nhesitancy what were the motives of Americans in 1917. [Footnote: _New\r\nYork Times_, May 20, 1921.] As he described them, they were not the\r\nmotives which President Wilson had insisted upon when _he_\r\nenunciated the American mind. Now, of course, neither Mr. Harvey nor\r\nMr. Wilson, nor the critics and friends of either, nor any one else,\r\ncan know quantitatively and qualitatively what went on in thirty or\r\nforty million adult minds. But what everybody knows is that a war was\r\nfought and won by a multitude of efforts, stimulated, no one knows in\r\nwhat proportion, by the motives of Wilson and the motives of Harvey\r\nand all kinds of hybrids of the two. People enlisted and fought,\r\nworked, paid taxes, sacrificed to a common end, and yet no one can\r\nbegin to say exactly what moved each person to do each thing that he\r\ndid. It is no use, then, Mr. Harvey telling a soldier who thought this\r\nwas a war to end war that the soldier did not think any such thing.\r\nThe soldier who thought that _thought that_. And Mr. Harvey, who\r\nthought something else, thought _something else_.\r\n\r\nIn the same speech Mr. Harvey formulated with equal clarity what the\r\nvoters of 1920 had in their minds. That is a rash thing to do, and, if\r\nyou simply assume that all who voted your ticket voted as you did,\r\nthen it is a disingenuous thing to do. The count shows that sixteen\r\nmillions voted Republican, and nine millions Democratic. They voted,\r\nsays Mr. Harvey, for and against the League of Nations, and in support\r\nof this claim, he can point to Mr. Wilson's request for a referendum,\r\nand to the undeniable fact that the Democratic party and Mr. Cox\r\ninsisted that the League was the issue. But then, saying that the\r\nLeague was the issue did not make the League the issue, and by\r\ncounting the votes on election day you do not know the real division\r\nof opinion about the League. There were, for example, nine million\r\nDemocrats. Are you entitled to believe that all of them are staunch\r\nsupporters of the League? Certainly you are not. For your knowledge of\r\nAmerican politics tells you that many of the millions voted, as they\r\nalways do, to maintain the existing social system in the South, and\r\nthat whatever their views on the League, they did not vote to express\r\ntheir views. Those who wanted the League were no doubt pleased that\r\nthe Democratic party wanted it too. Those who disliked the League may\r\nhave held their noses as they voted. But both groups of Southerners\r\nvoted the same ticket.\r\n\r\nWere the Republicans more unanimous? Anybody can pick Republican\r\nvoters enough out of his circle of friends to cover the whole gamut of\r\nopinion from the irreconcilability of Senators Johnson and Knox to the\r\nadvocacy of Secretary Hoover and Chief Justice Taft. No one can say\r\ndefinitely how many people felt in any particular way about the\r\nLeague, nor how many people let their feelings on that subject\r\ndetermine their vote. When there are only two ways of expressing a\r\nhundred varieties of feeling, there is no certain way of knowing what\r\nthe decisive combination was. Senator Borah found in the Republican\r\nticket a reason for voting Republican, but so did President Lowell.\r\nThe Republican majority was composed of men and women who thought a\r\nRepublican victory would kill the League, plus those who thought it\r\nthe most practical way to secure the League, plus those who thought it\r\nthe surest way offered to obtain an amended League. All these voters\r\nwere inextricably entangled with their own desire, or the desire of\r\nother voters to improve business, or put labor in its place, or to\r\npunish the Democrats for going to war, or to punish them for not\r\nhaving gone sooner, or to get rid of Mr. Burleson, or to improve the\r\nprice of wheat, or to lower taxes, or to stop Mr. Daniels from\r\noutbuilding the world, or to help Mr. Harding do the same thing.\r\n\r\nAnd yet a sort of decision emerged; Mr. Harding moved into the White\r\nHouse. For the least common denominator of all the votes was that the\r\nDemocrats should go and the Republicans come in. That was the only\r\nfactor remaining after all the contradictions had cancelled each other\r\nout. But that factor was enough to alter policy for four years. The\r\nprecise reasons why change was desired on that November day in 1920\r\nare not recorded, not even in the memories of the individual voters.\r\nThe reasons are not fixed. They grow and change and melt into other\r\nreasons, so that the public opinions Mr. Harding has to deal with are\r\nnot the opinions that elected him. That there is no inevitable\r\nconnection between an assortment of opinions and a particular line of\r\naction everyone saw in 1916. Elected apparently on the cry that he\r\nkept us out of war, Mr. Wilson within five months led the country into\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe working of the popular will, therefore, has always called for\r\nexplanation. Those who have been most impressed by its erratic working\r\nhave found a prophet in M. LeBon, and have welcomed generalizations\r\nabout what Sir Robert Peel called \"that great compound of folly,\r\nweakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy and\r\nnewspaper paragraphs which is called public opinion.\" Others have\r\nconcluded that since out of drift and incoherence, settled aims do\r\nappear, there must be a mysterious contrivance at work somewhere over\r\nand above the inhabitants of a nation. They invoke a collective soul,\r\na national mind, a spirit of the age which imposes order upon random\r\nopinion. An oversoul seems to be needed, for the emotions and ideas in\r\nthe members of a group do not disclose anything so simple and so\r\ncrystalline as the formula which those same individuals will accept as\r\na true statement of their Public Opinion.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBut the facts can, I think, be explained more convincingly without the\r\nhelp of the oversoul in any of its disguises. After all, the art of\r\ninducing all sorts of people who think differently to vote alike is\r\npracticed in every political campaign. In 1916, for example, the\r\nRepublican candidate had to produce Republican votes out of many\r\ndifferent kinds of Republicans. Let us look at Mr. Hughes' first\r\nspeech after accepting the nomination. [Footnote: Delivered at Carnegie\r\nHall, New York City, July 31, 1916.] The context is still clear enough\r\nin our minds to obviate much explanation; yet the issues are no longer\r\ncontentious. The candidate was a man of unusually plain speech, who\r\nhad been out of politics for several years and was not personally\r\ncommitted on the issues of the recent past. He had, moreover, none of\r\nthat wizardry which popular leaders like Roosevelt, Wilson, or Lloyd\r\nGeorge possess, none of that histrionic gift by which such men\r\nimpersonate the feelings of their followers. From that aspect of\r\npolitics he was by temperament and by training remote. But yet he knew\r\nby calculation what the politician's technic is. He was one of those\r\npeople who know just how to do a thing, but who can not quite do it\r\nthemselves. They are often better teachers than the virtuoso to whom\r\nthe art is so much second nature that he himself does not know how he\r\ndoes it. The statement that those who can, do; those who cannot,\r\nteach, is not nearly so much of a reflection on the teacher as it\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes knew the occasion was momentous, and he had prepared his\r\nmanuscript carefully. In a box sat Theodore Roosevelt just back from\r\nMissouri. All over the house sat the veterans of Armageddon in various\r\nstages of doubt and dismay. On the platform and in the other boxes the\r\nex-whited sepulchres and ex-second-story men of 1912 were to be seen,\r\nobviously in the best of health and in a melting mood. Out beyond the\r\nhall there were powerful pro-Germans and powerful pro-Allies; a war\r\nparty in the East and in the big cities; a peace party in the middle\r\nand far West. There was strong feeling about Mexico. Mr. Hughes had to\r\nform a majority against the Democrats out of people divided into all\r\nsorts of combinations on Taft vs. Roosevelt, pro-Germans vs.\r\npro-Allies, war vs. neutrality, Mexican intervention vs.\r\nnon-intervention.\r\n\r\nAbout the morality or the wisdom of the affair we are, of course, not\r\nconcerned here. Our only interest is in the method by which a leader\r\nof heterogeneous opinion goes about the business of securing a\r\nhomogeneous vote.\r\n\r\n\"This _representative_ gathering is a happy augury. It means the\r\nstrength of _reunion._ It means that the party of _Lincoln_\r\nis restored....\"\r\n\r\nThe italicized words are binders: _Lincoln_ in such a speech has\r\nof course, no relation to Abraham Lincoln. It is merely a stereotype\r\nby which the piety which surrounds that name can be transferred to the\r\nRepublican candidate who now stands in his shoes. Lincoln reminds the\r\nRepublicans, Bull Moose and Old Guard, that before the schism they had\r\na common history. About the schism no one can afford to speak. But it\r\nis there, as yet unhealed.\r\n\r\nThe speaker must heal it. Now the schism of 1912 had arisen over\r\ndomestic questions; the reunion of 1916 was, as Mr. Roosevelt had\r\ndeclared, to be based on a common indignation against Mr. Wilson's\r\nconduct of international affairs. But international affairs were also\r\na dangerous source of conflict. It was necessary to find an opening\r\nsubject which would not only ignore 1912 but would avoid also the\r\nexplosive conflicts of 1916. The speaker skilfully selected the spoils\r\nsystem in diplomatic appointments. \"Deserving Democrats\" was a\r\ndiscrediting phrase, and Mr. Hughes at once evokes it. The record\r\nbeing indefensible, there is no hesitation in the vigor of the attack.\r\nLogically it was an ideal introduction to a common mood.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes then turns to Mexico, beginning with an historical review.\r\nHe had to consider the general sentiment that affairs were going badly\r\nin Mexico; also, a no less general sentiment that war should be\r\navoided; and two powerful currents of opinion, one of which said\r\nPresident Wilson was right in not recognizing Huerta, the other which\r\npreferred Huerta to Carranza, and intervention to both. Huerta was the\r\nfirst sore spot in the record...\r\n\r\n\"He was certainly in fact the head of the Government in Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nBut the moralists who regarded Huerta as a drunken murderer had to be\r\nplacated.\r\n\r\n\"Whether or not he should be recognized was a question to be\r\ndetermined in the exercise of a sound discretion, but according to\r\ncorrect principles.\"\r\n\r\nSo instead of saying that Huerta should have been recognized, the\r\ncandidate says that correct principles ought to be applied. Everybody\r\nbelieves in correct principles, and everybody, of course, believes he\r\npossesses them. To blur the issue still further President Wilson's\r\npolicy is described as \"intervention.\" It was that in law, perhaps,\r\nbut not in the sense then currently meant by the word. By stretching\r\nthe word to cover what Mr. Wilson had done, as well as what the real\r\ninterventionists wanted, the issue between the two factions was to be\r\nrepressed.\r\n\r\nHaving got by the two explosive points \"_Huerta_\" and\r\n\"_intervention_\" by letting the words mean all things to all men,\r\nthe speech passes for a while to safer ground. The candidate tells the\r\nstory of Tampico, Vera Cruz, Villa, Santa Ysabel, Columbus and\r\nCarrizal. Mr. Hughes is specific, either because the facts as known\r\nfrom the newspapers are irritating, or because the true explanation\r\nis, as for example in regard to Tampico, too complicated. No contrary\r\npassions could be aroused by such a record. But at the end the\r\ncandidate had to take a position. His audience expected it. The\r\nindictment was Mr. Roosevelt's. Would Mr. Hughes adopt his remedy,\r\nintervention?\r\n\r\n\"The nation has no policy of aggression toward Mexico. We have no\r\ndesire for any part of her territory. We wish her to have peace,\r\nstability and prosperity. We should be ready to aid her in binding up\r\nher wounds, in relieving her from starvation and distress, in giving\r\nher in every practicable way the benefits of our disinterested\r\nfriendship. The conduct of this administration has created\r\ndifficulties which we shall have to surmount.... _We shall have to\r\nadopt a new policy,_ a policy of _firmness_ and consistency\r\nthrough which alone we can promote an enduring _friendship._\"\r\n\r\nThe theme friendship is for the non-interventionists, the theme \"new\r\npolicy\" and \"firmness\" is for the interventionists. On the\r\nnon-contentious record, the detail is overwhelming; on the issue\r\neverything is cloudy.\r\n\r\nConcerning the European war Mr. Hughes employed an ingenious formula:\r\n\r\n\"I stand for the unflinching maintenance of _all_ American rights\r\non land and sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the force of that statement at the time it was\r\nspoken, we must remember how each faction during the period of\r\nneutrality believed that the nations it opposed in Europe were alone\r\nviolating American rights. Mr. Hughes seemed to say to the pro-Allies:\r\nI would have coerced Germany. But the pro-Germans had been insisting\r\nthat British sea power was violating most of our rights. The formula\r\ncovers two diametrically opposed purposes by the symbolic phrase\r\n\"American rights.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was the Lusitania. Like the 1912 schism, it was an\r\ninvincible obstacle to harmony.\r\n\r\n\"... I am confident that there would have been no destruction of\r\nAmerican lives by the sinking of the Lusitania.\"\r\n\r\nThus, what cannot be compromised must be obliterated, when there is a\r\nquestion on which we cannot all hope to get together, let us pretend\r\nthat it does not exist. About the future of American relations with\r\nEurope Mr. Hughes was silent. Nothing he could say would possibly\r\nplease the two irreconcilable factions for whose support he was\r\nbidding.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that Mr. Hughes did not invent this\r\ntechnic and did not employ it with the utmost success. But he\r\nillustrated how a public opinion constituted out of divergent opinions\r\nis clouded; how its meaning approaches the neutral tint formed out of\r\nthe blending of many colors. Where superficial harmony is the aim and\r\nconflict the fact, obscurantism in a public appeal is the usual\r\nresult. Almost always vagueness at a crucial point in public debate is\r\na symptom of cross-purposes.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nBut how is it that a vague idea so often has the power to unite deeply\r\nfelt opinions? These opinions, we recall, however deeply they may be\r\nfelt, are not in continual and pungent contact with the facts they\r\nprofess to treat. On the unseen environment, Mexico, the European war,\r\nour grip is slight though our feeling may be intense. The original\r\npictures and words which aroused it have not anything like the force\r\nof the feeling itself. The account of what has happened out of sight\r\nand hearing in a place where we have never been, has not and never can\r\nhave, except briefly as in a dream or fantasy, all the dimensions of\r\nreality. But it can arouse all, and sometimes even more emotion than\r\nthe reality. For the trigger can be pulled by more than one stimulus.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus which originally pulled the trigger may have been a\r\nseries of pictures in the mind aroused by printed or spoken words.\r\nThese pictures fade and are hard to keep steady; their contours and\r\ntheir pulse fluctuate. Gradually the process sets in of knowing what\r\nyou feel without being entirely certain why you feel it. The fading\r\npictures are displaced by other pictures, and then by names or\r\nsymbols. But the emotion goes on, capable now of being aroused by the\r\nsubstituted images and names. Even in severe thinking these\r\nsubstitutions take place, for if a man is trying to compare two\r\ncomplicated situations, he soon finds exhausting the attempt to hold\r\nboth fully in mind in all their detail. He employs a shorthand of\r\nnames and signs and samples. He has to do this if he is to advance at\r\nall, because he cannot carry the whole baggage in every phrase through\r\nevery step he takes. But if he forgets that he has substituted and\r\nsimplified, he soon lapses into verbalism, and begins to talk about\r\nnames regardless of objects. And then he has no way of knowing when\r\nthe name divorced from its first thing is carrying on a misalliance\r\nwith some other thing. It is more difficult still to guard against\r\nchangelings in casual politics.\r\n\r\nFor by what is known to psychologists as conditioned response, an\r\nemotion is not attached merely to one idea. There are no end of things\r\nwhich can arouse the emotion, and no end of things which can satisfy\r\nit. This is particularly true where the stimulus is only dimly and\r\nindirectly perceived, and where the objective is likewise indirect.\r\nFor you can associate an emotion, say fear, first with something\r\nimmediately dangerous, then with the idea of that thing, then with\r\nsomething similar to that idea, and so on and on. The whole structure\r\nof human culture is in one respect an elaboration of the stimuli and\r\nresponses of which the original emotional capacities remain a fairly\r\nfixed center. No doubt the quality of emotion has changed in the\r\ncourse of history, but with nothing like the speed, or elaboration,\r\nthat has characterized the conditioning of it.\r\n\r\nPeople differ widely in their susceptibility to ideas. There are some\r\nin whom the idea of a starving child in Russia is practically as vivid\r\nas a starving child within sight. There are others who are almost\r\nincapable of being excited by a distant idea. There are many\r\ngradations between. And there are people who are insensitive to facts,\r\nand aroused only by ideas. But though the emotion is aroused by the\r\nidea, we are unable to satisfy the emotion by acting ourselves upon\r\nthe scene itself. The idea of the starving Russian child evokes a\r\ndesire to feed the child. But the person so aroused cannot feed it. He\r\ncan only give money to an impersonal organization, or to a\r\npersonification which he calls Mr. Hoover. His money does not reach\r\nthat child. It goes to a general pool from which a mass of children\r\nare fed. And so just as the idea is second hand, so are the effects of\r\nthe action second hand. The cognition is indirect, the conation is\r\nindirect, only the effect is immediate. Of the three parts of the\r\nprocess, the stimulus comes from somewhere out of sight, the response\r\nreaches somewhere out of sight, only the emotion exists entirely\r\nwithin the person. Of the child's hunger he has only an idea, of the\r\nchild's relief he has only an idea, but of his own desire to help he\r\nhas a real experience. It is the central fact of the business, the\r\nemotion within himself, which is first hand.\r\n\r\nWithin limits that vary, the emotion is transferable both as regards\r\nstimulus and response. Therefore, if among a number of people,\r\npossessing various tendencies to respond, you can find a stimulus\r\nwhich will arouse the same emotion in many of them, you can substitute\r\nit for the original stimuli. If, for example, one man dislikes the\r\nLeague, another hates Mr. Wilson, and a third fears labor, you may be\r\nable to unite them if you can find some symbol which is the antithesis\r\nof what they all hate. Suppose that symbol is Americanism. The first\r\nman may read it as meaning the preservation of American isolation, or\r\nas he may call it, independence; the second as the rejection of a\r\npolitician who clashes with his idea of what an American president\r\nshould be, the third as a call to resist revolution. The symbol in\r\nitself signifies literally no one thing in particular, but it can be\r\nassociated with almost anything. And because of that it can become the\r\ncommon bond of common feelings, even though those feelings were\r\noriginally attached to disparate ideas.\r\n\r\nWhen political parties or newspapers declare for Americanism,\r\nProgressivism, Law and Order, Justice, Humanity, they hope to\r\namalgamate the emotion of conflicting factions which would surely\r\ndivide, if, instead of these symbols, they were invited to discuss a\r\nspecific program. For when a coalition around the symbol has been\r\neffected, feeling flows toward conformity under the symbol rather than\r\ntoward critical scrutiny of the measures. It is, I think, convenient\r\nand technically correct to call multiple phrases like these symbolic.\r\nThey do not stand for specific ideas, but for a sort of truce or\r\njunction between ideas. They are like a strategic railroad center\r\nwhere many roads converge regardless of their ultimate origin or their\r\nultimate destination. But he who captures the symbols by which public\r\nfeeling is for the moment contained, controls by that much the\r\napproaches of public policy. And as long as a particular symbol has\r\nthe power of coalition, ambitious factions will fight for possession.\r\nThink, for example, of Lincoln's name or of Roosevelt's. A leader or\r\nan interest that can make itself master of current symbols is master\r\nof the current situation. There are limits, of course. Too violent\r\nabuse of the actualities which groups of people think the symbol\r\nrepresents, or too great resistance in the name of that symbol to new\r\npurposes, will, so to speak, burst the symbol. In this manner, during\r\nthe year 1917, the imposing symbol of Holy Russia and the Little\r\nFather burst under the impact of suffering and defeat.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe tremendous consequences of Russia's collapse were felt on all the\r\nfronts and among all the peoples. They led directly to a striking\r\nexperiment in the crystallization of a common opinion out of the\r\nvarieties of opinion churned up by the war. The Fourteen Points were\r\naddressed to all the governments, allied, enemy, neutral, and to all\r\nthe peoples. They were an attempt to knit together the chief\r\nimponderables of a world war. Necessarily this was a new departure,\r\nbecause this was the first great war in which all the deciding\r\nelements of mankind could be brought to think about the same ideas, or\r\nat least about the same names for ideas, simultaneously. Without\r\ncable, radio, telegraph, and daily press, the experiment of the\r\nFourteen Points would have been impossible. It was an attempt to\r\nexploit the modern machinery of communication to start the return to a\r\n\"common consciousness\" throughout the world.\r\n\r\nBut first we must examine some of the circumstances as they presented\r\nthemselves at the end of 1917. For in the form which the document\r\nfinally assumed, all these considerations are somehow represented.\r\nDuring the summer and autumn a series of events had occurred which\r\nprofoundly affected the temper of the people and the course of the\r\nwar. In July the Russians had made a last offensive, had been\r\ndisastrously beaten, and the process of demoralization which led to\r\nthe Bolshevik revolution of November had begun. Somewhat earlier the\r\nFrench had suffered a severe and almost disastrous defeat in Champagne\r\nwhich produced mutinies in the army and a defeatist agitation among\r\nthe civilians. England was suffering from the effects of the submarine\r\nraids, from the terrible losses of the Flanders battles, and in\r\nNovember at Cambrai the British armies met a reverse that appalled the\r\ntroops at the front and the leaders at home. Extreme war weariness\r\npervaded the whole of western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn effect, the agony and disappointment had jarred loose men's\r\nconcentration on the accepted version of the war. Their interests were\r\nno longer held by the ordinary official pronouncements, and their\r\nattention began to wander, fixing now upon their own suffering, now\r\nupon their party and class purposes, now upon general resentments\r\nagainst the governments. That more or less perfect organization of\r\nperception by official propaganda, of interest and attention by the\r\nstimuli of hope, fear, and hatred, which is called morale, was by way\r\nof breaking down. The minds of men everywhere began to search for new\r\nattachments that promised relief.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they beheld a tremendous drama. On the Eastern front there\r\nwas a Christmas truce, an end of slaughter, an end of noise, a promise\r\nof peace. At Brest-Litovsk the dream of all simple people had come to\r\nlife: it was possible to negotiate, there was some other way to end\r\nthe ordeal than by matching lives with the enemy. Timidly, but with\r\nrapt attention, people began to turn to the East. Why not, they asked?\r\nWhat is it all for? Do the politicians know what they are doing? Are\r\nwe really fighting for what they say? Is it possible, perhaps, to\r\nsecure it without fighting? Under the ban of the censorship, little of\r\nthis was allowed to show itself in print, but, when Lord Lansdowne\r\nspoke, there was a response from the heart. The earlier symbols of the\r\nwar had become hackneyed, and had lost their power to unify. Beneath\r\nthe surface a wide schism was opening up in each Allied country.\r\n\r\nSomething similar was happening in Central Europe. There too the\r\noriginal impulse of the war was weakened; the union sacrée was broken.\r\nThe vertical cleavages along the battle front were cut across by\r\nhorizontal divisions running in all kinds of unforeseeable ways. The\r\nmoral crisis of the war had arrived before the military decision was\r\nin sight. All this President Wilson and his advisers realized. They\r\nhad not, of course, a perfect knowledge of the situation, but what I\r\nhave sketched they knew.\r\n\r\nThey knew also that the Allied Governments were bound by a series of\r\nengagements that in letter and in spirit ran counter to the popular\r\nconception of what the war was about. The resolutions of the Paris\r\nEconomic Conference were, of course, public property, and the network\r\nof secret treaties had been published by the Bolsheviks in November of\r\n1917. [Footnote: President Wilson stated at his conference with the\r\nSenators that he had never heard of these treaties until he reached\r\nParis. That statement is perplexing. The Fourteen Points, as the text\r\nshows, could not have been formulated without a knowledge of the\r\nsecret treaties. The substance of those treaties was before the\r\nPresident when he and Colonel House prepared the final published text\r\nof the Fourteen Points.] Their terms were only vaguely known to the\r\npeoples, but it was definitely believed that they did not comport with\r\nthe idealistic slogan of self-determination, no annexations and no\r\nindemnities. Popular questioning took the form of asking how many\r\nthousand English lives Alsace-Lorraine or Dalmatia were worth, how\r\nmany French lives Poland or Mesopotamia were worth. Nor was such\r\nquestioning entirely unknown in America. The whole Allied cause had\r\nbeen put on the defensive by the refusal to participate at\r\nBrest-Litovsk.\r\n\r\nHere was a highly sensitive state of mind which no competent leader\r\ncould fail to consider. The ideal response would have been joint\r\naction by the Allies. That was found to be impossible when it was\r\nconsidered at the Interallied Conference of October. But by December\r\nthe pressure had become so great that Mr. George and Mr. Wilson were\r\nmoved independently to make some response. The form selected by the\r\nPresident was a statement of peace terms under fourteen heads. The\r\nnumbering of them was an artifice to secure precision, and to create\r\nat once the impression that here was a business-like document. The\r\nidea of stating \"peace terms\" instead of \"war aims\" arose from the\r\nnecessity of establishing a genuine alternative to the Brest-Litovsk\r\nnegotiations. They were intended to compete for attention by\r\nsubstituting for the spectacle of Russo-German parleys the much\r\ngrander spectacle of a public world-wide debate.\r\n\r\nHaving enlisted the interest of the world, it was necessary to hold\r\nthat interest unified and flexible for all the different possibilities\r\nwhich the situation contained. The terms had to be such that the\r\nmajority among the Allies would regard them as worth while. They had\r\nto meet the national aspirations of each people, and yet to limit\r\nthose aspirations so that no one nation would regard itself as a\r\ncatspaw for another. The terms had to satisfy official interests so as\r\nnot to provoke official disunion, and yet they had to meet popular\r\nconceptions so as to prevent the spread of demoralization. They had,\r\nin short, to preserve and confirm Allied unity in case the war was to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nBut they had also to be the terms of a possible peace, so that in case\r\nthe German center and left were ripe for agitation, they would have a\r\ntext with which to smite the governing class. The terms had,\r\ntherefore, to push the Allied governors nearer to their people, drive\r\nthe German governors away from their people, and establish a line of\r\ncommon understanding between the Allies, the non-official Germans, and\r\nthe subject peoples of Austria-Hungary. The Fourteen Points were a\r\ndaring attempt to raise a standard to which almost everyone might\r\nrepair. If a sufficient number of the enemy people were ready there\r\nwould be peace; if not, then the Allies would be better prepared to\r\nsustain the shock of war.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations entered into the making of the Fourteen\r\nPoints. No one man may have had them all in mind, but all the men\r\nconcerned had some of them in mind. Against this background let us\r\nexamine certain aspects of the document. The first five points and the\r\nfourteenth deal with \"open diplomacy,\" \"freedom of the seas,\" \"equal\r\ntrade opportunities,\" \"reduction of armaments,\" no imperialist\r\nannexation of colonies, and the League of Nations. They might be\r\ndescribed as a statement of the popular generalizations in which\r\neveryone at that time professed to believe. But number three is more\r\nspecific. It was aimed consciously and directly at the resolutions of\r\nthe Paris Economic Conference, and was meant to relieve the German\r\npeople of their fear of suffocation.\r\n\r\nNumber six is the first point dealing with a particular nation. It was\r\nintended as a reply to Russian suspicion of the Allies, and the\r\neloquence of its promises was attuned to the drama of Brest-Litovsk.\r\nNumber seven deals with Belgium, and is as unqualified in form and\r\npurpose as was the conviction of practically the whole world,\r\nincluding very large sections of Central Europe. Over number eight we\r\nmust pause. It begins with an absolute demand for evacuation and\r\nrestoration of French territory, and then passes on to the question of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine. The phrasing of this clause most perfectly\r\nillustrates the character of a public statement which must condense a\r\nvast complex of interests in a few words. \"And the wrong done to\r\nFrance by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has\r\nunsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be\r\nrighted. ...\" Every word here was chosen with meticulous care. The\r\nwrong done should be righted; why not say that Alsace-Lorraine should\r\nbe restored? It was not said, because it was not certain that all of\r\nthe French _at that time_ would fight on indefinitely for\r\nreannexation if they were offered a plebiscite; and because it was\r\neven less certain whether the English and Italians would fight on. The\r\nformula had, therefore, to cover both contingencies. The word\r\n\"righted\" guaranteed satisfaction to France, but did not read as a\r\ncommitment to simple annexation. But why speak of the wrong done by\r\n_Prussia_ in _1871_? The word Prussia was, of course, intended\r\nto remind the South Germans that Alsace-Lorraine belonged not to\r\nthem but to Prussia. Why speak of peace unsettled for \"fifty years,\"\r\nand why the use of \"1871\"? In the first place, what the French and\r\nthe rest of the world remembered was 1871. That was the nodal\r\npoint of their grievance. But the formulators of the Fourteen Points\r\nknew that French officialdom planned for more than the Alsace-Lorraine\r\nof 1871. The secret memoranda that had passed between the Czar's\r\nministers and French officials in 1916 covered the annexation of the\r\nSaar Valley and some sort of dismemberment of the Rhineland. It was\r\nplanned to include the Saar Valley under the term \"Alsace-Lorraine\"\r\nbecause it had been part of Alsace-Lorraine in 1814, though it had\r\nbeen detached in 1815, and was no part of the territory at the close\r\nof the Franco-Prussian war. The official French formula for annexing\r\nthe Saar was to subsume it under \"Alsace-Lorraine\" meaning the\r\nAlsace-Lorraine of 1814-1815. By insistence on \"1871\" the President\r\nwas really defining the ultimate boundary between Germany and France,\r\nwas adverting to the secret treaty, and was casting it aside.\r\n\r\nNumber nine, a little less subtly, does the same thing in respect to\r\nItaly. \"Clearly recognizable lines of nationality\" are exactly what\r\nthe lines of the Treaty of London were not. Those lines were partly\r\nstrategic, partly economic, partly imperialistic, partly ethnic. The\r\nonly part of them that could possibly procure allied sympathy was that\r\nwhich would recover the genuine Italia Irredenta. All the rest, as\r\neveryone who was informed knew, merely delayed the impending Jugoslav\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the apparently unanimous\r\nenthusiasm which greeted the Fourteen Points represented agreement on\r\na program. Everyone seemed to find something that he liked and\r\nstressed this aspect and that detail. But no one risked a discussion.\r\nThe phrases, so pregnant with the underlying conflicts of the\r\ncivilized world, were accepted. They stood for opposing ideas, but\r\nthey evoked a common emotion. And to that extent they played a part in\r\nrallying the western peoples for the desperate ten months of war which\r\nthey had still to endure.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Fourteen Points dealt with that hazy and happy future\r\nwhen the agony was to be over, the real conflicts of interpretation\r\nwere not made manifest. They were plans for the settlement of a wholly\r\ninvisible environment, and because these plans inspired all groups\r\neach with its own private hope, all hopes ran together as a public\r\nhope. For harmonization, as we saw in Mr. Hughes's speech, is a\r\nhierarchy of symbols. As you ascend the hierarchy in order to include\r\nmore and more factions you may for a time preserve the emotional\r\nconnection though you lose the intellectual. But even the emotion\r\nbecomes thinner. As you go further away from experience, you go higher\r\ninto generalization or subtlety. As you go up in the balloon you throw\r\nmore and more concrete objects overboard, and when you have reached\r\nthe top with some phrase like the Rights of Humanity or the World Made\r\nSafe for Democracy, you see far and wide, but you see very little. Yet\r\nthe people whose emotions are entrained do not remain passive. As the\r\npublic appeal becomes more and more all things to all men, as the\r\nemotion is stirred while the meaning is dispersed, their very private\r\nmeanings are given a universal application. Whatever you want badly is\r\nthe Rights of Humanity. For the phrase, ever more vacant, capable of\r\nmeaning almost anything, soon comes to mean pretty nearly everything.\r\nMr. Wilson's phrases were understood in endlessly different ways in\r\nevery corner of the earth. No document negotiated and made of public\r\nrecord existed to correct the confusion. [Footnote: The American\r\ninterpretation of the fourteen points was explained to the allied\r\nstatesmen just before the armistice.] And so, when the day of\r\nsettlement came, everybody expected everything. The European authors\r\nof the treaty had a large choice, and they chose to realize those\r\nexpectations which were held by those of their countrymen who wielded\r\nthe most power at home.\r\n\r\nThey came down the hierarchy from the Rights of Humanity to the Rights\r\nof France, Britain and Italy. They did not abandon the use of symbols.\r\nThey abandoned only those which after the war had no permanent roots\r\nin the imagination of their constituents. They preserved the unity of\r\nFrance by the use of symbolism, but they would not risk anything for\r\nthe unity of Europe. The symbol France was deeply attached, the symbol\r\nEurope had only a recent history. Nevertheless the distinction between\r\nan omnibus like Europe and a symbol like France is not sharp. The\r\nhistory of states and empires reveals times when the scope of the\r\nunifying idea increases and also times when it shrinks. One cannot say\r\nthat men have moved consistently from smaller loyalties to larger\r\nones, because the facts will not bear out the claim. The Roman Empire\r\nand the Holy Roman Empire bellied out further than those national\r\nunifications in the Nineteenth Century from which believers in a World\r\nState argue by analogy. Nevertheless, it is probably true that the\r\nreal integration has increased regardless of the temporary inflation\r\nand deflation of empires.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nSuch a real integration has undoubtedly occurred in American history.\r\nIn the decade before 1789 most men, it seems, felt that their state\r\nand their community were real, but that the confederation of states\r\nwas unreal. The idea of their state, its flag, its most conspicuous\r\nleaders, or whatever it was that represented Massachusetts, or\r\nVirginia, were genuine symbols. That is to say, they were fed by\r\nactual experiences from childhood, occupation, residence, and the\r\nlike. The span of men's experience had rarely traversed the imaginary\r\nboundaries of their states. The word Virginian was related to pretty\r\nnearly everything that most Virginians had ever known or felt. It was\r\nthe most extensive political idea which had genuine contact with their\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nTheir experience, not their needs. For their needs arose out of their\r\nreal environment, which in those days was at least as large as the\r\nthirteen colonies. They needed a common defense. They needed a\r\nfinancial and economic regime as extensive as the Confederation. But\r\nas long as the pseudo-environment of the state encompassed them, the\r\nstate symbols exhausted their political interest. An interstate idea,\r\nlike the Confederation, represented a powerless abstraction. It was an\r\nomnibus, rather than a symbol, and the harmony among divergent groups,\r\nwhich the omnibus creates, is transient.\r\n\r\nI have said that the idea of confederation was a powerless\r\nabstraction. Yet the need of unity existed in the decade before the\r\nConstitution was adopted. The need existed, in the sense that affairs\r\nwere askew unless the need of unity was taken into account. Gradually\r\ncertain classes in each colony began to break through the state\r\nexperience. Their personal interests led across the state lines to\r\ninterstate experiences, and gradually there was constructed in their\r\nminds a picture of the American environment which was truly national\r\nin scope. For them the idea of federation became a true symbol, and\r\nceased to be an omnibus. The most imaginative of these men was\r\nAlexander Hamilton. It happened that he had no primitive attachment to\r\nany one state, for he was born in the West Indies, and had, from the\r\nvery beginning of his active life, been associated with the common\r\ninterests of all the states. Thus to most men of the time the question\r\nof whether the capital should be in Virginia or in Philadelphia was of\r\nenormous importance, because they were locally minded. To Hamilton\r\nthis question was of no emotional consequence; what he wanted was the\r\nassumption of the state debts because they would further nationalize\r\nthe proposed union. So he gladly traded the site of the capitol for\r\ntwo necessary votes from men who represented the Potomac district. To\r\nHamilton the Union was a symbol that represented all his interests and\r\nhis whole experience; to White and Lee from the Potomac, the symbol of\r\ntheir province was the highest political entity they served, and they\r\nserved it though they hated to pay the price. They agreed, says\r\nJefferson, to change their votes, \"White with a revulsion of stomach\r\nalmost convulsive.\" [Footnote: _Works,_ Vol. IX, p. 87. Cited by\r\nBeard, _Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy,_ p. 172.]\r\n\r\nIn the crystallizing of a common will, there is always an Alexander\r\nHamilton at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nYES OR NO\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nSymbols are often so useful and so mysteriously powerful that the word\r\nitself exhales a magical glamor. In thinking about symbols it is\r\ntempting to treat them as if they possessed independent energy. Yet no\r\nend of symbols which once provoked ecstasy have quite ceased to affect\r\nanybody. The museums and the books of folklore are full of dead\r\nemblems and incantations, since there is no power in the symbol,\r\nexcept that which it acquires by association in the human mind. The\r\nsymbols that have lost their power, and the symbols incessantly\r\nsuggested which fail to take root, remind us that if we were patient\r\nenough to study in detail the circulation of a symbol, we should\r\nbehold an entirely secular history.\r\n\r\nIn the Hughes campaign speech, in the Fourteen Points, in Hamilton's\r\nproject, symbols are employed. But they are employed by somebody at a\r\nparticular moment. The words themselves do not crystallize random\r\nfeeling. The words must be spoken by people who are strategically\r\nplaced, and they must be spoken at the opportune moment. Otherwise\r\nthey are mere wind. The symbols must be earmarked. For in themselves\r\nthey mean nothing, and the choice of possible symbols is always so\r\ngreat that we should, like the donkey who stood equidistant between\r\ntwo bales of hay, perish from sheer indecision among the symbols that\r\ncompete for our attention.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, are the reasons for their vote as stated by certain\r\nprivate citizens to a newspaper just before the election of 1920.\r\n\r\nFor Harding:\r\n\r\n\"The patriotic men and women of to-day, who cast their ballots for\r\nHarding and Coolidge will be held by posterity to have signed our\r\nSecond Declaration of Independence.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilmot--, inventor.\r\n\r\n\"He will see to it that the United States does not enter into\r\n'entangling alliances,' Washington as a city will benefit by changing\r\nthe control of the government from the Democrats to the Republicans.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clarence--, salesman.\r\n\r\nFor Cox:\r\n\r\n\"The people of the United States realize that it is our duty pledged\r\non the fields of France, to join the League of Nations. We must\r\nshoulder our share of the burden of enforcing peace throughout the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Marie--, stenographer.\r\n\r\n\"We should lose our own respect and the respect of other nations were\r\nwe to refuse to enter the League of Nations in obtaining international\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer--, statistician.\r\n\r\nThe two sets of phrases are equally noble, equally true, and almost\r\nreversible. Would Clarence and Wilmot have admitted for an instant\r\nthat they intended to default in our duty pledged on the fields of\r\nFrance; or that they did not desire international peace? Certainly\r\nnot. Would Marie and Spencer have admitted that they were in favor of\r\nentangling alliances or the surrender of American independence? They\r\nwould have argued with you that the League was, as President Wilson\r\ncalled it, a disentangling alliance, as well as a Declaration of\r\nIndependence for all the world, plus a Monroe Doctrine for the planet.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nSince the offering of symbols is so generous, and the meaning that can\r\nbe imputed is so elastic, how does any particular symbol take root in\r\nany particular person's mind? It is planted there by another human\r\nbeing whom we recognize as authoritative. If it is planted deeply\r\nenough, it may be that later we shall call the person authoritative\r\nwho waves that symbol at us. But in the first instance symbols are\r\nmade congenial and important because they are introduced to us by\r\ncongenial and important people.\r\n\r\nFor we are not born out of an egg at the age of eighteen with a\r\nrealistic imagination; we are still, as Mr. Shaw recalls, in the era\r\nof Burge and Lubin, where in infancy we are dependent upon older\r\nbeings for our contacts. And so we make our connections with the outer\r\nworld through certain beloved and authoritative persons. They are the\r\nfirst bridge to the invisible world. And though we may gradually\r\nmaster for ourselves many phases of that larger environment, there\r\nalways remains a vaster one that is unknown. To that we still relate\r\nourselves through authorities. Where all the facts are out of sight a\r\ntrue report and a plausible error read alike, sound alike, feel alike.\r\n\r\nExcept on a few subjects where our own knowledge is great, we cannot\r\nchoose between true and false accounts. So we choose between\r\ntrustworthy and untrustworthy reporters. [Footnote: See an\r\ninteresting, rather quaint old book: George Cornewall Lewis, _An\r\nEssay on the Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion_.]\r\n\r\nTheoretically we ought to choose the most expert on each subject. But\r\nthe choice of the expert, though a good deal easier than the choice of\r\ntruth, is still too difficult and often impracticable. The experts\r\nthemselves are not in the least certain who among them is the most\r\nexpert. And at that, the expert, even when we can identify him, is,\r\nlikely as not, too busy to be consulted, or impossible to get at. But\r\nthere are people whom we can identify easily enough because they are\r\nthe people who are at the head of affairs. Parents, teachers, and\r\nmasterful friends are the first people of this sort we encounter. Into\r\nthe difficult question of why children trust one parent rather than\r\nanother, the history teacher rather than the Sunday school teacher, we\r\nneed not try to enter. Nor how trust gradually spreads through a\r\nnewspaper or an acquaintance who is interested in public affairs to\r\npublic personages. The literature of psychoanalysis is rich in\r\nsuggestive hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAt any rate we do find ourselves trusting certain people, who\r\nconstitute our means of junction with pretty nearly the whole realm of\r\nunknown things. Strangely enough, this fact is sometimes regarded as\r\ninherently undignified, as evidence of our sheep-like, ape-like\r\nnature. But complete independence in the universe is simply\r\nunthinkable. If we could not take practically everything for granted,\r\nwe should spend our lives in utter triviality. The nearest thing to a\r\nwholly independent adult is a hermit, and the range of a hermit's\r\naction is very short. Acting entirely for himself, he can act only\r\nwithin a tiny radius and for simple ends. If he has time to think\r\ngreat thoughts we can be certain that he has accepted without\r\nquestion, before he went in for being a hermit, a whole repertory of\r\npainfully acquired information about how to keep warm and how to keep\r\nfrom being hungry, and also about what the great questions are.\r\n\r\nOn all but a very few matters for short stretches in our lives, the\r\nutmost independence that we can exercise is to multiply the\r\nauthorities to whom we give a friendly hearing. As congenital amateurs\r\nour quest for truth consists in stirring up the experts, and forcing\r\nthem to answer any heresy that has the accent of conviction. In such a\r\ndebate we can often judge who has won the dialectical victory, but we\r\nare virtually defenseless against a false premise that none of the\r\ndebaters has challenged, or a neglected aspect that none of them has\r\nbrought into the argument. We shall see later how the democratic\r\ntheory proceeds on the opposite assumption and assumes for the\r\npurposes of government an unlimited supply of self-sufficient\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe people on whom we depend for contact with the outer world are\r\nthose who seem to be running it. [Footnote: _Cf._ Bryce, _Modern\r\nDemocracies_ Vol. II, pp. 544-545.] They may be running only a\r\nvery small part of the world. The nurse feeds the child, bathes it, and\r\nputs it to bed. That does not constitute the nurse an authority on\r\nphysics, zoology, and the Higher Criticism. Mr. Smith runs, or at least\r\nhires, the man who runs the factory. That does not make him an\r\nauthority on the Constitution of the United States, nor on the effects\r\n\\of the Fordney tariff. Mr. Smoot runs the Republican party in the State\r\nof Utah. That in itself does not prove he is the best man to consult\r\nabout taxation. But the nurse may nevertheless determine for a while\r\nwhat zoology the child shall learn, Mr. Smith will have much to say on\r\nwhat the Constitution shall mean to his wife, his secretary, and perhaps\r\neven to his parson, and who shall define the limits of Senator Smoot's\r\nauthority?\r\n\r\nThe priest, the lord of the manor, the captains and the kings, the\r\nparty leaders, the merchant, the boss, however these men are chosen,\r\nwhether by birth, inheritance, conquest or election, they and their\r\norganized following administer human affairs. They are the officers,\r\nand although the same man may be field marshal at home, second\r\nlieutenant at the office, and scrub private in politics, although in many\r\ninstitutions the hierarchy of rank is vague or concealed, yet in every\r\ninstitution that requires the cooperation of many persons, some such\r\nhierarchy exists. [Footnote: _Cf._ M. Ostrogorski, _Democracy and the\r\nOrganization of Political Parties, passim;_ R. Michels, _Political Parties,\r\npassim;_ and Bryce, _Modern Democracies,_ particularly Chap.\r\nLXXV; also Ross, _Principles of Sociology,_ Chaps. XXII-XXIV. ]\r\nIn American politics we call it a machine, or \"the organization.\"\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThere are a number of important distinctions between the members of\r\nthe machine and the rank and file. The leaders, the steering committee\r\nand the inner circle, are in direct contact with their environment.\r\nThey may, to be sure, have a very limited notion of what they ought to\r\ndefine as the environment, but they are not dealing almost wholly with\r\nabstractions. There are particular men they hope to see elected,\r\nparticular balance sheets they wish to see improved, concrete\r\nobjectives that must be attained. I do not mean that they escape the\r\nhuman propensity to stereotyped vision. Their stereotypes often make\r\nthem absurd routineers. But whatever their limitations, the chiefs are\r\nin actual contact with some crucial part of that larger environment.\r\nThey decide. They give orders. They bargain. And something definite,\r\nperhaps not at all what they imagined, actually happens.\r\n\r\nTheir subordinates are not tied to them by a common conviction. That\r\nis to say the lesser members of a machine do not dispose their loyalty\r\naccording to independent judgment about the wisdom of the leaders. In\r\nthe hierarchy each is dependent upon a superior and is in turn\r\nsuperior to some class of his dependents. What holds the machine\r\ntogether is a system of privileges. These may vary according to the\r\nopportunities and the tastes of those who seek them, from nepotism and\r\npatronage in all their aspects to clannishness, hero-worship or a\r\nfixed idea. They vary from military rank in armies, through land and\r\nservices in a feudal system, to jobs and publicity in a modern\r\ndemocracy. That is why you can breakup a particular machine by\r\nabolishing its privileges. But the machine in every coherent group is,\r\nI believe, certain to reappear. For privilege is entirely relative,\r\nand uniformity is impossible. Imagine the most absolute communism of\r\nwhich your mind is capable, where no one possessed any object that\r\neveryone else did not possess, and still, if the communist group had\r\nto take any action whatever, the mere pleasure of being the friend of\r\nthe man who was going to make the speech that secured the most votes,\r\nwould, I am convinced, be enough to crystallize an organization of\r\ninsiders around him.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, then, to invent a collective intelligence in\r\norder to explain why the judgments of a group are usually more\r\ncoherent, and often more true to form than the remarks of the man in\r\nthe street. One mind, or a few can pursue a train of thought, but a\r\ngroup trying to think in concert can as a group do little more than\r\nassent or dissent. The members of a hierarchy can have a corporate\r\ntradition. As apprentices they learn the trade from the masters, who\r\nin turn learned it when they were apprentices, and in any enduring\r\nsociety, the change of personnel within the governing hierarchies is\r\nslow enough to permit the transmission of certain great stereotypes\r\nand patterns of behavior. From father to son, from prelate to novice,\r\nfrom veteran to cadet, certain ways of seeing and doing are taught.\r\nThese ways become familiar, and are recognized as such by the mass of\r\noutsiders.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nDistance alone lends enchantment to the view that masses of human\r\nbeings ever coöperate in any complex affair without a central machine\r\nmanaged by a very few people. \"No one,\" says Bryce, [Footnote: _Op.\r\ncit._, Vol. II, p. 542.] \"can have had some years' experience of\r\nthe conduct of affairs in a legislature or an administration without\r\nobserving how extremely small is the number of persons by whom the\r\nworld is governed.\" He is referring, of course, to affairs of state.\r\nTo be sure if you consider all the affairs of mankind the number of\r\npeople who govern is considerable, but if you take any particular\r\ninstitution, be it a legislature, a party, a trade union, a\r\nnationalist movement, a factory, or a club, the number of those who\r\ngovern is a very small percentage of those who are theoretically\r\nsupposed to govern.\r\n\r\nLandslides can turn one machine out and put another in; revolutions\r\nsometimes abolish a particular machine altogether. The democratic\r\nrevolution set up two alternating machines, each of which in the\r\ncourse of a few years reaps the advantage from the mistakes of the\r\nother. But nowhere does the machine disappear. Nowhere is the idyllic\r\ntheory of democracy realized. Certainly not in trades unions, nor in\r\nsocialist parties, nor in communist governments. There is an inner\r\ncircle, surrounded by concentric circles which fade out gradually into\r\nthe disinterested or uninterested rank and file.\r\n\r\nDemocrats have never come to terms with this commonplace of group\r\nlife. They have invariably regarded it as perverse. For there are two\r\nvisions of democracy: one presupposes the self-sufficient individual;\r\nthe other an Oversoul regulating everything.\r\n\r\nOf the two the Oversoul has some advantage because it does at least\r\nrecognize that the mass makes decisions that are not spontaneously\r\nborn in the breast of every member. But the Oversoul as presiding\r\ngenius in corporate behavior is a superfluous mystery if we fix our\r\nattention upon the machine. The machine is a quite prosaic reality. It\r\nconsists of human beings who wear clothes and live in houses, who can\r\nbe named and described. They perform all the duties usually assigned\r\nto the Oversoul.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe reason for the machine is not the perversity of human nature. It\r\nis that out of the private notions of any group no common idea emerges\r\nby itself. For the number of ways is limited in which a multitude of\r\npeople can act directly upon a situation beyond their reach. Some of\r\nthem can migrate, in one form or another, they can strike or boycott,\r\nthey can applaud or hiss. They can by these means occasionally resist\r\nwhat they do not like, or coerce those who obstruct what they desire.\r\nBut by mass action nothing can be constructed, devised, negotiated, or\r\nadministered. A public as such, without an organized hierarchy around\r\nwhich it can gather, may refuse to buy if the prices are too high, or\r\nrefuse to work if wages are too low. A trade union can by mass action\r\nin a strike break an opposition so that the union officials can\r\nnegotiate an agreement. It may win, for example, the _right_ to\r\njoint control. But it cannot exercise the right except through an\r\norganization. A nation can clamor for war, but when it goes to war it\r\nmust put itself under orders from a general staff.\r\n\r\nThe limit of direct action is for all practical purposes the power to\r\nsay Yes or No on an issue presented to the mass. [Footnote: _Cf_.\r\nJames, _Some Problems of Philosophy_, p. 227. \"But for most of\r\nour emergencies, fractional solutions are impossible. Seldom can we\r\nact fractionally.\" _Cf_. Lowell, _Public Opinion and Popular\r\nGovernment_, pp. 91, 92.] For only in the very simplest cases does\r\nan issue present itself in the same form spontaneously and\r\napproximately at the same time to all the members of a public. There\r\nare unorganized strikes and boycotts, not merely industrial ones,\r\nwhere the grievance is so plain that virtually without leadership the\r\nsame reaction takes place in many people. But even in these\r\nrudimentary cases there are persons who know what they want to do more\r\nquickly than the rest, and who become impromptu ringleaders. Where\r\nthey do not appear a crowd will mill about aimlessly beset by all its\r\nprivate aims, or stand by fatalistically, as did a crowd of fifty\r\npersons the other day, and watch a man commit suicide.\r\n\r\nFor what we make out of most of the impressions that come to us from\r\nthe invisible world is a kind of pantomime played out in revery. The\r\nnumber of times is small that we consciously decide anything about\r\nevents beyond our sight, and each man's opinion of what he could\r\naccomplish if he tried, is slight. There is rarely a practical issue,\r\nand therefore no great habit of decision. This would be more evident\r\nwere it not that most information when it reaches us carries with it\r\nan aura of suggestion as to how we ought to feel about the news. That\r\nsuggestion we need, and if we do not find it in the news we turn to\r\nthe editorials or to a trusted adviser. The revery, if we feel\r\nourselves implicated, is uncomfortable until we know where we stand,\r\nthat is, until the facts have been formulated so that we can feel Yes\r\nor No in regard to them.\r\n\r\nWhen a number of people all say Yes they may have all kinds of reasons\r\nfor saying it. They generally do. For the pictures in their minds are,\r\nas we have already noted, varied in subtle and intimate ways. But this\r\nsubtlety remains within their minds; it becomes represented publicly\r\nby a number of symbolic phrases which carry the individual emotion\r\nafter evacuating most of the intention. The hierarchy, or, if it is a\r\ncontest, then the two hierarchies, associate the symbols with a\r\ndefinite action, a vote of Yes or No, an attitude pro or con. Then\r\nSmith who was against the League and Jones who was against Article X,\r\nand Brown who was against Mr. Wilson and all his works, each for his\r\nown reason, all in the name of more or less the same symbolic phrase,\r\nregister a vote _against_ the Democrats by voting for the\r\nRepublicans. A common will has been expressed.\r\n\r\nA concrete choice had to be presented, the choice had to be connected,\r\nby the transfer of interest through the symbols, with individual\r\nopinion. The professional politicians learned this long before the\r\ndemocratic philosophers. And so they organized the caucus, the\r\nnominating convention, and the steering committee, as the means of\r\nformulating a definite choice. Everyone who wishes to accomplish\r\nanything that requires the cooperation of a large number of people\r\nfollows their example. Sometimes it is done rather brutally as when\r\nthe Peace Conference reduced itself to the Council of Ten, and the\r\nCouncil of Ten to the Big Three or Four; and wrote a treaty which the\r\nminor allies, their own constituents, and the enemy were permitted to\r\ntake or leave. More consultation than that is generally possible and\r\ndesirable. But the essential fact remains that a small number of heads\r\npresent a choice to a large group.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe abuses of the steering committee have led to various proposals\r\nsuch as the initiative, referendum and direct primary. But these\r\nmerely postponed or obscured the need for a machine by complicating\r\nthe elections, or as H. G. Wells once said with scrupulous accuracy,\r\nthe selections. For no amount of balloting can obviate the need of\r\ncreating an issue, be it a measure or a candidate, on which the voters\r\ncan say Yes, or No. There is, in fact, no such thing as \"direct\r\nlegislation.\" For what happens where it is supposed to exist? The\r\ncitizen goes to the polls, receives a ballot on which a number of\r\nmeasures are printed, almost always in abbreviated form, and, if he\r\nsays anything at all, he says Yes or No. The most brilliant amendment\r\nin the world may occur to him. He votes Yes or No on that bill and no\r\nother. You have to commit violence against the English language to\r\ncall that legislation. I do not argue, of course, that there are no\r\nbenefits, whatever you call the process. I think that for certain\r\nkinds of issues there are distinct benefits. But the necessary\r\nsimplicity of any mass decision is a very important fact in view of\r\nthe inevitable complexity of the world in which those decisions\r\noperate. The most complicated form of voting that anyone proposes is,\r\nI suppose, the preferential ballot. Among a number of candidates\r\npresented the voter under that system, instead of saying yes to one\r\ncandidate and no to all the others, states the order of his choice.\r\nBut even here, immensely more flexible though it is, the action of the\r\nmass depends upon the quality of the choices presented. [Footnote:\r\n_Cf._ H. J. Laski, _Foundations of Sovereignty,_ p. 224. \"...\r\nproportional representation... by leading, as it seems to lead, to the\r\ngroup system... may deprive the electors of their choice of leaders.\"\r\nThe group system undoubtedly tends, as Mr. Laski says, to make the\r\nselection of the executive more indirect, but there is no doubt also\r\nthat it tends to produce legislative assemblies in which currents of\r\nopinion are more fully represented. Whether that is good or bad\r\ncannot be determined a priori. But one can say that successful\r\ncooperation and responsibility in a more accurately representative\r\nassembly require a higher organization of political intelligence and\r\npolitical habit, than in a rigid two-party house. It is a more complex\r\npolitical form and may therefore work less well.] And those choices\r\nare presented by the energetic coteries who hustle about with\r\npetitions and round up the delegates. The Many can elect after the Few\r\nhave nominated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLEADERS AND THE RANK AND FILE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBECAUSE of their transcendent practical importance, no successful\r\nleader has ever been too busy to cultivate the symbols which organize\r\nhis following. What privileges do within the hierarchy, symbols do for\r\nthe rank and file. They conserve unity. From the totem pole to the\r\nnational flag, from the wooden idol to God the Invisible King, from\r\nthe magic word to some diluted version of Adam Smith or Bentham,\r\nsymbols have been cherished by leaders, many of whom were themselves\r\nunbelievers, because they were focal points where differences merged.\r\nThe detached observer may scorn the \"star-spangled\" ritual which\r\nhedges the symbol, perhaps as much as the king who told himself that\r\nParis was worth a few masses. But the leader knows by experience that\r\nonly when symbols have done their work is there a handle he can use to\r\nmove a crowd. In the symbol emotion is discharged at a common target,\r\nand the idiosyncrasy of real ideas blotted out. No wonder he hates\r\nwhat he calls destructive criticism, sometimes called by free spirits\r\nthe elimination of buncombe. \"Above all things,\" says Bagehot, \"our\r\nroyalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it you\r\ncannot reverence it.\" [Footnote: _The English Constitution,_ p.\r\n127. D. Appleton & Company, 1914.] For poking about with clear\r\ndefinitions and candid statements serves all high purposes known to\r\nman, except the easy conservation of a common will. Poking about, as\r\nevery responsible leader suspects, tends to break the transference of\r\nemotion from the individual mind to the institutional symbol. And the\r\nfirst result of that is, as he rightly says, a chaos of individualism\r\nand warring sects. The disintegration of a symbol, like Holy Russia,\r\nor the Iron Diaz, is always the beginning of a long upheaval.\r\n\r\nThese great symbols possess by transference all the minute and\r\ndetailed loyalties of an ancient and stereotyped society. They evoke\r\nthe feeling that each individual has for the landscape, the furniture,\r\nthe faces, the memories that are his first, and in a static society,\r\nhis only reality. That core of images and devotions without which he\r\nis unthinkable to himself, is nationality. The great symbols take up\r\nthese devotions, and can arouse them without calling forth the\r\nprimitive images. The lesser symbols of public debate, the more casual\r\nchatter of politics, are always referred back to these proto-symbols,\r\nand if possible associated with them. The question of a proper fare on\r\na municipal subway is symbolized as an issue between the People and\r\nthe Interests, and then the People is inserted in the symbol American,\r\nso that finally in the heat of a campaign, an eight cent fare becomes\r\nunAmerican. The Revolutionary fathers died to prevent it. Lincoln\r\nsuffered that it might not come to pass, resistance to it was implied\r\nin the death of those who sleep in France.\r\n\r\nBecause of its power to siphon emotion out of distinct ideas, the\r\nsymbol is both a mechanism of solidarity, and a mechanism of\r\nexploitation. It enables people to work for a common end, but just\r\nbecause the few who are strategically placed must choose the concrete\r\nobjectives, the symbol is also an instrument by which a few can fatten\r\non many, deflect criticism, and seduce men into facing agony for\r\nobjects they do not understand.\r\n\r\nMany aspects of our subjection to symbols are not flattering if we\r\nchoose to think of ourselves as realistic, self-sufficient, and\r\nself-governing personalities. Yet it is impossible to conclude that\r\nsymbols are altogether instruments of the devil. In the realm of\r\nscience and contemplation they are undoubtedly the tempter himself.\r\nBut in the world of action they may be beneficent, and are sometimes a\r\nnecessity. The necessity is often imagined, the peril manufactured.\r\nBut when quick results are imperative, the manipulation of masses\r\nthrough symbols may be the only quick way of having a critical thing\r\ndone. It is often more important to act than to understand. It is\r\nsometimes true that the action would fail if everyone understood it.\r\nThere are many affairs which cannot wait for a referendum or endure\r\npublicity, and there are times, during war for example, when a nation,\r\nan army, and even its commanders must trust strategy to a very few\r\nminds; when two conflicting opinions, though one happens to be right,\r\nare more perilous than one opinion which is wrong. The wrong opinion\r\nmay have bad results, but the two opinions may entail disaster by\r\ndissolving unity. [Footnote: Captain Peter S. Wright, Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Supreme War Council, _At the Supreme War\r\nCouncil,_ is well worth careful reading on secrecy and unity of\r\ncommand, even though in respect to the allied leaders he wages a\r\npassionate polemic.]\r\n\r\nThus Foch and Sir Henry Wilson, who foresaw the impending disaster to\r\nCough's army, as a consequence of the divided and scattered reserves,\r\nnevertheless kept their opinions well within a small circle, knowing\r\nthat even the risk of a smashing defeat was less certainly\r\ndestructive, than would have been an excited debate in the newspapers.\r\nFor what matters most under the kind of tension which prevailed in\r\nMarch, 1918, is less the rightness of a particular move than the\r\nunbroken expectation as to the source of command. Had Foch \"gone to\r\nthe people\" he might have won the debate, but long before he could\r\nhave won it, the armies which he was to command would have dissolved.\r\nFor the spectacle of a row on Olympus is diverting and destructive.\r\n\r\nBut so also is a conspiracy of silence. Says Captain Wright: \"It is in\r\nthe High Command and not in the line, that the art of camouflage is\r\nmost practiced, and reaches to highest flights. All chiefs everywhere\r\nare now kept painted, by the busy work of numberless publicists, so as\r\nto be mistaken for Napoleons--at a distance....It becomes almost\r\nimpossible to displace these Napoleons, whatever their incompetence,\r\nbecause of the enormous public support created by hiding or glossing\r\nfailure, and exaggerating or inventing success.... But the most\r\ninsidious and worst effect of this so highly organized falsity is on\r\nthe generals themselves: modest and patriotic as they mostly are, and\r\nas most men must be to take up and follow the noble profession of\r\narms, they themselves are ultimately affected by these universal\r\nillusions, and reading it every morning in the paper, they also grow\r\npersuaded they are thunderbolts of war and infallible, however much\r\nthey fail, and that their maintenance in command is an end so sacred\r\nthat it justifies the use of any means.... These various conditions,\r\nof which this great deceit is the greatest, at last emancipate all\r\nGeneral Staffs from all control. They no longer live for the nation:\r\nthe nation lives, or rather dies, for them. Victory or defeat ceases\r\nto be the prime interest. What matters to these semi-sovereign\r\ncorporations is whether dear old Willie or poor old Harry is going to\r\nbe at their head, or the Chantilly party prevail over the Boulevard\r\ndes Invalides party.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, pp. 98, 101-105.]\r\n\r\nYet Captain Wright who can be so eloquent and so discerning about the\r\ndangers of silence is forced nevertheless to approve the silence of\r\nFoch in not publicly destroying the illusions. There is here a\r\ncomplicated paradox, arising as we shall see more fully later on,\r\nbecause the traditional democratic view of life is conceived, not for\r\nemergencies and dangers, but for tranquillity and harmony. And so\r\nwhere masses of people must coöperate in an uncertain and eruptive\r\nenvironment, it is usually necessary to secure unity and flexibility\r\nwithout real consent. The symbol does that. It obscures personal\r\nintention, neutralizes discrimination, and obfuscates individual\r\npurpose. It immobilizes personality, yet at the same time it\r\nenormously sharpens the intention of the group and welds that group,\r\nas nothing else in a crisis can weld it, to purposeful action. It\r\nrenders the mass mobile though it immobilizes personality. The symbol\r\nis the instrument by which in the short run the mass escapes from its\r\nown inertia, the inertia of indecision, or the inertia of headlong\r\nmovement, and is rendered capable of being led along the zigzag of a\r\ncomplex situation.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBut in the longer run, the give and take increases between the leaders\r\nand the led. The word most often used to describe the state of mind in\r\nthe rank and file about its leaders is morale. That is said to be good\r\nwhen the individuals do the part allotted to them with all their\r\nenergy; when each man's whole strength is evoked by the command from\r\nabove. It follows that every leader must plan his policy with this in\r\nmind. He must consider his decision not only on \"the merits,\" but also\r\nin its effect on any part of his following whose continued support he\r\nrequires. If he is a general planning an attack, he knows that his\r\norganized military units will scatter into mobs if the percentage of\r\ncasualties rises too high.\r\n\r\nIn the Great War previous calculations were upset to an extraordinary\r\ndegree, for \"out of every nine men who went to France five became\r\ncasualties.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit_., p. 37. Figures taken by\r\nCaptain Wright from the statistical abstract of the war in the\r\nArchives of the War Office. The figures refer apparently to the\r\nEnglish losses alone, possibly to the English and French.] The limit\r\nof endurance was far greater than anyone had supposed. But there was a\r\nlimit somewhere. And so, partly because of its effect on the enemy,\r\nbut also in great measure because of its effect on the troops and\r\ntheir families, no command in this war dared to publish a candid\r\nstatement of its losses. In France the casualty lists were never\r\npublished. In England, America, and Germany publication of the losses\r\nof a big battle were spread out over long periods so as to destroy a\r\nunified impression of the total. Only the insiders knew until long\r\nafterwards what the Somme had cost, or the Flanders battles;\r\n[Footnote: _Op cit._, p. 34, the Somme cost nearly 500,000\r\ncasualties; the Arras and Flanders offensives of 1917 cost 650,000\r\nBritish casualties.] and Ludendorff undoubtedly had a very much more\r\naccurate idea of these casualties than any private person in London,\r\nParis or Chicago. All the leaders in every camp did their best to\r\nlimit the amount of actual war which any one soldier or civilian could\r\nvividly conceive. But, of course, among old veterans like the French\r\ntroops of 1917, a great deal more is known about war than ever reaches\r\nthe public. Such an army begins to judge its commanders in terms of\r\nits own suffering. And then, when another extravagant promise of\r\nvictory turns out to be the customary bloody defeat, you may find that\r\na mutiny breaks out over some comparatively minor blunder, [Footnote:\r\nThe Allies suffered many bloodier defeats than that on the Chemin des\r\nDames.] like Nivelle's offensive of 1917, because it is a cumulative\r\nblunder. Revolutions and mutinies generally follow a small sample of a\r\nbig series of evils. [Footnote: _Cf._ Pierrefeu's account, _op.\r\ncit._, on the causes of the Soissons mutinies, and the method\r\nadopted by Pétain to deal with them. Vol. I, Part III, _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThe incidence of policy determines the relation between leader and\r\nfollowing. If those whom he needs in his plan are remote from the\r\nplace where the action takes place, if the results are hidden or\r\npostponed, if the individual obligations are indirect or not yet due,\r\nabove all if assent is an exercise of some pleasurable emotion, the\r\nleader is likely to have a free hand. Those programs are immediately\r\nmost popular, like prohibition among teetotalers, which do not at once\r\nimpinge upon the private habits of the followers. That is one great\r\nreason why governments have such a free hand in foreign affairs. Most\r\nof the frictions between two states involve a series of obscure and\r\nlong-winded contentions, occasionally on the frontier, but far more\r\noften in regions about which school geographies have supplied no\r\nprecise ideas. In Czechoslovakia America is regarded as the Liberator;\r\nin American newspaper paragraphs and musical comedy, in American\r\nconversation by and large, it has never been finally settled whether\r\nthe country we liberated is Czechoslavia or Jugoslovakia.\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs the incidence of policy is for a very long time\r\nconfined to an unseen environment. Nothing that happens out there is\r\nfelt to be wholly real. And so, because in the ante-bellum period,\r\nnobody has to fight and nobody has to pay, governments go along\r\naccording to their lights without much reference to their people. In\r\nlocal affairs the cost of a policy is more easily visible. And\r\ntherefore, all but the most exceptional leaders prefer policies in\r\nwhich the costs are as far as possible indirect.\r\n\r\nThey do not like direct taxation. They do not like to pay as they go.\r\nThey like long term debts. They like to have the voters believe that\r\nthe foreigner will pay. They have always been compelled to calculate\r\nprosperity in terms of the producer rather than in terms of the\r\nconsumer, because the incidence on the consumer is distributed over so\r\nmany trivial items. Labor leaders have always preferred an increase of\r\nmoney wages to a decrease in prices. There has always been more\r\npopular interest in the profits of millionaires, which are visible but\r\ncomparatively unimportant, than in the wastes of the industrial\r\nsystem, which are huge but elusive. A legislature dealing with a\r\nshortage of houses, such as exists when this is written, illustrates\r\nthis rule, first by doing nothing to increase the number of houses,\r\nsecond by smiting the greedy landlord on the hip, third by\r\ninvestigating the profiteering builders and working men. For a\r\nconstructive policy deals with remote and uninteresting factors, while\r\na greedy landlord, or a profiteering plumber is visible and immediate.\r\n\r\nBut while people will readily believe that in an unimagined future and\r\nin unseen places a certain policy will benefit them, the actual\r\nworking out of policy follows a different logic from their opinions. A\r\nnation may be induced to believe that jacking up the freight rates\r\nwill make the railroads prosperous. But that belief will not make the\r\nroads prosperous, if the impact of those rates on farmers and shippers\r\nis such as to produce a commodity price beyond what the consumer can\r\npay. Whether the consumer will pay the price depends not upon whether\r\nhe nodded his head nine months previously at the proposal to raise\r\nrates and save business, but on whether he now wants a new hat or a\r\nnew automobile enough to pay for them.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nLeaders often pretend that they have merely uncovered a program which\r\nexisted in the minds of their public. When they believe it, they are\r\nusually deceiving themselves. Programs do not invent themselves\r\nsynchronously in a multitude of minds. That is not because a multitude\r\nof minds is necessarily inferior to that of the leaders, but because\r\nthought is the function of an organism, and a mass is not an organism.\r\n\r\nThis fact is obscured because the mass is constantly exposed to\r\nsuggestion. It reads not the news, but the news with an aura of\r\nsuggestion about it, indicating the line of action to be taken. It\r\nhears reports, not objective as the facts are, but already stereotyped\r\nto a certain pattern of behavior. Thus the ostensible leader often\r\nfinds that the real leader is a powerful newspaper proprietor. But if,\r\nas in a laboratory, one could remove all suggestion and leading from\r\nthe experience of a multitude, one would, I think, find something like\r\nthis: A mass exposed to the same stimuli would develop responses that\r\ncould theoretically be charted in a polygon of error. There would be a\r\ncertain group that felt sufficiently alike to be classified together.\r\nThere would be variants of feeling at both ends. These classifications\r\nwould tend to harden as individuals in each of the classifications\r\nmade their reactions vocal. That is to say, when the vague feelings of\r\nthose who felt vaguely had been put into words, they would know more\r\ndefinitely what they felt, and would then feel it more definitely.\r\n\r\nLeaders in touch with popular feeling are quickly conscious of these\r\nreactions. They know that high prices are pressing upon the mass, or\r\nthat certain classes of individuals are becoming unpopular, or that\r\nfeeling towards another nation is friendly or hostile. But, always\r\nbarring the effect of suggestion which is merely the assumption of\r\nleadership by the reporter, there would be nothing in the feeling of\r\nthe mass that fatally determined the choice of any particular policy.\r\nAll that the feeling of the mass demands is that policy as it is\r\ndeveloped and exposed shall be, if not logically, then by analogy and\r\nassociation, connected with the original feeling.\r\n\r\nSo when a new policy is to be launched, there is a preliminary bid for\r\ncommunity of feeling, as in Mark Antony's speech to the followers of\r\nBrutus. [Footnote: Excellently analyzed in Martin, _The Behavior of\r\nCrowds,_ pp. 130-132,] In the first phase, the leader vocalizes the\r\nprevalent opinion of the mass. He identifies himself with the familiar\r\nattitudes of his audience, sometimes by telling a good story,\r\nsometimes by brandishing his patriotism, often by pinching a\r\ngrievance. Finding that he is trustworthy, the multitude milling\r\nhither and thither may turn in towards him. He will then be expected\r\nto set forth a plan of campaign. But he will not find that plan in the\r\nslogans which convey the feelings of the mass. It will not even always\r\nbe indicated by them. Where the incidence of policy is remote, all\r\nthat is essential is that the program shall be verbally and\r\nemotionally connected at the start with what has become vocal in the\r\nmultitude. Trusted men in a familiar role subscribing to the accepted\r\nsymbols can go a very long way on their own initiative without\r\nexplaining the substance of their programs.\r\n\r\nBut wise leaders are not content to do that. Provided they think\r\npublicity will not strengthen opposition too much, and that debate\r\nwill not delay action too long, they seek a certain measure of\r\nconsent. They take, if not the whole mass, then the subordinates of\r\nthe hierarchy sufficiently into their confidence to prepare them for\r\nwhat might happen, and to make them feel that they have freely willed\r\nthe result. But however sincere the leader may be, there is always,\r\nwhen the facts are very complicated, a certain amount of illusion in\r\nthese consultations. For it is impossible that all the contingencies\r\nshall be as vivid to the whole public as they are to the more\r\nexperienced and the more imaginative. A fairly large percentage are\r\nbound to agree without having taken the time, or without possessing\r\nthe background, for appreciating the choices which the leader presents\r\nto them. No one, however, can ask for more. And only theorists do. If\r\nwe have had our day in court, if what we had to say was heard, and\r\nthen if what is done comes out well, most of us do not stop to\r\nconsider how much our opinion affected the business in hand.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and\r\nwell-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and\r\nactually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how\r\nslowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceeding, they\r\nhave little to fear. It takes stupendous and persistent blundering,\r\nplus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below.\r\nPalace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different\r\nmatter. So, too, is demagogy. That stops at relieving the tension by\r\nexpressing the feeling. But the statesman knows that such relief is\r\ntemporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary. He, therefore, sees\r\nto it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program\r\nthat deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.\r\n\r\nBut all leaders are not statesmen, all leaders hate to resign, and\r\nmost leaders find it hard to believe that bad as things are, the other\r\nfellow would not make them worse. They do not passively wait for the\r\npublic to feel the incidence of policy, because the incidence of that\r\ndiscovery is generally upon their own heads. They are, therefore,\r\nintermittently engaged in mending their fences and consolidating their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe mending of fences consists in offering an occasional scapegoat, in\r\nredressing a minor grievance affecting a powerful individual or\r\nfaction, rearranging certain jobs, placating a group of people who\r\nwant an arsenal in their home town, or a law to stop somebody's vices.\r\nStudy the daily activity of any public official who depends on\r\nelection and you can enlarge this list. There are Congressmen elected\r\nyear after year who never think of dissipating their energy on public\r\naffairs. They prefer to do a little service for a lot of people on a\r\nlot of little subjects, rather than to engage in trying to do a big\r\nservice out there in the void. But the number of people to whom any\r\norganization can be a successful valet is limited, and shrewd\r\npoliticians take care to attend either the influential, or somebody so\r\nblatantly uninfluential that to pay any attention to him is a mark of\r\nsensational magnanimity. The far greater number who cannot be held by\r\nfavors, the anonymous multitude, receive propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe established leaders of any organization have great natural\r\nadvantages. They are believed to have better sources of information.\r\nThe books and papers are in their offices. They took part in the\r\nimportant conferences. They met the important people. They have\r\nresponsibility. It is, therefore, easier for them to secure attention\r\nand to speak in a convincing tone. But also they have a very great\r\ndeal of control over the access to the facts. Every official is in\r\nsome degree a censor. And since no one can suppress information,\r\neither by concealing it or forgetting to mention it, without some\r\nnotion of what he wishes the public to know, every leader is in some\r\ndegree a propagandist. Strategically placed, and compelled often to\r\nchoose even at the best between the equally cogent though conflicting\r\nideals of safety for the institution, and candor to his public, the\r\nofficial finds himself deciding more and more consciously what facts,\r\nin what setting, in what guise he shall permit the public to know.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThat the manufacture of consent is capable of great refinements no\r\none, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is\r\ncertainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and\r\nthe opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the\r\nprocess are plain enough.\r\n\r\nThe creation of consent is not a new art. It is a very old one which\r\nwas supposed to have died out with the appearance of democracy. But it\r\nhas not died out. It has, in fact, improved enormously in technic,\r\nbecause it is now based on analysis rather than on rule of thumb. And\r\nso, as a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern\r\nmeans of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner.\r\nA revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any\r\nshifting of economic power.\r\n\r\nWithin the life of the generation now in control of affairs,\r\npersuasion has become a self-conscious art and a regular organ of\r\npopular government. None of us begins to understand the consequences,\r\nbut it is no daring prophecy to say that the knowledge of how to\r\ncreate consent will alter every political calculation and modify every\r\npolitical premise. Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in\r\nthe sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our\r\nthinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example,\r\nto believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge\r\nneeded for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from\r\nthe human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to\r\nself-deception, and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It\r\nhas been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience,\r\nor the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world\r\nbeyond our reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nTHE IMAGE OF DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\"I confess that in America I saw more than America;\r\nI sought the image of democracy itself.\"\r\n\r\nAlexis de Tocqueville.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.

THE OLD IMAGE IN A NEW FORM: GUILD SOCIALISM\r\n   \"    20. A NEW IMAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE SELF-CENTERED MAN\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nSINCE Public Opinion is supposed to be the prime mover in democracies,\r\none might reasonably expect to find a vast literature. One does not\r\nfind it. There are excellent books on government and parties, that is,\r\non the machinery which in theory registers public opinions after they\r\nare formed. But on the sources from which these public opinions arise,\r\non the processes by which they are derived, there is relatively\r\nlittle. The existence of a force called Public Opinion is in the main\r\ntaken for granted, and American political writers have been most\r\ninterested either in finding out how to make government express the\r\ncommon will, or in how to prevent the common will from subverting the\r\npurposes for which they believe the government exists. According to\r\ntheir traditions they have wished either to tame opinion or to obey\r\nit. Thus the editor of a notable series of text-books writes that \"the\r\nmost difficult and the most momentous question of government (is) how\r\nto transmit the force of individual opinion into public\r\naction.\" [Footnote: Albert Bushnell Hart in the Introductory note to A.\r\nLawrence Lowell's _Public Opinion and Popular Government. _]\r\n\r\nBut surely there is a still more momentous question, the question of\r\nhow to validate our private versions of the political scene. There is,\r\nas I shall try to indicate further on, the prospect of radical\r\nimprovement by the development of principles already in operation. But\r\nthis development will depend on how well we learn to use knowledge of\r\nthe way opinions are put together to watch over our own opinions when\r\nthey are being put together. For casual opinion, being the product of\r\npartial contact, of tradition, and personal interests, cannot in the\r\nnature of things take kindly to a method of political thought which is\r\nbased on exact record, measurement, analysis and comparison. Just\r\nthose qualities of the mind which determine what shall seem\r\ninteresting, important, familiar, personal, and dramatic, are the\r\nqualities which in the first instance realistic opinion frustrates.\r\nTherefore, unless there is in the community at large a growing\r\nconviction that prejudice and intuition are not enough, the working\r\nout of realistic opinion, which takes time, money, labor, conscious\r\neffort, patience, and equanimity, will not find enough support. That\r\nconviction grows as self-criticism increases, and makes us conscious\r\nof buncombe, contemptuous of ourselves when we employ it, and on guard\r\nto detect it. Without an ingrained habit of analyzing opinion when we\r\nread, talk, and decide, most of us would hardly suspect the need of\r\nbetter ideas, nor be interested in them when they appear, nor be able\r\nto prevent the new technic of political intelligence from being\r\nmanipulated.\r\n\r\nYet democracies, if we are to judge by the oldest and most powerful of\r\nthem, have made a mystery out of public opinion. There have been\r\nskilled organizers of opinion who understood the mystery well enough\r\nto create majorities on election day. But these organizers have been\r\nregarded by political science as low fellows or as \"problems,\" not as\r\npossessors of the most effective knowledge there was on how to create\r\nand operate public opinion. The tendency of the people who have voiced\r\nthe ideas of democracy, even when they have not managed its action,\r\nthe tendency of students, orators, editors, has been to look upon\r\nPublic Opinion as men in other societies looked upon the uncanny\r\nforces to which they ascribed the last word in the direction of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nFor in almost every political theory there is an inscrutable element\r\nwhich in the heyday of that theory goes unexamined. Behind the\r\nappearances there is a Fate, there are Guardian Spirits, or Mandates\r\nto a Chosen People, a Divine Monarchy, a Vice-Regent of Heaven, or a\r\nClass of the Better Born. The more obvious angels, demons, and kings\r\nare gone out of democratic thinking, but the need for believing that\r\nthere are reserve powers of guidance persists. It persisted for those\r\nthinkers of the Eighteenth Century who designed the matrix of\r\ndemocracy. They had a pale god, but warm hearts, and in the doctrine\r\nof popular sovereignty they found the answer to their need of an\r\ninfallible origin for the new social order. There was the mystery, and\r\nonly enemies of the people touched it with profane and curious hands.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThey did not remove the veil because they were practical politicians\r\nin a bitter and uncertain struggle. They had themselves felt the\r\naspiration of democracy, which is ever so much deeper, more intimate\r\nand more important than any theory of government. They were engaged,\r\nas against the prejudice of ages, in the assertion of human dignity.\r\nWhat possessed them was not whether John Smith had sound views on any\r\npublic question, but that John Smith, scion of a stock that had always\r\nbeen considered inferior, would now bend his knee to no other man. It\r\nwas this spectacle that made it bliss \"in that dawn to be alive.\" But\r\nevery analyst seems to degrade that dignity, to deny that all men are\r\nreasonable all the time, or educated, or informed, to note that people\r\nare fooled, that they do not always know their own interests, and that\r\nall men are not equally fitted to govern.\r\n\r\nThe critics were about as welcome as a small boy with a drum. Every\r\none of these observations on the fallibility of man was being\r\nexploited ad nauseam. Had democrats admitted there was truth in any of\r\nthe aristocratic arguments they would have opened a breach in the\r\ndefenses. And so just as Aristotle had to insist that the slave was a\r\nslave by nature, the democrats had to insist that the free man was a\r\nlegislator and administrator by nature. They could not stop to explain\r\nthat a human soul might not yet have, or indeed might never have, this\r\ntechnical equipment, and that nevertheless it had an inalienable right\r\nnot to be used as the unwilling instrument of other men. The superior\r\npeople were still too strong and too unscrupulous to have refrained\r\nfrom capitalizing so candid a statement.\r\n\r\nSo the early democrats insisted that a reasoned righteousness welled\r\nup spontaneously out of the mass of men. All of them hoped that it\r\nwould, many of them believed that it did, although the cleverest, like\r\nThomas Jefferson, had all sorts of private reservations. But one thing\r\nwas certain: if public opinion did not come forth spontaneously,\r\nnobody in that age believed it would come forth at all. For in one\r\nfundamental respect the political science on which democracy was based\r\nwas the same science that Aristotle formulated. It was the same\r\nscience for democrat and aristocrat, royalist and republican, in that\r\nits major premise assumed the art of government to be a natural\r\nendowment. Men differed radically when they tried to name the men so\r\nendowed; but they agreed in thinking that the greatest question of all\r\nwas to find those in whom political wisdom was innate. Royalists were\r\nsure that kings were born to govern. Alexander Hamilton thought that\r\nwhile \"there are strong minds in every walk of life... the\r\nrepresentative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on\r\nthe spirit of the government, will be composed of landholders,\r\nmerchants, and men of the learned professions.\" [Footnote: _The\r\nFederalist_, Nos. 35, 36. _Cf_. comment by Henry Jones Ford in\r\nhis _Rise and Growth of American Politics_. Ch. V.] Jefferson\r\nthought the political faculties were deposited by God in farmers and\r\nplanters, and sometimes spoke as if they were found in all the people.\r\n[Footnote: See below p. 268.] The main premise was the same: to govern\r\nwas an instinct that appeared, according to your social preferences,\r\nin one man or a chosen few, in all males, or only in males who were\r\nwhite and twenty-one, perhaps even in all men and all women.\r\n\r\nIn deciding who was most fit to govern, knowledge of the world was\r\ntaken for granted. The aristocrat believed that those who dealt with\r\nlarge affairs possessed the instinct, the democrats asserted that all\r\nmen possessed the instinct and could therefore deal with large\r\naffairs. It was no part of political science in either case to think\r\nout how knowledge of the world could be brought to the ruler. If you\r\nwere for the people you did not try to work out the question of how to\r\nkeep the voter informed. By the age of twenty-one he had his political\r\nfaculties. What counted was a good heart, a reasoning mind, a balanced\r\njudgment. These would ripen with age, but it was not necessary to\r\nconsider how to inform the heart and feed the reason. Men took in\r\ntheir facts as they took in their breath.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nBut the facts men could come to possess in this effortless way were\r\nlimited. They could know the customs and more obvious character of the\r\nplace where they lived and worked. But the outer world they had to\r\nconceive, and they did not conceive it instinctively, nor absorb\r\ntrustworthy knowledge of it just by living. Therefore, the only\r\nenvironment in which spontaneous politics were possible was one\r\nconfined within the range of the ruler's direct and certain knowledge.\r\nThere is no escaping this conclusion, wherever you found government on\r\nthe natural range of men's faculties. \"If,\" as Aristotle said,\r\n[Footnote: _Politics_, Bk. VII, Ch. 4.] \"the citizens of a state\r\nare to judge and distribute offices according to merit, then they must\r\nknow each other's characters; where they do not possess this\r\nknowledge, both the election to offices and the decision of law suits\r\nwill go wrong.\"\r\n\r\nObviously this maxim was binding upon every school of political\r\nthought. But it presented peculiar difficulties to the democrats.\r\nThose who believed in class government could fairly claim that in the\r\ncourt of the king, or in the country houses of the gentry, men did\r\nknow each other's characters, and as long as the rest of mankind was\r\npassive, the only characters one needed to know were the characters of\r\nmen in the ruling class. But the democrats, who wanted to raise the\r\ndignity of all men, were immediately involved by the immense size and\r\nconfusion of their ruling class--the male electorate. Their science\r\ntold them that politics was an instinct, and that the instinct worked\r\nin a limited environment. Their hopes bade them insist that all men in\r\na very large environment could govern. In this deadly conflict between\r\ntheir ideals and their science, the only way out was to assume without\r\nmuch discussion that the voice of the people was the voice of God.\r\n\r\nThe paradox was too great, the stakes too big, their ideal too\r\nprecious for critical examination. They could not show how a citizen\r\nof Boston was to stay in Boston and conceive the views of a Virginian,\r\nhow a Virginian in Virginia could have real opinions about the\r\ngovernment at Washington, how Congressmen in Washington could have\r\nopinions about China or Mexico. For in that day it was not possible\r\nfor many men to have an unseen environment brought into the field of\r\ntheir judgment. There had been some advances, to be sure, since\r\nAristotle. There were a few newspapers, and there were books, better\r\nroads perhaps, and better ships. But there was no great advance, and\r\nthe political assumptions of the Eighteenth Century had essentially to\r\nbe those that had prevailed in political science for two thousand\r\nyears. The pioneer democrats did not possess the material for\r\nresolving the conflict between the known range of man's attention and\r\ntheir illimitable faith in his dignity.\r\n\r\nTheir assumptions antedated not only the modern newspaper, the\r\nworld-wide press services, photography and moving pictures, but, what\r\nis really more significant, they antedated measurement and record,\r\nquantitative and comparative analysis, the canons of evidence, and the\r\nability of psychological analysis to correct and discount the\r\nprejudices of the witness. I do not mean to say that our records are\r\nsatisfactory, our analysis unbiased, our measurements sound. I do mean\r\nto say that the key inventions have been made for bringing the unseen\r\nworld into the field of judgment. They had not been made in the time\r\nof Aristotle, and they were not yet important enough to be visible for\r\npolitical theory in the age of Rousseau, Montesquieu, or Thomas\r\nJefferson. In a later chapter I think we shall see that even in the\r\nlatest theory of human reconstruction, that of the English Guild\r\nSocialists, all the deeper premises have been taken over from this\r\nolder system of political thought.\r\n\r\nThat system, whenever it was competent and honest, had to assume that\r\nno man could have more than a very partial experience of public\r\naffairs. In the sense that he can give only a little time to them,\r\nthat assumption is still true, and of the utmost consequence. But\r\nancient theory was compelled to assume, not only that men could give\r\nlittle attention to public questions, but that the attention available\r\nwould have to be confined to matters close at hand. It would have been\r\nvisionary to suppose that a time would come when distant and\r\ncomplicated events could conceivably be reported, analyzed, and\r\npresented in such a form that a really valuable choice could be made\r\nby an amateur. That time is now in sight. There is no longer any doubt\r\nthat the continuous reporting of an unseen environment is feasible. It\r\nis often done badly, but the fact that it is done at all shows that it\r\ncan be done, and the fact that we begin to know how badly it is often\r\ndone, shows that it can be done better. With varying degrees of skill\r\nand honesty distant complexities are reported every day by engineers\r\nand accountants for business men, by secretaries and civil servants\r\nfor officials, by intelligence officers for the General Staff, by some\r\njournalists for some readers. These are crude beginnings but radical,\r\nfar more radical in the literal meaning of that word than the\r\nrepetition of wars, revolutions, abdications and restorations; as\r\nradical as the change in the scale of human life which has made it\r\npossible for Mr. Lloyd George to discuss Welsh coal mining after\r\nbreakfast in London, and the fate of the Arabs before dinner in Paris.\r\n\r\nFor the possibility of bringing any aspect of human affairs within the\r\nrange of judgment breaks the spell which has lain upon political\r\nideas. There have, of course, been plenty of men who did not realize\r\nthat the range of attention was the main premise of political science.\r\nThey have built on sand. They have demonstrated in their own persons\r\nthe effects of a very limited and self-centered knowledge of the\r\nworld. But for the political thinkers who have counted, from Plato and\r\nAristotle through Machiavelli and Hobbes to the democratic theorists,\r\nspeculation has revolved around the self-centered man who had to see\r\nthe whole world by means of a few pictures in his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SELF-CONTAINED COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHAT groups of self-centered people would engage in a struggle for\r\nexistence if they rubbed against each other has always been evident.\r\nThis much truth there is at any rate in that famous passage in the\r\nLeviathan where Hobbes says that \"though there had never been any time\r\nwherein particular men were in a condition of war one against another,\r\nyet at all times kings and _persons_ of _sovereign authority\r\nbecause_ of their _independency_, are in continual jealousies\r\nand in the state and posture of gladiators, having their weapons\r\npointing, and their eyes fixed on one another...\" [Footnote:\r\n_Leviathan_, Ch. XIII. Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as\r\nconcerning their Felicity and Misery.]\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nTo circumvent this conclusion one great branch of human thought, which\r\nhad and has many schools, proceeded in this fashion: it conceived an\r\nideally just pattern of human relations in which each person had well\r\ndefined functions and rights. If he conscientiously filled the role\r\nallotted to him, it did not matter whether his opinions were right or\r\nwrong. He did his duty, the next man did his, and all the dutiful\r\npeople together made a harmonious world. Every caste system\r\nillustrates this principle; you find it in Plato's Republic and in\r\nAristotle, in the feudal ideal, in the circles of Dante's Paradise, in\r\nthe bureaucratic type of socialism, and in laissez-faire, to an\r\namazing degree in syndicalism, guild socialism, anarchism, and in the\r\nsystem of international law idealized by Mr. Robert Lansing. All of\r\nthem assume a pre-established harmony, inspired, imposed, or innate,\r\nby which the self-opinionated person, class, or community is\r\norchestrated with the rest of mankind. The more authoritarian imagine\r\na conductor for the symphony who sees to it that each man plays his\r\npart; the anarchistic are inclined to think that a more divine concord\r\nwould be heard if each player improvised as he went along.\r\n\r\nBut there have also been philosophers who were bored by these schemes\r\nof rights and duties, took conflict for granted, and tried to see how\r\ntheir side might come out on top. They have always seemed more\r\nrealistic, even when they seemed alarming, because all they had to do\r\nwas to generalize the experience that nobody could escape. Machiavelli\r\nis the classic of this school, a man most mercilessly maligned,\r\nbecause he happened to be the first naturalist who used plain language\r\nin a field hitherto preempted by supernaturalists. [Footnote: F. S.\r\nOliver in his _Alexander Hamilton_, says of Machiavelli (p. 174):\r\n\"Assuming the conditions which exist--the nature of man and of\r\nthings--to be unchangeable, he proceeds in a calm, unmoral way, like a\r\nlecturer on frogs, to show how a valiant and sagacious ruler can best\r\nturn events to his own advantage and the security of his dynasty.\"] He\r\nhas a worse name and more disciples than any political thinker who\r\never lived. He truly described the technic of existence for the\r\nself-contained state. That is why he has the disciples. He has the bad\r\nname chiefly because he cocked his eye at the Medici family, dreamed\r\nin his study at night where he wore his \"noble court dress\" that\r\nMachiavelli was himself the Prince, and turned a pungent description\r\nof the way things are done into an eulogy on that way of doing them.\r\n\r\nIn his most infamous chapter [Footnote: _The Prince_, Ch. XVIII.\r\n\"Concerning the way in which Princes should keep faith.\" Translation\r\nby W. K. Marriott.] he wrote that \"a prince ought to take care that he\r\nnever lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the\r\nabove-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who hears and\r\nsees him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and\r\nreligious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this\r\nlast quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by\r\nthe hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come\r\nin touch with you. Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really\r\nknow what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the\r\nopinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them;\r\nand in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is\r\nnot prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.... One prince of\r\nthe present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything\r\nelse but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and\r\neither, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and\r\nkingdom many a time.\"\r\n\r\nThat is cynical. But it is the cynicism of a man who saw truly without\r\nknowing quite why he saw what he saw. Machiavelli is thinking of the\r\nrun of men and princes \"who judge generally more by the eye than by\r\nthe hand,\" which is his way of saying that their judgments are\r\nsubjective. He was too close to earth to pretend that the Italians of\r\nhis day saw the world steadily and saw it whole. He would not indulge\r\nin fantasies, and he had not the materials for imagining a race of men\r\nthat had learned how to correct their vision.\r\n\r\nThe world, as he found it, was composed of people whose vision could\r\nrarely be corrected, and Machiavelli knew that such people, since they\r\nsee all public relations in a private way, are involved in perpetual\r\nstrife. What they see is their own personal, class, dynastic, or\r\nmunicipal version of affairs that in reality extend far beyond the\r\nboundaries of their vision. They see their aspect. They see it as\r\nright. But they cross other people who are similarly self-centered.\r\nThen their very existence is endangered, or at least what they, for\r\nunsuspected private reasons, regard as their existence and take to be\r\na danger. The end, which is impregnably based on a real though private\r\nexperience justifies the means. They will sacrifice any one of these\r\nideals to save all of them,... \"one judges by the result...\"\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThese elemental truths confronted the democratic philosophers.\r\nConsciously or otherwise, they knew that the range of political\r\nknowledge was limited, that the area of self-government would have to\r\nbe limited, and that self-contained states when they rubbed against\r\neach other were in the posture of gladiators. But they knew just as\r\ncertainly, that there was in men a will to decide their own fate, and\r\nto find a peace that was not imposed by force. How could they\r\nreconcile the wish and the fact?\r\n\r\nThey looked about them. In the city states of Greece and Italy they\r\nfound a chronicle of corruption, intrigue and war. [Footnote:\r\n\"Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention...\r\nand have in general been as short in their lives as they have been\r\nviolent in their deaths.\" Madison, _Federalist_, No. 10.] In\r\ntheir own cities they saw faction, artificiality, fever. This was no\r\nenvironment in which the democratic ideal could prosper, no place\r\nwhere a group of independent and equally competent people managed\r\ntheir own affairs spontaneously. They looked further, guided somewhat\r\nperhaps by Jean Jacques Rousseau, to remote, unspoiled country\r\nvillages. They saw enough to convince themselves that there the ideal\r\nwas at home. Jefferson in particular felt this, and Jefferson more\r\nthan any other man formulated the American image of democracy. From\r\nthe townships had come the power that had carried the American\r\nRevolution to victory. From the townships were to come the votes that\r\ncarried Jefferson's party to power. Out there in the farming\r\ncommunities of Massachusetts and Virginia, if you wore glasses that\r\nobliterated the slaves, you could see with your mind's eye the image\r\nof what democracy was to be.\r\n\r\n\"The American Revolution broke out,\" says de Tocqueville, [Footnote:\r\n_Democracy in America,_ Vol. I, p. 51. Third Edition] \"and the\r\ndoctrine of the sovereignty of the people, which had been nurtured in\r\nthe townships, took possession of the state.\" It certainly took\r\npossession of the minds of those men who formulated and popularized\r\nthe stereotypes of democracy. \"The cherishment of the people was our\r\nprinciple,\" wrote Jefferson. [Footnote: Cited in Charles Beard,\r\n_Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy._ Ch. XIV. ] But the\r\npeople he cherished almost exclusively were the small landowning\r\nfarmers: \"Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God,\r\nif ever He had a chosen people, whose breasts He has made his peculiar\r\ndeposit for substantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in which\r\nHe keeps alive that sacred fire, which otherwise might escape from the\r\nface of the earth. Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is\r\na phenomenon of which no age nor nation has furnished an example.\"\r\n\r\nHowever much of the romantic return to nature may have entered into\r\nthis exclamation, there was also an element of solid sense. Jefferson\r\nwas right in thinking that a group of independent farmers comes nearer\r\nto fulfilling the requirements of spontaneous democracy than any other\r\nhuman society. But if you are to preserve the ideal, you must fence\r\noff these ideal communities from the abominations of the world. If the\r\nfarmers are to manage their own affairs, they must confine affairs to\r\nthose they are accustomed to managing. Jefferson drew all these\r\nlogical conclusions. He disapproved of manufacture, of foreign\r\ncommerce, and a navy, of intangible forms of property, and in theory\r\nof any form of government that was not centered in the small\r\nself-governing group. He had critics in his day: one of them remarked\r\nthat \"wrapt up in the fullness of self-consequence and strong enough,\r\nin reality, to defend ourselves against every invader, we might enjoy\r\nan eternal rusticity and live, forever, thus apathized and vulgar\r\nunder the shelter of a selfish, satisfied indifference.\" [Footnote:\r\n_Op. cit_., p. 426.]\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe democratic ideal, as Jefferson moulded it, consisting of an ideal\r\nenvironment and a selected class, did not conflict with the political\r\nscience of his time. It did conflict with the realities. And when the\r\nideal was stated in absolute terms, partly through exuberance and\r\npartly for campaign purposes, it was soon forgotten that the theory\r\nwas originally devised for very special conditions. It became the\r\npolitical gospel, and supplied the stereotypes through which Americans\r\nof all parties have looked at politics.\r\n\r\nThat gospel was fixed by the necessity that in Jefferson's time no one\r\ncould have conceived public opinions that were not spontaneous and\r\nsubjective. The democratic tradition is therefore always trying to see\r\na world where people are exclusively concerned with affairs of which\r\nthe causes and effects all operate within the region they inhabit.\r\nNever has democratic theory been able to conceive itself in the\r\ncontext of a wide and unpredictable environment. The mirror is\r\nconcave. And although democrats recognize that they are in contact\r\nwith external affairs, they see quite surely that every contact\r\noutside that self-contained group is a threat to democracy as\r\noriginally conceived. That is a wise fear. If democracy is to be\r\nspontaneous, the interests of democracy must remain simple,\r\nintelligible, and easily managed. Conditions must approximate those of\r\nthe isolated rural township if the supply of information is to be left\r\nto casual experience. The environment must be confined within the\r\nrange of every man's direct and certain knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe democrat has understood what an analysis of public opinion seems\r\nto demonstrate: that in dealing with an unseen environment decisions\r\n\"are manifestly settled at haphazard, which clearly they ought not to\r\nbe.\" [Footnote: Aristotle, _Politics_, Bk. VII, Ch. IV.] So he\r\nhas always tried in one way or another to minimize the importance of\r\nthat unseen environment. He feared foreign trade because trade\r\ninvolves foreign connections; he distrusted manufactures because they\r\nproduced big cities and collected crowds; if he had nevertheless to\r\nhave manufactures, he wanted protection in the interest of\r\nself-sufficiency. When he could not find these conditions in the real\r\nworld, he went passionately into the wilderness, and founded Utopian\r\ncommunities far from foreign contacts. His slogans reveal his\r\nprejudice. He is for Self-Government, Self-Determination,\r\nIndependence. Not one of these ideas carries with it any notion of\r\nconsent or community beyond the frontiers of the self-governing\r\ngroups. The field of democratic action is a circumscribed area. Within\r\nprotected boundaries the aim has been to achieve self-sufficiency and\r\navoid entanglement. This rule is not confined to foreign policy, but\r\nit is plainly evident there, because life outside the national\r\nboundaries is more distinctly alien than any life within. And as\r\nhistory shows, democracies in their foreign policy have had generally\r\nto choose between splendid isolation and a diplomacy that violated\r\ntheir ideals. The most successful democracies, in fact, Switzerland,\r\nDenmark, Australia, New Zealand, and America until recently, have had\r\nno foreign policy in the European sense of that phrase. Even a rule\r\nlike the Monroe Doctrine arose from the desire to supplement the two\r\noceans by a glacis of states that were sufficiently republican to have\r\nno foreign policy.\r\n\r\nWhereas danger is a great, perhaps an indispensable condition of\r\nautocracy, [Footnote: Fisher Ames, frightened by the democratic\r\nrevolution of 1800, wrote to Rufus King in 1802: \"We need, as all\r\nnations do, the compression on the outside of our circle of a\r\nformidable neighbor, whose presence shall at all times excite stronger\r\nfears than demagogues can inspire the people with towards their\r\ngovernment.\" Cited by Ford, _Rise and Growth of American\r\nPolitics,_ p. 69.] security was seen to be a necessity if democracy\r\nwas to work. There must be as little disturbance as possible of the\r\npremise of a self-contained community. Insecurity involves surprises.\r\nIt means that there are people acting upon your life, over whom you\r\nhave no control, with whom you cannot consult. It means that forces\r\nare at large which disturb the familiar routine, and present novel\r\nproblems about which quick and unusual decisions are required. Every\r\ndemocrat feels in his bones that dangerous crises are incompatible\r\nwith democracy, because he knows that the inertia of masses is such\r\nthat to act quickly a very few must decide and the rest follow rather\r\nblindly. This has not made non-resistants out of democrats, but it has\r\nresulted in all democratic wars being fought for pacifist aims. Even\r\nwhen the wars are in fact wars of conquest, they are sincerely\r\nbelieved to be wars in defense of civilization.\r\n\r\nThese various attempts to enclose a part of the earth's surface were\r\nnot inspired by cowardice, apathy, or, what one of Jefferson's critics\r\ncalled a willingness to live under monkish discipline. The democrats\r\nhad caught sight of a dazzling possibility, that every human being\r\nshould rise to his full stature, freed from man-made limitations. With\r\nwhat they knew of the art of government, they could, no more than\r\nAristotle before them, conceive a society of autonomous individuals,\r\nexcept an enclosed and simple one. They could, then, select no other\r\npremise if they were to reach the conclusion that all the people could\r\nspontaneously manage their public affairs.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nHaving adopted the premise because it was necessary to their keenest\r\nhope, they drew other conclusions as well. Since in order to have\r\nspontaneous self-government, you had to have a simple self-contained\r\ncommunity, they took it for granted that one man was as competent as\r\nthe next to manage these simple and self-contained affairs. Where the\r\nwish is father to the thought such logic is convincing. Moreover, the\r\ndoctrine of the omnicompetent citizen is for most practical purposes\r\ntrue in the rural township. Everybody in a village sooner or later\r\ntries his hand at everything the village does. There is rotation in\r\noffice by men who are jacks of all trades. There was no serious\r\ntrouble with the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen until the\r\ndemocratic stereotype was universally applied, so that men looked at a\r\ncomplicated civilization and saw an enclosed village.\r\n\r\nNot only was the individual citizen fitted to deal with all public\r\naffairs, but he was consistently public-spirited and endowed with\r\nunflagging interest. He was public-spirited enough in the township,\r\nwhere he knew everybody and was interested in everybody's business.\r\nThe idea of enough for the township turned easily into the idea of\r\nenough for any purpose, for as we have noted, quantitative thinking\r\ndoes not suit a stereotype. But there was another turn to the circle.\r\nSince everybody was assumed to be interested enough in important\r\naffairs, only those affairs came to seem important in which everybody\r\nwas interested.\r\n\r\nThis meant that men formed their picture of the world outside from the\r\nunchallenged pictures in their heads. These pictures came to them well\r\nstereotyped by their parents and teachers, and were little corrected\r\nby their own experience. Only a few men had affairs that took them\r\nacross state lines. Even fewer had reason to go abroad. Most voters\r\nlived their whole lives in one environment, and with nothing but a few\r\nfeeble newspapers, some pamphlets, political speeches, their religious\r\ntraining, and rumor to go on, they had to conceive that larger\r\nenvironment of commerce and finance, of war and peace. The number of\r\npublic opinions based on any objective report was very small in\r\nproportion to those based on casual fancy.\r\n\r\nAnd so for many different reasons, self-sufficiency was a spiritual\r\nideal in the formative period. The physical isolation of the township,\r\nthe loneliness of the pioneer, the theory of democracy, the Protestant\r\ntradition, and the limitations of political science all converged to\r\nmake men believe that out of their own consciences they must extricate\r\npolitical wisdom. It is not strange that the deduction of laws from\r\nabsolute principles should have usurped so much of their free energy.\r\nThe American political mind had to live on its capital. In legalism it\r\nfound a tested body of rules from which new rules could be spun\r\nwithout the labor of earning new truths from experience. The formulae\r\nbecame so curiously sacred that every good foreign observer has been\r\namazed at the contrast between the dynamic practical energy of the\r\nAmerican people and the static theorism of their public life. That\r\nsteadfast love of fixed principles was simply the only way known of\r\nachieving self-sufficiency. But it meant that the public opinions of\r\nany one community about the outer world consisted chiefly of a few\r\nstereotyped images arranged in a pattern deduced from their legal and\r\ntheir moral codes, and animated by the feeling aroused by local\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nThus democratic theory, starting from its fine vision of ultimate\r\nhuman dignity, was forced by lack of the instruments of knowledge for\r\nreporting its environment, to fall back upon the wisdom and experience\r\nwhich happened to have accumulated in the voter. God had, in the words\r\nof Jefferson, made men's breasts \"His peculiar deposit for substantial\r\nand genuine virtue.\" These chosen people in their self-contained\r\nenvironment had all the facts before them. The environment was so\r\nfamiliar that one could take it for granted that men were talking\r\nabout substantially the same things. The only real disagreements,\r\ntherefore, would be in judgments about the same facts. There was no\r\nneed to guarantee the sources of information. They were obvious, and\r\nequally accessible to all men. Nor was there need to trouble about the\r\nultimate criteria. In the self-contained community one could assume,\r\nor at least did assume, a homogeneous code of morals. The only place,\r\ntherefore, for differences of opinion was in the logical application\r\nof accepted standards to accepted facts. And since the reasoning\r\nfaculty was also well standardized, an error in reasoning would be\r\nquickly exposed in a free discussion. It followed that truth could be\r\nobtained by liberty within these limits. The community could take its\r\nsupply of information for granted; its codes it passed on through\r\nschool, church, and family, and the power to draw deductions from a\r\npremise, rather than the ability to find the premise, was regarded as\r\nthe chief end of intellectual training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ROLE OF FORCE, PATRONAGE AND PRIVILEGE\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\"IT has happened as was to have been foreseen,\" wrote Hamilton,\r\n[Footnote: _Federalist,_ No. 15] \"the measures of the Union have\r\nnot been executed; the delinquencies of the States have, step by step,\r\nmatured themselves to an extreme which has at length arrested all the\r\nwheels of the national government and brought them to an awful\r\nstand.\"... For \"in our case the concurrence of thirteen distinct\r\nsovereign wills is requisite, under the confederation, to the complete\r\nexecution of every important measure that proceeds from the Union.\"\r\nHow could it be otherwise, he asked: \"The rulers of the respective\r\nmembers... will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures\r\nthemselves. They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or\r\nrequired to their immediate interests or aims; the momentary\r\nconveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All\r\nthis will be done, and in a spirit of interested and suspicious\r\nscrutiny, without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons\r\nof state which is essential to right judgment, and with that strong\r\npredilection in favor of local objects which can hardly fail to\r\nmislead the decision. The same process must be repeated in every\r\nmember of which the body is constituted; and the execution of the\r\nplans framed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on\r\nthe discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every\r\npart. Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular\r\nassemblies, who have seen how difficult it often is, when there is no\r\nexterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious\r\nresolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible\r\nit must be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a\r\ndistance from each other, at different times, and under different\r\nimpressions, long to coöperate in the same views and pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nOver ten years of storm and stress with a congress that was, as John\r\nAdams said, [Footnote: Ford, _op. cit._, p. 36.] \"only a diplomatic\r\nassembly,\" had furnished the leaders of the revolution \"with an\r\ninstructive but afflicting lesson\" [Footnote: _Federalist_,  No. 15.]\r\nin what happens when a number of self-centered  communities\r\nare entangled in the same environment. And so,  when they went\r\nto Philadelphia in May of 1787, ostensibly to revise the Articles of\r\nConfederation, they were really in full reaction against the\r\nfundamental premise of Eighteenth Century democracy. Not only\r\nwere the leaders consciously opposed to the democratic spirit of\r\nthe time, feeling, as Madison said, that \"democracies have ever\r\nbeen spectacles of turbulence and contention,\" but within the\r\nnational frontiers they were determined to offset as far as they could\r\nthe ideal of self-governing communities in self-contained environments.\r\nThe collisions and failures of concave democracy, where men\r\nspontaneously managed all their own affairs, were before their eyes.\r\nThe problem as they saw it, was to restore government as against\r\ndemocracy. They understood government to be the power to make\r\nnational decisions and enforce them throughout the nation;\r\ndemocracy they believed was the insistence of localities and classes\r\nupon self-determination in accordance with their immediate interests\r\nand aims.\r\n\r\nThey could not consider in their calculations the possibility of such\r\nan organization of knowledge that separate communities would act\r\nsimultaneously on the same version of the facts. We just begin to\r\nconceive this possibility for certain parts of the world where there\r\nis free circulation of news and a common language, and then only for\r\ncertain aspects of life. The whole idea of a voluntary federalism in\r\nindustry and world politics is still so rudimentary, that, as we see\r\nin our own experience, it enters only a little, and only very\r\nmodestly, into practical politics. What we, more than a century later,\r\ncan only conceive as an incentive to generations of intellectual\r\neffort, the authors of the Constitution had no reason to conceive at\r\nall. In order to set up national government, Hamilton and his\r\ncolleagues had to make plans, not on the theory that men would\r\ncoöperate because they had a sense of common interest, but on the\r\ntheory that men could be governed, if special interests were kept in\r\nequilibrium by a balance of power. \"Ambition,\" Madison said,\r\n[Footnote: _Federalist_, No. 51, cited by Ford, _op. cit._,\r\np. 60.] \"must be made to counteract ambition.\"\r\n\r\nThey did not, as some writers have supposed, intend to balance every\r\ninterest so that the government would be in a perpetual deadlock. They\r\nintended to deadlock local and class interest to prevent these from\r\nobstructing government. \"In framing a government which is to be\r\nadministered by men over men,\" wrote Madison, [Footnote: _Id_.]\r\n\"the great difficulty lies in this: _you must first enable the\r\ngovernment to control the governed_, and in the next place, oblige\r\nit to control itself.\" In one very important sense, then, the doctrine\r\nof checks and balances was the remedy of the federalist leaders for\r\nthe problem of public opinion. They saw no other way to substitute\r\n\"the mild influence of the magistracy\" for the \"sanguinary agency of\r\nthe sword\" [Footnote: _Federalist, No. 15.] except by devising an\r\ningenious machine to neutralize local opinion. They did not understand\r\nhow to manipulate a large electorate, any more than they saw the\r\npossibility of common consent upon the basis of common information. It\r\nis true that Aaron Burr taught Hamilton a lesson which impressed him a\r\ngood deal when he seized control of New York City in 1800 by the aid\r\nof Tammany Hall. But Hamilton was killed before he was able to take\r\naccount of this new discovery, and, as Mr. Ford says, [Footnote: Ford,\r\n_op. cit._, p. 119.] Burr's pistol blew the brains out of the\r\nFederal party.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhen the constitution was written, \"politics could still be managed by\r\nconference and agreement among gentlemen\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._,\r\np. 144] and it was to the gentry that Hamilton turned for a\r\ngovernment. It was intended that they should manage national affairs\r\nwhen local prejudice had been brought into equilibrium by the\r\nconstitutional checks and balances. No doubt Hamilton, who belonged to\r\nthis class by adoption, had a human prejudice in their favor. But that\r\nby itself is a thin explanation of his statecraft. Certainly there can\r\nbe no question of his consuming passion for union, and it is, I think,\r\nan inversion of the truth to argue that he made the Union to protect\r\nclass privileges, instead of saying that he used class privileges to\r\nmake the Union. \"We must take man as we find him,\" Hamilton said, \"and\r\nif we expect him to serve the public we must interest his passions in\r\ndoing so.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 47] He needed men to govern,\r\nwhose passions could be most quickly attached to a national interest.\r\nThese were the gentry, the public creditors, manufacturers, shippers,\r\nand traders, [Footnote: Beard, _Economic Interpretation of the\r\nConstitution, passim._] and there is probably no better instance in\r\nhistory of the adaptation of shrewd means to clear ends, than in the\r\nseries of fiscal measures, by which Hamilton attached the provincial\r\nnotables to the new government.\r\n\r\nAlthough the constitutional convention worked behind closed doors, and\r\nalthough ratification was engineered by \"a vote of probably not more\r\nthan one-sixth of the adult males,\" [Footnote: Beard, _op. cit._,\r\np. 325.] there was little or no pretence. The Federalists argued for\r\nunion, not for democracy, and even the word republic had an unpleasant\r\nsound to George Washington when he had been for more than two years a\r\nrepublican president. The constitution was a candid attempt to limit\r\nthe sphere of popular rule; the only democratic organ it was intended\r\nthe government should possess was the House, based on a suffrage\r\nhighly limited by property qualifications. And even at that, the\r\nHouse, it was believed, would be so licentious a part of the\r\ngovernment, that it was carefully checked and balanced by the Senate,\r\nthe electoral college, the Presidential veto, and by judicial\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nThus at the moment when the French Revolution was kindling popular\r\nfeeling the world over, the American revolutionists of 1776 came under\r\na constitution which went back, as far as it was expedient, to the\r\nBritish Monarchy for a model. This conservative reaction could not\r\nendure. The men who had made it were a minority, their motives were\r\nunder suspicion, and when Washington went into retirement, the\r\nposition of the gentry was not strong enough to survive the inevitable\r\nstruggle for the succession. The anomaly between the original plan of\r\nthe Fathers and the moral feeling of the age was too wide not to be\r\ncapitalized by a good politician.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nJefferson referred to his election as \"the great revolution of 1800,\"\r\nbut more than anything else it was a revolution in the mind. No great\r\npolicy was altered, but a new tradition was established. For it was\r\nJefferson who first taught the American people to regard the\r\nConstitution as an instrument of democracy, and he stereotyped the\r\nimages, the ideas, and even many of the phrases, in which Americans\r\never since have described politics to each other. So complete was the\r\nmental victory, that twenty-five years later de Tocqueville, who was\r\nreceived in Federalist homes, noted that even those who were \"galled\r\nby its continuance\"--were not uncommonly heard to \"laud the delights\r\nof a republican government, and the advantages of democratic\r\ninstitutions when they are in public.\" [Footnote: _Democracy in\r\nAmerica_, Vol. I, Ch. X (Third Edition, 1838), p. 216.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Fathers with all their sagacity had failed to see\r\nthat a frankly undemocratic constitution would not long be tolerated.\r\nThe bold denial of popular rule was bound to offer an easy point of\r\nattack to a man, like Jefferson, who so far as his constitutional\r\nopinions ran, was not a bit more ready than Hamilton to turn over\r\ngovernment to the \"unrefined\" will of the people. [Footnote:\r\n_Cf._ his plan for the Constitution of Virginia, his ideas for a\r\nsenate of property holders, and his views on the judicial veto. Beard,\r\n_Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy_, pp. 450 _et\r\nseq._] The Federalist leaders had been men of definite convictions\r\nwho stated them bluntly. There was little real discrepancy between\r\ntheir public and their private views. But Jefferson's mind was a mass\r\nof ambiguities, not solely because of its defects, as Hamilton and his\r\nbiographers have thought, but because he believed in a union and he\r\nbelieved in spontaneous democracies, and in the political science of\r\nhis age there was no satisfactory way to reconcile the two. Jefferson\r\nwas confused in thought and action because he had a vision of a new\r\nand tremendous idea that no one had thought out in all its bearings.\r\nBut though popular sovereignty was not clearly understood by anybody,\r\nit seemed to imply so great an enhancement of human life, that no\r\nconstitution could stand which frankly denied it. The frank denials\r\nwere therefore expunged from consciousness, and the document, which is\r\non its face an honest example of limited constitutional democracy, was\r\ntalked and thought about as an instrument for direct popular rule.\r\nJefferson actually reached the point of believing that the Federalists\r\nhad perverted the Constitution, of which in his fancy they were no\r\nlonger the authors. And so the Constitution was, in spirit, rewritten.\r\nPartly by actual amendment, partly by practice, as in the case of the\r\nelectoral college, but chiefly by looking at it through another set of\r\nstereotypes, the facade was no longer permitted to look oligarchic.\r\n\r\nThe American people came to believe that their Constitution was a\r\ndemocratic instrument, and treated it as such. They owe that fiction\r\nto the victory of Thomas Jefferson, and a great conservative fiction\r\nit has been. It is a fair guess that if everyone had always regarded\r\nthe Constitution as did the authors of it, the Constitution would have\r\nbeen violently overthrown, because loyalty to the Constitution and\r\nloyalty to democracy would have seemed incompatible. Jefferson\r\nresolved that paradox by teaching the American people to read the\r\nConstitution as an expression of democracy. He himself stopped there.\r\nBut in the course of twenty-five years or so social conditions had\r\nchanged so radically, that Andrew Jackson carried out the political\r\nrevolution for which Jefferson had prepared the tradition. [Footnote:\r\nThe reader who has any doubts as to the extent of the revolution that\r\nseparated Hamilton's opinions from Jackson's practice should turn to\r\nMr. Henry Jones Ford's _Rise and Growth of American Politics_.]\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe political center of that revolution was the question of patronage.\r\nBy the men who founded the government public office was regarded as a\r\nspecies of property, not lightly to be disturbed, and it was\r\nundoubtedly their hope that the offices would remain in the hands of\r\ntheir social class. But the democratic theory had as one of its main\r\nprinciples the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen. Therefore, when\r\npeople began to look at the Constitution as a democratic instrument,\r\nit was certain that permanence in office would seem undemocratic. The\r\nnatural ambitions of men coincided here with the great moral impulse\r\nof their age. Jefferson had popularized the idea without carrying it\r\nruthlessly into practice, and removals on party grounds were\r\ncomparatively few under the Virginian Presidents. It was Jackson who\r\nfounded the practice of turning public office into patronage.\r\n\r\nCurious as it sounds to us, the principle of rotation in office with\r\nshort terms was regarded as a great reform. Not only did it\r\nacknowledge the new dignity of the average man by treating him as fit\r\nfor any office, not only did it destroy the monopoly of a small social\r\nclass and appear to open careers to talent, but \"it had been advocated\r\nfor centuries as a sovereign remedy for political corruption,\" and as\r\nthe one way to prevent the creation of a bureaucracy. [Footnote: Ford,\r\n_op. cit._, p. 169.] The practice of rapid change in public\r\noffice was the application to a great territory of the image of\r\ndemocracy derived from the self-contained village.\r\n\r\nNaturally it did not have the same results in the nation that it had\r\nin the ideal community on which the democratic theory was based. It\r\nproduced quite unexpected results, for it founded a new governing\r\nclass to take the place of the submerged federalists. Unintentionally,\r\npatronage did for a large electorate what Hamilton's fiscal measures\r\nhad done for the upper classes. We often fail to realize how much of\r\nthe stability of our government we owe to patronage. For it was\r\npatronage that weaned natural leaders from too much attachment to the\r\nself-centered community, it was patronage that weakened the local\r\nspirit and brought together in some kind of peaceful cooperation, the\r\nvery men who, as provincial celebrities, would, in the absence of a\r\nsense of common interest, have torn the union apart.\r\n\r\nBut of course, the democratic theory was not supposed to produce a new\r\ngoverning class, and it has never accommodated itself to the fact.\r\nWhen the democrat wanted to abolish monopoly of offices, to have\r\nrotation and short terms, he was thinking of the township where anyone\r\ncould do a public service, and return humbly to his own farm. The idea\r\nof a special class of politicians was just what the democrat did not\r\nlike. But he could not have what he did like, because his theory was\r\nderived from an ideal environment, and he was living in a real one.\r\nThe more deeply he felt the moral impulse of democracy, the less ready\r\nhe was to see the profound truth of Hamilton's statement that\r\ncommunities deliberating at a distance and under different impressions\r\ncould not long coöperate in the same views and pursuits. For that\r\ntruth postpones anything like the full realization of democracy in\r\npublic affairs until the art of obtaining common consent has been\r\nradically improved. And so while the revolution under Jefferson and\r\nJackson produced the patronage which made the two party system, which\r\ncreated a substitute for the rule of the gentry, and a discipline for\r\ngoverning the deadlock of the checks and balances, all that happened,\r\nas it were, invisibly.\r\n\r\nThus, rotation in office might be the ostensible theory, in practice\r\nthe offices oscillated between the henchmen. Tenure might not be a\r\npermanent monopoly, but the professional politician was permanent.\r\nGovernment might be, as President Harding once said, a simple thing,\r\nbut winning elections was a sophisticated performance. The salaries in\r\noffice might be as ostentatiously frugal as Jefferson's home-spun, but\r\nthe expenses of party organization and the fruits of victory were in\r\nthe grand manner. The stereotype of democracy controlled the visible\r\ngovernment; the corrections, the exceptions and adaptations of the\r\nAmerican people to the real facts of their environment have had to be\r\ninvisible, even when everybody knew all about them. It was only the\r\nwords of the law, the speeches of politicians, the platforms, and the\r\nformal machinery of administration that have had to conform to the\r\npristine image of democracy.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nIf one had asked a philosophical democrat how these self-contained\r\ncommunities were to coöperate, when their public opinions were so\r\nself-centered, he would have pointed to representative government\r\nembodied in the Congress. And nothing would surprise him more than the\r\ndiscovery of how steadily the prestige of representative government\r\nhas declined, while the power of the Presidency has grown.\r\n\r\nSome critics have traced this to the custom of sending only local\r\ncelebrities to Washington. They have thought that if Congress could\r\nconsist of the nationally eminent men, the life of the capital would\r\nbe more brilliant. It would be, of course, and it would be a very good\r\nthing if retiring Presidents and Cabinet officers followed the example\r\nof John Quincy Adams. But the absence of these men does not explain\r\nthe plight of Congress, for its decline began when it was relatively\r\nthe most eminent branch of the government. Indeed it is more probable\r\nthat the reverse is true, and that Congress ceased to attract the\r\neminent as it lost direct influence on the shaping of national policy.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for the discredit, which is world wide, is, I think,\r\nto be found in the fact that a congress of representatives is\r\nessentially a group of blind men in a vast, unknown world. With some\r\nexceptions, the only method recognized in the Constitution or in the\r\ntheory of representative government, by which Congress can inform\r\nitself, is to exchange opinions from the districts. There is no\r\nsystematic, adequate, and authorized way for Congress to know what is\r\ngoing on in the world. The theory is that the best man of each\r\ndistrict brings the best wisdom of his constituents to a central\r\nplace, and that all these wisdoms combined are all the wisdom that\r\nCongress needs. Now there is no need to question the value of\r\nexpressing local opinions and exchanging them. Congress has great\r\nvalue as the market-place of a continental nation. In the coatrooms,\r\nthe hotel lobbies, the boarding houses of Capitol Hill, at the\r\ntea-parties of the Congressional matrons, and from occasional entries\r\ninto the drawing rooms of cosmopolitan Washington, new vistas are\r\nopened, and wider horizons. But even if the theory were applied, and\r\nthe districts always sent their wisest men, the sum or a combination\r\nof local impressions is not a wide enough base for national policy,\r\nand no base at all for the control of foreign policy. Since the real\r\neffects of most laws are subtle and hidden, they cannot be understood\r\nby filtering local experiences through local states of mind. They can\r\nbe known only by controlled reporting and objective analysis. And just\r\nas the head of a large factory cannot know how efficient it is by\r\ntalking to the foreman, but must examine cost sheets and data that\r\nonly an accountant can dig out for him, so the lawmaker does not\r\narrive at a true picture of the state of the union by putting together\r\na mosaic of local pictures. He needs to know the local pictures, but\r\nunless he possesses instruments for calibrating them, one picture is\r\nas good as the next, and a great deal better.\r\n\r\nThe President does come to the assistance of Congress by delivering\r\nmessages on the state of the Union. He is in a position to do that\r\nbecause he presides over a vast collection of bureaus and their\r\nagents, which report as well as act. But he tells Congress what he\r\nchooses to tell it. He cannot be heckled, and the censorship as to\r\nwhat is compatible with the public interest is in his hands. It is a\r\nwholly one-sided and tricky relationship, which sometimes reaches such\r\nheights of absurdity, that Congress, in order to secure an important\r\ndocument has to thank the enterprise of a Chicago newspaper, or the\r\ncalculated indiscretion of a subordinate official. So bad is the\r\ncontact of legislators with necessary facts that they are forced to\r\nrely either on private tips or on that legalized atrocity, the\r\nCongressional investigation, where Congressmen, starved of their\r\nlegitimate food for thought, go on a wild and feverish man-hunt, and\r\ndo not stop at cannibalism.\r\n\r\nExcept for the little that these investigations yield, the occasional\r\ncommunications from the executive departments, interested and\r\ndisinterested data collected by private persons, such newspapers,\r\nperiodicals, and books as Congressmen read, and a new and excellent\r\npractice of calling for help from expert bodies like the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Tariff\r\nCommission, the creation of Congressional opinion is incestuous. From\r\nthis it follows either that legislation of a national character is\r\nprepared by a few informed insiders, and put through by partisan\r\nforce; or that the legislation is broken up into a collection of local\r\nitems, each of which is enacted for a local reason. Tariff schedules,\r\nnavy yards, army posts, rivers and harbors, post offices and federal\r\nbuildings, pensions and patronage: these are fed out to concave\r\ncommunities as tangible evidence of the benefits of national life.\r\nBeing concave, they can see the white marble building which rises out\r\nof federal funds to raise local realty values and employ local\r\ncontractors more readily than they can judge the cumulative cost of\r\nthe pork barrel. It is fair to say that in a large assembly of men,\r\neach of whom has practical knowledge only of his own district, laws\r\ndealing with translocal affairs are rejected or accepted by the mass\r\nof Congressmen without creative participation of any kind. They\r\nparticipate only in making those laws that can be treated as a bundle\r\nof local issues. For a legislature without effective means of\r\ninformation and analysis must oscillate between blind regularity,\r\ntempered by occasional insurgency, and logrolling. And it is the\r\nlogrolling which makes the regularity palatable, because it is by\r\nlogrolling that a Congressman proves to his more active constituents\r\nthat he is watching their interests as they conceive them.\r\n\r\nThis is no fault of the individual Congressman's, except when he is\r\ncomplacent about it. The cleverest and most industrious representative\r\ncannot hope to understand a fraction of the bills on which he votes.\r\nThe best he can do is to specialize on a few bills, and take\r\nsomebody's word about the rest. I have known Congressmen, when they\r\nwere boning up on a subject, to study as they had not studied since\r\nthey passed their final examinations, many large cups of black coffee,\r\nwet towels and all. They had to dig for information, sweat over\r\narranging and verifying facts, which, in any consciously organized\r\ngovernment, should have been easily available in a form suitable for\r\ndecision. And even when they really knew a subject, their anxieties\r\nhad only begun. For back home the editors, the board of trade, the\r\ncentral federated union, and the women's clubs had spared themselves\r\nthese labors, and were prepared to view the Congressman's performance\r\nthrough local spectacles.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nWhat patronage did to attach political chieftains to the national\r\ngovernment, the infinite variety of local subsidies and privileges do\r\nfor self-centered communities. Patronage and pork amalgamate and\r\nstabilize thousands of special opinions, local discontents, private\r\nambitions. There are but two other alternatives. One is government by\r\nterror and obedience, the other is government based on such a highly\r\ndeveloped system of information, analysis, and self-consciousness that\r\n\"the knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state\" is\r\nevident to all men. The autocratic system is in decay, the voluntary\r\nsystem is in its very earliest development; and so, in calculating the\r\nprospects of association among large groups of people, a League of\r\nNations, industrial government, or a federal union of states, the\r\ndegree to which the material for a common consciousness exists,\r\ndetermines how far cooperation will depend upon force, or upon the\r\nmilder alternative to force, which is patronage and privilege. The\r\nsecret of great state-builders, like Alexander Hamilton, is that they\r\nknow how to calculate these principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE OLD IMAGE IN A NEW FORM: GUILD SOCIALISM.\r\n\r\nWhenever the quarrels of self-centered groups become unbearable,\r\nreformers in the past found themselves forced to choose between two\r\ngreat alternatives. They could take the path to Rome and impose a\r\nRoman peace upon the warring tribes. They could take the path to\r\nisolation, to autonomy and self-sufficiency. Almost always they chose\r\nthat path which they had least recently travelled. If they had tried\r\nout the deadening monotony of empire, they cherished above all other\r\nthings the simple freedom of their own community. But if they had seen\r\nthis simple freedom squandered in parochial jealousies they longed for\r\nthe spacious order of a great and powerful state.\r\n\r\nWhichever choice they made, the essential difficulty was the same. If\r\ndecisions were decentralized they soon floundered in a chaos of local\r\nopinions. If they were centralized, the policy of the state was based\r\non the opinions of a small social set at the capital. In any case\r\nforce was necessary to defend one local right against another, or to\r\nimpose law and order on the localities, or to resist class government\r\nat the center, or to defend the whole society, centralized or\r\ndecentralized, against the outer barbarian.\r\n\r\nModern democracy and the industrial system were both born in a time of\r\nreaction against kings, crown government, and a regime of detailed\r\neconomic regulation. In the industrial sphere this reaction took the\r\nform of extreme devolution, known as laissez-faire individualism. Each\r\neconomic decision was to be made by the man who had title to the\r\nproperty involved. Since almost everything was owned by somebody,\r\nthere would be somebody to manage everything. This was plural\r\nsovereignty with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt was economic government by anybody's economic philosophy, though it\r\nwas supposed to be controlled by immutable laws of political economy\r\nthat must in the end produce harmony. It produced many splendid\r\nthings, but enough sordid and terrible ones to start counter-currents.\r\nOne of these was the trust, which established a kind of Roman peace\r\nwithin industry, and a Roman predatory imperialism outside. People\r\nturned to the legislature for relief. They invoked representative\r\ngovernment, founded on the image of the township farmer, to regulate\r\nthe semi-sovereign corporations. The working class turned to labor\r\norganization. There followed a period of increasing centralization and\r\na sort of race of armaments. The trusts interlocked, the craft unions\r\nfederated and combined into a labor movement, the political system\r\ngrew stronger at Washington and weaker in the states, as the reformers\r\ntried to match its strength against big business.\r\n\r\nIn this period practically all the schools of socialist thought from\r\nthe Marxian left to the New Nationalists around Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nlooked upon centralization as the first stage of an evolution which\r\nwould end in the absorption of all the semi-sovereign powers of\r\nbusiness by the political state. The evolution never took place,\r\nexcept for a few months during the war. That was enough, and there was\r\na turn of the wheel against the omnivorous state in favor of several\r\nnew forms of pluralism. But this time society was to swing back not to\r\nthe atomic individualism of Adam Smith's economic man and Thomas\r\nJefferson's farmer, but to a sort of molecular individualism of\r\nvoluntary groups.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting things about all these oscillations of theory\r\nis that each in turn promises a world in which no one will have to\r\nfollow Machiavelli in order to survive. They are all established by\r\nsome form of coercion, they all exercise coercion in order to maintain\r\nthemselves, and they are all discarded as a result of coercion. Yet\r\nthey do not accept coercion, either physical power or special\r\nposition, patronage, or privilege, as part of their ideal. The\r\nindividualist said that self-enlightened self-interest would bring\r\ninternal and external peace. The socialist is sure that the motives to\r\naggression will disappear. The new pluralist hopes they\r\nwill. [Footnote: See G. D. H. Cole, _Social Theory,_ p. 142.]\r\nCoercion is the surd in almost all social theory, except the\r\nMachiavellian. The temptation to ignore it, because it is absurd,\r\ninexpressible, and unmanageable, becomes overwhelming in any man who\r\nis trying to rationalize human life.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe lengths to which a clever man will sometimes go in order to escape\r\na full recognition of the role of force is shown by Mr. G. D. H.\r\nCole's book on Guild Socialism. The present state, he says, \"is\r\nprimarily an instrument of coercion;\" [Footnote: Cole, _Guild\r\nSocialism_, p. 107.] in a guild socialist society there will be no\r\nsovereign power, though there will be a coordinating body. He calls\r\nthis body the Commune.\r\n\r\nHe then begins to enumerate the powers of the Commune, which, we\r\nrecall, is to be primarily not an instrument of coercion. [Footnote:\r\n_Op. cit._ Ch. VIII.] It settles price disputes. Sometimes it\r\nfixes prices, allocates the surplus or distributes the loss. It\r\nallocates natural resources, and controls the issue of credit. It also\r\n\"allocates communal labor-power.\" It ratifies the budgets of the\r\nguilds and the civil services. It levies taxes. \"All questions of\r\nincome\" fall within its jurisdiction. It \"allocates\" income to the\r\nnon-productive members of the community. It is the final arbiter in\r\nall questions of policy and jurisdiction between the guilds. It passes\r\nconstitutional laws fixing the functions of the functional bodies. It\r\nappoints the judges. It confers coercive powers upon the guilds, and\r\nratifies their by-laws wherever these involve coercion. It declares\r\nwar and makes peace. It controls the armed forces. It is the supreme\r\nrepresentative of the nation abroad. It settles boundary questions\r\nwithin the national state. It calls into existence new functional\r\nbodies, or distributes new functions to old ones. It runs the police.\r\nIt makes whatever laws are necessary to regulate personal conduct and\r\npersonal property.\r\n\r\nThese powers are exercised not by one commune, but by a federal\r\nstructure of local and provincial communes with a National commune at\r\nthe top. Mr. Cole is, of course, welcome to insist that this is not a\r\nsovereign state, but if there is a coercive power now enjoyed by any\r\nmodern government for which he has forgotten to make room, I cannot\r\nthink of it.\r\n\r\nHe tells us, however, that Guild society will be non-coercive: \"we\r\nwant to build a new society which will be conceived in the spirit, not\r\nof coercion, but of free service.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p.\r\n141.] Everyone who shares that hope, as most men and women do, will\r\ntherefore look closely to see what there is in the Guild Socialist\r\nplan which promises to reduce coercion to its lowest limits, even\r\nthough the Guildsmen of to-day have already reserved for their\r\ncommunes the widest kind of coercive power. It is acknowledged at once\r\nthat the new society cannot be brought into existence by universal\r\nconsent. Mr. Cole is too honest to shirk the element of force required\r\nto make the transition. [Footnote: _Cf. op. cit._, Ch. X. ] And\r\nwhile obviously he cannot predict how much civil war there might be,\r\nhe is quite clear that there would have to be a period of direct\r\naction by the trade unions.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nBut leaving aside the problems of transition, and any consideration of\r\nwhat the effect is on their future action, when men have hacked their\r\nway through to the promised land, let us imagine the Guild Society in\r\nbeing. What keeps it running as a non-coercive society?\r\n\r\nMr. Cole has two answers to this question. One is the orthodox Marxian\r\nanswer that the abolition of capitalist property will remove the\r\nmotive to aggression. Yet he does not really believe that, because if\r\nhe did, he would care as little as does the average Marxian how the\r\nworking class is to run the government, once it is in control. If his\r\ndiagnosis were correct, the Marxian would be quite right: if the\r\ndisease were the capitalist class and only the capitalist class,\r\nsalvation would automatically follow its extinction. But Mr. Cole is\r\nenormously concerned about whether the society which follows the\r\nrevolution is to be run by state collectivism, by guilds or\r\ncooperative societies, by a democratic parliament or by functional\r\nrepresentation. In fact, it is as a new theory of representative\r\ngovernment that guild socialism challenges attention.\r\n\r\nThe guildsmen do not expect a miracle to result from the disappearance\r\nof capitalist property rights. They do expect, and of course quite\r\nrightly, that if equality of income were the rule, social relations\r\nwould be profoundly altered. But they differ, as far as I can make\r\nout, from the orthodox Russian communist in this respect: The\r\ncommunist proposes to establish equality by force of the dictatorship\r\nof the proletariat, believing that if once people were equalized both\r\nin income and in service, they would then lose the incentives to\r\naggression. The guildsmen also propose to establish equality by force,\r\nbut are shrewd enough to see that if an equilibrium is to be\r\nmaintained they have to provide institutions for maintaining it.\r\nGuildsmen, therefore, put their faith in what they believe to be a new\r\ntheory of democracy.\r\n\r\nTheir object, says Mr. Cole, is \"to get the mechanism right, and to\r\nadjust it as far as possible to the expression of men's social wills.\"\r\n[Reference: _Op. cit._, p. 16.] These wills need to be given\r\nopportunity for self-expression in self-government \"in any and every\r\nform of social action.\" Behind these words is the true democratic\r\nimpulse, the desire to enhance human dignity, as well as the\r\ntraditional assumption that this human dignity is impugned, unless\r\neach person's will enters into the management of everything that\r\naffects him. The guildsman, like the earlier democrat therefore, looks\r\nabout him for an environment in which this ideal of self-government\r\ncan be realized. A hundred years and more have passed since Rousseau\r\nand Jefferson, and the center of interest has shifted from the country\r\nto the city. The new democrat can no longer turn to the idealized\r\nrural township for the image of democracy. He turns now to the\r\nworkshop. \"The spirit of association must be given free play in the\r\nsphere in which it is best able to find expression. This is manifestly\r\nthe factory, in which men have the habit and tradition of working\r\ntogether. The factory is the natural and fundamental unit of\r\nindustrial democracy. This involves, not only that the factory must be\r\nfree, as far as possible, to manage its own affairs, but also that the\r\ndemocratic unit of the factory must be made the basis of the larger\r\ndemocracy of the Guild, and that the larger organs of Guild\r\nadministration and government must be based largely on the principle\r\nof factory representation.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 40.]\r\n\r\nFactory is, of course, a very loose word, and Mr. Cole asks us to take\r\nit as meaning mines, shipyards, docks, stations, and every place which\r\nis \"a natural center of production.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p.\r\n41] But a factory in this sense is quite a different thing from an\r\nindustry. The factory, as Mr. Cole conceives it, is a work place where\r\nmen are really in personal contact, an environment small enough to be\r\nknown directly to all the workers. \"This democracy if it is to be\r\nreal, must come home to, and be exercisable directly by, every\r\nindividual member of the Guild.\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 40.]\r\nThis is important, because Mr. Cole, like Jefferson, is seeking a\r\nnatural unit of government. The only natural unit is a perfectly\r\nfamiliar environment. Now a large plant, a railway system, a great\r\ncoal field, is not a natural unit in this sense. Unless it is a very\r\nsmall factory indeed, what Mr. Cole is really thinking about is the\r\nshop. That is where men can be supposed to have \"the habit and\r\ntradition of working together.\" The rest of the plant, the rest of the\r\nindustry, is an inferred environment.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nAnybody can see, and almost everybody will admit, that self-government\r\nin the purely internal affairs of the shop is government of affairs\r\nthat \"can be taken in at a single view.\" [Footnote: Aristotle,\r\n_Politics_, Bk. VII, Ch. IV.] But dispute would arise as to what\r\nconstitute the internal affairs of a shop. Obviously the biggest\r\ninterests, like wages, standards of production, the purchase of\r\nsupplies, the marketing of the product, the larger planning of work,\r\nare by no means purely internal. The shop democracy has freedom,\r\nsubject to enormous limiting conditions from the outside. It can deal\r\nto a certain extent with the arrangement of work laid out for the\r\nshop, it can deal with the temper and temperament of individuals, it\r\ncan administer petty industrial justice, and act as a court of first\r\ninstance in somewhat larger individual disputes. Above all it can act\r\nas a unit in dealing with other shops, and perhaps with the plant as a\r\nwhole. But isolation is impossible. The unit of industrial democracy\r\nis thoroughly entangled in foreign affairs. And it is the management\r\nof these external relations that constitutes the test of the guild\r\nsocialist theory.\r\n\r\nThey have to be managed by representative government arranged in a\r\nfederal order from the shop to the plant, the plant to the industry,\r\nthe industry to the nation, with intervening regional grouping of\r\nrepresentatives. But all this structure derives from the shop, and all\r\nits peculiar virtues are ascribed to this source. The representatives\r\nwho choose the representatives who choose the representatives who\r\nfinally \"coordinate\" and \"regulate\" the shops are elected, Mr. Cole\r\nasserts, by a true democracy. Because they come originally from a\r\nself-governing unit, the whole federal organism will be inspired by\r\nthe spirit and the reality of self-government. Representatives will\r\naim to carry out the workers' \"actual will as understood by themselves,\"\r\n[Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 42.] that is, as understood by the\r\nindividual in the shops.\r\n\r\nA government run literally on this principle would, if history is any\r\nguide, be either a perpetual logroll, or a chaos of warring shops. For\r\nwhile the worker in the shop can have a real opinion about matters\r\nentirely within the shop, his \"will\" about the relation of that shop\r\nto the plant, the industry, and the nation is subject to all the\r\nlimitations of access, stereotype, and self-interest that surround any\r\nother self-centered opinion. His experience in the shop at best brings\r\nonly aspects of the whole to his attention. His opinion of what is\r\nright within the shop he can reach by direct knowledge of the\r\nessential facts. His opinion of what is right in the great complicated\r\nenvironment out of sight is more likely to be wrong than right if it\r\nis a generalization from the experience of the individual shop. As a\r\nmatter of experience, the representatives of a guild society would\r\nfind, just as the higher trade union officials find today, that on a\r\ngreat number of questions which they have to decide there is no\r\n\"actual will as understood\" by the shops.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe guildsmen insist, however, that such criticism is blind because it\r\nignores a great political discovery. You may be quite right, they\r\nwould say, in thinking that the representatives of the shops would\r\nhave to make up their own minds on many questions about which the\r\nshops have no opinion. But you are simply entangled in an ancient\r\nfallacy: you are looking for somebody to represent a group of people.\r\nHe cannot be found. The only representative possible is one who acts\r\nfor \"some particular function,\" [Footnote: _Op. cit._, pp. 23-24.]\r\nand therefore each person must help choose as many representatives \"as\r\nthere are distinct essential groups of functions to be performed.\"\r\n\r\nAssume then that the representatives speak, not for the men in the\r\nshops, but for certain functions in which the men are interested. They\r\nare, mind you, disloyal if they do not carry out the will of the group\r\nabout the function, as understood by the group. [Footnote: _Cf._\r\nPart V, \"The Making of a Common Will.\"] These functional\r\nrepresentatives meet. Their business is to coordinate and regulate. By\r\nwhat standard does each judge the proposals of the other, assuming, as\r\nwe must, that there is conflict of opinion between the shops, since if\r\nthere were not, there would be no need to coordinate and regulate?\r\n\r\nNow the peculiar virtue of functional democracy is supposed to be that\r\nmen vote candidly according to their own interests, which it is\r\nassumed they know by daily experience. They can do that within the\r\nself-contained group. But in its external relations the group as a\r\nwhole, or its representative, is dealing with matters that transcend\r\nimmediate experience. The shop does not arrive spontaneously at a view\r\nof the whole situation. Therefore, the public opinions of a shop about\r\nits rights and duties in the industry and in society, are matters of\r\neducation or propaganda, not the automatic product of shop-consciousness.\r\nWhether the guildsmen elect a delegate, or a representative, they do\r\nnot escape the problem of the orthodox democrat. Either the group\r\nas a whole, or the elected spokesman, must stretch his mind beyond\r\nthe limits of direct experience. He must vote on questions coming up\r\nfrom other shops, and on matters coming from beyond the frontiers of\r\nthe whole industry. The primary interest of the shop does not even\r\ncover the function of a whole industrial vocation. The function of a\r\nvocation, a great industry, a district, a nation is a concept, not an\r\nexperience, and has to be imagined, invented, taught and believed.\r\nAnd even though you define function as carefully as possible, once\r\nyou admit that the view of each shop on that function will not\r\nnecessarily coincide with the view of other shops, you are saying\r\nthat the representative of one interest is concerned in the proposals\r\nmade by other interests. You are saying that he must conceive a\r\ncommon interest. And in voting for him you are choosing a man who\r\nwill not simply represent your view of your function, which is all that\r\nyou know at first hand, but a man who will represent your views\r\nabout other people's views of that function. You are voting as\r\nindefinitely as the orthodox democrat.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe guildsmen in their own minds have solved the question of how to\r\nconceive a common interest by playing with the word function. They\r\nimagine a society in which all the main work of the world has been\r\nanalysed into functions, and these functions in turn synthesized\r\nharmoniously. [Footnote: _Cf. op. cit._, Ch. XIX.] They suppose\r\nessential agreement about the purposes of society as a whole, and\r\nessential agreement about the role of every organized group in\r\ncarrying out those purposes. It was a nice sentiment, therefore, which\r\nled them to take the name of their theory from an institution that\r\narose in a Catholic feudal society. But they should remember that the\r\nscheme of function which the wise men of that age assumed was not\r\nworked out by mortal man. It is unclear how the guildsmen think the\r\nscheme is going to be worked out and made acceptable in the modern\r\nworld. Sometimes they seem to argue that the scheme will develop from\r\ntrade union organization, at other times that the communes will define\r\nthe constitutional function of the groups. But it makes a considerable\r\npractical difference whether they believe that the groups define their\r\nown functions or not.\r\n\r\nIn either case, Mr. Cole assumes that society can be carried on by a\r\nsocial contract based on an accepted idea of \"distinct essential\r\ngroups of functions.\" How does one recognize these distinct essential\r\ngroups? So far as I can make out, Mr. Cole thinks that a function is\r\nwhat a group of people are interested in. \"The essence of functional\r\ndemocracy is that a man should count as many times over as there are\r\nfunctions in which he is interested.\" [Footnote: _Social Theory,_\r\np. 102 _et seq._] Now there are at least two meanings to the word\r\ninterested. You can use it to mean that a man is involved, or that his\r\nmind is occupied. John Smith, for example, may have been tremendously\r\ninterested in the Stillman divorce case. He may have read every word\r\nof the news in every lobster edition. On the other hand, young Guy\r\nStillman, whose legitimacy was at stake, probably did not trouble\r\nhimself at all. John Smith was interested in a suit that did not\r\naffect his \"interests,\" and Guy was uninterested in one that would\r\ndetermine the whole course of his life. Mr. Cole, I am afraid, leans\r\ntowards John Smith. He is answering the \"very foolish objection\" that\r\nto vote by functions is to be voting very often: \"If a man is not\r\ninterested enough to vote, and cannot be aroused to interest enough to\r\nmake him vote, on, say, a dozen distinct subjects, he waives his right\r\nto vote and the result is no less democratic than if he voted blindly\r\nand without interest.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cole thinks that the uninstructed voter \"waives his right to\r\nvote.\" From this it follows that the votes of the instructed reveal\r\ntheir interest, and their interest defines the function. [Footnote:\r\n_Cf._ Ch. XVIII of this book. \"Since everybody was assumed to be\r\ninterested enough in important affairs, only those affairs came to\r\nseem important in which everybody was interested.\"] \"Brown, Jones, and\r\nRobinson must therefore have, not one vote each, but as many different\r\nfunctional votes as there are different questions calling for\r\nassociative action in which they are interested.\" [Footnote: _Guild\r\nSocialism,_ p. 24. ] I am considerably in doubt whether Mr. Cole\r\nthinks that Brown, Jones and Robinson should qualify in any election\r\nwhere they assert that they are interested, or that somebody else, not\r\nnamed, picks the functions in which they are entitled to be\r\ninterested. If I were asked to say what I believe Mr. Cole thinks, it\r\nwould be that he has smoothed over the difficulty by the enormously\r\nstrange assumption that it is the uninstructed voter who waives his\r\nright to vote; and has concluded that whether functional voting is\r\narranged by a higher power, or \"from below\" on the principle that a\r\nman may vote when it interests him to vote, only the instructed will\r\nbe voting anyway, and therefore the institution will work.\r\n\r\nBut there are two kinds of uninstructed voter. There is the man who\r\ndoes not know and knows that he does not know. He is generally an\r\nenlightened person. He is the man who waives his right to vote. But\r\nthere is also the man who is uninstructed and does not know that he\r\nis, or care. He can always be gotten to the polls, if the party\r\nmachinery is working. His vote is the basis of the machine. And since\r\nthe communes of the guild society have large powers over taxation,\r\nwages, prices, credit, and natural resources, it would be preposterous\r\nto assume that elections will not be fought at least as passionately\r\nas our own.\r\n\r\nThe way people exhibit their interest will not then delimit the\r\nfunctions of a functional society. There are two other ways that\r\nfunction might be defined. One would be by the trade unions which\r\nfought the battle that brought guild socialism into being. Such a\r\nstruggle would harden groups of men together in some sort of\r\nfunctional relation, and these groups would then become the vested\r\ninterests of the guild socialist society. Some of them, like the\r\nminers and railroad men, would be very strong, and probably deeply\r\nattached to the view of their function which they learned from the\r\nbattle with capitalism. It is not at all unlikely that certain\r\nfavorably placed trade unions would under a socialist state become the\r\ncenter of coherence and government. But a guild society would\r\ninevitably find them a tough problem to deal with, for direct action\r\nwould have revealed their strategic power, and some of their leaders\r\nat least would not offer up this power readily on the altar of\r\nfreedom. In order to \"coordinate\" them, guild society would have to\r\ngather together its strength, and fairly soon one would find, I think,\r\nthat the radicals under guild socialism would be asking for communes\r\nstrong enough to define the functions of the guilds.\r\n\r\nBut if you are going to have the government (commune) define\r\nfunctions, the premise of the theory disappears. It had to suppose\r\nthat a scheme of functions was obvious in order that the concave shops\r\nwould voluntarily relate themselves to society. If there is no settled\r\nscheme of functions in every voter's head, he has no better way under\r\nguild socialism than under orthodox democracy of turning a\r\nself-centered opinion into a social judgment. And, of course, there\r\ncan be no such settled scheme, because, even if Mr. Cole and his\r\nfriends devised a good one, the shop democracies from which all power\r\nderives, would judge the scheme in operation by what they learn of it\r\nand by what they can imagine. The guilds would see the same scheme\r\ndifferently. And so instead of the scheme being the skeleton that\r\nkeeps guild society together, the attempt to define what the scheme\r\nought to be, would be under guild socialism as elsewhere, the main\r\nbusiness of politics. If we could allow Mr. Cole his scheme of\r\nfunctions we could allow him almost everything. Unfortunately he has\r\ninserted in his premise what he wishes a guild society to\r\ndeduce. [Footnote: I have dealt with Mr. Cole's theory rather than with\r\nthe experience of Soviet Russia because, while the testimony is\r\nfragmentary, all competent observers seem to agree that Russia in 1921\r\ndoes not illustrate a communist state in working order. Russia is in\r\nrevolution, and what you can learn from Russia is what a revolution is\r\nlike. You can learn very little about what a communist society would\r\nbe like. It is, however, immensely significant that, first as\r\npractical revolutionists and then as public officials, the Russian\r\ncommunists have relied not upon the spontaneous democracy of the\r\nRussian people, but on the discipline, special interest and the\r\nnoblesse oblige of a specialized class-the loyal and indoctrinated\r\nmembers of the Communist party. In the \"transition,\" on which no time\r\nlimit has been set, I believe, the cure for class government and the\r\ncoercive state is strictly homeopathic.\r\n\r\nThere is also the question of why I selected Mr. Cole's books rather\r\nthan the much more closely reasoned \"Constitution for the Socialist\r\nCommonwealth of Great Britain\" by Sidney and Beatrice Webb. I admire\r\nthat book very much; but I have not been able to convince myself that\r\nit is not an intellectual tour de force. Mr. Cole seems to me far more\r\nauthentically in the spirit of the socialist movement, and therefore,\r\na better witness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA NEW IMAGE\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE lesson is, I think, a fairly clear one. In the absence of\r\ninstitutions and education by which the environment is so successfully\r\nreported that the realities of public life stand out sharply against\r\nself-centered opinion, the common interests very largely elude public\r\nopinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose\r\npersonal interests reach beyond the locality. This class is\r\nirresponsible, for it acts upon information that is not common\r\nproperty, in situations that the public at large does not conceive,\r\nand it can be held to account only on the accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nThe democratic theory by failing to admit that self-centered opinions\r\nare not sufficient to procure good government, is involved in\r\nperpetual conflict between theory and practice. According to the\r\ntheory, the full dignity of man requires that his will should be, as\r\nMr. Cole says, expressed \"in any and every form of social action.\" It\r\nis supposed that the expression of their will is the consuming passion\r\nof men, for they are assumed to possess by instinct the art of\r\ngovernment. But as a matter of plain experience, self-determination is\r\nonly one of the many interests of a human personality. The desire to\r\nbe the master of one's own destiny is a strong desire, but it has to\r\nadjust itself to other equally strong desires, such as the desire for\r\na good life, for peace, for relief from burdens. In the original\r\nassumptions of democracy it was held that the expression of each man's\r\nwill would spontaneously satisfy not only his desire for\r\nself-expression, but his desire for a good life, because the instinct\r\nto express one's self in a good life was innate.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis, therefore, has always been on the mechanism for\r\nexpressing the will. The democratic El Dorado has always been some\r\nperfect environment, and some perfect system of voting and\r\nrepresentation, where the innate good will and instinctive\r\nstatesmanship of every man could be translated into action. In limited\r\nareas and for brief periods the environment has been so favorable,\r\nthat is to say so isolated, and so rich in opportunity, that the\r\ntheory worked well enough to confirm men in thinking that it was sound\r\nfor all time and everywhere. Then when the isolation ended, and\r\nsociety became complex, and men had to adjust themselves closely to\r\none another, the democrat spent his time trying to devise more perfect\r\nunits of voting, in the hope that somehow he would, as Mr. Cole says,\r\n\"get the mechanism right, and adjust it as far as possible to men's\r\nsocial wills.\" But while the democratic theorist was busy at this, he\r\nwas far away from the actual interests of human nature. He was\r\nabsorbed by one interest: self-government. Mankind was interested in\r\nall kinds of other things, in order, in its rights, in prosperity, in\r\nsights and sounds and in not being bored. In so far as spontaneous\r\ndemocracy does not satisfy their other interests, it seems to most men\r\nmost of the time to be an empty thing. Because the art of successful\r\nself-government is not instinctive, men do not long desire\r\nself-government for its own sake. They desire it for the sake of the\r\nresults. That is why the impulse to self-government is always\r\nstrongest as a protest against bad conditions.\r\n\r\nThe democratic fallacy has been its preoccupation with the origin of\r\ngovernment rather than with the processes and results. The democrat\r\nhas always assumed that if political power could be derived in the\r\nright way, it would be beneficent. His whole attention has been on the\r\nsource of power, since he is hypnotized by the belief that the great\r\nthing is to express the will of the people, first because expression\r\nis the highest interest of man, and second because the will is\r\ninstinctively good. But no amount of regulation at the source of a\r\nriver will completely control its behavior, and while democrats have\r\nbeen absorbed in trying to find a good mechanism for originating\r\nsocial power, that is to say a good mechanism of voting and\r\nrepresentation, they neglected almost every other interest of men. For\r\nno matter how power originates, the crucial interest is in how power\r\nis exercised. What determines the quality of civilization is the use\r\nmade of power. And that use cannot be controlled at the source.\r\n\r\nIf you try to control government wholly at the source, you inevitably\r\nmake all the vital decisions invisible. For since there is no instinct\r\nwhich automatically makes political decisions that produce a good\r\nlife, the men who actually exercise power not only fail to express the\r\nwill of the people, because on most questions no will exists, but they\r\nexercise power according to opinions which are hidden from the\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\nIf, then, you root out of the democratic philosophy the whole\r\nassumption in all its ramifications that government is instinctive,\r\nand that therefore it can be managed by self-centered opinions, what\r\nbecomes of the democratic faith in the dignity of man? It takes a\r\nfresh lease of life by associating itself with the whole personality\r\ninstead of with a meager aspect of it. For the traditional democrat\r\nrisked the dignity of man on one very precarious assumption, that he\r\nwould exhibit that dignity instinctively in wise laws and good\r\ngovernment. Voters did not do that, and so the democrat was forever\r\nbeing made to look a little silly by tough-minded men. But if, instead\r\nof hanging human dignity on the one assumption about self-government,\r\nyou insist that man's dignity requires a standard of living, in which\r\nhis capacities are properly exercised, the whole problem changes. The\r\ncriteria which you then apply to government are whether it is\r\nproducing a certain minimum of health, of decent housing, of material\r\nnecessities, of education, of freedom, of pleasures, of beauty, not\r\nsimply whether at the sacrifice of all these things, it vibrates to\r\nthe self-centered opinions that happen to be floating around in men's\r\nminds. In the degree to which these criteria can be made exact and\r\nobjective, political decision, which is inevitably the concern of\r\ncomparatively few people, is actually brought into relation with the\r\ninterests of men.\r\n\r\nThere is no prospect, in any time which we can conceive, that the\r\nwhole invisible environment will be so clear to all men that they will\r\nspontaneously arrive at sound public opinions on the whole business of\r\ngovernment. And even if there were a prospect, it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether many of us would wish to be bothered, or would take\r\nthe time to form an opinion on \"any and every form of social action\"\r\nwhich affects us. The only prospect which is not visionary is that\r\neach of us in his own sphere will act more and more on a realistic\r\npicture of the invisible world, and that we shall develop more and\r\nmore men who are expert in keeping these pictures realistic. Outside\r\nthe rather narrow range of our own possible attention, social control\r\ndepends upon devising standards of living and methods of audit by\r\nwhich the acts of public officials and industrial directors are\r\nmeasured. We cannot ourselves inspire or guide all these acts, as the\r\nmystical democrat has always imagined. But we can steadily increase\r\nour real control over these acts by insisting that all of them shall\r\nbe plainly recorded, and their results objectively measured. I should\r\nsay, perhaps, that we can progressively hope to insist. For the\r\nworking out of such standards and of such audits has only begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER   XXI. THE BUYING PUBLIC\r\n   \"     XXII. THE CONSTANT READER\r\n   \"    XXIII. THE NATURE OF NEWS\r\n   \"     XXIV. NEWS, TRUTH, AND A CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE BUYING PUBLIC\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE idea that men have to go forth and study the world in order to\r\ngovern it, has played a very minor part in political thought. It could\r\nfigure very little, because the machinery for reporting the world in\r\nany way useful to government made comparatively little progress from\r\nthe time of Aristotle to the age in which the premises of democracy\r\nwere established.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you had asked a pioneer democrat where the information\r\nwas to come from on which the will of the people was to be based, he\r\nwould have been puzzled by the question. It would have seemed a little\r\nas if you had asked him where his life or his soul came from. The will\r\nof the people, he almost always assumed, exists at all times; the duty\r\nof political science was to work out the inventions of the ballot and\r\nrepresentative government. If they were properly worked out and\r\napplied under the right conditions, such as exist in the\r\nself-contained village or the self-contained shop, the mechanism would\r\nsomehow overcome the brevity of attention which Aristotle had\r\nobserved, and the narrowness of its range, which the theory of a\r\nself-contained community tacitly acknowledged. We have seen how even\r\nat this late date the guild socialists are transfixed by the notion\r\nthat if only you can build on the right unit of voting and\r\nrepresentation, an intricate cooperative commonwealth is possible.\r\n\r\nConvinced that the wisdom was there if only you could find it,\r\ndemocrats have treated the problem of making public opinions as a\r\nproblem in civil liberties. [Footnote: The best study is Prof.\r\nZechariah Chafee's, _Freedom of Speech_.] \"Who ever knew Truth\r\nput to the worse, in a free and open encounter?\" [Footnote: Milton,\r\n_Areopagitica_, cited at the opening of Mr. Chafee's book. For\r\ncomment on this classic doctrine of liberty as stated by Milton, John\r\nStuart Mill, and Mr. Bertrand Russel, see my _Liberty and the\r\nNews_, Ch. II.] Supposing that no one has ever seen it put to the\r\nworse, are we to believe then that the truth is generated by the\r\nencounter, like fire by rubbing two sticks? Behind this classic\r\ndoctrine of liberty, which American democrats embodied in their Bill\r\nof Rights, there are, in fact, several different theories of the\r\norigin of truth. One is a faith that in the competition of opinions,\r\nthe truest will win because there is a peculiar strength in the truth.\r\nThis is probably sound if you allow the competition to extend over a\r\nsufficiently long time. When men argue in this vein they have in mind\r\nthe verdict of history, and they think specifically of heretics\r\npersecuted when they lived, canonized after they were dead. Milton's\r\nquestion rests also on a belief that the capacity to recognize truth\r\nis inherent in all men, and that truth freely put in circulation will\r\nwin acceptance. It derives no less from the experience, which has\r\nshown that men are not likely to discover truth if they cannot speak\r\nit, except under the eye of an uncomprehending policeman.\r\n\r\nNo one can possibly overestimate the practical value of these civil\r\nliberties, nor the importance of maintaining them. When they are in\r\njeopardy, the human spirit is in jeopardy, and should there come a\r\ntime when they have to be curtailed, as during a war, the suppression\r\nof thought is a risk to civilization which might prevent its recovery\r\nfrom the effects of war, if the hysterics, who exploit the necessity,\r\nwere numerous enough to carry over into peace the taboos of war.\r\nFortunately, the mass of men is too tolerant long to enjoy the\r\nprofessional inquisitors, as gradually, under the criticism of men not\r\nwilling to be terrorized, they are revealed as mean-spirited creatures\r\nwho nine-tenths of the time do not know what they are talking\r\nabout. [Footnote: _Cf._ for example, the publications of the Lusk\r\nCommittee in New York, and the public statements and prophecies of Mr.\r\nMitchell Palmer, who was Attorney-General of the United States during\r\nthe period of President Wilson's illness.]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of its fundamental importance, civil liberty in this\r\nsense does not guarantee public opinion in the modern world. For it\r\nalways assumes, either that truth is spontaneous, or that the means of\r\nsecuring truth exist when there is no external interference. But when\r\nyou are dealing with an invisible environment, the assumption is\r\nfalse. The truth about distant or complex matters is not self-evident,\r\nand the machinery for assembling information is technical and\r\nexpensive. Yet political science, and especially democratic political\r\nscience, has never freed itself from the original assumption of\r\nAristotle's politics sufficiently to restate the premises, so that\r\npolitical thought might come to grips with the problem of how to make\r\nthe invisible world visible to the citizens of a modern state.\r\n\r\nSo deep is the tradition, that until quite recently, for example,\r\npolitical science was taught in our colleges as if newspapers did not\r\nexist. I am not referring to schools of journalism, for they are trade\r\nschools, intended to prepare men and women for a career. I am\r\nreferring to political science as expounded to future business men,\r\nlawyers, public officials, and citizens at large. In that science a\r\nstudy of the press and the sources of popular information found no\r\nplace. It is a curious fact. To anyone not immersed in the routine\r\ninterests of political science, it is almost inexplicable that no\r\nAmerican student of government, no American sociologist, has ever\r\nwritten a book on news-gathering. There are occasional references to\r\nthe press, and statements that it is not, or that it ought to be,\r\n\"free\" and \"truthful.\" But I can find almost nothing else. And this\r\ndisdain of the professionals finds its counterpart in public opinions.\r\nUniversally it is admitted that the press is the chief means of\r\ncontact with the unseen environment. And practically everywhere it is\r\nassumed that the press should do spontaneously for us what primitive\r\ndemocracy imagined each of us could do spontaneously for himself, that\r\nevery day and twice a day it will present us with a true picture of\r\nall the outer world in which we are interested.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThis insistent and ancient belief that truth is not earned, but\r\ninspired, revealed, supplied gratis, comes out very plainly in our\r\neconomic prejudices as readers of newspapers. We expect the newspaper\r\nto serve us with truth however unprofitable the truth may be. For this\r\ndifficult and often dangerous service, which we recognize as\r\nfundamental, we expected to pay until recently the smallest coin\r\nturned out by the mint. We have accustomed ourselves now to paying two\r\nand even three cents on weekdays, and on Sundays, for an illustrated\r\nencyclopedia and vaudeville entertainment attached, we have screwed\r\nourselves up to paying a nickel or even a dime. Nobody thinks for a\r\nmoment that he ought to pay for his newspaper. He expects the\r\nfountains of truth to bubble, but he enters into no contract, legal or\r\nmoral, involving any risk, cost or trouble to himself. He will pay a\r\nnominal price when it suits him, will stop paying whenever it suits\r\nhim, will turn to another paper when that suits him. Somebody has said\r\nquite aptly that the newspaper editor has to be re-elected every day.\r\n\r\nThis casual and one-sided relationship between readers and press is an\r\nanomaly of our civilization. There is nothing else quite like it, and\r\nit is, therefore, hard to compare the press with any other business or\r\ninstitution. It is not a business pure and simple, partly because the\r\nproduct is regularly sold below cost, but chiefly because the\r\ncommunity applies one ethical measure to the press and another to\r\ntrade or manufacture. Ethically a newspaper is judged as if it were a\r\nchurch or a school. But if you try to compare it with these you fail;\r\nthe taxpayer pays for the public school, the private school is endowed\r\nor supported by tuition fees, there are subsidies and collections for\r\nthe church. You cannot compare journalism with law, medicine or\r\nengineering, for in every one of these professions the consumer pays\r\nfor the service. A free press, if you judge by the attitude of the\r\nreaders, means newspapers that are virtually given away.\r\n\r\nYet the critics of the press are merely voicing the moral standards of\r\nthe community, when they expect such an institution to live on the\r\nsame plane as that on which the school, the church, and the\r\ndisinterested professions are supposed to live. This illustrates again\r\nthe concave character of democracy. No need for artificially acquired\r\ninformation is felt to exist. The information must come naturally,\r\nthat is to say gratis, if not out of the heart of the citizen, then\r\ngratis out of the newspaper. The citizen will pay for his telephone,\r\nhis railroad rides, his motor car, his entertainment. But he does not\r\npay openly for his news.\r\n\r\nHe will, however, pay handsomely for the privilege of having someone\r\nread about him. He will pay directly to advertise. And he will pay\r\nindirectly for the advertisements of other people, because that\r\npayment, being concealed in the price of commodities is part of an\r\ninvisible environment that he does not effectively comprehend. It\r\nwould be regarded as an outrage to have to pay openly the price of a\r\ngood ice cream soda for all the news of the world, though the public\r\nwill pay that and more when it buys the advertised commodities. The\r\npublic pays for the press, but only when the payment is concealed.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nCirculation is, therefore, the means to an end. It becomes an asset\r\nonly when it can be sold to the advertiser, who buys it with revenues\r\nsecured through indirect taxation of the reader. [Footnote: \"An\r\nestablished newspaper is entitled to fix its advertising rates so that\r\nits net receipts from circulation may be left on the credit side of\r\nthe profit and loss account. To arrive at net receipts, I would deduct\r\nfrom the gross the cost of promotion, distribution, and other expenses\r\nincidental to circulation.\" From an address by Mr. Adolph S. Ochs,\r\npublisher of _the New York Times,_ at the Philadelphia Convention\r\nof the Associated Advertising Clubs of The World, June 26, 1916.\r\nCited, Elmer Davis, _History of The New York Times,_ 1851-1921,\r\npp. 397-398.] The kind of circulation which the advertiser will buy\r\ndepends on what he has to sell. It may be \"quality\" or \"mass.\" On the\r\nwhole there is no sharp dividing line, for in respect to most\r\ncommodities sold by advertising, the customers are neither the small\r\nclass of the very rich nor the very poor. They are the people with\r\nenough surplus over bare necessities to exercise discretion in their\r\nbuying. The paper, therefore, which goes into the homes of the fairly\r\nprosperous is by and large the one which offers most to the\r\nadvertiser. It may also go into the homes of the poor, but except for\r\ncertain lines of goods, an analytical advertising agent does not rate\r\nthat circulation as a great asset, unless, as seems to be the case\r\nwith certain of Mr. Hearst's properties, the circulation is enormous.\r\n\r\nA newspaper which angers those whom it pays best to reach through\r\nadvertisements is a bad medium for an advertiser. And since no one\r\never claimed that advertising was philanthropy, advertisers buy space\r\nin those publications which are fairly certain to reach their future\r\ncustomers. One need not spend much time worrying about the unreported\r\nscandals of the dry-goods merchants. They represent nothing really\r\nsignificant, and incidents of this sort are less common than many\r\ncritics of the press suppose. The real problem is that the readers of\r\na newspaper, unaccustomed to paying the cost of newsgathering, can be\r\ncapitalized only by turning them into circulation that can be sold to\r\nmanufacturers and merchants. And those whom it is most important to\r\ncapitalize are those who have the most money to spend. Such a press is\r\nbound to respect the point of view of the buying public. It is for\r\nthis buying public that newspapers are edited and published, for\r\nwithout that support the newspaper cannot live. A newspaper can flout\r\nan advertiser, it can attack a powerful banking or traction interest,\r\nbut if it alienates the buying public, it loses the one indispensable\r\nasset of its existence.\r\n\r\nMr. John L. Given, [Footnote: _Making a Newspaper_, p. 13. This\r\nis the best technical book I know, and should be read by everyone who\r\nundertakes to discuss the press. Mr. G. B. Diblee, who wrote the\r\nvolume on _The Newspaper_ in the Home University Library says (p.\r\n253), that \"on the press for pressmen I only know of one good book,\r\nMr. Given's.\"] formerly of the New York Evening Sun, stated in 1914\r\nthat out of over two thousand three hundred dailies published in the\r\nUnited States, there were about one hundred and seventy-five printed\r\nin cities having over one hundred thousand inhabitants. These\r\nconstitute the press for \"general news.\" They are the key papers which\r\ncollect the news dealing with great events, and even the people who do\r\nnot read any one of the one hundred and seventy-five depend ultimately\r\nupon them for news of the outer world. For they make up the great\r\npress associations which coöperate in the exchange of news. Each is,\r\ntherefore, not only the informant of its own readers, but it is the\r\nlocal reporter for the newspapers of other cities. The rural press and\r\nthe special press by and large, take their general news from these key\r\npapers. And among these there are some very much richer than others,\r\nso that for international news, in the main, the whole press of the\r\nnation may depend upon the reports of the press associations and the\r\nspecial services of a few metropolitan dailies.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the economic support for general news gathering is\r\nin the price paid for advertised goods by the fairly prosperous\r\nsections of cities with more than one hundred thousand inhabitants.\r\nThese buying publics are composed of the members of families, who\r\ndepend for their income chiefly on trade, merchandising, the direction\r\nof manufacture, and finance. They are the clientele among whom it pays\r\nbest to advertise in a newspaper. They wield a concentrated purchasing\r\npower, which may be less in volume than the aggregate for farmers and\r\nworkingmen; but within the radius covered by a daily newspaper they\r\nare the quickest assets.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThey have, moreover, a double claim to attention. They are not only\r\nthe best customers for the advertiser, they include the advertisers.\r\nTherefore the impression made by the newspapers on this public matters\r\ndeeply. Fortunately this public is not unanimous. It may be\r\n\"capitalistic\" but it contains divergent views on what capitalism is,\r\nand how it is to be run. Except in times of danger, this respectable\r\nopinion is sufficiently divided to permit of considerable differences\r\nof policy. These would be greater still if it were not that publishers\r\nare themselves usually members of these urban communities, and\r\nhonestly see the world through the lenses of their associates and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThey are engaged in a speculative business, [Footnote: Sometimes so\r\nspeculative that in order to secure credit the publisher has to go\r\ninto bondage to his creditors. Information on this point is very\r\ndifficult to obtain, and for that reason its general importance is\r\noften much exaggerated.] which depends on the general condition of\r\ntrade, and more peculiarly on a circulation based not on a marriage\r\ncontract with their readers, but on free love. The object of every\r\npublisher is, therefore, to turn his circulation from a medley of\r\ncatch-as-catch-can news stand buyers into a devoted band of constant\r\nreaders. A newspaper that can really depend upon the loyalty of its\r\nreaders is as independent as a newspaper can be, given the economics\r\nof modern journalism. [Footnote: \"It is an axiom in newspaper\r\npublishing--'more readers, more independence of the influence of\r\nadvertisers; fewer readers and more dependence on the advertiser' It\r\nmay seem like a contradiction (yet it is the truth) to assert: the\r\ngreater the number of advertisers, the less influence they are\r\nindividually able to exercise with the publisher.\" Adolph S. Ochs,\r\n_of. supra._] A body of readers who stay by it through thick and\r\nthin is a power greater than any which the individual advertiser can\r\nwield, and a power great enough to break up a combination of\r\nadvertisers. Therefore, whenever you find a newspaper betraying its\r\nreaders for the sake of an advertiser, you can be fairly certain\r\neither that the publisher sincerely shares the views of the\r\nadvertiser, or that he thinks, perhaps mistakenly, he cannot count\r\nupon the support of his readers if he openly resists dictation. It is\r\na question of whether the readers, who do not pay in cash for their\r\nnews, will pay for it in loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTANT READER\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE loyalty of the buying public to a newspaper is not stipulated in\r\nany bond. In almost every other enterprise the person who expects to\r\nbe served enters into an agreement that controls his passing whims. At\r\nleast he pays for what he obtains. In the publishing of periodicals\r\nthe nearest approach to an agreement for a definite time is the paid\r\nsubscription, and that is not, I believe, a great factor in the\r\neconomy of a metropolitan daily. The reader is the sole and the daily\r\njudge of his loyalty, and there can be no suit against him for breach\r\nof promise or nonsupport.\r\n\r\nThough everything turns on the constancy of the reader, there does not\r\nexist even a vague tradition to call that fact to the reader's mind.\r\nHis constancy depends on how he happens to feel, or on his habits. And\r\nthese depend not simply on the quality of the news, but more often on\r\na number of obscure elements that in our casual relation to the press,\r\nwe hardly take the trouble to make conscious. The most important of\r\nthese is that each of us tends to judge a newspaper, if we judge it at\r\nall, by its treatment of that part of the news in which we feel\r\nourselves involved. The newspaper deals with a multitude of events\r\nbeyond our experience. But it deals also with some events within our\r\nexperience. And by its handling of those events we most frequently\r\ndecide to like it or dislike it, to trust it or refuse to have the\r\nsheet in the house. If the newspaper gives a satisfactory account of\r\nthat which we think we know, our business, our church, our party, it\r\nis fairly certain to be immune from violent criticism by us. What\r\nbetter criterion does the man at the breakfast table possess than that\r\nthe newspaper version checks up with his own opinion? Therefore, most\r\nmen tend to hold the newspaper most strictly accountable in their\r\ncapacity, not of general readers, but of special pleaders on matters\r\nof their own experience.\r\n\r\nRarely is anyone but the interested party able to test the accuracy of\r\na report. If the news is local, and if there is competition, the\r\neditor knows that he will probably hear from the man who thinks his\r\nportrait unfair and inaccurate. But if the news is not local, the\r\ncorrective diminishes as the subject matter recedes into the distance.\r\nThe only people who can correct what they think is a false picture of\r\nthemselves printed in another city are members of groups well enough\r\norganized to hire publicity men.\r\n\r\nNow it is interesting to note that the general reader of a newspaper\r\nhas no standing in law if he thinks he is being misled by the news. It\r\nis only the aggrieved party who can sue for slander or libel, and he\r\nhas to prove a material injury to himself. The law embodies the\r\ntradition that general news is not a matter of common concern,\r\n[Footnote: The reader will not mistake this as a plea for censorship.\r\nIt might, however, be a good thing if there were competent tribunals,\r\npreferably not official ones, where charges of untruthfulness and\r\nunfairness in the general news could be sifted. _Cf. Liberty and the\r\nNews,_ pp. 73-76. ] except as to matter which is vaguely described\r\nas immoral or seditious.\r\n\r\nBut the body of the news, though unchecked as a whole by the\r\ndisinterested reader, consists of items about which some readers have\r\nvery definite preconceptions. Those items are the data of his\r\njudgment, and news which men read without this personal criterion,\r\nthey judge by some other standard than their standard of accuracy.\r\nThey are dealing here with a subject matter which to them is\r\nindistinguishable from fiction. The canon of truth cannot be applied.\r\nThey do not boggle over such news if it conforms to their stereotypes,\r\nand they continue to read it if it interests them. [Footnote: Note, for\r\nexample, how absent is indignation in Mr. Upton Sinclair against\r\nsocialist papers, even those which are as malignantly unfair to\r\nemployers as certain of the papers cited by him are unfair to\r\nradicals.]\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThere are newspapers, even in large cities, edited on the principle\r\nthat the readers wish to read about themselves. The theory is that if\r\nenough people see their own names in the paper often enough, can read\r\nabout their weddings, funerals, sociables, foreign travels, lodge\r\nmeetings, school prizes, their fiftieth birthdays, their sixtieth\r\nbirthdays, their silver weddings, their outings and clambakes, they\r\nwill make a reliable circulation.\r\n\r\nThe classic formula for such a newspaper is contained in a letter\r\nwritten by Horace Greeley on April 3, 1860, to \"Friend Fletcher\" who\r\nwas about to start a country newspaper: [Footnote: Cited, James Melvin\r\nLee, _The History of American Journalism,_ p. 405.]\r\n\r\n\"I. Begin with a clear conception that the subject of deepest interest\r\nto an average human being is himself; next to that he is most\r\nconcerned about his neighbors. Asia and the Tongo Islands stand a long\r\nway after these in his regard.... Do not let a new church be\r\norganized, or new members be added to one already existing, a farm be\r\nsold, a new house raised, a mill set in motion, a store opened, nor\r\nanything of interest to a dozen families occur, without having the\r\nfact duly, though briefly, chronicled in your columns. If a farmer\r\ncuts a big tree, or grows a mammoth beet, or harvests a bounteous\r\nyield of wheat or corn, set forth the fact as concisely and\r\nunexceptionally as possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe function of becoming, as Mr. Lee puts it, \"the printed diary of\r\nthe home town\" is one that every newspaper no matter where it is\r\npublished must in some measure fill. And where, as in a great city\r\nlike New York, the general newspapers circulated broadcast cannot fill\r\nit, there exist small newspapers published on Greeley's pattern for\r\nsections of the city. In the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx there\r\nare perhaps twice as many local dailies as there are general\r\nnewspapers. [Footnote: _Cf._ John L. Given, _Making a Newspaper,_\r\np. 13.] And they are supplemented by all kinds of special publications for\r\ntrades, religions, nationalities.\r\n\r\nThese diaries are published for people who find their own lives\r\ninteresting. But there are also great numbers of people who find their\r\nown lives dull, and wish, like Hedda Gabler, to live a more thrilling\r\nlife. For them there are published a few whole newspapers, and\r\nsections of others, devoted to the personal lives of a set of\r\nimaginary people, with whose gorgeous vices the reader can in his\r\nfancy safely identify himself. Mr. Hearst's unflagging interest in\r\nhigh society caters to people who never hope to be in high society,\r\nand yet manage to derive some enhancement out of the vague feeling\r\nthat they are part of the life that they read about. In the great\r\ncities \"the printed diary of the home town\" tends to be the printed\r\ndiary of a smart set.\r\n\r\nAnd it is, as we have already noted, the dailies of the cities which\r\ncarry the burden of bringing distant news to the private citizen. But\r\nit is not primarily their political and social news which holds the\r\ncirculation. The interest in that is intermittent, and few publishers\r\ncan bank on it alone. The newspaper, therefore, takes to itself a\r\nvariety of other features, all primarily designed to hold a body of\r\nreaders together, who so far as big news is concerned, are not able to\r\nbe critical. Moreover, in big news the competition in any one\r\ncommunity is not very serious. The press services standardize the main\r\nevents; it is only once in a while that a great scoop is made; there\r\nis apparently not a very great reading public for such massive\r\nreporting as has made the New York Times of recent years indispensable\r\nto men of all shades of opinion. In order to differentiate themselves\r\nand collect a steady public most papers have to go outside the field\r\nof general news. They go to the dazzling levels of society, to scandal\r\nand crime, to sports, pictures, actresses, advice to the lovelorn,\r\nhighschool notes, women's pages, buyer's pages, cooking receipts,\r\nchess, whist, gardening, comic strips, thundering partisanship, not\r\nbecause publishers and editors are interested in everything but news,\r\nbut because they have to find some way of holding on to that alleged\r\nhost of passionately interested readers, who are supposed by some\r\ncritics of the press to be clamoring for the truth and nothing but the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper editor occupies a strange position. His enterprises\r\ndepend upon indirect taxation levied by his advertisers upon his\r\nreaders; the patronage of the advertisers depends upon the editor's\r\nskill in holding together an effective group of customers. These\r\ncustomers deliver judgment according to their private experiences and\r\ntheir stereotyped expectations, for in the nature of things they have\r\nno independent knowledge of most news they read. If the judgment is\r\nnot unfavorable, the editor is at least within range of a circulation\r\nthat pays. But in order to secure that circulation, he cannot rely\r\nwholly upon news of the greater environment. He handles that as\r\ninterestingly as he can, of course, but the quality of the general\r\nnews, especially about public affairs, is not in itself sufficient to\r\ncause very large numbers of readers to discriminate among the dailies.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat left-handed relationship between newspapers and public\r\ninformation is reflected in the salaries of newspaper men. Reporting,\r\nwhich theoretically constitutes the foundation of the whole\r\ninstitution, is the most poorly paid branch of newspaper work, and is\r\nthe least regarded. By and large, able men go into it only by\r\nnecessity or for experience, and with the definite intention of being\r\ngraduated as soon as possible. For straight reporting is not a career\r\nthat offers many great rewards. The rewards in journalism go to\r\nspecialty work, to signed correspondence which has editorial quality,\r\nto executives, and to men with a knack and flavor of their own. This\r\nis due, no doubt, to what economists call the rent of ability. But\r\nthis economic principle operates with such peculiar violence in\r\njournalism that newsgathering does not attract to itself anything like\r\nthe number of trained and able men which its public importance would\r\nseem to demand. The fact that the able men take up \"straight\r\nreporting\" with the intention of leaving it as soon as possible is, I\r\nthink, the chief reason why it has never developed in sufficient\r\nmeasure those corporate traditions that give to a profession prestige\r\nand a jealous self-respect. For it is these corporate traditions which\r\nengender the pride of craft, which tend to raise the standards of\r\nadmission, punish breaches of the code, and give men the strength to\r\ninsist upon their status in society.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nYet all this does not go to the root of the matter. For while the\r\neconomics of journalism is such as to depress the value of news\r\nreporting, it is, I am certain, a false determinism which would\r\nabandon the analysis at that point. The intrinsic power of the\r\nreporter appears to be so great, the number of very able men who pass\r\nthrough reporting is so large, that there must be some deeper reason\r\nwhy, comparatively speaking, so little serious effort has gone into\r\nraising the vocation to the level say of medicine, engineering, or\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nMr. Upton Sinclair speaks for a large body of opinion in\r\nAmerica, [Footnote: Mr. Hilaire Belloc makes practically the same\r\nanalysis for English newspapers. _Cf. The Free Press._] when he\r\nclaims that in what he calls \"The Brass Check\" he has found this\r\ndeeper reason:\r\n\r\n\"The Brass Check is found in your pay envelope every week--you who\r\nwrite and print and distribute our newspapers and magazines. The Brass\r\ncheck is the price of your shame--you who take the fair body of truth\r\nand sell it in the market place, who betray the virgin hopes of\r\nmankind into the loathsome brothel of Big Business.\" [Footnote: Upton\r\nSinclair, _The Brass Check. A Study of American Journalism._ p.\r\n116.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem from this that there exists a body of known truth, and a\r\nset of well founded hopes, which are prostituted by a more or less\r\nconscious conspiracy of the rich owners of newspapers. If this theory\r\nis correct, then a certain conclusion follows. It is that the fair\r\nbody of truth would be inviolate in a press not in any way connected\r\nwith Big Business. For if it should happen that a press not controlled\r\nby, and not even friendly with, Big Business somehow failed to contain\r\nthe fair body of truth, something would be wrong with Mr. Sinclair's\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThere is such a press. Strange to say, in proposing a remedy Mr.\r\nSinclair does not advise his readers to subscribe to the nearest\r\nradical newspaper. Why not? If the troubles of American journalism go\r\nback to the Brass Check of Big Business why does not the remedy lie in\r\nreading the papers that do not in any remote way accept the Brass\r\nCheck? Why subsidize a \"National News\" with a large board of directors\r\n\"of all creeds or causes\" to print a paper full of facts \"regardless\r\nof what is injured, the Steel Trust or the I. W. W., the Standard Oil\r\nCompany or the Socialist Party?\" If the trouble is Big Business, that\r\nis, the Steel Trust, Standard Oil and the like, why not urge everybody\r\nto read I. W. W. or Socialist papers? Mr. Sinclair does not say why\r\nnot. But the reason is simple. He cannot convince anybody, not even\r\nhimself, that the anti-capitalist press is the remedy for the\r\ncapitalist press. He ignores the anti-capitalist press both in his\r\ntheory of the Brass Check and in his constructive proposal. But if you\r\nare diagnosing American journalism you cannot ignore it. If what you\r\ncare about is \"the fair body of truth,\" you do not commit the gross\r\nlogical error of assembling all the instances of unfairness and lying\r\nyou can find in one set of newspapers, ignore all the instances you\r\ncould easily find in another set, and then assign as the cause of the\r\nlying, the one supposedly common characteristic of the press to which\r\nyou have confined your investigation. If you are going to blame\r\n\"capitalism\" for the faults of the press, you are compelled to prove\r\nthat those faults do not exist except where capitalism controls. That\r\nMr. Sinclair cannot do this, is shown by the fact that while in his\r\ndiagnosis he traces everything to capitalism, in his prescription he\r\nignores both capitalism and anti-capitalism.\r\n\r\nOne would have supposed that the inability to take any non-capitalist\r\npaper as a model of truthfulness and competence would have caused Mr.\r\nSinclair, and those who agree with him, to look somewhat more\r\ncritically at their assumptions. They would have asked themselves, for\r\nexample, where is the fair body of truth, that Big Business\r\nprostitutes, but anti-Big Business does not seem to obtain? For that\r\nquestion leads, I believe, to the heart of the matter, to the question\r\nof what is news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF NEWS\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nALL the reporters in the world working all the hours of the day could\r\nnot witness all the happenings in the world. There are not a great\r\nmany reporters. And none of them has the power to be in more than one\r\nplace at a time. Reporters are not clairvoyant, they do not gaze into\r\na crystal ball and see the world at will, they are not assisted by\r\nthought-transference. Yet the range of subjects these comparatively\r\nfew men manage to cover would be a miracle indeed, if it were not a\r\nstandardized routine.\r\n\r\nNewspapers do not try to keep an eye on all mankind. [Footnote: See the\r\nilluminating chapter in Mr. John L. Given's book, already cited, on\r\n\"Uncovering the News,\" Ch. V.] They have watchers stationed at certain\r\nplaces, like Police Headquarters, the Coroner's Office, the County\r\nClerk's Office, City Hall, the White House, the Senate, House of\r\nRepresentatives, and so forth. They watch, or rather in the majority\r\nof cases they belong to associations which employ men who watch \"a\r\ncomparatively small number of places where it is made known when the\r\nlife of anyone... departs from ordinary paths, or when events worth\r\ntelling about occur. For example, John Smith, let it be supposed,\r\nbecomes a broker. For ten years he pursues the even tenor of his way\r\nand except for his customers and his friends no one gives him a\r\nthought. To the newspapers he is as if he were not. But in the\r\neleventh year he suffers heavy losses and, at last, his resources all\r\ngone, summons his lawyer and arranges for the making of an assignment.\r\nThe lawyer posts off to the County Clerk's office, and a clerk there\r\nmakes the necessary entries in the official docket. Here in step the\r\nnewspapers. While the clerk is writing Smith's business obituary a\r\nreporter glances over his shoulder and a few minutes later the\r\nreporters know Smith's troubles and are as well informed concerning\r\nhis business status as they would be had they kept a reporter at his\r\ndoor every day for over ten years. [Footnote: _Op. cit._, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Given says that the newspapers know \"Smith's troubles\" and\r\n\"his business status,\" he does not mean that they know them as Smith\r\nknows them, or as Mr. Arnold Bennett would know them if he had made\r\nSmith the hero of a three volume novel. The newspapers know only \"in a\r\nfew minutes\" the bald facts which are recorded in the County Clerk's\r\nOffice. That overt act \"uncovers\" the news about Smith. Whether the\r\nnews will be followed up or not is another matter. The point is that\r\nbefore a series of events become news they have usually to make\r\nthemselves noticeable in some more or less overt act. Generally too,\r\nin a crudely overt act. Smith's friends may have known for years that\r\nhe was taking risks, rumors may even have reached the financial editor\r\nif Smith's friends were talkative. But apart from the fact that none\r\nof this could be published because it would be libel, there is in\r\nthese rumors nothing definite on which to peg a story. Something\r\ndefinite must occur that has unmistakable form. It may be the act of\r\ngoing into bankruptcy, it may be a fire, a collision, an assault, a\r\nriot, an arrest, a denunciation, the introduction of a bill, a speech,\r\na vote, a meeting, the expressed opinion of a well known citizen, an\r\neditorial in a newspaper, a sale, a wage-schedule, a price change, the\r\nproposal to build a bridge.... There must be a manifestation. The\r\ncourse of events must assume a certain definable shape, and until it\r\nis in a phase where some aspect is an accomplished fact, news does not\r\nseparate itself from the ocean of possible truth.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nNaturally there is room for wide difference of opinion as to when\r\nevents have a shape that can be reported. A good journalist will find\r\nnews oftener than a hack. If he sees a building with a dangerous list,\r\nhe does not have to wait until it falls into the street in order to\r\nrecognize news. It was a great reporter who guessed the name of the\r\nnext Indian Viceroy when he heard that Lord So-and-So was inquiring\r\nabout climates. There are lucky shots but the number of men who can\r\nmake them is small. Usually it is the stereotyped shape assumed by an\r\nevent at an obvious place that uncovers the run of the news. The most\r\nobvious place is where people's affairs touch public authority. De\r\nminimis non curat lex. It is at these places that marriages, births,\r\ndeaths, contracts, failures, arrivals, departures, lawsuits,\r\ndisorders, epidemics and calamities are made known.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, therefore, the news is not a mirror of social\r\nconditions, but the report of an aspect that has obtruded itself. The\r\nnews does not tell you how the seed is germinating in the ground, but\r\nit may tell you when the first sprout breaks through the surface. It\r\nmay even tell you what somebody says is happening to the seed under\r\nground. It may tell you that the sprout did not come up at the time it\r\nwas expected. The more points, then, at which any happening can be\r\nfixed, objectified, measured, named, the more points there are at\r\nwhich news can occur.\r\n\r\nSo, if some day a legislature, having exhausted all other ways of\r\nimproving mankind, should forbid the scoring of baseball games, it\r\nmight still be possible to play some sort of game in which the umpire\r\ndecided according to his own sense of fair play how long the game\r\nshould last, when each team should go to bat, and who should be\r\nregarded as the winner. If that game were reported in the newspapers\r\nit would consist of a record of the umpire's decisions, plus the\r\nreporter's impression of the hoots and cheers of the crowd, plus at\r\nbest a vague account of how certain men, who had no specified position\r\non the field moved around for a few hours on an unmarked piece of sod.\r\nThe more you try to imagine the logic of so absurd a predicament, the\r\nmore clear it becomes that for the purposes of newsgathering, (let\r\nalone the purposes of playing the game) it is impossible to do much\r\nwithout an apparatus and rules for naming, scoring, recording. Because\r\nthat machinery is far from perfect, the umpire's life is often a\r\ndistracted one. Many crucial plays he has to judge by eye. The last\r\nvestige of dispute could be taken out of the game, as it has been\r\ntaken out of chess when people obey the rules, if somebody thought it\r\nworth his while to photograph every play. It was the moving pictures\r\nwhich finally settled a real doubt in many reporters' minds, owing to\r\nthe slowness of the human eye, as to just what blow of Dempsey's\r\nknocked out Carpentier.\r\n\r\nWherever there is a good machinery of record, the modern news service\r\nworks with great precision. There is one on the stock exchange, and\r\nthe news of price movements is flashed over tickers with dependable\r\naccuracy. There is a machinery for election returns, and when the\r\ncounting and tabulating are well done, the result of a national\r\nelection is usually known on the night of the election. In civilized\r\ncommunities deaths, births, marriages and divorces are recorded, and\r\nare known accurately except where there is concealment or neglect. The\r\nmachinery exists for some, and only some, aspects of industry and\r\ngovernment, in varying degrees of precision for securities, money and\r\nstaples, bank clearances, realty transactions, wage scales. It exists\r\nfor imports and exports because they pass through a custom house and\r\ncan be directly recorded. It exists in nothing like the same degree\r\nfor internal trade, and especially for trade over the counter.\r\n\r\nIt will be found, I think, that there is a very direct relation\r\nbetween the certainty of news and the system of record. If you call to\r\nmind the topics which form the principal indictment by reformers\r\nagainst the press, you find they are subjects in which the newspaper\r\noccupies the position of the umpire in the unscored baseball game. All\r\nnews about states of mind is of this character: so are all\r\ndescriptions of personalities, of sincerity, aspiration, motive,\r\nintention, of mass feeling, of national feeling, of public opinion,\r\nthe policies of foreign governments. So is much news about what is\r\ngoing to happen. So are questions turning on private profit, private\r\nincome, wages, working conditions, the efficiency of labor,\r\neducational opportunity, unemployment, [Footnote: Think of what guess\r\nwork went into the Reports of Unemployment in 1921.] monotony, health,\r\ndiscrimination, unfairness, restraint of trade, waste, \"backward\r\npeoples,\" conservatism, imperialism, radicalism, liberty, honor,\r\nrighteousness. All involve data that are at best spasmodically\r\nrecorded. The data may be hidden because of a censorship or a\r\ntradition of privacy, they may not exist because nobody thinks record\r\nimportant, because he thinks it red tape, or because nobody has yet\r\ninvented an objective system of measurement. Then the news on these\r\nsubjects is bound to be debatable, when it is not wholly neglected.\r\nThe events which are not scored are reported either as personal and\r\nconventional opinions, or they are not news. They do not take shape\r\nuntil somebody protests, or somebody investigates, or somebody\r\npublicly, in the etymological meaning of the word, makes an\r\n_issue_ of them.\r\n\r\nThis is the underlying reason for the existence of the press agent.\r\nThe enormous discretion as to what facts and what impressions shall be\r\nreported is steadily convincing every organized group of people that\r\nwhether it wishes to secure publicity or to avoid it, the exercise of\r\ndiscretion cannot be left to the reporter. It is safer to hire a press\r\nagent who stands between the group and the newspapers. Having hired\r\nhim, the temptation to exploit his strategic position is very great.\r\n\"Shortly before the war,\" says Mr. Frank Cobb, \"the newspapers of New\r\nYork took a census of the press agents who were regularly employed and\r\nregularly accredited and found that there were about twelve hundred of\r\nthem. How many there are now (1919) I do not pretend to know, but what\r\nI do know is that many of the direct channels to news have been closed\r\nand the information for the public is first filtered through publicity\r\nagents. The great corporations have them, the banks have them, the\r\nrailroads have them, all the organizations of business and of social\r\nand political activity have them, and they are the media through which\r\nnews comes. Even statesmen have them.\" [Footnote: Address before the\r\nWomen's City Club of New York, Dec. 11, 1919. Reprinted, _New\r\nRepublic_, Dec. 31, 1919, p. 44.]\r\n\r\nWere reporting the simple recovery of obvious facts, the press agent\r\nwould be little more than a clerk. But since, in respect to most of\r\nthe big topics of news, the facts are not simple, and not at all\r\nobvious, but subject to choice and opinion, it is natural that\r\neveryone should wish to make his own choice of facts for the\r\nnewspapers to print. The publicity man does that. And in doing it, he\r\ncertainly saves the reporter much trouble, by presenting him a clear\r\npicture of a situation out of which he might otherwise make neither\r\nhead nor tail. But it follows that the picture which the publicity man\r\nmakes for the reporter is the one he wishes the public to see. He is\r\ncensor and propagandist, responsible only to his employers, and to the\r\nwhole truth responsible only as it accords with the employers'\r\nconception of his own interests.\r\n\r\nThe development of the publicity man is a clear sign that the facts of\r\nmodern life do not spontaneously take a shape in which they can be\r\nknown. They must be given a shape by somebody, and since in the daily\r\nroutine reporters cannot give a shape to facts, and since there is\r\nlittle disinterested organization of intelligence, the need for some\r\nformulation is being met by the interested parties.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe good press agent understands that the virtues of his cause are not\r\nnews, unless they are such strange virtues that they jut right out of\r\nthe routine of life. This is not because the newspapers do not like\r\nvirtue, but because it is not worth while to say that nothing has\r\nhappened when nobody expected anything to happen. So if the publicity\r\nman wishes free publicity he has, speaking quite accurately, to start\r\nsomething. He arranges a stunt: obstructs the traffic, teases the\r\npolice, somehow manages to entangle his client or his cause with an\r\nevent that is already news. The suffragists knew this, did not\r\nparticularly enjoy the knowledge but acted on it, and kept suffrage in\r\nthe news long after the arguments pro and con were straw in their\r\nmouths, and people were about to settle down to thinking of the\r\nsuffrage movement as one of the established institutions of American\r\nlife. [Footnote: _Cf._ Inez Haynes Irwin, _The Story of the\r\nWoman's Party._ It is not only a good account of a vital part of a\r\ngreat agitation, but a reservoir of material on successful,\r\nnon-revolutionary, non-conspiring agitation under modern conditions of\r\npublic attention, public interest, and political habit.]\r\n\r\nFortunately the suffragists, as distinct from the feminists, had a\r\nperfectly concrete objective, and a very simple one. What the vote\r\nsymbolizes is not simple, as the ablest advocates and the ablest\r\nopponents knew. But the right to vote is a simple and familiar right.\r\nNow in labor disputes, which are probably the chief item in the\r\ncharges against newspapers, the right to strike, like the right to\r\nvote, is simple enough. But the causes and objects of a particular\r\nstrike are like the causes and objects of the woman's movement,\r\nextremely subtle.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the conditions leading up to a strike are bad. What is\r\nthe measure of evil? A certain conception of a proper standard of\r\nliving, hygiene, economic security, and human dignity. The industry\r\nmay be far below the theoretical standard of the community, and the\r\nworkers may be too wretched to protest. Conditions may be above the\r\nstandard, and the workers may protest violently. The standard is at\r\nbest a vague measure. However, we shall assume that the conditions are\r\nbelow par, as par is understood by the editor. Occasionally without\r\nwaiting for the workers to threaten, but prompted say by a social\r\nworker, he will send reporters to investigate, and will call attention\r\nto bad conditions. Necessarily he cannot do that often. For these\r\ninvestigations cost time, money, special talent, and a lot of space.\r\nTo make plausible a report that conditions are bad, you need a good\r\nmany columns of print. In order to tell the truth about the steel\r\nworker in the Pittsburgh district, there was needed a staff of\r\ninvestigators, a great deal of time, and several fat volumes of print.\r\nIt is impossible to suppose that any daily newspaper could normally\r\nregard the making of Pittsburgh Surveys, or even Interchurch Steel\r\nReports, as one of its tasks. News which requires so much trouble as\r\nthat to obtain is beyond the resources of a daily press. [Footnote: Not\r\nlong ago Babe Ruth was jailed for speeding. Released from jail just\r\nbefore the afternoon game started, he rushed into his waiting\r\nautomobile, and made up for time lost in jail by breaking the speed\r\nlaws on his way to the ball grounds. No policeman stopped him, but a\r\nreporter timed him, and published his speed the next morning. Babe\r\nRuth is an exceptional man. Newspapers cannot time all motorists. They\r\nhave to take their news about speeding from the police.]\r\n\r\nThe bad conditions as such are not news, because in all but\r\nexceptional cases, journalism is not a first hand report of the raw\r\nmaterial. It is a report of that material after it has been stylized.\r\nThus bad conditions might become news if the Board of Health reported\r\nan unusually high death rate in an industrial area. Failing an\r\nintervention of this sort, the facts do not become news, until the\r\nworkers organize and make a demand upon their employers. Even then, if\r\nan easy settlement is certain the news value is low, whether or not\r\nthe conditions themselves are remedied in the settlement. But if\r\nindustrial relations collapse into a strike or lockout the news value\r\nincreases. If the stoppage involves a service on which the readers of\r\nthe newspapers immediately depend, or if it involves a breach of\r\norder, the news value is still greater.\r\n\r\nThe underlying trouble appears in the news through certain easily\r\nrecognizable symptoms, a demand, a strike, disorder. From the point of\r\nview of the worker, or of the disinterested seeker of justice, the\r\ndemand, the strike, and the disorder, are merely incidents in a\r\nprocess that for them is richly complicated. But since all the\r\nimmediate realities lie outside the direct experience both of the\r\nreporter, and of the special public by which most newspapers are\r\nsupported, they have normally to wait for a signal in the shape of an\r\novert act. When that signal comes, say through a walkout of the men or\r\na summons for the police, it calls into play the stereotypes people\r\nhave about strikes and disorders. The unseen struggle has none of its\r\nown flavor. It is noted abstractly, and that abstraction is then\r\nanimated by the immediate experience of the reader and reporter.\r\nObviously this is a very different experience from that which the\r\nstrikers have. They feel, let us say, the temper of the foreman, the\r\nnerve-racking monotony of the machine, the depressingly bad air, the\r\ndrudgery of their wives, the stunting of their children, the dinginess\r\nof their tenements. The slogans of the strike are invested with these\r\nfeelings. But the reporter and reader see at first only a strike and\r\nsome catchwords. They invest these with their feelings. Their feelings\r\nmay be that their jobs are insecure because the strikers are stopping\r\ngoods they need in their work, that there will be shortage and higher\r\nprices, that it is all devilishly inconvenient. These, too, are\r\nrealities. And when they give color to the abstract news that a strike\r\nhas been called, it is in the nature of things that the workers are at\r\na disadvantage. It is in the nature, that is to say, of the existing\r\nsystem of industrial relations that news arising from grievances or\r\nhopes by workers should almost invariably be uncovered by an overt\r\nattack on production.\r\n\r\nYou have, therefore, the circumstances in all their sprawling\r\ncomplexity, the overt act which signalizes them, the stereotyped\r\nbulletin which publishes the signal, and the meaning that the reader\r\nhimself injects, after he has derived that meaning from the experience\r\nwhich directly affects him. Now the reader's experience of a strike\r\nmay be very important indeed, but from the point of view of the\r\ncentral trouble which caused the strike, it is eccentric. Yet this\r\neccentric meaning is automatically the most interesting. [Footnote:\r\n_Cf_. Ch. XI, \"The Enlisting of Interest.\"] To enter imaginatively\r\ninto the central issues is for the reader to step out of himself, and into\r\nvery different lives.\r\n\r\nIt follows that in the reporting of strikes, the easiest way is to let\r\nthe news be uncovered by the overt act, and to describe the event as\r\nthe story of interference with the reader's life. That is where his\r\nattention is first aroused, and his interest most easily enlisted. A\r\ngreat deal, I think myself the crucial part, of what looks to the\r\nworker and the reformer as deliberate misrepresentation on the part of\r\nnewspapers, is the direct outcome of a practical difficulty in\r\nuncovering the news, and the emotional difficulty of making distant\r\nfacts interesting unless, as Emerson says, we can \"perceive (them) to\r\nbe only a new version of our familiar experience\" and can \"set about\r\ntranslating (them) at once into our parallel facts.\" [Footnote: From\r\nhis essay entitled _Art and Criticism_. The quotation occurs in a\r\npassage cited on page 87 of Professor R. W. Brown's, _The Writer's\r\nArt._]\r\n\r\nIf you study the way many a strike is reported in the press, you will\r\nfind, very often, that the issues are rarely in the headlines, barely\r\nin the leading paragraphs, and sometimes not even mentioned anywhere.\r\nA labor dispute in another city has to be very important before the\r\nnews account contains any definite information as to what is in\r\ndispute. The routine of the news works that way, with modifications it\r\nworks that way in regard to political issues and international news as\r\nwell. The news is an account of the overt phases that are interesting,\r\nand the pressure on the newspaper to adhere to this routine comes from\r\nmany sides. It comes from the economy of noting only the stereotyped\r\nphase of a situation. It comes from the difficulty of finding\r\njournalists who can see what they have not learned to see. It comes\r\nfrom the almost unavoidable difficulty of finding sufficient space in\r\nwhich even the best journalist can make plausible an unconventional\r\nview. It comes from the economic necessity of interesting the reader\r\nquickly, and the economic risk involved in not interesting him at all,\r\nor of offending him by unexpected news insufficiently or clumsily\r\ndescribed. All these difficulties combined make for uncertainty in the\r\neditor when there are dangerous issues at stake, and cause him\r\nnaturally to prefer the indisputable fact and a treatment more readily\r\nadapted to the reader's interest. The indisputable fact and the easy\r\ninterest, are the strike itself and the reader's inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAll the subtler and deeper truths are in the present organization of\r\nindustry very unreliable truths. They involve judgments about\r\nstandards of living, productivity, human rights that are endlessly\r\ndebatable in the absence of exact record and quantitative analysis.\r\nAnd as long as these do not exist in industry, the run of news about\r\nit will tend, as Emerson said, quoting from Isocrates, \"to make of\r\nmoles mountains, and of mountains moles.\" [Footnote: _Id.,\r\nsupra_] Where there is no constitutional procedure in industry, and\r\nno expert sifting of evidence and the claims, the fact that is\r\nsensational to the reader is the fact that almost every journalist\r\nwill seek. Given the industrial relations that so largely prevail,\r\neven where there is conference or arbitration, but no independent\r\nfiltering of the facts for decision, the issue for the newspaper\r\npublic will tend not to be the issue for the industry. And so to try\r\ndisputes by an appeal through the newspapers puts a burden upon\r\nnewspapers and readers which they cannot and ought not to carry. As\r\nlong as real law and order do not exist, the bulk of the news will,\r\nunless consciously and courageously corrected, work against those who\r\nhave no lawful and orderly method of asserting themselves. The\r\nbulletins from the scene of action will note the trouble that arose\r\nfrom the assertion, rather than the reasons which led to it. The\r\nreasons are intangible.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe editor deals with these bulletins. He sits in his office, reads\r\nthem, rarely does he see any large portion of the events themselves.\r\nHe must, as we have seen, woo at least a section of his readers every\r\nday, because they will leave him without mercy if a rival paper\r\nhappens to hit their fancy. He works under enormous pressure, for the\r\ncompetition of newspapers is often a matter of minutes. Every bulletin\r\nrequires a swift but complicated judgment. It must be understood, put\r\nin relation to other bulletins also understood, and played up or\r\nplayed down according to its probable interest for the public, as the\r\neditor conceives it. Without standardization, without stereotypes,\r\nwithout routine judgments, without a fairly ruthless disregard of\r\nsubtlety, the editor would soon die of excitement. The final page is\r\nof a definite size, must be ready at a precise moment; there can be\r\nonly a certain number of captions on the items, and in each caption\r\nthere must be a definite number of letters. Always there is the\r\nprecarious urgency of the buying public, the law of libel, and the\r\npossibility of endless trouble. The thing could not be managed at all\r\nwithout systematization, for in a standardized product there is\r\neconomy of time and effort, as well as a partial guarantee against\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nIt is here that newspapers influence each other most deeply. Thus when\r\nthe war broke out, the American newspapers were confronted with a\r\nsubject about which they had no previous experience. Certain dailies,\r\nrich enough to pay cable tolls, took the lead in securing news, and\r\nthe way that news was presented became a model for the whole press.\r\nBut where did that model come from? It came from the English press,\r\nnot because Northcliffe owned American newspapers, but because at\r\nfirst it was easier to buy English correspondence, and because, later,\r\nit was easier for American journalists to read English newspapers than\r\nit was for them to read any others. London was the cable and news\r\ncenter, and it was there that a certain technic for reporting the war\r\nwas evolved. Something similar occurred in the reporting of the\r\nRussian Revolution. In that instance, access to Russia was closed by\r\nmilitary censorship, both Russian and Allied, and closed still more\r\neffectively by the difficulties of the Russian language. But above all\r\nit was closed to effective news reporting by the fact that the hardest\r\nthing to report is chaos, even though it is an evolving chaos. This\r\nput the formulating of Russian news at its source in Helsingfors,\r\nStockholm, Geneva, Paris and London, into the hands of censors and\r\npropagandists. They were for a long time subject to no check of any\r\nkind. Until they had made themselves ridiculous they created, let us\r\nadmit, out of some genuine aspects of the huge Russian maelstrom, a\r\nset of stereotypes so evocative of hate and fear, that the very best\r\ninstinct of journalism, its desire to go and see and tell, was for a\r\nlong time crushed. [Footnote: _Cf. A Test of the News,_ by Walter\r\nLippmann and Charles Merz, assisted by Faye Lippmann, _New\r\nRepublic,_ August 4, 1920.]\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nEvery newspaper when it reaches the reader is the result of a whole\r\nseries of selections as to what items shall be printed, in what\r\nposition they shall be printed, how much space each shall occupy, what\r\nemphasis each shall have. There are no objective standards here. There\r\nare conventions. Take two newspapers published in the same city on the\r\nsame morning. The headline of one reads: \"Britain pledges aid to\r\nBerlin against French aggression; France openly backs Poles.\" The\r\nheadline of the second is \"Mrs. Stillman's Other Love.\" Which you\r\nprefer is a matter of taste, but not entirely a matter of the editor's\r\ntaste. It is a matter of his judgment as to what will absorb the half\r\nhour's attention a certain set of readers will give to his newspaper.\r\nNow the problem of securing attention is by no means equivalent to\r\ndisplaying the news in the perspective laid down by religious teaching\r\nor by some form of ethical culture. It is a problem of provoking\r\nfeeling in the reader, of inducing him to feel a sense of personal\r\nidentification with the stories he is reading. News which does not\r\noffer this opportunity to introduce oneself into the struggle which it\r\ndepicts cannot appeal to a wide audience. The audience must\r\nparticipate in the news, much as it participates in the drama, by\r\npersonal identification. Just as everyone holds his breath when the\r\nheroine is in danger, as he helps Babe Ruth swing his bat, so in\r\nsubtler form the reader enters into the news. In order that he shall\r\nenter he must find a familiar foothold in the story, and this is\r\nsupplied to him by the use of stereotypes. They tell him that if an\r\nassociation of plumbers is called a \"combine\" it is appropriate to\r\ndevelop his hostility; if it is called a \"group of leading business\r\nmen\" the cue is for a favorable reaction.\r\n\r\nIt is in a combination of these elements that the power to create\r\nopinion resides. Editorials reinforce. Sometimes in a situation that\r\non the news pages is too confusing to permit of identification, they\r\ngive the reader a clue by means of which he engages himself. A clue he\r\nmust have if, as most of us must, he is to seize the news in a hurry.\r\nA suggestion of some sort he demands, which tells him, so to speak,\r\nwhere he, a man conceiving himself to be such and such a person, shall\r\nintegrate his feelings with the news he reads.\r\n\r\n\"It has been said\" writes Walter Bagehot, [Footnote: On the Emotion of\r\nConviction, _Literary Studies_, Vol. Ill, p. 172.] \"that if you\r\ncan only get a middleclass Englishman to think whether there are\r\n'snails in Sirius,' he will soon have an opinion on it. It will be\r\ndifficult to make him think, but if he does think, he cannot rest in a\r\nnegative, he will come to some decision. And on any ordinary topic, of\r\ncourse, it is so. A grocer has a full creed as to foreign policy, a\r\nyoung lady a complete theory of the sacraments, as to which neither\r\nhas any doubt whatever.\"\r\n\r\nYet that same grocer will have many doubts about his groceries, and\r\nthat young lady, marvelously certain about the sacraments, may have\r\nall kinds of doubts as to whether to marry the grocer, and if not\r\nwhether it is proper to accept his attentions. The ability to rest in\r\nthe negative implies either a lack of interest in the result, or a\r\nvivid sense of competing alternatives. In the case of foreign policy\r\nor the sacraments, the interest in the results is intense, while means\r\nfor checking the opinion are poor. This is the plight of the reader of\r\nthe general news. If he is to read it at all he must be interested,\r\nthat is to say, he must enter into the situation and care about the\r\noutcome. But if he does that he cannot rest in a negative, and unless\r\nindependent means of checking the lead given him by his newspaper\r\nexists, the very fact that he is interested may make it difficult to\r\narrive at that balance of opinions which may most nearly approximate\r\nthe truth. The more passionately involved he becomes, the more he will\r\ntend to resent not only a different view, but a disturbing bit of\r\nnews. That is why many a newspaper finds that, having honestly evoked\r\nthe partisanship of its readers, it can not easily, supposing the\r\neditor believes the facts warrant it, change position. If a change is\r\nnecessary, the transition has to be managed with the utmost skill and\r\ndelicacy. Usually a newspaper will not attempt so hazardous a\r\nperformance. It is easier and safer to have the news of that subject\r\ntaper off and disappear, thus putting out the fire by starving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nNEWS, TRUTH, AND A CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs we begin to make more and more exact studies of the press, much\r\nwill depend upon the hypothesis we hold. If we assume with Mr.\r\nSinclair, and most of his opponents, that news and truth are two words\r\nfor the same thing, we shall, I believe, arrive nowhere. We shall\r\nprove that on this point the newspaper lied. We shall prove that on\r\nthat point Mr. Sinclair's account lied. We shall demonstrate that Mr.\r\nSinclair lied when he said that somebody lied, and that somebody lied\r\nwhen he said Mr. Sinclair lied. We shall vent our feelings, but we\r\nshall vent them into air.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis, which seems to me the most fertile, is that news and\r\ntruth are not the same thing, and must be clearly distinguished.\r\n[Footnote: When I wrote _Liberty and the News,_ I did not\r\nunderstand this distinction clearly enough to state it, but _cf._\r\np. 89 ff.] The function of news is to signalize an event, the function\r\nof truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them into\r\nrelation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men\r\ncan act. Only at those points, where social conditions take\r\nrecognizable and measurable shape, do the body of truth and the body\r\nof news coincide. That is a comparatively small part of the whole\r\nfield of human interest. In this sector, and only in this sector, the\r\ntests of the news are sufficiently exact to make the charges of\r\nperversion or suppression more than a partisan judgment. There is no\r\ndefense, no extenuation, no excuse whatever, for stating six times\r\nthat Lenin is dead, when the only information the paper possesses is a\r\nreport that he is dead from a source repeatedly shown to be\r\nunreliable. The news, in that instance, is not \"Lenin Dead\" but\r\n\"Helsingfors Says Lenin is Dead.\" And a newspaper can be asked to take\r\nthe responsibility of not making Lenin more dead than the source of\r\nthe news is reliable; if there is one subject on which editors are\r\nmost responsible it is in their judgment of the reliability of the\r\nsource. But when it comes to dealing, for example, with stories of\r\nwhat the Russian people want, no such test exists.\r\n\r\nThe absence of these exact tests accounts, I think, for the character\r\nof the profession, as no other explanation does. There is a very small\r\nbody of exact knowledge, which it requires no outstanding ability or\r\ntraining to deal with. The rest is in the journalist's own discretion.\r\nOnce he departs from the region where it is definitely recorded at the\r\nCounty Clerk's office that John Smith has gone into bankruptcy, all\r\nfixed standards disappear. The story of why John Smith failed, his\r\nhuman frailties, the analysis of the economic conditions on which he\r\nwas shipwrecked, all of this can be told in a hundred different ways.\r\nThere is no discipline in applied psychology, as there is a discipline\r\nin medicine, engineering, or even law, which has authority to direct\r\nthe journalist's mind when he passes from the news to the vague realm\r\nof truth. There are no canons to direct his own mind, and no canons\r\nthat coerce the reader's judgment or the publisher's. His version of\r\nthe truth is only his version. How can he demonstrate the truth as he\r\nsees it? He cannot demonstrate it, any more than Mr. Sinclair Lewis\r\ncan demonstrate that he has told the whole truth about Main Street.\r\nAnd the more he understands his own weaknesses, the more ready he is\r\nto admit that where there is no objective test, his own opinion is in\r\nsome vital measure constructed out of his own stereotypes, according\r\nto his own code, and by the urgency of his own interest. He knows that\r\nhe is seeing the world through subjective lenses. He cannot deny that\r\nhe too is, as Shelley remarked, a dome of many-colored glass which\r\nstains the white radiance of eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd by this knowledge his assurance is tempered. He may have all kinds\r\nof moral courage, and sometimes has, but he lacks that sustaining\r\nconviction of a certain technic which finally freed the physical\r\nsciences from theological control. It was the gradual development of\r\nan irrefragable method that gave the physicist his intellectual\r\nfreedom as against all the powers of the world. His proofs were so\r\nclear, his evidence so sharply superior to tradition, that he broke\r\naway finally from all control. But the journalist has no such support\r\nin his own conscience or in fact. The control exercised over him by\r\nthe opinions of his employers and his readers, is not the control of\r\ntruth by prejudice, but of one opinion by another opinion that it is\r\nnot demonstrably less true. Between Judge Gary's assertion that the\r\nunions will destroy American institutions, and Mr. Gomper's assertion\r\nthat they are agencies of the rights of man, the choice has, in large\r\nmeasure, to be governed by the will to believe.\r\n\r\nThe task of deflating these controversies, and reducing them to a\r\npoint where they can be reported as news, is not a task which the\r\nreporter can perform. It is possible and necessary for journalists to\r\nbring home to people the uncertain character of the truth on which\r\ntheir opinions are founded, and by criticism and agitation to prod\r\nsocial science into making more usable formulations of social facts,\r\nand to prod statesmen into establishing more visible institutions. The\r\npress, in other words, can fight for the extension of reportable\r\ntruth. But as social truth is organized to-day, the press is not\r\nconstituted to furnish from one edition to the next the amount of\r\nknowledge which the democratic theory of public opinion demands. This\r\nis not due to the Brass Check, as the quality of news in radical\r\npapers shows, but to the fact that the press deals with a society in\r\nwhich the governing forces are so imperfectly recorded. The theory\r\nthat the press can itself record those forces is false. It can\r\nnormally record only what has been recorded for it by the working of\r\ninstitutions. Everything else is argument and opinion, and fluctuates\r\nwith the vicissitudes, the self-consciousness, and the courage of the\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\nIf the press is not so universally wicked, nor so deeply conspiring,\r\nas Mr. Sinclair would have us believe, it is very much more frail than\r\nthe democratic theory has as yet admitted. It is too frail to carry\r\nthe whole burden of popular sovereignty, to supply spontaneously the\r\ntruth which democrats hoped was inborn. And when we expect it to\r\nsupply such a body of truth we employ a misleading standard of\r\njudgment. We misunderstand the limited nature of news, the illimitable\r\ncomplexity of society; we overestimate our own endurance, public\r\nspirit, and all-round competence. We suppose an appetite for\r\nuninteresting truths which is not discovered by any honest analysis of\r\nour own tastes.\r\n\r\nIf the newspapers, then, are to be charged with the duty of\r\ntranslating the whole public life of mankind, so that every adult can\r\narrive at an opinion on every moot topic, they fail, they are bound to\r\nfail, in any future one can conceive they will continue to fail. It is\r\nnot possible to assume that a world, carried on by division of labor\r\nand distribution of authority, can be governed by universal opinions\r\nin the whole population. Unconsciously the theory sets up the single\r\nreader as theoretically omnicompetent, and puts upon the press the\r\nburden of accomplishing whatever representative government, industrial\r\norganization, and diplomacy have failed to accomplish. Acting upon\r\neverybody for thirty minutes in twenty-four hours, the press is asked\r\nto create a mystical force called Public Opinion that will take up the\r\nslack in public institutions. The press has often mistakenly pretended\r\nthat it could do just that. It has at great moral cost to itself,\r\nencouraged a democracy, still bound to its original premises, to\r\nexpect newspapers to supply spontaneously for every organ of\r\ngovernment, for every social problem, the machinery of information\r\nwhich these do not normally supply themselves. Institutions, having\r\nfailed to furnish themselves with instruments of knowledge, have\r\nbecome a bundle of \"problems,\" which the population as a whole,\r\nreading the press as a whole, is supposed to solve.\r\n\r\nThe press, in other words, has come to be regarded as an organ of\r\ndirect democracy, charged on a much wider scale, and from day to day,\r\nwith the function often attributed to the initiative, referendum, and\r\nrecall. The Court of Public Opinion, open day and night, is to lay\r\ndown the law for everything all the time. It is not workable. And when\r\nyou consider the nature of news, it is not even thinkable. For the\r\nnews, as we have seen, is precise in proportion to the precision with\r\nwhich the event is recorded. Unless the event is capable of being\r\nnamed, measured, given shape, made specific, it either fails to take\r\non the character of news, or it is subject to the accidents and\r\nprejudices of observation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, on the whole, the quality of the news about modern society\r\nis an index of its social organization. The better the institutions,\r\nthe more all interests concerned are formally represented, the more\r\nissues are disentangled, the more objective criteria are introduced,\r\nthe more perfectly an affair can be presented as news. At its best the\r\npress is a servant and guardian of institutions; at its worst it is a\r\nmeans by which a few exploit social disorganization to their own ends.\r\nIn the degree to which institutions fail to function, the unscrupulous\r\njournalist can fish in troubled waters, and the conscientious one must\r\ngamble with uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThe press is no substitute for institutions. It is like the beam of a\r\nsearchlight that moves restlessly about, bringing one episode and then\r\nanother out of darkness into vision. Men cannot do the work of the\r\nworld by this light alone. They cannot govern society by episodes,\r\nincidents, and eruptions. It is only when they work by a steady light\r\nof their own, that the press, when it is turned upon them, reveals a\r\nsituation intelligible enough for a popular decision. The trouble lies\r\ndeeper than the press, and so does the remedy. It lies in social\r\norganization based on a system of analysis and record, and in all the\r\ncorollaries of that principle; in the abandonment of the theory of the\r\nomnicompetent citizen, in the decentralization of decision, in the\r\ncoordination of decision by comparable record and analysis. If at the\r\ncenters of management there is a running audit, which makes work\r\nintelligible to those who do it, and those who superintend it, issues\r\nwhen they arise are not the mere collisions of the blind. Then, too,\r\nthe news is uncovered for the press by a system of intelligence that\r\nis also a check upon the press.\r\n\r\nThat is the radical way. For the troubles of the press, like the\r\ntroubles of representative government, be it territorial or\r\nfunctional, like the troubles of industry, be it capitalist,\r\ncooperative, or communist, go back to a common source: to the failure\r\nof self-governing people to transcend their casual experience and\r\ntheir prejudice, by inventing, creating, and organizing a machinery of\r\nknowledge. It is because they are compelled to act without a reliable\r\npicture of the world, that governments, schools, newspapers and\r\nchurches make such small headway against the more obvious failings of\r\ndemocracy, against violent prejudice, apathy, preference for the\r\ncurious trivial as against the dull important, and the hunger for\r\nsideshows and three legged calves. This is the primary defect of\r\npopular government, a defect inherent in its traditions, and all its\r\nother defects can, I believe, be traced to this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII\r\n\r\nORGANIZED INTELLIGENCE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER    XXV. THE ENTERING WEDGE\r\n   \"      XXVI. INTELLIGENCE WORK\r\n   \"     XXVII. THE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC\r\n   \"    XXVIII. THE APPEAL TO REASON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE ENTERING WEDGE\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIf the remedy were interesting, American pioneers like Charles\r\nMcCarthy, Robert Valentine, and Frederick W. Taylor would not have had\r\nto fight so hard for a hearing. But it is clear why they had to fight,\r\nand why bureaus of governmental research, industrial audits, budgeting\r\nand the like are the ugly ducklings of reform. They reverse the\r\nprocess by which interesting public opinions are built up. Instead of\r\npresenting a casual fact, a large screen of stereotypes, and a\r\ndramatic identification, they break down the drama, break through the\r\nstereotypes, and offer men a picture of facts, which is unfamiliar and\r\nto them impersonal. When this is not painful, it is dull, and those to\r\nwhom it is painful, the trading politician and the partisan who has\r\nmuch to conceal, often exploit the dullness that the public feels, in\r\norder to remove the pain that they feel.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nYet every complicated community has sought the assistance of special\r\nmen, of augurs, priests, elders. Our own democracy, based though it\r\nwas on a theory of universal competence, sought lawyers to manage its\r\ngovernment, and to help manage its industry. It was recognized that\r\nthe specially trained man was in some dim way oriented to a wider\r\nsystem of truth than that which arises spontaneously in the amateur's\r\nmind. But experience has shown that the traditional lawyer's equipment\r\nwas not enough assistance. The Great Society had grown furiously and\r\nto colossal dimensions by the application of technical knowledge. It\r\nwas made by engineers who had learned to use exact measurements and\r\nquantitative analysis. It could not be governed, men began to\r\ndiscover, by men who thought deductively about rights and wrongs. It\r\ncould be brought under human control only by the technic which had\r\ncreated it. Gradually, then, the more enlightened directing minds have\r\ncalled in experts who were trained, or had trained themselves, to make\r\nparts of this Great Society intelligible to those who manage it. These\r\nmen are known by all kinds of names, as statisticians, accountants,\r\nauditors, industrial counsellors, engineers of many species,\r\nscientific managers, personnel administrators, research men,\r\n\"scientists,\" and sometimes just as plain private secretaries. They\r\nhave brought with them each a jargon of his own, as well as filing\r\ncabinets, card catalogues, graphs, loose-leaf contraptions, and above\r\nall the perfectly sound ideal of an executive who sits before a\r\nflat-top desk, one sheet of typewritten paper before him, and decides\r\non matters of policy presented in a form ready for his rejection or\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThis whole development has been the work, not so much of a spontaneous\r\ncreative evolution, as of blind natural selection. The statesman, the\r\nexecutive, the party leader, the head of a voluntary association,\r\nfound that if he had to discuss two dozen different subjects in the\r\ncourse of the day, somebody would have to coach him. He began to\r\nclamor for memoranda. He found he could not read his mail. He demanded\r\nsomebody who would blue-pencil the interesting sentences in the\r\nimportant letters. He found he could not digest the great stacks of\r\ntype-written reports that grew mellow on his desk. He demanded\r\nsummaries. He found he could not read an unending series of figures.\r\nHe embraced the man who made colored pictures of them. He found that\r\nhe really did not know one machine from another. He hired engineers to\r\npick them, and tell him how much they cost and what they could do. He\r\npeeled off one burden after another, as a man will take off first his\r\nhat, then his coat, then his collar, when he is struggling to move an\r\nunwieldy load.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nYet curiously enough, though he knew that he needed help, he was slow\r\nto call in the social scientist. The chemist, the physicist, the\r\ngeologist, had a much earlier and more friendly reception.\r\nLaboratories were set up for them, inducements offered, for there was\r\nquick appreciation of the victories over nature. But the scientist who\r\nhas human nature as his problem is in a different case. There are many\r\nreasons for this: the chief one, that he has so few victories to\r\nexhibit. He has so few, because unless he deals with the historic\r\npast, he cannot prove his theories before offering them to the public.\r\nThe physical scientist can make an hypothesis, test it, revise the\r\nhypothesis hundreds of times, and, if after all that, he is wrong, no\r\none else has to pay the price. But the social scientist cannot begin\r\nto offer the assurance of a laboratory test, and if his advice is\r\nfollowed, and he is wrong, the consequences may be incalculable. He is\r\nin the nature of things far more responsible, and far less certain.\r\n\r\nBut more than that. In the laboratory sciences the student has\r\nconquered the dilemma of thought and action. He brings a sample of the\r\naction to a quiet place, where it can be repeated at will, and\r\nexamined at leisure. But the social scientist is constantly being\r\nimpaled on a dilemma. If he stays in his library, where he has the\r\nleisure to think, he has to rely upon the exceedingly casual and\r\nmeager printed record that comes to him through official reports,\r\nnewspapers, and interviews. If he goes out into \"the world\" where\r\nthings are happening, he has to serve a long, often wasteful,\r\napprenticeship, before he is admitted to the sanctum where they are\r\nbeing decided. What he cannot do is to dip into action and out again\r\nwhenever it suits him. There are no privileged listeners. The man of\r\naffairs, observing that the social scientist knows only from the\r\noutside what he knows, in part at least, from the inside, recognizing\r\nthat the social scientist's hypothesis is not in the nature of things\r\nsusceptible of laboratory proof, and that verification is possible\r\nonly in the \"real\" world, has developed a rather low opinion of social\r\nscientists who do not share his views of public policy.\r\n\r\nIn his heart of hearts the social scientist shares this estimate of\r\nhimself. He has little inner certainty about his own work. He only\r\nhalf believes in it, and being sure of nothing, he can find no\r\ncompelling reason for insisting on his own freedom of thought. What\r\ncan he actually claim for it, in the light of his own conscience?\r\n[Footnote: Cf. Charles E. Merriam, _The Present State of the Study\r\nof Politics_, _American Political Science Review_, Vol. XV.\r\nNo. 2, May, 1921.] His data are uncertain, his means of verification\r\nlacking. The very best qualities in him are a source of frustration.\r\nFor if he is really critical and saturated in the scientific spirit,\r\nhe cannot be doctrinaire, and go to Armageddon against the trustees\r\nand the students and the Civic Federation and the conservative press\r\nfor a theory of which he is not sure. If you are going to Armageddon,\r\nyou have to battle for the Lord, but the political scientist is always\r\na little doubtful whether the Lord called him.\r\n\r\nConsequently if so much of social science is apologetic rather than\r\nconstructive, the explanation lies in the opportunities of social\r\nscience, not in \"capitalism.\" The physical scientists achieved their\r\nfreedom from clericalism by working out a method that produced\r\nconclusions of a sort that could not be suppressed or ignored. They\r\nconvinced themselves and acquired dignity, and knew what they were\r\nfighting for. The social scientist will acquire his dignity and his\r\nstrength when he has worked out his method. He will do that by turning\r\ninto opportunity the need among directing men of the Great Society for\r\ninstruments of analysis by which an invisible and made intelligible.\r\n\r\nBut as things go now, the social scientist assembles his data out of a\r\nmass of unrelated material. Social processes are recorded\r\nspasmodically, quite often as accidents of administration. A report to\r\nCongress, a debate, an investigation, legal briefs, a census, a\r\ntariff, a tax schedule; the material, like the skull of the Piltdown\r\nman, has to be put together by ingenious inference before the student\r\nobtains any sort of picture of the event he is studying. Though it\r\ndeals with the conscious life of his fellow citizens, it is all too\r\noften distressingly opaque, because the man who is trying to\r\ngeneralize has practically no supervision of the way his data are\r\ncollected. Imagine medical research conducted by students who could\r\nrarely go into a hospital, were deprived of animal experiment, and\r\ncompelled to draw conclusions from the stories of people who had been\r\nill, the reports of nurses, each of whom had her own system of\r\ndiagnosis, and the statistics compiled by the Bureau of Internal\r\nRevenue on the excess profits of druggists. The social scientist has\r\nusually to make what he can out of categories that were uncritically\r\nin the mind of an official who administered some part of a law, or who\r\nwas out to justify, to persuade, to claim, or to prove. The student\r\nknows this, and, as a protection against it, has developed that branch\r\nof scholarship which is an elaborated suspicion about where to\r\ndiscount his information.\r\n\r\nThat is a virtue, but it becomes a very thin virtue when it is merely\r\na corrective for the unwholesome position of social science. For the\r\nscholar is condemned to guess as shrewdly as he can why in a situation\r\nnot clearly understood something or other may have happened. But the\r\nexpert who is employed as the mediator among representatives, and as\r\nthe mirror and measure of administration, has a very different control\r\nof the facts. Instead of being the man who generalizes from the facts\r\ndropped to him by the men of action, he becomes the man who prepares\r\nthe facts for the men of action. This is a profound change in his\r\nstrategic position. He no longer stands outside, chewing the cud\r\nprovided by busy men of affairs, but he takes his place in front of\r\ndecision instead of behind it. To-day the sequence is that the man of\r\naffairs finds his facts, and decides on the basis of them; then, some\r\ntime later, the social scientist deduces excellent reasons why he did\r\nor did not decide wisely. This ex post facto relationship is academic\r\nin the bad sense of that fine word. The real sequence should be one\r\nwhere the disinterested expert first finds and formulates the facts\r\nfor the man of action, and later makes what wisdom he can out of\r\ncomparison between the decision, which he understands, and the facts,\r\nwhich he organized.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nFor the physical sciences this change in strategic position began\r\nslowly, and then accelerated rapidly. There was a time when the\r\ninventor and the engineer were romantic half-starved outsiders,\r\ntreated as cranks. The business man and the artisan knew all the\r\nmysteries of their craft. Then the mysteries grew more mysterious, and\r\nat last industry began to depend upon physical laws and chemical\r\ncombinations that no eye could see, and only a trained mind could\r\nconceive. The scientist moved from his noble garret in the Latin\r\nQuarter into office buildings and laboratories. For he alone could\r\nconstruct a working image of the reality on which industry rested.\r\nFrom the new relationship he took as much as he gave, perhaps more:\r\npure science developed faster than applied, though it drew its\r\neconomic support, a great deal of its inspiration, and even more of\r\nits relevancy, from constant contact with practical decision. But\r\nphysical science still labored under the enormous limitation that the\r\nmen who made decisions had only their commonsense to guide them. They\r\nadministered without scientific aid a world complicated by scientists.\r\nAgain they had to deal with facts they could not apprehend, and as\r\nonce they had to call in engineers, they now have to call in\r\nstatisticians, accountants, experts of all sorts.\r\n\r\nThese practical students are the true pioneers of a new social\r\nscience. They are \"in mesh with the driving wheels\" [Footnote: Cf. The\r\nAddress of the President of the American Philosophical Association,\r\nMr. Ralph Barton Perry, Dec. 28, 1920. Published in the Proceedings of\r\nthe Twentieth Annual Meeting.] and from this practical engagement of\r\nscience and action, both will benefit radically: action by the\r\nclarification of its beliefs; beliefs by a continuing test in action.\r\nWe are in the earliest beginnings. But if it is conceded that all\r\nlarge forms of human association must, because of sheer practical\r\ndifficulty, contain men who will come to see the need for an expert\r\nreporting of their particular environment, then the imagination has a\r\npremise on which to work. In the exchange of technic and result among\r\nexpert staffs, one can see, I think, the beginning of experimental\r\nmethod in social science. When each school district and budget, and\r\nhealth department, and factory, and tariff schedule, is the material\r\nof knowledge for every other, the number of comparable experiences\r\nbegins to approach the dimensions of genuine experiment. In\r\nforty-eight states, and 2400 cities, and 277,000 school houses,\r\n270,000 manufacturing establishments, 27,000 mines and quarries, there\r\nis a wealth of experience, if only it were recorded and available. And\r\nthere is, too, opportunity for trial and error at such slight risk\r\nthat any reasonable hypothesis might be given a fair test without\r\nshaking the foundations of society.\r\n\r\nThe wedge has been driven, not only by some directors of industry and\r\nsome statesmen who had to have help, but by the bureaus of municipal\r\nresearch, [Footnote: The number of these organizations in the United\r\nStates is very great. Some are alive, some half dead. They are in\r\nrapid flux. Lists of them supplied to me by Dr. L. D. Upson of the\r\nDetroit Bureau of Governmental Research, Miss Rebecca B. Rankin of the\r\nMunicipal Reference Library of New York City, Mr. Edward A.\r\nFitzpatrick, Secretary of the State Board of Education (Wisconsin),\r\nMr. Savel Zimand of the Bureau of Industrial Research (New York City),\r\nrun into the hundreds.] the legislative reference libraries, the\r\nspecialized lobbies of corporations and trade unions and public\r\ncauses, and by voluntary organizations like the League of Women\r\nVoters, the Consumers' League, the Manufacturers' Associations: by\r\nhundreds of trade associations, and citizens' unions; by publications\r\nlike the _Searchlight on Congress_ and the _Survey_; and by\r\nfoundations like the General Education Board. Not all by any means are\r\ndisinterested. That is not the point. All of them do begin to\r\ndemonstrate the need for interposing some form of expertness between\r\nthe private citizen and the vast environment in which he is entangled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE WORK\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nTHE practice of democracy has been ahead of its theory. For the theory\r\nholds that the adult electors taken together make decisions out of a\r\nwill that is in them. But just as there grew up governing hierarchies\r\nwhich were invisible in theory, so there has been a large amount of\r\nconstructive adaptation, also unaccounted for in the image of\r\ndemocracy. Ways have been found to represent many interests and\r\nfunctions that are normally out of sight.\r\n\r\nWe are most conscious of this in our theory of the courts, when we\r\nexplain their legislative powers and their vetoes on the theory that\r\nthere are interests to be guarded which might be forgotten by the\r\nelected officials. But the Census Bureau, when it counts, classifies,\r\nand correlates people, things, and changes, is also speaking for\r\nunseen factors in the environment. The Geological Survey makes mineral\r\nresources evident, the Department of Agriculture represents in the\r\ncouncils of the nation factors of which each farmer sees only an\r\ninfinitesimal part. School authorities, the Tariff Commission, the\r\nconsular service, the Bureau of Internal Revenue give representation\r\nto persons, ideas, and objects which would never automatically find\r\nthemselves represented in this perspective by an election. The\r\nChildren's Bureau is the spokesman of a whole complex of interests and\r\nfunctions not ordinarily visible to the voter, and, therefore,\r\nincapable of becoming spontaneously a part of his public opinions.\r\nThus the printing of comparative statistics of infant mortality is\r\noften followed by a reduction of the death rate of babies. Municipal\r\nofficials and voters did not have, before publication, a place in\r\ntheir picture of the environment for those babies. The statistics made\r\nthem visible, as visible as if the babies had elected an alderman to\r\nair their grievances.\r\n\r\nIn the State Department the government maintains a Division of Far\r\nEastern Affairs. What is it for? The Japanese and the Chinese\r\nGovernments both maintain ambassadors in Washington. Are they not\r\nqualified to speak for the Far East? They are its representatives. Yet\r\nnobody would argue that the American Government could learn all that\r\nit needed to know about the Far East by consulting these ambassadors.\r\nSupposing them to be as candid as they know how to be, they are still\r\nlimited channels of information. Therefore, to supplement them we\r\nmaintain embassies in Tokio and Peking, and consular agents at many\r\npoints. Also, I assume, some secret agents. These people are supposed\r\nto send reports which pass through the Division of Far Eastern Affairs\r\nto the Secretary of State. Now what does the Secretary expect of the\r\nDivision? I know one who expected it to spend its appropriation. But\r\nthere are Secretaries to whom special revelation is denied, and they\r\nturn to their divisions for help. The last thing they expect to find\r\nis a neat argument justifying the American position.\r\n\r\nWhat they demand is that the experts shall bring the Far East to the\r\nSecretary's desk, with all the elements in such relation that it is as\r\nif he were in contact with the Far East itself. The expert must\r\ntranslate, simplify, generalize, but the inference from the result\r\nmust apply in the East, not merely on the premises of the report. If\r\nthe Secretary is worth his salt, the very last thing he will tolerate\r\nin his experts is the suspicion that they have a \"policy.\" He does not\r\nwant to know from them whether they like Japanese policy in China. He\r\nwants to know what different classes of Chinese and Japanese, English,\r\nFrenchmen, Germans, and Russians, think about it, and what they are\r\nlikely to do because of what they think. He wants all that represented\r\nto him as the basis of his decision. The more faithfully the Division\r\nrepresents what is not otherwise represented, either by the Japanese\r\nor American ambassadors, or the Senators and Congressmen from the\r\nPacific coast, the better Secretary of State he will be. He may decide\r\nto take his policy from the Pacific Coast, but he will take his view\r\nof Japan from Japan.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIt is no accident that the best diplomatic service in the world is the\r\none in which the divorce between the assembling of knowledge and the\r\ncontrol of policy is most perfect. During the war in many British\r\nEmbassies and in the British Foreign Office there were nearly always\r\nmen, permanent officials or else special appointees, who quite\r\nsuccessfully discounted the prevailing war mind. They discarded the\r\nrigmarole of being pro and con, of having favorite nationalities, and\r\npet aversions, and undelivered perorations in their bosoms. They left\r\nthat to the political chiefs. But in an American Embassy I once heard\r\nan ambassador say that he never reported anything to Washington which\r\nwould not cheer up the folks at home. He charmed all those who met\r\nhim, helped many a stranded war worker, and was superb when he\r\nunveiled a monument.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand that the power of the expert depends upon\r\nseparating himself from those who make the decisions, upon not caring,\r\nin his expert self, what decision is made. The man who, like the\r\nambassador, takes a line, and meddles with the decision, is soon\r\ndiscounted. There he is, just one more on that side of the question.\r\nFor when he begins to care too much, he begins to see what he wishes\r\nto see, and by that fact ceases to see what he is there to see. He is\r\nthere to represent the unseen. He represents people who are not\r\nvoters, functions of voters that are not evident, events that are out\r\nof sight, mute people, unborn people, relations between things and\r\npeople. He has a constituency of intangibles. And intangibles cannot\r\nbe used to form a political majority, because voting is in the last\r\nanalysis a test of strength, a sublimated battle, and the expert\r\nrepresents no strength available in the immediate. But he can exercise\r\nforce by disturbing the line up of the forces. By making the invisible\r\nvisible, he confronts the people who exercise material force with a\r\nnew environment, sets ideas and feelings at work in them, throws them\r\nout of position, and so, in the profoundest way, affects the decision.\r\n\r\nMen cannot long act in a way that they know is a contradiction of the\r\nenvironment as they conceive it. If they are bent on acting in a\r\ncertain way they have to reconceive the environment, they have to\r\ncensor out, to rationalize. But if in their presence, there is an\r\ninsistent fact which is so obtrusive that they cannot explain it away,\r\none of three courses is open. They can perversely ignore it, though\r\nthey will cripple themselves in the process, will overact their part\r\nand come to grief. They can take it into account but refuse to act.\r\nThey pay in internal discomfort and frustration. Or, and I believe\r\nthis to be the most frequent case, they adjust their whole behavior to\r\nthe enlarged environment.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the expert is an ineffectual person because he lets\r\nothers make the decisions is quite contrary to experience. The more\r\nsubtle the elements that enter into the decision, the more\r\nirresponsible power the expert wields. He is certain, moreover, to\r\nexercise more power in the future than ever he did before, because\r\nincreasingly the relevant facts will elude the voter and the\r\nadministrator. All governing agencies will tend to organize bodies of\r\nresearch and information, which will throw out tentacles and expand,\r\nas have the intelligence departments of all the armies in the world.\r\nBut the experts will remain human beings. They will enjoy power, and\r\ntheir temptation will be to appoint themselves censors, and so absorb\r\nthe real function of decision. Unless their function is correctly\r\ndefined they will tend to pass on the facts they think appropriate,\r\nand to pass down the decisions they approve. They will tend, in short,\r\nto become a bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThe only institutional safeguard is to separate as absolutely as it is\r\npossible to do so the staff which executes from the staff which\r\ninvestigates. The two should be parallel but quite distinct bodies of\r\nmen, recruited differently, paid if possible from separate funds,\r\nresponsible to different heads, intrinsically uninterested in each\r\nother's personal success. In industry, the auditors, accountants, and\r\ninspectors should be independent of the manager, the superintendents,\r\nforemen, and in time, I believe, we shall come to see that in order to\r\nbring industry under social control the machinery of record will have\r\nto be independent of the boards of directors and the shareholders.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nBut in building the intelligence sections of industry and politics, we\r\ndo not start on cleared ground. And, apart from insisting on this\r\nbasic separation of function, it would be cumbersome to insist too\r\nprecisely on the form which in any particular instance the principle\r\nshall take. There are men who believe in intelligence work, and will\r\nadopt it; there are men who do not understand it, but cannot do their\r\nwork without it; there are men who will resist. But provided the\r\nprinciple has a foothold somewhere in every social agency it will make\r\nprogress, and the way to begin is to begin. In the federal government,\r\nfor example, it is not necessary to straighten out the administrative\r\ntangle and the illogical duplications of a century's growth in order\r\nto find a neat place for the intelligence bureaus which Washington so\r\nbadly needs. Before election you can promise to rush bravely into the\r\nbreach. But when you arrive there all out of breath, you find that\r\neach absurdity is invested with habits, strong interests, and chummy\r\nCongressmen. Attack all along the line and you engage every force of\r\nreaction. You go forth to battle, as the poet said, and you always\r\nfall. You can lop off an antiquated bureau here, a covey of clerks\r\nthere, you can combine two bureaus. And by that time you are busy with\r\nthe tariff and the railroads, and the era of reform is over. Besides,\r\nin order to effect a truly logical reorganization of the government,\r\nsuch as all candidates always promise, you would have to disturb more\r\npassions than you have time to quell. And any new scheme, supposing\r\nyou had one ready, would require officials to man it. Say what one\r\nwill about officeholders, even Soviet Russia was glad to get many of\r\nthe old ones back; and these old officials, if they are too ruthlessly\r\ntreated, will sabotage Utopia itself.\r\n\r\nNo administrative scheme is workable without good will, and good will\r\nabout strange practices is impossible without education. The better\r\nway is to introduce into the existing machinery, wherever you can find\r\nan opening, agencies that will hold up a mirror week by week, month by\r\nmonth. You can hope, then, to make the machine visible to those who\r\nwork it, as well as to the chiefs who are responsible, and to the\r\npublic outside. When the office-holders begin to see themselves,--or\r\nrather when the outsiders, the chiefs, and the subordinates all begin\r\nto see the same facts, the same damning facts if you like, the\r\nobstruction will diminish. The reformer's opinion that a certain\r\nbureau is inefficient is just his opinion, not so good an opinion in\r\nthe eyes of the bureau, as its own. But let the work of that bureau be\r\nanalysed and recorded, and then compared with other bureaus and with\r\nprivate corporations, and the argument moves to another plane.\r\n\r\nThere are ten departments at Washington represented in the Cabinet.\r\nSuppose, then, there was a permanent intelligence section for each.\r\nWhat would be some of the conditions of effectiveness? Beyond all\r\nothers that the intelligence officials should be independent both of\r\nthe Congressional Committees dealing with that department, and of the\r\nSecretary at the head of it; that they should not be entangled either\r\nin decision or in action. Independence, then, would turn mainly on\r\nthree points on funds, tenure, and access to the facts. For clearly if\r\na particular Congress or departmental official can deprive them of\r\nmoney, dismiss them, or close the files, the staff becomes its\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe question of funds is both important and difficult. No agency of\r\nresearch can be really free if it depends upon annual doles from what\r\nmay be a jealous or a parsimonious congress. Yet the ultimate control\r\nof funds cannot be removed from the legislature. The financial\r\narrangement should insure the staff against left-handed, joker and\r\nrider attack, against sly destruction, and should at the same time\r\nprovide for growth. The staff should be so well entrenched that an\r\nattack on its existence would have to be made in the open. It might,\r\nperhaps, work behind a federal charter creating a trust fund, and a\r\nsliding scale over a period of years based on the appropriation for\r\nthe department to which the intelligence bureau belonged. No great\r\nsums of money are involved anyway. The trust fund might cover the\r\noverhead and capital charges for a certain minimum staff, the sliding\r\nscale might cover the enlargements. At any rate the appropriation\r\nshould be put beyond accident, like the payment of any long term\r\nobligation. This is a much less serious way of \"tying the hands of\r\nCongress\" than is the passage of a Constitutional amendment or the\r\nissuance of government bonds. Congress could repeal the charter. But\r\nit would have to repeal it, not throw monkey wrenches into it.\r\n\r\nTenure should be for life, with provision for retirement on a liberal\r\npension, with sabbatical years set aside for advanced study and\r\ntraining, and with dismissal only after a trial by professional\r\ncolleagues. The conditions which apply to any non-profit-making\r\nintellectual career should apply here. If the work is to be salient,\r\nthe men who do it must have dignity, security, and, in the upper ranks\r\nat least, that freedom of mind which you find only where men are not\r\ntoo immediately concerned in practical decision.\r\n\r\nAccess to the materials should be established in the organic act. The\r\nbureau should have the right to examine all papers, and to question\r\nany official or any outsider. Continuous investigation of this sort\r\nwould not at all resemble the sensational legislative inquiry and the\r\nspasmodic fishing expedition which are now a common feature of our\r\ngovernment. The bureau should have the right to propose accounting\r\nmethods to the department, and if the proposal is rejected, or\r\nviolated after it has been accepted, to appeal under its charter to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance each intelligence bureau would be the connecting\r\nlink between Congress and the Department, a better link, in my\r\njudgment, than the appearance of cabinet officers on the floor of both\r\nHouse and Senate, though the one proposal in no way excludes the\r\nother. The bureau would be the Congressional eye on the execution of\r\nits policy. It would be the departmental answer to Congressional\r\ncriticism. And then, since operation of the Department would be\r\npermanently visible, perhaps Congress would cease to feel the need of\r\nthat minute legislation born of distrust and a false doctrine of the\r\nseparation of powers, which does so much to make efficient\r\nadministration difficult.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nBut, of course, each of the ten bureaus could not work in a watertight\r\ncompartment. In their relation one to another lies the best chance for\r\nthat \"coordination\" of which so much is heard and so little seen.\r\nClearly the various staffs would need to adopt, wherever possible,\r\nstandards of measurement that were comparable. They would exchange\r\ntheir records. Then if the War Department and the Post Office both buy\r\nlumber, hire carpenters, or construct brick walls they need not\r\nnecessarily do them through the same agency, for that might mean\r\ncumbersome over-centralization; but they would be able to use the same\r\nmeasure for the same things, be conscious of the comparisons, and be\r\ntreated as competitors. And the more competition of this sort the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nFor the value of competition is determined by the value of the\r\nstandards used to measure it. Instead, then, of asking ourselves\r\nwhether we believe in competition, we should ask ourselves whether we\r\nbelieve in that for which the competitors compete. No one in his\r\nsenses expects to \"abolish competition,\" for when the last vestige of\r\nemulation had disappeared, social effort would consist in mechanical\r\nobedience to a routine, tempered in a minority by native inspiration.\r\nYet no one expects to work out competition to its logical conclusion\r\nin a murderous struggle of each against all. The problem is to select\r\nthe goals of competition and the rules of the game. Almost always the\r\nmost visible and obvious standard of measurement will determine the\r\nrules of the game: such as money, power, popularity, applause, or Mr.\r\nVeblen's \"conspicuous waste.\" What other standards of measurement does\r\nour civilization normally provide? How does it measure efficiency,\r\nproductivity, service, for which we are always clamoring?\r\n\r\nBy and large there are no measures, and there is, therefore, not so\r\nmuch competition to achieve these ideals. For the difference between\r\nthe higher and the lower motives is not, as men often assert, a\r\ndifference between altruism and selfishness. [Footnote: _Cf._\r\nCh. XII] It is a difference between acting for easily understood aims,\r\nand for aims that are obscure and vague. Exhort a man to make more\r\nprofit than his neighbor, and he knows at what to aim. Exhort him to\r\nrender more social service, and how is he to be certain what service\r\nis social? What is the test, what is the measure? A subjective\r\nfeeling, somebody's opinion. Tell a man in time of peace that he ought\r\nto serve his country and you have uttered a pious platitude, Tell him\r\nin time of war, and the word service has a meaning; it is a number of\r\nconcrete acts, enlistment, or buying bonds, or saving food, or working\r\nfor a dollar a year, and each one of these services he sees definitely\r\nas part of a concrete purpose to put at the front an army larger and\r\nbetter armed, than the enemy's.\r\n\r\nSo the more you are able to analyze administration and work out\r\nelements that can be compared, the more you invent quantitative\r\nmeasures for the qualities you wish to promote, the more you can turn\r\ncompetition to ideal ends. If you can contrive the right index numbers\r\n[Footnote: I am not using the term index numbers in its purely\r\ntechnical meaning, but to cover any device for the comparative\r\nmeasurement of social phenomena.] you can set up a competition between\r\nindividual workers in a shop; between shops; between factories;\r\nbetween schools; [Footnote: See, for example, _An Index Number for\r\nState School Systems_ by Leonard P. Ayres, Russell Sage Foundation,\r\n1920. The principle of the quota was very successfully applied in the\r\nLiberty Loan Campaigns, and under very much more difficult\r\ncircumstances by the Allied Maritime Transport Council.] between\r\ngovernment departments; between regiments; between divisions; between\r\nships; between states; counties; cities; and the better your index\r\nnumbers the more useful the competition.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe possibilities that lie in the exchange of material are evident.\r\nEach department of government is all the time asking for information\r\nthat may already have been obtained by another department, though\r\nperhaps in a somewhat different form. The State Department needs to\r\nknow, let us say, the extent of the Mexican oil reserves, their\r\nrelation to the rest of the world's supply, the present ownership of\r\nMexican oil lands, the importance of oil to warships now under\r\nconstruction or planned, the comparative costs in different fields.\r\nHow does it secure such information to-day? The information is\r\nprobably scattered through the Departments of Interior, Justice,\r\nCommerce, Labor and Navy. Either a clerk in the State Department looks\r\nup Mexican oil in a book of reference, which may or may not be\r\naccurate, or somebody's private secretary telephones somebody else's\r\nprivate secretary, asks for a memorandum, and in the course of time a\r\ndarkey messenger arrives with an armful of unintelligible reports. The\r\nDepartment should be able to call on its own intelligence bureau to\r\nassemble the facts in a way suited to the diplomatic problem up for\r\ndecision. And these facts the diplomatic intelligence bureau would\r\nobtain from the central clearing house. [Footnote: There has been a\r\nvast development of such services among the trade associations. The\r\npossibilities of a perverted use were revealed by the New York\r\nBuilding Trades investigation of 1921.]\r\n\r\nThis establishment would pretty soon become a focus of information of\r\nthe most extraordinary kind. And the men in it would be made aware of\r\nwhat the problems of government really are. They would deal with\r\nproblems of definition, of terminology, of statistical technic, of\r\nlogic; they would traverse concretely the whole gamut of the social\r\nsciences. It is difficult to see why all this material, except a few\r\ndiplomatic and military secrets, should not be open to the scholars of\r\nthe country. It is there that the political scientist would find the\r\nreal nuts to crack and the real researches for his students to make.\r\nThe work need not all be done in Washington, but it could be done in\r\nreference to Washington. The central agency would, thus, have in it\r\nthe makings of a national university. The staff could be recruited\r\nthere for the bureaus from among college graduates. They would be\r\nworking on theses selected after consultation between the curators of\r\nthe national university and teachers scattered over the country. If\r\nthe association was as flexible as it ought to be, there would be, as\r\na supplement to the permanent staff, a steady turnover of temporary\r\nand specialist appointments from the universities, and exchange\r\nlecturers called out from Washington. Thus the training and the\r\nrecruiting of the staff would go together. A part of the research\r\nitself would be done by students, and political science in the\r\nuniversities would be associated with politics in America.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nIn its main outlines the principle is equally applicable to state\r\ngovernments, to cities, and to rural counties. The work of comparison\r\nand interchange could take place by federations of state and city and\r\ncounty bureaus. And within those federations any desirable regional\r\ncombination could be organized. So long as the accounting systems were\r\ncomparable, a great deal of duplication would be avoided. Regional\r\ncoordination is especially desirable. For legal frontiers often do not\r\ncoincide with the effective environments. Yet they have a certain\r\nbasis in custom that it would be costly to disturb. By coordinating\r\ntheir information several administrative areas could reconcile\r\nautonomy of decision with cooperation. New York City, for example, is\r\nalready an unwieldy unit for good government from the City Hall. Yet\r\nfor many purposes, such as health and transportation, the metropolitan\r\ndistrict is the true unit of administration. In that district,\r\nhowever, there are large cities, like Yonkers, Jersey City, Paterson,\r\nElizabeth, Hoboken, Bayonne. They could not all be managed from one\r\ncenter, and yet they should act together for many functions.\r\nUltimately perhaps some such flexible scheme of local government as\r\nSidney and Beatrice Webb have suggested may be the proper\r\nsolution. [Footnote: \"The Reorganization of Local Government\" (Ch. IV),\r\nin _A Constitution for the Socialist Commonwealth of Great\r\nBritain_.] But the first step would be a coordination, not of\r\ndecision and action, but of information and research. Let the\r\nofficials of the various municipalities see their common problems in\r\nthe light of the same facts.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to deny that such a net work of intelligence bureaus\r\nin politics and industry might become a dead weight and a perpetual\r\nirritation. One can easily imagine its attraction for men in search of\r\nsoft jobs, for pedants, for meddlers. One can see red tape, mountains\r\nof papers, questionnaires ad nauseam, seven copies of every document,\r\nendorsements, delays, lost papers, the use of form 136 instead of form\r\n2gb, the return of the document because pencil was used instead of\r\nink, or black ink instead of red ink. The work could be done very\r\nbadly. There are no fool-proof institutions.\r\n\r\nBut if one could assume that there was circulation through the whole\r\nsystem between government departments, factories, offices, and the\r\nuniversities; a circulation of men, a circulation of data and of\r\ncriticism, the risks of dry rot would not be so great. Nor would it be\r\ntrue to say that these intelligence bureaus will complicate life. They\r\nwill tend, on the contrary, to simplify, by revealing a complexity now\r\nso great as to be humanly unmanageable. The present fundamentally\r\ninvisible system of government is so intricate that most people have\r\ngiven up trying to follow it, and because they do not try, they are\r\ntempted to think it comparatively simple. It is, on the contrary,\r\nelusive, concealed, opaque. The employment of an intelligence system\r\nwould mean a reduction of personnel per unit of result, because by\r\nmaking available to all the experience of each, it would reduce the\r\namount of trial and error; and because by making the social process\r\nvisible, it would assist the personnel to self-criticism. It does not\r\ninvolve a great additional band of officials, if you take into account\r\nthe time now spent vainly by special investigating committees, grand\r\njuries, district attorneys, reform organizations, and bewildered\r\noffice holders, in trying to find their way through a dark muddle.\r\n\r\nIf the analysis of public opinion and of the democratic theories in\r\nrelation to the modern environment is sound in principle, then I do\r\nnot see how one can escape the conclusion that such intelligence work\r\nis the clue to betterment. I am not referring to the few suggestions\r\ncontained in this chapter. They are merely illustrations. The task of\r\nworking out the technic is in the hands of men trained to do it, and\r\nnot even they can to-day completely foresee the form, much less the\r\ndetails. The number of social phenomena which are now recorded is\r\nsmall, the instruments of analysis are very crude, the concepts often\r\nvague and uncriticized. But enough has been done to demonstrate, I\r\nthink, that unseen environments can be reported effectively, that they\r\ncan be reported to divergent groups of people in a way which is\r\nneutral to their prejudice, and capable of overcoming their\r\nsubjectivism.\r\n\r\nIf that is true, then in working out the intelligence principle men\r\nwill find the way to overcome the central difficulty of\r\nself-government, the difficulty of dealing with an unseen reality.\r\nBecause of that difficulty, it has been impossible for any\r\nself-governing community to reconcile its need for isolation with the\r\nnecessity for wide contact, to reconcile the dignity and individuality\r\nof local decision with security and wide coordination, to secure\r\neffective leaders without sacrificing responsibility, to have useful\r\npublic opinions without attempting universal public opinions on all\r\nsubjects. As long as there was no way of establishing common versions\r\nof unseen events, common measures for separate actions, the only image\r\nof democracy that would work, even in theory, was one based on an\r\nisolated community of people whose political faculties were limited,\r\naccording to Aristotle's famous maxim, by the range of their vision.\r\n\r\nBut now there is a way out, a long one to be sure, but a way. It is\r\nfundamentally the same way as that which has enabled a citizen of\r\nChicago, with no better eyes or ears than an Athenian, to see and hear\r\nover great distances. It is possible to-day, it will become more\r\npossible when more labor has gone into it, to reduce the discrepancies\r\nbetween the conceived environment and the effective environment. As\r\nthat is done, federalism will work more and more by consent, less and\r\nless by coercion. For while federalism is the only possible method of\r\nunion among self-governing groups, [Footnote: _Cf._ H. J. Laski,\r\n_The Foundations of Sovereignty_, and other Essays, particularly\r\nthe Essay of this name, as well as the Problems of Administrative\r\nAreas, The Theory of Popular Sovereignty, and The Pluralistic State.]\r\nfederalism swings either towards imperial centralization or towards\r\nparochial anarchy wherever the union is not based on correct and\r\ncommonly accepted ideas of federal matters. These ideas do not arise\r\nspontaneously. They have to be pieced together by generalization based\r\non analysis, and the instruments for that analysis have to be invented\r\nand tested by research.\r\n\r\nNo electoral device, no manipulation of areas, no change in the system\r\nof property, goes to the root of the matter. You cannot take more\r\npolitical wisdom out of human beings than there is in them. And no\r\nreform, however sensational, is truly radical, which does not\r\nconsciously provide a way of overcoming the subjectivism of human\r\nopinion based on the limitation of individual experience. There are\r\nsystems of government, of voting, and representation which extract\r\nmore than others. But in the end knowledge must come not from the\r\nconscience but from the environment with which that conscience deals.\r\nWhen men act on the principle of intelligence they go out to find the\r\nfacts and to make their wisdom. When they ignore it, they go inside\r\nthemselves and find only what is there. They elaborate their\r\nprejudice, instead of increasing their knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIN real life no one acts on the theory that he can have a public\r\nopinion on every public question, though this fact is often concealed\r\nwhere a person thinks there is no public question because he has no\r\npublic opinion. But in the theory of our politics we continue to think\r\nmore literally than Lord Bryce intended, that \"the action of Opinion\r\nis continuous,\" [Footnote: _Modern Democracies_, Vol. I, p. 159.]\r\neven though \"its action... deals with broad principles only.\"\r\n[Footnote: Id., footnote, p. 158.] And then because we try to think of\r\nourselves having continuous opinions, without being altogether certain\r\nwhat a broad principle is, we quite naturally greet with an anguished\r\nyawn an argument that seems to involve the reading of more government\r\nreports, more statistics, more curves and more graphs. For all these\r\nare in the first instance just as confusing as partisan rhetoric, and\r\nmuch less entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe amount of attention available is far too small for any scheme in\r\nwhich it was assumed that all the citizens of the nation would, after\r\ndevoting themselves to the publications of all the intelligence\r\nbureaus, become alert, informed, and eager on the multitude of real\r\nquestions that never do fit very well into any broad principle. I am\r\nnot making that assumption. Primarily, the intelligence bureau is an\r\ninstrument of the man of action, of the representative charged with\r\ndecision, of the worker at his work, and if it does not help them, it\r\nwill help nobody in the end. But in so far as it helps them to\r\nunderstand the environment in which they are working, it makes what\r\nthey do visible. And by that much they become more responsible to the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\nThe purpose, then, is not to burden every citizen with expert opinions\r\non all questions, but to push that burden away from him towards the\r\nresponsible administrator. An intelligence system has value, of\r\ncourse, as a source of general information, and as a check on the\r\ndaily press. But that is secondary. Its real use is as an aid to\r\nrepresentative government and administration both in politics and\r\nindustry. The demand for the assistance of expert reporters in the\r\nshape of accountants, statisticians, secretariats, and the like, comes\r\nnot from the public, but from men doing public business, who can no\r\nlonger do it by rule of thumb. It is in origin and in ideal an\r\ninstrument for doing public business better, rather than an instrument\r\nfor knowing better how badly public business is done.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nAs a private citizen, as a sovereign voter, no one could attempt to\r\ndigest these documents. But as one party to a dispute, as a\r\ncommitteeman in a legislature, as an officer in government, business,\r\nor a trade union, as a member of an industrial council, reports on the\r\nspecific matter at issue will be increasingly welcome. The private\r\ncitizen interested in some cause would belong, as he does now, to\r\nvoluntary societies which employed a staff to study the documents, and\r\nmake reports that served as a check on officialdom. There would be\r\nsome study of this material by newspaper men, and a good deal by\r\nexperts and by political scientists. But the outsider, and every one\r\nof us is an outsider to all but a few aspects of modern life, has\r\nneither time, nor attention, nor interest, nor the equipment for\r\nspecific judgment. It is on the men inside, working under conditions\r\nthat are sound, that the daily administrations of society must rest.\r\n\r\nThe general public outside can arrive at judgments about whether these\r\nconditions are sound only on the result after the event, and on the\r\nprocedure before the event. The broad principles on which the action\r\nof public opinion can be continuous are essentially principles of\r\nprocedure. The outsider can ask experts to tell him whether the\r\nrelevant facts were duly considered; he cannot in most cases decide\r\nfor himself what is relevant or what is due consideration. The\r\noutsider can perhaps judge whether the groups interested in the\r\ndecision were properly heard, whether the ballot, if there was one,\r\nwas honestly taken, and perhaps whether the result was honestly\r\naccepted. He can watch the procedure when the news indicates that\r\nthere is something to watch. He can raise a question as to whether the\r\nprocedure itself is right, if its normal results conflict with his\r\nideal of a good life. [Footnote: _Cf._ Chapter XX. ] But if he\r\ntries in every case to substitute himself for the procedure, to bring\r\nin Public Opinion like a providential uncle in the crisis of a play,\r\nhe will confound his own confusion. He will not follow any train of\r\nthought consecutively.\r\n\r\nFor the practice of appealing to the public on all sorts of intricate\r\nmatters means almost always a desire to escape criticism from those\r\nwho know by enlisting a large majority which has had no chance to\r\nknow. The verdict is made to depend on who has the loudest or the most\r\nentrancing voice, the most skilful or the most brazen publicity man,\r\nthe best access to the most space in the newspapers. For even when the\r\neditor is scrupulously fair to \"the other side,\" fairness is not\r\nenough. There may be several other sides, unmentioned by any of the\r\norganized, financed and active partisans.\r\n\r\nThe private citizen, beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his\r\nPublic Opinion, will soon see, perhaps, that these appeals are not a\r\ncompliment to his intelligence, but an imposition on his good nature\r\nand an insult to his sense of evidence. As his civic education takes\r\naccount of the complexity of his environment, he will concern himself\r\nabout the equity and the sanity of procedure, and even this he will in\r\nmost cases expect his elected representative to watch for him. He will\r\nrefuse himself to accept the burden of these decisions, and will turn\r\ndown his thumbs in most cases on those who, in their hurry to win,\r\nrush from the conference table with the first dope for the reporters.\r\n\r\nOnly by insisting that problems shall not come up to him until they\r\nhave passed through a procedure, can the busy citizen of a modern\r\nstate hope to deal with them in a form that is intelligible. For\r\nissues, as they are stated by a partisan, almost always consist of an\r\nintricate series of facts, as he has observed them, surrounded by a\r\nlarge fatty mass of stereotyped phrases charged with his emotion.\r\nAccording to the fashion of the day, he will emerge from the\r\nconference room insisting that what he wants is some soulfilling idea\r\nlike Justice, Welfare, Americanism, Socialism. On such issues the\r\ncitizen outside can sometimes be provoked to fear or admiration, but\r\nto judgment never. Before he can do anything with the argument, the\r\nfat has to be boiled out of it for him.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThat can be done by having the representative inside carry on\r\ndiscussion in the presence of some one, chairman or mediator, who\r\nforces the discussion to deal with the analyses supplied by experts.\r\nThis is the essential organization of any representative body dealing\r\nwith distant matters. The partisan voices should be there, but the\r\npartisans should find themselves confronted with men, not personally\r\ninvolved, who control enough facts and have the dialectical skill to\r\nsort out what is real perception from what is stereotype, pattern and\r\nelaboration. It is the Socratic dialogue, with all of Socrates's\r\nenergy for breaking through words to meanings, and something more than\r\nthat, because the dialectic in modern life must be done by men who\r\nhave explored the environment as well as the human mind.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, a grave dispute in the steel industry. Each\r\nside issues a manifesto full of the highest ideals. The only public\r\nopinion that is worth respect at this stage is the opinion which\r\ninsists that a conference be organized. For the side which says its\r\ncause is too just to be contaminated by conference there can be little\r\nsympathy, since there is no such cause anywhere among mortal men.\r\nPerhaps those who object to conference do not say quite that. Perhaps\r\nthey say that the other side is too wicked; they cannot shake hands\r\nwith traitors. All that public opinion can do then is to organize a\r\nhearing by public officials to hear the proof of wickedness. It cannot\r\ntake the partisans' word for it. But suppose a conference is agreed\r\nto, and suppose there is a neutral chairman who has at his beck and\r\ncall the consulting experts of the corporation, the union, and, let us\r\nsay, the Department of Labor.\r\n\r\nJudge Gary states with perfect sincerity that his men are well paid\r\nand not overworked, and then proceeds to sketch the history of Russia\r\nfrom the time of Peter the Great to the murder of the Czar. Mr. Foster\r\nrises, states with equal sincerity that the men are exploited, and\r\nthen proceeds to outline the history of human emancipation from Jesus\r\nof Nazareth to Abraham Lincoln. At this point the chairman calls upon\r\nthe intelligence men for wage tables in order to substitute for the\r\nwords \"well paid\" and \"exploited\" a table showing what the different\r\nclasses _are_ paid. Does Judge Gary think they are all well paid?\r\nHe does. Does Mr. Foster think they are all exploited? No, he thinks\r\nthat groups C, M, and X are exploited. What does he mean by exploited?\r\nHe means they are not paid a living wage. They are, says Judge Gary.\r\nWhat can a man buy on that wage, asks the chairman. Nothing, says Mr.\r\nFoster. Everything he needs, says Judge Gary. The chairman consults\r\nthe budgets and price statistics of the government. [Footnote: See an\r\narticle on \"The Cost of Living and Wage Cuts,\" in the _New\r\nRepublic_, July 27, 1921, by Dr. Leo Wolman, for a brilliant\r\ndiscussion of the naive use of such figures and \"pseudo-principles.\"\r\nThe warning is of particular importance because it comes from an\r\neconomist and statistician who has himself done so much to improve the\r\ntechnic of industrial disputes.] He rules that X can meet an average\r\nbudget, but that C and M cannot. Judge Gary serves notice that he does\r\nnot regard the official statistics as sound. The budgets are too high,\r\nand prices have come down. Mr. Foster also serves notice of exception.\r\nThe budget is too low, prices have gone up. The chairman rules that\r\nthis point is not within the jurisdiction of the conference, that the\r\nofficial figures stand, and that Judge Gary's experts and Mr. Foster's\r\nshould carry their appeals to the standing committee of the federated\r\nintelligence bureaus.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, says Judge Gary, we shall be ruined if we change these\r\nwage scales. What do you mean by ruined, asks the chairman, produce\r\nyour books. I can't, they are private, says Judge Gary. What is\r\nprivate does not interest us, says the chairman, and, therefore,\r\nissues a statement to the public announcing that the wages of workers\r\nin groups C and M are so-and-so much below the official minimum living\r\nwage, and that Judge Gary declines to increase them for reasons that\r\nhe refuses to state. After a procedure of that sort, a public opinion\r\nin the eulogistic sense of the term [Footnote: As used by Mr. Lowell\r\nin his _Public Opinion and Popular Government_.] can exist.\r\n\r\nThe value of expert mediation is not that it sets up opinion to coerce\r\nthe partisans, but that it disintegrates partisanship. Judge Gary and\r\nMr. Foster may remain as little convinced as when they started, though\r\neven they would have to talk in a different strain. But almost\r\neveryone else who was not personally entangled would save himself from\r\nbeing entangled. For the entangling stereotypes and slogans to which\r\nhis reflexes are so ready to respond are by this kind of dialectic\r\nuntangled.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nOn many subjects of great public importance, and in varying degree\r\namong different people for more personal matters, the threads of\r\nmemory and emotion are in a snarl. The same word will connote any\r\nnumber of different ideas: emotions are displaced from the images to\r\nwhich they belong to names which resemble the names of these images.\r\nIn the uncriticized parts of the mind there is a vast amount of\r\nassociation by mere clang, contact, and succession. There are stray\r\nemotional attachments, there are words that were names and are masks.\r\nIn dreams, reveries, and panic, we uncover some of the disorder,\r\nenough to see how the naive mind is composed, and how it behaves when\r\nnot disciplined by wakeful effort and external resistance. We see that\r\nthere is no more natural order than in a dusty old attic. There is\r\noften the same incongruity between fact, idea, and emotion as there\r\nmight be in an opera house, if all the wardrobes were dumped in a heap\r\nand all the scores mixed up, so that Madame Butterfly in a Valkyr's\r\ndress waited lyrically for the return of Faust. \"At Christmas-tide\"\r\nsays an editorial, \"old memories soften the heart. Holy teachings are\r\nremembered afresh as thoughts run back to childhood. The world does\r\nnot seem so bad when seen through the mist of half-happy, half-sad\r\nrecollections of loved ones now with God. No heart is untouched by the\r\nmysterious influence.... The country is honeycombed with red\r\npropaganda--but there is a good supply of ropes, muscles and\r\nlampposts... while this world moves the spirit of liberty will burn in\r\nthe breast of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who found these phrases in his mind needs help. He needs a\r\nSocrates who will separate the words, cross-examine him until he has\r\ndefined them, and made words the names of ideas. Made them mean a\r\nparticular object and nothing else. For these tense syllables have got\r\nthemselves connected in his mind by primitive association, and are\r\nbundled together by his memories of Christmas, his indignation as a\r\nconservative, and his thrills as the heir to a revolutionary\r\ntradition. Sometimes the snarl is too huge and ancient for quick\r\nunravelling. Sometimes, as in modern psychotherapy, there are layers\r\nupon layers of memory reaching back to infancy, which have to be\r\nseparated and named.\r\n\r\nThe effect of naming, the effect, that is, of saying that the labor\r\ngroups C and M, but not X, are underpaid, instead of saying that Labor\r\nis Exploited, is incisive. Perceptions recover their identity, and the\r\nemotion they arouse is specific, since it is no longer reinforced by\r\nlarge and accidental connections with everything from Christmas to\r\nMoscow. The disentangled idea with a name of its own, and an emotion\r\nthat has been scrutinized, is ever so much more open to correction by\r\nnew data in the problem. It had been imbedded in the whole\r\npersonality, had affiliations of some sort with the whole ego: a\r\nchallenge would reverberate through the whole soul. After it has been\r\nthoroughly criticized, the idea is no longer _me_ but _that_.\r\nIt is objectified, it is at arm's length. Its fate is not bound up with my\r\nfate, but with the fate of the outer world upon which I am acting.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nRe-education of this kind will help to bring our public opinions into\r\ngrip with the environment. That is the way the enormous censoring,\r\nstereotyping, and dramatizing apparatus can be liquidated. Where there\r\nis no difficulty in knowing what the relevant environment is, the\r\ncritic, the teacher, the physician, can unravel the mind. But where\r\nthe environment is as obscure to the analyst as to his pupil, no\r\nanalytic technic is sufficient. Intelligence work is required. In\r\npolitical and industrial problems the critic as such can do something,\r\nbut unless he can count upon receiving from expert reporters a valid\r\npicture of the environment, his dialectic cannot go far.\r\n\r\nTherefore, though here, as in most other matters, \"education\" is the\r\nsupreme remedy, the value of this education will depend upon the\r\nevolution of knowledge. And our knowledge of human institutions is\r\nstill extraordinarily meager and impressionistic. The gathering of\r\nsocial knowledge is, on the whole, still haphazard; not, as it will\r\nhave to become, the normal accompaniment of action. And yet the\r\ncollection of information will not be made, one may be sure, for the\r\nsake of its ultimate use. It will be made because modern decision\r\nrequires it to be made. But as it is being made, there will accumulate\r\na body of data which political science can turn into generalization,\r\nand build up for the schools into a conceptual picture of the world.\r\nWhen that picture takes form, civic education can become a preparation\r\nfor dealing with an unseen environment.\r\n\r\nAs a working model of the social system becomes available to the\r\nteacher, he can use it to make the pupil acutely aware of how his mind\r\nworks on unfamiliar facts. Until he has such a model, the teacher\r\ncannot hope to prepare men fully for the world they will find. What he\r\ncan do is to prepare them to deal with that world with a great deal\r\nmore sophistication about their own minds. He can, by the use of the\r\ncase method, teach the pupil the habit of examining the sources of his\r\ninformation. He can teach him, for example, to look in his newspaper\r\nfor the place where the dispatch was filed, for the name of the\r\ncorrespondent, the name of the press service, the authority given for\r\nthe statement, the circumstances under which the statement was\r\nsecured. He can teach the pupil to ask himself whether the reporter\r\nsaw what he describes, and to remember how that reporter described\r\nother events in the past. He can teach him the character of\r\ncensorship, of the idea of privacy, and furnish him with knowledge of\r\npast propaganda. He can, by the proper use of history, make him aware\r\nof the stereotype, and can educate a habit of introspection about the\r\nimagery evoked by printed words. He can, by courses in comparative\r\nhistory and anthropology, produce a life-long realization of the way\r\ncodes impose a special pattern upon the imagination. He can teach men\r\nto catch themselves making allegories, dramatizing relations, and\r\npersonifying abstractions. He can show the pupil how he identifies\r\nhimself with these allegories, how he becomes interested, and how he\r\nselects the attitude, heroic, romantic, economic which he adopts while\r\nholding a particular opinion. The study of error is not only in the\r\nhighest degree prophylactic, but it serves as a stimulating\r\nintroduction to the study of truth. As our minds become more deeply\r\naware of their own subjectivism, we find a zest in objective method\r\nthat is not otherwise there. We see vividly, as normally we should\r\nnot, the enormous mischief and casual cruelty of our prejudices. And\r\nthe destruction of a prejudice, though painful at first, because of\r\nits connection with our self-respect, gives an immense relief and a\r\nfine pride when it is successfully done. There is a radical\r\nenlargement of the range of attention. As the current categories\r\ndissolve, a hard, simple version of the world breaks up. The scene\r\nturns vivid and full. There follows an emotional incentive to hearty\r\nappreciation of scientific method, which otherwise it is not easy to\r\narouse, and is impossible to sustain. Prejudices are so much easier\r\nand more interesting. For if you teach the principles of science as if\r\nthey had always been accepted, their chief virtue as a discipline,\r\nwhich is objectivity, will make them dull. But teach them at first as\r\nvictories over the superstitions of the mind, and the exhilaration of\r\nthe chase and of the conquest may carry the pupil over that hard\r\ntransition from his own self-bound experience to the phase where his\r\ncuriosity has matured, and his reason has acquired passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE APPEAL TO REASON\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nI HAVE written, and then thrown away, several endings to this book.\r\nOver all of them there hung that fatality of last chapters, in which\r\nevery idea seems to find its place, and all the mysteries, that the\r\nwriter has not forgotten, are unravelled. In politics the hero does\r\nnot live happily ever after, or end his life perfectly. There is no\r\nconcluding chapter, because the hero in politics has more future\r\nbefore him than there is recorded history behind him. The last chapter\r\nis merely a place where the writer imagines that the polite reader has\r\nbegun to look furtively at his watch.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhen Plato came to the point where it was fitting that he should sum\r\nup, his assurance turned into stage-fright as he thought how absurd it\r\nwould sound to say what was in him about the place of reason in\r\npolitics. Those sentences in book five of the Republic were hard even\r\nfor Plato to speak; they are so sheer and so stark that men can\r\nneither forget them nor live by them. So he makes Socrates say to\r\nGlaucon that he will be broken and drowned in laughter for telling\r\n\"what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the\r\ntruer form,\" [Footnote: _Republic_, Bk. V, 473. Jowett transl.]\r\nbecause the thought he \"would fain have uttered if it had not seemed\r\ntoo extravagant\" was that \"until philosophers are kings, or the kings\r\nand princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and\r\npolitical greatness and wisdom meet in one... cities will never cease\r\nfrom ill,--no, nor the human race...\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he said these awful words, when he realized they were a\r\ncounsel of perfection, and felt embarrassed at the unapproachable\r\ngrandeur of his idea. So he hastens to add that, of course, \"the true\r\npilot\" will be called \"a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing.\"\r\n[Footnote: 2 Bk. VI, 488-489.] But this wistful admission, though it\r\nprotects him against whatever was the Greek equivalent for the charge\r\nthat he lacked a sense of humor, furnished a humiliating tailpiece to\r\na solemn thought. He becomes defiant and warns Adeimantus that he must\r\n\"attribute the uselessness\" of philosophers \"to the fault of those who\r\nwill not use them, and not to themselves. The pilot should not humbly\r\nbeg the sailors to be commanded by him--that is not the order of\r\nnature.\" And with this haughty gesture, he hurriedly picked up the\r\ntools of reason, and disappeared into the Academy, leaving the world\r\nto Machiavelli.\r\n\r\nThus, in the first great encounter between reason and politics, the\r\nstrategy of reason was to retire in anger. But meanwhile, as Plato\r\ntells us, the ship is at sea. There have been many ships on the sea,\r\nsince Plato wrote, and to-day, whether we are wise or foolish in our\r\nbelief, we could no longer call a man a true pilot, simply because he\r\nknows how to \"pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars\r\nand winds, and whatever else belongs to his art.\" [Footnote: Bk. VI,\r\n488-489.] He can dismiss nothing which is necessary to make that ship\r\nsail prosperously. Because there are mutineers aboard, he cannot say:\r\nso much the worse for us all... it is not in the order of nature that\r\nI should handle a mutiny... it is not in the order of philosophy that\r\nI should consider mutiny... I know how to navigate... I do not know\r\nhow to navigate a ship full of sailors... and if they do not see that\r\nI am the man to steer, I cannot help it. We shall all go on the rocks,\r\nthey to be punished for their sins; I, with the assurance that I knew\r\nbetter....\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhenever we make an appeal to reason in politics, the difficulty in\r\nthis parable recurs. For there is an inherent difficulty about using\r\nthe method of reason to deal with an unreasoning world. Even if you\r\nassume with Plato that the true pilot knows what is best for the ship,\r\nyou have to recall that he is not so easy to recognize, and that this\r\nuncertainty leaves a large part of the crew unconvinced. By definition\r\nthe crew does not know what he knows, and the pilot, fascinated by the\r\nstars and winds, does not know how to make the crew realize the\r\nimportance of what he knows. There is no time during mutiny at sea to\r\nmake each sailor an expert judge of experts. There is no time for the\r\npilot to consult his crew and find out whether he is really as wise as\r\nhe thinks he is. For education is a matter of years, the emergency a\r\nmatter of hours. It would be altogether academic, then, to tell the\r\npilot that the true remedy is, for example, an education that will\r\nendow sailors with a better sense of evidence. You can tell that only\r\nto shipmasters on dry land. In the crisis, the only advice is to use a\r\ngun, or make a speech, utter a stirring slogan, offer a compromise,\r\nemploy any quick means available to quell the mutiny, the sense of\r\nevidence being what it is. It is only on shore where men plan for many\r\nvoyages, that they can afford to, and must for their own salvation,\r\ndeal with those causes that take a long time to remove. They will be\r\ndealing in years and generations, not in emergencies alone. And\r\nnothing will put a greater strain upon their wisdom than the necessity\r\nof distinguishing false crises from real ones. For when there is panic\r\nin the air, with one crisis tripping over the heels of another, actual\r\ndangers mixed with imaginary scares, there is no chance at all for the\r\nconstructive use of reason, and any order soon seems preferable to any\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nIt is only on the premise of a certain stability over a long run of\r\ntime that men can hope to follow the method of reason. This is not\r\nbecause mankind is inept, or because the appeal to reason is\r\nvisionary, but because the evolution of reason on political subjects\r\nis only in its beginnings. Our rational ideas in politics are still\r\nlarge, thin generalities, much too abstract and unrefined for\r\npractical guidance, except where the aggregates are large enough to\r\ncancel out individual peculiarity and exhibit large uniformities.\r\nReason in politics is especially immature in predicting the behavior\r\nof individual men, because in human conduct the smallest initial\r\nvariation often works out into the most elaborate differences. That,\r\nperhaps, is why when we try to insist solely upon an appeal to reason\r\nin dealing with sudden situations, we are broken and drowned in\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nFor the rate at which reason, as we possess it, can advance itself is\r\nslower than the rate at which action has to be taken. In the present\r\nstate of political science there is, therefore, a tendency for one\r\nsituation to change into another, before the first is clearly understood,\r\nand so to make much political criticism hindsight and little else. Both in\r\nthe discovery of what is unknown, and in the propagation of that which\r\nhas been proved, there is a time-differential,  which ought to, in a much\r\ngreater degree than it ever has, occupy the political philosopher. We\r\nhave begun, chiefly under the inspiration of Mr. Graham Wallas, to\r\nexamine the effect of an invisible environment upon our opinions.\r\nWe do not, as yet, understand, except a little by rule of thumb, the\r\nelement of time in politics, though it bears most directly upon the\r\npracticability of any constructive proposal. [Footnote: _Cf_. H. G.\r\nWells in the opening chapters of _Mankind in the Making._] We\r\ncan see, for example, that somehow the relevancy of any plan depends\r\nupon the length of time the operation requires. Because on the length\r\nof time it will depend whether the data which the plan assumes as\r\ngiven, will in truth remain the same. [Footnote: The better the\r\ncurrent analysis in the intelligence work of any institution, the less\r\nlikely, of course, that men will deal with tomorrow's problems in the\r\nlight of yesterday's facts.] There is a factor here which realistic\r\nand experienced men do take into account, and it helps to mark\r\nthem off somehow from the opportunist, the visionary, the philistine\r\nand the pedant. [Footnote: Not all, but some of the differences\r\nbetween reactionaries, conservatives, liberals, and radicals are\r\ndue, I think, to a different intuitive estimate of the rate of change\r\nin social affairs.] But just how the calculation of time enters into\r\npolitics we do not know at present in any systematic way.\r\n\r\nUntil we understand these matters more clearly, we can at least\r\nremember that there is a problem of the utmost theoretical difficulty\r\nand practical consequence. It will help us to cherish Plato's ideal,\r\nwithout sharing his hasty conclusion about the perversity of those who\r\ndo not listen to reason. It is hard to obey reason in politics,\r\nbecause you are trying to make two processes march together, which\r\nhave as yet a different gait and a different pace. Until reason is\r\nsubtle and particular, the immediate struggle of politics will\r\ncontinue to require an amount of native wit, force, and unprovable\r\nfaith, that reason can neither provide nor control, because the facts\r\nof life are too undifferentiated for its powers of understanding. The\r\nmethods of social science are so little perfected that in many of the\r\nserious decisions and most of the casual ones, there is as yet no\r\nchoice but to gamble with fate as intuition prompts.\r\n\r\nBut we can make a belief in reason one of those intuitions. We can use\r\nour wit and our force to make footholds for reason. Behind our\r\npictures of the world, we can try to see the vista of a longer\r\nduration of events, and wherever it is possible to escape from the\r\nurgent present, allow this longer time to control our decisions. And\r\nyet, even when there is this will to let the future count, we find\r\nagain and again that we do not know for certain how to act according\r\nto the dictates of reason. The number of human problems on which\r\nreason is prepared to dictate is small.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a noble counterfeit in that charity which comes\r\nfrom self-knowledge and an unarguable belief that no one of our\r\ngregarious species is alone in his longing for a friendlier world. So\r\nmany of the grimaces men make at each other go with a flutter of their\r\npulse, that they are not all of them important. And where so much is\r\nuncertain, where so many actions have to be carried out on guesses,\r\nthe demand upon the reserves of mere decency is enormous, and it is\r\nnecessary to live as if good will would work. We cannot prove in every\r\ninstance that it will, nor why hatred, intolerance, suspicion,\r\nbigotry, secrecy, fear, and lying are the seven deadly sins against\r\npublic opinion. We can only insist that they have no place in the\r\nappeal to reason, that in the longer run they are a poison; and taking\r\nour stand upon a view of the world which outlasts our own\r\npredicaments, and our own lives, we can cherish a hearty prejudice\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nWe can do this all the better if we do not allow frightfulness and\r\nfanaticism to impress us so deeply that we throw up our hands\r\npeevishly, and lose interest in the longer run of time because we have\r\nlost faith in the future of man. There is no ground for this despair,\r\nbecause all the _ifs_ on which, as James said, our destiny hangs,\r\nare as pregnant as they ever were. What we have seen of brutality, we\r\nhave seen, and because it was strange, it was not conclusive. It was\r\nonly Berlin, Moscow, Versailles in 1914 to 1919, not Armageddon, as we\r\nrhetorically said. The more realistically men have faced out the\r\nbrutality and the hysteria, the more they have earned the right to say\r\nthat it is not foolish for men to believe, because another great war\r\ntook place, that intelligence, courage and effort cannot ever contrive\r\na good life for all men.\r\n\r\nGreat as was the horror, it was not universal. There were corrupt, and\r\nthere were incorruptible. There was muddle and there were miracles.\r\nThere was huge lying. There were men with the will to uncover it. It\r\nis no judgment, but only a mood, when men deny that what some men have\r\nbeen, more men, and ultimately enough men, might be. You can despair\r\nof what has never been. You can despair of ever having three heads,\r\nthough Mr. Shaw has declined to despair even of that. But you cannot\r\ndespair of the possibilities that could exist by virtue of any human\r\nquality which a human being has exhibited. And if amidst all the evils\r\nof this decade, you have not seen men and women, known moments that\r\nyou would like to multiply, the Lord himself cannot help you.",
