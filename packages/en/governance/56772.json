The sketches here brought\r\ntogether are the result of a special visit to Russia by Mr. Hugo Ganz,\r\nthe well-known writer of Vienna, who was furnished with the best of\r\nintroductions to the various circles of Russian society, and had thus\r\nexceptional opportunities to acquire reliable information.\r\n\r\nWere not the reputation of the author and the standard of his informants\r\nalike absolutely above suspicion, it would seem incredible that such\r\nconditions as those depicted could exist in the twentieth century in a\r\ncountry claiming a place among civilized nations. Indeed, whereas Japan\r\nhas incontestably proved that she is emerging from the darkness of\r\ncenturies, Russia is content to remain in a state of semi-barbarism\r\nwhich might be looked for in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nSince the sketches were written, the birth of an heir to the imperial\r\nthrone and the assassination of Von Plehve have altered Russian\r\nconditions to a certain extent. But though the appointment of\r\nSvyatopolk-Mirski seems at first sight to afford ground for\r\ncongratulation, it is evident that even with the best intentions the new\r\nminister of the interior will hardly be able to effect much amelioration\r\nuntil the entire system of the Russian government is changed.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the articles in the following pages have appeared in the\r\nBerlin _Nation_ and in the Frankfort _Zeitung_, and have received very\r\nfavorable notice in the German press. It is intended to publish an\r\nedition of the book in German, but the present translation is the only\r\nauthorized one in the English language.\r\n\r\nHERMAN ROSENTHAL\r\n\r\nNEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY,\r\n_October 1, 1904_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF RIDDLES\r\n\r\n(RUSSIA OF TO-DAY)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly before my departure from Vienna I chanced to meet an\r\nacquaintance, a Viennese writer.\r\n\r\n\"Are you really going to Russia?\" said he. \"I almost envy you, for it is\r\nto us a land of riddles. It has great artists and writers and\r\nundoubtedly a highly educated upper stratum of the nation; at the same\r\ntime it displays political conditions really barbarous in their\r\nbackwardness. How are these co-ordinated? How is the maintenance\r\npossible, in the close proximity of comparatively free governments, of a\r\nrégime which knows no personal liberty, no privacy of the mails, and in\r\nwhich there is but one master--namely, the absolute police?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are raising the very questions which lead me there,\" I replied. \"We\r\ndo not know Russia. We wonder at its great writers, but we cannot\r\nconceive how their greatness is possible under the existing conditions\r\nof public life, which remind one of a penitentiary rather than of a\r\ncivilized state. And the question that persistently arises is whether\r\nour conception of these conditions corresponds to reality, or whether we\r\nare laboring under such a delusion as would befall one attempting to\r\njudge public life in Germany from the speeches of Bebel and other\r\nradicals. In truth, we know only the opposition or revolutionary\r\nliterature of Russia; and, as far as appearances go, it is hardly\r\ncredible that a system such as it describes and brands for its _inhuman_\r\nwickedness can long retain the ascendency.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going, then, without prejudices?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I may say that I have none. We have long been cured of the\r\nnotion that one and the same form of government may be prescribed as the\r\nonly one leading to contentment in all times and in all countries.\r\nDeductive philosophy in political science has been replaced by inductive\r\nrealistic philosophy, and a true understanding of existing conditions\r\nappears now to us of greater moment than the most beautiful ideals.\r\nAbove all things, I feel myself free from the childish moral valuation\r\nof different political beliefs. One person may be at the same time a\r\nconservative and a gentleman or a radical and a knave. Should I come to\r\nthe conclusion that Russian absolutism is or can be defended in good\r\nfaith by upright Russian patriots there will be nothing to prevent my\r\nfreely admitting it. An unbiased observer should not be wedded to any\r\ndoctrine.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I shall be doubly curious as to the results of your\r\nstudies.\"\r\n\r\nWe parted.\r\n\r\nI have cited here this characteristic conversation because it\r\ndemonstrates better than any introduction what the intelligent European\r\nis nowadays eager to discover about Russia, and what led me in the depth\r\nof winter, at the critical moment before the outbreak of a great war, to\r\nthe northern empire. That this war was imminent was then (at the\r\nbeginning of January) apparent to every statesman free from official\r\nbias. There was scarcely a foreboding of it in Russia itself. For me,\r\nhowever, that particular moment was of value, for it offered an\r\nopportunity to study for a short time Russian society, first in a state\r\nof calm, and then in the excitement which naturally followed the\r\ndeclaration of war. I made provision for both war and peace and set out\r\non my journey.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, I was not as light of heart as if I had been preparing to\r\nspend the winter on the Riviera or in Sicily. The climate had no terrors\r\nfor me, for I knew that nowhere is one so well protected from the\r\nseverity of the season as in the regions where ice and snow hold sway\r\nfor at least one-third of the year. But it was the gorgon-headed Russian\r\npolice that confronted me threateningly. My aim in travel was the study\r\nof political conditions, the unreserved discussion with clear-sighted\r\nand well-informed persons of the existing state of affairs. It was my\r\npurpose to record carefully my impressions and observations, and to\r\nreport them to all who were interested in my studies. But we are told\r\nthat all political conversation is forbidden in Russia. One may subject\r\nhimself and his friends to great annoyance by allowing some meddling\r\near-witness to catch accidentally a fragment of a political\r\nconversation. Writing and note-taking are even more dangerous; for the\r\npolice open all letters, and they are not deterred by any conscientious\r\nscruples from confiscating the notes even of foreigners when they appear\r\nsuspicious. Ambassadors and consuls are loath to engage in altercations\r\nwith the Russian police, for statesmanship enjoins friendly relations\r\nwith the government of the powerful Russian empire, and when an\r\ninconvenient foreigner disappears somewhere in darkest Russia--as was\r\nthe case with a French engineer who came in conflict with the police in\r\na concert-hall and was never seen again--no one is disturbed by the\r\nincident. All these reflections were not cheering to me, who, besides,\r\nwas unfamiliar with the language of the country. None the less was I\r\naverse to returning home without my whole skin or with empty hands.\r\n\r\nHere I would state that I did not experience the slightest annoyance\r\nthroughout my entire journey. I was not subjected to police\r\nsurveillance, nor did I notice in my meagre correspondence the least\r\ntrace of police interference--the latter being probably due to the\r\nextreme precautions taken by me in sending my mail in inconspicuous\r\nenvelopes. And yet what a condition of things for a great country--that\r\nevery traveller who wishes to enter its territory must arm himself with\r\nprecautionary measures, as if he were preparing to visit a robber's den!\r\nIs it compatible with the usages of modern Europe, forsooth, that no\r\nstep may be taken in this country without one's being provided with\r\ndocuments of identification; that one may not cross the boundary either\r\ninto or out of the country without the special permission of the\r\nconsulate or of the police? Is Russia a state or a prison? Is it a\r\nmodern Tauris full of terrors to the stranger? I am not now speaking of\r\nthe passport difficulties peculiar to Jews, who, generally speaking, can\r\nhardly obtain entrance to holy Russia, and who, when they succeed in\r\ngaining admission, must be in constant dread of unpleasantness in every\r\ntown and in every hotel. I merely ask whether it is compatible with the\r\ngood name of a state that still wishes to exchange courtesies with\r\nneighboring states to appear in the popular imagination as a ferocious\r\nmonster ignoring right and without decency? How can trade and\r\nintercourse develop; how can the unimpeded flow of the sap of culture,\r\nthe circulation of the national blood, take place in a land where terror\r\nguards the boundaries and where the reputation of arbitrariness impedes\r\nall progress? And what modern state or system of national economy may,\r\nwithout the unimpeded circulation of the sap of culture, maintain itself\r\nat a level corresponding to the modern requirements of its internal and\r\nexternal productive capacity? Are the advantages of an all-controlling\r\npolice system in any degree proportionate to its innumerable economic\r\ndisadvantages? Is the occasional annoyance of a really objectionable\r\nintruder sufficient compensation for the evil reputation which this\r\nsystem attaches to the whole country? It is a sheer impossibility to\r\nwatch daily and hourly a hundred million people. Why are such enormous\r\nsacrifices made at all for the sake of an undertaking injurious in\r\nitself and, moreover, impossible of execution?\r\n\r\nSuch are the thoughts that the traveller approaching the frontier cannot\r\nescape. I may here say, in advance, that the police could not prevent my\r\nholding conversations throughout Russia with men in various walks of\r\nlife on subjects very objectionable to the police officials. Is it worth\r\nwhile, then, to bear the evil repute that Russia is a prison where no\r\nman's life or property is secure? Apart from actual fact, the stranger\r\ndoes not know, before crossing the boundary, whether the police tyranny\r\nis really as inexorable as it is pictured and is believed abroad, but of\r\nthis he is certain, that such an evil reputation does the country\r\nincalculable economic injury, and that a country with such an evil\r\nrepute can never be regarded as mature from the economic stand-point, to\r\nsay nothing of political honor, to which, perhaps, there is a\r\ndisposition to attach less value in the high places of autocratic rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWARSAW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe express-train is nearing the frontier at dawn. We are greeted by the\r\nsleeping-car conductor with the significant announcement, \"We shall soon\r\nbe in Russia\"--an announcement which, it must be confessed, produces a\r\nslight palpitation of the heart. We are now at the gate of a mysterious\r\ncountry, with passport and baggage in the best of order. A Russian\r\nconsulate had found us worthy to set foot upon the soil of holy Russia,\r\nand had explicitly stated that fact in our passport. Travellers may\r\njourney without this certificate through the five continents, but if\r\nunprovided with it may not set foot on Russian soil. We have no weapons\r\nsave our five fingers, and, above all, not a single printed book or\r\nnewspaper that might cause trouble at the frontier, excepting the\r\ninvaluable _Baedeker_, for the importation of books, as we already knew\r\nat home, is put under severe ban in the domain of the Holy Synod. None\r\nthe less, a slight palpitation of the heart, a slight anxiety, are felt\r\nat the sight of a narrow bridge leading between two sentry-boxes over a\r\nsmall stream separating two countries--nay, two civilizations. Shall we\r\nfind favor in the eyes of the almighty gendarme who enters our coupé\r\nwith a polite bow, as we approach the station, and asks for our\r\npassport? May it not be that a secret police prohibition has preceded\r\nus, notwithstanding the regularity of our passport, and that it now\r\nprecludes our entrance? Has not your pen sinned many a time against the\r\nknout and autocracy, and are you not, after all, if carefully examined,\r\nwith all your scribbling, a thoroughly objectionable person in the eyes\r\nof the police--at least, when seen with Russian eyes?\r\n\r\nBut, thank Heaven, the world is great and I am insignificant; Russian\r\ncensorship has not yet taken notice of all the sins of my pen; hence the\r\nsame officer returns to me with the same bow my passport after the\r\ncustoms inspection. The holy Russian empire, from Warsaw to Vladivostok,\r\nis now exposed to my curious eyes.\r\n\r\nThe customs inspection was in itself a peculiar experience. The porter,\r\na Pole with a good-natured, handsome face, takes our baggage and\r\nbaggage-certificate, and invites us with a friendly gesture to follow\r\nhim to the great inspection hall. The hall is scrupulously clean and no\r\nloud talking is heard there. The passengers take their places on one\r\nside of the inspection-table, the porters on the other, the latter in\r\norderly file with their caps in their hands. They communicate with one\r\nanother only with their eyes. _Silence_ has begun. I do not know\r\nwhether it is purposely so, or whether it is merely incidental to the\r\nparticularly strict local régime, that the implicit obedience, the\r\nsilent subjection, and the irresistible power of despotism are here\r\nbrought home so effectively to the stranger. But this impression remains\r\nwith the traveller throughout the entire journey:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Be silent, restrain yourselves,\r\n     We are watched in word and look.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAn empire of one hundred and thirty millions of prisoners and of one\r\nmillion jailers--such is Russia; and these jailers understand no joke.\r\nIt is a terrible machinery, this despotism, with all its wheels working\r\none within the other. It is relentless and keen in all its mechanism,\r\nhenceforth no loud word shall be spoken. The official organs alone have\r\na voice; private persons may speak only in low tones.\r\n\r\nBut how orderly, politely, and neatly do the officials and porters\r\nexecute the examination and forwarding of our baggage when despotism\r\nwishes to reconcile people to its threatening silence. Only ten kopeks,\r\nturned into the common treasury, are asked for the handling of our large\r\namount of baggage, and we are then led, together with the other\r\ntravellers, to the Russian exit of the customs inspection hall. After a\r\nshort wait there the gate is opened, and at a given signal we are\r\nmarched out of the hall in single file to refresh ourselves, before the\r\ndeparture of the train, with a little breakfast.\r\n\r\nScrupulous cleanliness reigns in the large, airy restaurant also. We\r\nare in the land of caviar. Caviar sandwiches, appetizingly prepared, lie\r\non the buffet-table. \"Caviar\" may also be found in one or another of the\r\nforeign papers offered for sale by the newsboys. When the censorship\r\nfinds it inconvenient to eliminate entire pages whose contents are\r\nobjectionable, it generously spreads printer's ink on the condemned\r\npassages, scatters sand over them, and puts the whole in the press. The\r\nresult is a lattice-like pattern, not unlike in appearance to pressed\r\ncaviar, to which the Russian, with good-natured self-derision, applies\r\nthe term \"press-caviar,\" an expression which has a two-fold meaning.\r\nCaviar is admittedly regarded as an easily digestible food. The Russian\r\ncensor considers his caviar more useful and less harmful than that which\r\nill-advised men in foreign countries allow themselves to print.\r\n\r\nA few glasses of tea drawn from a samovar drive away the last traces of\r\nthe morning frost, and, wrapped in fur coats, and with a feeling like\r\nthat succeeding an adventure crowned with victory, we for the first time\r\nstroll along a Russian railway platform.\r\n\r\nWe again enter the coupé, now in charge of Russian attendants.\r\n\r\nA long, monotonous ride through level, swampy country, over which there\r\nslowly floats the gray vapor of the locomotive, finally brings us at\r\ndusk to Warsaw.\r\n\r\nNothing oppresses the spirit more deeply than such a ten-hour monotony\r\nof leaden-gray skies, dirty-gray snow, and a thick, gray, smoky mist.\r\nThe gendarmes in gray coats at the infrequent stations; the greasy Jews\r\nwith their long coats of uncertain color; the secret police with their\r\nquestionable gentility, never absent--all these are not calculated to\r\nrelieve the painful feeling of sadness and dreariness. We were out of\r\nhumor when we reached Warsaw. We believed that we had the right to\r\nexpect crisp winter weather in Russia and were disappointed to find only\r\nmud and humidity. But perhaps Warsaw is not really Russia? Or are we\r\nstill in central Europe? The evening at the hotel and the following days\r\nconclusively proved to us that Warsaw, indeed all Poland, with its\r\nclimate, its civilization, its religion, and--its ideas, does not\r\nbelong, in the real sense of the term, to Russia; that the isotherm\r\nwhich connects Russia proper with other regions of the same mean\r\ntemperature runs considerably north of Poland. A Buckle would be puzzled\r\nby this fact alone. The dwellers could not be of the same race here nor\r\nthe same system be possible. When, nevertheless, only one power rules\r\nhere, it does so by violence and in spite of natural laws; it must give\r\nrise to resentment and can give no promise of permanence.\r\n\r\nOn my return journey from the heart of Russia I purposely suppressed the\r\nfirst impression gained by me in Warsaw, but when I was there again\r\nthis impression reasserted itself even more strongly. Warsaw is no more\r\nRussia than Lemberg or Dresden, in spite of the overpowering Russian\r\nchurches, in spite of the innumerable Russian officers and soldiers, in\r\nspite of the obligatory Russian signs on the stores, which, with some\r\nexperience, may be deciphered as \"Chajim Berlinerblau,\" or something\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nAside from its jargon-speaking Jews, Warsaw is pre-eminently a Catholic\r\ncity, and its entire civilization is Roman Catholic. Its very situation\r\nis striking. Approaching it from the Vistula, one may see where the city\r\nhad built its defences--towards the east! Thence came the enemy, the\r\nMongol, the Russian. From the east there came barbarism and oppression,\r\ntherefore the fortifications and walls were built on the river-bank\r\ncommanding the valley of the Vistula, through which alone an enemy could\r\ncome. From the west came only the blessings of civilization and\r\nreligion, with its messengers that once were harbingers of civilization,\r\nand which, perhaps, still remain such in this region.\r\n\r\nWarsaw is a beautiful and fashionable city when considered apart from\r\nthe sections where the Jews are crowded together. The members of its\r\nelegant society know how to live in spite of national misery and\r\noppression. Hotel Bristol, the finest hotel in the city, is their\r\nrendezvous. Here they meet one another at breakfast, at dinner, in the\r\nsplendid English dining-room; men and women, guests from\r\nPrussian-Poland and Galicia, noble families of the partitioned kingdom.\r\nThey are of one race, one class, one caste; they know one another, like\r\nmembers of the same club, and all approximately the same type--somewhat\r\noverslender forms, long, nervous hands, finely sculptured noses, sharply\r\nchiselled temples, angular foreheads, the women supple and lissome, each\r\nmotion accompanied by a touch of polished affectation. When compared\r\nwith this Polish aristocracy, the Russian officers, who eat at separate\r\ntables, leave the impression, with their German scholar-faces or Cossack\r\nphysiognomies, of provincial backwardness. They are merely bourgeois in\r\nuniform even though they be real princes, while the Pole who has\r\ngraduated from that high-school of refinement, the Jesuit\r\nboarding-school, is an aristocrat, a cavalier, from head to foot. They\r\nremain separate like oil and water. The Russian, even though he is the\r\nmaster, is of no consequence here. It is only necessary to observe for\r\nthe space of an hour from some corner of the elegant dining-room of\r\nHotel Bristol the behavior of the Polish society and the complete\r\nisolation of the Russian officers or officials; it is only necessary to\r\nbe able to distinguish the groups from one another--the Baltic nobility\r\nwith their almost bourgeois families, merchants from all the principal\r\ncountries, Russian functionaries, and Polish society--and it will at\r\nonce become clear who is at home here, firmly rooted to the soil, so\r\nthat all others become strangers and intruders; it is the Poles and the\r\nPoles alone.\r\n\r\nThere is some talk of a change of relations that has been attempted with\r\nthe aid of the French ally through the Vatican, so as to array Poland\r\nagainst Protestant Prussia and to reconcile it to orthodox Russia.\r\nIndeed, the Russian government has found it necessary to allow religious\r\ninstructions in secondary schools to be given in the Polish\r\nmother-tongue, just at the time when the German government had on its\r\nhands the Wreschen trials. In fact, the more Prussian narrowness insults\r\nand provokes the Poles the greater are the Russian efforts to win them\r\nover. This, however, is only a political move, an attempt at bribery\r\nthat the Poles let pass because it suits them, though one, perhaps, that\r\nthe real go-betweens, the Jesuits, take in earnest, but the success of\r\nwhich, after all, would be contrary to all known facts of history and\r\ncivilization, for it would be opposed to the national sentiment. In\r\nRussia dwells the marrow of the Polish nation; in Russia dwell the\r\nPolish aristocracy and that industrial middle class which has become\r\nrich and Polish in spirit in so far as it was of foreign origin; and yet\r\nin this homogeneous land of Poland the Polish language is interdicted,\r\nso to speak, and tolerated everywhere only as a local dialect.\r\nUniversity, gymnasiums, courts, and administration are all Russian--a\r\nGessler hat, placed in the Russian sign of every store, on which the\r\nLatin-Polish inscription may appear only in a secondary position--a\r\nproceeding to which no self-respecting people will submit, and need not\r\nsubmit, especially from a master whose so-called civilization is of far\r\nmore recent origin than its own. The German in America becomes\r\nAmericanized voluntarily and irresistibly, because the English language\r\nis recognized as a more useful medium than his own, as the\r\nworld-language. The Pole will never become Russianized as long as he\r\nremains on Polish soil; and no matter how significantly the\r\n\"Ausgleichspolen\" (Polish compromise party) flirt with the Russian\r\nrégime, such an attitude hides a sense of annoyance and is not caused by\r\nreal fellow-feeling. For the Pole, Germanization is an ill-fitting\r\ngarment that only binds; Russianization is a thorn in the flesh,\r\nproducing pus and throwing the entire system into a fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWARSAW--_CONTINUED_\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical reflections force themselves on you in this subjugated but by\r\nno means pacified country. It is in vain you tell yourself that the\r\nconstant factors of climate, soil, race, and religion are of greater\r\nimportance for the true understanding of a country, city, or people than\r\npassing political incidents and systems. You cannot emancipate yourself\r\nfrom politics in Poland. This is not a country like German Alsace,\r\nwhere, according to Moltke, a guard must be kept for fifty years, after\r\nwhich, like the German country it originally was, it will again become\r\nand remain German. Poland is a country forcibly subjected and conquered,\r\nand you feel it when walking the streets and in the fashionable hotel,\r\nwhere the national sorrow is generously moistened with champagne at the\r\ntables of the aristocracy even at the early breakfast hour.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not necessary for us to be more passionately patriotic\r\nand political than these champagne counts, and we must attempt to secure\r\nsomething of the street scenes without becoming involved too deeply in\r\npolitical problems.\r\n\r\nWhenever I come to a town I ask myself, Why was it built here and not\r\nelsewhere? With the help of a little imagination one can understand even\r\nto-day how Warsaw came into existence. It was at the head of a bridge.\r\nThe word \"Warsaw\" is believed to be derived from the word \"Warszain\" (on\r\nthe height). So the city lies at a height of about forty metres on the\r\nbank of the Vistula, fully half a kilometre wide at this place. An\r\nelevation of forty metres on the immediate bank of a broad stream\r\noffered, at the time of its foundation in the twelfth century, a natural\r\nfortification, and the merchants who came up from the sea to sell their\r\nwares to the semi-barbarous inhabitants of the plain may have found\r\nperhaps on this height a frequent protection from the attacks of the\r\nplainsmen. Later the fort became a city and culture and luxury made\r\ntheir appearance, offering to the tamed dwellers of the plains and to\r\nthe landed proprietors from far and near the opportunity to squander the\r\nproceeds of their crops. The numerous churches did not fare badly in the\r\ndays of penitence then.\r\n\r\nTo-day, Warsaw is still a fine city of broad streets paved with wooden\r\nblocks, with rows of stores on both sides, prominent among which are the\r\nrichly equipped jewelry establishments. Carriage traffic is\r\nconsiderable, even though it cannot compare with that in St. Petersburg.\r\nJust now the main artery of the city, the Vistula, is closed. The stream\r\nis frozen almost over its entire width and ravens croak on the snowy\r\nshoals. But within the city there pass unceasingly modestly neat\r\ncabriolets, fashionable cabs, and splendid private turnouts with Russian\r\nharness and servants. The buildings are of little interest. A few\r\nattempts in the Russian style, a few Polish shadings of quite modern\r\nsecession architecture strike the foreigner, but the deepest impression\r\nis created by the feverish life on the streets and not by its ornamental\r\nframe-work. From this should be excepted the pleasure Villa Lazienki and\r\nits quaint park situated at the end of the avenue. Even snow and ice\r\ncannot banish the spirits that possess one in these gardens. It is a\r\nminiature Versailles. Here is a little castle within which is a\r\npicture-gallery of aristocratic beauties, statues, and portraits of King\r\nStanislas Poniatowski represented mythologically as King Solomon\r\nentering Jerusalem; without are enchanting villas scattered throughout\r\nthe park, in the centre of which is a little natural theatre built in\r\nthe open of stone, and arranged like an amphitheatre, the stage\r\nseparated from the rest by an arena of the wide lake, and constructed of\r\nCorinthian columns and palisade of bushes. Plays were given here in the\r\ntimes when the court and the \"beauties\" of the picture-gallery enjoyed\r\nnature and art together. The moon in the sky was one of the requisites,\r\nand fireworks were burned for the relaxation of the high and most high\r\nlords. Meanwhile the kingdom hastened to its ruin; for a witty,\r\npleasure-loving court and an immoral oligarchy together are beyond the\r\nendurance of one people, especially when it is surrounded by covetous\r\nneighbors. One hundred years of slavery and three ruthlessly suppressed\r\nrevolutions are the historical penalty for the pleasures of Castle\r\nLazienki. There and on the broad election plane the \"Pole Elekcji\r\nKrolow,\" in the southern part of the town, where the \"schlachtzitz\"\r\n(lordling) could deposit his \"liberum veto\" for a couple of rubles or\r\nthalers, the kingdom was destroyed, and its resurrection is a pious wish\r\nthe fulfilment of which even our grandchildren will not live to see.\r\n\r\nI have no faith in a Polish kingdom. There may be a Polish revolution\r\nto-morrow, perhaps, when the Russians shall meet defeat in eastern Asia,\r\nas the Russian patriots hope, but a Polish kingdom there will never be.\r\nIt is quite apparent how the influence of the times is changing the\r\nentire social structure of the people. No nation can maintain itself\r\nwithout a middle class, and Poland still has no middle class. The\r\nmaterial for such a class, the strong Jewish population, has been so\r\nground down that a half-century would not be sufficient for its\r\nrestoration and the Russian régime of to-day is disposed to anything\r\nrather than to the uplifting and the education of the Polish Jewry. It\r\nis stated that there are in Warsaw a quarter of a million Jews, a few\r\nwell-to-do people among them, who have hastened, for the most part, to\r\ntransform themselves into \"Poles of the Mosaic faith,\" without\r\ndisarming thereby the clerical anti-Semitism of the Polish people, and\r\ninnumerable beggars or half-beggars, who are designated in western\r\nEurope as \"schnorrer.\" And of these there are in Warsaw an unknown\r\nnumber. It is hard to draw the line between the \"schnorrer\" and the\r\n\"Luftmensch\" (a man without any certain source of income), who has not\r\nyet resigned himself to beggary, and yet cannot tell in the morning\r\nwhence he is to draw his sustenance at noon. These include artisans,\r\nsweat-shop workers, agents, and go-betweens, a city proletariat of the\r\nvery worst kind. I have seen no such shocking misery in the Jewish\r\nquarters on the Moldau as I encountered in the brilliant capital Warsaw.\r\nThe Polish Jew, everywhere despised and unwelcome, is the wandering\r\npoverty-witness of Polish mismanagement. A system that succeeds in\r\ndepraving the sober, pious, and sexually disciplined orthodox Jew to the\r\nextent observed in a portion of the Jewish Polish proletariat should be\r\naccorded recognition as the most useless system on the face of the\r\nearth. In the last analysis it was the Polish \"schlachtzitz,\" and the\r\nPolish clerical going hand-in-hand with him, that constituted the prime\r\ncause of all the miseries of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, to be just, one should compare this cheerless Polish-Jewish\r\nproletariat with its immediate environment--the Polish peasants and the\r\ncommon people. Here one would still find a plus of virtues on the Jewish\r\nside. The wretched Polish peasant is not more cleanly than the Jew. On\r\nthe contrary, he lives in the same room with his pig, and no ritual\r\nrequirement compels him to wash his body at least once a week. The Jew,\r\nunder his patched garment, is for the most part comparatively clean,\r\nonly hopelessly stunted and emaciated. The Jew does not drink, while his\r\n\"master,\" the Pole, has a kindly disposition towards all sorts of\r\nspirituous liquors. Also, the modesty of the Jewish women has yielded\r\nbut lately to the pressure of endless misery or the temptations of the\r\ncities, while of the higher classes of Polish and Russian society but\r\nlittle of an exemplary character has been told. And finally:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Deutsche Redlichkeit suchst Du in allen Winkeln vergebens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGoethe's verse applies not only to the Italians, for whom it was\r\nintended; it applies also to Poland and Russia, where less faith is\r\nattached to statements than is customary with us, and it applies, above\r\nall, to the merchant classes of all nations who are wont to make their\r\nliving by overreaching their neighbors. There is a wide gulf between the\r\ndevelopment of commercial ethics, as they are understood with us and in\r\nEngland, and the tricks and devices of petty trade no matter of what\r\nnation. But the Jew in Poland and in Russia has been and still is being\r\ndriven, in great measure, into a class of wretched petty traders; and\r\nthe law of the land forces back into the pale of settlement by drastic\r\nregulations him who would escape from its cage and from an occupation of\r\ndubious ethics.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish section is the \"partie Hortense\" of the beautiful Polish\r\ncapital; the Jewish misery is a shameful stain on Polish rule and its\r\nNemesis. All the five continents must have their misery and toil, and\r\nthey need a firm, all-embracing humanity to relieve them of this\r\ncontagious wretchedness, this residue of centuries of depravity. But for\r\nPoland and Russia the humane solution of the Jewish question is simply a\r\nlife-question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG\r\n\r\n\r\nA hymn of praise to the Russian railroad! The Russian tracks begin at\r\nWarsaw to have a considerably broader bed. This for a strategical\r\npurpose, to render difficult the invasion by European armies. It is also\r\na benefit to the traveller, for the Russian coaches are wider and more\r\ncomfortable than the European, and the side-passages along the coupé are\r\nvery convenient for little walks during the journey. A separate heating\r\ncompartment and buffet, with the indispensable samovar, where one may\r\nsecure a glass of tea at any time, are situated in the centre of the\r\nlong car. The trains do not jolt, although they are almost as fast as\r\nours. The smoke and soot do not drive through the tightly closed double\r\nwindows. A twenty-four hour trip here tires one less than a six-hour\r\ntrip with us. Certainly there is more need of preparation for a\r\ncomfortable journey in Russia than in the West. The distances are\r\nimmense, a twenty-four hour journey creating no comments. The\r\nWarsaw-Petersburg train was as well filled as the ordinary express-train\r\nbetween Frankfort and Cologne.\r\n\r\nThe run, which lasts from one morning to the next, is naturally not\r\nvery entertaining. The broad expanse of snowy plain, relieved only by\r\nsnow-breaks and frozen swamps, at every two miles a few wretched\r\nhalf-Asiatic huts, and occasionally the dark profile of a forest, no\r\nmore to be seen, and a sea of unintelligible Slavic sounds, no more to\r\nbe heard. The feeling of loneliness grows upon one, and the impression\r\nbecomes constantly stronger that Russia is a world for itself.\r\n\r\nBut there is an end to everything, even to a railroad journey without\r\nbooks, without papers, and without conversation. At the dawn of the\r\nclear, wintry day one may already distinguish the signs of a great city.\r\nA station with magnificent buildings and a well-cared-for park\r\nstretching almost to the tracks claims our attention after the many\r\nunimpressive sights of the long road. We decipher the name \"Gatschina,\"\r\nand understand why there is such a strong police force on the platform.\r\nThis is the Winter Palace. Scarcely an hour later the gilded cupolas\r\nstand out bright above the snow; the brakes are put on; we are in St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the city appears in a favorable light when viewed\r\nfrom the railroad. The not over-elegant two-horse vehicle which takes us\r\nand our baggage rattles over miserable pavements, dirty from the melting\r\nsnow, through broad, endless suburban streets. The houses on either side\r\nare of only one story, built mostly of wood, their poverty-stricken\r\nappearance being intensified here and there by three-storied barracks.\r\nLiquor-shops, little second-hand stores, wooden huts, with putrid\r\ngarbage, follow one another in a variety by no means pleasing. The\r\npassers-by, ill-clad, with the inevitable rubber shoes, shuffle along\r\nthe slushy sidewalks; trucks with two or sometimes three horses, their\r\nnecks bent under the brightly painted Russian \"duga\" (wooden yoke), a\r\ntruly Gorki atmosphere in its entirety. One can scarcely believe that he\r\nis entering one of the most brilliant cities of the continent. The\r\nendless rows of stores with their two-storied sheds, which one passes on\r\nthe way to the centre of the city, but slightly improve one's first\r\nimpression, for even they are far removed from the splendor of the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nWe finally reach the hotel to which our mail has been addressed. It is\r\nan enormous structure, more than two hundred metres long. Yet it has no\r\nroom for us. It is filled to overflowing. It is impossible to crowd in\r\none more soul. We again take our carriage. We drive from one hotel to\r\nanother, growing constantly more modest in our demands for lodging. But\r\nour efforts are vain. Everything is occupied to the very gables.\r\n\r\nWe were careless in coming to St. Petersburg in January. This is the\r\ntime of congresses, of business, of carnivals. All the provincial\r\nofficials are here to render their annual reports to their ministries.\r\nNaturally, they bring with them their families, who wish to make their\r\nimportant purchases here and to taste of the social season. Congresses\r\nand conferences are held here not in the summer and vacation months as\r\nwith us, but shortly before the \"butter-week,\" really a carnival, the\r\npleasure of which one may wish to take this opportunity to test.\r\nMedical, teachers', and insurance congresses are held here at the same\r\ntime. Foreign merchants come here to complete their transactions. But\r\nthe great city of St. Petersburg is not adapted for foreign guests.\r\n\r\nThe instincts of self-defence awake at the time of need. We do not\r\nintend to camp to-night under the bridge arch. We make great efforts and\r\nby the evening have secured a room, in spite of the \"absolute\r\nimpossibility,\" in that large and only comfortable hotel in St.\r\nPetersburg, which we shared with a friendly mouse, but which was free\r\nfrom other objectionable tenants. Even the little mouse was deprived in\r\na base manner of its life and liberty the very next night. Once provided\r\nwith board and lodging, we decided to become acquainted with the better\r\nside of St. Petersburg. What does a stranger usually do in the evening\r\nwhen he visits a strange city? He goes to some theatre.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of hotel porters and agents to provide for the wishes\r\nof the guests. \"Hello, agent; get me tickets for the Imperial\r\nTheatre\"--where a ballet of Tschaikowski's is to be presented to-night\r\nby first-class talent. The theatre programme, obligingly provided with a\r\nFrench translation, informs us that among others, Kscheschinska will do\r\nherself the honor to play the leading rôle. \"But, honored sir, that is\r\nquite impossible; first, because this is the carnival time; second,\r\nbecause most of the seats are already subscribed for; and third, because\r\nKscheschinska dances to-night\"--a sly closing of the left eye\r\naccompanies the mention of the name--\"and neither the Emperor nor the\r\ncourt will be absent from the theatre. Unless you pay twenty to thirty\r\nrubles to a speculator you will hardly get into the theatre.\"\r\n\r\nSince my passion for the ballet or for Kscheschinska does not attain the\r\nproportions of a twenty-ruble investment, I find it preferable to devote\r\nthe evening to the always interesting and fruitful hotel studies. What\r\nseething life in the numberless corridors, dining-halls, and vestibules\r\nof the fashionable St. Petersburg Hotel! Governors in generals'\r\ngold-braided uniforms, covered with so many orders and medals that it\r\nmakes one curious to find out about all the deeds of heroism for which\r\nthey were bestowed; chamberlains with refined elegance in their gala\r\ndress, hiding the \"beau restes\" of the one-sided Adonis; tall, agile,\r\ndark-eyed Circassians with the indispensable cartridge-pouch on the\r\nbreast region of their long coats, with the dagger hanging in its\r\nmassive gold sheath from the tightly drawn belt; Cossacks with fur caps\r\na foot high, made of white or black Angora skins, placed on their\r\nbristly heads; a nimble Chinese man, or maid, servant, with long\r\npigtail, whose sex it is impossible to distinguish; a whole troop of\r\ndark-eyed Khivanese squatting on their prayer-rugs before the apartment\r\nof their khan, passing the nargile from hand to hand, and exchanging\r\nwitticisms about the passing Europeans; beardless Tatar waiters\r\nshuffling by in their flat-soled shoes--a mixture of Europe and Asia\r\nsuch as may hardly be seen at once in any other part of the world. The\r\nwest European merchants and other travellers, who throng the hotel, are\r\nscarcely noted among the exotic appearances. In this hotel, as elsewhere\r\nthroughout St. Petersburg, the European, the civilian, is seemingly\r\nmerely tolerated. The city belongs to the functionaries, soldiers,\r\nofficials, and chamberlains, to the Cossacks, Circassians, and, above\r\nall others, to the police. More intimate acquaintance reveals that a\r\ngoodly portion of the uniformed persons in St. Petersburg are ordinary\r\nstudents, technologists, professors, etc., and that these uniformed\r\npersons do not equally represent the state. On the contrary, the fight\r\nof the state, or, to be more precise, of the police, against the free\r\nprofessions, would not be so bitter if the members of the latter were\r\nnot entitled to wear uniforms. As it is, they also may appear to the\r\ncommon people as representatives of the Czar's authority.\r\n\r\nWe slept through the night. Kind fate had decreed for us snow and cold\r\nin succession to the disagreeable thaw, and we availed ourselves of the\r\nclear weather to become acquainted with the bright side of St.\r\nPetersburg. And, first of all, the snow! It changes the entire\r\nappearance of the city as if by a magic wand. The narrow, open carriages\r\nwhere two persons can accommodate themselves only with difficulty,\r\nespecially when wrapped in fur coats, have disappeared. Their places\r\nhave been taken by small, low sleighs without backs. The \"izwozchik\"\r\n(driver) in his blue, plaited Tatar fur coat and multicolored sash, with\r\nfur-trimmed plush cap on his head, sits almost in the passenger's lap.\r\nYet there is compensation for the meagre dimensions of the sleigh. The\r\nsmall, rugged horses speed along like arrows through the straight\r\nstreets, hastened on by the caressing words or the exclamations of the\r\nbearded driver. Horse, driver, and sleigh are very essential figures in\r\nthe St. Petersburg street scenes. We at home cannot at all realize how\r\nmuch driving is done in St. Petersburg. The distances are enormous;\r\nstreets five or six kilometres long are not unusual. There are almost no\r\nstreetcar lines, thanks to the selfishness of the town representatives,\r\ncomposed of St. Petersburg house-owners, who do not care to see a\r\nreduction in rents in the central portion of the town. The average city\r\ninhabitant readily parts with the thirty, forty, or fifty kopeks\r\ndemanded by the \"izwozchik,\" and thus everything is rushed along in an\r\nunending race. The \"pravo\" (right) or \"hei beregis!\" (look out!), which\r\nthe drivers bawl to one another or to the pedestrians, resounds through\r\nthe streets, but they are not very effectual. One must open his eyes\r\nmore than his ears if he wishes to escape injury in the streets of St.\r\nPetersburg. The constant racing often results in four or five rows of\r\nspeeding conveyances attempting to pass one another. The drivers with\r\ntheir bearded, apostle faces, which appear lamblike when they\r\ngood-naturedly invite you to enter their conveyances, are like wild men\r\nwhen they let loose. Their Cossack nature then asserts itself. On and\r\nalways on, and let the poor pedestrian take care of his bones. And\r\nhowever much the little horse may pant and the flakes of foam may fly\r\nfrom its sides, \"his excellency,\" \"the count,\" \"his highness\" (the\r\nizwozchik is extremely generous with his titles), will surely add a few\r\nkopeks when the driver has been very smart; and so the little horse must\r\nrun until the passenger, unaccustomed to such driving, loses his breath.\r\n\r\nBut the Russian barbarian conception of wealth and fashion is to have\r\nhis driver race even when out for a pleasure drive, as if it were a\r\nquestion of life or death. The numberless private turnouts,\r\ndistinguished by their greater elegance, their splendid horses, harness,\r\nliveries, and carriages, have no less speed than the hackney-coachman,\r\nbut the reverse, at a still greater speed, thanks to the elasticity of\r\ntheir high-stepping Arab trotters. And now imagine twenty-five thousand\r\nsuch vehicles simultaneously in racing motion, with here and there a\r\njingling \"troika,\" its two outer horses galloping madly and the middle\r\nhorse trotting furiously; imagine, at the same time, the bright colors\r\nof the four-cornered plush caps on the heads of the stylish drivers, the\r\ngay-colored rugs on the \"troikas,\" the blue and green nets on the\r\ngalloping horses of the private sleighs, the glitter of the gold and\r\nsilver harness, the scarlet coats of the court coachmen and lackeys,\r\neverything rushing along on a crisp winter day, over the glimmering,\r\nfreshly fallen snow, between the mighty façades of imposing structures,\r\nflanked by an almost unbroken chain of tall policeman and gendarmes, and\r\nyou have the picture of the heart of St. Petersburg at the time of\r\nsocial activity. Splendor, riches, wildness are all caricatured into\r\nmagnificence as if calculated to impress and to frighten. Woe to him\r\nhere who is not of the masters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG--_CONTINUED_\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg is an act of violence. I have never received in any city\r\nsuch an impression of the forced and the unnatural as in this colossal\r\nprison or fortress of the Russia's mighty rule. The Neva, around whose\r\nislands the city is clustered, is really not a stream. It comes from\r\nnowhere and leads nowhere. It is the efflux of the Heaven-forsaken\r\nLadoga Lake, where no one has occasion to search for anything; and it\r\nleads into the Bay of Finland, which is frozen throughout half of the\r\nyear. No commercial considerations, not even strategical reasons, can\r\njustify the establishment of this capital at the mouth of the Neva. The\r\nfact that St. Petersburg has none the less become a city of millions of\r\ninhabitants is due entirely to the barbaric energy of its founder, Peter\r\nthe Great, an energy which still works in the plastic medium of Russian\r\nnational character. On the bank of the Neva stands the equestrian statue\r\nof Peter, raised on a mighty block of granite, a notable work of the\r\nFrenchman Falconet. The face of the Emperor as he ascends the rock is\r\nturned to the northwest, where his most dangerous rival, the Swedish\r\nCharles, lived. And just as his whole attitude expresses defiance and\r\nself-conscious power, so his city, St. Petersburg, is only a monument of\r\nthe defiance and the iron will of its founder. The historians relate\r\nthat Peter intended, by removing his residence to St. Petersburg, to\r\nfacilitate the access of European civilization to the Russian people. If\r\nthis be true, Peter utterly failed in his purpose. The old commercial\r\ncity, Riga, would have answered the purpose much better. To be sure,\r\nRiga did not come into Russian possession until eighteen years after the\r\nfounding of St. Petersburg. Yet what was there to prevent the despot\r\nfrom abandoning the work that he had begun? But no, St. Petersburg was\r\nto bid defiance to the contemporary might of Sweden, and so forty\r\nthousand men had to work for years in the swamps of the Neva to build\r\nthe mighty tyrant's castles, the Peter-and-Paul fortress, an immense\r\nstone block on the banks of the icy stream. Malarial fevers carried off\r\nmost of them; but the Russian people supplied more men, for such was the\r\nwill of the Czar. The drinking-water of St. Petersburg to-day is still a\r\nyellow, filthy fluid, consumption of which is sure to bring on typhoid\r\nfever; but the will of Peter still works, and St. Petersburg remains the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nPeter, with his peculiar blending of political supremacy and democratic\r\nfancifulness, built for himself a little house on the fortress island,\r\nwhere the furniture made by himself is still preserved by the side of\r\nthe miracle-working image of the Redeemer which the despot always\r\ncarried with him. His spirit soars over this city and this land. What he\r\ndid not entirely trust to his unscrupulous fist he left in honest\r\nbigotry to the bones of the holy Alexander Nevski, which he had brought\r\nto his capital soon after its establishment. Autocracy and popocracy\r\nstill reign in the Russian empire. The Peter-and-Paul fortress, in the\r\nsubterranean vaults of which many of the noblest hearts and heads of\r\nRussia have found their grave, the Isaac cathedral, with its barbarian\r\npomp of gold and precious stones, and the mighty monoliths--these are\r\nthe symbols of the city of St. Petersburg and of its régime. If there is\r\nin Russia, even among the enlightened minds, something like a fanatical\r\nhatred of civilization and of the West, it is due to the manner in which\r\nthe half-barbarian Peter imposed Western ideas and civilization on a\r\nharmless and good-natured people.\r\n\r\nWhat brutal power of will may do in defiance of unfriendly nature has\r\nbeen done on the banks of the Neva. Indeed, its green waters are now\r\nhidden by an ice-crust three feet thick, over which the sleighs run a\r\nrace with the little cars of the electrical railway. Yet even without\r\nthe restless shimmer of the water the view of the river-bank is still\r\nvery impressive. The golden glitter of the great cupolas of the Isaac\r\ncathedral, the long red front of the Winter Palace, the pale yellow\r\ncolumns of the admiralty, between Renaissance structures, stand out\r\nfrom among the rest.\r\n\r\nPalaces and palaces stretch along the stream right up to the Field of\r\nMars. The gilded spire of the Peter-and-Paul cathedral pierces the\r\nwhite-blue sky and greets, with its angel balanced on the extreme spire,\r\nthe equally grotesque high spire of the admiralty. Great stone and iron\r\nbridges span the broad stream, its opposite shore almost faded in the\r\nlight mist of the wintry day. Walking towards the middle of the bridge,\r\nwhence a splendid view may be obtained, one sees the long row of\r\nbuildings on the farther islands standing out of the mist. One row of\r\ncolumns is followed by another--the Academy of Arts, the Academy of\r\nSciences, the house of Menschikov, which Catherine built for her\r\nfavorite, come into view. Towards the west the hulls of vessels stand\r\nout from among the docks. Still farther out the mist hides the shoals of\r\nthe Neva, together with those of the Gulf of Finland, in an impenetrable\r\ngray. Towards the north stretch the endless lanes with their bare\r\nbranches which lead to the islands. This is the Bois de Boulogne of St.\r\nPetersburg, where the gilded youth race in brightly decorated \"troikas,\"\r\nand hasten to squander in champagne, at cards, and in gypsy\r\nentertainments, the wages of the starved muzhik. It is a magnificent\r\npicture of power, of self-conscious riches, the better part of which is\r\nfurnished by the mighty stream itself.\r\n\r\nIt is easy now to realize that St. Petersburg was originally planned\r\nfor a seaport, and that it therefore presents its glittering front to\r\nthe sea. The railroads which conduct the traffic to-day could no longer\r\npenetrate with their stations into the city proper; hence the visitors\r\nmust first pass through the broad, melancholy suburban girdle which\r\ngives one the impression of a giant village. When access to the city was\r\nstill by boat from the Gulf of Finland, the landing at the \"English\r\nquay,\" with its view of all these colossal structures, golden domes and\r\nspires, must have created a powerful impression. Nothing less was\r\ncontemplated by this massing of palaces. The capital and residence city\r\nwas not intended to facilitate the access of the West but rather to\r\ninspire it with awe.\r\n\r\nThe splendor of the city naturally becomes gradually diminished from the\r\nbanks of the Neva towards the vast periphery. The main artery of traffic\r\nin St. Petersburg, the \"Nevski Prospect,\" and its continuation, the\r\n\"Bolshaya Morskaya,\" remain stately and impressive to their very end. A\r\npeculiar feature of St. Petersburg is the numerous canals which begin\r\nand end at the Neva, and which once served to drain the swampy soil of\r\nthe city. They are now to be filled, for they do not answer the purpose.\r\nNevertheless, they offer meanwhile an opportunity for pretty bridge\r\nstructures, as, for instance, the one leading over the Fontanka,\r\nornamented with the four groups of the horse-tamers by Baron Klodt. A\r\ncomparison with the lagoon city, Venice, would really be a flattering\r\nhyperbole, for one does not get the impression here of being on the sea,\r\nas in the case of the \"Canal-Grande.\" The city rather reminds one of the\r\nmodels that were nearer to its founder, the canal-furrowed cities of\r\nHolland. Still, these canals are a pleasant diversion in the otherwise\r\nmonotonous pictures of the city streets.\r\n\r\nShould it be mentioned here that St. Petersburg has its \"millionnaya\"\r\n(millionaire's street)? It is well known that hither and towards Moscow\r\nflow the treasures of a country squeezed dry. The great wealth of the\r\none almost presupposes the nameless misery of the other. The\r\nindifference with which the shocking famine conditions of entire\r\nprovinces and the threatening economic collapse of the whole empire are\r\nregarded here finds its explanation only in the bearing of these\r\nboyar-millionaires, who consider themselves Europeans because their\r\nvalets are shaved in the English fashion.\r\n\r\nThe eye of the stranger who wishes to understand, and not merely to\r\ngaze, will rather turn to other phenomena more characteristic than\r\nsplendid buildings of the country and its people.\r\n\r\nThere is, in the first place, the pope (priest), and then the policeman.\r\n\r\nThe priests and the policemen are the handsomest persons in St.\r\nPetersburg. Although the flowing hair of the bearded priest, reaching to\r\nhis shoulders, is not to be regarded as a characteristic peculiarity,\r\nsince every third man in Russia displays long hair or profuse locks that\r\nwould undoubtedly draw to their fortunate possessor in our land the\r\nattention of the street boys, still they are carefully chosen human\r\nmaterial, tall, graceful men with handsome heads and proud mien.\r\nNotwithstanding this they are accorded but little reverence even among\r\nthe bigoted Russians, for no matter how often and copiously these may\r\ncross themselves before every sacred image, they quite often experience,\r\nbehind the priest, a sort of salvation which compels them suddenly to\r\nempty their mouths in a very demonstrative manner. This may be due to\r\nvarious kinds of superstition, which regard the meeting with a priest as\r\nvery undesirable, but it finds its explanation also in the not always\r\nexemplary life of this servant of the Lord. He is especially accredited\r\nwith a decided predilection for various distilled liquors that at times\r\nexert a doubtful influence on a man's behavior. One may see in St.\r\nPetersburg men wrapped in costly sable furs make the acquaintance of the\r\nstreet pavements, especially during the \"butter-week,\" yet for spiritual\r\ngarments the gutter is even less a place of legitimate rest, and, at any\r\nrate, it is difficult to acknowledge as the appointed interpreter of\r\nGod's will a man whose mouth savors of an entirely different spirit than\r\nthe \"spiritus sanctus.\"\r\n\r\nFor all this, however, the Russian is filled, outwardly at least, and\r\nduring divine services, with a devotion which, to us, is scarcely\r\ncomprehensible. With fanatical fervor he kisses in church the hand of\r\nthe same priest behind whose back he spat at the church door. His body\r\nnever rests. As with the orthodox Jew and the howling dervish, his\r\npraying consists in an almost unceasing bowing, and a not at all\r\ninconsiderable application of gymnastics. He is perpetually crossing\r\nhimself. Particularly fervent suppliants, of the female gender\r\nespecially, can hardly satisfy themselves by kissing again and again the\r\nstone flags of the floor, the hem of the priest's coat, the sacred\r\nimages, and the numberless relics. But how effective and mind-ensnaring\r\nis the orthodox church service. The glimmer of the innumerable small and\r\nlarge wax candles brought by most of the congregants fills the golden\r\nmist of the place with an unearthly light. Rubies, emeralds, and\r\ndiamonds shine from the silver and gold crowns on the sacred images. The\r\ngigantic priest in his gold-embroidered vestments lets sound his deep,\r\npowerful, bass voice, and wonderful choirs answer him from both sides of\r\nthe \"ikonostas.\" Clouds of incense float through the high nave. The\r\nfaithful, ranged one after another, intoxicate and carry one another by\r\ntheir devotion--a huge general hypnosis in which education and priestly\r\nart are equally concerned. The orthodox cult is not to be compared, at\r\nleast in my opinion, with that of the Roman Catholics in the depth and\r\nnobility of the music and in the artistic arrangement of the service.\r\nBut in its archaic monotony, in its use of the coarsest material\r\nstimuli, it is perhaps even more suggestive for the Eastern masses than\r\nis the other for the civilized peoples of the West. The quantity of\r\ngold, silver, and precious stones offered up, especially in the Isaac\r\ncathedral and in the Kazan cathedral--fashioned after that of St.\r\nPeter's in Rome--to give the faithful a conception of the just claims of\r\nHeaven on treasure and reverence, is beyond the belief of Europeans. The\r\nartistically excellent silver ornaments of the Isaac cathedral weigh not\r\nless than eleven thousand kilograms. A single copy of the New Testament\r\nis bound in twenty kilograms of gold. The sacred image made in\r\ncommemoration of the catastrophe of Borki is almost entirely covered\r\nwith diamonds. These endowments came, for the most part, from members of\r\nthe imperial house. The union of church and state is more intimate here\r\nthan elsewhere, and, apparently, even more profitable for the guardians\r\nof the altar. Among all the sacred relics and trophies of the St.\r\nPetersburg church, one impresses the foreigner above the others. It is a\r\ncollection of silver gifts from the French, ranged along the wall of the\r\nPeter-and-Paul cathedral. By the side of the coffins of the Russian\r\nemperors and empresses, from Peter the Great to Alexander III., which\r\none cannot pass without a peculiar feeling of historical respect, under\r\ninnumerable flags and war trophies, there stand, as the greatest triumph\r\nthat the despotic barbarian state has won from civilized Europe, the\r\nsilver crowns and the shields of honor which Félix Faure,\r\nCasimir-Périer, the senate, the chamber, and the Parisian press\r\npresented to the Russian ally of France.\r\n\r\n\"You see here the greatest misfortune that has befallen us in this\r\ncentury,\" said my companion, an orthodox Russian of nothing less than\r\nradical views. \"Until then, until this alliance, with all our\r\nboastfulness we still felt some shame before Europe for our barbarous\r\nand shameful rule. But since the most distinguished men and corporations\r\nof the most enlightened republic have begun prostrating themselves\r\nbefore us, the knout despotism has received the consecration of Europe\r\nand has thrown all shame to the winds.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the French have lent you eight milliards for it,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"A part of which has gone into Heaven knows whose pockets; the other\r\nsupports our police against us, and the remainder was sunk in a\r\nworthless railroad, while we, in order to provide the interest, must\r\ntake the horse from our peasant's plough and the cow from its stable,\r\nuntil even that shall come to an end, for nothing else will be left for\r\nthe executor.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Jesuit trick,\" I said. \"You owe the alliance to the diplomacy of\r\nRampolla.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sword and the holy-water sprinkler,\" answered the Russian, as he\r\npointed his hand in a circle from the war trophies to the \"ikonostas,\"\r\n\"they go everywhere hand-in-hand and enslave and plunder the nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaden, snowy skies looked down on us oppressively as with a deep\r\nshudder at the prison gratings of the Peter-and-Paul fortress we\r\nhastened back to the city. I heard in my mind the notes of the\r\n\"Marseillaise,\" and before my eyes there stood the gifts of honor from\r\nthe French nation brought to the despot of the fortress. They are very\r\nnear each other, cathedral and prison. In the still of the night the\r\nwatchman of the French offerings may often hear the groans and the\r\ndespairing cries of the poor souls who had dreamed of freedom and\r\nbrotherhood and had paid for their dreams behind the heavy iron bars,\r\ndeep under the mirror-like surface of the Neva, in the dungeons of the\r\nPeter-and-Paul fortress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nARTIST AND PROFESSOR--ILYA RYEPIN\r\n\r\n\r\nShould some one assert that there is a great artist in a European\r\ncapital, honored by an entire nation as its very greatest master, yet,\r\nnevertheless, not even known by name among the great European public, we\r\nshould shake our heads unbelievingly, for such a phenomenon is\r\nimpossible in our age of railroads and printer's-ink. And yet this\r\nassertion would be literally true. There is such a great artist living\r\nin a city of a million inhabitants, and recognized by millions, yet of\r\nhis works even art-students outside of Russia have seen but one or two.\r\nTo make this even more incomprehensible, it should be stated that this\r\nartist had attained renown in his country not merely a few years ago,\r\nbut has created masterpiece after masterpiece for more than thirty\r\nyears; indeed, his first picture at the world's fair in Vienna in 1873\r\nwas generally recognized as startling. Nevertheless, the name of the\r\nmaster has long been forgotten on our side of the Vistula; it may be\r\nbecause no one found it to his interest to advertise him and thus to\r\ncreate competition for others, but more probably because Russia is a\r\nseparate world and isolates itself from the rest of Europe with almost\r\nbarbaric insolence.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, some advantage for Russia in this isolation from the\r\n\"rotten West.\" They are not obliged to pass through all the various\r\nphases of our so-called art movement, and therefore are not carried from\r\none extreme to the other, but calmly pursue their own quiet way. They\r\nalso had the good-fortune, while the rest of Europe was in a state of\r\nconflict over unfruitful theories, to possess really great creative\r\nartists, always the best antidote against doctrinarianism. When the\r\none-sided, methodically proletarian naturalism reigned in the West,\r\nitself a protest against the shallow idealistic formalism of the\r\npreceding decades, Russian literature possessed its greatest realistic\r\npoets, Tolstoï, Turgenyev, Dostoyevski, who never overlooked the inner\r\nprocess, the true themes of poetical creation, for the sake of outward\r\nappearances, and have thereby created that incomparable, physiological\r\nrealism that we still lack. And because their great realists were poets,\r\ngreat poets and geniuses, they felt no need of a new drawing-room art,\r\nwhich of necessity goes to the other extreme, the romantic,\r\naristocratic, catholic. They had no Zola, and therefore they needed no\r\nMaeterlinck. And it was exactly so with their painting. Their great\r\nartists did not lose themselves, like Manet and his school, in problems\r\npurely of light and air without poetical contents; hence to rediscover\r\npoetry and to save it for art there was no need for Preraphaelites or\r\nDecadents. The great painter is artist, man, and poet, a phenomenon like\r\nLeo Tolstoï, therefore the few symbolists who believe they must imitate\r\nEuropean fashions make no headway against them.\r\n\r\nImitators can only exist among imitators, by the side of nature's\r\nimitators, imitators of Raphael's predecessors.\r\n\r\nA single true artist frightens away all the ghosts of the night, and\r\nthus decadence plays an insignificant rôle alongside of Tolstoï and\r\nRyepin, whether it be the decadent literature of Huysmans and\r\nMaeterlinck, or the decadence of the Neoromanticists and of the\r\nNeoidealists.\r\n\r\nIt is time, however, to speak of the artist himself, an artist of sixty,\r\nstill in the fulness of power, who, besides wielding the brush, occupies\r\na professor's chair at the St. Petersburg Academy. I have just called\r\nhim professor. He is more than that, he is, like Leo Tolstoï, a\r\nrevolutionist, the terrible accuser of the two diabolical forces that\r\nkeep the nation in its course, the church and the despotism of\r\ngovernment. But, to the honor of the Russian dynasty be it said, this\r\nartist, acknowledged to be the greatest of his country, was never\r\n\"induced\" to cast aside the criticism of the prevailing system he made\r\nby his painting and to engage in the decorative court art. His so-called\r\nnihilist pictures, reproduction of which has been prohibited by the\r\npolice, are for the most part in the possession of grand-dukes, and,\r\nnotwithstanding his undisguised opinions, he was intrusted with the\r\npainting of the imperial council representing the Czar in the midst of\r\nhis councillors. The czars have always been more liberal than their\r\nadministrators. Nicholas I. prized Gogol's \"Revizor\" above all else, and\r\nNicholas II. is the greatest admirer of Tolstoï. And so Ryepin may paint\r\nwhatever and however he will. And we shall see that he makes proper use\r\nof this opportunity. He is Russian, and nothing but Russian. At\r\ntwenty-two he received for his work, \"The Awakening of Jairus's Little\r\nDaughter,\" an academic prize and a travelling fellowship for a number of\r\nyears. But before the expiration of the appointed time spent by him in\r\nBerlin and Paris he returned to Russia, and produced in 1873 his\r\n\"Burlaks\" (barge-towers), which attracted great attention at the Vienna\r\nexposition. The thirty years that have passed since then have detracted\r\nnothing from the painting. How far surpassed do Manet's\r\n\"revolutionizing\" works already appear to us, and still how indelibly\r\nfresh these \"barge-towers.\" That is so. The reason is simple--it is no\r\npainting of theory but of nature represented as the individual sees it,\r\nthe masterly impression of an artist, the most concentrated effect of\r\nlandscape, light, and action. The purely technical problem is\r\nsubordinated to the whole, to the unity of action and mood, solved\r\nnaturally and easily. The problem of the artist to tell us what we\r\ncannot forget, to give us something of his soul, his sentiments, his\r\nthoughts, is of first importance, just as geniuses of all ages cared\r\nless to be thought masters of technique than to win friends,\r\nfellow-thinkers, and comrades, to share their joys and feelings. From\r\nthe purely technical stand-point, where is there a painting that\r\npresents in a more masterly manner the glimmer of sunlight on the\r\nsurface of a broad stream--as in this case--and where, nevertheless, the\r\nlandscape is treated merely as the background? And again, where is the\r\naction of twelve men wearily plodding onward, drawing with rhythmic step\r\nthe boat against the stream, seized more forcibly, more suggestively\r\nthan in this plaintive song of the Russian people's soul?\r\n\r\nThe youth of barely twenty-four years had at one leap placed himself at\r\nthe head of all contemporary artists. Analogies between him and the\r\nartistic career and method of Leo Tolstoï force themselves on us again\r\nand again. Tolstoï's _Sketches from the Caucasus_, _Sevastopol_,\r\n_Cossacks_, are his early works, yet they are the most wonderful that\r\nthe entire prose of all literature can show. And so it is in this\r\nlifelike picture of a twenty-four-year-old youth. Had we no other work\r\nof his than the \"Barge-towers,\" we should yet see in him a great master.\r\nIt is but necessary to look at the feet of these twelve wretched toilers\r\nto realize with wonder the characterization, the full measure of which\r\nis given only to genius. How they strain against the ground and almost\r\ndig into the rock! How the bodies are bent forward in the broad belt\r\nthat holds the tow-line! What an old, sad melody is this to which these\r\nbare-footed men keep step as they struggle up along the stream? In all\r\nhis barefoot stories of the ancient sorrow of the steppe children, Gorki\r\nhas not painted with greater insight. A sorrowful picture for all its\r\nsunshine, and the more sorrowful because no tendency is made evident. It\r\nmeans seeing, seeing with the eyes and with the heart, and, therefore,\r\nit is art.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong, however, to say that Ryepin--in his works as a whole\r\nif not in a given instance--has introduced a \"tendency\" in his choice of\r\nsolely sorrowful subjects. Such is not the case. There is nothing more\r\nexuberant, more convulsing than his large painting, \"Cossacks Preparing\r\na Humorous Reply to a Threatening Letter of Mohammed III.\" The answer\r\ncould not have been very respectful. That may be seen from the sarcastic\r\nexpression of the intelligent scribe as well as from the effect that his\r\nwit has on the martial environment. A be-mustached old fellow in a white\r\nlamb-skin cap holds his big belly for laughing; another almost falls\r\nover backward, his bald pate quite jumping out of the canvas. One snaps\r\nhis fingers; another, old and toothless, grins with joy; a third pounds\r\nwith clinched fist on the almost bare back of his neighbor; another\r\nshuts his right eye as if perceiving a doubtful odor; one with a great\r\ntooth-gap shouts aloud, while others smile in quiet joy through the\r\nsmoke of their short pipes. All these are crowded around a primitive\r\nwooden table scarcely a metre wide; twenty figures, a natural group, one\r\nhead hiding another, and with all you have an unobstructed view of the\r\ncamp lying bright in the sunshine and dust and full of horses and men.\r\nThe effect of the picture is so overpowering that at the mere\r\nrecollection of it you can scarcely refrain from joining in the hearty\r\nlaughter of these sturdy, untutored natures. In the entire range of\r\nmodern painting there is no other picture so full of the strong joy of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\"The Village Procession,\" preserved in the Tretyakov Gallery in\r\nMoscow--the finest collection of the master's works--is not gloomy like\r\nthe mournful song of the \"Barge-towers,\" nor exuberant with serf\r\narrogance and vitality like the Cossack camp, but a fragment of the\r\ncolorless Russian national life as it really is, a sorrowful human\r\ndocument for the thoughtful observer alone. Tattered muzhiks in fur\r\ncoats are carrying on poles a heavy sacred image, and behind them crowds\r\nthe village populace with flags and crucifixes. I will not again\r\nemphasize how masterfully everything is noted here, from the gold border\r\nof the sacred image to the last bit of dusty sunshine on the village\r\nstreet. Absolute mastery is self-evident in Ryepin's work. We are again\r\nattracted in this picture by the great intensity of mood. What harmony\r\nthere is in it--the mounted gendarme who pitilessly strikes with his\r\nknout into the peasant group to make room for the priests and the local\r\nofficials; the half-idiotic, greasy sexton; the well-fed, bearded\r\npriest; the crowd of the abandoned, the crippled, and the maimed, the\r\nbrutalized peasants, the old women. A long procession of folly,\r\nbrutality, official darkness, ignorance; a chapter from the might of\r\ndarkness; the crucifix misused as an aid to the knout, a symbol of the\r\nRussian régime that could not be held up to scorn more passionately by\r\nany demagogue; and yet only a street-scene which would hardly strike the\r\nMoscow merchant when strolling in the gallery of a Sunday, because of\r\nits freedom from any \"tendency.\"\r\n\r\nThen comes a work of an entirely different character, a tragedy of\r\nShakespearean force, a painting that is red on red. Ivan the Terrible\r\nholds in his arms the son he has just stricken to death with his heavy\r\nstaff. It is a horrible scene from which one turns because of the almost\r\nunbearable misery depicted there, and yet you return to it again and\r\nagain. So great is the conception, so wonderful the insight, so\r\nincomparable the technique. The madman, whom a nation of slaves endures\r\nas its master, is at last overtaken by Nemesis, and he is truly an\r\nobject for pity as he crouches on the ground with the body of his dying\r\nson in his arms. He would stanch the blood that is streaming from the\r\ngaping wound to the red carpet. He kisses the hair where but a moment\r\nbefore his club had struck. The tears flow from his horrified eyes, and\r\ntheir terror is augmented, for at this last and perhaps first caress of\r\nthe terrible father a happy smile plays on the face of the dying son. He\r\nhad killed his son! Nothing can save him! He the Czar of Moscow, the\r\nmaster of the Kremlin, can do nothing. He draws his son to himself,\r\npresses him to his breast, to his lips. What had he done in his anger,\r\nthat anger so often a source of joy to him when he struck others less\r\nnear to him and for which he had been lauded by his servile courtiers,\r\nsince the Czar must be stern, a terrible and unrelenting master?\r\n\r\nShakespeare has nothing more thrilling than this single work, its effect\r\nso tragic because the artist has succeeded in awakening our pity for\r\nthis fiend, pity which is the deliverance from hatred and resentment.\r\nThe pity that seizes us is identical with the awe of the deepest faith,\r\nthe feeling of Christian forgiveness. We can have no resentment towards\r\nthis sorrow-crushed old man with the torn, thin, white hair. And we can\r\nnever quite forget the look in these glassy old eyes from which the\r\nbitter tears are gushing, the first that the monster had ever shed. And\r\nhow the picture is painted, the red of the blood contrasting with the\r\nred of the Persian rug and the green-red of the tapestry. Nothing else\r\nis seen on the floor except an overturned chair. The figures of the\r\nfather, and of the son raising himself for the last time, alone in all\r\nthe vast space, hold the gaze of the spectator. With this painting\r\nhanging in the ruler's palace the death-sentence would never be signed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nStill another ghastly picture shows that the artist, like all great\r\nmasters, is not held back by affectation and feels equal to any\r\nemergency. It represents Sophia, the sister of Peter the Great, who from\r\nher prison is made to witness the hanging of her faithful \"streltzy\"\r\n(sharp-shooters) before her windows. It was a brotherly mark of\r\nconsideration shown her by the Czar. The resemblance of the princess to\r\nher brother is striking; but the expression of pain, anger, and fear on\r\nthe stony face turned green and yellow is really terrifying. But it is\r\nalso characteristic of the great master to have chosen just that\r\nincident in the life of the great Czar.\r\n\r\nIn general it must be said that for a professor in the imperial academy\r\nthe choice of historical subjects is curious enough. It certainly does\r\nnot indicate loyalty.\r\n\r\nI could not if I would discuss in detail the fruits of thirty years of\r\nthe artist's activity. Besides, mere words cannot give an adequate idea\r\nof the beauty of his works. But there is one thing that may be\r\naccomplished by the description of his most important painting--namely,\r\nthe refutation of the absurd notion that the artist and his art can\r\nbecome important only when they are entirely indifferent to the joys and\r\nsorrows of their fellow-men and concern solely the solution of artistic\r\nproblems. The doctrine of art for art's sake has no more determined\r\nopponents than the great artists of our time, and among them also Ryepin\r\nin the front rank. He is willing to subscribe to it just as far as\r\nevery artist must seek to influence only by means of his own peculiar\r\nart; yet he rejects the absurdity that it is immaterial for the\r\ngreatness of the artist whether he depicts the essence of a great, rich,\r\nand deep mind or only that of a commonplace mind. According to him only\r\na great man that is a warm-hearted, upright, and courageous man can\r\nbecome a great artist; and he regards it as the first duty of such to\r\nshare the life of their fellow-men, to honor the man even in the\r\nhumblest fellow-being, and to strengthen with all their might the call\r\nfor freedom and humanity as long as it remains unheeded by the powerful.\r\nJust like Tolstoï, he has only a deep contempt for the exalted decadents\r\nwho, with their exclusive and affected morality, would attack nations\r\nfighting for their freedom. Like every independent thinker, he is\r\ndisgusted with the modern epidemic of individualism, and his sympathies\r\nbelong to the progressive movement derided by the fools of fashion. To\r\nbe sure, that does not make him greater as artist, for artistic\r\ngreatness has absolutely nothing to do with party affiliations; neither\r\ndoes it make him less, for his artistic achievements are not at all\r\nlessened by his giving us sentiments as well as images. But if a humane,\r\naltruistic, cultured man who finds joy in progress stands ethically\r\nhigher than the exclusive, narrow-minded reactionary or self-sufficient,\r\nsurfeited decadent, then Ryepin is worth more than the idols of snobs.\r\nAnd not as man only; he also stands higher as artist, for he gives\r\nexpression with at least the same mastery, and, in truth, with an\r\nincomparably greater mastery, to the ideals of a more noble, greater,\r\nand richer mind. The belief that participation in the struggles and\r\nmovements of the day affects the artist unfavorably is ridiculed by him;\r\nthe contrary is true in his case. It has given him an abundance of\r\nstriking themes as well as the duel and nihilist cycles.\r\n\r\nI will pass by the duel cycle culminating in the powerfully portrayed\r\nsuffering of the repenting victor. For us the nihilist cycle is more\r\ninteresting, more Russian. \"Nihilist\" is, by-the-way, an abominable name\r\nfor those noble young men and women who, staking their lives, go out\r\namong the common people to redeem them from their greatest\r\nenemies--ignorance and immorality. The real nihilists in Russia are\r\nthose of the government who are not held back even by murder when it is\r\nof service to the system, the cynics with the motto, \"Après nous le\r\ndéluge\"; surely not these noble-hearted dreamers who throw down the\r\ngauntlet to the all-powerful Holy Synod and to the not less powerful\r\nholy knout.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the \"well-disposed\" portion of Russian society had\r\nturned away in honor from the Russian youth because a few fanatics had\r\nbelieved that they could more quickly attain their aims by the\r\npropaganda of action than by the fully as dangerous and difficult work\r\namong the people, Ryepin painted his cycle which explains why among the\r\nyoung people there were a few who resorted to murder. Who does not know\r\nfrom the Russian novels those meetings of youths who spent half the\r\nnight at the steaming samovar discussing the liberation of the people\r\nand the struggle against despotism, in debates that have no other result\r\nthan a heavy head and an indefinite desire for self-sacrifice? The cycle\r\nbegins with such a discussion. Men and women students are gathered\r\ntogether, unmistakably Russian, all of them, Slavic types, the women\r\nwith short hair, the men mostly bearded and with long hair. In the smoky\r\nroom, imperfectly lighted by the lamp, they are listening to a fiery\r\nyoung orator. We find this young man again as village teacher in the\r\nsecond picture. He had gone among the people. In one of the following\r\npictures he has already been informed against, and the police search\r\nthrough his books and find forbidden literature. The police spy and\r\ninformer, who triumphantly brings the package to light, is pictured to\r\nhis very finger-tips as the gentleman that he is. In still another\r\npicture the young martyr is already sitting between gendarmes on his way\r\nto Siberia; and in the last he returns home old and broken, recognized\r\nwith difficulty by his family, whom he surprises in the simple room. One\r\nmay see this cycle in the Tretyakov Gallery, and copies of it in the\r\npossession of a few private individuals, persons in high authority, who\r\nare above fear of the police; and one is reminded of the saying so\r\noften heard in Russia, \"We are governed by the scoundrels, and our\r\nupright men are languishing in the prisons.\" The nihilist has the\r\nfeatures of Dostoyevski who was so broken in Siberia that he thanked the\r\nCzar, on his return, for his well-deserved punishment, and who had\r\nbecome a mystic and a reactionary. In another picture a young nihilist\r\non his way to the scaffold is being offered the consolation of religion\r\nby the priest, but he harshly motions him back.\r\n\r\nAll these pictures are homely in their treatment. The poverty of the\r\ninterior, the inspired faces of the noble dreamers, and the brutal and\r\nstupid faces of the authorities speak for themselves clearly enough, and\r\nno theatrical effects of composition are necessary to impart the proper\r\nmood to the observer. On the contrary, it is just this discretion, the\r\nalmost Uhde-like simplicity that is so effective. Yet Pobydonostzev and\r\nPlehve will scarcely thank the artist for these works that for\r\ngenerations will awaken hatred against the system among all\r\nbetter-informed young men. However, their reproduction is prohibited.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the drawings which Ryepin made for popular Russian\r\nliterature are circulated by hundreds of thousands among the people. It\r\nis an undertaking initiated by Leo Tolstoï with the aid of several\r\nphilanthropists, for combating bad popular literature. It is under the\r\nexcellent management of Gorbunov in Moscow. There are annually placed\r\namong the people about two millions of books, ranging in price from one\r\nto twenty kopeks. It may be taken for granted that the men who enjoy\r\nTolstoï's confidence will not be a party to barbarism. The foremost\r\nartists supply the sketches for the title-pages, among them Ryepin, the\r\nfiery Tolstoïan. Ryepin's admiration for the great poet of the Russian\r\nsoil is also evident from his numerous pictures of Tolstoï. He has\r\npainted the saint of Yasnaya Polyana at least a dozen times--at his\r\nworking-table; in the park reclining under a tree and reading after his\r\nswim; a bare-footed disciple of Kneipp; or following the plough, with\r\nflowing beard, his powerful hand resting on the plough-handle. All are\r\nmasterly portraits, and, above all things, they reflect the\r\nall-embracing kindness that shines in the blue eyes of the poet--eyes\r\nthat one can never forget when their kindly light has once shone upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in Russia has been particularly engrossed with a recent\r\npicture which furnishes much food for reflection. Two young people, a\r\nstudent clad in the Russian student uniform and a young gentlewoman with\r\nhat and muff, step out hand-in-hand from a rock right into the raging\r\nsea. What is the meaning of it? The triumphant young faces, the\r\noutstretched arms of the student exclude the thought of suicide. It has\r\nbeen suggested that it is an illustration of the Russian saying, \"To the\r\ncourageous the sea is only knee-deep.\" But in that case it would mean,\r\n\"Have courage, young people; do not fear the conflict; for you the sea\r\nis only knee-deep.\" But it could also be interpreted, \"Madmen, what are\r\nyou doing? Do you not see that this is the terrible, relentless sea into\r\nwhich you would step?\" In that case it would be a warning intended for\r\nthe Russian youth, revolutionary throughout, who would dare anything.\r\nThis much is certain: the greatest Russian painter, and one of the\r\ngreatest of contemporary painters, is on the side of these young people,\r\nand his heart is with them even though he may doubt, as many another,\r\nthe success of the heroic self-sacrifice. The noble ideals of youth\r\ncannot conquer this sea of ignorance and slave-misery. Great and\r\nimmeasurable as is the Russian nation, nothing can help the country. It\r\nmust and will collapse within itself, and then will come the hour of\r\nrelease for all, whether noble or poor, to whom the Ryepins and the Leo\r\nTolstoïs have dedicated their incomparably great works. Perhaps this\r\nhour is nearer than is suspected. Russian soil is already groaning under\r\nthe March storms which precede every spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE HERMITAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curious conception of Tolstoï's as to the severing and injurious\r\ninfluence of art that does not strive directly to make people more\r\nnoble, can perhaps be understood only when the collections in the St.\r\nPetersburg Hermitage and Alexander Museum are examined. Striking proof\r\nwill there be found that the enjoyment of art--nay, the understanding of\r\nit--need not necessarily go hand-in-hand with humane and moral\r\nsentiments. Antiquity and the Renaissance prove that, under certain\r\nconditions, inhumanity and scandalous immorality can harmonize very well\r\nwith the understanding of art, or with, at least, a great readiness to\r\nmake sacrifices for the sake of it. The inference that the greater\r\nrefinement of the taste for art is the cause of moral degeneration is\r\nnot far from the truth. It is quite conceivable from the stand-point of\r\nan essentially revolutionary philosophy, framed for the struggle against\r\nthe demoralizing, violent government of St. Petersburg, since everything\r\nthat is apparently entitled to respect in this St. Petersburg is\r\nunveiled and damned in its nothingness. Thus it is with science--that\r\nis to say, a university that does not begin its work by denouncing a\r\ndespotism only seemingly favorable to civilization; so it is with a\r\nfancy for art, which possibly may convince czars and their servants that\r\nthey also have contributed their mite towards the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe stranger who does not see things with the eyes of the passionate\r\nphilanthropist and patriot, and who when gazing at the master-works of\r\nart, does not necessarily think of the depravity of the gatherers of\r\nthese works, is surely permitted to disregard the association of ideas\r\nbetween art and morality, and to give himself over unconstrainedly to\r\nthe enjoyment of collections that can hold their own with the best\r\nmuseums of the world. To be sure, Catherine II. was not an exemplary\r\nempress or woman, yet by her purchases for the Hermitage she rendered a\r\nreal service to her country, a service that will ultimately plead for\r\nher at the judgment-seat of the world's history. Alexander III. and his\r\nhouse were misfortunes for his country, but the museum that bears his\r\nname will keep alive his memory and will cast light of forgiveness on a\r\nsoul enshrouded in darkness. Besides, it has nowhere been shown that\r\nwithout the diversion of expensive tastes for art, slovenly empresses\r\nwould have been less slovenly or dull despots less violent. But in the\r\nHermitage one may forget for a couple of hours that he is in the capital\r\nof the most unfortunate and the most wretchedly governed of all\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it is impossible to give in a mere description an\r\nadequate conception of the great mass of masterpieces here gathered\r\ntogether. I shall attempt, in the following, to seize only a few meagre\r\nrays of the brightest solitaires.\r\n\r\nBorne by the one-story high--entirely too high--naked Atlas of polished\r\nblack granite, there rises the side roof of the Hermitage over a terrace\r\nof the \"millionnaya\" (millionaires' street). We enter the dark, high\r\nentrance-hall, from which a high marble staircase, between polished\r\nwalls, leads to a pillared hall, already seen from below. The\r\nattendants, in scarlet uniforms, jokingly known at the court as\r\n\"lobsters,\" officiously relieve us of our fur coats, and we hasten into\r\nthe long ground floor, where await us the world-famous antiquities from\r\nKertch, in the Crimea. Unfortunately, there awaits us also a sad\r\ndisappointment. The high walls are so dark, even in the middle of the\r\ngray winter day, that the beauty of the many charming miniatures must be\r\nsurmised rather than felt. We could see scarcely anything of the great\r\ncollection of vases. We breathe with relief when we at last enter a hall\r\nthat has light and air, now richly rewarded for our Tantalus-like\r\nsufferings in the preceding rooms. Here glitter the gold laurel and\r\nacorn crowns that once adorned proud Greek foreheads; there sparkles the\r\ngold-braided border with which the Greek woman trimmed her garments,\r\nrepresenting in miniature relief lions' and rams' heads. The gold\r\nbracelets and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches tell us that there is\r\nnothing new under the sun. Before the birth of Christ there were worn in\r\nChersonesus the same patterns that are now designed anew by diligent\r\nartistic craftsmen--nay, even vases and tumblers, the creations of the\r\nmost modern individualities, had already lain buried under the rubbish\r\nof thousands of years. Our attention is drawn to a vase in a separate\r\ncase, which gives an excellent representation of the progress of a\r\nbride's toilet from the bath to its finishing touches ready for the\r\nbridegroom's reception. Who knows what scene of domestic happiness was\r\ninvolved in the presentation of this gift thousands of years ago!\r\nSensations which one experiences only in the streets and houses of\r\nPompeii are renewed here while looking at the glass cases with their\r\ncollections of ornaments and of articles of utility that tell us of the\r\nrefined pleasures and the exquisite taste of times long gone by. The\r\nwaves of the Black Sea played about Greek patrician houses where to-day\r\nthe rugged Cossack rides with the knout in his hand. A great hall shows\r\nus finally the Olympian Zeus with the eagles at his feet, also with the\r\nsoaring Nike in his right hand. Klinger's \"Beethoven\" reminds us\r\ninvoluntarily of this lofty work without attaining its majesty. A\r\ntorch-bearer, a mighty caryatid of Praxiteles with a truly wonderful\r\ndraping of the garments, a Dionysus of the fourth century, an Omphale\r\nclad in the attributes of Hercules, sarcophagi with masterly reliefs, a\r\ndivine Augustus, portrait busts of satyrs, entitle this collection to\r\nrank with that of the Vatican, not in numbers, but in the great worth of\r\nsingle works. But our wonder and admiration become greater when we enter\r\nthe splendid halls of the picture-gallery. We hasten past Canova and\r\nHoudon, however; the graceful figures of the one and the characteristic\r\n\"Voltaire\" of the other had attracted us at other times. On to Murillo,\r\nRembrandt, Rubens, Titian, to be presented to us in unusual\r\ncompleteness. Twenty-two Murillos, the finest of them carried away by\r\nthe French from Madrid, wrapped around flag-staffs. I must confess that\r\nI had not hitherto fully comprehended Murillo's fame, for I am not\r\nacquainted with the Spanish galleries. It was only in St. Petersburg\r\nthat the full greatness of the master dawned upon me. No description can\r\ngive an adequate idea of the charm of the Virgin Mother in the two\r\ngray-walled pictures of \"The Conception\" and \"The Assumption.\" What\r\ndistinguishes it from the famous Louvre picture is, above all, the\r\nchildlike expression of the sweet girl's head. A Mignon as Mary! The\r\ndark eyes looking up to heaven with such inspired enthusiasm; the full\r\ncheeks delicately tinted; the light garment of the maiden, almost a\r\nchild, enfolding it chastely; the entire figure, to the blue, loosely\r\nfluttering cloak bathed in light; the cupids crowding about the knees\r\nand carrying her heavenward; sweet rogues on the cloud wall, a part\r\nstill in the light radiated by her, and a part already immersed in the\r\ndeep darkness of space--the whole sublime, as on the first day of\r\ncreation, no note failing in the Spaniard's full glow of color.\r\n\r\nNo less splendid and inspired is \"Repose During the Flight to Egypt,\"\r\nwhere the mother of the Lord again awakens the most fervent sensations.\r\nShe is no longer the half-childlike virgin of the Conception and the\r\nAssumption; she is the mother, tenderly and rapturously gazing at the\r\nsleeping child surrounded by a halo of heavenly light. Angels crowd\r\nforward in naïve curiosity; the saintly Joseph looks with emotion on the\r\ncontented infant; the thick foliage gives to the entire group shade and\r\ncoolness. Even the ass looks comfortable and pious. The color and\r\ncomposition are entirely beyond comparison.\r\n\r\nA painting brimful of roguishness is \"Jacob's Ladder,\" where angels\r\nascending and descending, making up the dreams of the sleeper, amuse\r\nthemselves in most innocent fashion. Well known is the charming\r\nChrist-Child in the painting of \"St. Joseph,\" and the charming little\r\n\"John\" often fondly painted by him, his arms entwined about his lambkin.\r\nHardy peasant types are not wanting; and that the inspiration of the\r\ngreat Spaniard may not exceed all bounds, there are a few pictures\r\nwhich, with all their artistic excellence make us realize what a chasm\r\nseparates us from the passionate Catholic Murillo. We believe that full\r\nartistic justice may be done to the poetry of Biblical legend without\r\nbeing obliged to glorify a Peter Aubry. However, other lands, other\r\ncustoms!\r\n\r\nOf Velasquez's work there should be mentioned, in the first place, his\r\npaintings of Philip IV. and the Duke of Olivarez, both of striking\r\ncharacterization in their grotesque ugliness--the master will survive\r\neven the one-sided and exclusive cult of which he has been made the\r\nvictim. We will not set our minds against Velasquez's or Leonardo's\r\n\"Mona Lisa\" just because they are to be found in all the exercises of\r\nenraptured modern goslings.\r\n\r\nI will not say anything about the \"Madonna Conestabile,\" the \"St.\r\nGeorge,\" and the wonderful \"Madonna Alba\" of Raphael, for I consider it\r\nentirely superfluous to combat the affected underestimates of the master\r\nof Urbino, which is insisted upon as a matter of party obligation by\r\nevery imitator of fashion. If Herr Muther prescribes the Botticelli cult\r\nfor the last years of one century, the rediscovery of the joyous Andrea\r\ndel Sarto for the first years of a new century, he will, if we live to\r\nsee the day, prescribe for the century noonday the return to the master\r\nof perfection, Raffaelo Sanzio, as the inevitable requirement of\r\nfashion, and his disciples will add here their solemn amen. But the\r\neternal masters are above the gossip of salons and fashions.\r\n\r\nSebastiano del Piombo is represented here by a most extraordinary\r\n\"Descent from the Cross,\" Correggio by the \"Madonna del Latte,\"\r\nLeonardo da Vinci by the light blonde \"Madonna Litta,\" which, like all\r\nthe works of this master, is questioned, but which bears his imprint as\r\nmuch as any of his works. Of Botticelli there is a very well-preserved\r\n\"Adoration of the Magi,\" similar to the Florentine painting. Likewise,\r\nhere in all the minor figures of the kneeling kings and shepherds, and\r\neven of the horses, there is a perfection in the mastery of drawing, the\r\nMadonna archaically overslender, with the thin neck of the Primitivists,\r\nwhich, out of respect for sacred tradition, the otherwise bold master\r\ndid not dare meddle with. Naturally, the modern art mockery sees in this\r\ndefect of Botticelli's, accounted for by respect for tradition, his\r\nchief superiority, and goes into affected raptures at the sensitive\r\nfigures of his \"Primavera,\" and imitates the studied gestures of those\r\nfoolish airs which our higher bourgeoisie affect in order to resemble\r\nthe decadent nobility. But Botticelli really deserves a better fate than\r\nto be the fashion painter of the snobs.\r\n\r\nBronzino's picture of a young woman, with quite modern bronze-colored\r\nhair and exceptionally small hands, might well be substituted, if\r\nfashion chose, for \"Mona Lisa\" in the modern feuilletons. A Renaissance\r\ncould easily dedicate a piquant novel to her dreamy, roguish eyes, her\r\nsoft chin, and her sensual mouth, which would not be contradicted by the\r\nrich pearl ornaments in her hair and ears. There is a Judith by the\r\nhighly beloved master Giorgione, which is far superior in the majesty\r\nof her bearing and the beauty of her head to her sisters of earlier and\r\nlater times. By the side of this noble and historical figure the other\r\nJudith, the creation of the wanton and diseased fancy of Klimt--the\r\notherwise prominent but misguided master--appears absolutely odious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE HERMITAGE--_CONTINUED_\r\n\r\n\r\nA crown of shining jewels is the Titian room, with the Christ, the\r\nCardinal Pallavicini, the Danaë, the Venus, Magdalene, and the Duchess\r\nof Urbino. It is a small cabinet, scarcely measuring five square metres,\r\nin which is gathered more shining beauty than in many an entire museum.\r\nProminent, however, is the fair daughter of Parma, forerunner of the\r\n\"Mona Vanna,\" as Venus dressed, or rather undressed, naked, in a velvet\r\ncloak that kindly fulfils its duty only from the hips downward. The\r\ngoddess gazes at herself in a mirror held by a cupid, while another\r\nchubby little fellow is trying to place a crown on her head. She\r\ndeserves it, this prize of beauty. There radiates from her eyes, her\r\nmouth, her shoulders, arms, and hands a splendor such as even this\r\nprince but seldom gave to his creations. The curves of the breast, only\r\nhalf covered by the left hand, the navel, and the hips are as soft as if\r\npainted with a caressing brush. The heavy velvet cloak intensifies even\r\nthe remarkable brightness of the body. The Danaë, languidly outstretched\r\non the cushions of her luxurious couch, shuddering under the golden\r\nharvest that falls into her lap, is much superior to her rivals in\r\nNaples and Vienna. It is the only original that does not disappoint the\r\nexpectations created by the widely distributed reproductions, for it\r\nalso is perfectly preserved. The line of the back from the shoulder to\r\nthe bent knee of the resting young body is of a unique softness; the\r\ntransition from the thigh to hip is like velvet in the softness of the\r\nbody; the feet and toes are of classic beauty. The Magdalene again is\r\nall feeling. The tears flowing from her eyes, reddened by sorrow, are as\r\nreal as her contrition; the heavy braids, pressed with the right hand to\r\nthe full bosom, enable us to understand her sins; but the penitential\r\ngarment and the desert, where we find her alone with a human skull,\r\ncompel us to believe in her repentance. The artist's model was, as in\r\nthe similar work in Florence, his daughter Lavinia.\r\n\r\nThe school of Leonardo da Vinci is not as well represented; but mention\r\nshould be made here of \"St. Catherine of Luini,\" if only for the sake of\r\nthe saint herself, that is fashioned after the same model as \"St. Anne,\"\r\nby Leonardo. Somewhat better represented is the Venetian school with a\r\nfew Tintorettos and Paolo Veroneses. Of the later Italians, we find\r\nespecially of note, \"Mary in the Sewing-School,\" \"St. Joseph with the\r\nChrist-Child,\" and \"Cleopatra,\" by Guido Reni.\r\n\r\nBut the pride of the collection is the Rembrandt gallery. The so-called\r\n\"Mother of Rembrandt\" is somewhat inferior to the incomparable Vienna\r\npainting. But, on the other hand, there are among the thirty-nine\r\nauthentic works of the master such gems as the \"Descent from the Cross,\"\r\nwith its singular lights and shadows, and \"David and Absalom,\" with\r\nastonishing boldness of sketching and wonderful softness of coloring.\r\nBut far beyond the technique we are struck in this picture by the almost\r\ntragic power of expression. It is the moment of conciliation between\r\nfather and son. How the young prince with luxurious hair hides his\r\ntrembling hand on his father's breast; how the father, who very\r\nstrangely has the features of the master himself, draws to his breast\r\nthe newly found son, and breathes to Jehovah a prayer for blessing. It\r\nis treated with such overpowering mastery as dwells only in the greatest\r\nscenes of fatherly passion in all literature and art. The second\r\ntreatment of the same theme, \"The Prodigal Son,\" is transplanted from\r\nthe princely to the common. The returning son is not a prince; the\r\nfather is not a be-turbaned sultan; but the intensity of the embrace is\r\nthe same; the same thrill comes to us out of this as out of the\r\nbrilliant \"Absalom\" picture, the two songs of the forgiving father's\r\nlove. The counterpart of these two is the painting of the great father's\r\nsorrow that seizes the old Jacob when his sons bring to him the bloody\r\ngarment of his beloved Joseph. The terror and amazement of the\r\npatriarch, distinctly marked in the hands of the sage uplifted as if\r\nwarding off a blow, are strongly impressed on the mind of the beholder.\r\nThe famous \"Sacrifice of Isaac\" is to me of slighter value than the\r\npreceding, notwithstanding all the dramatic force of the moment\r\ndepicted. It is really too difficult for us to look into the soul of an\r\nold fanatic who is ready to slay his own son at the command of God; yet\r\nthe foreshortening of the recumbent Isaac, and the angel sweeping down\r\non him like a tempest, to seize just at the right moment the hand of the\r\nold man, are brought out again with really wanton mastery. The so-called\r\nDanaë is not to every one's taste, its universal fame notwithstanding.\r\nBode takes it as Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, awaiting her betrothed.\r\nIts meaning might well be a subject of discussion. The old woman who\r\ndraws back the heavy drapery over the couch, with the honest\r\nmatch-maker's joy on her face and the purse in her hand, indicates a\r\nmythological incident and not the legitimate joys of Sarah. On the other\r\nhand, there is lacking here the indispensable golden shower by which the\r\nDanaë pictures are really characterized. Besides, the profile of the\r\njoyously surprised naked dame is not all antique. I take the liberty\r\nhumbly to suggest that the young woman with the rather mature body is,\r\nto judge by the ornaments on her arms and in her hair, as well as by the\r\nattributes of her luxurious bed and the unceremoniousness with which she\r\nallows the light to play on her naked body through the open portières\r\nwithout making use of the cover lying near by, to be considered a\r\nprofessional beauty, who is receiving with more than open arms some very\r\nwelcome and generous guest. When once freed from the not exactly\r\npleasing impression which the fidgety impatience produces on the none\r\ntoo pretty face, we cannot but admire the play of light on the nude\r\nbody. Nothing is flattered in this painting, and that makes more\r\nstriking the indelible impression of the shimmering light in all the\r\ndepressions and curves of the not especially attractive figure.\r\n\r\nIt would be much beyond the limits of the present sketch to mention even\r\nby name the works of the first rank in the Rembrandt gallery. Suffice it\r\nto state that there are among them a so-called Sobieski, the portrait of\r\nthe calligrapher Coppenol, almost breathing before one's eyes, the\r\n\"Parable of the Workmen in the Vineyard,\" \"Abraham's Entertainment of\r\nthe Angels,\" a \"Holy Family\" of such loveliness as can scarcely be\r\naccredited to the forceful realist, the \"Workshop of Joseph,\" the\r\n\"Incredulity of St. Thomas,\" full of restless movement, a splendid\r\nheroic \"Pallas,\" portraits of men and women, all of them works of the\r\nfirst rank, gems in the art of all time. To say anything of the master\r\nhimself is, thank Heaven, unnecessary. He has thus far escaped untouched\r\nfrom the constant revolution of values, the propelling force of which is\r\nusually unknown to its satellites. Of him alone can it be said, that\r\neven an approximate conception of the range of his mastery is\r\nimpossible without familiarity with his paintings in the Hermitage.\r\n\r\nRubens, too, is represented here in all his astonishing versatility. I\r\ndo not know what value is placed nowadays on this omniscience. Yet even\r\nthe termagant tongue of impotency must become dumb before this splendid\r\ncollection. Mythological and Biblical themes, portraits and landscapes,\r\nare almost throughout of equal perfection and beauty. His exuberant\r\nfancy is nowhere revealed to better advantage than in the fascinating\r\nsketches in which the Hermitage is so rich. They must be termed\r\nveritable orgies of the draughtsman and the colorist, and bear to a\r\ncertain extent the imprint of perennial genius and happy inspiration,\r\nwhich the painting, often completed by his pupils, cannot quite show.\r\nBut where the master's own hand has worked it has given life to the\r\nimperishable. If a prize were to be awarded to any one of the\r\nforty-seven masterpieces it would surely belong to the portrait of\r\nHelene Fourment, on which the artist worked with undivided love. The\r\nroguish beauty is painted life-size. She is standing in a\r\nflower-bedecked meadow, and in the background heavy clouds pass over the\r\nlandscape. But they serve only to bring out in greater relief the\r\ndelicate lace collar around the bare neck of the woman in a low-necked\r\ngown. She has on her blond, curly head a black, soft, Rembrandt hat,\r\nornamented with feathers, and adorned with a violet-blue ribbon. Her\r\nheavy, black satin dress with the airy white lace sleeves shows the\r\nstill youthful, slender figure in a swaying, graceful pose. The delicate\r\nhands are crossed over the waist. The right is holding, fanlike and with\r\nrefined ease, a long, white heron's feather. The dress and ornaments,\r\nthe ear-rings and the bejewelled brooch and chain, are treated with such\r\ncare as was seldom shown by the busy master. The main charm of the\r\npainting lies, however, in the roguish, spirited face with the large,\r\nclever eyes and the smiling little mouth. The neck and bosom show,\r\nhowever, that the name Helene is not inappropriate.\r\n\r\nOf the mythological pictures the \"Drunken Silence,\" variations on which\r\nin the Munich Pinakothek are well enough known to make a more detailed\r\ndescription superfluous, is to my taste the most wonderful. But the St.\r\nPetersburg original is, if possible, even richer in its coloring, and\r\nthe grotesque humor of the fine company is altogether irresistible. We\r\nalso find an excellent variation in \"The Pert Lover's Happy Moments,\"\r\nthe brown shepherd attacking a young woman with the features of Helene\r\nFourment. The liberation of Andromeda by the victorious Perseus is a\r\nwork with all conceivable merits. The dead monster that had guarded the\r\nbrilliantly beautiful maid lies outstretched with gaping jaws; the\r\nwhite-winged steed that had carried the victor is stamping the ground,\r\nbut easily held in check by a little cupid. The victor, still in his\r\nglittering armor, with the gorgon shield in his left hand approaches\r\nthe fair maid and softly touches her. Another little cupid has removed\r\nhis helmet so that the emerging Fame may place the wreath on his locks.\r\nBut the youth sees only the glorious beauty at whose draperies three or\r\nfour little rogues are busily tugging to pull away from the white body\r\neven the last vestige of covering. Of the splendid composition, \"Venus\r\nand Adonis,\" only the wonderful heads were drawn by the master; the rest\r\nwas done in his studio, but it is quite respectable.\r\n\r\nOf the religious works, the \"Descent from the Cross\" is akin to the\r\nfamous painting in the Dome of Antwerp. The large painting, \"Christ\r\nVisiting Simon the Pharisee,\" was completed with the aid of his pupils.\r\nThe figures of Christ and of Magdalene, who is drying the feet of the\r\nSaviour with her hair, were drawn by the master himself. The head of the\r\npenitent is particularly striking. It has something leonine in it, and\r\nthe fervor with which she seizes the foot and draws it to herself has\r\nalso something of the passion that may have led to her sin.\r\n\r\nOf Van Dyck, the cleverest and most prominent of Rubens's pupils, who\r\naspired to aristocratic refinement--perhaps only to free himself from\r\nthe overpowering influence of the robust genius of his teacher, perhaps\r\nalso because of his inherently more tenacious nature--the Hermitage\r\npossesses the largest and most valuable collection. The \"Holy Family\" is\r\nstill influenced by Rubens, although it is somewhat softer. It is a\r\ncharming composition, full of peace and cheerfulness. Mary is sitting\r\nunder a shady tree holding the Christ-Child, who is standing on her lap\r\nso that he may bend over to look at the dancing ring of little angels.\r\nSt. Joseph is comfortably seated in the background. The play of the\r\nangels is unmistakably conceived after Rubens's festoon, and yet\r\npossesses great beauty of its own. In its color effects the picture is\r\namong the best. The artist is seen in complete self-dependence in the\r\nnumerous portraits of his English period as well as in the cabinet piece\r\nof \"The Snyder Family.\" The English impress us especially by the\r\nexpression of self-conscious gentility, aristocratic exclusiveness,\r\npeculiar to themselves as well as to the master. We cannot escape the\r\ncharm of these somewhat decadent faces, just as we would enjoy equally a\r\nBeethoven sonata and a Chopin nocturne. Without the exuberant\r\nimagination and the universality of his teacher, Van Dyck possesses,\r\nnone the less, a personality of his own, shining with a light of its\r\nown; he is one of the psychologists among the painters.\r\n\r\nAnother psychologist, though not with delicate hands, but sturdy and\r\ncreative, with exuberant genius, is Franz Hals, who is represented here\r\nby four strikingly lifelike portraits. Of him, too, nothing more need be\r\nsaid, though one may add he is a splendid fellow.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch miniature painters have here some dainty pieces. Of Van der\r\nHelst's we see his renowned \"Introduction of the Bride,\" a scene from\r\nDutch patrician life, with somewhat strongly exaggerated respectability\r\nand affluence. The bridegroom's parents, themselves still young, are\r\nseated on a garden terrace clad in their holiday attire, and with gloves\r\nin their hands; the youngest son, stylishly dressed, with a parrot in\r\nhis hand, is looking with strained attention towards the bridal couple,\r\nwho are ceremoniously ascending the terrace; two greyhounds by the side\r\nof the parents, a lap-dog by the bride's side, take part in the\r\nperformance; and loudest of all is the parrot, whom the master is\r\nobliged to call to order by an indignant \"Keep still!\" Notwithstanding\r\nits size (it has a width of more than three metres), the picture is\r\npainted with a minuteness of detail, from the frills of the mother to\r\nthe rustling silk of the bride's dress and the thin foliage of the\r\npoplars in the background of the garden, that would do honor to any\r\nminiature painter. To be sure, our impressionist creed of the present\r\nday does not allow the recognition of such painstaking elegance and\r\nneatness in the execution of details. However, doctrines pass away, but,\r\nthank Heaven, the pictures remain.\r\n\r\nThe numerous domestic genre pictures, Terborch's famous \"Glass of\r\nLemonade,\" Jan Steen's \"Drunken Woman,\" held up to derision by her\r\nhusband, and the \"Visits of the Physician,\" who is feeling the pulse of\r\na young woman, evidently embarrassed, while the doctor, with a\r\nsignificant smile, is exchanging remarks with an old woman, by Metzu,\r\nas well as certain physicians' examinations, by Gerhard Dou, that cannot\r\nfurther be described, are all notable, not only for the execution of the\r\nvelvet and silk fabrics, of the glasses and the interiors, but even more\r\nfor the unfailing firmness of characterization in movement and\r\nphysiognomy. Certainly these are great painters, and their works are\r\ntrue cabinet-pieces. Composition must always swing between painstaking\r\naccuracy and bold impressionism. Yet nothing could be more foolish than\r\nthe contempt for miniaturists in a period of impressionism and the\r\ncontempt for impressionists in a period of painful detail. \"In my\r\nFather's house are many mansions.\"\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say of the works of Ostade, Teniers, Wouwerman, Pottes,\r\nand Ruysdael? The Hermitage not only contains an inexhaustible abundance\r\nof their productions, but includes their very best works. Potter has a\r\nwolf-hound and dairy farm, an animal group of the highest plasticity,\r\nand a quite modern transparency of atmosphere. Tenier has pieces that\r\nshow him to have been not only a grotesque humorist but also a great\r\nlandscape-painter; and of Ruysdael there are true pearls like the \"Sand\r\nRoad\" and the \"Bay Lake.\"\r\n\r\nRarities, valuable as such not alone to the art-lover, are the \"Healing\r\nof the Blind,\" by Lucas van Leyden, the \"Maid under the Apple-Tree,\" by\r\nLucas Cranach, a triumphant Madonna, by Quentin Massys--faithful,\r\nhonest works which the pious masters laid with devotion on the golden\r\nground. No sensible person will deride them, for they are still governed\r\nin their conceptions by the carefully obeyed rules of symmetry. In the\r\n_attachement_ there is such depth of characterization, such affection\r\nand warmth, that many a masterpiece must be placed much below them. For\r\nenthusiasm of conception and conscientious execution are, after all, of\r\ndeciding moment in every unbiased judgment. But the technique belongs to\r\nthe time and not to the individual.\r\n\r\nThe French of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries conclude the\r\ngroup. The Germans have never succeeded in placing themselves in a true\r\nrelation to this art that is rhetorical and theatrical rather than\r\nreally poetical. Yet we shall never be wanting in respect to others,\r\nespecially to the masters Poussin and Claude Lorrain. The landscapes of\r\na heroic-mythological character that represent them in the Hermitage are\r\nmonuments of respectable ability.\r\n\r\nOf real charm, however, are the piquant genre masters Fragonard and\r\nWatteau, who were held in such deep contempt in the virtuous years of\r\nthe Revolution, that no one dared to pay even fifty francs for their\r\nfrivolous paintings. They are represented by excellent pieces, as well\r\nas the more serious master Greuze, whose \"Death of an Old Man\" would do\r\nhonor even to our good Knaus. Boucher and Lancret justly deserve our\r\nattention. But Marguerite Gerard, the sister-in law of Fragonard, and\r\nJean B. Chardin, have quite inconspicuously realized a goodly portion of\r\nthe impressionist programme without devoting themselves merely to\r\nproblems of light and shade. The \"Mother's Happiness\" of the former does\r\nfull justice to the charming scene and easily solves a problem in\r\ninteriors. The same is true of Chardin's \"Washerwomen.\" There is\r\npositively nothing new under the sun. It is only the one or the other\r\nside of the universal knowledge of the great masters acclaimed as an\r\nentirely new discovery. Then follow actions and reactions, and thus the\r\nso-called art history is formed, the rise and fall among a few high\r\npeaks and nothing more.\r\n\r\nOne day we found a whole row of rooms closed, just those that contained\r\nour favorites of the Rembrandt gallery. What was the cause of it?\r\nPreparations were being made for the Czar's dinner. A great court dinner\r\nis given every Friday in the splendid halls of the Hermitage, and\r\nsuitable preparations are made on the previous day. Flowers are placed\r\neverywhere, dishes and silver are brought and kept under special watch.\r\nThe Czar's table is placed in the large Italian hall; the courtier's\r\ntables in the adjoining halls. The conservatories and prominent artists\r\nhave already petitioned for the abolition of this barbaric custom, for\r\nthe vapors from the viands do not in any wise contribute to the\r\npreservation of the costly paintings. But how are exhortations of\r\nwarning to reach the Czar's ear? They are derided by the servile\r\ncourtiers, and held up to scorn as professional fancies of but little\r\nsignificance when compared with the wish of princes to dine among the\r\nfinest works of art in the world. The consciousness that great works of\r\nart are merely kept in trust by their passing owners, kept for their\r\ntrue owner, progress-making humanity, has perhaps reached the better\r\nclass, but has not been awakened in the autocracy, where even the\r\nconception of humanity has not yet been attained. They own pictures as\r\nthey own crown jewels, and consider themselves at liberty to treat them\r\nas they please. But on such a matter the subject must remain silent; and\r\nhe does. It is the environment that influences princes, whether for good\r\nor for evil. But the injury to a few paintings, however expensive, is\r\nnot the worst that rests on the conscience of the ring in the Czar's\r\ncourt, just as the Hermitage is not the most objectionable feature of\r\nSt. Petersburg. When the Russian empire shall have overcome the phase of\r\nbarbarian mistrust for strangers and of oppressive police management,\r\nwhen it shall have really opened its gates, the Hermitage will become a\r\ntrue centre of attraction with few equals in the universe. Then will\r\nbecome common property those wonder works that to-day are still beyond\r\nthe reach of common knowledge. In the Russia of to-day a treasury of\r\nculture like the Hermitage is almost an anachronism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE CAMORRA--A TALK WITH A RUSSIAN PRINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I report here a significant conversation I had with a prince, the\r\nfriend and former confidant of the Czar, I would make an earnest appeal\r\nto the public opinion of Europe, for which these lines are intended. I\r\nhave conversed with many men of the highest rank in Russia; I am\r\nindebted to them for most valuable information about the land of\r\nriddles, yet not a single interview was concluded without my informant\r\nasking me to withhold his name. Only the prince whose views I report\r\nhere said to me, \"If you need my name to prove the credibility of the\r\nmost incredible things I had to tell you, you may use it without\r\ncompunction. Possible suffering that may befall me because of this use\r\nof my name is of no consideration where the enlightenment of Europe is\r\nconcerned.\" On mature deliberation I have preferred, however, not to\r\nmention his name here. I thus renounce the weight of a name of European\r\nrepute and of unparalleled authority. Notwithstanding this, I still\r\nconsider it necessary to ask public opinion of Europe to watch with\r\nredoubled care the fate of the few persons who have been my informants.\r\nIt would not be right for me to suppress this report, for I should thus\r\nact in direct opposition to the wishes of the noble-minded prince.\r\nNeither could I disguise him entirely, since there are, after all, but\r\nfew persons that could have made to me these disclosures on the\r\nhelplessness of even the eminent patriots. And so I must resort to an\r\nappeal to the public opinion of Europe with proper caution. It can\r\nprotect the prince. For with all their wickedness the Russian rulers\r\nstill fear foreign public opinion. This and this alone has a certain\r\ninfluence on the Czar. Let it be exerted in behalf of a man of the\r\ngreatest heroism, who makes appeal to it out of pure patriotism.\r\n\r\n\"Does your highness think,\" I asked, in the interview I am about to\r\nreport here, \"that the discontent everywhere noticeable in all classes\r\nof society is real and of political significance?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must make distinctions,\" answered the prince; \"of its reality there\r\nis no doubt. But if you ask whether I consider it politically fruitful,\r\nin the same sense that we may gain through this discontent some\r\nnecessary change in the present régime, I must answer, unfortunately,\r\nno.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this, then, only the chronic discontent present in western Europe as\r\nwell as in Russia, or is it now acute?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is acute. As you have justly observed, the West has its discontented\r\nelement also; yet your Western discontent with all work of man may best\r\nbe compared with that frame of mind prevalent in our country, even under\r\na régime that is normal and well-intentioned, lacking only efficiency.\r\nThe restlessness that you, as a stranger, have noted here is quite\r\nabnormal, and is due to the decided wickedness, not to say infamy, of\r\nthe existing system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is stronger than usual?\"\r\n\r\n\"Incomparably stronger. No entertainment however harmless, no scientific\r\ncongress, no meeting of any corporation can take place that will not end\r\nin a political demonstration. All the prisons are filled with most\r\nworthy people, deportations and banishments increase, yet other men and\r\nwomen press onward to martyrdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I admire this spirit of sacrifice in your intelligent classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the difference between to-day and a few years ago. Ten years\r\nago our public opinion was weakened, resigned, crushed by the heavy hand\r\nof Alexander III. and the serpent wiles of Pobydonostzev. With the\r\naccession to the throne of the present Czar new hopes were awakened; but\r\nnow, thanks to the executioners Sipyagin and Plehve, disappointment and\r\nexasperation have grown to such a vast extent that expression of them\r\ncan no longer be repressed, and thousands risk life and liberty unable\r\nlonger to bear this condition of grinding inward revolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I witnessed the funeral of Mikhailovski. I must say that my ear\r\ndetected revolutionary tones, and such a procession of five or six\r\nthousand men and women from among the highest classes, surrounded by\r\nCossacks, among a listening police, singing songs, making fiery,\r\nfreedom-breathing speeches, impressed me of all things as a foreboding\r\nof revolution.\r\n\r\n\"Arrests in plenty were made among the participants in the funeral\r\ncelebration. But do not deceive yourself. There is no revolution with\r\nus. Our country is too thinly populated. Let us say that ten, fifty, or\r\none hundred thousand inspired intellectuals would willingly sacrifice\r\nthemselves if they could help us thereby; how many Cossacks and\r\ngendarmes would there be for each revolutionist, when we are spending\r\nmillions to maintain an army against the nation? There is only one\r\nrevolution that can be really dangerous, and I will not assert that such\r\na revolution could not break out if the present war should end\r\ndisastrously. That would be a peasant revolution, directed, not against\r\nthe régime itself, but against all property-owning and educated persons;\r\nit would begin by all of us being killed and thrown into the river. And\r\nthe odds would be a hundred to one then that the police would not be\r\nactively against this revolution, but secretly would be for it, in order\r\nto rid themselves quickly and surely of their real antagonist, the\r\neducated classes. A Kishinef may be arranged here at any day, not only\r\nagainst the Jews, but against every one with whom the police wish to get\r\neven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your highness believes that the Kishinef massacres were arranged\r\nby the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not a mere belief; it is a proved fact. Their real authors,\r\nKrushevan and Pronin, are the special protégés of Plehve; and Baron\r\nLevendahl received a direct order from the higher authorities to refrain\r\nfrom any intervention.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the purpose of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"To intimidate the Jews, who, by their temperament, bring a little more\r\nlife to the radical parties, and to create the impression in the higher\r\ncircles that there is discontent in the country, not against the\r\ngovernment, but against the usurious Jews.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is not that true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Usury with us is carried on by good, orthodox Christians much more\r\nsuccessfully than by the Jews, who are comparatively few in number, and,\r\nbesides, do not enjoy the protection of the authorities. No; the mob\r\nmassacres the Jews because in the name of the Czar they are proclaimed\r\noutlaws. It is a kind of annual picnic. The Kishinef massacres are\r\ncondemned by the whole country, not only by the philo-Semites--to whom,\r\nby-the-way, I do not belong. It has showed to all of us what may be done\r\nin our land when an assumed purpose requires it. And for this reason the\r\nentire public opinion takes sides with the Jews, who were merely\r\nintended to serve as scapegoats for the educated and the discontented.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in what respect is the present régime so essentially different from\r\nthe preceding ones that such a fermentation could arise? Surely the\r\npeople have not been spoiled by anything better?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now it is worse than ever before. There is perhaps an explanation for\r\nthis. Czar Nicholas is inspired by the best of motives. He is the first\r\nof the malcontents. He would give his heart's blood to help his people.\r\nThe clique knows that, and is, therefore, risking everything on one\r\ncard, to prevent the Czar from drawing nearer to the people or creating\r\ninstitutions that would put an end to bureaucratic omnipotence. The\r\nterrors of revolution are painted on the wall, and the daily arrests are\r\nintended to prove that it is only the mailed fist of the present\r\ngovernment that can curb a popular uprising.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know from sources near the Czar's family that the Czar is again\r\nfinding threatening letters in his coat-pockets, under his pillow, and\r\nelsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is an old police trick. It was used to frighten Alexander III.,\r\nand it almost drove him insane. Naturally, it is only the police that\r\ncan carry out such devices, for others could not reach the Czar's room.\r\nBut Plehve retains his ascendency through the illusion that his\r\ndismissal would mean the way to the scaffold for the Czar's family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the Czar really anything to fear should the police relax its\r\nvigilance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid! The Czar is a sort of deity to the people, and the\r\neducated classes know only too well that no man is less responsible for\r\nexisting conditions than he, in whose name these conditions are\r\ninflicted upon us. But the Czar is made to believe that every attempt to\r\nfree public opinion from its fetters would lead to popular\r\nrepresentation, to a constitution, and finally to the scaffold.\"\r\n\r\n\"And all that is done by Plehve?\"\r\n\r\n\"By him alone. His predecessor, Sipyagin, was an honest, narrow\r\nreactionary, who regarded the state as the private property of the\r\ndynasty, something like a great estate with property in souls as well as\r\nin inanimate things. The nation has no more right to complain against\r\nthe impositions of the master than the cattle on the estate to complain\r\nabout the methods of feeding. Plehve is of an entirely different\r\ncaliber. A political cheat, an intriguer, an unscrupulous cynic, the\r\nplaying on the key-board of power tickles his blunted nerves. He has as\r\nmuch conscience, sympathy, and humanity as my tiger here. His talent\r\nconsists of cunning and the art of dealing with men. There is no one\r\nwith whom he has exchanged three words that he has not lied to. His\r\npatriotic overzeal, however, as a non-Russian--he naturally overdoes his\r\npatriotism--commends him to the 'camarilla,' and so he becomes\r\nomnipotent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that Plehve is not Russian?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is partly Lettish, partly Polish, partly Jewish. Men like this are\r\nalways the worst here; they must see that their non-Russian names are\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you mean by 'camarilla'?\"\r\n\r\n\"The servile courtiers, the high officials, but above all, the entire\r\nsystem. Do not forget that we are being ruled by a Camorra of\r\nbureaucrats, that have no interest at all in the real welfare of the\r\ncountry, but have their primary interest in the uncurtailed maintenance\r\nof their power. If the Czar wished to hear, to-day, the truth about the\r\ncondition and sentiments of the country, he would never succeed, because\r\nthey do not expose one another in the Camorra; for there is only one\r\ngod--the career with all its chances of legitimate and illegitimate\r\ngain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness, I must allow myself an indiscreet question. It is said\r\nthat you are a friend of the Czar. You are surely not the only one. You\r\nmust have colleagues among the nobility, statesmen, and patriots who\r\ncannot be prevented from being heard by the Emperor. Are you not in a\r\nposition to break through the iron ring of the bureaucrats, and to tell\r\nthe Czar the truth about the men who possess his confidence?\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your question. But what could single individuals do\r\nagainst the abuses of centuries? Something is being done in the\r\ndirection indicated by you. The Czar receives, often enough, honest and\r\nunreserved statements. But a lasting effect from such occasional\r\nimpulses is out of the question. Moreover, one must know the spirit of\r\nthe antechamber, the slanders and suspicions, the burden of routine. It\r\nwould require the power of a Hercules to escape from the net of these\r\nforces, and the Czar is of a timid, modest, kindly nature. And how\r\nquickly is every suggestion or initiative paralyzed! And what influences\r\ncross one another at such a court! Who is strong enough to oppose a\r\ngrand vizier who works with unscrupulous falsification, and weaves about\r\nthe sovereign an impenetrable fabric of false dangers by means of\r\ndocumentary calumnies and misstatements?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so your highness can see no deliverance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only when God in heaven shall decree it, not otherwise. We live between\r\nthe anarchists in office and the anarchists with dagger and revolver.\r\nThese are only active forces, the latter as the logical sequence of the\r\nformer, and more than once their tools as well. All else is inactive,\r\nlimited to dissipating demonstration. The fountain of public opinion is\r\nnot tolerated; the organization of a progressive party is prevented; the\r\nsystem anxiously guards the people from any contact with the educated\r\nclasses. There is no room for sentimentality in repelling every attempt\r\nto render the Camorra harmless. An unguarded word, a simple\r\ndenunciation, are sufficient to send honorable and respected men where\r\nthey lose all desire for criticism. Whence, then, can help come? And we\r\nneed it, for the war places before us entirely new problems, that may be\r\nsolved only by unshackling intelligence. But now our bankruptcy will\r\nbecome evident to all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Witte! Has he no longer any influence?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever. He is not a convenient and acceptable minister, for he\r\nhas a statesman's ambition and political ideas. He could, perhaps,\r\ninaugurate a new system, but this is not allowed. In this country there\r\nrules only the ministry of the interior--that is, the secret police; the\r\nother departments are merely figure-heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a constitution would change nothing of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Liberals and Radicals believe so, but I do not. I am of a different\r\nopinion. 'Men and not measures,' is my motto, especially in an\r\nautocracy. You know my views on the war. I am convinced that our brave\r\narmy will win. That will only mean a greater strengthening of the\r\nsystem, till the complete financial and economic, social and moral\r\ncollapse, or till the first collision with a real power like the United\r\nStates of America. I see no relief and no salvation, especially since\r\nforeign public opinion also forsakes us. We are fawned upon for\r\npolitical or commercial reasons. Tell them abroad that we deserve\r\nsomething better than this contemptible, statesman-like reserve and\r\nthese affected expressions of respect before a régime that we ourselves\r\ndenounce without exception. We deserve honest sympathy, for no other\r\nnation has yet been made to struggle for its civilization against so\r\npitiless an adversary. Europe must further distinguish between the\r\nRussian nation and this adversary. Russian society is full of noble\r\nimpulses; it is generous, warm-hearted, capable of inspiration, and free\r\nfrom odious prejudices. Our common oppressor, the danger to the world's\r\npeace as well as the author of this unhappy war, I repeat it again, is\r\nthe Camorra of the officials, a thoroughly anarchistic class. I do not\r\nknow, I must admit, when and how our release will come. I fear that we\r\nshall, ere that, pass through sad trials, and even more terrible misery\r\nof our flayed and hunger-enfeebled people, before Heaven shall take pity\r\non us.\"\r\n\r\nI left the noble-minded prince with feelings that are usually awakened\r\nin us only by tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nSÄNGER'S FALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sudden dismissal of the minister of public instruction, the former\r\nuniversity professor Sänger, led me to discuss it more exhaustively with\r\nseveral high dignitaries who willingly gave me information during my\r\nsojourn in St. Petersburg. I had the opportunity of conversing with\r\npersons exceptionally well-informed, but, for reasons easily\r\nconceivable, I am not permitted to mention their names. I report here,\r\nfrom my notes, an interview with a person standing near to the retired\r\nminister, and still in active government service, because it seems\r\ninteresting to me even now.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place,\" said my informant, \"you must not believe that\r\nSänger was dismissed. He himself insisted that his resignation,\r\nrepeatedly offered, be finally accepted. Scarcely two days ago the Czar\r\nasked a general, highly esteemed by him, who came here from Warsaw,\r\nwhere Sänger had formerly acted as curator of the university, as to his\r\nopinion of Sänger, and the general answered that he considered Sänger a\r\nvery honest and learned man. 'I have just that opinion of him myself,'\r\nsaid the Czar, complainingly, 'but he positively would not remain.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does your excellency believe that Sänger had become so tired of his\r\nposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are permanent and special reasons. The permanent ones are harder\r\nto explain than the special ones. I therefore begin with the more\r\ndifficult. A minister of public instruction--'lucus a non lucendo'--has\r\nhere a very difficult post when he is an honest man and really desires\r\nto live up to his duties. For what he is really asked to do is, that he\r\ndo _not_ enlighten the people, that he do _nothing_ for education, that\r\nhe merely pretend activity. We need no education; we need obedience.\r\nThat, of course, is not said to the Czar, who really believes that he is\r\nbeing served honestly. But in the end it amounts to this, that only one\r\nman rules here, the minister of the interior and chief of the secret\r\npolice, and that all the other ministers must dance to his music. I make\r\nexception here, to a certain extent, of the ministers of war and of\r\nfinance. But if in any case there be a possibility of conflict between\r\nany other department and the omnipotent police ministry, that other\r\ndepartment must subordinate itself to the rule of the latter. For von\r\nPlehve stands guard over the security of the empire. You understand that\r\nall other considerations are silenced here. The third division (the\r\nsecret police) and the Holy Synod are the pillars of our empire. Of what\r\nimportance is here an inoffensive minister of instruction, or culture,\r\nas he is called in your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be obliged to your excellency for concrete examples.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they are. There was, for instance, General Wannowski, a really\r\ncompetent and influential man. While he was at the head of the\r\ndepartment of instruction he could not be so easily turned down at the\r\ncourt as our ordinary university professor. Wannowski even effected some\r\nreforms in our universities, but finally he, too, found it desirable to\r\nretire from the field. Do you think it possible for a minister to remain\r\nin office when a regulation prepared by him, approved by the Czar, and\r\nmade public, must next day be withdrawn because the minister of the\r\ninterior states in a special report that this regulation is in\r\nopposition to the general government policy and is a danger to the\r\nsecurity of the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"And has that occurred?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something of that kind was a secondary cause also of Sänger's\r\nresignation. As former curator of the University of Warsaw, he knew\r\nPoland well. With the Czar's approval, he framed a regulation for\r\ninstruction in Poland that was pedagogically wise and politically\r\nconciliating. Instantly Plehve made objection--for a relief of the\r\ntension everywhere prevailing does not suit his system--and secured the\r\nwithdrawal of the regulation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But could not Sänger defend his measures?\"\r\n\r\n\"His position was already weakened. Above all, his enemies succeeded in\r\nplacing him under suspicion as guilty of philo-Semitism. You know, or\r\nperhaps do not know, that it is also a part of the system here to keep\r\nthe Jews--particularly the Jews--from higher education; and this higher\r\neducation in itself runs contrary to the desire of the dictator-general\r\nof the Holy Synod and to that of the police. A minister of public\r\ninstruction, particularly when he hails from the learned professions,\r\nmay easily commit the error of making science readily accessible to all\r\nproperly qualified. Sänger granted some alleviation to the Jews, so that\r\nthe most gifted among them, especially when their academy professor had\r\nalready taken a warm interest in them, could enter the university\r\nwithout great difficulty. He was reproached with that, and that would\r\nhave been sufficient to weaken the position of a stronger man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not familiar with the disabilities of Jewish students.\"\r\n\r\n\"A detailed description of these disabilities would carry you too far\r\nafield. Suffice it to state that we possess a very complicated system,\r\nparticularly developed in Moscow, for the exclusion of Jewish children\r\nfrom the schools. The ratio of three to one hundred must, however, be\r\nconveniently tolerated. Now it happens quite frequently that, no matter\r\nhow strict the director at admission, on promotion from the lower to the\r\nhigher class this relation is shifted in favor of the Jews, because of\r\ntheir diligence and sobriety in contrast to the characteristics of the\r\nsons of the Russian officials. Then the trouble begins anew. Splendidly\r\nqualified candidates cannot enter the university, since the prescribed\r\npercentage has already been reached. The professors, however, who are\r\nnot pronounced anti-Semites really like these Jewish students who have\r\nsurvived this process of selection, for they are really studious. But\r\nthat again is opposed to the principles of the accepted policy. And\r\nwhoever is inclined to take sides with the professors rather than with\r\nthe bulwarks of this general policy may easily find himself in the\r\ntoils, as it happened, for instance, in Sänger's case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are these bulwarks of this general policy?\" An involuntary glance\r\ntowards the door, as if to see whether some uninvited listener was not\r\naccidentally near--a glance I have frequently seen only in Russia--was\r\nthe first answer. Then, even in lower tones than before, he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"That is still a portion of the legacy of Alexander III., rigidly\r\nguarded by the dowager-empress, and particularly by the Grand-Duke\r\nSergius in Moscow. When in the Russo-Turkish war enormous peculations of\r\nthe military stores were discovered, the heir to the throne, then\r\ncommander of a corps in the reserve, was persuaded that the Jewish\r\ncontractors had defrauded the army, and the officer of the secret\r\npolice, Zhikharev, exerted himself to prove that two-thirds of all the\r\nrevolutionaries were Jews. That belief remained, just as a great portion\r\nof the French still cling to the belief that Dreyfus is a traitor\r\nbecause he is used as a scapegoat for the information-mongers of high\r\nrank on the general staff. Something similar happened here. I really\r\nhave no desire to defend any Jewish contractor; but when there was in\r\nour stores lime-dust instead of flour in the sacks, quite other people\r\nthan the Jews pocketed the difference. However, that is another story.\r\nGrand-Duke Sergius, of Moscow, has among his other passions bigotry and\r\na fanatical hatred of Jews. And he is the uncle and brother-in-law of\r\nthe Czar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Sänger found himself in a rather dubious position mainly as a\r\nphilo-Semite?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least as a man of not sufficiently pronounced anti-Semitism. But\r\nalso because he was not really the man to hold his own with the generals\r\nand talents of the career-maker von Plehve. Finally, he was blamed for\r\nadverse criticism of the general principles of the government expressed\r\nat various conventions.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what conventions?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was lately a convention of public-school teachers that presumed\r\nto criticise by speaking the truth about an intimate of Plehve's,\r\nPronin, of Kishinef. I must emphasize here, by-the-way, that there was\r\nonly an insignificant minority of Jews at that convention. Then there\r\nwas a medical congress whose hygienic resolutions hid under a very thin\r\nhygienic disguise an arraignment of the system of stupefying the\r\npopulace. The Lord knows Sänger had surely no premonition of these\r\noccurrences. But they concerned his department; the spirit of his staff\r\nwas not right, and he alone was to blame for it, especially since von\r\nPlehve knew very well what Sänger thought of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always Plehve, and only Plehve!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is our little Metternich. A representative man, to quote Emerson.\r\nThe régime cannot be discussed without the mention of his name. Here is\r\nanother little sample of Plehve. There is a Professor Kuzmin-Karavayev\r\nat the academy of military and international law. He was elected member\r\nof the St. Petersburg city council, and is a member of the zemstvo of\r\nTver, a highly respected, upright man, interested in popular education.\r\nBut now he has been forbidden any public activity by the following\r\nletter of von Plehve. Plehve wrote to Kuropatkin, the minister of war:\r\n'By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Emperor on January 8,\r\n1904, I would simply dismiss Professor Kuzmin-Karavayev as politically\r\ninconvenient. But since he is in the government service I ask you to\r\ninsist that the aforesaid professor renounce all public activity.' This\r\nis literally true. You see how the omnipotent Plehve treats even a\r\nfavorite like Kuropatkin, to say nothing of a timid, good professor like\r\nour Sänger! You may rest assured that, with all his upright views, we\r\nlost little in his resignation; he was without influence and too weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who will succeed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite immaterial. Major-General Shilder, superintendent of the\r\ncadet corps, has already been offered the position, but he declined it.\r\nAs long as Plehve's spirit and that of his minions is sweeping over the\r\nwaters nothing will happen save what favors the suppression of public\r\nenlightenment and the prevention of revolution. The name is but an empty\r\nsound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency, should I commit an indiscretion by publishing our\r\nconversation just as it took place?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the necessary precaution of leaving out my name, for I naturally\r\nhave no inclination to attract the especial anger of our\r\ndictator-general. For the rest, I do not believe I have told you\r\nanything that could not be said in almost the same words by any one at\r\nall familiar with conditions as they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, your excellency, I must confirm. One of the greatest riddles for\r\nme is the formation of a public opinion in St. Petersburg, where the\r\npapers dare not even hint of what is spoken in the circles of the\r\nintelligent classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Russia also has its constitution,\" said he, rising, and smiling\r\nsignificantly. \"That constitution consists of the dissensions among the\r\nministers. And when among ourselves, a certain discretion assumed, we\r\ndo not stand on ceremony. Here you have the sources of public\r\nopinion\"--again the significant smile--\"you will perhaps understand why\r\nno minister fares well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hence also Plehve?\"\r\n\r\n(A motion of despairing defence.) \"He? No! speaking seriously. It is the\r\ncurse of our country. May the Lord save us!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE'S PALACE OF ST. PETERSBURG (NARODNI DOM)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Potemkin's fatherland the art of government consists principally in\r\nhiding the truth not only from the people, but also from the Czar, who\r\nmust be made to believe that he really strives for the welfare of the\r\npeople, and not only for that of the all-powerful bureaucracy.\r\nPotemkin's art, as is well known, consisted in deceitfully showing to\r\nhis beloved Empress, in a long journey, prosperous peasant farms, where\r\nin reality wretchedness and misery had established their permanent home.\r\nWhat the all-powerful favorite had accomplished by means of pasteboard\r\nand bushes, costs the modern Potemkins somewhat more comfort; but like\r\ntheir predecessor, they are in a position to supply it from the richly\r\nfilled imperial treasury. The \"Narodni Dom,\" the people's institute on\r\nthe St. Petersburg fortress, is utilized to persuade the philanthropic\r\nNicholas that in his paternally governed empire more ample provision is\r\nmade for the common people and their welfare than in the heartless,\r\ncivilized Western countries.\r\n\r\nTo the eye of a well-meaning ruler or of a well-disposed globe-trotter\r\nthis is really a pleasant sight. Framed in alleys of tall trees, there\r\nrises in the park a far-stretching stone structure, of St. Petersburg\r\ndimensions, surmounted by a great cupola. On the payment of ten kopeks\r\nat the entrance we walk into the well-heated central portion under the\r\ndome, brightly illuminated by arc-lamps. Furs and overshoes are removed.\r\nAnd now an exclamation of admiration escapes our lips. A well-dressed\r\ncrowd strolls naturally, without crowding and elbowing, towards a\r\nplatform rising at the farther end, on which, to judge at a distance,\r\nNeapolitan folk-singers are performing. We join the procession, and when\r\nscarcely in the middle of the immense hall supported by iron girders,\r\nthere resound behind us thundering notes that cause us to look upward.\r\nAn orchestra stationed on a one-story-high cross-gallery has begun a\r\nRussian popular song. The singers before us stop for a while. The crowd\r\nmoves forward. A negro dandy with high, white standing collar and\r\npatent-leather boots, proudly leads by the arm a voluptuous blonde of\r\nthe Orpheum type. He grimly shows his teeth and fists to the scoffers\r\nwho make fun of the unequal pair; but this does not end in a race\r\nconflict, for it is not yet certain whether a negro boy is more in\r\nsympathy with the Japanese or the Russians. We finally reach the\r\ninteresting side of the hall, and there opens before us a still more\r\nenchanting picture. Behind long buffet-tables, kept scrupulously clean,\r\nand laden with all the delicacies of Russian cookery, from caviar\r\nsandwiches to the splendid mayonnaise of salmon, there bustle neat\r\nwaitresses in white caps and broad, white aprons. The prices are\r\nmaintained low throughout. The same is true of the warm dishes, the\r\npreparation of which we could watch in the large, open kitchen.\r\nSpirituous liquors are not sold, but in their place kvass, and tea from\r\nthe immense copper samovar blinking in the kitchen. The glasses are\r\ncontinually washed by sparkling water on an automatically turning high\r\nstand. The bright nickel, the reddish shimmer of the copper, the bluish\r\nwhite tiles of the floor and walls, the snow-white garments of the\r\ncooks, the white light of the arc-lamps could induce a Dutchman to\r\nproduce a very effective painting of neatness. We allow ourselves to be\r\ncrowded forward, and after a fruitful pilgrimage, pass the folk-singers,\r\nwhere a part of the crowd is gathered, back towards the central hall,\r\nwhich we now observe at our leisure. We are struck here, in the first\r\nplace, by the colossal portraits of the Emperor and Empress. They are\r\nthe hosts here; for the millions for the imposing structure came from\r\nthe Emperor's private purse. Then there is an immense map of the Russian\r\nempire for stimulating patriotic sentiments. But there await us still\r\nother pleasures. The entire left wing of the building is occupied by an\r\nenormous popular theatre. To-night Tschaikowski's \"Maid of Orleans\" is\r\nbeing played. We purchase tickets at the popular price of one ruble per\r\nseat, whereby we secure a place at about the middle of the extensive\r\nparterre, and are enabled to look over the public in front and at back\r\nof us; and this is not less interesting than the play on the stage. The\r\nseats in the rows ahead of us cost up to two rubles; in the rows at the\r\nback of us up to sixty kopeks. On either side are galleries and standing\r\nroom that cost \"only\" from thirty to seventy kopeks. In comparison with\r\nthe prices in the other St. Petersburg theatres those of the \"Narodni\r\nDom\" must be considered decidedly popular, even though it is a peculiar\r\nclass of people that can spare thirty kopeks to two rubles for an\r\nevening at the theatre, quite aside from the incidental expenses of an\r\nevening drive, of admission, and of wardrobe. But of that later.\r\n\r\nWe follow the play. The performance is decidedly respectable, from the\r\nleader to the chorus. The setting is quite brilliant, and true to style,\r\nthe orchestra well trained, with some very excellent performers among\r\nthe soloists. We forget, for the time being, that we are in Russia,\r\nnotwithstanding the Russian language and the Russian music. It is\r\nSchiller's heroic composition which has inspired the composer. Dunoi's\r\nLahire, Lionel, Raymond, Bertram, Agnes Sorel, Charles, the cardinal\r\nappear before us in familiar scenes, and we experience at times quite\r\npeculiar sensations when we again come across this northern night, the\r\nimages, the glowing rhetoric of which in the dear tongue of our own poet\r\nhad given us the first intoxication of patriotic enthusiasm. The\r\npassionately warm music of Tschaikowski, and the swing of his choruses\r\nintensify the effect of those reminiscences.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to Russian reality. A thin, black-bearded young man\r\npaces busily through the rows during one of the entr'actes. He exchanges\r\nremarks here and there with the officers and officials, whom he leaves\r\nwith a smile. And in the second entr'acte it becomes evident what\r\npreparations had been made here. War had just been declared; the\r\npassword had just been given out to arouse patriotic enthusiasm, or, at\r\nleast, to make the attempt. Already in one or another of the theatres\r\nthe public had thunderingly called for the national hymn. What is proper\r\nin the Imperial Theatre must be acceptable in the popular theatre. The\r\ncurtain had fallen after the second act, when suddenly, from one of the\r\nboxlike recesses on the left gallery was heard the call \"Hymn! Hymn!\"\r\nEverybody looked curiously up. There were there a few uniformed young\r\nmen, as we found later, student-members of that patriotic secret\r\nassociation organized under the patronage of the reactionaries--a stroke\r\nof Suvorin--to watch the progressive students. The orchestra replied to\r\nthe call with remarkable alacrity, and the public rose dutifully smiling\r\nand stood to the beautiful hymn. But new shouts were heard. The choir\r\nmust join in. The curtain rose obediently, and the entire cast of \"The\r\nMaid of Orleans,\" Charles, Agnes, Jean d'Arc, and Lionel, Burgundy and\r\nEngland; the people and knights were already properly grouped and joined\r\nin the hymn with the orchestra accompaniment. The public again arose\r\npolitely and listened standing. The demonstration was not yet at an end.\r\nIt was reported that the hymn was sung three times in the other\r\ntheatres, hence that should occur also here. And the public patiently\r\nrises for the third time, and lets the song float over it. The thin,\r\nblack-bearded young man, however, rubs his hands with which he joined in\r\nthe applause but shortly before, throws a significant glance to his\r\nneighbors, and hastens out. I do not know to this day whether he was an\r\nentrepreneur of the public resort, or a penny-a-liner who had arranged\r\nan interesting piece of local news.\r\n\r\nThus I came to see the birth of one of those patriotic demonstrations of\r\nwhich the papers were full in the following days. The impression was\r\nanything but striking. The fine hand of the police could be detected in\r\nthe arrangement as well as in the audience. It was a forced\r\ndemonstration that no one could avoid. I remember from my boyhood the\r\nexplosive enthusiasm after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war, and\r\nthe evening after the battle of Sedan. In man's estate I was a\r\nnon-participating observer of patriotic demonstrations in Hungary; my\r\nheart beat fast at home as well as in Hungary under the stress of\r\nsympathy. That was a real storm of feeling. Here--wet straw that would\r\nnot burn. Worse. An obedient participation--woe to him who did not\r\nparticipate! and then a sarcastic wink felt as a compensation for the\r\ncoercion just experienced.\r\n\r\nThe difference was never clearer to me between free citizens and Russian\r\nsubjects, between national sentiment and obedience, as at these\r\npatriotic demonstrations under police supervision and inspiration.\r\n\r\nAnd now I looked at the public more carefully. Where was the \"people\"\r\namong the thousands sitting in the theatre, or eddying up and down the\r\ncolossal halls? not one hundred, not fifty men or women in the dress of\r\nthe common people. All of it what is known in St. Petersburg as the\r\n\"gray public,\" officials, business-men, the class with an income of two\r\nor three thousand rubles. I saw high-school instructors, students with\r\ntheir girls, modistes, the good, small bourgeois, that often stand\r\nmorally and mentally high above the fashionable world; but the people,\r\nin our sense of the term, the workingman, the peasant, for whom the\r\npopular house was really built, in whose name the Czar was made to\r\ncontribute, and to whom the building is dedicated, these were absent,\r\nand had to be absent, because they do not possess the schooling that\r\nwould enable them at all to enjoy the offerings of the \"Narodni Dom.\"\r\nThe court may be persuaded that with such an institution they are\r\nmarching in the vanguard of civilization, and that something of the\r\nfuture state has been realized with an institution that even the\r\nrepublics of the West do not possess; but the Russian patriots who are\r\nindeed living for their nation, and who would free it from the fetters\r\nof ignorance and superstition, only shake their heads sadly at this\r\nPotemkinism. Sand for the eyes of the philanthropic Czar, another winter\r\nresort for the St. Petersburg middle class; for the people neither\r\n\"panem\" nor \"circenses,\" but for the paid eulogists a theme at which\r\nenthusiasm may be kindled--that is the \"Narodni Dom,\" the pride of St.\r\nPetersburg. In Zurich, in Frankfort, in any place with real popular\r\neducation, this \"Narodni Dom\" would be an ideal people's house, adapted\r\nto inspire sentiment of citizenship and patriotism, and to elevate the\r\ngeneral culture level. In St. Petersburg it only shows the good\r\nintentions of the Czar and his consort, and the fundamental corruption\r\nof the régime. A sober, enlightened, culture-loving people would not\r\nsubmit to the autocracy of bureaucratic dictation shown above. It makes\r\nideal \"people's houses,\" but takes care that as far as possible, this\r\nhouse be kept free from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nRUSSIA'S FINANCIAL FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a long and exhaustive conversation about the material welfare of\r\nthe Russian people with a statesman to whose identity I am not at\r\nliberty to furnish even the slightest clew, if I am faithfully to carry\r\nout my promise to guard against his recognition as my informant. They\r\nwere several hours of searching criticism, such as I had never listened\r\nto, from a man who through long years had himself been active in a\r\nprominent position, an outpouring quite permeated by the most hopeless\r\npessimism, and stated with a passion that contrasted oddly with the gray\r\nhair and deeply furrowed face of the speaker. My references to him were\r\nof such a nature that he felt it safe to allow himself the most\r\nuncompromising plainness of statement. But I carried away the impression\r\nthat it would be sufficient to give the Russian statesmen the\r\npossibility to speak freely, and there would be left no stone unturned\r\nin that wicked structure that is called \"the Russian government,\" so\r\ngreat is already the accumulation of bitter anger even among those of\r\nwhom it would be supposed that they are the real leaders of the state.\r\nThe autocracy cannot even utilize the forces that are at its disposal.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, fate is cruelly upsetting all our calculations with this war,\"\r\nsaid the statesman, in answer to my question as to the probable effect\r\nof the war on the Russian economy. \"No one even suspects what\r\ncatastrophe we are facing, thanks to the policy that is just now\r\ncelebrating its greatest triumph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not that a paradox, your excellency?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all. The triumph of our policy is the money reserve at our\r\ndisposal, which enables us to mobilize without borrowing. But only\r\nnearsightedness can find therein additional justification of this\r\neconomic policy, which, on the contrary, receives with its triumph also\r\nits death-blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I have a fuller explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be easily given. Financial and fiscal considerations have\r\ndestroyed our economy. You are surprised at this statement. But one must\r\nunderstand this system. The creation of a gold-reserve, the formation of\r\na fiscal balance even at the expense of the internal forces of the\r\nnation, are, under certain conditions a necessity. For a backward\r\nagrarian state it is necessary, before all else, to join the more\r\nadvanced countries in fiscal economy and guaranteed values, and if that\r\nrequires sacrifices, it pays, in the end, in the greater credit\r\nfacilities, I might say by the greater financial defense of the state.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your excellency believes that the internal development of the\r\nnation was thereby neglected, just as an athlete develops the muscles of\r\nhis limbs at the expense of his heart muscles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; I accept the analogy. We have increased our fighting\r\nefficiency, and have paid for it by internal weakening. I repeat that\r\nthere was no other way, if we ever were to pass from the natural to the\r\nmoney system. This would be the right time to employ the credit thus\r\nsecured for internal strengthening. But the war has upset our\r\ncalculations and not only has it consumed our cash reserves, but will\r\nalso compel us to make new sacrifices. We are in the position of a man\r\nwho is still out of breath from running, but must begin running anew in\r\norder to save his life, and may only too easily get a stroke of\r\napoplexy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has not the industrial development in the western part of the country\r\nstrengthened the national finances?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; on the contrary, it has involved sacrifices. And we cannot expect\r\nsalvation from these either. We have a yearly increase of two million\r\nsouls, and our entire industry does not employ more than two million\r\nworkmen. Our national existence must still depend for a long time on our\r\nagriculture, and this, so far from advancing, is becoming poorer from\r\nyear to year.\"\r\n\r\n\"On account of the industrial policy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but you should not forget that this industrial policy has by no\r\nmeans mastered the system. Nay, had the spirit whence our industrial\r\npolicy originated been the ruling spirit, our agriculture would also\r\nhave been in a better position; for that is the spirit of enlightenment.\r\nBut now the strength of the soil is decreasing; and the peasant has no\r\nmanure, nor is he acquainted with any system of cropping under changed\r\nconditions of fertility.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why is nothing done for the uplifting of his economic insight?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must ask that of the gentlemen of the almighty police and not of\r\nme. I am of the humble opinion that hunger is beneficial neither to the\r\nsoul nor to the body; but in that department where there is more power\r\nthan in ours, it is believed that knowledge is under all conditions\r\ninjurious to the soul. Also, that too many people should not come\r\ntogether and take counsel of one another; in the opinion of our\r\ngovernment, no good can come of it. We had appointed commissions for the\r\nuplifting of the peasantry, for road-construction, for the regulation of\r\nquestions of credit; but always the results were only conflicts between\r\nthe provincial corporations, the zemstvos, and the government.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the cause of these conflicts?\"\r\n\r\n\"The tradition and the guiding principle of the present system, which I\r\ncan only designate as the principle of gagging. An administration that\r\ndoes not oppress the peasantry is not yet to be thought of. Our peasant\r\nneeds nothing so much as travelling agricultural teachers. But what\r\nwould be the end of such teaching? To Siberia direct. Fear of the\r\nintelligent classes has already become a mania. Intelligence, if it\r\npleases you, is revolution; only no contact with Liberal elements. The\r\nsalvation of our people lies in its isolation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is the régime of a conquered country! Are not the rulers\r\nthemselves Russians? How can they be so cruel to their own flesh?\"\r\n\r\n\"The police official is no Russian. He is quite free from national\r\nsentiment; he is only an oppressor, a detective. Our ministry of the\r\ninterior is merely a great detective bureau, a monstrous and costly\r\nsurveillance institution. When the notorious 'third division' was\r\nabolished and subordinated to the ministry of the interior it was\r\nconsidered a step in advance. But it was not the ministry of the\r\ninterior that absorbed the 'third division,' but the reverse. We no\r\nlonger have administration, but only surveillance, arrest, deportation.\r\nShall I tell you? Our commission worked honestly. It consisted of\r\nnoblemen, high-minded patriots, who took part in working out a project\r\nfor the improvement of economic conditions. Only three hundred copies of\r\nthe report were printed; it was not meant for general circulation. But\r\nthe result of the labors undertaken at our instance was the arrest of\r\nthe outspoken, upright critics. Do you consider that an encouragement\r\nfor patriotic endeavor? Our merchants and our zemstvos have opened, in\r\nthe last six years, one hundred and thirty-six schools without one kopek\r\nof state aid, and with a yearly expenditure of four million rubles. The\r\ninstinct for what is necessary is therefore present. Our society should\r\nonly be let alone and we also might go through the same development,\r\nperhaps in a slower measure, which Germany has passed through with such\r\nmomentous success in the last thirty years--from an agricultural state\r\ndependent on the weather to a mighty industrial country. But Germany is\r\na constitutional state and we are a police state. Germany has a middle\r\nclass; we have none, and the formation of such a class is prevented by\r\nevery possible means. The commercial schools are subjected to annoying\r\nconditions because they are under the jurisdiction of the ministry of\r\nfinance, where, naturally, a different spirit prevails. The commercial\r\nguilds are making enormous material sacrifices, spending annually,\r\nbesides the four millions for maintenance, five additional millions on\r\nbuildings, only to retain their autonomy, to keep in their own hands the\r\nstaffs of instruction and inspection, and to possess a greater\r\nelasticity of adaptation to local conditions. This sacrifice is\r\noverlooked, and the slightest exhibition of free initiative is jealously\r\nsuppressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency, I find that one cannot discuss the least question of\r\npedagogy or economics in Russia without touching high politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true. You may see from that to what a pass we have come. We have\r\nbeen going backward uninterruptedly for the last twenty years. The\r\nnobility is losing its estates because it has not learned to manage\r\nthem, and has not recovered to this very day from the abolition of\r\nserfdom. But the land does not fall into the hands of the peasants, who\r\nneed it, but into those of the merchants. The agricultural proletariat\r\nremains unprovided for. The peasant cannot raise the taxes. The soil\r\nhere gives fourfold returns; in Germany eightfold returns. It pays at\r\nthe same time, this side of the Dnieper, ten to fifteen per cent.\r\nannually for tenure; in England two to three per cent.; in France and\r\nGermany four to five per cent.; and on the other side of the Dnieper,\r\nwhere long tenures are in vogue, five to six per cent. Remember that\r\nthis is a yearly tenure. It is a premium on soil robbery. Sixty rubles\r\nfor the tenure of one desyatin. The peasant cannot raise that amount,\r\nand yet he is compelled at the same time to pay taxes. Year after year\r\nhunger visits entire governments, for the peasants are utterly\r\nimpoverished and have not even seed. With an empty stomach and a dark\r\nmind the peasant must bear family, communal, and government burdens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I read something similar two years ago in a book by an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean _The Russian Conditions_, by Lanin, from the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, your excellency. But I considered the description\r\noverdrawn. Moreover, I cannot conceive how abuses could be so clearly\r\npainted as in that book, the statements of which your excellency now\r\nconfirms, without any prospects of redress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is to give redress?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Czar.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Czar is living behind a Wall of China. He has never visited a\r\n'duma' (city council), never a zemstvo (district council), never a\r\nvillage, never an industrial centre. He is kept by the camarilla in\r\nconstant dread, and is so closely watched that he sees not a\r\nfinger's-breadth of heaven, much less of earth. He rejoices when an\r\noccasional quarrel breaks out among the ministers, for he then has the\r\nopportunity to learn here and there a fragment of truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does no one succeed in representing to him conditions as they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will make a confession to you. Not very long ago I myself prepared a\r\npaper, not bearing my name--that would have offered certain\r\ndifficulties--but anonymous, and had it transmitted to the Czar by a\r\ntrustworthy person. For eight days there was great joy at the court. The\r\nEmperor and the Empress were delighted to know where the trouble lay and\r\nhow it was to be remedied. Then the whole matter, as it were, vanished\r\nand was forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that already is pathological.\"\r\n\r\nA shrug of the shoulders was his answer. \"Above all things there is the\r\ngreat anxiety and fear at the responsibility. There is also a weakness\r\non account of conscientious scruples. The Emperor knows nothing\r\nthoroughly enough to enable him to overcome the arguments of a skilled\r\nsophist, and he is too indulgent to say to one of his counsellors, 'Sir,\r\nyou are a cheat.' He hears in the reports only praise of somebody, never\r\nany censure. For he has a great dread of intrigue, and not without good\r\nreason. The atmosphere is a fearful one in the vicinity of every\r\nautocrat. The Czar is pathetically well-meaning, and is modesty itself,\r\nbut he is not the autocrat for an autocracy, who must be equal to his\r\ntask.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what, in your excellency's opinion, should be done to help the\r\ncountry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No more than the rest of the world has already accomplished. Abolition\r\nof the police system, security of personal freedom, abolition of the\r\ncensorship, discontinuance of the persecution of sectarians, who are our\r\nbest subjects, and--I say the word quietly--a constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"And would the country really be helped thereby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unconditionally. With these little concessions to-day any political\r\nconvulsion could be avoided, and the intelligent class freed from its\r\nfetters. No one knows what will be offered ten years from now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there prospects of this concession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the slightest. On the contrary, whoever falls under the suspicion\r\nof unconditional approval of the present system may be morally destroyed\r\nat any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will then be the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"That the terror from above will awaken the terror from below, that\r\npeasant revolts will break out--even now the police must be augmented in\r\nthe interior--and assassination will increase.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is there no possibility of organizing the revolution so that it\r\nshall not rage senselessly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible. Our rural nobleman is, to be sure, not a junker; but the\r\nstrength of the régime consists in the exclusion of any understanding\r\nbetween the land-owners and the peasants because of the social and\r\nintellectual chasm between them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency, I remember a saying of Strousberg's, who was a good\r\nbusiness man, 'There is nowhere a hole where there once was land.' One\r\nlearns to doubt that here in Russia. There is not one with whom I have\r\nspoken who would fail to paint the future of this country in the darkest\r\ncolors. Can there be no change of the fatal policy that is ruining the\r\ncountry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not before a great general catastrophe. When we shall be compelled, for\r\nthe first time, partly to repudiate our debts--and that may happen\r\nsooner than we now believe--on that day, being no longer able to pay our\r\nold debts with new ones--for we shall no longer be able to conceal our\r\ninternal bankruptcy from foreign countries and from the Emperor--steps\r\nwill be taken, perhaps, towards a general convention. No sooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no mistake possible here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Martin Luther hesitated as long as he had not seen the pope, no longer\r\nafter that. Whoever, like myself, has known the state kitchen for the\r\nlast twenty-five years, doubts no longer. The autocracy is not equal to\r\nthe problems of a modern great power, and it would be against all\r\nhistorical precedents to assume that it would voluntarily yield without\r\nexternal pressure to a constitutional form of government.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must wish, then, for Russia's sake, that the catastrophe come as\r\nquickly as possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"I repeat to you that it is perhaps nearer than we all think or are\r\nwilling to admit. That is the hope; that is our secret consolation.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of my long interview with one of the best judges\r\nof present-day Russia, from which I have omitted only those places and\r\nversions which would render their author easily recognizable. For the\r\nrest, I must say here that, with slight variations, the statements of\r\nall the other competent persons whom I had the opportunity to meet\r\nagreed with those of my present informant. The unwritten public opinion\r\nof Russia is absolutely of the same mind in its judgment of existing\r\nconditions; it differs only as to the remedies.\r\n\r\n\"We are near to collapse--an athlete with great muscles and perhaps\r\nincurable heart weakness,\" repeated the statesman at parting. \"We still\r\nmaintain ourselves upright by stimulants, by loans, which, like all\r\nstimulants, only help to ruin the system more quickly. With that we are\r\na rich country with all conceivable natural resources, simply\r\nill-governed and prevented from unlocking its resources. But is this the\r\nfirst time that quacks have ruined a Hercules that has fallen into their\r\nhands? Whoever shall free us from these quacks will be our benefactor.\r\nWe need light and air, and we shall then surprise the world by our\r\nabilities and achievements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN FINANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after the Port Arthur naval catastrophe that I sought out\r\na bank director, with whom I had become acquainted, to talk with him\r\nupon the financial effects of the war, that had had such noteworthy\r\nresults on the floors of European exchanges. To my astonishment, I found\r\nthe comfortable bank director very calm.\r\n\r\n\"The system will still help us out,\" said he, evasively, to my question\r\nwhether Russia would have to face a financial crisis after the war.\r\n\r\n\"What system?\" said I.\r\n\r\nThe bank director adjusted his eye-glasses and, with round eyes, gazed\r\nat me for a while. Then, with that burst of candor which so often\r\nsurprises us in the Russians, he began:\r\n\r\n\"We are not children, after all, and neither you nor I is dancing to the\r\ngovernment music to which others are keeping time. We may, therefore,\r\ntalk it over calmly. Well, we have a great drum, with which there can be\r\nno marching out of line. It drums. We have never as yet stopped our\r\npayments, like France, Austria, or Turkey. We are, therefore, punctual\r\npayers, hence we shall again secure money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this a serious argument?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" was the answer. \"We have paid to secure future credit. But\r\nit seems that this policy of honest debtor is wiser than the occasional\r\ndiscontinuance of payment, which allows some advance but involves the\r\nloss of credit. We can always repeat to the public that wishes to buy\r\nour bonds, 'Russia is honest; Russia pays; you need have no fear here of\r\nshrinkage.' And so the public buys.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the banker must know that the liberality is not real,\" I rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"And if he does know it? Is it the banker's business to initiate the\r\npublic into the secret sciences? Do not forget that no government pays\r\nto the world such commissions for loans as we do. Prussia pays one-half\r\nper cent., Austria one and a half per cent., we pay three per cent.;\r\nand, confidentially, it does not end with that, but the issuing banks\r\nalso get their six per cent., especially when they appear reluctant at\r\nfirst. For what reason should a commission of three to six per cent. be\r\npaid where the business is as bad as it is? It was Offenheim who said,\r\n'You don't build railroads by moral maxims.' And high finance says that\r\ndividends and bonuses are not paid with moral maxims.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to my perhaps unbusiness-like opinion, this is not much\r\nbetter than stealing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very unbusiness-like, indeed, my friend. The banking world needs no\r\nNietzsche to stand on the other side of good and evil. Ethics, like\r\nreligion, is only for the masses. Just calculate what a commission of\r\nthree to six per cent. means on a loan of five hundred to a thousand\r\nmillion rubles that we shall surely need in this war. Let us say only\r\nthree per cent., officially. That means thirty millions--more than sixty\r\nmillion marks. Do you then think that the banks belong to the Salvation\r\nArmy, to imagine that they should renounce such a transaction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Slowly, slowly. You said at first that Russia will need in this war\r\nabout a milliard rubles. That would be contrary to what I have heard\r\nfrom other very reliable sources--namely, that the cash reserve is\r\nsupposedly equal to about a milliard rubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will bet you that in three months we shall not have left a single\r\nkopek of this milliard, assuming that it exists. In agreement with\r\nmilitary experts, who, between ourselves, are not at all optimistic, I\r\nestimate the duration of this war at twelve to eighteen months at least.\r\nWith our management, every month costs us at least a hundred million\r\nrubles. Thus you see that a milliard will not be sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us say that the banks cannot reject the business, still they\r\nmust, in the first place, dispose of the securities, which will not be\r\nso easy, since the French are thoroughly satiated with the bonds, and,\r\nas the fall in the rate of exchange has recently shown, confidence in\r\nthese bonds is no longer any too great.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may drop still further,\" said the banker, smiling. \"The fall in\r\nthe rate of exchange would have been still worse had not our banks\r\nreceived a strict order not to turn over the deposited bonds to their\r\nowners during these days of convulsion.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? I do not understand this. The issue of the deposited securities to\r\ntheir owners is delayed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my friend, that is being done. You again do me the honor to forget\r\nin my office that we are in Russia. Even worse things are done here. At\r\nthe order of the minister of finance, the owners of the bonds who wish\r\nto withdraw their deposits are given only a few hundreds or thousands of\r\nrubles for the most pressing needs, but they do not get their bonds.\r\nThis is in order to prevent, by all means, the bonds being thrown on the\r\nmarket and thus increasing the panic.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that can be done only here. You have no such power abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the first alarm did cost a respectable sum. Then the foreign\r\nbondholders came to the rescue and intervened for their own interest.\r\nThe price of the bonds was maintained, especially in Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why particularly in Germany?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it fluctuates less in France. There it is in the hands of small\r\ninvestors who do not run to the treasury at the first opportunity. It is\r\nnot as strongly intrenched in Germany, and must be supported there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, you support my reasoning, and you say that the bond\r\nvalues are maintained artificially alone. How can you say, then, that\r\nthey may be augmented at will by new issues?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that, because the buyers are an amorphous mass that crystallizes\r\njust as little as a combination of producers is met by a combination of\r\nconsumers. The masses may be frightened for a while, but in the long run\r\nthey are irresistibly led to spoliation by the great combinations of\r\ncapital, and the act of creating current opinion is well known in high\r\nfinancial circles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget the independent press.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker made a very peculiar grimace. Then he said: \"That is not nice\r\nof you. I am speaking to you as if to a member of the profession--like\r\none augur to another. And when we come to speak of your own profession,\r\nyou turn out to be a simpleton. How can you speak of an independent\r\npress, when under the pressure of the high finance of the Russian and\r\nGerman governments?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will pardon me. I honor your uprightness equally with that of the\r\ngreatest of my profession. But I must stop at that. Newspapers are still\r\nguided by morality. And I am willing to bet anything that among our\r\nGerman papers only a vanishing fraction is susceptible to the arguments\r\nof Witte and his associates.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what becomes, then, of the millions that our ministry of finance\r\nis spending to secure good will in the papers towards our finances?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to suspect any one; but the German papers that I know\r\nwell are incorruptible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us say that the radical or socialistic press is inaccessible,\r\nand cannot be bought either by our ministry of finance or by the German\r\nbank combinations. There still remains the influence of the German\r\ngovernment, that has its reasons for not allowing the weakening of\r\nRussia to too great an extent. For this is still the keystone of the\r\nconservative system in Europe, and this influence suffices to keep the\r\nunfriendly critics of our financial conditions from all the leading\r\nGerman papers. That is not even an official favor. I consider it quite\r\nlogical for serious papers not to play mean tricks on their foreign\r\noffice. But as to the other, the extremely radical writings, they have\r\nno significance for the financial world; and you will not doubt, at this\r\nday, that Germany is doing her best to keep us in good humor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see with shame and resentment how the German government has been\r\ntransformed into something akin to a Russian police ally, with the\r\nblessing of Count Bülow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who surely knows what he is doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I myself do not believe that Germany has reason to seek Russian\r\nsecurity, even though there be certain limits even for friendly\r\nservices; which limits have long been passed, to the detriment of the\r\ndignity of the German empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am also willing to believe all that you have told me about the\r\ninfluence of the high finance, the Russian noble, and German diplomacy.\r\nYet I cannot conceive how the mass of investors--and after all it is\r\nthey who are to be considered--will permanently pay a much higher price\r\nfor securities than corresponds to their intrinsic value, as is the case\r\nwith the Russian securities, according to the information given me by\r\nRussian statesmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permanently? Some day it will stop. But when? Even the autocracy or the\r\nsocial structure will not maintain itself permanently. But meanwhile\r\nthere is no power on earth to prevent the great banking institutions\r\nfrom earning thirty million rubles or more, when there is a chance.\r\nThere will be a great bargaining, especially since the French government\r\nwill exert itself strenuously to prevent future issue of Russian bonds;\r\nfor every new issue depresses the value of former issues, and in these a\r\ngreat portion of the French national wealth is invested. In the end,\r\nhowever, German influence will prevail. Germany will advance us the new\r\nfunds, because Germany wishes to render us a service; for Germany feels\r\nitself from day to day more and more isolated in Europe, and we are\r\nstill not to be despised, either as friends or enemies, in spite of Port\r\nArthur. Hence the German investor must help out; and, after all, he is\r\nnot making a bad transaction when he buys a four-per-cent. bond at let\r\nus say ninety.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the bank interest is now three per cent. When four rubles are\r\npaid on an investment of ninety rubles having a par value of one hundred\r\nrubles, then the valuation of Russian government securities is not quite\r\nseventy. And that may continue for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you consider that the real, intrinsic value?\"\r\n\r\n\"The stock exchange knows no intrinsic value. It only knows tendencies.\r\nOne hundred rubles' worth of Russian government securities can always be\r\ndisposed of at seventy, if all the strings do not break.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are evading me. I asked for your personal opinion on the intrinsic\r\nvalue of the Russian bonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give you an answer. As long as our Russian peasant is able to\r\nstarve and to sell his grain, as long as there are gendarmes to aid the\r\ntax-collector, and people who are willing to make further loans to us,\r\nso long is the payment of coupons assured. Beyond that the foreign\r\nbondholder has no right to inquire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please tell me whether in your opinion there is a hidden deficit in the\r\nRussian budget, or whether there is none.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am telling you that as long as there are people who are willing to\r\nmake further loans to us we shall pay the interest. Were our budget a\r\nreal one, we should not need to contract new debts in order to pay the\r\ninterest on the old ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I wanted to know. And do you consider Russia a really\r\ninsolvent country, that cannot really pay its debts, and cannot bear the\r\nburdens of modern national life?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, Russia is intrinsically so rich a land in uncovered\r\ntreasures that it only needs another and a just régime to pay its debts\r\nand to assume still further burdens.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this other régime?\"\r\n\r\nThe banker pointed to the east. \"Our future is being decided there. If\r\nit goes hard with us there, it may become better here more quickly than\r\nis suspected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hence, worse for the bankers,\" said I, jokingly.\r\n\r\n\"People accustom themselves to honesty when there is no other way,\"\r\nanswered the banker, also jokingly. \"And when universal honesty comes\r\ninto vogue, it will no longer be a shame to be honest.\"\r\n\r\nWith this I parted from the banker, whose pleasing cynicism always\r\namused me, the more so since I recognized in him the essence of\r\nsterling, honorable views. Later interviews with other members of the\r\nfinancial world showed me that my first informant conveyed the generally\r\naccepted opinion. Isolated Germany will, for political reasons, and as a\r\nfavor to the Russian régime, support Russian credit; the great German\r\nbanks will not renounce the splendid loan-issuing business; and the\r\nGerman investor will permit the imposition upon him of the Russian\r\nbonds. \"Sheep must be shorn,\" coolly said one of the brokers to me, when\r\nI expressed a doubt that the German imperial government would pay for\r\nits political business with the hard-earned pennies of its investors.\r\nYour Bismarck did not hesitate for a moment to throw Russian values into\r\nthe street, and to destroy thereby milliards of German property, when it\r\nsuited his political convenience. Your present government will not be at\r\nall embarrassed in sacrificing again milliards of German property to\r\nplace us under obligation. And, finally, no one is compelled to it.\r\nWhoever is not able to figure sufficiently to see how Wishnegradski\r\nprepared the balances to deceive the eye had better keep his money in\r\nhis stocking and not buy securities. If he does buy them, let him bleed.\r\nAnother explained, however: \"The Germans will buy our bonds. When no\r\nother bait is attractive there is still one left to us. When the\r\nlandowner sells his crops, and is thinking of investing his proceeds,\r\nthe banker will say to him, 'How about a little of the Russian\r\nsecurities?' 'But those are supposed to be insecure,' answers the good\r\nfellow. 'The idea! This is only a Jewish trick. Probably on account of\r\nKishinef.' And the good fellow will hand over his shekels, for he cannot\r\nbe fooled about Kishinef.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nA FUNERAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are here at an opportune moment,\" said one of my St. Petersburg\r\nfriends, who had rendered me important services in my studies.\r\n\"Mikhailovski died suddenly, and will be buried to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mikhailovski?\" I was almost ashamed to admit that I was entirely\r\nignorant of the services of this man, and did not understand what\r\ninterest his funeral could have for me. My friend had pronounced the\r\nname as if no tolerably well-educated person in all the wide world could\r\nhave the least doubt as to its significance. I had to acknowledge again\r\nhow little we, in the West, know of Russian life. I am not of the people\r\nwho have read least about Russia, but Mikhailovski's name was as\r\nunfamiliar to me as that of Julius Rodenberg to a Chinaman.\r\n\r\nMy friend enlightened me. Mikhailovski was the editor of the most widely\r\nread Russian monthly, _Ruskoye Bogatstvo_ (Russian Wealth), a\r\nsociologist, and the recognized intellectual leader of radical young\r\nRussia. Nowhere in the world do the weekly and monthly magazines play\r\nsuch a rôle in the intellectual life of a nation as in the great Slavic\r\nempire. This may be accounted for, on the one hand, by the meagre\r\ndevelopment of the daily press, existing under strict censorship, and on\r\nthe other by the high degree of scientific and practical development.\r\nThe nation is still in a state of nature, and for such a nation there is\r\nreally but one vocation--that of general education. This need of general\r\nculture is in accordance with the general modelling of Russian social\r\nlife. There is very extensive and fruitful social intercourse; visitors\r\non estates remain for weeks. This requires a periodically renewed supply\r\nof topics for conversation. And, finally, the nation is in a state of\r\nhigh political tension. Parliamentary debates wherein this political\r\ntension may be discharged are entirely lacking. Thus there remains only\r\nthe home-bred discussions, which, again, are fed only by the reviews.\r\nThus it happens that the weekly and monthly publications serve at once\r\nas books, newspapers, and parliaments, and that the greatest writers are\r\nenrolled either as contributors or editors on the staffs of the reviews.\r\nMikhailovski, however, was jointly with the writer Korolenko the editor\r\nof the greatest radical monthly; a man who was the object of a reverence\r\nsuch as is only accorded in the West to a great orator or party leader.\r\n\r\n\"Plehve is a lucky dog,\" continued my friend. \"The outbreak of the war\r\nhas forced the entire Russian opposition camp into an armistice. It\r\nwould be considered unpatriotic to create internal difficulties for the\r\ngovernment, that needs all its power for an external conflict. It is at\r\nleast intended to see whether there would be any new provocations on\r\nPlehve's part before further steps are taken in the organization of the\r\nopposition. At any other time an occasion like Mikhailovski's funeral\r\nwould lead to great demonstrations and collisions with the Cossacks. Now\r\nit will only amount to expressions of devotion; and it is quite probable\r\nalso that the police will avoid a collision. Hence, you may take part\r\nwithout danger in a demonstration by intellectual St. Petersburg, where,\r\nat any other time, you would be exposed at least to a few blows of the\r\nknout or a temporary arrest at the police station.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you speak of the knout and the Cossacks?\" I asked. \"Are not the\r\npolice sufficient to maintain order?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not sufficient in mass-demonstrations, especially where these\r\nare participated in by the student body. Formerly use was made of the\r\n\"dvorniks\" (janitors) and butchers' clerks to bring the students to\r\nreason. But that is no longer practicable. The \"dvorniks\" and butchers'\r\nclerks have hesitated of late to come out against the students. They\r\nhave discovered that these persons really take their lives in their\r\nhands for the people's sake, and, therefore, are no longer willing to do\r\nthe jailer's work. And so the Cossacks must hold forth; and they know no\r\npity.\"\r\n\r\nWe therefore agreed to meet in front of the deceased publicist's house.\r\nSuch a Russian funeral is a full day's work. It begins early in the\r\nforenoon, and it is dark when you return home. In front of\r\nMikhailovski's house I saw Korolenko--a still robust man, with very\r\ncurly gray hair and beard--and almost all the master-minds of the\r\nintellectual life of St. Petersburg. Even the recently retired minister,\r\nSänger, showed himself. Many a man was named to me with great reverence.\r\nThe foreign public knows not one of them, and so I may forego the\r\nrepetition of their names. It should be mentioned here, however, that in\r\nRussia a distinguished man tries to show his distinction by his dress\r\nand appearance, as far as possible. Here an original way of dressing the\r\nhair is one of the marks of distinction, and so one sees many striking\r\nheads. There is no getting along without some posing. I noticed, too,\r\nthat scarcely one of the forty or fifty men I had become acquainted with\r\nwas absent from the funeral. Now, these forty or fifty persons belong to\r\nmost widely different social and political groups, so that the radical\r\npublicist could not have possibly had the same significance for each of\r\nthem. But every one was present and was noticed. In fact, every new\r\nappearance was noted by the crowd. Most of them knew one another. The\r\nloose but yet effective organization of opposition in Russia had never\r\nbeen so clear to me as now. The unwritten public opinion, I had\r\nfrequently noted, orders every intellectual to take part in this mute\r\ndemonstration against the régime; and this dictation is more readily\r\nsubmitted to than the legitimate one. I do not believe our newspapers in\r\nthe West could even approximately replace this intimate contact\r\nestablished day by day among these thousands in a manner mysterious to\r\nme. It is as if St. Petersburg were fermented by some medium in which\r\nevery impulse is propagated with furious speed. And people have an\r\nincredible amount of time for politics in St. Petersburg. People in\r\nRussia have in general more time than we hurrying Westerners can\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nThe coffin was carried from the house, where a religious service had\r\nalready taken place, to the church across the street, and there a new\r\nservice was begun. The church was so quickly filled that hundreds had to\r\nremain outside. But I was advised by my companion to go to the cemetery;\r\nfor the funeral proper takes place only there, and it is of importance\r\nto secure a good place. We attended to various matters in the city, and\r\nreached, after more than a half-hour's ride in the sleigh, the cemetery\r\nwhere rest the city's celebrities. Names are again mentioned to me with\r\nrespect and reverence. What an unsubstantial thing is fame, after all.\r\nThe few sounds that fill one with awe fall on the unheeding ear of\r\nanother. Another sphere, and nothing remains of the words that are\r\nesteemed in the first.\r\n\r\nWe stamp through the snow along the narrow paths between the\r\ngravestones towards the spot where the deceased is to find his last\r\nresting-place. A densely packed multitude is already pushing towards the\r\nnewly dug grave. Near-by a mausoleum, with open portico, is already\r\nentirely occupied by women. We attempt to find a place there. We are met\r\nby hostile glances. Then one of the ladies approaches me and says\r\nsomething in Russian, which, of course, I do not understand. I express\r\nmy regrets in German and French. She now excuses herself, declaring that\r\nshe had made a mistake. A word from my companion, and the excitement is\r\nat once allayed.\r\n\r\n\"It was nothing,\" he explained to me. \"They did not know whether you\r\nwere a spy or a foreigner. They know it now, and are no longer uneasy.\r\nPeople know one another in this circle. But you are an entirely new\r\nperson that must first be classified.\" Evidently my companion played a\r\nprominent part in this society without statutes, for a place was made\r\nfor me with the greatest readiness; so that I found myself among none\r\nbut celebrities, whose names were mentioned by the young ladies standing\r\nnear in respectful whispers. They were mostly writers, scholars, and\r\nprofessors; among them was also the author of a work on Siberia, which I\r\nhad read with horror years ago. He had already spent twelve years of his\r\nlife in exile, and now he was again exposing himself to oppression by\r\nthe authorities. Although the police were still out of sight, it would\r\nhave hardly been advisable for a spy to appear here. Among the thousands\r\nof men, women, and girls who were already densely crowded about the\r\ngrave, there was not a single person that was not acquainted with at\r\nleast a part of those present. Suddenly there was a commotion in the\r\ncrowd. A name is mentioned and repeated resentfully. Suvorin. Who is\r\nSuvorin? The editor of the _Novoye Vremya_. He was supposedly seen by\r\nsome one. What impudence! Where is he? He shall at once leave the\r\ncemetery! But it was only a false alarm. Suvorin would not dare to come\r\nhere; and why not? I inquire about the nature of his paper. Is it a\r\n_Libre Parole_ or _Intransigeant_? Is it nationalistic or clerical? An\r\nold gentleman who hears my question replies, turning towards me:\r\n\"No-ism, scoundrelism.\" I see how the word is winged and is approvingly\r\nrepeated in a widening circle. Yes, the most widely circulated sheet in\r\nRussia, which enjoys government patronage and the best and most\r\nauthentic news from all the departments, is branded here with the\r\ndeepest contempt by the flower of Russian intelligence as a\r\nwell-poisoner, a worthless cynic. Russia is surely a remarkable land, it\r\ndoes not grant a license for baseness even to anti-Semitism. The hours\r\nfollow one another. The snow under our feet had turned to water, and\r\nthen again to ice, but it is no longer possible to leave one's place. We\r\nare ranged shoulder to shoulder, the men scarcely able to make room\r\nenough for the women to keep them from being crushed against the trees\r\nand gravestones. An elderly woman, with remarkably delicate features,\r\nand wrapped in a thin cloak, is standing quite near me. She has been\r\nhere since ten o'clock this morning--that is, more than four hours. I\r\nfeel almost ashamed of my fur coat and my felt overshoes when I see that\r\nbit of intelligent poverty standing near me. My neighbor and myself\r\nsucceed, without her noticing it, in placing her between our coats, so\r\nthat she might feel somewhat warmer. And thus thousands of women and\r\ngirls are standing, old and young, down to the unsophisticated\r\nschool-girl, pretty and homely, all of them patient and orderly; and\r\nwhat impressed me especially was the absence of the least trace of\r\nflirting between the men and women students. All of them were possessed\r\nby one sentiment--by political passion and the yearning for freedom. I\r\nam not foolish enough to think that in Russia erotic tendencies are\r\neliminated in the intercourse between the youth of the opposite sexes,\r\nbut nothing of it is noticeable here, and I must assume from this that\r\nfrivolity and cynicism have no abode in this generation. All those who\r\nare standing here run the gantlet of imprisonment and deportation, and\r\nfrivolous thoughts have no room here.\r\n\r\nWe hear, at last, the indistinct noise that heralds the approach of a\r\ngreat crowd of people. Then the noise becomes more differentiated--it\r\nchanges into song. It is the student body following the coffin with\r\nsongs of mourning over the miles of road. They sing beautifully, in\r\nwonderful polyphonic choirs, do the Russians; even envy must follow the\r\nsong. They have a perfect ear. After the long waiting the final\r\ndeliverance through its solemn notes affects the heart strangely. And\r\nnow a new wave of approaching humanity. The impossible becomes possible,\r\nthe students crowd past us and gather about the grave. The coffin is\r\nlifted over our heads and into the noose of the dull gravedigger. A\r\nmoment of silence. Then the pope reads a short prayer and gives a short\r\nfuneral sermon on the departed brother in Christ. Then only does the\r\nfuneral ceremony proper begin. The pope steps aside. A white-haired man,\r\na university professor, whose name passes from mouth to mouth, extols\r\nthe departed champion of freedom. He is followed by a poet speaking in\r\nswinging verse. Then a woman. Then a student. Then a woman again, in\r\nirregular, improvised order. Then my neighbor, the man from Siberia,\r\ncalls out to the students. Then begins a song full of fervor and\r\npassion. Then a woman speaks again, and after her a young girl. The\r\npolice, hundreds of them, with many officers, are crowded quite into the\r\nbackground. It is better so. For of all the speeches I distinguished but\r\none word, spoken in passionate tones, \"Svoboda! Svoboda!\" (Liberty!\r\nLiberty!). And, as if that word were a signal, it calls forth sighs and\r\nweeping and the gnashing of teeth. It is an indescribable drama, a\r\nterribly exciting scene. I cannot control myself, and cry out to my\r\nneighbor, \"Make the poor girl keep still,\" and I point towards the\r\npolice, but I am not understood. They have all been seized by a\r\nreligious fanaticism that makes martyrdom bliss. How truly lovable they\r\nare, these educated people that still have an ideal and are strange to\r\nthe base satiety that so sadly deforms our Western youth! And how the\r\nheart contracts at the thought that all this beautiful enthusiasm must\r\nvanish without result; that the longing and inspiration are helplessly\r\nshivered against the brutality of the Cossacks and gendarmes!\r\n\r\nWe left the consecrated ground in a strange intoxication after a tiring\r\nstruggle with the densely packed crowd that would move neither forward\r\nnor backward. \"It is not the business of the police to maintain order,\r\nbut only to keep people under surveillance.\" I have been astonished to\r\nthis very day that no one was trampled to death in the crowd.\r\n\r\nI heard a few days later that the statistician Annenski, an old man of\r\nsixty-five, was arrested for having delivered one of those impassioned\r\nspeeches at the grave. A number of men of irreproachable character,\r\namong them the historian who was the first speaker there, testified that\r\nAnnenski was not one of the speakers. I could have testified to that\r\nmyself, for I stood among the speakers, and each one was named to me.\r\nBut the police would not give up its victim. Annenski was still in\r\nconfinement when I left Russia. Now he is banished to Reval for four\r\nyears, because they had found in his house a few numbers of Struve's\r\nperiodical.\r\n\r\nI, however, carried away with me from Mikhailovski's grave the certainty\r\nthat the coming generation is lost to the reaction. Young Russia, in so\r\nfar as it possesses an academic education, is liberal, both the men and\r\nthe women. And thus that funeral day was for me the most hopeful day\r\nthat I had lived in Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE CHINOVNIK (THE RUSSIAN OFFICIAL)\r\n\r\n\r\nCzar Nicholas I. is known to have been a great admirer of Gogol's\r\n\"Revizor.\" Yet a more bitter satire on Russian officialdom than this\r\nrealistic comedy does not exist. Plenty of utterances of the czars who\r\nhave followed Nicholas are quoted to show that none of the supposedly\r\nunlimited monarchs of Russia has been in the least hazy as to the\r\nqualities of his most trustworthy servants. When, nevertheless, fifty\r\nyears after the death of Nicholas I., the camorra of officials makes\r\nmore havoc than ever, and obstructs all development of the Russian\r\nnation with the close meshes of its organization, as with a net of steel\r\nwire, this strange phenomenon is to be explained only in two ways.\r\nEither the czars who so clearly recognized the evil must have been\r\nunscrupulous cynics, who only laughed at corruption and had no feeling\r\nfor the sufferings of their people, or else their power was not\r\nsufficient to break that of their servants. The omnipotence of autocracy\r\nmust have found its limits in the omnipotence of the oligarchy of\r\nfunctionaries. The first of the possible explanations may be set aside\r\nwithout further consideration. The autocrats, without exception, have\r\ndesired the good of their people, and have been personally upright men\r\nand lovers of justice. If they had been strong enough to create a\r\ntrustworthy and industrious official service, instead of their idle and\r\ncorrupt one, they would certainly have done so. Only the second\r\nexplanation, then, is possible. The power of the czardom has had to\r\ncapitulate to that of the oligarchy of officials.\r\n\r\nThis explanation, however, requires a further one. What wrecked the\r\nattempts of well-intentioned autocrats at reform? These men did not\r\nunderstand joking; and open opposition to orders of the Czar is\r\nabsolutely unthinkable, when punishments such as exile to Siberia are\r\ngiven for much slighter offences. Is it possible that the Russian nation\r\nstands morally so much lower than all others that honest and industrious\r\nservants of the state are not to be found at all? That would be hard to\r\nbelieve. For if men are approximately alike in any one particular it is\r\nin average morality. The Russian is not more immoral or dishonorable\r\nthan the German or the Frenchman. Fifty years ago the officials in\r\nAustria and Hungary also were still very corrupt, and Frederick William\r\nI. was obliged, even in morally strict Prussia, to use all his energy in\r\ntaking steps against the state officials, who acted on the principle of\r\nthe proverb, \"Give me the sausage, and I'll quench your thirst\" (Gibst\r\ndu mich die Wurscht, lösch ich dich den Durscht). Besides, the\r\nexperiment of regenerating the official service with foreigners has\r\nalso been tried in Russia, especially by Alexander II. In the imperial\r\nlibrary at St. Petersburg I came upon a little French pamphlet in which\r\na Russian patriot laments in the most passionate terms because Czar\r\nAlexander II. was surrounded by an impenetrable wall of officials from\r\nthe Baltic provinces, who let no one but their congeners rise on the\r\nrounds of the official ladder. The complaints made of the dictatorship\r\nof officials were, however, the same, although it was not denied that in\r\nindustry and honesty the Germans from the Baltic provinces surpassed the\r\nnative Russians. Under Alexander III. unmistakable orthodox opinions and\r\nthe purest possible Russian descent were necessary in order to gain the\r\ngood-will of the omnipotent Pobydonostzev and of the Slavophils. The\r\nmisery, however, remained the same, except that it was in some degree\r\nrelieved by the greater corruptibility of the native Russians. For--to\r\nshow the utter preposterousness of the whole system--the Russian people\r\nfind it much pleasanter to deal with bribe-taking officials than with\r\nhonest ones. You may hear it said often enough in Russia, \"The Russian\r\nautocracy is alleviated by the ruble; without the ruble life would not\r\nbe at all endurable.\" There must, therefore, exist some fatal cause\r\nwhich prevents any improvement of conditions. Even evils do not grow old\r\nwithout some necessary reason for their existence.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain this it must be clearly understood what the\r\nRussians really complain of in their officials. They thought themselves\r\nno better off under the system of Alexander II., with the infusion into\r\nthe service of more honest and industrious elements. Hence it appears\r\nnot to be primarily the dishonesty or idleness of the bureaucracy which\r\nprovokes the most complaints. This is, indeed, the fact. What drives the\r\nRussians to despair, and what they feel to be the grossest evil of the\r\ncountry, much more than the domination of the Czar alone, is the tyranny\r\nof the official caste, which forms a state within the state, and has set\r\nup a special code of official morality quite peculiar to itself. As to\r\nhow far the possibility of such a class development is consistent with\r\nthe autocracy as such will be inquired into below. A ring of officials\r\nis not absolutely excluded even in republics, as is shown by Tammany\r\nHall in New York. Only in constitutional states it rests with the people\r\nto put an end to evil once recognized, but in an autocracy it does not.\r\nBefore going further, however, it is necessary to make clear to the\r\nforeign reader what is meant in general by such a tyranny.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let us say, for example, that you have been seen on the\r\nstreet with a person who, for some reason, and naturally without knowing\r\nit himself, is under police surveillance. Of course you yourself are\r\nfrom this moment under suspicion, and therewith delivered up to the\r\nofficial zeal of the whole, widely ramified organization, for the\r\nprotection of the holy order. From that time forth letters directed to\r\nyou do not reach you, or else bear a mark showing that by a remarkable\r\naccident they were found open in the letter-box and had to be officially\r\nsealed. You are surprised some night by the visit of an officer and of a\r\ndozen sturdy police officials, who rouse your children from their beds\r\nand search through your house from garret to cellar. If there should\r\nhappen to be found in your possession a German translation of a novel of\r\nTolstoï's, or any book or newspaper which stands on the police index,\r\nwith which you naturally are not acquainted, off you go to prison with\r\nthe agents of the law. Here you remain, well taken care of, pending a\r\nthorough-going investigation of the facts of the case. This lasts from\r\nthree days to six months, as the case may be, according to your\r\npopularity or to the influence which your friends are able to bring to\r\nbear. It is not the slightest protection for you that you are a\r\nwell-known householder, a busy physician or lawyer, of whom it might be\r\nassumed that even without imprisonment he would not immediately turn his\r\nback on the place of his profession. To prevent the danger of collusion,\r\nso that you may not hide the traces of your crime, you remain to the end\r\nunder lock and key, with the invaluable right to maintain yourself\r\nmeanwhile at your own expense. You will endure this little inconvenience\r\ncalmly, as becomes a man, hoping that your friends will take care of\r\nyour wife and children during this time and not let them actually\r\nstarve. It is certainly unpleasant if your pretty daughter, who is\r\nstudying history or art or philology, attracts the eye of the sacred\r\n\"hermandad\" and is carried off some night as a political suspect, and\r\nyou can find by no pleading in what prison she is kept pending\r\ninvestigation. It is still more vexatious for you to know that your\r\nyoung son, a student, is in the hands of the police, since this young\r\nman has not yet learned self-control, and may possibly come to blows\r\nwith his tormentors, who drive him so far that, finally, in order to put\r\nan end to his sufferings, he sets himself on fire with his own kerosene\r\nlamp and ends his life. I cite here only facts which came to my\r\nknowledge from the circle of highly respected families which I met\r\nduring my stay of barely seven weeks. You yourself are, according to the\r\ndegree of your offence, expelled for several years from the place of\r\nyour profession or, at the worst, exiled to Archangel or Siberia.\r\nFinally, a crime on your part is not necessary. It is sufficient that\r\nyou are not found loyal and respectful to the police.\r\n\r\nThese evidently are little unpleasantnesses which do not sweeten life\r\nfor the citizen or greatly increase his loyal sentiments. They exert,\r\nhowever, a much more injurious effect on those who are in a position to\r\ninflict such torments on people who are to any extent in their disfavor.\r\nTravellers tell of tropical madness which seizes Europeans in the\r\ntorrid zone. Since my experiences in Russia I am no longer inclined to\r\nregard this phenomenon as climatic. There is only one madness, that is\r\nthe frenzy of domination to which every morally weak person is exposed\r\nwhen his lust for power meets with little or no opposition. This\r\nphenomenon is not less well known in our barrack-rooms, where discipline\r\nbreaks down all opposition, than in prisons. Non-commissioned officers,\r\nand also many officers and prison officials, are easily seized with this\r\nmadness, which is nothing but the spirit of the Prætorian Guard on a\r\nsmall scale. The German abroad, especially the young German noble, is\r\nmost easily susceptible to it. He even likes to make up to himself a\r\nlittle in the primitive East for the strict provincial training to which\r\nhe was subjected among the loyal and more moral ideas of his home. Hence\r\nthe preference of Alexander II. for German officials caused no\r\nimprovement in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the madness of power, which in itself is bad enough,\r\nthere is, however, still another thing. The best elements in Russia do\r\nnot select the political or police services. The pay is wretched, and\r\ncan only be supplemented by illicit revenues. These illicit revenues\r\narise from prompt releases from formalities, for which the interested\r\npersons show themselves grateful, and from carrying into effect orders\r\nagainst the Jews, who, for this very reason indeed, cannot be better\r\nestablished legally, because if they were a great part of the official\r\nservice would lose a principal source of revenue from toleration-money.\r\nMen of the better class turn away as a matter of course from a career\r\nwhich depends upon such revenues. Hence it is not exactly the best who\r\nserve as executives of the power of the state. In official service there\r\nis also another aim--namely, to rise constantly to higher and more\r\nlucrative positions. For this there is only one rule, that of\r\nmaintaining absolute good conduct in the eyes of the higher authorities.\r\nThe higher authorities, however, consist of chinovniks, who have only\r\none interest, that of the supremacy of their class and the prevention of\r\nanything that could injure its omnipotence. So it goes on up to the\r\nhighest oracle; to the man to whom primarily is intrusted the protection\r\nof the Czar and of the autocracy; to the minister of the interior.\r\nImagine this office held by a man like Plehve, and you will understand\r\nwhat spirit rules under the pashas of sleepy villages down to the last\r\nprovincial hamlet. Cæsarian madness, aspiration for higher positions,\r\nclass interest, all work together to produce entirely conscienceless\r\nlibertines and barbarians, against whom there is no protection whatever.\r\nIn a land without a parliament or a free press every complaint has only\r\nthe effect of a denunciation of the devil to his grandmother. The\r\ncomplainant can by no means reckon the consequences, even if, indeed,\r\nthe culprit is not especially rewarded for his official zeal. It is\r\nmuch better to stand in with the authorities, not to kick against the\r\npricks, but to pay.\r\n\r\nAnd the Czar? Either he hears nothing of all these things or they are\r\nrepresented to him as indispensable for the preservation of order. If it\r\nis hard to make a successful stand even in constitutional states with\r\nparliament and press, in the rare enough cases of despotic justice, it\r\nis immensely harder where the protection of authority is the highest\r\nprinciple of government, and where no institution whatever exists for\r\nthe protection of the subject. It should not be at all surprising, then,\r\nthat the reign of terror from above tries to countermine the terror from\r\nbelow. Indeed, it is only a proof of the patience and gentleness of the\r\nRussian people that attempts upon official criminals are so rare. I was\r\nthe more ashamed when, during my stay in Russia, I read that German\r\nstatesmen were hurling words of condemnation against Russian patriots\r\nwho, careless of their own lives, had declared war against the brutal\r\nofficials. However far the desire to preserve a good-neighborly\r\nrelationship may go, a German politician does not need to ingratiate\r\nhimself with the Russian régime. In doing so he exposes himself to the\r\ncondemnation which that régime invariably calls forth when people know\r\nits administrative methods. German authorities ought not to lend their\r\nassistance to a body which a patriot and strong monarchist like Prince\r\nUkhtomsky, the friend of the Czar, called a Camorra, a band of\r\nanarchists in office. Our sympathies ought rather to go out to those who\r\nstrive to gain for Russia also a court where the shackled nation can\r\nbring its cry for help to a hearing--a parliament, however modest; a\r\npress not subjugated by the tyranny of the police. Only by these means\r\ncan a nation full of good qualities be freed from the reign of terror of\r\nthe chinovniks, from the Camorra of officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFERINGS OF THE JEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brutal persecutions of the Jews under Plehve have involved\r\nunspeakable misery; but a beneficial effect also, not to be\r\nunderestimated. The entire public sentiment of Russian society has\r\nbecome friendly to the Jews. In numerous conversations with inhabitants\r\nof the Russian capitals, including people from all strata of society,\r\nonly once have I heard a word expressing ill-feeling towards the Jews.\r\nThe speaker in this instance was a colonel of Cossacks, on his way to\r\nthe front, who assured me in all sincerity that the English are a \"vile\r\nJew-nation\"! With this exception, all protested against regarding the\r\nRussians as enemies of the Jews. The Jews are victims of the murderous\r\nRussian politics, like the Poles, the Ruthenians, and the Liberals. This\r\nappeared to be the generally accepted idea. The natural consequence of\r\nthis idea is that the Jews have the sympathy of all parties opposed to\r\nthe government. While the officials are bringing deliberately false\r\naccusations against the Jews, unofficial Russia sides with the latter.\r\nThe situation is similar to that which existed in the West before the\r\nemancipation of the Jews, when Liberal political doctrine was directly\r\ninculcating philo-Semitism; the only difference being that among the\r\npeople of Russia no anti-Semitic feeling whatever exists. Therefore,\r\nduring any crisis of assimilation consequent upon emancipation, there\r\nwould be little fear of an anti-Semitic reaction such as that\r\nexperienced in the West.\r\n\r\nThere is one class which is pleased by the perpetual hunting-down of the\r\nJews by the _Novoye Vremya_ and its offshoots in anti-Semitism. This is\r\nthe class of small tradesmen, notorious for their dishonesty, who are\r\nthankful that they are protected from Jewish competition. For the rest,\r\nall Russia wishes the repeal of the laws enacted in restriction of the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nThe government, of course, endeavors to persuade foreigners that to\r\npermit the Jews to settle beyond the pale would mean the Judaization,\r\nand the consequent ruin, of all Russia. This assertion is made in spite\r\nof their knowledge that the contrary is true. A memorial in regard to\r\nthe Jews, written in 1884 by Ivan Blioch, and published by the ministry\r\nof the interior--_The Jewish Question in Russia_--shows by statistics\r\nthat the greatest percentage of pauper peasants is found in the Jewless\r\ngovernments of Moscow, Tula, Orel, and Kursk; that the prosperity of the\r\npeasantry in the governments within the pale is incomparably higher than\r\nin the territory from which the Jews are excluded. The arrears of\r\nrevenue in districts in which there are no Jews are three times as great\r\nas in the pale. As a result, the land purchased by peasants by means of\r\nthe peasants' banks is much greater in extent in the latter than in the\r\nformer districts. The usurers who advance money to the peasants at from\r\nthree hundred to two thousand per cent. are without exception\r\nChristians. The assertion that the Jews tempt the people to drunkenness\r\nstands morally upon about the same level as the statement that the Jews\r\nare never found engaged in agriculture. The latter statement is true,\r\nbut only because the Jews are not allowed to live in the open country.\r\nThe government has now monopolized the retail sale of spirits, thus\r\ndriving out of the business thousands of Jewish tavern-keepers. This\r\nmeasure, however severe, is viewed with satisfaction by intelligent Jews\r\nas tending to improve the morals of the Jewish masses.\r\n\r\nAll these are only idle excuses in justification of the policy of\r\nextermination of the Jews, which policy has in reality a quite different\r\ncause. Three conditions have already been cited, any one of which is\r\nalone sufficient to place the unhappy Jews of the great prison state in\r\nan especially bad situation, and also to expose the régime in all its\r\ndepravity--a depravity almost incomprehensible to western Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe first is the great influence which the rich Russian usurers possess\r\nwith the authorities. If Shylock is angry with the merchant prince of\r\nVenice because the latter lends money without interest, in Russia the\r\nrôles of the contestants are reversed. The Jew also exacts usury where\r\nhe can--no one in seriousness pretends to be surprised at this, in view\r\nof the deliberate demoralization of the pale--but in comparison with his\r\nRussian colleague he keeps within modest limits, being indeed compelled\r\nto do so by his circumstances. He necessarily prefers to keep the debtor\r\nsolvent rather than to drive him out of house and home, which he, the\r\nJew, moreover, cannot buy in. The Russian usurer, on the other hand, is\r\naccustomed to show no mercy, because he calmly seizes the land of his\r\nvictim, and either leases it or sells it at a profit or adds it to his\r\nown property. For a great part of the Russian usurers belong to the\r\nguild of village usurers. These people influence the under authorities\r\nwith bribes, while the great speculators, the millionaire usurers of\r\nMoscow and St. Petersburg, who likewise would have to fear the milder\r\nmethods of their Jewish competitors, are powerful enough to influence\r\nsenators and ministers according to their wishes. The Russian usurer,\r\ntherefore, is the first complainant and enemy of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe second and more powerful cause is the spirit of Pobydonostzev, the\r\nfanatic of uniformity. Combining in himself the qualities of jurist,\r\ntheologian, and scholastic, he is too barren in mental powers to master\r\nthe conception of a state which should take into account any diversity\r\nof creed or race. Above all, however, any toleration would undermine the\r\nthree pillars upon which alone his conception of the Russian empire can\r\nrest--autocracy, orthodoxy, and Russianism. For the preservation of this\r\nAsiatic, uniform, absolutist régime, or, better, of the omnipotence of\r\nhierarchy, it is above all necessary to keep the people in absolute\r\nsubjection. This, again, is possible only when every chance of learning\r\nanything else than their own condition is closed to them. A prisoner who\r\nendangered the spirit of blind obedience by a tendency to dispute orders\r\ncould not be tolerated in a prison. As little can the great Russian\r\nprison state endure men who might lead the prisoner to think whether he\r\nmust be absolutely a prisoner. Of such thoughts, however, the Jews, who\r\nare subject to special taxation, are suspected above all others. Their\r\ncriminality is certainly of the smallest; they are the most punctilious\r\nof tax-payers, and, moreover, the best-conducted citizens in the world.\r\nBut they are--Heaven knows why--perhaps because of their\r\nTalmudic-dialectic occupation, perhaps also because as pariahs they have\r\nlittle cause to be enthusiastic over the ruling order--they are\r\ninexorably subtle critics of all existing things, and so could easily\r\nupset the simple minds of the Russian lower classes. That is the chief\r\nreason why they are surrounded by a cordon of plagues. The paternal\r\nprecaution of the Russian government is of course not much wiser than\r\nthe conviction so many mothers entertain of the unshaken faith of their\r\nchildren in the story that the stork brought the baby. Quite without\r\nJewish criticism the Russian peasant, under the never-resting lash of\r\nhunger, begins to think and to grumble; and although his unruly\r\nsentiments express themselves chiefly in the specifically Russian form\r\nof the organization of religious sects, nevertheless each new sectarian\r\nshows a new desertion from Pobyedonostzev's ideal of a Russian subject.\r\nUpon the organization of sects, however, the Jews have of course no\r\ndirect influence whatever.\r\n\r\nThe third cause of the persecution of the Jews is to be found in the\r\nSatanic brain of Plehve, who wishes to furnish to the humane Czar, and\r\nperhaps still more to the Czaritza, who has western European ways of\r\nthinking, an indication that without the Jews there would be no\r\nopposition whatever in Russia. For this purpose he not only has the Jews\r\nentered more strictly on the police-registers, if they are guilty of any\r\npolitical offence, such as being present in a forbidden assemblage, but\r\nhe also directly provokes them, in order to drive them into the ranks of\r\nthe revolutionaries and thereby to compromise the latter. In Hungary and\r\nBohemia ritual murder cases were incited in order to give the Jews a\r\nlesson to remember, and to make them national--_i. e._, more Magyar or\r\nCzechic--in feeling, since they stubbornly persisted in remaining\r\nGerman. In Russia, however, they are driven into the camp of the\r\nrevolutionaries, in order to extirpate the former and to cast suspicion\r\nupon the latter. Nevertheless, some governors, who in other respects\r\nreadily comply with the directions given from above, yet dare to step in\r\nin behalf of the Jews, contrary to the measures appointed by higher\r\nauthorities, as for example, Prince Urussoff, governor of Bessarabia,\r\nwho is to be thanked that in spite of all the efforts of Krushevan, the\r\ncreature of Plehve, no outbreaks of the mob against the Jews took place\r\nin Kishinef recently.\r\n\r\nAs personal but nevertheless effectual causes of the persecution of the\r\nJews, the anti-Semitism of the dowager Empress and of the Grand-Duke\r\nSergius, governor-general of Moscow, must be mentioned. Respectively\r\nbrother and wife of Alexander III., they conservatively hold to his\r\nopinions. This unfortunate and narrow-minded man had been persuaded by\r\nconscience-smitten persons that Jewish army-contractors were the cause\r\nof the defeat of the Russians in the Turkish war; and it was as hard to\r\nget an idea out of his head as to get one in. The inclination of the\r\nGrand-Duke Sergius to torture human beings amounts to a disease. He can\r\nsatisfy it most easily upon the defenceless Jews.\r\n\r\nThe final cause of the persecution of the Jews, and one which is\r\nregarded by many people as the weightiest, is the certain income which\r\nlegislation against the Jews means for every unscrupulous official.\r\nMost of the laws passed against the Jews are quite impossible of\r\nexecution, or are executed only in a very imperfect way, thanks to the\r\ncorruptibility of the Russian officials. \"Absolutism palliated by\r\ncorruption\"--this bitter saying fits the case of the Jews best. Yet what\r\nrelieves the situation for them in a certain way renders it worse for\r\nthem in another. It certainly is a question whether the ransom-money of\r\none generation will not become the purchase-money of the next. The\r\nRussian bureaucracy will not be willing to renounce its income from\r\nbribes and extortions. Thus it prevents all legislative decrees in favor\r\nof the Jews. These poorly paid, much feared, but still despised\r\nofficials are, in the inclined plane of their evil consciences, quite as\r\nmuch victims of the system as the Jews, but in a different way. We are\r\nall human, whether Christian or Jew, and in the long run, under the\r\noperation of the most depraved of all rules, neither the one nor the\r\nother can keep himself pure. The worst thing that has happened to the\r\nJews, however, is not, as can well be understood, an occasional \"pogrom\"\r\n(riot), in which, to the indignation of all civilized mankind,\r\ndefenceless people are slain and plundered by command of the\r\nauthorities. The worst is the restriction to particular zones and to\r\nparticular callings. That is systematic massacre, a deliberate policy of\r\ndestruction and extirpation. Even if the misery of the ghetto has,\r\nthanks to the strict abstemiousness of the Jews, failed as yet to kill\r\nthem in the way that the peasantry, weakened by alcoholism, are killed\r\nin the famine provinces, nevertheless the moral result is frightful.\r\nEven the iron family morality of the Jews is shaken in the western\r\ngovernments. A deplorable percentage of prostitutes is made up of\r\nJewesses. Experience shows that sexual deprivation is the beginning of\r\nevery other form of degeneration. Moreover, the matter does not\r\ngenerally end with the individual who sinks into prostitution. The\r\nethical ideas of such a morally defective person spread contagion in a\r\nwide circle. Families are broken up, or unchastity makes its way into\r\nthem. The whole conception of life becomes different when the chastity\r\nof women becomes an article of trade or an object of ironical\r\nscepticism. Still, in comparison with their environment even these Jews\r\nmay be called chaste, for they are merely stained by the barbarism of\r\nthe Orient. But it is, nevertheless, monstrous that in a Christian\r\ncountry the hard-won sexual morality of a part of the population, once\r\ngained, must be endangered only because malevolent politics will have it\r\nso. The moral purity of the Jews and of the Teutonic races has redeemed\r\nthe world from the deep depravity of the Roman decadence. Now a\r\nChristian state policy destroys a part of the iron stability of this\r\nmoral acquisition of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that whoever can tries to free himself from the\r\nmisery of the ghetto. Even Russian legislation has left some small\r\ngates open, and through these the struggling Jews squeeze themselves\r\nwith every exertion of strength and cunning. Then there ensues a battle\r\nbetween brutality and artfulness--one not lacking in elements of humor.\r\nThe authorities, hostile to the Jews, try of course to prevent too many\r\nof them from escaping from the ghetto and from settling in cities which\r\nit is desired to keep as free from Jews as possible. The Jews, however,\r\ntry again and again to evade the prohibitions and the illegally\r\ninterpreted ordinances and to settle where there is a possibility of a\r\nmeans of livelihood. Such cities are, for example, St. Petersburg and\r\nMoscow. The martyrdom which Jews and Jewesses undergo in order to gain\r\nthe right to stay in these cities borders on the tragic. A non-resident\r\nJewess is not allowed to study in these places, but may live there as a\r\nprostitute. An innocent young girl wished to have herself registered as\r\na prostitute, so that she might attend the university, never suspecting\r\nwhat formalities she would have to undergo in consequence. In course of\r\nthe medical examination, however, the circumstances of the case were\r\nimmediately discovered, and the young girl was punished for the\r\nattempted deception and sent away.\r\n\r\nA well-known Orientalist, a man of seventy years, had business to\r\nexecute in Moscow which he did not succeed in finishing before night. No\r\nhotel would have taken him in; and he could not endanger any of his\r\nfriends, for if in the frequent nocturnal rangings of the police in\r\nJewish dwellings a Jewish guest without a passport should be taken, the\r\nhost would lose his right of residence. In his difficulty the old man\r\nasked a railroad official how he could pass the icy-cold night. The man\r\ngave him the good advice that he should seek out the only place where a\r\nman is permitted to take a room and spend the night without a\r\npassport--a brothel. Accordingly, this man of seventy, in order not to\r\nfreeze, was obliged to pass the night in a room with a drunken\r\nprostitute, and sat until morning in a chair, praying. The man who\r\nrelated these facts to me was a Russian author widely known and honored.\r\n\r\nA Jew who for five years has paid the taxes of the first guild in a\r\nmunicipality of the pale receives permission to leave the pale and\r\nsettle elsewhere. He must, however, gain permission for each member of\r\nhis family through the strictest formalities. Woe to him if a child has\r\nbeen born to him during that time! It cannot qualify, and it may easily\r\nhappen that the father must return to the pale. A Jewish merchant of the\r\nfirst guild in Moscow tried to obtain permission to send such a child to\r\nschool. Admission was refused, because he did not possess the necessary\r\npapers. The father appealed to the senate in St. Petersburg, and asked\r\nfor provisional permission for attendance of his child at school until\r\nthe passing of a judgment in that place. The minister of justice,\r\nMuraviev, however, entered a protest against this. Therefore the father\r\nwas obliged either to employ private tutors or to let the child grow up\r\nwithout instruction.\r\n\r\nWhoever works as assistant to a dentist, and has obtained a certificate,\r\nmay open an office for himself. The only requirement for this is that it\r\nshall be well fitted up and that nobody shall sleep in it. This\r\nfacilitation is granted because of the fact that in Russia there is a\r\ngreat lack of dentists. Yet a Jewish dentist went to a lawyer and\r\ncomplained that he had fitted up his office and had handed in to the\r\npolice his request for leave to practise. The police waited three\r\nmonths, then came and explained that, since he had not practised his\r\nprofession for three months, he must immediately leave Moscow. He was\r\nobliged to leave his house immediately, and wander about all night,\r\nbecause he could nowhere find lodging.\r\n\r\nAnother Jewish dentist, a woman, wished to take her examination. A\r\ncertificate was demanded testifying to her political blamelessness. When\r\nshe tried to obtain this it was refused her, since she had no right of\r\nresidence there, and therefore could not demand a certificate!\r\n\r\nThe Jews meet these tricks of the authorities with tricks of their own.\r\nThey pay for a dentist's certificate, fit up an office, and then go into\r\ntrade in bed-feathers or calico. The police official who wishes to prove\r\nwhether the dentist's profession is really practised has some ruble\r\nnotes slipped into his hand. Very recently the Jews have found a means\r\nto become known as Christians without baptism, which they shun.\r\nGood-natured priests, who receive nothing at all for a baptism but a\r\nlarge price for a written declaration that X. Y. is an orthodox\r\nChristian, draw up such declarations. The unbaptized Hebrew comes as an\r\northodox Christian to Great Russia and carries on business, while the\r\nhelpful priest receives a little income from him.\r\n\r\nIn general, the Jew must be able to pay; in that case life is not hard\r\nfor him in Russia, where, as I have said, no anti-Semitic feeling\r\nwhatever exists among the people, and the national characteristics of\r\ngood-nature, of heartiness, helpfulness, and politeness make life easy\r\nand pleasant. But woe to the poor wretch who cannot pay at every step!\r\nWoe to the struggler who wishes to better his lot! Woe to the lover of\r\njustice who dares to fight for his rights or even for the public\r\nwelfare! One of the special laws for the Jews is that any one may\r\ntrample him and injure him unpunished. Of all the unfortunate subjects\r\nof the Czar, he is the most unfortunate. His intelligence, his sense of\r\njustice are offences against the sacred order of things, which demands\r\nstupidity and obedience. Thus exists the entirely incomprehensible\r\ncondition that a great realm steers towards inevitable economic ruin for\r\nlack of economic intelligence, while it possesses five million born\r\nfinanciers, who in the lifetime of a man could change Russia into an\r\neconomic world-power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA visit to Russia offers opportunity for an extremely interesting study.\r\nOne may become acquainted with a rapid succession of towns where the\r\npopulation is almost entirely Jewish, or half Jewish, or to a large\r\nextent Jewish, and also with others in which residence is practically\r\nprohibited to Jews, which, therefore, to speak in anti-Semitic jargon,\r\nare almost \"clean of Jews.\" In western Europe there is neither the one\r\nnor the other. It would be strange, indeed, if such ethnologically\r\nunique conditions offered to the observant spectator no disclosures\r\nwhich he seeks elsewhere in vain. In fact, I made in the cities free of\r\nJews an observation which seems to me well worth imparting. The Jewish\r\nproblem is nothing but a problem of relative overpopulation. The Jews\r\nare unendurable only where they are forced to compete with each other.\r\n\r\nI made this observation in the following way: The Jewish proletarians of\r\nPoland impressed me as extremely repulsive. Their laziness, their filth,\r\ntheir craftiness, their perpetual readiness to cheat cannot help but\r\nfill the western European with very painful feelings and unedifying\r\nthoughts, in spite of all the teachings of history and all desire to be\r\njust. The evil wish arises that in some painless way the world might be\r\nrid of these disagreeable objects, or the equally inhuman thought that\r\nit would really be no great pity if this part of the Polish population\r\ndid not exist at all. One is ashamed of such thoughts; nevertheless,\r\nthat does not rid one's mind of them. Either we must renounce our ideas\r\nof cleanliness and honesty or find a great part of the Eastern Hebrews\r\naltogether unpleasant. Since the former is impossible, the latter will\r\nalways be the case. Comparison with the still dirtier, still more\r\nimmoral, still more neglected Polish proletariat does not drive away\r\nthese thoughts. The Jew has, besides his filth and his craftiness in\r\nbusiness, something else which calls to mind a nobility of civilization,\r\nso that he cannot be confused with any chance \"lazzarone\" or vagabond.\r\nHe is not himself, but the caricature of a man of culture, and as such\r\nhe produces an irritating effect.\r\n\r\nIn the cities free of Jews all this suddenly disappears. The Jews whom\r\none has opportunity to meet there, well educated merchants of the first\r\nguild, incorporated artisans, and descendants of the Jewish soldiers of\r\nNicholas I., are of quite another caliber from their Polish brothers.\r\nThey are in no way to be distinguished from the Russians. One is\r\ncontinually prone to take the bearded Russian driver or merchant for a\r\nJew and the intelligently keen Jew for a European. Then one learns that\r\nthese Jewish lawyers, physicians, merchants, and artisans are treated by\r\nthe Russians themselves as their equals in every respect; indeed, that\r\nthe Jews enjoy a certain priority as being relatively more honest in\r\ntheir dealings. On the contrary, the Russians, when large numbers of\r\nthem follow a single calling, as, say, in the great mercantile houses or\r\nthe ranks of trade, show all the qualities which, to our Western minds,\r\nare stamped as specifically Jewish. They are outrageously obtrusive, and\r\nunreliable to the point of open deception. The German Hanse towns\r\nstrictly forbade their merchants to give Russian Jews goods on credit,\r\nto lend them money, or to borrow from them, under penalty of immediate\r\npunishment.[1] In making the smallest purchase one finds that there is\r\nno question of a mercantile reality; that there is no fixed price, no\r\nkeeping one's word, nothing that to us in the West has long seemed a\r\nmatter of course. Just as in the Orient the Spanish Jews seem much more\r\nreliable and sterling than the rascally Greeks and Armenians, the Jews,\r\nwhen thinly scattered, gain by comparison with the native Russians. Now\r\nthe Russian Jew is no Spaniard, with a proud Western past. He is\r\naltogether identical with the Polish Jew. His higher development cannot\r\nbe accounted for by any ethnological difference. It is simply that under\r\nquite different economic conditions of existence he has become a quite\r\ndifferent person. Dr. Polyakoff, of Moscow, is, in fact, another man\r\nfrom, say, his grandfather, Pollak, of Poland.\r\n\r\nWith these facts we now approach the real problem. The overcrowding of a\r\ncalling engenders a competition in squalor among Christians as well as\r\nJews, Aryans as well as Semites. The Jews, however, live in overcrowded\r\ncallings all over the world, obeying historic laws of adaptation even\r\nwhere other callings, not overcrowded, are not closed to them. Hence we\r\nhave the disagreeable phenomenon of the handing over of certain\r\nvocations to the Jews, which means nothing else than the injury of these\r\ncallings by the trickery of the competition of squalor. Where no fetters\r\nare placed on the economic life, the healthy organism, in time,\r\novercomes these local inflammations, as we may designate, by an\r\nexpression taken from pathology, the influx of an abnormal number of\r\ncells of a certain sort to a place not intended for them. The crowding\r\nof the callings until self-support is impossible, the sinking of\r\nendurance in the overcrowded vocation, lead to a flowing off of the\r\nsuperfluous elements, and finally the whole organism has overcome the\r\ncrisis of assimilation by forcing each particle where it is economically\r\nmost valuable. In Germany the adjustment cannot be far away. The fact\r\nof the unheard-of economic growth during the past fifteen years, and the\r\nunusual increase of prosperity in all branches, show at least that\r\nGermany in its bare fifty years of Jewish emancipation has been in no\r\nway injured economically.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, also, the most expedient thing would evidently be simply to\r\ndeclare the removal of all restrictive laws, and to open to the Jews the\r\ninterior of the country, as well as all occupations which they might\r\nwish to enter. The blessing to Russia would be immense, for the Jews, as\r\nthinking men and members of a race of ancient civilization, would bring\r\nto the Russian nation just what it lacks, an intelligent middle class\r\ncapable of culture. The percentage of Jews would not be at all too high\r\nfor Russia to carry without danger to the national character of society.\r\nTo about one hundred and thirty million Russians there are about five\r\nmillion Jews--that is, barely four per cent. The \"Jew-free\" cities of\r\nMoscow and St. Petersburg show approximately this proportion, without\r\nthe Jews being perceptible there. (It must be admitted that one of the\r\ncomforts of these cities is that they are not, like Warsaw, for\r\ninstance, overwhelmed with greasy, caftaned Jews.) If it could be\r\nbrought about, therefore, that the Jews could be scattered throughout\r\nthe whole kingdom in the ratio of four per cent., it would be an\r\nincalculable gain for all parties, and mankind would be rid of a problem\r\nwhich threatens the condition of our ethics and humanity the more the\r\nlonger it exists.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is not to be thought of as an immediate possibility.\r\nThe Russian government is not in the least gifted with magnanimity and\r\nfarsighted patience, though the contrary is true of the Russian people,\r\nwho are entirely free from anti-Semitic prejudice. For this reason any\r\nenlargement of Jewish rights of residence and vocation is prevented by\r\nthe pointing out of the infection which would then threaten all cities\r\nand all lucrative occupations. The Jewish question will long remain\r\nunsolved, for whom could the Russian officials bleed if not the\r\ntormented, worried, defenceless Jews?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] _Book of Documents of Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland_, Reval,\r\n1852-64, Nos. 576-588, and _Documentary Business of the Origin of the\r\nGerman Hanse_, Hamburg, 1830, ii., No. ix., p. 27; both cited in Lanin\r\n_Russian Characteristics_, German edition, i., 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nPLEHVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1881 there took place in Cracow one of those great\r\nsocialistic trials with which in those days it was hoped in Austria to\r\nsmother the socialistic movements which were imported by unscrupulous\r\nagitators. The trial is known in the annals of social-democracy as the\r\nproceedings against Warnynski and his accomplices. Thirty-five men were\r\nindicted, among them twenty Russians from Volhynia, mostly students of\r\nthe Polytechnic Institute in St. Petersburg, who had been arrested in\r\nthe work of agitation in Galicia. The prisoners noticed during the\r\nproceedings that they were conducted one at a time, under one pretext or\r\nanother, out through a special door of the courtroom, and they could\r\ndiscover no explanation of this queer course of action. Finally, one of\r\nthem, in passing through the door, found the reason. It was a double\r\ndoor provided with a deep niche. In this niche was a Russian functionary\r\nacting as a voluntary menial to the Austrian police, and at the same\r\ntime as a spy in the Russian service, who took this opportunity of\r\ntaking cognizance of his own people among those who were led by. Of\r\ncourse the matter was not closed without the gravest insults to those\r\ncaught, who could only be protected against further abuse by the court\r\nconstabulary. And this police devotee, who showed such zeal in putting\r\ndown international revolution, was no one else than the present\r\nall-powerful figure in Russia, his excellency the minister of the\r\ninterior, M. von Plehve, at that time states-attorney in Warsaw. With\r\nthis bit of sleuthing, which the Poles very well remember to this day,\r\nthis fortune-favored statesman made his début in the world outside of\r\nRussia. He has remained true to his character. He is to-day, at the head\r\nof the greatest state in the world, nothing else but the greatest police\r\nspy in the world. His politics are stamped with all the characteristics\r\nof a police origin, police in the Machiavellian sense--_i. e._, crime in\r\nthe service of order. In all Russia I spoke to no one who would have\r\nchosen for the description of Plehve's character any other expressions\r\nthan those which serve for the delineation of the lowest level of moral\r\nexistence. I shall here try to make a sketch of Plehve in accordance\r\nwith the statements about him which were made to me with perfectly\r\nastonishing unanimity.\r\n\r\nJustice must be done even the basest. It should be mentioned at the\r\noutset that in a land of universal venality the reputation of Plehve had\r\nthis considerable advantage, he was said to be absolutely unbribable.\r\nThat is a great deal, a very great deal, when one considers that in\r\nRussia certain legislative acts are quite openly traceable to the\r\npayment of this or that high functionary. Suspicion, which as a rule\r\ndoes not even spare princes, never once tainted him. But little account\r\ndo the Russians take of this characteristic. Probably they would prefer\r\nit if his other evil traits were a bit softened by the vice of venality.\r\nFor Plehve passes for something far worse than a spendthrift or a\r\nwasteling. He is a rascal without scruples, a political Sadist, a\r\nbloodhound, an accomplished deceiver; at the same time, a cynic entirely\r\nwithout heart, a \"va banque,\"[2] a swindler to whom a political career\r\nor the playing with human lives means nothing more than a pleasant nerve\r\nstimulant--in short, a tiger clothed in a human form. At the same time,\r\nhe has the most charming manners, is delightful and entertaining, and\r\npossesses the most true-hearted face possible. His unbelievable\r\nfalseness is the next thing about which all complain who have had doings\r\nwith him. \"Every word that he speaks is a lie,\" is the assertion which\r\none oftenest hears about him. The criminal element in his tactics\r\nconsists not only in the fact that he persuades the Czar that revolution\r\nis at hand, and keeps him in continual, nerve-killing anxiety by means\r\nof threatening letters, proclamations, and so forth, which he causes to\r\nbe smuggled into the Emperor's pockets, but still more in the fact that\r\nhe actually provokes disorders, in order to be able to use them as\r\narguments and to strengthen his position, and in the further fact that\r\nhe is continually discovering conspiracies and handling the supposed\r\nmembers in the most fearful way in order to prove his indispensability.\r\nThe whole store of police tricks which have been played on despots in\r\norder to turn autocrats into willing tools of their Prætorians has been\r\npillaged by Plehve in order to bring his system to a state of\r\nperfection. In particular the Jews and the Poles must suffer in order to\r\ncontribute to the danger of the situation--_i. e._, the indispensability\r\nof Plehve. Not a soul in Russia doubts that the Kishinef massacres were\r\nthe direct result of his commands; the cynicism with which he rewarded\r\nKrushevan, the leading agitator from Bessarabia, with which he took\r\nunder his protection the agitator Pronin, who had been insulted by a\r\ncongress of teachers, is a shameless acknowledgment of his deed, which,\r\nto say more, he only repudiates before foreign countries, not, however,\r\nbefore his confidants. He seizes upon every little thing in order to\r\nmake some big affair out of it. In Warsaw the widows of the members of a\r\ncommittee which had collected money for a Polish hospital corps were\r\nstoned by students. Immediately was sent the telegraphic order to\r\ninvestigate the thing most thoroughly, and if those who were the\r\nsufferers had not refused all assistance to the police another couple of\r\ndozen would-be rioters would have been sent to Siberia, in order that\r\nthe existence of a Polish revolution might be proved. A Russian editor,\r\nwhose paper had been suppressed because of the publication of a\r\nrevolutionary poem, sought audience of the head of the censorship at the\r\nministry of the interior, in order to obtain permission for the\r\nreappearance of the paper. The chief of the department explained to the\r\neditor, according to a Russian nobleman, that if he should simply\r\ndeclare to the minister that the revolutionary poem had been smuggled\r\ninto the paper by Jews, he would immediately obtain permission to\r\npublish his paper again! From a source whence I never should have\r\nexpected such a statement, from a highly conservative aristocrat, an\r\n\"excellency\" in the service of the state, I received in all seriousness\r\nthe information that only Plehve, in league with Alexeyev, had conjured\r\nup the war by holding off the Japanese, simply because in this way he\r\nwould become so much the more indispensable. Nay, more, it was even\r\nindicated to me that the nihilists, who killed Alexander II. at the very\r\nmoment when the proclamation of a constitution lay upon the table\r\nawaiting his signature, could not have found their way to the imperial\r\ncarriage without help from the police. And the ally of Loris-Melikov,\r\nthe man who had drawn up the plan, and who best of all knew how near its\r\nsignature, which must be avoided, the proclamation was, was none other\r\nthan Plehve! His instinct drove him to the ranks of the reactionaries,\r\nfor there is little use for people of his caliber in a constitutional\r\nstate. His anti-Semitic tendencies, which he naturally disavows to every\r\nJewish visitor, are only assumed because people high in position and\r\ninfluence, like the empress dowager, Prince Sergius, and others of the\r\ngeneration of Alexander III., are fanatically anti-Semitic. So even this\r\nis not genuine in him. Nothing is but his theatrical ambition to assert\r\nhimself as long as possible, and to have the nerve-tickling of a\r\ntight-rope walker who balances on his wire rope over fixed bayonets.\r\n\r\nThat is the picture of the minister of the interior as public opinion in\r\nRussia paints it. I must confess that the picture is as little to my\r\ntaste as is the man. While the great Russian novelists are, above all,\r\nmasters in the use of shades, political public opinion likes to work\r\nwith the strongest colors, with bloody superlatives. Suspicious as the\r\ncircumstances may be that not a soul in the broad Russian empire is\r\ninclined to say a friendly word for the ruling power of the time, yet\r\nthe unprejudiced observer must reckon with the circumstance that even\r\nwithout a free press in Russia there is a certain uniformity of\r\npolitical opinion which can only be explained on the hypothesis of a\r\ncertain uniform centre of opinion, many of whose statements are taken on\r\nfaith by every one. I imagine that this centre is situated pretty high,\r\nperhaps in the immediate neighborhood of the Czar, and that the picture\r\nof each minister is sketched by his rivals, but, like every article for\r\nthe masses, only in poster style, in striking words, very white or,\r\noftener, very black. He, not a Russian and not a rival, who has not the\r\nsame burning interest in getting rid of Plehve, will therefore do well\r\nto transpose this rascal from his supernatural atmosphere into an\r\nevery-day one, and a somewhat different picture will result.\r\n\r\nI think of it in this light: Plehve comes from a states-attorney and a\r\npolice career. Some traces of this origin cleave to every one of like\r\ntraining. Judges who have been states-attorney are the terror of\r\nlawyers, because of their inquisitorial manner, and because of their\r\ninclination to see in every defendant a person already condemned.\r\nFurthermore, dealings with police agents are least of all fitted to\r\ncultivate scrupulousness. Let only Puttkammer's words be recalled,\r\n\"Gentlemen do not volunteer for such services.\"[3] The continual fear of\r\nassassination, which is well founded in the case of the head of the\r\nRussian police--Plehve allows his expenditures for the guarding of his\r\nperson to amount as high as eight hundred thousand rubles a year--does\r\nnot conduce to making a man human; and, finally, all bearers of honors\r\nin Russia are cynics, because their existence is founded only on the\r\nmood of a single person, and their whole career is a game of hazard. In\r\nthe case of Plehve and others there is this additional evil influence,\r\nthat not being Russians--Plehve is a Pole, of Lettish-Jewish\r\norigin--they must distinguish themselves by special Russian Chauvinism\r\nin order to avoid suspicion. Plehve is not a great man, his whole\r\nministerial career being devoid of a single noteworthy act. He is a\r\nsuccessful official, who intends by every means to make himself felt in\r\nhigh circles, and who considers himself justified in countering the\r\nintriguing of his rivals by any or all the means customary in the land,\r\nand \"Voilà tout.\" But, in general, love of truth is not a characteristic\r\nof so-called public life in Russia. Hence it would be unjust to count as\r\na special crime Plehve's special falseness.\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded that even this picture is far from being a pleasing\r\none. If to these features the proved fact is added that Plehve denounced\r\nto the governor-general, Count Muraviev, his own Polish foster-parents,\r\nwho picked him up, so to speak, in the very street and raised him\r\n(Plehve was originally a Catholic), so that they were sent to Siberia in\r\nreturn for their kindness; that Plehve, therefore, began his career with\r\na deed of infamous ingratitude and treachery,[4] then the black will be\r\nblack enough to allow of passing over the remaining smirches in the\r\npicture of a monster.\r\n\r\nBut the most pitiful of all that I heard about Plehve's régime was the\r\nanswer I received when I asked a man in a very responsible position\r\nwhether better things might be expected when Plehve should be overtaken\r\nby his inevitable fate.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the answer was; \"deserved as such a fate will be, for us it will\r\nbring no help. Another man, that is all. Plehve is only the ideal\r\nrequired by the régime. A police state needs police natures, and always\r\nfinds them. He has all the vices save that of corruptibility, but is by\r\nno means unique in the hierarchy of Russian officials. And it is far\r\nfrom probable that anything better would succeed him. If all Russia\r\nhopes [_sic_] that he will soon be annihilated, it is not because an\r\namelioration of things is hoped for, but because some satisfaction is\r\nfelt when one of these beasts meets his due. But a philanthropist and a\r\nfriend of justice will be just as unlikely to be minister of the\r\ninterior under an absolutism as he is to desire to be an executioner.\r\nOnly another system can bring us other men. A reign of terror tolerates\r\nonly hangmen.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] One who risks everything on one card.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Gentlemen geben sich für diese Dienste nicht her.\"\r\n\r\n[4] See Struve's _Oswobozhdenie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps not altogether accidental that one evening at a social\r\ngathering I was introduced to one of the foremost lawyers of St.\r\nPetersburg, whose biting sarcasm in discussing the events of the day\r\nimmediately struck me, and aroused in me the desire to have a more\r\nserious talk with him. This was immediately granted with that amiability\r\nwhich is never wanting in the intercourse of Russians with foreigners.\r\nSubsequently I learned that I might congratulate myself, for that\r\nparticular lawyer was said to be not only one of the keenest minds in\r\nRussia, but one of the men best acquainted with his country. Moreover,\r\nhe was so overwhelmed with work that even greater men were often obliged\r\nto wait by the hour in his antechamber before they were able to gain\r\nadmission. Indeed, the time fixed for our interview, near midnight,\r\nshowed this to be the case. The conversation lasted until long after\r\nthat hour, but I had no cause to regret the loss of several hours of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nMy host rose immediately and gave the inevitable order to bring tea and\r\ncigarettes. In a few minutes we were discussing the question which\r\ninterested me most, as being the key to an understanding of all the\r\nother economic conditions of the country--namely, the question of the\r\nadministration of justice in Russia.\r\n\r\n\"One circumstance makes it uncommonly difficult here to obtain justice,\"\r\nbegan the lawyer. \"I refer to the strained relations between the bench\r\nand the bar. Here the judge is more hostile to counsel than is the case\r\nin other countries, and often enough he is inclined to make them feel\r\nhis power. This is less serious in civil suits--in which the judge,\r\nafter all, merely has to do with the parties in the case--than in\r\ncriminal cases, in which the judge represents the authority of the realm\r\ntowards the accused and his advocate. In such cases the defendant may\r\neasily pay the penalty of the animosity which the judge feels towards\r\nhis counsel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the cause of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has only too human a cause. It is not unheard of for a busy lawyer\r\nof reputation and good connections to earn thirty or forty thousand\r\nrubles a year, or more. Compare with that the wretched salaries of the\r\njudges; consider how costly living is here; imagine the continuous\r\nover-burden of work of the bench and the lack of public appreciation,\r\nand you will comprehend why our judges do not look at the world in\r\ngeneral through rose-colored glasses, and particularly at the\r\nprosperous, well-situated lawyer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say lack of public appreciation. Is the position of judge not an\r\nhonorable one?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, no official in Russia is much respected. At the most he\r\nis feared. The most lucrative positions, however, are those of the\r\nadministrative department and the police. In these branches are to be\r\nfound the most rapid and brilliant careers, and therefore the sons of\r\ngreat families, in so far as they become officials, prefer them. The\r\njudge must work hard, and has small thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does not this evil have a moral effect on the impartial administration\r\nof justice also?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, in plain speech, are not our judges to be bought? Well, I\r\nmust say, to the honor of these functionaries, that relatively speaking\r\nthey constitute the most honorable class of all our officials, and that\r\nthe majority of them are superior to bribery. To be frank, there is\r\nprofessional ambition enough; and the effort to please superiors is\r\nalmost a matter of course, since the independence of the judges, which\r\nhad brought us extraordinary improvement in the candidates for the\r\noffice, has been set aside again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your judges are not, then, independent and irremovable?\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you thinking of--under our present régime? We do not wish\r\nindependent judges. A minister of justice like Muraviev, who certainly\r\nconstitutes the supreme type of all that is meant by the expression, 'A\r\nman of no honor,' is the strongest hinderance to justice. Therefore, a\r\nmonetary acknowledgment to the whole senate is expected for each\r\nsatisfactory judgment. We have such a case just now. Here you have a\r\nlist of names of seven judges who were promoted out of turn by Minister\r\nMuraviev on consideration of the kind support which they gave to the\r\nRyaboushinskys, the Moscow millionaires, against the Bank of Kharkov,\r\nwhich was their debtor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you permit me to make a note of this list?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I am not the only man who has it.\"\r\n\r\nI noted down the names Davidov, Sokalski, Vishnevsky, Laiming, Delyanov,\r\nDublyavski, Podgurski. They were entered on a type-written sheet with\r\nthe distinction and encouragement they had respectively received after a\r\nsuit which brought a considerable profit to a Moscow millionaire firm.\r\n\r\n\"But you said,\" I objected, \"that the judges are not open to bribery.\r\nYet they performed an illegitimate service to millionaires.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I said the judges are not open to bribery; but I did not say\r\nthat of the minister of justice. On the contrary, I called him a man\r\nwithout honor in a place of the highest power.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, then, that he was paid for the judgment that was given in the\r\ninterest of the millionaires?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your astonishment only betrays the foreigner. Only the little debts of\r\nthe honorable minister were paid off--good Heavens!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is incomprehensible.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the judge has everything to fear when he is not\r\ncompliant. Do you suppose that a comedy of justice like that of Kishinef\r\ncan be played with independent judges? And yet there are always heroes\r\nto be found who fear no measures, but administer justice according to\r\ntheir convictions. That is the astonishing thing, not the opposite,\r\nunder a Muraviev-Plehve régime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it better, then, formerly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was, and would have become better still if our authorities had\r\nremained true to their mission of uplifting the altogether immoral\r\npeople instead of corrupting them still further. In the system of\r\nPobydonostzev, in which politics take the place of morality, no\r\nimprovement is to be expected. You might as well expect fair play from\r\nthe Spaniards of the Inquisition as here, where premiums are set upon\r\nall sorts of unwise actions, if only they seem to lead to the levelling\r\nof the masses, who are to be kept unthinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say the people are immoral?\"\r\n\r\n\"They lack--above all things, the sense of justice. No one here has\r\nrights. No one thinks he has. The natural state of things is that\r\neverything is forbidden. A privilege is a favor to which no one has any\r\nclaim. To win a lawsuit is a matter of luck, not the result of a\r\ndefinite state of justice. One has no right to gain his cause simply\r\nbecause he is in the right. As a consequence of this, it is neither\r\ndiscreditable nor disgraceful to be in the wrong. You win or lose\r\naccording as the die falls. I will illustrate from your own experience.\r\nYou were to-day in the Hermitage. At a certain door, before which stood\r\na servant, you asked whether people were permitted to enter. The answer\r\nwas not 'yes' or 'no,' but 'Admittance is commanded,' or 'Admittance is\r\nnot commanded.' This spirit extends to the smallest things. That you\r\nkeep your child with you and bring it up is not a matter of course, but\r\nyou are permitted to have children and to bring them up--the latter, be\r\nit noted, only in so far as the police allow. If you should to-day\r\nsuffer heavy loss by robbery or burglary, what should you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should report the matter, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say of course, because it is a matter of course to you that a crime\r\nreported should become characterized as a crime, because in a certain\r\nway you feel the duty of personally upholding law and order. When the\r\nsame thing happens to me, a Russian, I must first conquer my natural\r\ntendency, and then after a long struggle I, too, will report the matter,\r\nbecause--well, because I, as a lawyer and a representative of justice,\r\nam no longer a naïve Russian, but am infused with the usual ideas of\r\njustice. The normal Russian exceedingly seldom reports a case to the\r\npolice, because he absolutely lacks the conviction of the necessity of\r\njustice. When he says of anybody that he is a clever rascal, his\r\nemphasis is laid on the word clever, which expresses unlimited\r\nappreciation.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must make general intercourse exceedingly difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. To live in Russia means to use a thousand arts in keeping\r\none's head above water. One never has a sure ground of law under his\r\nfeet. Property both public and private is perhaps not less safe in\r\nTurkey than here. Have you heard of the great steel affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no wonder, for we do not make much ado about a little mischance\r\nof this sort. In that affair a capital of eight million rubles\r\ndisappeared without a trace. It was invested in the coal and steel\r\nworks. A grand-duke, moreover, was interested in the enterprise,\r\nGrand-Duke Peter Nikolaievitch. A license to mine iron ore on a certain\r\nterritory for ninety-nine years had been obtained. A company was formed\r\nwith a capital of ten million rubles. The grand-duke took shares to the\r\namount of a million rubles. The enormously rich Chludoff put eight\r\nmillion rubles into the concern. French and Belgian experts were brought\r\non special steamers; champagne flowed in streams. Of course the reports\r\nof the experts were glowing ones. But after three years there was of the\r\neight million rubles, barely paid in, not a kopek more to be found. It\r\nhad all been stolen. Likewise there was no ore or coal on the territory,\r\nnor had there ever been. No one went to law about the affair, so little\r\nsensation did it cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did this affair take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Between 1898 and 1901.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can your press do nothing to better this general corruption?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have a saying, 'It is hard to dig with a broken shovel.' Talented\r\npeople like ourselves soon learned from abroad the little art of\r\ncorrupting the press. With a fettered press like ours, this is less\r\ndifficult here than in other countries, where a paper respecting public\r\nopinion might under some circumstances be unreservedly outspoken. But\r\nwhy should a press with Suvorin and the _Novoye Vremya_ at the head,\r\nsurpassing absolutely all records of baseness--why should such a press\r\nrun the risk of bankruptcy? Moreover, you must always keep one thing in\r\nmind: a press may exert tremendous power by publishing a man's\r\nworthlessness, until he is made powerless in society; but since here\r\nnotorious sharpers are readily accepted in the highest ranks of society,\r\nand even grand-dukes do not escape the suspicion of corruption, it does\r\nno one any harm to be reported as having dexterously spirited away a few\r\nhundred thousands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say even grand-dukes?\"\r\n\r\n\"--Are not safe from suspicion. I can personally testify that not one of\r\nthem takes a ruble himself. But the persons who live by obtaining\r\nconcessions for joint-stock companies, etc., know how to represent that\r\nthey need considerable sums for the purpose of influencing the highest\r\npersons, the minister and grand-dukes. Hence arises this idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"And intelligent business men believe that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe it? No one would understand the opposite. Imagine a scene in my\r\noffice. A business man comes to me with a case. He inquires my fee. I\r\nsay five hundred rubles. He asks what will be the expenses. I say a few\r\nrubles for stamp duties, etc. Then he becomes more definite. He means\r\nthe _charges_. 'There are none,' I answer. The man of business rises,\r\ndisappointed. 'Ah! so you have no influential connections?' I will not\r\nsay that this happens very often with me; for the men who come to me\r\nonce know what I can do, and what not, and what my practice is. The case\r\nis, however, characteristic. Outside the legal profession, which still\r\nlives on the tradition of the time of its independence, every one is\r\nopen to bribery; and every one reckons with the fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no one is angry at open injustice?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is injustice? Despotism of the great. We have been used to that\r\nfor thousands of years and accept it like the caprices of fortune. The\r\npeasant makes no distinction between a hail-storm which ruins his crop\r\nand an authority who oppresses or injures him. There is no way of\r\nresisting either; for when one curses God, He sends greater misfortune;\r\nand when one disputes with the authorities, one is absolutely lost.\r\n'Duck, little brother; everything passes'; that is the final conclusion\r\nof our wisdom. We are educated to it by inhuman despots and by an\r\nofficial service of thieves and debauchees. We lack, too, the sharply\r\ndefined idea of ownership, in which the sense of justice, considered\r\npsychologically, has its root. You know that here the peasants own their\r\nown land only to an extremely small extent. The individual is merged and\r\nlost in the 'mir' (village community), where the trustee, the 'zemski\r\nnachnalnik,'[5] the village elder, and liquor rule. This _obshtchina_,\r\ncommunism, is the strongest fortress of reaction. No ray of\r\nenlightenment penetrates it. At the utmost, misery and ever-returning\r\nhunger produce finally a condition of despair in which the peasant is\r\ncapable of anything except an action which might advance him in\r\ncivilization. In the census of 1898 there were found villages where no\r\none had any idea what paper is, and peasants who did not know the name\r\nof the Emperor. The 'mir,' moreover, is in its nature opposed to private\r\nownership, and every discussion between the member of the village\r\ncommunism and the property-holder is artfully prevented by the\r\nscattering about of compulsory peasants. For property-owners are at\r\npresent for the most part Liberal. The régime, however, stands or falls\r\nwith the isolation of the peasantry from Liberal influences. For the\r\npeasant is not unintelligent by nature, and, if he is not prevented, he\r\nlearns very quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is also, then, one of the causes of the ill-treatment of the\r\nJews?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is _the_ cause. Do not suppose that the Holy Synod alone has power\r\nto influence legislation in favor of orthodoxy. Sectarians and Jews are\r\ndemonstrably the only people who have a moral code of their own, and,\r\ntherefore, know how to distinguish justice from injustice. They are also\r\nthe only ones who criticise the actions of the authorities. They were,\r\ntherefore, a dangerous leaven in the community, otherwise slipping off\r\nto sleep in a body. Therefore, it was a matter of self-preservation for\r\nthe autocracy to isolate the Jews and make them harmless. Do not suppose\r\nthat any anti-Semitic feeling is prevalent among us. The autocrats are\r\ntrying artfully to implant it by means of such people as Plehve's\r\nintimate, Krushevan, of the 'Bessarabetz.' But the effect does not go\r\ndeep, thanks to the same circumstance which makes the progress of\r\ncivilization difficult; the peasant cannot read, and does not in the\r\nleast believe the priest. The massacres of Kishinef were directly\r\ncommanded. Every man was killed by order of the Czar. No anti-Semitism\r\nexists among the people. Whatever anti-Semitism there is is sown by the\r\ngovernment for the purpose of isolating the peasants in order that 'the\r\nurchins may grow up stupid.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ought not the Jews to take that into account and not meddle with\r\npolitics?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I see no reason why the Jews should become\r\naccomplices of this formidable and soul-killing régime of ours. They\r\nwill be oppressed all the same, whether meek or unruly. They will remain\r\nunder special legislation, simply because no one can stop the flow of\r\nthe official's unfailing spring of revenue--the ravaging of the Jews.\r\nMoreover, the Jews have never received so much sympathy from us as since\r\nthey began to place themselves on the defensive and to make common cause\r\nwith our Radicals. Now for the first time they belong to us, and yet\r\nreally only those who actually fight with us and for us. This matter,\r\ntoo, is misrepresented. Statistics, which show a percentage of\r\neighty-five Jews in every hundred revolutionaries, are falsified,\r\nbecause gentiles are allowed to slip through in order to injure the\r\nRadical--_i. e._, the constitutional--movement by representing it as\r\nun-Russian and Jewish, and to mobilize foreign anti-Semitism against us.\r\nBut the Jews ought to be grateful to Plehve, for, thanks to his\r\nmachinations, all the intelligent opinion among us has become favorable\r\nto the Jews, and recognizes the solidarity of its interest and those of\r\nthe Jews. The struggle conduces much, however, to the assimilation of\r\nthe Jews. They are our brothers; they suffer with us and for us, even if\r\nalso for themselves; for our whole Jewish legislation for twenty years\r\npast has consisted only in the curtailing of the rights accorded them\r\nunder Alexander II. Why should they not become revolutionaries? But they\r\nare enemies of the administration merely, not of the state; therefore,\r\nwe find ourselves on the same footing.\"\r\n\r\nI closed my interview, as in all cases, with the question, \"What hope is\r\nthere for the future?\" and received the same answer as in all other\r\ncases:\r\n\r\n\"Everything depends upon how this war ends. If God helps us and we lose\r\nthe war, improvement is possible; for then ruin, above all, the chronic\r\nbankruptcy of the nation, can no longer be concealed. If a man should\r\nenter my room now--at this hour only respectable persons enter my\r\nroom--and I should say to him, 'What do you hope and wish in regard to\r\nthe war?' his answer would be, 'Defeat; the only means to save us.' If\r\nwe calculate how many men are shot and exiled and how many families are\r\nruined every year by absolutism, the total equals the losses in war--a\r\nmore terrible one, however, for only a catastrophe can make an end of\r\nthis war, which has long been destroying us. Therefore, I say again, if\r\nGod helps us we shall lose the war in the East. Do not allow yourself to\r\nbe deceived by any official preparations. Every good Russian prays, 'God\r\nhelp us and permit us to be beaten!'\"\r\n\r\nWhen I left the brilliant lawyer it was, as I have said, long after\r\nmidnight. It was \"butter-week,\"[6] and my sleigh had trouble in avoiding\r\nthe drunken men who staggered across our way, and the shrieking hussies,\r\nwho, with their companions with or without uniforms, carried on pastimes\r\nsuitable to the season.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Chief of the county council.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Butter-week\" (maslyanitza) is in Russia the week preceding Lent.\r\nMeat is forbidden, but milk, butter, and eggs are allowed as food. Like\r\nthe carnival, it is celebrated with popular amusements.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL FAMILY AS THE PUBLIC SEES IT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In no constitutional state is the practical influence of the head of\r\nthe government so slight as in the autocracy of Russia,\" was one of the\r\nsayings I heard most often in St. Petersburg, when I endeavored to\r\ninform myself in regard to the personality and the acts of the reigning\r\nCzar. There are, to be sure, individual opinions to the contrary.\r\nAccording to these it depends entirely upon the personality of the\r\nautocrat whether he exerts a strong influence or not. The Conservatives\r\nincline to the latter view. Prince Esper Ukhtomski held it; so did a\r\nformer high functionary in the department of finance, as well as a\r\nconservative aristocrat in another department, all of whom I questioned\r\non this point. One of them said in so many words that the Czar needs\r\nonly to lift a finger to banish all the evil spirits which now rule the\r\nland. The aristocrat believed the country might be delivered by an\r\nemperor better trained for his functions. Prince Ukhtomski ascribes to\r\nthe leading statesmen, at least, influence enough to do good and to\r\nprevent evil, and, therefore, to do the contrary, as has been done for\r\ntwenty years, especially under the régime of Plehve. The Liberals and\r\nRadicals, however, who form the greater part of the so-called\r\n\"Intelligence,\" leave the personality of the ruler entirely out of the\r\nquestion, perhaps from a premature comparison with their constitutional\r\nmodel. They declare a change of conditions without a change of the\r\nsystem to be impossible. To be sure, they say, if a suspicious,\r\ninhumane, reactionary Czar like Alexander III. is on the throne, the\r\ndomination of the camorra of officials is made more oppressive. Yet the\r\npresent mild and benevolent autocrat cannot prevent the existence of\r\nconditions which are more insupportable than ever. Only the press and a\r\nparliament could amend matters, not the good intentions of a single man.\r\n\r\nI do not undertake to judge which of the two parties is right. In any\r\ncase it seems worth while to sketch the Czar's personality, which is\r\ncertainly an element in the fate of Russia and of Europe. The portrait\r\nis drawn from the reports of people who have had sufficient opportunity\r\nto form a conception of him from their personal observation. It is, of\r\ncourse, impossible for me to name my authorities, or to indicate them in\r\nany but the most distant way. It must suffice to say that among them\r\nwere people who have known not only the present rulers, but also their\r\nparents and grandparents, from intimate association. I myself have seen\r\nthe Czar only once. The current portraits of him are very good. The\r\nonly striking and noteworthy thing in the handsome and sympathetic face\r\nis the expression of melancholy resignation. One authority alone--whose\r\nstatements on other matters I have found to be invariably careful and\r\naccurate--expressed doubts of the good-nature of the Czar, and accused\r\nhim of designing and of rather petty malevolence. All others, including\r\nPrince Ukhtomski, who had been the companion of the Czar for years,\r\nagree in emphasizing the extraordinary, almost childlike lovableness and\r\nkindliness of the Emperor, who is said to be actually fascinating in\r\npersonal intercourse. This agrees with the fact, which I know from one\r\nunquestionably trustworthy source, that the Czar is intentionally deaf\r\nto everything in the reports of his counsellors likely to disparage or\r\ncast suspicion upon a colleague, while he immediately listens and asks\r\nfor details when he hears from one of his ministers a word favorable to\r\nthe action of another. It is an absolute necessity for him to do good,\r\nand it is a constant source of fresh pain to him that he cannot prevent\r\nthe great amount of existing evil. Again, while the single authority\r\nsays he has found in the Czar indications of a subtle if not powerful\r\nintellect, the others, while they praise his goodness of heart, do not\r\nconceal the weakness of his judgment, which, according to them,\r\ncertainly has something pathological about it. Prince Ukhtomski alone\r\nspeaks of the Emperor with invariable respect and sympathy, without\r\nlimiting each hearty statement with an immediate \"but.\" All others,\r\nwithout exceptions, explain the Prætorian rule of Plehve by the mental\r\nand moral helplessness of the Emperor, who is entirely uninformed, and\r\nis treated by those about him in the most abominable way--under cover of\r\nall outward signs of devotion. The things that people dare do to him,\r\npresuming upon this helplessness, border upon the inconceivable. That\r\nthreatening letters can constantly be smuggled into the Czar's pockets,\r\nand even into his bed, without his finally hitting upon the idea of\r\nseizing his body-servant by the cravat, is a very strong proof of his\r\nmental inactivity; the more so, incidentally, because he hears himself\r\nridiculed outside his own door. This police canard is told, moreover, of\r\nAlexander III., who was a dreaded despot. The rôle, too, which Plehve\r\nplayed, although the Czar did not esteem him in the least, shows how\r\nsuccessfully the latter has been intimidated and persuaded into the\r\nentirely mistaken belief that Plehve alone could avert the threatening\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Czar is said to be anything but confiding in regard\r\nto his nearest counsellors. When a report is made to him he sits in the\r\nshadow; the man who makes the report sits in the light. He tries to\r\ndecipher the man's expression and to control him, a thing which is, of\r\ncourse, impossible, since a good Russian physiognomy is more\r\nimpenetrable than a Russian iron-clad. His lack of knowledge of affairs\r\nis as marked as his lack of judgment. I will give an instance of this.\r\nIn the provinces a quarrel had broken out between the self-governing\r\ncorporation, the \"zemstvos,\" and the governors. This difference between\r\nself-government and autocracy was presented to the Czar as turning\r\nmerely on the question of centralization or decentralization, and as if\r\nit were a matter for disagreement between the governors and the minister\r\nof the interior, the governors striving against the same full authority\r\nthat is held by the ministers of the Czar. In this way the Czar was\r\nsuccessfully deceived in regard to the nature of the quarrel; he did not\r\nlearn at all that the provinces were making a demonstration against\r\nautocracy. The result of the deception was, of course, that the Czar\r\ndeclared himself for the ministry of the interior--that is, for Plehve,\r\nthe increase of whose power he by no means wished.\r\n\r\nThe rôle which certain adventurers like the hypnotist Philippe and the\r\npromoter Bezobrazov are able to play at court is also certainly a\r\nnotable symptom. The former was to suggest to the Czaritza the birth of\r\na boy, while otherwise he carried through whatever he wished, since he\r\nused the spirit of Alexander III. to secure a hearing for his\r\nsuggestions. His departure from court followed upon his impudently\r\nhaving the spirits recommend a specific firm of contractors for the\r\nbuilding of a bridge. Bezobrazov, one of the agents who have the\r\nAsiatic war on their consciences, is now living somewhere abroad, and\r\ndoes not dare return, at least while the war lasts.\r\n\r\nStill more significant, it seems to me, is the authenticated statement\r\nthat the Emperor has many times received publications upon the condition\r\nof his empire, has carefully read them, and has praised them, without\r\ntaking the slightest step towards carrying out the reforms recommended\r\nto him; indeed, after the lapse of a few days, he has ceased even to\r\nrefer in conversation to the suggestions. This would seem to indicate an\r\nalmost abnormal weakness of will, which makes it easy for a gifted,\r\ninconsiderate, and self-confident reactionary like the Grand-Duke\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch to carry out his own ideas in everything.\r\n\r\nAccording to these statements, which come directly in every case from\r\noriginal sources, the Czar is to be regarded as a man upon the whole\r\ngood-natured and lovable, who is, perhaps, too modest and too conscious\r\nof his insufficient knowledge to have the full courage of\r\nresponsibility, without which an autocrat is the least able of leaders\r\nto endure his great burden. Inconsiderate and crafty people, who profit\r\nby his weakness, govern him, and he may even be glad of this. In his\r\nperplexity and helplessness, which are due to his human sympathy and\r\nmodesty, he is obliged to submit to others with whom he can at least\r\nleave the responsibility for affairs, which in general, as in the\r\nspecific case of the war in eastern Asia, go contrary to his wishes.\r\n\r\nHis timid temperament is shown especially in his relations with his\r\nmother, the dowager empress, who even now, supported by the reactionary\r\nmembers of the family, plays the part of the actual empress, and cruelly\r\nmortifies the young consort of the Czar. It is an open secret that the\r\nrelations between the two women are anything but untroubled, a condition\r\nwhich reacts upon the relations of the imperial pair themselves. The\r\ndowager empress has renounced none of her prerogatives in favor of her\r\ndaughter-in-law, who consequently feels herself in a very false\r\nposition, and complains bitterly of it. People assured me, moreover,\r\nthat according to Russian ideas none of the rights claimed by the young\r\nCzaritza belong to her so long as the empress-mother lives. Hence it\r\nvexes the Czaritza that she cannot curb her so-called ambition. The\r\nempress-mother, however, is not at all popular, at least in Liberal\r\ncircles, where she is held responsible for the fact that her son cannot\r\nfree himself from the evil traditions of his father, who was a strictly\r\nupright, but relentless and brutal despot. The young Czaritza was blamed\r\namong the common people because she had borne no prince in spite of the\r\nprayers of the archbishop John; she is blamed at court also because she\r\ndoes not conceal her English sympathies.\r\n\r\nOne old friend of the imperial family, however, assured me that there\r\nis no more charming, upright, and affectionate woman living than this\r\nyoung Hessian princess. She is, he said, completely intimidated by the\r\nenemies who surround her and shows them a lowering face. Where she feels\r\nherself secure, however, her merry South-German nature comes to the top,\r\nand she can even now romp like a little child. It speaks for the\r\ninnocence of her nature that she is prouder of nothing than of her\r\npotato-salad. For the rest, the same authority asserts, she has a mind\r\nof her own, and may be not always the most comfortable companion for a\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nAmong the other members of the family the Grand-Duke Constantine is\r\ncalled the poet. His interest in art and science is said to be sincere.\r\nHe has also great personal attractiveness. In sharp contrast with him\r\nstands the Grand-Duke Sergius, governor-general of Moscow, and\r\nbrother-in-law and uncle of the Czar. The things commonly reported of\r\nhis private life are unsuitable for repetition here, since in general I\r\navoid giving space to scandal in a chronicle of important matters. The\r\nthings worthy of publicity and important for the weal or woe of\r\npopulation are the opinions and abilities of princes, not their\r\nliaisons. It is difficult, however, not to speak of the passions of the\r\nGrand-Duke Sergius, since they form such a violent contrast to his\r\nformer bigotry. He is unanimously pronounced an unprincipled man with a\r\nblack record--a man whose pleasure consists in the sufferings of\r\nothers. His influence at court is second only to that of the Grand-Duke\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch.\r\n\r\nI found in all Russia no trace of a dynastic sentiment. The loyalty to\r\nthe House of the Hohenzollerns in Prussia, or to the House of the\r\nHapsburgs in Austria has no counterpart in Russia. If the personal\r\ninfluence of the occupants of the throne may be estimated, the Czar\r\nmeans to the masses of the people the essence of temporal and spiritual\r\npower, to the intelligent class an element of fate. The grand-dukes are\r\npeople who can aid and harm, and who are therefore persons of importance\r\nfor all Russians. The bond of loyalty between dynasty and people,\r\nhowever, which in the West has assured the safe existence of the royal\r\nhouses through all revolutionary convulsions, does not exist in Russia.\r\nOn the contrary, people speak freely in private of the \"Saltikov\r\ndynasty,\" in unmistakable allusion to the well-known first lover of the\r\nEmpress Catherine II. Thus the many murders in the imperial house are\r\nreceived by the people without great excitement. Only the inhabitants of\r\nthe Baltic provinces are faithful to the dynasty; the spirit of feudal\r\nloyalty runs in their German blood. Even there, however, it is being\r\nslowly but resolutely destroyed by the ruling anarchists.\r\n\r\nIn contemporary opinion Alexander II. and Alexander III. still live,\r\nwhile Nicholas I. is practically forgotten. Alexander II. is surrounded\r\nwith the martyr's halo, and is thought of only as the emancipating Czar\r\nwho was got out of the way before he could sign the liberty-giving bill\r\nfor a constitution. Public opinion will not be dissuaded from finding\r\nthe fact remarkable that the nihilists succeeded for the first time in\r\nreaching the Czar at the moment when all the privileges of the reigning\r\noligarchy were threatened. Therefore people will not remember any traits\r\nin him except good ones, a thing not altogether consistent with the\r\npicture of him left by Kropotkin in his memoirs. Of Alexander III., on\r\nthe contrary, only evil is heard, which I, however, must doubt for many\r\nreasons. For I have been told little incidents of his most private life,\r\nincidents which I cannot repeat, out of consideration for the incognito\r\nof my informant, but which show a certain knightliness and uprightness,\r\nand a truly princely kindness to the weak. Another man is answerable for\r\nthe pitilessness of his fatal policy--Pobydonostzev, the Torquemada of\r\nRussia. It is, however, inevitable that history should preserve only\r\nthat picture which expresses the sum total of the effect of a\r\npersonality. Therefore the memory of Alexander III. is certainly\r\noverloaded with sins of omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nPUBLIC OPINION AND THE PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fine imperial library in St. Petersburg, which I was permitted\r\nthrough the kindness of our legation to use, possesses a specialty in a\r\nparticular class of works, the collection of so-called \"Russica\"--_i.\r\ne._, everything that has been written in foreign languages about Russia.\r\nPolite attendants, speaking various languages, assist the visitor. One\r\nlearns from them that it is the business of special agents abroad to\r\nreport on publications which relate to Russia, and to send them in. So\r\nit happens that probably nowhere in the world is there such an\r\naccumulation of revolutionary literature as in this imperial collection.\r\nFor patriotic writings are for the most part in Russian, so that they\r\nmay be appreciated and quickly rewarded. The semi-official literature in\r\nforeign languages is not to be compared in quantity or importance with\r\nthat which true patriots are forced to their sorrow to write in foreign\r\nlanguages. I looked through piles of this forbidden literature. The\r\nimpression I received was desperately disheartening. There is nothing\r\nwhich has not been said about Russia. The severest and best-attested\r\nattacks on the régime, on persons, on conditions, stand there quietly,\r\nvolume by volume, in the imperial library, and have had exactly as much\r\neffect as whip-strokes on water. The Russian political writer who wishes\r\nto war upon the present system with the weapon of reckless criticism\r\nmust lose all hope in face of this library. What more can be said than\r\nhas already been said by Milyukov, by Lanin, by Leroy-Beaulieu? The\r\nvoice of the prophets does not penetrate to the ears of the rulers, or,\r\nif it does, it is drowned by the whispers of parasites who know how to\r\nprotect their own interests, or it finds no echo in the too weak or too\r\nhardened hearts of the rulers.\r\n\r\nI had the same sensation when, in the course of my conversations with\r\nleading persons in the service of the state, and with members of the\r\n\"Intelligence,\" I was more and more struck with the fact that in Russia\r\nthere is an unusually strong public opinion, which in its criticisms far\r\ntranscends anything that can be said in foreign papers about Russian\r\nconditions, and that this criticism makes no impression whatever upon\r\nthe authorities. I was, of course, interested next in the problem as to\r\nhow it could be possible without newspapers--the Russian press is under\r\nthe most barbarous censorship--to disseminate from St. Petersburg to\r\nOdessa with a truly uncanny rapidity, an almost monotonously uniform\r\nidea of all the events and personalities of the day. I confess I have\r\nnot yet solved the riddle. It is only a hypothesis of mine to suppose\r\nthat there are three or four centres for the formation of opinion in\r\nRussia, one of which is undoubtedly to be found in the ministry itself,\r\nand another, perhaps, in the Noblemen's Club, or in other clubs of the\r\nintelligent classes in Moscow, and that through the abundance of time\r\nwhich every Russian allows himself for recreation, every newly coined\r\nsaying or opinion is spread throughout the whole realm by letters or by\r\nword of mouth. I have heard from the lips of statesmen high in office\r\nliterally the same words I have heard at the table of Leo Tolstoï, in\r\nYasnaya Polyana, or in the study of the lawyer who gave me an interview.\r\nAfter I had come to terms with this fact of the absolute uniformity of\r\npublic opinion, a fact not altogether gratifying to the collector of\r\ninformation, it was no longer possible to ignore the question as to how\r\nit is possible that such a unison of wishes and opinions meets only deaf\r\nears in the highest circles, although it has already become a historic\r\nlegend that Alexander II. was forced into the war with Turkey against\r\nhis will by public opinion. If public opinion at that time had so much\r\npower for evil, why does it not have power now, and power for good?\r\n\r\nAn annoying question sooner or later finds an answer--whether a correct\r\none or not remains to be seen--no doubt because the mind does not rest\r\nuntil it has found something plausible wherewith to quiet itself. I\r\nfinally explained the matter to myself in the following way. The husband\r\nis the last to hear of the shame that his consort brings upon him.\r\nPeople point at him, the servants snicker, even anonymous letters\r\nflutter on his table, and still he is unsuspecting, or, at the most, is\r\ndisturbed without definitely knowing why. There is, except in the case\r\nof treachery, which is extremely rare, or the taking in the act, which\r\nis still rarer, only one possibility of enlightenment for him--namely,\r\nthat a very intimate friend or a near relative shall play the part of\r\nthe ruthless physician, and supply evidences which are irrefutable. An\r\nautocrat is hardly less interested in the credit of his system than a\r\nhusband in the reputation of his wife. This system is apparently\r\nidentical with his personality. He bears all the responsibility. He has\r\nreason for the most far-reaching suspicion of all who approach him,\r\nbecause he seldom sees any one who does not wish something of him. Who,\r\nthen, has the courage, the credit, and the means to approach the Czar,\r\nand to tell him the truth concerning what goes on about him and is done\r\nin his name? A near friend? That would have to be a foreign monarch. It\r\nis well known how carefully kings avoid seeming to advise, especially\r\nwhen the excessively proud Russian dynasty is in question. What other\r\nmonarch, moreover, must not consider his own interests, which cannot be\r\nidentical with those of Russia? the German Emperor perhaps least of\r\nall. Unfortunately, however, the relations between William II. and\r\nNicholas II. are none of the most intimate. Indeed, Nicholas openly\r\nshuns too frequent intercourse with Emperor William, and prefers when he\r\nis in Germany to play tennis with his brother-in-law of Hesse. There\r\nremains, then, only near relatives. They, indeed, are much in evidence,\r\nand they have the Czar entirely under their influence. They are public\r\nopinion for him; and as long as they have no interest in placing\r\nthemselves on the side of the opposition, so long, according to\r\nphysico-psychological laws, will the voice of the real public opinion\r\ndecrease in proportion to the square of the approach to the Czar; and\r\nall anonymous or unauthorized enlightenments and memorials by patriots\r\nwho willingly make themselves victims will make no more than a momentary\r\nimpression. The public opinion which forced the Czar Alexander II. into\r\nthe war with Turkey was the opinion of the belligerent grand-dukes; the\r\npublic opinion which rules the present Czar and thereby prevents the\r\ncounsels of the opposition from having a hearing is again that of the\r\ngrand-dukes, who move only in the narrowest court circles and in those\r\nof the reactionary bureaucracy. The Czar knows this, but he cannot help\r\nhimself. He has just now had a new experience of it, when those about\r\nhim made him firmly believe that the Japanese affair was well on the way\r\ntowards a peaceful settlement, while at the same time, by dilatory\r\ntactics and constant preparations, they provoked the Japanese to declare\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThere is only one possible position for an intelligent ruler who seeks\r\nto secure veracious information. That is to institute a free press and\r\nan independent parliament. To be sure, both press and parliament may be\r\nled astray, and lead astray. It is unquestionably easier to find one's\r\nway in a few reports of the highest counsellors than in the chaotic\r\nconfusion of voices of unmuzzled newspaper writers and members of\r\nparliament, among whom, it cannot be denied, conscienceless demagogues\r\nfind place only too quickly. But he who bears such heavy responsibility\r\nshould not avoid difficulties; and there is absolutely no other means of\r\ngaining a hearing for the truth than by the free utterance of every\r\ncriticism. Finally, one learns to read and to hear, and comes to\r\ndistinguish between real arguments and those of demagogues. No one\r\noutside the country can form a conception of how the Russian press and\r\nthe elements of parliamentary institutions are oppressed by the camorra\r\nof officials. The zemstvo of the province of Tver, which had the\r\neffrontery to entertain wishes for a constitution, was dissolved; and\r\nthis is the least that happens in such cases. The persecution of the\r\npersons who are under suspicion of exerting especial influence upon\r\ntheir fellows--this is the evil. They are surprised by night, and in the\r\nmost fortunate cases are held in prison for months during\r\ninvestigations. In other cases, when the search shows that the smallest\r\nbit of forbidden literature was in the hands of the suspected man, his\r\nexile to a distant province or to Siberia is a matter of course. These\r\nthings, however, are unfortunately only too well known. What is not so\r\nwell known is the way editors are treated who presume to wish to edit a\r\nsheet or who draw upon themselves as editors the displeasure of the\r\npolice. The head censor in St. Petersburg, chief of the highest bureau\r\nof the press, is a certain Zvyerev, a former Liberal professor in the\r\nUniversity of Moscow. Renegades are always the worst. Since Zvyerev has\r\nbeen censor the restrictions of the Russian press have been severer than\r\never. I became acquainted with the former editor-in-chief of a great\r\npaper, who sketched for me the examination he underwent before\r\npermission was granted him to edit a paper under censorship. There are,\r\nI should explain, two sorts of papers in Russia. The first are those\r\nwhich appear ostensibly without censorship, at their own risk, and at\r\nthe slightest slip are simply suppressed. It is easy to guess how ready\r\npeople are to invest in such enterprises. Those of the second sort are\r\npapers under censorship, which are submitted to the censor before they\r\nappear, and through his oversight receive a certain protection, not, to\r\nbe sure, of a very far-reaching kind. This, however, is the only method\r\nby which any capital can be secured; and without capital to-day the\r\nfounding of a paper is an impossibility.\r\n\r\nIvan Mikhailitch Golitzyn, then, wishes to start a paper, has taken all\r\npreparatory steps, has procured capital and valuable testimonials, and\r\nappears now before the mighty Zvyerev to request the final license.\r\n\r\nZvyerev is a snob and bows to a great name. Therefore he cannot\r\nimmediately say no, for the candidate has taken care to obtain\r\ntestimonials from the most prominent people. Therefore the following\r\ndialogue ensues:\r\n\r\n\"Ivan Mikhailitch, I know you and your family. You are a Russian noble,\r\nand as such are called upon to protect the interests of our Emperor and\r\nof the church. There is also nothing to be said against your patrons.\r\nBut you yourself, ever since your student days, have been under\r\nsuspicion of harboring Western ideas. Your associations also are not\r\nentirely above suspicion. I am informed that you associate with Jews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency knows that my paper is to stand for progress, which\r\ncertainly is not forbidden, and if Jews are among my acquaintances, it\r\nwould be unchristian to insult them by turning my back on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is all very well. But I should like to know whether you will\r\noppose the impertinences of the Jews with the necessary vigor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency will perceive that a paper which stands for progress\r\ncannot attack the Jews without good reason. But, on the other hand, it\r\ncannot be philo-Semitic, for our mercantile class would not advertise,\r\non account of their anti-Semitic feeling, and the paper could not\r\ncontinue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your paper support the absurd efforts which are being made towards\r\nthe introduction of a constitution?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will concern ourselves only with practical questions. The\r\nintroduction of a constitution does not belong to these.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if one of your editors should make an attempt to enter upon the\r\ndiscussion of this question, would you permit it?\"\r\n\r\n\"My editors know the programme and will not attempt any disloyalty to\r\nit. But should the case occur, it would be my duty to protect the\r\nintegrity of the programme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ivan Mikhailitch, you are a clever man and know how to make evasive\r\nanswers. I cannot refuse you a license. But I warn you! And beware of\r\nthe Jews. That is the first duty of a Russian nobleman to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the conversation which has certainly been carried on more than\r\nonce in Zvyerev's office before the founding of a paper. In striking\r\nagreement with it is the scene which Struve reports in his\r\n_Osvobozhdenie_, when, after the suppression of a paper, the editor\r\npresents himself because his license has been taken away unjustly.\r\n\r\nAgain, take the case of a Moscow paper which has published a poem\r\ndelivered at the time of a public festival, but in which the author had\r\nafterwards made some changes. The paper--I do not remember its name--was\r\nsuppressed. The publisher or the editor, who is likewise said to have\r\nbeen a Russian noble, went to St. Petersburg, and objected that, as his\r\npaper appeared under censorship, if any one was to blame it was the\r\ncensor who had let this poem pass. Zvyerev, however, showed plainly that\r\nlatter-day tendencies did not please him, and that he only wanted an\r\nexcuse for taking measures against the paper. Of course such measures\r\nmean, under some circumstances, financial ruin; in any case, severe\r\ninjury to all the contributors. Therefore suppression of the license is\r\nan unusually effective means of pressure to bring to bear against the\r\nconvictions of editors. In this case pressure of such a monstrous kind\r\nwas attempted as it is to be hoped stands alone in the chapter of\r\ncensor-tyranny. The editor was told in plain words, by Zvyerev, that he\r\nmight permit it to be stated that the poem had been smuggled into the\r\npaper behind his back by the Jews, and that the minister of the interior\r\nwould at once grant a license for the reappearance of the paper. The\r\neditor, of course, refused the demand, and a new page was added to the\r\nbook of Russian infamy. Zvyerev is still in office as a worthy assistant\r\nto his minister, Plehve.\r\n\r\nThe oppression of independent-minded organs is, however, not the only\r\nexpedient of Russian policy in regard to the press. Its antithesis is\r\nnot absent--official support of the revolutionary and provincial press.\r\nRussia rejoices in one journal which has not its equal in untruthfulness\r\nand diabolical baseness in the whole world, the _Novoye Vremya_. This\r\nPanslavic sheet, which is ready to eat all Germans and Jews alive, and\r\nwhich finds no lie too infamous, no invention too childish to serve up\r\nto its readers, if only their prejudices are tickled, is openly\r\nsupported by the Russian government. It therefore contains an\r\nincomparably greater amount of news than any other, has consequently the\r\nmost subscribers, and can pay its contributors and correspondents the\r\nbest, so that every one who wants to read a paper with plenty of news\r\nhas to take this noble organ. I found it everywhere in Russian houses,\r\nand if I asked the master of the house his opinion of it, the answer was\r\neverywhere the same: \"Infamous, but indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, then, carefully seen that in Russia, as elsewhere, emperors--and\r\nother people--do not hear the truth. The autocracy, or rather\r\nbureaucracy, surrounds itself with bulwarks which nothing can penetrate.\r\nIt will need an earthquake to make a breach. This earthquake is, indeed,\r\naccording to the common opinion of all thinking Russians, nearer than is\r\ngenerally supposed. It is the financial breaking-up of a system now held\r\ntogether only by foreign loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nSOME REALITIES OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a social gathering which I must not describe because I do not wish to\r\nmake it recognizable, I had an unusual privilege. We were drinking tea\r\nand talking--politics, of course, for no one any longer talks of\r\nanything else in Russia--when the door opened and a tall and very\r\nstately couple entered. A general exclamation hailed the new arrivals.\r\nThey were welcomed with striking heartiness and invited to the table, as\r\npeople who had returned from a long journey. When introduced to them I,\r\nof course, did not understand their names, and contented myself with\r\nenjoying the handsome appearance and elegance of the gentleman as well\r\nas of the lady until I could ask my neighbor at table why these people\r\nwere welcomed with such surprising warmth.\r\n\r\n\"He has just come out of prison,\" was the hastily whispered reply.\r\n\r\nThe communication had such an effect that I was unable to finish the\r\nmeal. It is not a usual thing for a western European to sit among the\r\nguests of a prominent family with people who have just been discharged\r\nfrom prison. Moreover, among us, culprits do not look like this\r\nuncommonly handsome pair. Finally, it is not customary with us to\r\nreceive with such heartiness people who have just discarded prison\r\nshackles. I therefore asked for the name and crime of the new-comer. I\r\nwas told, and at once I understood everything.\r\n\r\nThis courtly gentleman was a Russian noble and a prominent lawyer. At my\r\nrequest he related in German his prison experiences. He had, it seems,\r\nbeen arrested at night and immediately incarcerated. His wife had taken\r\nthe children out of bed, because even the beds had to be searched for\r\nforbidden literature, and the like. The pretext for this night visit of\r\nthe police had been that the lawyer had been informed against as having\r\ngiven shelter to a political fugitive. For this reason search was made\r\neven in the cradle of the smallest child, in order to make sure that the\r\ncriminal was not hidden there. The true ground, however, was that Mr.\r\nvon X----, as a lawyer, defended political criminals and must be dealt\r\nwith accordingly. Eleven days were spent in examining him. The search of\r\nthe house revealed nothing; for only the most reckless have a trace of\r\nforbidden literature in their houses, although Struve's\r\n_Osvobozhdenie_[7] is read almost everywhere. No other accusation could\r\nbe brought against a man so highly honored. He was also not altogether\r\nwithout means of defence in his large clientage. His case had caused a\r\ngreat sensation. The outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war had, however,\r\ncaused the authorities to content themselves with treating him to the\r\npleasures of a short residence in a police hole, and they refrained for\r\nthe time being from exiling or banishing him from the place of his\r\npractice--an experience which might easily enough happen after a much\r\nlonger investigation to lawyers less noted or of lower rank.\r\n\r\nAfter this little incident, noteworthy enough to a foreigner, I became\r\nmuch interested in the troubles of lawyers, and obtained the amplest\r\ninformation on the subject. I even incidentally made the acquaintance of\r\none of the officially disciplined lawyers of Kishinef, but was unable to\r\nconverse with him, as he spoke no language other than Russian. He was a\r\nvigorous man, rather young, with heavy, dark hair and beard, and of a\r\ndistinctively Russian type. As the son of a priest, he ought to have\r\nhad, according to the ideas of people of discretion, something better to\r\ndo than to interfere with the programme of the government. But Dr.\r\nLokoloff, the lawyer in question, is a remarkable man. He believes it to\r\nbe an advocate's duty to uphold justice; and he absolutely refused to\r\nadmit that justice in Russia is a matter of politics. I managed to learn\r\nmore about the proceedings against Dr. Lokoloff from a well-informed\r\ncolleague of his whose name I, of course, may not disclose. Since the\r\nsimple recital of such a case is more instructive than whole volumes of\r\ngeneralizations, I will give it in detail as related to me. I may,\r\nhowever, promise that the case is by no means the worst I have heard of,\r\nas the government takes much severer measures to terrorize lawyers and\r\nto prevent them from defending \"politically inconvenient\" persons. The\r\ncase of Lokoloff, moreover, calls for more detailed treatment because\r\nthe massacre perpetrated at Kishinef, in the name of the Czar, has at\r\nlast drawn public attention to the conditions in his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe participation of the government organs in the \"pogrom\" of Kishinef\r\nwas exposed by another lawyer, Dr. Paul N. von Pereverseff, who expiated\r\nhis accusation with exile to Archangel, where he and his wife now live\r\nin a village, while his children are being sheltered by relatives.\r\nPereverseff had gone to Kishinef after the disturbances, and had there\r\nmade the acquaintance of Pronin, Krushevan, Stefanoff, and Baron\r\nLevendahl, at that time in command of the gendarmes at Kishinef. Since\r\nhe came as counsel for the accused, and was a Russian nobleman above\r\nsuspicion, he at once enjoyed the confidence of these honest men. Thus\r\nhe learned that Pronin, the colleague of Krushevan and the protégé of\r\nPlehve, in his character of member of the committee for poor culprits,\r\ngave exact instructions to the prisoners how they should speak in the\r\nlegal proceedings. Pereverseff soon became convinced that the chief\r\nculprit--namely, Plehve, who had planned to administer punishment to the\r\nJews, and to present a new accusation against them to the Czar, would\r\nnot appear at the bar. Instead there would appear only the poor wretches\r\nwho had been directed to plunder and kill the Jews by order of the Czar.\r\n\r\nDr. Lokoloff arrived at Kishinef in May, 1903, as advocate for the\r\ninjured parties, and learned there from Pereverseff what the latter had\r\nalready discovered. He then made a personal investigation extending over\r\nseveral months, in the course of which he discovered also that the\r\n\"pogrom\" of the police and of Baron Levendahl had been instigated by\r\ndirect orders from higher authorities. He gave expression to this\r\nconviction in the course of the proceedings, and was, in consequence,\r\nimprisoned on an order telegraphed direct from the minister of the\r\ninterior to Prince Urussoff, the governor, on December 9, 1903.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the despatch of the telegram a letter from Plehve\r\nreached Prince Urussoff, in which the former desired that the\r\nproceedings of Lokoloff in Kishinef be immediately reported and his\r\nexile to the north decreed. Prince Urussoff himself visited Lokoloff in\r\nprison, and made him acquainted with Plehve's message, whereupon\r\nLokoloff wrote a protocol in answer to four charges based upon data\r\nfurnished by the gendarmes, as follows (the accusation is given first\r\nand is followed by Lokoloff's answer):\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"I. It is asserted that you have come to Kishinef in a\r\n     professional capacity, with the ostensible purpose of affording\r\n     legal assistance to the injured parties, but in reality to carry\r\n     on, in conjunction with other persons whose activity in opposition\r\n     to the government is well known, a private investigation parallel\r\n     with the legal one, to incite the Jews to make biased statements,\r\n     serviceable to the purposes of the opposition, and to bring forward\r\n     groundless complaints.\r\n\r\n     \"_Answer._ Yes, I have carried on an investigation, and in so doing\r\n     have only discharged my duty. It is not forbidden in our country to\r\n     conduct investigation openly or secretly. My course of action was\r\n     dictated solely by the interests of my clients and the inadequate\r\n     official investigation. Very rich men took part in the\r\n     disturbances; but the official investigation detected only _poor_\r\n     ones as the accused. The interests of the injured persons, however,\r\n     demand that the _rich_ culprits also be brought to justice. The\r\n     investigation made by me was no secret. The governor, the state\r\n     attorney, the court of appeal, and the county court knew of it; and\r\n     I received my information in regard to the disturbances from\r\n     inhabitants of the city. In order to secure this information, I\r\n     questioned many hundreds of people who had been witnesses of the\r\n     disturbances. My offices were in special rooms, which were known to\r\n     the police. The assertion that the testimony was biased and false\r\n     is itself false.\r\n\r\n     \"II. You have deliberately spread false assertions in order to\r\n     discredit the local authorities in the eyes of the government.\r\n\r\n     \"_Answer._ I have never deliberately spread false assertions in\r\n     order to discredit the local authorities in the eyes of the\r\n     government.\r\n\r\n     \"III. You have made use of your official position as counsel to\r\n     publish information concerning proceedings in closed sessions,\r\n     including the deliberately false assertion that in the legal\r\n     process the connivance of the authorities in the organization of\r\n     the disturbances, with the help of the authorities and of the\r\n     troops, was proved.\r\n\r\n     \"_Answer._ I have never said that the disturbances were organized\r\n     by the government. But from very exact statements of witnesses, I\r\n     consider it proved that the disturbances were organized with the\r\n     help of very many official persons--as, for instance, Baron\r\n     Levendahl. [Here followed an exact statement of the details of the\r\n     action of Levendahl, which space will not permit me to give.] The\r\n     judge during the investigation, Freynat, himself acknowledged to me\r\n     that the leaders of the incendiaries were agents of Levendahl. I\r\n     myself demanded the attendance of Judge Freynat as a witness to\r\n     this. He was called, but not until after all the lawyers had been\r\n     excluded!\r\n\r\n     \"The agents of Levendahl, who were imprisoned with the murderers,\r\n     were set free in the course of a few days, as is testified to by\r\n     witnesses.\r\n\r\n     \"IV. You are in very intimate relations with persons who belong to\r\n     the radical opposition. These persons are Dr. Doroshevsky and Miss\r\n     Nemtzeva.\r\n\r\n     \"_Answer._ Relations are not forbidden. I made the acquaintance of\r\n     Dr. Doroshevsky and Miss Nemtzeva only because they took part in\r\n     the 'pogrom,' to the extent of saving many Jews. Miss Vera Nemtzeva\r\n     is, moreover, the daughter of a respected proprietor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLokoloff wrote to the governor from prison to the effect that the\r\naccusations were groundless, and that he was not guilty. On the receipt\r\nof this letter Prince Urussoff visited him in his cell and admitted\r\nthat, in his judgment, Lokoloff was, in fact, wrongfully imprisoned. The\r\nimprisonment, however, had been in obedience to an order from the\r\nminister of the interior. The prince showed Lokoloff a copy of a letter\r\nwhich he had sent to Plehve. This letter stated that according to\r\nPrince Urussoff's interpretation of the law the action of Lokoloff did\r\nnot constitute a crime, and that therefore he could not order his\r\nbanishment to the north, but that Lokoloff was \"fanatically convinced\"\r\nthat the \"pogrom\" had been organized with the connivance of the\r\nauthorities, and that he had unconsciously imparted this conviction to\r\nthose with whom he came in contact. Therefore his residence in Kishinef\r\nmust be considered dangerous.\r\n\r\nAfter some days Urussoff received a telegram from Plehve directing that\r\nLokoloff be liberated and that he be expelled from Kishinef.\r\n\r\nPlehve's order was communicated by the governor to Lokoloff, who\r\nexpressed his astonishment that he should be expelled from Kishinef,\r\nwhile Pronin, who in Urussoff's own opinion was one of the chief\r\noffenders, was allowed to remain. This order, he added, would not tend\r\nto a feeling of confidence in justice in Bessarabia.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the expulsion of Lokoloff was generally looked upon\r\nas fresh evidence of the complicity of the government in the\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nNo one in Kishinef now knows anything more about the affair.\r\nPereverseff, who had directly attacked the government, was severely\r\npunished and banished; Lokoloff was expelled. \"All quiet in Schepko\r\nStreet.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the members of the legal profession in Russia do not regard\r\nthe matter with indifference. At a meeting of the Association of\r\nLawyers' Assistants the sympathy of those present was extended to\r\nLokoloff; and at the monthly banquet of the Literary Alliance at St.\r\nPetersburg the members even went so far as to express its disapprobation\r\nof the action of the government in the affair.\r\n\r\nThe minister of justice, Muraviev, however, the worthy colleague of\r\nPlehve, explained to a deputation of lawyers which congratulated him on\r\nhis jubilee in January last, that he was favorably disposed towards the\r\nprofession, but that advocates would do well to _avoid \"pleading\r\npolitically,\" since it was very prejudicial, indeed dangerous, to the\r\nprofession, which might easily suffer for its independence._ A word to\r\nthe wise, etc.\r\n\r\nSuch are the joys of the legal profession in Russia, and such is the\r\nfate of those who speak in defence of the right. The people of other\r\ncountries will appreciate the services to truth and justice which, in\r\nspite of all obstacles, the undaunted advocate performs.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the stern realities of an advocate's life in Russia,\r\nand such the possible, nay probable, fate of any one who \"pleads\r\npolitically\" in defence of the right. It will be apparent to the\r\ncitizens of other countries at what a cost the conscientious members of\r\nthe legal profession discharge, in spite of endless obstacles, their\r\nduty to truth and justice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] Liberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE STUDENT BODY IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nNot very long after the dismissal of the former minister of education,\r\nSänger, I sought out a certain university professor who had been\r\nmentioned to me as being accurately informed about university affairs.\r\nOf course, my visit to him had been carefully planned, for it is not\r\npossible in Russia for a person--least of all if he be an official--to\r\nexpress himself freely to strangers.\r\n\r\nThe information which I received from this authority on the general\r\npolitical and economic position of Russia agreed with the discussions I\r\nhad heard on every side. Misery, despair, inevitable collapse, these\r\nwere the words which were most noticeable in his description, too, and\r\nit would be almost superfluous for one to reproduce the conversation\r\nunless certain additional details had been brought out which are\r\nparticularly characteristic of the intense ferment in which intellectual\r\nRussia is at just this time involved.\r\n\r\nJust previously several students had been arrested. I asked about the\r\ncause of the arrest and the probable fate of the young folks. A\r\ndemonstration in favor of the Japanese had been held by the students,\r\nand had been reported. This was the cause of the arrest. \"As yet nothing\r\ncan be said about the fate of the incautious young men,\" the professor\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\"You say that the students held a demonstration for the Japanese? It is\r\nscarcely credible!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it is true. All enlightened people, and accordingly the\r\nstudents, too, regard the Japanese as an unexpected ally in their fight\r\nagainst the existing conditions, and so sympathy for them is not\r\nconcealed. And, besides, aversion to them as a nation does not exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is the very brothers and fellow-countrymen of the students who\r\nmust pay for it with their own blood if the Japanese retain the upper\r\nhand!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is partially true. But, first of all, Poles, Jews, and Armenians\r\nhave been sent to the seat of war, so that the Russian families do not\r\nas yet feel the war so keenly; and then the Russian is used to the idea\r\nthat there must be bloody sacrifices for the cause of freedom. At any\r\nrate, those who were arrested are much nearer the other students than\r\nthe troops who have gone to the front.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they challenged their fate!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a part of the fight against the régime. They seek martyrdom,\r\nsince they have become convinced that nothing can be attained by bare\r\nprotests and petitions. Perhaps a trace of Asiatic fatalism, and a lower\r\nvaluation upon life than is given it in the West, plays a part in their\r\nacts, but, more powerful than all else probably, their conviction that\r\npublic opinion appreciates their sacrifices and approves of their\r\nconduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then ambition is also an influence?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you care to call it so. There is a little ambition in every\r\nmartyrdom. But the strongest motive is that youthful self-sacrifice, and\r\nthe belief that something can be attained for the cause by their\r\noffering themselves up--in short, fanaticism. In this way some of the\r\nmost incredible things occur; for example, a student in prison emptied\r\nan oil lamp over his body and set fire to it only in order to protest\r\nagainst absolutism.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard this horrible story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who are now under arrest,\" the professor continued, \"will\r\nprobably most of them soon be let free, for I do not believe that the\r\nauthorities have at present any desire to raise much of a storm. But as\r\nmany of them as are Jews will in all probability be more severely\r\npunished, if only for statistical reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. You know that the police have their special code for the Jews,\r\nso as to prove that the discontent is entirely due to them. Plehve\r\nasserts that he has forty thousand political indictments, eighty per\r\ncent. of the indicted being Jews. That is made up to suit themselves,\r\nand has nothing to do with turbulence. On the other hand, I dare say,\r\nthat quite often just for this statistical reason, and because the Jews\r\nare punished quite differently from the sons of distinguished families,\r\nthe Jews are urged by their congeners not to expose themselves; but\r\nthey, too, are of course infected by the general fanaticism of\r\nself-sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But from what do the special student disturbances about which we hear\r\nso much proceed? Are they not caused by troubles in the universities?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in the very rarest cases. It is occurrences of general politics\r\nwhich find a particularly lively echo among the students; the reforms\r\nwhich are demanded for the university by us, the professors, are even\r\nrepudiated by the students, because they do not wish to let the causes\r\nof their discontent be removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the nature of the reforms in question?\"\r\n\r\n\"General Wannowski, former minister of education, was perhaps a man of\r\nlimited capacity, who considered the university a barracks, the\r\nprofessors colonels and other officers, the students privates, and\r\nexplained that the only thing lacking was non-commissioned officers to\r\nkeep their respective squads in order. Still he showed us the\r\nconsideration of asking us eighteen questions which were to be answered\r\nby the faculties. Look here\"--the professor pointed to a heavy bundle of\r\nprinted matter--\"here you have the results of our inquest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the substance of your wishes, to put it into a very few\r\nwords?\"\r\n\r\n\"One word is sufficient, 'Autonomy.' We want independence in teaching,\r\n'Lehrfreiheit' as it is in Germany, independent regulation of our own\r\naffairs, and liberation from the direction of another department which\r\nhas neither interest in us nor understanding of us. This demand was\r\nunanimously expressed by all the universities; in Moscow only two\r\nprofessors in the whole faculty declared themselves for the prevalent\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was anything accomplished by this inquest?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a slight extent. We obtained a university court, constituted of\r\nprofessors, and the permission to form scientific societies among the\r\nstudents.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not so bad. And you say that the students are not in sympathy\r\nwith that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are afraid that discontent may be lessened by these\r\nconcessions, and they wish to be discontented until they have\r\naccomplished everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'everything'?\"\r\n\r\n\"A constitution and freedom of the press. They do not even use the right\r\nto form scientific societies. _At present there is no studying done at\r\nour universities_; politics have swallowed up everything, and the\r\nradical element has seized the leadership completely. They hope in a few\r\nmonths, by means of demonstrations, and Heaven knows what fateful\r\nresources, to attain a constitution, and after that there will always be\r\ntime enough for study. At present, study, too, would be treason against\r\nthe cause of freedom. The universities are only political camps\r\nawaiting the call to arms and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in this respect, at least, they must be glad of their independent\r\nuniversity courts--that is, that at any rate they punish their youthful\r\nmisdeeds more leniently than the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. In the first place, it is only disciplinary matters over which our\r\ncourt has jurisdiction; and then, in the second place, you forget that\r\nthe students do not at all want to be mildly treated, but to be\r\nsacrificed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. It is hard to reckon with motives that one scarcely\r\nunderstands. But one thing is still unintelligible to me. It cannot\r\nexactly be said that Russia is a radical country in the sense that the\r\nwhole upper stratum is radical. How is it that the student body, which\r\ncomes principally from this upper stratum, is so laden with\r\nrevolutionary tendencies?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might answer you in a French phrase, although it is not particularly\r\nflattering to us, 'Le Russe est liberal jusqu'à trente ans, et\r\naprès--canaille.'[8] The Russian is absolutely _not_ conservative, not\r\neven the official. He can mock conservatism while seeking office, but in\r\nhis own house he remains a free-thinker, and youth, which has not yet\r\nlearned to cringe and hedge, blushes at the two-facedness of its\r\nparentage, and continually reveals the true attitude of the house. Then,\r\nwith the exception of the high nobility, our whole landowner class is\r\nmore than liberal. Moreover, from two to three hundred conservative\r\nstudents are to be found at each of the great universities, and they\r\nhave formed a secret association for the protection of the _sacred\r\nrégime_--and it is characteristic that the _Novoye Vremya_ was allowed\r\nto print the call to form this secret society, although here in Russia\r\nall secret societies are illegal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are not these conservative students dangerous to their fellows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up to the present they have confined themselves to patriotic\r\ndemonstrations. They might become dangerous if they once decided to go\r\nto lectures--not even then to their fellow-students, but to the\r\nprofessors, who have greater doctrinal freedom, and who also make use of\r\nthe right to express their opinions, of course within the limits of\r\ntheir special subjects. [Shortly after this interview a professor in\r\nKharkov who had expressed sympathy for the Japanese was actually\r\ninformed against by the conservative students and disciplined by the\r\nauthorities, a thing which led to great student demonstrations.]\r\nMoreover, there are special spies which keep watch over the professors\r\nand students, but luckily they are too illiterate to understand the\r\nimport of what is said, and therefore can do little damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the professors sufficiently in sympathy with each other for the\r\nformation of a university esprit de corps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly. The common suffering, the fact that they are forbidden\r\nto take open part in politics draw them together. Where in other places\r\nrivalries and differences of opinion occasion dissensions, here there is\r\nto be found only one solid whole--oppression is the firm cement. And\r\nonly in this way is it possible to make some resistance to the\r\nabsolutism of the police. In _open_ resistance we are quite weak, yes,\r\neven defenceless, against the brutality of the régime, but in _passive_\r\nresistance we are almost unconquerable because of our close contact with\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! And so here there is brought to my attention one of those\r\nsubterranean sources of public opinion in Russia, which I have so long\r\nsought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. The universities form at least one of the main channels.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you consider the next generation to be thoroughly impregnated with\r\nideas of independence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thoroughly.\"\r\n\r\nTo the question with which I always parted from my authorities--that is,\r\nwhat he believed the immediate future contained for Russia--this\r\nprofessor, whose department I am not at liberty to indicate, but of whom\r\nI can say that he is particularly well informed, gave the following\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n\"We are exhausted. The transition to the financing of railroads, tariff\r\nlegislation, the tightening of screws of taxation bring in money for a\r\nwhile, but no real power. We are on the brink of a crisis. I believe\r\nthat the war will greatly accelerate and force us to discount our\r\ncoupons.[9] Then, in my opinion, it cannot be long before a sort of\r\nnational assembly is called. This is my belief and my hope. Conditions\r\nof excitement like the present ones at our universities cannot be long\r\nendured under any circumstances. In one way or another a change must\r\ntake place, and we must hold fast to the hope of better things.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The Russian is liberal until his thirtieth year--and then he joins\r\nthe rabble.\r\n\r\n[9] Den Coupon zu kürzen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE CATASTROPHE[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to have a striking evidence of the worth of our government,\r\nyou need notice only one thing,\" said an entirely unprejudiced Russian\r\nto me one day. \"We have as many questions as we have classes of\r\npopulation. We have a Finnish question, a Polish, a Jewish, a Ruthenian,\r\nand a Caucasian question. We have, besides, a peasant question, a labor\r\nquestion, and a sectarian question, and, moreover, a student question\r\nalso. Wherever you cut into the conglomerate of the Russian population,\r\nlengthwise or crosswise, everywhere you strike conflicts, combustibles,\r\nand tension. Not a single one of the problems which may exist in\r\norganized states in general is solved, but every one has been made\r\nburning and dangerous through unskilful, brutal, and even malicious\r\nhandling.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who spoke in this way was not a Liberal, but a Conservative\r\naristocrat in the state service. I had reserved him for the end in my\r\njourney of research. After I had had conversations with high officials\r\nin the departments of education and of finance, with men like Prince\r\nUkhtomski, with bankers and with lawyers, and had heard always the same\r\nstory of the instability of things and the worthlessness of the régime,\r\nI turned to the friends who by their influence had smoothed the way for\r\nme everywhere, and said to them: \"This cannot go on. I did not come to\r\nRussia merely to be shot, as it were, out of a pneumatic tube through a\r\ncollection of Liberal and Radical malcontents. I do not wish to hear\r\nmerely the opposition in Russia. You must gain access for me to some\r\nprominent Conservative also, one who stands on the basis of the present\r\nsystem, and who honestly and in good faith defends it. It need not be\r\nSuvorin or any other man of questionable honor, for I myself can apply\r\nStahl's theories to Russian conditions. It must be a sincere, reputable,\r\nand sensible man with whom I can discuss the most widely different\r\nquestions with or without an interpreter; either is the same to me.\"\r\n\r\nMy request was readily granted. A scholar admired almost to the point of\r\nworship, in whose house I had been entertained, gave me a letter to the\r\nConservative aristocrat whose words I have quoted at the beginning of\r\nthis paper. This letter I forwarded to the honorable gentleman in\r\nquestion, asking for an interview, and by return mail I received a reply\r\nstating that he would expect me that same afternoon.\r\n\r\nI must confess that I anticipated this interview with some qualms. It\r\nwas towards the end of my visit. The results hitherto obtained had the\r\ndisadvantage of a certain monotony of sombreness, with, however, the\r\nadvantage also that each succeeding interview only strengthened the\r\nimpression gained from previous ones. Thus by degrees I had formed a\r\nvery sharply defined image of Russian conditions--such an image as is\r\npictured in the mind of the thinking Russian. Was this clear and\r\ndistinct image now to be dispelled by the lye of this Conservative\r\ncritic, and was I to lose the chief result of my journey, a confidence\r\nin the trustworthiness of the data hitherto accumulated?\r\n\r\nI met the gentleman at his house at the appointed time, and learned at\r\nonce that I had been especially commended to him. I therefore entered\r\nwithout hesitation upon the matter in which I was interested.\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish,\" I began, \"to go through Russia in blinders. If your\r\nexcellency, as a Conservative, will have the goodness to refute what I\r\nhave heard hitherto, and will give me more accurate information, I shall\r\nbe under great obligation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you heard?\" asked the count.\r\n\r\n\"That Russia is starving, while the papers report a surplus in the\r\ntreasury.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, unfortunately, is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"That your thinking people are in despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Also true.\"\r\n\r\n\"That a revival of the Reign of Terror is to be feared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Equally true.\"\r\n\r\n\"That all Russia hopes the war will be lost, because only in that way\r\ncan the present state of things be brought to an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"True again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the present régime passes all bounds of depravity, and can be\r\ncompared only with the Prætorian rule in the period of the decline of\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\n\"That understates the truth.\"\r\n\r\nMy face must have taken on a very strange expression during this brisk\r\nplay of question and answer, for the count now took the initiative, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You are, I can see, surprised that I, as a Conservative and a state\r\nofficial, should answer in this way; but I hope you do not consider\r\n'conservative' and 'infamous' synonymous terms. If you do not, you will\r\nnot expect me to approve the régime of Plehve. That is not a\r\nConservative régime. It is the régime of hell founded by a devil at the\r\nhead of the most important department.\" (Here came the speech with which\r\nthis paper began.) The count then proceeded: \"Do not suppose that Russia\r\nis of necessity smitten with such serious problems. These questions are\r\nnowhere simpler than with us. We have no national problems like those of\r\nPrussia, for instance, or of Austria-Hungary, which are complicated by\r\nthe fact that majorities and minorities are mixed together almost beyond\r\nseparation. We have even in Poland almost no national aspirations\r\nregarding which we could not come to a peaceable understanding. Our\r\nnationalities live almost entirely distinct, in compact bodies side by\r\nside; even the Finns are politically separate. It would be an easy thing\r\nto make them all contented under just maintenance of the supremacy of\r\nthe Czar. But the priestlike intolerance of Pobydonostzev has spread the\r\nidea in the world that all diversities of religion and speech must be\r\nironed out with a hot flat-iron, even at the risk of singeing heads.\r\nSince then it is considered patriotic to repress men and convictions.\r\nFor this business unclean creatures are to be found who make careers for\r\nthemselves in this way; and their prototype is the tenfold renegade\r\nPlehve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet I cannot conceal my astonishment, your excellency, that you, as a\r\nConservative, have this opinion of the system of Pobydonostzev.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is that so illogical? Conservative thought is, above all, that of\r\norganic development. All violence is revolutionary in its essence,\r\nwhether it serves reactionary or republican tendencies. The system of\r\nPobydonostzev is revolutionary and reactionary. In his fashion Plehve,\r\nhowever, is simply a monstrous bill of extortion against the Czar as\r\nwell as against the shackled nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency of course refers to the idea that Plehve intimidates\r\nthe Czar by threats of revolution?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not an idea simply; it is a fact, of which we have very\r\ndefinite information. But what not every one knows is the fact that we\r\nhave no one but Plehve to thank for this war, which may be a\r\ncatastrophe. He had a finger in all the manoeuvres of delay which\r\nprovoked the Japanese to war, because he believed that he could no\r\nlonger preserve himself in any other way than by diverting public\r\nattention from conditions in the interior, and by ridding himself of\r\nthose who were dissatisfied with him into the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"How the latter?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know? It is very simple. The first men who were sent to Asia\r\nwere the Poles, the Jews, and the Armenians. Among our troops the Poles\r\nwere five times as largely represented, and the Jews even more so, than\r\nthey should have been according to their census number. And you must\r\nsearch to discover a Christian among the reserve surgeons. Why is this\r\nthe case? To get rid of the most important elements of the malcontents\r\nfor years, perhaps forever. Of course, the Poles, the Jews, and the\r\nRuthenians have the most cause for discontent. Meanwhile there is peace\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to a remarkable extent, I observe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait. The students, who are so incautious in airing their ideas, will\r\ncome to know the East.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your excellency, no Radical has spoken like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well understand that. The honorable Radicals have much less\r\ncause to be dissatisfied with this rule of banditti, for it sends the\r\nwater to their mills. But a Conservative like myself sees with horror\r\nthat all the foundations of the Conservative order of things are\r\nundermined, and that we are approaching exactly the same convulsions\r\nthat France experienced after the spontaneous downfall of her absolute\r\nmonarchy.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what respect, then, does your excellency distinguish yourself as a\r\nConservative from the so-called Liberals? Certainly not in criticism?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will explain. The Liberals are Girondists, with their ideas adopted\r\nfrom Cahier and Rousseau. Minister Turgot was a Conservative, who wished\r\nto save the monarchy by trying to make an end of the loose management of\r\nfavorites. We Conservatives do not believe in a constitution or a\r\nparliament as the only means of salvation. We Russians are anything but\r\nripe for that. It is a question if any people of the Continent,\r\nuntrained in English self-government, are ripe for it. We look to the\r\nCzar for salvation, and to the Czar alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince Ukhtomski says much the same thing. He does not speak of Liberal\r\nor Conservative, but only of an intelligent party in Russia, and he\r\nbelieves that an able minister could save the whole situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe that for an instant. For, under the present\r\ncircumstances, an able and honest minister cannot remain at court. There\r\nis only one salvation--a czar who is so educated for his task of ruling\r\nthat he is not the plaything of a circle of courtiers, like our present\r\ngood Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard a saying of Pobydonostzev, 'Autocracy is good, but it\r\ninvolves an autocrat.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; even if it were not Pobydonostzev's opinion. For brutality\r\nalone certainly will not do. We must have knowledge of the subject and\r\nstrength of will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the future must look very black to your excellency, if you await\r\nsalvation from a new and better-trained czar. At present there is not\r\neven a prospect of a successor to the throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks black enough. I have no hope at all. For what is hope to\r\nothers is to me new ground for sorrow. We shall be defeated in Asia. We\r\nshall have a financial crash--_i. e._, our long-existent bankruptcy can\r\nno longer be veiled by juggling with the budget; and then we shall have\r\na repetition of the old game of revolutions and constitutions. Some\r\nWestern ideas on constitution-making will be imported and will not work.\r\nThere will come a reaction, and the hand of every man will be against\r\nevery other....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your excellency is opposed to the freedom of the press?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid! A Conservative régime is far from being a police régime. We\r\nmust have a public opinion and a respectable press, and a press without\r\nfreedom cannot be respectable. A press which is under strict laws but\r\nnot under police tyranny, and an honorable government, can both be\r\nbrought about more easily under an absolute monarchy than under\r\nparliamentary rule; but there will be no question of all this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find hardly any essential difference between the ideas your\r\nexcellency represents and those I have been hearing for months in\r\nRussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot wonder at that. If you should ask me whether the snow\r\nout-of-doors is white or green, I also, as a Conservative, can only\r\nanswer that it is white. We are in a bad way; our peasantry is starving,\r\nour thinking class is in despair, our finances are ravaged. Yet I\r\nbelieve that far more evil days are before us, and I thank God that I am\r\nan old man who has seen the worst.\"\r\n\r\nSo ended my interview with the Conservative, whom I had sought out for\r\nthe correction of the Radical views I had heard. In the evening I had to\r\nmake a report to my friends, who had waited it in suspense. My\r\ninformation created an immense sensation. Something entirely different\r\nfrom the interview had been expected, and there was astonishment at\r\nhearing views as bitter as any one present could have formulated. Had he\r\npermitted me to publish the conversation with his name?\r\n\r\n\"The conversation, but not his name,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nA general \"Aha!\" went up from all present.\r\n\r\n\"That is the way with our chinovniks,\" remarked some one; \"in a\r\ntête-à-tête they are all Liberal, and as soon as they are on the retired\r\nlist they are all Radical.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon. Count X---- spoke with decision against a constitution,\r\ntherefore he is not a Liberal.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must beg of you,\" came in an almost unanimous chorus, \"for Heaven's\r\nsake, not to adopt this view and represent it abroad. It would be the\r\ngreatest misfortune that could happen to us if the outer world should\r\nbelieve that we really are not ripe for a constitution. We do not need\r\nan English or a Belgian constitution, to be sure, but a free parliament\r\nand a free press we do need. Otherwise there is no reliance to be placed\r\nupon any reform, and the farther from the centre the more Asiatic will\r\nbe the rule of the satraps.\"\r\n\r\n\"My duty is to report and not to judge,\" said I, dryly. \"I owe it to my\r\nauthority to reproduce his views as he gave them to me. The only thing\r\nthat I can do is to add your criticism to my report.\"\r\n\r\nThey were satisfied with this offer; and in accordance therewith I have\r\nreproduced the interview.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[10] An interview with a Russian Conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nSECTARIANS AND SOCIALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI was taken one day to see a young Russian nobleman who was making a\r\nspecial study of the nature of sects. We drove to the outermost skirts\r\nof Moscow and stopped before a small palace. My companion, another young\r\nboyar, spoke to the servants, and after a few minutes we were conducted\r\nup a broad marble staircase to the first floor, where a suite of rooms\r\nfurnished in extremely modern style opened out before us. I remarked to\r\nmy companion that, after all, there really are no boundaries between\r\ncountries, for this little palace with its very modern interior might\r\njust as well have been in Paris or London as here in Moscow. Instead of\r\nanswering, the boyar motioned towards the ikon which hung in a corner.\r\nModern furnishings, a bookcase filled with the most modern philosophical\r\nliterature, and above it the orthodox ikon--we were in Moscow, after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house came in and embraced and kissed his friend. I\r\nwas introduced, and we shook hands. Cigarettes were lighted, and without\r\nfurther formalities the young host took some manuscripts from a shelf\r\nand began to give me a private reading. My companion helped out when the\r\nreader's vocabulary failed him. It is thus that I am in a position to\r\ngive from my notes the following excerpts from a work which cannot be\r\nprinted in Russia, because it deals with the forbidden subject of the\r\ncharacter of sects in a fashion not entirely acceptable to the censor.\r\n\r\nThe significance of sects in the inner structure of Russian life is best\r\nshown by some figures which give approximately their membership. In the\r\nyear 1860 about ten million Raskolniks (non-conformists) were counted;\r\nin 1878, fourteen million; in 1897, twenty million; and to-day they\r\nnumber thirty million. These non-conformists not only do not belong to\r\nthe orthodox church, but stand in hostility to the state, which\r\nidentifies itself with the orthodox church. The sects are constantly\r\nincreasing in number, and there is no doubt whatever that they answer\r\nmuch better to the religious needs of the Russian people than the state\r\nchurch, just as they already comprise what is morally the best part of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe sects interested me less in themselves--although every expression of\r\nthe human instinct of faith is of psychological interest--than in their\r\nbearing on the question as to how far they are united to form a\r\nrevolutionary army which could disarm and overthrow the autocracy and\r\nthen take in hand the new order of things. I tried to inform myself on\r\nthis point from my attractive host's reading. I also asked about it\r\ndirectly. The answers I received have no room for expectation of a\r\nrevolutionary organization in the near future. According to them\r\ndeliverance cannot come from below. Absolution no longer has the masses\r\nin hand, but it is at least able to prevent any general, all-inclusive\r\norganization of the dissatisfied; and the thinking class in the\r\nopposition to the government did not find the way to the people until\r\nthe most recent times. Only within the last few years has it been\r\nreported that the peasantry is beginning to show symptoms of unusual\r\nfermentation, the authors of which are unknown. The government does what\r\nit can. It has spent nine million rubles for the strengthening of the\r\nprovincial mounted police. According to the accepted view the sects\r\narose because Patriarch Nikon wished to have the sacred writings and\r\nbooks of ritual then in use, in which textual errors were to be found,\r\nreplaced by texts carefully revised according to the originals. The\r\nclergy, however, clinging to the old routine, opposed this. When the\r\ngreat council of May 13, 1667, declared itself in favor of Nikon's\r\nproposed reform, the division became complete. From that time forward\r\nthe opposition of \"Old Believers\" (Starovertzy) became the heart of all\r\npopular movements against the imperial power. My host represented a\r\ndifferent shade of opinion. According to his idea, the sects arose with\r\nthe introduction of Christianity, and they represent the opposition of\r\nthe simple paganism of the people to the complicated casuistry of the\r\nByzantine Church. Until the fourteenth century, he thinks, the church\r\ntried to keep with the sectarians, and suffered the procession to go\r\naccording to the old pagan usage, with the sun instead of against it.\r\nSince the fourteenth century, however, the church has identified itself\r\nwith the power of the state. From this time dates the hostility of the\r\nsects to the government. Nevertheless, until the seventeenth century,\r\nlocal gods were tolerated as patron saints. But when Bishop Mascarius\r\nissued a list of the saints recognized by the state, the quarrel with\r\nsects which clung to their own saints was made eternal. Since that time\r\nthe sectarians have not troubled themselves at all with the official\r\nreligious literature. They print their own books on secret presses.\r\n\r\nSectarianism really represents, therefore, in the first place, the\r\nnational opposition of the Russians to Byzantium; next, the opposition\r\nto St. Petersburg, and especially to Peter the Great, who was and is\r\nregarded as antichrist. But side by side with these nationalistic\r\nreligious sects, and far in advance of them, have grown up mystically\r\nrationalistic ones also. Some of these, going back to early Christian\r\nideas, refuse to bear arms and to take oath in court, like the German\r\nAnabaptists, Nazarenes, and Baptists. Others oppose the church on mere\r\ngrounds of judgment, and lead a life regulated according to the\r\nteachings of pure reason. The Old Believers, after long and terrible\r\nmartyrdoms in which their priests were burned or otherwise executed, and\r\nafter a sort of recantation, finally came to an understanding with the\r\nstate and are at present in part tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of rationalistic--mystic--sects, however, have\r\nremained hostile to the government, and are persecuted on all sides by\r\nthe state, although a great part of their members lead much more moral\r\nlives than the orthodox Russians.\r\n\r\nThey are to be distinguished at present--sects with priests (\"Popovtzy\")\r\nand sects without priests (\"Bezpopovtzy\"). The first are the Old\r\nBelievers, who are especially well represented in the rich merchant\r\nclass in Moscow and are recognized by the state. They may be\r\ndistinguished by their uncut beards, by their mode of crossing\r\nthemselves, and by their great piety.\r\n\r\nThe sects without priests are, however, the most interesting. The most\r\ncharacteristic among them are the Self-burners, or Danielites, the\r\nBeguny, or Pilgrims, the Khlysty, or Scourgers, the Skoptzy and Skakuny,\r\nor Jumpers.[11] Their customs show what psychology knows\r\nalready--namely, that religious emotion leads easily to sexual, and then\r\nboth tend to revel in bloody ideas. One is led, indeed, to question\r\nwhether the fascinating effect of so many of the stories of saints must\r\nnot be traced back to that psychological connection in the\r\nsubconsciousness. With the Danielites voluntary death by fire is\r\nconsidered meritorious. The Beguny are vagabonds, \"without passport,\" an\r\nunheard-of thing according to Russian ideas, without name, without\r\nproper institutions. In this sect men and women live together\r\npromiscuously. They are supported by secret members of the sect who live\r\nin towns, and who do not, like the regular Beguny, expose themselves to\r\nthe standing curse of antichrist--_i. e._, the state. The Khlysty have\r\ndirect revelations from heaven in the state of ecstasy which they\r\nexperience at their devotional meetings. They are flagellants, dance in\r\nrings until they are exhausted, and then sink all together in a general\r\norgy. The Skoptzy castrate themselves in such circumstances. The\r\nSkakuny, or Jumpers, dance in pairs in the woods with frightfully\r\ndislocated limbs until they sink down exhausted. All these sects are\r\naccused of child murder. They are said to wish to send children\r\nunspotted to the kingdom of heaven. It is to be noted that all these\r\ndata are unreliable, because no stranger is admitted to the secret\r\ndevotions, while the imaginations of the denouncers have just as much\r\ntendency to revel in sexual and sanguinary ideas as that of the exalted\r\ndevotees. The persecution of these sects by the government is easy to\r\nunderstand. Spiritual epidemics must be fought as much as physical\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the rationalistic sects is quite unjustifiable. They\r\ndo not deserve the name of sects at all, for in other countries similar\r\nones form simply free political, ethical, or philosophical societies.\r\nCertainly they can only benefit the communities in which they exist by\r\ntheir high ideal of integrity and strict morality. Count Leo Tolstoï has\r\nalready made the banishment of the Doukhobors known to all the world as\r\nan infamous proceeding, and has thereby raised large contributions for\r\ntheir settlement in Canada. The Shaloputy and the Malevents, for the\r\nmost part Ruthenians, have a really ideal character, free from the\r\nnarrowness and superstition of the church, without ritual, industrious,\r\nhelpful, peaceful, and kindly. They live together in a state of\r\nfree-love marriages, without constraint of church or state, neither lie\r\nnor swear, and do good even to their enemies. The Stundists, who are\r\nsaid to have originated with the German pastor Bonekemper, in the\r\nRohrbach colony near Odessa, are similarly virtuous communists, who do\r\nnot trouble themselves about the state, hold all property in common,\r\nadjust all quarrels among themselves, and harm nobody. The formula of\r\nthe report with which the gendarmes are accustomed to give notice of the\r\ndiscovery of a Stundist is characteristic: \"I was passing the house of\r\nFarmer X---- and his son and saw them both reading in a book. I entered\r\nand ascertained that this book is the Gospel. Farmer X---- and his son\r\nare therefore Stundists, and as such are most respectfully reported to\r\nthe authorities.\" Russian nobles have been exiled to Siberia for the\r\ncrime of reading the Gospel to their servants. A former officer of the\r\nguards, Vassili Alexandrovitch Pashkov, who dedicated all his means to\r\nphilanthropy and held religious exercises, was expelled from St.\r\nPetersburg and the movement named for him was suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhy is all this? The narrow-mindedness of Pobydonostzev's system permits\r\nno falling-away from the official church. The police state tolerates no\r\nsuspicious morality. The thinking class in Russia quote with bitterness\r\nAksakov's saying, \"Be a rascal, but be correct in your politics\" (\"Bud,\r\nrazvraten, no bud, blagonamyeren\"). Debauchery is directly commended to\r\nyoung men of good family because it prevents intense absorption in\r\npolitics. The crime of the Stundists, Doukhobors, and Malevents consists\r\nin their wishing to be Christians in the spirit of Christ, and in being\r\ndisaffected towards that diabolical machine the Russian state. For this\r\nthey are persecuted in the name of Christ and of the state, but, as the\r\nabove-quoted figures show, without result. Sectarianism grows\r\ncontinuously. Thus Leo Tolstoï's religious anarchy is in a certain way\r\ncomprehensible. Whoever looks about him sees good people who, without\r\nmaking any disturbance, simply turn away from the state as something\r\nunchristian and inhuman; and he may easily fall into the delusion that\r\nit will some time be possible to found the kingdom of heaven upon the\r\nearth through the spreading of these teachings. Their rise, however, is\r\nonly too comprehensible in a state which has never pretended to\r\nrepresent the general welfare and justice--means by which even\r\nconscienceless conquerors and despots have spread civilization.\r\n\r\nAll these sects are limited to the peasantry. The sectarianism of the\r\ncities is called socialism. Here, too, one must use the word\r\n\"sectarianism.\" For even the little bands of organized labor split\r\nimmediately, after the Russian fashion, into smaller groups; and even\r\nthe intelligent upper classes form just as many little circles, each\r\nwith its own doctrine and its own organ. In spite of all efforts I did\r\nnot succeed in getting approximately reliable figures for the strength\r\nof the separate socialistic groups. The estimates varied from forty\r\nthousand to two hundred thousand, and are, therefore, entirely\r\nworthless. In regard to the nature of the groups, both in general and in\r\nparticular, there is much more definite information.\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination of the Czar Alexander II., which no one in\r\nRussia will believe was committed without the help of these groups, who\r\nknew definitely that the Emperor intended to sign an order for arrest,\r\nthe small and entirely isolated group of perhaps a hundred and fifty\r\ndesperadoes was simply exterminated, and several thousand people were\r\nexiled to Siberia. With that the so-called aggression of nihilism came\r\nto an end. Malicious persons, however, think it ended with the deed\r\nwhich was most in the interest of the omnipotent police--namely, the\r\nassassination of Alexander II. In any case, the police was not at all\r\nsevere in getting rid of this definitely recognized band. At that time\r\nthe doctrine of Marx was beginning to spread in Russia. This doctrine\r\nwas looked upon by the authorities as an antidote for the terrorism of\r\nanarchy. The Marxists, whose organ is the _Iskra_ (Ray, or Spark), are\r\ndoctrinaires here as everywhere, swear--at least so the Revisionists\r\ndeclare--by the theory that the poor are growing poorer, and wish the\r\npeasants to abandon their land and to become a wandering proletariat\r\naccording to the catechism of Marx. They were opposed by the late\r\nMikhailovski, who knew Russia better than the founders of the _Iskra_.\r\nTo-day the Marxists are supposed to be suppressed. Besides these there\r\nis the league with the two Parisian organs, the _Revolutionary Russia_,\r\na monthly printed in Russian, and the _Russian Tribune_, the real\r\nmonitor of the socialistic movement, and, next to Struve's\r\n_Oswobozhdenie_, the best source of information upon Russian conditions.\r\nThe leaguers are former followers of Lasalle. They are exceedingly\r\ntroublesome to the police on account of their close organization.\r\n\r\nFor a while the police cherished the hope of being able to seize the\r\nlabor movement for their own purposes. A certain Subatov invented a plan\r\nby which the police were to give financial support to the organization\r\nof labor, and in exchange to require the political good conduct of the\r\norganization. The industrial barons, however, at whose expense this\r\ntreaty of peace was to be brought about, put themselves on the\r\ndefensive. Gouyon in particular, a manufacturer of Moscow, who employs\r\nover five thousand persons, simply threatened to close his factory if\r\nthe inspectors were not withdrawn. So fell Subatov, leaving only his\r\nname behind to designate those who still put in a good word for police\r\nsocialism. They are called \"Subatovists.\" With this exception, no one\r\nhas thought of an honest factory inspection as an effectual help for the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic movement is seizing not only the working classes, but\r\nalso the universities, almost all of which to-day embrace a radicalism\r\ncertainly related to socialism. No sharp distinction can be made,\r\nindeed, between these two stages in the general dissatisfaction and\r\nfermentation. The police keeps its strictest guard upon the universities\r\nand all the thinking classes. In the province of Irkutsk there are at\r\npresent no fewer than three thousand political exiles. How many are\r\nlashed to death with knouts in police prisons no man knows. The answer,\r\nhowever, is found in those unplanned outrages which are beginning to\r\noccur again, and to which a governor or a minister falls victim, now in\r\none place, now in another. An outbreak of many of these is generally\r\nexpected in the near future.\r\n\r\nThere is still, however, a conservative element in Russia. I asked a\r\nwell-fed Russian tradesman, a representative \"kupetz\" (small dealer) of\r\nMoscow, what he thought about the war and the conditions in the country.\r\nHis answer was so characteristic that I must give it: \"It is not\r\nanybody's business to think, but to obey God and the Czar.\" The present\r\norder of things in Russia rests on this principle and on the stupidity\r\nof the half-savage Cossacks. Therefore, no one must be deceived by the\r\nsymptoms of bitter feeling. A revolution under organized leadership and\r\nwith a definite object is impossible. At the most, single nationalities\r\nand the starving peasantry may rise up, to suffer a sanguinary\r\noverthrow. Deliverance is not yet within sight for these most\r\nunfortunate of all men. National bankruptcy, which no one doubts is\r\nimminent, will perhaps bring an improvement. Therefore the Russians\r\npray, desirous to hasten it, \"God help us so that we may be defeated.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[11] A kind of Shakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nMOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nBlue heavens, golden cupolas, green towers, red houses, pealing bells\r\nabove, sleigh-bells on the streets, praying muzhiks before images of the\r\nsaints, beautiful women in costly furs--when I wish to reconstruct from\r\nmy recollections the picture of Moscow, these are the elements which at\r\nfirst mingle, charming, chaotic, like the colors in Caucasian\r\ngold-enamel. How beautiful a city this! How often have I stood upon the\r\ntower of the Ivan Veliky and looked down on this endless sea of shining\r\ncupolas and gay roofs crowded upon gently rising hills far into the blue\r\nhaze of the distance! Never was the Russian love of home so intelligible\r\nto me as there in the heart of Russia, upon the battlements of the\r\nKremlin, high above the bank of the Moskva! And involuntarily I\r\nwondered, as, indeed, would any one not a subject of the imperator, who\r\nhas looked down from such battlements upon all the subject masses of\r\nRussians, whether he has really subjugated them or whether they have\r\nonly been brought to a death-bringing hibernation. Æsthetic,\r\nethnological, historical, and political suggestions swarm to the mind\r\nof the thoughtful observer in this place. What wonder if the Russian\r\nfeels himself here on holy ground and would prefer to put off his shoes\r\nwhen he treads it?\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the people has a kindly word for St. Petersburg and a pet\r\nname for Moscow--\"Little Mother Moscow,\" it is called, the real capital\r\nof Russiandom. And even the stranger must remark this difference of\r\ntreatment. St. Petersburg astonishes, awes, frightens. Moscow\r\ningratiates herself at first sight and wins each day a firmer hold on\r\nour hearts. One thinks with a certain tenderness of one's stay in\r\nMoscow, and in spite of unbelief predicts to himself another visit. But\r\nnot with faith. For unless business calls him there he is not likely to\r\nmake a second visit to Moscow in a lifetime. But one longs to pass many\r\na pleasant day in this city, so curious and yet so homely, with her\r\nkindly inhabitants. Why? It would be hard to say in a few words. The\r\ncity is in too strong a contrast to the forced founding of St.\r\nPetersburg. There the hand of man is all in evidence; nothing is\r\nrefreshing. A great prison fortress of granite blocks surrounded by huts\r\nand barracks. Moscow is a product of nature, founded with enthusiasm by\r\nits dwellers in response to the open invitation of nature, and adored\r\neven with devotion. Even the stranger feels this, even though there is\r\nnothing to which he is unaccustomed except the devotion and tenderness\r\nof a people to whom he is bound by not a single tie of common\r\nassociation. With what shudders one wanders through Rome, from Mont\r\nPincio to the Vatican! how one is carried on by the ocean of world\r\nhistory upon the Capitoline, among the excavations of the Forum, among\r\nthe palace walls of the Palatine! What is to us, in contrast, the\r\nKremlin, this sanctuary of half-Asiatic barbarians? Yes, an exoteric\r\ndelicacy, nothing else! One cannot free one's self from the charm of\r\nthese places. Here a good-natured folk has created a jewel-box, gay and\r\ndazzlingly ornamented, careless of what the culture of the West has\r\ndeclared beautiful and holy; hither gravitate all the national feelings\r\nof a hundred million people; and, finally, all this is created to the\r\nharm of no one, to frighten no one, to oppress no one. Here the Czar is\r\nnot the general-in-chief of so many million bayonets, but \"Little Father\r\nCzar,\" who yields the countless holy images and chapels just the same\r\ndevotion as his lowest muzhik. And here is the past--not alone the\r\nbrazen, threatening present--the past of a strange people, but a people\r\nof lovable individuals, who, besides, are brought nearer to us than many\r\nof our nearest neighbors by a literature of unparalleled fidelity to\r\nlife. One must grow to love this childlike, slow-blooded, and yet\r\ncare-free people, with their irresistible heartiness. And he who has\r\nlearned to love the Russians must love their Little Mother Moscow, in\r\nspite of, or just on account of, her quietness.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Petersburg an express train brings us to Moscow in thirteen\r\nhours. It is always a night train that disposes of this traffic, for the\r\nRussian likes to sleep in his comfortable berth. And so we arrive in\r\nMoscow in the morning, ready at once to assimilate the first impressions\r\nof the enormous city. Our expectancy is great, of course. Moscow, the\r\nobject of all most Russian! It must differ, at first sight, from all we\r\nhave as yet seen. But while the hotel omnibus rattles through the\r\nstreets from the depot but little that is peculiar is to be seen. An\r\naffable fellow-passenger explains to us that that is only the foreign\r\nbusiness quarter. But now one after another the church cupolas appear,\r\none after another in increasing brightness and variety. At our \"Ah!\" in\r\nexpression of our satisfaction, we are instructed that we had better be\r\nmore sparing of that vowel sound or we might soon become hoarse. Moscow\r\nhas no less than four hundred and fifty such churches and twenty\r\ncloisters in addition. So let us be sparing. But the resolution is hard\r\nto keep. A long and mighty wall suddenly rises before us with countless\r\nangles, towers, and turrets. The wall is white, the towers are green,\r\nand through the gate we see long streets and buildings in all possible\r\ncolors, dark included. It is Kitay-Gorod, the inner city, with the\r\nbazars. Bokhara cannot appear more Asiatic. Now we feel already all that\r\nwe are about to see. A giant modern hotel almost destroys for us the\r\nensemble. Look quickly to your lodgings and then out again!\r\n\r\nWe are nicely located. From our windows we see the towers of the\r\nKremlin, which rise above the nearest roofs. Let him who will endure\r\nremaining behind double windows! After washing and having some tea we\r\nare at the door again, and quickly make a bargain with the \"izwozchik\"\r\nwho is to drive us over the outlined tour of the city. Horse and sleigh\r\nare a bit smaller than in St. Petersburg, but still very good. And so we\r\nare out in the sunshine, off into the snowy landscape, to gain a hurried\r\ngeneral conception of the endless city.\r\n\r\nFor two hours our good little horse draws us, gliding over bridges and\r\npikes, up and down hill, and when we return half frozen to the hotel we\r\nhave seen scarce a fraction of the periphery, but a thousand teams, with\r\nshaggy muzhiks in wicker sleighs, and, still more, little country-houses\r\nof wood, which might serve in the West for summer cottages, but which\r\noffer an inviting shelter even here in the icy winter. The whole of\r\nMoscow is a complex of official municipal buildings which are crowded\r\ntogether into the narrowest space, of churches and palaces narrowly\r\ncrowded about the Kremlin, and of immense suburbs which lie in rings\r\nabout the inner town. But these suburbs have a half-country\r\ncharacter--broad, uneven streets and low, villa-like houses, with little\r\ngardens. Little Mother Moscow gives her children room. They do not have\r\nto crowd together in usuriously paying tenements, and houses of more\r\nthan one story are quite the exception. Even in the shadow of the\r\nKremlin a parterre for the stores and a single story above it are\r\nsufficient. Really, only the hotels stretch with three or four stories\r\nheavenward. The impression is ever recurring that Moscow has no desire\r\nto be a city, and only quite unwillingly yields to the necessity of a\r\ncrowded existence.\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin, which we did not lose sight of once on our whole trip,\r\nentices us strongly. It lies before us; so let us enter.\r\n\r\nYes, if it were as easily done as said! We cross a broad square, across\r\nwhich lean little horses draw a horse-car high as the first story of a\r\nhouse, and then we stand before buildings which allow us to go no\r\nfarther. It is the Duma, the city hall, on the left, and the historical\r\nmuseum on the right, both dark-red in color; on the latter the façade is\r\nbuilt entirely of darkened stone, so that it gives the impression of the\r\nwhole being incrusted. The style is to be met with frequently. It\r\nbelongs to the sixteenth century and is now being revived. The idea of\r\nusing a coating of Russian enamel as an element of architectural style\r\nis a brilliant one. We reach a gate of the high wall surrounding the\r\ninner city Kitay-Gorod. But before we pass the gate let us cast a glance\r\nat the peculiar doings in the little chapel, scarcely bigger than a\r\nroom, which is built on its left side. It is the Iberian chapel, with\r\nthe famed image of the Virgin to which the Czar pays his devotions\r\nbefore he enters the Kremlin. The original, with its genuine precious\r\nstones, is now in the city, where for a fee it is brought to sick\r\npeople. In the mean time a copy takes its place. At the time of the\r\ndaily excursions of the Virgin the governor-general, Prince Sergius,\r\ndoes not allow the Jews to remain on the streets. The Blessed Virgin may\r\nnot see upon her way the traces of Jewish feet. Every one crosses\r\nhimself before her. But most climb the few steps to her and cross\r\nthemselves again, with deep bendings of the upper body; but some, men as\r\nwell as women, throw themselves full length upon the ground and touch\r\nthe earth with their foreheads. The candle trade flourishes; scarcely a\r\nsoul enters who does not buy a candle and light it before some image. No\r\ndifference of station can be recognized. The great lady, the high\r\nofficial, the dirty muzhik, all are the same in their worship. Their\r\ncaps are continually removed, and the rather time-consuming Russian\r\nceremony of making the sign of the cross is performed. But the really\r\npious ones do not content themselves with worshipping before the gate.\r\nThey do the same thing again when inside.\r\n\r\nWe reach, finally, the \"Red Square,\" so called because of the red\r\nKremlin wall and the red group of houses at the entrance. We notice\r\nagain that astonishment does not exactly make one brilliant. An \"Ah!\" in\r\nunison is all that escapes our lips. I believe that then I cried out\r\nwith enthusiasm, and I should have liked to take by the coat-lapels the\r\npeople who, used to the scene, were indifferently going their ways, and\r\nto say to them: \"Look, you barbarians! Do you not know what you have\r\nhere?\" Vasili Blazhenny (the Basilius Cathedral)! Many times as one may\r\nhave seen the curious bit of architecture depicted and dissected, yet\r\nwhen one finally stands before it and allows the gay towers, with their\r\ngreen, red, blue, and yellow cupolas to make their impression, he seems\r\nto have entered quite another world, which no longer has a single thing\r\nin common with our Western one. A sovereign, glorying fantasy has here\r\nbeen formed and created, apparently without rule, led only by the law of\r\nvariety; has made wings, doors, and windings, and in the narrowest space\r\nunfolded a richness which strikes us dumb, much as our feeling for style\r\nstruggles against the reversal of all our national laws. One's whole\r\narchitectural sense leans towards clear relationship of parts, towards\r\nrhythm and proportion; the artist of the Basilius Cathedral leans\r\ntowards intricacy, lack of rhythm, disproportion. He is a colorist, and\r\nbut a colorist, in contrast to our Renaissance artists, to whom the\r\ncolor seems almost an injury to the delicate line. And yet in all this\r\ngay confusion he has held fast to a fundamental feeling which in all the\r\nvariations keeps returning, as in a joint--yes, just as in the wildest\r\ndream some guiding idea like a red thread follows through it all. This\r\nmotive--I could not help always calling it to myself the Tschibuk\r\nmotive, after the winding, pearl-set tubes of a Turkish pipe--is\r\ncarried out with every possible Indian, Persian, and Roman ingredient,\r\nand still retains the characteristic Byzantine style. A person would\r\nshow great partiality to call this building a mad-house, as many an\r\nartist has done. One must only be able to free himself for an hour from\r\nthe dictator of the old taste in order to be able to comprehend the\r\ndelight of Ivan the Terrible at sight of this architectural orgy. (He\r\ngave expression to this delight by having the eyes of the architect put\r\nout in order that he might build no second masterpiece like it.) And\r\nthen again it must be confessed that the task of uniting in narrow space\r\nthirteen chapels with thirteen towers could not well have been solved in\r\nany other way than in this apparently most untrammelled, fantastic one.\r\nIf this proposition be accepted, the master of Vasili Blazhenny can only\r\nbe the object of wonder.\r\n\r\nNow Vasili Blazhenny is typical of all Moscow, the Kremlin included. It\r\nis the spirit of curious variety, of rich fantasy, the spirit of the\r\nSouth and the East which rules here. The snow one feels to be almost out\r\nof place, so Southern is the character of the city. The Kremlin, too,\r\nbefore which we now stand, is a \"free-act\" work of art, a piece\r\nsomething like the San Marco quarter in Venice, if one thinks of the sea\r\nas removed. For the Kremlin must not be thought of as a palace is; it is\r\na whole part of a city, surrounded by a wall twenty metres high, two\r\nkilometres long, enclosing an irregular pentagon. It lies on a rather\r\nsteeply rising hill on the bank of the Moskva, and commands the whole\r\nregion round about. Its beauty is not to be enjoyed in the interior of\r\nthe many churches, palaces, and barracks, although there is enough worth\r\nseeing there, too. It only opens up from the balcony of the Ivan Veliky\r\ntower, or from the bastion where the colossal monument of Alexander\r\nstands. But the most beautiful view of the whole complex is from the far\r\nbank of the Moskva, where the high wall, with its countless towers and\r\ncupolas, seems like the birth of an Oriental dream-fantasy. It shines\r\nand lightens in all colors, looks into the air, and speaks kindly\r\ngreetings to all below; one could simply sit and clap one's hands for\r\njoy. But to the Russian this little jewel-box is by no means a\r\nplaything. On the contrary, he very respectfully bares his head and\r\nceases not to cross himself. For \"above Moscow is only the Kremlin, and\r\nabove the Kremlin is only heaven.\" Within, however, the muzhik regains\r\nhis childlikeness, and when he stands before the enormous cannon--\"the\r\nCzar of Cannon,\" an old bronze gun--he invariably climbs upon the\r\npyramid of giant balls which stands before it, climbs aloft and gapes\r\ninto the yard-wide mouth of the gun. And under no circumstances does he\r\nneglect to creep into the hole of the \"Queen of the Bells,\" which is in\r\nfront of the Ivan Veliky, in which there is room for two hundred people.\r\n\r\nWe who are not childlike muzhiks may not allow ourselves such\r\ndiversions; we must conscientiously see all the wonders of this greatest\r\nof all rarities, a thing which will consume at least a day. We spare the\r\nreader our experiences. Even the treasure-chamber with the coronation\r\ninsignia and jewels big as one's fist cannot inveigle us into a\r\ndescription--all that could be seen in Berlin or Vienna.\r\n\r\nFinally, the wonderful beauty of the colossal Church of the Deliverer\r\nmust here be spoken of. The work is too unique in its nature to allow of\r\nbeing passed over in silence. The church is built apart, is visible\r\nafar, and forms the glorious completion of the Kremlin picture seen from\r\nthe Moskva. In its mighty height, with its colossal, gilded domes, of\r\nwhich the middle one measures thirty metres in diameter, it lightens\r\nlike a promise of the light the gay, romantic air of the Kremlin.\r\nFifty-eight high reliefs in marble ornament the façade, sixty windows\r\ngive bright light to the interior, colored still more golden by the\r\nlight of countless candles. The magnificence of the central nave,\r\nentirely of gold and marble, is simply overpowering, and the golden and\r\nsilver garments of the patriarchs would be quite unnecessary in giving\r\nus the strongest impression of the enormous riches of the Russian\r\nChurch. Together with the Cathedral of Isaac, in St. Petersburg, this\r\nchurch is well calculated to compete with St. Peter's, in Rome. But I\r\nbelieve that one should refrain from the comparison. The expression\r\n\"Roma tatae!\" comes from Madame de Staël, and was, within certain\r\nbounds, approved by Moltke, who would call Moscow a Russian Rome. But I\r\nmust, with all due modesty, demur. Too many undertones vibrate in our\r\nsouls at the word \"Rome\" to allow us to consider any sort of comparison.\r\nBut for a Russian? Who knows where the awe of eternity touches him\r\ndeeper, before St. Peter's or before this Church of the Deliverer?\r\n\r\nBut no, such a question may not be put. Muzhik and kupetz, farmer and\r\nsmall merchant, have absolutely no understanding of Rome--no beauty\r\nimpresses them, only the barbaric pomp with the costliness of the\r\nmaterials. But the cultured Russian feels just as we do, and will not\r\nseek the elements which make mighty the word \"Rome\" anywhere else on\r\nearth. And those that I spoke to in Moscow itself would have given a\r\ngood deal of the peculiarity of their country for a breath of European\r\natmosphere. Continuity between the time of Ivan the Terrible and the\r\npresent does not exist for these nobles, lawyers, and journalists of\r\nMoscow. They endure with polite but painful resignation our delight in\r\nthe fantasticness of their Kremlin, their churches and cloisters. It\r\ndoes not flatter them in the least that they are curiosities for Western\r\npeople, like the Baschkirs and Tatars, for instance; and they will not\r\nhear of their being condemned to continue a life in Russian style,\r\napart from Europe. This extreme enthusiasm for the autochthonous, which\r\nis often enough only an antiquated product of chance, is, after all, a\r\nromantic reaction and nothing else. It has long been proved that the\r\nGothic which awakened such exclusive enthusiasm in the days of the\r\nGermanic Romance is not Gothic at all, but French. And so Russia has no\r\nreason at all for considering her style, which is really Byzantine,\r\nall-sufficient. Byzantine, however, is the contrast to Europe, whose\r\npast has led by way of Rome and Wittenberg to the Paris of 1789. And so\r\nprogressive Moscow seeks freedom from Byzantium. While I was pretty\r\ndeeply imbued with things Russian, it was suggested to me to see a play\r\nin the \"Artists' Theatre,\" and then to say whether Moscow was really\r\nquite Russian and Asiatic. I followed this advice and had no reason to\r\nregret it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nMOSCOW--_CONTINUED_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were right in advising me to go to the theatre in order to correct\r\nmy impression that Moscow was a thorough-going Russian city. A hotel,\r\nfor instance, proves nothing at all concerning the character of a town.\r\nIt betrays at most the year of its erection, for to-day, the world over,\r\nbuilding is done in the recognized \"modern style.\"[12] Even this or that\r\nelegant street indicates nothing. There the imitation of patterns seen\r\nelsewhere plays too great a rôle. But the theatre which is to survive\r\nmust adapt itself to the ruling taste to such an extent that it can be\r\nconsidered really characteristic of it.\r\n\r\nNow the \"Artists' Theatre\"--or, as it is called because of the\r\n\"secessionistic\"[12] arrangement, the \"Decadent Theatre\"--of Moscow is\r\nreally unique, and by the preferences of the theatre public one can very\r\nwell recognize the quality and quantity of the intelligence of a city.\r\nWith respect to picturesqueness of staging, it is distinctly the\r\nsuperior of the Meininger Theatre; and, as far as scenery and purity of\r\nstyle are concerned, it can well compare with the most up-to-date\r\nstages. To be sure, inquiry should not be made into the distribution of\r\nthe individual rôles; to some extent this is worse than mediocre. I saw\r\n\"Julius Cæsar\" played where the conspirators seemed to feel it necessary\r\nto yell out their plans in the night with all their might. But, in\r\ncontrast to this, the palace of the emperor was represented with a\r\nfidelity which could not have been exceeded in Rome itself; and the same\r\nwith the Forum, and with the generals' tent at Philippi. The choruses\r\nwere simply captivating in their execution.\r\n\r\nBut more interesting to me than the play was the audience. And the\r\naudience, composed entirely of the educated middle class, knew quite as\r\nwell how to judge what was success and what failure in the performance\r\nas any of the better audiences of a Vienna or a Berlin theatre. And the\r\nfoyer, very appealingly decorated by the simplest artistic means with\r\nscenes from the history of the Russian drama and with many portraits of\r\nwriters and actors, was visited and enjoyed by the audience in the\r\nintermission. If I had not continually heard about me the sounds of a\r\nstrange speech, and had not seen here and there a Russian student\r\nuniform, it never would have occurred to me that I was in the very heart\r\nof Russia, so far as culture was concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was the same, too, in the families with which I spent my evenings.\r\nIf anything, only the heartiness with which one is received is\r\ngratefully at variance with our habits of careful reserve towards\r\nstrangers. But these hearty and hospitable people who at once lead us to\r\nthe samovar are by no means backwoodsmen, but are most intimately in\r\ntouch with all the advantages of the world, and they have uncommonly\r\nkeen powers of observation. The visiting European who might think\r\nhimself in a position to act among them would quickly become aware that\r\nthe Russian writers, who astonish us by their deep psychological\r\ninsight, have not picked up their art by the wayside. It is hidden in\r\nthe most charming little formalities, which in Moscow, in particular,\r\nsimply charmed me. Nowhere the slightest cant, nowhere the slightest\r\nfalse display, nowhere the forced enthusiasm for culture which makes\r\ncertain circles of our great cities so repulsive to us. Naturalness is\r\nthe pervading note in Moscow social life. But literary and art interests\r\nare a matter of course in a society which is scarcely paralleled by the\r\nEnglish in its demand for reviews. To-day, of course, every other\r\ninterest is forced to the wall by politics. I have been present at\r\ngatherings in the best circles of people of culture at which even the\r\nyoung had scarcely any interest save in political questions. Even little\r\ndeclamations with which the individual guests distinguished themselves\r\nwere spiced with political allusions, and were enjoyed by young and old\r\njust because of this spice.\r\n\r\nYet Moscowism has, in a sense, a bad reputation. It is held to be the\r\nembodiment of the Russian reaction against every attempt of a civilizing\r\nnature which emanates from St. Petersburg. Of the lesser citizens, or\r\nthe old-fashioned merchants at times, this may even to-day be true. The\r\nnobility in the Moscow government, however, the university, and the\r\nmembers of the few professions such as medicine and the law, are much\r\nless circumspect and free-minded in their political criticism than their\r\ncontemporaries in St. Petersburg, for instance. Such an opposition organ\r\nas the _Russkiya Vyedomosti_ does not exist in St. Petersburg. There is\r\nalso, to be sure, a sharp contrast between the intelligence of Moscow\r\nand that of official St. Petersburg; but this contrast is anything but\r\none between reaction and progress. It is worth while to examine it more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nThe present Russian régime has preserved only the despotism of the\r\nenlightened despotism of Peter; the enlightenment has vanished. The\r\nwisdom of the government consists solely in the obstruction of popular\r\neducation. The means to this end is the police, with their relentless\r\ncrusade against any intelligence of a trend not quite orthodox in its\r\nattitude towards the state and the ruling spirit of the old régime in\r\nthe corruption of all the elements of the higher strata of society.\r\nDemoralization is encouraged, so to say, by official circles. Just as\r\namong the peasants a man caught reading his Bible is held in suspicion,\r\nso in St. Petersburg a young man makes himself subject to the\r\ndispleasure of the authorities if he does not take his part in the\r\n\"diversions of youth.\" A lordly contempt for humanity is accordingly the\r\nprerequisite for every career in that Northern Paris. The pursuit of\r\nfortune has never a conscience, least of all where it appears in\r\nmilitary form. There _esprit de corps_ and dignity of position displace\r\nto a degree of absolute hostility all morality. Elegantly and\r\nfashionably clothed, one is always ready to wager one's life, or rather\r\nto throw it into the balance, for the most valueless stake. One is\r\nirreligious and anti-moral on principle, but of the strictest outward\r\northodoxy and monarchical to the very marrow.\r\n\r\nIt is to this anti-moral (anti-democratic) superficial\r\nsuperciliousness[13] that Moscow forms a contrast in each and every\r\nparticular. Here one is benevolent, democratic, hearty, and\r\nintentionally modest in appearance. Here, too, there appears to be less\r\nstruggling. The kupetz (small merchant) is rich as can be, but he\r\nlingers in his little store with narrow entrances, and never has a\r\nthought of laying aside his caftan, the ancestral overcoat, or his high\r\nboots, into which are stuffed the ends of his trousers. But it is not\r\nexactly this merchant whom I should like to cite as an example of my\r\npoint, for it is just he who has brought upon Moscow the reputation for\r\nbeing hostile to progress. But there is probably some connection between\r\nthe resistance which the nobility of Moscow offers to St. Petersburg\r\ncustoms and the obstinate self-sufficiency of the merchant with his\r\nold-fashioned views. Just as this kupetz does not allow himself to be\r\ndazzled by the elegant-looking clerk of the St. Petersburg merchant, but\r\nclings to his ancestral ways, so the Moscow nobleman is not dazzled by\r\nthe elegance of the dressy St. Petersburg officer of the guards. People\r\ndress elegantly in Moscow, too--yes, even in the Parisian style. But the\r\ncontemptible inhumanity of the struggling official of St. Petersburg\r\ndoes not appeal to the Moscowite as civilizational progress, but as a\r\nmetropolitan degeneracy to be despised. And so among the bright people\r\nof Moscow patriarchal heartiness is preserved. It was not a matter of\r\npure chance that Leo Tolstoï spent so many winters in Moscow society. In\r\nSt. Petersburg he would not have stayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful creation of this conscious devotion to Moscow is the\r\ndonation of a simple merchant, the possession of which any city of the\r\nworld might envy--the Tretyakov Gallery, the largest and most valuable\r\nprivate collection that exists anywhere. A knowledge of it is absolutely\r\nindispensable to the historian of modern Russian painting. The Alexander\r\nMuseum of St. Petersburg has isolated magnificent pieces of Ryepin,\r\nAiwasowsky, and the most beautiful sculptures of Antokolski; but it\r\ncannot be compared with the two thousand pieces of the Tretyakov\r\nGallery. The founder gave, besides this invaluable collection, a\r\nbuilding for it, and a fund, from the interest of which, even after his\r\ndeath, the collection might be augmented. Admission, of course, is free\r\nto all; even fees for coat checks may not be collected of its visitors.\r\n\r\nIn this gallery one realizes for the first time that Russian painting is\r\nabout at par with Russian literature, that it also has its Tolstoïs,\r\nTurgenyevs, and Dostoyevskys. Above all, there is Ilya Ryepin with a\r\nwhole collection of portraits and large genre pictures. I have tried to\r\nsketch some of those works of art elsewhere in a special article devoted\r\nto this greatest of Russian artists, and will not repeat myself here.\r\nLet me only mention the portraits of Leo Tolstoï, copies of which can\r\nnow be found in the West. The poet is here depicted once behind the\r\nplough and again barefoot in his garden, his hands in his belt, his head\r\nthoughtfully sunk upon his breast. It is the best picture of Tolstoï\r\nthat exists. Once, while I was walking up and down in conversation with\r\nthe poet in his room at Yasnaya Polyana, I had to bite my tongue in\r\norder to suppress the remark, \"Now you look as if you had been cut from\r\nthe canvas of Ryepin.\" Ryepin may be compared as a portrait-painter with\r\nthe very foremost artists of all times. The strength of his characters\r\nis simply unequalled.\r\n\r\nBut the Russians appear to me particularly great in the field of\r\nrealistic genre and of landscape painting, just as in their literature,\r\nwhich never leaves the firm ground of observation; and just for that\r\nreason it is perfectly unique in the catching of every little event, of\r\nevery feeling and atmosphere peculiar to the landscape. Among the\r\npainters of the last quarter of the nineteenth century who already have\r\nworked under Ryepin's influence, there is no longer any insidiousness of\r\ncoloring. Everything is seen clearly and strongly reproduced. No\r\nDüsseldorferie and no anecdote painting. Of course, they did not shun a\r\nsubject useful in itself, and they by no means avoid a slight political\r\ntendency. But they are no less artists because they disdain to beg of\r\nthe fanatics of \"art for art's sake\" the right to the name of artists by\r\nan exclusion of all but purely neutral subjects. On the contrary, in the\r\nnaïveté in which they show themselves in their art as human beings of\r\ntheir time, they let it be known that the problem \"art for art's sake\"\r\nis for them without any meaning, since with them it is an axiom that\r\nthey desire to influence only through the medium of their art; and yet\r\nthey judge every work of art first of all in accordance with its\r\nartistic qualities. Only they do not allow themselves by an apparently\r\nneutral, but in reality a reactionary, doctrine to be hindered from the\r\nexpression of their sympathy for everything liberal, free, and human.\r\n\r\nThere is, for instance, a picture there by Doroschenko which bears the\r\nharmless title \"Everywhere is life.\" It might, yes, it ought really to\r\nhang in the gallery of the Parisian, for it is a work of Christian\r\nspirit. Convicts are feeding doves from the railroad car which is\r\ncarrying them into exile. As a painting it is excellent. The light falls\r\nfull upon the whirring pigeons in the foreground and upon the convicts\r\npressing their faces against the iron bars of the window of the car. One\r\nsees through the window, and notices on the far side of the car another\r\nbarred window at which a man is standing and looking out. The interior\r\nof the car is almost dark. The group of convicts in the foreground\r\nconsists of a young man, evidently the guilty one, and his wife, who is\r\nfollowing him into exile with their year-old child on her bosom. For the\r\nsake of the child, and to please him, they are feeding the doves. A\r\nbearded old man looks on pleased, and a dark-bearded younger man, too,\r\nwhom one might sooner believe guilty of some slight misdeed. But upon\r\nthe face of all these exiles lies so childlike a brightness, so evident\r\na sympathetic pleasure in the joy of the child, that one rather doubts\r\ntheir guilt than the fact that they are still capable of good-natured\r\nhuman feelings. And yet this picture of Christian pity has not been\r\nbought for the Parisian. For it is well understood, in spite of its\r\nharmless title, what its meaning is. \"Everywhere is life\" should read,\r\n\"Everywhere is pity, everywhere humanity, except among the police, in\r\nthe state, and in an autocracy.\" What guilt can these good little folk\r\nhave committed--looking there so kindly at a child that cooingly feeds\r\nthe doves--that they should be torn from their native hearth and be sent\r\nto the icy deserts of Siberia? The young father--perhaps he went among\r\nthe people teaching that a farmer was a man as well as the policeman\r\n(pristav). And one thinks with a shudder of the two thousand political\r\nconvicts of the year before that were sent into the department of\r\nIrkutsk....\r\n\r\nSuch is the Russian genre. It is full of references, but is never a mere\r\nillustration of some tendency or other. The painter does not make the\r\nsolution of his problem easy, and does not speculate on the cooperative\r\ncomprehension of the observer, who is satisfied if he finds his thoughts\r\nindicated. No, such a Russian genre picture is perfect in the\r\ncharacteristic of the heads, in perspective, in the distribution of\r\nlight and atmosphere. The purely picturesque, to be sure, is more\r\nevident in the landscape. And in this the Russians do astonishing work.\r\nThey have the eye of the child of nature for the peculiarities of the\r\nlandscape--an eye which we in the West must train again. What west\r\nEuropean writer could have been in a position to write nature studies\r\nlike Leo Tolstoï's _Cossacks_, or like the \"Hay Harvest\" from _Anna\r\nKarenina_? And one might also ask, What west European has so studied the\r\nforest like Schischkin, the sea like Aiwasowsky, the river and the wind\r\nlike Levitan? There is a picture of Schischkin's in the Tretyakov\r\nGallery, \"Morning in the Pine Forest.\" A family of bears busy themselves\r\nabout an enormous fallen, splintered pine. Everything is alive; the\r\ncomical little brown fellows are quite as true to nature as the moss in\r\nthe foreground and the veil of mist before the trees in the background.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Schischkin is stronger in his etchings than in his\r\noil-paintings, the colors of which are always a little too dry. But his\r\netchings, which I could enjoy in their first prints, thanks to the\r\ngoodness of the senator Reutern in St. Petersburg, are real treasures in\r\nsentiment and character. He is, if one may express it so, the\r\npsychologist of the trees. A tree on the dunes is a whole tragedy from\r\nthe lives of the pines.\r\n\r\nAiwasowsky, the virtuoso of the troubled sea, is more effective than the\r\nquiet Schischkin. His storms at sea, with their transparent waves,\r\nactually drive terror into the onlooker. The Black Sea has been the\r\nfavorite object of his pictures. There all the furies seem to be let\r\nloose in order to frighten fisher and sailor. And these floods shine and\r\nshimmer; they are as if covered with a transparent light. Levitan,\r\nagain, has understood the charm of the calm surface of a small body of\r\nwater as no one else. His brush is dipped in feeling. The beauty of his\r\npictures cannot be reproduced in words. He seems to have a special\r\nsense-organ for the shades of the atmosphere. It is a pity that he died\r\nso very young.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Vereschtschagin has now obtained a particularly\r\nenhanced value because of the awful death of the master. The Tretyakov\r\nGallery has, with the exception of the Napoleonic pictures which\r\nornament the Alexander Museum, almost the whole life-work of the artist.\r\nHis work has only recently been universally appreciated. The power of\r\nthe versatile man was astonishing; his philanthropic turn of mind and\r\nhis epigrammatic spirit give spice to his pictures; but of him, first of\r\nall, perhaps, it might be said that he used his art for purposes foreign\r\nto it in spite of all artistic treatment. For it was seldom the artistic\r\nproblem that charmed him. Only his Oriental color studies are to a\r\ncertain extent free from ulterior purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to choose from this abundance of good masters, and\r\nparticularly to name those whom one should know above the others.\r\nPictures cannot easily be made so accessible as books, and the contents\r\nof a picture does not permit of being told at all. And so I content\r\nmyself with mentioning again the names of Ryepin, Schischkin, Levitan,\r\nand Aiwasowsky, and then those of the portrait-painter Kramskoi, the\r\nlandscape-painter Gay, and the master of genre painting, Makowski. And\r\nto any one whose path ever leads him to Moscow, a visit to the Tretyakov\r\nGallery is most urgently recommended. A people which produces such\r\nartists in every field as the Russian has not only the right to the\r\nstrongest self-consciousness, and to the general sympathy of people of\r\nculture, but, above all, it has the right to be respected by its rulers\r\nand not to be handled like a horde of slaves.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of it all, light has not dawned upon those in power. You\r\nmay resolve as often as you will in Russia not to bother, for the space\r\nof a day, with the everlasting police, but, in spite of all, you will be\r\ncontinually coming into contact with them. Our path from the Tretyakov\r\nGallery to the hotel leads past a long, barrack-like building. We ask\r\nour companion its object. He at once tells us something of interest.\r\nFirst, the giant building is the manége, the drill-room for the soldiers\r\nin bad weather. Its arched roof lies upon the walls without any interior\r\nsupport. The weight of the roof is so great that already the walls in\r\nmany places have sagged and have had to be reinforced. Architects had\r\nsuggested alterations, which, however, would have cost countless\r\nthousands. Such an expenditure could not be tolerated, and in the mean\r\ntime the evil increased. Already they were about to take a costly bite\r\nfrom the sour apple, when a small peasant appeared and promised for a\r\nhundred rubles to arrange matters in a single night. He simply bored, in\r\nthe top of the leaden roof, a hole, through which the air could\r\ncirculate, and immediately the roof lay like a feather upon the walls\r\nwithout endangering them any longer by its weight. Such is the story of\r\nthe Moskvich. Whether or not it is true, or is held to be so by people\r\nwho know about such things, I do not venture to judge. But it seemed to\r\nme interesting enough to be told. But what interested me still more was\r\nthe subsidiary use to which the building is put. It is near the\r\nuniversity. Now if a student disorder arises, they manage to surround\r\nthe students by Cossacks and drive them into this manége, where they are\r\nheld behind lock and key, by thousands, until the worshipful officials\r\nhave sought out those which may most to their purpose be called\r\nrevolutionists. Chance wills that generally the Jews are held, since\r\nHerr von Plehve needs statistical proof for his theory of a purely\r\nJewish opposition.\r\n\r\nHis accusations may have served him among those above him, but not among\r\nthose below him. I found that in Moscow itself dealings between the\r\nintelligent Christians and the few Jews who are allowed upon the street\r\nwere most hearty. The political bitterness, the desperate fight against\r\nthe régime, unites them all; after the Russian custom they exchange,\r\nembrace, and kiss at every meeting, Jew or Christian, provided they only\r\nbe friends. It was for me, a Westerner, an interesting and mortifying\r\nsight to see how young Russian nobles with world-famous names kissed on\r\nthe mouth and cheek in welcome and in farewell their Jewish friends.\r\nWith this impression I took my departure from Moscow. Terrible as the\r\npolitical pressure may be, the people have preserved one thing in this\r\nprison--their humanity. And thus they will one day attain happiness,\r\njust as they are in many things already happier than we, because they\r\nhave remained human. For a well-known authoress, who begged me to write\r\na few words in her album, I wrote the words which I shall here repeat,\r\nbecause they contain the sum of my Russian impressions, particularly\r\nafter the pleasing days in Moscow: \"Russia is a sack, but it is\r\ninhabited by human beings. The West is free, but it knows almost none\r\nbut business-men. I often almost believe that we ought to envy them....\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Referring to a modern independent art movement in Europe.\r\n\r\n[13] Ubermenschenthum.

The infallible _Baedeker_ advises the\r\ntraveller to leave the train there, because it is hard to get a team at\r\nthe next station, Kozlovka, though Kozlovka is nearer to Yasnaya\r\nPolyana, the estate of the poet, than is Tula. I follow my _Baedeker_\r\nblindly, because I have always had to repent when I departed from its\r\nadvice. The German _Baedeker_ deserves the highest credit for taking the\r\ntrouble to give this information to the few travellers that make the\r\npilgrimage to Leo Tolstoï. For it is not to be supposed that Tolstoï is\r\noverrun. His family guard his retirement, and do not grant admittance to\r\nevery one. I was, in fact, the only stranger who found his way there\r\nduring the entire week. It was, indeed, a very special introduction\r\nwhich opened the gates to me.\r\n\r\nThe train reaches Tula at eight in the morning. Thoughtful friends had\r\ngiven me a card in Russian to the station-master to help me to find a\r\ndriver who knew the way. The station-master could not, however,\r\ndecipher the card, and did not understand my French. A colonel of\r\nCossacks then helped me out. He had already been talking with the\r\nofficial, and now asked me if I could not speak German a little. When I\r\nassented he immediately played the interpreter. In a few minutes a\r\nmuzhik was found who, with his small sleigh and shaggy, big-boned pony,\r\nhad made the journey many times. The amiable Cossack then accepted an\r\ninvitation to breakfast in the clean station, and we chatted for a while\r\nover our tea. He was a tall, fair-haired man, with kindly blue eyes and\r\nthe short Slavonic nose. His conversation, however, emphatically\r\ncontradicted his appearance. He was on his way to the Ural, where he was\r\nto meet his regiment, and talked about the bayonets of his Cossacks\r\nbeing bent because the men spit the \"Kakamakis\" (Japanese) and threw\r\nthem over their shoulders. He was delighted that I was a German, for the\r\nRussians think the Germans very good fellows at present. Only the\r\nEnglish are a bad lot--\"Jew Englishmen!\" Leo Tolstoï, he said, was a man\r\nof great genius, but it wasn't nice that he was an atheist. I\r\ninterrupted him, laughing:\r\n\r\n\"I don't wish to be personal, colonel, but Leo Tolstoï is a much better\r\nChristian than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\nI explained to him that Tolstoï wishes to reestablish the primitive\r\nChristianity and is the enemy only of the church and of the priests. The\r\ngood fellow was immediately satisfied. If it were nothing worse than\r\nthat--no Russian could endure the priests. They were all rascals. The\r\nmissionaries in China had turned all their girls' schools into harems.\r\nOnly the dissenting priests led a moral life.\r\n\r\nIt was the talk of a big, thoroughly lovable child, in whom even the\r\nthirst for fighting was not unbecoming. Who knows whether the bullets of\r\nthe \"Kakamakis\" have not already found him out! I spoke later to the\r\ngood Tolstoï of this conversation. He also is persuaded that only right\r\nteaching is needed to turn these essentially good-hearted people from\r\nthe business of murder. At present war is merely a hunting adventure for\r\nthem. They form no conception of the sufferings of the defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeeply buried in furs and robes, we glided at last over the glittering\r\nsnow. The city of Tula, which would have been interesting at another\r\ntime on account of its metal industry, was a matter of indifference at\r\nthe moment. We quitted it on the left and struck at once into the road\r\nto Yasnaya Polyana. The distance before us was almost fifteen versts\r\n(ten miles); our pony had, therefore, to make good time if it was to\r\nbring us, over all the hills covered with soft snow, to our destination\r\nbefore noon. A Russian horse, however, can stand a good deal, so I did\r\nnot need to interrupt by inopportune consideration for animals the\r\nthoughts which surged through my brain more and more as we came near\r\nthe end of the journey. A meeting with Tolstoï is such an incomparable\r\nprivilege for me--will fate permit me thoroughly to enjoy the moments?\r\nAnd if he is not the man I expect to find, if one of the great again\r\nunmasks before me as a _poseur_--who appears great and admirable only at\r\na distance--how many illusions have I still to lose? May not his\r\napostleship be merely a self-suggested idea obstinately clung to? Is not\r\nhis tardy religious bent, perhaps, mere hypochondria, fear of the next\r\nworld, preparation for death? A look with his eyes must show me. I must\r\nlearn from the sound of his voice whether my inner ear deceives me when\r\nI hear the ring of sincerity in the primeval force of his diction. I\r\nknow I cannot deceive myself. If the concept I have formed of him is\r\ncorrected even in the least point by the reality, that is the end of my\r\nsecret worship.\r\n\r\nWe turned in at last between two stone pillars at the park of Yasnaya\r\nPolyana. Below, beside the frozen pond, we saw a youthful figure\r\nadvancing with the light step of an officer surrounded by a pack of\r\nbaying and leaping dogs. Yet, if my eyes did not deceive me, a gray\r\nbeard flowed over the breast of this slender, boyish figure. He stopped,\r\nshaded his eyes with his hand, and looked towards our sleigh. Then he\r\nturned back. It was he.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly reached the house and been unwrapped from our furs and\r\novershoes by the servants, when the door of the low vestibule opened,\r\nand there, in muzhik smock and fur, high boots and tall fur cap, as we\r\nknew him from a thousand pictures, Leo Tolstoï stood before us and held\r\nout a friendly hand.\r\n\r\nWhile he, motioning away the servants, pulled off his knee-high felt\r\novershoes, I had opportunity to look at him. That is to say, my eyes at\r\nfirst were held by the head alone, with its softly curling gray hair,\r\nwhich flows, parted, to the neck. Thick, bushy, gray brows shade the\r\ndeep-set, blue eyes and sharply define an angular, self-willed forehead.\r\nThe nose is strong, slender above, broad and finely modelled in the\r\nnostrils. The long, gray mustache completely covers the mobile mouth. A\r\nwaving white beard, parted in the middle, flows from the hoary cheeks to\r\nthe shoulders. The head is not broad--rather, it might be called\r\nnarrow--wholly unslavonic, and is well poised. The broad, strongly built\r\nshoulders have a military erectness. The powerful body is set on slender\r\nhips. A narrow foot is hidden in the high Russian boot and moves\r\nelastically. The step and carriage are youthful. An irony of fate will\r\nhave it that the bitterest foe of militarism betrays in his whole\r\nappearance the former officer. The man in the peasant's dress is in\r\nevery movement the _grand seigneur_.\r\n\r\nWe were still standing in the vestibule, which serves also as a\r\ncloak-room. The count thrust both hands in his belt--well-shaped,\r\npowerful hands--and asked in faultless German my plan for the day. I\r\nfelt the gentle eyes on my face as he spoke. The look is beaming and\r\nkindly. One is not pierced, only illuminated. Yet one feels distinctly\r\nthat nothing is hidden from those quiet, kindly eyes. I answered that I\r\nshould return to Moscow at midnight, and until then would under no\r\nconsideration disturb him in his work. He told me, thereupon, to send\r\nback my sleigh, since he would have us driven at night to the station in\r\nhis own. He would have no refusal to our eating breakfast before we\r\nwithdrew to the room assigned us. The countess, he said, was in Moscow\r\nat the time, but the youngest daughter would soon return from the\r\nvillage school, where she taught. He would leave her to entertain us\r\nuntil luncheon. I should say here that my wife accompanied me on this\r\nwintry journey, as on the whole journey of investigation. Tolstoï\r\nhimself would keep to his usual programme--would look over his mail,\r\nwrite a promised article, rest a little in the afternoon, then ride, and\r\nfrom dinner--that is, from six o'clock--until midnight would be at my\r\ndisposal. Then he led us to a large room on the first floor. Here stood\r\na long table, which remains spread all day. Tea and eggs were brought.\r\nBefore withdrawing, however, the count sat with us awhile, asked with\r\nthe tact of a man of the world about personal matters--the number of our\r\nchildren and how they were cared for in our absence, and the friends in\r\nMoscow who had introduced us to him--all in a low, musical voice which\r\nbanished all embarrassment. Then he rose with a slight bow and walked to\r\nhis room. At the door, however, he turned and came back to ask whether\r\nwe brought any news of the war. It was just in the pause after the first\r\ncatastrophe at Port Arthur. We were obliged, therefore, to say no. Then\r\nthe servant appeared and led us back to the ground floor, where we were\r\nshown into two connecting rooms. We had time to record our first\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nThe worst was over. There was no fear of disillusion. That was gone like\r\na cloud of smoke. The infinite kindliness of his eyes, the gentleness of\r\nhis hand-shake, the beauty of the silvery head exert a fascination.\r\nThere can be no doubt of his complete sincerity. The mind is filled with\r\nan entirely new feeling, that of astonishment at the unpretentious\r\npeacefulness of this fighter, who, from the stern seriousness of his\r\nlatest writings, and from his current portraits, might be taken for a\r\nphilosophizing pessimist. Whatever titanic thoughts may work in this\r\nhead, which looks like one of Michael Angelo's, all that is visible is a\r\nglow of serene and holy peace, which gently relaxes the tension of our\r\nown souls also. The ever-disturbing thought that we might find in the\r\ncount a recluse and an eccentric--if one may use such profane\r\nexpressions in connection with this illustrious man--a fanatic on the\r\nsubject of woollen underclothing and a return to nature in foods, was\r\nset at rest from the first moment of meeting. The count is no eccentric,\r\nbut a polished man in spite of the convenient dress of the muzhik. The\r\npeasant dress is simply the one that has proved best for his intercourse\r\nwith the country people. Moreover, there is a noticeable difference\r\nbetween the well-cut and well-fitting coat of Tolstoï and that of the\r\nragged peasant. I must confess that the setting at rest of even this\r\nlittle misgiving was of value to me. For, as people are in this world,\r\nthey will not take even a saint seriously if he wraps himself in\r\nexternal eccentricities--if he has not good taste. Leo Tolstoï decidedly\r\nhas good taste. Only he is great enough and strong enough not to submit\r\nto the tyranny of fashion. I should like, however, to see the man who\r\nfelt the least suggestion of worldly superiority in talking with him.\r\nTruly the count is not the man whom any fop in the consciousness of his\r\nEnglish tailor would presume to patronize. Perhaps, unconsciously to\r\nhimself, and certainly against his will, it is unmistakably to be seen\r\nin him that he once had the idea of being _comme il faut_, as he tells\r\nin his _Childhood and Youth_. However insignificant this circumstance\r\nmay be in the worldwide fame of Leo Tolstoï, it must be mentioned,\r\nsimply because the legend of the muzhik's smock may too easily create an\r\nentirely false impression of the personality of the poet. In spite of\r\nall the kindly simplicity of his bearing, no one can for a moment\r\nescape the impression that here speaks a distinguished man in every\r\nsense of the term.\r\n\r\nThe rooms allotted to us were parts of his large library. On a shelf I\r\nfound the carefully kept catalogue of the fourteen cases, with each book\r\non a separate slip. A glance through one of the glass doors showed me\r\nEnglish, French, German, and Russian books; my eye even fell on a Danish\r\ngrammar. There stood side by side a work on Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nBjörnson's _Über unsere Kraft_, Marcel Prévost's _Vierges Fortes_, Jules\r\nVerne's _Journey to the Centre of the Earth_, Spinoza, Renan, a book of\r\ntravel by Vámbéry, a book of entomology, Buffon--the most different\r\nsorts of books, and obviously much used. The count is able to accomplish\r\nsuch an achievement in reading only by a careful division of the day,\r\nnot to say a military exactness and thoroughness, pushed perhaps to\r\npedantry, in all his doings. Later, in speaking with me, he used the\r\nfamiliar phrase, \"Genius is eternal patience.\" He has this patience. It\r\nis well known how he works--that he has his first conception copied on\r\nthe type-writer, then corrected, then copied again, and so on until the\r\nwork satisfies him. On the day of my visit this man of seventy-five took\r\nan early morning walk of an hour and a half, looked over his large mail,\r\nwrote an English article upon the war, rode two full hours in the\r\nafternoon with the thermometer at six, worked again, and remained in\r\nalmost uninterrupted conversation with us from six o'clock until\r\nmidnight. He spoke German most of the time, rarely French. At the end of\r\nthe exceedingly intense conversation he was just as youthfully elastic\r\nas at the beginning; indeed, in the late night hours his eyes first\r\nbegan to glow with a light of inspiration which no one who has once seen\r\nit can ever forget. In addition to the great thoroughness of all his\r\naction and the strict division of the day, a vital energy which must be\r\ncalled truly phenomenal is also most essentially characteristic of his\r\npersonality. Leo Tolstoï is a giant in psychical and intellectual\r\nstrength, as he must once have been in physical strength also. It is not\r\npurely accidental that the two heroes in whom he has pictured himself\r\nmost unmistakably--Peter, in _War and Peace_, and Levin, in _Anna\r\nKarenina_--are large, strong men of unusual productive capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO TOLSTOÏ--_CONTINUED_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not yet noon when the door opened and a supple, laughing creature\r\nburst in like a whirlwind and ran up the stairs, filling the house with\r\nmusic. Soon afterwards the servant summoned us to luncheon. When we went\r\nup-stairs the laughing singer with the voice like a silver bell met us\r\nat the door of the dining-room. It was the Countess Alexandra Lvovna,\r\nor, as she is known in the house, Sasha, a blooming, beautiful blonde,\r\nwith her father's brows above great, wide-open, blue eyes. The Countess\r\nSasha does not speak German. She did the honors of the luncheon in the\r\nabsence of her father, who did not appear, since it is his custom not to\r\ninterrupt his work at this time. Therefore another inmate of the house\r\nwas present, a Circassian, a talented artist who had nursed the count in\r\nthe Crimea and since then has remained in the family. She makes herself\r\nuseful now by filing the count's correspondence. She speaks only\r\nRussian, however, so that she could take no part in the conversation.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we spoke only of the countess's father. His health the\r\npreceding year had been very weak from attacks of malaria and typhus,\r\nand even now the family were constantly anxious about him. For he does\r\nnot spare himself in the least, and will not take his advanced years\r\ninto consideration at all. For twenty years he has not eaten a morsel of\r\nmeat. What appeared to be cutlets, which I saw him eat later, were made\r\nof baked rice. I cautiously led the conversation to a former inmate of\r\nthe house, who, in an indiscreet book upon the family of the count, made\r\nthe assertion that the count was only nominally a vegetarian, but\r\noccasionally made up for his abstinence by secretly eating tender\r\nbeefsteaks. It would mean nothing in and of itself if a habitual\r\nmeat-eater, after going over to vegetarianism in a general way, should\r\nnow and then indulge the craving for meat. The secrecy of the\r\nindulgence, however, would be a piece of that hypocrisy of which the\r\ncount is accused by his most obstinate enemies. We received from the\r\ncountess, however, an explanation of the circumstances in regard to the\r\nGerman woman's book. Since the Tolstoï family, however, have long since\r\npardoned the repentant authoress, it would be indelicate of me to\r\npublish the ancient history. Leo Tolstoï is no hypocrite. He does not\r\neven consider it a duty to be a vegetarian. All the rest of his family,\r\nincluding the Countess Sasha, eat meat. Tolstoï finds, however, that a\r\nvegetable diet agrees with him, and he therefore adheres to it without\r\nwishing to convert anybody else to the same belief, as vegetarians are\r\naccustomed to do. The count, in general, does not try to make any\r\nconverts, brings no pressure to bear on any one. Everybody may live\r\nexactly as he chooses, even in the bosom of the count's family. The\r\nCountess Sasha said, touchingly, \"The only thing we can learn from him\r\nis whether a thing pleases him or not. That is enough, however, at least\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more touching than the relations between this last\r\nchild remaining at home and her father. She hangs on his words. Every\r\nwish of his, spoken half aloud, is quickly and silently fulfilled by\r\nher. Since the marriage of the Countess Tatyana she has been his\r\nsecretary, and her white hands operate the typewriter like those of the\r\noldest amanuensis. She trills a little French song at the same time, and\r\nblushes to the neck when any one catches her at it and speaks of her\r\nsweet voice and accurate ear. Work for her father is a higher\r\nsatisfaction to her. She subordinates herself completely to his\r\nthoughts. She used to be, like every one else, a lover of Shakespeare,\r\nbut since she copied the latest work of her father upon, or rather\r\nagainst, Shakespeare, she has been convinced and converted by his\r\narguments. She said this without any affectation, with the sincerity of\r\na child. It is to be seen that the deep tenderness of her love for her\r\nfather springs from her care of him. She trembles for him. Perhaps she\r\nexerts herself, too, to replace all the brothers and sisters who have\r\ngone out from the home. Of nine living children--there were originally\r\nthirteen--she is the last. It is easy to see, too, how much the careful\r\nprecautions of this daughter please the count. When his eyes rest on her\r\nface, beautiful with the distinction of race and maidenhood, it is as if\r\na ray of light passed over his face. He does this, however, as if by\r\nstealth. His love is shy, as is hers.\r\n\r\nSoon after luncheon the count sent me an invitation to join him. He had\r\npaused in his work to eat a few mouthfuls. Meanwhile we might chat. We\r\nagain sat at the same table. The talk turned on the war, against which\r\nthe count was just writing an article. He made the observation that the\r\nright-minded Russian was in a remarkable position. He contradicted all\r\nhuman feelings in wishing a defeat for his own nation. The bitterest\r\nmisfortune that Russia could meet, however, would be the continuance of\r\nthe present criminal régime, which demands so many victims, inflicts so\r\nmuch suffering upon Russia, and which, in case of victory, would only be\r\nstrengthened. Quite recently he had received a letter from a highly\r\ngifted writer, a certain Semionov, whom he himself had discovered and\r\ntaught. Semionov, a peasant, had been a janitor in Moscow, but on\r\nTolstoï's advice had returned to his father, and had written a little\r\nvolume of stories, which Tolstoï rates higher than those of Gorki. Now\r\nthe gendarmes have confiscated everything he has, and, if I am not\r\nmistaken, have even arrested the writer. The pressure, the count says,\r\nis unendurable. I told him of my meeting with the Cossack colonel in\r\nTula and of the hotel servants in Moscow, who one and all wished to go\r\nto the scene of war for the sake of plunder. \"Certainly,\" answered the\r\ncount. \"The soldier must rejoice over every war, for war gives him for\r\nthe first time a kind of title to existence in his own eyes. As to these\r\nhouse-servants and waiters, however, who are so ready to take part in\r\nthe war, their love of fighting is nothing but common love of stealing.\r\nThe Europeans have rioted and plundered shamefully in China. The people\r\nof the lower classes suffer from these things, and thus all their evil\r\ninstincts are awakened.\"\r\n\r\nI told the count of the officially arranged patriotic demonstrations in\r\nSt. Petersburg, of which I had been a witness, and in which alcohol had\r\nplayed its part.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, intoxication!\" said the count; \"they need that to make people\r\nforget that killing, robbery, and plunder are sins. If people only came\r\nto their senses they could no longer do these things; for nineteen\r\nhundred years of Christianity, however falsified, leave their trail in\r\nthe consciousness of man, and make it impossible for him to rage like\r\nthe heathen. But everything is done to suppress religion. Our upper\r\nclasses have already completely lost religious consciousness. They\r\neither say 'Away with this nonsense!' and become gross materialists, or\r\nthey remain orthodox and do not themselves know what they\r\nbelieve--stupid stuff about the world's being created in six days and\r\nlasting only six thousand years. This trash, which is taught the people\r\nas religion--that is to say, belief in the schools--is just as much a\r\nmeans of hindering religion as a superficial knowledge of science. Yet\r\nreligion alone can free us from our evils, from war and violence, and\r\nbring men together again. Religion is at present in a latent condition\r\nin every one, and needs only to be developed. And this religion is the\r\nsame for all, for the native religious consciousness is quite the same\r\nin all men. But the churches prevent this unity, and bury this religious\r\nconsciousness under forms and dogmas which produce a sort of\r\nstupefaction instead of satisfying the religious hunger.\"\r\n\r\nI repeated the amusing remark of the Cossack colonel of Tula, that\r\nTolstoï was a great man, only that it was a pity that he was an atheist.\r\n\r\nThe poet laughed, with something like pain in the laugh.\r\n\r\n\"There is always a certain amount of truth in which people believe, only\r\nit is misunderstood. To that good Cossack faith and orthodoxy are\r\nidentical. My own sister, who is in a convent, laments that her brother\r\nasserts that the Gospel is the worst book that has ever been written.\r\nThe truth is that I made this assertion about the legends of the saints,\r\nbut it is misquoted. The authorities know what I think of the Gospel.\r\nThey have even struck out of the Sermon on the Mount two verses which I\r\nput into an alphabet for the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who struck them out?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The censor, to be sure. An orthodox Christian censorship strikes out of\r\nthe Sermon on the Mount two verses which do not suit it. This is called\r\nChristianity.\"\r\n\r\nThe authorities give the Tolstoï family the greatest difficulty in its\r\nwork of educating the people. The village school was suppressed, because\r\nreading and writing were taught there and not orthodoxy. The instruction\r\nwhich the Countess Sasha now gives is quite unsystematic. Five children\r\ncome to her at the old manor, and are taught the black arts of reading,\r\nwriting, arithmetic, and manual training, in constant danger that some\r\nhigh authority will interfere to ward off this injury to the state.\r\n\r\n\"It is quite probable that we shall all be officially disciplined when\r\nmy father is no longer living,\" the Countess Sasha said to us, with that\r\ncalmness with which every one in Russia sacrifices himself to his\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing pastoral, likewise nothing exalted, in Tolstoï's\r\nmanner during this conversation. After finishing his luncheon he rose\r\nand walked up and down the long dining-room with me, both hands in his\r\nbelt, as he is painted by Ryepin. He spoke conversationally, with no\r\nespecial emphasis on any word, as to one whom there is no need of\r\nconvincing. It was the afternoon conversation of an intelligent country\r\ngentleman with his guest--the easy, matter-of-course talking in a minute\r\nof resting--talk that is not meant to go deep or to philosophize. To me\r\nit proved only the lively interest taken by Tolstoï in all the events of\r\nthe day. He was not at all the hermit, merely preparing himself by holy\r\ndeeds for heavenly glory, but an alert, vigorous, elderly man who\r\nwatches events without eagerness or passion, yet with sufficient\r\nsympathy--an apostle unanointed, literally or figuratively.\r\n\r\nA half-hour's siesta was a necessity after the night spent in travel and\r\nthe excitements of the morning. We rested, as did the whole house, in\r\nwhich at this time there was scarcely a sound. I do not know whether\r\nsuch stillness reigns in summer in the park, which now lay buried deep\r\nin snow. The house is very quiet now because it has become too large for\r\nthe remaining occupants. A whole suite of simply furnished rooms on the\r\nground floor stands entirely empty, and is awakened to life only when\r\nthe married children come to visit. In the first floor, also, where the\r\nstudy and reception-room are, everything has become too large. After we\r\nhad settled for our nap we heard only the click of the typewriter, on\r\nwhich the Countess Sasha was copying the manuscript her father had\r\nwritten in the morning, and the low song with which she accompanied her\r\nwork. Then the house awoke again. The count was about to take his ride.\r\nA fine black horse was led to the door, and the old count descended the\r\nstairs with his light, quick step. He now had the Russian shawl around\r\nhis neck and a broad woollen scarf belted about his body. He drew on his\r\nhigh felt overshoes and thick mittens, put the lambskin cap on his head,\r\nseized his riding-whip, and went out. A strange muzhik was waiting for\r\nhim before the door. He had come from a distance to lay his case before\r\nthe count. Tolstoï listened to him, questioned him, and then called the\r\nservant. As he was not at hand, the count asked me to tell him to give\r\nthe muzhik some money. Then a foot in the stirrup, and, with the swing\r\nof a youth, the man of seventy-five seated himself in the saddle. It is\r\neasy to see, even now, that he must once have been a notable horseman\r\nand athlete. For, though strength of passion abates in an elderly man,\r\nhe who has once had muscular training does not lose the effects of it.\r\n\r\nWith a nod of the head the rider rapidly disappeared in the lane that\r\nleads to the main road. It was already growing dark when he returned,\r\nchilled through, and now noticeably altered. The cold had pinched his\r\nface; his eyelids were slightly reddened; eyebrows, mustache, and beard\r\nwere thickly frosted. The change was only superficial, however. An hour\r\nlater he was more fresh and vigorous than before, held himself erect,\r\nand spoke with ever-increasing animation.\r\n\r\nWe, however, spent the afternoon in a walk in the village with the\r\nCountess Sasha. We had accepted her invitation with pleasure. She now\r\nappeared, humming, in a lively mood, slipped on a light gray Circassian\r\nmantle and her little high overshoes, wound a long, red scarf about her,\r\nand put a gray Circassian cap on her thick hair. Nothing was ever more\r\nbeautiful than this creature, so full of health and strength. She took a\r\nstout stick from the wall for protection from dogs, and then led us out\r\ninto the deep snow, in which only a narrow path was trodden.\r\n\r\nEven the deepest reverence does not require uncritical adoration.\r\nMoreover, Tolstoï is of such phenomenal importance for us all that the\r\nnarrator who can communicate his own perceptions is bound to reproduce\r\nthem with the most absolute fidelity. Therefore, I believe I ought not\r\nto conceal the thoughts which refused to leave me during the walk\r\nthrough this village. I had to admire once more the deep humanity of the\r\nTolstoïs when I saw the Countess Sasha, in her beauty and purity, go\r\ninto the damp, dirty hovels of the peasants, and caress the ragged and\r\nfilthy children, just as Katyusha, in _The Resurrection_, kissed a\r\ndeformed beggar on the mouth in Easter greeting after the Easter mass.\r\nThis absolute Christian brotherliness receives expression also in the\r\nwhole attitude of the family. Countess Sasha says, quite in the spirit\r\nof her father: \"The industrious peasant stands much higher morally than\r\nwe who own the land and do not work it. Otherwise he differs in no way\r\nfrom us in his virtues and vices.\" This brotherliness, however, has this\r\nshortcoming, that it leaves the brother where it finds him, and does not\r\ncompel him to conform to different and more refined ways of living. The\r\nTolstoï family teaches the village children. It has established a little\r\nclinic in the village. But it does not make its influence felt in\r\nteaching the villagers personal cleanliness, taking, say, the German\r\ncolonists in the south as a model. I cannot conceive of the peasants of\r\nYasnaya Polyana looking as they would if the landlord were an English or\r\nDutch philanthropist instead of a Russian; and I cannot believe, either,\r\nthat the simplicity of manners or the warmth of brotherly love would\r\nsuffer if the village looked, for instance, like those of the Moravians,\r\nwhich shine with cleanliness. To be sure, the count refrains from any\r\npressure on the people about him, and if his muzhik feels better\r\nunwashed, as his fathers were before him, and prefers a dirty, unaired\r\nroom, shared with the dear cattle, to one in which he would have to take\r\noff his shoes to prevent soiling the floor, the count will not exhort\r\nhim to change into a Swabian or a Dutchman. Æsthetic demands do not form\r\nany part of the Tolstoï view of life--I believe that for this reason it\r\nwill find slow acceptance in the West.\r\n\r\nThere is the meekness and \"lowliness\" of early Christianity, there is\r\nan anti-Hellenic principle in the village dirt of Yasnaya Polyana. It is\r\ntrue that Hellenism leads in its final outcome to the abominable\r\n\"Herrenmenschenthüm\"[14] of Nietzsche, to Nero's hatred of the \"many too\r\nmany.\" A predominant æsthetic valuation of the good things of life leads\r\nin a negative way to the immoral in conduct. Every final consequence,\r\nhowever--that is, every extreme--is absurd; even absolute spirituality,\r\nindifferent to all outward things, as well as the heartless cult of mere\r\nexternal beauty. If we may learn from the muzhik patience in misfortune,\r\nwe have also something to offer him in return for this in ideas of how\r\nto care for the body and of æsthetically refined ways of living. But Leo\r\nTolstoï is an enemy of all compromise, and perhaps must be so. If the\r\nimpulse towards the spiritualizing of our life, towards brotherly\r\nkindness and holiness, which goes out from him, is to work in its full\r\nforce, it must be free from any foreign admixture, at least in him, its\r\nsource. In the actual world counteracting forces are not wanting,\r\nmoreover, and in some way the balance is always struck. The synthesis of\r\nNietzsche and Tolstoï is really not so very hard to find. It was given\r\nlong ago in the \"kaho-kayadin\" (beauty and goodness) of the ancients as\r\nwell as in the rightly understood conception of the gentleman. If\r\nTolstoï's human ideal wears the form of the muzhik and flatly rejects\r\nevery concession to the claims of an æsthetic culture, the fact leads\r\nback ultimately to the repulsion which the St. Petersburg type of\r\ncivilization must awaken in every unspoiled mind. One perceives there\r\nthat luxury cannot uplift man. Indeed, it is easy to come to the Tolstoï\r\nconviction that it ruins instead of ennobling him. An isolated thinker\r\nlike Tolstoï reaches in this revulsion very extreme consequences. In any\r\ncase the bodily uncleanness of the peasants is less unpleasant to him\r\nand his daughter than the moral impurity of the town dwellers. The dirt\r\nof the peasants is for him nature, like the clinging clay of the field.\r\n\r\nSuppressing our thoughts, we followed our brave guide into the houses of\r\nthe village. With a few blows of her stick she put to flight the\r\nsnarling curs that stood in her way. In the first house there was great\r\nwretchedness. The muzhik lay sick on the oven, beside him a stunted,\r\nhunchback child. The wife sat at the loom, surrounded by a heap of other\r\nchildren, flaxen-haired and unspeakably filthy. Half a dozen lambs\r\nshared the room and its frightful air with the peasants, sick and well.\r\nThe young countess had a friendly word for each. One of the children was\r\na pupil of hers, and was at that very time working at her writing\r\nlesson. This, of course, was praised. There was, however, something\r\nobsequiously cringing about the peasant woman I did not like. It was\r\nall quite different in the next house, which belonged to a rich muzhik.\r\nHe likewise lay on the oven. The room was lighter, thanks to a larger\r\nwindow, but the floor was equally dirty, and the inevitable lambs were\r\npushing each other about in the straw in the same way. At our entrance\r\nthe muzhik awoke and got up. His mighty brown beard almost covered his\r\nbreast, which showed through his open shirt, and was covered with a\r\nthick crust. This peasant, however, read the paper, spoke of the war,\r\nand put a very interesting question. A little while before the Countess\r\nSasha had been at his house with Bryan, who had visited her father. The\r\nmuzhik and his visitor had become rather friendly. Now the muzhik read\r\nin the paper that the Americans are enemies of Russia. How about his\r\nfriend Bryan? The countess, therefore, had to tell him whether Bryan had\r\nnow become his personal enemy. She reassured him, laughing. The peasant\r\nwoman accompanied us out of the house, and made the characteristic\r\nspeech: \"I am ashamed; we live here like pigs; but what is any one to\r\ndo? We are so, and can't help it!\"\r\n\r\nIn the same house is the little village hospital, which for the present\r\nis only a movable affair. This is kept really clean. The amount of\r\nillness is large. The peasants from the surrounding country come also,\r\nand the doctor often has to treat forty patients in a single office\r\nhour. He is said to be an able man and a good one--a matter of course\r\nin Tolstoï's vicinity. Whether one wishes it or not, one is drawn out\r\nhere in the atmosphere of pure kindliness. When I came back from the\r\nvillage I was almost ashamed that I had held my breath in the peasant's\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[14] The theory that the elect few alone deserve to live and that the\r\nmasses are superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO TOLSTOÏ--_CONTINUED_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock we were summoned to dinner, at which the count appeared.\r\nAs entrée there were baked fish--for the count, rice cutlets--then a\r\nroast and vegetables, of which the count took only the latter; then\r\ndessert and black coffee. We drank kvass, later tea, with cakes.\r\nEverything was very well prepared. A man-servant waited at table. It is\r\nby no means petty to tell all this. The Tolstoïs do not live on locusts\r\nand wild honey, but like other good families in Russia. We have, thank\r\nHeaven, outgrown the days when genius had to assert itself by\r\nextravagant conduct. Brilliant originality is entirely compatible with\r\nconformity to custom in all every-day usages, according to our way of\r\nthinking. Conversely, all originality immediately becomes suspicious in\r\nour eyes when it labors to assert itself in trifles. \"A wise man behaves\r\nlike other people.\" The individuality of Tolstoï shows in no way the\r\nstamp of the idle wish to differentiate itself in each and every\r\nparticular from other people.\r\n\r\nNo one will expect me to reproduce every detail of the conversation,\r\nwhich began at dinner and ended almost six hours later at the house\r\ndoor. I certainly have not forgotten a word of it, but I cannot answer\r\nfor the order of succession of subjects, nor even for every expression\r\nand every turn of speech. I therefore reconstruct from memory only what\r\nseems to me the most important, and ask every indulgence for this\r\nreport. It is as faithful as is possible to human inadequacy after such\r\nfatigues and excitements, and with rather tardy notes.\r\n\r\n\"I am now under the influence of two Germans,\" began the count. \"I am\r\nreading Kant and Lichtenberg--selections, to be sure, for I do not\r\npossess an original edition. I am fascinated by the clearness and grace\r\nof their style, and in particular by Lichtenberg's keen wit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goethe says, 'When Lichtenberg makes a jest, a whole system is hidden\r\nbehind it,'\" I threw in.\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand how the Germans of to-day can so neglect their\r\nwriter and go so mad over a coquettish feuilletonist like Nietzsche. He\r\nis no philosopher, and has no honest purpose of seeking and speaking the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he has an unprecedented polish of style, and an endless amount of\r\ntemperament.\"\r\n\r\n\"Schopenhauer seems to me greater as a stylist. Still, I agree with you\r\nthat he has a glittering polish, though it is only the facile grace of\r\nthe feuilletonist, which does not entitle him to a place among the great\r\nthinkers and teachers of humanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"He flatters, however, the aristocratic instincts of the new-Germans,\r\nwho have attained power and honor, and he works against the evils of\r\nsocialism.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the condition of socialism in Germany?\" asked the count,\r\nimmediately, with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"I fear it has lost in depth and strength what it has gained in\r\nbreadth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right,\" he answered. \"I have the same impression. The belief\r\nin its invincibility is broken, and its internal strength of conviction\r\nbegins to weaken. It had to be so. Socialism cannot free humanity. No\r\nsystem and no doctrine can do that--nothing but religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Church says that, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she teaches it falsely. What is religion? The striving of each\r\nindividual soul towards perfection; the subordination to an ideal. As\r\nlong as a man has that he feels a purpose in life, can endure all\r\nsufferings, and is capable of any strain. It does not need necessarily\r\nto be a lofty ideal. A man may have an ambition to develop his biceps to\r\nan uncommon degree. If he takes this as his particular purpose in life\r\nthis aim carries him along completely. To be sure, a man's choice of an\r\nideal can be only apparently capricious. In reality we are all products\r\nof our environment; and after nineteen hundred years of Christianity we\r\ncannot with any true conviction set up ideals which contradict the real\r\nChristianity. We can make ourselves believe something else for a while.\r\nBut the conscience will not submit to be silenced. Peace is attained\r\nonly by the religious ideal of perfection and of love of humanity.\r\nNothing is deadly except cynicism and nihilism.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember your metaphor, comparing a society without religion or moral\r\nenthusiasm to an orchestra that has lost its leader. It keeps in time\r\nfor a while, then come the discords.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are now in the first measure after his departure. All will go well\r\nfor a while, but then every one will get out of time; the leaders first,\r\nbecause they are most exposed to temptation; then, class by class, the\r\nlower ones also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe a state is like a magnet, in which every smallest particle\r\nmust have its direction, or else the whole loses its strength and\r\ncohesion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. A state or a society, like the individual, is fit for life\r\nonly so long as it feels as a whole a reason for being. This life\r\nprinciple of totality is, however, identical with the idea of the\r\nindividual. It is the stream that encircles each particle and brings it\r\ninto polarity.\"\r\n\r\n\"People try to reach it by the ideal of nationalism and patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no ideal. It is an absurd idea, which immediately comes into\r\nirreconcilable conflict with our better feelings. An ideal that can and\r\ndoes require me to kill my neighbor in order to gain an advantage for\r\nthe group to which I belong is criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet it is dangerous to stand out against it. You had a controversy on\r\nthat point with Spielhagen, who cast it up to you that you incline\r\npeople to fling themselves under the wheels of a flying express-train.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember. But Spielhagen does not know how many people already comply\r\nwith the requirements of the gospel. The Doukhobors are such people.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they were obliged to leave the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference does that make? They were able to remain true to\r\nthemselves. That is better than remaining at home. And when we have once\r\nchanged education, and have taken the sinful glorification of deeds of\r\nmurder out of the hands of our children, then there will be not merely\r\nthousands, but millions, who will refuse to sacrifice themselves, or\r\nhave themselves murdered for the ambition or the material advantage of a\r\nfew individuals. And then this chapter of world-history will end.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the school is a matter of politics, and the state or the\r\ninfluential classes will be careful not to permit an education that will\r\nmake their lower classes unavailable for purposes of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. And as long as there is a church which by its fundamental\r\nteaching delivers itself over as an assistant to the state, and which\r\nblesses weapons of murder, so long will it be hard to fight against the\r\nevil instincts thus aroused. But school, of course, does not end man's\r\neducation. Later reading is much more important. We have, therefore,\r\ncreated something that might well be imitated abroad also, our\r\n'Posrednik,' books for the people. The thing that suppresses bad reading\r\namong the people is good books, especially stories. The books are sold\r\nvery cheaply. Our artists design frontispieces for them. You must look\r\nat them in Moscow. I will give you a letter to the publisher, my friend\r\nIvan Ivanovitch Gorbunov, who can tell you the details.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so. With his kind letter I afterwards looked up Gorbunov in\r\nMoscow. Under the pressure of the Russian censorship he accomplishes the\r\nimmense work of spreading among the people every year several million\r\ngood books at a cost of a few kopeks each, without having needed to add\r\nto his original capital of thirty thousand rubles. I fulfil a duty, and\r\nat the same time a wish of Tolstoï's, in here calling attention most\r\nemphatically to this magnificent Russian enterprise, which should be an\r\nexample for all other nations.\r\n\r\nI took up the subject of socialism again, and said, \"In the West, Social\r\nDemocracy is trying to solve the problem of educating the masses and to\r\nemancipate them.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is certainly meritorious,\" replied the count. \"The mistake lies in\r\nthe teaching of the Social Democrats that some other organization of\r\nsociety will automatically abolish evil from the world. The principal\r\nthing, however, is always to raise the individual to better morals and\r\nbetter ways of thinking. Without this no system can be permanent. Each\r\nleads only to new violence. People ought not to wish to better the\r\nworld, but to better themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that you agree essentially with our Moderns, who likewise take a\r\nstand against socialism and preach an extreme individualism. I see in\r\nthat only a reactionary manoeuvre, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" asked the count.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that all wars for culture are always fought in a small class\r\nof thinking people. For the masses, provision for material needs is\r\nreally the principal thing. In the thinking class, however, there are\r\ntwo parties: one, consisting of the feudalists, the plutocrats, and\r\nuniversity-bred business men, fortune-hunters, seeks for itself the\r\nprivilege of exploiting others; the other consists of the idealists, who\r\ndesire progress--that is, the education and freeing of the masses.\r\nSometimes the one class, with its aristocratic philosophy of profit,\r\nwins the upper hand, sometimes the other. We do not yet know in what\r\nHellenic or Sidonian laws the spiritual ebb and flow will find its\r\nconsummation. It is certain, however, that each party uses as a means of\r\nattraction the declaration that its point of view is the more\r\nprogressive and that the opposite is the losing side. The\r\nindividualists, in their scorn of socialism, render the most valuable\r\nservice towards fundamental and complete reaction to the\r\naristocratic-plutocratic party of exploitation, because they spread\r\nconfusion in the ranks of the idealists by discrediting their\r\nsolidarity. Nevertheless, they call themselves \"the Moderns,\" and dub\r\nthe advocates of solidarity 'old fogies.' The most modern thing in the\r\nWest is a vile cult of the Uebermensch (over-man) Renaissance\r\nsentimentalism and the cult of beauty in bearing--æsthetic snobism.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that originates with Nietzsche. The mistake, however, does not lie\r\nin the principle of individualism, which does not exclude solidarity,\r\nbut, on the contrary, advances it. For the individual unquestionably\r\nattains solidarity in the very struggle towards his own perfection. The\r\nmistake lies in the æstheticism, in the basing of life on externals and\r\non enjoyment. Connected with this is the strangest thing of all, that\r\nthis resurrection of the madness of the Renaissance has not made use of\r\nart. For all that is produced is nothing but pure silliness. I have not\r\nlaughed so much for years as at an entirely serious account of the\r\ncontents of _Mona Vanna_, or at the poems which our æsthete and decadent\r\nBalmont read to me. None of those things are to be taken seriously as\r\nart. They will only confuse people through their absurdity, which could\r\nnot exist if the healthy human understanding had not been brought into\r\ndiscredit. It is no better with you in Germany. Why is your literary\r\nproduct so low?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows, count? It has already been asserted that since 1870 the\r\ngifted minds have turned to more serious and more lucrative callings\r\nthan literature. But I do not believe it. The sciences show at present\r\njust as few geniuses as the arts. It seems as if there were laws of ebb\r\nand flow here, too. Sometimes a whole billow of inspired intellects is\r\nflung upon the earth, and then there is long drought. We have had no\r\ngreat writers since Gottfried Keller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gottfried Keller? I have never heard the name before. Who was he? What\r\ndid he write?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a Swiss who inherited Goethe's free outlook on life, and wrote\r\nthe best German novels, full of creative art, of racy humor, and of\r\nalmost uncanny knowledge of human nature. He would give you much\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? You say he inherits to some degree from Goethe. In that case my\r\nenthusiasm would be doubtful, for I cannot say I especially love that\r\nGoethe of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some of his works I admire without reserve, which stand among\r\nthe finest things that have ever been written: _Hermann and Dorothea_,\r\nfor instance. I once knew his dedication by heart. Yet the lyrics of\r\nHeine, for instance, make a deeper impression upon me than Goethe's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon the remark, count, but in that case your knowledge of the German\r\nlanguage is not sufficient for you to notice the difference in quality.\r\nHeine is a virtuoso, who plays with form. With Goethe, every word\r\nbreathes the deepest spiritual experience and is uttered from inward\r\nnecessity.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same thing is said here of Pushkin--that his greatness can be\r\nappreciated only by those who are most deeply imbued with the spirit of\r\nthe language. I haven't any too much faith in all that, however. To be\r\nsure, a translation is only the wrong side of the carpet; yet I believe\r\nreally great works hold their own in translation, so the form of phrase\r\ncannot be the only test for the value of a writing. But what repels me\r\nin Goethe is precisely that play on form of which you accuse Heine.\r\nGoethe and Shakespeare are both artists in the sense in which you\r\nreproach the Moderns. They are bent only upon æsthetic play, and create\r\nonly for enjoyment, and not with the heart's blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not admit that, count, without repudiating everything I have\r\never thought and felt. Not for Shakespeare, in whom, through all the\r\ndramatic conventions of the greater part, we hear the heartbeat often\r\nenough. As for Goethe, whose poems are partly painful confessions,\r\nwritten only for the reason he himself gives,\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Warum sucht' ich den Weg so sehnsuchtsvoll\r\n     Wenn ich ihn nicht den Brüdern zeigen soll?\"[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I find much more of this feeling for humanity in Schiller.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is more rhetorical, appeals more directly to the middle class and\r\ncontemporaries. But, like the overbearing political tribune he was, he\r\nhas hardly entered into the joy and sorrow of the human soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is exactly this that brings him nearer to me than Goethe and\r\nShakespeare. He is filled with a sacred sense of purpose in his work. He\r\nhad not the cold ambition of the artist to be merely faithful to his\r\nmodel. He was full of longing that we should be carried away with him.\r\nOf the three requirements I make of the great artist--technical\r\nperfection, worthiness of subject, and self-identification with the\r\nmatter--the last is the most important. One may be a great writer even\r\nwhen technical perfection, complete mastery of the tricks of the trade,\r\nis lacking, as, for instance, in the case of Dostoyevski. But unless a\r\nman writes with his heart's blood he cannot be a great artist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe the heart's-blood doctrine would rule out all cheerful\r\n_genre_, and that meets perhaps best of all the fundamental purpose of\r\nart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that because you yourself see in art only a means of enjoyment,\r\nonly play.\"\r\n\r\nI could not have denied that this is really my conception, and should,\r\ntherewith, have hit upon the fundamental opposition between our Western\r\nconception of life, as expressed by Goethe, and the exclusively\r\nreligio-moral one of Tolstoï. I could not, however, compel myself to\r\nfill with a fruitless argument the few hours I had to spend with the\r\nhonored man. I should have been as little able to convince the apostle\r\nof seventy-five, whose ascetic philosophy is the product of definite\r\nconditions of civilization, as he to convince me, the west-German, whose\r\nlight-heartedness and confident belief in culture had ripened in the\r\nsunshine of the Rhine bank. I therefore evaded the point, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I have hitherto not taken your rigorous demands upon art as well as\r\nupon life quite literally, count. I thought to myself that when one\r\npulls up a horse suddenly he does not wish it to turn around, but only\r\nto stop. I supposed that you wished merely to counteract other powerful\r\nimpulses.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the count, after a moment's reflection. \"That is not so. I\r\nbelieve in the absolute correctness of my demands. I myself, however,\r\nwas too weakly or too badly trained to submit to them altogether. I\r\ncannot, for instance, keep from enjoying Chopin, although I condemn his\r\nmusic as exclusive art, which addresses itself to the understanding and\r\nfeelings only of the aristocratically cultivated few.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me an unattainable ideal that all men should share in\r\nenjoyment of art; and the requirement that the artist shall refrain from\r\nall work that could be enjoyed only by a limited number of especially\r\ncultivated men is impossible and even harmful. It would deprive us of\r\nthe finest works we possess.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the requirement is justified in and of itself, it is quite\r\nimmaterial what sacrifices must be made to it. Nothing is to be\r\nconsidered in comparison with truth.\"\r\n\r\nI could go no further here, again. For I was talking with the man who\r\nrepudiates his own immortal works because they are beyond the\r\ncomprehension of most people, and therefore help to widen the gulf\r\nbetween the educated and the uneducated. I could not even make the\r\nobjection that almost all learning must be condemned on the same ground,\r\nfor it is well known that Tolstoï does not shrink from even this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, a matter of indifference to him whether people\r\nconsider his views to be scientifically founded--_i. e._, correctly\r\nreasoned out or not. He said to me in the course of the conversation:\r\n\r\n\"I often laugh, and I also often grow angry, when people cast it in my\r\nface that my studies are not scientific. I assert in return that the\r\nwhole of positivism and materialism is unscientific. If I seek a science\r\nby which I can _live_, I seek it only logically and steadfastly, or\r\nscientifically, with no contradiction within itself from its premises to\r\nits final conclusion. Scepticism, on the other hand, completely denies\r\nevery concept of life. And yet the sceptic wishes to live, otherwise he\r\nwould kill himself. He admits, therefore, by the mere fact that he is\r\nalive that his whole philosophy is nothing for him but an idle exercise\r\nof the intellect which has no bearing on his life. That means that it is\r\nnot in the least _true_ for him. I, however, seek the premise from which\r\nI can not only live, but live peacefully and cheerfully. This premise is\r\nGod, and the duty for us that of perfecting ourselves. I follow the\r\nconsequence of that premise to the end, and feel that I am right not\r\nonly in words but also in deeds.\"\r\n\r\nNo truly scientific thinker needs to be reminded that Tolstoï here, in\r\nthe _a priori_ assumption that life must have a meaning, departs from\r\nthe fundamental principle of all scientific reasoning--namely, the\r\nstarting without a hypothesis, and, like Kant, to whom he feels drawn\r\nnot without reason, works with postulates instead of with conclusions.\r\nBut who will not rejoice that the poet, who above all things was and is\r\na passionate human creature, has saved himself from the despair of\r\nagnosticism by a bold leap to the rock of faith, which lies beyond all\r\nscience, and can neither be supported nor shaken by it? How many of the\r\nproud agnostics do not secretly cast furtive glances at that rock, where\r\nthey would like to reserve themselves a place against emergencies? While\r\nTolstoï sincerely acknowledges that without this foundation under his\r\nfeet he would no longer be able to live. He needed this quieting as to\r\nthe outcome of things to be able to follow his poetic impulse to look\r\nat the world as it is. Only entirely barren, abstract natures find their\r\nsatisfaction in the voluntarily limited logical sequence of science,\r\nconfined as it is to the empirical. All men of imagination, including\r\nGoethe and Bismarck, have had their share of mystic confidence in that\r\nbeneficent course of the universe which in popular language is called\r\nGod or Providence. This poetic faith has, of course, nothing whatever to\r\ndo with science.\r\n\r\nUndervaluation of one's own qualities, however, and enthusiasm for the\r\ncomplementary ones, is a familiar psychological fact. The poet Tolstoï\r\nwishes to be a cut-and-dried philosopher. He repudiates his poetry, and\r\nlikewise speaks coldly--indeed, even with hostility--of the spirits akin\r\nto him, of Goethe and Shakespeare. There is only one opinion among\r\nlovers of art, and that is that Tolstoï, in the natural spontaneity of\r\nhis characters and incidents, is to be compared with these two alone,\r\nand in the abundance of his psychological traits with Shakespeare only.\r\nYet at present Tolstoï is engaged in writing a book, soon to appear,\r\nagainst Shakespeare and the study of Shakespeare. In our conversation he\r\ncame back to the indefensible over-estimation of this artist.\r\n\r\n\"If people were capable of approaching Shakespeare impartially they\r\nwould lose their unreasonable reverence for this writer. He is crude,\r\nimmoral, a toady to the great, an arrogant despiser of the small, a\r\nslanderer of the common people. He lacks good taste in his jests, is\r\nunjust in his sympathies, ignoble, intoxicated with the acquaintance\r\nwith which a few aristocrats honored him. Even his art is\r\nover-estimated, for in every case the best comes from his predecessors\r\nor his sources. But people are quite blind. They are under the spell of\r\nthe consensus of opinion handed down for centuries. It is truly\r\nincredible what ideas can be awakened in the human mind by consecutive\r\ntreatments of one and the same theme.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that one will not go astray in finding in the above-mentioned\r\nbook against Shakespeare a prosecution at the same time of Tolstoï's\r\ncampaign against the æsthetic-artistic view of life in general. His\r\npurpose is to overthrow one of the chief idols of the æsthetic cult. As\r\nfar as the arguments on the moral side are concerned, he will certainly\r\nhave a following. The son of a tavern-keeper, himself an actor,\r\nShakespeare was certainly not the ideal of a gentleman. Tolstoï will,\r\nhowever, have difficulty in abolishing wonder at the artistic power of\r\nthis most sumptuous of all geniuses.\r\n\r\nTolstoï dealt with the influence of general opinion again in another\r\nconnection. He was speaking of the mischief that the newspapers do in\r\nthe world, but chose, in my opinion, a very inappropriate example of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"During the Dreyfus case,\" said he, \"I received at least a thousand\r\nletters from all parts of the world asking me to express an opinion.\r\nHow could I have responded? Here I am in Russia; the transaction was in\r\nFrance. It was absolutely impossible to get a correct idea of the\r\nproceedings, for every paper reported it differently. In and of itself,\r\nwhat was the thing that had happened? An innocent officer had been\r\ncondemned. That was an unimportant occurrence. There were much greater\r\ncrimes committed by those in power. But the whole world took the alarm.\r\nEverybody had an incontrovertible conviction as to the guilt or the\r\ninnocence of a man whom nobody knew, and whose judges nobody knew. A\r\nthing like that is an epidemic, not thinking.\"\r\n\r\nOne must certainly travel a very strange and lonely road to fail to\r\nappreciate that in this very instance the press accomplished an enormous\r\nwork in arousing mankind, and in showing them the danger threatening\r\nfrom the Jesuits. The Dreyfus affair belongs to world-history as an\r\nepoch-making event. Perhaps the deliverance of the whole white race from\r\nthe octopus-like embrace of clericalism and militarism is its work. And\r\nCount Tolstoï, who regards it as his mission to fight militarism, lives\r\nthrough the chief battle and does not suspect it! One certainly ought\r\nnot to forget that he is in Russia, where the incarceration of innocent\r\nmen is an every-day affair, and that the Russian papers think they\r\nfulfil their duty to an allied nation by treating the matter from the\r\nstand-point of Méline and Marcier.\r\n\r\nTolstoï's antipathy to this affair does not come at all from any\r\npossible anti-Semitic feeling. He does not love the mercantile Jews, who\r\nhave not the slightest trace of Christian spirit. He condemns\r\nanti-Semitism, however, in the most emphatic way. \"Anti-Semitism,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is not a misfortune for the Jews, for he who suffers wrong is not\r\nto be pitied, but he who does wrong. Anti-Semitism demoralizes society.\r\nIt is the worst evil of our time, for it poisons whole generations. It\r\nmakes them blind to right and wrong, and kills all moral feeling. It\r\nchanges the soul into a place of desolation in which all goodness and\r\nnobility are swept away.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to other matters, Tolstoï does not use strong expressions. He\r\nparries them good-humoredly but decisively. When we were talking of the\r\nnew romanticists, I used some severe language. I explained the\r\nuproarious applause of certain gifted but degenerate and perverse\r\nartists as a cynical attack on the inborn moral sense, and said,\r\nspeaking from my own experience, that I had yet to meet one of those\r\ndevotees of immorality whom I had not found on closer acquaintance to be\r\nmorally deficient. When, however, I spoke of literary support of vice,\r\nthe count raised his hand to stop me, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Let us be gentle in our judgment of our fellow-men.\" Then he added, \"Go\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nI had, however, gained command of myself and begged pardon for my\r\nvehemence. I could not go on, however, for what had been on my tongue\r\nwas only more bitter words.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me kindly, and merely said, \"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that Tolstoï did not mean by this to express sympathy\r\nwith the Diabolics and other eccentrics. Moreover, he spoke flatly\r\nagainst art for art's sake, which he calls tiresome more than anything\r\nelse. \"Agonized productions of the search for originality, welcomed by\r\nidleness, and intended for the applause of the critics of so-called fine\r\ntaste.\" He shrugged his shoulders over the fact that a monument had been\r\nerected to Baudelaire. He agreed with me, however, when I traced the\r\ninterest in exotic suggestion in the creative arts, as for everything\r\neccentric and bizarre, back to the tendency towards an entirely external\r\nnaturalism, which would completely rule out from art the personality of\r\nthe artist. He returned again to his text.\r\n\r\n\"Without the deepest sympathy and complete identification with the\r\nsubject no work of art can ever be produced.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not admit, however, that this identification with the subject is\r\nfound in the experiments of these latter-day writers. He sees in them\r\nonly a sudden change from the fashion for objectivity to the fashion for\r\nsubjectivity. When, however, I spoke of the good-fortune of the Russian\r\nin not being obliged to take part in all these fashions, because he had\r\nalready showed in his deep-hearted realism that it is possible to be\r\ntrue to reality, and yet be full of warmth and meaning, he again raised\r\nhis hand to stop me, and blushed. I could not tell whether it was from\r\nmodesty or whether he does not wish any longer to hear of the works of\r\nhis \"literary\" period. I believe, however, that the noise of all this no\r\nlonger reaches his ear. When I spoke with warm enthusiasm of the debt we\r\nall owe him, said that his art was a revelation to us, that through him\r\nwe had first learned what poetic power lies in the simplest and deepest\r\nfidelity to nature, he stopped me in his gentle way. Only philanthropy\r\nis now a matter of any importance for him. Everything else is empty\r\ntrifling. He said to me:\r\n\r\n\"You are still buried deep in materialism. You must see that you free\r\nyourself from that.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was good enough to recognize my honest purpose of\r\nseeking the truth, even though I do not succeed in finding it in all\r\npoints as he believes he has found it.\r\n\r\nI must certainly admit that in the late hours of the night, as he sat\r\nopposite me, his fine head leaning far back and resting on one hand, his\r\nglowing eyes making him seem as it were transparent, I had great\r\ndifficulty in preserving a conventional bearing. Here was one of the\r\ngreatest men of all times, who had risen out of the purely human and had\r\nbecome a saint upon whom rests the divine light. The kindness and\r\ntenderness of his voice and the gentleness of his words are\r\nindescribable. He has the love and the dauntless courage of the prophet\r\nand the apostle without their passion and wrath. It is doubtful whether\r\nany mortal has ever had more understanding of human weakness than he. He\r\ncombats only institutions, never men. And yet no other man has had such\r\ninfluence upon our consciences as he, most compassionate of all judges\r\nin spite of the pitiless keenness of his vision.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when the count's sleigh took us to Kozlovka, the nearest\r\nstation to the estate. In leaving I could not conceal the extent to\r\nwhich I was moved. When I think of the final moments, when the count\r\nstood at the head of the stairs and called a last word after me, while I\r\nturned to him to say good-bye once more and forever, it seems to me that\r\nI never in my life experienced anything more overwhelming. I carried\r\naway an impression that the whole hall was filled with the light of his\r\neyes. Yet it was only a prosaic bit of advice for our return trip to\r\nMoscow, to give which he had hurried after us after the adieus in his\r\nstudy. The Countess Sasha, however, stood in the starlight by the door,\r\nlovely as a goddess of hospitality. It was gratifying to know that the\r\nsaintly old man was in the care of this lovely creature.\r\n\r\nUnder the twinkling stars we sped at a brisk trot past black forests and\r\nover the silent, deep-buried fields. Within us re-echoed the saying of\r\nKant, \"Two things there are that always fill me with reverent awe: the\r\nstarry heavens above me and the moral consciousness within.\" The man\r\nwhose hand I had just grasped embodies the moral consciousness of our\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[15] \"Why do I seek the way so ardently, if not that I might show it to\r\nmy brothers?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
