The Chinese conception of a rational\r\nworld order was manifestly incompatible with the Western system of\r\nindependent sovereign states and the Chinese code of political ethics was\r\ndifficult to reconcile with the Western preference for a reign of law. No\r\nargument has been necessary to persuade Westerners that Chinese political\r\nphilosophy would be improved by the influence of Western political\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe superior qualifications of Sun Yat-sen for the interpretation of\r\nWestern political science to the Chinese have also been widely recognized\r\nin the West, particularly in the United States. Dr. Sun received a modern\r\neducation in medicine and surgery and presumably grasped the spirit of\r\nWestern science. He read widely, more widely perhaps than any contemporary\r\npolitical leader of the first rank except Woodrow Wilson, in the\r\nliterature of Western political science. He was thoroughly familiar with\r\nthe development of American political thought and full of sympathy for\r\nAmerican political ideals. His aspiration to build a modern democratic\r\nrepublic amidst the ruins of the medieval Manchu Empire, Americans at\r\nleast can readily understand.\r\n\r\nWhat is only beginning to be understood, however, in the West is, that it\r\nis equally important to interpret Chinese political philosophy to the rest\r\nof the world. Western political science has contributed a great deal to\r\nthe development of political power. But it has failed lamentably to\r\nilluminate the ends for which such power should be used. Political ethics\r\nis by no means superfluous in lands where a government of law is supposed\r\nto be established in lieu of a government of men. The limitation of the\r\nauthority of sovereign states in the interest of a better world order is\r\nan enterprise to which at last, it may be hoped not too late, Westerners\r\nare beginning to dedicate themselves.\r\n\r\nAs an interpreter of Chinese political philosophy to the West Dr. Sun has\r\nno peer. Better than any other Chinese revolutionary leader he appreciated\r\nthe durable values in the classical political philosophy of the Far East.\r\nHe understood the necessity for preserving those values, while introducing\r\nthe Western political ideas deemed most proper for adapting the Chinese\r\npolitical system to its new place in the modern world. His system of\r\npolitical thought, therefore, forms a blend of Far Eastern political\r\nphilosophy and Western political science. It suggests at the same time\r\nboth what is suitable in Western political science for the use of the Far\r\nEast and what is desirable in Far Eastern political philosophy for the\r\nimprovement of the West.\r\n\r\nDr. Linebarger has analyzed Dr. Sun’s political ideas, and also his plans\r\nfor the political rehabilitation of China, with a view to the interests of\r\nWestern students of politics. For this task his training and experience\r\nhave given him exceptional competence. The result is a book, which not\r\nonly renders obsolete all previous volumes in Western languages on modern\r\nChinese political philosophy, but also makes available for the political\r\nscientists and politicians of the West the best political thought of the\r\nFar East on the fundamental problems of Western politics.\r\n\r\nARTHUR N. HOLCOMBE\r\n_Harvard University_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book represents an exploration into a field of political thought\r\nwhich is still more or less unknown. The Chinese revolution has received\r\nmuch attention from publicists and historians, and a vast number of works\r\ndealing with almost every phase of Chinese life and events appears every\r\nyear in the West. The extraordinary difficulty of the language, the\r\nobscurity—to Westerners—of the Chinese cultural background, and the\r\ngreater vividness of events as compared with theories have led Western\r\nscholars to devote their attention, for the most part, to descriptions of\r\nChinese politics rather than to venture into the more difficult field of\r\nChinese political thought, without which, however, the political events\r\nare scarcely intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe author has sought to examine one small part of modern Chinese\r\npolitical thought, partly as a sample of the whole body of thought, and\r\npartly because the selection, although small, is an important one. Sun\r\nYat-sen is by far the most conspicuous figure in recent Chinese history,\r\nand his doctrines, irrespective of the effectiveness or permanence of the\r\nconsequences of their propagation, have a certain distinct position in\r\nhistory. The _San Min Chu I_, his chief work, not only represents an\r\nimportant phase in the revolution of Chinese social and political thought,\r\nbut solely and simply as doctrine, may be regarded as a Chinese expression\r\nof tendencies of political thought current in the Western world.\r\n\r\nThe personal motives, arising out of an early and rather intimate family\r\nrelationship with the Chinese nationalist movement centering around the\r\nperson of Sun Yat-sen, that led the author to undertake this subject, have\r\ntheir advantages and disadvantages. The chief disadvantage lies in the\r\nfact that the thesis must of necessity treat of many matters which are the\r\nobjects of hot controversy, and that the author, friendly to the movement\r\nas a whole but neutral as between its factions, may seem at times to deal\r\nunjustly or over-generously with certain persons and groups. The younger\r\nwidow of Sun Yat-sen (née Soong Ching-ling) may regard the mention of her\r\nhusband and the Nanking government in the same breath as an act of\r\ntreachery. Devoted to the memory of her husband, she has turned,\r\nnevertheless, to the Left, and works on cordial terms with the Communists.\r\nShe said: “... the Nanking Government has crushed every open liberal,\r\ndemocratic, or humanitarian movement in our country. It has destroyed all\r\ntrade unions, smashed every strike of the workers for the right to\r\nexistence, has thrown hordes of criminal gangsters who are simultaneously\r\nFascist ‘Blue Shirts’ against every labor, cultural, or national\r\nrevolutionary movement in the country.”(1) The author, from what he\r\nhimself has seen of the National Government, is positive that it is not\r\nmerely dictatorial, ruthless, cruel, treacherous, or historically\r\nunnecessary; nor would he, contrarily, assert that the National Government\r\nlives up to or surpasses the brilliant ideals of Sun Yat-sen. He seeks to\r\ndeal charitably with all factions, to follow a middle course whenever he\r\ncan, and in any case to state fairly the positions of both sides.\r\n\r\nThe advantages may serve to offset the disadvantages. In the first place,\r\nthe author’s acquaintance with the Nationalist movement has given him\r\nsomething of a background from which to present his exposition. This\r\nbackground cannot, of course, be documented, but it may serve to make the\r\npresentation more assured and more vivid. In the second place, the author\r\nhas had access to certain private manuscripts and papers, and has had the\r\nbenefit of his father’s counsel on several points in this work.(2) The\r\nauthor believes that on the basis of this material and background he is\r\njustified in venturing into this comparatively unknown field.\r\n\r\nThe primary sources for this work have been Sun Yat-sen’s own works. A\r\nconsiderable number of these were written originally in the English\r\nlanguage. Translations of his major Chinese works are more or less fully\r\navailable in English, German, French, or Spanish. The author’s highly\r\ninadequate knowledge of the Chinese written language has led him to depend\r\nalmost altogether upon translations, but he has sought—in some cases,\r\nperhaps, unsuccessfully—to minimize the possibility of misunderstanding or\r\nerror by checking the translations against one another. Through the\r\nassistance of his Chinese friends, he has been able to refer to Sun’s\r\ncomplete works in Chinese and to Chinese books on Sun wherever such\r\nreference was imperatively necessary. A list of the Chinese titles thus\r\nmade available is included in the bibliography. The language difficulty,\r\nwhile an annoyance and a handicap, has not been so considerable as to give\r\nthe author reason to suppose that his conclusions would have been\r\ndifferent in any significant respect had he been able to make free and\r\ncontinuous use of Chinese and Russian sources.\r\n\r\nThe author has thought of the present work as a contribution to political\r\ntheory rather than to sinology, and has tried to keep the discussion of\r\nsinological questions at a minimum. In the transliteration of Chinese\r\nwords and names he has adhered more or less closely to the Wade system,\r\nand has rendered most terms in the _kuo yü_, or national language. Despite\r\nthis rule, he gives the name of President Sun in its more commonly known\r\nCantonese form, Sun Yat-sen, rather than in the _kuo yü_, Sun I-hsien.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging assistance and encouragement received, the author must\r\nfirst of all turn to his father, Judge Paul Myron Wentworth Linebarger,\r\nLegal Advisor to The National Government of China, counsellor to and\r\nbiographer of Sun Yat-sen during the latter’s lifetime. Without his\r\npatient encouragement and his concrete assistance, this book could neither\r\nhave been begun nor brought to a conclusion after it was started. The\r\nauthor desires, however, to make it perfectly clear that this work has no\r\nrelation to the connections of Judge Linebarger with the Chinese\r\nGovernment or with the Nationalist Party. No information coming to the\r\nknowledge of Judge Linebarger in the course of his official duties has\r\nbeen here incorporated. Anxiously scrupulous to maintain a completely\r\ndetached point of view, the author has refrained from communicating with\r\nor submitting the book to Chinese Government or Party officials, and\r\nwrites purely as an American student of China.\r\n\r\nProfessor James Hart, formerly at The Johns Hopkins University and now at\r\nThe University of Virginia, Professor Arthur O. Lovejoy, The Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, Professor Harley Farnsworth MacNair and Dr. Ernest Price, both\r\nof The University of Chicago, have rendered inestimable assistance by\r\nreading the manuscript and giving the author the benefit of their advice.\r\nProfessor Hart has criticized the work as an enterprise in political\r\nscience. Professor Lovejoy assisted the author by reading the first third\r\nof the work, and selections of the later parts, and applying his thorough\r\nand stimulating criticism; the author regrets that he was unable to adopt\r\nall of Professor Lovejoy’s suggestions in full, and is deeply grateful for\r\nthe help. Professor MacNair read the book as a referee for a dissertation,\r\nand made a great number of comments which have made the book clearer and\r\nmore accurate; the author would not have ventured to present this work to\r\nthe public had it not been for the reassurances and encouragement given\r\nhim by Professor MacNair. Dr. Ernest Price, while at The Hopkins,\r\nsupervised the composition of the first drafts; his judicious and balanced\r\ncriticism, based upon sixteen years’ intimacy with the public and private\r\nlife of the Chinese, and a sensitive appreciation of Chinese values, were\r\nof great value to the author in establishing his perspective and lines of\r\nstudy. The author takes this opportunity to thank these four gentlemen for\r\ntheir great kindness and invaluable assistance.\r\n\r\nIt is with deep regret that the author abbreviates his acknowledgments and\r\nthanks for the inspiration and the favors he received in his study of\r\nChinese politics from Dr. C. Walter Young; Professor Frederic Ogg, of The\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin; Professors Kenneth Colegrove, William McGovern,\r\nand Ikuo Oyama, of The Northwestern University; Dr. Arthur Hummel, of The\r\nLibrary of Congress; Professor Frederick Dunn, of Yale University;\r\nProfessor Arthur Holcombe, of Harvard University; Professor Quincy Wright,\r\nof The University of Chicago; and Dr. Wallace McClure, of The Department\r\nof State. Many of the author’s Chinese friends assisted by reading the\r\nmanuscript and criticizing it from their more intimate knowledge of their\r\nown country, among them being Messrs. Miao Chung-yi and Djang Chu, at The\r\nJohns Hopkins University; Professor Jên T’ai, of Nankai University; and\r\nMessrs. Wang Kung-shou, Ch’ing Ju-chi, and Lin Mou-sheng, of The\r\nUniversity of Chicago, made many helpful suggestions. The author must\r\nthank his teachers at The Johns Hopkins University, to whom he is indebted\r\nfor three years of the most patient assistance and stimulating\r\ninstruction, in respect of both the present work and other fields in the\r\nstudy of government: Dr. Johannes Mattern; Dr. Albert Weinberg; Mr. Leon\r\nSachs; and Professor W. W. Willoughby. Finally, he must acknowledge his\r\nindebtedness to his wife, Margaret Snow Linebarger, for her patient\r\nassistance in preparing this volume for the press.\r\n\r\nPAUL M. A. LINEBARGER.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1936.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem of the _San Min Chu I_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen played many rôles in the history of his times. He was one of\r\nthose dramatic and somewhat formidable figures who engage the world’s\r\nattention at the very outset of their careers. In the late years of the\r\nnineteenth century, he was already winning some renown in the West; it was\r\npicturesque that a Cantonese, a Christian physician, should engage in\r\ndesperate conspiracies against the Manchu throne. Sun became known as a\r\npolitical adventurer, a forerunner, as it were, of such mutually\r\ndissimilar personages as Trotsky, Lawrence, and Major-General Doihara.\r\nWith the illusory success of the revolution of 1911, and his Presidency of\r\nthe first Republic, Sun ceased being a conspirator in the eyes of the\r\nworld’s press, and became the George Washington of China. It is in this\r\nrôle that he is most commonly known, and his name most generally recalled.\r\nAfter the world war, in the atmosphere of extreme tension developed,\r\nperhaps, by the Bolshevik revolution, Sun was regarded as an enigmatic\r\nleader, especially significant in the struggle between Asiatic\r\nnationalisms allied with the Soviets against the traditional capitalist\r\nstate-system. It was through him that the Red anti-imperialist policy was\r\npushed to its greatest success, and he was hated and admired, ridiculed\r\nand feared, down to the last moments of his life. When he died, American\r\nreporters in Latvia cabled New York their reports of Russian comments on\r\nthe event.(3) More, perhaps, than any other Chinese of modern times, Sun\r\nsymbolized the entrance of China into world affairs, and the inevitable\r\nconfluence of Western and Far Eastern history.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of Sun that he should have appeared in another and\r\nfinal rôle after his death. He had been thought of as conspirator,\r\nstatesman, and mass leader; but with the advent of his party to power it\r\nbecame publicly apparent that he had also been a political philosopher.\r\nThe tremendous prestige enjoyed by him as state-founder and party leader\r\nwas enhanced by his importance as prophet and law-giver. His doctrines\r\nbecame the state philosophy of China, and for a while his most zealous\r\nfollowers sought to have him canonized in a quite literal fashion, and at\r\none stroke to make him replace Confucius and the Sons of Heaven. After the\r\nextreme enthusiasms of the Sun Yat-sen cult subsided, Sun remained the\r\ngreat national hero-sage of modern China. Even in those territories where\r\nthe authority of his political heirs was not completely effective, his\r\nflag was flown and his doctrines taught.\r\n\r\nHis doctrines have provided the theories upon which the Nationalist\r\nrevolution was based; they form the extra-juridical constitution of the\r\nNational Government of China. When the forces hostile to Sun Yat-sen and\r\nhis followers are considered, it is amazing that his ideas and ideals\r\nshould have survived. An empire established with the aid of Japanese arms,\r\nand still under Japanese hegemony, controls Manchuria; parts of north\r\nChina are ruled by a bastard government, born of a compromise between\r\nenemies; a largely unrecognized but powerful Soviet Republic exists in\r\nouter Mongolia; the lamaist oligarchy goes on in Tibet; and somewhere, in\r\ncentral and western China, a Soviet group, not quite a government but more\r\nthan a conspiracy, is fighting for existence. It is quite probable that\r\nnowhere else in the world can there be found a greater variety of\r\nprinciples, each scheme of principles fostered by an armed organization\r\nstruggling with its rivals. In this chaos the National Government has made\r\nthe most effective bid for authority and the greatest effort for the\r\nreëstablishment of order; through it the principles of Sun Yat-sen rule\r\nthe political life of a population greater than that of the United States\r\nor of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to evaluate the importance of political doctrines. Even if\r\n_The Three Principles_ is judged by the extent of the population which its\r\nfollowers control, it has achieved greater results in practical politics\r\nin fifteen years than has Marxism in ninety. Such a criterion may well be\r\ndisputed, but, whatever the test, it cannot be denied that the thought of\r\nSun Yat-sen has played a major part in the political development of his\r\nnative land. It may continue into the indefinitely remote future, or may\r\nsuccumb to the perils that surround its advocates; in any case, these\r\ndoctrines have been taught long enough and broadly enough to make an\r\nimpress on the age, and have been so significant in political and cultural\r\nhistory that they can never sink into complete obscurity.\r\n\r\nWhat are these doctrines? Sun Yat-sen was so voluminous a writer that it\r\nwould be impossible for his followers to digest and codify all his\r\nwritings into one neat and coherent handbook; he himself did not provide\r\none. Before printing became common, there was a certain automatic process\r\nof condensation which preserved the important utterances of great men, and\r\nlet their trivial sayings perish. Sun, however, must have realized that he\r\nwas leaving a vast legacy of materials which are not altogether coherent\r\nor consistent with one another. Certain of his works were naturally more\r\nimportant than others, but, to make the choice definitive, he himself\r\nindicated four sources which his followers might draw upon for a\r\ndefinitive statement of his views.(4)\r\n\r\nHis _Political Testament_ cites the _Chien Kuo Fang Lo_ (_The Program of\r\nNational Reconstruction_), the _Chien Kuo Ta Kang_ (_The Outline of\r\nNational Reconstruction_), the _San Min Chu I_ (_The Triple Demism_, also\r\ntranslated as _The Three Principles of the People_), and the _Manifesto_\r\nissued by the first national congress of the Party.(5) These four items\r\ndiffer quite sharply from one another in form. No one of them can be\r\nrelied upon to give the whole of Sun’s doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe _Chien Kuo Fang Lo_ (_The Program of National Reconstruction_) is in\r\nreality three works, only remotely related to one another. The first item\r\nin the trilogy is the _Sun Wên Hsüeh Shê_ (_The Philosophy of Sun Wên_);\r\nit is a series of familiar essays on the Chinese way of thought.(6) The\r\nsecond is the _Min Ch’üan Ts’u Pu_, _The Primer of Democracy_, which is\r\nlittle more than a text on parliamentary law.(7) The third is the _Shih\r\nYeh Chi Hua_, known in English as _The International Development __ of\r\nChina_, which Sun wrote in both English and Chinese.(8) These three works,\r\nunder the alternate titles of “The Program of Psychological\r\nReconstruction,” “The Program of Social Reconstruction,” and “The Program\r\nof Material Reconstruction” form _The Program of National Reconstruction_.\r\n\r\nThe _Chien Kuo Ta Kang, The Outline of National Reconstruction_, is an\r\noutline of twenty-five points, giving the necessary steps towards the\r\nnational reconstruction in their most concise form.(9)\r\n\r\nThe _San Min Chu I_ is Sun’s most important work. It comprises sixteen\r\nlectures setting forth his socio-political theories and his programs. The\r\ntitle most commonly used in Western versions is _The Three Principles of\r\nthe People_.(10)\r\n\r\nThe last document mentioned in Sun Yat-sen’s will was the _Manifesto_ of\r\nthe first national congress of the Kuomintang. This was not written by\r\nhimself, but was drafted by Wang Ch’ing-wei, one of his closest followers,\r\nand embodies essentially the same ideas as do the other three items, even\r\nthough Borodin—the emissary of the Third International—had been consulted\r\nin its preparation.(11)\r\n\r\nSun undoubtedly regretted leaving such a heterogeneous and ill-assembled\r\ngroup of works as his literary bequest. Throughout the latter years of his\r\nlife he was studying political science in the hope that he might be able\r\nto complete a great treatise which he had projected, an analysis and\r\nstatement of the programs of the Chinese nationalists. One attempt toward\r\nactualization of this work was frustrated when Sun’s manuscripts and a\r\ngreat part of his library were burned in the attack launched against him\r\nby Ch’en Ch’iung-ming in 1922. His apology for the makeshift volume on the\r\n_San Min Chu I_ is pathetic: “As I had neither time to prepare nor books\r\nto use as references, I could do nothing else in these lectures but\r\nimprovise after I ascended the platform. Thus I have omitted and forgotten\r\nmany things which were in my original manuscript. Although before having\r\nthem printed, I revised them, added (passages) and eliminated (others),\r\nyet, those lectures are far from coming up to my original manuscripts,\r\neither in the subject matter itself, or in the concatenations of the\r\ndiscussion, or in the facts adduced as proofs.”(12) Sun was in all\r\nprobability a more assiduous and widely read student of political science\r\nthan any other world leader of his day except Wilson; he studied\r\ninnumerable treatises on government, and was surprisingly familiar with\r\nthe general background of Western politics, in theory and practice. He was\r\naware of the shabby appearance that these undigested occasional pieces\r\nwould present when put forth as the bible of a new China, and earnestly\r\nenjoined his followers to carry on his labors and bring them to\r\nfruition.(13)\r\n\r\nThe various works included in the _Chien Kuo Fang Lo_, while satisfactory\r\nfor the purposes Sun had in mind when he wrote them, are not enough to\r\noutline the fundamentals both of political theory and a governmental plan.\r\nThe familiar essays have an important bearing on the formation of the\r\nideology of a new China; the primer of democracy, less; the industrial\r\nplan is one of those magnificent dreams which, in the turn of a decade,\r\nmay inspire an equally great reality. The outline and the manifesto are no\r\nmore suited to the rôle of classics; they are decalogues rather than\r\nbibles.(14) There remains the _San Min Chu I_.\r\n\r\nThe _San Min Chu I_ is a collection of sixteen lectures delivered in\r\nCanton in 1924. There were to have been eighteen, but Sun was unable to\r\ngive the last two. Legend has it that Borodin persuaded Sun to give the\r\nseries.(15) Whatever the cause of their being offered, they attracted\r\nimmediate attention. Interest in Sun and in his ideas was at a fever heat;\r\nhis friends turned to the printed lectures for guidance; his enemies, for\r\nstatements which could be turned against him. Both friends and enemies\r\nfound what they wanted. To the friends, the _San Min Chu I_ presented a\r\nfairly complete outline of Sun’s political and social thought in such a\r\nform that it could be preserved and broadcast readily. There was danger,\r\nbefore the book appeared, that the intrinsic unity in Sun’s thinking would\r\nbe lost sight of by posterity, that his ideas would appear as a\r\ndisconnected jumble of brilliant inspirations. The sixteen lectures\r\nincorporated a great part of the doctrines which he had been preaching for\r\nmore than a generation. To the enemies of Sun, the work was welcome. They\r\npointed out the numerous simplifications and inconsistencies, the frequent\r\ncontradictions in matters of detail, the then outrageous denunciations of\r\nthe economic and political system predominant in the Far East. They\r\nridiculed Sun because he was Chinese, and because he was not Chinese\r\nenough, and backed up their criticisms with passages from the book.(16)\r\n\r\nWhen Sun gave the lectures, he was a sick man. He carried an ivory-headed\r\nsword cane with him on the platform; occasionally, holding it behind him\r\nand locking his arms through it, he would press it against his back to\r\nrelieve the intolerable pain.(17) The business awaiting him after each\r\nlecture was vitally important; the revolution was proceeding by leaps and\r\nbounds. The lectures are the lectures of a sick man, given to a popular\r\naudience in the uproar of revolution, without adequate preparation,\r\nimprovised in large part, and offered as one side of a crucial and\r\nbitterly disputed question. The secretaries who took down the lectures may\r\nnot have succeeded in following them completely; Sun had no leisure to do\r\nmore than skim through the book before releasing it to the press.\r\n\r\nThese improvised lectures have had to serve as the fundamental document of\r\nNationalist China. Sun Yat-sen died without writing the treatise he had\r\nplanned. The materials he left behind were a challenge to scholars and to\r\nhis followers. Many persons set to work interpreting them, each with a\r\nconscious or unconscious end in view. A German Marxian showed Sun to be a\r\nforerunner of bolshevism; an American liberal showed Sun to be a bulwark\r\nagainst bolshevism. A Chinese classicist demonstrated Sun’s reverence for\r\nthe past; a Jesuit father explained much by Sun’s modern and Christian\r\nbackground. His works have been translated into Western languages without\r\nnotes; the improvised lectures, torn from their context of a revolutionary\r\ncrisis, have served poorly to explain the ideology of Sun Yat-sen, and his\r\nlong range political, social, and economic plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Necessity of an Exposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowers of Sun who knew him personally, or were members of that circle\r\nin which his ideas and opinions were well known, have found the _San Min\r\nChu I_ and other literary remains helpful; they have been able to turn to\r\nthe documents to refresh their memories of Sun on some particular point,\r\nor to experience the encouraging force of his faith and enthusiasm again.\r\nThey need not be reminded of the main tenets of his thought, or of the\r\nfundamental values upon which he based his life and his political\r\nactivities. His sense of leadership, which strangers have at times thought\r\nfantastic, is one which they admire in him, since they, too, have felt the\r\npower of his personality and have experienced that leadership in the\r\ncourse of their own lives. His voice is ringing in their consciences; they\r\nfeel no need of a guide to his mind. At the present day many members of\r\nSun’s own family, and a considerable number of his veteran disciples are\r\nstill living; the control of the National Government is in their hands.\r\nThey are people who need no commentary on Sun Yat-sen; to them, he died\r\nonly yesterday.\r\n\r\nOthers, who met Sun only casually, or who could know him only through his\r\nwritings, have a quite different impression of his thought. They perforce\r\nassume that he thought as he wrote, and fail to realize that virtually all\r\nhis writings and speeches were occasional pieces, improvisations designed\r\nas propaganda. One of the most respected American authorities on China\r\nsays that in the _San Min Chu I_ “... there is a combination of sound\r\nsocial analysis, keen comment on comparative political science, and\r\nbombast, journalistic inaccuracy, jejune philosophizing and sophomoric\r\neconomics.”(18) This view is one which can scarcely be attacked, if one\r\nconsiders only the printed lectures, and overlooks the other utterances\r\nand the personality of Sun. To apply this, or any similar estimate (and\r\nthere are many of them), to all of Sun Yat-sen’s thought would be woefully\r\ninaccurate. It is not the critic’s fault that Sun never found time to\r\nwrite a sober, definitive political treatise expressing his ideas; it is,\r\nnevertheless, the critic’s responsibility to weigh the value of the _San\r\nMin Chu I_, and consider the importance which Sun himself attached to it,\r\nbefore judging Sun’s whole philosophy by a hastily-composed and poorly\r\nwritten book.\r\n\r\nYet, if the Western student of modern Chinese history were to look\r\nelsewhere for some general exposition of Sun Yat-sen’s political ideas, he\r\nwould find none. He could discover several excellent translations of the\r\nsixteen lectures, and parts of the other work of Sun. He would be helped\r\nby the prefatory notes to some of these translations.(19) A few treatises\r\nwould be available to him on special phases of Sun’s thought: the\r\ninfluence of Maurice William, and the influence of the Russian\r\nCommunists.(20) In addition, there would be the biographies, of which\r\nthere are more than a dozen, and a few other useful although not general\r\nworks. None of these sifts Sun’s thought, seeking to separate the\r\ntransitory from the permanent in his ideas. For this the searcher would\r\nhave to rely on brief outlines of Sun’s ideas, to be found in works\r\ndealing with modern China or the Chinese revolution.(21)\r\n\r\nThis relative scarcity of exegetic material concerning the ideology and\r\nprograms of Sun is not the result of any inadequacy on the part of those\r\npersons, both Chinese and Western, who have devoted thought and time to\r\nhis life or to the translation of his works. It is one thing to point out\r\na task that has yet to be done; and quite another, actually to perform it.\r\nAn interpretation or exposition of Sun’s thought, to be worthy of the\r\ngreat significance of the original, must be very thorough; but scarcely\r\nenough time has elapsed to allow a perspective of all the materials, let\r\nalone an orientation of Sun in the Far Eastern scene. Yet the importance\r\nof Sun demands that something be done to bring his thought to the\r\nattention of the world, so that the usual distortion of his\r\npersonality—arising from the lack of commentaries—may be avoided in\r\npresent day works. In a sense, the time is not ripe for a definitive\r\ntreatment of Sun, either as a figure in history or as a contributor to the\r\nsignificant and enduring political thought of modern times; any work now\r\ndone will, as time passes, fall grotesquely far short of adequacy. On the\r\nother hand, there is so much material of a perishable nature—anecdotes and\r\nlegends not yet committed to print, and the memories of living men—now\r\navailable, that a present-day work on Sun may gain in color and intimacy\r\nwhat it loses in judgment and objectivity, may gain in proximity what it\r\nhas to forgo in detachment. And, lastly, the complete absence of any\r\nsystematic presentation of Sun’s ideas in any Western language is so great\r\na deficiency in the fields of Far Eastern history and world political\r\nthought, that even a relatively inadequate exposition of the thought of\r\nSun Yat-sen may prove to be not without value. Sun himself never explained\r\nhis philosophy, whether theoretical or applied, in any broad, systematic\r\nfashion; nor has anyone else done so.\r\n\r\nIf the permissibility of an exposition of Sun Yat-sen’s thought be\r\nconceded, there still remains the vexing problem of a choice of method.\r\nWhile the far-flung peripheries of Sun’s thought touch almost every field\r\nof knowledge and opinion, a systematic condensation of his views cannot\r\nhope to survey the same broad ranges. The problem of proportion, of just\r\nemphasis, involves the nice appraisal of the degree of importance which\r\neach of Sun’s minor rôles had in his intellectual career as a whole. Nor\r\ndo the difficulties concerning method end with the consideration of\r\nproportion; they merely begin, for there remains the far more important\r\nand perplexing problem of a technique of interpretation.\r\n\r\nInterpretation obviously relates to the problem of language. The\r\ntranslation of theoretical terms from Chinese into English constitutes a\r\nformidable difficulty which proves, in several instances, to be\r\ninsuperable. No satisfactory equivalent for _min shêng_ (usually rendered\r\n“livelihood”) can be found in English; even simpler and less specialized\r\nterms are extremely difficult to render. Sometimes it would be convenient\r\nto employ four or five alternative translations for one Chinese term. Sun\r\nuses the word “nationalism” in the sense that a Westerner would, in\r\nadvocating national consciousness in a China hitherto unfamiliar with the\r\nconception of nation-states; but, in a different context, he uses it in\r\nthe sense of “patriotism.”(22) These difficulties must be faced and,\r\nsomehow or other, overcome. When the Western reader encounters a familiar\r\nterm in an unexpected place, he must be prepared to meet a shift of\r\nmeaning. No amount of definition can make a Chinese term, which has no\r\nexact Western equivalent, completely clear. It is simpler to grow\r\naccustomed to the term, to gather together its connotations, to understand\r\nsomething of the frame of reference wherein it is set, and thereby to\r\nlearn it as a child learns a word. A dictionary is no help to a baby; in a\r\nrealm of unfamiliar ideas even scholars must learn terms step by step.\r\n\r\nLess obviously than language, the translation of ideas and of values is\r\nalso involved in interpretation. In dealing with the intellectual content\r\nof a civilization as alien as that of China, the Westerner must be wary of\r\nthe easy analogy. The full, forceful application of Western ideas and\r\nvalues in a world to which they are completely irrelevant produced strange\r\nresults during the nineteenth century. Western notions of goodness and\r\nreasonableness did not fit the Chinese scheme of things. Under such a test\r\na wildly distorted image of China was obtained. China seemed peculiar,\r\ntopsy-turvy, fantastic. To themselves the Chinese still seemed quite\r\nmatter-of-fact, and the Westerners thought even this odd and ridiculous:\r\nnot only was China upside-down, but the Chinese did not know it! In any\r\ncase, the present-day scholar, to whom so much material concerning the\r\nChinese is available and China so near, has little justification for\r\napplying Western tests of virtue and rationality to things Chinese.\r\n\r\nIf the application of Western values to China is avoided, there is still\r\nthe danger that the Chinese scheme of things may not be interpreted at\r\nall. The literal translation of Chinese terms strips them of their\r\ncontexts. The result may be unintelligibility. The Chinese term _jên_ is\r\nfrequently rendered “benevolence,” a Western word which, while at times an\r\napproximate equivalent, fails to carry the full burden of meaning. Sun\r\nspeaks of an interpretation of history antagonistic to dialectical\r\nmaterialism—the interpretation of history by _jên_. A “benevolent”\r\ninterpretation of history means nothing whatever to a Westerner. If _jên_\r\nis translated into a different configuration of words, and given as\r\n“group-consciousness” or “social fellow-feeling,” the result, while still\r\nnot an exact equivalent of the Chinese, is distinctly more intelligible.\r\n\r\nTo effect this translation of ideas and values, several methods are\r\navailable. The issue cannot be dodged by a denial of its existence; the\r\nmere act of explanation involves some process, whether deliberate or\r\nunconscious, of translation and transvaluation. If the interpreter refuses\r\nto deal with the problem consciously, he will nevertheless be guided by\r\nhis unrevealed assumptions. To give an accounting for what he has done, he\r\nmust, first, admit that he is interpreting, and second, seek to make plain\r\nwhat he is doing, so that his readers may allow for the process. The\r\ndemonstration of the consequences of interpretation minimizes their\r\npossible adverse effects. The simplest way to allow for the alterations\r\n(beyond mere reproduction) arising from interpretation would be to adopt a\r\ntechnique so widely known that others could, in their own minds, try to\r\nre-trace the steps of the process and negate the changes. Among such\r\nwidely known techniques are the Marxian and the sociological.\r\n\r\nBoth these scarcely seem adapted to the problems presented by an\r\ninterpretation of Sun Yat-sen. The Marxian terminology is so peculiarly\r\nsuited to the ulterior purposes the Marxians keep in mind, and is so\r\nesoteric when applied to matters not related to the general fields in\r\nwhich the Marxians are interested, that it could scarcely be applied in\r\nthe present instance. A non-Marxian would find it a hazardous task. The\r\ninterpreter of Sun Yat-sen must interpret _into_ something; what, depends\r\non the audience. Dialectical materialism, in the abstract excellent as a\r\ntechnique, would scarcely make Sun understandable to most Americans of the\r\npresent day. Sun himself rejected the Marxian method of interpretation; an\r\nAmerican audience would also reject it; these two factors outweigh all the\r\nconceivable advantages.\r\n\r\nThe sociological technique of interpretation is quite another question.\r\nThe various methods of analysis developed by each of the schools of\r\nsociologists are still the objects rather than the tools of study. Such\r\nmen as Max Weber and Vilfredo Pareto have made contributions to Western\r\nsocial thought which enrich the scope and method of the social studies.\r\nTheir methods of analysis are not weighted down by a body of extraneous\r\nconsiderations, as is the Marxian, and they promise an objectivity not\r\notherwise attainable. On the other hand, they are still at that stage of\r\ndevelopment where the technique obtrudes itself; it has not, as has the\r\ninductive method in general, become so much taken for granted as to be\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nThe sociological approach need not, however, be carried to the full extent\r\nthought necessary by its advocates. In the study of law, the consideration\r\nof extra-juridical materials is called sociological in contrast to the\r\nstrictly juristic. If the legal scholar goes beyond the strict framework\r\nof the law, and considers other elements in man’s behavior and knowledge\r\nwhile dealing with legal problems, he is apt to be called a sociological\r\njurist. In doing so he is not committed, however, to belief in or use of\r\nany particular form of what is known as the science of society or\r\nsociology. He may adopt almost any sort of social outlook, or may be\r\ncommitted to any one of many doctrines of social value and to any one of\r\nwidely varying methods of social study.\r\n\r\nThis negative, broad sense of the sociological, when applied to the study\r\nof politics, has commonly meant that the scholars employing it began with\r\nthe notion of the political, but, finding it too narrow, touched upon\r\nrelated fields. An interpretation of Sun Yat-sen’s politics might be based\r\non this method. It would still be a political work, in that it sought to\r\nassociate his ideas with the ideas concerning government to be found in\r\nthe West, but would be free, nevertheless, to touch upon non-political\r\nmaterials relevant to Sun’s politics. The Chinese have had notions of\r\nauthority and control radically different from those developed in the\r\nWest; a purely juristic interpretation of the various Chinese politics\r\nwould simply scrape the lacquer off the screen.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have not had the sharp distinction of disciplines which runs\r\nthrough all Western learning. Since one of the most conspicuous\r\ningredients in their thought—conspicuous, that is, to Westerners looking\r\nin from outside—has been the ethical, many Westerners have dismissed\r\nChinese historical, political and more strictly philosophical thought as\r\nbeing loosely and amiably ethical but never getting anywhere. The Chinese\r\ndid not departmentalize their learning to any considerable degree.\r\nPolitics was not the special activity of a definite group of men, or the\r\nstudy of a select body of scholars. Politics ran through and across most\r\nof the activities in society, and was largely the interest of that\r\nintellectual élite by which China has been so distinguished on the roster\r\nof civilizations. In becoming everything, politics ceased being politics;\r\nthat is, those elements in man’s thought and behavior which Westerners\r\nhave termed political were not separated and labelled. The Westerner must\r\nsay that politics was everything in China, or that it was nothing.\r\n\r\nAn interpretation of Sun Yat-sen must keep in mind these differences\r\nbetween Chinese and Western categories. In doing so it will pass beyond\r\nthe limits of what is commonly known as politics, since no sharp\r\nboundaries of “politics” are to be found in China. Yet, as an\r\ninterpretation designed to serve Western readers, it must return again and\r\nagain to Western politics, making comparisons when they are justified,\r\npointing out differences between China and the West as they become\r\nrelevant and clear. The interpretation will thus weave back and forth\r\nbetween conventional Western political science, with its state-mindedness,\r\nand the wholly different material of traditions and customs out of which\r\nSun sought to construct an ideology and a system of working politics for\r\nChina in the modern world.\r\n\r\nHow can this interpretation seek to avoid the misfortunes and errors into\r\nwhich so many similar attempts have fallen? It must proceed without the\r\naid of such specialized techniques as dialectical-materialistic or\r\nParetian analysis, and yet aim at the scientific, the rationally\r\ndefensible, the objective. In seeking to apply a method in the\r\ninterpretation of Sun Yat-sen, the work must face criticism of its method,\r\nmust make the method explicit and simple enough to allow criticism. If the\r\nthought of Sun really is to emerge from the exposition, the exposition\r\nmust allow itself to be judged, so that it can be appraised, and so that,\r\none way or another, it may not interfere with the just evaluation of the\r\nmaterials which it seeks to present. Sun Yat-sen should not be judged poor\r\nbecause of a poor interpretation; nor, on the other hand, should his\r\nthought be adjudged more excellent or more exact than it seems to the\r\nChinese, merely because the expositor has suggested an interpretation\r\npossibly more precise.\r\n\r\nThe technique adopted in the present work is a relatively simple one. It\r\nis an attempt to start _de novo_ with certain concepts of society and\r\ngovernment. Several simple although novel terms are introduced, to provide\r\na foundation upon which the procedure may rest. One of these, for\r\ninstance, is “ideology,” which in the present work refers to the whole\r\npsychological conditioning of a group of persons.(23) No attempt is made,\r\nat the beginning or at any later phase of the exposition, to distinguish\r\nbetween the ideology as belief and the ideology as truth. Whether the\r\nChinese were and are right, or the Westerners, are questions, not for the\r\nstudent of comparative political science, but for the philosopher and the\r\npsychologist. The interpretation seeks, as far as possible, to transpose\r\ncertain parts of the traditional Chinese ideology, as they were, and as\r\nSun Yat-sen re-shaped them, into one frame of reference provided by the\r\nideology of twentieth-century America. What the “real truth” is, does not\r\nmatter; the Marxians would say that both ideologies were inexact; so might\r\nthe Roman Catholics. If the ideology of old China, and the ideology that\r\nSun wished to see developed in the minds of the Chinese people of the\r\nfuture, can be made comprehensible in terms of contemporary American\r\nbeliefs, of fact or of value, this venture will have been successful.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese ideology cannot be explained in its own terms; these exist\r\nonly in the Chinese language. If Sun Yat-sen’s own arrangement of his\r\nworks is inadequate for the Chinese, rearrangement is a task for the\r\nChinese and not for the Western scholars to perform. The Westerners who\r\ndeal with Sun can contribute substantially only if they give what the\r\nChinese cannot—enough of a reference to their own ideology to permit a\r\nbroader scale for the analysis and the appreciation of Sun’s thought.\r\nTheir knowledge of their own world of ideas is the special tool which\r\njustifies their intervention in this Chinese field of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn avoiding the unjustifiable imposition of Western ideas and values upon\r\nthe Chinese, and yet orienting Sun’s thought with respect to the West, the\r\ninterpretation will have to resort to several fairly evident means. In the\r\nfirst place, it will have to transpose Chinese ideas into the Western\r\nideology, and yet avoid distortions of meaning. This can be partly done by\r\nthe use of neutral terms, of terms which are simple and clear enough to\r\nreproduce the Chinese, and nevertheless not so heavily burdened with\r\nconnotations that they will cause a reading-in of Western ideas not\r\nrelevant to the point in question. More simply, the Chinese ideas must be\r\nrepresented by terms which approximate the same set of values in the West\r\nthat their originals have in China. This will sometimes require the use of\r\nunfamiliar periphrases: the words “music” and “rites” may be given as “the\r\nrhythm of life” and “conformity to the ideology.” Secondly, the Chinese\r\nideology need not be given as a whole; it is improbable that it could,\r\nwithout a terrific expansion of the Western ideology to accommodate it;\r\nbut enough of the Chinese ideology must be given to explain the\r\nsignificant differences between the Chinese system of controlling the\r\nbehavior of men, and the Western. This latter involves the choice of\r\nmaterial, and is therefore by its nature challengeable.\r\n\r\nAgain, in demonstrating significant differences instead of merely seeking\r\nanalogous (and probably misleading) examples, the interpretation might\r\nturn to certain aspects of Chinese philosophy which appear as strikingly\r\nillustrative of the point of view of the Chinese. Confucius the political\r\nthinker is only a small part of Confucius the man and the philosopher;\r\nChinese political thought, although a vast field, is only a small part of\r\nthe social thought of the Chinese. Only an infinitesimal part of this\r\ncomparatively minor area of Chinese study will suffice to make clear some,\r\nat least, of the sharp differences of outlook between China and the West.\r\n\r\nA recapitulation of this declaration of technique may be found helpful,\r\nfor an understanding of Sun Yat-sen by Westerners is necessary because of\r\nthe vastly different background of his thought. Even apart from the\r\nstrangeness of his thought to the West, it is scattered in the original,\r\nand must be pieced together. An exposition of his ideas which would, at\r\none and the same time, present a systematic outline of his ideas, and\r\ntranspose them into a frame of reference where Western scholars might\r\ngrasp them, might be a labor meriting performance. His terms would have to\r\nbe rendered by neutral words (not overladen with particular Western\r\ncontexts) or by neologisms, or simply left in the original, to develop\r\nmeaning as a configuration of related ideas is built up about them. The\r\nproblem of interpretation cannot, however, be solved by settling the\r\ndifficulty of language: there still remains the question of a technique\r\nwhich can pretend to the scientific, the exact, the rationally defensible.\r\nDespite their great merits, the Marxian and Paretian techniques are not\r\nsuited to the present task. The point of view and means of study of\r\npolitical science may be kept, if a few necessary borrowings from\r\nsociological thought (not necessarily sociology) are introduced. Such\r\nborrowing includes the use of notions such as non-political society,\r\npatterns of authority, and ideology, none of which are to be found in the\r\nmore law-minded part of political science. By seeking to point out the\r\nChinese, then the Western, ideas involved, without confusing the two, the\r\npresentation may succeed in transposing the ideology of Sun Yat-sen, as\r\nwell as his beliefs concerning working politics, into the English language\r\nand into an explanatory but not distorting background. To do this, a small\r\nsampling of certain aspects of old Chinese social thought and behavior\r\nwill be a required preliminary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE IDEOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rationale of the Readjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _San Min Chu I_ and related works of Sun Yat-sen represent in their\r\nentirety one of the most ambitious bodies of doctrine ever set forth by a\r\npolitical leader. They differ from such a document as the Communist\r\nManifesto in that they comprehend a much greater range of subject matter\r\nand deal with it in much greater detail. They pertain not merely to the\r\nreconstitution of an economic or political system; they propose a plan for\r\nthe reconstruction of a whole civilization, the reformation of a way of\r\nthought customary among a great part of the human race, and a consequent\r\ntransformation of men’s behavior. Conceived in the bold flights of a\r\npenetrating, pioneering mind, avowedly experimental at the time of their\r\nfirst utterance, these works of Sun have already played a most significant\r\nrôle in the Far East and may continue to affect history for a long time to\r\ncome. They may quite legitimately be called the bible of new China.\r\n\r\nSocial change is a consequence of maladjustment. The thought of Sun\r\nYat-sen is a program of change—change which, if it is to be understood,\r\nmust be seen at its beginning and its end. The background from which Sun\r\nemerged and which was an implicit condition of all his utterances must be\r\nmentioned, so that the problems he faced may be understood. Only then will\r\nit be possible to turn to the plans he devised for the rethinking of\r\nChinese tradition and the reorganization of Chinese polity. A vast\r\nmaladjustment between the Chinese and the world outside led to the\r\ndownfall of the Manchu Empire in China and has threatened the stability of\r\nevery government erected since that time; Chinese society is in a state of\r\nprofound unrest and recurrent turmoil. Sun Yat-sen contributed to the\r\nchange, and sought a new order, to be developed from the disorder which,\r\nvoluntarily or not, he helped in part to bring about.\r\n\r\nThe old order that failed, the _interregnum_ (in the etymological sense of\r\nthe word), and the new order proposed by Sun must be taken all together in\r\norder to obtain a just understanding of Sun’s thought. No vast history\r\nneed be written, no _Decline and Fall of the Chinese Empire_ is necessary,\r\nbut some indication of the age-old foundations and proximate conditions of\r\nSun’s thought must be obtained.\r\n\r\nThese may, perhaps, be found in a sampling of certain data from the\r\nthought and behavior of the Chinese as a group under the old system, and\r\nthe selection of a few important facts from the history of China since the\r\nfirst stages of the maladjustment. An exposition of Sun’s thought must not\r\nslur the great importance of the past, yet it dare not linger too long on\r\nthis theme lest the present—in which, after all, uncounted millions of\r\nChinese are desperately struggling for life—come to seem insignificant.\r\n\r\nConfucianism is a philosophy so broad and so highly developed that any\r\nselection does violence to its balance and proportion, which are among its\r\nchief merits.(24) Yet only those few facts can be taken from the history\r\nand thought of the Chinese which may assist the Westerner in becoming\r\nfamiliar with a few terms which recur again and again in the works of Sun\r\nYat-sen. If the present work purported to be a study of Chinese history,\r\nor a complete analysis of the Chinese social system, such an extreme\r\nselectivity could not be condoned; since it, however, tries only to\r\noutline Sun’s thought, the selection of a few Confucian doctrines and the\r\ncomplete ignoring of others, may be forgiven. All the schools of the past,\r\nand the literary traditions which developed from them, and social\r\ntendencies that were bound up with these have to be omitted, and those few\r\nideas and customs described which bear directly on one single point—the\r\nmost significant ideological differences between the Chinese and the West\r\nwith respect to the political order, i. e. the control of men in society\r\nin the name of all society.(25)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNation and State in Chinese Antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Confucian system, against which Sun Yat-sen reacted in part and in\r\npart sought to preserve, was a set of ideas and institutions developed as\r\na reaction against certain conditions in ancient China. These conditions\r\nmay be roughly described as having arisen from a system of\r\nproto-nationalisms, at a time when the old—perhaps prehistorically\r\nancient—Chinese feudal system was rapidly declining and an early form of\r\ncapitalism and of states was taking its place. The Chou dynasty (ca.\r\n1150-221 B.C.) was in power at the time of this transition; under its rule\r\nthe golden age of Chinese philosophy appeared—Confucius (552-479 B.C.) and\r\nLao Tzŭ (ca. 570-ca. 490 B.C.) lived and taught.\r\n\r\nTheir philosophies, contrary to the popular Western beliefs concerning\r\nChinese philosophies, were protests against a world which seemed to them\r\nwell-nigh intolerable. The old Chinese system, which may seem to\r\nWesterners a highly mystical feudal organization, was in its century-long\r\ndeath-agonies; the virtues it had taught were not the virtues of the hour;\r\nthe loyalties it had set up were loyalties which could scarcely be\r\nmaintained in a time when rising states, acting more and more as states\r\nhave acted in the West, were disrupting the earlier organization of\r\nsociety, waging struggles—in the manner that, centuries later, Machiavelli\r\nwas to portray—of intrigue and warfare for the eventual hegemony over that\r\nwhole area of eastern Asia which the Chinese of that time regarded as the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nThe political aspects of the transition from the feudal to the\r\nproto-national system is described by one of the most eminent of the\r\nWestern authorities on China in the following terms: “The aim of all the\r\nLeaders was to control western Ho-nan. There is the heart of ancient\r\nChina.... All around about, in vaster regions occupied no doubt by less\r\ndense and more shifting populations, great States formed, increasing first\r\ntowards the exterior, seeking (as we have seen in the case of China) to\r\ncut the communication of their rivals with the Barbarians, mutually\r\nforcing each other to change the directions of the expansion, exercising\r\non each other a pressure from behind, and a converging pressure on the\r\ncentral overlordships. All schemed to conquer them. Thus an amalgamation\r\nwas achieved. Whilst in the centre the Chinese nation was coming into\r\nbeing, on the outer borders States were being formed which, aiming at\r\nannexing the centre of China, ended by themselves also becoming\r\nChinese.”(26) Not only did the newer, political organization of society\r\nbegin to make itself distinct from the family, feudal, and religious\r\norganization; it began to engage in activities which increased its\r\nresemblance to the Western system of nations. Tributes of textiles,\r\nhorses, and compulsory labor were demanded. A non-feudal economy was\r\nencouraged; the state of Ch’i encouraged artisans and merchants, and\r\nfavored the trade in fish and salt. Mining, metallurgy and currency were\r\nstudied. State monopolies were created out of the products of forests,\r\nlakes, marshes, shell-fish beds, and salt pans. Mines also became\r\n“treasures of the state.”(27)\r\n\r\nThe history of these states reads like a page torn out of the history of\r\nearly modern Europe. The struggle was half diplomatic and half military.\r\nFrom the beginning of the Spring and Autumn period (722-481 B.C.) to the\r\nend of the Age of Warring States (491-221 B.C.), China was subject to\r\nfrequent war and unstable peace. The character of war itself changed, from\r\na chivalrous exercise almost ritualistic in nature, to a struggle of\r\nunrestricted force. The units of government which were to develop into\r\nstates, and almost into nations, began as feudal overlordships;\r\ntraditional hatreds and sentiments were developed; diplomatic and military\r\npolicies crystallized and became consistent; and activities of a state\r\nnature became increasingly prominent.\r\n\r\nConcurrently, other factors operated to prevent an indefinite continuance\r\nof these struggles of proto-national states and to avoid the appearance of\r\na permanent system of armed nations such as that which has appeared in\r\nmodern Europe. The feudal system of China left a strong ethnical,\r\nlinguistic and intellectual heritage of unity, which was stronger than the\r\ncultural disunities and particularities appearing in certain of the\r\nstates. (The state of Chêng was particularly conspicuous in developing a\r\npeculiar state culture.)(28) As the states became larger and larger with\r\nthe passing of time, they tended not only to develop certain large\r\ndifferences between themselves, but to eradicate the minute local\r\npeculiarities of the old system, and in so doing to increase the general\r\nhomogeneity which was also a heritage of the past ages. This general\r\nhomogeneity found a living symbol in the persons of the Chou Emperors who,\r\npossessed of no more power than the Tennos under the Shogunate, acted, as\r\ndid their Japanese analogues two thousand years later, as the\r\nquasi-religious personifications of the whole general community. It thus\r\noccurred that the old feudal system was destroyed by the growth of a\r\ngeneral non-feudal economy and political order, which, in its turn, led to\r\nthe development of the great imperial system under which China continued\r\nfor many centuries. The period of the transition, during which the\r\ntraditional feudal unity had been shaken and the new imperial unity not\r\nyet established, was a tumultuous and bloody one. The presence of a\r\nconfederation under the hegemony of some one state—the so-called\r\nPresidency—provided a suitable framework for rivalries toward power,\r\nwithout particularly increasing the general peace.\r\n\r\nThe transition, as it took place, was neither apparent nor agreeable. The\r\npolitical turmoil was but slightly less than the intellectual unrest and\r\ndisturbance. Everywhere faith and acceptance seemed to have been lost to\r\nhumanity; licentiousness and impiety fed discord. The lack of harmony,\r\nmade doubly vivid by the presence of a strong tradition of primeval\r\nArcadian peace and unity under the mythological Emperors, was bitter to\r\nthe scholars and men of virtue of the time. It was quite inevitable that\r\nprotests should be raised which would hasten the advent, or return, of\r\nunity and peace. These protests form the subject of the work of Confucius\r\nand the other great philosophers, and schools of thinkers, of the Chou\r\ndynasty. It was, in later ages, upon these philosophies that the great\r\nstructure of Chinese society developed and continued down until modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Theory of the Confucian World-Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various types of protest against the development of states and the\r\nconsequent anarchy of the Chinese society considered as a whole cannot be\r\nconsidered in this work; many were primarily religious; Taoism, while\r\nranking as one of the most conspicuous religions of the world, has little\r\nbearing on politics. Even Confucianism, which merits careful study, must\r\nbe summarized and re-stated as briefly as possible. Confucianism has\r\nsuffered from an ambiguity and exoticism of terms, when presented to the\r\nWest; its full significance as a political philosophy can become fully\r\napparent only when it is rendered in the words of the hour.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that Confucius did in protest against the established discord\r\nof the world he knew? He struck directly at the foundations of politics.\r\nHis criticisms and remedies can be fully appreciated only by reference to\r\na theory of ideology.\r\n\r\nConfucius perceived that the underlying problem of society was that of\r\nideology; he seems to have realized that the character of a society itself\r\nessentially depends upon the character of the moral ideas generally\r\nprevalent among the individuals composing it, and that where there is no\r\ncommon body of ideas a society can scarcely be said to exist.(29) He did\r\nnot consider, as did Han Fei-tzŭ and the legalist school of philosophers,\r\nquestions of law the preëminent social problem. He realized that state and\r\nlaw were remedies, and that the prime questions of organization were those\r\nanterior to the political, and that the state existed for the purpose of\r\nfilling out the shortcomings of social harmony.(30)\r\n\r\nIn a society—such as Confucius dreamed of—where there was no disagreement\r\nin outlook, policy would not be a governmental question; if there were no\r\ndisharmony of thought and of behavior, there would be no necessity of\r\nenforcing conformance to the generally accepted criteria of conduct. From\r\nthis standpoint, government itself is socially pathological, a remedy for\r\na poorly ordered society. Men are controlled indirectly by the examples of\r\nvirtue; they do good because they have learned to do good and do it\r\nunquestioningly and simply. Whatever control is exercised over men is\r\nexercised by their ideology, and if other men desire control they must\r\nseek it through shaping the ideas of others. At its full expression, such\r\na doctrine would not lead to mere anarchy; but it would eliminate the\r\npolitical altogether from the culture of man, replacing it with an\r\neducational process. Ideological control would need to be supplemented by\r\npolitical only if it failed to cover the total range of social behavior,\r\nand left loopholes for conflict and dispute.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is framed in quite different terms by Confucius, who spoke\r\nand wrote in an age when the mystical elements of the old feudal ideology\r\nstill exercised powerful and persuasive influence, and when there was no\r\nother society than his own which he might make the object of his study.\r\nThe central point of his teachings is the doctrine of _jên_. Liang\r\nCh’i-ch’ao, one of the most brilliant modern exponents of ancient Chinese\r\nphilosophy, wrote of this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the simplest terms, “Jen” means fellow-feeling for one’s kind.\r\n    Once Fan Chih, one of his disciples, asked Confucius what “Jen”\r\n    meant. Confucius replied, “To love fellow-men”; in other words\r\n    this means to have a feeling of sympathy toward mankind....\r\n\r\n    Intellectually the relationship becomes common purpose;\r\n    emotionally it takes the form of fellow-feeling.(31)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doctrine appears more specific in its application when it is realized\r\nthat Confucius regarded his own society and mankind as coterminous.\r\nBarbarians, haunting the fringes of the world, were unconscious of _jên_;\r\nnot being in sympathy with mankind, they were not as yet fully human.\r\n\r\n_Jên_ is a word which cannot be exactly translated into English. It is\r\nladen with a burden of connotations which it has acquired through the\r\ncenturies; its variability of translation may be shown by the fact that,\r\nin the standard translations of the Chinese classics, it is written\r\n“Benevolence.” It might equally well be given as “consciousness of one’s\r\nplace and function in society.” The man who followed _jên_ was one who was\r\naware of his place in society, and of his participation in the common\r\nendeavors of mankind.\r\n\r\n_Jên_, or society-mindedness, leads to an awareness of virtue and\r\npropriety (_têh_ and _yi_). When virtue and propriety exist, it is\r\nobligatory that men follow them. Behavior in accordance with virtue and\r\npropriety is _li_. Commonly translated “ethics,” this is seen as the\r\nfruition of the force of _jên_ in human society. _Jên_ underlies and\r\nestablishes society, from the existence of which spring virtue and\r\npropriety; these prescribe principles for human conduct, the formulation\r\nof which rules is _li_.(32) Auxiliary to _li_ is _chêng ming_. _Chêng\r\nming_ is the rightness of names: _li_, the appropriateness of\r\nrelationships. _Li_, it may be noted, is also translated “rites” or\r\n“ceremonies”; a rendering which, while not inexact, fails to convey the\r\nfull import of the term.\r\n\r\n_Chêng ming_, the rectification of names, may be regarded as a protest\r\nagainst the discords in language that had developed during the\r\ntransitional period from feudalism to eventual unity. Confucius, of\r\ncourse, did not have as sharp an issue confronting him as do the modern\r\nWestern innovators in social and political ideology. Nevertheless, the\r\nlinguistic difficulty was clear to him. The expansion of the Chinese\r\nwritten language was so great at that time that it led to the\r\nindiscriminate coining of neologisms, and there was a tendency towards a\r\nsophisticated hypocrisy in the use of words.(33)\r\n\r\nConfucius saw that, in obtaining harmony, language needed to be exact;\r\notherwise long and fruitless disputes over empty words might be engaged in\r\nor, what was even worse, words might not conform to the realities of\r\nsocial life, and might be used as instruments of ill-doing. Confucius did\r\nnot, however, present a scheme of word-worship. He wanted communication to\r\ncement society, to be an instrument of concord. He wanted, in modern\r\nterms, a terminology which by its exactness and suitability would of\r\nitself lead to harmony.(34) In advocating the rectification of names,\r\nConfucius differed from many other founders of philosophies and religions;\r\nthey, too, wanted names rectified—terminology reorganized—to suit their\r\nparticular doctrines; but there they stopped short. Confucius regarded the\r\nrectification of names as a continuous process, one which had to be\r\ncarried on unceasingly if communication, for the sake of social harmony,\r\nwas to remain just and exact.\r\n\r\n_Chêng ming_ is highly significant in Confucian thought, and exhibits the\r\nstriking difference between the Chinese and the older Western political\r\nstudy. If the terms by means of which the communication within a society\r\nis effected, and in which the group beliefs of fact or of value are to be\r\nfound, can be the subject of control, there is opened up a great field of\r\nsocial engineering. _Chêng ming_ states, in recognizable although archaic\r\nterms, the existence of ideology, and proposes the strengthening of\r\nideology. In recognizing the group (in his case, mankind) as dependent\r\nupon ideology for group existence, Confucius delivered Chinese political\r\nthought from any search for an ontology of the _real state_. It became\r\npossible to continue, in the traditional pragmatic manner,(35) thinking of\r\nmen in simple terms referring only to individual men, avoiding the\r\nhypostatizations common in the West. In pointing out the necessity for the\r\ncontrol of ideology by men, Confucius anticipated theories of the\r\n“pedagogical state” by some twenty centuries.\r\n\r\n_Li_, in the terminology of the present work, is the conformity of the\r\nindividual to the moral ideology, or, stated in another manner, the\r\ncontrol of men by the ideology.(36)\r\n\r\n_Li_, conformity to the ideology, implies, of course, conformity to those\r\nparts of it which determine value. _Li_ prescribes the do-able, the\r\nthinkable. In so far as the ideology consists of valuations, so far do\r\nthose valuations determine _li_. Hsü lists the operations of _li_ in six\r\nspecific categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) it furnishes the principles of political organization; (2) it\r\n    furnishes details for the application of the doctrine of\r\n    ratification; (3) it discusses the functions of government; (4) it\r\n    prescribes the limitations of governmental authority; (5) it\r\n    advances principles of social administration; and (6) it provides\r\n    a foundation for crime and lawsuits. These are only the political\r\n    functions of _li_. Its force is to be regarded as equally\r\n    effective in every other type of human behavior.(37)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe approach to society contained in the doctrines of _jên_, _chêng ming_,\r\nand _li_ is, therefore, one which largely eliminates the necessity for\r\npolitics. Its influence may be estimated from three points of view: (1) to\r\nwhat degree was government different from what it might have been had it\r\nfollowed the line of development that government did in the West? (2) what\r\nwas the range of governmental action in such a system? and (3) what was\r\nthe relation of government to the other institutions of a Confucian\r\nsociety?\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first point, it will be seen immediately that government,\r\nonce _chêng ming_ has been set in motion, is not a policy-making body.\r\nThere is no question of policy, no room for disagreement, no alternative.\r\nWhat is right is apparent. Politics, in the narrow sense of the word,\r\nceases to be a function of government; only administration remains.\r\n\r\nSecondly, government needs to administer only for two purposes. The chief\r\nof these is the maintenance of the ideology. Once right views are\r\nestablished, no individual is entitled to think otherwise. Government must\r\ntreat the heterodox as malefactors. Their crime is greater than ordinary\r\ncrime, which is a mere violation of right behavior; they pollute right\r\nthought, set in motion the forces of discord, and initiate evils which may\r\nwork on and on through the society, even after the evil-thinkers\r\nthemselves are dead. To protect the society actively against discord, the\r\ngovernment must encourage the utterance of the accepted truth. The scholar\r\nis thus the highest of all the social classes; it is he who maintains\r\nagreement and order. The government becomes, in maintaining the ideology,\r\nthe educational system. The whole political life is education, formal or\r\ninformal. Every act of the leader is a precept and an example. The ruler\r\ndoes not compel virtue by law; he spreads it by his conspicuous example.\r\n\r\nThe other function of the government in maintaining the ideology lies in\r\nthe necessity of dealing with persons not affected by the ideology.\r\nBarbarians are especially formidable, since both heretics and criminals\r\nmay be restored to the use of their reason, while barbarians may not, so\r\nlong as they remain barbarians. Accordingly, the government is also a\r\ndefense system. It is a defense against open and physical disruption from\r\nwithin—as in the case of insurrectionaries or bandits—and a defense\r\nagainst forces from without which, as veritable powers of darkness, cannot\r\nbe taught and are amenable only to brute force.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the third point, government itself appears as subject\r\nto _li_. It has no right to do wrong. The truth is apparent to everyone,\r\nand especially to the scholars. In this wise the Chinese governments were\r\nat the mercy of their subjects. No divine right shielded them when public\r\nopinion condemned them; ill-doing governments were twice guilty and\r\ncontemptible, because of the great force of their examples. An evil\r\nemperor was not only a criminal; he was a heresiarch, leading many astray,\r\nand corrupting the virtue upon which society rested—virtue being the\r\nmaintenance of a true and moral ideology, and conformity to it.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of these teachings was such that we may say, without\r\nsacrificing truth to paradox, that the aim of Chinese government was\r\nanarchy—not in the sense of disorder, but in the sense of an order so just\r\nand so complete that it needed no governing. The _laissez-faire_ of the\r\nChinese was not only economic; it was political. The Great Harmony of\r\nConfucius, which was his Utopia, was conceived of as a society where the\r\nexcellence of ideology and the thoroughness of conformity to ideology had\r\nbrought perfect virtue, perfect happiness.\r\n\r\nThe other doctrines of Confucius, his practical teachings on\r\nstatesmanship, his discourses on the family—these cannot be entered into\r\nhere. Enough has, perhaps, been shown to demonstrate the thoroughness of\r\nConfucius’ reaction against state and nation.(38) This reaction was to\r\ncontinue, and to become so typical that the whole Chinese system of\r\nsubsequent centuries was called Confucian,(39) until the exigencies of a\r\nnewer, larger, and more perilous world led to Sun Yat-sen’s teaching of\r\nmodern Chinese nationalism. Before taking up the doctrine of _min tsu_, it\r\nmay be worthwhile to summarize the manner in which Chinese society,\r\ndeliberately and accidentally, each in part, followed out the doctrines of\r\nConfucius in its practical organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese World-Society of Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be, of course, absurd to pretend to analyze the social system of\r\nChina in a few paragraphs; and yet it is necessary to the study of Sun\r\nYat-sen that certain characteristics be at least mentioned. Several\r\nproblems appear which are quite outstanding. What was the social position\r\nand function of each individual? How were refractory individuals to be\r\ndisciplined in accordance with the requirements that the general opinion\r\nof society imposed? What were the ultimate ends which the organization of\r\nChinese society was to realize? How were the educational system and the\r\nfrontier defenses to be maintained? What was to be the position and power\r\nof the political organization?\r\n\r\nAt the outset it is necessary that a working demarcation of the political\r\nbe established. Accepting, by definition, those coercive controls as\r\npolitical which are operated for the preservation of society as a whole,\r\nand are recognized within the society as so doing, we see immediately that\r\nthe range of the political must have been much less in old China than it\r\nhas been in the West. Western societies tend, at least in law, to\r\nemphasize the relationship between the individual and the society as a\r\nwhole; free and unassociated individuals tend to become extraordinarily\r\nunstable. In the old Chinese society the control of the individual was so\r\nmuch an ideological one, that political control was infinitely narrower\r\nthan in the West. But, in order to effectuate ideological control, there\r\nmust be an organization which will permit pressure to be exercised on the\r\nindividual in such a compelling manner that the exercise of external\r\ncoercion becomes unnecessary. In a society in which the state has withered\r\naway, after an enormous expansion in the subject-matter of its\r\ncontrol,(40) the totalitarian state is succeeded by the totalitarian\r\ntradition, if—and the qualification is an important one—the indoctrination\r\nhas been so effective that the ideology can maintain itself in the minds\r\nof men without the continuing coercive power of the state to uphold it. If\r\nthe ideology is secure, then control of the individual will devolve upon\r\nthose persons making up his immediate social environment, who—in view of\r\nthe uniform and secure notions of right and justice prevailing—can be\r\nrelied upon to attend to him in a manner which will be approved by the\r\nsociety in general.\r\n\r\nIn China the groups most conspicuous within the society were the family\r\nsystem, the village and district, and the _hui_ (association; league;\r\nsociety, in the everyday sense of the word).\r\n\r\nThe family was an intricate structure. A fairly typical instance of family\r\norganization within a specific village has been described in the following\r\nterms: “The village is occupied by one sib, a uni-lateral kinship group,\r\nexogamous, monogamous but polygynous, composed of a plurality of kin\r\nalignments into four families: the natural family, the economic-family,\r\nthe religious-family, and the sib.”(41) The natural family corresponded to\r\nthe family of the West. The economic family may have had a natural family\r\nas its core, but commonly extended through several degrees of kinship, and\r\nmay have included from thirty to one hundred persons, who formed a single\r\neconomic unit, living and consuming collectively. The religious family was\r\nan aggregate of economic families, of which it would be very difficult to\r\ngive any specified number as an average. It was religious in that it\r\nprovided the organization for the proper commemoration and reverence of\r\nancestors, and maintained an ancestral shrine where the proper\r\ngenealogical records could be kept; the cult feature has largely\r\ndisappeared in modern times. The sib corresponded roughly to the clan,\r\nfound in some Western communities; its rôle was determined by the\r\nimmediate environment. In some cases—as especially in the south—the sib\r\nwas powerful enough to engage in feuds; at times one or more sibs\r\ndominated whole communities; in the greater part of China it was a loose\r\norganization, holding meetings from time to time to unite the various\r\nlocal religious families which constituted it.\r\n\r\nFamily consciousness played its part in sustaining certain elements of the\r\nConfucian ideology. It stressed the idea of the carnal immortality of the\r\nhuman race; it oriented the individual, not only philosophically, but\r\nsocially as well. The size of each family determined his position\r\nspatially, and family continuity fixed a definite location in time for\r\nhim. With its many-handed grasp upon the individual, the family system\r\nheld him securely in place and prevented his aspiring to the arrogant\r\nheights of nobility or falling to the degradation of a slavery in which he\r\nmight become a mere commodity. A Chinese surrounded by his kinsmen was\r\nshielded against humiliations inflicted upon him by outsiders or the\r\nmenace of his own potential follies. It was largely through the family\r\nsystem, with its religious as well as economic and social foundation, that\r\nthe Chinese solved the problem of adequate mobility of individuals in a\r\nsociety stable as a whole, and gave to that stability a clear and\r\nundeniable purpose—the continued generation of the human race through the\r\ncontinuity of a multitude of families, each determined upon survival.\r\n\r\nThe family was the most obviously significant of the groupings within the\r\nsociety, but it was equalled if not excelled in importance by the\r\nvillage.(42)\r\n\r\nHad the family been the only important social grouping, it might have been\r\nimpossible for any democracy to develop in China. It so occurred that the\r\nfamily pattern provided, indeed, the model for the government, but the\r\nimportance of villages in Chinese life negated the too sharp influence of\r\na familistic government. It would have been the most awful heresy, as it\r\nis in Japan today, to revolt against and depose an unrighteous father;\r\nthere was nothing to prevent the deposition or destruction of an evil\r\nvillage elder. In times of concord, the Emperor was the father of the\r\nsociety; at other times, when his rule was less successful, he was a\r\nfellow-villager subject to the criticism of the people.\r\n\r\nThe village was the largest working unit of non-political administration;\r\nthat is to say, groups within and up to the village were almost completely\r\nautonomous and not subject to interference, except in very rare cases,\r\nfrom outside. The village was the smallest unit of the political. The\r\nDistrict Magistrate, as the lowest officer in the political-educational\r\nsystem, was in control of a district containing from one to twenty\r\nvillages, and negotiated, in performing the duties imposed upon him, with\r\nthe village leaders. The villages acted as self-ruling communes, at times\r\nvery democratic.(43)\r\n\r\nNext in importance, among Chinese social groups, after the family and the\r\nvillage was the _hui_. It was in all probability the last to appear.\r\nNeither ordained, as the family seemed to be, by the eternal physical and\r\nbiological order of things, nor made to seem natural, as was the village,\r\nby the geographic and economic environment, the association found its\r\njustification in the deeply ingrained propensities of the Chinese to\r\ncoöperate. Paralleling and supplementing the former two, the _hui_ won for\r\nitself a definite and unchallenged place in the Chinese social structure.\r\nThe kinds of _hui_ may be classified into six categories:(44) 1) the\r\nfraternal societies; 2) insurance groups; 3) economic guilds; 4) religious\r\nsocieties; 5) political societies; and 6) organizations of militia and\r\nvigilantes. The _hui_ made up, in their economic form, the greater part of\r\nthe economic organization of old China, and provided the system of\r\nvocational education for persons not destined to literature and\r\nadministration. Politically, it was the _hui_—under such names as the\r\nTriad and the Lotus—that provided the party organizations of old China and\r\nchallenged the dynasties whenever objectionable social or economic\r\nconditions developed.\r\n\r\nThe old Chinese society, made up of innumerable families, villages, and\r\n_hui_, comprised a whole “known world.” Its strength was like that of a\r\ndinosaur in modern fable; having no one nerve-centre, the world-society\r\ncould not be destroyed by inroads of barbarians, or the ravages of famine,\r\npestilence, and insurrection. The ideology which has been called Confucian\r\ncontinued. At no one time were conditions so bad as to break the many\r\nthreads of Chinese culture and to release a new generation of persons\r\nemancipated from the tradition. Throughout the centuries education and\r\ngovernment went forward, even though dynasties fell and the whole country\r\nwas occasionally over-run by conquerors. The absence of any juristically\r\nrigid organization permitted the Chinese to maintain a certain minimum of\r\norder, even in the absence of an emperor, or, as more commonly occurred,\r\nin the presence of several.\r\n\r\nThe governmental superstructure cemented the whole Chinese world together\r\nin a formal manner; it did not create it. The family, the village, and the\r\n_hui_ were fit subjects for imperial comment, but there was nothing in\r\ntheir organization to persuade the student that the Emperor—by virtue of\r\nsome Western-type _Kompetenz Kompetenz_—could remove his sanction from\r\ntheir existence and thereby annihilate them. There was no precarious legal\r\npersonality behind the family, the village, and the _hui_, which could be\r\ndestroyed by a stroke of law. It was possible for the English kings to\r\ndestroy the Highland clan of the MacGregor—“the proscribed name”—without\r\nliquidating the members of the clan _in toto_. In China the Emperor beheld\r\na family as a quasi-individual, and when enraged at them was prone to wipe\r\nthem out with massacre. Only in a very few cases was it possible for him\r\nto destroy an organization without destroying the persons composing it; he\r\ncould, for example, remove the privilege of a scholarship system from a\r\ndistrict, prefecture, or province without necessarily disposing of all the\r\nscholars involved in the move. The government of China—which, in the\r\nnormal run of affairs, had no questions of policy, because policy was\r\ntraditional and inviolable—continued to be an administration dedicated to\r\nthree main ends—the maintenance of the ideology (education), the defense\r\nof the society as a whole against barbarians (military affairs) and\r\nagainst the adverse forces of nature (public works on the most\r\nextensive—and not intensive—scale), and the collection of funds for the\r\nfulfillment of the first two ends (revenue). The Emperor was also the\r\ntitular family head of the Chinese world.\r\n\r\nThe educational system was identical with the administrative, except in\r\nthe case of the foreign dynasties. (Under the Manchus, for example, a\r\ncertain quota of Manchu officials were assigned throughout the government,\r\nirrespective of their scholastic rank in contrast to the Chinese.) It was\r\na civil service, an educational structure, and a ritualist organization.\r\nSelected from the people at large, scholars could—at least in\r\ntheory—proceed on the basis of sheer merit to any office in the Empire\r\nexcepting the Throne. Their advancement was graduated on a very elaborate\r\nscale of degrees, which could be attained only by the passing of\r\nexaminations involving an almost perfect knowledge of the literature of\r\nantiquity and the ability to think in harmony with and reproduce that\r\nliterature. The Chinese scholar-official had to learn to do his own\r\nthinking by means of the clichés which he could learn from the classics;\r\nhe had to make every thought and act of his life conform to the pattern of\r\nthe ideology. Resourceful men may have found in this a proper\r\nfortification for their originality, as soon as they were able to cloak it\r\nwith the expressions of respect; mediocre persons were helpless beyond the\r\nbounds of what they had learned.\r\n\r\nThe combination of education and administration had one particular very\r\nstabilizing effect upon Chinese society. It made literacy and rulership\r\nidentical. Every educated man was either a government official or expected\r\nto become one. There was no hostile scholar class, no break with the\r\ntradition. Struggle between scholars generally took the form of conflicts\r\nbetween cliques and were not founded—except in rare instances—on any\r\ncleavage of ideas. The Throne secured its own position and the continuity\r\nof the ideology through establishing intellectuality as a government\r\nmonopoly. The consequences of the educational-administrative system\r\nfostered democratic tendencies quite as much as they tended to maintain\r\nthe status quo. The scholars were all men, and Chinese, owing allegiance\r\nto families and to native districts. In this manner a form of\r\nrepresentation was assured the government which kept it from losing touch\r\nwith the people, and which permitted the people to exercise influence upon\r\nthe government in the advancement of any special interests that could\r\nprofit by government assistance. The educational system also served as the\r\nsubstitute for a nobility. Hereditary class distinctions existed in China\r\non so small a scale that they amounted to nothing. The way to power was\r\nthrough the educational hierarchy.(45) In a society which offered no\r\nfinancial or military short cuts to power, and which had no powerful\r\nnobility to block the way upward, the educational system provided an\r\nupward channel of social mobility which was highly important in the\r\norganization of the Chinese world order.\r\n\r\nThe scholars, once they had passed the examinations, were given either\r\nsubsistence allowances or posts, according to the rank which they had\r\nsecured in the tests. (This was, of course, the theory; in actuality\r\nbribery and nepotism played rôles varying with the time and the locality.)\r\nThey made up the administration of the civilized world. They were not only\r\nthe officials but the literati.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible even to enumerate the many posts and types of\r\norganization in the administration of imperial China.(46) Its most\r\nconspicuous features may be enumerated as follows: China consisted of half\r\na million cities, towns, villages, and hamlets, each to a large extent\r\nautonomous.(47) These were divided among, roughly, two thousand _hsien_,\r\nin each of which an over-burdened District Magistrate sought to carry out\r\nall the recognized functions of government in so far as they applied to\r\nhis locality. He did this largely by negotiation with the leaders of the\r\nsocial groups in his bailiwick, the heads of families, the elders of\r\nvillages, the functionaries of _hui_. He was supervised by a variety of\r\ntravelling prefects and superintendents, but the next officer above him\r\nwho possessed a high degree of independence was the viceroy or\r\ngovernor—whichever type happened to rule the province or group of\r\nprovinces. Except for their non-hereditability, these last offices were to\r\nall intents and purposes satrapies. The enormous extent of the Chinese\r\ncivilized world, the difficulty of communicating with the capital, the\r\ncumbersomeness of the administrative organization, the rivalry and\r\nunfriendliness between the inhabitants of various provinces—all these\r\nencouraged independence of a high degree. If Chinese society was divided\r\ninto largely autonomous communes, the Chinese political system was made up\r\nof largely autonomous provinces. Everywhere there was elasticity.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the whole structure stood the Emperor. In the mystical\r\ndoctrines which Confucianism transmitted from the animism of the feudal\r\nages of China, the Emperor was the intermediary between the forces of\r\nnature and mankind. The Son of Heaven became the chief ritualist; in more\r\nsophisticated times he was the patron of civilization to the scholars, and\r\nthe object of supernatural veneration to the uneducated. His function was\r\nto provide a constant pattern of propriety. He was to act as chief of the\r\nscholars. To the scholars the ideology was recognized as an ideology,\r\nalbeit the most exact one; to the common people it was an objective\r\nreality of thought and value. As the dictates of reason were not subject\r\nto change, the power and the functions of the Emperor were delimited; he\r\nwas not, therefore, responsible to himself alone. He was responsible to\r\nreason, which the people could enforce when the Emperor failed. Popular\r\nintervention was regarded as _de jure_ in proportion to its effectiveness\r\n_de facto_. The Imperial structure might be called, in Western terms, the\r\nconstitutionalism of common sense.(48) The Dragon Throne did not enjoy the\r\nmysterious and awful prestige which surrounds the modern Tenno of Nippon;\r\nalthough sublime in the Confucian theory, it was, even in the theory, at\r\nthe mercy of its subjects, who were themselves the arbiters of reason.\r\nThere was no authority higher than reason; and no reason beyond the reason\r\ndiscovered and made manifest in the ages of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Impact of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nMere physical shock could not derange the old Chinese society as easily as\r\nit might some other, dependent for its stability upon complex, fragile\r\npolitical mechanisms. China was over-run many times by barbarians; the\r\ncontinuity of its civilization was undisturbed. Each group of conquerors\r\nadded to the racial composition of the Chinese, but contributed little to\r\nthe culture. The Ch’in, the Mongols, the Manchus—all ruled China as\r\nChinese rulers.\r\n\r\nThis strength of the Chinese society—in contrast to the Roman—must not,\r\nhowever, lead us to suppose that there were any extraordinary virtues in\r\nthe Chinese social organization that made Chinese civilization\r\nindestructible. On the contrary, the continued life of the Chinese society\r\nmay be ascribed, among others, to four conditions acting definitely and\r\noverwhelmingly in its favor: China’s greater physical extent, homogeneity,\r\nwealth, and culture.\r\n\r\nNo barbarian conqueror, with the possible exception of the Mongol, would\r\nhave been a match for an orderly and united China. Without exception, the\r\nbarbarian incursions occurred in times of social and political disorder\r\nand weakness. That this is no freakish coincidence, may be shown by the\r\ncontrast between China and any of the peripheral realms. None approached\r\nChina in extent, in heaviness of population. Conquest of China was always\r\nconquest by sufferance of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nSecond, China’s neighbors were divided among themselves. There was never\r\nany coalition extensive enough to present a genuine threat to a thriving\r\nChina. The Chinese, in spite of diversities of spoken language, were\r\nunited—so far as they were literate—by a common writing and literature;\r\nthe common ideology had, moreover, fostered an extreme sympathy of thought\r\nand behavior among the Chinese. Persons speaking mutually unintelligible\r\ndialects, of different racial composition, and in completely different\r\neconomic and geographical environments displayed—and, for all that, still\r\ndisplay in modern times—an uncanny uniformity of social conditioning.\r\nChina faced barbarians on many fronts; China was coördinated, homogeneous;\r\nthe barbarians of North and South did not, in all probability, know\r\nanything of each other’s existence, except what they heard from the\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\nThird, China’s wealth was a socially fortifying factor. In all Eastern\r\nAsia, no other society or form of social organization appeared which could\r\nproduce a higher scale of living. The Chinese were always materially\r\nbetter off than their neighbors, with the possible exception of the\r\nKoreans and Japanese.\r\n\r\nFourth, Eastern Asia was Chinese just as Europe was Graeco-Roman. The\r\nperipheral societies all owed a great part, if not all, of their culture\r\nto the Chinese. China’s conquerors were already under the spell of Chinese\r\ncivilization when they swept down upon it. None of them were anxious to\r\ndestroy the heritage of science, arts, and invention which the Chinese had\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nWith these advantages in mind, it is easy to understand the peculiarity of\r\nthe Westerners, as contrasted with the other peoples whom the Chinese met\r\nand fought. The formidable physical power of the Chinese was, after the\r\nfirst few decades of intercourse, seen to be quite unequal to the superior\r\nmilitary technique of the West. The Westerners, although different from\r\none another at home, tended to appear as united in the Far East. In any\r\ncase, Chinese unity availed little in the face of greater military power.\r\nThe economic factor, while a great attraction to the Westerners, was no\r\ninducement to them to become Chinese; they were willing to gain Chinese\r\nwealth, and dreamed of conquering it, but not of making wealth in the\r\nChinese manner. And lastly, and most importantly, the Westerners presented\r\na culture of their own which—after the first beginnings of regular\r\nintercourse—was quite well able to hold its own against the Chinese.(49)\r\n\r\nTo the utter certainty of the Chinese way of life, the Westerners\r\npresented the equally unshakable dogma of Christianity. They regarded the\r\nChinese—as did the Chinese them—as outlanders on the edge of the known\r\nworld. They exhibited, in short, almost the same attitude toward the\r\nChinese that the Chinese had toward barbarians. Consequently, each group\r\nregarded the other as perverse. The chief distinction between the Chinese\r\nand the Westerners lay in the fact that the Chinese would in all\r\nprobability have been satisfied if the West had minded its own business,\r\nwhile the West, feverish with expansionism, cajoled and fought for the\r\nright to come, trade, and teach.(50)\r\n\r\nAt times, the two races met on agreeable and equal terms. The Jesuit\r\nmissionaries ingratiated themselves with the Chinese and, by respecting\r\nChinese culture, won a certain admiration for their own. The eighteenth\r\ncentury in Europe was the century of _chinoiserie_, when Chinese models\r\nexercised a profound influence on the fine and domestic arts of\r\nEurope.(51) The great upsurge of economic power in the period of the\r\nEuropean industrial revolution led to increased self-assurance on the part\r\nof the Europeans. The new standards of value alienated them from those\r\nfeatures of Chinese culture which the eighteenth century had begun to\r\nappreciate, and placed them in a position to sell to the Chinese as well\r\nas buy. More and more the economic position of the two societies changed\r\nabout; the Westerners had come to purchase the superior artizan-made goods\r\nof China, giving in exchange metals or raw materials. A tendency now\r\ndeveloped for them to sell their own more cheaply, and, in some cases,\r\nbetter manufactured products to the Chinese. The era of good feeling and\r\nmutual appreciation, which had never been very strong, now drew to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe vassal states of China were conquered. The British fought the Chinese\r\non several occasions, and conquered each time. The full extent of Western\r\nmilitary superiority was revealed in the capture of Peking in 1860, and in\r\nthe effectiveness—entirely disproportionate to their numbers—that\r\nWestern-trained Imperial troops had in suppressing the Chinese T’ai-p’ing\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nWhen Sun Yat-sen was a boy, the country was afire with fear and\r\nuncertainty. Barbarians who could neither be absorbed nor defeated had\r\nappeared. Instead of adopting Chinese thought and manners, they were\r\nvigorously teaching their own to the Chinese. The traditional Chinese\r\nmechanisms of defense against barbarians were not working.(52) Something\r\nwas vitally wrong. The Chinese could not be persuaded, as some other\r\nnon-European peoples conquered in the age of Western world-dominion seem\r\nto have been, that all error lay with themselves, and that their own\r\nideology was not worth the saving; nor could they, in face of the\r\nunfortunate facts, still believe that they themselves were completely\r\nright, or, at least, that their own notions of rightness were completely\r\nexpedient. In view of the pragmatic foundations of the whole Chinese\r\nideology and way of life, the seriousness of these consequences cannot be\r\nover-estimated. Little wonder that China was disturbed! The pragmatic,\r\nrealistic method of organization that the Chinese had had, no longer\r\nworked in a new environment rising, as it were, from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Western impact, consequently, affected China in two ways. In the first\r\nplace, the amorphous Chinese society was threatened and dictated to by the\r\nstrong, clearly organized states of the West. In the second place, the\r\nintroduction of disharmonious values from the West destroyed, in large\r\npart, that appearance of universality, upon which the effectiveness of the\r\nChinese ideology depended, and shocked Chinese thought and action until\r\neven their first premises seemed doubtful.\r\n\r\nThis, in short, was the dilemma of the Chinese at the advent of Sun\r\nYat-sen. His life was to be dedicated to its solution; it is his analyses\r\nthat are to be studied in the explanation of the Chinese society in the\r\nmodern world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Continuing Significance of the Background.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the exposition of Sun Yat-sen’s theories and\r\nprograms, it is necessary that a superlatively important consideration be\r\nemphasized: namely, that Sun Yat-sen was a Chinese, that the nation he\r\nworked for was China, and that the intellectual and social background of\r\nhis labors was one completely different from that of the Euramerican\r\nworld. A great part of the vaporous disputation which has hidden Chinese\r\npolitics in a cloud of words has been the consequence of the ignoring, by\r\nWesternized Chinese as well as by Westerners, of the monumental fact that\r\nChina is in only a few respects comparable to the West, and that the ideas\r\nand methods of the West lose the greater part of their relevance when\r\napplied to the Chinese milieu. Political dialecticians in China split\r\nMarxian hairs as passionately and sincerely as though they were in\r\nnineteenth-century Germany.(53) Sun Yat-sen, though accused of this\r\nfantastic fault by some of his adversaries, was—as his theories show upon\r\nclose examination—much less influenced by Western thought than is commonly\r\nsupposed to be the case, and in applying Western doctrines to Chinese\r\naffairs was apt to look upon this as a fortunate coincidence, instead of\r\nassuming the universal exactness of recent Western social and political\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nWhat are the features of the Chinese background that must be remembered in\r\norder to throw a just light upon the beliefs of Sun Yat-sen? Primarily, it\r\nmust have become apparent, from the foregoing discussion of Confucianism\r\nand the old social order, that China, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen,\r\nwas beginning to draw away from an order of things which the West—or at\r\nleast a part of the West—aspires to achieve: a world-society in which the\r\nstate had withered away. This ideal, while never completely realized in\r\nChina, was perhaps more closely attained than it has ever been in any\r\nother society. Modern actualities led away from this ideal. The West,\r\ndreaming of world unity, was divided and armed; China too had to abandon\r\nthe old notions of universal peace, and arm. The West, seeking social\r\nstability, was mobile; China too had to move.\r\n\r\nThe old society was in its controls totalitarian. Diffuse and extensive\r\ncontrols operated fairly evenly throughout the system. The West possessed\r\na state system which was fundamentally different. By limiting the range of\r\nlaw to the reinforcement of certain particular _mores_, the Westerners\r\nwere able to obtain a terrific concentration of political power within the\r\nsphere of what they conceived to be legitimate state control. On the other\r\nhand the presence of a large number of activities not subject to state\r\ncontrol led individuals to cherish their freedom—a freedom which in most\r\ncases did not impair the military and political effectiveness of the state\r\nin external action.\r\n\r\nSince Fascism seeks to reëstablish order and certainty, as does Communism\r\n(although an order and certainty of a different kind), by the extension of\r\nstate activities; and since Sun Yat-sen proposed to improve the political\r\nposition of China by developing a modern state (of narrow, but intense\r\nactivities in contrast to the loose general controls of the old society),\r\nthe drift in China may be regarded, in this respect, as Fascism in\r\nreverse. Beginning with the same premises—the regeneration of the\r\nnation—Mussolini was led to a course of policy diametrically opposite to\r\nthat plotted by Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nEven, however, with his plans for developing a “machine state” in a\r\nsociety where states had long since perished, Sun Yat-sen did not propose\r\nto destroy Chinese morality and non-political discipline for the sake of\r\ninstituting a sharp juristic law-and-order organization. He was anxious\r\nthat the old Chinese morality and social knowledge be applied. In this, he\r\ndiffered from most of the other modern leaders of China, who were for\r\nveneering China with a Parliament and police without delay. Sun Yat-sen\r\nrealized that a state was necessary in China, and hoped to establish one;\r\nhe also hoped that, beyond the limits of the new state activity,\r\nindividualism and disorder would not come to prevail, but that the old\r\ncontrols would continue to operate.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Sun Yat-sen’s thought cannot be studied as a mere offshoot of\r\nrecent Western thought. It must be realized that he proposed two ends\r\nwhich, of all the countries of the world, would be mutually compatible\r\nonly in China: the development of a state, and the full continuation of\r\nnon-political controls.(54)\r\n\r\nIn fostering the continuation of ideological control, Sun Yat-sen hoped to\r\nmodify the old ideology so that it would become applicable to the new\r\nsituations. As will be made clear later, he was redefining the old\r\nworld-view so that, without disturbing the consequences to which it would\r\nlead, it might apply in a novel and unprecedentedly disturbed world. He\r\nwas, in short, switching the premises and trying to preserve the\r\nconclusions, modifying the actual behavior of the Chinese only in so far\r\nas it was necessary for the purpose of strengthening and invigorating the\r\nwhole body politic of China.\r\n\r\nAnother strain of the ancient thought penetrates Sun Yat-sen’s theories.\r\nIdeological control was not to the Confucians, as some Marxian critics\r\naver,(55) a rather naïve duplicity by which the gentry of China could\r\nmaintain themselves in power indefinitely. Confucius can not be accused,\r\nsave on the basis of unwarrantable reading-in, of insincerity in his\r\nteaching of order. He was conservative, and knew what he was doing, in\r\nseeking for the general self-discipline of men, and the rule of precept\r\nand virtue; but to believe that he desired one public philosophy and\r\nanother private one goes beyond the realm of historically justifiable\r\ninterpretation. An ideology may, of course, be deceptive to its\r\npromulgators, but the absence of any genuine class-society—as known in the\r\nWest—must serve as a testimonial to the sincerity of Confucian teachings.\r\nThe Confucian ideology was to the ancients not only an instrument for\r\ngood; it was common sense.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not, as a Western leader in his position might have done,\r\nseek to befuddle the masses for their own good. Since he proposed to\r\nentrust China’s destinies to the votes of the masses, he could scarcely\r\nhave believed them liable to fall victims to deceit over a great length of\r\ntime. In teaching of the race-nation, and of the nature of Chinese\r\nsociety, Sun Yat-sen was telling the people what it would be good for them\r\nto believe; it was good for them because it was the truth—that is, most in\r\naccord with the actual situation of China in the general society of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFew today would dare say what is really in the minds of European leaders\r\nsuch as Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler. These men may themselves believe\r\nwhat they say; or, not believing it, say it nevertheless because they\r\nthink it the right thing for the masses, in the masses’ own interests, to\r\nbelieve. Their respective enemies accuse them of saying what they do in\r\norder to mislead the masses and to dominate the masses for hidden purposes\r\nof their own. No such accusation has been levelled against Sun Yat-sen.\r\nApart from his personal sincerity, his belief in the qualities of the\r\ncommon people was such that he did not consider it necessary to deceive\r\nthem, even for their own good.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in dealing with the various doctrines that Sun preached, it\r\nmust be remembered that he himself believed what he was saying. He did not\r\nmerely think that the people should regard the Chinese society as a\r\nrace-nation; he thought that China _was_ a race-nation. The modifications\r\nof the Confucian philosophy were to be contemplated, as was the original\r\nphilosophy, as pragmatically true.(56)\r\n\r\nThese two factors must be reckoned with—that Sun Yat-sen was teaching and\r\nworking in the Chinese milieu, and that his ideology was an ideology not\r\nin the older pejorative sense of the word, which connoted duplicity, but\r\nan ideology in the sense of a scheme of exact knowledge which, by its very\r\ntruthfulness, was a political and social instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II THE THEORY OF NATIONALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emergence of the Chinese Race-Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt could, at first thought, be supposed that the reconstruction of Chinese\r\nsociety might have been necessitated by internal weakness just as much as\r\nby a changed environment. The process of organizing and developing a\r\ntight, clear scheme of political control organizations within the society\r\n(stateification), and delimiting the extent and aims of the society\r\n(nationalism) were the chief characteristics of this reconstruction.\r\n\r\nIt is only by means of a disregard of actual conditions that the\r\nsupposition of an internal weakness so great as to require radical change\r\ncan be maintained. While the latter days of the Manchu Empire represented\r\na decline, it was a decline no more serious than others through which\r\nChinese culture had passed and resurged many times in its history. It is\r\nstill a debatable matter as to whether China had actually become\r\nintellectually and artistically sterile during this period. In any event,\r\nit is questionable whether the completely revolutionary reorganization of\r\nChinese society—of the type that Sun Yat-sen found it necessary to\r\nsupport—would have been either worth-while or probable in the absence of\r\nEuramerican aggression, and the appearance, all about China, of a new,\r\nhostile, and unstable environment. If it had not been for the impact of\r\nthe West it is conceivable—although all comment on this must remain mere\r\nspeculation—that a social revolution such as those which occurred under\r\nWang Mang (usurper-founder of the unrecognized Hsin Dynasty, 9-25 A.D.),\r\nWang An-shih (prime minister, 1069-1076 A.D., under the Sung dynasty), or\r\nHung Hsiu-ch’üan (founder of the rebel T’ai P’ing dynasty, 1849-1865),\r\nmight have adjusted matters by a general redistribution of wealth and\r\nadministrative reorganization.\r\n\r\nIn his earliest agitations Sun Yat-sen was opposed to the Manchus.(57) In\r\nthis connection he developed a peculiar and interesting theory concerning\r\nnationalism. He held, briefly, that the Chinese had, at the noon-day glory\r\nof their Empire, fallen under the lure of a cosmopolitanism which was not\r\nin accord with the realities of political existence. It was this lack of\r\ndistinction between themselves and outsiders which had permitted hundreds\r\nof millions of Chinese to fall prey to one hundred thousand Manchus in the\r\nearly seventeenth century,(58) with the consequence that the Manchus, once\r\non the throne of China, made every effort to erase their barbarian origin\r\nfrom the minds of the Chinese, and, with this end in view, did everything\r\npossible, as modern Japan is doing in Korea, to destroy the national\r\nconsciousness of the Chinese.(59) China, to Sun Yat-sen, had always been a\r\nnation, but its inhabitants did not believe it a nation. They had lost the\r\nprecious treasure of nationalism. Without contradicting Sun Yat-sen, but\r\ndiffering from him only in the use of words, Westerners might say that the\r\nChinese had once known nationalism as members of the antique Chinese\r\nstates, but had later formed—in the place of a nation—a cosmopolitan\r\nsociety which comprehended the civilized world of Eastern Asia.(60)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not blame Confucius for cosmopolitanism. There is, indeed,\r\nnowhere in his works the implication that Confucianism was an evil in\r\nitself, deserving destruction; why then did Sun Yat-sen believe that, even\r\nthough the old ideology was not invalid for the organization of China\r\ninternally, the old world-view had broken down as an effective instrument\r\nfor the preservation of China?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Sun stated, in terms more general than did the ancients, the\r\nnecessity of establishing the ideology on the basis of pragmatism. He\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We cannot say in general that ideas, as ideas, are good or bad. We\r\n    must judge whether, when put into practice, they prove useful to\r\n    us or not. If they are of practical value to us, they are good; if\r\n    they are impractical, they are bad. If they are useful to the\r\n    world, they are good; if they are not useful to the world, they\r\n    are not good.(61)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe states, also, that if the Chinese race is to survive, it must adopt\r\nnationalism. “... if we now want to save China, if we wish to see the\r\nChinese race survive forever, we must preach Nationalism.”(62) Hitherto\r\nthey had been no more conscious of race than were the Europeans of the\r\nmiddle ages. To be sure, they were barbarians, whose features were\r\nstrange; but the Chinese were not conscious of themselves as a racial\r\nunity in competition and conflict with other equal or superior racial\r\nunities. The self-consciousness of the Chinese was a cultural rather than\r\na racial one, and the juxtaposition that presented itself to the Chinese\r\nmind was between “Ourselves of the Central Realm” and “You the\r\nOutsiders.”(63) Sun Yat-sen became intensely conscious of being a Chinese\r\nby race,(64) and so did many other of his compatriots, by the\r\nextraordinary race-pride of the _White Men_ in China. In common with many\r\nothers of his generation, Sun Yat-sen turned to race-consciousness as the\r\nname for Chinese solidarity.\r\n\r\nThere is nowhere in his works, so far as the writer knows, any attempt to\r\nfind a value higher than the necessity of perpetuating the Chinese race.\r\nSun Yat-sen was a Chinese; his followers were Chinese; whatever benefits\r\nthey contemplated bestowing upon the world as a whole were incidental to\r\ntheir work for a powerful and continued China. At various times Sun\r\nYat-sen and his followers expressed sympathy with the whole world, with\r\nthe oppressed of the earth, or with all Asia, but the paramount drive\r\nbehind the new movement has been the defense and reconstruction of China,\r\nno longer conceived of as a core-society maintaining the flower of human\r\ncivilization, but regarded as a race abruptly plunged into the chaos of\r\nhostile and greedy nations.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Sun Yat-sen called China a nation. We may suppose\r\nthat he never thought that Chinese society need not necessarily be called\r\na nation, even in the modern world. What he did do, though, was to\r\nconceive of China as a unique type of nation: a race-nation. He stated\r\nthat races could be distinguished by a study of physical characteristics,\r\noccupation, language, religion and folkways or customs.(65) Dividing the\r\nworld first into the usual old-style five primary races (white, black,\r\nyellow, brown, and red), he divides these races into sub-races in the\r\nnarrow sense of the term. The Chinese race, in the narrow sense of the\r\nterm, is both a race and a nation. The Anglo-Saxons are divided between\r\nEngland and America, the Germans between Germany and Austria, the Latins\r\namong the Mediterranean nations, and so forth; but China is at the same\r\ntime both the Chinese race and the Chinese nation. If the Chinese wish\r\ntheir race to perpetuate itself forever, they must adopt and follow the\r\ndoctrine of Nationalism.(66) Otherwise China faces the tragedy of being\r\n\"despoiled as a nation and extinct as a race.\"(67)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen felt that China was menaced and oppressed ethnically,\r\npolitically and economically. Ethnically, he believed that the\r\nextraordinary population increase of the white race within the past few\r\ncenturies represented a trend which, if not counterbalanced, would simply\r\nresult in the Chinese race being crowded off the earth. Politically he\r\nobserved that the Chinese dependencies had been alienated by the Western\r\npowers and Japan; that China was at the mercy of any military nation that\r\nchose to attack; that it was a temporary deadlock between the conquering\r\npowers rather than any strength of China that prevented, at least for the\r\ntime being, the partition of China and that a diplomatic attack, which\r\ncould break the deadlock of the covetous states, would be even more deadly\r\nand drastic than simple military attack.(68)\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Sun Yat-sen saw a nation while the majority of\r\nhis compatriots still envisioned the serene, indestructible society of the\r\nConfucians. Others may have realized that the Western impact was more than\r\na frontier squabble on a grand scale; they may have thought it to have\r\nassumed epic proportions. But Sun Yat-sen, oppressed by his superior\r\nknowledge of the Western nations, obtained at the cost of considerable\r\nsympathy with them, struggled desperately to make his countrymen aware of\r\nthe fact, irrefutable to him, that China was engaged in a conflict\r\ndifferent not only in degree but in kind from any other in Chinese\r\nhistory. The Great Central Realm had become simply China. Endangered and\r\nyet supine, it faced the imperative necessity of complete reconstitution,\r\nwith the bitter alternative of decay and extinction—a race tragedy to be\r\ncompounded of millions of individual tragedies. And yet reconstitution\r\ncould not be of a kind that would itself be a surrender and treason to the\r\npast; China must fit itself for the modern world, and nevertheless be\r\nChina. This was the dilemma of the Chinese world-society, suddenly become\r\na nation. Sun Yat-sen’s life and thought were devoted to solving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Necessity of Nationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn abstract theorist might observe that the Chinese, finding their\r\nloose-knit but stable society surrounded by compact and aggressive\r\nnations, might have solved the question of the perpetuation of Chinese\r\nsociety in the new environment by one of two expedients: first, by\r\nnationalizing, as it were, their non-national civilization; or second, by\r\nlaunching themselves into a campaign against the system of nations as\r\nsuch. The second alternative does not seem to have occurred to Sun\r\nYat-sen. Though he never ventured upon any complete race-war theory, he\r\nwas nevertheless anxious to maintain the self-sufficient power of China as\r\nit had been until the advent of the West. In his negotiations with the\r\nCommunists, for example, neither he nor they suggested—as might have been\r\ndone in harmony with communist theory—the fusion of China and the Soviet\r\nUnion under a nuclear world government. We may assume with a fair degree\r\nof certainty that, had a suggestion been made, Sun Yat-sen would have\r\nrejected it with mistrust if not indignation. He had spent a great part of\r\nhis life in the West. He knew, therefore, the incalculable gulf between\r\nthe civilizations, and was unwilling to entrust the destinies of China to\r\npersons other than Chinese.(69)\r\n\r\nOnce the possibility of a successful counter-attack upon the system of\r\nnations is discounted, nationalism is seen as the sole solution to China’s\r\ndifficulties. It must, however, be understood that, whereas nationalism in\r\nthe West implies an intensification of the already definite national\r\nconsciousness of the peoples, nationalism in China might mean only as\r\nlittle as the introduction of such an awareness of nationality.\r\nNationalism in China might, as a matter of logic, include the possibility\r\nof improved personal relations between the Chinese and the nationals of\r\nother states since, on the one hand, the Chinese would be relieved of an\r\nintolerable sense of humiliation in the face of Western power, and, on the\r\nother, be disabused of any archaic notions they might retain concerning\r\nthemselves as the sole civilized people of the earth.(70)\r\n\r\nA brief historical reference may explain the apparent necessity of\r\nnationalism in China. In the nineteenth century foreigners in China\r\ngenerally suffered reverses when they came into conflict with a village, a\r\nfamily, or a guild. But when they met the government, they were almost\r\nalways in a position to bully it. It was commonly of little or no concern\r\nto the people what their government did to the barbarians; the whole\r\naffair was too remote to be much thought about. We find, for example, that\r\nthe British had no trouble in obtaining labor auxiliaries in Canton to\r\nfight with the British troops against the Imperial government at Peking in\r\n1860; it is quite probable that these Cantonese, who certainly did not\r\nthink that they were renegades, had no anti-dynastic intentions. Chinese\r\nserved the foreign enemies of China at various times as quasi-military\r\nconstabulary, and served faithfully. Before the rise of Chinese\r\nnationalism it was not beyond possibility that China would be partitioned\r\ninto four or five colonies appurtenant to the various great powers and\r\nthat the Chinese in each separate colony, if considerately and tactfully\r\ntreated, would have become quite loyal to their respective foreign\r\nmasters. The menace of such possibilities made the need of Chinese\r\nnationalism very real to Sun Yat-sen; the passing of time may serve\r\nfurther to vindicate his judgment.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s nationalism, though most vividly clear when considered as a\r\npractical expedient of social engineering, may also be regarded more\r\nphilosophically as a derivation of, or at least having an affinity with,\r\ncertain older ideas of the Chinese. Confucian thinking, as re-expressed in\r\nWestern terms, implants in the individual a sense of his responsibility to\r\nall humanity, united in space and time. Confucianism stressed the\r\nsolidarity of humanity, continuous, immortal, bound together by the\r\nclosest conceivable ties—blood relationships. Sun Yat-sen’s nationalism\r\nmay represent a narrowing of this conception, and the substitution of the\r\nmodern Chinese race for Confucian humanity. In fairness to Sun Yat-sen it\r\nmust, however, be admitted that he liked to think, in Christian and\r\nConfucian terms, of the brotherhood of man; one of his favorite\r\nexpressions was “under heaven all men shall work for the common good.”(71)\r\n\r\nNationalism was to Sun Yat-sen the prime condition of his movement and of\r\nhis other principles. The Communists of the West regard every aspect of\r\ntheir lives significant only in so far as it is instrumental in the class\r\nstruggle. Sun Yat-sen, meeting them, was willing to use the term “class\r\nstruggle” as an instrument for Chinese nationalism. He thought of China,\r\nof the vital and immediate necessity of defending and strengthening China,\r\nand sacrificed everything to the effectuation of a genuine nationalism. To\r\nhim only nationalism could tighten, organize, and clarify the Chinese\r\nsocial system so that China, whatever it was to be, might not be lost.\r\n\r\nThe early philosophers of China, looking upon a unicultural world, saw\r\nsocial organization as the supreme criterion of civilization and humanity.\r\nSun Yat-sen, in a world of many mutually incomprehensible and hostile\r\ncultures saw nationalism (in the sense of race solidarity) as the supreme\r\ncondition for the survival of the race-nation China. Democracy and social\r\nwelfare were necessary to the stability and effectiveness of this\r\nnationalism, but the preservation and continuation of the race-nation was\r\nalways to remain the prime desideratum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Return to the Old Morality.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen quite unequivocally stated the necessity for establishing a\r\nnew Nationalist ideology in order to effectuate the purposes of China’s\r\nregeneration. He spoke of the two steps of ideological reconstitution and\r\npolitical reconstitution as follows: “In order today to restore our\r\nnational standing we must, first of all, revive the national spirit. But\r\nin order to revive the national spirit, we must fulfill two conditions.\r\nFirst, we must realize that we are at present in a very critical\r\nsituation. Second ... we must unite ... and form a large national\r\nassociation.”(72) He evidently regarded the ideological reconstitution as\r\nanterior to the political, although he adjusted the common development of\r\nthe two quite detailedly in his doctrine of tutelage.\r\n\r\nHe proposed three ideological methods for the regeneration of China, which\r\nmight again make the Chinese the leading society (nation) of the world.\r\nThere were: first, the return to the ancient Chinese morality; second, the\r\nreturn to the ancient Chinese learning; and third, the adoption of Western\r\nscience.(73)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s never-shaken belief in the applicability of the ancient\r\nChinese ethical system, and in the wisdom of old China in social\r\norganization, is such that of itself it prevents his being regarded as a\r\nmere imitator of the West, a barbarized Chinese returning to barbarize his\r\ncountrymen. His devotion to Confucianism was so great that Richard\r\nWilhelm, the greatest of German sinologues, wrote of him: “The greatness\r\nof Sun Yat-sen rests, therefore, upon the fact that he has found a living\r\nsynthesis between the fundamental principles of Confucianism and the\r\ndemands of modern times, a synthesis which, beyond the borders of China,\r\ncan again become significant to all humanity. Sun Yat-sen combined in\r\nhimself the brazen consistency of a revolutionary and the great love of\r\nhumanity of a renewer. Sun Yat-sen has been the kindest of all the\r\nrevolutionaries of mankind. And this kindness was taken by him from the\r\nheritage of Confucius. Hence his intellectual work stands as a connecting\r\nbridge between the old and the modern ages. And it will be the salvation\r\nof China, if it determinedly treads that bridge.”(74) And Tai Chi-tao, one\r\nof Sun Yat-sen’s most respected followers, had said: “Sun Yat-sen was the\r\nonly one among all the revolutionaries who was not an enemy to Confucius;\r\nSun Yat-sen himself said that his ideas embodied China, and that they were\r\nderived from the ideas of Confucius.”(75) The invocation of authorities\r\nneed not be relied upon to demonstrate the importance of Sun Yat-sen’s\r\ndemand for ideological reconstruction upon the basis of a return to the\r\ntraditional morality; he himself stated his position in his sixth lecture\r\non nationalism: “If we now wish to restore to our nation its former\r\nposition, besides uniting all of us into a national body, we must also\r\nfirst revive our own ancient morality; when we have achieved that, we can\r\nhope to give back to our nation the position which she once held.”(76)\r\n\r\nWhat are the chief elements of the old morality? These are: 1) loyalty and\r\nfilial piety, 2) humanity and charity, 3) faithfulness and justice, and 4)\r\npeace. These four, however, are all expressions of _humanity_, to which\r\n_knowledge_ and _valor_ must be joined, and _sincerity_ employed in\r\nexpressing them.\r\n\r\nThe problem of loyalty was one very difficult to solve. Under the Empire\r\nit was easy enough to consider the Emperor as the father of the great\r\nsociety, and to teach loyalty to him. This was easy to grasp, even for the\r\nsimplest mind. Sun Yat-sen urged loyalty to the people, and loyalty to\r\nduty, as successors to the loyalty once owed to the sovereign. He deplored\r\nthe tendency, which appeared in Republican times, for the masses to assume\r\nthat since there was no more Emperor, there was no more loyalty; and it\r\nhas, since the passing of Sun Yat-sen, been one of the efforts of the\r\nNationalists to build up a tradition of loyalty to the spirit of Sun\r\nYat-sen as the timeless and undying leader of modern China.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was also deeply devoted to filial piety in China, which was—in\r\nthe old philosophy—simply a manifestation, in another direction, of the\r\nsame virtue as loyalty. He called filial piety indispensable, and was\r\nproud that none of the Western nations had ever approached the excellence\r\nof the Chinese in this virtue.(77) At the time that he said this, Sun\r\nYat-sen was accused of being a virtual Communist, and of having succumbed\r\nto the lure of Soviet doctrines. It is at least a little strange that a\r\nman supposedly infatuated with Marxism should praise that most\r\nconservative of all virtues: filial piety!\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen then commented on each of the other virtues, pointing out\r\ntheir excellence in old China, and their necessity to modern China. In the\r\ncase of faithfulness, for example, he cited the traditional reliability of\r\nthe Chinese in commercial honor. Concerning justice, he pointed out that\r\nthe Chinese political technique was one fundamentally just; an instance of\r\nthe application of this was Korea, which was-allowed to enjoy peace and\r\nautonomy as a Chinese vassal state for centuries, and then was destroyed\r\nshortly after becoming a Japanese protectorate. Chinese faithfulness and\r\njustice were obviously superior to that of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nIn politics the two most important contributions of the old morality to\r\nthe Nationalist ideology of Sun Yat-sen were (1) the doctrine of _wang\r\ntao_, and (2) the social interpretation of history.\r\n\r\n_Wang tao_ is the way of kings—the way of right as opposed to _pa tao_,\r\nthe way of might. It consisted, in the old ideology, of the course of\r\naction of the kingly man, who ruled in harmony with nature and did not\r\nviolate the established proprieties of mankind. Sun Yat-sen’s teachings\r\nafford us several applications of _wang tao_. In the first place, a group\r\nwhich has been formed by the forces of nature is a race; it has been\r\nformed according to _wang tao_. A group which has been organized by brute\r\nforce is a state, and is formed by _pa tao_. The Chinese Empire was built\r\naccording to _wang tao_; the British Empire by _pa tao_. The former was a\r\nnatural organization of a homogeneous race; the latter, a military outrage\r\nagainst the natural order of mankind.(78)\r\n\r\n_Wang tao_ is also seen in the relation between China and her vassal\r\nstates, a benevolent relationship which stood in sharp contrast, at times,\r\nthough not always, to the methods later to be used by the Europeans in\r\nAsia.(79) Again, economic development on a basis of the free play of\r\neconomic forces was regarded as _wang tao_ by Sun Yat-sen, even though its\r\nconsequences might be adverse. _Pa tao_ appeared only when the political\r\nwas employed to do violence to the economic.(80) This doctrine of good and\r\nbad aspects of economic relationships stands in distinct contrast to the\r\nCommunist theory. He believed that the political was frequently employed\r\nto bring about unjust international economic relationships, and extenuated\r\nadverse economic conditions simply because they were the free result of\r\nthe operations of a _laissez-faire_ economy.\r\n\r\nEconomically, the interpretation of history was, according to Sun Yat-sen,\r\nto be performed through the study of consumption, and not of the means of\r\nproduction. In this he was indebted to Maurice William—at least in\r\npart.(81) The social interpretation of history is, however, associated not\r\nonly with economic matters, but with the ancient Chinese moral system as\r\nwell. Tai Chi-tao, whose work has most clearly demonstrated the\r\nrelationship between Confucianism and Sunyatsenism, points out in his\r\ndiagram of Sun Yat-sen’s ethical system that _humanity_ (_jên_) was to Sun\r\nYat-sen the key to the interpretation of history. We have already seen\r\nthat _jên_ is the doctrine of social consciousness, of awareness of\r\nmembership in society.(82) Sun Yat-sen, according to Tai Chi-tao, regarded\r\nman’s development as a social animal, the development of his humanity, as\r\nthe key to history. This would include, of course, among other things, his\r\nmethods of production and of consumption. The distinction between Sun\r\nYat-sen and the Western Marxian thinkers lies in the fact that the latter\r\ntrace their philosophical genealogy back through the main currents of\r\nWestern philosophy, while Sun Yat-sen derives his from Confucius. Nothing\r\ncould be further from dialectical materialism than the socio-ethical\r\ninterpretation that Sun Yat-sen developed from the Confucian theories.\r\n\r\nThe rôle played by the old Chinese morality in the ideology of Sun Yat-sen\r\nis, it is apparent, an important one. First, Sun Yat-sen believed that\r\nChinese nationalism and the regeneration of the Chinese people had to be\r\nbased on the old morality of China, which was superior to any other\r\nmorality that the world had known, and which was among the treasures of\r\nthe Chinese people. Second, he believed that, in practical politics as\r\nwell as national ideology, the application of the old virtues would be\r\nfruitful in bringing about the development of a strong China. Third, he\r\nderived the idea of _wang tao_, the right, the royal, the natural way,\r\nfrom antiquity. He pointed out that violence to the established order—of\r\nrace, as in the case of the British Empire, of economics, as in the case\r\nof the political methods of imperialism—was directly antithetical to the\r\nnatural, peaceful way of doing things that had led to the supreme\r\ngreatness of China in past ages. Fourth, he employed the doctrine of\r\n_jên_, of social-consciousness, which had already been used, by the\r\nConfucians, and formed the cornerstone of their teaching, as the key to\r\nhis interpretation. In regard to the individual, this was, as we have\r\nseen, consciousness of social orientation; with regard to the group, it\r\nwas the development of strength and harmony. It has also been translated\r\n_humanity_, which broadly and ethically, carries the value scheme with\r\nwhich _jên_ is connected.\r\n\r\nEven this heavy indebtedness to Chinese antiquity in adopting and adapting\r\nthe morality of the ancients for the salvation of their children in the\r\nmodern world, was not the total of Sun Yat-sen’s political traditionalism.\r\nHe also wished to renew the ancient Chinese knowledge, especially in the\r\nfields of social and political science. Only after these did he desire\r\nthat Western technics be introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Return to the Ancient Knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s doctrine of the return to the ancient Chinese knowledge may\r\nbe divided into three parts. First, he praised the ancient Chinese\r\nsuperiority in the field of social science, but distinctly stressed the\r\nnecessity of Western knowledge in the field of the physical and applied\r\nsciences alone.(83) Second, he pointed out the many practical\r\naccomplishments of the ancient Chinese knowledge, and the excellence and\r\nversatility of Chinese invention.(84) Third, his emphasis upon the\r\ndevelopment of talents in the material sciences hints at, although it does\r\nnot state, a theory of national wealth based upon labor capacity.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen said, “Besides reviving our ancient Chinese morality, we must\r\nalso revive our wisdom and ability.... If today we want to revive our\r\nnational spirit, we must revive not only the morality which is proper to\r\nus, but we must revive also our own knowledge.”(85) He goes on to say that\r\nthe peculiar excellence of the ancient Chinese knowledge lay in the field\r\nof political philosophy, and states that the Chinese political philosophy\r\nsurpassed the Western, at least in clearness.\r\n\r\nHe quotes _The Great Learning_ for the summation, in a few words, of the\r\nhighlights of this ancient Chinese social knowledge: “Investigate into\r\nthings, attain the utmost knowledge, make the thoughts sincere, rectify\r\nthe heart, cultivate the person, regulate the family, govern the country\r\nrightly, pacify the world.”(86) This is, as we have seen, what may be\r\ncalled the Confucian doctrine of ideological control. Sun Yat-sen lavished\r\npraise upon it. “Such a theory, so detailed, minute, and progressive, was\r\nneither discovered nor spoken of by any foreign political philosopher. It\r\nis a peculiar intellectual treasure pertaining to our political\r\nphilosophy, which we must preserve.”(87) The endorsement is doubly\r\nsignificant. In the first place, it demonstrates the fact that Sun Yat-sen\r\nthought of himself as a rebuilder and not as a destroyer of the ancient\r\nChinese culture, and the traditional methods of organization and control.\r\nIn the second place, it points out that his Chinese background was most\r\nclear to him, and that he was in his own mind the transmitter of the\r\nChinese heritage.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Chinese excellence in the field of the social science, Sun\r\nYat-sen did not confine his discussion to any one time. Whenever he\r\nreferred to a political theory, he mentioned its Chinese origin if it were\r\none of those known to Chinese antiquity: anarchism, communism, democracy.\r\nHe never attacked Chinese intellectual knowledge for being what it was,\r\nbut only for what it omitted: physical science.(88) He was undoubtedly\r\nmore conservative than many of his contemporaries, who were actually\r\nhostile to the inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe summary of Sun Yat-sen’s beliefs and position in respect to the\r\nancient intellectual knowledge is so well given by Tai Chi-tao that any\r\nother statement would almost have to verge on paraphrase. Tai Chi-tao\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sun Yat-sen (in his teachings) completely includes the true ideas\r\n    of China as they recur again and again from Yao and Shun,\r\n    Confucius and Mencius. It will be clear to us, therefore, that Sun\r\n    Yat-sen is the renewal of Chinese moral culture, unbroken for two\r\n    thousand years ... we can see that Sun Yat-sen was convinced of\r\n    the truth of his own words, and at the same time we can also\r\n    recognize that his national revolution was based upon the\r\n    re-awakening of Chinese culture. He wanted to call the creative\r\n    power of China to life again, and to make the value of Chinese\r\n    culture useful to the whole world, and in that way to realize\r\n    cosmopolitanism.(89)\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Sun Yat-sen’s doctrines may not only be regarded as having\r\nbeen based upon the tacit premises of the Chinese intellectual milieu, but\r\nas having been incorporated in them as supports. Sun Yat-sen’s theories\r\nwere, therefore, consciously as well as unconsciously Chinese.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was proud of the accomplishment of the Chinese in physical and\r\napplied knowledge. He praised Chinese craftsmanship and skill, and\r\nextolled the talents of the people which had invented the mariner’s\r\ncompass, printing, porcelain, gunpowder, tea, silks, arches, and\r\nsuspension bridges.(90) He urged the revival of the talents of the\r\nChinese, and the return of material development. This teaching, in\r\nconjunction with his advocacy of Western knowledge, leads to another\r\nsuggestive point.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen pointed out that _wealth_ was to the modern Chinese what\r\n_liberty_ was to the Europeans of the eighteenth century—the supreme\r\ncondition of further progress.(91) The way to progress and wealth was\r\nthrough social reorganization, and through the use of the capacities of\r\nthe people. It may be inferred, although it cannot be stated positively,\r\nthat Sun Yat-sen measured wealth not merely in metals or commodities, but\r\nin the productive capacities of the country, which, as they depend upon\r\nthe labor skill of the workers, are in the last analysis cultural and\r\npsychological rather than exclusively physical in nature.(92)\r\n\r\nChina, following the ancient morality, conscious of its intellectual and\r\nsocial heritage, and of its latent practical talents, needed only one more\r\nlesson to learn: the need of Western science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Physical Science in the New Ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third element of the nationalist ideology proposed by Sun Yat-sen was\r\nthe introduction of Western science. It is upon this that his break with\r\nthe past arose; it is this that gives his ideology its partially\r\nrevolutionary character, for the ideology was, as we have seen, strongly\r\nreconstitutional in two of its elements. Sun Yat-sen was, however, willing\r\nto tear down if he could rebuild, and rebuild with the addition of Western\r\nscience. These questions immediately arise: why did he wish to add Western\r\nscience to the intellectual background of modern China? what, in Western\r\nscience, did he wish to add? to what degree did he wish Western science to\r\nplay its rôle in the development of a new ideology for China?\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not have to teach the addition of Western science to the\r\nChinese ideology. In his own lifetime the terrific swing from arrogant\r\nself-assurance to abject imitativeness had taken place. Sun Yat-sen said\r\nthat the Boxer Rebellion was the last surge of the old Chinese\r\nnationalism, “But the war of 1900 was the last manifestation of\r\nself-confidence thoughts and self-confidence power on the part of the\r\nChinese to oppose the new civilization of Europe and of America.... They\r\nunderstood that the civilization of Europe and of America was really much\r\nsuperior to the ancient civilization of China.”(93) He added that this\r\nsuperiority was naturally evident in the matter of armaments. This\r\nillustrates both consequences of the impact of the West—the endangered\r\nposition of the Chinese society, and the consequent instability of the\r\nChinese ideology.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not regard the introduction of Western science into\r\nChinese life as merely remedial in nature, but, on the contrary, saw much\r\nbenefit in it. This was especially clear to him as a physician; his\r\ntraining led him to see the abominable practices of many of the Chinese in\r\nmatters of diet and hygiene.(94) He made a sweeping claim of Western\r\nsuperiority, which is at the same time a sharp limitation of it in fields\r\nwhich the conservative European would be likely to think of as\r\nforemost—politics, ethics, religion. “Besides the matter of armaments, the\r\nmeans of communication ... are far superior.... Moreover, in everything\r\nelse that relates to machinery or daily human labor, in methods of\r\nagriculture, of industry, and of commerce, all (foreign) methods by far\r\nsurpass those of China.”(95)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen pointed out the fact that while manuals of warfare become\r\nobsolete in a very few years in the West, political ideas and institutions\r\ndo not. He cited the continuance of the same pattern of government in the\r\nUnited States, and the lasting authority of the _Republic_ of Plato, as\r\nexamples of the stagnation of the Western social sciences as contrasted\r\nwith physical sciences. Already prepossessed in favor of the Chinese\r\nknowledge and morality in non-technical matters, he did not demand the\r\nintroduction of Western social methods as well. He had lived long enough\r\nin the West to lose some of the West-worship that characterized so many\r\nChinese and Japanese of his generation. He was willing, even anxious, that\r\nthe experimental method, by itself, be introduced into Chinese thought in\r\nall fields,(96) but not particularly impressed with the general\r\nsuperiority of Western social thought.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s own exposition of the reasons for his desiring to limit the\r\nrôle played by Western science in China is quite clear.(97) In the first\r\nplace, Sun Yat-sen was vigorously in favor of adopting the experimental\r\nmethod in attaining knowledge. He stood firmly for the pragmatic\r\nfoundation of knowledge, and for the exercise of the greatest care and\r\nmost strenuous effort in discovering it. Secondly, he believed in taking\r\nover the physical knowledge of the Westerners, although—in his emphasis on\r\nChinese talent—he by no means believed that Western physical knowledge\r\nwould displace that of the Chinese altogether. “We can safely imitate the\r\nmaterial civilization of Europe and of America; we may follow it blindly,\r\nand if we introduce it in China, it will make good headway.”(98) Thirdly,\r\nhe believed that the social science of the West, and especially its\r\npolitical philosophy, might lead the Chinese into gross error, since it\r\nwas derived from a quite different ideology, and not relevant to Chinese\r\nconditions. “It would be a gross error on our part, if, disregarding our\r\nown Chinese customs and human sentiments, we were to try to force upon\r\n(our people) a foreign type of social government just as we copy a foreign\r\nmake of machinery.”(99) Fourthly, even apart from the difference between\r\nChina and the West which invalidated Western social science in China, he\r\ndid not believe that the West had attained to anything like the same\r\ncertainty in social science that it had in physical science.(100) Fifthly,\r\nSun Yat-sen believed that the Chinese should profit by observing the\r\nexperiments and theories of the West in regard to social organization,\r\nwithout necessarily following them.\r\n\r\nThe great break between Sun Yat-sen’s acceptance of Western physical\r\nscience and his rejection of Western social science is demonstrated by his\r\nbelief that government is psychological in its foundations. “Laws of human\r\ngovernment also constitute an abstract piece of machinery—for that reason\r\nwe speak of the machinery of an organized government—but a material piece\r\nof machinery is based on nature, whereas the immaterial machinery of\r\ngovernment is based on psychology.”(101) Sun Yat-sen pointed out, although\r\nin different words, that government was based upon the ideology and that\r\nthe ideology of a society was an element in the last analysis\r\npsychological, however much it might be conditioned by the material\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nOf these three elements—Chinese morality, Chinese social and political\r\nknowledge, and Western physical science—the new ideology for the modern\r\nChinese society was to be formed. What the immediate and the ultimate\r\nforms of that society were to be, remains to be studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consequences of the Nationalist Ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the consequences of this Nationalistic ideology? What sort of\r\nsociety did Sun Yat-sen envision? How much of it was to be Chinese, and\r\nhow much Western? Were the Chinese, like some modern Japanese, to take\r\npride in being simultaneously the most Eastern of Eastern nations and the\r\nmost Western of Western or were they to seek to remain fundamentally what\r\ntheir ancestors had been for uncounted centuries?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Sun Yat-sen’s proposed ideology was, as we have seen,\r\nto be composed of four elements. First, the essential core of the old\r\nideology, to which the three necessary revivifying elements were to be\r\nadded. This vast unmentioned foundation is highly significant to the\r\nassessment of the nature of the new Chinese ideology. (It is quite\r\napparent that Sun Yat-sen never dreamed, as did the Russians, of\r\noverthrowing the _entire_ traditional order of things. His three\r\nmodifications were to be added to the existing Chinese civilization.)\r\nSecond, he wished to revive the old morality. Third, he desired to restore\r\nthe ancient knowledge and skill of the Chinese to their full creative\r\nenergy. Fourth, he desired to add Western science. The full significance\r\nof this must be realized in a consideration of Chinese nationalism. Sun\r\nYat-sen did not, like the Meiji Emperor, desire to add the whole front of\r\nWestern culture; he was even further from emulating the Russians in a\r\ndestruction of the existing order and the development of an entirely new\r\nsystem. His energies were directed to the purification and reconstitution\r\nof the Chinese ideology by the strengthening of its own latent moral and\r\nintellectual values, and by the innovation of Western physical science and\r\nthe experimental method. Of the range of the ideology, of the\r\nindescribably complex intellectual conditionings in which the many\r\nactivities of the Chinese in their own civilization were carried on, Sun\r\nYat-sen proposed to modify only those which could be improved by a\r\nreaction to the excellencies of Chinese antiquity, or benefited by the\r\ninfluence of Western science. Sun Yat-sen was, as Wilhelm states, both a\r\nrevolutionary and a reconstitutionary. He was reconstitutionary in the\r\nideology which he proposed, and a revolutionary by virtue of the political\r\nmethods which he was willing to sanction and employ in carrying the\r\nideology into the minds of the Chinese populace.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, Sun Yat-sen proposed to modify the old ideology not\r\nonly with respect to content but also with regard to method of\r\ndevelopment. The Confucians had, as we have seen, provided for the\r\ncontinual modification and rectification of the ideology by means of the\r\ndoctrine of _chêng ming_. It is a matter of dispute as to what degree that\r\ndoctrine constituted a scientific method for propagating knowledge.(102)\r\nWhatever the method of the ancients, Sun Yat-sen proposed to modify it in\r\nthree steps: the acknowledgment of the pragmatic foundations of social\r\nideas, the recognition of the necessity for knowledge before action, and\r\nthe introduction of the experimental method. His pragmatic position shows\r\nno particular indication of having been derived from any specific source;\r\nit was a common enough tendency in old Chinese thought, from the\r\nbeginning; in advocating it, Sun Yat-sen may have been revolutionary only\r\nin his championing of an idea which he may well have had since early\r\nchildhood. His stress upon the necessity of ideological clarity as\r\nantecedent to revolutionary or any other kind of action is negatively\r\nderived from Wang Yang-ming, whose statement of the converse Sun Yat-sen\r\nwas wont to attack. The belief in the experimental method is clearly\r\nenough the result of his Western scientific training—possibly in so direct\r\na fashion as the personal influence of one of his instructors, Dr. James\r\nCantlie, later Sir James Cantlie, of Queen’s College, Hongkong. Sun\r\nYat-sen was a physician; his degree _Dr._ was a medical and not an\r\nacademic one; and there is no reason to overlook the influence of his\r\nvocation, a Western one, in estimating the influence of the Western\r\nexperimental method.(103)\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming preponderance of Chinese elements in the new ideology\r\nproposed by Sun Yat-sen must not hide the fact that, in so stable an\r\nideology as that of old China, the modifications which Sun advocated were\r\nhighly significant. In method, experimentalism;(104) in background, the\r\nwhole present body of Western science—these were to move China deeply,\r\nalbeit a China that remained Chinese. There is a fundamental difference\r\nbetween Sun’s doctrine of ideological extension (“the need for knowledge”)\r\nand Confucius’ doctrine of ideological rectification (_chêng ming_).\r\nConfucius advocated the establishment of a powerful ideology for the\r\npurpose of extending ideological control and thereby of minimizing the\r\nthen pernicious effects of the politically active proto-nations of his\r\ntime. Sun Yat-sen, reared in a world subject to ideological control, saw\r\nno real necessity for strengthening it; what he desired was to prepare\r\nChina psychologically for the development of a clear-cut conscious nation\r\nand a powerful government as the political instrument of that nation. In\r\nspite of the great Chinese emphasis which Sun pronounced in his ideology,\r\nand in spite of his many close associations with old Chinese thought, his\r\ngovernmental principles are in a sense diametrically opposed to\r\nConfucianism. Confucius sought to establish a totalitarian system of\r\ntraditional controls which would perpetuate society and civilization\r\nregardless of the misadventures or inadequacies of government. Sun Yat-sen\r\nwas seeking to build a strong liberal protective state within the\r\nframework of an immemorial society which was largely non-political; his\r\ndoctrine, which we may call totalitarianism in reverse, tended to\r\nencourage intellectual freedom rather than any rigid ideological\r\ncoördination. The mere fact that Sun Yat-sen trusted the old Chinese\r\nideology to the ordeal of free criticism is, of course, further testimony\r\nto his belief in the fundamental soundness of the old intellectual\r\norder—an order which needed revision and supplementation to guide modern\r\nChina through the perils of its destiny.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a brief consideration of the nature of the society to be\r\ndeveloped through this nationalist ideology, it may be interesting to note\r\nthe value-scheme in the ideology. There was but one value—the survival of\r\nthe Chinese people with their own civilization. All other considerations\r\nwere secondary; all other reforms were means and not ends. Nationalism,\r\ndemocracy, and _min shêng_ were each indispensable, but none was superior\r\nto the supreme desideratum, Chinese survival. That this survival was a\r\nvivid problem to Sun, almost any of his lectures will testify. Tai\r\nChi-tao, one of the inner circle of Sun Yat-sen’s disciples, summarized\r\nthe spirit of this nationalism when he wrote; “We are Chinese, and those\r\nthings that we have to change first lie in China. But if all things in\r\nChina have become worthless, if Chinese culture no longer has any\r\nsignificance in the cultural history of the world, if the Chinese people\r\nhas lost its power of holding its culture high, we might as well wait for\r\ndeath with bound hands—what would be the use of going on with\r\nrevolution?”(105) Sun Yat-sen made concessions to cosmopolitanism, which\r\nhe saw as ideal to be realized in the remote future. First and last,\r\nhowever, he was concerned with his own people, the Chinese.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be the nature of the society which would arise from the\r\nknowledge and application of the new ideology? Sun planned to introduce\r\nthe idea of a race-nation into the Chinese ideology, to replace the\r\ndefinite but formless we-you outlook which the Chinese of old China had\r\nhad toward outsiders almost indiscriminately.(106) The old anti-barbarian\r\nsentiment had from time to time in the past been very powerful; Sun\r\nYat-sen called this nationalism also, not distinguishing it from the new\r\nkind of nationalism which he advocated—a modern nationalism necessarily\r\nconnoting a plurality of equal nations. The self-consciousness of the\r\nChinese he wished to restore, although on a basis of justice and the\r\nmutual recognition by the nations of each other’s right to exist. But this\r\nnationalism was not to be a complete break with the past, for the new\r\nChina was to continue the traditional function of old China—of being the\r\nteacher and protectress of Eastern Asia. It was the duty of China to\r\ndefend the oppressed among the nations, and to smite down the Great Powers\r\nin their oppressiveness. We may suppose that this benevolence of the\r\nChinese race-nation would benefit the neighbors of China only so long as\r\nthose neighbors, quickened themselves by nationalist resurgences, did not\r\nsee something sinister in the benevolent manifest destiny of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of policy, rather than of ideology, as to what the Chinese\r\nnation was to include. There were possibilities of a conflict with the\r\nCommunists over the question of Outer Mongolia. Physically, Sun saw the\r\nMongols as one of the five component peoples of the Great Chung-hua\r\nRepublic. At another time he suggested that they might become assimilated.\r\nHe never urged the Mongols to separate from China and join the Soviet\r\nUnion, or even continue as a completely independent state.(107) There was\r\nalways the possibility of uncertainty in the case of persons who were—by\r\nthe five principle elements of race (according to Sun Yat-sen, blood,\r\nlivelihood, language, religion, and mores)(108)—members of the Chinese\r\nrace-nation but did not consider themselves such.\r\n\r\nChinese nationalism was to lead to cosmopolitanism. Any attempt to foster\r\ncosmopolitanism before solving the national problem was not only Utopian\r\nbut perverse. The weakness of the Chinese had in great part been derived\r\nfrom their delusions of world-order in a world that was greater than they\r\nimagined, and the true solution to the Chinese question was to be found,\r\nnot in any vain theory for the immediate salvation of the world as a\r\nwhole, but in the diligent and patriotic activities of the Chinese in\r\ntheir own country. China was to help the oppressed nations of the earth,\r\nnot the oppressed classes. China was to help all Asia, and especially the\r\ncountries which had depended upon China for protection, and had been\r\nfailed in their hour of need by the impotent Manchu Dynasty. China was,\r\nindeed, to seek the coöperation of the whole world, and the promotion of\r\nuniversal peace. But China was to do all this only when she was in a\r\nposition to be able to do so, and not in the meantime venture forth on any\r\nsplendid fantasies which would profit no people.\r\n\r\nThe survival of China was the supreme aim of Sun Yat-sen. How did he\r\npropose that China, once conscious of itself, should control itself to\r\nsurvive and go onwards to the liberation and enrichment of mankind? These\r\nare questions that he answered in his ideology of democracy and of _min\r\nshêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE THEORY OF DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocracy in the Old World-Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing a few of the characteristics of the old ideology and the old\r\nsociety which may assist the clarification of the principle of democracy,\r\nit may prove useful to enter into a brief examination of what the word may\r\nmean in the West, to refer to some of the ideas and institutions of old\r\nChina that were or were not in accord with the Western notion of\r\ndemocracy, and, finally, to see what connection Sun Yat-sen’s theory of\r\ndemocracy may have either with the Western term or with elements in the\r\nChinese background. Did Sun Yat-sen propound an entirely new theory as the\r\nfoundation of his theory of democracy for the Chinese race-nation, or did\r\nhe associate several hitherto unrelated ideas and systems to make a new\r\nwhole?\r\n\r\nThe European word _democracy_ may, for the purposes of this examination,\r\nbe taken to have two parts to its meaning; first, with regard to the\r\nstatus of individuals in society; second, with respect to the allocation\r\nof political power in society. In the former sense, democracy may refer to\r\nan equalitarianism of status, or to a social mobility so easy and so\r\ngeneral as to encourage the impression that position is a consequence of\r\nthe behavior of the individual, and a fair gauge to his merit. In the\r\nlatter part of the meaning, democracy may refer to the identification of\r\nthe governed and the governors, or to the coincidence of the actions of\r\nthe governors with the wishes of the governed. Each of these\r\nideas—equalitarianism, free mobility, popular government, and\r\nrepresentative government—has been referred to as the essence of\r\ndemocracy. One of them may lead to the discovery of a significance for\r\ndemocracy relevant to the scheme of things in the old Chinese society.\r\n\r\nEgalitarianism and mobility were both present in old Chinese society. The\r\nChinese have had neither an hereditary aristocracy equivalent to the\r\nWestern, nor a caste-system resembling that of India or Japan, since the\r\nbreakdown of the feudal system twenty-three centuries ago.(109) The\r\nextra-legal egalitarianism of the Chinese has been so generally remarked\r\nupon by persons familiar with that nation, that further discussion of it\r\nhere is superfluous. Birth has probably counted less in China than it has\r\nin any other country in the world.\r\n\r\nThe egalitarianism of intercourse was a powerful aid to social mobility.\r\nThe Chinese never pretended to economic, political, or intellectual\r\nequality; the mere statement of such a doctrine would have been sufficient\r\nrefutation of it to the members of the old society. Yet there were no\r\ngradations of weight beyond educational, political, and economic\r\ndistinctions, and the organization of the old society was such that\r\nmobility in these was relatively free. Movement of an individual either\r\nupwards or downwards in the economic, political, or academic scale was\r\nretarded by the influence of the family, which acted as a drag either way.\r\nMovement was nevertheless continuous and conspicuous; a proof of this\r\nmovement is to be found in the fact that there are really no supremely\r\ngreat families in China, comparable to the great names of Japan or of the\r\nEuramerican nations. (The closest approximation to this is the _K’ung_\r\nfamily, the family of Confucius; since the family is large, its eminence\r\nis scarcely more than nominal and it has no political power.).\r\n\r\nMobility in China was fostered by the political arrangements. The\r\neducational-administrative system provided a channel upwards and\r\ndownwards. The government tended, for the most part, to be the way up,\r\nwhile the economic system was the way down for prominent official\r\nfamilies. Few families managed to remain eminent for more than a few\r\ngenerations, and—with the great size of families—there was always room at\r\nthe top. If a man were not advancing himself, there was always the\r\npossibility that a kinsman might win preferment, to the economic and\r\npolitical advantage of the whole family group.\r\n\r\nSocial relations—in the narrowest sense of the word—were characterized by\r\nan extreme attention to form as such, and great contempt for it otherwise.\r\nRitualism never became a chivalry or a cult of honor. There was always the\r\nemphasis upon propriety and courtesy but, once the formalities were done\r\nwith, there was little social distinction between members of different\r\neconomic, political, or academic classes.(110)\r\n\r\nIn connection with control and representation, a great deal more can be\r\nsaid. In the first place, the relations between the governing ideologue in\r\nthe Confucian teachings,(111) and the governed accepters of the ideology\r\nin the Confucian system were to be discovered through _yüeh_.\r\n\r\n_Yüeh_, commonly translated “music” or “harmony,” plays a peculiar rôle in\r\nthe Confucian teachings. It is the mass and individual emotional pattern,\r\nas _li_ is the behavior pattern. If the people follow the proper behavior\r\npattern, their emotional pattern must also be good. Consequently, the\r\nfunction of a truly excellent ruler was the scrutiny of _yüeh_. If he were\r\na man of superior penetration, he should be able to feel the _yüeh_ about\r\nhim, and thus discover the temper of the populace, without reference to\r\nelectoral machinery or any other government instrumentality. _Yüeh_ is to\r\nbe seen in the tone of voices, in the rhythm of behavior. If it is good,\r\nit will act with increasing effect upon itself. If bad, it serves as a\r\nwarning to the authorities. As Prof. Hsü says, “For rulers and\r\nadministrators _yüeh_ has two uses; first, it enables them to ascertain\r\nthe general sentiment of the people toward the government and political\r\nlife; and second, it cultivates a type of individual attitude that is most\r\nharmonious with the environment. The joint work of _li_ and _yüeh_ would\r\nproduce social harmony and social happiness—which is the ultimate aim of\r\nthe State.”(112)\r\n\r\n_Yüeh_ is, however, a peculiar phenomenon, which can scarcely be called\r\neither representation or control. It is an idea rooted in the curiously\r\npragmatic-mystical world-view of the Confucians, that same world-view\r\nwhich elevated virtue almost to the level of a physical substance, subject\r\nto the same sort of laws of disruption or transmission. Nothing like\r\n_yüeh_ can be found in Western political thought; however significant it\r\nmay have been in China, any attempt to deal with it in a Western language\r\nwould have more than a touch of futility, because of the great chasm of\r\nstrangeness that separates the two intellectual worlds at so many places.\r\n\r\nA more concrete illustration of the old Chinese ideas of popular control\r\nmay be found in the implications of political Confucianism, as Hsü renders\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the Confucian doctrine of stewardship, namely, that the king\r\n    is an ordinary person selected by God upon his merit to serve as\r\n    the steward of God in the control of the affairs of the people for\r\n    the welfare of the people, there are deduced five theories of\r\n    political democracy. In the first place, the government must\r\n    respect public opinion. The will of the people is the will of God,\r\n    and thus the king should obey both the will of the people and the\r\n    will of God....\r\n\r\n    In the second place, government should be based upon the consent\r\n    of the governed....\r\n\r\n    In the third place, the people have a duty as well as a right to\r\n    carry on revolution as the last resort in stopping tyranny....\r\n    Revolution is regarded as a natural blessing; it guards against\r\n    tyranny and promotes the vitality of the people. It is in complete\r\n    harmony with natural law.\r\n\r\n    In the fourth place, the government exists for the welfare of the\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n    In the fifth place, liberty, equality and equity should be\r\n    preserved. The State belong equally to all; and so hereditary\r\n    nobility, hereditary monarchy, and despotism are deplored.\r\n    Confucius and his disciples seem to advocate a democracy under the\r\n    form of an elective monarchy or a constitutional monarchy....\r\n\r\n    Local self-government is recognized in the Confucian system of\r\n    government.... The Confucian theory of educational election\r\n    suggests the distinctly new idea of representation.(113)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis summary could scarcely be improved upon although it represents a\r\nconsiderable latitude of interpretation in the subject-matter of the\r\nclassics. The voice of the people was the voice of God. From other\r\npolitical writers of antiquity—Mêng Tzŭ, Mo Ti, Han Fei Tzŭ and the\r\nLegalists, and others—the Chinese received a variety of political\r\ninterpretations, none of which fostered the development of autocracy as it\r\ndeveloped in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is simple. In addition to the eventual popular control\r\nof government, and the necessity for the close attention of the government\r\nto the wishes of the people, the classical writers, for the most part, did\r\nnot emphasize the position of government. With the increasing ideological\r\nsolidarity of the Chinese world, the increasing antiquity and authority of\r\ntradition, and the stability of the social system, the Chinese states\r\nwithered away—never completely, but definitely more so than their\r\nanalogues in the West. There appeared, consequently, in China a form of\r\nlaissez-faire that surpassed that of Europe completely in thoroughness.\r\nNot only were the economic functions of the state reduced to a minimum—so\r\nwas its police activity. Old China operated with a government in reserve,\r\nas it were; a government which was nowhere nearly so important to its\r\nsubjects as Western governments commonly are. The government system was\r\none democratic in that it was rooted in a society without intransigeant\r\nclass lines, with a considerable degree of social mobility for the\r\nindividual, with the total number of individuals exercising a terrific and\r\noccasionally overwhelming pressure against the political system. And yet\r\nit was not the governmental system upon which old China might have based\r\nits claim to be a democracy. It could have, had it so wished, claimed that\r\nname because of the weakness or the absence of government, and the\r\npresence of other social organizations permitting the individual a\r\nconsiderable amount of latent pressure to exercise upon his social\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThis arose from the nature of the large non-political organizations which\r\nsustained Chinese civilization even more than did the\r\neducational-administrative authorities. It is obvious that, in theory, a\r\nfree and unassociated individual in a laissez-faire polity would be\r\ndefenseless against extra-politically organized persons. The equities of\r\nmodern democracy lie largely in the development of a check and balance\r\nsystem of pressure groups, affording each individual adequate means of\r\nexercising pressure on behalf of his various interests. It was this\r\nfunction—the development of a just statement of pressure-groups—which the\r\nold Chinese world-society developed for the sufficient representation of\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\nThere was no illusion of complete personal liberty. Such a notion was\r\nscarcely thinkable. Every individual had his family, his village,\r\nand—although this was by no means universally true—his _hui_, whether one\r\nor, less commonly, several. He was never left solitary and defenseless\r\nagainst powerfully organized interests. No more intimate community of\r\ninterests could be discovered than that of a family, since the community\r\nof interests there would verge on the total. Ancient Chinese society\r\nprovided the individual with mechanisms to make his interests felt and\r\neffective, through the family, the village, and the association.\r\n\r\nIn the West the line of influence runs from the individual, who feels a\r\nwant, to the group which assists him in expressing it, to the government,\r\nupon which the group exercises pressure, in order that the government may\r\nuse its power to secure what the first group wants from some other group.\r\nThe line runs, as it were, in the following manner:\r\nindividual-group-government-group. In China the group exercised its\r\npressure for the most part directly. The individual need not incorporate\r\nhimself in a group to secure the recognition and fulfillment of his\r\ninterests; he was by birth a member of the group, and with the group was\r\nmobile. In a sense old Chinese society was thoroughly democratic.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of such a background, Sun Yat-sen did not believe that the\r\nChinese had too much government, but, rather, too little. He did not cry\r\nfor liberty; he denounced its excess instead. On the basis of the old\r\nsocial organization, which was fluid and yet stable, he sought to create a\r\ndemocracy which would pertain to the interests of the nation as a whole,\r\nnot to the interests of individuals or groups. These could go on in the\r\ntraditional manner. The qualifications implicit in Sun Yat-sen’s\r\nchampionship of democracy must be kept in mind, and his acquaintance with\r\nthe democratic techniques of the old society be allowed for. Otherwise his\r\nadvocacy of the recognition of nationalist rights and his neglect or\r\ndenunciation of individual liberties might be taken for the dogma of a\r\nlover of tyranny or dictatorship.\r\n\r\nOld China possessed a considerable degree of egalitarianism, of social\r\nmobility, of popular control, and of popular participation, through the\r\ncivil service, in what little government there was. In addition,\r\nideological control ensured a minimum of conflicts of interests and\r\nconsequently a maximum facility for self-expression without conflict with\r\nother individuals, groups, or society as a whole. Finally, the protection\r\nand advancement of individuals’ rights and interests were fostered by a\r\nsystem of group relationships which bound virtually every individual into\r\na group and left none to fall, solitary, at the mercy of others who were\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nWhy then did Sun Yat-sen advocate democracy? What were his justifications\r\nfor it, in a society already so democratic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Justifications of a Democratic Ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen, realizing the inescapable necessity of nationalism, did not\r\nimmediately turn to democracy as a necessary instrument for its promotion.\r\nHe hated the Manchus on the Dragon Throne—human symbols of China’s\r\nsubjugation—but at first considered replacing them with a new Chinese\r\ndynasty. It was only after he had found the heirs of the Ming dynasty and\r\nthe descendants of Confucius to be unworthy that he turned to\r\nrepublicanism and found democracy, with its many virtues.(114) He early\r\nbecame enamored of the elective system, as found in the United States, as\r\nthe only means of obtaining the best governors.(115) In the final stage he\r\nhad departed so far from his earlier way of thinking that he criticized\r\nDr. Goodnow severely for recommending the re-introduction of a monarchy in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen, as a good nationalist, made earnest efforts to associate his\r\ndoctrines with those of the sages and to avoid appearing as a proponent of\r\nWestern civilization. It is, consequently, not unusual to discover him\r\nciting Confucius and Mencius on _vox populi vox dei_, and saying,\r\n\r\n“The government of Yao and Shun was monarchical in name but democratic in\r\npractice, and for that reason Confucius honored these men.”(116)\r\n\r\nHe considered that democracy was to the sages an “ideal that could not be\r\nimmediately realized,”(117) and therefore implied that modern China, in\r\nrealizing democracy, was attaining an ideal cherished by the past.\r\nDemocracy, other things apart, was a filial duty. This argument, while\r\npersuasive in Chinese, can scarcely be considered Sun Yat-sen’s most\r\nimportant one in favor of democracy.\r\n\r\nHis most cogent and perhaps most necessary argument was based on his\r\nconception of national liberty as opposed to the liberty of the\r\nindividual. He delivered a spirited denunciation of those foreigners who\r\ncriticized the Chinese for being without liberty, and in the next breath\r\ncomplained that the Chinese had no government, that they were “loose\r\nsand.” (Another fashionable way of expressing this idea is by saying that\r\n“China is a geographical expression.”) He said: “If, for instance, the\r\nforeigners say that China is ‘loose sand,’ what do they finally mean by\r\nthat expression? They mean to say that each individual is free, that\r\neverybody is free, that each one takes the maximum of liberty, and that,\r\nas a result, they are ‘loose sand’.”(118) He pointed out that the Chinese\r\nhad not suffered from the loose autocracy in the Empire, and that they had\r\nno historical justification for parroting the cry “Liberty!” simply\r\nbecause the Westerners, who had really lacked it, had cried and fought for\r\nit. He cited John Millar’s definition of liberty, given in _The Progress\r\nof Science Relative to Law and Government_, 1787: “True liberty consists\r\nin this: that the liberty of each individual is limited by the\r\nnon-infringement on the liberty of others; when it invades the liberty of\r\nothers, it is no longer liberty.”(119) Sun Yat-sen had himself defined\r\nliberty as follows: “Liberty consists in being able to move, in having\r\nfreedom of action within an organized group.”(120) China, disorganized,\r\nhad no problem of individual liberty. There was, as a matter of fact, too\r\nmuch liberty.(121) What the Chinese had to do was to sacrifice some of\r\ntheir individual liberty for the sake of the organized nation. Here we\r\nfind a curious turn of thought of which several other examples may be\r\nfound in the _San Min Chu I_: Sun Yat-sen has taken a doctrine which in\r\nthe West applies to the individual, and has applied it to the nation. He\r\nbelieves in liberty; but it is not the liberty of the individual which is\r\nendangered in China. It is the liberty of the nation—which has been lost\r\nbefore foreign oppression and exploitation. Consequently he preaches\r\nnational and not individual liberty. Individual liberty must be sacrificed\r\nfor the sake of a free nation.(122) Without discipline there is no order;\r\nwithout order the nation is weak and oppressed. The first step to China’s\r\nredemption is _min tsu_, the union (nationalism) of the people. Then comes\r\n_min ch’üan_, the power of the people. The liberty of the nation is\r\nexpressed through the power of the people.\r\n\r\nHow is the power of the people to be exercised? It is to be exercised by\r\ndemocratic means. To Sun Yat-sen, the liberty of the nation and the power\r\nof the people were virtually identical. If the Chinese race gained its\r\nfreedom, that freedom, exercised in an orderly manner, could mean only\r\ndemocracy. It is this close association of nationalism (_min tsu_) and\r\ndemocracy (_min ch’üan_), this consideration of democracy as the\r\nexpression of nationalism, that forms, within the framework of the _San\r\nMin Chu I_, what is probably the best nationalist argument for\r\ndemocracy—best, that is, in being most coherent with the Three Principles\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nIf the view of democracy just expressed be considered an exposition of the\r\nfundamental necessity of democracy, the third argument may be termed the\r\ndialectical or historical championship of democracy. Sun Yat-sen believed\r\nin the existence of progress, and considered that there was an inevitable\r\ntendency toward democracy: the overthrow of the Manchus was a result of\r\nthe “... world tide. That world current can be compared to the course of\r\nthe Yangtze or the Yellow River. The flow of the stream turns perhaps in\r\nmany directions, now toward the north, now toward the south, but in the\r\nend flows toward the east in spite of all obstacles; nothing can stem it.\r\nIn the same way the world-tide passes ...; now it has arrived at\r\ndemocracy, and there is no way to stem it.”(123) This belief in the\r\ninevitability as well as the justice of his cause encouraged Sun, and has\r\nlent to his movement—as his followers see it—something of the impressive\r\nsweep that the Communists see in their movement.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not devise any elaborate scheme of dialectical materialism\r\nor economic determinism to bolster his belief in the irreversibility of\r\nthe flow to democracy. With infinite simplicity, he presented an\r\nexposition of democracy in space and time. In time, he saw a change from\r\nthe rule of force to theocracy, then to monarchy, and then to democracy;\r\nthis change was a part of the progress of mankind, which to him was\r\nself-evident and inevitable.(124) In space he perceived that increasingly\r\ngreat numbers of people threw off monarchical rule and turned to\r\ndemocracy. He hailed the breakdown of the great empires, Germany and\r\nRussia, as evidence of the power of democracy. “... if we observe (things)\r\nfrom all angles, we see that the world progresses daily, and we realize\r\nthat the present tide has already swept into the age of democracy; and\r\nthat no matter how great drawbacks and failures may be, _democracy will\r\nmaintain itself in the world for a long time_ (_to come_). For that\r\nreason, thirty years ago, we promoters of the revolution, _resolved that\r\nit was impossible to speak of the greatness of China or to carry out the\r\nrevolution without advocating democracy_.”(125)\r\n\r\nA fourth argument in favor of democracy, and one which cannot be expanded\r\nhere, since it involves reference to Sun Yat-sen’s practical plans for the\r\npolitical regeneration of China, was his assertion that democracy was an\r\nadjunct to appropriate and effective public administration. Sun Yat-sen’s\r\nplans concerning the selection of officials in a democratic state showed\r\nthat he believed the merging of the Chinese academic-civil service\r\ntechnique with Western democracy would produce a paragon among practicable\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nFifthly and finally, Sun regarded democracy as an essential modernizing\r\nforce.(126) In the introduction of Western material civilization, which\r\nwas always an important consideration to his mind, he felt that a certain\r\nideological and political change had to accompany the economic and\r\ntechnological revolution that—in part natural and in part to be stimulated\r\nby nationalist political interference—was to revolutionize the _min shêng_\r\nof China, the economic and social welfare of the Chinese people. While\r\nthis argument in favor of democracy is similar to the historical argument,\r\nit differs from the latter in that Sun Yat-sen saw the technique of\r\ndemocracy influencing not only the political, but the economic and social,\r\nlife of the people as well. The growth of corporate responsibility, the\r\ndevelopment of a more rigid ethical system in matters of finance, the\r\ndisappearance of too strict an emphasis upon the personal element in\r\npolitics (which has clouded Chinese politics with a fog of conspiracy and\r\nintrigue for centuries), a trust in mathematics (as shown in reliance upon\r\nthe voting technique for ascertaining public opinion), and the development\r\nof a new kind of individual aggressiveness and uprightness were among the\r\nchanges which, necessary if China was to compete in the modern world,\r\ndemocracy might assist in effecting. While these desiderata do not seem\r\nlarge when set down in the vast field of political philosophy, they are of\r\nirritating importance in the inevitable trivalities upon which so much of\r\nday-to-day life depends, and would undoubtedly improve the personal tone\r\nof Sino-Western relations. Sun never divorced the theoretical aspects of\r\nhis thought from the practical, as has been done here for purposes of\r\nexposition, and even the tiniest details of everyday existence were the\r\nobjects of his consideration and criticism. In itself, therefore, the\r\nmodernizing force of democracy, as seen in Sun’s theory, may not amount to\r\nmuch; nevertheless, it must not be forgotten.(127)\r\n\r\nDemocracy, although secondary in point of time to his theory, is of great\r\nimportance in Sun’s plans for the political nature of the new China. He\r\njustified democracy because it was (1) an obligation laid upon modern\r\nChina by the sages of antiquity; (2) a necessary consequence of\r\nnationalism, since nationalism was the self-rule of a free people, and\r\ndemocracy the effectuation of that self-rule, and democracy the\r\neffectuation of that self-rule; (3) the government of the modern age;\r\nChina, along with the rest of the world, was drawn by the tide of progress\r\ninto the age of democratic achievement; (4) the political form best\r\ncalculated for the obtaining of good administration; and (5) a modernizing\r\nforce that would stir and change the Chinese people so as to equip them\r\nfor the competitions of the modern world.\r\n\r\nIn the lecture in which he criticized the inadequacies of democracy as\r\napplied in the West, Sun Yat-sen made an interesting comment on the\r\nproletarian dictatorship which had recently been established in Russia.\r\n“Recently Russia invented another form of government. That government is\r\nnot representative; it is _absolute popular government_. In what does that\r\nabsolute popular government really consist? As we know very little about\r\nit, we cannot judge it aright, but we believe that this (absolute popular\r\ngovernment) is _evidently much better than a representative\r\ngovernment_.”(128) He went on immediately to say that the Three Principles\r\nwere what China needed, and that the Chinese should not imitate the\r\npolitical systems advocated in Europe and America, but should adapt\r\ndemocracy in their own way. In view of his objection to a permanent class\r\ndictatorship, as opposed to a provisional party dictatorship, and the very\r\nenthusiastic advocacy of democracy represented by the arguments described\r\nabove, it appears unlikely in the extreme that Sun Yat-sen, had he lived\r\nbeyond 1925, would have abandoned his own plan of democracy for China in\r\nfavor of “absolute popular government.” The phrase was, at the time, since\r\nSun Yat-sen was seeking Russian assistance, expedient for a popular\r\nlecture. Its importance might easily be exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Natural Classes of Men.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving in mind the extreme peril in which the Chinese race-nation stood,\r\nits importance in a world of Western or Western-type states, and seeing\r\nnationalism as the sole means of defending and preserving China, Sun\r\nYat-sen demanded that the Chinese ideology be extended by the acquisition\r\nof knowledge. If this modernizing and, if a neologism be permitted,\r\nstateizing process were to succeed, it must needs be fostered by a\r\nwell-prepared group of persons within the society.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Confucian social theory, it was the scholars who took\r\nthe ideology from the beliefs and traditions of the agrarian masses or\r\nwhole people, rectified it, and gave it back to them. This continuous\r\nprocess of ideological maintenance by means of conformity (_li_) and, when\r\nfound necessary, rectification (_chêng ming_) was carried on by an\r\neducational-political system based upon a non-hereditary caste of\r\nacademician-officials called _Mandarins_ by the early Western travellers.\r\nIn the case of those modern Western states which base their power upon\r\npeculiar ideologies, the philosophy-imposing caste has been a more or less\r\npermanent party- or class-dictatorship. Superficially, the\r\nparty-dictatorship planned by Sun Yat-sen would seem to resemble these.\r\nHis theory, however, presents two bases for a class of ideologues: one\r\ntheoretical, and presumably based upon the Chinese; and one applied, which\r\nis either of his own invention or derived from Western sources. The class\r\nof ideological reformers proposed in what may be called the applied aspect\r\nof his theory was to be organized by means of the party-dictatorship of\r\nthe Kuomintang. His other basis for finding a class of persons whose\r\ninfluence over the ideology was to be paramount was more theoretical, and\r\ndeserves consideration among the more abstract aspects of his doctrines.\r\n\r\nHe hypothecated a tripartite division of men:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Men may be divided into three classes according to their innate\r\n    ability or intelligence. The first class of men may be called\r\n    _hsien chih hsien cho_ or the “geniuses.” The geniuses are endowed\r\n    with unusual intelligence and ability. They are the creators of\r\n    new ideas, fathers of invention, and originators of new\r\n    achievements. They think in terms of group welfare and so they are\r\n    the promoters of progress. Next are the _hou chih hou cho_ or the\r\n    “followers.” Being less intelligent and capable than the _hsien\r\n    chih hsien cho_, they do not create or invent or originate, but\r\n    they are good imitators and followers of the first class of men.\r\n    The last are the _pu chih pu cho_, or the “unthinking,” whose\r\n    intelligence is inferior to that of the other two classes of men.\r\n    These people do what the others instruct them to do, but they do\r\n    not think about it. In every sphere of activity all three classes\r\n    of men are present. In politics, for example, there are the\r\n    creators or inventors of new ideas and movements, then the\r\n    propagators of these ideas and movements, and lastly the mass of\r\n    men who are taught to practice these ideas.(129)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harmony of this conception with the views of Confucius is evident.\r\nPresbyter is Priest writ large; genius is another name for scholar. Sun,\r\nalthough bitterly opposed to the mandarinate of the Empire and the\r\npseudo-Republic, could not rid himself of the age-old Chinese idea of a\r\nclass organization on a basis of intellect rather than of property. He\r\ncould not champion a revolutionary creed based upon an economic class-war\r\nwhich he did not think existed, and which he did not wish to foster, in\r\nhis own country. He continued instead the consistent theory of an\r\naristocracy of intellect, such as had controlled China before his coming.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy of intellect is not to be judged, however, by the old\r\ncriteria. Under the old regime, a scholar-ruler was one who deferred to\r\nthe wisdom of the ancients, who was fit to perpetuate the mysteries of the\r\nwritten language and culture for the benefit of future ages, and who was\r\nmeanwhile qualified by his training to assume the rôle of counsellor and\r\nauthority in society. In the theory of Sun Yat-sen, the genius leader is\r\nnot the perpetuator but the discoverer. He is the social engineer. His\r\nwork is similar to that of the architect who devises plans for a building\r\nwhich is to be built by workers (the unthinking) under the guidance of\r\nforemen (the followers).(130) In this guise, the new intellectual\r\naristocrat is a figure more akin to the romantic Western pioneers and\r\ninventors than to the serene, conservative scholars of China in the past.\r\n\r\nThe break with Western thought comes in Sun’s distinguishing three\r\npermanent, natural classes of men. Though in their aptitudes the _hsien\r\nchih hsien cho_ are more like modern engineers than like archaic literary\r\nhistorians, they form a class that is inevitably the ruling class. To\r\nMarxism this is anathema; it would imply that the Communist party is\r\nmerely the successor of the bourgeoisie in leading the unthinking masses\r\nabout—a more benevolent successor, to be sure, but still a class distinct\r\nfrom the led proletariat of the intellect. To Western democratic thought,\r\nthis distinction would seem at first glance to invalidate any future\r\nadvocacy of democracy. To the student interested in contrasting\r\nideological control and political government, the tripartite division of\r\nSun Yat-sen is significant of the redefinition in modern terms, and in an\r\neven more clear-cut manner, of the Confucian theory of scholarly\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nHow were the geniuses of the Chinese resurgence to make their knowledge\r\nuseful to the race-nation? How could democracy be recognized with the\r\nleadership and ideological control of an intellectual class? To what\r\ndegree would such a reconciliation, if effected, represent a continuation,\r\nin different terms, of the traditions and institutions of the old Chinese\r\nworld? Questions such as these arise from the fusion of the old traditions\r\nand new necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCh’üan and Nêng.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contrast between _ch’üan_ and _nêng_ is one of the few aspects of Sun\r\nYat-sen’s theory of democracy which persons not interested in China may,\r\nconceivably, regard as a contribution to political science. There is an\r\nextraordinarily large number of possible translations for each of these\r\nwords.(131) A version which may prove convenient and not inaccurate, can\r\nbe obtained by translating each Chinese term according to its context.\r\nThus, a fairly clear idea of _ch’üan_ may be obtained if one says that,\r\napplied to the individual, it means “power,” or “right,” and when applied\r\nto the exercise of political functions, it means “sovereignty” or\r\n“political proprietorship.” _Nêng_, applied to the individual, may mean\r\n“competency” (in the everyday sense of the word), “capacity” or “ability\r\nto administer.” Applied to the individual, the contrast is between the\r\nability to have political rights in a democracy, and the ability to\r\nadminister public affairs. Applied to the nation, the contrast is between\r\nsovereignty and administration.(132)\r\n\r\nWithout this contrast, the doctrine of the tripartite classification of\r\nmen might destroy all possibilities of a practical democracy. If the\r\nUnthinking are the majority, how can democracy be trusted? This contrast,\r\nfurthermore, serves to illuminate a further problem: the paradoxical\r\nnecessity of an all-powerful government which the people are able to\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIf this distinction is accepted in the establishment of a democracy, what\r\nwill the consequences be?(133)\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the masses who rule will not necessarily govern.\r\nWithin the framework of a democratic constitution, they will be able to\r\nexpress their wishes, and make those wishes effective; but it will be\r\nimpossible for them to interfere in the personnel of government, whether\r\nmerely administrative or in the highest positions. It will be forever\r\nimpossible that a “swine-representative” should be elected, or that one of\r\nthose transient epochs of carpet-baggery, which appear from time to time\r\nin most Western democracies, should corrupt the government. By means of\r\nthe popular rights of initiative, referendum, election and recall, the\r\npeople will be able to control their government in the broad sweep of\r\npolicy. The government will be beyond their reach insofar as petty\r\npolitical interference, leading to inferiority or corruption, is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the benefits of aristocracy will be obtained without\r\nits cost. The government will be made up of men especially fit and trained\r\nto govern. There will, hence, be no difficulty in permitting the\r\ngovernment to become extraordinarily powerful in contrast with Western\r\ngovernments. Since the masses will be able to choose between a wide\r\nselection of able leaders, the democracy will be safeguarded.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen regarded this as one of the cardinal points in his doctrines.\r\nIn retaining the old Chinese idea of a scholar class and simultaneously\r\nadmitting Western elective and other democratic techniques, he believed\r\nthat he had found a scheme which surpassed all others. He saw the people\r\nas stockholders in a company, and the administrators as directors; he saw\r\nthe people as the owner of an automobile, and the administrators as the\r\nchauffeur.\r\n\r\nA further consequence of this difference between the right of voting and\r\nthe right of being voted for, but one to which Sun Yat-sen did not refer,\r\nnecessarily arises from his postulation of a class of geniuses leading\r\ntheir followers, who control the unthinking masses. That is the continuity\r\nwhich such a group of ideological controllers would impart to a democracy.\r\nSun Yat-sen, addressing Chinese, took the Chinese world for granted. A\r\nWesterner, unmindful of the background, might well overlook some\r\ncomparatively simple points. The old system, under which the Empire was a\r\nsort of educational system, was a familiar feature in the politics which\r\nSun Yat-sen criticized. In arguing for the political acceptance of\r\ninequality and the guarantee of government by a select group, Sun was\r\ncontinuing the old idea of leadership, modifying it only so far as to make\r\nit consistent with democracy. Under the system he proposed, the two great\r\ndefects of democracy, untrustworthiness and lack of continuity of policy,\r\nwould be largely eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Machine State.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout pre-modern Chinese thought there runs the idea of personal\r\nbehavior and personal controls. The Chinese could not hypostatize in the\r\nmanner of the West. Looking at men they saw men and nothing more.\r\nConsidering the problems and difficulties which men encountered, they\r\nsought solutions in terms of men and the conditioning intimacies of each\r\nindividual’s life. The Confucian Prince was not so much an administrator\r\nas a moral leader; his influence, extending itself through imitation on\r\nthe part of others, was personal and social rather than political.(134) In\r\nsucceeding ages, the scholars thought of themselves as the leaven of\r\nvirtue in society. They stressed deportment and sought, only too\r\nfrequently by means of petty formalities, to impress their own excellence\r\nand pre-eminence upon the people. Rarely, if ever, did the\r\nscholar-official appeal to formal political law. He was more likely to\r\ninvoke propriety and proceed to exercise his authority theoretically in\r\naccordance with it.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not feel that further appeal to the intellectual leaders\r\nwas necessary. In an environment still dominated by the past, an\r\nexhortation for the traditional personal aspect of leadership would\r\nprobably have appeared as a centuries-old triteness. The far-seeing men,\r\nthe geniuses that Sun saw in all society, owed their superiority not to\r\nartificial inequality but to natural inequality;(135) by their ability\r\nthey were outstanding. Laws and customs could outrage this natural\r\ninequality, or conceal it behind a legal facade of artificial inequality\r\nor equally artificial equality. Laws and customs do not change the facts.\r\nThe superior man was innately the superior man.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the geniuses of the Chinese revolution could not rely upon\r\nthe loose and personal system of influence hitherto trusted. To organize\r\nChinese nationalism, to give it direction as well as force, the power of\r\nthe people must be run through a machine—the State.\r\n\r\nA distinction must be made here. The term “machine,” applied to\r\ngovernment, was itself a neologism introduced from the Japanese.(136) Not\r\nonly was the word but the thing itself was alien to the Chinese, since the\r\nsame term (_ch’i_) meant machinery, tool, or instrument. The introduction\r\nof the view of the state as a machine does not imply that Sun Yat-sen\r\nwished to introduce a specific form of Western state-machine into China—as\r\nwill be later explained (in the pages which concern themselves with the\r\napplied political science of Sun Yat-sen).\r\n\r\nSun was careful, moreover, to explain that his analogy between industrial\r\nmachinery and political machinery was merely an analogy. He said, “The\r\nmachinery of the government is entirely composed of human beings. All its\r\nmotions are brought about by men and not by material objects. Therefore,\r\nthere is a very great difference between the machinery of the government\r\nand the manufacturing machine ... the machinery of the government is moved\r\nby human agency whereas the manufacturing machine is set in motion by\r\nmaterial forces.”(137)\r\n\r\nEven after allowance has been made for the fact that Sun Yat-sen did not\r\ndesire to import Western governmental machinery, nor even to stress the\r\nmachine and state analogy too far, it still remains extraordinarily\r\nsignificant that he should have impressed upon his followers the necessity\r\nof what may be called a mechanical rather than an organic type of\r\ngovernment. The administrative machine of the Ch’ing dynasty, insofar as\r\nit was a machine at all, was a chaotic mass of political authorities\r\nmelting vaguely into the social system. Sun’s desire to have a clear-cut\r\nmachine of government, while not of supreme importance in his ideological\r\nprojects, was of great significance in his practical proposal. In his\r\ntheory the state machine bears the same resemblance to the old government\r\nthat the Chinese race-nation bears to the now somewhat ambiguous civilized\r\nhumanity of the Confucians. In both instances he was seeking sharper and\r\nmore distinct lines of demarcation.\r\n\r\nIn putting forth his proposals for the reconstitution of the Chinese\r\ngovernment he was thinking, in speaking of a state-machine, of the more or\r\nless clearly understood juristic states of the West.(138) His concrete\r\nproposals dealing with the minutiae of administrative organization, his\r\nemphasis on constitution and law, and his interest in the exact allocation\r\nof control all testify to his complete acceptance of a sharply delimited\r\nstate. On the other hand, he was extraordinary for his time in demanding\r\nan unusual extent, both qualitative and quantitative, of power for the\r\nstate which he wished to hammer out on the forges of the nationalist\r\nsocial and political revolution.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing this description of the instrument with which Sun Yat-sen\r\nhoped to organize the intellectual leaders of China so as to implement the\r\nforce of the revolution, it may be said that it was to be a state-machine,\r\nas opposed to a totalitarian state, based upon Western juristic theory in\r\ngeneral but organized out of the materials of old Chinese political\r\nphilosophy and the Imperial experience in government.(139) The state\r\nmachine was to be built along lines which Sun Yat-sen laid out in some\r\ndetail. Yet, even with his elaborate plans already prepared, and in the\r\nmidst of a revolution, he pointed out the difficulty of political\r\nexperimentation, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... the progress of human machinery, as government organizations\r\n    and the like, has been very slow. What is the reason? It is that\r\n    once a manufacturing machine has been constructed, it can easily\r\n    be tested, and after it has been tried out, it can easily be put\r\n    aside if it is not good, and if it is not perfect, it can easily\r\n    be perfected. But it is very difficult to try out a human machine\r\n    and more difficult still to perfect it after it has been tried\r\n    out. It is impossible to perfect it without bringing about a\r\n    revolution. The only other way would be to regard it as a useless\r\n    material machine which can easily be turned into scrap iron. But\r\n    this is not workable.(140)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemocratic-Political Versus Ideological Control.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen accepted an organization of society based upon intellectual\r\ndifferences, despite his belief in the justifiability and necessity of\r\nformal democracy, and his reconciliation of the two at first contradictory\r\ntheses in a plan for a machine state to be based upon a distinction\r\nbetween _ch’üan_ and _nêng_. It may now be asked, why did Sun Yat-sen,\r\nfamiliar with the old method of ideological control, and himself proposing\r\na new ideology which would not only restore internal harmony but also put\r\nChina into harmony with the actual political condition of the world,\r\ndesire to add formal popular control to ideological control?\r\n\r\nThe answer is not difficult, although it must be based for the most part\r\non inference rather than on direct citation of Sun Yat-sen’s own words. In\r\nthe consideration of the system of ideological control fostered by the\r\nConfucians, ideological control presented two distinct aspects: the\r\nformation of the ideology by men, and control of men by the ideology. The\r\nideology controlled men; some men sought to control the ideology; the\r\nwhole ideological control system was based upon the continuous interaction\r\nof cause and effect, wherein tradition influenced the men who sought to\r\nuse the system as a means of mastery, while the same men succeeded in a\r\ngreater or less degree in directing the development of the ideology.\r\n\r\nIn the old Chinese world-society the control of the ideology was normally\r\nvested in the _literati_ who were either government officials or hoped to\r\nbecome such. The populace, however, acting in conformity with the\r\nideology, could overthrow the government, and, to that extent, consciously\r\ncontrol the content and the development of the ideology. Moreover, as the\r\nefficacy of an ideology depends upon its greater acceptance, the populace\r\nhad the last word in control of the ideology both consciously and\r\nunconsciously. Politics, however, rarely comes to the last word. In the\r\nnormal and ordinary conduct of social affairs, the populace was willing to\r\nlet the _literati_ uphold the classics and modify their teachings in\r\naccordance with the development of the ideology—in the name of _chêng\r\nming_. The old ideology was so skilfully put together out of traditional\r\nelements that are indissociable from the main traits of Chinese culture,\r\ntogether with the revisions made by Confucius and his successors, that it\r\nwas well-nigh unchallengeable. The whole Confucian method of government\r\nwas based, as previously stated, on the control of men through the control\r\nof their ideas by men—and these latter men, the ideologues, were the\r\nscholar administrators of successive dynasties. The identification of the\r\n_literati_ and officials, the respect in which learning was held, the\r\ngeneral distribution of a leaven of scholars through all the families of\r\nthe Empire, and the completeness—almost incredible to a Westerner—of\r\ntraditional orthodoxy, permitted the interpreters of the tradition also to\r\nmould and transform it to a considerable degree. As a means of adjusting\r\nthe mores through the course of centuries, interpretation succeeded in\r\ngradually changing popular ideas, where open and revolutionary heterodoxy\r\nwould have failed.\r\n\r\nNow, in modern times, even though men might still remain largely under the\r\ncontrol of the ideology (learn to behave rightly instead of being\r\ngoverned), the ideology was necessarily weakened in two ways: by the\r\nappearance of men who were recalcitrant to the ideology, and by the\r\nemergence of conceptions and ideas which could not find a place in the\r\nideology, and which consequently opened up extra-ideological fields of\r\nindividual behavior. In other words, _li_ was no longer all-inclusive,\r\neither as to men or as to realms of thought. Its control had never, of\r\ncourse, been complete, for in that case all institutions of government\r\nwould have become superfluous in China and would have vanished; but its\r\ndeficiencies in past ages had never been so great; either with reference\r\nto insubordinate individuals or in regard to unassimilable ideas, as they\r\nwere in modern times.\r\n\r\nHence the province of government had to be greatly extended. The control\r\nof men by the ideology was incomplete wherever the foreign culture had\r\nreally struck the Chinese—as, for instance, in the case of the\r\nnewly-developed Chinese proletariat, which could not follow the Confucian\r\nprecepts in the slums of twentieth-century industry. The family system,\r\nthe village, and the guild were to the Chinese proletarians mere shadows\r\nof a past; they were faced individually with the problems of a foreign\r\nsocial life suddenly interjected into that of the Chinese. True instances\r\nof the interpenetration of opposites, they were Chinese from the still\r\nexisting old society of China suddenly transposed into an industrial world\r\nin which the old ideology was of little relevance. If they were to remain\r\nChinese they had to be brought again into the fold of the Chinese\r\nideology; and, meanwhile, instead of being controlled ideologically, they\r\nmust be controlled by the sharp, clear action of government possessing a\r\nmonopoly of the power of coercion. The proletarians were not, indeed, the\r\nonly group of Chinese over whom the old ideology had lost control. There\r\nwere the overseas Chinese, the new Chinese finance-capitalists, and others\r\nwho had adjusted their personal lives to the Western world. These had done\r\nso incompletely, and needed the action of government to shield them not\r\nonly from themselves and from one another, but from their precarious\r\nposition in their relations with the Westerners.\r\n\r\nOther groups had not completely fallen away from the ideology, but had\r\nfound major sections of it to be unsuitable to the regulation of their own\r\nlives. Virtue could not be found in a family system which was slowly\r\nlosing its polygynous character and also slowly giving place to a sort of\r\nsocial atomism; the intervention of the machine state was required to\r\nserve as a substitute for ideological regulation until such a time as the\r\nnew ideology should have developed sufficiently to restore relevance to\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nIndeed, throughout all China, there were few people who were not touched\r\nto a greater or less degree by the consequences of the collision of the\r\ntwo intellectual worlds, the nationalistic West and the old Chinese\r\nworld-society. However much Chinese might desire to continue in their\r\ntraditional modes of behavior, it was impossible for them to live happy\r\nand progressive lives by virtue of having memorized the classics and paid\r\nrespect to the precepts of tradition, as had their forefathers. In all\r\ncases where the old ideas failed, state and law suddenly acquired a new\r\nimportance—almost overwhelming to some Chinese—as the establishers of the\r\nnew order of life. Even etiquette was established by decree, in the days\r\nof the parliamentary Republic at Peking; the age-old assurance of Chinese\r\ndress and manners was suddenly swept away, and the government found itself\r\nforced to decree frock-coats.\r\n\r\nSuccessive governments in the new China had fallen, not because they did\r\ntoo much, but because they did too little. The sphere of state activity\r\nhad become enormous in contrast to what it had been under more than a\r\nscore of dynasties, and the state had perforce to intervene in almost\r\nevery walk of life, and every detail of behavior. Yet this intervention,\r\nalthough imperative, was met by the age-old Chinese contempt for\r\ngovernment, by the determined adherence to traditional methods of control\r\nin the face of situations to which now they were no longer relevant. It\r\nwas this paradox, the ever-broadening necessity of state activity in the\r\nface of traditional and unrealistic opposition to state activity, which\r\ncaused a great part of the turmoil in the new China. Officials made\r\nconcessions to the necessity for state action by drafting elaborate codes\r\non almost every subject, and then, turning about, also made concessions to\r\nthe traditional non-political habits of their countrymen by failing to\r\nenforce the codes which they had just promulgated. The leaders of the\r\nRepublic, and their followers in the provinces, found themselves with laws\r\nwhich could not possibly be introduced in a nation unaccustomed to law and\r\nespecially unaccustomed to law dealing with life in a Western way; thus\r\nbaffled, but perhaps not disappointed, the pseudo-republican government\r\nofficials were content with developing a shadow state, a shadow body of\r\nlaw, and then ignoring it except as a tool in the vast pandemonium of the\r\ntuchunates—where state and law were valued only in so far as they served\r\nto aggrandize or enrich military rulers and their hangers-on.\r\n\r\nThis tragic dilemma led Sun Yat-sen to call for a new kind of state, a\r\nstate which was to be democratic and yet to lead back to ideological\r\ncontrol. The emergency of imperialism and internal impotence made it\r\nimperative that the state limit its activities to those provinces of human\r\nbehavior in which it could actually effectuate its decrees, and that,\r\nafter having so limited the field of its action, it be well-nigh\r\nauthoritarian within that field. Yet throughout the whole scheme, Sun\r\nYat-sen’s deep faith in the common people required him to demand that the\r\nstate be democratic in principle and practice.\r\n\r\nIt may begin to be apparent that, at least for Sun Yat-sen, the control of\r\nthe race-nation by the ideology was not inconsistent with the political\r\ncontrol of the race-nation by itself. In the interval between the old\r\ncertainty and the new, political authority had to prevail. This authority\r\nwas to be directed by the people but actually wielded by the geniuses of\r\nthe revolution. The new ideology was to emerge from the progress of\r\nknowledge not, as before, among a special class of literary persons, but\r\nthrough all the people. It was to be an ideology based on practical\r\nexperience and on the experimental method, and consequently, perhaps, less\r\ncertain then the old Confucian ideology, which was in its foundations\r\nreligious. To fill in the gaps where uniformity of thought and behavior,\r\non the basis of truth, had not been established, the state was to act, and\r\nthe state had to be responsible to the people.\r\n\r\nAt this point it may be remembered that Sun Yat-sen was among the very few\r\nChinese leaders of his day who could give the historians of the future any\r\nvalid reasons for supposing that they believed in republican principles.\r\nToo many of the militarists and scholar-politicians of the North and South\r\npaid a half-contemptuous lip-service to the republic, primarily because\r\nthey could not agree as to which one of them should have the Dragon\r\nThrone, or, at the least, the honor of restoring the Manchu Emperor—who\r\nstayed on in the Forbidden City until 1924.(141) Sun Yat-sen had a deep\r\nfaith in the judgment and trustworthiness of the uncounted swarms of\r\ncoolies and farmers whom most Chinese leaders ignored. He was perhaps the\r\nonly man of his day really loved by the illiterate classes that knew of\r\nhim, and was always faithful to their love. Other leaders, both Chinese\r\nand Western, have praised the masses but refused to trust them for their\r\nown good. Sun’s implicit belief in the political abilities of the common\r\npeople in all matters which their knowledge equipped them to judge, was\r\nlittle short of ludicrous to many of his contemporaries, and positively\r\nirritating to some persons who wished him well personally but did not—at\r\nleast privately—follow all of his ideas.\r\n\r\nTo return to the consideration of the parts played by ideology and popular\r\ngovernment in social control: there was another point of great difference\r\nbetween the old ideology and the new. The old was the creation, largely,\r\nof a special class of scholars, who for that purpose ranked highest in the\r\nsocial hierarchy of old China. Now even though the three natural classes\r\nmight continue to be recognized in China, the higher standard of living\r\nand the increased literacy of the populace was to enlarge the number of\r\npersons participating in the life of ideas. The people were to form the\r\nideology in part, and in part control the government under whose control\r\nthe revolutionary geniuses were to form the rest of the ideology, and\r\npropagate it through a national educational program. In all respects the\r\neventual control was to rest with the people of the Chinese race-nation,\r\nunited, self-ruling, and determined to survive.\r\n\r\nHow, then, does the pattern of _min ch’üan_ fit into the larger scheme of\r\nthe continuation of Confucian civilization and ideological control? First,\r\nthe old was to continue undisturbed where it might. Second, those persons\r\ncompletely lost to the discipline of the old ideology must be controlled\r\nby the state. Third, those areas of behavior which were disturbed by the\r\nWestern impact required state guidance. Fourth, the machine state was to\r\ncontrol both these fields, of men, and of ideas, and within this limited\r\nfield was to be authoritarian (“an all-powerful state”) and yet democratic\r\n(“nevertheless subject to the control of the people”). Fifth, the ideology\r\nwas to arise in part from the general body of the people. Sixth, the other\r\nparts of it were to be developed by the intellectuals, assisted by the\r\ngovernment, which was to be also under the control of the people. Seventh,\r\nsince the world was generally in an unstable condition, and since many\r\nwrongs remained to be righted, it was not immediately probable that the\r\nChinese would settle down to ideological serenity and certainty, and\r\nconsequently State policy would still remain as a governmental question,\r\nto be decided by the will of the whole race-nation.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, then the people was to rule itself until the reappearance\r\nof perfect tranquility—_ta t’ung_—or its nearest mundane equivalent. The\r\ngovernment was to serve as a canalization of the power of the Chinese\r\nrace-nation in fighting against the oppressor-nations of the world for\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\nThe last principle of the nationalist ideology remains to be studied. _Min\r\ntsu_, nationalism, was to provide an instrumentality for self-control and\r\nfor external defense in a world of armed states. But these two would\r\nremain ineffectual in a starved and backward country, if they were not\r\nsupplemented by a third principle designed to relieve the physical\r\nimpotence of the nation, to promote the material happiness of its\r\nindividual members and to guarantee the continued survival of the Chinese\r\nsociety as a whole. Union and self-rule could be frustrated by starvation.\r\nChina needed not only to become united and free as a nation; it had also\r\nto become physically healthy and wealthy. This was to be effected through\r\n_min shêng_, the third of the three principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE THEORY OF _MIN SHÊNG_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Min Shêng_ in the Ideology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle of _min shêng_ has been the one most disputed. Sun Yat-sen\r\nmade his greatest break with the old ideology in promulgating this last\r\nelement in his triune doctrine; the original Chinese term carried little\r\nmeaning that could be used in an approach to the new meaning that Sun\r\nYat-sen gave it. He himself stated that the two words had become rather\r\nmeaningless in their old usage, and that he intended to use them with\r\nreference to special conditions in the modern world.(142) He then went on\r\nto state the principle in terms so broad, so seemingly contradictory, that\r\nat times it appears possible for each man to read in it what he will, as\r\nhe may in the Bible. The Communists and the Catholics each approve of the\r\nthird principle, but translate it differently; the liberals render it by a\r\nterm which is not only innocuous but colorless.(143) Had Sun Yat-sen lived\r\nto finish the lectures on _min shêng_, he might have succeeded in rounding\r\noff his discussion of the principle.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods by means of which the principle of _min shêng_ may\r\nbe examined. It might be described on the basis of the various definitions\r\nwhich Sun Yat-sen gave it in his four lectures and in other speeches and\r\npapers, and outlined, point by point, by means of the various functions\r\nand limits that he set for it. This would also permit some consideration\r\nof the relation of _min shêng_ to various other theories of political\r\neconomy. The other approach may be a less academic one, but perhaps not\r\naltogether unprofitable. By means of a reconsideration of the first two\r\nprinciples, and of the structure and meaning of the three principles as a\r\nwhole, it is possible to surmise, if not to establish, the meaning of _min\r\nshêng_, that is, to discover it through a sort of political triangulation:\r\nthe first two principles being given, to what third principle do they\r\nlead?\r\n\r\nThis latter method may be taken first, since it will afford a general view\r\nof the three principles which will permit the orientation of _min shêng_\r\nwith reference to the nationalist ideology as a whole, and prepare the\r\nstudent for a solution of some of the apparent contradictions which are to\r\nbe found in the various specific definitions of _min shêng_.\r\n\r\nAccepting the elementary thesis of the necessary awakening of the\r\nrace-nation, and its equally necessary self-rule, both as a nation\r\n_vis-à-vis_ other nations, and as a world by itself, one may see that\r\nthese are each social problems of organization which do not necessarily\r\ninvolve the physical conditions of the country, although, as a matter of\r\napplication, they would be ineffectual in a country which did not have the\r\nadequate means of self-support. Sun Yat-sen was interested in seeing the\r\nChinese people and Chinese civilization survive, and by survival he meant\r\nnot only the continuation of social organization and moral and\r\nintellectual excellence, but, more than these, the actual continued\r\nexistence of the great bulk of the population. The most vital problem was\r\nthat of the continued existence of the Chinese as a people, which was\r\nthreatened by the constant expansion of the West and might conceivably\r\nshare the fate of the American Indians—a remnant of a once great race\r\nliving on the charity of their conquerors. Sun Yat-sen expressly\r\nrecognized this problem as the supreme one, requiring immediate\r\nattention.(144) Nationalism and democracy would have no effect if the race\r\ndid not survive to practise them.\r\n\r\nThe old Chinese society may be conceived as a vast system of living men,\r\nwho survived by eating and breeding, and who were connected with one\r\nanother in time by the proper attention to the ancestral cults, and in\r\nspace by a common consciousness of themselves as the standard-bearers of\r\nthe civilization of the world. Sun Yat-sen, although a Christian, was not\r\nunmindful of this outlook; he too was sensible of the meaning of the\r\nliving race through the centuries. He dutifully informed the Emperor T’ai\r\nTsung of Ming that the Manchus had been driven from the throne, and some\r\nyears later he expressed the deepest reverence for the ancestral\r\ncult.(145) But in facing the emergency with which his race was confronted,\r\nSun Yat-sen could not overlook the practical question of physical\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\nHe was, therefore, materialistic in so far as his recognition of the\r\nimportance of the material well-being of the race-nation made him so. At\r\nthis point he may be found sympathetic with the Marxians, though his\r\nideology as a whole is profoundly Chinese. The destitution, the economic\r\nweakness, the slow progress of his native land were a torture to his\r\nconscience. In a world of the most grinding poverty, where war,\r\npestilence, and famine made even mere existence uncertain, he could not\r\npossibly overlook the problem of the adequate material care of the vast\r\npopulace that constituted the race-nation.\r\n\r\n_Min shêng_, accordingly, meant primarily the survival of the race-nation,\r\nas nationalism was its awakening, and democracy its self-control. No one\r\nof these could be effective without the two others. In the fundamentals of\r\nSun Yat-sen’s ideology, the necessity for survival and prosperity is\r\nsuperlative and self-evident. All other features of the doctrine are, as\r\nit were, optional. The first two principles definitely required a third\r\nthat would give them a body of persons upon which to operate; they did not\r\nnecessarily require that the third principle advance any specific\r\ndoctrine. If this be the case, it is evident that the question of the\r\ncontent of _min shêng_, while important, is secondary to the first\r\npremises of the _San Min Chu I_. The need for a third principle—one of\r\npopular subsistence—in the ideology is vital; the _San Min Chu I_ would be\r\ncrippled without it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Economic Background of _Min Shêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the nature of the background which decided Sun Yat-sen to draw an\r\neconomic program into the total of his nationalist ideology for the\r\nregeneration of China through a nationalist revolution? Was Sun Yat-sen\r\ndissatisfied with the economic order of the old society? Was he interested\r\nin a reconstitution of the economic system for the sake of defense against\r\nWestern powers?\r\n\r\nHe was unquestionably dissatisfied with the economic order of things in\r\nthe old society, but it was a dissatisfaction with what the old order had\r\nfailed to achieve rather than a feeling of the injustice of the Chinese\r\ndistributive system. He was bitter against a taxation system which worked\r\nout unevenly,(146) and against the extortions of the internal-transit\r\nrevenue officials under the Empire.(147) He was deeply impressed by his\r\nfirst encounter with Western mechanical achievement—the S. S. _Grannoch_,\r\nwhich took him from Kwangtung to Honolulu.(148) But he had served in the\r\nshop of his brother as a young boy,(149) and knew the small farm life of\r\nSouth China intimately. On the basis of this first-hand knowledge, and his\r\nmany years of association with the working people of China, he was not\r\nlikely to attack the old economic system for its injustice so much as for\r\nits inadequacy.(150)\r\n\r\nThat there were injustices in the old system of Chinese economy, no one\r\ncan deny, but these injustices were scarcely sufficient to provoke, of\r\nthemselves alone, the complete alteration of economic outlook that Sun\r\nYat-sen proposed. Chinese capitalism had not reached the state of\r\nindustrial capitalism until after its contact with the West; at the most\r\nit was a primitive sort of usury-capitalism practised by the three\r\neconomically dominant groups of old China—landholders, officials, and\r\nmerchant-usurers.(151) The disturbances which hurt the economic condition\r\nof the country, and thereby led to greater disturbances, had involved\r\nChina in a vicious cycle of decline which could scarcely be blamed on any\r\none feature or any one group in the old economy. The essential fault lay\r\nwith the condition of the country as a whole, directly affected by the\r\neconomic consequences of Western trade and partial industrialization.(152)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s positive dissatisfaction with the economy of his time arose\r\nfrom the position which he felt China had in the modern business world. He\r\nbelieved that, by virtue of the economic oppression of the Chinese by the\r\nWestern powers, China had been degraded to the position of the lowest\r\nnation on earth—that the Chinese were even more unfortunate than “slaves\r\nwithout a country,” such as the Koreans and the Annamites.(153) The\r\nparticular forms of this oppression, and Sun Yat-sen’s plans for meeting\r\nit, may be more aptly described in the consideration of his program of\r\neconomic national regeneration.(154) The Chinese nation occupied the\r\nignominious position of a sub-colony or—as Sun himself termed it—“a\r\nhypo-colony”; “Our people are realizing that to be a semi-colony is a\r\nnational disgrace; but our case is worse than that; our country is in the\r\nposition of a sub-colony (since it is the colony of all the Great Powers\r\nand not merely subject to one of them), a position which is inferior to an\r\nordinary colony such as Korea and Annam.”(155)\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were the positive implications of the principle of _min shêng_\r\nin the nationalist ideology?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Meanings of _Min Shêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, _min shêng_ is the doctrine leading the nationalist democracy on\r\nits road to a high position among the nations of the earth; only through\r\nthe material strength to be found in _min shêng_ can the Chinese attain a\r\nposition by which they can exert the full force of their new-formed state\r\nagainst the invaders and oppressors, and be able to lift up the populace\r\nso that democracy will possess some actual operative meaning. _Min shêng_\r\nis “... the center of politics, of economics, of all kinds of historical\r\nmovements; it is similar to the center of gravity in space.”(156) It\r\nprovides the implementation of nationalism and democracy.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _min shêng_ means national enrichment. The problem of China is\r\nprimarily one of poverty. Sun wanted consideration of the problem of the\r\nlivelihood of the people to begin with the supreme economic reality in\r\nChina. What was this reality? “It is the poverty from which we all suffer.\r\nThe Chinese in general are poor; among them there is no privileged wealthy\r\nclass, but only a generality of ordinary poor people.”(157) However this\r\nenrichment was to be brought about, it was imperative.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _min shêng_, as the doctrine of enrichment, was also the doctrine\r\nof economic justice. If the nation was to become economically healthy, it\r\ncould only do so on the basis of the proper distribution of property among\r\nits citizens. Its wealth would not bring about well-being unless it were\r\nproperly distributed.\r\n\r\nMore briefly, _min shêng_ may be said to be the thesis of the\r\nindispensability of: 1) a national economic revolution against imperialism\r\nand for democracy; 2) an industrial revolution for the enrichment of\r\nChina; and 3) a prophylactic against social revolution.\r\n\r\nThe significance of _min shêng_ as the economic implementation of\r\nnationalism and democracy is clear enough to require no further\r\ndiscussion. Its significance as a doctrine for the promotion of the\r\nindustrial revolution is considerable, and worth attention.\r\n\r\nWestern science was to sow the seed. _Min shêng_ economy was to reap the\r\nharvest. By means of the details in Sun Yat-sen’s programs which he\r\nbelieved sufficient for the purposes, the modernization of China, which\r\nwas to be a consequence of Western science in the ideology, was to lead at\r\nthe same time to the actual physical enrichment of the economic goods and\r\nservices of the country. The advocacy of industrial development is, of\r\ncourse, a commonplace in the Western world, but in China it was strikingly\r\nnovel. Sun Yat-sen did not regard industrialism as a necessary evil; he\r\nconsidered it a positive blessing, as the means of increasing the material\r\nwelfare of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nTime and time again, Sun Yat-sen emphasized the necessity of\r\nmodernization. His theory of nationalism led him to urge the introduction\r\nof Western physical science into the ideology. His theory of democracy was\r\njustified in part by the fact that democracy was to be regarded as a\r\nmodernizing force. Now his principle of _min shêng_ was also to lead to\r\nthat great end—the modernization of China to a degree to permit the\r\nrace-nation to regain in the modern world, which encompassed the whole\r\nplanet, the position it had once had in the smaller world of Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of old China had been one of the factors enabling it to resist\r\ndestruction at the spear-points of its barbarian conquerors. Sun Yat-sen\r\nknew this, and knew also that the position of the United States—which had\r\nprobably the greatest concentration of social and physical wealth and\r\npower under one political system that the world had ever known—made that\r\nnation impregnable in the modern world. Seeing that wealth was not only a\r\nblessing to individuals, but to nations as well, he was anxious that his\r\nbeloved China should be guarded and assisted by the strength that the\r\nideology of _min shêng_, once accepted and effectuated, could give it.\r\n\r\n_Min shêng_ is more than a vague aspiration for national welfare. The\r\ngeneral theory of nationalism and democracy required an additional point\r\nto make them effective in the realities of international politics, and\r\n_min shêng_ was to supply the hygienic and economic strength that the\r\nChinese race-nation needed for competition and survival; but it was to do\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n_Min shêng_ is at the same time the last step of Chinese resistance and\r\nthe first of Chinese submission to Western culture. In seeking an economic\r\npolicy and an ideology which would lead to increased wealth of the nation,\r\nthe Chinese were preparing to resist the West with its own weapons. _Min\r\nshêng_ is a submission in that it is a deliberate declaration of\r\nindustrial revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is beside the point to consider the ideological bases of the Western\r\nindustrial revolution. It was perhaps neither a voluntary nor a deliberate\r\nprocess at all; no man in the first few decades of the nineteenth century\r\ncould have foretold what the end of a process of mechanization would\r\nbring, or was likely to advocate the intentional following of a policy\r\nwhich would transform the orientation and organization of man more\r\nthoroughly than had any previous religious, political, and economic\r\ntransition. The industrial revolution of Euramerica, when viewed from the\r\noutside, presents the appearance of a colossal accident, whether for good\r\nor for bad, which was but half-perceived by the participants in it. Even\r\ntoday, when the ideology and the institutional outline of the\r\nagrarian-handicraft past is fading swiftly away in the new brilliance of\r\nWestern machine-culture, the new certainty, the new order have not yet\r\nappeared. The great transition works its way beyond the knowledge or the\r\nintervention of individual men.\r\n\r\nThis was decidedly not the case in China. Industrialism was something\r\nwhich could be studied from the outside, which could be appraised, and\r\nthen acclaimed or resisted. Emperor Meiji and his Genro, with a flash of\r\nintuition or an intellectual penetration almost unparalleled in the\r\npolitical history of the world, guided Japan into the swift current of\r\nmechanical progress; the island empire swept ahead of Asia, abreast of the\r\nmost powerful states of the world. The Chinese court, under the resolute,\r\nbut blind, guidance of the Empress Dowager, made a few feeble gestures in\r\nfavor of modernization, but vigorously opposed any change which might\r\nseriously modify the order of Chinese society or the position of the\r\nManchus. In the shadow of the foreign guns, industrialism crept into\r\nChina, along the coasts and up the banks of the navigable rivers. One\r\nmight suppose that the Chinese were in a position to choose, deliberately,\r\nfor or against industrialism. They were not; in China, as in the West, the\r\nmachine age first appeared largely as an accident.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the significance of Sun Yat-sen’s _min shêng_ becomes\r\napparent. Above all other subsidiary meanings, it is a deliberate\r\ndeclaration of the industrial revolution. Modernism had been an accident;\r\nSun Yat-sen wished to transform it into a program. What would be the\r\nideological consequences of such an attitude?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a plan was indicated for almost every type of human\r\nbehavior. Sun Yat-sen himself drafted a preliminary scheme for a modern\r\nmanufacturing and communications system.(158) The road that China was to\r\ntake would not be the miserable, halting progress of industrialism,\r\ncomplicated by delays and wars, which the West had known in the painful\r\ncenturies of readjustment from the medieval to modern civilization; China\r\nwould not stumble forward, but would deliberately select the swiftest and\r\neasiest way to a sound industrialism, and then take it.\r\n\r\n_Min shêng_ thus not only provides the Chinese with a way to make their\r\nnationalism, their democracy, and their stateification felt in the hour of\r\ntheir ultimate triumph; it gives them something to do to bring about that\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the outlines of the ideology and the social system that\r\nSun Yat-sen proposed, viewed from the perspective of the old Confucian\r\nworld-society, the reader will realize that this declaration of the\r\nindustrial revolution is the boldest of Sun Yat-sen’s acts, and that the\r\nmeaning of _min shêng_ as a program of complete modernization and\r\nreconstruction is superior to other possible meanings it may have, in\r\nregard to theoretical national or social revolution. There is nothing\r\nremote or philosophical about the significance of _min shêng_ when so\r\nviewed; it is a plan to which a Lenin or a Henry Ford might subscribe with\r\nequal fervor—although a Tagore would deplore it. It is here that Sun\r\nYat-sen appears as the champion of the West against the traditional\r\ntechnological stagnation of China. Yet just there, at the supreme point of\r\nhis Westernism, we must remember what he was fighting for: the life of a\r\nrace-nation and a civilization that was contradictory to the West. The\r\nstability of Confucianism could not serve as a cloak for reaction and\r\nstagnant thought. For its own good, nay, its own life, Chinese\r\ncivilization had to modernize (i. e., Westernize economically) in order to\r\ncompete in a West-ruled world. But what, more specifically, was the\r\nsocio-economic position of Sun Yat-sen? Was he a Marxian? Was he a\r\nliberal? Was he neither?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Influences: Henry George, Marxism and Maurice William.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously stated there are three parts which may be distinguished in\r\nthe ideology of the principle of _min shêng_. _Min shêng_ is, first, the\r\neconomic aspect of the national revolution—the creation of an active\r\nrace-nation of China implementing its power by, second, technological\r\nrevolution. Third, it connotes also the necessity of a social revolution\r\nof some kind. Western commentators have been prone to ignore the\r\nsignificance of _min shêng_ in the first two of these meanings, and have\r\nconcentrated on disputation concerning the third part. The question of the\r\nright system of distribution has become so prominent in much Western\r\nrevolutionary thought that, to many, it sums up the whole moral issue\r\nconcerning what is good and bad in society.(159) They are uninterested in\r\nor ignorant of the great importance that the first two aspects of _min\r\nshêng_ possess for the Chinese mind. The third part, the application of\r\n_min shêng_ to the problems that are in the West the cause of social\r\nrevolution, and to the possible application of social revolution to China,\r\nis important, but is by no means the complete picture.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to state the definitive position of Sun Yat-sen on this\r\nquestion several points must be kept in mind. The first is that Sun\r\nYat-sen, born a Chinese of the nineteenth century, had the intellectual\r\norientation of a member of the world-society, and an accepter of the\r\nConfucian ideology. Enough has been shown of the background of his\r\ntheories to demonstrate their harmony with and relevance to society which\r\nhad endured in China for centuries before the coming of the West. The\r\nsecond point to be remembered is that Westerners are prone to overlook\r\nthis background and see only the Western influences which they are in such\r\na good position to detect. Sun Yat-sen’s mind grew and changed. His\r\npreferences in Western beliefs changed frequently. A few Westerners,\r\nseeing only this, are apt to call Sun unstable and devoid of reason.(160)\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, be strange to find any Western political or ideological\r\nleader who thought in precisely the same terms after the world war and the\r\nRussian revolution as before. Sun Yat-sen was, like many other\r\nreceptive-minded leaders, sensitive to the new doctrines of Wilson and\r\nLenin as they were shouted through the world. He was, perhaps, less\r\naffected by them than Western leaders, because his ideology was so largely\r\nrooted in the ideology of old China.\r\n\r\nApart from the winds of doctrine that blew through the world during Sun’s\r\nlife-period, and the generally known Western influences to which he was\r\nexposed,(161) there were three writers whose influence has been supposed\r\nto have been critical in the development of his thinking. These three were\r\nHenry George, Karl Marx, and Maurice William of New York. A much greater\r\namount of material is needed for a detailed study of the influences of\r\nvarious individual theories on Sun Yat-sen than for a general exposition\r\nof his political doctrines as a whole. At the present time scarcely enough\r\nhas been written to permit any really authoritative description of the\r\nrelations between the ideology of Sun Yat-sen and the thought of these\r\nthree men. It is possible, nevertheless, to trace certain general outlines\r\nwhich may serve to clarify the possible influence that was exercised on\r\nSun, and to correct some current misapprehensions as to the nature and\r\nextent of that influence.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s opposition to the “unearned increment” shows the influence\r\nof the thought of Henry George. Sun proposed an ingenious scheme for the\r\ngovernment confiscation of unearned increment in an economy which would\r\nnevertheless permit private ownership of land. (Incidentally, he terms\r\nthis, in his second lecture on _min shêng_, “communism,” which indicates a\r\nuse of the word different, in this respect at least, from the conventional\r\nWestern use.)(162) The land problem was of course a very old one in China,\r\nalthough accentuated in the disorders resulting from the impact of the\r\nWest. There can be little question that Sun’s particular method of solving\r\nthe problem was influenced by the idea of unearned increment.\r\n\r\nHe knew of Henry George in 1897, the year the latter died,(163) and\r\nadvocated redistribution of the land in the party oath, the platform, and\r\nthe slogans of the _Tung Meng Hui_ of 1905.(164) Since, even at the time\r\nof the Canton-Moscow Entente, his land policy never approached the\r\nMarxist-Leninist program of nationalization or collectivization of land,\r\nbut remained one of redistribution and confiscation of unearned increment,\r\nit is safe to say that Sun kept the theory of George in mind, although he\r\nby no means followed George to the latter’s ultimate conclusions.(165) It\r\nmay thus be inferred that the influence of Henry George upon the\r\nnationalist ideology of Sun Yat-sen was slight, but permanent. An idea was\r\nborrowed; the scheme of things was not.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen encountered Marxism for the first recorded time in London in\r\n1897, when he met a group of Russian revolutionaries and also read in the\r\nsubject. The fact that Sun was exposed to Marxism proves little except\r\nthat he had had the opportunity of taking up Marxism and did not do\r\nso.(166) Again, the _Tung Meng Hui_ manifesto of 1905 may have been\r\ninfluenced by Marxism. It was not, however, until the development of his\r\n_Three Principles_ that the question of Marxian influence was raised. Sun\r\nYat-sen made his first speech on the _Principles_ in Brussels in the\r\nspring of 1905.(167) By 1907 the three principles had taken on a clear\r\nform: nationalism, democracy, and _min shêng_, which the Chinese of that\r\ntime seem to have translated _socialism_ when referring to it in Western\r\nlanguages.(168)\r\n\r\nThe most careful Marxian critic of Sun Yat-sen, writing of the principle\r\nof _min shêng_ and its two main planks, land reform and state capitalism,\r\nsays: “This very vague program, which does not refer to class interests\r\nnor to the class struggle as the means of breaking privileged class\r\ninterests, was objectively not socialism at all, but something else\r\naltogether: Lenin coined the formula, ‘subjective socialism,’ for\r\nit.”(169) He adds, later: “Hence Sun’s socialism meant, on the lips of the\r\nChinese bourgeoisie, nothing but a sort of declaration for a ‘social’\r\neconomic policy, that is, a policy friendly to the masses.”(170) T’ang\r\nLiang-li declares that the third principle at this time adopted “a frankly\r\nsocialistic attitude,”(171) but implies elsewhere that its inadequacy was\r\nseen by a Chinese Marxist, Chu Chih-hsin.(172) This evidence, as far as it\r\ngoes, shows that Sun Yat-sen had had the opportunity to become acquainted\r\nwith Marxism, and that even on the occasion of the first formulation of\r\nthe principle of _min shêng_ he used none of its tenets. The revolutionary\r\ncritic, T’ang Liang-li, who, a devoted and brilliant Nationalist in\r\naction, writes with a sort of European left-liberal orientation, suggests\r\nthat the Third Principle grew with the growth of capitalist industrialism\r\nin China.(173) This is true: economic maladjustment would emphasize the\r\nneed for ideological reconstruction with reference to the economy. There\r\nis no need to resort to Marxian analysis.\r\n\r\nThat the third principle meant something to Sun Yat-sen is shown by the\r\nfact that when Sung Chiao-jen, who a few years later was to become one of\r\nthe most celebrated martyrs of the revolution, suggested in the period of\r\nthe first provisional Republic at Nanking that the Third Principle had\r\nbetter be omitted altogether, Sun was enraged, and declared that if _min\r\nshêng_ were to be given up, the whole revolution might as well be\r\nabandoned.(174)\r\n\r\nSince _min shêng_, in its third significance, that of the development of a\r\nsocially just distributive system, was not Marxian nor yet unimportant, it\r\nmay be contrasted once again with the communist doctrines, and then\r\nstudied for its actual content. In contrasting it with Marxism, it might\r\nbe of value to observe, first, the criticism that the Marxians levy\r\nagainst it, and second, the distinctions that nationalist and European\r\ncritics make between _min shêng_ and communism.\r\n\r\nDr. Karl Wittfogel, the German Marxist whose work on Sun Yat-sen is the\r\nmost satisfactory of its kind, points out the apparent contradictions in\r\nthe _San Min Chu I_: on the one hand, statements which are not only\r\nobjectively but subjectively friendly to capitalism (on the excellence of\r\nthe Ford plant; on the necessity for the coöperation of capital and\r\nlabor)—on the other, the unmerciful condemnation of capitalism; on the one\r\nhand, the declaration that there is no capitalism in China—on the other,\r\nthat capitalism must be destroyed as it appears; on the right, the\r\nstatement that communism and _min shêng_ are opposed—on the left, that the\r\ncommunist doctrines are a subsidiary part of the ideology of _min\r\nshêng_.(175) How, asks Wittfogel, does this all fit together? He answers\r\nby pointing out the significance of Sun’s theses when considered in\r\nrelation to the dialectical-materialist interpretation of recent Far\r\nEastern history:\r\n\r\n\r\n    His three principles incorporate\r\n\r\n    in their _development_ the objective change in the socio-economic\r\n                situation of China,\r\n    in their _contradictions_ the real contradictions of the Chinese\r\n                revolution,\r\n    in their _latest tendencies_ the transposition of the social\r\n                center of gravity of the revolution, which sets the\r\n                classes in action, and whose aim is no longer a\r\n                bourgeois capitalist one, but proletarian-socialist\r\n                and peasant agrarian-revolutionary.\r\n\r\n    Sun Yat-sen is according to this not only the hitherto most\r\n    powerful representative of the bourgeois-national,\r\n    anti-imperialist revolutions of awakening Asia; he points at the\r\n    same time outwards over the bourgeois class limitations of the\r\n    first step of the Asiatic movement for liberation. To deny this\r\n    were portentuous, even for the proletarian communist movement of\r\n    Eastern Asia.(176)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modifications which the Marxians have introduced into their programs\r\nwith respect to the class struggle in colonial countries do not imply a\r\ncorresponding modification of their ideology. The determinism adopted from\r\nHegel, the economic interpretation of history—these and other dogmas are\r\nheld by the Marxians to be universally valid despite their Western origin.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what Sun’s chief Marxian exegete thinks of him. Now it may be\r\nworth while to consider the actual relations of Sun’s doctrines with some\r\nof those in Marxism. In the first place, Sun Yat-sen, during his stay in\r\nShanghai, 1919-1922 (with interruptions), was very much interested in\r\nCommunism and friendly to the Russian people, but not at all inclined to\r\nadopt its ideology.(177)\r\n\r\nIn reference to specific points of the Communist ideology, Sun Yat-sen was\r\nindebted to the Communists for the application of the principle of\r\nnationalism, as a means of propaganda, as anti-imperialism, although, as\r\nwe have seen, it was fundamentally a thesis for the readjustment of the\r\nChinese society from the ideological basis of a world-society over to a\r\nnational state among national states.(178) Second, his habit of taking\r\nWestern doctrines and applying them to the Chinese nation instead of to\r\nChinese individuals, led him to apply nationalism to the class war of the\r\noppressed nations against the oppressing nations. There was no\r\njustification of intra-national class war in the nationalist ideology of\r\nSun Yat-sen.(179) In his doctrine of democracy, his application of a\r\nclass-system based on intellect was a flat denial of the superior\r\nsignificance of the Marxian economic-class ideology, as was his favoring\r\nof the development of a five-power liberal government through _ch’üan_ and\r\n_nêng_ in place of a dictatorship of the proletariat operating through\r\nsoviets. Finally, in relation to _min shêng_, his use of the Confucian\r\nphilosophy—the interpretation of history through _jên_—was a contradiction\r\nof the materialist interpretation of history by the Marxians. It also\r\ncontradicted the class struggle; the loyalty of the Chinese to the\r\nrace-nation was to be the supreme loyalty; it was to develop from the _ta\r\nchia_, the great family of all Chinese; and class lines within it could\r\nnot transcend its significance. Furthermore, purely as a matter of\r\neconomic development, Sun Yat-sen regarded the class struggle as\r\n_pathological_ in society. He said, “Out of his studies of the social\r\nquestion, Marx gained no other advantage than a knowledge of the diseases\r\nof social evolution; he failed to see the principle of social evolution.\r\nHence we can say that Marx was a pathologist rather than a physiologist of\r\nsociety.”(180) Finally, he did not accept the Marxian theory of surplus\r\nvalue or of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. He even spoke of\r\ncapitalism and socialism as “two economic forces of human civilization”\r\nwhich might “work side by side in future civilization.”(181)\r\n\r\nAll in all, it may safely be said that Sun Yat-sen’s ideology, as an\r\nadjustment of the old Chinese ideology to the modern world, was not\r\ninspired by the Marxist; that through the greater part of his life, he was\r\nacquainted with Marxism, and did not avail himself of the opportunities he\r\nhad for adopting it, but consistently rejected it; and that while the\r\nCommunists were of great use to him in the formulation and implementation\r\nof his program, they affected his ideology, either generally or with\r\nreference to _min shêng_, imperceptibly if at all.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is of significance in the estimation of the influence of\r\nMaurice William upon the thought of Sun Yat-sen. It is, briefly, the\r\nthesis of Dr. William that it was his own book which saved China from\r\nBolshevism by making an anti-Marxian out of Sun after he had fallen prey\r\nto the Bolshevist philosophy. Dr. William writes of the lectures on\r\nNationalism and Democracy; “In these lectures Dr. Sun makes clear that his\r\nposition is strongly pro-Russian and pro-Marxian, that he endorses the\r\nclass struggle, repudiates Western democracy, and advocates China’s\r\ncoöperation with Bolshevist Russia against capitalist nations.”(182) Dr.\r\nWilliam then goes on to show, quite convincingly, that Sun Yat-sen, with\r\nvery slight acknowledgments, quoted William’s _The Social Interpretation\r\nof History_ almost verbatim for paragraph after paragraph in the lectures\r\non _min shêng_.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust and untruthful to deny the great value that William’s\r\nbook had for Sun Yat-sen, who did quote it and use its arguments.(183) On\r\nthe other hand, it is a manifest absurdity to assume that Sun Yat-sen,\r\nhaving once been a communist, suddenly reversed his position after reading\r\none book by an American of whom he knew nothing. Even Dr. William writes\r\nwith a tone of mild surprise when he speaks of the terrific _volte-face_\r\nwhich he thinks Sun Yat-sen performed.\r\n\r\nThere are two necessary comments to be made on the question of the\r\ninfluence of Maurice William. In the first place, Sun Yat-sen had never\r\nswerved from the interpretation of history by _jên_, which may be\r\ninterpreted as the humane or social interpretation of history. Enough of\r\nthe old Chinese ideology has been outlined above to make clear what this\r\noutlook was.(184) Sun Yat-sen, in short, never having been a Marxian, was\r\nnot converted to the social interpretation of history as put forth by Dr.\r\nWilliam. He found in the latter’s book, perhaps more clearly than in any\r\nother Western work an analysis of society that coincided with his own,\r\nwhich he had developed from the old Chinese philosophy and morality as\r\nrendered by Confucius. Consequently he said of William’s rejection of the\r\nmaterialistic interpretation of history, “That sounds perfectly reasonable\r\n... the greatest discovery of the American scholar _fits in perfectly_\r\nwith the (third) principle of our Party.”(185) The accomplishment of\r\nMaurice William, therefore, was a great one, but one which has been\r\nmisunderstood. He formulated a doctrine of social evolution which tallied\r\nperfectly with Chinese ideology, and did this without being informed on\r\nChinese thought. He did not change the main currents of Sun’s thought,\r\nwhich were consistent through the years. He did present Sun with several\r\ntelling supplementary arguments in Western economic terms, by means of\r\nwhich he could reconcile his interpretation of social history not only\r\nwith Confucian _jên_ but also with modern Western economics.\r\n\r\nThe other point to be considered in relation to Maurice William is a\r\nmatter of dates. The thesis of Maurice William, that Sun Yat-sen, after\r\nhaving turned Marxian or near-Marxian, was returned to democratic liberal\r\nthought by William’s book, is based on contrast of the first twelve\r\nlectures in the _San Min Chu I_ and the last four on _min shêng_. Dr.\r\nWilliam believes that Sun read his book in the meantime and changed his\r\nmind. A Chinese commentator points out that Sun Yat-sen referred to _The\r\nSocial Interpretation of History_ in a speech on January 21, 1924; his\r\nfirst lecture on the _San Min Chu I_ was given January 24, 1924.(186)\r\nHence, in the twelve lectures that Dr. William interprets as Marxian, Sun\r\nYat-sen was speaking from a background which included not only Marxism,\r\nbut _The Social Interpretation of History_, as well.\r\n\r\nOnly on the third part does the influence of the Western thinkers appear\r\nunmistakably. Henry George gave Sun Yat-sen the idea of the unearned\r\nincrement, but Sun Yat-sen, instead of accepting the whole body of\r\ndoctrine that George put forth, simply kept this one idea, and built a\r\nnovel land-policy of his own on it. Marxism may have influenced the verbal\r\ntone of Sun Yat-sen’s lectures, but it did not affect his ideology,\r\nalthough it shows a definite imprint upon his programs. Maurice William\r\ngave Sun Yat-sen a set of arguments in modern economic terms which he\r\nattached to his ideological thesis of the _jên_ interpretation of history,\r\nwhich he based upon Confucianism. There is no evidence to show that at any\r\ntime in his life Sun Yat-sen abandoned his Chinese ideological orientation\r\nand fell under the sway of any Western thinker. The strong consistency in\r\nthe ideology of Sun Yat-sen is a consistency rooted in the old Chinese\r\nideology. On minor points of doctrine he showed the influence of the West;\r\nthis influence cannot be considered solely by itself. The present\r\ndiscussion of Western influences may, by its length, imply a\r\ndisproportionate emphasis of Western thought in the political doctrines of\r\nSun Yat-sen, but in a work written primarily for Westerners, this may be\r\nfound excusable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Min Shêng_ as a Socio-Economic Doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one were to attempt to define the relations of the _min shêng_ ideology\r\nto the various types of Western economic doctrines at present current,\r\ncertain misapprehensions may be eliminated at the outset. First:\r\nCapitalism in its Western form was opposed by Sun Yat-sen; _min shêng_ was\r\nto put through the national economic revolution of enrichment through a\r\ndeliberately-planned industrialization, but in doing so was to prevent\r\nChina from going through all the painful stages which attended the growth\r\nof capitalism in the West. “We want,” said Sun Yat-sen, “a preventive\r\nremedy; a remedy which will thwart the accumulation of large private\r\ncapitals and so preserve future society from the great inconvenience of\r\nthe inequality between rich and poor.”(187) And yet he looked forward to a\r\nsociety which would ultimately be communistic, although never in its\r\nstrict Marxian sense. “We may say that communism is the ideal of\r\nlivelihood, and that the doctrine of livelihood is the practical\r\napplication of communism; such is the difference between the doctrine of\r\nMarx and the doctrine of the Kuomintang. In the last analysis, there is no\r\nreal difference in the principles of the two; where they differ is in\r\nmethod.”(188) This is sufficient to show that Sun Yat-sen was not an\r\northodox Western apologist for capitalism; as a Chinese, it would have\r\nbeen hard for him to be one, for the logically consistent capitalist\r\nideology is one which minimizes all human relationships excepting those\r\nindividual-contractual ones based on money bargains. The marketing of\r\ngoods and services in such a way as to disturb the traditional forms of\r\nChinese society would have been repugnant to Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nSecond: if Sun Yat-sen’s _min shêng_ ideology cannot be associated with\r\ncapitalism, it can as little be affiliated with Marxism or the single-tax.\r\nWhat, then, in relation to Western socio-economic thought, is it? We have\r\nseen that the state it proposed was liberal-protective, and that the\r\nsociety from which it was derived and to which it was to lead back was one\r\nof extreme laissez-faire, bordering almost on anarchism. These political\r\nfeatures are enough to distinguish it from the Western varieties of\r\nsocialism, anarchism and syndicalism, since the ingredients of these\r\nideologies of the West and that of Sun Yat-sen, while coincident on some\r\npoints, cannot be fitted together.\r\n\r\nSuperficially, there is a certain resemblance between the ideology of the\r\n_San Min Chu I_ and that of Fascism. The resemblances may be found in the\r\nemphasis on the nation, the rejection of the class war and of Marxism, the\r\nupholding of tradition, and the inclusion of a doctrine of intellectual\r\ninequality. But Sun Yat-sen seeks to reconcile all this with democracy in\r\na form even more republican than that of the United States. The scheme of\r\n_min ch’üan_, with its election, recall, initiative and referendum, and\r\nwith its definite demands of intellectual freedom, is in contradiction to\r\nthe teachings of Fascism. His condemnation of Caesarism is unequivocal:\r\n“Therefore, if the Chinese Revolution has not until now been crowned with\r\nsuccess, it is because the ambitions for the throne have not been\r\ncompletely rooted out nor suppressed altogether.”(189) With these\r\nfundamental and irreconcilable distinctions, it is hard to find any\r\npossibility of agreement between the _San Min Chu I_ and the Fascist\r\nideologies, although the transitional program of the _San Min Chu I_—in\r\nits advocacy of provisional party dictatorship, etc.—has something in\r\ncommon with Fascism as well as with Communism as applied in the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nA recent well-received work on modern political thought describes a\r\ncategory of Western thinkers whose ideas are much in accord with those\r\ncontained in the _min shêng_ ideology.(190) Professor Francis W. Coker of\r\nYale, after reviewing the leading types of socialist and liberal thought,\r\ndescribes a group who might be called “empirical collectivists.” The men\r\nto whom he applies this term reject socialist doctrines of economic\r\ndeterminism, labor-created value, and class war. They oppose, on the other\r\nhand, the making of a fetish of private ownership, and recognize that the\r\nvast mass of ordinary men in modern society do not always receive their\r\njust share of the produce of industry. They offer no single panacea for\r\nall economic troubles, and lay down no absolute and unchallengeable dogma\r\nconcerning the rightness or wrongness of public or private ownership.(191)\r\nProfessor Coker outlines their general point of view by examining their\r\nideas with reference to several conspicuous economic problems of the\r\npresent day: public ownership; labor legislation; regulation of prices;\r\ntaxation; and land policies.(192)\r\n\r\nAccording to Coker, the empirical collectivist is not willing to forgo the\r\nprofit motive except where necessary. He is anxious to see a great part of\r\nthe ruthlessness of private competition eliminated, and capital generally\r\nsubjected to a regulation which will prevent its use as an instrument of\r\nharm to the community as a whole. While not committed to public ownership\r\nof large enterprises as a matter of theory, he has little objection to the\r\ngovernmental operation of those which could, as a matter of practical\r\nexpediency, be managed by the state on a nonprofit basis.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s position greatly resembles this, with respect to his more\r\nimmediate objectives. Speaking of public utilities, he said to Judge\r\nLinebarger: “There are so many public utilities needed in China at the\r\npresent time, that the government can’t monopolize all of them for the\r\nadvantage of the masses. Moreover, public utilities involve risks which a\r\ngovernment cannot afford to take. Although the risks are comparatively\r\nsmall in single cases, the entire aggregate of such risks, if assumed by\r\nthe government, would be of crushing proportions. Private initiative and\r\ncapital can best perform the public utility development of China. We\r\nshould, however, be very careful to limit the control of these public\r\nutilities enterprises, while at the same time encouraging private\r\ndevelopment as much as possible.”(193) Sun had, however, already spoken of\r\nnationalization: “I think that when I hold power again, we should\r\ninstitute a nationalization program through a cautious and experimental\r\nevolution of (1) public utilities; (2) public domains; (3) industrial\r\ncombines, syndicates, and cartels; (4) coöperative department stores and\r\nother merchandising agencies.”(194) It must be remembered that there were\r\ntwo considerations back of anything that Sun Yat-sen said concerning\r\nnational ownership: first, China had already ventured into broad national\r\nownership of communications and transport, even though these were in bad\r\ncondition and heavily indebted; second, there was no question of\r\nexpropriation of capital, but rather the free alternative of public and\r\nprivate industry. An incidental problem that arises in connection with the\r\njoint development of the country by public and by private capital is the\r\nuse of foreign capital. Sun Yat-sen was opposed to imperialism, but he did\r\nnot believe that the use of foreign capital at fair rates of interest\r\nconstituted submission to imperialism. He said, in Canton, “ ... we shall\r\ncertainly have to borrow foreign capital in order to develop means of\r\ncommunication and transportation, and we cannot do otherwise than have\r\nrecourse to those foreigners who are men of knowledge and of experience to\r\nmanage these industries.”(195) It may thus be said that Sun Yat-sen had no\r\nfixed prejudice against private capital or against foreign capital, when\r\nproperly and justly regulated, although in general he favored the\r\nownership of large enterprises by the state.\r\n\r\nSecond—to follow again Professor Coker—the Western empirical collectivists\r\nfavor labor legislation, and government intervention for the protection of\r\nthe living standards of the working classes. This, while it did not figure\r\nconspicuously in the theories of Sun Yat-sen,(196) was a striking feature\r\nof all his practical programs.(197) In his address to Chinese labor, on\r\nthe international Labor Day, 1924, he urged that Chinese labor organize in\r\norder to fight for its own cause and that of national liberation. It had\r\nnothing to fear from Chinese capitalism, but everything from foreign\r\nimperialistic capitalism.(198) Sun did not make a special hero class out\r\nof the workers; he did, however, advocate their organization for the\r\npurpose of getting their just share of the national wealth, and for\r\nresistance to the West and Japan.\r\n\r\nThird, the empirical collectivist tends to advocate price-control by the\r\nstate, if not over the whole range of commodities, at least in certain\r\ndesignated fields. Sun was, has been stated, in favor of the regulation of\r\ncapital at all points, and of public ownership in some. This naturally\r\nimplies an approval of price-control. He more specifically objected to\r\nundue profits by middlemen, when, in discussing salesmen, he said: “Under\r\nideal conditions, society does not need salesmen or any inducement to buy.\r\nIf a thing is good, and the price reasonable, it should sell itself on its\r\nown merits without any salesmanship. This vast army of middlemen should\r\nhence be made to remember that they should expect no more from the\r\nnonproductive calling in which they are engaged than any other citizen\r\nobtains through harder labor.”(199) In this, too, _min shêng_ coincides\r\nwith empirical collectivism; the coincidence is made easy by the relative\r\nvagueness of the latter.\r\n\r\nFourth, in the words of Mr. Coker, “many collectivists look upon taxation\r\nas a rational and practical means for reducing extreme differences in\r\nwealth and for achieving other desired economic changes.”(200) Sun Yat-sen\r\nagrees with this definitely; his land policy is one based upon taxation\r\nand confiscation of the amount of the unearned increment (which, not\r\ninvolving the confiscation of the land itself, is perhaps also taxation),\r\nand proposes to apply taxes extensively. Quite apart from the question of\r\ndistributive justice, a heavy tax burden would be necessary in a country\r\nwhich was being rigorously developed.\r\n\r\nFifth, empirical collectivists believe in land control, not only in the\r\ncities, but in the open country as well, as a matter of agrarian reform.\r\nWe have seen that the land figured extensively in the ideology of _min\r\nshêng_, and shall observe that Sun Yat-sen, in his plans for _min shêng_,\r\nstressed the importance of proper control of land.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the theory of distributive justice which forms a third part\r\nof the principle of _min shêng_, one may say that, as far as any\r\ncomparison between a Chinese and a Western idea is valid, the positive\r\nsocial-revolutionary content of _min shêng_ coincides with the doctrines\r\nof that group of Western politico-economic writers whom Coker calls\r\nempirical collectivists. The correspondence between the two may not be a\r\nmere coincidence of names, for in considering Sun Yat-sen’s _min shêng_,\r\none is struck by the empirical, almost opportunistic, nature of the\r\ntheory. A great part of the activity of the Chinese, whether material or\r\nintellectual, has been characterized by a sort of opportunism; not\r\nnecessarily an opportunism of insincerity, it may be more aptly described\r\nas a tendency to seek the golden mean, the reasonable in any situation. It\r\nis this habit of compromise with circumstance, this bland and happy\r\ndisregard of absolutes in theory, which has preserved—with rare\r\nexceptions—the Chinese social mind from the torment of any really bitter\r\nand profound religious conflict, and which may, in these troubled times,\r\nkeep even the most irreconcilable enemies from becoming insane with\r\nintolerance. This fashion of muddling through, of adhering to certain\r\ntraditional general rules of reasonableness, while rendering lip-service\r\nto the doctrines of the moment, has been the despair of many Western\r\nstudents of China, who, embittered at the end, accuse the Chinese of\r\ncomplete insincerity. They do not realize that it is the moderateness of\r\nthe Confucian ideology, the humane and conciliatory outlook that centuries\r\nof cramped civilized life have given the Chinese, that is the basis of\r\nthis, and that this indisposition to adopt hard and fast systems has been\r\none of the ameliorating influences in the present period of serious\r\nintellectual antagonisms. Generalizations concerning China are rarely\r\nworth much. It may be, however, that the doctrine of _min shêng_, with\r\nrespect to its positive socio-economic content, may appear vague to the\r\nWestern student, and that he may surmise it to be a mere cloak for\r\ndemagogues. It could easily do that in the West, or in the hands of\r\ninsincere and unscrupulous leaders. In China, however, it need not\r\nnecessarily have been formulated more positively than it was, because, as\r\nwe have seen, the intellectual temper of the Chinese makes any strict\r\nadherence to a schedule or a plan impossible. It is easy, always, to\r\nrender the courtesies; it is hard to follow the specific content. Sun\r\nYat-sen apparently realized this, and wished to leave a general body of\r\ndoctrine which could be followed and which would not be likely to be\r\nviolated. In any case, the theses of _min shêng_, both ideologically and\r\nprogrammatically, can scarcely be contrasted with the detailed schedules\r\nof social revolution to be found in the West.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s frequent expressions of sympathy with communism and\r\nsocialism, and his occasional identification of the large principles of\r\n_min shêng_ with them, are an indication of his desire for ultimate\r\ncollectivism. (It may be remarked, in passing, that Sun Yat-sen used the\r\nword _collectivist_ in a much more rigid sense than that employed by\r\nCoker.) His concessions to the economic situation of his time, the\r\npragmatic, practical method in which he conceived and advocated his plans,\r\nare a manifestation of the empirical element in his collectivism.\r\n\r\n_Ming shêng_ cannot, however, be thought of as another Western doctrine\r\nfor national economic strength, national economic reconstitution, and\r\nnational distributive justice; it is also a program for the improvement of\r\nthe morale of the people.\r\n\r\nHow is the _min shêng_ doctrine to fit in with the essentially\r\nconservative spirit of the nationalist ideology? If, as Sun proposed, the\r\nnew ideology is to be compounded of the old morality, the old knowledge,\r\nand modern physical science, how is _min shêng_, referring to social as\r\nwell as material programs, to be developed in harmony with the old\r\nknowledge? In the terminology of ultramodern Western political science,\r\nthe ethical, the moral, and the emotional are likely to appear as words of\r\nderision. In a milieu characterized by the curiously warmblooded social\r\noutlook of the Confucians, such terms are still relevant to reality, still\r\nsignificant in the lives of men. The sentimental is intangible in\r\npolitics; for that reason it is hard to fit into contemporary thought, but\r\nthough it cannot be measured and fully understood, its potency cannot be\r\ndisregarded; and for Sun Yat-sen it was of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Min Shêng_ as an Ethical Doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the Confucian doctrine of _jên_, the\r\nfellow-feeling of all mankind—each man’s consciousness of membership in\r\nsociety. This doctrine was formulated in a society unacquainted with Greek\r\nlogic, nor did it have the strange European emphasis upon sheer\r\nintellectuality which has played its way through Western thought. Not, of\r\ncourse, as profoundly introspective as Christianity, nor appealing so\r\ndistinctly to the mystical in man’s nature, it was nevertheless concerned\r\nwith man’s inner life, as well as with the ethics of his outward behavior.\r\nThe Confucian was suffused throughout with the idea of virtue; the moral\r\nand the physical were inextricably intertwined. Its non-logical content\r\nscarcely approached the form of a religion; commentators on the old\r\nideology have not called it religious, despite the prominence of beliefs\r\nin the supernatural.(201) The religion of the Chinese has been\r\nthis-worldly,(202) but it has not on that account been indifferent to the\r\nsubjective aspects of the moral life.(203)\r\n\r\nThe nationalist ideology was designed as the inheritor of and successor\r\nto, the old ideology of China. The doctrine of nationalism narrowed the\r\nfield of the application of Confucianism from the whole civilized world to\r\nthe state-ized society of the Chinese race-nation. The doctrine of\r\ndemocracy implemented the old teachings of popular power and intellectual\r\nleadership with a political mechanism designed to bring forth the full\r\nstrength of both. And the doctrine of _min shêng_ was the economic\r\napplication of the old social ethos.\r\n\r\nIt is in this last significance, rather than in any of its practical\r\nmeanings of recovery, development, and reform, that Sun Yat-sen spoke most\r\nof it to one of his followers.(204) He was concerned with it as a moral\r\nforce. His work was, among other things, a work of moral transformation of\r\nindividual motives.(205) _Min shêng_ must, in addition to its other\r\nmeanings be regarded as an attempt to extend the Chinese ideology to\r\neconomic matters, to lead the Chinese to follow their old ethics. Sun\r\nYat-sen had ample time in his visits to the West to observe the ravages\r\nthat modern civilization had inflicted upon the older Western moral life,\r\nand did not desire that China should also follow the same course. The\r\nhumanity of the old tradition must be kept by the Chinese in their venture\r\ninto the elaborate and dangerous economy of modern life; the machine\r\ncivilization was needed, and was itself desirable,(206) but it could not\r\noverthrow the humane civilization that preceded it and was to continue on\r\nbeneath and throughout it.\r\n\r\nIn this manner a follower of Sun Yat-sen seeks to recall his words: “I\r\nshould say that _min shêng_ focuses our ethical tradition even more than\r\nthe other two principles; after a Chinese has become nationalistic and\r\ndemocratic, he will become socialized through the idea of his own\r\npersonality as an instrument of good for human welfare. In this proud\r\nfeeling of importance to and for the world, egotism gives way to\r\naltruism.... So, I say again that _min shêng_ is an ethical endeavor ...\r\nthis, the final principle (and yet, the first principle which I\r\ndiscovered, in the bitterness and poverty of my boyhood days), will come\r\nimperceptibly into our lives.”(207)\r\n\r\nIn a philosophy for intellectuals such attitudes need not, perhaps, be\r\nreckoned with; in an ideology for revolution and reconstitution, perhaps\r\nthey should. Sun Yat-sen conceived of his own work and his ideology not\r\nonly as political acts but as moral forces; _min shêng_ was at once to\r\ninvigorate the national economy, to industrialize the material\r\ncivilization, and to institute distributive justice, and in addition to\r\nthis, it was to open a new, humane epoch in economic relations. That is\r\nwhy the term, instead of being translated, is left in the Chinese: _min\r\nshêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE PROGRAMS OF NATIONALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuomintang.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was a political leader as well as a political philosopher. His\r\ngrowth as a thinker was intimately associated with the development of his\r\npolitical activities. It would be difficult to say which came first,\r\neither in time or in importance, in his life—his teachings or his work. At\r\ntimes the line between the two becomes vague. Sun made vital commitments\r\nconcerning his ideology in furthering his revolutionary work. These have\r\nto be sifted out from other utterances bearing only upon the immediate\r\nsituation. This is not easy, but neither is it impossible. Lyon Sharman\r\nwrote, “It might be cogently argued that, in dealing with an easily\r\nabsorbent, propagandist mind like Sun Yat-sen’s one should not look to the\r\nshifting ideas for his real opinions, but to those formulations which he\r\nclung to tenaciously all his life.”(208)\r\n\r\nThe ideology of the _San Min Chu I_ provides a broad scheme of terms and\r\nvalues by means of which the Chinese of the twentieth century could orient\r\nthemselves simultaneously in the modern world and in the continuing world\r\nof Confucian civilization. Between this philosophy and the necessity of\r\nimmediate practical action there stands an intermediate step—that of the\r\nplans. The plans provide a theory of means leading to the establishment of\r\nthe ends set up in the ideology. The ideology, left on paper by itself,\r\ncould not bring about China’s salvation; it had to be spread and\r\nimplemented with political action. Sun Yat-sen planned the programs and\r\nactivities of the Chinese revolutionaries in some detail; he proposed\r\npolicies reaching far out into the future. While, since his death, these\r\nplans have been modified to a greater or less degree,(209) they have not\r\nlost all relevance to the course of affairs in China, and, in any case,\r\npossess an interest of their own in the history of political thought, as\r\nillustrating the political doctrines to which Sun Yat-sen’s ideology led\r\nhim. The first problem the plans had to include was that of providing a\r\ntool by which they could be set in motion.\r\n\r\nWhat instrument could preach nationalism to the Chinese people and awaken\r\nthem, and, having awakened them, lead them on to a victorious defense of\r\ntheir race and civilization? Sun’s answer was: “The Kuomintang.” The\r\nnationalist revolutionary party was the designated heir to the leadership\r\nof the people, and even in his life-time Sun Yat-sen worked through the\r\nparty that was almost entirely his own creation.\r\n\r\nThis party had begun as a small group of the personal followers of Sun\r\nYat-sen in the days when he was struggling against the Manchu monarchy\r\nalmost singlehanded. Gradually this group increased and became a\r\nfederation of the great secret orders which had resisted the Manchus for\r\ncenturies. It developed into a modern parliamentary party under the name\r\n_Kuomintang_—literally _nation people party_—with the inauguration of the\r\nfirst republic, but was soon driven underground by the would-be emperor\r\nYüan Shih-k’ai. It emerged again in South China at the end of the World\r\nWar, was reorganized after the Communist model (so far as intra-party\r\norganization was concerned) before the death of Sun Yat-sen, led the\r\nrevolution to the North, and, now, though somewhat less united than\r\nbefore, rules the greater part of China in the name of the Three\r\nPrinciples.(210)\r\n\r\nConfucius preached the slow transformation of society by means of an\r\nintellectual leaven, scholar class, which, by re-forming and clarifying\r\nthe ideology, could gradually minimize conflict among men and bring about\r\nan epoch of concord in which all men would live by reason as found in\r\ntradition. The function of the Kuomintang was, in Sun’s mind, only\r\nremotely similar. The Kuomintang was designed to intervene in a chaos of\r\nwars and corrupt politics, to propagate the nationalist ideology, and\r\navert a tragic fate which would otherwise be inevitable—the disappearance\r\nof China from the map of the world, and the extinction not only of Chinese\r\ncivilization but—as Sun Yat-sen thought—of the Chinese race as well.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the downfall of the monarchy, and for the few years of\r\ndefeat under the first republic, the Kuomintang was not highly organized.\r\nSun Yat-sen’s genius for leadership, and the fervor of his adherents—which\r\ncan be understood only at first-hand, and cannot be explained in rational\r\nterms—were sufficient to hold the party together. But there was far too\r\nmuch discord as to final principles as well as to points of immediate\r\naction, and party activities were not so specialized as to permit maximum\r\nefficiency.(211) Furthermore, there was the question of the relations of\r\nthe party and the state. It was somewhat absurd for the partizans of Sun\r\nYat-sen, having brought about the revolution, to stand back and let\r\nwhomever would walk away with it. The party’s power had ebbed with its\r\nsuccess in 1911. There had to be some way of keeping the party in power\r\nafter it had achieved the overthrow of its enemies, and won the\r\nrevolutionary control of the country. Reorganization was definitely\r\nnecessary if party effectiveness were to be raised to the point of\r\nguaranteeing the success of the next revolution—which Sun did not live to\r\nsee—and party supremacy to the point of assuring the Nationalists control\r\nof the government after the revolution had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nReorganization was effected through the assistance of the Communists\r\nduring the period of the Canton-Moscow entente (1923-1927).(212) Under the\r\nleadership of the extraordinarily able Michael Borodin, the Soviet\r\nadvisers sent from Russia completely re-shaped the internal structure of\r\nthe Kuomintang and won for themselves positions of considerable confidence\r\nand influence, which they lost only when they attempted to transform the\r\nprinciples and objectives of the Party as thoroughly as they had the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang of today, which is irreconcilably opposed to Marxism, still\r\nbears the imprint of Communist design.(213) Though the working details of\r\nthe Party organization do not, for the most part, appear directly relevant\r\nto the principle of _min ch’üan_ of Sun Yat-sen, the arrangements for\r\nParty control illustrate the curious compromise between Chinese and\r\nWestern democratic patterns, on the one hand, and the revolutionary\r\nrequirements of absolutism, on the other, which have made Chinese\r\nrepublicanism seem a sham, if not a farce, to Western scholars who expect\r\nto find in China the same openness and freedom in democratic government to\r\nwhich they are accustomed at home.\r\n\r\nDuring the life-time of Sun there was no question of an elective headship\r\nfor the Party. In spite of the fact that the party stood for democracy, it\r\nseemed impossible that any alternative to Sun Yat-sen himself should be\r\nconsidered. Sun Yat-sen’s complete willingness to continue as head of the\r\nParty without troubling to have himself elected from time to time has been\r\nvariously interpreted: his friends term it the humble and natural\r\nrecognition of a celebrated fact; his enemies regard it as the\r\nhallucination of an egotism as distorted as it was colossal. The truth\r\nwould appear to be that Sun regarded the initiation and the guidance of\r\nthe Nationalist revolution as his particular mission in life. He was, in a\r\nsense, the intellectual proprietor of the Three Principles. Unselfish in\r\nall personal matters, he had few doubts of his own capacity when he had\r\ndiscovered what he believed to be his duty, and unquestioningly set out to\r\nperform it. In the lawlessness and tumult of the revolution, it would have\r\nseemed absurd for Sun Yat-sen to submit to the periodical formula of\r\nreëlection for the sake of any merely theoretical harmony of action and\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nNot only was Sun Yat-sen the leader of the Party; he was not even to have\r\na successor. The first revised constitution of the Kuomintang provided for\r\nhis life-time headship; the second stipulated that the post of _Tsung Li_\r\nshould never be filled by any other person. As _Tsung Li_—the Party\r\nLeader, it is still customary to refer to Sun Yat-sen in China today.\r\nThis, again, was not the display of a superhuman vanity so much as a\r\npractical requirement designed to offset the possibility of conflict and\r\nintrigue among the most conspicuous party chiefs, which would quite\r\nprobably arise should the question of a succession to Sun Yat-sen ever be\r\nmentioned. There was, of course, the element of respect in this\r\ngesture—the implication that the magistral chair of Sun Yat-sen was too\r\nhigh a place for any common man to sit.\r\n\r\nSo far as leadership was concerned the Kuomintang was an autocracy until\r\nthe death of Sun Yat-sen. In all other party matters attempts were made to\r\ncultivate democratic form and instil democratic morale. The prudence of\r\nthis choice may seem to have been borne out by the course of history,\r\nsince the Communists did not become ambitious, nor the Nationalists\r\njealous, to the point of open conflict until after the death of Sun\r\nYat-sen. Western thought will have to make extensive allowances before it\r\ncan comprehend a democratic Party which operated under the unquestioned\r\nauthority of a single man, without recourse to the formula of a plebiscite\r\nor election to a boss-ship in the form of a nominal post made significant\r\nonly by the personal conspicuousness of the incumbent.\r\n\r\nHad Karl Marx lived to work in the Russian Revolution, he might have\r\noccupied a position analogous to that which Sun Yat-sen did in the\r\nChinese. In other respects the new Kuomintang organization was remarkably\r\nlike the Communist. There was the extraordinarily complex, but somehow\r\neffective, mechanism of a Party Congress, a Central Executive Committee,\r\nand a Standing Committee. There was a Political Bureau and an agency for\r\noverseas agitation. There were also the wide ramifications of an extensive\r\nnet work of auxiliary organizations designed to draw strength from every\r\npopular enthusiasm, and deflect it to the cause of the Nationalist\r\nrevolution. In due time these agencies were turned about and swung into\r\naction against the Communists who had attempted to master them.\r\n\r\nThe precise details of Kuomintang organization need not be described. In\r\ngeneral the pattern of authority proceeded from the whole membership, by a\r\nsequence of indirect elections, to the inner group of the Central\r\nExecutive Committee, a body which possesses as much power in China as does\r\nits Soviet prototype.(214) An instance of its power may be given:\r\nrepresentatives are sent by the _tang pu_ (Party Branches) to the Party\r\nCongress; in the event that delegates do not or cannot come, the C. E. C.\r\nhas the power of appointing persons to serve _pro tempore_ as the\r\nrepresentatives of the otherwise unrepresented branches. Since the same\r\ncommittee examines delegates’ credentials, it is apparent that the\r\ntrustworthiness of the Party Congress can be assured in the same manner\r\nthat, to the understanding of the present author, the earlier All-Union\r\nCongresses of Soviets and the C. P. were assured in the Russian\r\nRevolution. The pattern given the Kuomintang by the Russians gave the\r\nParty a strong central control able to assure orthodoxy within the Party;\r\nfor some years, as a matter of history, differences of opinion within the\r\nParty could only be expressed by schism (as in the case of the\r\n“Kuomintang” of Wang Ch’ing-wei). While the aim of the Party was\r\ndemocracy, it cannot be said truthfully that democracy worked in a\r\nmilitant Party engaged in turning an anarchy into a revolution. The\r\nrequirements of revolutionary endeavor, among other things, seem to\r\ninclude an iron-handed leadership of the right sort. Such leadership\r\ncould, in the Sun Yat-sen ideology, be justified by reference to the three\r\nstages of the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang remained, so far as leadership was concerned, the creature\r\nof Sun Yat-sen. In structure it was extensively reorganized to resemble\r\nthe Communist hierarchy found in Russia, with the administrative and\r\nlegislative systems united into grades of conferences and committees. The\r\nKuomintang also took over the Communist system of a registered and\r\ndisciplined membership. To the time of the reorganization in 1923-1924,\r\nthe Party had apparently admitted and expelled members in the informal,\r\nbut effective, manner employed by the old Chinese _hui_—associations;\r\nguilds; or “tongs”—for centuries.(215) Without a complete system of\r\npersonnel book-keeping, it was impossible to keep adequate records of the\r\nperformance of each member and comb through the membership for the purpose\r\nof eliminating undesirables and inactives. At the time of the\r\nreorganization the membership was required to be reënrolled; in many cases\r\ncertificates of membership were granted (in physical appearance resembling\r\na European passport) which, in view of the Party power, entailed a\r\nconsiderable grant of privileges with the more or less corresponding\r\nburden of duties. Party finances notably improved. In time this systematic\r\nmethod of recording membership was applied for the purposes of ousting\r\npersons with Communist or pro-Communist views, or eliminating individuals\r\ntoo friendly with foreign interests believed antagonistic to the Party or\r\nits purposes. “Party purges” have been frequent and drastic since the\r\norganization of a complete membership record.\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang, as it was re-formed just before its swift rise to power\r\nand as it has essentially remained since, was a well-organized body of\r\npersons, subject to varying degrees of Party discipline, and trained in\r\nthe methods of propaganda. The leadership was in the hands of Sun Yat-sen\r\nand, after his death, in the hands of his most trusted military and\r\npolitical aides. The membership, drawn from all parts of China and the\r\nworld, was made up of persons from almost every class in society;\r\nrepresentation was on the Russian plan, tending to centralize power in the\r\nC. E. C.(216) Intra-party democracy was not, for the most part, put into\r\npractice because of the disturbed political and economic conditions. The\r\nParty and its predecessors have, in the forty-odd years of their combined\r\nexistence, been facing what amounted to a state of perpetual emergency.\r\nSometimes badly, but more often effectively, they have struggled to\r\nestablish a state which in turn can found the democratic ideology of Sun\r\nupon which the democracy of the future must, they believe, be based.\r\n\r\nSun did not state definitely that the Party was to be dissolved after the\r\ntask of its dictatorship was completed, and China had won a stable\r\ndemocratic government. That decision, of perpetuating the Party as one of\r\nmany competing parties in the new democracy, or of abolishing it\r\naltogether, was presumably to be left to the Party leaders of the time. A\r\nprecedent may be found in the behavior of Sun himself after the\r\nestablishment of the Republic in 1912; he continued the Nationalist Party\r\nas one of the chief parties in the parliamentary republic. Yüan Shih-k’ai\r\nsoon drove it underground again. From this it might be possible to\r\nconclude that the Party having done with its trusteeship, need not commit\r\nsuicide as a party, but could continue in some form or another.\r\n\r\nThe Kuomintang forms the link between the theories of Sun and the\r\nrealities of the revolutionary struggle; it ties together his plans for a\r\nnew democracy in China and his strategies in the conflicts of the moment.\r\nFirst instrument of the ideology, it bears the burden of bringing about\r\nthe revolution, and bringing the country to the stage of testing the\r\nadministrative and political theories of the founder, and simultaneously\r\ninculcating the democratic principle in the minds of those who are to bear\r\nthe heritage of Chinese organization and culture on to the future.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Sun Yat-sen, the Communist gift of organization, and the\r\nfervor of the membership brought about the defeat or submission—however\r\nnominal the latter may have been—of the warlords. By what stages,\r\naccording to the theory of Sun Yat-sen, could national unity be realized?\r\nWhat, given power, should the Kuomintang do to guarantee the success of\r\nthe revolution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dragon Throne and State Allegiance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first task which the Kuomintang, once established, had to perform was\r\na necessary preliminary to the other portions of its work—such as the\r\nleading of the first steps against the Western inroads, the opening up of\r\nthe democratic technique of government, and the initiation of the first\r\nphases of _min shêng_. That task was to awaken the Chinese to the fact\r\nthat they were a nation, and not only a nation, but an abused and\r\nendangered one as well.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Sun Yat-sen regarded nationalism as a precious treasure\r\nwhich the Chinese had lost.(217) He had said, many years before, in his\r\n_Kidnapped in London_, that the Manchus had followed a deliberate policy\r\nof intellectual suppression designed to extinguish or divert Chinese\r\nnationalism, and to make the great masses of Chinese on whom the Manchu\r\npower depended oblivious to the fact that they were the humiliated slaves\r\nof alien conquerors.(218) Again, in the third lecture on nationalism, he\r\nsaid that while the Emperors Kang Hsi and Ch’ien Lung were at least honest\r\nin acknowledging themselves to be Manchus, extenuating their presence on\r\nthe Dragon Throne by claiming the imperial hero-sages, Shun and Wen Wang,\r\nof antiquity as fellow-barbarians, the Manchu Emperors after Ch’ien Lung\r\ndid everything they could to suppress Chinese nationalist ideas. They even\r\ndid not hesitate to revise the classics of history in order to obliterate\r\nwhatever historical consciousness the Chinese may have had of\r\nthemselves.(219) Sun Yat-sen pointed out that the strong\r\ngroup-consciousness of the Jews has kept Judea living through the\r\ncenturies, even though the Jewish state was obliterated and the Jews\r\nthemselves scattered to the four winds. He also praised the Poles,(220)\r\nwho were subjugated by aliens as were the Chinese, but kept their\r\nnationalist ideas and were consequently restored as an honored nation\r\nafter the world war. Hence, the first step in the program of Chinese\r\nnationalism was to be the creation of a consciousness of that nationalism.\r\nIf the Chinese did not regain their nationalism, “that precious treasure\r\nwhich makes possible the subsistence of humanity,”(221) they might meet\r\nthe fate of the Miao tribes whom the Chinese had pushed back into desolate\r\nlands and who faced an ignominious extinction.\r\n\r\nThis consciousness of themselves as a race-national unity was not of\r\nitself enough. The Chinese had lost the favored position that they had\r\nheld since before the beginning of recorded history, and were no longer in\r\na position to view the frailties of outside nations with the charity to\r\nwhich their once impregnable position had entitled them. It was no longer\r\na mere question of pushing through a recognition that China, hitherto\r\nregarded by the Chinese as the ecumene of civilization, was a nation, and\r\nnot even an equal to the other nations. This idea had to be developed into\r\na force.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen wrote, of the significance of philosophy in action: “What is a\r\nprinciple? A principle is an idea, a belief, a force. As a rule, when men\r\nsearch for the truth of a thesis, they first reflect upon it, then their\r\nreflections grow into a belief, and that belief becomes a force. Hence in\r\norder to be firmly established, a principle must pass through the\r\ndifferent stages of idea, belief, and force.”(222) No more definite\r\nstatement of the ideological consequences of thought could be found. Sun\r\nYat-sen appreciated this, and realized that, in the carrying out of his\r\nideology, the first necessity was the adoption of the ideology itself. All\r\nother steps must be secondary. The grouping of the important steps in the\r\nfulfillment of the program of nationalism may have differed from time to\r\ntime,(223) but the actual work of Sun Yat-sen was based upon the method\r\nindicated: the establishment of at least the preliminary notions of the\r\nideology as a prerequisite to effective social action. (In this\r\nconnection, and in anticipation of further discussion, it might be pointed\r\nout that the advantage of the Moscow-Canton entente was not one gained\r\nfrom the superior appeal of the Communist ideology, but from the superior\r\nagitation techniques which the Nationalists learned from the Communists,\r\nand which enabled them to bring into play the full latent social force in\r\nSun Yat-sen’s ideas.) But if mere national-consciousness were insufficient\r\nof itself, what else was needed?\r\n\r\nLoyalty was necessary. Being aware of themselves as Chinese would not help\r\nthem, unless they united and were loyal to that union. “To say that what\r\nthe ancients understood by loyalty was loyalty toward the emperor, and\r\nthat, since we no longer have an emperor, we (need no longer) speak of\r\nloyalty, and to believe that we can act as we please—that is a grave\r\nerror.”(224) Sun Yat-sen thus points out one of the most tragically\r\nperplexing of the problems of the new China.\r\n\r\nHe was urging return to the ancient morality. The ancient code of loyalty\r\nwas one built up to the emperor. Although the emperor did not have much\r\npower, in comparison with some despots who have changed history, he was\r\nnevertheless the man at the apex of society. The Confucian society was one\r\nbuilt in general upon the grand design of an enormous family; a design\r\nwhich was, nevertheless, flexible enough to permit the deposition of a\r\nwicked or mad emperor—something which the Japanese order of things could\r\nnot in theory, although it did in fact, tolerate. Filial piety was piety\r\ntoward one’s own family head; loyalty was piety toward the family head of\r\nall civilized society.\r\n\r\nMany writers have pointed out the discord and unhappiness which the\r\nabolition of the Empire brought to many Chinese. Their code of honor was\r\noutraged; the embodiment of their social stability was gone.(225) The\r\ncritics who made the comment could not, of course, deny the general trend\r\naway of political organization throughout the world from monarchy. They\r\ndid question the competence of the Chinese to make the readjustment at the\r\npresent stage of their history, or believed that the Chinese could not\r\npreserve their traditional civilization under a governmental system which\r\nwas alien to the form if not to the spirit of the Chinese tradition.\r\nAlthough their criticisms may be influenced too heavily by an antiquarian\r\nappreciation of the excellencies of the Chinese Imperial system, or a\r\ndesire to preserve China as a sort of vast museum with all its\r\nquaintnesses of yesteryear, there is some point to what they say, since\r\nthe transition to national-state allegiance was not an easy one. There\r\nwere two factors involved in it, besides the tremendousness of the\r\neducational task of convincing almost half a billion people that they were\r\nno longer ruled by a properly deputized agent of the universe, but were\r\nquite free to manage their world as they collectively saw fit. These\r\nfactors were, first, the necessity of preventing any possible resurrection\r\nof the Dragon Throne, and second, the inculcation of allegiance to an\r\nintangible state.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen pointed out the enormous waste of blood and wealth involved in\r\nthe change from one dynasty to another, when the highest post in the whole\r\nworld was suddenly left open for the strongest man to seize. Republicanism\r\nwould consequently tend to prevent civil wars in the future;(226) the\r\ncumbersome, murderous old method of expressing the popular will, as the\r\nConfucian ideology provided, was to be done away with, and peaceful\r\nchanges of political personnel developed. He asserted that the T’ai P’ing\r\nrebels, of whose memory he was fond, had failed in their fierce attempt to\r\nestablish a fantastic pseudo-Christian, proletarian, collectivistic\r\ndynasty in the sixth and seventh decade of the nineteenth century because\r\nof the dispute that arose within their ranks as to leadership.(227) He\r\nalso pointed out that many of the militarists under the Republic knew well\r\nthat the Dragon Throne was empty, but did not know that it was gone.\r\n\r\nThe story of the eradication of monarchy from Chinese society is an\r\ninteresting one, relevant to the question of the old and the new loyalty.\r\nSun Yat-sen’s full force was thrown at first against the Manchus. He\r\ntaught the other two principles of democracy and _min shêng_, but in his\r\nearlier years he attracted most attention by his anti-Manchu activities.\r\nNow, in allowing the principle of nationalism to do the work of the\r\nprinciple of democracy, Sun Yat-sen was using the anti-dynastic\r\nrevolutionary potentialities of the situation to push along an\r\nanti-monarchical movement. The Chinese constitutional arrangement was\r\nsuch, under the Manchus, that a foreign monarch, who was a sovereign in\r\nhis own right, quite apart from China, sat on the Chinese throne. The\r\nManchu Emperor occupied the Dragon Throne. Many were willing to rebel\r\nagainst a Manchu; they might have hesitated had an indigenous prince\r\noccupied that position.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the establishment of the first Republic, in 1912, the\r\nManchu Emperor was allowed to continue residence in Peking. Retaining his\r\ndynastic title and the use of the Forbidden City, he was to receive a\r\nstipend from the Chinese Republic and to be entitled to all the privileges\r\nnormally accorded a foreign emperor by international law. There is a\r\nremote possibility, although the truth of this surmise cannot be\r\nsubstantiated, that he was left there as a sort of scarecrow, to prevent\r\nanyone from seizing the throne. Constitutional difficulties would have\r\narisen if a pensioned Manchu Emperor and a native caesarian Emperor were\r\nto attempt to occupy the same throne.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar arrangement does not seem to have helped matters much. There\r\nwas not enough pro-Manchu sentiment to support any restoration movement on\r\na large scale, such as a reactionary insurrection, and the personal\r\nunpopularity of the one man, Yüan Shih-k’ai, who, as dictator of the first\r\nRepublic (1912-1916), sought the throne, was enough to keep any active\r\nmonarchical movement from succeeding. The one attempt of the Manchu\r\npartizans, in 1917, failed utterly.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that the Dragon Throne was not missed. A general\r\nrelaxation of political ethics was observable. The old tradition could not\r\neasily be reconciled to a juristic notion from outside. Sun Yat-sen sought\r\nmost eagerly to impress upon the Chinese the necessity for state\r\nallegiance in place of monarchical devotion: “At present everybody says\r\nthat morality was overthrown with the advent of the republic. The main\r\nreason is right here. Reasonably speaking we must practice loyalty even\r\nunder a republican regime, not loyalty to a sovereign, but loyalty toward\r\nthe nation, loyalty toward the people, loyalty toward our four hundred\r\nmillion men. Of course, loyalty toward four hundred million men is\r\nsomething much more exalted than loyalty toward one single man. Hence we\r\nmust preserve the excellent virtue of loyalty.”(228) A curious emphasis on\r\nthe physical object of loyalty is present here. The Chinese, having no\r\nbackground of Western juristic hypostatizations, were unable to be\r\nfaithful to a legal fiction; expressing state allegiance, Sun Yat-sen had\r\nto put it in its most tangible form, that of a concord of human beings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, under the republic, the old virtue of personal loyalty\r\nshould not interfere with state allegiance. Sun Yat-sen was willing and\r\nanxious that the Chinese should consider their loyalty as being directed\r\nto the nation; he did not wish that the officials of the nation, as men,\r\nshould get it. In that case the very purpose of democracy would be\r\ndefeated, and a monarchy or an oligarchy set up with the formulae of a\r\ndemocracy. Sun Yat-sen was as radically republican as any early American.\r\n“In regard to the government of the nation, fundamentally, it is the\r\npeople who have the power, but the administration of the government must\r\nbe entrusted to experts who have the capacity. We need not regard those\r\nexperts as stately and honorable presidents and ministers, but merely as\r\nchauffeurs of automobiles, as sentinels who guard the gate, as cooks who\r\nprepare the food, as doctors who attend to sicknesses, as carpenters who\r\nbuild houses, as tailors who make clothes.”(229) State allegiance had to\r\nbe directed between the Scylla of a monarchical restoration and the\r\nCharybdis of nominally republican personal government. The old form had to\r\nbe discarded, and the old habits turned in a new direction, but not in the\r\neasiest direction that they might take.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the supplanting of the Dragon Throne by a state was not an\r\neasy one. In the preparation of the Chinese people for the initiation of\r\nan active program of nationalism, the first elements of the nationalist\r\nideology had to be inculcated. This involved race-consciousness. But the\r\nidea of race-consciousness and national-consciousness could not be exerted\r\nas a force unless the conscious union of the Chinese race-nation was\r\naccompanied by the erection of a powerful democratic state, and unless\r\nthis state fell heir to the loyalty which had once been shown the Throne,\r\nor even a higher loyalty. This loyalty had to be based on the two\r\nsuppositions that the Empire was gone forever, and that personal loyalty,\r\neven under the forms of a republic, should not be allowed to take its\r\nplace. Only with a genuine state-allegiance could the Chinese advance to\r\ntheir national salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic Nationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideological establishment of a race-national outlook would have\r\nfar-reaching consequences that might well continue working themselves out\r\nfor centuries. The immediate exercise of this sense of unity was to be\r\ndeveloped through a loyalty to state allegiance, which would also of\r\nitself be significant. These two new patterns—the one ideological, and the\r\nother institutional—running through the Chinese society and social mind\r\nwere vitally necessary. But after the institutional habit of\r\nstate-allegiance had been developed, what was the new democratic state,\r\nthe instrument of the awakened race-nation, to do in the way of practical\r\npolicies to give effect to the new consciousness and strength of Chinese\r\nnationalism?\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen, whose principles tended to develop themselves in terms of\r\nthrees,(230) cited three perils constituting a threat to the Chinese\r\nsociety. The first was the peril to the Chinese race, which was faced with\r\nthe possibility of decline in an expanding Western World and might even\r\nbecome vestigial or extinct. This peril was to be fought with\r\nrace-nationalism. The second was the peril to the Chinese polity, the\r\ndanger that China might become politically appurtenant to some foreign\r\npower of group of powers. This was to be fought with democratic\r\nrace-nationalism. And the last, and most insidious, was the peril to the\r\nChinese economy, the looting of China by the unfair economic measures of\r\nthe great powers, to be met by a nationalist economic program. Sun Yat-sen\r\nwas most apprehensive of the combined strength of these three pressures:\r\n“... I fear that our people are in a very difficult position; and I fear\r\nthat we may perish in the near future. We are threatened by the three\r\nforces I have mentioned: namely, the increase of foreign population, the\r\npolitical force, and the economic force of the foreigners.”(231)\r\n\r\nOf the three forms of the foreign oppression of China, the economic,\r\nbecause it did not show itself so readily, and was already working full\r\nforce, was the most dangerous. It was from this oppression that China had\r\nsunk to the degraded position of a sub-colony. “This economic oppression,\r\nthis immense tribute is a thing which we did not dream of; it is something\r\nwhich cannot be easily detected, and hence we do not feel the awful shame\r\nof it.”(232)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen, as stated above, was not hostile to the development of that\r\nportion of foreign capital which he regarded as fairly employed in China,\r\nand spent a great part of his life in seeking to introduce capital from\r\noutside. He did, however, make a distinction between the just operation of\r\neconomic forces, and the unjust combination of the economic with the\r\npolitically oppressive. Foreign capital in China was not oppressive\r\nbecause it was capital; it was oppressive because it held a privileged\r\nposition, and because it was reinforced by political and military\r\nsanctions. There is no implication in Sun Yat-sen’s works that the\r\noperations of finance, when not unjustly interfered with by political\r\naction, could, even when adverse to China, be regarded as wrong of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn what ways, then, did foreign capital so invest its position with unjust\r\nnon-economic advantages that it constituted a burden and an oppression?\r\nThere were, according to Sun Yat-sen, six headings under which the various\r\ntypes of economic incursion could be classified, with the consequence that\r\na total of one billion two hundred million Chinese dollars were unjustly\r\nexacted from the Chinese economy every year by the foreigners.\r\n\r\nFirst, the control of the Customs services having, by treaty, been\r\nsurrendered by China, and a standard _ad valorem_ tariff having also been\r\nset by treaty, the Chinese had to leave their markets open to whatever\r\nforeign commerce might choose to come. They were not in a position to\r\nfoster their new modern industries by erecting a protective tariff, as had\r\nthe United States in the days of its great industrial development.(233)\r\nChina’s adverse balance in trade constituted a heavy loss to the already\r\ninadequate capital of the impoverished nation. Furthermore, the amount of\r\nthe possible revenue which could be collected under an autonomous tariff\r\nsystem was lost. Again, foreign goods were not required, by treaty\r\nstipulation, to pay the internal transit taxes which Chinese goods had to\r\npay. As a result, the customs situation really amounted to the development\r\nof a protective system for foreign goods in China, to the direct financial\r\nloss of the Chinese, and to the detriment of their industrial development.\r\nHe estimated that half a billion dollars, Chinese, was lost yearly,\r\nthrough this politically established economic oppression.(234) Obviously,\r\none of the first steps of Chinese economic nationalism had to be tariff\r\nautonomy.\r\n\r\nSecond, the foreign banks occupied an unfair position in China. They had\r\nwon a virtual monopoly of banking, with the consequence that the Chinese\r\nbanks had to appear as marginal competitors, weak and unsound because the\r\npeople were “poisoned by economic oppression.”(235) The foreign banks\r\nissued paper money, which gave them cost-free capital; they discounted\r\nChinese paper too heavily; and they paid either no or very little interest\r\non deposits. In some cases they actually charged interest on deposits. A\r\nsecond step of economic nationalism had to be the elimination of the\r\nprivileged position of the foreign banks, which were not subject to\r\nChinese jurisdiction, and were thus able to compete unfairly with the\r\nnative banks.\r\n\r\nThird, economic oppression manifested itself in transportation, chiefly by\r\nwater. The economic impotence of the Chinese made them use foreign bottoms\r\nalmost altogether; the possible revenue which could be saved or perhaps\r\nactually gained from the use of native shipping was lost.\r\n\r\nFourth, the Western territorial concessions constituted an economic\r\ndisadvantage to the Chinese. Wrested from the old Manchu government, they\r\ngave the foreigners a strangle-hold on the Chinese economy. Besides, they\r\nrepresented a direct loss to the Chinese by means of the following items:\r\ntaxes paid to the foreign authorities in the conceded ports, which was\r\npaid by the Chinese and lost to China; land rents paid by Chinese to\r\nforeign individuals, who adopted this means of supplementing the tribute\r\nlevied from the Chinese in the form of taxes; finally, the unearned\r\nincrement paid out by Chinese to foreign land speculators, which amounted\r\nto an actual loss to China. Under a nationalist economic program, not only\r\nwould the favorable position of the foreign banks be reduced to one\r\ncomparable with that of the Chinese banks, but the concessions would be\r\nabolished. Taxes would go to the Chinese state, the land rent system would\r\nbe corrected, and unearned increment would be confiscated under a somewhat\r\nnovel tax scheme proposed by Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nFifth, the Chinese lost by reason of various foreign monopolies or special\r\nconcessions. Such enterprises as the Kailan Mining Administration and the\r\nSouth Manchuria Railway were wholly foreign, and were, by privileges\r\npolitically obtained, in a position to prevent Chinese competition. This\r\ntoo had to be corrected under a system of economic nationalism. The new\r\nstate, initiated by the Kuomintang and carried on by the people, had to be\r\nable to assure the Chinese an equality of economic privilege in their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSixth, the foreigners introduced “speculation and various other sorts of\r\nswindle” into China.(236) They had exchanges and lotteries by which the\r\nChinese lost tens of millions of dollars yearly.\r\n\r\nUnder these six headings Sun Yat-sen estimated the Chinese tribute to\r\nWestern imperialism to be not less than one billion two hundred millions a\r\nyear, silver. There were, of course, other forms of exaction which the\r\nWesterners practised on the Chinese, such as the requirement of war\r\nindemnities for the various wars which they had fought with China.\r\nFurthermore, the possible wealth which China might have gained from\r\ncontinued relations with her lost vassal states was diverted to the\r\nWestern powers and Japan. Sun Yat-sen also referred to the possible losses\r\nof Chinese overseas, which they suffered because China was not powerful\r\nenough to watch their rights and to assure them equality of opportunity.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not expect that forces other than those which political\r\nnationalism exerted upon the economic situation could save the Chinese.\r\n“If we do not find remedies to that big leakage of $1,200,000,000.00 per\r\nyear, that sum will increase every year; there is no reason why it should\r\nnaturally decrease of its own accord.”(237) The danger was great, and the\r\nChinese had to use their nationalism to offset the imperialist economic\r\noppression which was not only impoverishing the nation from year to year,\r\nbut which was actually preventing the development of a new, strong, modern\r\nnational economy.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relation of the sub-principle of economic nationalism to the\r\nprinciple of _min shêng_?(238) Economic nationalism was the preliminary\r\nremedy. The program of _min shêng_ was positive. It was the means of\r\ncreating a wealthy state, a modern, just economic society. But the old\r\noppressions of imperialism, lingering on, had to be cleared away before\r\nChina could really initiate such a program. Not only was it the duty of\r\nthe Chinese national and nationalist state to fight the political methods\r\nof Western imperialism; the Chinese people could help by using that old\r\nAsiatic weapon—the boycott.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was pleased and impressed with the consequences of Gandhi’s\r\npolicy of non-coöperation. He pointed out that even India, which was a\r\nsubject country, could practise non-coöperation to the extreme discomfort\r\nof the British. The creation of race-nationalism, and of allegiance to a\r\nstrong Chinese state, might take time. Non-coöperation did not. It was a\r\ntool at hand. “The reason why India gained results from the\r\nnon-coöperation policy was that it could be practised by all the\r\ncitizens.”(239) The Chinese could begin their economic nationalist program\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen pointed out that the basis for the weakness of China, and its\r\nexploitation by the foreigners, was the inadequacy of the Chinese\r\nideology. “The reason why we suffer from foreign oppression is our\r\nignorance; we ‘are born in a stupor and die in a dream’.”(240) Conscious\r\nof the peril of the foreign economic oppression, the Chinese had to exert\r\neconomic nationalism to clear the way for the positive initiation of a\r\nprogram of _min shêng_. In practising economic nationalism, there were two\r\nways that the Chinese could make the force of their national union and\r\nnational spirit felt: first, through the actual advancement of the\r\nprograms of the whole of nationalism and the progress of the political and\r\neconomic condition of the country; second, through non-coöperation, “... a\r\nnegative boycott which weakens the action of imperialism, protects\r\nnational standing, and preserves from destruction.”(241)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Nationalism for National Autonomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first steps of resistance to economic oppression, the Chinese\r\nnationalists would have to launch a counter-attack on the political\r\noppression practised upon China by the Western powers. In his discussion\r\nof this, Sun Yat-sen described, though briefly, the past, the\r\ncontemporary, and the future of that oppression, and referred to its\r\nmethods. His theory also contained three answers to this oppression which\r\nneed to be examined in a consideration of his theoretical program of\r\nChinese nationalism: first, the question of China’s nationalist program of\r\npolitical anti-imperialism; second, the nature of the ultimate development\r\nof nationalism and a national state; and third, the theory of the class\r\nwar of the nations. In view of the fact that this last is a theory in\r\nitself, and one quite significant in the distinction between the doctrines\r\nof Sun Yat-sen and those of Marxism-Leninism, it will be considered\r\nseparately. The first two questions of the program of nationalism are,\r\nthen: what is to be the negative action for the advancement of China’s\r\nnational political strength, in opposing the political power of the West?\r\nand what is to be the positive, internal program of Chinese nationalism?\r\n\r\nAs has been stated Sun Yat-sen used the anti-dynastic sentiment current in\r\nthe last years of the Manchus as an instrument by means of which he could\r\nfoster an anti-monarchical movement. The great significance of his\r\nnationalism as a nationalism of Chinese _vis-à-vis_ their\r\nOriental-barbarian rulers quite overshadowed its importance as a teaching\r\ndesigned to protect China against its Western-barbarian exploiters. The\r\ntriumph of the Republicans was so startling that, for a time, Sun Yat-sen\r\nseems to have believed that nationalism could develop of itself, that the\r\nChinese, free from their Manchu overlords, would develop a strong\r\nrace-national consciousness without the necessity of any political or\r\nparty fostering of such an element in their ideology. Afire with all the\r\nidealism of the false dawn of the first Republic, Sun Yat-sen dropped the\r\nprinciple of nationalism from his program, and converted his fierce\r\nconspiratorial league into a parliamentary party designed to enter into\r\namicable competition with the other parties of the new era.(242) This\r\npleasant possibility did not develop. The work of nationalism was by no\r\nmeans done. The concept of state-allegiance had not entered into the\r\nChinese ideology as yet, and the usurper-President Yüan Shih-k’ai was able\r\nto gather his henchmen about him and plan for a powerful modern Empire of\r\nwhich he should be forced by apparently popular acclamation to assume\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe further necessity for nationalism appeared in several ways. First, the\r\nChinese had not become nationalistic enough in their attitude toward the\r\npowers. Sun Yat-sen, with his reluctance to enter into violent\r\ndisagreement with the old ideology, was most unwilling that chauvinism\r\nshould be allowed in China.(243) He hoped that the Western powers, seeing\r\na fair bargain, would be willing to invest in China sufficient capital to\r\nadvance Chinese industrial conditions. Instead, he saw Japanese capital\r\npouring into Peking for illegitimate purposes, and accepted by a\r\nprostituted government of politicians. With the continuation of the\r\nunfavorable financial policy of the powers, and the continuing remoteness\r\nof any really helpful loans, he began to think that the Chinese had to\r\nrely on their own strength for their salvation.(244) Second, he realized\r\nthat the foreigners in China were not generally interested in a strong,\r\nmodern Chinese state if that state were to be developed by Chinese and not\r\nby themselves. Sun had understood from the beginning that the great aim of\r\nnationalism was to readjust the old world-society to nationhood in the\r\nmodern world; he had not, perhaps, realized that the appearance of this\r\nnationhood was going to be opposed by foreigners.(245) When he came to\r\npower in 1912, he thought that the immediate end of nationalism—liberation\r\nof China from Manchu overlordship—had been achieved. He was preoccupied\r\nwith the domestic problems of democracy and _min shêng_. When, however,\r\nthe foreign powers refused to let his government at Canton exercise even\r\nthe limited authority permitted the Chinese by the treaties over their own\r\ncustoms service, and did not let Sun take the surplus funds allowed the\r\nChinese (after payment of interest due on the money they had lent various\r\nChinese governments), his appreciation of the active propagation of\r\nnationalism was heightened. He realized that the Chinese had to fight\r\ntheir own battles, and that, while they might find individual friends\r\namong the Westerners, they could scarcely hope for a policy of the great\r\npowers which would actually foster the growth of the new national\r\nChina.(246) Simultaneously, he found his advocacy of a nationalist program\r\nreceiving unexpected support from the Soviet Union. His early contacts\r\nwith the Russians, who were the only foreigners actually willing to\r\nintervene in his behalf with shipments of arms and money, made him\r\ninterested in the doctrines lying behind their actions, so inconsistent\r\nwith those of the other Western powers. In the Communist support of his\r\nnationalism as a stage in the struggle against imperialism, he found his\r\nthird justification of a return, with full emphasis, to the program of\r\nnationalism.\r\n\r\nHence, at the time that he delivered his sixteen lectures, which represent\r\nthe final and most authoritative stage of his principles, and the one with\r\nwhich the present work is most concerned, he had returned to an advocacy\r\nof nationalism after a temporary hope that enough work had been done along\r\nthat line. In expelling the alien Manchu rulers of China, he had hoped\r\nthat the old Chinese nationalism might revive, as soon as it was free of\r\nthe police restrictions had placed on race-national propaganda by the\r\nEmpire. He had found that this suspension of a nationalist campaign was\r\npremature because nationalism had not firmly entrenched itself in the\r\nChinese social mind. In the first place, state allegiance was weak;\r\nusurpers, dictators and military commandants strode about the Chinese\r\ncountryside with personal armies at their heels. Secondly, the foreign\r\npowers, out of respect to whom, perhaps, a vigorous patriotic campaign had\r\nnot been carried out, did not show themselves anxious to assist China—at\r\nleast, not as anxious as Sun Yat-sen expected them to be. Third, the\r\ninspiration offered by a power which, although temporarily submerged, had\r\nrecently been counted among the great powers of the world, and which had\r\nrejected the aggressive policy which the rest of the Western nations, to a\r\ngreater or less degree, pursued in the Far East, was sufficient to\r\nconvince Sun Yat-sen of the justice of the doctrines of that power. Soviet\r\nRussia did not stop with words; it offered to associate with China as an\r\nequal, and the Soviet representative in Peking was the first diplomat to\r\nbe given the title of ambassador to China.\r\n\r\nThe sharpening of the nationalist policy into a program of\r\nanti-imperialism seems to have been the direct result of the Communist\r\nteachings, one of the conspicuous contributions of the Marxians to the\r\nprogrammatic part of the theories of Sun Yat-sen. As earlier stated, their\r\nideology influenced his almost not all. Their programs, on the other hand,\r\nwere such an inspiration to the Chinese nationalists that the latter had\r\nno hesitation in accepting them. Hu Han-min, one of the moderate\r\nKuomintang leaders, who would certainly not go out of his way to give the\r\nCommunists credit which they did not deserve, stated unequivocally that\r\nthe Chinese did not have the slogan, “Down with Imperialism!” in the 1911\r\nrevolution, and gave much credit to the Bolsheviks for their\r\nanti-imperialist lesson to the Chinese.(247)\r\n\r\nIn describing the political aggression of the Western states upon the\r\nChinese society, Sun Yat-sen began by contrasting the nature of the\r\ninter-state vassalage which the peripheral Far Eastern states had once\r\nowed to the Chinese core-society. He stated that the Chinese did not\r\npractise aggression on their neighbors, and that the submission of the\r\nneighboring realms was a submission based on respect and not on\r\ncompulsion. “If at that time all small states of Malaysia wanted to pay\r\ntribute and adopt Chinese customs, it was because they admired Chinese\r\ncivilization and spontaneously wished to submit themselves; it was not\r\nbecause China oppressed them through military force.”(248) Even the\r\nposition of the Philippines, which Sun Yat-sen thought a very profitable\r\nand pleasant one under American rule, was not satisfactory to the\r\nFilipinos of modern times, who, unlike the citizens of the vassal states\r\nof old China, were dissatisfied with their subordinate positions.(249)\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that this benevolent Chinese position was destroyed as the\r\nWest appeared and annexed these various states, with the exception of\r\nSiam. He then emphasized that this may have been done in the past with a\r\nview to the division of China between the various great powers.(250)\r\n\r\nThis partitioning had been retarded, but the danger was still present. The\r\nChinese revolution of 1911 may have shown the powers that there was some\r\nnationalism still left in China.(251)\r\n\r\nThe military danger was tremendous. “Political power can exterminate a\r\nnation in a morning’s time. China who is now suffering through the\r\npolitical oppression of the powers is in danger of perishing at any\r\nmoment. She is not safe from one day to the other.”(252) Japan could\r\nconquer China in ten days. The United States could do it in one month.\r\nEngland would take two months at the most, as would France. The reason why\r\nthe powers did not settle the Chinese question by taking the country was\r\nbecause of their mutual distrust; it was not due to any fear of China. No\r\none country would start forth on such an adventure, lest it become\r\ninvolved with the others and start a new world war.(253)\r\n\r\nIf this were the case, the danger from diplomacy would be greater even\r\nthan that of war. A nation could be extinguished by the stroke of a pen.\r\nThe Chinese had no reason to pride themselves on their possible military\r\npower, their diplomacy, or their present independence. Their military\r\npower was practically nil. Their diplomacy amounted to nothing. It was not\r\nthe Chinese but the aggressors themselves that had brought about the\r\nlong-enduring stalemate with respect to the Chinese question. The\r\nWashington Conference was an attempt on the part of the foreigners to\r\napportion their rights and interests in China without fighting. This made\r\npossible the reduction of armaments.(254) The present position of China\r\nwas not one in which the Chinese could take pride. It was humiliating.\r\nChina, because it was not the colony of one great power, was the\r\nsub-colony of all. The Chinese were not even on a par with the colonial\r\nsubjects of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe shameful and dangerous position thus outlined by Sun could be remedied\r\nonly by the development of nationalism and the carrying-on of the struggle\r\nagainst imperialism.\r\n\r\nAnti-imperialism was the fruit of his contact with the Bolsheviks. His\r\nnationalism had approached their programs of national liberation, but the\r\nprecise verbal formulation had not been adopted until he came in contact\r\nwith the Marxian dialecticians of the Third International. His\r\nanti-imperialism differed from theirs in several important respects. He\r\nwas opposed to political intervention for economic purposes; this was\r\nimperialism, and unjust. The economic consequences of political\r\nintervention were no better than the intervention itself. Nevertheless, at\r\nno time did he offer an unqualified rejection of capitalism. He sought\r\nloans for China, and distinguished between capital which came to China in\r\nsuch a manner as to profit the Chinese as well as its owners, and that\r\nwhich came solely to profit the capitalists advancing it, to the economic\r\ndisadvantage of the Chinese. In his ideology, Sun Yat-sen never appears to\r\nhave accepted the Marxian thesis of the inevitable fall of capitalism, nor\r\ndoes he seem to have thought that imperialism was a necessary and final\r\nstage in the history of capitalism.\r\n\r\nIn short, his program of anti-imperialism and the foreign policy of\r\nChinese political nationalism, seem to be quite comparable to the policy\r\nheld by the Soviets, apart from those attitudes and activities which their\r\npeculiar ideology imposed. In practical matters, in affairs and actions\r\nwhich he could observe with his own eyes, Sun Yat-sen was in accord with\r\nthe anti-imperialism of Soviet Russia and of his Communist advisers. In\r\nthe deeper implications of anti-imperialism and in the pattern of the\r\nMarxian-Leninist ideology underlying it in the U.S.S.R., he showed little\r\ninterest. Ideologically he remained Chinese; programmatically he was\r\nwilling to learn from the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe internal program of his nationalism was one which seems to have been\r\ninfluenced by the outlook developed by himself. His vigorous denunciation\r\nof Utopian cosmopolitanism prevents his being considered an\r\ninternationalist. He had, on the occasion of the institution of the first\r\nRepublic, been in favor of the freedom of nations even when that freedom\r\nmight be exercised at the expense of the Chinese. The Republic might\r\nconceivably have taken the attitude that it had fallen heir to the\r\noverlordship enjoyed by the Manchu Empire, and consequently refused\r\nrepresentation to the Mongols, Manchus, Tibetans, and Mohammedans. It was,\r\nhowever, called the Republic of Chung Hua (instead of the Republic of\r\nHan), and a five-striped flag, representing its five constituent “races,”\r\nwas adopted. Sun Yat-sen later gave a graphic description of the\r\nworld-wide appeal of Woodrow Wilson’s principle of national\r\nself-determination. He did not think that the principle, once enunciated,\r\ncould be recalled; and stated that the defeat of the minor and colonial\r\nnations at the Versailles Conference, which drafted a very unjust treaty,\r\nwas an instance of the deceitfulness of the great powers.\r\n\r\nHis nationalism did not go so far as to permit his endorsing the entrance\r\nof the People’s Republic of Outer Mongolia into the Soviet Union. This\r\ndoctrine of nationalism as a correlative of democratic national autonomy\r\nwas his second principle, that of democracy; his first principle, that of\r\nrace-nationalism, had other implications for the destiny of Mongolia. His\r\npositive program of nationalism was dedicated, in its “political”\r\nexercise, to the throwing-off of the imperialist bondage and the exercise\r\nof the self-rule of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nIt is only if one realizes that these three sub-principles of nationalism\r\nwere re-emphases of the three principles that their position in the theory\r\nof the nationalist program becomes clear. Nationalism was to clear the way\r\nfor _min shêng_ by resisting the Western economic oppression of the\r\nChinese, and thus allowing the Chinese to enrich themselves. Nationalism\r\nwas to strike down the political oppression of imperialism by eradicating\r\nthe political holds of the West upon China, and thus allowing the Chinese\r\npeople to rule itself. So long as China was at the mercy of Western power,\r\nany self-government that the Chinese might attempt would have to be\r\nessayed at the sufferance of the aggressors. Finally, nationalism was to\r\nreinforce itself by the application of race-nationalism to race-kinship;\r\nChina was not only to be self-ruling—it was to help the other nations of\r\nAsia restore their autonomy and shield them with its tutelary benevolence.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers that to Sun Yat-sen democracy and autonomy are\r\ninextricably associated, the full significance of his stressing\r\nnationalism as a means to democracy appears. The Chinese people could not\r\nrule themselves if they were to be intimidated by the Western powers and\r\nJapan. They could not rule themselves completely if large portions of them\r\nwere under alien jurisdiction in the treaty ports. These forms of\r\npolitical oppression were wounds in the body of Chinese society. Chinese\r\nnationalism, associated with democracy, required that the whole Chinese\r\npeople be associated in one race-nation and that this race-nation rule\r\nitself through the mechanism of a democratic state.\r\n\r\nHere the code of values imposed by Sun Yat-sen’s thinking in terms of the\r\nold ideology becomes apparent. The development of nationalism in China,\r\nwhile it threatened no one outside and sought only for the justification\r\nof China’s interests at home, was an accentuation of the existence of the\r\nrace-nation. The race-nation, freeing itself (political nationalism) and\r\nruling itself (democracy), was to become more conscious of itself. Sun\r\nimplicitly denied the immediate necessity for a general world-authority;\r\nperhaps he did so because he realized that in the present world, any\r\nsupreme authority would be predominantly Western. The Chinese race-nation,\r\nonce politically free, had a definite duty to perform on behalf of its\r\nperipheral states and on behalf of the suppressed states of the whole\r\nworld. The first demand, however, was for the freedom of China; others\r\ncould not be helped by China until China herself was free.\r\n\r\nThe political application of nationalism envisaged (1) the elimination of\r\nexisting foreign political control (imperialism) in China; (2) the\r\nstrengthening of the country to such a degree that it would no longer be a\r\nhypo-colony or sub-colony, and would not have to live under the constant\r\nthreat of invasion or partition; and (3) the resulting free exercise of\r\nself-rule by the Chinese people, through a nationalist democracy, so\r\narranged that self-rule of China did not conflict with the equal right of\r\nself-rule of other peoples but, on the contrary, helped them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Class War of the Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow come to a consideration of the second part of the sub-principle of\r\npolitical nationalism. This is the theory held by Sun concerning the class\r\nwar of the nations. It serves to illustrate three points in Sun Yat-sen’s\r\nthought: first, that Sun never permitted a Western theory to disturb the\r\nfundamentals of Chinese ideology as he wished to re-orient it; second,\r\nthat Sun frequently took Western political theories which had been\r\ndeveloped in connection with the relations of individuals and applied them\r\nto the relations of nations; and third, that Sun was so much impressed\r\nwith the cordiality and friendship proffered him by the Communists that he\r\nsought to coöperate with them so far as his Chinese ideology permitted\r\nhim.(255)\r\n\r\nOne notes that the question of distributive justice is not as pressing in\r\nChina as it is in the modern West. One also observes that the old Chinese\r\nideology was an ideology of the totalitarian society, which rejected any\r\nhigher allegiance of states or of classes. And one sees that Sun Yat-sen,\r\nin proposing a democracy, suggested an ideology which would continue the\r\nold Chinese thesis of eventual popular sovereignty as reconciled with\r\nadministration by an intellectually disciplined elite. Each of these three\r\npoints prevented Sun from endorsing the intra-national class struggle.\r\n\r\nHe regarded the class struggle, not—as do the Marxians—as a feature of\r\nevery kind of economically unequal social organization, but as a\r\npathological development to be found in disordered societies. He\r\nconsidered the Marxian teachings in this respect to be as different from\r\nreally adequate social doctrines as pathology is from physiology in\r\nmedical science. The mobility of the old Chinese society, combined with\r\nthe drags imposed by family, village, and _hui_, had resulted in a social\r\norder which by and large was remarkably just. By presenting the principle\r\nof _min shêng_ as a cardinal point in an ideology to be made up of old\r\nChinese morality, old Chinese knowledge, and Western science, he hoped to\r\navoid the evils of capitalism in the course of ethically sound enrichment,\r\ndevelopment and arrangement of China’s economy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Sun was faced with the spectre of imperialism, and had to\r\nrecognize that this unjust but effective alliance of economic exploitation\r\nand political subjection was an irreconcilable enemy to Chinese national\r\nfreedom. He saw in Russia an ally, and did not see it figuratively. Years\r\nof disappointment had taught him that altruism is rare in the\r\ninternational financial relations of the modern world. After seeking\r\neverywhere else, he found the Russians, as it were, on his door-step\r\noffering him help. This convinced him as no theory could have. He regarded\r\nRussia as a new kind of power, and ascribed the general hatred for the\r\nSoviet to their stand against capitalism and imperialism: “Then all the\r\ncountries of the world grew afraid of Russia. This fear of Russia, which\r\nthe different countries entertain at present, is more terrible than the\r\nfear they formerly held, because this policy of peace not only overthrew\r\nthe Russian imperialism, but (purposed) to overthrow also imperialism in\r\nthe (whole world).”(256) This fight against imperialism was a good work in\r\nthe mind of Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nIn considering the principles of Sun more than a decade after they were\r\npronounced, one cannot permit one’s own knowledge of the events of the\r\nlast eleven years to make one demand of Sun Yat-sen a similar background.\r\nThat would amount to requiring that he be a prophet. At the time when he\r\nspoke of the excellence of Russia he had no reason to question the good\r\nfaith of the Communists who were helping him. It is conceivable that even\r\nthe Bolsheviks who were aiding and advising the Nationalists did not\r\nrealize how soon the parting of the ways would come, how much the two\r\nideologies differed from one another, how much each of the two parties\r\nendangered the other’s position. At the time Sun spoke, the Communists\r\nwere his allies in the struggle against imperialism; they had agreed from\r\nthe beginning that China was a country not suited to communism; and Sun\r\nYat-sen, relying on them not to use him in some wider policy of theirs,\r\nhad no cause to mistrust or fear them. What has happened since is history.\r\nSun Yat-sen can scarcely be required to have predicted it. His comments on\r\nimperialism, therefore, must be accepted at face value in a consideration\r\nof the nationalist program in his theories.\r\n\r\nThe method by means of which Sun reconciled his denial of the superiority\r\nof class to nation is an interesting one, profoundly significant as a clue\r\nto the understanding of his thought. He estimates the population of the\r\nworld at 1500 million. Now, of this total 400 million are members of the\r\nwhite race, who constitute the most powerful and prosperous people in the\r\nmodern world. “This white race regards (its 400,000,000 representatives)\r\nas the unit which must swallow up the other, colored races. Thus the Red\r\ntribes of America have already been exterminated.... The Yellow Asiatic\r\nrace is now oppressed by the Whites, and it is possible that it will be\r\nexterminated before long.”(257) Thus, as Sun viewed it, imperialism before\r\nthe war was racial as well as economic. The White Peril was a reality.\r\nThis emphasis on the doctrine of race shows the emphasis that Sun put upon\r\nrace once he had narrowed down the old world-society to the Chinese\r\nrace-nation. The most vigorous _Rassenpolitiker_, such as Homer Lea or\r\nLothrop Stoddard,(258) would approve heartily of such a system of\r\ncalculation in politics. Sun Yat-sen differed with them, as he differed\r\nwith the Marxians, and with the race-theorists in general, by not\r\nfollowing any one Western absolute to the bitter end, whether it was the\r\nclass war or the race struggle.\r\n\r\nRussia fitted into this picture of race struggle. One hundred and fifty\r\nmillion Russians left the camp of the 400 million white oppressors, and\r\ncame over to the just side of the 1100 million members of oppressed\r\nnations. Consequently the figures came out somewhat more favorably for the\r\noppressed, in spite of the fact that the imperialist powers were still\r\neconomically and militarily supreme. Sun Yat-sen quoted an apocryphal\r\nremark of Lenin’s: “There are in the world two categories of people; one\r\nis composed of 1,250,000,000 men and the other of 250,000,000 men. These\r\n1,250,000,000 men are oppressed by the 250,000,000 men. The oppressors act\r\nagainst nature, and in defiance of her. We who oppose _might_ are\r\nfollowing her.”(259) Sun regarded the Russian Revolution as a shift in the\r\nrace-struggle, in which Russia had come over to the side of the oppressed\r\nnations. (He did, of course, refer to Germany as an oppressed nation at\r\nanother time, but did not include, so far as we can tell, the German\r\npopulation in the thesis under consideration.)\r\n\r\nOn this basis China was to join Russia in the class struggle of the\r\nnations. The struggle was to be between the oppressed and the oppressors\r\namong the nations, and not between the races, as it might have been had\r\nnot Russia come over to the cause of international equality.(260) After\r\nthe class struggle of the nations had been done with, the time for the\r\nconsideration of cosmopolitanism would have arrived.\r\n\r\nIn taking class lines in a scheme of nations, Sun was reconciling the\r\nrequirements of the old ideology and the international struggle against\r\nimperialism. It is characteristic of his deep adherence to what he\r\nbelieved to be the scheme of realities in political affairs that he did\r\nnot violate his own well-knit ideology in adopting the Marxian ideology\r\nfor the anti-imperialist struggle, but sought to preserve the marvellous\r\nunity of his own society—a society which he believed to have been the most\r\nnearly perfect of its time. The race-interpretation of the international\r\nclass struggle is at one and the same time an assertion of the natural and\r\nindestructible unity of Chinese society, and the recognition of the fact\r\nthat China and Russia, together with the smaller nations, had a common\r\ncause against the great advances of modern imperialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRacial Nationalism and Pan-Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dual orientation of Sun Yat-sen’s anti-imperialist programs has\r\nalready been made partly evident in the examination of this belief in a\r\nclass war of the nations. A much more nearly complete exposition of this\r\ndoctrine, although with the emphasis on its racial rather than on its\r\neconomic aspects, is to be found in the third sub-principle of the\r\nnationalist program: the race-national aspect of the national revolution.\r\nEach of the three principles was to contribute to this implementation of\r\nnationalism. _Min shêng_ was to provide the foundation for economic\r\nnationalism. Democracy was to follow and reinforce political nationalism,\r\nwhich would clear away the political imperialism and let the Chinese,\r\ninculcated with state-allegiance, really rule themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his life, even after he had delivered the sixteen lectures\r\non the three principles, Sun Yat-sen issued another call for the\r\nfulfillment in action of his principle of nationalism. This, too, praised\r\nRussia and stressed the significance of the defection of Russia from the\r\nband of the white oppressing powers; but it is important as showing the\r\nwider implications of Sun Yat-sen’s race-national doctrines. During the\r\ngreater part of his life, Sun spoke of the Chinese race-nation alone. His\r\nracial theory led him into no wider implications, such as the political\r\nreality of race kinship. In this last pronouncement, he recognized the\r\nwide sweep of consequences to which his premises of race-reality had led\r\nhim. This call was issued in his celebrated Pan-Asiatic Speech of November\r\n28, 1924, given in Kobe, Japan.(261)\r\n\r\nThe content of the speech is narrower than the configuration of auxiliary\r\ndoctrines which may be discussed in connection with it. These are: the\r\nrace orientation of the Chinese race-nation; the possibility of Pan-Asia;\r\nand the necessary function of the future Chinese society as the protector\r\nand teacher of Asia, and of the whole world. These points in his\r\ntheoretical program were still far in the future when he spoke of them,\r\nand consequently did not receive much attention. In the light of the\r\ndevelopments of the last several years, and the continued references to\r\nSun’s Pan-Asia which Japanese officials and propagandists have been\r\nmaking, this part of his program requires new attention.\r\n\r\nThe speech itself is a re-statement of the race-class war of the nations.\r\nHe points out that “It is contrary to justice and humanity that a minority\r\nof four hundred million should oppress a majority of nine hundred\r\nmillion....”(262) “The Europeans hold us Asiatics down through the power\r\nof their material accomplishments.”(263) He then goes on to stress the\r\nnecessity of emulating the material development of the West not in order\r\nto copy the West in politics and imperialism as well, but solely for the\r\npurpose of national defense. He praises Japan, Turkey, and the Soviet\r\nUnion as leaders of the oppressed class of nations and predicts that the\r\ntime will come when China will resume the position she once had of a great\r\nand benevolent power. He distinguishes, however, between the position of\r\nChina in the past and Great Britain and the United States in the present.\r\n“If we look back two thousand five hundred years, we see that China was\r\nthe most powerful people of the world. It then occupied the position which\r\nGreat Britain and the United States do today. But while Great Britain and\r\nthe United States today are only two of a series of world powers, China\r\nwas then the only world power.”(264) Sun also refers to the significant\r\nposition of Turkey and Japan as the two bulwarks of Asia, and emphasizes\r\nthe strangely just position of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn his earlier days Sun Yat-sen had been preoccupied with Chinese\r\nproblems, but not so much so as to prevent his taking a friendly interest\r\nin the nationalist revolutions of the Koreans against the Japanese, and\r\nthe Filipinos against the Americans. This interest seems to have been a\r\npersonally political one, rather than a preliminary to a definition of\r\npolicy. He said to the Filipinos: “Let us know one another and we shall\r\nlove each other more.”(265) The transformation of the ideology in China\r\ndid not necessarily lead to the development of outside affiliations. The\r\nConfucian world-society, becoming the Chinese race-nation, was to be\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nIn the development of his emphasis upon race kinship on the achievement of\r\nrace-nationalism, Sun Yat-sen initiated a program which may not be without\r\ngreat meaning in the furthering of the nationalist program. He showed that\r\nthe Chinese race-nation, having racial affinities with the other Asiatic\r\nnations, was bound to them nationally in policy in two ways: racially,\r\nand—as noted—anti-imperialistically. This theory would permit the Chinese\r\nto be drawn into a Pan-Asiatic movement as well as into an\r\nanti-imperialist struggle. This theory may now be used as a justification\r\nfor either alternative in the event of China’s having to choose aides in\r\nRusso-Japanese conflict. China is bound to Russia by the theory of the\r\nclass war of the nations, but could declare that Russia had merely devised\r\na new form for imperialism. China is bound to Japan by the common heritage\r\nof Asiatic blood and civilization, but could declare that Japan had gone\r\nover to the _pa tao_ side of Western imperialism, and prostituted herself\r\nto the status of another Westernized-imperialized aggressive power.\r\nWhatever the interpretations of this doctrine may be, it will afford the\r\nChinese a basis for their foreign policy based on the _San Min Chu I_.\r\n\r\nWhen Sun Yat-sen spoke, Russia and China had not fought over the Chinese\r\nEastern Railway and the Chinese Communist problem, nor had Japan and China\r\nentered into the Manchurian conflict. He was therefore in no position to\r\nsee that his expressions of approval for Pan-Asianism and for pro-Soviet\r\nforeign policy might conflict. In one breath he praised Japan as the\r\nleader and inspirer of modern Asia, and lauded Russia as the pioneer in a\r\nnew, just policy on the part of the Western powers. He saw little hope\r\nthat the example of the Soviet Union would be followed by any other\r\nWestern power, although he did state that there was “ ... in England and\r\nAmerica a small number of people, who defend these our ideals in harmony\r\nwith a general world movement. As far as the other barbarian nations are\r\nconcerned, there might be among them people who are inspired by the same\r\nconvictions.”(266) The possibility of finding allies in the West did not\r\nappear to be a great one to Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nSun did something in this speech which he had rarely hitherto done. He\r\ngeneralized about the whole character of the East, and included in that\r\neverything which the Westerners regarded as Eastern, from Turkey to Japan.\r\nWe have seen that the Chinese world of Eastern Asia had little in common\r\nwith the middle or near East. In this speech Sun accepted the Western idea\r\nof a related Orient and speaks of Asiatic ideals of kindliness and\r\njustice. This is most strange. “If we Asiatics struggle for the creation\r\nof a pan-Asiatic united front, we must consider ... on what fundamental\r\nconstitution we wish to erect this united front. We must lay at the\r\nfoundations whatever has been the special peculiarity of our Eastern\r\nculture; we must place our emphasis on moral value, on kindliness and\r\njustice.”(267) This Pan-Asian doctrine had been the topic of frequent\r\ndiscussion by Japanese and Russians. The former naturally saw it as a\r\ngreat resurgency of Asia under the glorious leadership of the Japanese\r\nThrone. The Russians found pan-Asianism to be a convenient instrument in\r\nthe national and colonial struggle against imperialism for communism.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen joined neither of these particular pan-Asiatic outlooks. The\r\nforeign policy of the Chinese race-nation was to fight oppressors, and to\r\njoin the rest of Asia in a struggle against white imperialist domination.\r\nBut—here is the distinction—how was China to do these things? Sun Yat-sen\r\nnever urged the Chinese to accept the leadership of the Western or\r\nJapanese states, however friendly they might be. China was to follow a\r\npolicy of friendship and coöperation with those powers which were friendly\r\nto her and to the cause of justice throughout the world. Sun praised the\r\nold system of Eastern Asia, by which the peripheral states stood in\r\nvassalage to China, a vassalage which he regarded as mutually voluntary\r\nand not imperialistic in the unpleasant sense of the word.\r\n\r\nIn the end, he believed Chinese society should resume the duty which it\r\nhad held for so many centuries in relation to its barbarian neighbors.\r\nChina should be rightly governed and should set a constant instance of\r\npolitical propriety. Sun even advocated ultimate intervention by the\r\nChinese, a policy of helping the weak and lifting up the fallen. He\r\nconcluded his sixth lecture on nationalism by saying: “If we want to\r\n‘govern the country rightly and pacify the world,’ we must, first of all,\r\nrestore our nationalism together with our national standing, and unify the\r\nworld on the basis of the morality and peach which are proper (to us), in\r\norder to achieve an ideal government.”(268)\r\n\r\nWe may conclude that his racial sub-principle in a program of nationalism\r\ninvolved: 1) orientation of Chinese foreign policy on the basis of blood\r\nkinship as well as on the basis of class war of the nations; 2) advocacy\r\nof a pan-Asiatic movement; and 3) use of China’s resurgence of national\r\npower to restore the benevolent hegemony which the Chinese had exercised\r\nover Eastern Asia, and possibly to extend it over the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Program of Nationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be worthwhile to attempt a view of the nationalist program of Sun\r\nYat-sen as a whole. The variety of materials covered, and the intricate\r\nsystem of cross-reference employed by Sun, make it difficult to summarize\r\nthis part of his doctrines on a simple temporal basis. The plans for the\r\nadvancement of the Chinese race-nation do not succeed each other in an\r\norderly pattern of future years, one stage following another. They mirror,\r\nrather, the deep conflict of forces in the mind of Sun, and bring to the\r\nsurface of his teachings some of the almost irreconcilable attitudes and\r\nprojects which he had to put together. In the ideological part of his\r\ndoctrines we do not find such contrasts; his ideology, a readjustment of\r\nthe ideology of old China, before the impact of the new world, to\r\nconditions developing after that impact, is fairly homogeneous and\r\nconsistent. It does not possess the rigid and iron-bound consistency\r\nrequired to meet the logic of the West; but, in a country not given to the\r\nfollowing of absolutes, it was as stable as it needed to be. His programs\r\ndo not display the same high level of consistency. They were derived from\r\nhis ideology, but, in being derived from it, they had to conform with the\r\nrealities of the revolutionary situation in words addressed to men in that\r\nsituation. As Wittfogel has said, the contradictions of the actual\r\nsituation in China were reflected in the words of Sun Yat-sen; Marxians,\r\nhowever, would suppose that these contradictions ran through the whole of\r\nthe ideology and plans. It may be found that in the old security\r\ntransmitted by Sun from the Confucian ideology to his own, there is little\r\ncontradiction; in his programs we shall find much more.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean, of course, that Sun Yat-sen planned things which were\r\ninherently incompatible with one another. What he did do was to advocate\r\ncourses of action which might possibly have all been carried out at the\r\nsame time, but which might much more probably present themselves as\r\nalternatives. His ardor in the cause of revolution, and his profound\r\nsincerity, frequently led him to over-assess the genuineness of the\r\ncordial protestations of others; he found it possible to praise Japan,\r\nTurkey, and the Soviet Union in the same speech, and to predict the\r\nharmonious combination, not only of the various Asiatic nationalisms with\r\neach other, but of all the nations of Asia with Western international\r\ncommunism. The advantage, therefore, of the present treatment, which seeks\r\nto dissever the ideology of Sun Yat-sen from his plans, may rest in large\r\npart upon the fact that the ideology, based in the almost timeless scheme\r\nof things in China, depended little upon the political situations of the\r\nmoment, while his plans, inextricably associated with the main currents of\r\nthe contemporary political situation, may have been invalidated as plans\r\nby the great political changes that occurred after his death. That is not\r\nto say, however, that his plans are no longer of importance. The Chinese\r\nnationalists may still refer to them for suggestions as to their general\r\ncourse of action, should they wish to remain orthodox to the teachings of\r\nSun. The plans also show how the ideology may be developed with reference\r\nto prevailing conditions.\r\n\r\nClearly, some changes in the plans will have to be made; some of the\r\nchanges which have been made are undoubtedly justified. Now that war\r\nbetween the Soviet Union and Japan has ceased to be improbable, it is\r\ndifficult to think of the coördination of a pan-Asiatic crusade with a\r\nworld struggle against imperialism. Chinese nationalists, no longer on\r\ngood terms with the Japanese—and on worse terms with the Communists—must\r\ndepend upon themselves and upon their own nation much more than Sun\r\nexpected. At the time of his death in 1925 the Japanese hostility to the\r\nKuomintang, which became so strikingly evident at Tsinanfu in 1928-9, and\r\nthe fundamental incompatibility of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party\r\nof China, had not manifested themselves. On the other hand, he could not\r\nhave foreseen that the imperialist nations, by no means cordial to the\r\nChinese Nationalists, would become as friendly to the Chinese nationalism\r\nas they have. The United States, for instance, while not acting positively\r\nagainst the political restrictions of Western imperialism (including its\r\nown) in China, has been friendly to the Nanking government, and as far as\r\na rigid policy of neutrality permitted it, took the side of China against\r\nJapan in the Manchurian conflict in and after 1931. Such developments\r\ncannot easily be reconciled to the letter of the plans of Sun Yat-sen,\r\nand, unless infallibility is expected of him, there is no reason why they\r\nshould.\r\n\r\nHis plans possess an interest far more than academic. It is not the\r\nprovince of this work to judge the degree to which the Nationalists\r\ncarried out the doctrines of Sun, nor to assess the relative positions of\r\nsuch leaders as Chiang Chieh-shih and Wang Ching-wei with respect to\r\northodoxy. The plans may be presented simply as a part of the theory of\r\nSun Yat-sen, and where there is possibility of disagreement, of his theory\r\nin its final and most authoritative stage: the sixteen lectures of 1924,\r\nand the other significant writings of the last years of his life.\r\n\r\nThe first part of his plans for China—those dealing with the applications\r\nof nationalism—may be more easily digested in outline form:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The Kuomintang was to be the instrument of the revolution.\r\n    Re-formed under the influence of the Communist advisers, it had\r\n    become a powerful weapon of agitation. It was, as will be seen in\r\n    the discussion of the plans for democracy, to become a governing\r\n    system as well. Its primary purpose was to carry out the\r\n    advancement of nationalism by the elimination of the _tuchuns_ and\r\n    other anti-national groups in China, and by an application of the\r\n    three principles, one by one, of the nationalist program.\r\n\r\n    2. The Kuomintang should foster the ideology of nationalism and\r\n    arouse the Chinese people to the precarious position of their\r\n    country. In order to make nationalism politically effective, state\r\n    allegiance had to supplant the old personal allegiance to the\r\n    Dragon Throne, or the personal allegiance to the neo-feudal\r\n    militarists.\r\n\r\n    3. Nationalism should be exerted economically, to develop the\r\n    country in accord with the ideology of _min shêng_ and to clear\r\n    away imperialist economic oppression which interfered with both\r\n    nationalism and _min shêng_.\r\n\r\n    4. Nationalism had to be exerted politically, for two ends:\r\n    Chinese democracy, and Chinese autonomy, which Sun often spoke of\r\n    as one. This had to be done by active political resistance to\r\n    aggression and by the advancement of a China state-ized and\r\n    democratic.\r\n\r\n    5. Nationalism had also to be exercised politically, in another\r\n    manner: in the class war of the nations. China should fight the\r\n    racial and economic oppression of the ruling white powers, in\r\n    common with the other oppressed nations and the one benevolent\r\n    white nation (Soviet Russia).\r\n\r\n    6. Nationalism had to reinforce itself through its racial\r\n    kinships. China had to help her fellow Asiatic nations, in a\r\n    pan-Asia movement, and restore justice to Asia and to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis recapitulation serves to show the curious developments of Sun\r\nYat-sen’s nationalist program. Originally based upon his ideology, then\r\ninfluenced by the race-orientation of a good deal of his political\r\nthought, and finally reconciled to the programmatic necessities of his\r\nCommunist allies, it is surprising not in its diversity but in its\r\nhomogeneity under the circumstances. This mixture of elements, which\r\nappears much more distinctly in Sun’s own words than it does in a\r\nrephrasing, led some Western students who dealt with Sun to believe that\r\nhis mind was a cauldron filled with a political witch-brew. If it is\r\nremembered that the points discussed were programmatic points, which\r\nchanged with the various political developments encountered by Sun and his\r\nfollowers, and not the fundamental premises of his thought and action\r\n(which remained surprisingly constant, as far as one can judge, throughout\r\nhis life), the inner consistency of Sun Yat-sen will appear. These plans\r\ncould not have endured under any circumstances, since they were set in a\r\nparticular time. The ideology may.\r\n\r\nIn turning from the nationalist to the democratic plans of Sun Yat-sen, we\r\nencounter a distinct change in the type of material. Orderly and precise\r\ninstead of chaotic and near-contradictory, the democratic plans of Sun\r\nYat-sen present a detailed scheme of government based squarely on his\r\ndemocratic ideology, and make no concessions to the politics of the\r\nmoment. Here his nationalism finds its clearest expression. The respective\r\nautonomies of the individual, the clan, the _hsien_ and the nation are\r\naccounted for; the nature of the democratic nationalist state becomes\r\nclear. Programmatically, it is the clearest, and, perhaps, the soundest,\r\npart of Sun’s work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE PROGRAMS OF DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Stages of Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s doctrine of the three stages of revolution attracted a\r\nconsiderable degree of attention. By the three stages of the revolution he\r\nmeant (1) the acquisition of political power by the teachers of the new\r\nideology (the revolution), (2) the teaching of the new ideology\r\n(tutelage), and (3) the practice of government by the people in accord\r\nwith the new ideology (constitutional democracy). Enough of Sun Yat-sen’s\r\nteaching concerning the new ideology has been shown to make clear that\r\nthis proposal is merely a logical extension of his doctrine of the three\r\nclasses of men.\r\n\r\nWestern writers who have acquainted themselves with the theory seem, in\r\nsome instances, inclined to identify it with the Marxist theory of the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat, into which the proletarian revolution is\r\nto be divided into three stages—the conquest of political power by the\r\nmasses; the dictatorship of the proletariat; and the inauguration (in the\r\nremote future) of the non-governmental class-less society.(269) It\r\nscarcely seems necessary to go so far afield to discover the origin of the\r\ntheory. As a matter of record, Sun Yat-sen made his earliest recorded\r\nannouncement of this theory in 1905, when he was not at all under the\r\ninfluence of Marxism, although he was acquainted with it.(270) Finally,\r\nthe theory forms so necessary a link between his theory of Kuomintang\r\ncontrol of the revolution, and his equally insistent demand for ultimate\r\ndemocracy, that it may be regarded as a logically necessary part of his\r\ncomplete plan. The coincidence between his and the Marxian theories would\r\nconsequently appear as a tribute to his acumen; this was the view that the\r\nCommunists took when they discovered that Sun Yat-sen was afraid of the\r\nweaknesses of immediate democracy in a country not fit for it.\r\n\r\nOne might also observe that, once the premise of revolution for a purpose\r\nis accepted, the three stages fit well into the scheme of age-old\r\ntraditional political thought advocated by the Confucians. Confucius did\r\nnot see the value of revolution, although he condoned it in specific\r\ninstances. He did, however, believe in tutelage and looked forward to an\r\nage when the ideology would have so impregnated the minds of men that _ta\r\nt’ung_ (the Confucian Utopia) would be reached, and, presumably,\r\ngovernment would become superfluous. That which Sun sought to achieve by\r\nrevolution—the placing of political power in the hands of the ideological\r\nreformers (or, in the case of the Marxist theory, the proletariat,\r\nactually the Communist party, its trustee)—Confucius sought, not by\r\nadvocating a general conspiracy of scholars for an oligarchy of the\r\nintellectuals, but the more peaceful method of urging princes to take the\r\nadvice of scholars in government, so that the ideology could be\r\nestablished (by the introduction of “correct names,” _chêng ming_) and\r\nideological control introduced.\r\n\r\nThe three stages of revolution may resemble Communist doctrine; they may\r\nhave been influenced by Confucian teaching; whatever their origin, they\r\nplay an extremely important part in the doctrines of Sun Yat-sen, and in\r\nthe politics springing from his principles. If the Kuomintang is the\r\ninstrument of the revolution, the three stages are its process. The\r\nclearest exposition of this theory of the three stages is found in _The\r\nFundamentals of National Reconstruction_, a manifesto which Sun Yat-sen\r\nissued in 1924:\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. The next element of reconstruction is democracy. To enable the\r\n    people to be competent in their knowledge of politics, the\r\n    government should undertake to train and guide them so that they\r\n    may know how to exercise their rights of election, recall,\r\n    initiative, and referendum....\r\n\r\n    5. The order of reconstruction is divided into three periods, viz.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Period of Military Operations;\r\n    (_b_) Period of Political Tutelage;\r\n    (_c_) Period of Constitutional Government.\r\n\r\n    6. During the period of military operations the entire country\r\n    should be subject to military rule. To hasten the unification of\r\n    the country, the Government to be controlled by the Kuomintang\r\n    should employ military force to conquer all opposition in the\r\n    country and propagate the principles of the Party so that the\r\n    people may be enlightened.\r\n\r\n    7. The period of political tutelage in a province should begin and\r\n    military rule should cease as soon as order within the province is\r\n    completely restored....\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to describe the method by which tutelage shall be applied,\r\nand when it should end. It should end, Sun declares, in each _hsien_\r\n(district; township) as the people of the _hsien_ become self-governing,\r\nthrough learning and practice in the democratic techniques. As soon as all\r\nthe _hsien_ within a province are self-governing, the provincial\r\ngovernment shall be released to democratic control.\r\n\r\n\r\n    23. When more than one half of the provinces in the country have\r\n    reached the constitutional government stage, _i. e._ more than one\r\n    half of the provinces have local self-government full established\r\n    in all their districts, there shall be a National Congress to\r\n    decide on the adoption and promulgation of the Constitution....\r\n\r\n    (_Signed_) SUN WEN\r\n\r\n    12th day, 4th month, 13th year of the Republic (April 12,\r\n    1924).(271)\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was emphatic about the necessity of a period of tutelage. The\r\ndismal farce of the first Republic in 1912, when the inexperience and\r\napathy of the people, coupled with the venality of the militarists and\r\npoliticians, very nearly discredited Chinese democracy, convinced Sun\r\nYat-sen that effective self-government could be built up only as the\r\ncitizens became ready for it. A considerable number of the disputes\r\nconcerning the theory of self-government to be employed by the\r\npolicy-making groups of the National (Kuomintang-controlled) Government\r\nhave centered on the point of criteria for self-government. Even with the\r\ninsertion of a transition stage, and with a certain amount of tutelage,\r\ndifficulties are being encountered in the application of this theory of\r\nthe introduction of constitutional government as soon as the people in a\r\n_hsien_ are prepared for it. Other considerations, military or political,\r\nmay make any venture beyond the secure confines of a benevolent Party\r\ndespotism dangerous; and the efficacy of tutelage can always be\r\nquestioned. The period of tutelage was set for 1930-1935; it is possible,\r\nhowever, that the three stages cannot be gone through as quickly as\r\npossible, since the Japanese invasions and the world economic depression\r\nexercised a thoroughly disturbing influence throughout the country.\r\n\r\nA final point may be made with regard to the three stages of the\r\nrevolution as Sun Yat-sen planned them. Always impetuous and optimistic in\r\nrevolutionary endeavor, Sun Yat-sen expected that the military conquest\r\nwould be rapid, the period of tutelage continue a few years, and\r\nconstitutional democracy endure for ages, until in the end _ta t’ung_\r\nshould reign upon earth. The transition period was not, as in the theory\r\nof the Confucians and the Marxians, an indefinite period beginning with\r\nthe present and leading on down to the age of the near-perfection of\r\nhumanity. It was to Sun Yat-sen, in his more concrete plans, an interval\r\nbetween the anarchy and tyranny of the warlord dictatorships and the\r\ncoming of Nationalist democracy. It was not a scheme of government in\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: Sun Yat-sen believed that revolution proceeded or should\r\nproceed by three stages—the (military) revolution proper; the period of\r\ntutelage; and the period of constitutional democracy. His theory resembles\r\nthe Communist, although it provides for a dictatorship of the patriotic\r\nelite (Kuomintang) and not of any one class such as the proletariat; it\r\nalso resembles the Confucian with respect to the concepts of tutelage and\r\neventual harmony. Military conquest was to yield swiftly to tutelage;\r\ntutelage was to lead, _hsien_ by _hsien_, into democracy. With the\r\nestablishment of democracy in more than one-half of the provinces,\r\nconstitutional government was to be inaugurated and the expedient of Party\r\ndictatorship dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThis theory, announced as early as 1905, Sun did not insist upon when the\r\nfirst Republic was proclaimed in 1912, with the tragic results which the\r\nhistory of that unfortunate experiment shows. In the experience derived\r\nfrom that great enthusiasm, Sun appreciated the necessity of knowledge\r\nbefore action. He was willing to defer the enjoyment of democracy until\r\nthe stability of the democratic idea in the minds of the people was such\r\nthat they could be entrusted with the familiar devices of Western\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a democratic organization did Sun Yat-sen propose to develop\r\nin China on the basis of his Nationalist and democratic ideology? Having\r\nestablished the fundamental ideas of national unity, and the national\r\nself-control, and having allowed for the necessity of an instrument of\r\nrevolution—the Kuomintang—and a process of revolution—the three stages,\r\nwhat mechanisms of government did Sun advocate to permit the people of\r\nChina to govern themselves in accord with the Three Principles?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adjustment of Democracy to China.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that, even with tutelage, the democratic techniques of the\r\nWest could impair the attainment of democracy in China were they applied\r\nin an unmodified form, and without concession to the ideological and\r\ninstitutional backgrounds of the Chinese. The Westerner need only\r\ncontemplate the political structure of the Roman Republic to realize how\r\nmuch this modern democracy is the peculiar institution of his race, bred\r\nin his bone and running, sacred and ancient, deep within his mind. The\r\nparticular methods of democracy, so peculiarly European, which the\r\nmodern—that is, Western or Westernized—world employs, is no less alien to\r\nthe imperial anarchy of traditional China than is the Papacy. Sun Yat-sen,\r\nbeholding the accomplishments of the West in practical matters, had few\r\nillusions about the excellence of democratic shibboleths, such as\r\nparliamentarism or liberty, and was profoundly concerned with effecting\r\nthe self-rule of the Chinese people without leading them into the\r\nlabyrinth of a strange and uncongenial political system.\r\n\r\nIn advocating democracy he did not necessarily advocate the adoption of\r\nstrange devices from the West. While believing, as we have seen, in the\r\nnecessity of the self-rule of the Chinese race-nation, he by no means\r\ndesired to take over the particular parliamentary forms which the West had\r\ndeveloped.(272) He criticised the weakness of Western political and social\r\nscience as contrasted with the strength of Western technology: “It would\r\nbe a gross error to believe that just as we imitate the material sciences\r\nof the foreigners, so we ought likewise to copy their politics. The\r\nmaterial civilization of the foreigners changes from day to day; we\r\nattempt to imitate it, and we find it difficult to keep step with it. But\r\nthere is a vast difference between the progress of foreign politics and\r\nthe progress of material civilization; the speed of (the first) is very\r\nslow.”(273) And he said later, in speaking of the democracy of the first\r\nRepublic: “China wanted to be in line with foreign countries and to\r\npractice democracy; accordingly she set up her representative government.\r\nBut China has not learned anything about the good sides of representative\r\ngovernments in Europe and in America, and as to the bad sides of these\r\ngovernments, they have increased tenfold, a hundredfold in China, even to\r\nthe point of making swine, filthy and corrupt, out of government\r\nrepresentatives, a thing which has not been witnessed in other countries\r\nsince the days of antiquity. This is truly a peculiar phenomenon of\r\nrepresentative government. Hence, China not only failed to learn well\r\nanything from the democratic governments of other countries, but she\r\nlearned evil practices from them.”(274) This farce-democracy was as bad as\r\nno government at all. Sun Yat-sen had to reject any suggestion that China\r\nimitate the example of some of the South American nations in borrowing the\r\nAmerican Constitution and proclaiming a “United States of China.” The\r\nproblem was not to be solved so easily.\r\n\r\nIn approaching Sun Yat-sen’s solution the Western student must again\r\nremember two quite important distinctions between the democracy of Sun\r\nYat-sen and the democracy of the West. Sun Yat-sen’s principle of _min\r\nch’üan_ was the self-control of the whole people first, and a government\r\nby the mass of individuals making up the people secondarily. The Chinese\r\nsocial system was well enough organized to permit the question of\r\ndemocracy to be a question of the nation as a whole, rather than a\r\nquestion of the reconciliation of particular interests within the nation.\r\nSpecial interests already found their outlet in the recognized social\r\npatterns—so reminiscent of the institutions envisaged by the pluralists—of\r\nthe ancient order. In the second place, China was already a society which\r\nwas highly organized socially, although politically in ruins; the\r\ndemocratic government that Sun Yat-sen planned had infinitely less\r\ngoverning to do than did Western governments. The new Nationalist\r\ngovernment had to fit into rather than supplant the old order. As a\r\nconsequence of these distinctions, one may expect to find much less\r\nemphasis on the exact methods of popular control of the government than\r\none would in a similar Western plan; and one must anticipate meeting the\r\nancient devices and offices which the usage of centuries had hallowed and\r\nmade true to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nOne may find that democracy in China is not so radical a novelty as it\r\nmight at first thought be esteemed. A figure of speech, which somewhat\r\nanticipates the exposition, may serve to prepare one for some of the\r\nseeming omissions of Sun Yat-sen’s plan for a democracy. The suggestion is\r\nthis: that the democracy of Sun Yat-sen is, roughly, a modernization of\r\nthe old Imperial system, with the Emperor (as the head of the academic\r\ncivil service) removed, and the majority placed in his stead. Neither in\r\nthe old system nor in the new were the minorities the object of profound\r\nconcern, for, to the Chinese, the notion of a minority (as against the\r\ngreater mass of the tradition-following people) is an odd one. The rule of\r\nthe Son of Heaven (so far as it was government at all) was to be replaced\r\nby the rule of the whole people (_min_, which is more similar to the\r\nGerman _Volk_ than the English _people_). The first Sun Yat-sen called\r\nmonarchy; the second, democracy.\r\n\r\nThe old ideology was to yield to the new, but even the new as a review of\r\nit has shown, was not broad enough completely to supplant the old. The\r\nessential continuity of Chinese civilization was not to be broken.\r\nDemocracy as a Western institution could be nothing more than a sham, as\r\nthe parliaments at Peking had showed; democracy in China had to be not\r\nonly democracy, but Chinese as well.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, extraordinarily strange to find the ancient\r\ninstitutions of the Empire surviving by the side of the most extreme\r\nmethods of popular government. The censorate and the referendum, the\r\nexamination system and the recall, all could work together in the\r\ndemocracy planned by Sun Yat-sen. Even with the idea of popular rule\r\nadopted in the formal Western manner, Sun Yat-sen proposed to continue the\r\nidea of natural and ineradicable class differences between men. The\r\nChinese democracy was not to be any mere imitation of the West; it was to\r\nbe the fundamentally new fusion of Chinese and Western methods, and\r\noffered as the solution for the political readjustment of the Chinese\r\nsociety in a world no longer safe for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Four Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen divided all men into three categories: the geniuses, the\r\nfollowers, and the unthinking. To reconcile this theory of natural\r\ninequality with democracy, he distinguished between _ch’üan_, the right to\r\nrule as sovereign, and _nêng_, the right to administer as an official. He\r\nfurthermore considered the state similar to a machine. How should the\r\nunthinking, who would possess _ch’üan_, the right to rule, be granted that\r\nright without attempting to usurp _nêng_?\r\n\r\nThis was to be accomplished by two means. The Four Powers were to be given\r\nto the people, in order to assure their possession of _ch’üan_. The Five\r\nRights were to assure that the government might be protected in its right\r\nto _nêng_, in its right to have only the most competent officials.\r\nTogether the Four Powers and the Five Rights implement a scheme of\r\ngovernment so novel that Sun Yat-sen himself believed it to be a definite\r\ncontribution to political method. The learned Jesuit translator of the\r\n_San Min Chin I_ does not even term it democracy, but neo-democracy\r\ninstead.(275)\r\n\r\nThe Four Powers represent an almost extreme limit of popular control. Sun\r\nYat-sen divided the four into two groups: the first two are powers of the\r\npeople over the administrators—the power of election and the power of\r\nrecall; the second two are powers of the people over the laws—the power of\r\ninitiative and the power of referendum. Having secured the government from\r\nundue interference, Sun Yat-sen had no reluctance in giving these powers\r\nto the people. He said: “As for our China, since she had no old democratic\r\nsystem, she ought to be able to make very good use of this most recent and\r\nexcellent invention.”(276)\r\n\r\nThese four powers are perhaps the most Western element in the whole theory\r\nof Sun. History does not record the technique by which the Chinese chose\r\nYao to be their Emperor, and even where actions comparable to elections\r\nwere performed, it was not by use of the ballot-box or the voting machine,\r\nor drilling on an appointed field. The Chinese way of getting things done\r\nnever tended that much to formality. A man who wanted to be a village head\r\nmight be quietly chosen head by a cabal of the most influential persons,\r\nor at a meeting of many of the villagers. He might even decide to be head,\r\nand act as head, in the hope that people would pay attention to him and\r\nthink that he was head. The Four Powers represent a distinct innovation in\r\nChinese politics for, apart from a few ridiculous comic-opera performances\r\nunder the first Republic, and the spurious plebiscite on the attempted\r\nusurpation of Yüan Shih-k’ai, the voting method has been a technique\r\nunknown in China. It is distinctly Western.\r\n\r\nAnother distinction may be made with a certain degree of reservation and\r\nhesitancy. It is this: the Chinese, without the elaborate system of\r\nexpedient fictions which the West terms juristic law, were and are unable\r\nto conceive of corporate action. A law passed by the Peking parliament was\r\nnot passed by the dictator in parliament, or the people in parliament; it\r\nwas simply passed by parliament, and was parliament’s responsibility. The\r\nonly kind of law that the people could pass would be one upon which they\r\nthemselves had voted.\r\n\r\nSeen in this light, the Four Powers assume a further significance greater\r\nthan the Western political scientist might attribute to them. In America\r\nthere is little difference between a law which the people of Oregon pass\r\nin the legislature, and one which they pass in a referendum. To the\r\nChinese there is all the difference in the world. The one is an act of the\r\ngovernment, and not of the people; the other, the act of the people, and\r\nnot of the government. The people may have powers over the government, but\r\nnever, by the wildest swing of imagination, can they discover themselves\r\npersonified in it. A Chinese democracy is almost a dyarchy of majority and\r\nofficialdom, the one revising and checking the other.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not comment on the frequency with which he expected these\r\npowers to be exercised, nor has the political development of democratic\r\nChina gone far enough to afford any test of experience; it is consequently\r\nimpossible to state whether these powers were to be, or shall be,\r\nexercised constantly as a matter of course, or whether they shall be\r\nemployed by the people only as courses for emergency action, when the\r\ngovernment arouses their displeasure. The latter seems the more probable,\r\nin view of the background of Chinese tradition, and the strong\r\npropensities of the Chinese to avoid getting involved in anything which\r\ndoes not concern them immediately and personally. This probability is made\r\nthe more plausible by the self-corrective devices in the governmental\r\nsystem, which may seem to imply that an extensive use of the popular\r\ncorrective power was not contemplated by Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now we separate power from capacity and we say _that the people\r\n    are the engineers and the government is the machine_. On the one\r\n    hand, we want the machinery of the government to be all-powerful,\r\n    able to do anything, and on the other hand we want the engineer,\r\n    the people, to have great power so as to be able to control that\r\n    all-powerful machine.\r\n\r\n    But what must be the mutual rights of the people and of the\r\n    government in order that they might balance? We have just\r\n    explained that. On the people’s side there should be the four\r\n    rights of _election_, _recall_, _initiative_, and _referendum_. On\r\n    the government’s side there must be five powers.... If the four\r\n    governing powers of the people control the five administrative\r\n    powers of the government, then we shall have _a perfect\r\n    political-democratic machine_....(277)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Five Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen implemented his theory of democracy by assigning Four Powers\r\nto the people and Five Rights to the government. This latter doctrine is\r\none of the most disputed points in his proposal. Some writers see in it\r\nnothing more than a crass conjunction of the theory of Montesquieu and the\r\npractices of the Chinese Imperial system.(278) His followers are disposed\r\nto regard the doctrine of the Five Rights as the product of intrepid\r\nimagination, which succeeded in reconciling the traditional scheme of\r\nChinese things with the requirements of modern self-government.\r\n\r\nSun made the point that both Chinese and Western governments had in the\r\npast had tripartite governments. He illustrated this by a diagram:(279)\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONSTITUTION OF CHINA\r\n\r\n    The Examining Power (_Kao Shih ch’üan_)\r\n    The Imperial Power (_Chun ch’üan_)\r\n      The Legislative Power\r\n      The Executive Power\r\n      The Judicial Power\r\n    The Power to Impeach (_Tan k’ê ch’üan_)\r\n\r\n    FOREIGN CONSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n    The Legislative Power combined with the Power to Impeach\r\n    The Executive Power combined with the Examining Power\r\n    The Judicial Power\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen believed that in separating the Five Rights from one another\r\nhe would make clear certain differentiations of function which had led to\r\nnumberless disputes in the past, and would present to the world a model\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThus far, the Five Rights seem the complement of the Four Powers. The two\r\nsets of controls, of people over the government, and of the government\r\nover the people, assure China that a neo-democratic administration will\r\nhave no less continuity and power than did its Imperial predecessor, and\r\nnevertheless be subject to the will of the majority of the four hundred\r\nodd million sovereigns. Contemplated in this manner, the Five Rights are\r\nan amalgamation of the Western theory upon the Chinese, and significant as\r\na novelty in democratic administrative theory rather than as institutions\r\naltering the fundamental premises and methods of democracy.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a further step is taken, and the Five Powers are associated\r\nwith Sun Yat-sen’s doctrine of the three naturally unequal classes of men,\r\nthey assume a somewhat less superficial significance. If the rule of the\r\npeople is placed over the administration by the geniuses, the geniuses\r\nmust be assured a method of entering the government service. The oligarchy\r\nof the intellectuals is to be reconciled with the dictatorship of the\r\nmajority. The old Chinese system of a trained class of scholars, entrance\r\nto which was open on a competitive system to members of almost all classes\r\nof society, had to be preserved in the new China, and at the same time\r\ndisciplined and purified of unworthy or unsuitable elements, while\r\nsimultaneously subject to the policy-making authority of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of a leader class was to be assured by an examination\r\ndivision in the new democratic government, and its purification and\r\ndiscipline continued by a supervisory or censoring division. The\r\nadministrative setup of the nationalist democracy would appear as follows,\r\nwhen the present official translations of the Chinese names for the\r\ndivisions (_Yuan_) are adopted:\r\n\r\n   1. The division of the executive (Executive Yuan).\r\n   2. The division of the legislative (Legislative Yuan).\r\n   3. The division of the judicial (Judicial Yuan).\r\n   4. The division of censorship, impeachment and accounting (Control\r\n      Yuan).\r\n   5. And the division of the examination system (Examination Yuan).\r\n\r\nIt is an illustration of the further difference between the democracy of\r\nSun Yat-sen and Western democracy, that each of the divisions, even the\r\nlegislative, was to have a single head. The whole government was to be\r\ndepartmentally, not camerally, organized.\r\n\r\nThe system of Five Powers emphasizes the implied dyarchy of government and\r\npeople in the _San Min Chu I_ by assigning to the government itself\r\nfunctions which, in the usual course of events, are supposed to be\r\nexercised by the people themselves in Western democracies. The people are\r\nsupposed to eliminate unfit officials and decide on the merits and\r\ntrustworthiness of incumbents. By the expedient of non-reëlection, the\r\npeople are supposed to remove officials, who are incapable or unsuitable\r\nfor public office. The two functions have been taken over by the\r\nExamination and Control Yuans, respectively; the Four Powers of the people\r\nare not, in all probability, instruments for continual popular intrigue\r\nand meddling in government, but almost revolutionary implements for\r\nshifting the course or composition of the government.\r\n\r\nThe Five Rights are instruments for the self-government of the official\r\nclass (Examination and Control), and for the government of the people by\r\nthe official class (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial). The Four Powers\r\nare the instruments for the government of the official class by the\r\npeople. Out of the checks and balances of government and people the\r\nintegrity, efficacy, and stability of Sun Yat-sen’s democracy was to be\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of the Four Rights of the people could, in the theory of Sun\r\nYat-sen, be used to check the development of an arrogant, inefficient or\r\nirresponsible bureaucracy, in that the people would assist in the\r\nselection of officials and would be able to remove incompetents at any\r\ntime. The civil service mechanism of the government would, on the other\r\nhand, resist the too free play of popular caprice. No incompetent person\r\nwould be elected to office, since the civil service would extend even to\r\nelective offices. The voters could remove a bad official but they could\r\nnot replace him with an untrained person; they would have to select their\r\ncandidate from the roster of scholar-officials eligible for the rank of\r\nthe office in question. The people were to supervise the operations of the\r\nage-old Chinese civil service, as revivified by the nationalists; they\r\nwere to appoint and remove officers, to repeal and enact laws; but in no\r\ncase were they to tear down the structure of the civil service and\r\ninaugurate a spoils democracy such as that found in the United States.\r\nThis blending of extreme democracy and traditional administrative\r\nhierarchy would result, said Sun Yat-sen, in perfect government.\r\n\r\nThe democratic nationalist government was to supersede the Empire. In\r\nbetween there was no central government, since the various military\r\nleaders paid scant respect to the unfortunate clique of diplomats and\r\nofficials who carried on the few functions left to the powerless Peking\r\ngovernment.(280) The new government was not, therefore, so much a new\r\npolitical order to be set up in place of the old as a political order to\r\nbe built up out of military chaos. The social system, although shaken and\r\naffected by Western ideas, continued much as usual, and was to be woven\r\ninto the new socio-political patterns that Sun Yat-sen projected.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist government was to be the nation’s answer to the foreign\r\naggression. The White Peril, which had flooded Asia, could only be held\r\nback by the dykes of a militant nationalist movement, expressing itself in\r\na formal state such as the Westerners themselves had developed, and which\r\nfitted them to undertake the conquest of the world. This government was to\r\nbe the agent of the whole Chinese people who, casting off the oppression\r\nof the militarists and the imperialists, was to rise again with its\r\nancient power, formidable and ready to fight if necessary, more ready to\r\nbring about world-coöperation and peace if possible. It was to be a\r\ngovernment made up of a trained officialdom such as ancient China had\r\npossessed for centuries, which had led to the integration of control and\r\nculture (in the narrowest sense of the word), and of a people ruling by\r\nchecking that officialdom: an all-powerful state-machine ruled by an\r\nall-powerful people.(281) A state was to appear in the world of states and\r\nenclose the Chinese people, by political power, more effectively than\r\ncould the Great Wall.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of democracy, the self-rule of the Chinese society _vis-à-vis_\r\nthe linked despotism of militarists, renegades and imperialists, was,\r\nalthough the most important facet of democracy, not the whole story. In\r\norder to systematize the loose democracy of old China, in order to lead\r\nall force to the top, where it could be exerted outwards, the democratic\r\nplan had to plan links with the traditional system. The government could\r\nnot be democratic if it were not tied to the people. The people could not\r\ngovern themselves, as apart from governing the officialdom making up the\r\nNational government, unless they had mechanisms with which to do so.\r\nAlthough the family, the _hui_ and the _hsien_ provided self-government,\r\nthis self-government had to be associated with the scheme of nationalist\r\nand national self-government in order to guarantee the latter’s\r\neffectiveness. Beyond or beneath the national democracy of China there was\r\nto be a system of democracy (the politicalization, as it were, of the old\r\nsocial organs) running through society. What these separate or subordinate\r\norgans were to be, what relations they were to have with the national\r\ngovernment, and what other intermediate institutions were to facilitate\r\nthose relations must be studied to gain a complete picture of the\r\ndemocracy of Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfederacy Versus Centralism.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most involved questions in the political thought of the Chinese\r\nrevolution has been the problem of provincial autonomy. The Chinese\r\nprovinces differ considerably more from one another in economic\r\nconditions, language and race than do the American states; it has been\r\nsaid that one of the causes of the overthrow of the Manchu monarchy was\r\nthe encroachment of the Imperial central power, in its last desperate\r\nattempts to modernize itself and cope with the last crisis, upon the old\r\nautonomy of the provinces.(282) Institutionally, the provinces were\r\nrelatively independent; this degree of independence was, however,\r\nminimized by the general unimportance of government in Chinese society.\r\nThe Chinese, toward each other, feel conscious of family, village and\r\nprovincial ties; face to face with the foreigners, they are beginning to\r\nknow themselves as Chinese. Until the wave of nationalism swept the\r\ncountry, provincial rivalry was a live issue; even today, it cannot be\r\ncalled forgotten.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s opinions on many points of government remained stable\r\nthrough his life. The fundamental ideas and ideals seem to have been\r\nexpanded, rather than changed, as his theory met the test of his growing\r\nexperience and the lessons of the revolution; but even with expansion,\r\nthey remain, for the most part, consistent. Sun Yat-sen was steadfast in\r\nhis beliefs.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be said of his and his successors’ opinions on the problem of\r\nprovince versus nation. There is no one doctrine dealing with the question\r\nof provincial autonomy. There may be a trend, however, which can be\r\ndescribed as a swing from definite emphasis upon the province toward\r\nneglect of that unit of administration. This trend may be illustrated by\r\nseveral points.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the first Republic the provinces were treated much as are\r\nstates in the United States. The members of the Senate of the Republic\r\n(_Ts’an Yi Yuan_) were to be elected by the Assemblies of the provinces,\r\nand, when representing persons not under the jurisdiction of a provincial\r\nAssembly, by Electoral Colleges. The House of Representatives was to be\r\nelected directly by the people, in the proportion of one member to each\r\neight hundred thousand of population, with the reservation—again in\r\npropitiation of provincial vanity—that no province should have less than\r\nten representatives.(283) The first Republic was distinctly federal\r\nalthough by no means confederate.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen did not immediately shift from this position. As late as\r\n1919-1922, when he was preparing his official biography, he spoke\r\nenthusiastically to his biographer of the potentialities of democratic\r\nprovincial home rule.(284) He still believed in the importance of the\r\nprovinces as units of a future democracy in China.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Sun went South, and the Kuomintang was reorganized, to\r\nthe present, the tendency in the Sun-Kuomintang theory seems to have been\r\ntoward minimization of the importance of the provinces in the democracy to\r\nbe set up. The Party Declaration of the Kuomintang at its First National\r\nConvention in 1924 in Canton criticised several political viewpoints\r\nprevalent; among these was that of the Confederalists, so called. The\r\nDeclaration states, in part: “Undoubtedly regional self-government is in\r\nentire accord with the spirit of democracy and is a great need of our\r\nnation. But a true regional self-government can be realized only when our\r\nnational independence is won, for without national freedom, local freedom\r\nis impossible.... Many social, economic and political problems facing the\r\nindividual provinces can be solved only by the nation as a whole. So the\r\nsuccess of the peoples’ revolution is a prerequisite to the realization of\r\nprovincial autonomy.”(285)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen himself stated, a few months earlier, a point of view which\r\nmay seem inconsistent with the Party Declaration:\r\n\r\n\r\n    18. The _Hsien_ is the unit of self-government. The province links\r\n    up and provides means of co-operation between the Central\r\n    Government and the local governments of the districts.(286)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever the occasion for the slight difference of opinion, it has been\r\nthe policy of the Kuomintang to emphasize _hsien_ rather than provinces as\r\nunits of self-government. The Party itself is quite centralized. The\r\nResumé of the Kuomintang Third National Congress Resolutions Concerning\r\nPolitical Matters, adopted March 27, 1929, states unequivocally: “The\r\ntraditional policy of attaching greater importance to provincial\r\ngovernment than to _Hsien_ or district government must be corrected or\r\neven reversed.” It adds, “The provincial government, on the other hand,\r\nshall act only as a supervisor of local self-government, standing in\r\nbetween the _Hsien_ or district government on the one hand, and the\r\nCentral Government on the other.”(287)\r\n\r\nThe province is thus reduced to the lowest possible level. It is not\r\nprobable that this tendency was influenced by Marxism, but it certainly\r\nresembled the Marxian idea of a vast confederation of self-governing\r\ncommunes, acting, by some proletarian metempsychosis, as a highly\r\ncentralized instrument of revolution.(288) The doctrine of the\r\n_hsien_-province-nation relationship which places emphasis upon the first\r\nand the last is the authoritative one, and is quite harmonious with the\r\nearlier picture of Imperial China which, apart from the strictly\r\ngovernmental, was a vast confederacy of largely autonomous communities. In\r\nthe picture of the new democratic national government which emerges from\r\nthis doctrine, the central government may be regarded as a centralism\r\nversus the provinces, and a super-government in relation to the _hsien_;\r\nthat is, while the people govern themselves as groups in the _hsien_, they\r\nwill govern themselves as one people in the National Government. The\r\nprovince will remain as a convenient intermediary between the two.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few doctrines of Sun Yat-sen upon which no one\r\ndefinitive and final pronouncement is to be found and concerning which,\r\nconsequently, recourse must be had to the history of the development of\r\nthe Sun Yat-sen political philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Hsien_ in a Democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _hsien_, or district, was one of the most important social\r\ninstitutions in old China. The lowest official, the _hsien_ Magistrate,\r\nrepresented the Empire to the people of the _hsien_, while within the\r\nvillages or the _hsien_ the people enjoyed a very high degree of autonomy.\r\nThe _hsien_ was the meeting point of the political system and the\r\nextra-legal government, generally of a very vaguely organized nature, by\r\nwhich the Chinese managed their own affairs in accord with tradition. An\r\nestimate of the position of the _hsien_ may be gleaned from the fact that\r\nChina has approximately four hundred eighty million inhabitants; apart\r\nfrom the cities and towns, there are about half a million villages; and\r\nthe whole country, with the exception of certain Special Municipalities,\r\nsuch as Shanghai, is divided into nineteen hundred and forty-three\r\n_hsien_.(289)\r\n\r\nThe _hsien_, however significant they may be in the social system of\r\nChina, both past and present, cannot be described in a work such as this.\r\nIt is not inappropriate, however, to reiterate that they form what is\r\nperhaps the most important grouping within China, and that much of Chinese\r\nlife is centred in _hsien_ affairs. It is by reason of _hsien_ autonomy\r\nthat the Chinese social system has been so elastic as to permit the shocks\r\nof invasion, insurrection, conquest, famine and flood to pass through and\r\nover China without disrupting Chinese social organization.\r\n\r\nSun once quoted the old Chinese proverb about the Lu Shan (mountains): “We\r\ncannot find the real shape of the Lu Shan—for we ourselves are on it.”\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the Western reader this proverb could be turned\r\nagainst Sun in his treatment of the _hsien_. He was passionately emphatic\r\nin discussing the importance of the _hsien_ with his foreign friends;(290)\r\nin his writings, addressed to his countrymen, he, as they, simply assumed\r\nthe importance of the _hsien_ without troubling to make any cardinal point\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe _hsien_ is in the unit of the most direct self-government of the\r\npeople, without the interference of any elaborate set-up from officialdom.\r\nApart from its age-old importance, it will gain further significance in\r\nthe democracy of Sun Yat-sen.\r\n\r\nSome of the functions to be assigned to the people in a _hsien_ are\r\nassessment, registration, taxation, and/or purchase of all lands in the\r\n_hsien_; the collection of all unearned increment on lands within the\r\n_hsien_; land profits to be subjected to collection by the _hsien_, and\r\ndisbursement for public improvements, charitable work, or other public\r\nservice. Add this to the fact that the _hsien_ have been the chief\r\nagencies for police, health, charity, religious activity and the\r\nregulative control of custom—sometimes with the assistance of\r\npersons—through the centuries, and the great importance of the _hsien_ in\r\nthe nationalist democracy becomes more clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Family System.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen’s democracy differs further from the parliamentary, mechanical\r\ndemocracy of the West in that it incorporates the family system.(291) Of\r\ncourse Sun understood the extraordinary part that the family plays in\r\nChina—a part more conspicuous, perhaps, than in any other country. He\r\npointed out that the family required in China much of the loyalty which in\r\nthe West is given to the state. “Among the Chinese people the family and\r\nkinship ties are very strong. Not infrequently the people sacrifice their\r\nlives and homes for some affair of kinship; for instance, in Kuangtung,\r\ntwo clans may fight regardless of life and property. On the other hand,\r\nour people hesitate to sacrifice themselves for a national cause. The\r\nspirit of unity has not extended beyond the family and clan\r\nrelationships.”(292)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the early Emperors and the revolution, he said: “You see,\r\ngentlemen, the methodology of Yao, like that of ours, was to begin his\r\nmoral and political teachings with the family, then the nation-group, then\r\nthe world.”(293) How did Sun Yat-sen propose to join the strength of the\r\nfamily spirit and of nationalism, to the common advantage?\r\n\r\nHe planned to reorganize the already existing clan organizations in each\r\ndistrict. These organizations have existed from time immemorial for the\r\npurposes of preserving clan unity, commemorating clan ancestry, performing\r\ncharitable functions, and acting as a focus—although this last was not an\r\navowed purpose—for clan defense. The reorganization which Sun proposed\r\nwould probably have involved some systematizing of the organization for\r\nthe purposes of uniformity and official record, as well as effectiveness.\r\n\r\nOnce the district headquarters were reorganized, they could be combined\r\nthroughout a province into a provincial clan organization. Such\r\norganizations already exist, but they are neither systematic nor general.\r\nAfter the clan was organized on a provincial basis throughout the\r\nprovinces, the various provincial organizations could be gathered together\r\nin a national clan organization.\r\n\r\nIt is only when one contemplates the strength of the family system in\r\nChina that the boldness of this plan becomes apparent. A series of vast\r\nnational clan organizations would include practically every Chinese. Not\r\ncontent with this, Sun proposed inter-clan organizations, certain clans\r\nbeing more related to one another. A further series of national inter-clan\r\norganizations would draw together the allegiance of numberless\r\nindividuals. There was always the possibility that a convention of all the\r\nclans might be called—although Sun was not sanguine about this last.(294)\r\n\r\nThis methodology, according to Sun Yat-sen, would automatically bring\r\nabout nationalism. The Chinese people were already vigorously attached to\r\ntheir families and clans. A union of all the families and clans would lead\r\nthe Chinese to realize that they were one people—one enormous family, as\r\nit were—and cause them to join together as a nation. Since there are only\r\nabout four hundred surnames in China, the alliance of the clans was not so\r\nfar-fetched a suggestion as it might seem. Some clans have a membership\r\nrunning into the millions, and clan spirit is so great that, in spite of\r\nthe absence of legislation, the Chinese marriage system is still largely\r\nexogamic on this clan basis.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of clan organization is relevant to Sun Yat-sen’s\r\ndemocracy, in that the clan was one of the democratizing influences in old\r\nChina. An individual who failed to exert appreciable pressure on the\r\ngovernment, or on some other group, might appeal to his clan for\r\nassistance. The Chinese record of relationships was kept so extensively\r\nthat there were few men of wealth or power who did not have their kinsmen\r\ncommanding their assistance. The non-political authority of the family\r\nsystem controlled many things which have been within the scope of the\r\npolice power in the West, and the adjustments of society and the\r\nindividual were frequently mitigated in their harshness by the entrance of\r\nthe clan upon the scene. A stable Chinese democracy with a clan system\r\nwould be remarkably like the traditional system. The recourse of political\r\ndemocracy would have been added, but the familiar methods of political\r\npressure upwards through the clan to the government might, not\r\ninconceivably, prove the more efficacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE PROGRAMS OF _MIN SHÊNG_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Programs of _Min Shêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new ideology of Sun Yat-sen, as has been shown, demanded three\r\nfulfilments of the doctrine of _min shêng_: a nationalistic economic\r\nrevolution, a deliberate industrial revolution, and a social revolution.\r\nThe last was to be accomplished negatively rather than positively. It was\r\nto aim at the reconstruction of the Chinese economy in such a manner as to\r\navoid the necessity of class war. Since Chinese society was to be\r\nrevolutionized by the development of a nation and a state, with all that\r\nthat implied, and was to be changed by a transition from a handicraft\r\neconomy to an industrial one, Sun Yat-sen hoped that these changes would\r\npermit the social revolution to develop at the same time as the others,\r\nand did not plan for it separately and distinctly. The three revolutions,\r\nall of them economic, were to develop simultaneously, and all together\r\nwere to form a third of the process of readjustment.\r\n\r\nIn considering the actual plans for carrying out the _min shêng_\r\nprinciple, the student encounters difficulties. The general philosophical\r\nposition of the _min shêng_ ideology in relation to the ideologies of\r\nnationalism and democracy, and in connection with such foreign\r\nphilosophies as capitalism and Marxism, has already been set forth. The\r\ndirect plans that Sun Yat-sen had for the industrial revolution in China\r\nare also clear, since he outlined them, laboriously although tentatively,\r\nin _The International Development of China_;(295) but whereas the ideology\r\nand the actual physical blueprints can be understood clearly enough, the\r\ngeneral lines of practical governmental policy with regard to economic\r\nmatters have not been formulated in such a way as to make them\r\nindisputable.\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen was averse to tying the hands of his followers and successors\r\nwith respect to economic policy. He said: “While there are many\r\nundertakings which can be conducted by the State with advantage, others\r\ncannot be conducted effectively except under competition. I have no\r\nhard-and-fast dogma. Much must be left to the lessons of experience.”(296)\r\n\r\nIt would be inexpedient to go into details about railway lines and other\r\nmodern industrial enterprises by means of which Sun sought to modernize\r\nChina. On the other hand, it would be a waste of time merely to repeat the\r\nmain economic theses of the new ideology. Accordingly, the examination of\r\nthe program of _min shêng_ will be restricted to the consideration of\r\nthose features that affected the state, either directly or indirectly, or\r\nwhich had an important bearing upon the proposed future social\r\norganization of the Chinese. Among the topics to be discussed are the\r\npolitical nature of the national economic revolution, the political effect\r\nof the industrial revolution upon the Chinese, and the expediency of Sun’s\r\nplans for that revolution; the nature of the social revolution which was\r\nto accompany these two first, especially with reference to the problem of\r\nland, the problem of capital, and the problem of the class struggle; the\r\nsphere of state action in the new economy; and the nature of that ideal\r\neconomy which would be realized when the Chinese should have carried to\r\ncompletion the programs of _min shêng_. Railway maps and other designs of\r\nSun, which have proved such an inspiration in the modernization of China\r\nand which represent a pioneer attempt in state planning, will have to be\r\nleft to the consideration of the economists and the geographers.(297)\r\n\r\nThe program of _min shêng_ was vitally important to the realization of the\r\nNationalist revolution as a whole, so important, indeed, that Sun Yat-sen\r\nput it first in one of his plans:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first step in reconstruction is to promote the economic\r\n    well-being of the people by providing for their four necessities\r\n    of life, namely, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. For\r\n    this purpose, the Government will, with the people’s co-operation,\r\n    develop agriculture to give the people an adequate food supply,\r\n    promote textile industries to solve their clothing problem,\r\n    institute gigantic housing schemes to provide for them decent\r\n    living quarters, and build roads and canals so that they may have\r\n    convenient means of travel.\r\n\r\n    Next is the promotion of democracy....\r\n\r\n    The third step is the development of nationalism....(298)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plans for realizing _min shêng_ were to be the most necessary and the\r\nmost difficult. In the change from a world-society to a race-nation, the\r\nChinese had their own social solidarity and the experience of the Western\r\nnations to guide them. There was little in the development of a nation\r\nthat had not already been tried elsewhere. The only real obstacles were\r\nthe ignorance of the people, in relation to the new social environment in\r\nwhich their whole society was involved, and the possibility of opposition\r\nfrom the politically oppressing powers.\r\n\r\nIn the development of democracy the Chinese could rely in part upon the\r\nexperience of the West. The Kuomintang could observe the machinery of\r\ndemocratic states in regular operation abroad. Although the new democracy\r\nof the five powers and the four rights was differed from the democratic\r\nmethods of the West, still, as in mechanics, certain fundamental rules of\r\npolitical organization in its technical details could be relied upon. The\r\nChinese people had a democratic background in the autonomy of the various\r\nextra-political units.\r\n\r\nIn _min shêng_ neither the experience of the West nor the old Chinese\r\nbackground would be of much value. More than the other two principles and\r\nprograms, _min shêng_ sought to alter the constitution and nature of\r\nChinese society. Yet in _min shêng_ the Chinese were to be guided only\r\nnegatively by Western experience. Into their society, passing through a\r\ngreat economic upheaval, they must introduce, by a trial-and-error method,\r\nthe requirements for economic unity, efficiency, and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Economic Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the pitiable failure of the 1912 Republic, Sun Yat-sen began to\r\nplace an especially heavy emphasis on the necessity of a national economic\r\nrevolution which would carry on the achievements of the national political\r\nrevolution. He placed an even greater stress upon the necessity of _min\r\nshêng_ in the revolutionary ideology, and became more and more clearly\r\nconscious of the danger imperialism constituted to the Chinese\r\nrace-nation. He believed that, as the 1912 revolution had been created by\r\nthe sword, the new economic revolution might be furthered by the pen, and\r\nwith this in mind he wrote _The International Development of China_. At\r\nthe time that he wrote this work, he seems to have been convinced of the\r\nfruitlessness of purely military effort, and the superior value of pacific\r\neconomic organization.(299)\r\n\r\nThis organization was to be effected through capital brought in from the\r\noutside. As it developed that capital would not come in, that instead of\r\ncontinuing the terrific pace of production which the World War had\r\ndemanded, the nations returned to comparative laissez faire, and let their\r\neconomies slump, Sun was persuaded that the whole revolution would have to\r\nbe carried on by the Chinese themselves, with the possible help of the\r\nCommunist Russians, and of Japan. He found the reorganized Kuomintang to\r\nbe the instrument of this last revolution, both politically and\r\ndemocratically, and began to emphasize Chinese resistance to the outside,\r\nrather than appeal for help from the barbarian nations.\r\n\r\nIt is this last attitude which one finds expressed in the acts of the last\r\nyears of his life. The national revolution was to be made a reality by\r\nbeing intimately associated with the economic life and development of the\r\ncountry. The plans made for economic development should be pushed as far\r\nas possible without waiting for foreign help. The Chinese should use the\r\ninstrument of the boycott as a sanction with which to give weight to their\r\nnational policy.(300) They had to practise economic nationalism in order\r\nto rid themselves of the incubus of imperialism which was sucking the\r\nlife-blood of their country. In this connection between nationalism and\r\n_min shêng_, the economic aspect of the nationalist program was to be the\r\nmeans, and the national aspect of the _min shêng_ program the consequence.\r\nUnless Chinese, both as members of a state and as individuals stirred by\r\nnational sentiment, were moved to action against Western economic\r\naggression, they might consider themselves already doomed.\r\n\r\nHow did Sun propose to promote the national economic revolution,(301) as\r\ndistinguished from the industrial revolution and the social revolution? He\r\ngave, in the first place, as earlier stated, the economic part of his\r\ntheories a greater weight than they had hitherto enjoyed, and placed them\r\nfirst in his practical program. Secondly, he tended to associate the\r\nnational political revolution more and more with the real seat of economic\r\npower: the working class. In this introduction of the working class into\r\nthe labors for the fulfilment of _min shêng_ as a national economic\r\nrevolution, he was doing two things. He was hoping to bring the standards\r\nof Chinese labor up to those of the West, and he was making use of the\r\npolitical power of labor in China as an added instrument of the national\r\neconomic revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese nation could and should not continue, as a nation, on a scale\r\nof living lower than that of the Western nations. He urged the Chinese\r\nworkers, as the class most affected, to fight for the economic advancement\r\nof themselves and of their nation. “Comrades, the people meeting here are\r\nall workers and represent a part of the nation. A great responsibility\r\nrests on Chinese labor, and if you are equal to the task, China will\r\nbecome a great nation and you a mighty working class.”(302) The Chinese\r\nworkers were performing not only a duty that they owed to themselves—they\r\nwere also acting patriotically.\r\n\r\nIn advancing the national economic revolution by advancing themselves,\r\nthey could not afford to lose sight of the political part of the\r\nrevolution. “Beyond the economic struggle for the shortening of the\r\nworking day and the increase of wages, there are before you other much\r\nmore important questions of a political character. For our political\r\nobjectives you must follow the three principles and support the\r\nrevolution.”(303) The two parts of the revolution could not be separated\r\nfrom one another.\r\n\r\nBesides the economic part of the national revolution, there was another\r\nreadjustment of which Sun did not often speak, because it was not an open\r\nproblem which could be served by immediate political action. This was the\r\nproblem of the transition of China from an autarchic to a trading economy.\r\nThe old Chinese world had been self-sustaining, so self-sustaining that\r\nthe Emperor Tao Kuang wrote to George III of England that he did not\r\ndesire anything that the barbarians might have, but, out of the mercy and\r\nthe bounty of his heart, would permit them to come to China in order to\r\npurchase the excellent things that the Chinese possessed in such\r\nabundance.(304) The impact of the West had had serious economic\r\nconsequences,(305) and the Chinese were in the unpleasant position of\r\nhaving their old economic system disrupted without gaining the advantages\r\nof a nationally organized economy in return. They had the actual privilege\r\nof consuming a greater variety of goods than before, but this was offset\r\nby the fact that the presence of these goods threw their domestic markets\r\nand old native commercial system out of balance, without offering a\r\ncorrespondingly large potentiality of foreign export. Furthermore, the\r\npolitical position of the Western powers in China was such, as Sun Yat-sen\r\ncomplained, that trade was conducted on a somewhat inequitable basis.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of a national economic revolution could not but be\r\nfar-reaching. The political changes in the economic situation demanded by\r\nSun Yat-sen in his program of economic nationalism—the return of tariff\r\nautonomy, the retrocession of the occupied concessions, etc.—would have a\r\ngreat positive and immediate effect; but there would be a long system of\r\ndevelopment, not to be so easily predicted or foreseen, which would\r\ninevitably appear as a result of Chinese nationhood. If China were to have\r\na state strong enough to perform the economic functions which Sun wished\r\nto have imposed upon it, and were to take her place as one of the great\r\nimporting and exporting nations of the world, it is obvious that a real\r\neconomic revolution would have to be gone through.\r\n\r\nHere again the liberal-national character of Sun’s ideology and programs\r\nwith respect to relations with the West appears. The Fascist states of the\r\npresent time exhibit a definite drift from free trade to autarchy. In\r\nChina the change from an autarchic world-society to a trading nation\r\nconstituted the reverse. Sun Yat-sen did not leave a large legacy of\r\nprograms in this connection, but he foresaw the development and was much\r\nconcerned about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program of industrial revolution was planned by Sun Yat-sen with great\r\ncare. The same belief which led him to urge the social revolution also\r\nguided him in his plans for the industrial revolutionizing of the Chinese\r\neconomy, namely, his belief that China could profit by the example of the\r\nWest, that what the West had done wastefully and circuitously could be\r\ndone by the Chinese deliberately and straightforwardly. He proposed that\r\nthe change from the old economy to the new be according to a well thought\r\nout plan. “However, China must develop her industries by all means. Shall\r\nwe follow the old path of western civilization? This old path resembles\r\nthe sea route of Columbus’ first trip to America. He set out from Europe\r\nby a southwesterly direction through the Canary Islands to San Salvador,\r\nin the Bahama group. But nowadays navigators take a different direction to\r\nAmerica and find that the destination can be reached by a distance many\r\ntimes shorter. The path of Western civilization was an unknown one and\r\nthose who went before groped in the dark as Columbus did on his first\r\nvoyage to America. As a late comer, China can greatly profit in covering\r\nthe space by following the direction already charted by western\r\npioneers.”(306) By calling in the help of friends who were familiar with\r\nengineering and by using his own very extensive knowledge of Chinese\r\neconomic potentialities, Sun Yat-sen drafted a broad long-range plan by\r\nmeans of which China would be able to set forth on such a charted course\r\nin her industrial revolution. This plan, offered tentatively, was called\r\n_The International Development of China_ in the English and _The Outline\r\nof Material Reconstruction_ in the Chinese version, both of which Sun\r\nhimself wrote.\r\n\r\nThis outline was originally prepared as a vast plan which could be\r\nfinanced by the great powers, who would thereby find markets for their\r\nglut of goods left over by the war. The loan was to be made on terms not\r\nunprofitable to the financial powers, but nevertheless equitable to the\r\nChinese. Sun Yat-sen hoped that with these funds the Chinese state could\r\nmake a venture into state socialism. It was possible, in his opinion, to\r\nlaunch a coöperative modern economy in China with the assistance of\r\ninternational capitalism, if the capital employed were to be remunerated\r\nwith attractive rates of interest, and if the plan were so designed as to\r\nallow for its being financially worthwhile. He stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before entering into the details of this International development\r\n    scheme four principles have to be considered:\r\n\r\n       1. The most remunerative field must be selected in order to\r\n          attract foreign capital.\r\n       2. The most urgent needs of the nation must be met.\r\n       3. The lines of least resistance must be followed.\r\n       4. The most suitable positions must be chosen.(307)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was not oblivious to the necessity of making each detail of his plan\r\none which would not involve the tying-up of unproductive capital, and did\r\nnot propose to use capital advanced for the purposes of the industrial\r\nrevolution for the sake of military or political advantage.\r\n\r\nThis may be shown in a concrete instance. He spoke of his Great\r\nNortheastern railway system as a scheme which might not seem economically\r\nattractive, and then pointed out that, as between a railway system running\r\nbetween densely-populated areas, the latter would be infinitely the more\r\npreferable. But, said he, “... a railway between a densely populated\r\ncountry and a sparsely settled country will pay far better than one that\r\nruns end to end in a densely populated land.”(308)\r\n\r\nEven though he came to despair of having this scheme for the development\r\nof China carried out by international financial action, the expediency of\r\nhis plans remained. He sought the fulfillment of this outline throughout\r\nhis life; it has remained as a part of his legacy, challenging the Chinese\r\npeople by the grandeur of its conception and the precision of its details.\r\n\r\nIt is a work which cannot easily be summarized in a discussion of\r\npolitical doctrines. Fully comparable in grandeur to the Russian\r\n_Piatiletka_, it provides for a complete communication system including\r\nall types of transport, the development of great ports, colonization and\r\nreclamation projects, and the growth of vast industrial areas comparable\r\nto the Donbas or the Kuzbas. The plan, while sound as a whole and not\r\ninexpedient in detail, is not marked by that irregularity of proportion\r\nwhich marks planning under capitalism; although not as fully worked out as\r\nthe later Russian projects, Sun’s plan, in 1922, was considerably more\r\nadvanced than any Russian plan of that time. Sun shared with Lenin a\r\npassionate conviction of the inevitable necessity of industrialization;\r\nbut while Lenin saw in industrialism the strengthening of that\r\nrevolutionary bulwark, the proletariat, Sun believed in industrialism as a\r\nbenefit to the whole nation.\r\n\r\nThis plan is the obvious fruit of Sun’s advocacy of the adoption of the\r\nWestern physical sciences. Here there is little trace of his ideological\r\nconsistency with the old premises of Chinese society. He does not\r\nchallenge them, but he does present a concrete plan which refers only\r\nincidentally to the political or the ideological. It is heavy with the\r\ndetails of industrial revolution. Sun Yat-sen’s enthusiasm shows clearly\r\nthrough the pages of this work; he wrote it at a time when his health was\r\nstill comparatively good, and when he was not harassed by the almost\r\nexplosive dynamics of the situation such as that in which he delivered the\r\nsixteen lectures on the _San Min Chu I_. Here the practical aspects of his\r\nthinking show forth, his willingness to consider and debate, the profound\r\nand quiet enthusiasm for concrete projects which animated him and which\r\nwas so infectious among his followers.\r\n\r\nIt were, of course, unfeasable to attempt any detailed description and\r\nassessment of the plan.(309) The great amount of point by point\r\nelaboration worked over by Sun Yat-sen in order to make his plan appealing\r\nprecludes the consideration of any one project in detail as a sample.\r\nFailing this, the magnitude of the plan may be gauged by a recapitulation\r\nof the chief points in each of his programs. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that each one of these subheads might necessitate hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars for execution, involving the building of several\r\nindustrial cities or the reconstruction of a whole industry throughout the\r\ncountry. The printing industry, for example, not even mentioned in the\r\ngeneral outline given below, was discussed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This industry provides man with intellectual food. It is a\r\n    necessity of modern society, without which mankind cannot\r\n    progress. All human activities are recorded, and all human\r\n    knowledge is stored in printing. It is a great factor of\r\n    civilization. The progress and civilization of different nations\r\n    of the world are measured largely by the quantity of printed\r\n    matter they turned out annually. China, though the nation that\r\n    invented printing, is very backward in the development of its\r\n    printing industry. In our international Development Scheme, the\r\n    printing industry must also be given a place. If China is\r\n    developed industrially according to the lines which I suggested,\r\n    the demand for printed matter will be exceedingly great. In order\r\n    to meet this demand efficiently, a system of large printing houses\r\n    must be established in all large cities in the country, to\r\n    undertake printing of all kinds, from newspapers to encyclopedia\r\n    [sic!]. The best modern books on various subjects in different\r\n    countries should be translated into Chinese and published in cheap\r\n    edition form for the general public in China. All the publishing\r\n    houses should be organized under one common management, so as to\r\n    secure the best economic results.\r\n\r\n    In order to make printed matter cheap, other subsidiary industries\r\n    must be developed at the same time. The most important of these is\r\n    the paper industry. At present all the paper used by newspapers in\r\n    China is imported. And the demand for paper is increasing every\r\n    day. China has plenty of raw materials for making paper, such as\r\n    the vast virgin forests of the northwestern part of the country,\r\n    and the wild reeds of the Yangtze and its neighboring swamps which\r\n    would furnish the best pulps. So, large plants for manufacturing\r\n    paper should be put up in suitable locations. Besides the paper\r\n    factories, ink factories, type foundries, printing machine\r\n    factories, etc., should be established under a central management\r\n    to produce everything that is needed in the printing\r\n    industry.(310)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this comment on printing as a small sample of the extent of each\r\nminor project in the plans, let us observe Sun’s own summary:\r\n\r\nI.\r\n      The Development of a Communications System.\r\n\r\n      (a)\r\n            100,000 miles of Railways.\r\n      (b)\r\n            1,000,000 miles of Macadam Roads.\r\n      (c)\r\n            Improvement of Existing Canals.\r\n\r\n            (1)\r\n                  Hangchow-Tientsin Canals.\r\n            (2)\r\n                  Sikiang-Yangtze Canals.\r\n\r\n      (d)\r\n            Construction of New Canals.\r\n\r\n            (1)\r\n                  Liaoho-Sunghwakiang Canal.\r\n            (2)\r\n                  Others to be projected.\r\n\r\n      (e)\r\n            River Conservancy.\r\n\r\n            (1)\r\n                  To regulate the Embankments and Channel of the Yangtze\r\n                  River from Hankow to the Sea thus facilitating\r\n                  Ocean-going ships to reach that Port at all seasons.\r\n            (2)\r\n                  To regulate the Hoangho Embankments and Channel to\r\n                  prevent floods.\r\n            (3)\r\n                  To regulate the Sikiang.\r\n            (4)\r\n                  To regulate the Hwaiho.\r\n            (5)\r\n                  To regulate various other rivers.\r\n\r\n      (f)\r\n            The Construction of more Telegraph Lines and Telephones and\r\n            Wireless Systems all over the Country.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n      The Development of Commercial Harbors.\r\n\r\n      (a)\r\n            Three largest Ocean Ports with future capacity equalling New\r\n            York Harbor to be constructed in North, Central and South\r\n            China.\r\n      (b)\r\n            Various small Commercial and Fishing Harbors to be constructed\r\n            along the Coast.\r\n      (c)\r\n            Commercial Docks to be constructed along all navigable rivers.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n      Modern Cities with public utilities to be constructed in all Railway\r\n      Centers, Termini, and alongside Harbors.\r\nIV.\r\n      Water Power Development.\r\nV.\r\n      Iron and Steel Works and Cement Works on the largest scale in order\r\n      to supply the above needs.\r\nVI.\r\n      Mineral Development.\r\nVII.\r\n      Agricultural Development.\r\nVIII.\r\n      Irrigational Work on the largest scale in Mongolia and Sinkiang.\r\nIX.\r\n      Reforestation in Central and North China.\r\nX.\r\n      Colonization in Manchuria, Mongolia, Sinkiang, Kokonor, and\r\n      Thibet.(311)\r\n\r\nThe industrial revolution is to _min shêng_ what the present program of\r\nsocialist construction is to the Marxians of the Soviet Union, what\r\nprosperity is to American democracy. Without industrialization _min shêng_\r\nmust remain an academic theory. Sun’s program gives a definite physical\r\ngauge by means of which the success of his followers can be told, and the\r\nextent of China’s progress estimated. It provides a material foundation to\r\nthe social and political changes in China.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Sun Yat-sen in connection with the continuation of the old\r\nsystem is a significant one. His political doctrines, both ideological and\r\nprogrammatic, are original and not without great meaning in the\r\ndevelopment of an adequate and just state system in modern China. But this\r\nwork might have been done, although perhaps not as well, by other leaders.\r\nThe significance of Sun in his own lifetime lay in his deliberate\r\nchampioning of the cause of industrial revolution as the _sine qua non_ of\r\ndevelopment in China. In the epoch of the first Republic he relinquished\r\nthe Presidency in favor of Yüan Shih-k’ai in order to be able to devote\r\nhis whole time to the advancement of the railway program of the Republic.\r\nIn the years that he had to spend in exile, he constantly studied and\r\npreached the necessity of modernizing China. Of his slogan, “Modernization\r\nwithout Westernization!” modernization is the industrial revolution, and\r\nnon-Westernization the rest of his programs and ideology. The unity of Sun\r\nYat-sen’s doctrines is apparent; they are inseparable; but if one part\r\nwere to be plucked forth as his greatest contribution to the working\r\npolitics of his own time, it might conceivably be his activities and plans\r\nfor the industrial revolution.\r\n\r\nHe spoke feelingly and bitterly of the miserable lives which the vast\r\nmajority of his countrymen had to lead, of the expensiveness and\r\ninsecurity of their material existences, of the vast, tragic waste of\r\nhuman effort in the form of man-power in a world where machine-power had\r\nrendered muscular work unnecessary. “This miserable condition among the\r\nChinese proletariat [he apparently means the whole working class] is due\r\nto the non-development of the country, the crude methods of production,\r\nand the wastefulness of labor. The radical cure for all this is industrial\r\ndevelopment by foreign capital and experts for the benefit of the whole\r\nnation.... If foreign capital cannot be gotten, we will have to get at\r\nleast their experts and inventors to make for us our own\r\nmachinery....”(312) Howsoever the work was to be done, it had to be done.\r\nIn bringing China into the modern world, in modernizing her economy, in\r\nassuring the justice of the new economy which was to emerge, Sun found the\r\nkey in the physical advancement of China, in the building of vast railway\r\nsystems, in creating ports “with future capacity equalling New York\r\nharbor,” in re-making the whole face of Eastern Asia as a better home for\r\nhis beloved race-nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Social Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the social revolution which was to form the third part of\r\nthe program of _min shêng_, four questions appear, each requiring\r\nexamination. It is in this field of Sun’s programs that the terms of the\r\nWestern ideology are most relevant, since the ideological distinctions to\r\nbe found in old China as contrasted with the West do not apply so\r\npositively in problems that are to appear in a society which is to be\r\nindustrially modern. Even in this, however, some of the old Chinese ideas\r\nmay continue in use and give relevance to the terms with which Sun\r\ndiscusses the social revolution. Private property, that mysterious\r\nrelation between an individual and certain goods and services, has been\r\nalmost a fetish in the West; the Chinese, already subject to the\r\ncollectivisms of the family, the village and the _hui_, does not have the\r\ndeep attachment to this notion that Westerners—especially those who do\r\nhave property—are apt to develop. Consequently, even though the discussion\r\nof Sun’s programs with regard to distributive justice are remarkably like\r\nthe discussions of the same problem to be found in the West, the\r\npossibility, at least, of certain minor though thoroughgoing differences\r\nmust be allowed for, and not overlooked altogether. The four aspects to\r\nthis problem which one may distinguish in Sun’s program for _min shêng_\r\nare: what is to be the sphere of state action? what is to be the treatment\r\naccorded private ownership of land? what is to be the position of private\r\ncapital? and, what of the class struggle?\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen said: “In modern civilization, the material essentials of life\r\nare five, namely: food, clothing, shelter, means of locomotion, and the\r\nprinted page.”(313) At other times he may have made slightly different\r\narrangements of these fundamental necessities, but the essential content\r\nof the demands remained the same.\r\n\r\nBehind his demand for a program to carry out _min shêng_ there was the\r\nfundamental belief that a government which does not assure and promote the\r\nmaterial welfare of the masses of its citizens does not deserve to exist.\r\nTo him the problem of livelihood, the concrete aspect of _min shêng_, was\r\none which had to be faced by every government, and was a means of judging\r\nthe righteousness of a government. He could not tolerate a state which did\r\nnot assure the people a fair subsistence. There was no political or\r\nethical value higher than life itself. A government which did not see that\r\nits subjects were fed, sheltered, clothed, transported, and lettered to\r\nthe degree which the economic level of its time permitted, was a\r\ngovernment deserving of destruction. Sun Yat-sen was not a doctrinaire on\r\nthe subject of classes; he would tolerate inequality, so long as it could\r\nbe shown not to militate against the welfare of the people. He was\r\ncompletely intolerant of any government, Eastern or Western, which\r\npermitted its subjects to starve or to be degraded into a nightmare\r\nexistence of semi-starvation. Whatever the means, this end of popular\r\nlivelihood, of a reasonable minimum on the scale of living for each and\r\nevery citizen, had to prevail above all others.(314)\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of this supreme criterion, Sun Yat-sen left the\r\ngovernment to its own choice in the matter of the sphere of state action.\r\nIf the system of private initiative could develop more efficiently than\r\ncould the government in certain fields, then leave those fields to private\r\neffort. If and when private initiative failed to meet rigid requirements\r\nto be established by the government it was not merely the privilege, it\r\nwas the obligation of the government to intervene. Sun Yat-sen seems to\r\nhave believed that government action would in the long run be desirable\r\nanyhow, but to have been enough of a political realist at the same time to\r\nbe willing to allow the government a considerable length of time in\r\nexpanding its activities. In a developing country like China it seemed to\r\nhim probable that the ends of _ming shêng_ could best be served in many\r\nfields by private enterprise. “All matters that can be and are better\r\ncarried out by private enterprise should be left to private hands which\r\nshould be encouraged and fully protected by liberal laws....”(315)\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Sun Yat-sen’s plan of empirical collectivism demanded a\r\nfairly broad range of state action. “All matters that cannot be taken up\r\nby private concerns and those that possess monopolistic character should\r\nbe taken up as national undertakings.”(316) This view of his may be\r\ntraced, among others, to three suppositions he entertained concerning\r\nBismarck, concerning \"war socialism,\" and concerning the industrial\r\nrevolution in China. Sun shows a certain grudging admiration for Bismarck,\r\nwhom he believed to have offset the rising tide of democratic socialism in\r\nGermany by introducing state socialism, in government control of\r\nrailroads, etc. “By this preventive method he imperceptibly did away with\r\nthe controversial issues, and since the people had no reason to fight, a\r\nsocial revolution was naturally averted. This was the very great\r\nanti-democratic move of Bismarck.”(317) Secondly, he believed that the\r\n“... unification and nationalization of all the industries, which I might\r\ncall the Second Industrial Revolution ...” on account of the world war\r\nwould be even more significant than the first.(318) It intensified the\r\nfour elements of recent economic progress, which tended to prove the\r\nfalsity of the Marxian predictions of the future of capitalism, namely:\r\n“a. Social and industrial improvements (i. e. labor and welfare\r\nlegislation); b. State ownership of the means of transportation and of\r\ncommunication; c. Direct taxes; d. Socialized distribution (the\r\ncoöperative movement).”(319) Finally, Sun believed that the magnitude of\r\nthe Chinese industrial revolution was such that no private capital could\r\nestablish its foundations, and that the state had perforce to initiate the\r\ngreat undertakings of industrialism.\r\n\r\nConcerning Sun’s beliefs regarding the sphere of state action in economic\r\nmatters, one may say that his ideology of empirical collectivism required\r\na program calling for: 1) the protection of private enterprise and the\r\nsimultaneous launching of great state enterprises at the beginning; 2) the\r\nintermediate pursuance of a policy by means of which the state would be\r\nthe guarantor of the livelihood of the people, and establish the sphere of\r\nits own action according to whether or not private enterprise was\r\nsufficient to meet the needs of the people; and 3) a long range trend\r\ntoward complete collectivism.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the question of land, Sun Yat-sen believed in his own\r\nversion of the “single tax,” which was not, in his programs, the single\r\ntax, since he foresaw other sources of revenue for the state (tariffs,\r\nrevenue from state enterprises, etc.). According to the land-control\r\nsystem of Sun Yat-sen the land-owner would himself assess the value of his\r\nland. He would be prevented from over-assessing it by his own desire to\r\navoid paying too high a tax; and under-assessment would be avoided by a\r\nprovision that the state could at any time purchase the land at the price\r\nset by the owner. If the land were to go up in value the owner would have\r\nto pay the difference between the amount which he formerly assessed and\r\nthe amount which he believed it to be worth at the later time. The money\r\nso paid would become “... a public fund as a reward, to all those who had\r\nimproved the community and who had advanced industry and commerce around\r\nthe land. The proposal that all future increment shall be given to the\r\ncommunity is the ‘equalization of land ownership’ advocated by the\r\nKuomintang; it is the _Min-sheng_ Principle. This form of the _Min-sheng_\r\nPrinciple is communism, and since the members of the Kuomintang support\r\nthe _San Min_ Principles they should not oppose communism.” Continuing\r\ndirectly, Sun makes clear the nature of the empirical collectivism of his\r\n_min shêng_ program, which he calls communism. “The great aim of the\r\nPrinciple of Livelihood in our Three Principles is communism—a share in\r\nproperty by all. But the communism which we propose is a communism of the\r\nfuture, not of the present. This communism of the future is a very just\r\nproposal, and those who have had property in the past will not suffer at\r\nall by it. It is a very different thing from what is called in the West\r\n‘nationalization of property,’ confiscation for the government’s use of\r\nprivate property which the people already possess.”(320) Sun Yat-sen\r\ndeclared that the solution to the land problem would be half of the\r\nsolution of the problem of _min shêng_.(321)\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen believed in the restriction of private capital in such a way\r\nas to assure its not becoming a socially disruptive force. That is a part\r\nof his ideology which we have already examined. In the matter of an actual\r\nprogram, he believed in the use of “harnessed capital.”(322) He had no\r\nreal fear of capital; imperialist foreign capital was one thing—the small\r\nnative capital another. The former was a political enemy. The latter was\r\nnot formidable. In a speech on Red Labor Day, 1924, when his sympathies\r\nwere about as far Left as they ever were, in consideration for the\r\nkindliness of the Communist assistance to Canton, he said: “Chinese\r\ncapitalists are not so strong that they could oppress the Chinese\r\nworkers,”(323) and added that, the struggle being one with imperialism,\r\nthe destruction of the Chinese capitalists would not solve the question.\r\n\r\nThe restriction of private capital to the point of keeping it harmless,\r\nand thus avoiding the evils which would lead to the class war and a\r\nviolent social revolution, was only half the story of capitalism in China\r\nwhich Sun Yat-sen wanted told in history. The other half was the\r\nadvancement of the industrial revolution by the state, which was the only\r\ninstrumentality capable of doing this great work. “China cannot be\r\ncompared to foreign countries. It is not sufficient (for her) to impose\r\nrestrictions upon capital. Foreign countries are rich, while China is\r\npoor.... For that reason China must not only restrict private capital, but\r\nshe must also develop the capital of the State.”(324) The restrictions to\r\nbe placed upon private capital and upon private land speculation were\r\nnegative; the development of state-owned capital and of capital which the\r\nstate could trust politically were positive, as was the revenue which\r\nshould be gained from the governmental seizure of unearned increment. In\r\nsome cases the state would not even have to trouble itself to confiscate\r\nthe unearned increment; it could itself develop the land and profit by its\r\nrise in value, applying the funds thus derived to the paying-off of\r\nforeign loans or some socially constructive enterprise.(325)\r\n\r\nIdeologically, Sun Yat-sen was opposed to the intra-national class war.\r\nClass war could, nevertheless, be justified in the programs of Sun in two\r\nways: 1) if it were international class war, of the oppressed against the\r\noppressing nations; and 2) if it were the class war of the nationalist\r\nChinese workers against foreign imperialism. In these two cases Sun\r\nYat-sen thought class-war a good idea. He did not think class war\r\nnecessary in contemporary China, and hoped, by means of _min shêng_, to\r\ndevelop an economy so healthy that the pathological phenomena of the class\r\nstruggle would never appear. On the other hand, in justice to Sun, and to\r\nthose Marxians who would apologize for him to their fellow-Marxians, there\r\ncan be little doubt that Sun Yat-sen would have approved of the class war,\r\neven in China, if he had thought that Chinese capitalism had risen to such\r\npower that it obstructed the way of the Chinese nation to freedom and\r\neconomic health. Even in this he might not have set any particular virtue\r\nupon the proletariat as such; the capitalists would be the enemies of the\r\nnation, and it would be the whole nation which would have to dispose of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA finically Scrupulous and detailed examination of Sun Yat-sen’s programs\r\nfor _min shêng_ is intellectually unremunerative, since it has been\r\nestablished that _min shêng_ may be called empirical collectivism;\r\ncollectivism which is empirical cannot be rigidly programmatic, or it\r\nloses its empirical character. Sun, not accepting the dialectics of\r\nhistorical materialism, and following the traditionally Chinese pragmatic\r\nway of thinking, could not orient his revolution in a world of economic\r\npredestinations. With the characteristic Chinese emphasis on men rather\r\nthan on rules and principles, Sun Yat-sen knew that if China were ruled by\r\nthe right sort of men, his programs would be carried through in accordance\r\nwith the expediency of the moment. He does not appear to have considered,\r\nas do some of the left wing, that it was possible for the revolutionary\r\nmovement to be diverted to the control of unworthy persons. Even had he\r\nforeseen such a possible state of affairs, he would not, in all\r\nprobability, have settled his programs any more rigidly; he knew, from the\r\nmost intimate and heart-breaking experience, how easy it is in China to\r\npay lip-service to principles which are rejected. The first Republic had\r\ntaught him that.\r\n\r\nOne must consequently regard the programs of national economic revolution,\r\nof industrial revolution, and of social revolution as tentative and\r\ngeneral outlines of the course which Sun wished the Nationalist Kuomintang\r\nand state to follow in carrying out _min shêng_. Of these programs, the\r\none least likely to be affected by political or personal changes was that\r\nof the industrial revolution, and it is this which is most detailed.(326)\r\nHis great desire was that the Chinese race-nation continue, not merely to\r\nsubsist, but to thrive and multiply and become great, so that it could\r\nrestore the ancient morality and wisdom of China, as well as become\r\nproficient in the Western sciences.\r\n\r\nA last suggestion may be made concerning the programs of Sun Yat-sen,\r\nbefore consideration of the Utopia which lay at the end of the road of\r\n_min shêng_. His plans may continue to go on in _min shêng_ because they\r\nare so empirical. His nationalism may be deflected or altered by the new\r\nsituation in world politics. His optimism concerning the rapidity of\r\ndemocratic developments may not be justified by actual developments. The\r\nprograms of _min shêng_ are so general that they can be followed to some\r\ndegree by governments of almost any orientation along the Right-Left\r\nscale. The really important criterion in the programs of _min shêng_ is\r\nthis: the people must live. It is a simple one to understand, and may be a\r\ngreat force in the continued development of his programs, to the last\r\nstage of _min shêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Utopia of _Min Shêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Yat-sen differs from the empirical collectivists of the West in that\r\nhe has an end to his program, which is to be achieved over a considerable\r\nperiod of time. The means are such that he can be classified with those\r\nWestern thinkers; his goal is one which he took from the ideals in the old\r\nideology and which he identified with those of the communists, although\r\nnot necessarily with the Marxists. He said, at the end of his second\r\nlecture on _min shêng_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our way is community of industrial and social profits. We cannot\r\n    say, then, that the doctrine of _min shêng_ is different from\r\n    communism. The _San Min Chu I_ means a government “of the people,\r\n    by the people, and for the people”—that is, the state is the\r\n    common property of all the people, its politics are participated\r\n    in by all, and its profits are shared by all. Then there will be\r\n    not only communism in property, but communism in everything else.\r\n    Such will be the ultimate end of _min shêng_, a state which\r\n    Confucius calls _ta t’ung_ or the age of “great similarity.”(327)\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other passage from the works of Sun Yat-sen in relation to _min\r\nshêng_ could illustrate his position so aptly. He describes his doctrine.\r\nHe labels it “communism,” although, as we have seen, it is quite another\r\nthing than Marxism. He cites Lincoln. In the end he calls upon the\r\nauthority of Confucius.\r\n\r\nTo a Westerner, the ideal commonwealth of Sun Yat-sen bears a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the world projected in the ideals of the ancient Chinese.\r\nHere again there is “great similarity,” complete ideological harmony, and\r\nthe presumable disappearance of state and law. Property, the fount of war,\r\nhas been set aside, and men—animated by a profound and sincere\r\nappreciation of _jên_—work together, all for the common good. The Chinese\r\nwill, in this Utopia, have struck down _might_ from the high places of the\r\nworld, and inaugurated an era of _the kingly way_ throughout the earth.\r\nTheir ancient doctrines of benevolence and peace shall have succeeded in\r\nbringing about cosmospolitanism.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, differences from the old order of ideals. According to\r\nthe Marxists, nationality, after it has served its purpose as an\r\ninstrument in the long class struggle, may be set aside. Speculation of\r\nthis sort is rare among them, however, and it is difficult to envision\r\ntheir final system. To Sun Yat-sen, however, there was the definite ideal\r\nthat the Chinese live on forever. This was an obligation imposed upon him\r\nand his ideology by the teleological element in the old ideology which\r\nrequired that humanity be immortal in the flesh and that it be immortal\r\nthrough clearly traceable lines of descent. The individual was settled in\r\na genealogical web, reaching through time and space, which gave him a\r\nsense of certainty that otherwise he might lack. This is inconsistent with\r\nthe Marxian ideal, where the family system, a relic of brutal days, shall\r\nhave vanished.\r\n\r\nThe physical immortality of the Chinese race was not the only sort of\r\nimmortality Sun Yat-sen wished China to have. His stress on the peculiar\r\nvirtues of the Chinese intellectual culture has been noted. The Chinese\r\nliterati had sought an immortality of integrity and intellect, a\r\ncontinuity of civilization without which mere physical survival might seem\r\nbrutish. In the teleology of Sun’s ideal society, there would no doubt be\r\nthese two factors: filial piety, emphasizing the survival of the flesh;\r\nand _jên_, emphasizing the continuity of wisdom and honor. Neither could\r\naptly continue unless China remained Chinese, unless the particular\r\nvirtues of the Chinese were brought once again to their full potency.(328)\r\n\r\nThe family system was to continue to the _min shêng_ Utopia. So too were\r\nthe three natural orders of men. Sun Yat-sen never advocated that the\r\nfalse inequality of the present world be thrown down for the purpose of\r\nputting in its place a false equality which made no distinction between\r\nthe geniuses, the apostles, and the unthinking. The Chinese world was to\r\nbe Chinese to the end of time. In this the narrowness of Sun Yat-sen’s\r\nideals is apparent; it is, perhaps, a narrowness which limits his\r\naspirations and gives them strength.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Utopia which was to be at the end of _min shêng_ was to be\r\nestablished in a world, moreover, which might not have made a complete\r\nreturn to ideological control, in which the state might still survive. The\r\nrequirements of an industrial economy certainly presupposes an enormous\r\nlength of time before the ideology and the society shall have been\r\ncompletely adjusted to the peculiarities of life in a world not only of\r\nworking men but of working machines. The state must continue until all men\r\nare disciplined to labor: \"When all these vagrants will be done away with\r\nand when all will contribute to production, then clothing will be abundant\r\nand food sufficient; families will enjoy prosperity, and individuals will\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Then the question of the ‘people’s life’ will be solved.”(329)\r\n\r\nThus Sun Yat-sen concluded his last lecture on _min shêng_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bibliography of works in Western languages dealing with Sun Yat-sen is\r\nshort. The author has made no attempt to gather various fugitive pieces,\r\nsuch as newspaper clippings. He believes, however, that the following\r\nbibliography of Western works on Sun is the most nearly complete which has\r\nyet appeared, and has listed, for the sake of completeness, two Russian\r\nitems as yet unavailable in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the bibliography presents these Western materials,\r\narranged according to their subject. Within each category, the individual\r\nitems are presented in chronological order; this has been done in order to\r\nmake clear the position of the works in point of time of publication—a\r\nfactor occasionally of some importance in the study of these materials.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the bibliography lists further works which have been\r\nreferred to or cited. The first group of these consists of a small\r\ncollection of some of the more important Chinese editions of, and Chinese\r\nand Japanese treatises upon, Sun Yat-sen’s writings. The second group\r\nrepresents various Western works on China or on political science which\r\nhave been of assistance to the author in this study.\r\n\r\nChinese names have been left in their natural order, with the patronymic\r\nfirst. Where Chinese names have been Westernized and inverted, they have\r\nbeen returned to their original Chinese order, but with a comma inserted\r\nto indicate the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

This is the leading\r\n      English-language journal of the Chinese Communists. Mme. Sun’s\r\n      letter to the paper is characteristic of the attitude toward Nanking\r\n      adopted throughout the magazine.\r\n\r\n    2 These manuscripts consist of the following chief items: Linebarger,\r\n      Paul Myron Wentworth, _Conversations with Sun Yat-sen 1919-1922_\r\n      (written in 1933-1935); the same, _A Commentary on the San Min Chu\r\n      I_ (four volumes, 1932-1933); and Sun Yat-sen, _How China Was Made a\r\n      Republic_ (Shanghai, 1919). These are all typescripts, with\r\n      autograph corrections by their respective authors. The manuscripts\r\n      of Judge Linebarger represent his attempts to replace, from memory,\r\n      books which were destroyed at the time of the bombardment of the\r\n      Commercial Press in Shanghai by the Japanese. He had prepared a\r\n      two-volume work on the life and principles of Sun Yat-sen and had\r\n      left his manuscripts and other papers in the vaults of the Press.\r\n      When the Press was bombed the manuscripts, documents, plates and\r\n      Chinese translations were all destroyed; the only things remaining\r\n      were a few pages of proof sheets for _The Life and Principles of Sun\r\n      Chung-san_, which remain in the possession of the present author.\r\n      Judge Linebarger attempted to replace these volumes. He had a few\r\n      notebooks in which he had kept the outlines of his own speeches; he\r\n      had not used these, because of the secondary value. When, however,\r\n      the major volumes were lost, he returned to these notebooks and\r\n      reconstructed his speeches. They were issued in Paris in 1932 under\r\n      the title of _The Gospel of Sun Chung-shan_. He also prepared the\r\n      _Commentary_ and the _Conversations_ from memory. These manuscripts\r\n      possess a certain somewhat questionable value. Judge Linebarger\r\n      himself suggested that they be allowed the same weight that\r\n      testimony, based upon memory but delivered under oath, upon a\r\n      subject ten years past would receive in a court of justice. The\r\n      seven volumes described are in the possession of the present author.\r\n      Other materials to which the author has had access are his father’s\r\n      diaries and various other private papers; but since he has not cited\r\n      them for references, he does not believe any description of them\r\n      necessary. Finally, there are the manuscripts of _Sun Yat-sen and\r\n      the Chinese Republic_, which contain a considerable amount of\r\n      material deleted from the published version of that work, which\r\n      appeared in New York in 1925. For comments on other source material\r\n      for Sun Yat-sen which is not generally used, see Bibliography.\r\n\r\n    3 Lyon Sharman, _Sun Yat-sen, His Life and Its Meaning_, New York,\r\n      1934, p. 405.\r\n\r\n    4 He did this in his _Political Testament_, which is given in almost\r\n      every work on Sun Yat-sen or on modern Chinese politics. It was\r\n      written in February and signed in March 1925, shortly before his\r\n      death.\r\n\r\n    5 The Chinese text of these is given in Hu Han-min, _ed._, _Tsung-li\r\n      Ch’üan Chi_ (_The Complete Works of the Leader_), 4 vol. in 1,\r\n      Shanghai, 1930. This collection comprises the most important works\r\n      of Sun which were published in his lifetime. Edited by one of the\r\n      two scholars closest to Sun, it is the standard edition of his\r\n      works. English versions of varying amounts of this material are\r\n      given in Paschal M. d’Elia, _The Triple Demism of Sun Yat-sen_,\r\n      Wuchang, 1931; Frank W. Price, _San Min Chu I, The Three Principles\r\n      of the People_, Shanghai, 1930; and Leonard Shih-lien Hsü, _Sun\r\n      Yat-sen, His Political and Social Ideals_, Los Angeles, 1933. Each\r\n      of these works will henceforth be cited by the name of its editor;\r\n      for brief descriptions and appraisals, see the bibliography.\r\n\r\n    6 The only English version of this work is one prepared by Wei Yung,\r\n      under the title of _The Cult of Dr. Sun_, Shanghai, 1931. Fragments\r\n      of this work are also to be found in Vilenskii (Sibiriakov), V.,\r\n      _Sun’ Iat-sen, Otets Kitaiskoi Revoliutsii_, (_Sun Yat-sen, Father\r\n      of the Chinese Revolution_), Moscow, 1925; _Zapiski Kitaiskogo\r\n      Revoliutsionera_, (_Notes of a Chinese Revolutionary_), Moscow,\r\n      1926; _Memoirs of a Chinese Revolutionary_, Philadelphia, n. d.; and\r\n      Karl Wittfogel, _Sun Yat Sen, Aufzeichnungen eines chinesischen\r\n      Revolutionärs_, Vienna & Berlin, n. d. (ca. 1927).\r\n\r\n    7 This work has not been translated into any Western language.\r\n\r\n    8 Sun Yat-sen, _The International Development of China_, New York and\r\n      London, 1929.\r\n\r\n    9 This is given in Hsü, cited above, and in Min-ch’ien T. Z. Tyau,\r\n      _Two Years of Nationalist China_, Shanghai, 1930, pp. 439-442. Dr.\r\n      Tyau substitutes the word “Fundamentals” for “Outline,” a rather\r\n      happy choice.\r\n\r\n   10 See bibliography for a complete list of the translations. d’Elia\r\n      translation, cited, pp. 36-49, dedicates a whole chapter to the\r\n      problem of an adequate translation of the Chinese phrase _San Min\r\n      Chu I_. He concludes that it can only be rendered by a nelogism\r\n      based upon Greek roots: _the triple demism_, “demism” including the\r\n      meaning of “principle concerning and for the people” and “popular\r\n      principle.”\r\n\r\n   11 T’ang Leang-li, _The Inner History of the Chinese Revolution_, New\r\n      York, 1930, p. 166.\r\n\r\n   12 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 58.\r\n\r\n   13 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 58.\r\n\r\n   14 See Lyon Sharman, _Sun Yat-sen, His Life and Its Meaning_, New York,\r\n      1934, p. 292, for a stimulating discussion of the parts that the\r\n      various documents played in the so-called \"cult of Sun Yat-sen.\"\r\n\r\n   15 Sharman, cited, p. 270.\r\n\r\n   16 A typical instance of this sort of criticism is to be found in the\r\n      annotations to the anonymous translation of the _San Min Chu I_\r\n      which was published by a British newspaper in 1927 (_The Three\r\n      Principles_, Shanghai, 1927). The translator and annotator both\r\n      remained anonymous; the translation was wholly inadequate; and the\r\n      annotations a marvel of invective. Almost every page of the\r\n      translation was studded with notes pointing out and gloating over\r\n      the most trivial errors and inconsistencies. The inflamed opinion of\r\n      the time was not confined to the Chinese.\r\n\r\n   17 Paul M. W. Linebarger, _Deutschlands Gegenwärtige Gelegenheiten in\r\n      China_, Brussels, 1936, p. 53. Judge Linebarger repeats the story\r\n      told him by General Morris Cohen, the Canadian who was Sun’s\r\n      bodyguard throughout this period.\r\n\r\n   18 Nathaniel Peffer, _China: The Collapse of a Civilization_, New York,\r\n      1930, p. 155.\r\n\r\n   19 d’Elia, cited; Hsü, cited; and Wittfogel, cited.\r\n\r\n   20 Maurice William, _Sun Yat-sen Versus Communism_, Baltimore, 1932;\r\n      and Tsui Shu-chin, _The Influence of the Canton-Moscow Entente upon\r\n      Sun Yat-sen’s Political Philosophy_, in _The Social and Political\r\n      Science Review_, XVIII, 1, 2, 3, Peiping, 1934; and other works\r\n      listed in bibliography, pp. 268-269.\r\n\r\n   21 Two such are the chapters on Sun Yat-sen’s thought to be found in\r\n      Harley Farnsworth MacNair, _China in Revolution_, Chicago, 1931, pp.\r\n      78-91 (Chapter VI, “The Ideology and Plans of Sun Yat-sen”) and\r\n      Arthur N. Holcombe, _The Chinese Revolution_, Cambridge\r\n      (Massachusetts), 1930, pp. 120-155 (Chapter V, “The Revolutionary\r\n      Politics of Sun Yat-sen”). The former is the shorter of the two, and\r\n      is a summary of the various documents involved. The distinction\r\n      between the ideology and the plans is so convenient and illuminating\r\n      that the present writer has adopted it. Except for the comments on\r\n      the influence of William upon Sun Yat-sen, it is completely\r\n      reliable. The latter is a discussion, rather than an outline, and\r\n      admirably presents the gist of Sun’s thought.\r\n\r\n   22 Holcombe, cited, p. 136 ff.\r\n\r\n   23 The word “ideology” is one of the catchwords of the hour. The author\r\n      regrets having to use it, but dares not coin a neologism to replace\r\n      it. He does not desire that “ideology” be opposed to “truth,” but\r\n      uses the word in its broadest possible sense, referring to the whole\r\n      socio-psychological conditioning of a group of people. He does not,\r\n      therefore, speak of ideologies as a collection of Paretian\r\n      derivations, fictions which mask some “truth.” He considers his own\r\n      background—or Pareto’s, for that matter—as ideological, and—in the\r\n      sense of the word here employed—cannot conceive of any human belief\r\n      or utterance _not_ ideological. The task he has set himself is the\r\n      transposition of a pattern of Chinese ideas concerning government\r\n      from the Chinese ideology to the Western-traditionalist ideology of\r\n      the twentieth century. Whether one, the other, neither, or both, is\r\n      “right,” is quite beside the point, so far as the present enterprise\r\n      is concerned. In calling the whole non-physical background of a\r\n      society the ideology of that society, the author can excuse his\r\n      novel use of the term only if he admits that he establishes the new\r\n      meaning by definition, without any necessary reference to the\r\n      previous use of the term. He has no intention of following, in the\r\n      present work, any “theory of ideology” or definition of “ideology”\r\n      established by political philosophers, such as Marx, or sociologists\r\n      such as Weber, Mannheim, or Pareto. (Professor A. O. Lovejoy\r\n      suggested the following definition of the term, “ideology,” after\r\n      having seen the way it was employed in this work: “_Ideology_ means\r\n      a complex of ideas, in part ethical, in part political, in part\r\n      often religious, which is current in a society, or which the\r\n      proponents of it desire to make current, as an effective means of\r\n      controlling behavior.”)\r\n\r\n   24 Confucianism may be read in the Legge translations, a popular\r\n      abridged edition of which was issued in 1930 in Shanghai under the\r\n      title of _The Four Books_. Commentaries on Confucius which present\r\n      him in a well-rounded setting are Richard Wilhelm, _Confucius and\r\n      Confucianism_, New York, 1931; the same, _Ostasien, Werden und\r\n      Wandel des Chinesischen Kulturkreises_, Potsdam, 1928, for a very\r\n      concise account and the celebrated _Geschichte der chinesischen\r\n      Kultur_, Munich, 1928, for a longer account in a complete historical\r\n      setting; Frederick Starr, _Confucianism_, New York, 1930; H. G.\r\n      Creel, _Sinism_, Chicago, 1929; and Marcel Granet, _La Civilization\r\n      Chinoise_, Paris, 1929. Bibliographies are found in several of these\r\n      works. They deal with Confucius either in his historical setting or\r\n      as the main object of study, and are under no necessity of\r\n      distorting Confucius’ historical rôle for the purpose of showing his\r\n      connection with some other topic. The reader may gauge the amount of\r\n      distortion necessary when he imagines a work on Lenin, written for\r\n      the information and edification of Soviet Eskimos, which—for the\r\n      sake of clarity—was forced to summarize all Western thought, from\r\n      Plato and Jesus Christ down to Immanuel Kant and Karl Marx, in a few\r\n      pages providing a background to Lenin.\r\n\r\n   25 There is a work on Confucianism upon which the author has leaned\r\n      quite heavily: Leonard Shih-lien Hsü, _The Political Philosophy of\r\n      Confucianism_, New York, 1932. Dr. Hsü is interested in sociological\r\n      political theory. The novelty of his work has aroused a great amount\r\n      of criticism among Chinese scholars of the older disciplines,\r\n      whether the relatively conservative and established Western\r\n      disciplines or the ultra-conservative schools of the truly classical\r\n      literati. His work cannot be recommended for any purposes other than\r\n      those which Dr. Hsü himself had in mind; there are several other\r\n      works, the product of philosophers, historians, and literary\r\n      historians, which will present a portrait of Confucius and\r\n      Confucianism more conventionally exact. In its own narrow but\r\n      definite field Dr. Hsü’s work is an impressive accomplishment; he\r\n      transposes the Confucian terms into those of the most advanced\r\n      schools of social thought. A reader not forewarned might suffer by\r\n      this, and read into Confucius an unwarranted modernity of outlook;\r\n      if, however, the up-to-dateness is recognized as Dr. Hsü’s and not\r\n      Confucius’, the work is valuable. It puts Confucius on common ground\r\n      with modern social theory, ground on which he does not belong, but\r\n      where his ideas are still relevant and interesting. The present\r\n      author follows Dr. Hsü in this transposition of Confucius, but begs\r\n      the reader to remember that this is one made for purposes of\r\n      comparison only, and not intended as valid for all purposes. (He\r\n      must acknowledge the stimulating criticism of Mr. Jan Tai, of the\r\n      Library of Congress, who made it clear that this distortion of\r\n      Confucius was one which could be excused only if it were\r\n      admitted.)—An interesting presentation of Confucius as transposed\r\n      into the older political theory, untouched by sociology, is to be\r\n      found in Senator Elbert Duncan Thomas, _Chinese Political Thought_,\r\n      New York, 1927.\r\n\r\n   26 Granet, _Chinese Civilization_, cited, p. 84. Granet’s work, while\r\n      challenged by many sinologues as well as by anthropologists, is the\r\n      most brilliant portrayal of Chinese civilization to the time of Shih\r\n      Huang Ti. His interpretations make the language of the _Odes_\r\n      (collected by Confucius) intelligible, and clear up the somewhat\r\n      obscure transition from the oldest feudal society to the epoch of\r\n      the proto-nations and then to the inauguration of the world order.\r\n\r\n   27 Granet, cited, pp. 87-88.\r\n\r\n   28 Richard Wilhelm, _Geschichte der chinesischen Philosophie_, Breslau,\r\n      1929, p. 19.\r\n\r\n   29 One could therefore say that membership in a society is determined\r\n      by the outlook of the individual concerned.\r\n\r\n   30 In modern Western political thought, this doctrine is most clearly\r\n      demonstrated in the Marxian thesis of the withering-away of the\r\n      state. The Marxists hold that, as the relics of the class struggle\r\n      are eliminated from the new society, and classlessness and uniform\r\n      indoctrination come to prevail, the necessity for a state—which\r\n      they, however, consider an instrument of class domination—will\r\n      decline and the state will atrophy and disappear.\r\n\r\n   31 Liang Ch’i-ch’ao, _History of Chinese Political Thought during the\r\n      early Tsin Period_, translated by L. T. Chen, New York, 1930, p. 38.\r\n\r\n   32 Liang Ch’i-ch’ao (cited, p. 48 and following) discusses these\r\n      points.—The author is indebted to Mr. Jên Tai for the explanation of\r\n      the relation of these various factors in the Confucian ideology.\r\n\r\n   33 Leon Wieger and L. Davrout, _Chinese Characters_, Hsien-hsien, 1927,\r\n      p. 6.\r\n\r\n   34 Hsü, cited above, chapter three, contains an excellent discussion of\r\n      the doctrine of rectification.\r\n\r\n   35 A stimulating discussion of the pragmatism of early Chinese thought\r\n      is to be found in Creel, cited.\r\n\r\n   36 It must be pointed out in this connection that Confucius advocated\r\n      an ideology which would not only be socially useful but\r\n      scientifically and morally exact. He did not consider, as have some\r\n      Western thinkers of the past century, that the ideology might be a\r\n      quite amoral instrument of control, and might contain deliberate or\r\n      unconscious deception. Hsü writes, in his _Confucianism_, cited, p.\r\n      93, of the various translations of the word _li_ into English: “The\r\n      word _li_ has no English equivalent. It has been erroneously\r\n      translated as ‘rites’ or ‘propriety’. It has been suggested that the\r\n      term civilization is its nearest English equivalent; but\r\n      ‘civilization’ is a broader term, without necessarily implying\r\n      ethical values, while _li_ is essentially a term implying such\r\n      values.” _Li_ is civilized behavior; that is, behavior which is\r\n      civilized in being in conformance with the ideology and the values\r\n      it contains.\r\n\r\n   37 Hsü, cited, p. 103.\r\n\r\n   38 Confucius the individual was quite nationalistically devoted to his\r\n      native state of Lu, and, more philosophically, hostile to the\r\n      barbarians. Hsü, cited, p. 118.\r\n\r\n   39 John K. Shryock, _The Origin and Development of The State Cult of\r\n      Confucius_, New York, 1932, traces this growth with great clarity\r\n      and superlative scholarship. The work is invaluable as a means to\r\n      the understanding of the political and educational structure\r\n      commonly called “Confucian civilization.”\r\n\r\n   40 This expansion took place in China in the reign of Ch’in Shih Huang\r\n      Ti, who used the state of Ch’in as an instrument by means of which\r\n      to destroy the multiple state-system and replace it with a powerful\r\n      unitary state for all China. He sought to wipe out the past, raising\r\n      the imperial office to a position of real power, and destroying the\r\n      whole feudal organization. He abolished tenantry and supplanted it\r\n      with a system of small freeholds. Although his immediate successors\r\n      did much to restore the forms and appearances of the past, his work\r\n      was not altogether undone. Himself hostile to Confucius, his actions\r\n      implemented the teachings to an enormous degree. See Granet, cited,\r\n      pp. 96-104.\r\n\r\n   41 D. H. Kulp, _Family Life in South China_, New York, 1925, p. xxiv.\r\n\r\n   42 H. G. Creel, cited, p. 10. Creole writes as follows of the\r\n      significance of the village: “The village life is very important,\r\n      for it appears to be the archetype from which the entire Chinese\r\n      conception of the world and even of the cosmos grew. The village\r\n      was, as has been said, small. It was based on agriculture. It was\r\n      apparently a community of a peaceful regularity and a social\r\n      solidarity beyond anything which we of the present can imagine.”\r\n\r\n   43 Arthur Smith, one of the few Westerners to live in a Chinese village\r\n      for any length of years, wrote: “It is a noteworthy fact that the\r\n      government of China, while in theory more or less despotic, places\r\n      no practical restrictions upon the right of free assemblage by the\r\n      people for the consideration of their own affairs. The people of any\r\n      village can, if they choose, meet every day of the year. There is no\r\n      government censor present, and no restriction upon the liberty of\r\n      debate. The people can say what they like, and the local Magistrate\r\n      neither knows nor cares what is said.... But should insurrection\r\n      break out, these popular rights might be extinguished in a moment, a\r\n      fact of which all the people are perfectly well aware.” _Village\r\n      Life in China_, New York, 1899, p. 228. This was written thirteen\r\n      years before the fall of the Ch’ing dynasty.\r\n\r\n   44 J. S. Burgess, _The Guilds of Peking_, New York, 1928. This is\r\n      perhaps the best work on the subject of the guilds which has yet\r\n      appeared. The information was gathered by the students of the\r\n      author, who as a teacher had excellent facilities for developing\r\n      contacts. The students, as Chinese, were able to gather data from\r\n      the conservative guild leaders in a manner and to a degree that no\r\n      Westerner could have done. The classification here given is a\r\n      modification of Burgess’.\r\n\r\n   45 S. Wells Williams, _The Middle Kingdom_, New York, 1895, p. 405. Dr.\r\n      Williams, whose work is perhaps the most celebrated single work on\r\n      China in the English language, wrote as follows concerning the\r\n      nobility under the Ch’ing:\r\n\r\n      “The titular nobility of the Empire, as a whole, is a body whose\r\n      members are without power, land, wealth, office, or influence, in\r\n      virtue of their honors; some of them are more or less hereditary,\r\n      but the whole system has been so devised, and the designations so\r\n      conferred, as to tickle the vanity of those who receive them,\r\n      without granting them any real power. The titles are not derived\r\n      from landed estates, but the rank is simply designated in addition\r\n      to the name....” He also pointed out that, under the Ch’ing, the\r\n      only hereditary titles of any significance were _Yen Shing Kung_\r\n      (for the descendant of Confucius) and _Hai Ching Kung_ (for the\r\n      descendant of Kuo Hsing-hua, the formidable sea adventurer who drove\r\n      the Dutch out of Taiwan and made himself master of that island).\r\n\r\n   46 William Frederick Mayers, _The Chinese Government, A Manual of\r\n      Chinese Titles ..._, Shanghai, 1897, devotes one hundred and\r\n      ninety-five pages to the enumeration of the Ch’ing titles. His work,\r\n      intended to be used as an office manual for foreigners having\r\n      relations with Chinese officials, remains extremely useful as a\r\n      presentation of the administrative outline of the Chinese government\r\n      in its last days before the appearance of Sun Yat-sen and the\r\n      Kuomintang. Pao Chao Hsieh, _The Government of China (1644-1911)_,\r\n      Baltimore, 1925, is a more descriptive work dealing with the whole\r\n      administration of the Ch’ing dynasty. No work has as yet appeared in\r\n      the West, to the knowledge of the present author, which describes\r\n      the historical development of government in China in any detail.\r\n\r\n   47 The figures given are those of the present day, which may be more or\r\n      less exact for the past century. For earlier times, the number will\r\n      have to be reduced in proportion with the remoteness in time. See\r\n      Richard Henry Tawney, _Land and Labour in China_, London, 1932.\r\n\r\n   48 Richard Wilhelm, _Confucius and Confucianism_, cited, pp. 130-132.\r\n      The connection between the naming of names and the operation of the\r\n      popular check of revolution is made evident by Wilhelm in a\r\n      brilliant passage. If a righteous ruler died a violent death at the\r\n      hands of one of his subjects, he was murdered; were he unrighteous,\r\n      he was only killed. Confucius himself used such terms in his annals.\r\n      His use of varying terms, terms carrying condemnation or\r\n      condonement, even of such a subject as regicide, electrified the\r\n      scholars of his day.\r\n\r\n   49 An exception must be made in the case of the first Russian colony in\r\n      Peking, which was lost in two centuries and became virtually\r\n      indistinguishable from the mass of the population. The Portuguese,\r\n      at Macao, displayed that tendency to compromise and miscegenate\r\n      which marked their whole progress along the coasts of Asia, but they\r\n      maintained their political supremacy in that city; today the\r\n      Macanese are largely of Chinese blood, but Portuguese-speaking, and\r\n      proud of their separateness.\r\n\r\n   50 Too many works have been written on the relations of the Chinese and\r\n      Westerners to permit any citations, with one exception. Putnam\r\n      Weale’s _The Vanished Empire_, New York, 1925, is an extraordinarily\r\n      vivid history of the collision of the civilizations. It is not\r\n      particularly commendable as a factual record, but as a brilliant and\r\n      moving piece of literature presenting the Chinese viewpoint, it is\r\n      unexcelled.\r\n\r\n   51 See Adolf Reichwein, _China and Europe: Intellectual and Artistic\r\n      Contacts in the Eighteenth Century_, New York, 1925, which makes\r\n      apparent the full extent to which modern Europe is indebted to China\r\n      for the luxuries of its culture.\r\n\r\n   52 In this connection, it might be pointed out that the attractive\r\n      strength of the two civilizations has not, as yet, been adequately\r\n      studied, although there is an enormous amount of loose\r\n      generalization on the subject: “The Chinese are becoming completely\r\n      Westernized,” or “The Chinese, in spite of their veneer, are always\r\n      Chinese; they will, in the end, absorb their conquerors.” But will\r\n      they? In the face of a modern educational and propaganda system,\r\n      there is at least room for doubt; it is not beyond all conjecture\r\n      that the Chinese of Manchuria might be Japanized as easily as the\r\n      fiercely chauvinistic Japanese might be sinicized. The only adequate\r\n      answer to the question would be through detailed studies of the\r\n      social conditioning and preferences of Chinese under foreign\r\n      influence (as in Hongkong, Taiwan, Manchuria), and of foreigners\r\n      under Chinese influence (the White Russians in China, the few other\r\n      Westerners in preëminently Chinese milieux).\r\n\r\n   53 An example of this is to be found in Manabendra Nath Roy,\r\n      _Revolution und Konterrevolution in China_, Berlin, 1930. Roy was\r\n      one of the emissaries of the Third International to the\r\n      Nationalists, and his ineptness in practical politics assisted\r\n      materially in the weakening of the Communist position. His work\r\n      quite seriously employs all the familiar clichés of Western class\r\n      dispute, and analyzes the Chinese situation in terms that ignore the\r\n      fact that China is Chinese.\r\n\r\n   54 This same line of attack seems, in the West, to be employed only by\r\n      the Catholic church which, while opposing any avowedly\r\n      collectivistic totalitarian state, seeks to maintain control on an\r\n      ideological and not a political basis, over almost all aspects of\r\n      the life of its members. No political party or governing group seems\r\n      to share this attitude.\r\n\r\n   55 Karl A. Wittfogel, in his _Sun Yat-sen_, cited, as well as Roy, in\r\n      the work cited, thinks very little of the justice of Confucianism.\r\n      The extreme mobility of Chinese society, which largely precluded the\r\n      development of any permanent class rule, is either unknown to them\r\n      or ignored. If the ideologue-officials of old China composed a\r\n      class, they were a class like no other known, for they provided for\r\n      the continuous purging of their own class, and its continuous\r\n      recruitment from all levels of society—excepting that of prostitutes\r\n      and soldiers.\r\n\r\n   56 T’ang Leang-li writes, in _The Inner History of the Chinese\r\n      Revolution_, New York, 1930, p. 168, as follows concerning Sun\r\n      Yat-sen’s early teaching of nationalism:\r\n\r\n      “Previous to the Republican Revolution of 1911, the principle of\r\n      nationality was known as the principle of racial struggle, and was\r\n      in effect little more than _a primitive tribalism rationalized to\r\n      serve as a weapon_ in the struggle against the Manchu oppressors. It\r\n      was the corner-stone of revolutionary theory, and by emphasizing the\r\n      racial distinction between the ruling and the oppressed classes,\r\n      succeeded in uniting the entire Chinese people against the Manchu\r\n      dynasty.” (Italics mine.) In speaking of _min ts’u_ as a primitive\r\n      tribalism which had been rationalized as a weapon, Dr. T’ang might\r\n      lead some of his readers to infer that Sun Yat-sen did not believe\r\n      what he taught, and that—as a master-stroke of practical politics—he\r\n      had devised an ideological weapon which, regardless of its\r\n      truthfulness, would serve him in his struggles. But, it may be\r\n      asked, what was Sun Yat-sen struggling for, if not the union and\r\n      preservation of the Chinese people?\r\n\r\n   57 See sections, below, on the programs of nationalism.\r\n\r\n   58 d’Elia translation, p. 131. Sun Yat-sen said: “Formerly China too\r\n      entertained the ambition of becoming mistress of the whole world and\r\n      of rising above all other countries; so she (too) advocated\r\n      cosmopolitanism.... When the Manchus entered the Great Wall, they\r\n      were very few; they numbered 100,000 men. How were those 100,000 men\r\n      able to subject hundreds of millions of others? Because the majority\r\n      of Chinese at that time favored cosmopolitanism and said nothing\r\n      about nationalism.”\r\n\r\n   59 d’Elia translation, pp. 126 ff.\r\n\r\n   60 It seems to the present writer that, whatever criteria are selected\r\n      for the determination of the nationhood of a given society,\r\n      _uniqueness_ certainly is _not_ one of the qualities attributed to a\r\n      “nation.” It is not appropriate for the author to venture upon any\r\n      extended search for a “true nation”; he might observe, however, that\r\n      in his own use—in contrast to Sun Yat-sen’s—he employs the term in a\r\n      consciously relative sense, contrasting it with the old Chinese\r\n      cosmopolitan society, which thought itself unique except for certain\r\n      imitations of itself on the part of half-civilized barbarians. A\r\n      “nation” must signify, among other things, for the purposes of this\r\n      work, a society calling itself such and recognizing the existence of\r\n      other societies of more or less the same nature. Sun Yat-sen, on the\r\n      other hand, regarded a nation as a group of persons as real as a\r\n      family group, and consistently spoke of the Chinese nation as having\r\n      existed throughout the ages—even in those times when the Chinese\r\n      themselves regarded their own society as the civilized world, and\r\n      did so with some show of exactness, if their own viewpoint is taken\r\n      into account.\r\n\r\n   61 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 130-131. d’Elia’s italics, covering\r\n      the last two sentences in the quotation, have been omitted as\r\n      superfluous. As an illustration of the difference between the\r\n      translation of d’Elia and that of Hsü, the same paragraph might also\r\n      be cited from the latter translation. “The ethical value of\r\n      everything is relative and so nothing in the world is innately good\r\n      or innately bad. It is determined by circumstances. A thing that is\r\n      useful to us is a good thing; otherwise, a bad thing. Also, a thing\r\n      that is useful and advantageous to the world is a good thing;\r\n      otherwise, a bad thing.” Hsü translation, cited, pp. 210-211.\r\n      Excepting for occasional purposes of comparison, the translation of\r\n      Father d’Elia will be referred to in citing the sixteen lectures on\r\n      the _San Min Chu I_.\r\n\r\n   62 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 70. The curiously significant use of\r\n      the word “forever” is reminiscent of the teleology of the Chinese\r\n      family system, according to which the flesh-and-blood immortality of\r\n      man, and the preservation of identity through the survival of\r\n      descendants, is a true immortality.\r\n\r\n_   63 Wo-men Chung-kuo jen_ and _ni-men wai-kuo jen_.\r\n\r\n   64 Paul M. Linebarger, _The Life and Principles of Sun Chung-shan_, p.\r\n      102. There is here told the anecdote of Sun Yat-sen’s first\r\n      encounter with race-hatred. At Ewa, Hawaii, in 1880, Sun, then a\r\n      young lad just arrived from China, met a Westerner on the road. The\r\n      Westerner threatened him, and called him “Damn Chinaman!” and\r\n      various other epithets. When Sun Yat-sen discovered that the man was\r\n      neither deranged nor intoxicated, but simply venting his general\r\n      hatred of all Chinese, he was so much impressed with the incident\r\n      that he never forgot it.\r\n\r\n   65 Hsü translation, cited, p. 168; d’Elia translation, cited, p. 68.\r\n\r\n   66 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 70.\r\n\r\n   67 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 71.\r\n\r\n   68 Sun Yat-sen said: “A scrap of paper, a pen, and a mutual agreement\r\n      will be enough for the ruin of China ... in order to wipe her out by\r\n      common agreement, it suffices that the diplomats of the different\r\n      countries meet somewhere and affix their signatures.... One morning\r\n      will suffice to annihilate a nation.” d’Elia translation, cited, p.\r\n      170.\r\n\r\n   69 The danger of relying too much on foreign aid can be illustrated by\r\n      a reference to Sun-Joffe Manifesto issued in Shanghai, January 26,\r\n      1922. Sun Yat-sen, as the leader of the Chinese Nationalist\r\n      movement, and Adolf Joffe, as the Soviet Special Envoy, signed a\r\n      joint statement, the first paragraph of which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n      “Dr. Sun Yat-sen holds that the Communistic order or even the Soviet\r\n      System cannot actually be introduced into China, because there do\r\n      not exist here the conditions for the successful establishment of\r\n      either Communism or Sovietism. This view is entirely shared by Mr.\r\n      Joffe who is further of the opinion that China’s paramount and most\r\n      pressing problem is to achieve unification and attain full national\r\n      independence, and regarding this great task he has assured Dr. Sun\r\n      Yat-sen that China has the warmest sympathy of the Russian people\r\n      and can count on the support of Russia.”\r\n\r\n      See T’ang Leang-li, cited, p. 156.\r\n\r\n      In view of the subsequent Communist attempt, in 1927, to convert the\r\n      Nationalist movement into a mere stage in the proletarian conquest\r\n      of power in China, in violation of the terms of the understanding\r\n      upon which the Communists and the Chinese Nationalists had worked\r\n      together, the leaders of the Kuomintang are today as mistrustful of\r\n      what they term Communist politico-cultural imperialism as they are\r\n      of capitalist politico-economic imperialism. It is curious that the\r\n      APRA leaders in Peru have adopted practically the same attitude.\r\n\r\n   70 It is necessary to remember that in the four decades before 1925,\r\n      during which Sun Yat-sen advocated _nationalism_, the word had not\r\n      acquired the ugly connotations that recent events have given it. The\r\n      nationalism of Sun Yat-sen was conceived of by him as a pacific and\r\n      defensive instrument, for the perpetuation of an independent Chinese\r\n      race and civilization. See Paul M. W. Linebarger, _Conversations\r\n      with Sun Yat-sen, 1919-1922_, Book I, ch. 5, “Defensive\r\n      Nationalism,” and ch. 6, “Pacific Nationalism,” for a further\r\n      discussion of this phase of Sun Yat-sen’s thought.\r\n\r\n_   71 tien sha wei kung._\r\n\r\n   72 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 184.

The passage reads in full: “Sun Yat-sen\r\n      umfasst vollkommen die wahren Gedanken Chinas, wie sie bei Yau und\r\n      Schun und auch bei Kung Dsï und Mong Dsï wiederfinden. Dadurch wird\r\n      uns klar, dass Sun Yat Sen der Erneuerer der seit 2000 Jahre\r\n      ununterbrochenen chinesischen sittlichen Kultur ist. Im vergangenen\r\n      Jahr hat ein russischer Revolutionär an Sun Yat Sen die folgende\r\n      Frage gerichtet: ‘Welche Grundlage haben Ihre Revolutionsgedanken?’\r\n      Sun Yat Sen hat darauf geantwortet: ‘In China hat es ein sittlichen\r\n      Gedanken gegeben, der von Yau, Schun, Yü, Tang, Wen Wang, Wu Wang,\r\n      Dschou Gung his zu Kung Dsï getragen worden ist; seither ist er\r\n      ununterbrochen, ich habe wieder an ihn angeknüpft und versacht, ihn\r\n      weiter zu entwickeln.’ Der Fragende hat dies nicht verstehen können\r\n      und sich weiter erkundigt; Sun Yat Sen hat noch mehrmals versucht,\r\n      ihm seine Antwort zu erklären. Aus dieser Unterredung können wir\r\n      ersehen, dass Sun Yat Sen von seine Gedanken überzeugt war,\r\n      gleichzeitig können wir ersehen, dass seine Nationalrevolution auf\r\n      dem Widererwachen der chinesischen Kultur beruht. Er hat die\r\n      schöpferische Kraft Chinas wieder ins Leben rufen und den Wert der\r\n      chinesischen Kultur fur die ganze Welt nutzbar machen wollen, um\r\n      somit den Universalismus verwirklichen zu können.” Allowance will\r\n      have to be made, as it should always in the case of Tai Chi-tao, for\r\n      the author’s deep appreciation of and consequent devotion to the\r\n      virtues of Chinese culture. Other disciples of Sun Yat-sen wrote in\r\n      a quite different vein. The present author inclines to the opinion,\r\n      however, that Tai Chi-tao’s summary is a just rendition of Sun\r\n      Yat-sen’s attitude. Sun Yat-sen loved and fought for the struggling\r\n      masses of China, whose misery was always before his pitying eyes; he\r\n      also fought for the accomplishments of Chinese civilization. In\r\n      modern China, many leaders have fought for the culture, and\r\n      forgotten the masses (men such as Ku Hung-ming were typical); others\r\n      loved the populace and forgot the culture. It was one of the\r\n      elements of Sun Yat-sen’s greatness that he was able to remember\r\n      both.\r\n\r\n   90 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 199-202.\r\n\r\n   91 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 259.\r\n\r\n   92 This idea, of wealth as national capacity to produce, is of course\r\n      not a new one.

In a society where the ideology had been stabilized for\r\n      almost two millenia, this was undoubtedly quite true. In modern\r\n      China, however, faced with the terrific problem of again settling\r\n      the problem of an adequate ideology, the reverse was true: knowledge\r\n      was difficult, and action easy. This was one of the favorite\r\n      aphorisms of Sun Yat-sen, and he devoted much time, effort, and\r\n      thought to making it plain to his countrymen. The comparative points\r\n      of view of Wang Yang-ming and Sun Yat-sen afford a quite clear-cut\r\n      example of the contrast between an established and unsettled\r\n      ideology.\r\n\r\n   97 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 336-345. This discussion occurs in\r\n      the fifth lecture on democracy, incidental to Sun Yat-sen’s\r\n      explaining the failure of the parliamentary Republic in Peking, and\r\n      the general inapplicability of Western ideas of democracy to China.\r\n\r\n   98 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 344.\r\n\r\n   99 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 344.\r\n\r\n  100 It might again be pointed out that Sun Yat-sen differed with Marxism\r\n      which, while it, of course, does not hold that all knowledge is\r\n      already found, certainly keeps its own first premises beyond all\r\n      dispute, and its own interpretations sacrosanct. The dialectics of\r\n      Marx and Hegel would certainly appear peculiar in the Chinese\r\n      environment. Without going out of his way to point out the\r\n      difference between Sun’s Nationalism and Marxism-Leninism, the\r\n      author cannot refrain—in view of the quite popular misconception\r\n      that Sun Yat-sen was at one time almost a Marxist convert—from\r\n      pointing out the extreme difference between the premises, the\r\n      methods, and the conclusions of the two philosophies.\r\n\r\n  101 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 344.\r\n\r\n  102 Hsü, _Confucianism_, cited, contains two chapters relevant to the\r\n      consideration of this problem. Ch. III, “The Doctrine of\r\n      Rectification” (pp. 43-61), and Ch. XI, “Social Evolution” (pp.\r\n      219-232), discuss rectification and ideological development within\r\n      the Confucian ideology.\r\n\r\n  103 As an illustration of Dr. Sun’s continued activity as a medical man,\r\n      the author begs the reader’s tolerance of a short anecdote. In 1920\r\n      or 1921, when both Judge Linebarger and Sun Yat-sen were in\r\n      Shanghai, and were working together on the book that was to appear\r\n      as _Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Republic_, the younger son of Judge\r\n      Linebarger—the brother of the present author—fell ill with a rather\r\n      obscure stomach disorder. The Western physicians having made little\r\n      or no progress in the case, Sun Yat-sen intervened with an old\r\n      Chinese herbal prescription, which he, a Western-trained physician,\r\n      was willing to endorse. The remedy was relatively efficacious—more\r\n      so than the suggestions of the European doctors. Even though Sun\r\n      Yat-sen very early abandoned his career of professional medical man\r\n      for that of revolutionist, he appears to have practised medicine\r\n      intermittently throughout his life.\r\n\r\n  104 Sun Yat-sen wrote, in Wei Yung translation, cited, p. 115: “In our\r\n      age of scientific progress the undertaker [sic!], seeks to know\r\n      first before undertaking. This is due to the desire to forestall\r\n      blunders and accidents so as to ensure efficiency and economy of\r\n      labor. He who is able to develop ideas from knowledge, plans from\r\n      ideas, and action from plans can be crowned with success in any\r\n      undertaking irrespective of its profoundness or the magnitude of\r\n      labor involved.”\r\n\r\n  105 Tai, cited, p. 66: “Wir sind Chinesen, und was wir zunächst zu\r\n      ändern haben liegt in China. Aber wenn alle Dinge in China wertlos\r\n      gewerden sind, wenn die chinesische Kultur in der Kulturgeschichte\r\n      der Welt keine Bedeutung mehr hat, und wenn das chinesische Volk die\r\n      Kraft, seine Kultur hochzuhalten, verloren hat, dann können wir\r\n      gleich mit gebundenen Händen den Tod abwarten; zu welchem Zweck\r\n      brauchen wir dann noch Revolution zu treiben!”\r\n\r\n  106 An interesting discussion of this attitude is to be found in Li Chi,\r\n      _The Formation of the Chinese People_, Cambridge (Massachusetts),\r\n      1928.\r\n\r\n  107 See Tsui Shu-chin, cited, pp. 96-146. The work of Tsui is good for\r\n      the field covered; his discussion of the contrasting policy of the\r\n      Communists and of Sun Yat-sen with respect to nationalities may be\r\n      regarded as reliable.\r\n\r\n  108 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 67 and following.\r\n\r\n  109 See above, “The Nation and State in Chinese Antiquity.”\r\n\r\n  110 The present state of Western knowledge of the sociology of China is\r\n      not sufficient to warrant reference to any authorities for the\r\n      description of egalitarianism and mobility. These matters are still\r\n      on that level of unspecialized knowledge where every visitor to\r\n      China may observe for himself. The bibliography on the social life\r\n      of the Chinese on pp. 240-242 of Kenneth Scott Latourette, _The\r\n      Chinese: Their History and Culture_, New York, 1934, contains some\r\n      of the leading titles that touch on the subject. Prof. A. R.\r\n      Radcliffe-Brown of the University of Chicago informed the present\r\n      author that he contemplates the planning of an extensive program of\r\n      socio-anthropological field work in Chinese villages which will\r\n      assist considerably in the understanding of the sociology of old\r\n      China.\r\n\r\n  111 Hsü, _Confucianism_, cited, p. 49, states the function of the\r\n      Confucian leaders quite succinctly: “... the Confucian school\r\n      advocates political and social reorganization by changing the social\r\n      mind through political action.”\r\n\r\n  112 Hsü, cited, p. 104.\r\n\r\n  113 Hsü, cited, pp. 195-196.\r\n\r\n  114 Mariano Ponce, _Sun Yat Sen, El fundador de la Republica de China_,\r\n      Manila, 1912, p. 23.\r\n\r\n      “Y tampoco era posible sustituirla por otra dinastía nacional. Sólo\r\n      existen al presente dos familias en China, de donde podían salir los\r\n      soberanos: uno es la descendencia de la dinastía Ming, de que\r\n      usurparon los mandchüs el trone, hace más de dos siglos y medio, y\r\n      la otra es la del filósofo Confucio, cuyo descendiente lineal\r\n      reconocido es el actual duque Kung. Ni en una, ni en otra existen\r\n      vástagos acondicionados para regir un Estado conforme á los\r\n      requerimientos de los tiempos actuales. Hubo de descartarse, pues,\r\n      de la plataforma de la ‘Joven China’ el pensamiento de instalar en\r\n      el trono á una dinastía nacional. Y sin dinastía holgaba el trono.\r\n\r\n      “No sabemos si aún habiendo en las dos familias mencionados miembros\r\n      con condiciones suficientes para ser el Jefe supremo de un Estado\r\n      moderno, hubiese prosperado el programa monarquico.\r\n\r\n      “Lo que sí pueda decir es que desde los primeros momentos\r\n      evolucionayon las ideas de Sun Yat Sen hacia el republicanismo....”\r\n\r\n      Ponce then goes on to point out Sun Yat-sen’s having said that the\r\n      decentralized system of old government and the comparative autonomy\r\n      of the vice-regencies presented a background of “a sort of\r\n      aristocratic republic” (“une especie de república aristocrática”).\r\n\r\n  115 Ponce, cited, p. 24. “... la única garantía posible, el único medio\r\n      por excelencia para obtener los mejores gobernantes....”\r\n\r\n  116 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 234.\r\n\r\n  117 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 235.\r\n\r\n  118 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 255.\r\n\r\n  119 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 266, note 1. Father d’Elia discusses\r\n      the reasons which made it seem more probable that Sun was\r\n      transliterating the name Millar into Chinese rather than (John\r\n      Stuart) Mill.\r\n\r\n  120 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 256 and following.\r\n\r\n  121 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 271.\r\n\r\n  122 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 273.\r\n\r\n  123 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 242-243.\r\n\r\n  124 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 223 and following. Dr. Hsü (cited, p.\r\n      263 and following) translates these four epochs as following: _hung\r\n      fang_, “the stage of the great wilderness”; _shen ch’üan_, “the\r\n      state of theocracy”; _chun ch’üan_, “the stage of monarchy”; and\r\n      _min ch’üan_, “the stage of democracy.”\r\n\r\n  125 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 241-242.\r\n\r\n  126 Linebarger, _Conversations_, cited, Book II, ch. 2.\r\n\r\n  127 It is of interest to note that the “New Life Movement” inaugurated\r\n      by Chiang Chieh-shih is concerned with many such petty matters such\r\n      as those enumerated above. Each of these small problems is in itself\r\n      of little consequence; in the aggregate they loom large.\r\n\r\n  128 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 331.\r\n\r\n  129 Hsü translation, cited, p. 352. It is interesting to note that the\r\n      translation by Father d’Elia gives a more literal translation of the\r\n      names that Sun Yat-sen applied to these categories. He translates\r\n      the Chinese terms as _pre-seeing_, _post-seeing_, and _non-seeing_.\r\n\r\n  130 Hsü translation, cited, p. 352.\r\n\r\n  131 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 348.\r\n\r\n  132 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 352. Sun Yat-sen defined democracy\r\n      thus: “... under a republican government, the people is sovereign.”\r\n\r\n  133 Tai Chi-tao, cited, p. 25, refers to this distinction as being\r\n      between force (_Gewalt_) and power (_Macht_). To the people\r\n      belonged, and rightfully, the force which could sanction or refuse\r\n      to sanction the existence of the government and the confirmation of\r\n      its policies. The government had the power (_Macht_), which the\r\n      people did not have, of formulating intelligent policies and\r\n      carrying them out in an organized manner.\r\n\r\n  134 Liang Chi-ch’ao, cited, pp. 50-52.\r\n\r\n  135 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 279 and following.\r\n\r\n  136 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 368.\r\n\r\n  137 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 368-9. Dr. Wou Saofong, in his _Sun\r\n      Yat-sen_ (Paris, 1929), summarizes his thesis of Sun Yat-sen in\r\n      somewhat different terms: “... Sun Yat-sen compare, le gouvernement\r\n      à un appareil mécanique, dont le moteur est constitué _par les lois_\r\n      ou les ministres, tandis que l’ingénieur que dirige la machine était\r\n      autrefois le roi et aujourd’hui le peuple,” p. 124. (Italics mine.)\r\n      This suggestion that the state-machine, in the theory of Sun\r\n      Yat-sen, is composed of laws as well as men is quite interesting;\r\n      Sun Yat-sen himself does not seem to have used this figure of speech\r\n      and it may be Dr. Wou’s applying the juristic interpretation on his\r\n      own initiative. Sun Yat-sen, in his sixth lecture on democracy,\r\n      says, “Statesmen and lawyers of Europe and America say that\r\n      government is a machine of which law is a tool.” (d’Elia\r\n      translation, cited, p. 368.)\r\n\r\n  138 It must always remain one of those conjectures upon which scholars\r\n      may expend their fantasy what Sun Yat-sen would have thought of the\r\n      necessity of the juristic state, which involved a quite radical\r\n      change throughout the Chinese social organism, had he lived to see\r\n      the ebb of juristic polity and, for all that, of voting democracy.\r\n      It is not unlikely that his early impressions of the United States\r\n      and his reading of Montesquieu would have led him to retain his\r\n      belief in a juristic-democratic state in spite of the fact that such\r\n      a state would no longer represent the acme of ultra-modernism.\r\n\r\n  139 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 378 and following.\r\n\r\n  140 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 369.\r\n\r\n  141 Reginald Johnston, _Twilight in the Forbidden City_, cited above,\r\n      presents an apparently true account of the conspiracies of the\r\n      various Northern generals which centered around the person of P’u\r\n      Yi. According to Johnston Tsao Kun was defeated in his attempt to\r\n      restore the Manchu Emperor only by the jealousies of his\r\n      fellow-militarists.\r\n\r\n  142 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 406.\r\n\r\n  143 Father d’Elia devotes the whole second chapter of his introduction\r\n      to the consideration of a suitable rendition of _San Min Chu I_,\r\n      which he calls the Triple Demism. (Work cited, pp. 36-49.) Again on\r\n      p. 402, he explains that, while he had translated _min shêng_ as\r\n      _socialism_ in the first French edition of his work, he now renders\r\n      it as _the economic Demism_ or _sociology_. The most current\r\n      translation, that of Frank Price, cited, gives _the principle of\r\n      livelihood_. Paul Linebarger gave it as _socialism_ as far back as\r\n      1917 (_The Chinese Nationalist Monthly_, December, 1917, Chicago) in\r\n      Chicago, at the time when Lin Shen, Frank C. Lee and he were all\r\n      working for Sun in that city. Dr. H. H. Kung, a high government\r\n      official related by marriage to Mme. Sun Yat-sen, speaks of the\r\n      three principles of _liberty_, _democracy_, and _economic\r\n      well-being_ (preface to Hsü, _Sun_, cited, p. xvi). Dr. V. K.\r\n      Wellington Koo, one of China’s most eminent diplomats, speaks of\r\n      _social organization_ (_Memoranda Presented to the Lytton\r\n      Commission_, New York City, n. d.). Citations could be presented\r\n      almost indefinitely. _Min_ means “people,” and _shêng_ means “life;\r\n      vitality, the living, birth, means of living” according to the\r\n      dictionary (S. Wells Williams, _A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese\r\n      Language_, Tungchou, 1909). The mere terms are of very little help\r\n      in solving the riddle of _min shêng_. Laborious examination is\r\n      needed, and even this will not, perhaps, lead us to anything more\r\n      than probability. Sun Yat-sen, in his lectures, called it by several\r\n      different names, which seem at first sight to contradict each other.\r\n\r\n  144 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 91-92.\r\n\r\n  145 Linebarger, _Conversations_, cited, Bk. IV, p. 62: “I must confess\r\n      that the idea of using the sacred cult of ancestor worship as a\r\n      political machine is very abhorrent to me. In fact, I think that\r\n      even the rashest fool would never attempt to use this intimate cult\r\n      with its exclusively domestic privacy as a revolutionary\r\n      instrument.”\r\n\r\n  146 Linebarger, _Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Republic_, New York, 1925,\r\n      pp. 68-9.\r\n\r\n  147 The same, pp. 135-139.\r\n\r\n  148 The same, pp. 104-105.\r\n\r\n  149 The same, pp. 122-123.\r\n\r\n  150 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 472.\r\n\r\n  151 Karl A. Wittfogel, _Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft Chinas_, Leipzig,\r\n      1931. The author, the German Marxian who wrote the best Marxist\r\n      critique of Sun Yat-sen, is the only scholar to seek a really\r\n      complete picture of the old Chinese economy by the technique of\r\n      modern Western economic analysis. Described by the author as an\r\n      “attempt,” the first volume of this work runs to 737 pages. It is\r\n      valuable for the large amount of statistical material which it\r\n      contains, and for its systematic method; its Marxian bias narrows\r\n      its interest considerably.\r\n\r\n  152 Both works of Wittfogel, cited above, are useful for the\r\n      understanding of the transition from the old economy to the new. For\r\n      a general view of the economic situation and potentialities of\r\n      China, see George B. Cressey, _China’s Geographic Foundations_, New\r\n      York, 1934. The bibliography on Chinese economy to be found in\r\n      Latourette, cited above, vol. II, pp. 116-119, is useful.\r\n\r\n  153 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 97.\r\n\r\n  154 See below, section on the national economic revolution.\r\n\r\n  155 Hsü translation, cited, pp. 186-187. The d’Elia translation gives a\r\n      more exact rendering of Sun Yat-sen’s words (p. 97), but, by\r\n      following Sun Yat-sen in calling China a hypo-colony, is less\r\n      immediately plain to the Western reader than is the translation of\r\n      Dr. Hsü, who in this instance uses “sub” and “hypo” interchangeably.\r\n\r\n  156 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 443.\r\n\r\n  157 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 452.\r\n\r\n  158 His _International Development of China_, New York, 1922\r\n      (republished 1929), is a colossal plan which could only be compared\r\n      with the _Piatiletka_ or with the New Deal in the United States,\r\n      since Sun Yat-sen suggested that—in order to avoid the consequences\r\n      of a post-war depression—the nations of the world might cooperate in\r\n      the equal exploitation of Chinese national resources with the\r\n      Chinese. He proposed the modernization of China by a vast\r\n      international loan which could permit the Western nations to\r\n      maintain their war-time peak production, supplying China (1929 ed.,\r\n      p. 8). He concludes the work: “In a nutshell, it is my idea to make\r\n      capitalism create socialism in China so that these two economic\r\n      forces of human civilization will work side by side in future\r\n      civilization” (p. 237). The work is, however, generally regarded as\r\n      a transportation plan, since Sun Yat-sen sketched out a railway map\r\n      of China which would require decades to realize, and which\r\n      overshadowed, by its very magnitude, the other aspects of his\r\n      proposals.\r\n\r\n  159 At the risk of digression, one might comment on an interesting\r\n      element of the Euramerican ideology which is in sharp contrast to\r\n      the Chinese. The West has, apparently, always been devoted to\r\n      dichotomies of morality. The Greeks had reason and unenlightenment,\r\n      and whole series of ideals that could be fought for and against, but\r\n      the real division of good and bad in the West came, of course, with\r\n      Christianity, which accustomed Westerners to think for centuries in\r\n      terms of holiness versus evil—they being, geographically, holy, and\r\n      the outsiders (heathen), evil. Now that the supernatural foundations\r\n      of Christianity have been shaken by the progress of scientific and\r\n      intellectual uncertainty, many Westerners find an emotional and an\r\n      intellectual satisfaction in dividing the world into pure and\r\n      unclean along lines of sometimes rather abstruse economic questions.\r\n      This new morality seems to be based on distributive economics rather\r\n      than on deity. It is employed, of course, by the Marxians, but their\r\n      adversaries, in opposing them with equal passion, fall into the same\r\n      habit. It is shocking and unbelievable to such persons to discover\r\n      that there is a society whose ideology does not center around the\r\n      all-meaningful point of the ownership of the means of production.\r\n      Their only reaction is a negation of the possibility of such\r\n      thought, or, at least, of its realism. The intellectual position of\r\n      Sun Yat-sen in the modern world would be more clearly appreciated if\r\n      the intellectuals of the West were not adjusting their ideological\r\n      and emotional habits from religion to economics, and meanwhile\r\n      judging all men and events in economic terms. The present discussion\r\n      of Sun Yat-sen’s economic ideology is a quite subordinate one in\r\n      comparison to the examination of his ideology as a whole, but some\r\n      persons will regard it as the only really important point that could\r\n      be raised concerning him.\r\n\r\n  160 Tsui, cited, p. 345, quotes Nathaniel Peffer: “... Peffer said that\r\n      Dr. Sun never ‘attained intellectual maturity, and he was completely\r\n      devoid of the faculty of reason. He functioned mentally in sporadic\r\n      hunches. It was typical of him that he met Joffe, read the Communist\r\n      Manifesto, and turned Communist, and then read one book by an\r\n      American of whom he knew nothing, and rejected communism all in a\r\n      few months.’ ” Sun Yat-sen knew Marxism, years before the Russian\r\n      Revolution. The Communist Manifesto was not new to him. He was\r\n      extraordinarily well read in Western political and economic thought.\r\n      Sun Yat-sen never turned Communist, nor did he subsequently reject\r\n      communism any more than he had done for years.\r\n\r\n  161 The author hopes, at some future time, to be able to fill in the\r\n      intellectual background of Sun Yat-sen much more thoroughly than he\r\n      is able to at the present, for lack of materials. One interesting\r\n      method would involve the listing of every Western book with which\r\n      Sun Yat-sen can be shown to have been acquainted. It might be a\r\n      fairly accurate gauge of the breadth of his information.\r\n\r\n  162 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 461-468. Father d’Elia’s note on the\r\n      relative positions of Henry George and Sun (p. 466) is interesting.\r\n      For a discussion of the actual program proposed by Sun, see below,\r\n      “The Program of _Min Shêng_” section on land policy.\r\n\r\n  163 Lyon Sharman, _Sun Yat-sen_, cited, p. 58.\r\n\r\n  164 The same, pp. 98-99. There is an inconsistency of wording here,\r\n      which may or may not be the fault of the translator. The oath refers\r\n      to the “equitable redistribution of the land” (p. 98); the platform\r\n      speaks of “the nationalization of land” (p. 98); and one of the\r\n      slogans is “Equalize land-ownership!”\r\n\r\n  165 See also the discussion in Tsui, _Canton-Moscow Entente_, cited, pp.\r\n      371-376; and in Li Ti-tsun, “The Sunyatsenian principle of\r\n      Livelihood,” _The Chinese Students’ Monthly_, XXIV (March 1929), pp.\r\n      230. Li declares that Sun envisioned immediate redistribution but\r\n      ultimate socialization, but does not cite his source for this.

Since the purpose of\r\n      the present work is to undertake an exposition of the Nationalist\r\n      political ideology and programs against the background of the old\r\n      Chinese ideology, such an emphasis upon one comparatively small\r\n      point in Sun Yat-sen’s doctrines would be entirely disproportionate\r\n      as well as superfluous.

The next speech of Sun\r\n      Yat-sen given in Wittfogel’s work is Sun’s indignant attack on “the\r\n      so-called Labor Government” of England, which permitted the old\r\n      methods of British Far Eastern imperialism to continue.\r\n\r\n  199 Linebarger, _Conversations_, cited, Book III, p. 18. This work,\r\n      while it cannot be given the weight of direct quotations from Sun’s\r\n      own writings or speeches, does contain a good deal about the\r\n      policies of _min shêng_ which does not appear elsewhere. The author\r\n      has sought to avoid citation of it where direct sources are\r\n      available, since the nature of the material makes it by no means so\r\n      authoritative as others might be.\r\n\r\n  200 Coker, cited, p. 551.\r\n\r\n  201 E. D. Harvey, _The Mind of China_, New Haven, 1933, deals\r\n      extensively with these supernatural elements. The reader who turns\r\n      to it should keep in mind the fact that the supernatural plays a\r\n      rôle in China distinctly less important than that which it did, say,\r\n      in medieval Europe, and that a strong agnostic, rather than a\r\n      skeptical, spirit among the Chinese has preserved them from the\r\n      grossest errors of superstition.\r\n\r\n  202 Latourette, cited, p. 129. Dr. Latourette’s sketch of Chinese\r\n      religious thought is especially good, as indeed it might be, since\r\n      he is one of the most celebrated American scholars in the field of\r\n      Western religion in China.\r\n\r\n  203 H. G. Creel, work cited, p. 127.\r\n\r\n  204 The author cannot give a documentary citation for this observation.\r\n      It was communicated to him many times by his father, Judge Paul\r\n      Linebarger, who stated that Sun Yat-sen was most apt to talk in\r\n      terms of morality and morale by preference. The fact that Sun\r\n      Yat-sen came from a Chinese Confucian background into a Western\r\n      Christian one cannot be ignored. He did not permit his Christianity\r\n      to sway him from what he considered his necessary lines of behavior\r\n      in politics; it did not, for example, prevent him from being\r\n      extremely cordial to the Soviet Union at the time that that state\r\n      was still more or less outcaste. And yet, speaking of the Christian\r\n      God, he is reputably reported to have said: “God sent me to China to\r\n      free her from bondage and oppression, and I have not been\r\n      disobedient to the Heavenly mission”; and, again, to have said on\r\n      the day before his death: “I am a Christian; God sent me to fight\r\n      evil for my people. Jesus was a revolutionist; so am I.” (Both\r\n      quotations from appendix to the d’Elia translation, p. 718.)\r\n\r\n  205 Sun Yat-sen authorized the biography, cited, which Judge Linebarger\r\n      wrote of him. It was a propaganda work, and neither he nor the\r\n      author had any particular expectation that it would ever be regarded\r\n      as a source, or as an academically prepared document. The last\r\n      chapter of this authorized biography bears the title, “Conclusion:\r\n      Sun the Moral Force.” This, perhaps, is significant as to Sun’s own\r\n      attitude.\r\n\r\n  206 Note the contrast between the thought of Sun in this respect and\r\n      that of Tagore or Gandhi. This has been pointed out by many Western\r\n      writers on China.\r\n\r\n  207 Linebarger, _Conversations_, cited, Book III, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  208 Sharman, cited, p. 282.\r\n\r\n  209 The reader must bear in mind the fact that what is presented here is\r\n      Sun Yat-sen’s political program for China. In many instances the\r\n      course of affairs has deviated quite definitely from that program,\r\n      and it can be only a matter of conjecture as to what Sun Yat-sen\r\n      would do were he to return and observe the Nationalist movement as\r\n      it now is. It is manifestly impossible to trace all the changes in\r\n      this program. The actual developments have conformed only in part\r\n      with Sun Yat-sen’s plans, although the leaders seek to have it\r\n      appear as though they are following as close to Sun Yat-sen’s\r\n      democratic politics as they can. Many persons who were close to Sun\r\n      Yat-sen, such as Mme. Sun Yat-sen, believe that the National\r\n      Government has betrayed the theory of Sun Yat-sen, and that\r\n      Generalissimo Chiang Chieh-shih has made himself the autocrat of the\r\n      National Government. It is, of course, impossible within the scope\r\n      of this thesis to enter into this dispute. Who rules the\r\n      Soviet—Stalin, or the Communist Party? Who rules China—Chiang\r\n      Chieh-shih, or the Kuomintang? In each case there is the question of\r\n      whether the leader could get along without the party, and whether\r\n      the party could get along without the leader, as well as the\r\n      question of the leader’s sincerity. These issues, however burning\r\n      they might be in real life, could not be adequately treated in a\r\n      work such as this. The author has sought to present Sun Yat-sen’s\r\n      theory of applied politics. Where events which Sun Yat-sen foresaw\r\n      have come to pass, the author has referred to them. He does not wish\r\n      to be understood as presenting a description of the whole course of\r\n      events in China.\r\n\r\n  210 Here, again, one must remember that Mme. Sun Yat-sen, Eugene Chen,\r\n      and others charge that the Party no longer rules, that it has been\r\n      prostituted by Chiang Chieh-shih, and now serves only to cloak a\r\n      military despotism. It may be noted, so far as the other side of the\r\n      question is concerned, that a greater number of the persons who were\r\n      eminent in the Party before Sun Yat-sen died have remained in it\r\n      than have left it.\r\n\r\n  211 See T’ang, work cited for an excellent description of the mutations\r\n      of the revolutionary party. T’ang criticizes the present personnel\r\n      of the Kuomintang severely, but the reader must keep in mind the\r\n      fact that he has since become reconciled with the present\r\n      leadership, and make allowances for the somewhat emphatic\r\n      indignation voiced at the time of writing the book. The brilliance\r\n      of the author guarantees that the story is well told, but it is not\r\n      told for the last time. See also, Min-ch’ien T. Z. Tyau, _Two Years\r\n      of Nationalist China_, Shanghai, 1930, for a summary that is as\r\n      excellent as it is short. Various changes have occurred in party\r\n      function, organization, and personnel since that time, but they have\r\n      not—to the knowledge of the author—been completely and adequately\r\n      covered by any one work.\r\n\r\n  212 For a history of this period, see T’ang, Sharman, or Tsui Shu-chin,\r\n      all cited above. The Communist side of the story is told by Harold\r\n      Isaacs (editor), _Five Years of Kuomintang Reaction_, Shanghai,\r\n      1932, and in the various works of the Stalinist and Trotskyist\r\n      groups concerning the intervention of the Third Internationale in\r\n      China. Two graphic personal accounts cast in semi-fictional form,\r\n      are Oscar Erdberg, _Tales of Modern China_, Moscow, 1932, and\r\n      Vincent Sheean, _Personal History_, New York, 1935; these present\r\n      the Communist and the left-liberal viewpoints, respectively. The\r\n      dramatic story of the Entente, the separation, and the ensuing\r\n      conflict are not yet remote enough to have cooled into material\r\n      ready for the historian.\r\n\r\n  213 The Kuomintang, in accepting the Communist administrative structure,\r\n      was not violating traditional Chinese patterns altogether. It has\r\n      been pointed out that the revised structure of the Kuomintang\r\n      resembled older Chinese guild patterns as well as the new Russian\r\n      style (Sharman, work cited, p. 262).\r\n\r\n  214 Here, again, one might refer to the disputes as to the orthodoxy and\r\n      integrity of the present leadership. The preëminence of\r\n      Generalissimo Chiang Chieh-shih, which cannot be doubted, is seen by\r\n      persons friendly to him as a strong and beneficent influence upon\r\n      the C. E. C. Persons hostile to him charge that he has packed the C.\r\n      E. C. with his adherents, and controls it as he chooses.\r\n\r\n  215 An interesting piece of research could deal with the method of\r\n      recruitment and registration in the Kuomintang before the coming of\r\n      the Communist advisers. There was rarely any doubt as to who was, or\r\n      was not, a member, but there was constant trouble as to the good\r\n      standing of members. Recruitment seems to have been on a basis of\r\n      oath-taking, initiation, etc.; what Party discipline there was seems\r\n      to have been applied only in the most extreme cases, and then\r\n      crudely.\r\n\r\n  216 It is interesting to note that the Kuomintang is to a certain degree\r\n      democratic in representing the various occupational groups in China.\r\n      Tyau, cited above, p. 25 and following, lists the percentages in the\r\n      membership in the Kuomintang according to occupation, as they stood\r\n      in 1930: Party work, 5.84%; government service, 6.61%; army and\r\n      navy, 3.26%; police, 4.09%; labor (in general), 7.32%; agriculture,\r\n      10.43%; navigation, 1.20%; railway, 1.14%; commerce, 10.47%;\r\n      students, 10.47%; teaching, 21.31%; independent professions, 1.66%;\r\n      social work, 1.68%; unemployed, O.54%; unclassified, 3.13%;\r\n      incomplete returns, 15.09%.\r\n\r\n  217 See above, pp. 59 and following.\r\n\r\n  218 Sun Yat-sen, _Kidnapped in London_, cited, _passim_.\r\n\r\n  219 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 122-123.\r\n\r\n  220 The present instances are all taken from the third lecture on\r\n      nationalism, d’Elia translation, cited pp. 127-128. The Hsü\r\n      translation, in spite of its many merits, is not strong on\r\n      geography. Thus, in the translation referring to Poland which has\r\n      just been cited, the Hsü reading runs: “Although Persia was\r\n      partitioned by foreigners over a century ago, Persian nationalism\r\n      was not lost; consequently the Persians have been able to restore\r\n      their country to independence; and now Persia has the status of a\r\n      second or third class power in Europe” (p. 208), this in spite of\r\n      the fact that Persia is translated correctly further on (p. 327).\r\n      Another misreading is: “After the war, two new Slavic states were\r\n      born, namely Czechoslovakia and Jugoslovakia” (p. 217). These minor\r\n      errors are, however, among the very few which can be discovered in\r\n      the whole book, and do not mar the text to any appreciable extent.\r\n\r\n  221 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 132.\r\n\r\n  222 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 63.\r\n\r\n  223 T’ang, cited, pp. 168 and following, gives the various documents of\r\n      the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, which place the\r\n      application of nationalism first in their programs. “The Manifesto\r\n      On Going to Peking,” issued by Sun November 10, 1924, refers to\r\n      various points to be achieved; the first is, “National freedom from\r\n      external restriction will enable China to develop her national\r\n      economy and to increase her productivity.” (Hsü translation, p.\r\n      148.) This might imply that the execution of _min shêng_ was to be\r\n      coincidental with or anterior to the fulfillment of nationalism; it\r\n      probably does not.\r\n\r\n  224 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 187.\r\n\r\n  225 Discussions of this are to be found in Sir Reginald Johnston’s\r\n      _Twilight in the Forbidden City_, cited.\r\n\r\n  226 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 244.\r\n\r\n  227 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 245-247.\r\n\r\n  228 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 187. Numerals have been written out by\r\n      the present author.\r\n\r\n  229 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 365. Italics are omitted.\r\n\r\n  230 This is not due to any mystical veneration of numbers, or religious\r\n      influence. In spreading doctrines which would have to be followed by\r\n      the unlettered as well as by the scholars, Sun Yat-sen found it\r\n      necessary to develop the general outline of his principles in such a\r\n      way as to give them a considerable mnemonic appeal. Thus, the three\r\n      principles—and the three French (liberty, equality, fraternity) and\r\n      American (of, by, for the people) principles—and the triple foreign\r\n      aggression, the four popular powers, the five governmental rights.\r\n      The use of the number three permitted Sun Yat-sen to weave together\r\n      the various strands of his teaching, and to attain a considerable\r\n      degree of cross-reference. It cannot be shown to have induced any\r\n      actual distortion of his theories.\r\n\r\n  231 Hsü translation, cited, p. 213.

The whole present discussion of\r\n      economic oppression is drawn from the latter part of the second\r\n      lecture. Except in the case of direct quotation, no further\r\n      reference will be given to this section, which occurs at pp. 97-115\r\n      of the d’Elia translation.\r\n\r\n  235 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 106.\r\n\r\n  236 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 113.\r\n\r\n  237 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 113.\r\n\r\n  238 In referring to a sub-principle, the author is following Sun\r\n      Yat-sen’s arrangement of his ideas, even though the exact term,\r\n      “sub-principle,” is not to be found in Sun’s works. Each of the\r\n      three principles can be considered with respect to national unity,\r\n      national autonomy, and national survival. The correlation of the\r\n      three principles, each with itself and then the two others,\r\n      logically leads to the appearance of nine sub-principles. The writer\r\n      has not followed any artificial compulsion of numbers, merely for\r\n      the sake of producing a pretty outline, but has followed Sun Yat-sen\r\n      in seeking to make clear the specific relations of each of the three\r\n      principles to the three cardinal points which they embody.\r\n\r\n  239 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 179-180.\r\n\r\n  240 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 180.\r\n\r\n  241 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 180.\r\n\r\n  242 Tsui, cited, pp. 113-114.\r\n\r\n  243 Linebarger, _Conversations_, cited, pp. 21 and following, Book I.\r\n\r\n  244 Among the persons whom he entrusted with the task of seeking foreign\r\n      capital for the just and honorable national development of China\r\n      through international means were George Bronson Rea and Paul\r\n      Linebarger. Mr. Rea was given a power of attorney by Sun to secure\r\n      loans for railway purposes to an unlimited amount. Mr. Rea never\r\n      used the document, but kept it among his papers. (Statement of Mr.\r\n      Rea to the author in Washington, spring of 1934, at the time that\r\n      the former was “Special Counsellor to the Ministry of Foreign\r\n      Affairs of Manchoukuo,” despite his former Chinese connections.)\r\n      Judge Linebarger was also unsuccessful. Sun Yat-sen was more\r\n      interested in having Judge Linebarger stop any assistance offered by\r\n      the Consortium to the Northern “Republic of China” than in having\r\n      him procure any actual funds.\r\n\r\n  245 It is obvious that a strong China would be a horrid nightmare to\r\n      Japan. Not only would the Chinese thwart the use of their man-power\r\n      and natural resources, as stepping stones to Asiatic or world\r\n      hegemony; they might even equal the Japanese in audacity, and think\r\n      of restoring the Japanese to the position of Chinese vassals which\r\n      they had enjoyed in the time of Yoshemitsu, the third Ashikaga\r\n      Shogun.\r\n\r\n  246 Tsui, cited, pp. 115-116.\r\n\r\n  247 Hu Han-min, cited in Tsui, work cited, p. 118, n. 63.\r\n\r\n  248 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 152.

The submission to China was, among\r\n      other things, a means by which the rulers of the peripheral states\r\n      could get themselves recognized by an authority higher than\r\n      themselves, thus legitimizing their position.\r\n\r\n  249 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 153. Sun Yat-sen seems to have had a\r\n      high opinion of the American administration of the Philippines,\r\n      saying: The United States “... even allows the Filipinos to send\r\n      delegations to Congress in Washington. Not only does the United\r\n      States require no annual tribute in money from them, but, on the\r\n      contrary, she gives the Filipinos considerable subsidies to build\r\n      and maintain their roads and to promote education. It seems as\r\n      though so humanitarian a treatment would be regarded as the utmost\r\n      benevolence. Still, until the present day, the Filipinos do not\r\n      boast of being ‘Americanized’; they are daily clamoring for\r\n      independence” (d’Elia translation, p. 153). This statement is\r\n      interesting in two connections. In the first place, although Sun\r\n      Yat-sen had once thought of sending men, money, or munitions to help\r\n      the Filipino nationalists in their struggles against the Americans,\r\n      he seems to have conceived a warm admiration for the American\r\n      administration in those islands. Secondly, the reader may consider\r\n      that Sun Yat-sen, at the time that he made this comment, was in the\r\n      course of attacking imperialism. If Sun Yat-sen could offer so\r\n      enthusiastic an apology for the Americans in the Philippines, it\r\n      shows that he must have let the abstract principle ride, and judged\r\n      only on the basis of his own observation. To the orthodox Communist\r\n      the American rule of the Philippines is peculiarly wicked because of\r\n      the American denial of imperialist practises.\r\n\r\n  250 Some of the older books on China give interesting maps of that\r\n      country divided up into spheres of influence between the various\r\n      powers. It was quite fashionable among journalists to sketch the\r\n      various Chinese possessions of the great powers; the powers never\r\n      got around to the partition. The American declaration of the “Open\r\n      Door” may have had something to do with this, and the British\r\n      enunciation of the same doctrine probably carried weight. For a\r\n      time, however, the Europeans seemed quite convinced of the almost\r\n      immediate break-up of China into three or four big colonies. Lord\r\n      Charles Beresford, a prominent English peer, wrote a work which was\r\n      extremely popular; its title was _The Break-Up of China_ (London,\r\n      1899).\r\n\r\n  251 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 93.\r\n\r\n  252 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 165.\r\n\r\n  253 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 165-170.\r\n\r\n  254 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 170.\r\n\r\n  255 The Communists envision three types of conflict to be produced by\r\n      the contradictions of imperialism: intra-national class war,\r\n      international class war, and inter-imperialist war. The first is the\r\n      struggle of the proletariat of the whole world against the various\r\n      national bourgeois governments; the second, the struggle of the\r\n      oppressed peoples, under revolutionary bourgeois or proletarian\r\n      leadership, against the oppressions of Western imperialism; and the\r\n      last, the conflict of the various imperialist powers with one\r\n      another. Sun Yat-sen’s theory agreed definitely with the second\r\n      point, the international class war; he seems to have admitted the\r\n      probability of class war within the nations of the West, and of\r\n      inter-imperialist war, but he did not draw the three types of\r\n      conflict together and because of them predicate an Armageddon and a\r\n      millenium. His flexible, pragmatic thought never ran to extremes;\r\n      although he agreed, more or less distinctly, with the Bolshevik\r\n      premises of the three conflicts of the imperialist epoch, he did not\r\n      follow them to their conclusion.\r\n\r\n  256 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 75.\r\n\r\n  257 d’Elia translation, cited, pp. 148-149.\r\n\r\n  258 Such works as Lea’s _The Valor of Ignorance_, New York, 1909, and\r\n      Stoddard’s _The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy_,\r\n      New York, 1920, make precisely the same sort of statements,\r\n      although, of course, they regard the “Saxon” or “Teutonic” race as\r\n      the logical master-race of the world. Since Lea was associated for\r\n      some time with Sun Yat-sen, accompanying him from Europe to Nanking\r\n      in 1911, and undoubtedly had plenty of time to talk with him, it may\r\n      be that some of the particular terms used by Sun in this discussion\r\n      are those which he may have developed in his probable conversations\r\n      with Lea. Nothing more definite than this can be stated.\r\n\r\n  259 Quoted by Sun in d’Elia translation, cited, p. 138. The remark does\r\n      not sound like Lenin. A Communist would not invoke nature, nor would\r\n      he count the whole membership of an imperialist nation as\r\n      imperialist. The world, to him, is misguided by a tiny handful of\r\n      capitalists and traditional ideologues and their hangers-on, not by\r\n      the masses of any nation.\r\n\r\n  260 Note, however, the reference in d’Elia translation, cited, p. 76, or\r\n      the Price translation, p. 18. Sun Yat-sen speaks of _international\r\n      wars, within_ races, on the lines of social _classes_. He may have\r\n      meant international wars within the races and across race lines on\r\n      the basis of the oppressed nations of the world fighting the\r\n      oppressing nations. He may, however, have meant intra-national class\r\n      wars. Since he recognized the presence of the class conflict in the\r\n      developed capitalistic states of the West, this would not\r\n      necessarily imply his expectation of an intra-national class war in\r\n      China.\r\n\r\n  261 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, pp. 331-337, gives the whole text of the\r\n      speech. Sharman, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 304, refers to it.\r\n\r\n  262 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 335. “Es ist gegen Gerechtigkeit und\r\n      Menschlichkeit, dass eine Minderheit von vierhundert Millionen eine\r\n      Mehrheit von neunhundert Millionen unterdrückt....”\r\n\r\n  263 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 333. “Die Europäer halten uns Asiaten\r\n      durch die Macht ihrer materiellen Errungenschaften zu Boden.”\r\n\r\n  264 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, cited, p. 333. “Wenn wir\r\n      zweitausendfünf-hundert Jahre zurückdenken, so war China damals das\r\n      mächtigste Volk der Welt. Es nahm damals eine Stellung ein wie heute\r\n      Grossbritannien und Amerika. Doch während Grossbritannien und die\r\n      Vereinigten Staaten heute zur zwei unter einer Reihe von Weltmächten\r\n      sind, war China damals die einzige grosse Macht.”\r\n\r\n  265 Ponce, work cited, p. xiv: “_Conozcámonos y nos amaremos más_—decía\r\n      el gran Sun Yat-sen á sus amigos orientales.” This work is, by the\r\n      way, the most extensive for its account of Sun’s associations with\r\n      Koreans, Filipinos, and Japanese. It has been completely overlooked\r\n      by the various biographers of and commentators on Sun, with the\r\n      exception of Judge Linebarger, to whom Sun Yat-sen presented a copy\r\n      of the work.\r\n\r\n  266 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 337: “In England und Amerika gibt es\r\n      immerhin eine kleine Zahl von Menschen, die diese unsere Ideale im\r\n      Einklang mit einer allgemeinen Weltbewegung verteidigen. Was die\r\n      anderen Barbarennationen anbelangt, so dürfte es auch in ihren\r\n      Reihen Menschen geben, die von der gleichen Überzeugung beseelt\r\n      sind.”\r\n\r\n  267 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 335: “Wenn wir Asiaten nach der\r\n      Herstellung einer panasiatischen Einheitsfront streben, müssen wir\r\n      selbst in unserer Zeit daran denken, auf welcher grundlegenden\r\n      Auffassung wir diese Einheitsfront errichten wollen. Wir sollen\r\n      dasjenige zugrunde legen, was die besondere Eigentümlichkeit unserer\r\n      östlichen Kultur gewesen ist, wir sollten unseren Nachdruck legen\r\n      auf die moralischen Werte, auf Güte und Gerechtigkeit. Sie sollen\r\n      das Fundament der Einheit ganz Asiens werden.”\r\n\r\n  268 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 207. Italics omitted.\r\n\r\n  269 The article by Tsui, cited, p. 177 and following, goes into a quite\r\n      detailed comparison of the Chinese Nationalist and the Marxian\r\n      Communist theories of the three stages of revolution. He draws\r\n      attention to the fact that, while the Communists do not speak of\r\n      \"three stages\" and prefer to emphasize the transitional stage of the\r\n      dictatorship of the proletariat, the two theories are similar almost\r\n      to the point of being identical.\r\n\r\n  270 Tsui, cited, p. 181.\r\n\r\n  271 Tyau, cited, p. 439 and following. It is also available in Hsü, _Sun\r\n      Yat-sen_, cited above, p. 85 and following. The Tyau translation was\r\n      preferred since it was written by an official of the Ministry of\r\n      Foreign Affairs, and may be regarded as the work of a Government\r\n      spokesman. It is interesting, by way of contrast, to quote a passage\r\n      from the Constitution of the Chinese Soviet Republic, so-called:\r\n      “The Chinese Soviet Government is building up a state of the\r\n      democratic dictatorship [sic!] of the workers and peasants. All\r\n      power shall be vested in the Soviets of Workers, Peasants, and Red\r\n      Army men.” _Fundamental Laws of the Chinese Soviet Republic_, New\r\n      York, 1934, p. 18. The absence of an acknowledged period of\r\n      tutelage, in view of the unfamiliarity of the Chinese people with\r\n      democratic forms, is significant. The constitutional jurisprudence\r\n      of the Chinese Communists is, however, primarily a matter of\r\n      academic interest, since the Soviets, where they have existed, have\r\n      existed in a state of perpetual emergency, shielded by the Red\r\n      Terror and other devices of revolutionary control. The contrast\r\n      between a pronouncement of Sun Yat-sen and a constitution is a fair\r\n      one, since the writings of Sun Yat-sen form the final authority in\r\n      the Nationalist movement and government; in a dispute as to the\r\n      higher validity of a governmental provision or a flat contrary\r\n      statement of Sun Yat-sen, there can be little question as to which\r\n      would—or, in the eyes of the Nationalists, should—prevail.\r\n\r\n  272 It is interesting to note that the institution which most Western\r\n      writers would incline to regard as the very key-stone of democracy,\r\n      parliament, has a quite inferior place in the Sun Yat-sen system. In\r\n      the National Government of China, the Legislative Yuan is more like\r\n      a department than like a chamber. This question, however, will be\r\n      discussed under the heading of the Five Rights.\r\n\r\n  273 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 341.\r\n\r\n  274 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 342.\r\n\r\n  275 A discussion of the four powers and the five rights is to be found\r\n      in Li Chao-wei, _La Souveraineté Nationale d’après la Doctrine\r\n      Politique de Sun-Yet-Sin_, Dijon, 1934. This work, a doctoral thesis\r\n      submitted to the University of Dijon, treats the Western theory of\r\n      democracy and Sun’s theory comparatively. It is excellent in\r\n      portraying the legal outline of the Chinese governmental structure,\r\n      and points out many significant analogies between the two theories.\r\n\r\n  276 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 391.\r\n\r\n  277 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 395.\r\n\r\n  278 The unfavorable view of the Five Powers is taken by Dr. Jermyn\r\n      Chi-hung Lynn in his excellent little book, _Political Parties in\r\n      China_, Peiping, 1930. Since Dr. Lynn speaks kindly and hopefully of\r\n      the plans of Wu Pei-fu, one of the war-lords hostile to Sun Yat-sen\r\n      and the whole Nationalist movement, his criticism of Sun Yat-sen\r\n      need not be taken as completely impartial. It represents a point\r\n      that has been made time and time again by persons antagonistic to\r\n      the _San Min Chu I_.\r\n\r\n      “The Wu Chuan Hsien Fa is also no discovery of Dr. Sun’s. As is\r\n      known, the three power constitution, consisting of the legislative,\r\n      judiciary [sic!] and executive functions, was originally developed,\r\n      more or less unconsciously, by the English, whose constitution was\r\n      critically examined by Montesquieu, and its working elaborately\r\n      described by him for the benefit of his fellow-countrymen. And the\r\n      unwritten constitution of Old China contained the civil service\r\n      examination and an independent Board of Censors. Now the\r\n      much-advertised Wu Chuan Hsien Fa or Five-Power constitution only\r\n      added the systems of state examination and public censure to the\r\n      traditional form of constitution first advocated by the French\r\n      jurist.” P. 66, work cited.\r\n\r\n  279 Hsü translation, cited, p. 104.\r\n\r\n  280 For an intensively vivid description of this government, which Sun\r\n      Yat-sen’s planned democracy was to relegate to limbo, see B.

Putnam Weale was\r\n      the pseudonym of Bertram Lennox Simpson, an Englishman born and\r\n      reared in China, who understood and participated in Chinese life and\r\n      policies as have few since the days of Marco Polo; he was an advisor\r\n      to the insurrectionary Peking “Nationalist” Government of 1931 when\r\n      he was shot to death in his home at Tientsin. Few other Westerners\r\n      have left such a wealth of accurate and sympathetic material about\r\n      modern China.\r\n\r\n  281 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 399.\r\n\r\n  282 Harold Monk Vinacke, _Modern Constitutional Development in China_,\r\n      Princeton, 1920, p. 100.\r\n\r\n  283 Vinacke, cited, p. 141 and following. While Dr. Vinacke’s book is\r\n      now out of date, it contains excellent material for the period\r\n      covered, roughly 1898 to 1919. He quotes Morse’s comment on the\r\n      provinces with approval: “The Provinces are satrapies to the extent\r\n      that so long as the tribute and matriculations are duly paid, and\r\n      the general policy of the central administration followed, they are\r\n      free to administer their own affairs in detail as may seem best to\r\n      their own provincial authorities.” (Hosea Ballou Morse, _The Trade\r\n      and Administration of China_, London, 1913, p. 46, quoted in\r\n      Vinacke, work cited, p. 5.)\r\n\r\n  284 Paul M.

Lenin’s\r\n      discussion of Marx’s point, p. 39 and following, is stimulating\r\n      although inclining to the ingenious.\r\n\r\n  289 The number of the villages is taken from Tawney, Richard Henry,\r\n      _Land and Labor in China_, London, 1932; and the number of _hsien_\r\n      from Tyau, cited, p. 85.\r\n\r\n  290 Linebarger, _Conversations_, cited above; throughout this volume,\r\n      Judge Linebarger recalls references made by Sun Yat-sen to him\r\n      concerning the _hsien_.\r\n\r\n  291 It is but fair to state, at the beginning, that this point of the\r\n      family system as one of the institutions of the democratic nation\r\n      has been very largely neglected by the Kuomintang and the National\r\n      Government. To the knowledge of the author, no plan has ever been\r\n      drafted either by Party or by Government which would erect the\r\n      system that Sun Yat-sen proposed. It is not beyond all conjecture\r\n      that Sun’s suggestion may at a later date seem more practicable to\r\n      the leaders than now appears, and be put into operation in some\r\n      manner.\r\n\r\n  292 Hsü, cited, p. 164.\r\n\r\n  293 Hsü, cited, p. 243.\r\n\r\n  294 The material concerning the clans has been taken from the fifth\r\n      lecture on Nationalism (Hsü, cited, p. 240 and following; d’Elia,\r\n      cited, p. 174 and following). Judge Linebarger recorded Sun\r\n      Yat-sen’s mention of a convention of the clans in _Conversations_,\r\n      cited above, Book One, Chapter Eight, “The Clans in the Nation.”\r\n\r\n  295 There are three excellent discussions of the _min shêng_ programs.\r\n      Wou, cited, gives a clear precis of the doctrine. Hung Jair, _Les\r\n      idées économiques de Sun Yat Sen_, Toulouse, 1934, and Tsiang Kuen,\r\n      _Les origines économiques et politiques du socialisme de Sun Yat\r\n      Sen_, Paris, 1933, cover essentially the same ground, although they\r\n      are both doctoral dissertations submitted to French universities.\r\n      The former deals primarily with the theory of Sun’s economic ideas,\r\n      contrasting them with the economic thought of Adam Smith and of the\r\n      Marxians. The latter gives a rather extensive historical and\r\n      statistical background to Sun’s _min shêng_, and traces the Chinese\r\n      economic system, whence _min shêng_ was derived in part, quite\r\n      fully. These authors have covered the field so widely that the\r\n      present work need not enter into the discussion of the precise\r\n      immediate policies to be advocated under _min shêng_. Enough will be\r\n      given to describe the relations of _min shêng_ with the more\r\n      formally political principles of nationalism and democracy, and to\r\n      afford the reader an opportunity to assess its scope and\r\n      significance for himself. The works of Hung Jair, Tsiang Kuen, Wou\r\n      Saofong, and Li Ti-tsun all measure _min shêng_ in terms of\r\n      classical Western _laissez-faire_ economics and then in terms of\r\n      Marxism; they all proceed in considerable detail to recapitulate the\r\n      various concrete plans that Sun projected. The present author will\r\n      not enter into the minutiae of the problems of clothing, of\r\n      transport, of communications, etc., inasmuch as they have already\r\n      been dealt with and because they are not directly relevant to the\r\n      political or ideological features of Sun’s thought.\r\n\r\n  296 Tsui, cited, p. 378, n. 125.\r\n\r\n_  297 The International Development of China_ was welcomed as an\r\n      interesting fantasy in a world which had not yet heard of the Five\r\n      Year Plans and the programs of the New Deal. The fact that Sun\r\n      Yat-sen was a few years ahead of his contemporaries gave him the air\r\n      of a dreamer, which was scarcely deserved.\r\n\r\n  298 Hsü translation, “The Outline of National Reconstruction,” p. 85.\r\n      Two points of detail may be noted here. In the first place, _min\r\n      shêng_ has been emphasized by being placed first, although Sun\r\n      Yat-sen generally arranged his principles in their logical order:\r\n      nationalism, democracy, _min shêng_. Secondly, _min shêng_, although\r\n      emphasized, is dealt with in one single paragraph in this vitally\r\n      important document. The question of the _hsien_ is given eight\r\n      paragraphs to the one on _min shêng_. This is indicative of the\r\n      point stressed above, namely, that Sun Yat-sen, while he was sure of\r\n      the importance of _min shêng_, did not believe in hard and fast\r\n      rules concerning its development.\r\n\r\n  299 Work cited, p. 232.\r\n\r\n  300 See above, p. 180 ff.\r\n\r\n  301 The author uses the term “national economic revolution” to\r\n      distinguish those parts of the _ming shêng chu i_ which treat the\r\n      transformation of the Chinese economy in relation to the development\r\n      of a nation-state. Obviously, there is a great difference between\r\n      the economy of a society regarding itself as ecumenical, and one\r\n      faced with the problem of dealing with other equal societies. The\r\n      presence of a state implies a certain minimum of state interference\r\n      with economic matters; the national economic revolution of Sun\r\n      Yat-sen was to give the Chinese economy a national character,\r\n      coordinating the economic with the other programs of nationalism.\r\n      Hence, the significant stress in the phrase “national economic\r\n      revolution” should rest upon the word “national.”\r\n\r\n  302 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, cited, p. 329. “Genossen, die hier\r\n      Versammelten sind alle Arbeiter und stellen eine Teil der Nation\r\n      dar. Auf den chinesischen Arbeitern lastet eine grosse Verantwortung\r\n      und wenn ihr dieser Aufgabe entsprechen werdet, so wird China eine\r\n      grosse Nation und ihr eine mächtige Arbeiterklasse.”\r\n\r\n  303 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 329. “Ausser dem wirtschaftlichen Kampf\r\n      für die Kürzung des Arbeitstages und die Erhöhung der Löhne stehen\r\n      vor Euch noch viel wichtigere Fragen von politischem Charakter.

The\r\n      same observation had been made to the Russian ambassador,\r\n      Vladislavich, sent by Catherine I to Peking in 1727. The Chinese\r\n      said at that time, “ ... that foreign trade had no attraction for\r\n      the people, who were amply supplied with all the necessaries of life\r\n      from the products of their own country.” Sir Robert K.

Sun Yat-sen discussed only two\r\n      of these essentials (food, clothing) in his lectures on the _San Min\r\n      Chu I_. According to Tai Chi-tao, he was to have continued to speak\r\n      on the topics of “Housing,” “Health,” “Death,” “Conclusions on\r\n      Livelihood,” and “Conclusions on the San Min Doctrine,” but the only\r\n      person who may know what he intended to say on these subjects is\r\n      Mme. Sun Yat-sen. (See Hsü translation, “The Basic Literature of\r\n      Sunyatsenism,” pp. 39-40.)\r\n\r\n  314 This is based upon statements made by Judge Linebarger to the\r\n      author. According to him, Sun Yat-sen had few of the prejudices of\r\n      class, one way or the other, that affect the outlook of so many\r\n      Western leaders. He did not believe that the only possible solution\r\n      to the problem of livelihood was the Marxian one, and was confident\r\n      that the Chinese Nationalists would be able to solve the problem.\r\n      This question was to him paramount above all others; the life of the\r\n      masses of Chinese citizens was the life of China itself.\r\n\r\n_  315 International Development_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n  316 The same, p. 11.\r\n\r\n  317 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 326. The discussion of Bismarck runs\r\n      from p. 322 to 326; the length of the discussion shows what Sun\r\n      thinks of Bismarck’s acuteness, although he disapproved of\r\n      Bismarck’s anti-democratic stand.\r\n\r\n_  318 International Development_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n  319 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 426.\r\n\r\n  320 Price translation, pp. 434-435. In the d’Elia translation, pp.\r\n      465-466. The Price translation has been quoted in this instance\r\n      because Father d’Elia translates _min shêng_ as “the economic\r\n      Demism,” which—although interesting when used consistently—might not\r\n      be clear in its present context. Sun Yat-sen’s courteous use of the\r\n      word “communism,” in view of the Canton-Moscow entente then\r\n      existing, has caused a great deal of confusion. The reader may judge\r\n      for himself how much Sun’s policy constitutes communism.\r\n\r\n  321 One or two further points concerning the land policy may be\r\n      mentioned. In the first place, it is the land which is to be taxed.\r\n      A tax will be applied, according to this theory, on the land, and\r\n      the increment will also be confiscated. These are two separate forms\r\n      of revenue. Furthermore, lest all land-holders simply surrender\r\n      their land to the government, Sun makes clear that his taxation\r\n      program applies only to land. It would consequently be quite\r\n      advantageous for the owner to keep the land; the buildings on it\r\n      would not be affected by the increment-seizure program, and the land\r\n      would be worth keeping. “The value of the land as declared at\r\n      present by the landowner will still remain the property of each\r\n      individual landowner.” (d’Elia translation, p. 466; Father d’Elia’s\r\n      note on this page is informing.) The landowner might conceivably put\r\n      a mortgage on the land to pay the government the amount of the\r\n      unearned increment, and still make a handsome enough profit from the\r\n      use of the land to amortize the mortgage.\r\n\r\n  322 Linebarger, _Conversations_, Book III, p. 25.\r\n\r\n  323 Wittfogel, _Sun Yat-sen_, p. 328. “Die chinesischen Kapitalisten\r\n      sind nicht so stark, dass sie die chinesischen Arbeiter unterdrücken\r\n      könnten.”\r\n\r\n  324 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 469. Italics omitted. For the\r\n      discussion of the relation of the program of _min shêng_ to\r\n      capitalism, see d’Elia’s various footnotes and appendices dealing\r\n      with the subject. Father d’Elia, as a devout Catholic, does a\r\n      thorough piece of work in demonstrating that Sun Yat-sen was not a\r\n      Bolshevik and not hostile to the Roman Catholic Church, and had a\r\n      warm although infrequently expressed admiration for that\r\n      organization. Li Ti-tsun, in “The Sunyatsenian Principle of\r\n      Livelihood,” cited, tries to find the exact shade of left\r\n      orientation in _min shêng_, and digests the main policies. Wou and\r\n      Tsui, both cited, also discuss this point.\r\n\r\n_  325 International Development_, pp. 36-39.\r\n\r\n  326 By an irony of fate, the most conspicuous example of the realization\r\n      of any one of these plans was the beginning of the port of Hulutao,\r\n      which was to be “The Great Northern Port” of Sun’s vision. The\r\n      National Government had already started work on this port when the\r\n      Japanese, invading Manchuria, took it. There is so much pathos in\r\n      Sun’s own life that this frustation of his plans after his death\r\n      seems disappointing beyond words to his followers. In his own trust\r\n      in mankind, in the eagerness and the sincerity of his enthusiasms,\r\n      in the grandeur of his vision—here are to be found the most vital\r\n      clues to the tragedy of Sun Yat-sen. Like the other great founders\r\n      of the earth’s ideals, he charted worlds within the vision but,\r\n      perhaps, beyond the accomplishment of ordinary men.\r\n\r\n  327 Hsü translation, cited, p. 440; Price translation, p. 444; d’Elia\r\n      translation, cited, p. 476. The first has been preferred purely as a\r\n      matter of style. The Chinese words _min shêng_ and _San Min Chu I_\r\n      have been used instead of the English renderings which Hsü gives,\r\n      again as a pure matter of form and consistency with the text.\r\n\r\n  328 The author is indebted to Mr. Jên Tai for the clarification of this\r\n      ideal of dual continuity—of the family system, preserving the flesh,\r\n      and the intellectual tradition, preserving the cultural heritages.\r\n\r\n  329 d’Elia translation, cited, p. 538.",
