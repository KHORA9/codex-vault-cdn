Maugras, has unearthed a very curious\r\n    love-story, deposited by the ‘guilty couple’s’ own hands,\r\n    relating to the Duke of Orleans, later Philippe-Egalité, and\r\n    the governess of his children, the virtuous and pedagogic Mme.\r\n    de Genlis.[1]\r\n\r\n    “In consequence of this _liaison_, Mme. de Genlis was made\r\n    Captain of the Guards; and the ‘governess’ of the future\r\n    Louis-Philippe and Mme. Adélaïde gave birth to two charming\r\n    little daughters, who were brought up in England and known as\r\n    Pamela and Miss Campton.\r\n\r\n    “Mme. de Genlis was also the mother of a legitimate daughter,\r\n    who later on married M. de Valence. Mme. de Valence was to have\r\n    for her son-in-law the Maréchal Gérard, lineal ancestor of the\r\n    brilliant poetess, Rosemonde Gérard.\r\n\r\n    “On the other hand, Miss Campton married a Gascon, M. Collard,\r\n    and was grandmother to Marie Cappelle (Mme. Lafarge).\r\n\r\n    “Thus, by legitimate descent, Mme. de Genlis is the ancestress\r\n    of Rosemonde Rostand, and, illegitimate, of Mme. Lafarge.\r\n\r\n    “The latter wrote six thousand letters, not to speak of her\r\n    _Mémoires_ and her _Heures de Prison_.\r\n\r\n    “As for the author of the play, _Un Bon Petit Diable_, ‘he’\r\n    proposed nothing less than to tune his pipe to all history and\r\n    legend, in spite of what his own descent might imply.…\r\n\r\n    “The heritage of the Governess of the Children of France has\r\n    not fallen to the distaff side.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, March 18, the same journal published this other article,\r\nwhich impartiality obliges us to reproduce here—\r\n\r\n    “Through the assiduous researches of a pious inquirer into the\r\n    things of the past, the _Mercure de France_ has just published\r\n    a touching series of letters, written by Mme. Lafarge from\r\n    her prison at Montpellier, to her Director, l’Abbé Brunet,\r\n    residing in the Bishop’s Palace at Limoges. This is a twofold\r\n    revelation, in that it testifies both to the delicate skill\r\n    of the writer and the innocence of the accused, but the\r\n    correspondence is unfortunately incomplete.\r\n\r\n    “Some of these letters were given to M. Boyer d’Agen by M.\r\n    Albris Body, Keeper of the Records at Spa in Belgium; others\r\n    were discovered amongst the posthumous papers of Zaleski, the\r\n    classic poet of the Ukraine; those that remain are doubtless\r\n    buried in the dusty catacombs of some library.… It could be\r\n    wished that one of those lucky chances which are the providence\r\n    of the erudite might allow of their disinterment.”\r\n\r\nTo complete this and prove something definite, these two quotations ought\r\nto be accompanied by a third which I take from one of the letters given\r\nby _Le Matin_, in which the celebrated Mme. Lafarge ventures to disclose\r\nthe secret reason for her notorious misfortunes by at last revealing\r\nthe mystery of her illegitimate origin, which, through the house of\r\nOrleans, of which her grandmother was issue, made her a near relation of\r\nLouis-Philippe, who during his reign, moved by fear, permitted the trial\r\nof this cousin by blood, whom he dared not have acquitted after ten years\r\nof imprisonment.\r\n\r\n“The Queen charged the Maréchale Gérard,” writes Marie Cappelle in this\r\npainful confession, “to tell me that she would make it her business to\r\ninterest herself in me. She went herself to speak to the Ministers. It\r\nwas last spring (1848), and the men condemned for the riots at Basanceney\r\nhad just been executed. The Ministers said that there would be an\r\noutcry, that it would get mixed up with politics; _that the left-handed\r\nrelationship_ that was suspected would be exploited by parties and\r\nnewspapers. In the month of August there was some hope; but the Praslin\r\naffair put a stop to everything. Now, I don’t know what has become of the\r\ngoodwill of our saintly Queen; I don’t know if the Maréchale (Gérard)\r\nseriously means to carry out all the provisions of her poor mother’s\r\n(Mme. de Valence) bequest. I have not written to her. It is painful to\r\nme to address prayers to men; I scorn to ask for pardon when I have the\r\nright to ask for justice.”\r\n\r\nThe rest is known. Four years later, on June 1, 1852, Napoleon III opened\r\na door Louis-Philippe had kept closed during the whole of his reign,\r\nand Marie Cappelle left her prison at Montpellier to go and die of\r\nexhaustion, four months later, at the little hot-spring town of Ussat,\r\nwhich could not give her back her lost life.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was counting, letter by letter, the steps to Calvary\r\nclimbed by this poor woman, and which, letter by letter, may be followed\r\nin a forthcoming book which is to contain all that I have been able to\r\ncollect to the honour of this possessor of so fine an intelligence and so\r\npolished a style; when, all of a sudden, the episode of Marie Cappelle\r\nreminded me of that of Lorenzo Chiappini—with the house of Orleans as the\r\norigin of those doubtful births and as the clue to these yet unsolved\r\nhistorical enigmas.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Orleans Chiappini affair?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1902 I was rummaging amongst the Archives of the\r\nVatican, of whose secular secrets Pope Leo XIII, of august memory, had\r\nmade an end by opening them to the world of inquirers, with no fear that\r\nthe dangerous resurrection of this Lazarus of history would be for that\r\nliberal Pontiff—as it was for the Divine Miracle-worker of Bethany—the\r\nprelude to the maledictions of a scandalized Sanhedrin, and to another\r\npainful Passion—a renewal of that of old.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the _crucifigation_ of the Pharisees—those lovers of\r\ndarkness and the unfathomable crimes of secret history—I took pleasure,\r\nas a simple Publican and lover of the light, in admiring the daylight\r\nmaking its cheerful way under the corniced vaults of the _Archivio\r\nSegreto_, and disclosing those files of dusty manuscripts, which, each\r\nstripping off his registered shirt, emerge naked from the tomb at the\r\ncall of the first passer-by who, recognizing his dead, simply says, “Come\r\nforth!” and they come.\r\n\r\nStanding before those desks over those deep tomblike cases of archives\r\nwherein slumber the secrets of the dead, my ears open to the miraculous,\r\n“Lazarus, come forth!” which the patient seekers for silent memories are\r\nprepared to utter at the turning of each yellow leaf, I let my dreaming\r\neye, that afternoon, rest upon a ray of that Roman sunshine, as, with its\r\nsoft radiance, it gave life to the solitude of a vault, scattering its\r\nriches broadcast through the windows, prodigal as the gambler staking\r\nwith both hands just for the pleasure of playing, and losing.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been using in your service the time you waste here!” said a\r\nsearcher in this Vatican vault, as he came and sat down at my work-table.\r\nHe is one who knows all the treasures of the place, since he has\r\nfrequented it for over thirty years, working for the most learned of the\r\nbest Reviews—the _Civilta Cattolica_, to which my honourable colleague is\r\none of the most authoritative contributors.… “Well, what do they say in\r\nParis about Louis-Philippe?”\r\n\r\n“That he has been dead for some time!” I could not help answering, with a\r\nlaugh at this not over-retrospective interruption.\r\n\r\n“But is it known how he was born?” continued my interlocutor, more\r\nmysteriously than if he were simply talking nonsense; and without\r\nanother word, “Here!” he added; “read this letter. I found it amongst the\r\npapers of Cardinal Joseph Albani, whom the celebrated Secretary of State\r\nChateaubriand used to visit during his Embassy to Rome, and of whom he\r\nhas left, in his _Mémoires d’outre-Tombe_, a witty enough portrait. Read\r\nthis document; it is well worth while.” In the Secret Archives of the\r\nVatican it is inscribed (B. 43242, anno 1830)—\r\n\r\n    CARDINAL MACCHI to CARDINAL ALBANI, Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n                                         “_Ravenna, Nov. 19, 1830._\r\n\r\n    “EMˢˢⁱᵐᵉ MAÎTRE,\r\n\r\n    “Enclosed in this letter you will find a copy of the decision,\r\n    given on May 29, 1824, by the Episcopal Tribunal of Faenza,\r\n    in favour of the Lady Maria Newborough, Baronne de Sternberg,\r\n    by the terms of which it is declared that this person is the\r\n    daughter of the Comte and the Comtesse de Joinville, and not\r\n    the daughter of the two Chiappinis. The documents concerning\r\n    this affair are pretty numerous, but there is no mention\r\n    made of the Orleans family. It is true that the aforesaid\r\n    title of Joinville belongs to that Royal Family, and is borne\r\n    at the present time, if I am not mistaken, by the daughter,\r\n    born fourth of the family. It is true, likewise, that it is\r\n    generally believed here that the Comte de Joinville was no\r\n    other than the famous Duc d’Orléans-Egalité.\r\n\r\n    “Moreover, not only is there no proof that the Duc d’Orléans\r\n    was travelling in Italy in 1773, but, on the contrary, we read\r\n    in his biography that in 1778 he travelled in Italy in the\r\n    company of the Duchess.\r\n\r\n    “I notice, besides, that Lady Newborough was born at Modigliana\r\n    on April 17, 1773, and that the present King of France was born\r\n    six months later. How, then, could the supposed exchange have\r\n    been managed? It seems to me that this is a mere fable which\r\n    might, and not a little, compromise us. I should advise your\r\n    Eminence to claim those documents from the Tribunal of Faenza,\r\n    so as to keep them from the public eye and in Rome.\r\n\r\n    “Having thus carried out your esteemed orders, I pray your\r\n    Eminence to accept the humble expression of the profound\r\n    respect with which, etc.\r\n\r\n                                      “Signed: V. CARDINAL MACCHI.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, as I returned the folio to its obliging discoverer, “it\r\nseems to me that this letter is conclusive, and that the Louis-Philippe\r\nChiappini case is settled as soon as heard.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, because it has not yet been heard. You are stopping your\r\nears, like the _Eminentissimo_ Macchi, Cardinal-Legate of Ravenna, who\r\ndid not want to hear any more of the affair. But no, no!—and besides,\r\nyou haven’t the same excuse. Would you like, in connection with this\r\nletter, to read the document that goes with it? It is the Italian text\r\nof the sentence solemnly pronounced by the Episcopal Tribunal of Faenza,\r\non the 29th of May, 1824; fifty years after this criminal business; all\r\nsurviving witnesses heard; all inquiries scrupulously made; the Holy\r\nTrinity invoked in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.…”\r\n\r\n“The devil!” I ventured to exclaim, at a matter beginning with so\r\nsacramental a formula.\r\n\r\nAnd I read in Italian what I am going to give here in a translation, and\r\nthe number of which, 43-242, is that of its place in the Secret Archives\r\nof the Vatican.\r\n\r\n    “Having invoked the most holy Name of God:\r\n\r\n    “We, seated in our Tribunal, and having before our eyes\r\n    nothing but God and justice, by our final decision from the\r\n    pleadings of the lawyers and the documents, we deliver judgment\r\n    on the action or actions debated before us in the inferior\r\n    or any other higher Court, between her Excellency Marie\r\n    Newborough-Sternberg, the Plaintiff, on the one part, and M. le\r\n    Comte Charles Bandini on the other, acting as legally delegated\r\n    trustee to represent M.M. le Comte Louis and la Comtesse de\r\n    Joinville, and any other absent person who has, or claims to\r\n    have, any interest in the case; these two parties to it having\r\n    submitted to jurisdiction, in default of the _Excellentissime_\r\n    M. le Docteur Thomas Chiappini, domiciled at Florence, who has\r\n    not so submitted himself.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, before our Episcopal Curia acting as a Tribunal\r\n    competent to judge the ecclesiastic cases named below submitted\r\n    to their jurisdiction, the Plaintiff has asked that orders may\r\n    be given, by means of suitable alteration, to correct her\r\n    baptismal certificate, etc.\r\n\r\n    “That, on the part of the delegated Trustee Defendant, it\r\n    is asked that the Plaintiff’s claim should be rejected and\r\n    the costs repaid. That the other proper Defendant, Doctor\r\n    Chiappini, has not submitted to jurisdiction, though, according\r\n    to the custom of this Curia, he has been twice summoned by a\r\n    Sheriff of the Episcopal Tribunal of Florence, and that the\r\n    report of contumacy has been added to the decision on the suit.\r\n\r\n    “Considering the documents, etc.\r\n\r\n    “Having heard the respective counsel, etc.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas Lorenzo Chiappini, being near his end, did, in a\r\n    letter which was given to the Plaintiff after the decease of\r\n    the aforesaid Chiappini, reveal to the same Plaintiff the\r\n    secret of her birth, by clearly making known to her that she\r\n    was not his daughter, but the daughter of a person he declared\r\n    he could not name.\r\n\r\n    “That it has been legally acknowledged by the experts that this\r\n    letter is written in the hand of Lorenzo Chiappini.\r\n\r\n    “That the word of a dying man is proof in full, since he has no\r\n    longer any interest in lying, and it is to be presumed that he\r\n    is thinking only of his eternal salvation.\r\n\r\n    “That such a confession ought to be looked upon as a solemn\r\n    oath, and as a bequest made for the good of his soul and his\r\n    own salvation.\r\n\r\n    “That the Trustee would vainly endeavour to deprive the said\r\n    letter of its force, on account of its containing no indication\r\n    as to who were the real father and mother of the Plaintiff;\r\n    since although, in fact, such indication is really wanting,\r\n    recourse has been had, on the part of this same Plaintiff, to\r\n    the testimony of witnesses, to presumptions and conjectures.\r\n\r\n    “That, where there exists in writing a beginning of proof, as\r\n    in the present case, it is allowable, even in State questions,\r\n    to introduce testimonial proof and all other evidence.\r\n\r\n    “That if, in questions of State, after the original written\r\n    proof, that by means of witnesses is admissible; there is still\r\n    stronger reason to accept the same proof in this case when a\r\n    document is produced to be used in the question of State.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, from the sworn legal depositions of the sisters,\r\n    Maria and Dominica Bandini, it is clearly shown that there\r\n    was an agreement between M. le Comte and le Sieur Chiappini to\r\n    exchange their respective children, should Mme. la Comtesse\r\n    give birth to a girl and Chiappini’s wife to a boy; that the\r\n    agreed exchange did really take place, the case having been\r\n    provided for; that the girl was baptized in the church of the\r\n    Priory at Modigliana, by the name of Maria Stella, and falsely\r\n    registered as the daughter of the Chiappini couple.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas the said witnesses swear as to the time of the\r\n    exchange as coinciding with that of the Plaintiff’s birth.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, the Trustee, likewise in vain, urges the\r\n    improbability of this evidence; since, not only no\r\n    improbability is to be met with in the witnesses’ statement,\r\n    but, on the contrary, it is upheld and verified by a great\r\n    number of other presumptions and conjectures.\r\n\r\n    “That one very forcible conjecture is deduced by the public\r\n    voice and the rumours which were then spread as to the fact of\r\n    the exchange.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, this rumour is proved, not only by the testimony of\r\n    the aforesaid sisters Bandini, but also by the attestation\r\n    of M. Dominique Della Valle, and that of other witnesses in\r\n    Brisighella and Ravenna, all equally judicially examined in\r\n    their own towns and before their respective tribunals.\r\n\r\n    “That the vicissitudes to which M. le Comte was exposed are a\r\n    convincing proof of the reality of the exchange.\r\n\r\n    “That there is documentary proof that in consequence of the\r\n    rumours spread abroad in Modigliana concerning the exchange in\r\n    question, the Comte de Joinville was forced to leave that place\r\n    and take refuge in the Convent of St. Bernard at Brisighella;\r\n    that having gone out for a walk, he was arrested, taken to, and\r\n    kept some time in, the Public Palace of Justice of Brisighella,\r\n    and that afterwards he was conducted by the Swiss Guards of\r\n    Ravenna before his Eminence the Cardinal-Legate, who set him at\r\n    liberty, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, Querzani, of Brisighella, swears to having shaved a\r\n    great French nobleman who was for some time living in seclusion\r\n    in the Convent of St. Bernard at Brisighella.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, in the evidence of the aforesaid Della Valle, he\r\n    declares that, while he was assisting in making out the\r\n    inventory of the aforesaid Convent of St. Bernard, he saw two\r\n    letters signed ‘le Comte de Joinville’; that one of these was\r\n    dated from Modigliana, and that in it the writer thanked the\r\n    Abbot of St. Bernard’s for having allowed him to retire into\r\n    his convent; that, in the other letter, dated from Ravenna, the\r\n    same correspondent tells of his liberation to the same Abbot;\r\n    that both these letters bore the date of 1773.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, one of the soldiers charged with the surveillance\r\n    of the Count at Brisighella during his stay at the Palace of\r\n    Justice of that town, is still living, which soldier has given\r\n    evidence on the subject judicially and of his own free will.\r\n\r\n    “That M. le Comte Nicolas Biancoli-Borghi testifies in his\r\n    judicial examination that, while he was looking through old\r\n    papers of the Borghi house, he came upon a letter written from\r\n    Turin to M. le Comte Pompeo-Borghi, the date of which he could\r\n    not remember, signed Louis C. Joinville, which said that the\r\n    _exchanged child was dead and that there was now nothing more\r\n    to fear on its account_.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, the same Count Biancoli-Borghi alleges his own\r\n    knowledge to be the motive of his evidence, etc.\r\n\r\n    “That the exchange is proved also by the change in the fortunes\r\n    of Chiappini, etc.\r\n\r\n    “That in fact, after this event, Chiappini paid ready money\r\n    for the cereals needed for the support of his family, and that\r\n    he bought them at the Borghi place of business, while before\r\n    that time he had discharged his debts by the giving up of his\r\n    monthly pay; which Biancoli-Borghi testifies to having found as\r\n    a fact in the books of the Borghi firm.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, it is proved beyond doubt by many documents that\r\n    Chiappini, after he retired to Florence, acquired means that\r\n    enabled him to live at ease, as the sisters Bandini and other\r\n    witnesses testify.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, the Sieur Della Valle asserts that he saw Chiappini\r\n    at Florence in flourishing circumstances, and that, moreover,\r\n    the same Chiappini spoke of the exchange to a certain Sieur D.\r\n    Bandini of Verifolo who was often in his company, as the same\r\n    Bandini declared to Della Valle.\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, the Plaintiff received an education suited to her\r\n    distinguished rank, and not such as would have been given to\r\n    the daughter of a jailer, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    “That, it clearly follows in view of all the matters up to now\r\n    alleged and of many others existing in the documents, that\r\n    Maria Stella was falsely described in her certificate of birth\r\n    as being the daughter of the Chiappini husband and wife, and\r\n    that she owes her birth to M. le Comte and Mme. la Comtesse de\r\n    Joinville.\r\n\r\n    “That, in consequence, it is a matter of justice to grant the\r\n    correction of the certificate of birth now claimed by this same\r\n    Maria Stella.\r\n\r\n    “Finally, that M. le Docteur Chiappini, instead of opposing the\r\n    claim, is guilty of contumacy.\r\n\r\n    “Having repeated the most holy Name of God, we declare,\r\n    decree, and give final judgment, that the pleas of the\r\n    aforesaid delegated Trustee must be rejected, as we reject\r\n    them; we desire and order that they be held as annulled; and,\r\n    in consequence, we have declared, decreed and given final\r\n    judgment, that the certificate of birth of April 17, 1773,\r\n    inscribed in the Baptismal Registers of the Prioral Church of\r\n    St. Stephen, Pope and Martyr, at Modigliana, in the Diocese\r\n    of Faenza, wherein Maria Stella is described as the daughter\r\n    of Lorenzo Chiappini and Vincenzia Viligenti, be corrected;\r\n    and that, on the contrary, she is to be described as the\r\n    daughter of M. le Comte Louis and Mme. la Comtesse N. de\r\n    Joinville, French; to which end we have likewise decreed that\r\n    the rectification in question shall be executed officially by\r\n    our Registrar, also empowering M. le Prieur, of the Church of\r\n    St. Stephen, Pope and Martyr, at Modigliana, in the Diocese of\r\n    Faenza, to give copies of the rectified and corrected paper to\r\n    all such as may ask for it, etc.\r\n\r\n                                     “LE CHANOINE PRÉVOT,\r\n\r\n                             “VALERIO BOSCHI, PRO-VICAIRE GÉNÉRAL.”\r\n\r\n“The devil! the devil!” I repeated, astonishment increasing by leaps and\r\nbounds in the face of two such grave and contradictory statements. Was\r\nthe Cardinal of Ravenna wrong? Was the Bishop of Faenza right? And did\r\none ever see a scarlet-clad Eminence break a more vigorous rod over the\r\nviolet-clad shoulders of a Counsel of Prelates than this reversion of\r\na decree so solemnly pronounced, a few years earlier, before a plenary\r\ncourt of all the officers of a diocese?\r\n\r\n“You forget,” answered my colleague, “that the then Legate of Ravenna\r\nhad been Nuncio at Paris under Charles X, and a special friend of the\r\nKing’s. So great a friend that the pasquinades on the Conclaves of 1829\r\nand 1830, at which this Cardinal was present, always called him the\r\n‘_Joueur de Gherardo della Notte_,’ in memory of the royal card-parties\r\nat the château, where this ex-Nuncio was always the favoured partner. He\r\nwas so loaded with presents, that the distended skirts of the prelate’s\r\ngown became legendary in Paris as in Rome. And the least he could do\r\namidst the amplitude of the cloth out of which he had shaped such a gown,\r\nwas for the Cardinal Macchi to attempt later to shield the honour of the\r\nnew King that, in this same 1830, Charles X, on abdicating, had left to\r\nFrance. But however deep they be, the well-furnished pockets of a modern\r\nCardinal can’t take the place of the ancient _oubliettes_ of history.”\r\n\r\n“True! true!”\r\n\r\n“To throw light upon this strange business, there is more than the\r\naffirmations of the Ecclesiastical Tribunal of Faenza and the denials of\r\nthe Cardinal-Legate of Ravenna. There is a heap of proofs got together\r\nby the plaintiff in a voluminous memoir. Lady Newborough, Baronne de\r\nSternberg, wanted it to be published in Italian and French at the same\r\ntime. But the date of 1830, chosen for these startling revelations, was\r\nalso that when the person principally interested mounted the throne of\r\nFrance. Is it to be wondered at that these compromising documents were at\r\nonce destroyed wherever the representatives of the King Louis-Philippe\r\ncould find them?”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Then, there existed, and exists, a copy, thank God! Written in an\r\nelegant and easy hand, it once more proves the distinction of its author,\r\nas well as the sincerity of her words. You will easily discover the\r\nItalian text at Recanati, in the celebrated house of the Leopardis; for\r\nthe Count Monaldo, father of the great poet Giacomo Leopardi, was not\r\nafraid of preparing an edition of this document for the edification of\r\nhis contemporaries speaking the same tongue. The French text, which\r\nthe supposed daughter of Philippe-Egalité undertook to publish in your\r\nlanguage, and which she signed with the actual name of Joinville, which\r\nhad at the first concealed the criminal _incognito_, would perhaps be\r\nmore difficult to recover in France after the hunt for it But here is\r\na copy which will console you for the loss of the rest. Shall we look\r\nthrough it together?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; it is enough that the Vatican should shelter such noble\r\nvictims within the silence of its protecting walls, without Herod having\r\nto impeach the Pope for his guilty connivance in a repetition of the\r\nMassacre of the Innocents.”\r\n\r\nSo here we are in the presence of Lady Newborough’s Memoirs, which relate\r\nthat she was born on April 17, 1773, at Modigliana; her supposed father\r\nbeing Lorenzo Chiappini, _sbirro_, or factotum, to the Count Borghi. Her\r\nsupposed mother was one Vincenzia Viligenti, attached, as _concierge_, to\r\nthe kind of prison of which her husband was warder.\r\n\r\nThis birth took place at the precise time that a certain Comte de\r\nJoinville and the Comtesse, his wife, who were staying at the Palazzo\r\nBorghi, opposite the prison of which Chiappini was warder, had also a\r\nchild born to them. The child of Chiappini was baptized on the very day\r\nof its birth under the names of Maria Petronilla; _that of the Comte de\r\nJoinville does not appear in the Baptismal Registers of the Parish of\r\nSan Stefano_, common to both families.\r\n\r\nMaria Petronilla, always ignorant of her true origin and problematic\r\ndestiny, lived until she was four years old between the indifference of\r\nher mother, who gave all her love to her other children, and the marked\r\naffection of the Countess Borghi, who greatly appreciated the natural\r\ndistinction of the little girl, quite incompatible with so low an origin.\r\n\r\nBut the lowly estate of the Chiappinis improving day by day, Maria was\r\nonly four years old when she had to leave for Florence, the Grand Duke\r\nhaving summoned the humble warder of the Modigliana prison to unhoped-for\r\ngood fortune there.\r\n\r\nMaria Stella’s education kept pace with the growing prosperity of her\r\nfather Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nWhen the little girl had learnt enough of dancing and accomplishments,\r\nher father got her an engagement as ballet-dancer in a large theatre in\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nScarcely of marriageable age, she had first to spurn and then to accept\r\nthe passionate addresses of an elderly English nobleman, who asked her\r\nhand. The parents granted what the daughter refused, and one day, against\r\nher will, Maria Petronilla became the wife of Lord Newborough.\r\n\r\nLady Newborough’s Memoirs continue as tales of travel up to the page\r\nwherein she records the death of Lorenzo Chiappini, with this autograph\r\nletter from the dying man.\r\n\r\n    “MILADY,\r\n\r\n    “I have come to the end of my days without having ever revealed\r\n    to any one a secret which directly concerns you and me.\r\n\r\n    “This is the secret.\r\n\r\n    “The day you were born of a person I must not name, and who\r\n    has already passed into the next world, a boy was also born to\r\n    me. I was requested to make an exchange, and, in view of my\r\n    circumstances at that time, I consented after reiterated and\r\n    advantageous proposals; and it was then that I adopted you as\r\n    my daughter, as in the same way my son was adopted by the other\r\n    party.\r\n\r\n    “I see that Heaven has made up for my fault, since you have\r\n    been placed in a better position than your father’s, although\r\n    he was of almost similar rank; and it is this that enables me\r\n    to end my life in something of peace.\r\n\r\n    “Keep this in your possession, so that I may not be held\r\n    totally guilty. Yes, while begging your forgiveness for my sin,\r\n    I ask you, if you please, to keep it hidden, so that the world\r\n    may not be set talking over a matter that cannot be remedied.\r\n\r\n    “Even this letter will not be sent to you till after my death.\r\n\r\n                                               “LORENZO CHIAPPINI.”\r\n\r\n“Stranger and still stranger!”\r\n\r\n“This letter, sent through the post from Florence to Lady Newborough,\r\nthen at Siena, about the middle of December 1821, was the beginning of\r\nthe lengthy investigations to which this daughter of noble but unknown\r\nparents henceforth entirely devoted herself. You must read the rest\r\nof the Memoirs, of which I venture to recommend whole pages to your\r\nconsideration. Here is an extract—\r\n\r\n    “‘After leaving my two eldest sons,’ writes Lady Newborough,\r\n    ‘I took the road to Rome, where I had already made the\r\n    acquaintance of Cardinal Consalvi, who showed me the greatest\r\n    kindness. By his order, all the archives were thrown open to\r\n    me; everything was examined into, not only in the capital, but\r\n    in the country round about the Apennines; but everywhere the\r\n    answer was the same: “Nothing whatever has been discovered;\r\n    everything must have been destroyed during the Revolution.”\r\n\r\n    “‘Seeing that there was nothing to be done there, I set out\r\n    for Faenza, where I was informed that the Count Borghi was\r\n    absent, and that, moreover, it would be useless for me to see\r\n    him, as he had declared that he would never tell me anything at\r\n    all. I heard even that he had threatened the old servant-women\r\n    with the withholding of their modest pensions if they had the\r\n    ill-luck of speaking to me. But they could not restrain their\r\n    longing to see me or the cry of their consciences. Their first\r\n    words when they met me were a simultaneous exclamation of “O\r\n    Dio! how like you are to the Comtesse de Joinville!”\r\n\r\n    “‘I joyfully welcomed them and treated them kindly; and having\r\n    implored them to acquaint me with the details concerning my\r\n    birth, they at last consented to speak perfectly openly.\r\n\r\n    “‘“Our father, Nicholas Bandini,” they told me, “at the age of\r\n    seventeen entered the Borghi mansion as chief steward, and\r\n    never left it till his death. We also were taken on there in\r\n    our youth as maids to the Countess Camilla. That lady, with her\r\n    son, the Count Pompeo, was in the habit of spending a good part\r\n    of the year at the castle at Modigliana, and in the beginning\r\n    of the spring of 1773 we accompanied them there.\r\n\r\n    “‘“On our arrival we found, already established in the\r\n    Pretorial Palace, a French couple, called the Comte Louis\r\n    and the Comtesse Joinville. The Comte had a fine figure, a\r\n    rather brown complexion, and a red and pimpled nose. As to the\r\n    Comtesse, you can see almost her perfect image in your own\r\n    person, milady.\r\n\r\n    “‘“Being such near neighbours, the greatest intimacy soon\r\n    came to pass between them and our masters. Every day the two\r\n    families met, sometimes at one house, sometimes at the other.\r\n\r\n    “‘“The foreign stranger was extremely familiar with people of\r\n    the lowest rank, especially with Chiappini, the jailer, who\r\n    lived under the same roof. As it happened, both their wives\r\n    were then _enceinte_, and the two confinements appeared to be\r\n    imminent.\r\n\r\n    “‘“But the Comte was seriously anxious; his wife had not yet\r\n    given him a male child; and he was intensely uneasy lest he\r\n    should never have one, when of this very fear was born an idea,\r\n    both barbarous and advantageous. First he broached the subject\r\n    to the Count Pompeo and his mother, from a very charming point\r\n    of view; then he endeavoured to worm himself more and more into\r\n    the warder’s confidence, and ended by telling him that seeing\r\n    himself about to lose a great inheritance absolutely dependent\r\n    on the birth of a son, he was quite willing, in case he should\r\n    have a daughter, to exchange her for a boy, whose father he\r\n    would largely recompense.\r\n\r\n    “‘“The man who listened to his words, delighted to find\r\n    unlooked-for luck at so appropriate a moment, did not hesitate\r\n    for an instant; he accepted the offer, and the matter was\r\n    settled on the spot.\r\n\r\n    “‘“We know it,” the sisters Bandini went on, “because we\r\n    heard it with our own ears; and we know, too, that the event\r\n    justified the precautions taken; the Comtesse gave birth to a\r\n    daughter, and the other woman to a son. The news was brought\r\n    to our master, and one of us going into the Pretorial Palace\r\n    to see the newly-born children, was assured by some women of\r\n    the house that the exchange had really taken place. Chiappini,\r\n    who was present, confirmed it in his own words. Later on, the\r\n    Countess Camilla often repeated it to us; she used to say that\r\n    the Comtesse Joinville had been told all about it, and had\r\n    seemed quite content.\r\n\r\n    “‘“Soon after this abominable crime we ourselves saw the Comte\r\n    and the jailer on the best of terms; the first because he had\r\n    secured immense profit; the other because he had received\r\n    much money. Although silence had been promised, there were\r\n    indiscreet people, and public rumour soon accused the authors\r\n    of this horrible transaction. The Comte Louis, dreading the\r\n    general indignation of his accusers, fled and hid himself at\r\n    Brisighella, in the convent of St. Bernard. We knew he had been\r\n    arrested and then set at liberty, but we never saw him again.\r\n\r\n    “‘“The lady left with her servants and her reputed son,\r\n    while her own daughter, baptized by the name of Maria Stella\r\n    Petronilla, and described as belonging to Lorenzo Chiappini\r\n    and Vincenzia Viligenti, always remained with these last. Our\r\n    mistress was constantly distressed about this misfortune. To\r\n    repair it as much as possible she kept the unfortunate child\r\n    near her, caressing her and giving her all kinds of presents,\r\n    treating her not with ordinary friendliness, but with every\r\n    mark of ardent love. So she behaved to this child for the first\r\n    four years, that is to say till Chiappini took her with him\r\n    to Florence, where he had her educated, and where he bought\r\n    property with the price of his frightful bargain.”\r\n\r\n    “‘Thus spoke my venerable septuagenarians.\r\n\r\n    “‘Fully satisfied with their story, there seemed no need of\r\n    more, and that now it would be enough to appear before my\r\n    iniquitous parents and obtain from them just reparation.\r\n\r\n    “‘With this plan I set out for France with my third son,\r\n    his drawing-master, my maid, and my courier, a faithful and\r\n    intelligent servant.\r\n\r\n    “‘By the Sieur Fabroni’s advice, we went straight to Champagne,\r\n    and the mere name of the place led us to Joinville. I asked the\r\n    magistrates for information, and was told by them all that no\r\n    nobleman of the neighbourhood bore the name of their city, and\r\n    that it belonged solely to the Orleans family.\r\n\r\n    “‘After several attempts, which all had the same result, I went\r\n    to Paris, arriving on July 5, 1823. As a cleverly used ruse\r\n    may bring about an act of justice, and as the bait of riches\r\n    is nowadays the most powerful of motives, I had the following\r\n    advertisement inserted in several newspapers—\r\n\r\n      “‘“The widow of the late Count Pompeo Borghi has asked\r\n      Lady N. S. to find for her in France a certain Louis,\r\n      Comte Joinville, who, with the Comtesse, his wife, was\r\n      at Modigliana, a little town in the Apennines, where the\r\n      Comtesse gave birth to a son on the 16th of April, 1773. If\r\n      these two persons are still living, or the child born at\r\n      Modigliana, Lady N. S. has the honour to announce to them\r\n      that she has been empowered to make them a communication\r\n      of the highest interest. Supposing that these persons\r\n      can prove their identity, they have only to apply to the\r\n      Baronne de Sternberg, Hôtel de Belle-Vue, Rue de Rivoli.”\r\n\r\n    “‘Two days later appeared a colonel bearing the much-desired\r\n    name; I received him with the warmest welcome. He spoke,\r\n    recounting his various titles. Alas! the one that had at first\r\n    interested me so immensely was quite recent, and came to him\r\n    from Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\n    “‘At that moment I was told that M. l’Abbé de Saint-Fare\r\n    solicited the honour of an interview; the colonel looked much\r\n    astonished, and withdrew. In his place entered an enormous man,\r\n    wearing spectacles and supported by two footmen. As soon as he\r\n    was seated, the following conversation took place.\r\n\r\n    “‘“The Duke of Orleans, having seen your advertisement, has\r\n    this morning begged me to come and make inquiries about\r\n    this inheritance; for we presume that that is the matter\r\n    in question, and at the date you mention there was no one\r\n    in existence outside the family to whom the title of Comte\r\n    Joinville could belong.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Was Monseigneur the Duke of Orleans born at Modigliana on\r\n    the 16th of April, 1773?”\r\n\r\n    “‘“He was born that year, but in Paris, on the 6th of October.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Then I am very sorry that you should have taken the trouble\r\n    to come; for in that case he has no connection with the person\r\n    I am looking for.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“No doubt you have heard it said that the late Duke was very\r\n    gay with the fair sex, and the child in question might well be\r\n    that of one of his favourites.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“No, no, its legitimacy is incontestable.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Could anything be more surprising! It is true, the late Duke\r\n    lived in the midst of mysteries.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Could you not describe him to me, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Willingly, madame. He was a fine man with a good leg; his\r\n    complexion was of a rather dark red, and, if it had not been\r\n    for the numerous pimples on his face, he would have been very\r\n    good-looking.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“And his character?”\r\n\r\n    “‘“What people principally admired in him was his extreme\r\n    affability to every one.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Your description agrees exactly with that that was given me\r\n    of the Comte de Joinville.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Then it must be supposed that it was the Duke himself.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“That can’t be if it is true that his son was born in Paris.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“May I ask you if there is a large sum to be had, and when?”\r\n\r\n    “‘“I am truly sorry not to be able to inform you; I am not at\r\n    liberty to say more.”\r\n\r\n    “‘During the whole of this conversation, the big abbé had never\r\n    left off looking at me in an almost offensive way; and, trying\r\n    to find out what was my native tongue, he had spoken now in\r\n    English, now in Italian, without being able to make up his\r\n    mind, in consequence of my speaking both languages equally well.\r\n\r\n    “‘After an hour’s talk, he took leave, asking my permission to\r\n    come again. I replied that I should be delighted to see him\r\n    again, and, in my turn, begged him to be so good as to make\r\n    inquiries amongst his many acquaintances.\r\n\r\n    “‘He kindly promised to do so, and added that he knew a very\r\n    aged lady from Champagne very well, and that she might be able\r\n    to give him much information, which he would transmit to me at\r\n    once.\r\n\r\n    “‘As nothing came of it, I sent M. Coiron, a teacher of French,\r\n    who was giving lessons in it to my son, to him.\r\n\r\n    “‘M. de Saint-Fare treated him politely, pleaded indisposition,\r\n    and made great protestations.\r\n\r\n    “‘On Coiron presenting himself a second time, he was received\r\n    very coldly, and simply told that nothing had been yet done.\r\n\r\n    “‘Moved by his own zeal and without my authority, he made a\r\n    third attempt. Then the abbé told him plainly that he might\r\n    discontinue his visits; that the lady knew nothing at all, and\r\n    that he himself did not want to have anything to do with this\r\n    fuss.\r\n\r\n    “‘Still, the first impression his visit made on me could not\r\n    be effaced. I procured a ticket, and went with my friends to\r\n    the Palais Royal. What was my surprise on seeing in some of\r\n    the portraits their extreme resemblance either to me or to\r\n    my children. My astonishment increased when my young Edward,\r\n    catching sight of a picture I had not yet noticed, exclaimed:\r\n    “Dieu! Maman, how much that face is like old Chiappini’s and\r\n    his son’s!”\r\n\r\n    “‘We discovered that it was actually the portrait of the\r\n    present Duke.…\r\n\r\n    “‘Thinking seriously over this, I realized that I owed to him\r\n    in fact the important service of being the first to tear the\r\n    impenetrable veil by deputing that Abbé de Saint-Fare, who, I\r\n    was told, was not only his great friend, but his natural uncle,\r\n    to see me.\r\n\r\n    “‘It will be believed that, from that moment, all my researches\r\n    went in the direction so clearly pointed out.…’\r\n\r\n“The proofs Lady Newborough goes on heaping up in her startling Memoirs\r\nought to be quoted as a whole,” ended my guide, as he tied up the heap\r\nof papers. “But that will need another sitting, longer than the first.\r\nHere is the sun beginning to set, and the custodian of the Archives\r\nof the Vatican inviting us to go. Will this historical puzzle awake\r\nyour curiosity? In that case you will have to endeavour to reconcile\r\nthese undeniable yet contradictory documents, since they repose in the\r\nshadow of these protecting walls, where you may read on the face of the\r\n_Archivio_ which Leo XIII set open for the truth of History, the proud\r\ndevice that bold and beneficent Pontiff had cut upon it when he invited\r\nthe whole civilized world to enter its doors.\r\n\r\n“‘_The first law of History is not to dare to lie; the second, not to\r\nfear to tell the truth; further, the historian must not lay himself open\r\nto a suspicion of either flattery or animosity._’\r\n\r\n“The survivors of this domestic drama still draw breath at Modigliana\r\nand Brisighella, where Lorenzo Chiappini and Philippe-Egalité have\r\nleft traces of their sojourn and their crime. At Glynllifon, in the\r\nPrincipality of Wales, the lineage of Lady Newborough, in the shape of\r\nher grandsons, still flourishes, if not the claims that died with her.\r\nShall you go there, too, to examine into them?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” I answered; “for the honour of the blood of France,\r\nwhich cannot lie, and of the truth which could not well serve a nobler\r\ncause than this.”\r\n\r\nBut, while waiting for the information which cannot fail to bring\r\norder and light into this still confused and perplexing affair, it was\r\nimportant that the actual text of these Memoirs, hunted for by those\r\ninterested in them for nearly two-thirds of a century, so that there is\r\nscarcely a copy left that is not worth its weight in gold, should be put\r\nin reach of honest minds which have likewise a full right to form an\r\nopinion on a case of such barbarity and of such national interest.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be expected of a Philippe-Egalité, who, to secure the\r\ngreat inheritance of Penthièvre, and needing a male firstborn, did not\r\nhesitate to sacrifice his own legitimate daughter for it? Would he be\r\nlikely, a few years later, to hesitate before voting for the death of\r\nLouis XVI, who could no longer do anything for him? Had he not shown the\r\nextent of his complaisance in his preference for Madame de Genlis over\r\nhis wife, whose confidante the mistress became under the very roof of the\r\ninfamous husband of one and lover of the other?\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs of de Genlis have been widely read; let the Memoirs of Maria\r\nStella be read likewise. After that we can talk with better knowledge of\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\n                                                      BOYER D’AGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PART\r\n\r\nFROM MY BIRTH TO THE DEATH OF HIM I CALLED MY FATHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n    My Birth—Kindness of the Comtesse Borghi—We leave for\r\n    Florence—My Circumstances in that Town—Domestic Troubles—My\r\n    Parents’ good Fortune—My Tastes—My Education—Journey to Pisa—My\r\n    Illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in 1773, in the little town of Modigliana, situated on the\r\nheights of the Apennines, which could be reached only by very bad roads.\r\nIt belongs to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, though dependent on the Diocese\r\nof Faenza in the Papal States.\r\n\r\nOn April 17 of the same year I was baptized in the parish church,\r\nreceiving the names of Maria Stella Petronilla. My father’s name was\r\nLorenzo Chiappini; my mother’s, Vincenzia Viligenti.\r\n\r\nThe family of Borghi Biancoli of Faenza owned, in my birthplace, a\r\nmagnificent palace almost opposite the Pretorial Palace, where my father\r\nlived in the position of jailer.\r\n\r\nThe Count Pompeo Borghi, with his mother, the Countess Camilla, came\r\nthere every year to spend the summer. The Countess happened to see me,\r\nand despite my father’s ignoble profession, she was very fond of me and\r\nshowed me immense kindness. I was admitted to her table, and often even\r\nshared her bed; she heaped presents upon me, and I lived almost entirely\r\nwith her; I may even say that she inspired all the people of her house\r\nwith the same sentiments, and that I was generally loved.\r\n\r\nIt was a precious compensation for the ills I suffered at home, where I\r\nhad to endure the cruel brutality of a barbarous mother, to whom I was an\r\nobject of detestation!\r\n\r\nI well remember that as the first germ of gratitude developed in my\r\nlittle heart, I loved my benefactress as myself. When she was absent,\r\nI longed for her return, and when I had got her back, I couldn’t tear\r\nmyself away from her; in a word, she was all the happiness of my life;\r\nbut, alas! it was soon to be torn from me.\r\n\r\nI had not yet reached my fourth year, when my father was summoned to\r\nFlorence by the Grand Duke Leopold, who put him in command of a company\r\nof archers (_capo squadra sbirri_). A few months later my father, in his\r\nturn, sent for us. I was his eldest child; two brothers were born after\r\nme, and the first had been dead some time.\r\n\r\nThe day we left, I was awakened very early, and in a few minutes my\r\nbrother and I were each put into a pannier on a mule, and my mother got\r\nupon another animal of the same kind, our sole guide, protector and\r\ncompanion being the muleteer.\r\n\r\nWhat tears I shed at leaving my dear Countess! It almost seemed as if I\r\nhad foreseen that in losing this loving friend I should lose everything,\r\nabsolutely everything!…\r\n\r\nDuring the journey, which lasted two days, my mother seemed to care for\r\nnothing but my little brother, to whom she gave all her attention. Her\r\nneglect of me filled me with such bitterness that I felt like complaining\r\nto my father the instant we reached Florence.\r\n\r\nIn this new abode small-pox attacked our family; I got off with some\r\nsmall suffering; but my brother fell a victim to it, and my mother was\r\nnot consoled for his loss till she gave birth to a third son six months\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nScarcely convalescent, I was sent to a school, taken every morning by an\r\nancient maidservant.\r\n\r\nMy appearance and manners, my native tongue, which nobody spoke at\r\nFlorence; my rich attire, my splendid bracelets, my coral necklace, and\r\nall the gifts of the Countess Borghi, soon attracted much attention. I\r\nwas sent for; people were pleased to see me, and liked to listen to me.\r\n\r\nBut what struck other people so pleasingly made only an unfavourable\r\nimpression on my mother; for the slightest fault I was punished with the\r\ngreatest severity.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion she gave me such a violent blow with her heavy hand that\r\nI fainted, and, falling backwards, hurt myself terribly. When I recovered\r\nfrom my fainting fit, I could not restrain my grief. Going into a corner,\r\nI gave myself up to the most frightful despair, invoking my protectress\r\nwith loud cries and calling to her for help.\r\n\r\nVain lamentations! Henceforth given over to my ill fortune, I was never\r\nagain to find maternal consolation.\r\n\r\nMy father had a sister who was very unfortunate in her marriage; she left\r\nher husband and came to live with us. She and my mother could never get\r\non; they detested each other, and were perpetually quarrelling.\r\n\r\nWitnessing their disputes, my father sometimes took the part of one,\r\nsometimes of the other; still more often he reproved both of them, and\r\ndrew their anger upon himself. The arrival of my paternal grandmother,\r\nwho, growing old, came to be with her son, led to fresh subjects for\r\nwrangling; and as they were all violent and passionate, our house was\r\nlike a veritable hell upon earth.\r\n\r\nThese interminable quarrels were not caused, as might be supposed, by the\r\ncares attending poverty. Though my father’s post brought him in no more\r\nthan a hundred francs a month, he had always plenty of money. He was well\r\ndressed, and often gave large dinners. He had abundance of provisions,\r\nand his cellar contained wines of the best kinds. He had a very pretty\r\nhouse and a splendid garden.\r\n\r\nBut these advantages were far from making up to me for my annoyances,\r\nor from doing away with the mortal weariness I felt in the bosom of my\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI bewailed my fate unceasingly; I felt humiliated by my circumstances; I\r\nenvied the ladies who possessed many servants, beautiful mansions, fine\r\nequipages, and most of all those who were received at Court.\r\n\r\nThese lofty aspirations were always with me; they were so deeply graven\r\non my mind, so natural to me after a fashion, that I should have liked\r\nalways to live with the great, and felt myself grievously hurt when I was\r\nobliged to keep company with common people.\r\n\r\nI had, too, a decided taste for the fine arts; I had a passion for\r\nantiquities, and I do not doubt that I should have made great progress if\r\nmy talents had been cultivated.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the age of seven I was given lessons in writing, dancing,\r\nmusic, etc.\r\n\r\nAs my voice and my skill were remarkable, my parents made me early an\r\nobject of speculation, and I was forced into practising cruelly. They\r\nmade me sing, or play the piano eight hours a day, which inspired me with\r\nan insurmountable detestation of that instrument.\r\n\r\nIf my master complained of my inattention, I was shut up in the\r\nmusic-room from six in the morning till eight in the evening and given\r\nhardly anything to eat. If by chance I got a good report, I was pretty\r\nwell treated, my father made me a present of twopence, and my mother told\r\nme ghost stories, which terrified me to such an extent that I scarcely\r\ndared to be alone during the night.\r\n\r\nOne day when they had forgotten to open my prison at the usual hour, I\r\nwas suddenly seized with a panic of terror, and, quite beside myself, I\r\nopened the window and threw myself out into the garden, without doing\r\nmyself any harm, however.\r\n\r\nAbout this time great rejoicings were taking place in Pisa in honour of\r\ntheir Neapolitan Majesties, who were on a visit to the Grand Duke Leopold.\r\n\r\nMy mother, wishing to take the opportunity of going to see her sister,\r\nwho lived in that town, my father gave his consent, on condition that my\r\naunt and I should be of the party.\r\n\r\nWith what transports of joy did I receive this agreeable news! What a\r\ndelightful and lively satisfaction it would be to let my _dear_ piano\r\nrest!\r\n\r\nGreat preparations were made for my toilette; several frocks were bought\r\nfor me; my father gave me two gold watches and a very valuable ring. He\r\ndid not forget to make me take my shoes with their very high red heels,\r\nwhose sound much delighted me.\r\n\r\nWe embarked on a public boat, and, although it was my first journey by\r\nwater, my young imagination, far from dreading the perils of the furious\r\nelement, was at once wonderfully diverted.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four hours we landed at Pisa, where my uncle and aunt\r\nFillipini, as well as their son and daughters, received us with open\r\narms. They were greatly surprised to see me so richly clad, and said to\r\nmy mother that no doubt her husband was very well off.\r\n\r\nShe answered only that I was a _bastard_, a name she gave me pretty\r\noften, and the meaning of which I did not understand.\r\n\r\nProfiting by my father’s absence to treat me with greater harshness, she\r\nwas eternally scolding and tormenting me; she went so far as to take\r\naway my watches and my ring, to give them, as she said, to the great\r\nMadonna. Unluckily for me, she managed to procure a piano, at which I was\r\npitilessly forced to work.\r\n\r\nOne day, having suddenly sent for me, she ordered me to sing for the\r\namusement of two ragged and unpleasant-looking women she told me were\r\nintimate friends of hers.\r\n\r\nIndignant at such a proposal, I said that a bit of bread was all they\r\nneeded just at present.\r\n\r\nShe rose; I rushed to my room; but nothing could save me from her fury.\r\n\r\nIn vain did I beg her pardon, in vain entreated for mercy; a hail of\r\nblows fell upon me; my body was a mass of bruises; the blood streamed\r\nfrom my nose. I could not stand the overcoming pain; I went to bed, and\r\ndid not rise from it again till we set out for Florence.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion my visit to Pisa became a real martyrdom for me instead\r\nof an amusement.\r\n\r\nDuring my infancy I had been very subject to eruptions which from time\r\nto time appeared all over my body; but none had ever equalled that which\r\nwas caused after my return by weariness and wretchedness. After the\r\ndoctors had prescribed a lengthy course of cooling remedies, my parents,\r\nto rid themselves of such a nuisance, determined to send me to a hospital\r\nmaintained at the expense of the Grand Duchess, and the admission to\r\nwhich needed great interest. Nevertheless, my father got an order\r\nwithout any difficulty.\r\n\r\nI stayed there several weeks, and I must proclaim aloud that I felt as if\r\nI had refound my dear Countess in the person of each of the sisters who\r\nmanaged the hospital. Their constant care soon cured me; they were always\r\nnear me, caressing me, and giving me fruit and sweetmeats.\r\n\r\nNo, no one could have been kinder, more courteous than those charitable\r\nwomen, to whom I vowed eternal gratitude, and whom I could not leave\r\nwithout anguish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n    Fresh Tortures—My Parents’ Talks—Theatres—Mysterious\r\n    Letter—Troublesome Visits—Useless Prayers—My Protests.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature had given me a good figure; nevertheless, my father maintained\r\nthat I stooped, that one of my shoulders was higher than the other, and\r\nthat my feet grew large too quickly.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these imaginary defects he made me wear an iron collar, which\r\nwas taken off only at meal-time, a steel corset that increased the\r\ntorture and really made me deformed, and shoes so narrow and short that I\r\ncould hardly walk.\r\n\r\nWhen I begged him to take off this painful apparatus, a box on the ear\r\nwas his usual answer.\r\n\r\nHe often took me to the opera, to teach me, he said, to hold myself\r\nproperly; to move my arms easily; to behave with grace.\r\n\r\nAll this rigmarole was an enigma to me, until at last he explained it to\r\nme in these terms—\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it about time, my dear Maria, that you repaid what I have spent on\r\nyour education?”\r\n\r\n“How can I do that?” I answered quickly, and with a smile, “since all I\r\nhave comes from you.”\r\n\r\nInstantly he replied—\r\n\r\n“This is the way you are going to do it. I have got you an engagement at\r\nthe Piazza-Vecchia, where you will certainly make a great success.”\r\n\r\nDismayed by these words, I blushed, I trembled, and, concealing some of\r\nmy trouble, I exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“But the thing would be impossible. Don’t you know, father, that the\r\npresence of two or three lookers-on is enough to confuse me when I am\r\ntaking my lessons?”\r\n\r\nVain subterfuge.\r\n\r\n“Make a beginning,” he said harshly; “after you’ve done it a few times\r\nyou’ll find all the courage you need.”\r\n\r\nThere was one last expedient left me. I flew to my mother and, with\r\ntears, begged her to remember how often she had told me that actresses\r\ndeserved the most profound contempt. You may judge of my astonishment\r\nwhen I heard her answer thus—\r\n\r\n“It was so formerly, my daughter; nowadays all that is changed; on\r\nthe contrary, those ladies are admired and loved by everybody, and if\r\nthey sing well they gain great wealth, and even sometimes marry great\r\nnoblemen.”\r\n\r\nAfter that I saw there was nothing more to hope for; my doom was fixed\r\nand my misfortune inevitable.\r\n\r\nI was made to study my part, which my unwillingness made a very slow\r\nbusiness, and when the day for acting it arrived, my parents themselves\r\ncame to introduce me.\r\n\r\nWhen my turn came I found it impossible to open my mouth. My youth and\r\nmy simplicity stirred the pity of the whole audience, while my father\r\nendeavoured to express his displeasure and anger to me by frightful\r\ngrimaces, which at last forced me to stammer out a few notes.\r\n\r\nThe spectators made the building echo with their loud cries of _brava!\r\nbrava! coraggio!_ and at the end of the play several ladies of quality\r\nasked to see me, praising me repeatedly and lavishing all sorts of\r\nendearments upon me.\r\n\r\nAll the time the carnival lasted I was compelled to carry out the painful\r\ntask imposed on me. One day, having tried to play the invalid, my father\r\ndiscovered the trick, and made me pay for it so dear that I did not again\r\nthink of making that sort of excuse.\r\n\r\nGod alone knows how delighted I was when my engagement came to an end;\r\nbut, alas! the relief was a short one. After a few months’ rest, my\r\nfather announced to me that I was about to have the honour of appearing\r\non a larger stage, adding that everything was arranged and settled and\r\nthere was nothing left for me but to obey his orders.\r\n\r\nThe news came upon me like a clap of thunder. Putting aside my\r\nnervousness, I felt myself degraded and debased.\r\n\r\nMore especially did I feel ashamed when I heard the actresses saying to\r\none another: “It is disparaging to us to have the daughter of a constable\r\nput amongst us.”\r\n\r\nAt this period I had two brothers and one sister, three little tyrants\r\nall of whose whims I had to humour; for if I made the smallest objection\r\nmy mother encouraged them to abuse me and beat me, and throw stones at\r\nme. Fed and brought up delicately, nothing was good enough for them;\r\nbut I had no difficulty, nevertheless, in realizing that they were being\r\nprepared for no better fate than mine, and they, too, were destined for\r\nmy degrading profession.\r\n\r\nToo unfortunate already in that I belonged to such a family, I was far\r\nfrom expecting fresh troubles, when my father read aloud to us the\r\nfollowing letter, which he had just received, addressed to me—\r\n\r\n“I have seen you, you beautiful star, and listened to the melodious tones\r\nof your angelic voice; they have intoxicated my heart. I implore you, my\r\nangel, to come at ten o’clock to the least frequented walls of the town;\r\nthere you will receive the faithful promises of your unknown adorer.”\r\n\r\nThis letter sent us into fits of laughter; my father alone was angry,\r\nand declared that if he could discover the impertinent author of such an\r\nanonymous letter he would severely punish him for his temerity.\r\n\r\nThe next day a messenger asked for me at the door. My father went in my\r\nstead, had a long talk with him, and I heard nothing further about it,\r\ntill one day, having dressed me up like a goddess and given me all my\r\nmother’s rings—carefully reduced in size with wax—to wear, I was told\r\nof the coming visit of an illustrious personage whom I was ordered to\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nAt his arrival my parents bent themselves nearly double to show their\r\nrespect, and motioned me to do the same.\r\n\r\nI was inclined to mockery and could hardly contain myself, when I saw\r\nenter an old greybeard, from behind whose few and discoloured teeth came\r\nforth an offensive breath.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a blue coat braided with red, and wore a little white\r\ncloak with gold fringe, over which hung a thin queue, an ell long.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, who, moreover, was stout, and might have been a\r\nfine-enough-looking man in his earlier years, introduced himself as Lord\r\nNewborough, an English nobleman, and, as he entered, told me he had come\r\nsolely for the pleasure of hearing me sing.\r\n\r\nHow great was my reluctance to do as he asked! With what bad grace I sang!\r\n\r\nMy _bravura_ ended, I made some excuse and retired.\r\n\r\nA few days later milord appeared again; his visits became more and more\r\nfrequent; soon they were daily.\r\n\r\nEach time he talked to me of his wealth; boasted of his immense\r\npossessions; gave me the most magnificent descriptions of England; and\r\nwas constantly repeating that he was a widower with only one son.\r\n\r\nHis Italian was so bad that I should never have understood his jargon\r\nwithout my father’s help.\r\n\r\nI understood no better why I was always so well got-up, so adorned with\r\njewels and diamonds. When I asked the reason, I was told that all this\r\nfinery would induce the great lord to increase the value of the presents\r\nhe could not fail to make me.\r\n\r\nIn vain I did my utmost to convince my parents that I hated the very\r\nidea of receiving the least thing from him. They overwhelmed me with\r\nreproaches, asking me if this was the way I meant to repay them;\r\nrepresenting to me that they had to provide for the education of three\r\nother children; and at last saying plainly—\r\n\r\n“How would it be if you had to marry this man whom you had no right to\r\nlook for, and who is so much above you?”\r\n\r\nUnhesitatingly I cried, “O Dio! Dio! I would rather die!”\r\n\r\nThen my father bade me remember that his power over me was absolute and\r\nthat I was bound to obey his commands; my mother joined in and declared,\r\nwith an oath, that, willing or not, I should be the wife _del signore\r\ninglese_.\r\n\r\nRealizing that it was not a joke, I implored them to let me become a nun,\r\nor to do with me what they pleased so long as I was not forced to make\r\nsuch a detestable match; but my words, my tears, my sighs, resulted only\r\nin making them more angry and eliciting more hateful oaths.\r\n\r\nThen I ran to my grandmother and my aunt, begging them to take my part.\r\nThey did as I asked, but without success; they were only forbidden to\r\nmention the subject again.\r\n\r\nWounded to the very depths of my heart, I gave myself up wholly to my\r\ngrief, scarcely alive or able to breathe.\r\n\r\nMilord himself came to rouse me from my stupor.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of him I gave a wild cry, and, falling at his knees,\r\nwith sobs implored him not to exact such a sacrifice from me; to think\r\nof my youth; to see that I could not reasonably give my hand to a man\r\nold enough to be my grandfather and for whom I felt an insurmountable\r\naversion.\r\n\r\nHe did nothing but laugh at my pitiful simplicity; and, raising me from\r\nmy lowly attitude, he said to me that if I did not love him yet, I would\r\nlater on; that his rank, his estates, his wealth, and all the fine things\r\nI should enjoy, would oblige me to love him dearly.\r\n\r\nAt these words my whole being was possessed by fury; I violently thrust\r\nback my insupportable persecutor, looking at him with blazing eyes; I\r\nabused him, passionately declaring that I would rather endure any plague\r\nthan the union he offered me; that I would rather face all the miseries\r\nin the world; that death itself would be nothing to dread; that, besides,\r\nmy hatred of him had come to its height; that it was so deeply rooted in\r\nmy heart that nothing could tear it up, and that my greatest happiness\r\nwould be to be rid of his presence for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n    Arrangements with Milord—His Son—Brain-fever—Fruitless\r\n    Attempts—My Marriage—My Husband’s Conduct—The Avarice of my\r\n    Parents—An Envoy from England.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough my engagement at the theatre was to end in a fortnight, my father\r\ngot a substitute for me, and himself gave up his post; maintaining that\r\nall that was henceforth incompatible with the high rank I was to attain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he did not forget to take his precautions, but effected\r\nan agreement greatly to his own advantage, and, with no thought for my\r\nfuture, simply put me at the mercy of my elderly adorer in consideration\r\nfor a sum of fifteen thousand _francesconi_, a pension of thirty ducats a\r\nmonth, and the proprietorship of a magnificent country house at Fiesole,\r\nvery well furnished, with a courtyard, gardens, and two immense vineyards.\r\n\r\nMoreover, milord promised to pay the expenses of the whole family during\r\nhis whole stay in Italy on condition that he and his son were allowed to\r\nlive with us.\r\n\r\nThat young man was then sixteen years old, tall and well made; Nature had\r\nendowed him with ability and a good heart, but he was so ignorant and\r\nuncouth that it was pitiful to see him. He could neither read nor write,\r\nand used the coarsest expressions; his greatest pleasure was the company\r\nof low people or servants.\r\n\r\nHe talked a great deal about a Signora Bussoti, wife of milord’s cook,\r\ntelling any one who choose to listen that this _very respectable_ person\r\nhad caused his mother’s death, and was daily eating up his father’s\r\nfortune; that she had children whose legitimacy was anything but certain,\r\nand for whose sake he himself had often been beaten.\r\n\r\nThese speeches, and many other blemishes I caught sight of through the\r\ntrouble my future husband took to prevent my being entirely disgusted\r\nwith him, finished by making me realize completely the depth of the abyss\r\ninto which I was to be thrown. My youthful imagination took fright, and I\r\ncould no longer bear the weight of my misery.\r\n\r\nAll at once I was seized with violent pain, my senses were benumbed, my\r\nhead turned, and for twenty-six days my life was despaired of. Even\r\nin my delirium the thought of my unhappiness did not leave me; I cried\r\naloud; I breathed complaints; I made incoherent murmurs. My grandmother\r\nand my aunt were inconsolable; they were always with me, and their\r\nconstant and affectionate care greatly contributed to my recovery.\r\n\r\nAlas! as soon as I recovered consciousness, I regretted that I was alive;\r\nI rose and rushed to the balcony; but my father came in, took hold of me\r\nand stopped me.\r\n\r\nVainly I took the opportunity to repeat my humble remonstrances and to\r\nswear perfect obedience to him in every other respect; he only put before\r\nme, in his turn, all the supposed advantages I should gain, and averred\r\nthat the Grand Duke, knowing all about me, absolutely required me to be\r\nennobled.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was well enough to go out, the doctors advised country air,\r\nand we went to Fiesole, a little town three miles from Florence.\r\n\r\nThere a new idea came to me, which at first I believed might be very\r\nuseful. I urged the difference of religion and the impossibility of my\r\nmarrying a Protestant.\r\n\r\nBut the old heretic did away with that difficulty at once.\r\n\r\n“I’ll turn Jew!” he exclaimed; “I’ll turn Mussulman; I’ll turn idolater;\r\nI’ll turn anything you like so long as you’ll consent to be my wife.”\r\n\r\nAnd he called in priests and monks to instruct him, and neglected nothing\r\nnecessary for becoming a member of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was nothing to be done but fix the day for my immolation.\r\n\r\nThe fatal day arrived, and by the first light of dawn we made ready to\r\nstart for Florence.\r\n\r\nBefore getting into the carriage, for the last time I threw myself at the\r\nfeet of my inexorable parents, watering them with my tears, while sobs\r\nchoked my voice.\r\n\r\nMy mother grew angry and heaped abuse on me; my father raised me roughly,\r\nsaying crossly, “The Grand Duke wishes it; there’s no way of going back\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nWe set off at once, and fearing that the populace might rise against\r\nthe unjust violence done to a girl of thirteen, we went not to a public\r\nchurch but to a private chapel.\r\n\r\nI was led to the foot of the altar and placed by the side of the man I\r\nabhorred.\r\n\r\nQuestioned by the minister, I had nearly answered in the negative, when\r\nmy father pinched me, and, with a muttered threat that he would kill me,\r\nsomehow extorted from me the fatal vow which put the seal on my wretched\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony over, we returned to Fiesole, where a number of friends came\r\nto offer their congratulations.\r\n\r\nInstead of receiving them, I shut myself up in my room, and it was in\r\nvain that they sent for me. I took no food but what my grandmother and\r\naunt brought to me in secret.\r\n\r\nAt the end of four days my father burst open the door, forced me to go\r\nout, and put me into the arms of my husband, or rather my insufferable\r\nkeeper; for he was so full of jealousy that he could not endure the\r\npresence of a man. If I went out, he wanted to accompany me, or sent some\r\none after me.\r\n\r\nScores of times he was guilty of rudeness to people who honoured me with\r\ntheir salutations, and on every hand he thought he saw favoured rivals or\r\ndangerous emissaries.\r\n\r\nEvery day the fumes of wine upset his weak mind; he gave way to\r\nfrightful fits of anger, and after having infinitely increased the usual\r\ndiscomforts of our dreary household, he would fall into a deep sleep in\r\nwhich he snored loudly.\r\n\r\nHe speedily conceived such an antipathy for the various members of my\r\nfamily that he never spoke of them but by the most filthy names.\r\n\r\nWhen I reminded him of the affectionate and loving names he constantly\r\ncalled me by, he always answered, “As for you, my dear better-half, you\r\nmay feel quite sure there is nothing in common between your charming self\r\nand that odious stock.”\r\n\r\nAnd truly I was often astonished myself that there was so obvious a\r\ndifference, whether in the colour and shape of the face, whether in\r\nthe disposition and temperament, the bearing and speech, or the mental\r\nfaculties and the inclinations of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe contrast was especially striking between my generosity and the\r\nwell-known avarice of the Chiappinis.\r\n\r\nThey were in constant torment from this passion; they were for ever\r\nexhorting me, urging me to ask for money, to demand ornaments, to go to\r\nshops to buy them whatever they wanted.\r\n\r\nMy humouring them, their own extravagances, and, even more, the\r\ninsatiable claims of the _charming_ Bussoti, soon exhausted the exchequer\r\nof milord, whose credulity let him be robbed of nearly his last farthing.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what would have become of him if Mr. Price, his man of\r\nbusiness, had not opportunely arrived.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman handed over some ready money to him, and prepared to\r\nreturn and send him back some larger sums.\r\n\r\nThere was waiting, and impatience, and counting of days and hours! At\r\nlast the post brings a letter. My father goes to fetch it, breaks the\r\nseal, has it translated, and its contents are known before it reaches the\r\nperson to whom it is addressed.\r\n\r\nIt announces the sending off of several trunks. Joyful news! Clapping of\r\nall hands!\r\n\r\nBut what a surprise! When the trunks, so longed for, were opened, nothing\r\nwas to be seen but a heap of old rubbish that Mr. Price had doubtless\r\ngot together from the wardrobes of milord’s grandmamas, and by which he\r\nhad thought he might temporarily assuage the raging thirst of my greedy\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing, while my mother, bawling at the top of her\r\nvoice, accused me of carelessness, declaring that if there was nothing\r\nbetter, it was because I had not been willing to ask for anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n    Return to Florence—Rupture and Reconciliation—The British\r\n    Minister—English Lady’s-maid—Milord’s Imprisonment—My\r\n    Flight—Presents and Promises—My Father’s Avowal—My Behaviour\r\n    Towards Him—His Obliquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy husband soon wearied of the country and wanted to return to Florence.\r\nThere he hired a fine house, big enough to hold us all; the first storey\r\nwas to belong to him, his son and me; my parents occupied the second.\r\nWe were to be independent of each other, but Lord Newborough was still\r\nresponsible for the expenses of the double household.\r\n\r\nAlthough forty-five years old, my mother was then _enceinte_, and gave\r\nbirth to a fifth boy, who was named Thomas, after milord, his godfather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD NEWBOROUGH\r\n\r\nFROM A PICTURE AT GLYNLLIFON]\r\n\r\nThe education of my brothers took a quite different direction from what\r\nhad seemed probable at first. My husband placed them in a large school,\r\nwith his own son, who could not stay there more than a few months.\r\nAfterwards an attempt was made to give him a tutor; but the young man\r\nwas irrevocably ruined. When the tutor saw him he said, “I have come too\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\nIn changing my abode I had in no way changed my situation; milord kept up\r\nhis usual style of living, giving me endless trouble; and those who ought\r\nto have been a comfort to me, treated me with contempt, only saying,\r\n“Really, you are not worthy of your lot; don’t you understand that you\r\nare on the eve of becoming a very wealthy widow, and that soon you will\r\nbe able to do just what you please?”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these fine words, they did not show themselves very\r\nwilling at times to put up with the fits of rage of the irascible old man.\r\n\r\nOne day, when the intoxicating fumes had got greatly into his head, he\r\nprovoked my father by his abuse and rushed at him to strike him. Armed\r\nwith a big stick and wild with rage, my father vigorously returned the\r\nassault, till the noise they made and their outcries attracted a crowd\r\nwhich separated them.\r\n\r\nThe assailant left his house and ordered me to follow him. As I clearly\r\nand positively refused to do so, I received a note in which he informed\r\nme that if I did not do as he asked, he should put an end to his life. I\r\nseized a pen and wrote him these few words—\r\n\r\n    “My old fool, if you wish to give me a proof of your affection,\r\n    make haste and carry out what you announce to your unhappy\r\n    victim,\r\n\r\n                                                           “MARIA.”\r\n\r\nSeveral days went by without my hearing anything about him, and I was\r\nalmost happy; but this calm was but the prelude to the storm.\r\n\r\nOne of his servants came to tell me that he was dangerously ill, and\r\nthat, feeling his last hour to be at hand, he begged to see me that he\r\nmight make important communications to me.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain I answered that I had no wish to receive any; my father\r\npointed out to me that such conduct on my part could not fail to be very\r\nprejudicial to us.\r\n\r\nHe added that he would go with me, and swore that he would bring me back\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nReassured by this promise, I agreed, on condition that our visit should\r\nbe a short one.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, I was greatly astonished at seeing the British Minister\r\nbeside milord’s bed.\r\n\r\nThe supposed sick man held out his hand to me and assured me that it\r\nneeded only my presence for his complete recovery; that he was very sorry\r\nfor having given me so much trouble, and that it should not happen again.\r\n\r\n“I wish you good health,” I replied quickly; “but to return to you is\r\nquite impossible; and I declare to you that if it had not been to please\r\nmy father, you would never have seen me here.”\r\n\r\nI got up at once, and signed to my father to leave.\r\n\r\nHe did not stir; his look revealed the plot to me, and I realized his\r\ndeceitfulness.\r\n\r\nThe Minister did all he could to lessen my vexation, and averred that he\r\ntook upon himself the responsibility for the conduct of my husband in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment that gentleman showed me much attention; he introduced\r\nme to his wife, and procured me the acquaintance of several English\r\nladies, among others the Misses C., with whom I became very intimate,\r\nespecially the second, afterwards the Marchioness of B., my greatest\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nStill I had to endure numberless mortifications; the Italian nobility\r\nlooked down on me, and milord was invited by himself to the great\r\nreceptions. Moreover, my domestic circumstances had become more\r\nunbearable than ever.\r\n\r\nMy husband had insisted on giving me a lady’s-maid of his own country and\r\nchoice, the most worthless of women. In a short time she had succeeded in\r\nwholly captivating her old master, and even more, his son, so that she\r\nruled despotically in the house; nothing was done without her, her advice\r\nwas received like an oracle, and her words were commands no one dared\r\ndisobey. If I allowed myself a comment, she treated me like a child,\r\nand took pleasure in secretly taunting me with my lowly origin and the\r\ncontemptible part I had played in my own despite. I could not take a step\r\nwithout having her at my heels, finding fault with everything I did; and\r\nas my most innocent doings were always malignantly misconstrued, I made\r\nup my mind to give up all outside amusements.\r\n\r\nKeeping to my own room, I had no recreation but music and the care of my\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nOne day when I was petting my favourite sparrow, they came to tell me\r\nthat milord was asking for me to go out driving with him. I went down,\r\nquite resolved to make my rightful complaints to him.…\r\n\r\nOur carriage, having crossed the town, was stopped at the barrier. We\r\nwent to another of the gates and were treated in the same fashion.\r\n\r\nMy husband, in a fury, accused Chiappini of this, and swore to have his\r\nrevenge. He forbade me to hold any communication with him, and ordered\r\nhis abominable confidante never to let me out of her sight. Paying no\r\nattention to his reproofs, I went back quietly to my room.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there arose a great uproar in the next room; I opened the door\r\nand saw milord, followed by three constables, who seized him and dragged\r\nhim away to the fortress.\r\n\r\nThe lady’s-maid screamed aloud and hurled a torrent of abuse at me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she received a letter and went to the prison, after\r\nputting me in charge of two footmen, who took advantage of her absence to\r\nempty a bottle or two.\r\n\r\nHaving myself taken the opportunity to go out on my balcony and breathe\r\nfreely, a note which I saw came from my father was thrown up to me.\r\nJoyfully I picked it up.\r\n\r\nIt told me to hold myself in readiness at a certain hour.\r\n\r\nI hastily put on all my most valuable things, and at the appointed moment\r\nwent quickly downstairs and jumped into a carriage that was at the door.\r\nThere I found my aunt, who tenderly welcomed me, and in no time we\r\nreached Fiesole, where my father told me that, having heard by public\r\nreport that my husband wished to get away without paying his debts, he\r\nhad got leave from the Grand Duke to have him put into safe keeping.\r\n\r\nWalking in the garden on the Sunday, I saw the arrival of his son, who,\r\nas he met me, said,\r\n\r\n“Milady, allow me to offer you some trifles my father sends you.”\r\n\r\nI declared that I would take nothing from him, and that his gifts were as\r\nhateful to me as their giver.\r\n\r\nBut the parcel had already fallen into the hands of my mother, who\r\nwelcomed its bringer with jubilation, and begged him to repeat his visits.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how beautiful!” she cried as she opened the box; “who would have\r\nbelieved milord had such good taste? I’ll wager that several of these\r\nfine things were bought for me.”\r\n\r\nI retorted that she might take them all, and that never in my life would\r\nI touch one of them.\r\n\r\nIt needed nothing further to induce her to take possession of the whole\r\nlot, except the flowers, which she looked upon as worthless.\r\n\r\nThe same messenger reappeared towards the end of the week, and handed me\r\nthe following letter—\r\n\r\n    “My angel, I cannot live without you. Oh! if you knew how\r\n    I weary for you, I am convinced your tender heart would\r\n    break. Come, come, to comfort me. Happiness awaits you with\r\n    me. A large sum of money is being sent to me to meet all my\r\n    obligations, and we will leave Florence soon and go to my own\r\n    dear country, where you will be admired by all the world,\r\n    especially by your humble and affectionate slave.”\r\n\r\nWhile reading these curious sweet things, I had noticed the delight of my\r\nfamily at hearing that a large sum was coming from England, and in it I\r\nsaw the omen of a distressful reconciliation.\r\n\r\nMy father left us at once, and the very same evening I had the misery of\r\nseeing him return with milord, who fell at my feet, saying, “Dear jewel\r\nof my heart, behold your faithful adorer.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he offered me a bouquet, which I threw in his face.\r\n\r\nFar from being offended, he pressed me to his bosom; and while I\r\nstruggled to free myself, my father joined in, declaring that he had no\r\npower over my person, that he could not keep me away any longer, and that\r\nthe law obliged me to live with my husband.\r\n\r\nI felt my blood freeze in my veins; I gave full vent to my indignation; I\r\nstated its causes unreservedly; but the only satisfaction I could obtain\r\nwas the dismissal of my infamous persecutrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n    Integrity of Milord—Preparations—Secret Union—Stay at the\r\n    Hague—Arrival in England—The Country of Wales—My Exaltation—My\r\n    Griefs—My Relations—The Eldest of my Brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pretended report of Lord Newborough’s projected flight was a pure\r\ninvention of my father’s; for I feel bound to say to the credit of\r\nthe first that his integrity stood all proof, and that his too great\r\ngenerosity placed him infinitely above any suspicion of meanness. If he\r\nhad prolonged his stay in Italy, it was simply to enable him to meet all\r\nhis family’s engagements by cutting off for a time a host of superfluous\r\nexpenses his presence in his own country would have necessitated.\r\n\r\nMr. Price had written that he was coming to us; he came, and the\r\npreparations for our journey were begun; the accounts were all made up,\r\nall engagements were met. My father received his 15,000 _francesconi_ and\r\nall the arrears of his pension. It was settled that he should accompany\r\nus to Boulogne, and that my aunt should go with us to England.\r\n\r\nAs we were to travel by land as far as the Hague, my mother managed to\r\ninstil into us a dread of robbers, and insisted on keeping back some of\r\nmy diamonds to wait for a safe opportunity for sending them direct to me.\r\nI need not say that she never found it!…\r\n\r\nOn the eve of our departure it was perceived that the son of milord was\r\nmissing; he was called for, sought for, in vain. My father set to work\r\nall the constables of his acquaintance, and one of them at last succeeded\r\nin discovering him with my former maid, who had fainted. He protested\r\nthat he would never abandon his _lawful wife_; but as this wonderful\r\ntitle rested on nothing more than a kind of clandestine marriage, the\r\nArchbishop of Florence promptly absolved him from his vows. He was made\r\nto listen to reason, and some assistance was given to the forsaken beauty.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this town, I felt the liveliest regret at the separation from\r\nmy grandmother, who had always been so kind to me; as for the rest of my\r\nfamily, indifference was all they aroused in me.\r\n\r\nAt Boulogne I took leave of my father, who, as a final consolation,\r\nassured me I should become a maid-of-honour at the English Court, and\r\nacquire all the titles that had belonged to Lady Catherine Perceval, Lord\r\nNewborough’s first wife.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the Hague, Mr. Price left us to make preparations in\r\nLondon and Wales.\r\n\r\nWe took up our quarters in an hotel, and my husband hastened to leave his\r\ncard on the British Minister, who, being absent, was represented by Lord\r\nH. Spencer, son of the Duke of M., who came to call on us, and offered to\r\npresent me to the Dutch Royal Family, who received me with extraordinary\r\naffability.\r\n\r\nHe also made me acquainted with several of the best families, and my stay\r\nin Holland was a round of drives, games and amusements.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been there six months, Mr. Price wrote that everything was\r\nready for our reception.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in London, my husband introduced me under the name of the\r\n_Marchesina di Modigliana_, the name I still bear in the English Court\r\nCircular.\r\n\r\nAs it was summer, and the greater number of the best families were in the\r\ncountry, there were but few ladies for me to meet, amongst whom I was\r\nespecially attracted by Lady Ford, and we became very intimate friends.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a couple of months in the capital of the British Empire,\r\nwe set forth for Wales, where Lord Newborough’s largest estates and his\r\nfinest mansion, called Glynllifon, were situated. Glynllifon is about six\r\nmiles from Carnarvon in North Wales, and in that town we had the most\r\nmagnificent reception; the horses were taken out of the carriage, and the\r\nyoung men dragged us in their place. We were escorted home by six hundred\r\nmen, all people or friends of milord’s. In the evening our park, as well\r\nas the town and the surrounding estates, were brilliantly illuminated\r\nand filled with a vast crowd that begged at intervals to be allowed to\r\nlook at me. When I complied with their wishes, the air was rent with loud\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nAll the noble families of the neighbourhood came to call on us, and for\r\nsix consecutive months it was like a perpetual _fête_, and we had as many\r\nas fifty guests every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYNLLIFON\r\n\r\nFROM A DRAWING BY THE LATE SIR JOHN ARDAGH]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the winter we went back to London, where my act\r\nof naturalization was at once set about. As my husband had arranged\r\neverything beforehand, there was no difficulty about the matter, and in\r\nless than a month the necessary preliminaries for my presentation at\r\nCourt were accomplished.\r\n\r\nI was presented by Lady Harcourt, chief lady-in-waiting to the Queen,\r\nand was received with the most wonderful marks of regard and admiration.\r\nMy dress of cloth-of-silver, adorned with precious stones, dazzled\r\neverybody, and I was regarded with the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment I had the entry into the highest society, and, instead\r\nof the humiliations I had so often experienced at the hands of my\r\ncompatriots, I found myself surrounded by respect and honour.\r\n\r\nPersonages of the highest rank sought my acquaintance, and thought\r\nthemselves happy to be received by the wife of a noble peer, illustrious\r\ndescendant of the ancient Princes of North Wales, and grandson of the\r\nintimate friend of George I.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, I was far from tasting the sweets of happiness; my\r\naversion for the man to whom I owed all these good things made me envy\r\nthe lot of women belonging to even the lowest classes of society.\r\n\r\nMy only consolation was in pouring out my griefs to my aunt, and even\r\nthat comfort I was to lose. She had never been able to get used to either\r\nthe climate or the customs of my new country; absolutely ignorant of its\r\nlanguage, she could not join in any conversation, and, rosary in hand,\r\nfrom morning till night she told her beads.[2]\r\n\r\nAs her health visibly declined, I felt obliged to give way to the wish\r\nshe had long expressed to return to her native land; but her departure\r\nfilled me with sadness and trouble, and I could not endure the thought\r\nthat the protectress of my childhood would no longer be with me.\r\n\r\nI insured her enough to live upon in comfort, and handed over to her\r\nseveral trunks, either for herself or for my other relatives, from whom\r\nI was always receiving importunate requests, and to whom I constantly\r\nreplied by the perpetual sending of packets.\r\n\r\nMore than half the pin-money milord allowed me went to Italy, not\r\nto speak of the goods of all kinds I was always sending to the same\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nNot content with all this, my father sent us his eldest son, who was a\r\npretty good historical painter, and begged us to look after him. We kept\r\nhim with us for a year, and then my husband sent him to the East Indies,\r\nwhere he cost us a heap of money, as Messrs. Coutts & Co. of London can\r\ntestify.\r\n\r\nHe stayed three years in Calcutta, and then went to the Cape of Good\r\nHope, where he married the daughter of the Danish Consul, to whom Lord\r\nNewborough had given him an introduction. His wife’s brother taking him\r\ninto partnership, in a short time he made a large enough fortune to be\r\nable to enjoy all the comforts of life and to bring up his numerous\r\nfamily, consisting, I believe, of fourteen children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n    Consumption—Death of my Step-son—Birth of my Children—The\r\n    Arrival of Several Members of my Family—Domestic Cares—Milord’s\r\n    Death—My Second Marriage—Much Travel—Fresh Sojourns in Italy—My\r\n    Third Brother—My Behaviour to my Father—His Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eruptions which had been so great an affliction in my childhood\r\ncontinued making their appearance at intervals; but when I was\r\ntwenty-six, the evil having settled on my chest, it was believed that I\r\nshowed strong symptoms of consumption. I was so weak that after walking\r\na few steps I could not breathe; bathed in a cold sweat, I could get no\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSeveral remedies were tried on me without any good result. The doctors\r\nadvising change of air, we set out for Wales; but it was soon seen that\r\nthat cold and damp climate was more hurtful than helpful to me. Not\r\nknowing what else to do, I was ordered to Tunbridge Wells, and it was\r\nthat marvellous specific that gradually restored me.\r\n\r\nI was still only just convalescent, when milord’s son was himself\r\nattacked with a decline, which carried him to his grave.\r\n\r\nHis constitution had been a robust one, but long undermined by his own\r\nerrors it could not make any resistance. He succumbed, after every\r\nmedical expedient had been tried in vain.\r\n\r\nHis father was broken-hearted; in addition to the loss of his only son,\r\nhe saw that his vast estates would pass to relations of whom he had good\r\nreason to complain.\r\n\r\nTo provide against this misfortune as much as possible, he made a will to\r\nthe effect that, if he should die without issue, the larger part of his\r\nproperty should go to the second son of the Minister, Perceval, brother\r\nof his first wife, leaving me at the same time an annuity of £1400, on\r\ncondition that I granted him a favour, until then persistently refused.…\r\n\r\nHis grief was so great, and he had always shown me so much kindness, that\r\nat last I felt it to be my duty to make the most painful sacrifices for\r\nhis sake—I consented to become a mother!…\r\n\r\nWith what transports of gratitude did he not welcome the first signs of\r\nthe fulfilment of his hopes! But even they did not equal his delight\r\nwhen I gave birth to a son. Beside himself with joy, he ordered that no\r\nexpense was to be spared, and gave the most brilliant of entertainments;\r\nthe best families came to it and offered us their heartiest\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I felt then the most delightful emotion, quite new to my\r\nheart and which I recognized as maternal love.\r\n\r\nThis happiness was increased the next year by the birth of a second son,\r\nwhose baptism was celebrated with great pomp. Mr. Perceval and Lord\r\nBulkeley were his godfathers.\r\n\r\nMy father, having heard that I was now sole mistress in my husband’s\r\nhouse, hastened to bring his daughter, to give me, as he said, a pleasant\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThey both appeared in sailor costume, which made me feel greatly ashamed;\r\nand I had them dressed in a proper fashion.\r\n\r\nMy father ran all over London, visited all the places of interest, laid\r\nhis hands on everything he could get in our house, and departed with\r\nwell-lined trunks.\r\n\r\nI kept my sister with me, furnished her with a magnificent wardrobe,\r\nand gave her in abundance everything she could desire; but in spite of\r\nit all, I could never conquer her hardness of heart, and every day she\r\ndistressed me by her constant rudeness.\r\n\r\nHer connection with Lord Newborough brought her in contact with a\r\ndistinguished ecclesiastic, whom she subsequently married.\r\n\r\nWe had just heard that my second brother had got into terrible trouble in\r\nItaly, when he made his appearance in order to secure himself from the\r\nhands of justice, which would have infallibly consigned him to the same\r\nfate as one of his cousins, who was sent to the galleys for ten years.\r\n\r\nMy consternation may be imagined!\r\n\r\nMy husband was furious, and expressed very forcibly to me his disgust at\r\nbeing so tormented by this _insaziabile canaglia_, as he called it. I was\r\nalmost as angry as he; nevertheless, I did my best to quiet him, thinking\r\nto do good to my brother; but his bad conduct soon obliged us to send him\r\naway.\r\n\r\nI got him placed with a merchant at Leghorn, but he, too, could not keep\r\nhim for more than a few months.\r\n\r\nSince my father’s visit I noticed that milord often forbad me to go to\r\nentertainments frequented by the French nobility, especially the Bourbon\r\nPrinces.\r\n\r\nThis fresh antipathy greatly amused me, though I wondered over so odd a\r\nwarning; since at that time I was living in absolute retirement with my\r\nchildren. Having no thought but for them, I lavished endearments on them\r\nand all the care their growing infirmities needed; for I had the grief of\r\nseeing that I had bequeathed them a very sad inheritance. The eruptions\r\nwhich had caused me so much suffering made their appearance very early\r\non their little bodies; the eldest was quite covered with them. Many\r\nremedies were tried, but the root of the evil was never wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\nAlthough their father had never suffered in a similar way, his health,\r\nshattered by other causes, gave way completely; he fell ill of a terrible\r\ndisease which lasted a year and ended in his death. In the midst of his\r\nsevere pains he would take no help but mine; he gave me constant marks of\r\nlove, and to give it effectual expression he considerably increased my\r\nannuity.\r\n\r\nIt was in my arms that he drew his last breath, on the 11th of October,\r\n1807.\r\n\r\nHis funeral was solemnized with all the pomp befitting his rank and\r\nfortune; all the people of distinction made a point of attending it and\r\ndid not fail to pay their touching tributes of condolence to my grief.\r\n\r\nThe deceased had assigned for his children’s education a sum which\r\nwas thought insufficient; a larger was put at my disposal by the Lord\r\nChancellor; but it was ruled that I should lose it, as well as my\r\nguardianship, if I married again.\r\n\r\nMy youth was so far past that at first this condition seemed useless and\r\nridiculous to me.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I went to drink the waters at Cheltenham, and there I met a\r\nRussian Baron, called Ungern Sternberg, who paid me immense attention;\r\nI was charmed with his kindness, enchanted with his fine manners. He\r\nloved music, dancing, riding, and a hundred other things I, too, liked.\r\nThis peculiar similarity of tastes brought us together and soon formed a\r\nstrong tie between us.\r\n\r\nLater on I met him in the best houses in London, especially and on\r\nseveral occasions at that of General Hughes, whose wife constantly\r\nentertained me with accounts of the wonderful merits of the gentleman,\r\nnever tiring of exalting his talents and virtues.\r\n\r\nThinking she saw that I thoroughly agreed with her, she told me that he\r\nintended to ask for my hand. Such an idea never having entered my head,\r\nI looked upon it as an idle tale and laughed at it. But she returned to\r\nthe charge; her husband joined in, and the Baron himself made me a formal\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nSeeing that this was a serious matter, I did not hesitate in giving an\r\nabsolute refusal; alleging my position with regard to my two sons.\r\n\r\nEvery possible step was taken to make me believe that it would be easy\r\nfor me to obtain permission to retain all my rights over them.\r\n\r\nMy objections were contested so cleverly; I was so lulled with hopes;\r\nsuch earnest and well-worded entreaties were made to me, that it became\r\nwell-nigh impossible to make any further opposition. I yielded, and made\r\nup my mind to contract a second union which everything around me combined\r\nto represent to me in the most tempting light.\r\n\r\nMy consent given, my future husband went to carry the news to his own\r\nfamily, while I went to Lady Charlotte Bellasis, my late husband’s niece\r\nby marriage, at Newborough Park.\r\n\r\nThe Baron joined me there, and our wedding was celebrated on the 11th of\r\nSeptember, 1810.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards we returned to London to prepare for our departure.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe the grief I felt at having to dismiss my\r\nservants; still less will I try to describe the anguish of my heart when\r\nI realized that it was vain to dream of keeping the guardianship of my\r\nchildren. Milord’s executors were inexorable, they tore them from me.\r\n\r\nHaving left at the beginning of November, we travelled across Switzerland\r\nin severe cold, and did not arrive in Petersburg until the last fortnight\r\nof January.\r\n\r\nCount Pahlen, our uncle, First Minister to the Emperor, received us in\r\nthe most friendly fashion; he introduced me to the highest society, and,\r\nbut for the bitter coldness of the weather, I should have taken part in\r\nall their gaieties.\r\n\r\nIf I was not presented at Court, it was because, as an English lady, such\r\na presentation should have been made by the English Ambassador, and at\r\nthat time there was not one, in consequence of the war between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I was admitted to look on at a brilliant entertainment\r\ninside the Palace; and the Emperor Alexander, having noticed me amongst\r\nthe other lady spectators, commanded his first gentleman-in-waiting to\r\nshow me all the splendours of that delightful residence.\r\n\r\nEverything I looked at, and still more the universal courtesy of manner,\r\npromptly convinced me of the great mistake it is to look upon the Russian\r\nnation as behindhand in European civilization.\r\n\r\nSpring having brought back warmth, we went to Reval, to offer our\r\nrespects to my mother-in-law, who welcomed us warmly, and showed me much\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nA little later we set sail for the Island of Dago, where lay the Baron de\r\nSternberg’s principal estates.\r\n\r\nAll his acquaintances there received me with enthusiasm, and did their\r\nbest to divert my mind; but with no success until the birth, in the\r\nfollowing month, of a third son, whom I called Edward, after his father.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe what this newly-born son was to me, especially when\r\nhis first signs of intelligence made me foresee that he would become more\r\nand more worthy of my love?\r\n\r\nFeeling unable to let him be out of my sight for a moment, I took him\r\nwith me the first time I went to see his brothers.\r\n\r\nI had the comfort of finding them pretty well in health; but alas! it was\r\nbut too evident to me that perfidious skill had been at work in filling\r\ntheir minds with unjust prejudices against her who had always loved them\r\nso tenderly. In spite of their goodness of heart, they could not help\r\nshowing a certain coolness which greatly grieved me.\r\n\r\nI set to work to revive their old love for me, and flatter myself I\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a year my husband came to fetch me in one of his own\r\nvessels, manned by his own people, in which I lived as in a house of my\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWhile in England I had been given several very great curiosities, among\r\nothers a fan from the East Indies and a magnificent bird-of-paradise\r\nfeather; I added to these a little piece of work I had made out of the\r\nrarest shells then known, and took the liberty of sending the whole to\r\nher Majesty the Empress Elizabeth, who most graciously had a delightful\r\nand flattering letter written to me, and sent with it a magnificent clasp\r\nset with brilliants.\r\n\r\nBut I will tell nothing more of my return to Russia nor of another\r\njourney to England I made. Let us go back to my parents.\r\n\r\nMy father had written to me of the deaths, one after another, of my\r\nsecond brother, my grandmother and my mother; and he was constantly\r\nexpressing the most intense wish to embrace me once more before he\r\nhimself followed them to the grave.\r\n\r\nAt last I yielded to his pressing entreaties, moved greatly by a vague\r\nhope I had always kept of seeing again the old Countess Borghi, of whose\r\ndeath I had never positively heard.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Italy I made inquiries about her which resulted in my\r\nhearing that she had died when I was scarcely nine years old.\r\n\r\nMy father, aunt and brother joined me at the hotel where I had put up for\r\nthe time; they were all in excellent health.\r\n\r\nMy brother became my intimate confidant; I told him all my affairs and\r\nput all my concerns into his hands, delegating my authority to him.\r\n\r\nVery soon I noticed that he was received very coldly in the good houses\r\nto which I took him; I asked one of my old friends the reason for this,\r\nto be told by her that the young man, having behaved very badly during\r\nthe course of his studies at the University of Pisa, where he took his\r\ndegree in Law, had brought back with him a doubtful reputation, which day\r\nby day grew worse.\r\n\r\nMy own experience promptly showed me that these suspicions were far from\r\nbeing without foundation; and thenceforth I left off confiding in him.…\r\n\r\nFor two consecutive years I took every care of my father; not only did I\r\nprovide for his wants, but I invited him to my table; I desired him to\r\ncome to the parties I gave; I tried to cheer him up by my talk; I made\r\nmuch of him; while, on his side, he always showed me the most profound\r\nrespect, never calling me anything but milady, and behaving to me like a\r\nhumble retainer.\r\n\r\nIn vain I implored him to remember that I owed my existence to him; to\r\ncall me his daughter and to treat me like one; I saw that my loving\r\nreproaches awoke no sweet transports of paternal affection. He scarcely\r\nventured to look me in the face, and spoke only of his gratitude,\r\nconstantly repeating that I had been his lucky star and mumbling the word\r\n“Borghi” and another that he never finished.\r\n\r\nThis confusion and these many mysterious speeches seemed to me the signs\r\nof approaching mental aberration and made me very uneasy.\r\n\r\nAt last he fell dangerously ill, and I was inconsolable. I sent for\r\ndoctors; I got three attendants for him, and ordered that he was to have\r\nevery comfort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIA STELLA, LADY NEWBOROUGH\r\n\r\nFROM A BUST AT GLYNLLIFON]\r\n\r\nOne day they came to tell me that on recovering from a sudden attack he\r\nhad uttered my name and asked to see me. I flew to his bedside, kissing\r\nhim and weeping over him. He looked at me with eyes full of sorrow,\r\npressed my hand, and struggled hard to make himself understood; but his\r\nparalysed tongue refused to articulate anything but: “_Mio Dio!_—Barant,\r\nBaranto——”\r\n\r\nI was overcome with grief at his state; I was advised to go; they led me\r\naway and put me into my carriage.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow my brother sent me word that the poor dying man being no\r\nbetter than on the previous day, a visit from me could not fail to be\r\nhurtful rather than helpful. On the following days he wrote to me in the\r\nsame fashion, and at last came himself to tell me, with every sign of\r\ngrief and affliction, that our father was no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PART\r\n\r\nFROM THE DEATH OF HIM I HAD BELIEVED MY FATHER UNTIL THE PRESENT TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n    The Funeral—Sea-baths—Rupture with my Brother—My Establishment\r\n    at Siena—Chiappini’s Letter—My Reflections—First Steps—Various\r\n    Pieces of Information—Verification of Handwriting—Visit of my\r\n    Elder Son—Stay in Rome—The Marchioness of B.—Departure of my\r\n    Children.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother appeared to be so much affected by his recent loss that, in\r\nspite of the coolness existing between us for some time past, I kept him\r\nto sleep at my country house.\r\n\r\nAll the evening he seemed to be sunk in deep thought and overwhelming\r\ngrief, which greatly surprised me in a young man who up to then had shown\r\nso many signs of a want of filial affection. He left very early the next\r\nmorning without taking leave of me.\r\n\r\nI at once sent him the sum necessary for having the funeral solemnized in\r\na fashion in accordance not with the lowly condition of the deceased, but\r\nwith all the dignity due to my own rank.\r\n\r\nThe marble beneath which lie his mortal remains bears witness to my\r\nliberality, very unlike that of my sister, who, being present at her\r\nmother’s death, allowed her body to be cast into the common pit, when a\r\ndozen crowns would have procured her a more honoured grave.\r\n\r\nMy constantly recurring eruptions had induced my doctors to prescribe\r\nsea-bathing; my father’s illness having deferred the carrying out of\r\ntheir orders, I prepared to do so a fortnight after his death, which took\r\nplace towards the end of January 1821, and went to spend three weeks at\r\nLeghorn, where I should have been horribly bored if it had not been for\r\nthe company of my Edward, who never left me.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Florence I found out the various tricks my brother had\r\nplayed on me, first in concealing from me the real condition of my\r\nfather, who, I learnt, had recovered his power of speech before breathing\r\nhis last, and whose death had not taken place until thirty-six hours\r\nafter the time reported to me; secondly, in persuading me to pay the\r\npurchase money of a fine house, supposed to be for me, but the deed of\r\npurchase of which he had had made out in his own name, on the pretext\r\nthat a married woman could not do so validly.\r\n\r\nJustly incensed at his conduct, I not only upbraided him bitterly, but\r\nignominiously cast him out and gave him up absolutely and finally.\r\n\r\nSurrounded as I was by nothing but gloomy memories, in a place where\r\neverything recalled troubles and misfortunes, I resolved to go to Siena,\r\nand began at once to make my preparations.\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons that induced me to fix on that town, among\r\nothers its pure air and the famous School of Design which is its chief\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nI was well acquainted with the head master of this school, and he had\r\nkindly promised me to take the greatest pains with my young son, who\r\nalready showed decided taste and talent for this admirable art.\r\n\r\nI had been living in this town about a week when I received by post the\r\nletter I give here, with its translation.\r\n\r\n    _Miledi._\r\n\r\n    _Giunsi finalmente al termine di miei giorni senza vere svelato\r\n    ad alcuno un segreto che riguarda me e la vostra persona\r\n    direttamente._\r\n\r\n    _Il segreto è l’appresso:_\r\n\r\n    _Il giorno dell a vostra nascita da persona che non posso\r\n    nominare, e che già è passata all’ altra vita, a me pure nacque\r\n    un figlio maschio. Fui richesto à fare uno scambio, e mediante\r\n    l emie finanze, di quei tempi, accedi alle molteplici richieste\r\n    con vantaggio; ed allora fù che vi adottai per mia figlia, in\r\n    quella guisa che mio figlio fu adottato dall’ altra parte._\r\n\r\n    _Vedo che il cielo ha supplito alle mie mancanze, con porvi in\r\n    uno stato di miglior condizione del vostro padre, sebbene esso\r\n    pure fosse per rango quasi simile, ed è ció che mi fa chiudere\r\n    con qualche quiete il termine di mia vita._\r\n\r\n    _Serva a voi questa operazionne per non farmi colpevole,\r\n    totalmente; domandovi perdono di questa mia mancanza, vi prego,\r\n    se vi piace, di tenere in voi questa cosa, per non far parlare\r\n    il mondo di un affare che non vi ha più rimedio._\r\n\r\n    _Non vi sara consegnata questa mia che dopo la mia morte._\r\n\r\n                                               _Lorenzo Chiappini._\r\n\r\n    Milady\r\n\r\n    I have come to the end of my days without having ever revealed\r\n    to any one a secret which directly concerns you and me.\r\n\r\n    This is the secret. The day you were born of a person I must\r\n    not name, and who has already passed into the next world, a boy\r\n    was also born to me. I was requested to make an exchange, and,\r\n    in view of my circumstances at that time, I consented after\r\n    reiterated and advantageous proposals; and it was then that\r\n    I adopted you as my daughter, as in the same way my son was\r\n    adopted by the other party.\r\n\r\n    I see that Heaven has made up for my fault, since you have been\r\n    placed in a better position than your father’s, although he was\r\n    of almost similar rank; and it is this that enables me to end\r\n    my life in something of peace.\r\n\r\n    Keep this in your possession, so that I may not be held totally\r\n    guilty. Yes, while begging your forgiveness for my sin, I ask\r\n    you, if you please, to keep it hidden, so that the world may\r\n    not be set talking over a matter that cannot be remedied.\r\n\r\n    Even this letter will not be sent to you till after my death.\r\n\r\n                                                 LORENZO CHIAPPINI.\r\n\r\nThe amazement such a missive caused me may well be imagined. In an\r\ninstant a crowd of ideas rushed upon me; the veil was rent, the cloud\r\ndispersed. At once I realized the reason for the immense differences\r\nbetween myself and my supposed relatives.\r\n\r\nI saw the reason for the ill-treatment I had endured at the hands of a\r\nwoman perhaps forced into calling herself my mother; I understood the\r\nmeaning of those many muttered enigmatical half-sentences of my first\r\nhusband, and still more those of the writer of the astounding letter I\r\nheld in my hand.\r\n\r\nThere was but one mystery left to clear up, and that was precisely the\r\none I was implored to let alone.\r\n\r\nBut the man who had so implored me was now in my eyes nothing but a\r\ncriminal for me to forgive, his paternity destroyed, his rights broken,\r\nand my duty to him annihilated, or rather born anew—enjoined on me by\r\nhonour and the love I bore my children—namely, to try every possible\r\nmeans to discover my real father.\r\n\r\nIn my anxiety I hastened to the postmaster, as if he were the person to\r\ngive me useful information; but all he could tell me was that the letter\r\nin question had come in the bag from Florence and under the postmark of\r\nthat town; but he directed me to an old man, a native of Faenza, to whom\r\nI went at once. He could tell me nothing at the time; but he wrote, and\r\nreceived an answer that there were two maid-servants of the Countess\r\nCamilla still living, and that there was a new Count Biancoli-Borghi, a\r\nrelation and heir of the Count Pompeo, whose widow he had even married.\r\n\r\nFor my part I had written to the Fathers Ringrezzi and Fabroni, the\r\nfirst-named confessor to the former jailer, the other the nephew of the\r\nconfessor of the late old Countess.\r\n\r\nHaving accepted the invitation I sent them to come and see me, Father\r\nRingrezzi told me at once that his calling bound him to inviolable\r\nsecrecy, but added that his private opinion had always been that I was\r\nthe child of the Grand Duke Leopold.\r\n\r\nAt this, Father Fabroni eagerly exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“You are wrong, Monsieur l’Abbé. Milady is the daughter of a French\r\nnobleman, called the Comte Joinville, who had great possessions in\r\nChampagne; and I have no doubt that if Madame la Baronne went to that\r\nprovince she would find documents that I have been told were handed over\r\nto a worthy ecclesiastic.”\r\n\r\nOn this combined advice, I decided to return at once to Florence to get\r\nfurther information. I had the satisfaction of finding no incredulity; my\r\nmany friends all told me that they had never believed I belonged to the\r\nfamily of the Chiappinis.\r\n\r\nI was told that the constable, having at one time been in danger on\r\naccount of his political opinions, had entrusted the lady Massina\r\nCalamini with some papers which he told her were of the highest\r\nimportance, and which he carefully reclaimed the very moment he was set\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nIt is equally certain that he had a great number in a strong box, the key\r\nof which he never gave up to any one whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBut it was impossible to get anything from his son, except a few letters\r\nof no consequence, which he had already shown me with a laugh as being\r\nthe only asset of his inheritance.\r\n\r\nAs to her whom up to now I had called my aunt, she came to see me\r\nseveral times, and I continued to look after her welfare.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that her brother had been quite capable of the thing he\r\nhad so tardily confessed to me; she even maintained that she remembered\r\nhis wife, in her fits of rage often throwing these cutting words at him—\r\n\r\n“You monster! Have you forgotten that you’ve committed a crime worthy of\r\nthe gallows?”\r\n\r\nCount Borghi and the two old maid-servants living at Faenza having been\r\napplied to for information, the latter replied that first of all they\r\nwished to see me and to speak to me alone; the Count indignantly asserted\r\nthat I had made an unpardonable mistake about him, and swore that he\r\nwould make me pay dearly for it.\r\n\r\nNot knowing what more to do, I went and asked a clever lawyer what steps\r\nI ought to take. He told me I must submit Chiappini’s letter to the\r\nauthorities and have it legally verified.\r\n\r\nAs this verification entailed great formalities and much delay, I went\r\nback to Leghorn to continue my sea-bathing. I soon heard the news that\r\nmy two elder sons were coming to visit me; my heart overflowed with joy;\r\nI hastened to meet them, and received them at Florence.\r\n\r\nThey rapturously embraced me and gave me a thousand proofs of their love\r\nfor me. We spent five delightful weeks together, and about the middle of\r\nNovember they started for Rome. I could not accompany them; my presence\r\nhad become indispensable to accelerate my business, which still lasted\r\nmore than another month.\r\n\r\nAt last the experts, having carefully compared the writing submitted to\r\nthem with several authentic signatures, decided that it was entirely in\r\nthe hand of Lorenzo Chiappini.[3]\r\n\r\nAs soon as this was finished, I hastened to join my children, and managed\r\nto arrive on the first day of the year 1823, so as to give them my\r\npresents and renew the heartfelt proofs of my love for them, which they\r\nreceived with touching gratitude and profound respect.\r\n\r\nThe first thing they told me of was their fortunate meeting with my old\r\nand most faithful friend, the Marchioness of B., who was looking forward\r\nwith the liveliest impatience for the moment of my arrival. My delight\r\nwas at its height; seeing her once more seemed to give me back a part of\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThey went very fast—those happy days I spent with her and my three\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nObliged to return to England, she gave me two letters of introduction to\r\nuse after the journey to France which I intended to make; one was for the\r\nDuke of Orleans, the other for the British Ambassador.\r\n\r\nShe earnestly begged them to give me their powerful assistance, and,\r\nmoreover, entreated the first to be so kind as to present me to his\r\nsister, who, she said, would soon become my friend, since my features and\r\nmanners were exactly like hers.\r\n\r\nMy son was close upon one-and-twenty, and was bound to be in London on\r\nthe 3rd of April, the day he would attain his majority, in order to take\r\nhis seat in Parliament.\r\n\r\nConsequently, he and his brother left Rome about the end of February. I\r\nwent with them to Florence, to Pisa, and to Leghorn, and there I said my\r\nlast farewell to them.\r\n\r\nNever was anything sadder or more harrowing than this cruel separation; a\r\nsecret presentiment warned me, alas! that it would be but too long a one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n    Return to Rome—Departure from Florence—Testimony of the Sisters\r\n    Bandini—My Arrival in Champagne and in Paris—An Innocent\r\n    Ruse—Colonel Joinville—The Abbé de Saint-Fare—Visit to the\r\n    Palais-Royal—My Reflections—Lady Stuart—Advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving my two eldest sons, I took the road to Rome, where I had\r\nalready made the acquaintance of Cardinal Consalvi, who showed me the\r\ngreatest kindness. By his order, all the archives were thrown open to\r\nme; everything was examined into, not only in the capital, but in the\r\ncountry round about the Apennines; but everywhere the answer was the\r\nsame: “Nothing whatever has been discovered; everything must have been\r\ndestroyed during the Revolution.”\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was nothing to be done there, I set out for Faenza,\r\nwhere I was informed that the Count Borghi was absent, and that,\r\nmoreover, it would be useless for me to see him, as he had declared\r\nthat he would never tell me anything at all. I heard even that he had\r\nthreatened the old servant-women with the withholding of their modest\r\npensions if they had the ill-luck of speaking to me. But they could not\r\nrestrain their longing to see me or the cry of their consciences. Their\r\nfirst words when they met me were a simultaneous exclamation of “O Dio!\r\nhow like you are to the Comtesse de Joinville!”\r\n\r\nI joyfully welcomed them and treated them gently; and having implored\r\nthem to acquaint me with the details concerning my birth, they at last\r\nconsented to speak perfectly openly.\r\n\r\n“Our father, Nicholas Bandini,” they told me, “at the age of seventeen\r\nentered the Borghi mansion as chief steward, and never left it till\r\nhis death. We, also, were taken on there in our youth as maids to the\r\nCountess Camilla. That lady, with her son, the Comte Pompeo, was in the\r\nhabit of spending a good part of the year at their castle of Modigliana,\r\nand in the beginning of the spring of 1773 we accompanied them there.\r\n\r\n“On our arrival we found, already established in the Pretorial Palace,\r\na French couple, called the Comte Louis and the Comtesse Joinville.\r\nThe Comte had a fine figure, a rather brown complexion, and a red and\r\npimpled nose. As to the Comtesse, you can see almost her perfect image in\r\nyour own person, milady.\r\n\r\n“Being such near neighbours, the greatest intimacy soon existed between\r\nthem and our masters. Every day the two families met, sometimes at one\r\nhouse, sometimes at the other.\r\n\r\n“The foreign stranger was extremely familiar with people of the lowest\r\nrank, especially with Chiappini, the jailer, who lived under the same\r\nroof. As it happened, both their wives were then _enceinte_, and the two\r\nconfinements appeared to be imminent.\r\n\r\n“But the Comte was seriously anxious; his wife had not yet given him a\r\nmale child; and he was intensely uneasy lest he should never have one,\r\nwhen of this very fear was born an idea, both barbarous and advantageous.\r\nFirst he broached the subject to the Count Pompeo and his mother, from a\r\nvery charming point of view; then he endeavoured to worm himself more and\r\nmore into the warder’s confidence, and ended by telling him that, seeing\r\nhimself about to lose a great inheritance absolutely dependent on the\r\nbirth of a son, he was quite willing, in case he should have a daughter,\r\nto exchange her for a boy, whose father he would largely recompense.\r\n\r\n“The man who listened to his words, delighted to find unlooked-for luck\r\nat so appropriate a moment, did not hesitate for an instant; he accepted\r\nthe offer, and the matter was settled on the spot.\r\n\r\n“We know it,” the sisters Bandini went on, “because we heard it with our\r\nown ears; and we know, too, that the event justified the precautions\r\ntaken; the Comtesse gave birth to a daughter, and the other woman to a\r\nson. The news was brought to our masters, and one of us going into the\r\nPretorial Palace to see the newly-born children, was assured by some\r\nwomen of the house that the exchange had really taken place. Chiappini,\r\nwho was present, confirmed it in his own words. Later on, the Countess\r\nCamilla often repeated it to us; she used to say that the Comtesse\r\nJoinville had been told all about it, and had seemed quite content.\r\n\r\n“Soon after this abominable crime we ourselves saw the Comte and the\r\njailer on the best of terms; the first because he had secured immense\r\nprofit; the other because he had received much money. Although silence\r\nhad been promised, there were indiscreet people, and public rumour soon\r\naccused the authors of this horrible transaction. The Comte Louis,\r\ndreading the general indignation of his accusers, fled and hid himself\r\nat Brisighella, in the convent of St. Bernard. We knew that he had been\r\narrested and then set at liberty, but we never saw him again.\r\n\r\n“The lady left with her servants and her reputed son, while her\r\nown daughter, baptized by the name of Maria Stella Petronilla, and\r\ndescribed as belonging to Lorenzo Chiappini and Vincenzia Viligenti,\r\nalways remained with these last. Our mistress was constantly distressed\r\nabout this misfortune. To repair it as much as possible she kept the\r\nunfortunate child near her, caressing her and giving her all kinds of\r\npresents, treating her not with ordinary friendliness, but with every\r\nmark of ardent love. So she behaved to this child for the first four\r\nyears, that is to say, till Chiappini took her with him to Florence,\r\nwhere he had her educated, and where he bought property with the price of\r\nhis frightful bargain.”\r\n\r\nThus spoke my venerable septuagenarians.\r\n\r\nFully satisfied with their story, there seemed no need of more, and that\r\nnow it would be enough to appear before my iniquitous parents and obtain\r\nfrom them just reparation.\r\n\r\nWith this plan I set out for France with my third son, his\r\ndrawing-master, my maid, and my courier, a faithful and intelligent\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nBy the Sieur Fabroni’s advice, we went straight to Champagne, and the\r\nmere name of the place led us to Joinville. I asked the magistrates\r\nfor information, and was told by them all that no nobleman of the\r\nneighbourhood bore the name of their city, and that it belonged solely to\r\nthe Orleans family.\r\n\r\nAfter several inquiries, which all had the same result, I went to Paris,\r\narriving on July 5, 1823. As a cleverly used ruse may bring about an act\r\nof justice, and as the bait of riches is nowadays the most powerful of\r\nmotives, I had the following advertisement inserted in several newspapers—\r\n\r\n    “The widow of the late Count Pompeo Borghi has asked Lady N.\r\n    S. to find for her in France a certain Louis, Comte Joinville,\r\n    who, with the Comtesse, his wife, was at Modigliana, a little\r\n    town in the Apennines, where the Comtesse gave birth to a son\r\n    on the 16th of April, 1773. If these two persons are still\r\n    living, or the child born at Modigliana, Lady N. S. has the\r\n    honour to announce to them that she has been empowered to make\r\n    them a communication of the highest interest. Supposing that\r\n    these persons can prove their identity, they have only to apply\r\n    to the Baronne de Sternberg, Hôtel de Belle-Vue, Rue de Rivoli.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later appeared a colonel bearing the much-desired name; I\r\nreceived him with the warmest welcome. He spoke, recounting his various\r\ntitles. Alas! the one that had at first interested me so immensely was\r\nquite recent, and came to him from Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I was told that M. l’Abbé de Saint-Fare solicited the\r\nhonour of an interview; the colonel looked much astonished, and withdrew.\r\nIn his place entered an enormous man, wearing spectacles and supported by\r\ntwo footmen. As soon as he was seated, the following conversation took\r\nplace—\r\n\r\n“The Duke of Orleans, having seen your advertisement, has this morning\r\nbegged me to come and make inquiries about this inheritance; for we\r\npresume that that is the matter in question, and at the date you mention\r\nthere was no one in existence outside the family to whom the title of\r\nComte Joinville could belong.”\r\n\r\n“Was Monseigneur the Duke of Orleans born at Modigliana on the 16th of\r\nApril, 1773?”\r\n\r\n“He was born that year, but in Paris, on the 6th of October.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am very sorry that you should have taken the trouble to come; for\r\nin that case he has no connection with the person I am looking for.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt you have heard it said that the late Duke was very gay with\r\nthe fair sex, and the child in question might well be that of one of his\r\nfavourites.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; its legitimacy is incontestable.”\r\n\r\n“Could anything be more surprising! It is true the late Duke lived in the\r\nmidst of mysteries.”\r\n\r\n“Could you not describe him to me, Monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly, madame. He was a fine man, with a good leg; his complexion\r\nwas of a rather dark red, and, if it had not been for the numerous\r\npimples on his face, he would have been very good-looking.”\r\n\r\n“And his character?”\r\n\r\n“What people principally admired in him was his extreme affability to\r\nevery one.”\r\n\r\n“Your description agrees exactly with that that was given me of the Comte\r\nde Joinville.”\r\n\r\n“Then it must be supposed that it was the Duke himself.”\r\n\r\n“That can’t be if it is true that his son was born in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“May I ask you if there is a large sum to be had, and when?”\r\n\r\n“I am truly sorry not to be able to inform you; I am not at liberty to\r\nsay more.”\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this conversation, the big abbé had never left off\r\nlooking at me in an almost offensive way; and, trying to find out what\r\nwas my native tongue, he had spoken now in English, now in Italian,\r\nwithout being able to make up his mind, in consequence of my speaking\r\nboth languages equally well.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour’s talk he took leave, asking my permission to come again.\r\nI replied that I should be delighted to see him again, and, in my\r\nturn, begged him to be so good as to make inquiries amongst his many\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nHe kindly promised to do so, and added that he knew a very aged lady\r\nfrom Champagne very well, and that she might be able to give him much\r\ninformation, which he would transmit to me at once.\r\n\r\nAs nothing came of it, I sent M. Coiron, a teacher of French, who was\r\ngiving lessons to my son, to him.\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Fare treated him politely, pleaded indisposition, and made\r\nall manner of excuses.\r\n\r\nOn Coiron presenting himself a second time, he was received very coldly,\r\nand simply told that nothing had yet been done.\r\n\r\nMoved by his own zeal and without my authority, he made a third attempt.\r\nThen the abbé told him plainly that he might discontinue his visits; that\r\nthe lady knew nothing at all, and that he himself did not want to have\r\nanything to do with this fuss.\r\n\r\nStill, the first impression his visit made on me could not be effaced.\r\nI procured a ticket, and went with my friends to the Palais Royal.\r\nWhat was my surprise on seeing in some of the portraits their extreme\r\nresemblance either to me or to my children. My astonishment increased\r\nwhen my young Edward, catching sight of a picture I had not yet noticed,\r\nexclaimed, “Dieu! Maman, how much that face is like old Chiappini’s and\r\nhis son’s!”\r\n\r\nWe discovered that it was actually the portrait of the present Duke.…\r\n\r\nThinking seriously over this, I realized that I owed to him in fact the\r\nimportant service of being the first to tear the impenetrable veil by\r\ndeputing that Abbé de Saint-Fare, who, I was told, was not only his great\r\nfriend, but his natural uncle, to see me.\r\n\r\nIt will be believed that from that moment all my researches went in the\r\ndirection so obviously pointed out, and, above all, that I took good care\r\nto keep possession of the letter the Marchioness of B. had given me for\r\n_his Highness_.\r\n\r\nAs for that she had been good enough to write about me to the British\r\nAmbassador, I myself left it with my card at the door of his house. A\r\nweek later, his wife, Lady Stuart, simply sent her name by a footman\r\nas sole answer; which greatly astonished me from a lady of title,\r\na relation of my friend’s and daughter of the Earl and Countess of\r\nHardwicke, with whom I had been formerly very intimate.\r\n\r\nI was advised that, finding no support in that quarter, and having\r\nhenceforth to fight against wealth and power, I had better go back to\r\nItaly to take every necessary measure and to collect all quite authentic\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n    My Return to Faenza—First Visit of the Count Borghi—His\r\n    Story—Public Rumours—Evidence of Messieurs Valla, Guerzani,\r\n    Tondini, Ludovichetti, della Valle, Perelli and Maresta—My\r\n    Letter to the Count—His Second Visit—Legal Formalities—Judgment\r\n    in my Favour—Decree of Rectification.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving France, I made several discoveries which more and more\r\nstrongly confirmed my suspicions as to the personality of the Comte\r\nJoinville. But my first object being to find proof of the exchange\r\nitself, I went again to the place where it had been effected.\r\n\r\nAs I passed through Turin, Alessandria, Reggio, etc., I employed several\r\npeople to make inquiries for me. At Modena I made the acquaintance of the\r\nlawyer, Massa, who had a great reputation, and who clearly marked out for\r\nme the course I ought to take. At Bologna I engaged an advocate whom this\r\ngentleman had recommended to me; but I was soon obliged to give him up on\r\naccount of his dilatoriness, and replaced him by the Signore Bucci, of\r\nFaenza.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at that town, I went to stay with the Marchesa di Spada,\r\nto whom I had an introduction.\r\n\r\nAs she was very intimate with Count Borghi, I had conceived the hope of\r\nobtaining through her useful information, and especially the return of\r\ncertain papers that gentleman, it was said, boasted of having in his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nShe wrote to him, but there was no answer. I then called upon the Bishop\r\nof the diocese, claiming from him a perfectly impartial investigation\r\nof my case, assuring him that I asked for nothing but justice, and\r\nentreating him to persuade the Count to accept my invitation.\r\n\r\nThe prelate strongly backed my request, and Count Borghi, not daring\r\nto refuse him, at last came to see me, bringing with him an enormous\r\npacket of letters which he declared he had received from me. They bore\r\nthe fictitious name of my so-called man-of-business, and were evidently\r\nwritten with the intention of incensing against me a man who might prove\r\nso helpful to me.[4]\r\n\r\nMy astonishment was beyond words, and I made such eager protestations of\r\nmy innocence in the matter that he was quite convinced of the truth, and\r\nspoke to me as follows—\r\n\r\n“I have often had occasion to look over old papers belonging to the\r\nBorghi family, of whom I became the representative; and one day when I\r\nwas doing so at Modigliana I saw a letter addressed to the late Count\r\nPompeo, dated from Turin and signed _Louis, Comte de Joinville_, the\r\ncontents of which, so far as I can remember, were as follows—\r\n\r\n“‘Since we left that place, my wife, always prolific of girls, has at\r\nlast presented me with a boy. As to the one of whom you know, there is\r\nleft only the grief of having lost him, and I feel no _further scruples_\r\non his account. My compliments to your ladies, and believe me, etc.’\r\n\r\n“This letter greatly struck me, and I examined it more than once; but\r\nthen I considered it of no importance, and I ended by tearing it up,\r\nwithout attempting to remember the date.”\r\n\r\n“In the account-books of an old steward, which I looked over likewise,\r\nthe name of the jailer, Lorenzo Chiappini, was often written; and I\r\nnoticed that before 1773 this person bought his necessary provisions of\r\nthe Borghis, by relinquishing a part of his future salary; while, after\r\nthat time, he always paid in ready money for corn and wine of the best\r\nquality. These account-books could not now be discovered, because when I\r\nhad looked through them I gave them back to the aforesaid steward, who is\r\nno longer living.”\r\n\r\nWho could believe that, with no motive, this gentleman could have parted\r\nwith papers relating to an inheritance just fallen to him, and which he\r\nhad looked into minutely? Still less, who could believe that he could\r\nhave destroyed a paper that had so greatly interested him, that he had\r\nread several times, and whose tenor was so deeply graven on his mind?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in order to prove to me that he now bore me no ill-will, he\r\nbestirred himself to make others speak.\r\n\r\nVery soon the voice of the public was quite on my side; every one knew\r\nof Chiappini’s sudden accession of wealth; every one remembered hearing\r\nsomething about the Signore Joinville and his excessive familiarity.\r\n\r\nIt was generally assumed that the jailer’s wife, going to her Easter\r\nconfession a few days after the exchange, had been ordered by her\r\ndirector to denounce its principal perpetrator to the Holy Office. It was\r\nsaid that this Tribunal, having ordered his arrest, the Count had been\r\nwarned, and fearing the probably unpleasant results of this order, had\r\nasked and obtained permission to take refuge in a convent at Brisighella\r\nuntil the storm had blown over.\r\n\r\nIt was affirmed also that, having ventured to go out for a walk, he was\r\nseized and taken to the Town Hall, where one of his footmen went to spend\r\nthree or four days with him, and where he spent money profusely and\r\nrecklessly. In conclusion it was added that the Legate of Ravenna, having\r\nsent for him, as he got into his carriage, he was holding in his hand a\r\npaper that he pointed to with a laugh, as if to say—\r\n\r\n“I’ve only got to make myself known!”\r\n\r\nBut I was not satisfied by these vague, general reports; I wanted\r\nwitnesses who had seen with their own eyes and heard with their own ears;\r\nand I succeeded in discovering them.\r\n\r\nNot to speak of the sisters Bandini, who related what happened in the\r\nbosom of the families into which they were admitted as confidential\r\nservants, or of Count Borghi, who quoted in support of his theory his\r\ncareful perusal of certain papers immensely in my favour, this is how the\r\nSignore Giovanni-Maria Valla, of Brisighella, spoke on the subject—\r\n\r\n“It is more than fifty years since I was enrolled in the Country Militia.\r\nShortly afterwards, when I had already risen to the rank of Corporal,\r\nI was put in charge of a stranger called by the title of Comte, whom\r\nthe constables had taken up in the neighbourhood of the Convent of St.\r\nBernard. I did not know the man, who was well-made and rather stout, with\r\na reddish-brown complexion.\r\n\r\n“It was said that the order for his arrest came from Ravenna; but I know\r\nnothing about the reason for it nor anything else about him, except that\r\na few days later we gave him up again to the Cardinal’s Swiss guards, who\r\ntook him away in his carriage. As for Lorenzo Chiappini, I knew him very\r\nwell, having seen him several times at Brisighella, where he used to come\r\nto play football, and I remember having heard it said that he had given\r\nup his post because he had got a great lot of money for exchanging his\r\nboy for the girl of a rich nobleman.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, this is what the Signore Giuseppe Guezzani, of the same town,\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“My business has always been that of a barber, and I always served the\r\nFathers of St. Bernard until they were suppressed. It is about fifty\r\nyears since I used occasionally to shave a stranger living with them, who\r\npassed for a great French nobleman. I was left in ignorance as to who he\r\nwas or why he was there. Afterwards I heard that he had been arrested,\r\nbut I was never told the reason. He was rather stout, of good height, and\r\nhad a brownish complexion with a red and pimply nose. I remember, too,\r\nthat he had very fine legs.”\r\n\r\nAnd this is the account of the Signore Giuseppe Tondini, another\r\ninhabitant of the town—\r\n\r\n“About fifty years ago a foreign nobleman was living for some days in the\r\nconvent of St. Bernard then existing in this town of Brisighella. I don’t\r\nknow to what nation he belonged, and I don’t remember him well enough to\r\ndescribe him; but I think he was about the average height and rather\r\nstout. It was reported afterwards that he had been arrested.”\r\n\r\nThen there is the story of the Signore Ludovichetti, a lawyer living at\r\nRavenna—\r\n\r\n“Some length of time before the changes in this province—I can’t tell the\r\nexact date, but it was certainly during the time I was practising in the\r\nCriminal Court of that Legation, which was from 1768 to 1793—being about\r\none o’clock one day in the said Court, I heard that a foreign nobleman of\r\nexalted rank had been arrested, and was being brought to our prison under\r\nan escort of soldiers. His Eminence, being told of his arrival, had him\r\nat once brought before him. Moved by curiosity, I left my office and went\r\ninto the Cardinal-Legate’s room, and there I saw that when this nobleman\r\nappeared, his Eminence went forward to meet him, embraced him, and led\r\nhim into his own apartments. A good half-hour later, having gone back to\r\nmy work, I heard the carriage; and looking out of the window, I saw the\r\nsaid nobleman get into it, and it crossed the square in the direction of\r\nthe Adrian Gate by which it had entered. I don’t know who he was or where\r\nhe came from, nor do I know where or why he was arrested. But he was\r\nsaid to be a great French personage.”\r\n\r\nHaving heard these eye-witnesses, let us listen to others whose\r\nreputations make them worthy of full belief.\r\n\r\nLet us listen to the Signore Domenico della Valle, Secretary to the\r\nparish of Brisighella—\r\n\r\n“Though very intimate with one of the Fathers of St. Bernard, I never\r\nheard him say a word about the exchange in question. But I can vouch\r\nfor the fact that before 1790 I had heard the fact much talked about by\r\nseveral persons, and especially by the late Maestro don Giovanni-Batista\r\nTondini, who seemed to know all about it. He told me that the thing\r\nhad taken place about fifty years ago in the little town of Modigliana\r\nbetween a great French nobleman living in the Pretorial Palace, who\r\nhad exchanged his daughter for the son of a certain Chiappini, then a\r\nconstable, and whom I knew very well later on when he used to come to\r\nBrisighella to play football as an amateur. About twenty-five years ago\r\nI again saw, in the piazza of the Grand Duke, the said Chiappini, who\r\ntalked for a long time with the late Cesare Bandini of Veriolo, who was\r\nwith me. When that gentleman came back to me, I said to him: ‘You have\r\nbeen talking to a man I know to have exchanged his boy for the daughter\r\nof a great French nobleman.’ And Bandini replied, ‘Yes, that’s the man,\r\nand we were talking privately about that business.’\r\n\r\n“I can say for certain that Chiappini was well dressed then, and I was\r\ntold he was in easy circumstances, and had no need to follow his original\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n“After the suppression of the monastery of St. Bernard, I was employed\r\nin helping to make an inventory of papers and effects belonging to\r\nit. As I could speak French, they made me read two letters written in\r\nthat language. They were addressed to the Father Abbot, signed L. C.\r\nJoinville, and bore the date of 1773; but I can’t remember what day or\r\nwhat month.\r\n\r\n“In the first, written from Modigliana, there were thanks to that Father\r\nfor having allowed him to take refuge in his convent; and in the second,\r\nwritten from Ravenna, he informed him that he had been set at liberty\r\nafter having been arrested and taken to that town, and thanked him for\r\nall the attention he had shown him. These letters were written in a\r\nrunning and uneven hand; if I could see another written by the same\r\nperson I should probably recognize it.\r\n\r\n“The brothers of St. Bernard had themselves told me that the Count was\r\ntaken up one morning when he had gone out for a walk with a book; and\r\nthey added that their Abbot, looking upon this arrest as a violation of\r\na sacred sanctuary, had been to Ravenna to lodge a complaint, and had\r\nobtained satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“There was nothing entered in the inventory but the title-deeds of the\r\ncapital and interest of the convent; the letters and other papers were\r\nleft as being of no use; no one looked after them, and I don’t know if\r\nthey are still in existence.”\r\n\r\nNow let us hear Don Gaspare Perelli, Canon at Ravenna—\r\n\r\n“I can perfectly well remember, about forty-three years ago, hearing\r\nsome one say to my father, who was Governor of Brisighella, that some\r\nyears earlier a prince in disguise, who was stopping in that part of the\r\ncountry, had exchanged his daughter for the son of a constable, and that\r\nthis had taken place in the neighbourhood of Brisighella, though I can’t\r\nremember the name of the place itself. My father often told this story at\r\ntable, and in the presence of my mother, Angela Forchini; and then they\r\nwould inveigh against the cruelty of so changing a girl of high rank for\r\na boy of low condition.”\r\n\r\nFinally, let us hear the Signore Marco Maresta, chief custom-house\r\nofficer in that same town of Ravenna—\r\n\r\n“It is a long time ago, and I couldn’t swear to the exact date, that\r\nseveral people told me that at Faenza, or, as they said later, at\r\nModigliana, there had taken place an exchange of the daughter of a\r\ngreat nobleman for a boy of low condition whose father had received a\r\nlarge sum, and that this exchange had been arranged beforehand when the\r\ntwo wives were about to be confined. I can’t remember the name of the\r\nnobleman nor that of the base man who accepted his offer, nor even that\r\nof the people who told me about it; but I did hear that the first was a\r\nFrenchman.”\r\n\r\nWith so many proofs at my command, I thought the time had come to push\r\non my case. To procure greater expedition, I thought of another innocent\r\nstratagem.\r\n\r\nFrom Ravenna, whither I had gone so that I could not be suspected of\r\ncomplicity with my judges, I wrote a letter to the Count Borghi, in which\r\nI pretended to have been informed that, my friends having discovered my\r\ntrue family in France, not one of my relations was left but a nun living\r\nat Bordeaux, who would welcome me with the greatest delight if I could\r\nsucceed in proving to her the truth of the exchange, etc.\r\n\r\nQuite beside himself, that gentleman hastened to announce this piece of\r\ngood news to the Bishop of Faenza, came to Ravenna to congratulate me,\r\nand added to what he had already told me that the Count and Countess\r\nBorghi, his informants, though held in the highest esteem, were both of a\r\nvery giddy and thoughtless disposition; that the last-named used to remit\r\nto the former doorkeeper an annual pension sent by the Comte Joinville\r\nfor my education, and that the Grand Duke Leopold had shown me great\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose,” he said, “that except for that, that Prince would have\r\nbeen so deeply interested in you? Do you suppose he would have taken so\r\nmuch trouble or done so much for such a miserable wretch as Chiappini,\r\netc.?”\r\n\r\nHaving promised me that he would mention all this in his deposition, he\r\nstarted for home, where he set everything going. His great eagerness made\r\nme alter my opinion of him; I could not believe that he still wished to\r\nconceal from me any helpful letters he might possess, and thenceforth my\r\nbelief was that he had originally handed them all over to my supposed\r\nbrother, with whom I knew he had had some communication.\r\n\r\nNot to be behindhand with his fervour, I made haste to engage as my\r\nlawyer the Signore Jérôme Bellenghi, in order to obtain from the\r\nEpiscopal Tribunal sitting at Faenza the proper rectification of my\r\nbaptismal certificate; and this tribunal, on its side, nominated the\r\nCount Carlo Bandini to fill the office of proxy as representative of the\r\nComte and Comtesse de Joinville, not present.\r\n\r\nMy so-called brother, Tomaso Chiappini, was assigned me as my\r\nrepresentative, but, though twice summoned, refused to appear.\r\n\r\nAfter the aforesaid witnesses had made their attestations, they were\r\ncross-examined, and their answers were in strict accordance with their\r\noriginal accounts.\r\n\r\nMy counsel having argued his case, his opponent argued his and raised\r\nevery difficulty possible.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal, having, after mature consideration, come to the conclusion\r\nthat the attestation of the deceased jailer, far from being improbable,\r\nhad been confirmed and verified by a large number of other evidence,\r\npresumptions and conjectures, gave, on the 29th of May, 1824, a verdict\r\nentirely in my favour; and when the proper time for appealing against\r\nit was over, no objection having been raised, the Registrar, under this\r\nwarrant, proceeded to carry out the definitive rectification of my birth\r\ncertificate, and declared me to be the _daughter of the husband and wife,\r\nM. le Comte Louis, and Madame la Comtesse N. de Joinville_. (French.)[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n    Fresh Investigations—Count Borghi’s Letters—The Baths of\r\n    Lucca—Intimacy of the Duke of Orleans and the Marchioness\r\n    of B.—Loan—The Chevalier Montara—Letter to the Duc de\r\n    Bourbon—Various Publications—The Lawyer Courtilly—Archives of\r\n    Genoa—Conduct of the Governor—Tomaso Chiappini’s Libel—Refusal\r\n    of the Printers—Vain Attempts—The Bishop of Faenza—Letter from\r\n    the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne important fact had been argued and settled, namely, that of my\r\nsubstitution; and thenceforth it would be incontestable that my parents\r\nwere the Comte and Comtesse de Joinville, and French. But who were this\r\ncouple, and where were they? The uncertainty about this was insupportable\r\nto me now, and I was inspired with fresh courage to renew the struggle.\r\n\r\nGreatly wishing, if possible, to discover the nurse who had suckled the\r\njailer’s son, I had notices put up in several towns that a large reward\r\nwould be given to any one who could give me news of her.\r\n\r\nI wrote about this matter to Count Borghi, and at the same time\r\nreproached him somewhat for having omitted, on examination, to add to his\r\nfirst declaration what he had come to Ravenna to tell me.\r\n\r\nThis was his answer—\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED LADY,\r\n\r\n    “It is enough for me that you are pleased with what I have\r\n    done, and if you keep your goodwill for me, my delight will be\r\n    complete.\r\n\r\n    “You must never doubt of our everlasting remembrance of you,\r\n    whom we love and esteem for your rare and excellent qualities.\r\n    I have heard how much vexed you were by the ignorance of the\r\n    copyists; I could not have believed they could be so stupid and\r\n    illiterate; but the Bishop will have all that remedied.\r\n\r\n    “All these unlooked-for difficulties must have worried you and\r\n    delay our progress still more; I am truly sorry for it, and\r\n    if I could have foreseen it, I would have offered to make the\r\n    copies myself.\r\n\r\n    “During my examination I answered every question put to me,\r\n    and I wanted to add what I told you at Ravenna; but I was\r\n    told that, as that could not strengthen my deposition, it was\r\n    useless to include it in the case. I did not fail to ask the\r\n    sisters Bandini if they had not still got some remains of the\r\n    correspondence between the Countess Camilla and the Comte de\r\n    Joinville, but they always answered that they had absolutely\r\n    nothing left of it.\r\n\r\n    “And that must be true; for if they possessed any of your\r\n    parents’ letters they would have thought of making something\r\n    out of them to relieve their poverty.\r\n\r\n    “Your nurse at Modigliana was the mother of a woman who is\r\n    still alive; as to that of the exchanged boy, no one has been\r\n    able to give me news of her; and prudence would have prevented\r\n    the author of so atrocious a crime from choosing her about\r\n    here, and also from leaving any trace of the direction in which\r\n    the Comtesse de Joinville, with her attendants, went.\r\n\r\n    “I will go to Modigliana shortly, where I will make it my duty\r\n    to make every possible inquiry, as you desire; but I greatly\r\n    fear they will be fruitless, like those of so many others whom\r\n    you employed before me, amongst whom was the Signore Ragazzini,\r\n    who took immense trouble.\r\n\r\n    “I think I have now answered all the questions in your letter,\r\n    which I received from your courier, from whom we heard, to\r\n    our great delight, that you and your beloved Edward, to whom\r\n    we send our best love, are in perfect health. Your friend[6]\r\n    swears an eternal affection for you; she joins with me in\r\n    wishing you the greatest success and a full recovery of your\r\n    sacred rights.\r\n\r\n    “Believe, honoured lady, that my protestations of respect and\r\n    attachment could not be more sincere; and I can flatter myself\r\n    that, from the moment I made your personal acquaintance, I\r\n    was, and shall always be, proud to be your humble and devoted\r\n    servant, as well as your very affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n                                        “NICHOLAS BORGHI-BIANCOLI.”\r\n\r\nAfter so much anxiety, worry and fatigue, I felt the greatest need of\r\nrest, and my dear Marchioness of B. having most luckily told me that she\r\nwas at the baths of Lucca, I hastened to throw myself into her loving\r\narms there.\r\n\r\nShe told me that, about six weeks after my going to Paris, she had\r\nwritten the _Duke of Orleans_ a second letter of introduction for me,\r\nand said that she had been much surprised that _that Prince_ had not\r\nacknowledged its receipt, and had not even taken the trouble to thank her\r\nfor the news she had given him of her daughter’s marriage to Lord S.\r\n\r\nFor it is as well to know that, during the time of their exile, the _Duke\r\nand his two brothers_[7] had received from Mr. C., the Marchioness’s\r\nfather, an annual pension of £200 and permi to dine with him as often as\r\nthey pleased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUKE OF ORLEANS]\r\n\r\nThe Marquess of B. had given them a similar invitation, and had offered\r\nthem the use of a country house a short distance from London.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Montpensier, filled with gratitude, was so greatly attached to\r\nhim that he had himself carried to him just before his death, saying that\r\nhe must go to give an eternal farewell to his best friend.\r\n\r\nThis Prince having died of consumption at the age of thirty-two, the\r\nunfortunate Comte de Beaujolais, already attacked by the same disease,\r\nwas taken by his _elder brother_ to a milder climate, and died at Malta\r\nduring his twenty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, the present Duke applied once more to Mr. C.\r\nand the Marquess of B. and obtained fresh favours and assistance, to\r\nsupply, as he said, the needs of his mother and _sister_.\r\n\r\nA short time after the Restoration, the Marchioness being in Paris, he\r\nwent to see her, thanked her for all her good offices, vowed eternal\r\ngratitude to her and pressed her to go to spend a few days at Neuilly.\r\nHer health prevented her from yielding to his gracious entreaties or\r\nthose of the Duchess, who also showed her great kindness; but from that\r\ntime there began a very friendly and almost fraternal correspondence\r\nbetween the Duke and my friend, which was interrupted only by the sending\r\nof the letter concerning me.\r\n\r\nI could easily explain to my friend the cause of this silence, by telling\r\nher of all that had happened since I had had the happiness of seeing her.\r\n\r\nThe enormous expenses I had incurred had exhausted my funds, and I asked\r\nher to be so good as to advance me something.\r\n\r\nAt first she refused, pleading that her intimacy with the Duke would not\r\nallow her to provide weapons against him; but my arguments, and still\r\nmore her own love for me, little by little convinced her, and she ended\r\nby lending me the sum I needed.\r\n\r\nWith scrupulous delicacy she informed my adversary of this, assuring him\r\nthat it was solely to give me the power of paying off my old debts and\r\nnot with the intention of helping me to make war on him.\r\n\r\nInstead of a direct answer to so expansive a confidence, a thousand\r\ntortuous ways were taken to convince my friend that my claims were\r\nnothing but a tissue of lies, and everything possible was done to deprive\r\nme of her affection.\r\n\r\nBut her never-failing answer was: “Let her ideas be true or false, my\r\nheart will always be with one whom I love like another self.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had somewhat recovered, I went to Genoa, so as to be more\r\nwithin reach of news from France, whither I had made up my mind to send\r\na certain Chevalier Montara whom a lady in Lucca had described as being\r\na very clever man. I gave him my instructions and £300 sterling, for the\r\njourney as well as for the investigations he would have to make, and\r\nordered him to submit the whole thing to his Majesty Louis XVIII.\r\n\r\nHis first letters were very encouraging, and they came pretty frequently;\r\nsoon they became rarer and rarer; he tried to arouse fears in me; he\r\npleaded serious illness, squandered my money, and, in fact, did nothing\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, I was reminded that the Duc de Bourbon-Condé, during his\r\nmisfortunes, had received much civility from Lord Newborough’s relations.\r\nDelighted at this reminiscence, I thought I might take the liberty of\r\nwriting a very respectful and touching letter to His Highness, begging\r\nhim to give me his advice.\r\n\r\nMy letter was delivered, opened, and having been looked at, was\r\nignominiously returned to the person who had undertaken to take it.\r\n\r\nThe secretary who gave it back to him censured my action, accused me of\r\naudacity, and treated my business as a chimerical delusion.\r\n\r\nAfter this disappointment I was advised to have recourse to Madame la\r\nDauphine.\r\n\r\nA literary man of high reputation undertook to draw up my petition after\r\nthe most proper fashion; but when he came to read it to me, I must\r\nconfess that it seemed to me far from likely to convince any one of the\r\ntruth, especially at a time so fertile in impostors.\r\n\r\nDespite the doubts which I thought might be caused by my ignorance of\r\na language that was still almost unknown to me, I decided to have it\r\npresented by a gentleman residing in Paris, who, at the end of three\r\nweeks wrote that he must not again be given such commissions; that he had\r\nbeen asked several questions he could not answer, and that he had found\r\nhimself, without any manner of doubt, under the special observance of the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nThis fresh worry was all the more trying since my stay in Genoa was\r\ndisturbed by a multitude of other anxieties.\r\n\r\nNot content with distributing copies of the judgment given at Faenza,\r\nI had an article inserted in a newspaper[8] containing a summary of my\r\ncase, in which I asked for fresh information concerning my father and\r\nmother, whom I designated only by the initial J.\r\n\r\nNo one could believe that they were simply nobles; everybody was\r\nwhispering august names; but as the Orleans family was allied with all\r\nthe reigning families of Italy, fear seized upon all hearts and closed\r\nall lips.\r\n\r\nOnly one man made his appearance: a former magistrate who had known old\r\nChiappini well.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, his evidence would have been much more useful to\r\nme before the verdict given in my favour, but at least it will serve to\r\nconfirm it. Let us listen to it.\r\n\r\n    “I, the undersigned, certify and declare what follows, on my\r\n    soul and conscience—\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1808, having sent in my resignation of the post\r\n    of substitute of the Attorney-General in the Criminal Court\r\n    of the department called that of the Apennines, I retired to\r\n    Florence, where I lived until the month of April 1813, the date\r\n    of my departure for Rome. At the beginning of my residence\r\n    in the first of these two towns, I made the acquaintance of\r\n    Lorenzo Chiappini, with whom I sometimes dined at the house\r\n    of the doctor, Pietro Salvi. In 1810, I met him, with other\r\n    Florentines, in the immense house of the old Chartreuse, where,\r\n    like me, he had hired rooms to spend the summer in. The more\r\n    we saw of each other the more intimate and familiar became our\r\n    intercourse, especially on his side.\r\n\r\n    “Very soon he told me the most minute details of a journey he\r\n    had made to London to see one of his daughters, married, he\r\n    said, to a rich English lord who had fallen in love with her on\r\n    hearing her sing in a theatre.\r\n\r\n    “He could not say enough about the splendour of his\r\n    son-in-law’s house, nor of the welcome he had received there;\r\n    told me some coarse stories about Great Britain; described the\r\n    manners of the inhabitants; constantly repeated that all his\r\n    happiness lay in that darling daughter, and assured me that\r\n    he would give the world to procure the pleasure of seeing her\r\n    again.\r\n\r\n    “The next year he was attacked by some slight malady, and one\r\n    day, as I went to see him pretty frequently, he confessed to me\r\n    that he had a great burden on his conscience. I tried in vain\r\n    to make him listen to some words of comfort; nothing could cure\r\n    his melancholy.\r\n\r\n    “Another time, the talk having turned on the same subject, I\r\n    said that if he had not been guilty of theft—a sin God does\r\n    not pardon without restitution—all else could be expiated by\r\n    repentance. At that he made a clean breast of everything, and\r\n    confided to me that, having been in his youth keeper of the\r\n    prisons at Modigliana, he exchanged his firstborn son for the\r\n    daughter of a foreign nobleman, and that it was that daughter\r\n    who was married in London, and that he should feel never-ending\r\n    regret for so having helped to deprive her of her birthright.\r\n\r\n    “Having strongly advised him to reveal such a secret to his\r\n    generous benefactress, who must most certainly rejoice over it\r\n    because of the honour and profit it would bring her, he said\r\n    that he had already thought of doing so, and only wanted to\r\n    avoid any sort of fuss during his life; but he should manage\r\n    so that everything should be discovered after his death. He\r\n    added that this seemed sufficient reparation due to the lady,\r\n    considering her present condition of grandeur and opulence.\r\n\r\n    “He talked after the same fashion to me on several other\r\n    occasions, and I always found him fixed in that resolve.\r\n\r\n    “This is what I heard from Chiappini’s own lips, and I am\r\n    prepared to confirm it, if necessary, legally and by oath.\r\n\r\n                      “In testimony whereof,\r\n\r\n                                                  “LOUIS COURTILLY,\r\n\r\n                                                          “Lawyer.”\r\n\r\nThis very clear and precise deposition was far from compensating me for\r\nall the disagreeables brought upon me by my harmless advertisements.\r\n\r\nResearches made in the Public Archives of the town I was living in\r\nbrought to light almost nothing about the year 1773; the Keeper of the\r\nRecords declared that the books relating to that period had been put\r\ntogether in a place I must not enter without special permission, and\r\nwhere, he told me, memorandums of great importance were kept.\r\n\r\nBut it was impossible to get anything out of the Governor, who was my\r\nsworn enemy.\r\n\r\nThe day after the appearance of my article he had severely reprimanded\r\nthe journalist I had employed.\r\n\r\nHe often gave balls, concerts and entertainments of all kinds, to which\r\nall the English ladies, from those of high rank down to the wives of\r\nthe smallest tradespeople, were invited; I alone was deprived of this\r\n_immense honour_.\r\n\r\nOne day he went so far as to express to my banker the greatest desire\r\nfor my speedy departure. “I am ordered,” he said, “to keep the strictest\r\nwatch over her.”\r\n\r\nMy banker replying that he could not understand the reason of it, since\r\nall I was doing was in order to discover a Comte and Comtesse Joinville—\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said this officious governor; “but it isn’t very easy to prove\r\nthat this Count and Countess are no other than the former Duke and\r\nDuchess of Chartres?”\r\n\r\nBut that was not all.\r\n\r\nFifteen days after the appearance of my article in the _Gazetta di\r\nGenova_, my ex-brother, the advocate Chiappini, sent me by post a\r\nso-called answer he had had put into the public papers, boasting of\r\nhaving obtained the permission of the Government. Adorned with all the\r\nflowers of speech an infamous pen could indite, such a libel was well\r\nworthy of its author.\r\n\r\nAlthough my reputation stood immeasurably high above his insults, at\r\nfirst I wanted to answer them.\r\n\r\nThe first printer I spoke to refused his services, under the pretext\r\nthat he had received orders in the matter; I had successive recourse to\r\nseveral others, who all likewise put me off. Not only at Genoa, but at\r\nFlorence, Bologna and Alessandria—everywhere they had been threatened\r\nwith severe penalties in case of disobedience.\r\n\r\nTomaso Chiappini had not confined himself to spreading atrocious\r\ncalumnies against me; I heard that he was accusing my witnesses of\r\nimposture, and that several of them, alarmed by the sinister rumours he\r\ncirculated, and believing themselves irretrievably ruined, were cursing\r\nme and declaring that I had involved them in the greatest trouble.\r\n\r\nAmongst these was the Count Borghi, who henceforth became once more my\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe whole country was topsy-turvy; but all these intrigues, all these\r\ndiabolical plots fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nI wrote to the Bishop of Faenza, who could not get over his astonishment,\r\nbut exhorted me to suspend judgment on the persons whose perfidious\r\ninconstancy I was denouncing, and assured me that the truth was too well\r\nestablished for anything henceforth to shake it.\r\n\r\nHis letter, which I carefully treasure, is dated July 20, 1826.\r\n\r\nIf that of this venerable prelate, illustrious by his learning and\r\nformerly Patriarch of Venice, was flattering and an honour, another,\r\nwhich I received from the Cape of Good Hope, was as vile and filthy.\r\n\r\nIt can easily be guessed it was the work of that other Chiappini to whom\r\nLord Newborough had shown so much kindness.\r\n\r\nThe most malignant rage was manifest through the whole of it, beneath\r\nthe hideous hues of expressions as indescribably ignoble as they were\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nTo do full justice to it, it would doubtless be enough to let it be seen\r\nas it is; but I should fear to disgust my readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n    I go to Nice—Rudeness of the Governor—Letter from\r\n    Alquier-Caze—My Precautions—Demands, and Remittances—Second\r\n    Journey to Paris—Conversation—A Gouty Colonel—Expenses—Return\r\n    to Nice—Letters from my Husband—His Arrival—That of the\r\n    Marchioness of B.—A Transient Happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing so ill-treated at Genoa, and also wishing to be still nearer to\r\nFrance, in the month of September 1825, with my son, his tutor and my\r\nservants, I left and went to live in a country house I had rented near\r\nthe gates of Nice, where I was unlucky enough to come across a governor\r\nstill stiffer and ruder than that of the town I had just left.\r\n\r\nBut what could so many unjust proceedings do but confirm me still more in\r\nthe justice of my high claims! For it was easy enough for me to see that\r\nthey were dictated by a powerful hand, and I could not believe that that\r\nkind of enemy would fight mere phantoms.\r\n\r\nA little before this I had received a letter from Paris, written by a\r\ncertain Alquier-Caze, who introduced himself and offered me his services.\r\n\r\n“I have been well posted up in the case,” he wrote; “I know its delicacy,\r\nI see its difficulties; but I don’t feel any qualms about undertaking it;\r\nand I even count on a speedy success if you will deign to honour me with\r\nyour complete confidence.”\r\n\r\nAfraid of falling again into the hands of a rogue, I sent him a very\r\nguarded and cautious letter; but he was not at all put out by it, and\r\nreplied in these terms—\r\n\r\n“Madame la Baronne, the position you are in is such as to cause you\r\ngreat anxiety. The importance of the matter that fills your mind; the\r\nuncertainty of its issue; the base machinations that perfidy has employed\r\nagainst you; the kind of fatality that seems to pursue you, all combine\r\nto give birth to endless doubts and apprehensions. But, believe me,\r\nMadame, I feel the strongest conviction that, by my hands, Heaven will\r\ngive you the final victory over your enemies. Yes, that victory will be\r\nmy work. Up to now you have been deceived; up to now I have met with\r\nnothing but ingratitude for my services; Fate keeps in reserve for each\r\nof us an equally pleasant event; for you, that of seeing your confidence\r\njustified by my vigorous efforts; for me, that of meeting at last with\r\na noble expression of gratitude. No, the soul of a Catalan is not an\r\nordinary soul, as the future will prove to you better than anything I\r\ncould say,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe confident warmth of this shook me. I had some inquiries made about\r\nhim, and as I was told he was a young lawyer of good repute, bold and\r\nclever, I decided to confide my documents to him.\r\n\r\nHe wrote soon, declaring that he had already made some valuable\r\ndiscoveries, intimating at the same time that the lure of gain was\r\nabsolutely necessary for obtaining good evidence.\r\n\r\nI at once set about sending off a considerable sum to him, which was but\r\nthe prelude to the many other such disbursements the necessity of which\r\nhe was continually urging.\r\n\r\nThis had gone on for several months, when, some weeks after my arrival\r\nat Nice, I received a fresh letter from Caze, telling me that he was\r\nbeginning the attack at the reopening of the Courts; that he greatly\r\nwished to confer with me beforehand, and urging me so strongly to come\r\nto Paris before the 1st of November, that I set out at once, taking with\r\nme my dear son and his tutor.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the haste we made, we could not manage to arrive before\r\nthe 2nd of November. I took a suite of rooms in a large hotel in the\r\nPlace Vendôme, and not till two days later did I receive the first visit\r\nof my _assiduous_ lawyer.\r\n\r\nCompliments exchanged, this represents the substance of what passed\r\nbetween us—\r\n\r\n“Have you got your husband’s authority, madame?” “No, monsieur.” “But\r\nthat is a document without which we can do nothing.” “You ought to have\r\nwarned me of that six months ago.” “I most sincerely beg your pardon\r\nfor not having thought of it.” “It is very annoying to have taken so\r\nlong and expensive a journey uselessly.” “Far from being useless, it was\r\nindispensable.” “I don’t see why.” “Wasn’t it necessary for us to arrange\r\ntogether what it would be best to attempt so as to ensure complete\r\nsuccess?”\r\n\r\n“That could have been done by writing, or after I had been furnished\r\nwith the power-of-attorney.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I was longing to tell you in person what I could not confide to\r\npaper.”\r\n\r\n“What are these very important communications, then?” “I have succeeded\r\nin discovering that the very year of the exchange the Duc de Chartres,\r\nyour father, was staying at Berne, under the name of the Comte de\r\nJoinville, in an inn the then landlady of which is still alive; and where\r\nhe scandalized everybody by his profligate conduct. I believe I can get\r\na certification of this from the local authorities. Another of my agents\r\nhas informed me that the Marquise de Boucherolles, an old friend of your\r\nmother’s, testifies that that Princess was on bad terms with her supposed\r\nson, and often made mysterious remarks that are in perfect agreement with\r\nthe facts of the case.\r\n\r\n“The same agent spoke to me of a certain M. d’Echouards, who knows of\r\nthe testimony of the late Madame Cambise to the effect that, on her\r\ndeath-bed, the Dowager suffered greatly from a troubled conscience. He\r\ntold me, too, that the late mother-in-law of the Comte de Saillan was\r\none of the travelling-party in 1773. Moreover, on this point I have\r\nthree witnesses _de visu_, and am just about to procure three more still\r\nliving.” “Will you be so very kind as to introduce them to me?” “Most\r\nwillingly; but I shall still need a little more money to give them enough\r\ncourage. That’s by far the best card to play, especially in Paris.”\r\n\r\nBewitched by his talk and his protestations, I opened my purse, and my\r\npoor pennies disappeared into that of my artful juggler, who, the next\r\nday, appeared once more, bringing with him a gouty old Colonel, who,\r\nalmost before he got into the room, addressed me in the following words—\r\n\r\n“As I am well acquainted with the family of the Baron de Sternberg, I\r\nwant to help you as much as I possibly can. The judgments of men being\r\nalways doubtful, you may perhaps fail in obtaining the justice you seem\r\nto expect from legal tribunals; but it would be quite easy for you,\r\nthrough my intervention, to arrive at a satisfactory settlement.”\r\n\r\nAstonished at such a speech, I promptly exclaimed: “No, no; I would never\r\nconsent to submit to such a disgrace.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel replied—\r\n\r\n“Still, madame, the plan I want to propose to you would undoubtedly be\r\nthe wisest and the most advantageous for you. Will you live long enough\r\nto see the end of such a case? And how do you know that your children\r\nwould have any desire to go on with it?”\r\n\r\nTo this my answer was still more concise, being couched in three words:\r\n“All or nothing!”\r\n\r\nI left the room as soon as they were uttered, and declined to see my\r\ngouty old friend again, believing him to be a spy sent from my adversary.\r\n\r\nVainly I waited for the appearance of M. Alquier’s promised witnesses;\r\nthere were always fresh excuses on his part, and renewed requests for\r\nmoney, which I was simple enough to grant. In less than a fortnight I had\r\nspent more than three thousand crowns.\r\n\r\nWeary of such expenses and delays, I longed to return to Nice, where\r\nI arrived towards the end of the autumn. I had written to my husband,\r\nwho, during the winter, sent me his very disappointing opinion. Instead\r\nof authorizing me to go to law, he advised attempting to come to some\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nI seized my pen at once to tell him shortly that, desiring to die as I\r\nhad lived, I could not compromise my honour.\r\n\r\nSome months after, I received a second letter, in which he told me that,\r\non the advice of our friend, Admiral Krusenstern,[9] he was coming to me,\r\nso as to endeavour to end the business in the best way possible.\r\n\r\nHe arrived towards the end of October, having stopped some time in Paris\r\nto make fresh investigations. While allowing that I had excellent grounds\r\nand very favourable chances, his constant refrain was: “We must try for\r\nan arrangement”; while mine was a vexed and endless repetition of: “All\r\nor nothing.”\r\n\r\nHis arrival was shortly followed by that of the Marchioness of B., who\r\ncame from Lausanne.\r\n\r\nShe told me that _the Duke of Orleans_, while visiting that town, had not\r\ncondescended even to ask news of her; adding that she quite understood\r\nthat I was the innocent cause of this base ingratitude.\r\n\r\nThe house she took at Nice being next door to mine, we saw each other\r\nconstantly; in fact, we were always together, and I can assert that that\r\nwinter was the happiest time in my wretched existence; though even then\r\nI could not fully enjoy its consolations, because of my firm conviction\r\nthat they would speedily change to bitter sufferings.\r\n\r\nMy presentiments were but too well verified; my friend, for her part,\r\nwas obliged to go back to London, while the Baron, on his, announced his\r\npositive intention to send Edward to a public school!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n    My Stay at Geneva—Correspondence of Alquier-Caze—M.\r\n    Sparifico—Payment of the Lawyers—An Unlucky Meeting—Weakening\r\n    of my Health—My Husband’s Exhortations—His Arrival with\r\n    Driver-Cooper—Fatal Agreement—My Son’s Tutor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the year 1827, soon after the departure of my friend,\r\nwe transported our household goods to Geneva, where was the school my\r\nhusband had chosen for our young son; and his first care on our arrival\r\nwas the carrying out of his barbarous plan.\r\n\r\nUnable to make up my mind quite to lose sight of the dear child who,\r\nsince his birth, had never left me, I hired a house close to his. I was\r\nable to go to see him every day, to lavish love upon him, and he himself\r\ncame to see me twice a week and spent the whole of Sunday with me.\r\n\r\nI used to invite several of his school-fellows for the evening, providing\r\nall sorts of refreshments for them, and letting them amuse themselves\r\njust as they pleased; and their childish games were a real relaxation to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMoreover, my dear Marchioness of B. had kindly given me several agreeable\r\nintroductions, so that in my new home I found something of the pleasure I\r\nhad enjoyed at Nice.\r\n\r\nBut this new tranquillity could not last.\r\n\r\nFor some time past I had noticed that d’Alquier-Caze’s communications\r\nwere neither so frequent nor so hopeful as they had been. Having\r\nmentioned this to him, he answered me by a lengthy enumeration of his\r\nsupposed services. Another time he wrote that he was going to Nancy\r\nto question an old person he had been told of from whose evidence he\r\nexpected the happiest results.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he gave me an account of a conversation he professed\r\nto have had with a Minister of his most Christian Majesty.\r\n\r\n“The first attempt was to frighten me,” he said; “but my determined\r\naspect speedily destroyed all hope of succeeding in that. Then\r\ndiscouragement was tried; I made a suitable reply. Every possible way\r\nof trying to make me speak was used; but I steadily kept myself within\r\nthe limits of a wise discretion. ‘_What do you want?_’ I was asked. My\r\nanswer was yours: _‘All or nothing.’ ‘You’ll ruin yourself.’ ‘I shall\r\ndo my duty.’ ‘You had better give up such a chimerical business.’ ‘I\r\npossess the confidence of milady, and I cannot betray it.’ ‘You will\r\nnever succeed.’ ‘We shall.’ ‘Every one regards your claims with supreme\r\ncontempt.’ ‘That’s impossible!’ ‘They can’t conceive on what you found\r\nthem.’ ‘Do you allow that the exchange took place?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Then all that\r\nI have to do now is to prove the identity of its perpetrator with the too\r\nnotorious Orleans.’ ‘Prove even its likelihood, if you can.’ ‘I shall\r\nprove its reality.’ ‘How?’ ‘We shall have writings and witnesses.’ ‘Well,\r\nwe shall always be pleased to see you.’ ‘I shall come again.’_ etc.”\r\n\r\nFar from satisfied with all this talk, I constantly complained that,\r\nsince the verdict given at Faenza, I had spent a great deal of money and\r\nwas still about where I was then. To combat my reproaches he conceived\r\nthe idea of writing me the extraordinary letter here given—\r\n\r\n    “You are angry with me, dear milady, are you not? You are both\r\n    right and wrong. You are right, because in your situation\r\n    nothing could be more natural than impatience; and wrong,\r\n    because I am to be excused on account of all the trouble I am\r\n    taking.\r\n\r\n    “There is a question I am about to submit to you, and to which\r\n    you must give a definite answer.\r\n\r\n    “Certain proposals, in the form of advice, have been made to me\r\n    in your interest. Would you be disposed—yes or no—to come to an\r\n    arrangement if its terms were considerable pecuniary advantages\r\n    to yourself? Please let me know at once. I won’t say more\r\n    to-day, but that everything is going on well. Believe me, etc.”\r\n\r\nWhat more was wanted to open my eyes and let me clearly see the crafty\r\nduplicity of my ill-advised rascal, who up to now had so piqued himself\r\non the nobility of his sentiments?\r\n\r\nKnowing in Paris a certain M. Sparifico, I begged him to tell me of some\r\nlawyer famous for his ability and still more for his integrity.\r\n\r\nFirst he mentioned several, who, he said, dared not undertake my defence;\r\nand then he named others whom I knew to be devoted to my mortal enemy.\r\n\r\nI was so disgusted with all these obstacles that I almost made up my mind\r\nto give up everything.\r\n\r\nThe Baron being obliged to go to the capital of France on his own\r\naffairs, I requested him to recover all the papers in Alquier-Caze’s\r\npossession, which he endeavoured to do; but could not manage till he had\r\npaid 200 francs to Maître Hennequin for a memorandum I had never seen;\r\n550 francs to Maître Plé for work of which I had never heard, and 1000\r\nfrancs to Caze himself for having cheated me out of many times as much.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a certain Henry Driver-Cooper, who, after ruining his\r\ncreditors in England, had taken refuge on the Continent so as to increase\r\nhis iniquitous fortune, had just exchanged his modest designation of\r\nhop-merchant for the pompous title of jurisconsult, which he thought\r\nhe had the right to share with Maître Dupin, considering that he had\r\nentrusted to him the celebrated Stacpoole case;[10] wherefore he\r\nconsidered that he also ought to share in the glory of its success;\r\nsince, without him, Maître Dupin would not have intervened. He had his\r\n_Doctor’s Diploma_ printed on his visiting-cards, and went from house to\r\nhouse boasting of his triumph.\r\n\r\nBut he took good care not to add that Maître Dupin himself, thinking but\r\nlittle of his services, had reduced the fee he claimed by a thirty-second!\r\n\r\nAfter this blow the disconsolate hop-merchant, or, if you like, the\r\nsaddened jurisconsult, was on the look-out for a favourable opportunity.\r\nHe owned in the neighbourhood of Paris a so-called _château_, which he\r\nhad bought in better days, and he was trying to find an obliging tenant\r\nwho would pay him a big rent for it while still leaving him in possession\r\nand even keeping him during the whole duration of the lease.\r\n\r\nI was to be this compassionate person; he had foreseen it from the\r\nmoment that he had first chanced to meet my husband, whom by dexterous\r\nsuggestions he drew into his net, and negotiations were entered into.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the damp climate of Geneva having given me a very bad cold,\r\nwhich, as usual, had at once settled on my chest, my friends advised me\r\nto take a house in the country where I could breathe more healthy air. I\r\nhad chosen one, called Coligny, looking over the lake and magnificently\r\nsituated, when the Baron, writing to me about his _lucky discovery_,\r\nasked my opinion of it.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his youth, my dear son begged me not to forget how many\r\ntimes I had allowed myself to be caught in the snares of impostors. In\r\nconsequence I answered evasively, and principally to tell my husband of\r\nmy resolve to change my house.\r\n\r\nI soon received a second letter in which he implored me not to carry out\r\nmy intention, explained still more fully the conditions laid down by my\r\n_deliverer_, and told me that one of them was that I must live in his\r\nhouse during the whole course of the trial.\r\n\r\nThis time my answer was decided.\r\n\r\n“I will consent,” I said, “to combine with your agent in pecuniary\r\nmatters if he will pay half the costs and undertake to push on the\r\nbusiness briskly. As to the plan for my living in his house, you may\r\ngive that up at once; for I intend to take the one I have in view here\r\nfrom to-morrow, and nothing will induce me to leave my dear Edward.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, I signed the agreement and moved to Coligny.\r\n\r\nI was hardly settled there when I had a third letter from the Baron,\r\nexpressing very great displeasure and even reproving me in a way. He\r\nspoke enthusiastically of Cooper, extolling his courtesy, enlarging on\r\nhis ability, and endeavouring above all to convince me that if I did not\r\ntake advantage of his generous offer I might give up all my hopes; that I\r\nshould not find any French _avocat_ willing to fight against the powerful\r\nColossus, reputed the first Prince of the Royal Blood, and that the great\r\nbenefit to my son claimed the sacrifice, however painful to my heart, of\r\na separation destined to procure for him the most brilliant of futures.\r\n\r\nThat last argument moved and shook me; it was so cleverly put that I\r\nconsented to see our charlatan. But the clever swindler, not wishing\r\nto make it seem that he had come on his own initiative to see me in\r\nSwitzerland, got a model of the flattering invitation I was to give him\r\nsent to me.\r\n\r\nMy exact copy having reached him, he and my husband arrived.\r\n\r\nHe left no stone unturned to dazzle our eyes with his cunning promises,\r\nand, as soon as he believed us both well prepared, he persuaded us to go\r\nto the house of Voltaire at Ferney.\r\n\r\n“It shall be on the very table at which the great man wrote his immortal\r\nworks that our agreement shall be signed; his shade shall preside there,\r\nand his presence be the pledge of the most glorious success.”\r\n\r\nIt was pure farce, I own, but what is easier than to inflame minds\r\nalready under the spell? Could we haggle when the grandeurs and riches we\r\nhad a right to claim were, so to speak, at our discretion?\r\n\r\nCooper was able to take advantage of our weakness in the most infamous\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nSitting unmoved in this castle-in-the-air of his own building, caring for\r\nnothing but other people’s money, he made us affix our signatures to two\r\ndeeds, the outcome of his crafty cupidity.\r\n\r\nBy the first he appointed himself my steward; as such he was, during\r\nthe whole course of the trial, to lodge and keep me; to furnish me with\r\nhorses, carriages, and servants, in return for an annual payment of\r\n25,000 francs, payable in advance.\r\n\r\nHaving made his calculations correctly, by the second, which he had\r\ntaken care to bring ready drawn-up and in French so uncouth that it was\r\ndifficult to understand it, he created himself the absolute dispenser of\r\nlarger sums.\r\n\r\nHe was to proceed with the business which was my principal object _if\r\nhe thought fit, and in the way he thought best_. The costs were to be\r\ndivided, and, in the case of success, the profits also.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you have not by you the sum you ought to pay me. Well, give me\r\nbills.”\r\n\r\nAnd so I did to the amount of £1,150 sterling.\r\n\r\nAfter this delightful expedition, he was ready to return to Paris,\r\nbegging me to follow quickly.\r\n\r\nAlthough at school my son had all the necessary masters, I had up to\r\nnow kept on his tutor, called Ragazzini, a native of Tredozzio, who had\r\nbeen recommended to me at Florence as a clever man, and had taken some\r\ntrouble in the Faenza business.\r\n\r\nI wished to discharge him at this time in consequence of many defects he\r\ncould no longer keep hidden; but Cooper and the Baron were against it,\r\nsaying that the man, knowing Italy perfectly, might be of the greatest\r\nuse to us; so, though very reluctantly, I gave way to their urgent\r\nrepresentations; and it was arranged that he was to accompany me and my\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n    Painful Separation—Arrival at Bellevue—Powers given to\r\n    Cooper—His Swindling—The Ills he made me suffer—Fresh Attempts\r\n    of Alquier-Caze—Distraint on my Effects—My Move to the Hôtel\r\n    Britannique—Letters from my Husband and my Son—My Grief and my\r\n    Resolves.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after Cooper’s departure I began to prepare. The owner of\r\nColigny was inexorable; I had to pay him the whole year’s rent.\r\n\r\nBut this loss was very small compared with another much greater one. It\r\nwould be vain to try to describe how my maternal heart was torn, when I\r\nthought I was forsaking my dear son. How difficult it was, what restraint\r\nI had to use, what efforts to make, not to break down when the dear boy\r\nasked me with sorrowful and almost prophetic voice: “Maman, Maman, what\r\nare you going to do?”\r\n\r\nAnd all I could say in answer was: “My darling, I am going to work for\r\nthe good of you and your dear brothers.”\r\n\r\nBefore the fatal day he spent two with me, and his loving caresses were\r\nsweet but incurable wounds to my soul.\r\n\r\nNo—I will not attempt to describe that cruel parting; I will not speak\r\nof it. I will only say that, absorbed in my own thoughts, despite the\r\nnumerous requests to do so, I could not bear once to look at the sublime\r\nand delightful beauties of nature, which had always had so great a charm\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nAfter a journey of four days we passed through Paris, and arrived at\r\nBellevue near Meudon.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief reasons that had induced me to go to the scene of\r\naction was the inclination my husband and his confidant had shown to try\r\nthe plan of compromise with my adversary; and I was quite resolved to\r\nmake an eternal protest against that kind of baseness. But once on the\r\nspot, I thought there was nothing to fear. Deeds, papers, documents, got\r\ntogether with difficulty by my constant care—all were handed over without\r\nmisgiving, and the full powers demanded by Cooper at once given him.\r\n\r\nBut that was not enough; he must seize my whole fortune. My income was\r\nnow reduced to £1,700 sterling a year; he had already taken £1000 for\r\nthe rent of the house; but he could not be satisfied till he got hold of\r\nthe £700 I still had to dispose of.\r\n\r\nTo this end, he got together some infamous assistants, with whom he\r\nworked upon the Baron’s mind with shameless cunning, and they came all\r\ntogether to propose my giving the rogue fresh powers to raise my funds in\r\nEngland, under pretext of the enormous expenses my case would entail.\r\n\r\nNo more powerful motive could have been offered me; after a few short\r\nexplanations, I signed a paper, which I had not even been asked to read.\r\n\r\nSo now Cooper was absolute master of my property; there was nothing more\r\nfor him to ask for: he had got it all.\r\n\r\nAnd now the important trial for which I had already made such great\r\nsacrifices would surely make mighty strides towards the desired event?\r\n\r\nBy no means; Cooper isn’t even giving it a thought; anyhow there is\r\nnothing to prove that he is. But he is always talking to me in a hopeful\r\nstrain, so important is it to him to keep his post as director of a\r\nsham piece of work which, without care or trouble, ought to bring him in\r\n45,000 francs a year!\r\n\r\nBut the agreement as to rent and stewardship was very ill carried\r\nout; for several weeks carriage, horses, servants could not be found;\r\nour rooms lacked the most necessary pieces of furniture, and my table\r\ndisplayed such parsimony that I should infallibly have died of hunger if\r\nI had not taken care to get in from outside something to live upon.\r\n\r\nI might have borne with this economical diet patiently if I could have\r\ngot any satisfaction about the great business; but nothing was got\r\nready, nothing begun. At last I saw that I was the victim of the basest\r\nimposture; and when I reflected on all the deeds my weakness had allowed\r\nto be extorted from me, I realized all the horror of my position.\r\n\r\nForthwith I burst into bitter complaints. Cooper, in a rage, threw away\r\nhis mask, and might have said—\r\n\r\n    _“C’est à vous de sortir, vous qui parlez en maître;_\r\n    _La maison m’appartient.…”_\r\n\r\nAnd truly, my own agreement in his hand, he ruled like a despot over the\r\nhouse he had let to me for 25,000 francs; and to make me feel the full\r\nweight of his authority, he redoubled his economies, kept under lock and\r\nkey even the garden seeds which I was no longer allowed to gather for my\r\nbirds; spoke haughtily to me; poured out abuse on me, and, in a sort of\r\nway, kept me under close surveillance.\r\n\r\nHe had then his mother and sister with him, two veritable furies who\r\njoined in all his excesses; and as on every occasion they gave way to\r\ntheir fiery passions, several conflicts took place.\r\n\r\nNo—I can never understand how my husband could restrain himself under\r\nsuch circumstances!\r\n\r\nWhile I was being thus tormented by my new swindler, Alquier-Caze did not\r\nlose sight of me, and still speculating brilliantly on my easy credulity,\r\nhe endeavoured to approach me once more through this very specious\r\npreamble.\r\n\r\n    “Milady, no doubt you will be astonished at receiving a letter\r\n    from me; this is what has induced me to write to you.\r\n\r\n    “This morning a person I do not know, and who would not tell\r\n    me his name, came to see me. He told me where you are living,\r\n    and talked a great deal about your case. I cannot and will\r\n    not trust to paper the communications he made me. They are of\r\n    importance to you and your position.\r\n\r\n    “Although I cannot feel much flattered that, being in this\r\n    country, you have not come to see one who took so much trouble\r\n    for you, I can never cease to participate in your troubles, and\r\n    I believe it will be in your interest to tell you what I have\r\n    learnt.\r\n\r\n    “I am free only on Sunday. If you think it well for me to come\r\n    and see you, answer at once, and the day after to-morrow I will\r\n    be with you.\r\n\r\n    “Please be prudent and tell no one of my letter, etc.”\r\n\r\nCuriosity to see him rather than any hope of hearing anything useful\r\ndecided me to allow him to come. He came, and his constrained manner and\r\nambiguous language soon betraying to me his deceitful plot, I treated him\r\nwith icy coldness, and made him clearly see that for the future I would\r\nhave nothing more to do with him. I heard afterwards that his numerous\r\nmisdeeds had forced him to leave France.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I had written to England with orders that the last power\r\nof attorney I had so rashly given to the cheat Cooper should not be\r\nhonoured.\r\n\r\nOn the first hint of this being learned by my odious agent, he flew into\r\na frightful rage; loaded me with insults, threatened me with his wrath,\r\nand put in a distraint on all my effects, to which I responded by a\r\nrevocation of all the powers I had given him.\r\n\r\nWe could no longer live with such a scoundrel; so we left Meudon on\r\nSeptember 1, 1828, and established ourselves in the Hôtel Britannique.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that on the day we left we had to submit to the\r\ngrossest of insults in the shape of a ridiculous and minute examination\r\nto make sure, as they said, _that we had committed no theft_.\r\n\r\nAs I pretty often reproached the Baron for having caused me so many\r\ndiscomforts, I thought I saw that my words had a great effect on him,\r\nand his mind seemed much upset. On the fourth day after our change of\r\nresidence, I saw him go out with a paper in his hand, and asking him\r\nwhen he would be back, he said: “In an hour’s time.”\r\n\r\nWhile waiting, I went for a walk with my son’s former tutor, and on\r\ngetting back, my first question to the portress was whether my husband\r\nhad come in.\r\n\r\nAs she answered in the negative, I ordered dinner to be put off; but\r\nthe Baron did not return. I began to feel great anxiety, fearing that\r\nsomething had happened to him; but at eight o’clock in the evening I\r\nreceived a packet containing a power of attorney for Ragazzini and a\r\nletter for me in these words—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR WIFE,\r\n\r\n    “I am distressed at having to leave you just now; but business\r\n    I can’t put off longer calls me to Russia. I beg your pardon\r\n    for not having told you sooner; but I acted in this way so\r\n    as to avoid the harrowing scenes that would have followed.\r\n    My agitation is so great that I can say nothing to you but\r\n    that my conscience does not accuse me of all the wrongs you\r\n    impute to me. I have told M. Ragazzini to act for you against\r\n    Driver-Cooper. Some day, I hope, we shall meet again under a\r\n    more lucky star than the present one. I participate in all your\r\n    troubles, but I cannot help you. Adieu; _tout à vous_.\r\n\r\n                                                 “B. DE STERNBERG.”\r\n\r\nIt will well be believed that I cannot describe the grief I felt at\r\nfinding myself forsaken by him who had so disastrously involved me in so\r\ngrievous a strife. But his pitiless hand was to strike me a still harder\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the week I received the following letter—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAREST MAMAN,\r\n\r\n    “My father has just arrived in Geneva, and intends to start for\r\n    Russia to-morrow with me. I already hear your reproaches; but\r\n    what can I do?\r\n\r\n    “Forgive your loving son, and don’t think him ungrateful; for I\r\n    am ready to put my head in the fire if that would be any good\r\n    to you.\r\n\r\n    “But what would become of me if I did not obey my father’s\r\n    orders? Don’t be afraid; you will always have the whole of my\r\n    filial love.\r\n\r\n    “How cruel it is to tear me in this fashion from my darling\r\n    mother! But what can be done? If you had stayed at Coligny, and\r\n    if you had listened to my advice, this would not have happened.\r\n\r\n    “I am hurried. Be comforted; you shall soon have news of me,\r\n    and believe me always the most loving of your sons.\r\n\r\n                                                “EDWARD STERNBERG.”\r\n\r\nWhat I felt on reading this was not grief; it was despair. For several\r\ndays I gave myself up completely to the most acute anguish; at times I\r\nwanted to start for Russia; at others I resolved to let myself die.\r\n\r\nBut at last real maternal love triumphed over affliction, and I realized\r\nthat it was necessary for the good of my children both to go on living\r\nand to remain in France.\r\n\r\nTaking fresh courage, I formed the unshakable resolution to suffer and\r\nface everything, that I might gain a victory to the advantage and honour\r\nof those who were so dear to me in this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n    Cooper’s Rage—Recourse to the Law—First Result of\r\n    Arbitration—M. Huré—My Letters to Mme. de Genlis—Visit of\r\n    Saint-Aubin—His Journey—Emissary from Mme. de Genlis—Letters\r\n    from Saint-Aubin—His Return—Realized Fears—Mr. Mills’s\r\n    Tricks—My Correspondence with the English Ambassador.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was lamenting over the unexpected departure of my husband and\r\nson, Driver-Cooper, for his part, was loudly complaining, and wanting\r\nto force me to go back to his house, which he still kept on calling his\r\n_château at Bellevue_, his beautiful _château of Colonnes_.\r\n\r\nMaintaining that, as I had been, and was still, his boarder, he said, the\r\nusual meals were being served every day for me and my people.\r\n\r\nHe was eating them by himself—without much trouble, probably!—but still\r\nprotested, none the less, that I ought to pay him 25,000 francs a year\r\nfor dinners I refused to eat; and talked a lot of other nonsense.\r\n\r\nI wanted to put an end to these impudent molestations, and, as a clause\r\nin each of our two famous Ferney agreements submitted any difficulty\r\nthat might arise to arbitrators, amicably chosen by us, or, in default of\r\nthat, by the Tribunals of the Seine, I had recourse to the last means.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrators were appointed, and I explained to them the clever way\r\nin which the perfidious Cooper had blinded me, as well as his iniquitous\r\nfashion of fulfilling his obligations; I especially brought to their\r\nnotice that, by the terms of the contract, his lease was to last only for\r\nthe time taken up by my great affair; and that this had legally come to\r\nan end since my revocation of the powers I had given him.\r\n\r\nThe first decision of the arbitrators, given on September 30, 1828,\r\nwas in my favour, and annulled the agreement as to the letting of the\r\n_manoir_ of Bellevue at the rent of 25,000 francs; but, to my great\r\nsurprise, I found myself sentenced to pay 16,000 of it as a compensation\r\nfor the time I had spent in that wretched hole and for other expenses\r\nI knew nothing about for the most part; an indispensable condition for\r\nobtaining the restitution of my effects.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this, I fixed a day for them to be fetched, and the\r\nholder undertook to give them up.\r\n\r\nFresh matter for astonishment.\r\n\r\nMy servant presents himself and is informed that the removal is opposed\r\nat the request of M. Huré, furniture-dealer, in whose favour the honest\r\nCooper had backed my bills.\r\n\r\nLuckily for me, the President suspected some intrigue and ordered a\r\nsevere examination of the books and registers of the opposer, who, less\r\ndisreputable than his corrupter and not daring to play his part to the\r\nend, frankly owned to his odious rôle of catspaw.\r\n\r\nThe Court, having condemned him in costs, sent back my claim for the\r\nreturn of my bills for the judgment of the same arbitrators who were\r\nto pronounce as to the validity of the agreement in virtue of which I\r\nhad consented to them. But I had to endure such delays that my poor\r\nbelongings were not returned to me till after six months of waiting,[11]\r\nand my old villain raised so many quibbles and difficulties that the\r\ndiscussions relating to the second arbitration lasted a year.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of all these disputes I had been advised to write\r\nto the celebrated Comtesse de Genlis, formerly _governess_ to the Orleans\r\nchildren,[12] in order to induce her to reveal to me the secrets of this\r\nhorrible drama, which perhaps she herself had managed.[13]\r\n\r\nIn consequence, I composed a letter well suited to _her profound modesty\r\nand her noble disinterestedness_.\r\n\r\nSome days passed and no answer came; and, beginning to think that my\r\nletter had not been given to her, I decided to write another, which I\r\nsent by sure hands to our chaste Susannah.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MME. DE GENLIS]\r\n\r\nThe next day but one, M. de Saint-Aubin was announced, and there entered\r\na rather good-looking young man, refined and open in manner, who told\r\nme he had seen what I had written to Mme. de Genlis, with whom he lived\r\nand in whose confidence he was; adding that if I would give him mine, by\r\ndegrees he would persuade her to speak out.\r\n\r\n“Has she not already confessed to me,” he went on, “that your affairs\r\nformerly caused her much trouble, and that the evil genius who had\r\nbewitched the late Duc de Chartres was an Italian and still living?\r\nAnyhow, madame, the only motive I had for coming to see you was the\r\ndesire to be of use to one who is oppressed.”\r\n\r\nHe then showed me several letters from our _virtuous heroine_, in which\r\nshe lauded his talents, told him of her own doings, called him her best\r\nfriend, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the young rascal left no stone unturned to delude me; and\r\nwhen he thought I was well prepared, he offered to go a journey which,\r\nto judge by his hints and mysterious speeches, ought to be to my immense\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nDazzled by this display of verbosity and his gorgeous promises, I\r\nsanctioned his plan, and offered him 1000 francs to carry it out. He\r\nasked me for 3000, and we split the difference.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledgment of the sum I handed over to him, all he gave me was\r\nthis meaningless memorandum: “I have received from Madame la Comtesse\r\nde Newborough 2000 francs, on an agreement between us. Given in Paris,\r\nDecember 6th, 1828. S. D. de Saint-Aubin.”\r\n\r\nA few days later he announced to me his arrival at Nancy, and said he had\r\nalready got important information.\r\n\r\nI had just received this news, when an ill-dressed man holding a paper\r\nmade his appearance, calling out to me: “Didn’t you write this letter to\r\nthe Comtesse de Genlis?” And as I took it from his dirty and disgusting\r\nhands, to see if it was really mine, he went on: “The Comtesse won’t\r\nhave anything to do with your affair, which can’t be anything but an\r\nimposture. What! you claim to be the daughter of the Duc d’Orléans? For\r\nshame! you deserve to be finely laughed at.”\r\n\r\nI had him turned out at once, throwing my letter, which he wanted to get\r\nback, into the fire; and not only this, but I begged a lady, a friend of\r\nmine, to call for me upon my considerate confidante to express to her my\r\ndispleasure and to ask her for the papers I had been foolish enough to\r\nsend her.\r\n\r\nMy friend insisted on seeing her, and, after a long delay, she grew angry\r\nin her turn, promised haughtily to return everything to me, shut her door\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nAlthough my packet never arrived, I thought it would henceforth be\r\nbeneath me to have any intercourse with such a person, who, doubtless,\r\nwould have preferred remitting it to her dear adopted son, in the hope of\r\nreaping golden harvest from this fresh proof of her boundless devotion.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the cunning Saint-Aubin wrote again, assuring me that he was\r\ngreatly pleased with his mission, and had found out many things, about\r\nwhich he would tell me on his return.\r\n\r\nShortly after he wrote that he had just discovered the dwelling of a very\r\naged Italian woman, the former nurse of Chiappini’s son, who possessed a\r\nvery precious medallion and alone could give me more valuable information\r\nthan any I had yet got. He promised to bring her to Paris, provided I\r\ncould enable him to give her a gratuity. To my shame I confess that again\r\nI was so foolishly simple as to send him 500 francs, begging him to\r\nmanage to let me make her acquaintance as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSeven long weeks having passed with no word from him, I began to get\r\nimpatient, when he took it into his head to send me the well-worn excuse\r\nof an unforeseen accident. This is his amusing note—\r\n\r\n    “Madam, I may truly say that I have come back from the other\r\n    world. Some days after receiving your second letter—that is\r\n    to say, in January last—I had set out for a place I wanted to\r\n    find. I had hired a carriage for the journey. As the roads were\r\n    very difficult on account of the ice and snow, the carriage\r\n    was upset; it was a terrible disaster; I was carried away\r\n    unconscious, and it was only after six weeks that I began to\r\n    recover. During the lucid moments of my illness I wished very\r\n    much to write to you, but I dared not confide in any one.\r\n\r\n    “For the last fortnight I have been much better. As this\r\n    misfortune happened to me near Strasburg, I write to you from\r\n    that town.\r\n\r\n    “My friends and relations must be very anxious about me, for\r\n    I have not been able to write to them; besides, it would have\r\n    alarmed them too much if they had known of my condition.\r\n\r\n    “I shall be in Paris in eight days.\r\n\r\n    “I am longing to see you and to relieve the terrible anxiety\r\n    you must have been in at the total want of news.\r\n\r\n    “I have done all I could, and have much to tell you.\r\n\r\n                 “Your humble and devoted servant,\r\n\r\n                                                     “SAINT-AUBIN.”\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that I was somewhat surprised that severe\r\nsuffering should have made him completely forget both the old nurse and\r\nthe interesting medallion.\r\n\r\nAlas! my doubts turned to cruel certainties when I saw him come in plump\r\nand blooming, and with a look of long-standing health.\r\n\r\nAfter having at great length bewailed his _unlucky adventure_, he rose,\r\ntook leave, and contented himself with saying, as he left the room, that\r\nhe would come again and give me a full report.\r\n\r\nTired of waiting, after a few days I sent to the address he had given\r\nme, only to be told that he was known there only as being sometimes seen\r\nin the company of other young scapegraces who had left without paying,\r\nand that Saint-Aubin was no better than his companions.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the adventure.\r\n\r\nI have since discovered that this _chevalier d’industrie_ was the\r\nnear relative of the _venerable_ Comtesse de Genlis, _née_ Ducrest de\r\nSaint-Aubin!\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on, I had need of an English lawyer to manage my\r\nLondon affairs.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Mills was recommended to me as a model of integrity. I sent for\r\nhim; he came, showed me the greatest respect, condoled with me on my\r\ntroubles; took the liveliest interest in my concerns, and undertook not\r\nonly to manage everything in England, but to obtain for me, free of\r\ninterest, the sum necessary to meet the unjust claims of Cooper in Paris.\r\n\r\nDelighted to have made his acquaintance, I put myself into his hands;\r\nand in a little while he became my guide, my steward, my banker, and my\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nBy his advice, and against my own judgment, I wrote to the British\r\nAmbassador to ask his protection against my unworthy extortioner.\r\n\r\nTo this request his lordship _condescended_ to have an answer sent to me\r\nin these terms—\r\n\r\n    “Lord Stuart de Rothesay presents his compliments to Lady\r\n    Newborough-Sternberg, and begs her to send him a detailed\r\n    account of the business. Without this it will not be in his\r\n    power to be of any service to her.\r\n\r\n                             “The English Embassy, April 22, 1829.”\r\n\r\nAt once I put together my papers and sent them, with the following letter—\r\n\r\n    “Lady Newborough-Sternberg presents her compliments to Lord\r\n    Stuart de Rothesay, and, in accordance with the wish expressed\r\n    in his kind note, sends him the details of her case, begging\r\n    him to be good enough to give it his consideration.\r\n\r\n    “If his Excellency should desire fuller information, Lady N.-S.\r\n    will ask Mr. Mills to give it to him, etc.”\r\n\r\nUnluckily, amongst my papers there was a mention of my most important\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador, confounding the two, and fearing to compromise himself,\r\nsent the whole back to me with this laconic note—\r\n\r\n    “Milady, in returning the documents sent to me in your letter\r\n    of yesterday, I beg you to accept the regret I feel that I\r\n    cannot give you the help you ask by interfering in a dispute\r\n    between you and his Most Christian Majesty.\r\n\r\n    “I have the honour to be your Excellency’s most obedient\r\n    servant,\r\n\r\n                                              “STUART DE ROTHESAY.”\r\n\r\nAstounded at so prompt a change, I seized my pen and wrote—\r\n\r\n    “It appears, Milord, that you have misunderstood my meaning.\r\n    Please feel quite assured that I asked your help only in my\r\n    dispute with Cooper. If I had supposed for one moment that you\r\n    were to be helpful to me in my delicate affair, I should have\r\n    well deserved the mortification of being refused.\r\n\r\n    “But I thought I ought to have recourse to you to obtain\r\n    justice in a scandalous dispute arisen between two subjects of\r\n    the monarch whose representative you are.\r\n\r\n    “Is it possible, Milord, that you should regard my complaints\r\n    with indifference, and that you should refuse me the help you\r\n    so generously bestow on all those who implore it?…”\r\n\r\nThus ended my correspondence with the noble gentleman, and I refrain from\r\nsaying anything about his subsequent behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n    Ragazzini sent off—Proposal of Mr. Mills—Offers to Cooper—His\r\n    Account—His Disgust—His Calumnies—My Vindication—Decision of\r\n    the Arbitrators—Fresh Quibbles—Divers Sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all my outside troubles were added a host of domestic misfortunes,\r\nfor the most part caused by the unworthy confidant to whom my husband\r\nhad, so to speak, handed me over. I mean M. Ragazzini, who, proud of\r\nthe authority the Baron had conferred on him, became day by day more\r\narrogant, and now took no trouble to conceal his hateful vices.\r\n\r\nNo longer able to endure his presence, I made up my mind to dismiss him\r\nignominiously.\r\n\r\nBeing now alone and needing some diversion, Mr. Mills offered me one of\r\nhis sisters-in-law, whom he described as a real _miracle_ of nature. I\r\nthanked him for his kindness, but gave an equivocal answer. He returned\r\nto the charge, but I still made only complimentary rejoinders.\r\n\r\nAt last he spoke with such warmth, whether of the dangers of my solitary\r\nstate, or of the rare qualifications of the young person, that I\r\nconsented to take her as my _dame de compagnie_.\r\n\r\nShe came, and I very soon found her to be an insipid creature, to say\r\nthe least of it, whose wardrobe stood in much more need of my help than\r\nI did of her society. The tradesmen’s invoices can bear witness to\r\nthe zeal I displayed on her behalf as well as on that of her sisters\r\nand brother-in-law. But what would I not have done for a family whom\r\nI considered as my only resource for getting out of the hands of the\r\ninfamous Cooper?\r\n\r\nWhen the second arbitration concerning the agreement as to the management\r\nof the larger affairs took place, I asked for the cancelling of that\r\nagreement, offering to make good Cooper’s disbursements and fees,\r\ndeducting only the bills handed over by me on April 1, 1828.\r\n\r\nAt the invitation of the arbitrators he produced his account, in which a\r\nsum of 6,526 francs was placed to my credit.\r\n\r\nMy counsel, astonished at this, since he had reclaimed only the bills\r\nof £75 sterling each, asked for explanations, and it turned out that\r\nbesides those two bills, Cooper had received another for 5000 francs\r\nwhich, among the many deeds and bills of exchange he had successively\r\nextorted from me, I had forgotten. In consequence, I amended my plea, and\r\nasked for the deduction of this new amount.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to imagine the disgust of our _honest man_ when\r\nhe realized that he might have hidden for all eternity the existence and\r\nthe payment of my bill. According to him it was not just that a fit of\r\nabsence of mind should make him lose £200 sterling.\r\n\r\nUnluckily he could not do away with what was written in his account by\r\nhis own hand; but to evade the consequences of his _fatal_ admission he\r\nhad recourse to calumny.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, every one in Geneva had been alarmed at the first hint\r\nof my approaching departure, my debts were so numerous, and my reputation\r\nfor laxity so well known! Upholsterers and tradesmen had come in crowds,\r\nand I had all at once found myself in the toils of Rabelais’ terrible\r\nquarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing with which to pay off my debts, I had vainly implored the\r\nhelp of M. Hentsch, a banker of Geneva; but he himself, _poor Cooper_,\r\ntouched with compassion, had at once handed over to me 5000 francs which\r\nhe had in his purse, etc.[14]\r\n\r\nI should disgust my readers too greatly if I repeated here the vile abuse\r\nwith which he spiced this heap of inventions.\r\n\r\nAnxious to undeceive a public that did not know me, I wrote to Geneva,\r\nand found no difficulty in obtaining a large number of excellent\r\ntestimonials, of which I will quote but three.\r\n\r\n    1st. “Milady, we have received the letter your ladyship was\r\n    kind enough to write to us, and have been much grieved at the\r\n    lies which wickedness and calumny have dared to invent about\r\n    you; only a consummate scoundrel could be capable of it.\r\n\r\n    “Messrs. Hentsch have told me that they will write to you at\r\n    once, so as to undeceive the small number of persons who could\r\n    have believed this tissue of falsehoods. The Cramers will do\r\n    the same; and I can assure your ladyship that every one in\r\n    Geneva who had the pleasure of your acquaintance is indignant\r\n    at what you must have gone through.\r\n\r\n    “But we trust the culprit will speedily be punished, and that\r\n    we shall soon have the pleasure of having you amongst us again,\r\n    which we look forward to greatly.\r\n\r\n    “Madame Galiffe asks me to give you her respects, and to assure\r\n    you of the sincere pleasure it will be to see you again.\r\n\r\n    “Accept the assurance of my profound respect, and of the great\r\n    esteem with which I have the honour to be your ladyship’s very\r\n    humble and obedient servant.\r\n\r\n                                                          “GALIFFE,\r\n\r\n                                                         “Colonel.”\r\n\r\n    2nd. “Madame, I was less surprised than deeply grieved at the\r\n    contents of your letter to Colonel Galiffe; for my wife and I\r\n    felt only too much anxiety as to the result of your journey. M.\r\n    Cooper has quite justified the opinion of him we formed when we\r\n    saw him at your house, for we feared just what has happened.\r\n\r\n    “Good God! into what hands you have fallen! And how could so\r\n    fine and spotless a character as yours be blackened by calumny?\r\n\r\n    “But I have no doubt that you have speedily turned aside the\r\n    shafts of malice. As to what is said about your debts, I can\r\n    certify that I have known you to be most scrupulous in paying\r\n    all your accounts; that I have never heard of your being in\r\n    arrears with any creditor, and that I am in a good position to\r\n    judge, having had several conversations about your concerns\r\n    with M. Hentsch, who, I have no doubt, will testify to the same.\r\n\r\n    “But what need is there, madame, to continue in this strain, or\r\n    to undertake to clear so unjustly attacked a reputation?\r\n\r\n    “Many other better-known persons than I will come to your aid,\r\n    and in a little while you will receive from all sides documents\r\n    wherewith to crush your vile calumniators.\r\n\r\n    “I will conclude, madame, by sending you my most sincere wishes\r\n    that your enemies may get what they deserve, and may their\r\n    punishment be as certain as all I have said is true.\r\n\r\n    “My wife asks me to give you all kind messages, and I beg you,\r\n    Madame la Baronne, to accept the expression of my respect and\r\n    my sincere attachment.\r\n\r\n                                                     “J.

What can we do to\r\n    communicate to your judges the feelings of the highest esteem\r\n    which we have for you?\r\n\r\n                    “Your very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                “H. HENTSCH, FILS.”\r\n\r\nIt needed nothing more to obliterate the disastrous impressions my\r\naudacious calumniator’s lies might have made.\r\n\r\nI was summoned to declare if I had, or had not, received from him\r\nthe amount of my bill; and on my formal answer in the negative, the\r\narbitrators of course said to us—\r\n\r\n“Since you disagree as to facts, we cannot pronounce for one or the\r\nother; we must give our decision according to the wording of the bill. If\r\nit was endorsed, ‘Sum received in cash,’ Mr. Cooper is right; if not, he\r\nis wrong. Therefore, produce this bill.”\r\n\r\nI wrote at once to my London banker to get an authentic copy; but before\r\nit arrived, the extension of time for the arbitration expired, and the\r\narbitrators gave their decision. They cancelled the agreement concerning\r\nthe larger interests, fixed Mr. Cooper’s disbursements at 4,169 francs\r\n51; assigned him 3000 francs for his trouble,[15] and ended by making\r\nthis order—\r\n\r\n“We declare and decree that on Mr. Cooper returning the deeds, papers and\r\nall other effects, the Lady de Sternberg shall be under the obligation to\r\npay him the sum of 7,169 francs 51; that Mr. Cooper, on payment of the\r\nsaid sum, shall return to her the two bills of £75 sterling each, unless\r\ntheir worth is deducted from the 7,169 francs 51.\r\n\r\n“We reserve to both parties their respective rights as to the deduction,\r\nclaimed by the Lady de Sternberg, of £200 sterling, the amount of the\r\nthird bill received by Mr. Cooper.\r\n\r\n“On the fulfilment by Lady de Sternberg of the above directions, we\r\ndeclare that she shall be freed from all obligations to Mr. Cooper\r\narising out of the agreement of April 27, 1828.”\r\n\r\nThe execution of this judgment could present no difficulties except for\r\nthat concerning the bill for £200 sterling, with which it could not deal.\r\n\r\nA few days later the bill arrived; it was endorsed: “Sum received on my\r\naccount from the testamentary executors of the late Lord Newborough”; and\r\nCooper had sworn that it was endorsed, “Sum received in cash.”\r\n\r\nThe 5000 francs therefore ought to be deducted from the 7,169 francs\r\n51. Cooper refused to deduct them; I proposed to him to submit this\r\ndifficulty anew to the arbitrators, who, knowing the business in all its\r\ndetails, could decide on it at once.\r\n\r\nAn honest man would have gladly accepted this expeditious settlement;\r\nbut our scoundrel, who had already seen his way to take advantage of his\r\nposition, absolutely refused.\r\n\r\nHaving extra-judicially called upon him to name his arbitrator, and on\r\nhis failing to respond to this summons, I applied to the President of the\r\nCourt, who assigned me one.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed for the meeting of the “friendly arbitrators,”\r\nDriver-Cooper sent word to them that he opposed their proceeding until\r\nafter the cancelling of the bills; and they thought themselves bound to\r\nabstain from a decision until there had been legal enactment on this\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAt the same time my rascal sent me orders to pay him the full sum of\r\n7,169 francs 51, which he must receive at once, so depriving me by his\r\nfrivolous objections of the power of previously effecting the deduction\r\nof the 5000 francs, which had nevertheless been so expressly reserved for\r\nme by the decree of the arbitrators. But I knew my man too well not to\r\nforesee that after obtaining the payment he demanded, he would take every\r\nmeans to refuse my demand, even to the declinatory plea of the French\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\nIn consequence I made him an actual offer of the sum of 2,169 francs\r\n51, and as to the 5000 francs representing the value of my bill of £200\r\nsterling, I proposed to deposit it in the _Caisse de Consignations_, not\r\nto be withdrawn by Mr. Cooper until it was decided that the aforesaid\r\ndeduction could not be made.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I summoned Mr. Cooper to make a declaration of my available\r\neffects, and to be ordered to return to me all my deeds, under pain of\r\ndamages to the amount of 100 francs for each day’s delay.\r\n\r\nEven this did not stop him, and I was obliged to make an application to\r\nthe President to make him cease his persecution.\r\n\r\nThe President having made an order entirely agreeing with my wishes,\r\nCooper appeared disconcerted, and did not dare to appeal against it.\r\n\r\nIt was in this condition that the case was brought into Court. There\r\nmy rascal once more took up his rôle, and, as usual, bristled with\r\nobjections and quibbles which prolonged the disgusting dispute till\r\nOctober 8. All his cunning and ingenuity could not save him from the\r\ncondemnation he deserved.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! my triumphs were but funeral honours, and my gains nothing but\r\nactual losses.\r\n\r\nYes, my over-great belief in so unworthy a man had cost me more than\r\n28,000 francs, my peace of mind, and my health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n    Insertion in the Newspapers—Visit from M. Laurentie—His\r\n    Letter and its Publication—His Advice—A Bold Venture—My\r\n    Discretion—Insidious Answers—Behaviour of the Mills\r\n    Family—Letters from my Children.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I found that my troublesome dispute was coming to an end and that I\r\nwas about to recover both my documents and my own full liberty, I had the\r\nfollowing article inserted in several newspapers—\r\n\r\n    “In the year 1773, two illustrious French personages were\r\n    travelling _incognito_ in Italy, under the names of the Comte\r\n    and Comtesse de Joinville. On the 16th of April of that same\r\n    year the Comtesse gave birth to a daughter in the little\r\n    town of Modigliana. The parents, urged by ambition, resolved\r\n    to exchange their daughter for the son of a jailer, named\r\n    Chiappini, whose wife at the same time gave birth to a boy,\r\n    who has in consequence enjoyed the rank and fortune belonging\r\n    to the other child. It has pleased Providence to allow this\r\n    unjust usurpation to last for many years. But, to prove that\r\n    justice, though sometimes slow, is always sure, it has lately\r\n    permitted this unnatural action to be brought to light; the\r\n    proofs were sufficient to convince any impartial mind, and a\r\n    decisive decree of the Ecclesiastical Court of Faenza, given\r\n    upon the most undoubted evidence, has pronounced as to the\r\n    truth of the facts.\r\n\r\n    “The father, many years ago, met with a violent death; the\r\n    mother survived him, but has now been eight years dead; and\r\n    there is no doubt that the parents during their lifetime\r\n    entrusted certain papers and documents to persons who were then\r\n    in their confidence.\r\n\r\n    “It is needless to add that these documents are of the highest\r\n    importance to the daughter who was deprived of her proper\r\n    position. In the name of justice and humanity, she entreats any\r\n    persons who may be in possession of documents concerning this\r\n    matter, to send such information, in writing, to the Baronne de\r\n    S., 18 Rue Vivienne, Paris.\r\n\r\n    “They may feel assured of a large reward from the person\r\n    concerned.”\r\n\r\nA few days later I had almost the same words again put in; at last, M.\r\nMills having called a third time at the office of the _Quotidienne_,\r\nM. Laurentie said he would like to see me before the third insertion\r\nwas made, alleging that he could be of much more use to me when he was\r\nperfectly acquainted with my affair.\r\n\r\nI was urged to receive him, and I fixed a day for his coming.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did on seeing me was to give a start of astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he had known at once that my paragraph related to the\r\nDuke of Orleans, and that, fearing his Highness’s anger, he wanted to see\r\nmy papers before going further.\r\n\r\nI at once got together some imperfect copies that had chanced to escape\r\nthe insatiable Cooper’s greedy rapacity, and handed him the parcel.\r\n\r\nHe strongly advised me against any mysterious or partial publication of\r\nmy story, but to bring it to the full light of day.\r\n\r\nI told him that such was my intention.\r\n\r\n“You will do well,” he said; “and I assure you your likeness to Louis XIV\r\nis so striking that only to see you is to be convinced.”\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to describe my surprise when, three days later, I\r\nreceived my packet, accompanied, for all apology, by the following brief\r\ncommunication—\r\n\r\n    “MADAME LA BARONNE,\r\n\r\n    “I have the honour of returning you the papers you committed to\r\n    my care.\r\n\r\n    “I have had an opportunity of tracing the truth to its source,\r\n    and have ascertained that M. le Duc and Mme. la Duchesse\r\n    d’Orléans did not quit Paris or the Court in the year 1773.”[16]\r\n\r\n    “Therefore I cannot permit the _Quotidienne_ to print a single\r\n    line concerning the extraordinary and mysterious event spoken\r\n    of in these papers.\r\n\r\n    “I have the honour to be, Madame la Baronne,\r\n\r\n              “Your very humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                       “LAURENTIE.”\r\n\r\nTo astonishment succeeded just indignation when in the numbers for the\r\n2nd and 3rd of November I read what follows—\r\n\r\n    “The public may have remarked, some time ago, a notice in\r\n    the _Quotidienne_ in which there was mention of a Comte and\r\n    Comtesse de Joinville, who, in 1773, when in Italy, had a child\r\n    of the female sex for which a male child was substituted, and\r\n    information was asked as to this mysterious substitution.\r\n\r\n    “Whatever may have been the purpose of the person who sent\r\n    us this notice, it is our duty to declare that we take no\r\n    responsibility for it.\r\n\r\n    “We have even been able to ascertain that its publication masks\r\n    an intrigue in which we could not be expected to meddle, and\r\n    we retract the notice sent to our office, and which, at first\r\n    sight, might seem to be simply an announcement relating to\r\n    family matters.”\r\n\r\nAt first I wanted to force the audacious editor to insert in his journal\r\nan answer which would have let every one know of his criminal abuse of\r\nconfidence, and ask him how he dared brand with the odious name of\r\n_intrigue_ a claim which, from my papers so trustfully given over to him,\r\nhe knew to be based on the depositions of numerous witnesses, and on an\r\nepiscopal judgment given with the most imposing formalities.\r\n\r\nBut on consideration I decided that my complete Memoirs being about to\r\nappear, France and the whole of Europe would do me enough justice after\r\nreading them.\r\n\r\nI wanted some one to correct the many mistakes which my pen, so unskilled\r\nin the French language, had made without taking from my story its\r\noriginal simplicity.\r\n\r\nM. Lafont d’Aussonne, author of the _Mémoires universels de la Reine de\r\nFrance_, called on me, discoursed on his literary talents, offered me his\r\nservices, and succeeded in getting me to give him a copy of my notes.\r\nHere is his letter of the next day—\r\n\r\n    “MADAME,\r\n\r\n    “I have spent part of the night in reading your papers. I find\r\n    them convincing, and am astonished only at one thing—that you\r\n    have been so long in attacking the unlawful possessor. I shall\r\n    have the honour of seeing you this evening at the same hour as\r\n    yesterday.\r\n\r\n            “Your very respectful and devoted servant,\r\n\r\n                                               “LAFONT D’AUSSONNE.”\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with his way of looking at it, and with all the\r\narguments with which he supported my interesting affair; but with a swift\r\nchange of front he wrote to me a few days later—\r\n\r\n    “However long the time I have devoted to the papers you\r\n    committed to me, madame, I grudge neither the time nor the work\r\n    if I may keep your confidence and your esteem. From things I\r\n    know of and approaching events, I am convinced that your cause\r\n    has its dangers, and that you must be prepared for oppositions,\r\n    humiliations, delays and troubles innumerable.\r\n\r\n    “Your last years will be years of grief and affliction; I am\r\n    not exaggerating.\r\n\r\n    “An opportunity is now offered me of rendering you the greatest\r\n    of services by giving you rest and peace of mind.\r\n\r\n    “You are a good wife and tender mother; you might, at the same\r\n    time, give delight to your family and to the excellent persons\r\n    who have given such proof of their constancy and their devotion\r\n    by combining with you.\r\n\r\n    “As for myself, madame, I have no thought but to repeat the\r\n    assurance of my respectful and sincere devotion.\r\n\r\n                                               “LAFONT D’AUSSONNE.”\r\n\r\nAt once I saw through the plot, and wishing to find out what offers would\r\nbe made me, I replied in such a fashion as to let it be believed that I\r\nwas quite willing to make concessions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIA STELLA, LADY NEWBOROUGH, BARONNE DE STERNBERG]\r\n\r\nMy friend fell into the trap, loudly applauded my quite futile letter and\r\nsent me a curious composition, of which M. d’Aussonne declared he had\r\nsecretly sent a copy to my adversary.\r\n\r\n    “MONSEIGNEUR,\r\n\r\n    “As M. de Broval’s illness or sufferings may last some long\r\n    time, I take the respectful liberty of addressing you directly.\r\n\r\n    “I have not forgotten that, five years ago, your Royal Highness\r\n    did me the honour to send for me to your gallery that I might\r\n    give my opinion on some wrongly-named or doubtful portraits,\r\n    and that you received me with marked affability.\r\n\r\n    “Something has now happened, monseigneur, which, in a fashion,\r\n    brings me again to your notice.\r\n\r\n    “Lady Newborough, Baronne de Sternberg, having read with great\r\n    interest at Nice, where she was then living, my _Mémoires\r\n    universels de la Reine de France_, wished to know its author;\r\n    and this lady, pleased with my eagerness, has entrusted me with\r\n    the revision of her own Memoirs written entirely in her own\r\n    hand, that I may put them into shape and give them a literary\r\n    style.\r\n\r\n    “Devoted as my whole life has been to the defence of the\r\n    greatly unfortunate, I did not hesitate to accept this\r\n    commission; and I think I have made some improvements in a book\r\n    good society seems to me to be eagerly expecting, here and\r\n    elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    “With my mind full of the strange details contained in these\r\n    Memoirs, I cannot help looking upon the prodigious noise such\r\n    revelations will make in the world as _a great political\r\n    event_; and I ask myself if I should not be doing a good\r\n    action in endeavouring to find some means for bringing about\r\n    conciliation and peace.\r\n\r\n    “There is no room for doubt, monseigneur, that milady, by the\r\n    advice of her lawyers, will find herself obliged to prove,\r\n    by numberless traits, character and conduct that the inhuman\r\n    father, by whom she was forsaken, made the criminal exchange\r\n    for his _own immoral ends_. After this, we shall see this\r\n    father, already so notorious, handed over to the judgment\r\n    of all Europe. As to the gist of the principal question,\r\n    monseigneur, you must already know everything. You know of\r\n    Lorenzo Chiappini’s clear statement, made but a few moments\r\n    before his death; you know of the numerous depositions of so\r\n    many candid and unexceptionable witnesses; you know of the\r\n    solemn decree of the august Tribunal which restored to Maria\r\n    Stella her original position, and as a consequence, her rights.\r\n\r\n    “From the moment that striking judgment was pronounced, milady\r\n    was enabled fearlessly to sign herself _née de Joinville_; and\r\n    we have no other Joinvilles but the Princes of the House of\r\n    Orleans.\r\n\r\n    “The documents obtained in Italy are already very\r\n    considerable; those discovered in France are not less so; and\r\n    the two journeys in Italy are proved.\r\n\r\n    “To these remarkable details I beg your Highness to be pleased\r\n    to add the following facts.\r\n\r\n    “Milady’s profile is extraordinarily like that of Madame la\r\n    Dauphine; seen at three-quarters her face is the image of that\r\n    of Mademoiselle d’Orléans, etc. Lord Newborough, her eldest\r\n    son, bears so strong a resemblance to Louis XIV, and her second\r\n    son, M. Chevalier Wins (_sic_) to the late Comte de Beaujolais,\r\n    that the artists are amazed.\r\n\r\n    “And now, monseigneur, I will add, by your gracious permission,\r\n    a fact which is as extraordinary and seems miraculous; the\r\n    two brothers Chiappini, each the image of his father, have\r\n    the honour of resembling you. The inhabitants of Florence and\r\n    Modigliana are all agreed on this point.\r\n\r\n    “I have given you but a short summary of this important\r\n    affair, known to no one better than to myself since I have had\r\n    everything under my own eyes.\r\n\r\n    “My great respect for the name of Bourbon leads me to hope\r\n    that confidential matter of this kind may not be told in\r\n    the market-place, to become the fable or the romance of all\r\n    parties. With all my heart I desire that the life of our\r\n    beloved Duc de Bordeaux may be spared; but if, by a stroke of\r\n    fate, that fragile olive-branch were snatched from France, the\r\n    Salic Law would call your children to the throne, and it might\r\n    be painful, perhaps dangerous, for them not to have public\r\n    opinion with them.\r\n\r\n    “You anticipate, monseigneur, what would be my respectful\r\n    advice, and I beg you to see in my action no motives but those\r\n    dictated by kindness, wisdom and prudence.\r\n\r\n    “The excellent milady, who admires my works, has favoured their\r\n    author with her partial confidence; but I have the honour of\r\n    writing to you without her knowledge.\r\n\r\n    “I wish to help her to the ease of mind so astounding a trial\r\n    could not fail to destroy; and, if you have sufficient trust in\r\n    me to accept me as intermediary, I feel a secret presentiment\r\n    that I shall be able to induce her to make peace.\r\n\r\n    “I am a daily witness of her respect and admiration for Louis\r\n    XIV, Henri IV, etc., whom she looks upon as her ancestors; but\r\n    I know, too, that she adores her beloved Edward, her youngest\r\n    son, from whom she has been cruelly separated; and by this very\r\n    natural way I think I may reach her heart.\r\n\r\n    “If so, I shall rejoice at having restored her to life and\r\n    peace, and to have spared you, monseigneur, an unpleasant\r\n    dispute through which your children, sooner or later, must have\r\n    suffered.\r\n\r\n    “Allow me with the greatest respect to sign myself your Royal\r\n    Highness’s very humble and obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                               “LAFONT D’AUSSONNE.”\r\n\r\nAll this inspired me with invincible dread of a man who, like so many\r\nothers, thus played me false. To escape his snares I began by politely\r\nrefusing to see him; then, under various pretexts, I asked him to\r\nsend back my books and papers, and tried to make him understand my\r\nvery natural apprehensions. His letters will prove the accuracy of my\r\nstatements—\r\n\r\n    1st. “Madame, I have the honour to return you the books\r\n    relating to the great affair. I will also collect the papers\r\n    you ask for and this evening you shall receive them in a sealed\r\n    parcel. I like to take back such important things myself.\r\n\r\n    “For God’s sake don’t allow yourself to have any doubt of me or\r\n    my doings. I am doing what is for the best, and for your sole\r\n    and veritable benefit.\r\n\r\n    “If I asked to see you for a moment, it was to tell you of\r\n    a most important matter which has to do with what you were\r\n    told in Italy—that a _French ecclesiastic knew a great secret\r\n    concerning all this_.\r\n\r\n    “While I write to you, a person in my confidence is taking the\r\n    necessary steps for discovering what the Duke wishes to do as\r\n    to the matter about which I wrote to him.\r\n\r\n    “Rest assured, milady, that God decreed your acquaintance with\r\n    me, and that you will never find another with a heart so good\r\n    and large as mine, or so noble a probity.\r\n\r\n    “But your misfortunes have naturally made you timid and\r\n    suspicious, and you may feel quite certain that I am too\r\n    reasonable to take offence. Your most respectful and devoted\r\n    servant,” etc.\r\n\r\n    2nd.—“Madame, What I told you in my letter of yesterday rests\r\n    on the evidence of two persons, of whom one, aged and infirm,\r\n    and of a timid and nervous disposition, has told me what she\r\n    knows, and by her explanations has enabled me to explain to\r\n    myself things which formerly did not sufficiently influence me,\r\n    for I was the best friend and vindicator of _him who knew all_.\r\n\r\n    “The other person, who is still alive, will play no part\r\n    whatever in all this, so greatly does she dread the vengeance\r\n    of the Duke of Orleans.\r\n\r\n    “But I, who do not fear him, promise you that, if _we go on\r\n    acting in unison_, I will state and proclaim everything.\r\n\r\n    “How could you, madame, suppose for one moment that my actions\r\n    concealed any plot—actions as clear as day?\r\n\r\n    “After making a thorough examination of your case, I perceived\r\n    many probabilities, but, unfortunately, not enough proofs; and\r\n    that is why, as an honourable and kindly man, I advised you to\r\n    consent to a compromise, supposing your wealthy adversary able\r\n    to make up his mind to a sacrifice.\r\n\r\n    “In this way you would have gained an increase of fortune\r\n    to the benefit of your son, while the Prince, _real_ or\r\n    _supposed_, would have retained the votes and the respect of\r\n    the common people which your Memoirs and the noise of the trial\r\n    must inevitably have lost for him.\r\n\r\n    “No, milady, Mme. Fleury and I have not joined in any plot\r\n    against you; since that wicked Irishwoman wanted the Duke to\r\n    crush you by his power without giving you anything out of his\r\n    riches; while what I desire is that if he and you come to some\r\n    arrangement, he shall make over to you a considerable sum.\r\n\r\n    “The letter I sent him is surely proof enough of that.\r\n\r\n    “Is that letter, wherein I made such outspoken and humiliating\r\n    statements, nothing in your eyes? Is that possible? And what\r\n    can I do, Madame, to prove to you my sincerity and integrity?\r\n\r\n    “Oh! what a lesson for me!\r\n\r\n    “I must end here a letter I did not think to make so long.\r\n\r\n    “I have served you zealously, milady; and I don’t regret it,\r\n    for I believe your cause to be a just one in the sight of God\r\n    and of nature.\r\n\r\n    “I withdraw without resentment, although I am much hurt by the\r\n    insult offered to me.\r\n\r\n    “If the Duke comes to know what has taken place, he will be\r\n    much rejoiced, for he dreads my pen and the strength of my\r\n    writings.\r\n\r\n    “With all respect, madame,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these protestations, he could not win back my confidence,\r\nand I would have nothing more to do with him.\r\n\r\nMills’s sister-in-law was still with me; but for the last few days I had\r\nnoticed a complete change in her for which I could not account and which\r\nshe would explain to me only by pleading indisposition.\r\n\r\nOne morning her younger sister made her appearance and told me she wished\r\nto take her sister back with her to stay while the carnival lasted, as\r\nwhile she was with me she had no chance of enjoying the entertainments\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\nGlad of this opportunity, I replied at once—\r\n\r\n“With pleasure; I should be very sorry to put her out. Let her stay at\r\nhome as long as she likes.”\r\n\r\nThe two ungrateful creatures went off at once to collect the munificent\r\ngifts I had made them, packed up their parcels, and, from that moment,\r\nnever once took the trouble to inquire after me.\r\n\r\nI saw at last—but too late—what sort of family this was, and to what a\r\nset of people I had so generously given myself over.\r\n\r\nIt was only with the greatest difficulty that I managed to get a\r\nstatement of my accounts, and when I did receive it, I found myself\r\nfinely tricked!\r\n\r\nFor a few private consultations of no importance, and a few drives about\r\nParis, the considerate lawyer was content with asking me the _bagatelle_\r\nof 6000 francs; _inadvertently_ indebted me with £300 sterling, and\r\nexacted the rigorous payment to him of interest for which he had promised\r\nI should not be liable!\r\n\r\nI held my tongue, hoping he would not force me to divulge what I knew of\r\nmyself or had heard spoken of.\r\n\r\nMy eldest son had known him better than I did; he wrote later to me from\r\nMarseilles that he had always had strong suspicions about him and had\r\nnever ceased to look upon him as a professional humbug.\r\n\r\nThis letter from the young Lord Newborough, as well as showing the\r\ngreat affection he had for me, gave me besides two strong grounds for\r\nconsolation in the midst of my trouble, by assuring me of the restoration\r\nof his own health and of his undying attachment to my dear Edward.… I\r\nknew that for some time he had been suffering from a weak lung, and\r\nremembering his antecedents, I had felt grave fears; on the other hand,\r\nthe future of my third son was a source of painful anxiety to me.\r\n\r\nBut his kind brother did away with all my troubles on both matters by\r\ntelling me that the mild climate of southern Europe had quite restored\r\nhis strength, and by asking me to tell Edward that he could henceforth\r\nlook upon Glynllifon Castle as his own house.\r\n\r\nCould anything be sweeter to the heart of a loving mother? And it was not\r\nthe only sign of filial love that came to ease my mind. The youngest of\r\nmy children never failed from time to time to send me the expression of\r\nhis ardent love for me. This is one of his recent letters—\r\n\r\n“I am delighted to see that our _great affair_ is beginning to get\r\ncleared up and looks so well. I wish with all my heart that it may go in\r\nour favour, and that you may at last be able to enjoy some compensation\r\nfor the vicissitudes and cares and worries which you have had to bear for\r\nthe last seven or eight years.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, my dear mother, my most earnest prayer is that I may see you\r\nwin the victory in a trial you have so much at heart and which so nearly\r\nconcerns our family and your name, etc.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n    The Cause of my Delay—My Trustfulness—Louis-Philippe, Duke\r\n    of Orleans—Louis-Philippe-Joseph, his Son—Chief Vices of\r\n    the Last—Bad Son—Bad Husband—Bad Father Bad Friend—Bad\r\n    Citizen—Consequent Results.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ask my readers to forgive me for having so long entertained them with\r\nso many tiresome details. I had no thought at first of doing so, but the\r\nrecent attempts at the most impudent frauds[17] have more and more fully\r\nconvinced me that I cannot make too well known the various events which\r\nhave brought about the deferring of my just claims.\r\n\r\nAnd if my silence since I succeeded in getting back my deeds from the\r\nhateful Cooper causes some surprise, it must be told that they were\r\nhardly once more in my possession before I handed them over to a lawyer\r\nof reputation, who, after keeping them a couple of months, wrote to me\r\nthat, before definitely undertaking my case, he wished, through the\r\nmedium of M. de Broval or M. Dupin,[18] to get leave to make researches\r\nin the archives of the house of Orleans.\r\n\r\n“The result of this step,” he said, “would be decisive, and, when it had\r\nbeen taken, we could decide as to the following up or the relinquishing\r\nof the trial.”\r\n\r\nIt will be believed that I could not consent to be thus put at the mercy\r\nof my adversary. I asked for the return of my papers; but once more I\r\ncould not get them without the payment of 100 francs for the time my\r\n_comic_ lawyer had thought good to make me lose.\r\n\r\nI then decided to have recourse to one of those _colossal celebrities_\r\nwhose sublime eminence seems to place them so high above the fatal bait\r\nof bribes;[19] and these were at first his fine promises—\r\n\r\n    “Madame la Baronne, I have not yet been able to examine the\r\n    papers you were kind enough to send me. I propose to devote the\r\n    whole day to them to-morrow, and I will at once give you my\r\n    opinion on this _important_ business.\r\n\r\n    “Pray accept, madame, the humble respects of your obedient\r\n    servant,\r\n\r\n                                                            “B. F.”\r\n\r\nWho could believe that more than fifty days after I received this letter,\r\nmy packet had not even been opened, and that the _important_ business\r\nrested in oblivion?\r\n\r\nAt last I put it into the hands of a man whose excellent references\r\nproved him worthy of my confidence; he will not abuse it, and most\r\ncertainly neither he nor those he will employ in my service will behave\r\nlike those who, acting for me in the Cooper business, so cruelly ground\r\nme down.\r\n\r\nYes, I hope Providence has not quite forsaken me, and that the day of\r\nvictory will come; the many valuable discoveries the base machinations of\r\nmy enemies have been unable to prevent me making, vouch for it, and give\r\nme confidence amidst my many tribulations. Kindly lend me your ears still.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, at the time of the infamous substitution, these were the members\r\nof the house of Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of that name was Louis-Philippe, who married first\r\nLouise-Henriette de Bourbon-Conti, and, secondly, Madame de Montesson;\r\nbut this last union was always kept secret.\r\n\r\nOf the first marriage was born Louis-Philippe-Joseph, then commonly\r\ncalled Duc de Chartres, who, in his turn, became Duke of Orleans, a title\r\nhe gave up later to assume the ludicrous nickname of Egalité, under which\r\nhe made himself so ignominiously notorious. He had married Mademoiselle\r\nLouise Marie Adélaïde, daughter of the Duc de Bourbon Penthièvre, who\r\ndied in 1821, under the name of the Dowager Duchess of Orleans.\r\n\r\nLouis-Philippe-Joseph is precisely the person who, according to a host of\r\nadmitted facts, _seems_ to us to have been the guilty perpetrator of the\r\ncriminal exchange; I say _seems_, for submitting beforehand to the final\r\ndecision of my judges, I will do nothing to prejudice it.\r\n\r\nI will not say, with the historians of his life,[20] that the Duc de\r\nChartres, when scarcely out of his boyhood, showed the most depraved\r\ntastes, and took no pleasure but in wickedness.\r\n\r\nI will not say that from his youth upwards his degrading vices made him\r\nthe object of universal contempt, and ended by earning for him the vilest\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nI will not repeat that in his inextinguishable passion for riches he was\r\nnot afraid to show the greatest impatience at the prolongation of his\r\nfather’s life; that, not satisfied with degrading himself, he was willing\r\npublicly to dishonour her who had borne him in her bosom, and shamelessly\r\nforswore his glorious descent from the most august blood.\r\n\r\nI will not repeat that his wife had the constant affliction of finding\r\nher efforts to lead him into the ways of a wise moderation quite useless,\r\nand that she had to endure hardships of all sorts from a husband both\r\nhard and unfaithful.\r\n\r\nI will not repeat that he pitilessly sent the sad fruits of his\r\nprofligacy to the asylum for the poor, and that his legitimate children,\r\ngiven over very early into the hands of strangers, were never the objects\r\nof his care, seldom of his endearments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS\r\n\r\nLOUISE MARIE ADÉLAÏDE DE BOURBON-PENTHIÈVRE WIFE OF PHILIPPE-ÉGALITÉ]\r\n\r\nI will not repeat that, bad son, bad husband, bad father, he could not\r\nfail to be a bad friend, and that many of his confidants were the victims\r\nof his perfidy or his rage.[21]\r\n\r\nI will not repeat that his presumptuous rebellion, his implacable\r\nhatred for the best of kings; the murderous outcries against him he so\r\nshamelessly raised, and which, even in his own eyes, proved him the\r\nmost hateful of citizens, forced from him that admission, as true as\r\nhumiliating, “I would as soon be guillotined as banished, for where is\r\nthe country that would receive me?”\r\n\r\nBut no more—for I blush as I write these lines and my heart bleeds with\r\nshame!\r\n\r\nBesides, does it need more to represent the man we have just described as\r\nquite capable of the crime we think we have the right to impute to him?\r\n\r\nStill, we admit that the reality of a thing cannot be deduced from its\r\nmere possibility, so we will enforce it by arguments of quite another\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n    An Incontestable Principle—Title and Fief of Joinville—Travels\r\n    under that Name—The Comte’s Titles—His Description—His\r\n    Character—Deposition of the Signora Galuppi-Toschi—Certificate\r\n    of the Conte Falopio—That of the Priest Carlo Brunone—Letter\r\n    from Baron Vincy—Attestation of M. D.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentity of name, title, description, character, position, time and\r\nplace, are doubtless enough to establish identity of person, or nothing\r\nwould be able to prove it.\r\n\r\nLet us apply this clear principle to the matter in hand, and it will end\r\nin proof.\r\n\r\n1st. _The name._ Let us remember that the chief agent of the hateful\r\nsubstitution was a Frenchman called Louis, Comte de Joinville. Now, as\r\nhistory and the whole of the aristocracy are silent on the matter, we\r\ncannot even imagine that this title in 1773 belonged to any one not of\r\nthe Orleans family. Let us see if it could then be found _in_ that family.\r\n\r\nThe Fief of Joinville, raised to a barony at the beginning of the\r\neleventh century, and to a principality under Henri II, after passing\r\nsuccessively to several lords, had at last fallen into the female line by\r\nthe death, on March 16, 1675, of the Duc de Guiche, Prince de Joinville;\r\nand _Mademoiselle_, the daughter of Gaston de France, having inherited\r\nit in her own right from her maternal grandmother, Catherine-Henriette\r\nde Joyeuse, Duchesse de Guise, left it by will to her cousin-german,\r\nPhilippe de France, _Monsieur_, only brother of Louis XIV, and head of\r\nthe Orleans branch. Whence it follows that this principality is actually\r\npatrimonial in that family, and that the Duc de Chartres, son of its\r\nchief, had the right to call himself by that name.\r\n\r\nI say more: open the books written about him, and the frontispiece will\r\nshow that he was not only Duc de Valois, de Nemours, de Montpensier,\r\nd’Etampes, but also Comte de Beaujolais, de _Joinville_, de Vermandois,\r\nand de Soïssons.[22]\r\n\r\nI say still more: that is precisely the name under which he and his wife\r\nwere accustomed to travel.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 she assumed it to go to Holland; he had taken it in 1777 to\r\nvisit the Netherlands; the year before it was the title borne by the\r\nDuchess during the whole of her tour in Italy;[23] and to speak only of\r\nthe year of the exchange, the newspapers of the day forbid any doubt\r\nthat, under that name, and in the summer, the Duke had made a pretty\r\nlong journey.[24] And worthy witnesses, whose valuable evidence we shall\r\npresently quote, declare that the august couple bore that title precisely\r\nat the time of the exchange and in the very districts where this horrible\r\nagreement was made.[25]\r\n\r\n2nd. _The Rank._ According to the decree of Faenza, the Comte de\r\nJoinville was a French nobleman; almost all the witnesses testified to\r\nhis being rich and powerful, and if we may believe the evidence of one\r\nwho ought to have known more than any one else, since he had it direct\r\nfrom the man who no doubt had categorically interrogated the Comte\r\nafter his arrest at Brisighella—he was nothing less than a _prince in\r\ndisguise_.[26]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, too, that having been led before the\r\nCardinal-Legate at Ravenna, the Cardinal, on recognizing him, welcomed\r\nhim warmly, affectionately embraced him, and at once set him entirely at\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nNow, it must be pointed out that the etiquette of the Roman Church is\r\nthat Cardinals must embrace only the members of reigning houses, and it\r\ncould have been only the consideration due to so august a rank that could\r\nhave cut short the prosecution already set on foot by the inexorable\r\nagents of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing the titles of _Comte de Joinville, a great French nobleman\r\nbelonging in 1773 to a reigning family_ to be united in a single person,\r\nwho would not at once recognize Louis-Philippe-Joseph?\r\n\r\n3rd. _The Description._ The Comte de Joinville, the Italian witnesses\r\ntell us, had a fine figure; he was rather stout, had a brownish\r\ncomplexion, a red and pimply nose, and splendid legs.\r\n\r\nBut is not this the exact description of the Duc de Chartres as given me\r\nby the Abbé de Saint-Fare, who was his natural brother? A description\r\nagreeing completely with that of all who knew him. Here is one among many\r\nwritten by a man who had, so to speak, always lived with him—\r\n\r\n“Louis-Philippe-Joseph was a fine man in every sense of the word. His\r\nfigure, of more than middle height, was gracefully and faultlessly\r\nproportioned. The lower part of his body, from the waist downwards, could\r\nnot have been better made; the rest was rather heavy, but this stoutness\r\nwas not ungraceful.\r\n\r\n“As a result of his debauches, his nose and the lower part of his\r\nforehead were covered with small red pimples; and this sort of mask,\r\nwhich in fact disfigured him, but which he owed to his dissolute life\r\nand not to nature, made many people say that his face was hideous.”[27]\r\n\r\n4th. _Character._ The Comte de Joinville’s habits led him to extreme\r\nfamiliarity with people of low condition, and to great generosity where\r\nthe success of his ambitious projects was concerned; the positive\r\nevidence of witnesses, his sudden intimacy with the jailer, and the\r\npresents he made him, leave no room for doubt on that question. But by\r\nthese signs how can we do anything but believe in the portrait drawn by\r\nall historians alike of the Duc de Chartres?\r\n\r\n“He loved,” they say, “to mix with the crowd, and was never so happy as\r\nwhen he was able to cast off restraint and etiquette; he had a lively and\r\ncaustic wit, liked to banter his inferiors, and showed no displeasure\r\nat their bantering him. Despite the avarice of which he gave so many\r\nproofs, which went so far as to make him say that ‘a crown in his pocket\r\nwas worth more to him than all public esteem,’ he made no difficulty in\r\nscattering his sordid gains with profusion, either to obtain nominations\r\nto the States-General or to gain the affection of the great nation he\r\nwished to captivate.”[28]\r\n\r\n5th. _The Circumstances._ We have seen that the Comte de Joinville had\r\nsome reason to fear that his wife would never give him a male child,\r\nand that, in that case, he was afraid of losing a great inheritance\r\nabsolutely depending on the birth of a son.\r\n\r\nNow all the world knows that, in 1773, the Duchesse de Chartres, though\r\nin the full bloom of her radiant youth, had, in the four years of her\r\nmarriage, borne only one daughter, who died at birth on the 10th of\r\nOctober, 1771.[29]\r\n\r\nHer ambitious and covetous husband must therefore have greatly dreaded\r\nnot only the fading away of his flattering hope of winning for his line\r\nthe good graces of his compatriots, so as to obtain from them the _happy\r\ntransference_ of that crown of France, the object of so many longings,\r\nso many intrigues, so many secret manœuvres—it may be obscure crimes—but\r\nalso to fail in concentrating on his family the whole affection of\r\nhis father-in-law, the richest of princes, who, still only forty-eight\r\nyears old, had, since the death of his wife,[30] pretty often shown his\r\nintention of contracting a second alliance.[31]\r\n\r\nHere again, one feels, the identity is absolute. Finally, let us come\r\nto the point which seems to us to sum up everything, and is the most\r\nimportant and the best proved of all.\r\n\r\n6th. _The Time and Place._ It was in the spring of the year 1773 that on\r\nthe heights of the Apennines and in a diocese under the rule of the Papal\r\nStates, the Comte de Joinville, by means of a most atrocious agreement,\r\nsucceeded in securing an heir to his name and his lofty hopes.\r\n\r\nCan it be true that Louis-Philippe-Joseph and his wife were actually in\r\nthose districts at that time?\r\n\r\nLet us boldly declare that there is no doubt about it.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Genoa I learnt that at Reggio there lived a lady\r\nformerly in the service of the d’Este family, and who had heard the\r\nmysterious journey spoken of.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily believed that I lost no time in writing to her, and in\r\nher turn she made no delay in answering my questions, and assured me she\r\nwould willingly testify, in a Court of Law if necessary, to everything\r\nshe had told me.\r\n\r\nDelighted at this promise, I gave my orders so as to make sure of a\r\nproperly drawn-up document.\r\n\r\nI chose my lawyer; a proxy was appointed for the Comte and Comtesse de\r\nJoinville and any other person absent interested in the case.\r\n\r\nIn a word, all preliminary formalities having been duly performed, the\r\ninterrogation was carried out, _in consideration of her circumstances_,\r\nat the lady’s own house.\r\n\r\nAfter having sworn to speak the whole truth, and being questioned as to\r\nthe reason of her appearance, her age, her domicile, and her memory, she\r\nanswered—\r\n\r\n“It is in order to obey the command I have legally received from M. le\r\nPrésident that I have consented to this examination. I am sixty-four\r\nyears old; I live at Reggio, my native town, and I was actually born in\r\nthe palace of S. A. S. the Duchess Maria-Teresa Cybo d’Este, where my\r\nlate father, Josophat Galuppi, held the post of auditor of accounts and\r\nwardrobe keeper to the Duke Francesco.\r\n\r\n“My memory is very good, and I have a clear recollection of things that\r\nhappened in my young days.”\r\n\r\nAsked as to whether, while the aforesaid Duchess was living at Reggio, a\r\ncertain remarkable prince and princess had come there, she answered—\r\n\r\n“During the year 1773, and, it seems to me, in the late spring, their\r\nRoyal Highnesses the Duc Louis-Philippe de Chartres and his wife, the\r\nDuchesse Louise-Marie, passed through this town, on their way, I think,\r\nfrom the Papal States.\r\n\r\n“I know this because I was present when Count Manetti, the Duchess\r\nMaria-Teresa Cybo’s major-domo, was sent to the hotel to welcome the\r\naforesaid Prince and Princess and invite them to the Court. I know it\r\nalso because I was in a back room when Count Manetti came back, and I\r\nquite distinctly heard him say that their Highnesses sent their thanks,\r\nbut could not accept the invitation, partly because of the incognito\r\nthey wanted to preserve, as they were travelling under the name of the\r\n_Comtes de Joinville, French_, and partly because of the short time they\r\nwere staying.”\r\n\r\nQuestioned as to whether she knew of any visit of this Prince and this\r\nPrincess of Chartres to the town at any other time than the above, she\r\nanswered—\r\n\r\n“In 1776, just at the time of the fair in the month of May and when\r\nseveral other princes were also at Reggio, this same Princesse\r\nLouise-Marie de Chartres arrived in this town and stayed here till June.\r\nShe lived in the Giucciardi Palace which my father had got ready for her\r\nby order of the Duke Francesco. This time I saw her come to the Court\r\nwhere I was then living. When she came, every one told me she was the\r\nDuchesse de Chartres, and it was as such that she was known and saluted\r\nby all persons of distinction.”\r\n\r\nAfter these questions the examination was gone over again in the order of\r\nthe records of the trial which the notary public read to this valuable\r\nwitness, who said—\r\n\r\nOn the first: “It is quite true that during the spring of the year\r\n1773 their Serene Highnesses the Duc Louis-Philippe de Chartres and the\r\nDuchesse Louise-Marie, his wife, passed through Reggio on their way from\r\nthe Papal States; and that the same Princess in 1776, with other Princes,\r\ncame to the fair being held at Reggio in the month of May.”\r\n\r\nOn the second: “It is equally true that the aforesaid Prince and Princess\r\nwere travelling _incognito_ and with a small suite, and called themselves\r\nthe _Comte and Comtesse de Joinville_.”\r\n\r\nOn the third: “It is also the absolute truth that at the news of their\r\narrival in Reggio, the Duchess Maria-Teresa Cybo d’Este sent her\r\nmajor-domo, Count Manetti, to welcome these illustrious personages and\r\nto ask them to come to Court. But they did not accept the invitation,\r\nalleging the _strict incognito they were keeping_, and the preparations\r\nalready made for an early departure. And all this I know for the reasons\r\nalready given.”\r\n\r\nFinally, to other minor questions put to her she gave pertinent answers:\r\nthat she professed the Catholic religion; that she married the noble\r\nSignore Maria-Toschi of Reggio; that she was not a relation of mine, nor\r\nconnected with me in any way; that her statement had not been prompted\r\nby any one, and that she had been guided solely by her love of right and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nHer deposition having been read, she ratified it and confirmed it by her\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nIn the letter she did me the honour of writing to me she mentions two\r\nthings omitted in the interrogatory: i.e. _that the answer given to the\r\nCount Manetti had often since been repeated to her by the people about\r\nthe Court, and that the illustrious travellers, after spending the night\r\nin the hotel they had come to, left very early the next morning_.\r\n\r\nAfter such satisfactory evidence as this I sought further, and found\r\nmeans for fully corroborating it.\r\n\r\nFirst, this is the declaration of one who occupies a very distinguished\r\nposition—\r\n\r\n    “To give homage to truth, I testify to the whole world that\r\n    towards the spring or the beginning of summer, of either the\r\n    year 1772 or 1773—I am not sure which, but I am certain that it\r\n    was either one or the other—his Royal Highness, the Duke of\r\n    Orleans, passed through Reggio, where he slept one night, and\r\n    I remember his appearance perfectly. _Of middle height, rather\r\n    stout; a full face that looked as if it were pitted with the\r\n    small-pox, pimply; a red nose, and rings in his ears_:\r\n\r\n    “This highly respectable personage was travelling incognito\r\n    with a woman who was said to be his wife, and under the name\r\n    of the Comte _de Joinville_. I can all the better attest and\r\n    confirm this fact to any one, let him be who he may, because at\r\n    that time I was at the Court of Modena and in the service of\r\n    his Serene Highness, Ercole III of glorious memory.\r\n\r\n    “In testimony whereof I affix to my signature the arms of my\r\n    family.\r\n\r\n                               “BERNADIN GRILENZONE-FALOPIO,\r\n\r\n                         “Chamberlain to his Imperial Highness, the\r\n                                         Archduke of Austria, etc.”\r\n\r\nIn support of these conclusive declarations there is also the following—\r\n\r\n    “The undersigned, of the town of Alessandria in Piédmont, where\r\n    he resides; sixty-seven years of age; formerly professor of\r\n    rhetoric, pensioned by his Majesty the King of Sardinia after\r\n    having served forty years; being still quite sound in mind,\r\n    recollects, as well as if it had taken place yesterday, and\r\n    is ready to take his oath that it was about fifty years ago,\r\n    though on account of the lapse of time he cannot absolutely\r\n    swear to the year, that with his own eyes he saw the Duke of\r\n    Orleans, who then bore the title of Duc de Chartres, pass\r\n    through Alessandria, coming from Italy and going towards\r\n    Piédmont.\r\n\r\n    “In proof whereof he declares that he saw him in his barouche\r\n    which, with his large suite, waited more than half-an-hour\r\n    before the Countess Govone’s palace, a short distance from the\r\n    post-house, for what reason nobody knew.\r\n\r\n    “The undersigned stopped about the same length of time, and\r\n    remembers that it was in the morning, but has only a faint\r\n    recollection of the features of this nobleman. He feels certain\r\n    it was in the summer, and affirms that this is the exact,\r\n    unalloyed and whole truth.\r\n\r\n    “In testimony whereof he will affix his signature to it in\r\n    order that it may serve as an authentic and historical document.\r\n\r\n                                   “Alessandria, December 17, 1824.\r\n\r\n                                  “The Priest, CARLO BRUNONE, etc.”\r\n\r\nM. le Baron de Vincy de la B., in a letter he was so good as to write me\r\nlately, declares in set terms that “_being in the bosom of his family in\r\n1773, news was spread about in the country that the Duc de Chartres had\r\npassed through Berne under the name of Monsieur le Comte de Joinville_.”\r\n\r\nWhich, according to the reiterated assertions of d’Alquier-Caze,[32]\r\nwould seem to prove that the Prince crossed Switzerland either in going\r\nto Italy or on his return.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, M. D., formerly attached to the Orleans family, testifies\r\nthat the late _Madame the Dowager-Duchess had made one journey to beyond\r\nthe Alps before that of 1776_; and though he only dimly remembers that\r\nit was in 1773, he knows for certain that the incognito name was that of\r\nComtesse Joinville, etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to sum up, between Louis-Philippe-Joseph, Duc de Chartres,\r\nand Louis, Comte de Joinville, perpetrator of the shameful substitution,\r\nthere is no difference; everything about them is identical, everything\r\nproves, everything shows them to be the same person, one and the same\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n    Circumstances in my Favour—Incognito of the Princes—The Journey\r\n    of 1776—Extraordinary Precautions—The Duke’s Attention to his\r\n    Wife—Sudden Alteration—Delivery of the Princess—Complaisant\r\n    Witnesses—Parliament Absent—Dread of Self-betrayal—Secret\r\n    Sorrows—Mutual Indifference—Speech of Louis XVI—Others made by\r\n    d’Orléans—Striking Resemblances—Important Traces.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy task would doubtless be finished if there were no question but of\r\ninspiring confidence and giving conviction; but when I think of the\r\nadvantageous position of him I am going to fight, can I be too anxious to\r\nequip myself with weapons and support?\r\n\r\nLet us therefore consider certain circumstances which furnish us with\r\nfurther arguments in our favour.\r\n\r\n1st.—When, wishing to rid those who will receive him of the strict\r\nrules of a tiresome etiquette, a prince resolves to travel under the\r\nlittle-known name of one of his estates, he takes care to make public\r\nhis voluntary metamorphosis, so that, under the borrowed title, none\r\nwill fail to recognize him who bears it for the moment; and, far from\r\navoiding the palaces of kings, he visits them in order to enjoy their\r\ndelights more at his ease.\r\n\r\nAs an instance, let us take the journey of 1776.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chartres, having accompanied her husband to Toulon, where he\r\nwas to embark for his campaign at sea, resolved to visit the Peninsula,\r\nwithout having previously obtained the permission of the Court.[33]\r\n\r\nSurely she ought to have taken every care to conceal this _freak_, for\r\nwhich she expected to be banished at least.[34]\r\n\r\nDespite this fear, she had it pompously announced that she should travel\r\nunder the name of Comtesse de Joinville, published her itinerary, showed\r\nherself everywhere in public, and everywhere accepted the homage paid to\r\nher.[35]\r\n\r\nWhy, then, was nothing of all this done three years earlier? Why this\r\nprofound silence, this impenetrable mystery? Why the _secret incognito_,\r\nas the witnesses call it? Why did the Duke and Duchess wish to remain\r\nunknown, even to the extent of going to an inn, in a town over which\r\ntheir nearest relations reigned,[36] and preferring to pass the night at\r\na hotel rather than accept the invitation sent them to come to Court?\r\n\r\nDo not these precautions, this secrecy, point to the committing of a\r\ncrime, and a crime still far more heinous than that of disregarding the\r\ndeference due to one’s sovereign?\r\n\r\nBut let us ask, what was that crime?\r\n\r\nPoint it out to us!\r\n\r\nIn Heaven’s name, could we be told of any other but that very one with\r\nwhich so many incontestable proofs have made us acquainted?\r\n\r\n2nd.—During his wife’s first pregnancy, the Duc de Chartres never left\r\nher side, redoubled his endearments as her time approached, gave up his\r\nformer evil courses and behaved to the Princess in the most exemplary\r\nmanner. “Which,” says a writer, “gave immense delight to the Duke of\r\nOrleans, and still more to M. le Duc de Penthièvre.”[37]\r\n\r\nTrue to this way of behaving, in 1773, he did not leave the Duchess\r\nduring the months preceding my birth; the most he did was to take a\r\nshort journey to Chanteloup to see the Duc de Choiseul;[38] while after\r\nthe month of April it was nothing but a series of absences on his part,\r\nexcursion upon excursion, journey upon journey;[39] and, so far from\r\nexercising any restraint, or restricting himself in any way, he spent\r\nthe whole day with jugglers and pickpockets, cast about for new ways\r\nof sinning, and carried his excesses and debauchery to such a pitch as\r\nto amaze and shock the by no means susceptible servants of the Palais\r\nRoyal.[40]\r\n\r\nWhat are we to conclude from so great and sudden a change?\r\n\r\nOne of two things: either that the Duchess was no longer _enceinte_, or\r\nthat the Duke had ceased to care about the child she might give him.\r\n\r\nThis second hypothesis is evidently inadmissible, especially when we\r\nremember that the stillbirth of 1771 must naturally fill his ambitious\r\nspirit with the gravest fears.\r\n\r\nAnd if he had become so indifferent to the birth of a firstborn, why, six\r\nyears later, did he express such delight on finding himself the father of\r\na third son?\r\n\r\nWe must perforce come back to the first supposition, and acknowledge the\r\ndelivery of the Princess as already accomplished; which entirely agrees\r\nwith the account of certain inhabitants of Forges,[41] who state that she\r\nleft their town towards the end of July 1772, with all the signs of the\r\nbeginning of a pregnancy which would naturally find its termination in\r\nthe following April.\r\n\r\nBut if she was no longer _enceinte_ in April 1773, was it not impossible\r\nthat on the 6th of October of the same year she should have given birth\r\nto the _Duc de Valois_?[42]\r\n\r\nWhat is told about the time of that confinement is therefore a fable, and\r\na fable of which my story alone explains the motive.\r\n\r\n3rd.—It is evident that this event, which was said to have happened five\r\nand a half months after I was exchanged, required no precautions if it\r\nwas a reality; but, on the other hand, very many if it was a pretence.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it was not in the parish church and in public, nor even in\r\nthe Palais-Royal Chapel, but in some unascertained spot in that dwelling,\r\nthat the child, born, it was said, at three o’clock in the morning,\r\nwas privately baptized in the presence of two obscure witnesses in the\r\nservice of the Orleans family. No Minister of the King’s, no Gentleman of\r\nthe Court was to be seen; in a word, no one was there of whose devotion\r\nthere could be any doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd that is not all; in the _Gazette de Modène_, called _Le Messager_,\r\nNo. 44, Nov. 3, 1773, we read under date of Paris, October 11—\r\n\r\n“Every one knows that here, on the birth of sons of the royal blood,\r\na report is drawn up in evidence, in the presence of Parliamentary\r\nCommissioners who sign it.\r\n\r\n“This formality was neglected in the case of the Duc de Valois, and all\r\nthat was done was to add to the report made on the occasion the words,\r\n_Parliament absent_.\r\n\r\n“The report was presented to the King for his signature, and it is said\r\nthat, paying no attention to these words, his Majesty at once signed it.”\r\n\r\nBut the thing, according to the journal we quote, seemed so astonishing\r\nthat the public, not understanding it, thought to discover in it a sign\r\nforetelling very great political events.\r\n\r\n4th.—The journey of 1776 had been long planned, and even before leaving\r\nParis there was a positive intention of carrying it out.[43]\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was only in a letter dated from Antibes that the Duchess\r\ntold the King of her plan, assuring him there had been no premeditation,\r\nand alleging, as excuses, her wish to see her grandfather, the Duke of\r\nModena.[44]\r\n\r\nBut why was this excellent excuse sent from afar; why not dare to give it\r\nin person; why put oneself under the sad necessity of lying about it?\r\n\r\nAh! no doubt one feared for one’s own countenance; one feared to blush in\r\nspeaking the word _travel_, and, above all, the name of Italy; one might\r\ndread the withering look of a sovereign to whom indiscreet tongues might\r\nalready have revealed everything.\r\n\r\n5th.—On her return from this same journey, the Princess had hardly\r\ncrossed the boundary of her own country when, as reported by Mme. de\r\nGenlis, _she burst into tears_.[45]\r\n\r\nNow, these tears, after a short and voluntary absence, a simple\r\npleasure-trip, would surely have been senseless tears if they were caused\r\nby nothing, as pretends our _veracious_ historian, but joy at being once\r\nmore on French soil.\r\n\r\nWould it not be more natural, more reasonable, to attribute them to\r\nimportunate memories, for ever connected with the country just left?\r\n\r\n6th.—M. Delille, the Dowager’s private secretary, tells us in his\r\njournal[46] that this lady _confided to her father-in-law hidden troubles\r\nwhich she dared not reveal to the Duc de Penthièvre for fear of grieving\r\nhim too greatly_.\r\n\r\nCan it be said that this refers to the grief caused to the Duchess by her\r\nhusband’s misconduct?\r\n\r\nAlas! there was no secret about that; everything was but too well and\r\npublicly known; and it is to be supposed that Madame de Chartres would\r\nhave preferred going for comfort to her virtuous father to complaining\r\nabout it to the Duke of Orleans, who, in such matters, was no more\r\nblameless than his son.\r\n\r\nThese hidden troubles, requiring so much discretion, must therefore have\r\nbeen of quite another nature, and arose from a different cause.\r\n\r\n7th.—The sensitive Princess could never reconcile herself to seeing her\r\nchildren given over to the management of a _governess_. Her complaints\r\nnever ceased; over and over again she made warm and urgent protests.[47]\r\n\r\nYet who would believe it? These cares and anxieties had nothing to do\r\nwith the one of her sons who, by right of primogeniture, would have\r\nseemed most likely to be most dear to her.\r\n\r\nIf he informs her that he will be much away with his _friend_,[48] _she\r\nis quite willing; assures him that what suits him will always suit her,\r\nand tells him that she does not want to restrain him in any way_.[49]\r\n\r\nWhence arose such indifference in a heart otherwise so warm?\r\n\r\nAnd, on the other side, could real filial love, the love nature must\r\nperforce create, exist in one who thought himself lucky that he was not\r\nobliged to go to see his _mother_ more than twice a week,[50] and whose\r\naffection for his governess was so far greater than that he felt for _his\r\nown parents_?[51]\r\n\r\n8th.—His reputation having become somewhat inconvenient,\r\nLouis-Philippe-Joseph, in 1782, went to Versailles to ask permission from\r\nLouis XVI to absent himself.\r\n\r\n“The King,” writes an historian, “received him rather coldly, and\r\nanswered him in words to this effect—\r\n\r\n“_I have a Dauphin; Madame may perhaps be enceinte; Monsieur le Comte\r\nd’Artois has several children. You can do as you please. I do not see in\r\nwhat way you can be of use to the country; so go when you like and return\r\nwhen it seems good to you._”\r\n\r\nWhy this momentary silence and thoughtfulness, if it were not to remember\r\na fact about to be the object of veiled rebuke from august lips? And what\r\nfact? What cause for so severe a reprimand?\r\n\r\nAccording to all evidence it related to the _paternity_ of the traveller,\r\nand to the dangers with which his absence might have threatened the\r\nsuccession to the crown if it had not been for the existence of several\r\nchildren of the elder branch.\r\n\r\nWho would not feel sure that the monarch, knowing of the whole adventure,\r\ntook this opportunity of moving the culprit to shame and repentance?\r\n\r\n9th.—The Convention, after the defection of Dumouriez, having, at its\r\nsitting of the 4th of April, 1793, ordered that the citizens Egalité and\r\nSillery were to be watched, Sillery mounted the tribune and stammered out\r\nthese words: “If my son-in-law is guilty, he ought to be punished; _I\r\nremember Brutus_ and his sentence on his own son, and I will imitate him.”\r\n\r\nThen came Orleans, and, as he gazed at the bust of the First Roman\r\nConsul, he, too, said, “If I am guilty, needless to say, my head should\r\nfall; if my son is—I do not believe it, but, if he is,[52] _I, too,\r\nremember Brutus_.”\r\n\r\nThese horrible words, from which Nature revolts from the lips of a\r\nfather, can be well believed from those of a _complaisant_ husband;[53]\r\nbut could the well-known virtue of Madame la Duchesse allow of such an\r\nexplanation relative to her husband?[54]\r\n\r\nTo all these forcible arguments may be added one already mentioned, and\r\nwhich, after all that precede it, would be too extraordinary if it were\r\nthe effect of pure chance.\r\n\r\nI speak of the resemblance.\r\n\r\nThat of the present Duke to the various members of his supposed family\r\nis absolutely non-existent,[55] while he has all Chiappini’s features:\r\nloose-hung jaw; tanned complexion; brown eyes; black hair; slightly\r\ncrooked legs, etc.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I can proudly boast that I have nothing in common with the\r\nformer jailer; but every one is struck by the many points of resemblance\r\nseen between Mademoiselle d’Orléans and me—manners, tone of voice,\r\nphysique, shape and colour of face, all identical.\r\n\r\nI have the honour of bearing on my body certain marks distinguishing the\r\nlate Dowager; at first sight her handwriting and mine display the most\r\nastounding similarity of character.\r\n\r\nWe need not add that whoever knows the history of Louis-Philippe-Joseph\r\nmust have already discovered the disastrous source of the maladies I\r\nhave suffered from since my birth, and that I have so unfortunately\r\ntransmitted to my dear children, who themselves, in their turn, are the\r\nperfect image of the illustrious ancestors that I hold myself right in\r\nclaiming.\r\n\r\nWhat more could be wished for in the way of proof?\r\n\r\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that power and riches are two\r\ngreat means of corruption; that their own chief interests forced the\r\nperpetrators of the exchange to destroy as quickly as possible all\r\nessential traces of the deed; that fear and cupidity indubitably kept\r\nsilent the greater number of witnesses, who, in any case, could not\r\nbe very many, since, in 1773, they were already of a certain age, and\r\nfifty-seven years have gone by since then.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, also, that during this lengthy period took place\r\nthat revolutionary tempest which spared private rights no more than\r\npublic monuments.\r\n\r\nStill, with lively gratitude, I say it once again, Providence has had\r\ncompassion on me, and my latest investigations have furnished me with\r\nfresh pleas, which I feel I cannot with delicacy communicate to any one\r\nbut my judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n    Objections and Answers—Chiappini’s Ignorance—Name of the Maker\r\n    of the Exchange—Prolonged Pregnancy—Absence from Paris—Motive\r\n    of the Second Journey—Birth of the Duc de Montpensier and\r\n    the Comte de Beaujolais—Letter dated from Turin—Apparent\r\n    Contradictions—Virtues of the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn setting forth the strong arguments in my own favour, I have also\r\nconsidered those that might be urged against me, and I hasten to answer\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n1st. “In his letter Chiappini said that I was born in a position almost\r\nsimilar to, but still lower than that given me by my marriage to Lord\r\nNewborough. Yet how great a difference between them! How superior was\r\nthe first to the second, if I really had the honour of belonging to the\r\naugust house of Orleans.”\r\n\r\nThis mistake can be corrected in a few words.\r\n\r\nEvery one must see how extremely important it was to guard against any\r\nindiscretion on the part of the jailer, perhaps even such involuntary\r\nrevelations as his pride in the lofty position of his son might draw from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEvery sort of precaution, therefore, was taken to keep him in ignorance\r\nof the exalted rank of the Sieur de Joinville, whom he never knew but as\r\na rich nobleman simply bearing the title of Count, a title so common in\r\nItaly that no one pays any attention to it, so to speak.\r\n\r\nIt was by this title he must have called my true father, in order to do\r\naway with milord’s constant suspicions, when he came to London; and my\r\nhusband, knowing more about the French nobility than he did, and having\r\na notion that I might have its blood in my veins, gave me his commands,\r\nthen so inconceivable, to avoid the great people of that nation,[56]\r\nfearing, no doubt, that some unlooked-for circumstance might let me\r\ndiscover my origin through them, which would infallibly have parted\r\nme for ever from him whose only means of overcoming my insurmountable\r\nrepugnance was his perpetual references to the low estate from which he\r\nclaimed to have raised me.\r\n\r\n2nd. “Does it not seem strange that the Duc de Chartres, anxious to\r\nconsign an atrocious crime to everlasting oblivion, should have assumed\r\na name belonging to his family, and one so easily recognizable?”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to prove that when he first came to live at Modigliana,\r\nunder the name of Comte de Joinville, he had formed the fatal plan.\r\nPerhaps the simultaneous pregnancy of his wife and Chiappini’s may have\r\nreally given him the first idea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS-PHILIPPE, KING OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose, as is more probable, that this hateful plan had been\r\nlong made; how could he know what were the decrees of Providence?\r\n\r\nThe Duchess might just as well be about to give him a boy as a girl. In\r\nthat case, it would have been made public at once; Bishops, Cardinals,\r\nthe Pope himself, would have been informed of it; a courier would have\r\nbeen dispatched to Versailles; the Prince and Princess would have excused\r\nthemselves at Court by saying that the reason of their secret journey\r\nwas to go to invoke the Virgin of Loretto for the granting of a happy\r\n_accouchement_, which they had believed would not take place for some\r\nmonths yet. Therefore a name not belonging to their family would not only\r\nhave made them look foolish, but might have led to their being accused of\r\nfalsehood, or have even given rise to legitimate suspicions.\r\n\r\n3rd. “Why, even admitting the substitution, should the birth of the\r\nsupposed Prince not have been immediately made public? Why bring back to\r\nFrance the reputed mother with the false appearances of a pregnancy which\r\nwas made to last some months longer?”\r\n\r\nAn invincible sense of shame must necessarily have prevented a course\r\nwhich would infallibly have been taken in the absence of all fraud, under\r\nthe hypothesis of deceit.\r\n\r\nNot only was self-betrayal to be dreaded, but some possible imprudent\r\ntalker; and after that there would be no way of concealing a secret that\r\nthe mere inspection of the infants must reveal to the least skilful\r\nphysiognomists.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of this conjecture was suddenly proved by experience;\r\nthere is some indiscreet talk, and, in spite of the determined silence\r\nof the interested party, a little more and all would have been\r\ndiscovered.[57]\r\n\r\nHence a thousand anxieties, a thousand cares;[58] hence the absolute\r\nnecessity of having recourse to expedients and thinking out new\r\nstratagems; and hence, above all, the very natural idea of putting a long\r\ninterval between the real and the fictitious accouchement, so as to stop\r\ntongues, and, if need arose, to fall back upon the difference in dates.\r\n\r\n4th. “Is it absolutely certain that the accused Prince and Princess were\r\nabsent from Paris at the time of the exchange? The papers of the day seem\r\nto show the contrary. Do they not report that the Duke was in the Chapel\r\nRoyal on April 8, being Holy Thursday; that, on the 13th of the following\r\nMay, he accompanied his Majesty to the great review of the troops on the\r\nPlain of Sablons, and that in the month of June of that same year the\r\nDuchess was seen at the opera?”\r\n\r\nWe could, no doubt, content ourselves with sending our readers back to\r\nthe unimpeachable testimony which has already vouched for the actual\r\nfact,[59] without taking the trouble to reconcile it with the vague and\r\noften incorrect assertions of many newspapers; but, for the sake of\r\nfuller proof, we are willing to discuss the matter briefly.\r\n\r\nAs to the Duchess, it is incontestable that her absences after the\r\n10th of October, 1771, were so lengthy and so mysterious that certain\r\nhistorians, not knowing how to account for them, have maintained that\r\nshe stayed at the waters of Forges during two consecutive years; while\r\nseveral eye-witnesses still living testify that she spent there only two\r\nof what they call their seasons, of about three weeks each.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 16th of June, exactly two months after my birth[60]—a time\r\nquite long enough for her return—that she was first seen at the opera.\r\nMonseigneur the Dauphin and Madame la Dauphine were expected; and the\r\n_Duchess de Chartres_, says a writer, “_had taken care to be in her box\r\nbefore the arrival of the august couple_; so much was she in doubt as to\r\ntheir demeanour towards her.”[61]\r\n\r\nIt is equally well known that the Duke was not in Paris towards the end\r\nof May 1773, and that, failing him, recourse had to be had to the Princes\r\nof the house of Condé to appear at the funeral-service for the King of\r\nSardinia celebrated at Notre-Dame.\r\n\r\nThe list of assistants at the Holy Thursday ceremonies and at the Sablons\r\nreview ought to be looked upon as mere official etiquette rather than\r\nhistorical and accurate reports of events; the constant uniformity during\r\na long series of years to be noted is a convincing proof of this.\r\n\r\nAnd even admitting that the Duc de Chartres was actually in Paris on Holy\r\nThursday 1773, what does that prove?\r\n\r\nAt most that he was not at Modigliana the following Friday, the day of my\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nBut this, far from being against me, becomes, in a fashion, a presumption\r\nin my favour, as being absolutely in accordance with the deposition of\r\nthe sisters Bandini, who swore to having seen the Sieur Joinville before\r\nand after the exchange, but said nothing of his being there on the day it\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nWhat they said about that fatal day related to the Borghi family, the\r\ntwo children, the two mothers, even to Chiappini; the Comte alone is not\r\nmentioned.[62]\r\n\r\nIt might well be believed, then, that, the better to deceive inquiry,\r\nafter having sealed his infamous compact, he went back to Court to\r\nperform his usual function at that sacred solemnity;[63] and, as he was\r\nan expert traveller, and even able to drive a chariot himself, it would\r\nhave been still possible for him to start at once for the Apennines and\r\nget back there during the five weeks between the 8th of April and the\r\n13th of May.\r\n\r\n5th. “Supposing the Duke and Duchess of Chartres to have been the\r\nperpetrators of this abominable traffic, would the Duchess have returned\r\nto Italy three years later? Would she have reappeared under the same name\r\nof Comtesse Joinville and with such a display of luxury and magnificence?”\r\n\r\nAlthough at the time the Prince and Princess must have suffered from\r\ngrave fears, they had, nevertheless, ground for hoping that influence and\r\nmoney would, if necessary, be able to stifle the accusing voices of a few\r\npoor and timid witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut could they be certain of equally good luck in the future?\r\n\r\nTherefore it was necessary to think of and provide for everything. Well,\r\nwhat more efficacious and advantageous way of doing this was there than\r\nto put people on a wrong scent by confusing the dates? And supposing that\r\nsome unlucky echoes of the old rumours at Brisighella and Ravenna[64]\r\nwere still to be heard, what more likely to destroy them than boldness\r\nand bravado? What more plausible, deluding and beguiling than a visit\r\nin state after so short a lapse of time, a procedure which our opposers\r\nthink so improbable?\r\n\r\nIn this matter we feel that the objection absolutely contradicts itself.\r\nLet us examine it in detail.\r\n\r\nNature does not easily give up its rights; it makes itself heard even in\r\nthe hardest hearts, and the heart of a mother cannot possibly remain deaf\r\nto its mighty voice.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Duchess’s whole mind is drawn and attracted to the spot\r\nthat holds the first-fruit of her maternity, and there is born in her the\r\nardent desire to turn her steps thither.\r\n\r\nDespite _convenances_, despite obstacles, despite a thousand objections,\r\nthis desire must needs find fulfilment, with these two remarkable\r\ncircumstances: _i.e._[65] the first, that the Duke seems to have\r\nconsented to his wife’s request, only on the condition that she would\r\nbind herself in a very special fashion to keeping the secret inviolable\r\nby becoming a Freemason;[66] the second, that the arrival of the Princess\r\nat Florence exactly coincides with the time when great influence must\r\nhave been used with regard to Chiappini, who was not only suddenly called\r\nto fill a more honourable and lucrative post, but was admitted to some\r\nsort of intimacy with his sovereign, who was good enough also to take a\r\nquite wonderful interest in me.[67]\r\n\r\nAmong the patrimonial estates belonging to the Orleans family, that of\r\nJoinville was the finest;[68] it was therefore the most natural name\r\nto take for an incognito; to choose another might possibly serve to\r\nincrease the King’s displeasure and to awake dangerous suspicions.\r\nMoreover, the correct pronunciation of the word is so strange to Italian\r\nlips that it was hardly probable that the wretched inhabitants of\r\nModigliana would recognize it by the mere reading of the newspapers,\r\nwhich the greater number of them never saw.[69]\r\n\r\nFinally, if Madame de Chartres displayed such magnificence and brilliancy\r\nin the places she condescended to visit, it was only to put every one on\r\nthe wrong scent and the better to convince them that she had absolutely\r\nnothing to do with the simple and retiring lady so few people had seen\r\nsome years earlier.\r\n\r\n6th. “Supposing that Louis-Philippe-Joseph had determined on the\r\nsubstitution before his wife had given him a male child, would not the\r\nsubsequent births of the Duc de Montpensier and the Comte de Beaujolais\r\nhave induced him to make every effort to return the substituted child to\r\nits real position?”\r\n\r\nBut, admitting in our turn the possibility of such a reparation, there\r\nwas always time enough to carry it out; and it was expedient to make sure\r\nif the two first would live long; for, from their earliest years alarming\r\nsymptoms must have given rise to very sad and, alas! but too true\r\nforebodings,[70] while the health of their _elder brother_ was so assured\r\nand excellent that there was no need for fear about him.\r\n\r\nA reputable personage wrote to us lately—\r\n\r\n    “I have been carefully examining the portraits of the present\r\n    Duke of Orleans and of his two brothers, the Duc de Montpensier\r\n    and the Comte de Beaujolais. There is a striking contrast\r\n    between that of the first and those of the two others. In\r\n    fact, the Duke of Orleans has, as is well known, a strong\r\n    constitution, a robust temperament, and is common-looking,\r\n    having coarse features.\r\n\r\n    “As for the two others, they look poor and weak in constitution\r\n    and temperament, and of distinguished appearance, and bear no\r\n    resemblance whatever to their brother,” etc.\r\n\r\n7th. “The Comte de Joinville wrote from Turin that, ‘having lost the\r\nsubstituted child, he no longer felt any scruples on his account.’[71]\r\n\r\n“Would there be any meaning in such words from the lips of the Duc de\r\nChartres? Had he lost a single son in his life? Could this assertion\r\nrelate to the Duc de Valois, who is still alive?”\r\n\r\nLet us recall for an instant the insatiable avidity of the Chiappinis,\r\nand the whole difficulty will vanish. Is it not easy to believe that,\r\nfar from satisfied with the considerable sums they had received from\r\nmy father, and the annual pension handed over to them by the Countess\r\nBorghi, they must have kept up an incessant demand for more? Tired of\r\nthe worry, Pompeo and his mother must themselves have begged the Comte\r\nde Joinville to write them a letter which would thenceforth put a check\r\non the intolerable pestering of the _sbirro_ and his wife. The style,\r\nthe oddness, the curtness of this missive, all proclaim it the result of\r\nan arrangement between the two noble families. As it might always be of\r\nuse, it was carefully preserved; the other portions of the correspondence\r\nmight have been compromising, and were perhaps destroyed on the very day\r\nthey were received.\r\n\r\n8th. “According to the Signora Galuppi, the Duke and Duchess of Chartres\r\nhad but few of their people with them at Reggio;[72] how, then, did\r\nthe priest Brunone see them pass through Alessandria with a numerous\r\nsuite?”[73]\r\n\r\nTo dispose of this contradiction—in itself proof positive that there was\r\nno plot or bribery—there are two ways of fully reconciling the double\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n1st. The Signor Brunone, living in a town far from Court-doings, may well\r\nhave thought considerable what to a person living since her birth in a\r\nroyal residence seemed insignificant.\r\n\r\n2nd. Who knows if the Duke, when he started, did not leave in the Alps\r\nthe greater number of the suite, which he took on again afterwards, so as\r\nto destroy any sign of his having anything whatever to do with a man who\r\nhad been seen almost by himself on the other side of the mountains?\r\n\r\n9th. “If it is easy enough to attack the memory of Louis-Philippe-Joseph,\r\nwho does not know with what just and profound veneration that of his\r\nwife is looked upon, and which must, nevertheless, be tarnished by an\r\naccusation of unworthy complicity?”\r\n\r\nNo one can be more anxious than I to give the homage of my respect to\r\nthe memory of the Duchess; and my dearest wish would undoubtedly be to\r\nbelieve a life made illustrious by its many virtues, without a stain.\r\nIndeed, I had at first tried to persuade myself that, having been once\r\nbefore the victim of deception, she had again fallen into the snare woven\r\nfor her at the time of her first confinement.[74]\r\n\r\nA consoling illusion, which the stories of witnesses and many other\r\nindications did but too quickly banish from my mind![75]\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the finest characters are not without\r\ndefects, and no one who knew her could deny that the Princess was in\r\ntruth very ambitious.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the fact of her being her parents’ only child and sole object\r\nof their deepest love, was an incentive for this loving daughter to turn\r\nher fondest hopes to the birth of an august scion who should be the glory\r\nof her maternity.[76]\r\n\r\nOver this she ponders and frets incessantly, and, in the midst of her\r\nmagnificent surroundings, she carefully _conceals the grief she feels at\r\nfinding herself deprived of this blessing_.[77]\r\n\r\nIn consequence, she was naturally inclined to lend a favourable ear to\r\nthe temptation offered her by a husband whom, besides, _she would not\r\nfor all the world displease_,[78] and for whom her complaisance went so\r\nfar as to help in the concealment of his vices,[79] even to the extent\r\nof uncomplainingly sacrificing not only _her tastes and her health_, but\r\nalso _her warmest and most legitimate affections_.[80]\r\n\r\nThe crime once committed, she soon looked upon the wrong as irreparable,\r\nand from that time a false sense of honour, a deadened conscience, made\r\nit appear a duty to abstain from a revelation as degrading as it was\r\nunavailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibility, presumptions, relations of facts, statements by those who\r\ntell of what they have seen and heard; the absence of any interested\r\nmotive for their assertions; such are the foundations, the elements of\r\ncertainty, and it is by their means that two important facts have been\r\nproved: first, that of the exchange between the jailer Chiappini and the\r\nComte de Joinville; secondly, that of the identity of the Comte with the\r\nlate Duc d’Orléans-Egalité.\r\n\r\nSo I know who is my brother; I can name my mother; at last I belong to a\r\nfamily. Alas! shall I be for ever excluded, repulsed, from its bosom?\r\n\r\nShall I always be conspicuous as a witness to the truth that the\r\nDivine vengeance sometimes avenges the criminal’s guilt even upon his\r\nunfortunate posterity?\r\n\r\nI have been derided for my ridiculous credulity; accused of pursuing\r\nphantoms, of feeding on dreams and idle fancies.\r\n\r\nKind and attentive reader, you have seen, you have examined, the papers\r\nand the evidence I have submitted to you; you have considered and weighed\r\nthem all; now give judgment, and condemn me if my documents are but lies,\r\nif my claims are but folly and wild extravagance.\r\n\r\nBut no! I dare to say your decision has been in my favour; and this\r\nflattering victory foretells for me the fullest, the happiest results.\r\n\r\nNo; it will not be in vain that I shall carry my humble supplications to\r\nthe foot of the august throne where sits the most equitable as the best\r\nof kings; it will not be in vain that I shall lift my eyes and send forth\r\nmy hopes to the sanctuary of justice; the throne will cover me with its\r\nbeneficent shadow, and justice will give me the victory. Victory all\r\nthe sweeter to my heart that then I shall be able to follow my love of\r\nliberality and benevolence without restraint or caution.\r\n\r\nAnd what other compensation have I for so many perfidies and\r\npersecutions; for the long-drawn-out torture of the sad and solitary life\r\nto which I have been reduced?\r\n\r\nShall I be believed if I say that this profound sadness, this dark\r\nmelancholy, that crushes and consumes me, does not arise solely from the\r\nvast abyss of my own misfortunes; it has, too, another cause in the cruel\r\ndistress I have already inflicted on the involuntary usurper of so many\r\nrights which henceforth he cannot keep without guilt; for I know that\r\nshe whom he wishes to appear so weak, and whom he affects to look upon\r\nwith nothing but contempt, has troubled and frightened him; and, without\r\nknowing it, he proclaims and cries it aloud.[81]\r\n\r\nAnd what especially increases my sorrow and completes my trouble is to\r\nthink that that must fall upon a Princess so worthy of all respect and\r\nalso upon the offspring of that venerable mother; and if I were thinking\r\nof nothing but my own interests, if I were the only person concerned,\r\nthere would soon be a full and complete surrender.\r\n\r\nBut no! maternal love; the honour of my race; the glory of the most\r\nancient of dynasties; all speak to me with their imperious voices, and\r\nhow can I refuse the hard tasks imposed upon me?\r\n\r\nBorn of illustrious blood, my sentiments will always accord, always\r\nharmonize, with the loftiness of my origin.\r\n\r\nIt is true I see myself parted from my friends, separated from all I hold\r\nmost dear on earth; I am alone, without stay or support; but the memory\r\nof my ancestors, the thought of my dear children, lead me on and rouse me\r\nto battle, and fighting under such banners how could I fail in courage or\r\nboldness? What greater proof of that boldness and courage could I give\r\nthan my being here? I could have gone back to my adopted country, to\r\nthe bosom of that tender mother, that gracious England to whom I owe an\r\neverlasting debt of love and gratitude.\r\n\r\nFrom there I could have looked without terror upon the perils of the\r\nfight and seen the manœuvres of the enemy without fear of his darts. But\r\nI must always keep in the forefront of the battle, show myself in the\r\nbreach, and guard against all blows.\r\n\r\nFar from me be any shameful capitulation! May my hand perish rather than\r\nsign any degrading concession!\r\n\r\nI have said it; I say it again, and shall constantly repeat it—\r\n\r\n“To conquer, or die as I have lived. All or nothing!\r\n\r\n                           “M. S.

On the 3rd of July, 1775,\r\nMadame de Chartres gave birth to a second Prince, to whom was given\r\nthe name of Antoine-Philippe, Duc de Montpensier, who died in\r\nEngland on the 18th of May, 1807._\r\n\r\n_In the month of August, 1777, she experienced the joys of a double\r\nmaternity by the birth of girl-twins, of whom one died of the\r\nmeasles when she was four years and a half old; the other, first\r\ncalled Mademoiselle de Chartres, is now known under the title of\r\nMademoiselle d’Orléans._\r\n\r\n_Finally, on October 7th, 1779, she once more became a mother by\r\nthe birth of another Prince, who was named Louis-Charles, Comte de\r\nBeaujolais, and died at Malta in 1808._\r\n\r\n[8] The _Gazetta de Genova_ of March 2, 1825.\r\n\r\n[9] A man of the highest worth, to whom I owe the inestimable\r\nobligation of having, under circumstances I cannot mention,\r\npreserved for me the liberty and the life of my third son.\r\n\r\n[10] The old Count George of that name, having defeated the law in\r\nhis own country, took refuge in France with the abundant fruits of\r\nhis vast depredations. Mr. William Stacpoole pursued him, and the\r\nmere sight of the French Courts of Justice brought about the famous\r\ntransaction that made Cooper cry victory; he having taken the\r\nmodest precaution to get previously from Mr. William the promise of\r\na trifling gratuity of 800,000 francs as a reward for the trouble\r\nhe was going to take in engaging an advocate to plead against Count\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n[11] Needless to say that they were in a pitiable state, and nearly\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n[12] It is known that in 1782, the Duc de Chartres took them out\r\nof the hands of a man to entrust them to this _notorious_ woman,\r\nand that this unprecedented innovation, which was in great part\r\nthe cause of the subsequent differences between the Duke and his\r\nwife, was the occasion of many lampoons and satires. See the _Vie\r\nPolitique de Louis-Philippe d’Orléans_, and other works.\r\n\r\n[13] On the supposition that she had been the young Chiappini’s\r\nfoster-mother, it would be easy to understand why the eldest of her\r\npupils constantly called her “mother,” and why she herself spoke of\r\nhim in so maternal a fashion. See the Journal of that _Prince_ and\r\nseveral other works.\r\n\r\n[14] See Cooper-Driver’s “Answer to Madame la Baronne’s Statement,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[15] It would be truer to say “for the immense trouble he had given\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n[16] If by the title of Duc d’Orléans our correspondent means him\r\nwho alone bore it at that time—that is to say Louis-Philippe, who\r\ndid not die till 1785, we quite agree with him; but, in that case,\r\nwe will ask him to take notice that that is by no means the person\r\nsuspected of having made the exchange. If, on the other hand,\r\nhe has heard speak of Louis-Philippe-Joseph, son of the former,\r\nthen Duc de Chartres, and since so well known under the name of\r\nd’Orléans-Egalité, the sequel of our story must surely make him\r\nrealize that the truth he has traced to its source is not quite so\r\n_true_ a truth as he seems to believe.
