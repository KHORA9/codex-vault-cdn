The addition of the new\r\nmaterial makes necessary the reservation of the orations on the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill, and on the related subjects, for the third volume.\r\n\r\nIn the anti-slavery struggle the Missouri question occupied a prominent\r\nplace. In the voluminous Congressional material which the long\r\ndebates called forth, the speeches of King and Pinkney are the best\r\nrepresentatives of the two sides to the controversy, and they are of\r\nhistorical interest and importance. John Quincy Adams' leadership in\r\nthe dramatic struggle over the right of petition in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and his opinion on the constitutional power of the\r\nnational government over the institution of slavery within the States,\r\nwill always excite the attention of the historical student.\r\n\r\nIn the decade before the war no subject was a greater cause of\r\nirritation and antagonism between the States than the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw. Sumner's speech on this subject is the most valuable of his\r\nspeeches from the historical point of view; and it is not only a worthy\r\nAmerican oration, but it is a valuable contribution to the history of\r\nthe slavery struggle itself. It has been thought desirable to include in\r\na volume of this character orations of permanent value on these themes\r\nof historic interest. A study of the speeches of a radical innovator\r\nlike Phillips with those of compromising conservatives like Webster and\r\nClay, will lead the student into a comparison, or contrast, of these\r\ndiverse characters. The volume retains the two orations of Phillips, the\r\ntwo greatest of all his contributions to the anti-slavery struggle. It\r\nis believed that the list of orations, on the whole, presents to the\r\nreader a series of subjects of first importance in the great slavery\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe valuable introduction of Professor Johnston, on \"The Anti-Slavery\r\nStruggle,\" is re-printed entire.\r\n\r\nJ. A. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. -- THE ANTI-SLAVERY STRUGGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nNegro slavery was introduced into all the English colonies of North\r\nAmerica as a custom, and not under any warrant of law. The enslavement\r\nof the negro race was simply a matter against which no white person\r\nchose to enter a protest, or make resistance, while the negroes\r\nthemselves were powerless to resist or even protest. In due course of\r\ntime laws were passed by the Colonial Assemblies to protect property in\r\nnegroes, while the home government, to the very last, actively protected\r\nand encouraged the slave trade to the colonies. Negro slavery in all\r\nthe colonies had thus passed from custom to law before the American\r\nRevolution broke out; and the course of the Revolution itself had little\r\nor no effect on the system.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, it was evident that the course of slavery in the two\r\nsections, North and South, was to be altogether divergent. In the colder\r\nNorth, the dominant race found it easier to work than to compel negroes\r\nto work: in the warmer South, the case was exactly reversed. At the\r\nclose of the Revolution, Massachusetts led the way in an abolition\r\nof slavery, which was followed gradually by the other States north of\r\nVirginia; and in 1787 the ordinance of Congress organizing the Northwest\r\nTerritory made all the future States north of the Ohio free States.\r\n\"Mason and Dixon's line\" and the Ohio River thus seemed, in 1790, to be\r\nthe natural boundary between the free and the slave States.\r\n\r\nUp to this point the white race in the two sections had dealt with\r\nslavery by methods which were simply divergent, not antagonistic. It was\r\ntrue that the percentage of slaves in the total population had been\r\nvery rapidly decreasing in the North and not in the South, and that the\r\ngradual abolition of slavery was proceeding in the North alone, and that\r\nwith increasing rapidity. But there was no positive evidence that the\r\nSouth was bulwarked in favor of slavery; there was no certainty but that\r\nthe South would in its turn and in due time come to the point which the\r\nNorth had already reached, and begin its own abolition of slavery. The\r\nlanguage of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Henry, and Mason, in regard\r\nto the evils or the wickedness of the system of slavery, was too strong\r\nto be heard with patience in the South of after years; and in this\r\nsection it seems to have been true, that those who thought at all upon\r\nthe subject hoped sincerely for the gradual abolition of slavery in\r\nthe South. The hope, indeed, was rather a sentiment than a purpose, but\r\nthere seems to have been no good reason, before 1793, why the sentiment\r\nshould not finally develop into a purpose.\r\n\r\nAll this was permanently changed, and the slavery policy of the South\r\nwas made antagonistic to, and not merely divergent from, that of the\r\nNorth, by the invention of Whitney's saw gin for cleansing cotton\r\nin 1793. It had been known, before that year, that cotton could be\r\ncultivated in the South, but its cultivation was made unprofitable, and\r\nchecked by the labor required to separate the seeds from the cotton.\r\nWhitney's invention increased the efficiency of this labor hundreds of\r\ntimes, and it became evident at once that the South enjoyed a practical\r\nmonopoly of the production of cotton. The effect on the slavery policy\r\nof the South was immediate and unhappy. Since 1865, it has been found\r\nthat the cotton monopoly of the South is even more complete under a\r\nfree than under a slave labor system, but mere theory could never have\r\nconvinced the Southern people that such would be the case. Their whole\r\nprosperity hinged on one product; they began its cultivation under slave\r\nlabor; and the belief that labor and prosperity were equally dependent\r\non the enslavement of the laboring race very soon made the dominant race\r\nactive defenders of slavery. From that time the system in the South was\r\none of slowly but steadily increasing rigor, until, just before\r\n1860, its last development took the form of legal enactments for the\r\nre-enslavement of free negroes, in default of their leaving the State\r\nin which they resided. Parallel with this increase of rigor, there was a\r\nsteady change in the character of the system. It tended very steadily to\r\nlose its original patriarchal character, and take the aspect of a purely\r\ncommercial speculation. After 1850, the commercial aspect began to be\r\nthe rule in the black belt of the Gulf States. The plantation knew only\r\nthe overseer; so many slaves died to so many bales of cotton; and the\r\nslave population began to lose all human connection with the dominant\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Louisiana in 1803 more than doubled the area of the\r\nUnited States, and far more than doubled the area of the slave system.\r\nSlavery had been introduced into Louisiana, as usual, by custom, and had\r\nthen been sanctioned by Spanish and French law. It is true that Congress\r\ndid not forbid slavery in the new territory of Louisiana; but Congress\r\ndid even worse than this; under the guise of forbidding the importation\r\nof slaves into Louisiana, by the act of March 26, 1804, organizing\r\nthe territory, the phrase \"except by a citizen of the United States,\r\nremoving into said territory for actual settlement, and being at the\r\ntime of such removal bona fide owner of such slave or slaves,\" impliedly\r\nlegitimated the domestic slave trade to Louisiana, and legalized slavery\r\nwherever population should extend between the Mississippi and the\r\nRocky Mountains. The Congress of 1803-05, which passed the act, should\r\nrightfully bear the responsibility for all the subsequent growth of\r\nslavery, and for all the difficulties in which it involved the South and\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThere were but two centres of population in Louisiana, New Orleans and\r\nSt. Louis. When the southern district, around New Orleans, applied for\r\nadmission as the slave State of Louisiana, there seems to have been no\r\nsurprise or opposition on this score; the Federalist opposition to the\r\nadmission is exactly represented by Quincy's speech in the first volume.\r\nWhen the northern district, around St. Louis, applied for admission as\r\nthe slave State of Missouri, the inevitable consequences of the act\r\nof 1804 became evident for the first time, and all the Northern States\r\nunited to resist the admission. The North controlled the House\r\nof Representatives, and the South the Senate; and, after a severe\r\nparliamentary struggle, the two bodies united in the compromise of 1820.\r\nBy its terms Missouri was admitted as a slave State, and slavery was\r\nforever forbidden in the rest of Louisiana Territory, north of latitude\r\n36° 30' (the line of the southerly boundary of Missouri). The instinct\r\nof this first struggle against slavery extension seems to have been\r\nmuch the same as that of 1846-60 the realization that a permission to\r\nintroduce slavery by custom into the Territories meant the formation\r\nof slave States exclusively, the restriction of the free States to\r\nthe district between the Mississippi and the Atlantic, and the final\r\nconversion of the mass of the United States to a policy of enslavement\r\nof labor. But, on the surface, it was so entirely a struggle for the\r\nbalance of power between the two sections, that it has not seemed worth\r\nwhile to introduce any of the few reported speeches of the time. The\r\ntopic is more fully and fairly discussed in the subsequent debates on\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska Act.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 William Lloyd Garrison, a Boston printer, opened the real\r\nanti-slavery struggle. Up to this time the anti-slavery sentiment, North\r\nand South, had been content with the notion of \"gradual abolition,\"\r\nwith the hope that the South would, in some yet unsuspected manner,\r\nbe brought to the Northern policy. This had been supplemented, to some\r\nextent, by the colonization society for colonizing negroes on the west\r\ncoast of Africa; which had two aspects: at the South it was the means of\r\nridding the country of the free negro population; at the North it was a\r\nmeans of mitigating, perhaps of gradually abolishing, slavery. Garrison,\r\nthrough his newspaper, the Liberator, called for \"immediate abolition\"\r\nof slavery, for the conversion of anti-slavery sentiment into\r\nanti-slavery purpose. This was followed by the organization of his\r\nadherents into the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833, and the\r\nactive dissemination of the immediate abolition principle by tracts,\r\nnewspapers, and lecturers.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery struggle thus begun, never ceased until, in 1865, the\r\nLiberator ceased to be published, with the final abolition of slavery.\r\nIn its inception and in all its development the movement was a distinct\r\nproduct of the democratic spirit. It would not have been possible in\r\n1790, or in 1810, or in 1820. The man came with the hour; and every new\r\nmile of railroad or telegraph, every new district open to population,\r\nevery new influence toward the growth of democracy, broadened the\r\npower as well as the field of the abolition movement. It was but the\r\ndeepening, the application to an enslaved race of laborers, of the work\r\nwhich Jeffersonian democracy had done, to remove the infinitely less\r\ngrievous restraints upon the white laborer thirty year before. It could\r\nnever have been begun until individualism at the North had advanced\r\nso far that there was a reserve force of mind--ready to reject all the\r\ninfluences of heredity and custom upon thought. Outside of religion\r\nthere was no force so strong at the North as the reverence for the\r\nConstitution; it was significant of the growth of individualism, as well\r\nas of the anti-slavery sentiment, that Garrison could safely begin his\r\nwork with the declaration that the Constitution itself was \"a league\r\nwith death and a covenant with hell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Garrisonian programme would undoubtedly have been considered highly\r\nobjectionable by the South, even under to comparatively colorless\r\nslavery policy of 1790. Under the conditions to which cotton culture had\r\nadvanced in 1830, it seemed to the South nothing less than a proposal to\r\ndestroy, root and branch, the whole industry of that section, and it was\r\nreceived with corresponding indignation. Garrisonian abolitionists were\r\ntaken and regarded as public enemies, and rewards were even offered for\r\ntheir capture. The germ of abolitionism in the Border States found a new\r\nand aggressive public sentiment arrayed against it; and an attempt\r\nto introduce gradual abolition in Virginia in 1832-33 was hopelessly\r\ndefeated. The new question was even carried into Congress. A bill to\r\nprohibit the transportation of abolition documents by the Post-Office\r\ndepartment was introduced, taken far enough to put leading men of both\r\nparties on the record, and then dropped. Petitions for the abolition\r\nof slavery in the District of Columbia were met by rules requiring the\r\nreference of such petitions without reading or action; but this only\r\nincreased the number of petitions, by providing a new grievance to\r\nbe petitioned against, and in 1842 the \"gag rule\" was rescinded.\r\nThence-forth the pro-slavery members of Congress could do nothing, and\r\ncould only become more exasperated under a system of passive resistance.\r\n\r\nEven at the North, indifferent or politically hostile as it had hitherto\r\nshown itself to the expansion of slavery, the new doctrines were\r\nreceived with an outburst of anger which seems to have been primarily a\r\nrevulsion against their unheard of individualism. If nothing, which\r\nhad been the object of unquestioning popular reverence, from the\r\nConstitution down or up to the church organizations, was to be sacred\r\nagainst the criticism of the Garrisonians, it was certain that the\r\ninnovators must submit for a time to a general proscription. Thus the\r\nGarrisonians were ostracised socially, and became the Ishmalites of\r\npolitics. Their meetings were broken up by mobs, their halls were\r\ndestroyed, their schools were attacked by all the machinery of society\r\nand legislation, their printing presses were silenced by force or fraud,\r\nand their lecturers came to feel that they had not done their work with\r\nefficiency if a meeting passed without the throwing of stones or eggs at\r\nthe building or the orators. It was, of course, inevitable that such\r\na process should bring strong minds to the aid of the Garrisonians,\r\nat first from sympathy with persecuted individualism, and finally from\r\nsympathy with the cause itself; and in this way Garrisonianism was in\r\na great measure relieved from open mob violence about 1840, though\r\nit never escaped it altogether until abolition meetings ceased to\r\nbe necessary. One of the first and greatest reinforcements was the\r\nappearance of Wendell Phillips, whose speech at Faneuil Hall in 1839\r\nwas one of the first tokens of a serious break in the hitherto almost\r\nunanimous public opinion against Garrisonianism. Lovejoy, a Western\r\nanti-slavery preacher and editor, who had been driven from one place to\r\nanother in Missouri and Illinois, had finally settled at Alton, and was\r\nthere shot to death while defending his printing press against a mob. At\r\na public meeting in Faneuil Hall, the Attorney-General of Massachusetts,\r\nJames T. Austin, expressing what was doubtless the general sentiment of\r\nthe time as to such individual insurrection against pronounced public\r\nopinion, compared the Alton mob to the Boston \"tea-party,\" and declared\r\nthat Lovejoy, \"presumptuous and imprudent,\" had \"died as the fool\r\ndieth.\" Phillips, an almost unknown man, took the stand, and answered in\r\nthe speech which opens this volume. A more powerful reinforcement could\r\nhardly have been looked for; the cause which could find such a defender\r\nwas henceforth to be feared rather than despised. To the day of\r\nhis death he was, fully as much as Garrison, the incarnation of the\r\nanti-slavery spirit. For this reason his address on the Philosophy\r\nof the Abolition Movement, in 1853, has been assigned a place as\r\nrepresenting fully the abolition side of the question, just before it\r\nwas overshadowed by the rise of the Republican party, which opposed only\r\nthe extension of slavery to the territories.\r\n\r\nThe history of the sudden development of the anti-slavery struggle in\r\n1847 and the following years, is largely given in the speeches which\r\nhave been selected to illustrate it. The admission of Texas to the Union\r\nin 1845, and the war with Mexico which followed it, resulted in the\r\nacquisition of a vast amount of new territory by the United States.\r\nFrom the first suggestion of such an acquisition, the Wilmot proviso\r\n(so-called from David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, who introduced it in\r\nCongress), that slavery should be prohibited in the new territory, was\r\npersistently offered as an amendment to every bill appropriating money\r\nfor the purchase of territory from Mexico. It was passed by the House\r\nof Representatives, but was balked in the Senate; and the purchase\r\nwas finally made without any proviso. When the territory came to be\r\norganized, the old question came up again: the Wilmot proviso was\r\noffered as an amendment. As the territory was now in the possession of\r\nthe United States, and as it had been acquired in a war whose support\r\nhad been much more cordial at the South than at the North, the attempt\r\nto add the Wilmot proviso to the territorial organization raised the\r\nSouthern opposition to an intensity which it had not known before.\r\nFuel was added to the flame by the application of California, whose\r\npopulation had been enormously increased by the discovery of gold within\r\nher limits, for admission as a free State. If New Mexico should do the\r\nsame, as was probable, the Wilmot proviso would be practically in force\r\nthroughout the best portion of the Mexican acquisition. The two sections\r\nwere now so strong and so determined that compromise of any kind was\r\nfar more difficult than in 1820; and it was not easy to reconcile or\r\ncompromise the southern demand that slavery should be permitted, and\r\nthe northern demand that slavery should be forbidden, to enter the new\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Presidential election of 1848 had come and gone. It\r\nhad been marked by the appearance of a new party, the Free Soilers, an\r\nevent which was at first extremely embarrassing to the managers of\r\nboth the Democratic and Whig parties. On the one hand, the northern and\r\nsouthern sections of the Whig party had always been very loosely joined\r\ntogether, and the slender tie was endangered by the least admission\r\nof the slavery issue. On the other hand, while the Democratic national\r\norganization had always been more perfect, its northern section had\r\nalways been much more inclined to active anti-slavery work than the\r\nnorthern Whigs. Its organ, the Democratic Review, habitually spoke of\r\nthe slaves as \"our black brethren\"; and a long catalogue could be\r\nmade of leaders like Chase, Hale, Wilmot, Bryant, and Leggett, whose\r\ndemocracy was broad enough to include the negro. To both parties,\r\ntherefore, the situation was extremely hazardous. The Whigs had less\r\nto fear, but were able to resist less pressure. The Democrats were more\r\nunited, but were called upon to meet a greater danger. In the end,\r\nthe Whigs did nothing; their two sections drew further apart; and the\r\nPresidential election of 1852 only made it evident that the national\r\nWhig party was no longer in existence. The Democratic managers\r\nevolved, as a solution of their problem, the new doctrine of \"popular\r\nsovereignty,\" which Calhoun re-baptized \"squatter sovereignty.\" They\r\nasserted as the true Democratic doctrine, that the question of slavery\r\nor freedom was to be left for decision of the people of the territory\r\nitself. To the mass of northern Democrats, this doctrine was taking\r\nenough to cover over the essential nature of the struggle; the more\r\ndemocratic leaders of the northern Democracy were driven off into the\r\nFree-Soil party; and Douglas, the champion of \"popular sovereignty,\"\r\nbecame the leading Democrat of the North.\r\n\r\nClay had re-entered the Senate in 1849, for the purpose of compromising\r\nthe sectional difficulties as he had compromised those of 1820 and of\r\n1833. His speech, as given, will show something of his motives; his\r\nsuccess resulted in the \"compromise of 1850.\" By its terms, California\r\nwas admitted as a free State; the slave trade, but not slavery, was\r\nprohibited in the District of Columbia; a more stringent fugitive slave\r\nlaw was enacted; Texas was paid $10,000,000 for certain claims to the\r\nTerritory of New Mexico; and the Territories of Utah and New Mexico,\r\ncovering the Mexican acquisition outside of California, were organized\r\nwithout mentioning slavery. The last-named feature was carefully\r\ndesigned to please all important factions. It could be represented to\r\nthe Webster Whigs that slavery was excluded from the Territories named\r\nby the operation of natural laws; to the Clay Whigs that slavery had\r\nalready been excluded by Mexican law which survived the cession; to the\r\nnorthern Democrats, that the compromise was a formal endorsement of the\r\ngreat principle of popular sovereignty; and to the southern Democrats\r\nthat it was a repudiation of the Wilmot proviso. In the end, the essence\r\nof the success went to the last-named party, for the legislatures of the\r\ntwo territories established slavery, and no bill to veto their action\r\ncould pass both Houses of Congress until after 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court had already decided that Congress had exclusive power\r\nto enforce the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, though the\r\nfugitive slave law of 1793 had given a concurrent authority of execution\r\nto State officers. The law of 1850, carrying the Supreme Court's\r\ndecision further, gave the execution of the law to United States\r\nofficers, and refused the accused a hearing. Its execution at the North\r\nwas therefore the occasion of a profound excitement and horror. Cases\r\nof inhuman cruelty, and of false accusation to which no defence was\r\npermitted, were multiplied until a practical nullification of the law,\r\nin the form of \"personal liberty laws,\" securing a hearing for the\r\naccused before State magistrates, was forced by public opinion upon the\r\nlegislature of the exposed northern States. Before the excitement\r\nhad come to a head, the Whig convention of 1852 met and endorsed the\r\ncompromise of 1850 \"in all its parts.\" Overwhelmed in the election which\r\nfollowed, the Whig party was popularly said to have \"died of an attempt\r\nto swallow the fugitive-slave law\"; it would have been more correct to\r\nhave said that the southern section of the party had deserted in a body\r\nand gone over to the Democratic party. National politics were thus left\r\nin an entirely anomalous condition. The Democratic party was omnipotent\r\nat the South, though it was afterward opposed feebly by the American\r\n(or \"Know Nothing \") organization, and was generally successful at\r\nthe North, though it was still met by the Northern Whigs with vigorous\r\nopposition. Such a state of affairs was not calculated to satisfy\r\nthinking men; and this period seems to have been one in which very\r\nfew thinking men of any party were at all satisfied with their party\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThis was the hazardous situation into which the Democratic managers\r\nchose to thrust one of the most momentous pieces of legislation in our\r\npolitical history-the Kansas-Nebraska bill. The responsibility for it is\r\nclearly on the shoulders of Stephen A. Douglas. The over-land travel to\r\nthe Pacific coast had made it necessary to remove the Indian title to\r\nKansas and Nebraska, and to organize them as Territories, in order to\r\nafford protection to emigrants; and Douglas, chairman of the Senate\r\ncommittee on Territories, introduced a bill for such organization in\r\nJanuary, 1854. Both these prospective Territories had been made free\r\nsoil forever by the compromise of 1820; the question of slavery had been\r\nsettled, so far as they were concerned; but Douglas consented, after a\r\nshow of opposition, to reopen Pandora's box. His original bill did\r\nnot abrogate the Missouri compromise, and there seems to have been no\r\ngeneral Southern demand that it should do so. But Douglas had become\r\nintoxicated by the unexpected success of his \"popular sovereignty\"\r\nmake-shift in regard to the Territories of 1850; and a notice of an\r\namendment to be offered by a southern senator, abrogating the Missouri\r\ncompromise, was threat or excuse sufficient to bring him to withdraw the\r\nbill. A week later, it was re-introduced with the addition of \"popular\r\nsovereignty\": all questions pertaining to slavery in these Territories,\r\nand in the States to be formed from them, were to be left to the\r\ndecision of the people, through their representatives; and the Missouri\r\ncompromise of 1820 was declared \"inoperative and void,\" as inconsistent\r\nwith the principles of the territorial legislation of 1850. It must\r\nbe remembered that the \"non-intervention\" of 1850 had been confessedly\r\nbased on no constitutional principle whatever, but was purely a matter\r\nof expediency; and that \"non-intervention\" in Utah and New Mexico was no\r\nmore inconsistent with the prohibition of slavery in Kansas and Nebraska\r\nthan \"non-intervention\" in the Southwest Territory, sixty years before,\r\nhad been inconsistent with the prohibition of slavery in the Northwest\r\nTerritory. Whether Douglas is to be considered as too scrupulous, or too\r\ntimid, or too willing to be terrified, it is certain that his action was\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nAfter a struggle of some months, the Kansas-Nebraska bill became law.\r\nThe Missouri compromise was abrogated, and the question of the extension\r\nof slavery to the territories was adrift again, never to be got rid of\r\nexcept through the abolition of slavery itself by war. The demands of\r\nthe South had now come fully abreast with the proposal of Douglas:\r\nthat slavery should have permission to enter all the Territories, if\r\nit could. The opponents of the extension of slavery, at first under the\r\nname of \"Anti-Nebraska men,\" then of the Republican party, carried the\r\nelections for representatives in Congress in 1854-'55, and narrowly\r\nmissed carrying the Presidential election of 1856. The percentage\r\nof Democratic losses in the congressional districts of the North was\r\nsufficient to leave Douglas with hardly any supporters in Congress from\r\nhis own section. The Democratic party was converted at once into a\r\nsolid South, with a northern attachment of popular votes which was not\r\nsufficient to control very many Congressmen or electoral votes.\r\n\r\nImmigration into Kansas was organized at once by leading men of the two\r\nsections, with the common design of securing a majority of the voters of\r\nthe territory and applying \"popular sovereignty\" for or against slavery.\r\nThe first sudden inroad of Missouri intruders was successful in securing\r\na pro-slavery legislature and laws; but within two years the stream\r\nof free-State immigration had become so powerful,in spite of murder,\r\noutrage, and open civil war, that it was very evident that Kansas was\r\nto be a free-State. Its expiring territorial legislature endeavored\r\nto outwit its constituents by applying for admission as a slave State,\r\nunder the Lecompton constitution; but the Douglas Democrats could not\r\nsupport the attempt, and it was defeated. Kansas, however, remained a\r\nterritory until 1861.\r\n\r\nThe cruelties of this Kansas episode could not but be reflected in the\r\nfeelings of the two sections and in Congress. In the former it showed\r\ntoo plainly that the divergence of the two sections, indicated in\r\nCalhoun's speech of 1850, had widened to an absolute separation in\r\nthought, feeling, and purpose. In the latter the debates assumed a\r\nvirulence which is illustrated by the speeches on the Sumner assault.\r\nThe current of events had at least carried the sections far enough apart\r\nto give striking distance; and the excuse for action was supplied by the\r\nDred Scott decision in 1857.\r\n\r\nDred Scott, a Missouri slave, claiming to be a free man under the\r\nMissouri compromise of 1820, had sued his master, and the case had\r\nreached the Supreme Court. A majority of the justices agreed in\r\ndismissing the suit; but, as nearly every justice filed an opinion, and\r\nas nearly every opinion disagreed with the other opinions on one or\r\nmore points, it is not easy to see what else is covered by the decision.\r\nNevertheless, the opinion of the Chief justice, Roger B. Taney,\r\nattracted general attention by the strength of its argument and the\r\ncharacter of its views. It asserted, in brief, that no slave could\r\nbecome a citizen of the United States, even by enfranchisement or State\r\nlaw; that the prohibition of slavery by the Missouri compromise of 1820\r\nwas unconstitutional and void; that the Constitution recognized property\r\nin slaves, and was framed for the protection of property; that Congress\r\nhad no rights or duties in the territories but such as were granted or\r\nimposed by the Constitution; and that, therefore, Congress was bound\r\nnot merely not to forbid slavery, but to actively protect slavery in\r\nthe Territories. This was just the ground which had always been held by\r\nCalhoun, though the South had not supported him in it. Now the South,\r\nrejecting Douglas and his \"popular sovereignty,\" was united in its\r\ndevotion to the decision of the Supreme Court, and called upon the North\r\nto yield unhesitating obedience to that body which Webster in 1830 had\r\nstyled the ultimate arbiter of constitutional questions. This, it was\r\nevident, could never be. No respectable authority at the North pretended\r\nto uphold the keystone of Taney's argument, that slaves were regarded as\r\nproperty by the Constitution. On the contrary, it was agreed everywhere\r\nby those whose opinions were looked to with respect, that slaves were\r\nregarded by the Constitution as \"persons held to service or labor\" under\r\nthe laws of the State alone; and that the laws of the State could not\r\ngive such persons a fictitious legal character outside of the State's\r\njurisdiction. Even the Douglas Democrats, who expressed a willingness to\r\nyield to the Supreme Court's decision, did not profess to uphold Taney's\r\nshare in it.\r\n\r\nAs the Presidential election of 1860 drew near, the evidences of\r\nseparation became more manifest. The absorption of northern Democrats\r\ninto the Republican party increased until Douglas, in 1858, narrowly\r\nescaped defeat in his contest with Lincoln for a re-election to the\r\nSenate from Illinois. In 1860 the Republicans nominated Lincoln for\r\nthe Presidency on a platform demanding prohibition of slavery in\r\nthe Territories. The southern delegates seceded from the Democratic\r\nconvention, and nominated Breckenridge, on a platform demanding\r\ncongressional protection of slavery in the Territories. The remainder of\r\nthe Democratic convention nominated Douglas, with a declaration of its\r\nwillingness to submit to the decision of the Supreme Court on questions\r\nof constitutional law. The remnants of the former Whig and American\r\nparties, under the name of the Constitutional Union party, nominated\r\nBell without any declaration of principles. Lincoln received a majority\r\nof the electoral votes, and became President. His popular vote was a\r\nplurality.\r\n\r\nSeward's address on the \"Irrepressible Conflict,\" which closes this\r\nvolume, is representative of the division between the two sections, as\r\nit stood just before the actual shock of conflict. Labor systems are\r\ndelicate things; and that which the South had adopted, of enslaving the\r\nlaboring class, was one whose influence could not help being universal\r\nand aggressive. Every form of energy and prosperity which tended to\r\nadvance a citizen into the class of representative rulers tended also to\r\nmake him a slave owner, and to shackle his official policy and purposes\r\nwith considerations inseparable from his heavy personal interests. Men\r\nmight divide on other questions at the South; but on this question of\r\nslavery the action of the individual had to follow the decisions of a\r\nmajority which, by the influence of ambitious aspirants for the lead,\r\nwas continually becoming more aggressive. In constitutional countries,\r\ndefections to the minority are a steady check upon an aggressive\r\nmajority; but the southern majority was a steam engine without a safety\r\nvalve.\r\n\r\nIn this sense Seward and Lincoln, in 1858, were correct; the labor\r\nsystem of the South was not only a menace to the whole country, but one\r\nwhich could neither decrease nor stand still. It was intolerable by\r\nthe laws of its being; and it could be got rid of only by allowing\r\na peaceable secession, or by abolishing it through war. The material\r\nprosperity which has followed the adoption of the latter alternative,\r\napart from the moral aspects of the case, is enough to show that the\r\nSouth has gained more than all that slavery lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rufus King]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUFUS KING,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK. (BORN 1755, DIED 1827.)\r\n\r\nON THE MISSOURI BILL--UNITED STATES SENATE,\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 11 AND 14, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares \"that Congress shall have power to dispose of,\r\nand make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory and\r\nother property of the United States.\" Under this power Congress have\r\npassed laws for the survey and sale of the public lands; for the\r\ndivision of the same into separate territories; and have ordained for\r\neach of them a constitution, a plan of temporary government, whereby\r\nthe civil and political rights of the inhabitants are regulated, and the\r\nrights of conscience and other natural rights are protected.\r\n\r\nThe power to make all needful regulations, includes the power to\r\ndetermine what regulations are needful; and if a regulation prohibiting\r\nslavery within any territory of the United States be, as it has been,\r\ndeemed needful, Congress possess the power to make the same, and,\r\nmoreover, to pass all laws necessary to carry this power into execution.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Missouri is a portion of Louisiana, which was purchased\r\nof France, and belongs to the United States in full dominion; in the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution, Missouri is their territory or property,\r\nand is subject like other territories of the United States, to the\r\nregulations and temporary government, which has been, or shall be\r\nprescribed by Congress. The clause of the Constitution which grants this\r\npower to Congress, is so comprehensive and unambiguous, and its purpose\r\nso manifest, that commentary will not render the power, or the object of\r\nits establishment, more explicit or plain.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution further provides that \"new States may be admitted\r\nby Congress into this Union.\" As this power is conferred without\r\nlimitation, the time, terms, and circumstances of the admission of new\r\nStates, are referred to the discretion of Congress; which may admit new\r\nStates, but are not obliged to do so--of right no new State can demand\r\nadmission into the Union, unless such demand be founded upon some\r\nprevious engagement of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen admitted by Congress into the Union, whether by compact or\r\notherwise, the new State becomes entitled to the enjoyment of the same\r\nrights, and bound to perform the like duties as the other States;\r\nand its citizens will be entitled to all privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of each State possess rights, and owe duties that are\r\npeculiar to, and arise out of the Constitution and laws of the several\r\nStates. These rights and duties differ from each other in the different\r\nStates, and among these differences none is so remarkable or important\r\nas that which proceeds from the Constitution and laws of the several\r\nStates respecting slavery; the same being permitted in some States and\r\nforbidden in others.\r\n\r\nThe question respecting slavery in the old thirteen States had been\r\ndecided and settled before the adoption of the Constitution, which\r\ngrants no power to Congress to interfere with, or to change what had\r\nbeen so previously settled. The slave States, therefore, are free\r\nto continue or to abolish slavery. Since the year 1808 Congress have\r\npossessed power to prohibit and have prohibited the further migration\r\nor importation of slaves into any of the old thirteen States, and at all\r\ntimes, under the Constitution, have had power to prohibit such migration\r\nor importation into any of the new States or territories of the United\r\nStates. The Constitution contains no express provision respecting\r\nslavery in a new State that may be admitted into the Union; every\r\nregulation upon this subject belongs to the power whose consent is\r\nnecessary to the formation and admission of new States into the Union.\r\nCongress may, therefore, make it a condition of the admission of a new\r\nState, that slavery shall be forever prohibited within the same. We may,\r\nwith the more confidence, pronounce this to be the true construction\r\nof the Constitution, as it has been so amply confirmed by the past\r\ndecisions of Congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough the articles of confederation were drawn up and approved by\r\nthe old Congress, in the year 1777, and soon afterwards were ratified by\r\nsome of the States, their complete ratification did not take place until\r\nthe year 1781. The States which possessed small and already settled\r\nterritory, withheld their ratification, in order to obtain from the\r\nlarge States a cession to the United States of a portion of their vacant\r\nterritory. Without entering into the reasons on which this demand was\r\nurged, it is well known that they had an influence on Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New York, and Virginia, which States ceded to the United\r\nStates their respective claims to the territory lying northwest of the\r\nriver Ohio. This cession was made on the express condition, that the\r\nceded territory should be sold for the common benefit of the United\r\nStates; that it should be laid out into States, and that the States\r\nso laid out should form distinct republican States, and be admitted as\r\nmembers of the Federal Union, having the same rights of sovereignty,\r\nfreedom, and independence as the other States. Of the four States which\r\nmade this cession, two permitted, and the other two prohibited slavery.\r\n\r\nThe United States having in this manner become proprietors of\r\nthe extensive territory northwest of the river Ohio, although the\r\nconfederation contained no express provision upon the subject, Congress,\r\nthe only representatives of the United States, assumed as incident\r\nto their office, the power to dispose of this territory; and for this\r\npurpose, to divide the same into distinct States, to provide for the\r\ntemporary government of the inhabitants thereof, and for their ultimate\r\nadmission as new States into the Federal Union.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance for those purposes, which was passed by Congress in 1787,\r\ncontains certain articles, which are called \"Articles of compact between\r\nthe original States and the people and States within the said territory,\r\nfor ever to remain unalterable, unless by common consent.\" The sixth\r\nof those unalterable articles provides, \"that there shall be neither\r\nslavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States supplies the defect that existed\r\nin the articles of confederation, and has vested Congress, as has been\r\nstated, with ample powers on this important subject. Accordingly,\r\nthe ordinance of 1787, passed by the old Congress, was ratified and\r\nconfirmed by an act of the new Congress during their first session under\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe State of Virginia, which ceded to the United States her claims to\r\nthis territory, consented by her delegates in the old Congress to this\r\nordinance--not only Virginia, but North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, by the unanimous votes of their delegates in the old Congress,\r\napproved of the ordinance of 1787, by which slavery is forever abolished\r\nin the territory northwest of the river Ohio.\r\n\r\nWithout the votes of these States, the ordinance could not have passed;\r\nand there is no recollection of an opposition from any of these States\r\nto the act of confirmation, passed under the actual Constitution.\r\nSlavery had long been established in these States--the evil was felt in\r\ntheir institutions, laws, and habits, and could not easily or at once be\r\nabolished. But these votes so honorable to these States, satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrate their unwillingness to permit the extension of slavery into\r\nthe new States which might be admitted by Congress into the Union.\r\n\r\nThe States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, on the northwest of the river\r\nOhio, have been admitted by Congress into the Union, on the condition\r\nand conformably to the article of compact, contained in the ordinance\r\nof 1787, and by which it is declared that there shall be neither slavery\r\nnor involuntary servitude in any of the said States.\r\n\r\nAlthough Congress possess the power of making the exclusion of slavery a\r\npart or condition of the act admitting a new State into the Union, they\r\nmay, in special cases, and for sufficient reasons, forbear to exercise\r\nthis power. Thus Kentucky and Vermont were admitted as new States into\r\nthe Union, without making the abolition of slavery the condition of\r\ntheir admission. In Vermont, slavery never existed; her laws excluding\r\nthe same. Kentucky was formed out of, and settled by, Virginia, and\r\nthe inhabitants of Kentucky, equally with those of Virginia, by\r\nfair interpretation of the Constitution, were exempt from all such\r\ninterference of Congress, as might disturb or impair the security of\r\ntheir property in slaves. The western territory of North Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, having been partially granted and settled under the authority\r\nof these States, before the cession thereof to the United States, and\r\nthese States being original parties to the Constitution which recognizes\r\nthe existence of slavery, no measure restraining slavery could be\r\napplied by Congress to this territory. But to remove all doubt on this\r\nhead, it was made a condition of the cession of this territory to the\r\nUnited States, that the ordinance of 1787, except the sixth article\r\nthereof, respecting slavery, should be applied to the same; and that\r\nthe sixth article should not be so applied. Accordingly, the States of\r\nTennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, comprehending the territory ceded\r\nto the United States by North Carolina and Georgia, have been admitted\r\nas new States into the Union, without a provision, by which slavery\r\nshall be excluded from the same. According to this abstract of the\r\nproceedings of Congress in the admission of new States into the Union,\r\nof the eight new States within the original limits of the United States,\r\nfour have been admitted without an article excluding slavery; three have\r\nbeen admitted on the condition that slavery should be excluded; and one\r\nadmitted without such condition. In the few first cases, Congress were\r\nrestrained from exercising the power to exclude slavery; in the next\r\nthree, they exercised this power; and in the last, it was unnecessary to\r\ndo so, slavery being excluded by the State Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe province of Louisiana, soon after its cession to the United States,\r\nwas divided into two territories, comprehending such parts thereof as\r\nwere contiguous to the river Mississippi, being the only parts of the\r\nprovince that were inhabited. The foreign language, laws, customs,\r\nand manners of the inhabitants, required the immediate and cautious\r\nattention of Congress, which, instead of extending, in the first\r\ninstance, to these territories the ordinance of 1787, ordained special\r\nregulations for the government of the same. These regulations were from\r\ntime to time revised and altered, as observation and experience showed\r\nto be expedient, and as was deemed most likely to encourage and\r\npromote those changes which would soonest qualify the inhabitants for\r\nself-government and admission into the Union. When the United States\r\ntook possession of the province of Louisiana in 1804, it was estimated\r\nto contain 50,000 white inhabitants, 40,000 slaves, and 2,000 free\r\npersons of color.\r\n\r\nMore than four-fifths of the whites, and all the slaves, except about\r\nthirteen hundred, inhabited New Orleans and the adjacent territory; the\r\nresidue, consisting of less than ten thousand whites, and about thirteen\r\nhundred slaves, were dispersed throughout the country now included in\r\nthe Arkansas and Missouri territories. The greater part of the thirteen\r\nhundred slaves were in the Missouri territory, some of them having been\r\nremoved thither from the old French settlements on the east side of\r\nthe Mississippi, after the passing of the ordinance of 1787, by which\r\nslavery in those settlements was abolished.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, the territory of New Orleans, to which the ordinance of\r\n1787, with the exception of certain parts thereof, had been previously\r\nextended, was permitted by Congress to form a Constitution and State\r\nGovernment, and admitted as a new State into the Union, by the name\r\nof Louisiana. The acts of Congress for these purposes, in addition to\r\nsundry important provisions respecting rivers and public lands, which\r\nare declared to be irrevocable unless by common consent, annex other\r\nterms and conditions, whereby it is established, not only that the\r\nConstitution of Louisiana should be republican, but that it should\r\ncontain the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty,\r\nthat it should secure to the citizens the trial by jury in all criminal\r\ncases, and the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus according to the\r\nConstitution of the United States; and after its admission into the\r\nUnion, that the laws which Louisiana might pass, should be promulgated;\r\nits records of every description preserved; and its judicial and\r\nlegislative proceedings conducted in the language in which the laws and\r\njudicial proceedings of the United States are published and conducted.\r\n\r\n     *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nHaving annexed these new and extraordinary conditions to the act for the\r\nadmission of Louisiana into the Union, Congress may, if they shall deem\r\nit expedient, annex the like conditions to the act for the admission of\r\nMissouri; and, moreover, as in the case of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,\r\nprovide by an article for that purpose, that slavery shall not exist\r\nwithin the same.\r\n\r\nAdmitting this construction of the Constitution, it is alleged that the\r\npower by which Congress excluded slavery from the States north-west of\r\nthe river Ohio, is suspended in respect to the States that may be formed\r\nin the province of Louisiana. The article of the treaty referred to\r\ndeclares: \"That the inhabitants of the territory shall be incorporated\r\nin the Union of the United States, and admitted as soon as possible;\r\naccording to the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the\r\nenjoyment of all rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of\r\nthe United States; and in the meantime, they shall be maintained and\r\nprotected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the\r\nreligion which they profess.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there is want of precision in the article, its scope and\r\nmeaning can not be misunderstood. It constitutes a stipulation by which\r\nthe United States engage that the inhabitants of Louisiana should be\r\nformed into a State or States, and as soon as the provisions of the\r\nConstitution permit, that they should be admitted as new States into the\r\nUnion on the footing of the other States; and before such admission, and\r\nduring their territorial government, that they should be maintained and\r\nprotected by Congress in the enjoyment of their liberty, property, and\r\nreligion. The first clause of this stipulation will be executed by the\r\nadmission of Missouri as a new State into the Union, as such admission\r\nwill impart to the inhabitants of Missouri \"all the rights, advantages,\r\nand immunities\" which citizens of the United States derive from the\r\nConstitution thereof; these rights may be denominated Federal rights,\r\nare uniform throughout the Union, and are common to all its citizens:\r\nbut the rights derived from the Constitution and laws of the States,\r\nwhich may be denominated State rights, in many particulars differ\r\nfrom each other. Thus, while the Federal rights of the citizens\r\nof Massachusetts and Virginia are the same, their State rights are\r\ndissimilar and different, slavery being forbidden in one, and permitted\r\nin the other State. This difference arises out of the Constitutions\r\nand laws of the two States, in the same manner as the difference in the\r\nrights of the citizens of these States to vote for representatives\r\nin Congress arises out of the State laws and Constitution. In\r\nMassachusetts, every person of lawful age, and possessing property\r\nof any sort, of the value of two hundred dollars, may vote for\r\nrepresentatives to Congress. In Virginia, no person can vote for\r\nrepresentatives to Congress, unless he be a freeholder. As the admission\r\nof a new State into the Union confers upon its citizens only the rights\r\ndenominated Federal, and as these are common to the citizens of all the\r\nStates, as well of those in which slavery is prohibited, as of those\r\nin which it is allowed, it follows that the prohibition of slavery in\r\nMissouri will not impair the Federal rights of its citizens, and that\r\nsuch prohibition is not sustained by the clause of the treaty which has\r\nbeen cited.\r\n\r\nAs all nations do not permit slavery, the term property, in its common\r\nand universal meaning, does not include or describe slaves. In treaties,\r\ntherefore, between nations, and especially in those of the United\r\nStates, whenever stipulations respecting slaves were to be made, the\r\nword \"negroes,\" or \"slaves,\" have been employed, and the omission of\r\nthese words in this clause, increases the uncertainty whether, by the\r\nterm property, slaves were intended to be included. But admitting that\r\nsuch was the intention of the parties, the stipulation is not only\r\ntemporary, but extends no further than to the property actually\r\npossessed by the inhabitants of Missouri, when it was first occupied\r\nby the United States. Property since acquired by them, and property\r\nacquired or possessed by the new inhabitants of Missouri, has in each\r\ncase been acquired under the laws of the United States, and not during\r\nand under the laws of the province of Louisiana. Should, therefore, the\r\nfuture introduction of slaves into Missouri be forbidden, the feelings\r\nof the citizens would soon become reconciled to their exclusion, and the\r\ninconsiderable number of slaves owned by the inhabitants at the date\r\nof the cession of Louisiana, would be emancipated or sent for sale into\r\nStates where slavery exists.\r\n\r\nIt is further objected, that the article of the act of admission into\r\nthe Union, by which slavery should be excluded from Missouri, would\r\nbe nugatory, as the new State in virtue of its sovereignty would be at\r\nliberty to revoke its consent, and annul the article by which slavery is\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nSuch revocation would be contrary to the obligations of good faith,\r\nwhich enjoins the observance of our engagements; it would be repugnant\r\nto the principles on which government itself is founded; sovereignty in\r\nevery lawful government is a limited power, and can do only what it\r\nis lawful to do. Sovereigns, like individuals, are bound by their\r\nengagements, and have no moral power to break them. Treaties between\r\nnations repose on this principle. If the new State can revoke and annul\r\nan article concluded between itself and the United States, by which\r\nslavery is excluded from it, it may revoke and annul any other article\r\nof the compact; it may, for example, annul the article respecting public\r\nlands, and in virtue of its sovereignty, assume the right to tax and to\r\nsell the lands of the United States. There is yet a more satisfactory\r\nanswer to this objection. The judicial power of the United States is\r\nco-extensive with their legislative power, and every question arising\r\nunder the Constitution or laws of the United States, is recognizable by\r\nthe judiciary thereof. Should the new State rescind any of the articles\r\nof compact contained in the act of admission into the Union, that, for\r\nexample, by which slavery is excluded, and should pass a law authorizing\r\nslavery, the judiciary of the United States on proper application, would\r\nimmediately deliver from bondage, any person retained as a slave in said\r\nState. And, in like manner, in all instances affecting individuals,\r\nthe judiciary might be employed to defeat every attempt to violate the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf Congress possess the power to exclude slavery from Missouri, it still\r\nremains to be shown that they ought to do so. The examination of this\r\nbranch of the subject, for obvious reasons, is attended with peculiar\r\ndifficulty, and cannot be made without passing over arguments which, to\r\nsome of us, might appear to be decisive, but the use of which, in this\r\nplace, would call up feelings, the influence of which would disturb, if\r\nnot defeat, the impartial consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nSlavery, unhappily, exists within the United States. Enlightened men, in\r\nthe States where it is permitted, and everywhere out of them, regret its\r\nexistence among us, and seek for the means of limiting and of mitigating\r\nit. The first introduction of slaves is not imputable to the present\r\ngeneration, nor even to their ancestors. Before the year 1642, the trade\r\nand ports of the colonies were open to foreigners equally as those of\r\nthe mother country; and as early as 1620, a few years only after the\r\nplanting of the colony of Virginia, and the same year in which the first\r\nsettlement was made in the old colony of Plymouth, a cargo of negroes\r\nwas brought into and sold as slaves in Virginia by a foreign ship. From\r\nthis beginning, the importation of slaves was continued for nearly\r\ntwo centuries. To her honor, Virginia, while a colony, opposed the\r\nimportation of slaves, and was the first State to prohibit the same, by\r\na law passed for this purpose in 1778, thirty years before the general\r\nprohibition enacted by Congress in 1808. The laws and customs of the\r\nStates in which slavery has existed for so long a period, must have had\r\ntheir influence on the opinions and habits of the citizens, which ought\r\nnot to be disregarded on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen the general convention that formed the Constitution took this\r\nsubject into their consideration, the whole question was once more\r\nexamined; and while it was agreed that all contributions to the common\r\ntreasury should be made according to the ability of the several States\r\nto furnish the same, the old difficulty recurred in agreeing upon a\r\nrule whereby such ability should be ascertained, there being no simple\r\nstandard by which the ability of individuals to pay taxes can be\r\nascertained. A diversity in the selection of taxes has been deemed\r\nrequisite to their equalization. Between communities this difficulty is\r\nless considerable, and although the rule of relative numbers would not\r\naccurately measure the relative wealth of nations, in States in the\r\ncircumstances of the United States, whose institutions, laws, and\r\nemployments are so much alike, the rule of numbers is probably as near\r\nequal as any other simple and practical rule can be expected to be\r\n(though between the old and new States its equity is defective),--these\r\nconsiderations, added to the approbation which had already been given to\r\nthe rule, by a majority of the States, induced the convention to agree\r\nthat direct taxes should be apportioned among the States, according to\r\nthe whole number of free persons, and three-fifths of the slaves which\r\nthey might respectively contain.\r\n\r\nThe rule for apportionment of taxes is not necessarily the most\r\nequitable rule for the apportionment of representatives among the\r\nStates; property must not be disregarded in the composition of the first\r\nrule, but frequently is overlooked in the establishment of the second.\r\nA rule which might be approved in respect to taxes, would be disapproved\r\nin respect to representatives; one individual possessing twice as much\r\nproperty as another, might be required to pay double the taxes of such\r\nother; but no man has two votes to another's one; rich or poor, each has\r\nbut a single vote in the choice of representatives.\r\n\r\nIn the dispute between England and the colonies, the latter denied the\r\nright of the former to tax them, because they were not represented in\r\nthe English Parliament. They contended that, according to the law of the\r\nland, taxation and representation were inseparable. The rule of taxation\r\nbeing agreed upon by the convention, it is possible that the maxim\r\nwith which we successfully opposed the claim of England may have had\r\nan influence in procuring the adoption of the same rule for the\r\napportionment of representatives; the true meaning, however, of this\r\nprinciple of the English constitution is, that a colony or district\r\nis not to be taxed which is not represented; not that its number\r\nof representatives shall be ascertained by its quota of taxes. If\r\nthree-fifths of the slaves are virtually represented, or their owners\r\nobtain a disproportionate power in legislation, and in the appointment\r\nof the President of the United States, why should not other property\r\nbe virtually represented, and its owners obtain a like power in\r\nlegislation, and in the choice of the President? Property is not\r\nconfined in slaves, but exists in houses, stores, ships, capital in\r\ntrade, and manufactures. To secure to the owners of property in slaves\r\ngreater political power than is allowed to the owners of other and\r\nequivalent property, seems to be contrary to our theory of the equality\r\nof personal rights, inasmuch as the citizens of some States thereby\r\nbecome entitled to other and greater political power than the citizens\r\nof other States. The present House of Representatives consist of one\r\nhundred and eighty-one members, which are apportioned among the States\r\nin a ratio of one representative for every thirty-five thousand federal\r\nmembers, which are ascertained by adding to the whole number of free\r\npersons, three-fifths of the slaves. According to the last census, the\r\nwhole number of slaves within the United was 1,191,364, which entitles\r\nthe States possessing the same to twenty representatives, and twenty\r\npresidential electors more than they would be entitled to, were the\r\nslaves excluded. By the last census, Virginia contained 582,104 free\r\npersons, and 392,518 slaves. In any of the States where slavery is\r\nexcluded, 582,104 free persons would be entitled to elect only sixteen\r\nrepresentatives, while in Virginia, 582,104 free persons, by the\r\naddition of three-fifths of her slaves, become entitled to elect, and do\r\nin fact elect, twenty-three representatives, being seven additional ones\r\non account of her slaves. Thus, while 35,000 free persons are requisite\r\nto elect one representative in a State where slavery is prohibited,\r\n25,559 free persons in Virginia may and do elect a representative: so\r\nthat five free persons in Virginia have as much power in the choice\r\nof Representatives to Congress, and in the appointment of presidential\r\nelectors, as seven free persons in any of the States in which slavery\r\ndoes not exist.\r\n\r\nThis inequality in the apportionment of representatives was not\r\nmisunderstood at the adoption of the Constitution, but no one\r\nanticipated the fact that the whole of the revenue of the United States\r\nwould be derived from indirect taxes (which cannot be supposed to\r\nspread themselves over the several States according to the rule for the\r\napportionment of direct taxes), but it was believed that a part of\r\nthe contribution to the common treasury would be apportioned among the\r\nStates by the rule for the apportionment of representatives. The States\r\nin which slavery is prohibited, ultimately, though with reluctance,\r\nacquiesced in the disproportionate number of representatives and\r\nelectors that was secured to the slaveholding States. The concession\r\nwas, at the time, believed to be a great one, and has proved to\r\nhave been the greatest which was made to secure the adoption of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as this concession was, it was definite, and its full\r\nextent was comprehended. It was a settlement between the original\r\nthirteen States. The considerations arising out of their actual\r\ncondition, their past connection, and the obligation which all felt to\r\npromote a reformation in the Federal Government, were peculiar to the\r\ntime and to the parties, and are not applicable to the new States, which\r\nCongress may now be willing to admit into the Union.\r\n\r\nThe equality of rights, which includes an equality of burdens, is\r\na vital principle in our theory of government, and its jealous\r\npreservation is the best security of public and individual freedom;\r\nthe departure from this principle in the disproportionate power and\r\ninfluence, allowed to the slaveholding States, was a necessary sacrifice\r\nto the establishment of the Constitution. The effect of this concession\r\nhas been obvious in the preponderance which it has given to the\r\nslaveholding States over the other States. Nevertheless, it is an\r\nancient settlement, and faith and honor stand pledged not to disturb it.\r\nBut the extension of this disproportionate power to the new States would\r\nbe unjust and odious. The States whose power would be abridged, and\r\nwhose burdens would be increased by the measure, cannot be expected to\r\nconsent to it, and we may hope that the other States are too magnanimous\r\nto insist on it.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be forgotten that the first and main object of the\r\nnegotiation which led to the acquisition of Louisiana, was the free\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, a river that forms the sole passage from\r\nthe western States to the ocean. This navigation, although of general\r\nbenefit, has been always valued and desired, as of peculiar advantage\r\nto the Western States, whose demands to obtain it were neither equivocal\r\nnor unreasonable. But with the river Mississippi, by a sort of coercion,\r\nwe acquired, by good or ill fortune, as our future measures shall\r\ndetermine, the whole province of Louisiana. As this acquisition was made\r\nat the common expense, it is very fairly urged that the advantages to be\r\nderived from it should also be common. This, it is said, will not happen\r\nif slavery be excluded from Missouri, as the citizens of the States\r\nwhere slavery is permitted will be shut out, and none but citizens of\r\nStates where slavery is prohibited, can become inhabitants of Missouri.\r\n\r\nBut this consequence will not arise from the proposed exclusion of\r\nslavery. The citizens of States in which slavery is allowed, like all\r\nother citizens, will be free to become inhabitants of Missouri, in like\r\nmanner as they have become inhabitants of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,\r\nin which slavery is forbidden. The exclusion of slaves from Missouri\r\nwill not, therefore, operate unequally among the citizens of the United\r\nStates. The Constitution provides, \"that the citizens of each State\r\nshall be entitled to enjoy all the rights and immunities of citizens of\r\nthe several States\"; every citizen may, therefore, remove from one\r\nto another State, and there enjoy the rights and immunities of its\r\ncitizens. The proposed provision excludes slaves, not citizens, whose\r\nrights it will not, and cannot impair.\r\n\r\nBesides there is nothing new or peculiar in a provision for the\r\nexclusion of slavery; it has been established in the States north-west\r\nof the river Ohio, and has existed from the beginning in the old States\r\nwhere slavery is forbidden. The citizens of States where slavery is\r\nallowed, may become inhabitants of Missouri, but cannot hold slaves\r\nthere, nor in any other State where slavery is prohibited. As well might\r\nthe laws prohibiting slavery in the old States become the subject of\r\ncomplaint, as the proposed exclusion of slavery in Missouri; but there\r\nis no foundation for such complaint in either case. It is further urged,\r\nthat the admission of slaves into Missouri would be limited to the\r\nslaves who are already within the United States; that their health and\r\ncomfort would be promoted by their dispersion, and that their numbers\r\nwould be the same whether they remain confined to the States where\r\nslavery exists, or are dispersed over the new States that may be\r\nadmitted into the Union.\r\n\r\nThat none but domestic slaves would be introduced into Missouri, and the\r\nother new and frontier States, is most fully disproved by the thousands\r\nof fresh slaves, which, in violation of our laws, are annually imported\r\ninto Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWe may renew our efforts, and enact new laws with heavier penalties\r\nagainst the importation of slaves: the revenue cutters may more\r\ndiligently watch our shores, and the naval force may be employed on\r\nthe coast of Africa, and on the ocean, to break up the slave trade--but\r\nthese means will not put an end to it; so long as markets are open for\r\nthe purchase of slaves, so long they will be supplied;--and so long as\r\nwe permit the existence of slavery in our new and frontier States,\r\nso long slave markets will exist. The plea of humanity is equally\r\ninadmissible, since no one who has ever witnessed the experiment will\r\nbelieve that the condition of slaves is made better by the breaking\r\nup, and separation of their families, nor by their removal from the old\r\nStates to the new ones; and the objection to the provision of the bill,\r\nexcluding slavery from Missouri, is equally applicable to the like\r\nprohibitions of the old States: these should be revoked, in order that\r\nthe slaves now confined to certain States, may, for their health and\r\ncomfort, and multiplication, be spread over the whole Union.\r\n\r\nSlavery cannot exist in Missouri without the consent of Congress; the\r\nquestion may therefore be considered, in certain lights, as a new one,\r\nit being the first instance in which an inquiry respecting slavery, in a\r\ncase so free from the influence of the ancient laws, usages, and manners\r\nof the country, has come before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Missouri is beyond our ancient limits, and the inquiry\r\nwhether slavery shall exist there, is open to many of the arguments that\r\nmight be employed, had slavery never existed within the United States.\r\nIt is a question of no ordinary importance. Freedom and slavery are the\r\nparties which stand this day before the Senate; and upon its decision\r\nthe empire of the one or the other will be established in the new State\r\nwhich we are about to admit into the Union.\r\n\r\nIf slavery be permitted in Missouri with the climate, and soil, and in\r\nthe circumstances of this territory, what hope can be entertained that\r\nit will ever be prohibited in any of the new States that will be formed\r\nin the immense region west of the Mississippi? Will the co-extensive\r\nestablishment of slavery and of the new States throughout this region,\r\nlessen the dangers of domestic insurrection, or of foreign aggression?\r\nWill this manner of executing the great trust of admitting new States\r\ninto the Union, contribute to assimilate our manners and usages, to\r\nincrease our mutual affection and confidence, and to establish that\r\nequality of benefits and burdens which constitutes the true basis of our\r\nstrength and union? Will the militia of the nation, which must furnish\r\nour soldiers and seamen, increase as slaves increase? Will the\r\nactual disproportion in the military service of the nation be thereby\r\ndiminished?--a disproportion that will be, as it has been, readily\r\nborne, as between the original States, because it arises out of their\r\ncompact of Union, but which may become a badge of inferiority, if\r\nrequired for the protection of those who, being free to choose, persist\r\nin the establishment of maxims, the inevitable effect of which will\r\ndeprive them of the power to contribute to the common defence, and even\r\nof the ability to protect themselves. There are limits within which\r\nour federal system must stop; no one has supposed that it could be\r\nindefinitely extended--we are now about to pass our original boundary;\r\nif this can be done without affecting the principles of our free\r\ngovernments, it can be accomplished only by the most vigilant attention\r\nto plant, cherish, and sustain the principles of liberty in the new\r\nStates, that may be formed beyond our ancient limits; with our utmost\r\ncaution in this respect, it may still be justly apprehended that the\r\nGeneral Government must be made stronger as we become more extended.\r\n\r\nBut if, instead of freedom, slavery is to prevail and spread, as we\r\nextend our dominion, can any reflecting man fail to see the necessity of\r\ngiving to the General Government greater powers, to enable it to\r\nafford the protection that will be demanded of it? powers that will be\r\ndifficult to control, and which may prove fatal to the public liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PINKNEY,\r\n\r\nOF MARYLAND. (BORN 1764, DIED 1822.)\r\n\r\nON THE MISSOURI QUESTION'--UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nSENATE, FEBRUARY 15, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I am not a very frequent speaker in this assembly, and have shown a\r\ndesire, I trust, rather to listen to the wisdom of others than to lay\r\nclaim to superior knowledge by undertaking to advise, even when advice,\r\nby being seasonable in point of time, might have some chance of being\r\nprofitable, you will, perhaps, bear with me if I venture to trouble you\r\nonce more on that eternal subject which has lingered here, until all\r\nits natural interest is exhausted, and every topic connected with it\r\nis literally worn to tatters. I shall, I assure you, sir, speak with\r\nlaudable brevity--not merely on account of the feeble state of my\r\nhealth, and from some reverence for the laws of good taste which forbid\r\nme to speak otherwise, but also from a sense of justice to those\r\nwho honor me with their attention. My single purpose, as I suggested\r\nyesterday, is to subject to a friendly, yet close examination,\r\nsome portions of a speech, imposing, certainly, on account of the\r\ndistinguished quarter from whence it came--not very imposing (if I may\r\nso say, without departing from that respect which I sincerely feel and\r\nintend to manifest for eminent abilities and long experience) for any\r\nother reason.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI confess to you, nevertheless, that some of the principles announced\r\nby the honorable gentleman from New York, with an explicitness that\r\nreflected the highest credit on his candor, did, when they were first\r\npresented, startle me not a little. They were not perhaps entirely new.\r\nPerhaps I had seen them before in some shadowy and doubtful shape,\r\n\r\n     \"If shape it might be called, that shape had none,\r\n     Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb?\"\r\n\r\nBut in the honorable gentleman's speech they were shadowy and doubtful\r\nno longer. He exhibited them in forms so boldly and accurately--with\r\ncontours so distinctly traced--with features so pronounced and\r\nstriking that I was unconscious for a moment that they might be old\r\nacquaintances. I received them as a _novi hospites_ within these walls,\r\nand gazed upon them with astonishment and alarm. I have recovered,\r\nhowever, thank God, from this paroxysm of terror, although not from that\r\nof astonishment. I have sought and found tranquillity and courage in\r\nmy former consolatory faith. My reliance is that these principles will\r\nobtain no general currency; for, if they should, it requires no gloomy\r\nimagination to sadden the perspective of the future. My reliance is upon\r\nthe unsophisticated good sense and noble spirit of the American people.\r\nI have what I may be allowed to call a proud and patriotic trust, that\r\nthey will give countenance to no principles which, if followed out to\r\ntheir obvious consequences, will not only shake the goodly fabric of the\r\nUnion to its foundations, but reduce it to a melancholy ruin. The people\r\nof this country, if I do not wholly mistake their character, are wise as\r\nwell as virtuous. They know the value of that federal association which\r\nis to them the single pledge and guarantee of power and peace. Their\r\nwarm and pious affections will cling to it as to their only hope of\r\nprosperity and happiness, in defiance of pernicious abstractions, by\r\nwhomsoever inculcated, or howsoever seductive or alluring in their\r\naspect.'\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSir, it was but the other day that we were forbidden, (properly\r\nforbidden I am sure, for the prohibition came from you,) to assume that\r\nthere existed any intention to impose a prospective restraint on\r\nthe domestic legislation of Missouri--a restraint to act upon it\r\ncontemporaneously with its origin as a State, and to continue adhesive\r\nto it through all the stages of its political existence. We are now,\r\nhowever, permitted to know that it is determined by a sort of political\r\nsurgery to amputate one of the limbs of its local sovereignty, and thus\r\nmangled and disparaged, and thus only, to receive it into the bosom of\r\nthe Constitution. It is now avowed that, while Maine is to be ushered\r\ninto the Union with every possible demonstration of studious reverence\r\non our part, and on hers, with colors flying, and all the other graceful\r\naccompaniments of honorable triumph, this ill-conditioned upstart of the\r\nWest, this obscure foundling of a wilderness that was but yesterday\r\nthe hunting-ground of the savage, is to find her way into the American\r\nfamily as she can, with an humiliating badge of remediless inferiority\r\npatched upon her garments, with the mark of recent, qualified\r\nmanumission upon her, or rather with a brand upon her forehead to tell\r\nthe stogy of her territorial vassalage, and to perpetuate the memory of\r\nher evil propensities. It is now avowed that, while the robust district\r\nof Maine is to be seated by the side of her truly respectable parent,\r\nco-ordinate in authority and honor, and is to be dandled into that power\r\nand dignity of which she does not stand in need, but which undoubtedly\r\nshe deserves, the more infantine and feeble Missouri is to be repelled\r\nwith harshness, and forbidden to come at all, unless with the iron\r\ncollar of servitude about her neck, instead of the civic crown of\r\nrepublican freedom upon her brows, and is to be doomed forever to\r\nleading-strings, unless she will exchange those leading-strings for\r\nshackles.\r\n\r\nI am told that you have the power to establish this odious and revolting\r\ndistinction, and I am referred for the proofs of that power to various\r\nparts of the Constitution, but principally to that part of it which\r\nauthorizes the admission of new States into the Union. I am myself\r\nof opinion that it is in that part only that the advocates for this\r\nrestriction can, with any hope of success, apply for a license to\r\nimpose it; and that the efforts which have been made to find it in\r\nother portions of that instrument, are too desperate to require to be\r\nencountered. I shall, however, examine those other portions before I\r\nhave done, lest it should be supposed by those who have relied upon\r\nthem, that what I omit to answer I believe to be unanswerable.\r\n\r\nThe clause of the Constitution which relates to the admission of new\r\nStates is in these words: \"The Congress may admit new States into this\r\nUnion,\" etc., and the advocates for restriction maintain that the use\r\nof the word \"may\" imports discretion to admit or to reject; and that in\r\nthis discretion is wrapped up another--that of prescribing the terms and\r\nconditions of admission in case you are willing to admit: \"_Cujus est\r\ndare ejus est disponere_.\" I will not for the present inquire whether\r\nthis involved discretion to dictate the terms of admission belongs to\r\nyou or not. It is fit that I should first look to the nature and extent\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nI think I may assume that if such a power be anything but nominal, it\r\nis much more than adequate to the present object--that it is a power\r\nof vast expansion, to which human sagacity can assign no reasonable\r\nlimits--that it is a capacious reservoir of authority, from which you\r\nmay take, in all time to come, as occasion may serve, the means of\r\noppression as well as of benefaction. I know that it professes at this\r\nmoment to be the chosen instrument of protecting mercy, and would win\r\nupon us by its benignant smiles; but I know, too, it can frown and play\r\nthe tyrant, if it be so disposed. Notwithstanding the softness which it\r\nnow assumes, and the care with which it conceals its giant proportions\r\nbeneath the deceitful drapery of sentiment, when it next appears before\r\nyou it may show itself with a sterner countenance and in more awful\r\ndimensions. It is, to speak the truth, sir, a power of colossal size--if\r\nindeed it be not an abuse of language to call it by the gentle name of a\r\npower. Sir, it is a wilderness of power, of which fancy in her happiest\r\nmood is unable to perceive the far distant and shadowy boundary. Armed\r\nwith such a power, with religion in one hand and philanthropy in the\r\nother, and followed with a goodly train of public and private virtues,\r\nyou may achieve more conquests over sovereignties not your own than\r\nfalls to the common lot of even uncommon ambition. By the aid of such a\r\npower, skilfully employed, you may \"bridge your way\" over the Hellespont\r\nthat separates State legislation from that of Congress; and you may do\r\nso for pretty much the same purpose with which Xerxes once bridged his\r\nway across the Hellespont that separates Asia from Europe. He did so, in\r\nthe language of Milton, \"the liberties of Greece to yoke.\" You may do so\r\nfor the analogous purpose of subjugating and reducing the sovereignties\r\nof States, as your taste or convenience may suggest, and fashioning\r\nthem to your imperial will. There are those in this House who appear\r\nto think, and I doubt not sincerely, that the particular restraint now\r\nunder consideration is wise, and benevolent, and good; wise as respects\r\nthe Union--good as respects Missouri--benevolent as respects the unhappy\r\nvictims whom with a novel kindness it would incarcerate in the south,\r\nand bless by decay and extirpation. Let all such beware, lest in their\r\ndesire for the effect which they believe the restriction will produce,\r\nthey are too easily satisfied that they have the right to impose it.\r\nThe moral beauty of the present purpose, or even its political\r\nrecommendations (whatever they may be), can do nothing for a power\r\nlike this, which claims to prescribe conditions _ad libitum_, and to\r\nbe competent to this purpose, because it is competent to all. This\r\nrestriction, if it be not smothered in its birth, will be but a small\r\npart of the progeny of the prolific power. It teems with a mighty brood,\r\nof which this may be entitled to the distinction of comeliness as well\r\nas of primogeniture. The rest may want the boasted loveliness of their\r\npredecessor, and be even uglier than \"Lapland witches\".\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI would not discourage authorized legislation upon those kindly,\r\ngenerous, and noble feelings which Providence has given to us for the\r\nbest of purposes; but when power to act is under discussion, I will\r\nnot look to the end in view, lest I should become indifferent to the\r\nlawfulness of the means. Let us discard from this high constitutional\r\nquestion all those extrinsic considerations which have been forced\r\ninto its discussion. Let us endeavor to approach it with a philosophic\r\nimpartiality of temper--with a sincere desire to ascertain the\r\nboundaries of our authority, and a determination to keep our wishes in\r\nsubjection to our allegiance to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSlavery, we are told in many a pamphlet, memorial, and speech, with\r\nwhich the press has lately groaned, is a foul blot upon our otherwise\r\nimmaculate reputation. Let this be conceded--yet you are no nearer than\r\nbefore to the conclusion that you possess power which may deal with\r\nother subjects as effectually as with this. Slavery, we are further\r\ntold, with some pomp of metaphor, is a canker at the root of all that\r\nis excellent in this republican empire, a pestilent disease that is\r\nsnatching the youthful bloom from its cheek, prostrating its honor and\r\nwithering its strength. Be it so--yet if you have power to medicine to\r\nit in the way proposed, and in virtue of the diploma which you claim,\r\nyou have also power in the distribution of your political alexipharmics\r\nto present the deadliest drugs to every territory that would become a\r\nState, and bid it drink or remain a colony forever. Slavery, we are also\r\ntold, is now \"rolling onward with a rapid tide towards the boundless\r\nregions of the West,\" threatening to doom them to sterility and sorrow,\r\nunless some potent voice can say to it,thus far shalt thou go, and no\r\nfarther. Slavery engenders pride and indolence in him who commands, and\r\ninflicts intellectual and moral degradation on him who serves. Slavery,\r\nin fine, is unchristian and abominable. Sir, I shall not stop to deny\r\nthat slavery is all this and more; but I shall not think myself the less\r\nauthorized to deny that it is for you to stay the course of this dark\r\ntorrent, by opposing to it a mound raised up by the labors of this\r\nportentous discretion on the domain of others--a mound which you cannot\r\nerect but through the instrumentality of a trespass of no ordinary\r\nkind--not the comparatively innocent trespass that beats down a few\r\nblades of grass which the first kind sun or the next refreshing shower\r\nmay cause to spring again--but that which levels with the ground\r\nthe lordliest trees of the forest, and claims immortality for the\r\ndestruction which it inflicts.\r\n\r\nI shall not, I am sure, be told that I exaggerate this power. It has\r\nbeen admitted here and elsewhere that I do not. But I want no such\r\nconcession. It is manifest that as a discretionary power it is\r\neverything or nothing--that its head is in the clouds, or that it is a\r\nmere figment of enthusiastic speculation--that it has no existence, or\r\nthat it is an alarming vortex ready to swallow up all such portions of\r\nthe sovereignty of an infant State as you may think fit to cast into\r\nit as preparatory to the introduction into the union of the miserable\r\nresidue. No man can contradict me when I say, that if you have this\r\npower, you may squeeze down a new-born sovereign State to the size of a\r\npigmy, and then taking it between finger and thumb, stick it into some\r\nniche of the Union, and still continue by way of mockery to call it a\r\nState in the sense of the Constitution. You may waste it to a shadow,\r\nand then introduce it into the society of flesh and blood an object of\r\nscorn and derision. You may sweat and reduce it to a thing of skin and\r\nbone, and then place the ominous skeleton beside the ruddy and healthful\r\nmembers of the Union, that it may have leisure to mourn the lamentable\r\ndifference between itself and its companions, to brood over its\r\ndisastrous promotion, and to seek in justifiable discontent an\r\nopportunity for separation, and insurrection, and rebellion. What may\r\nyou not do by dexterity and perseverance with this terrific power? You\r\nmay give to a new State, in the form of terms which it cannot\r\nrefuse, (as I shall show you hereafter,) a statute book of a\r\nthousand volumes--providing not for ordinary cases only, but even for\r\npossibilities; you may lay the yoke, no matter whether light or heavy,\r\nupon the necks of the latest posterity; you may send this searching\r\npower into every hamlet for centuries to come, by laws enacted in the\r\nspirit of prophecy, and regulating all those dear relations of domestic\r\nconcern which belong to local legislation, and which even local\r\nlegislation touches with a delicate and sparing hand. This is the first\r\ninroad. But will it be the last? This provision is but a pioneer for\r\nothers of a more desolating aspect. It is that fatal bridge of which\r\nMilton speaks, and when once firmly built, what shall hinder you to pass\r\nit when you please for the purpose of plundering power after power at\r\nthe expense of new States, as you will still continue to call them, and\r\nraising up prospective codes irrevocable and immortal, which shall leave\r\nto those States the empty shadows of domestic sovereignty, and convert\r\nthem into petty pageants, in themselves contemptible, but rendered\r\ninfinitely more so by the contrast of their humble faculties with the\r\nproud and admitted pretensions of those who having doomed them to\r\nthe inferiority of vassals, have condescended to take them into their\r\nsociety and under their protection?\r\n\r\n\"New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union.\" It is\r\nobjected that the word \"may\" imports power, not obligation--a right to\r\ndecide--a discretion to grant or refuse.\r\n\r\nTo this it might be answered that power is duty on many occasions. But\r\nlet it be conceded that it is discretionary. What consequence follows?\r\nA power to refuse, in a case like this, does not necessarily involve a\r\npower to exact terms. You must look to the result which is the declared\r\nobject of the power. Whether you will arrive at it, or not, may depend\r\non your will; but you cannot compromise with the result intended and\r\nprofessed.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the professed result? To admit a State into this Union.\r\n\r\nWhat is that Union? A confederation of States equal in\r\nsovereignty--capable of everything which the Constitution does not\r\nforbid, or authorize Congress to forbid. It is an equal union, between\r\nparties equally sovereign. They were sovereign independently of the\r\nUnion. The object of the Union was common protection for the exercise\r\nof already existing sovereignty. The parties gave up a portion of that\r\nsovereignty to insure the remainder. As far as they gave it up by the\r\ncommon compact they have ceased to be sovereign. The Union provides the\r\nmeans of defending the residue; and it is into that Union that a new\r\nState is to come. By acceding to it, the new State is placed on the same\r\nfooting with the original States. It accedes for the same purpose,\r\ni.e., protection for their unsurrendered sovereignty. If it comes in shorn\r\nof its beams--crippled and disparaged beyond the original States, it is\r\nnot into the original Union that it comes. For it is a different sort\r\nof Union. The first was Union _inter pares_. This is a Union between\r\n\"_disparates_\"--between giants and a dwarf--between power and\r\nfeebleness--between full proportioned sovereignties and a miserable\r\nimage of power--a thing which that very Union has shrunk and shrivelled\r\nfrom its just size, instead of preserving it in its true dimensions.\r\n\r\nIt is into this Union, i. e., the Union of the Federal Constitution,\r\nthat you are to admit, or refuse to admit. You can admit into no other.\r\nYou cannot make the Union, as to the new State, what it is not as to the\r\nold; for then it is not this Union that you open for the entrance of a\r\nnew party. If you make it enter into a new and additional compact, is it\r\nany longer the same Union?\r\n\r\nWe are told that admitting a State into the Union is a compact. Yes,\r\nbut what sort of a compact? A compact that it shall be a member of the\r\nUnion, as the Constitution has made it. You cannot new fashion it. You\r\nmay make a compact to admit, but when admitted the original compact\r\nprevails. The Union is a compact, with a provision of political power\r\nand agents for the accomplishment of its objects. Vary that compact as\r\nto a new State--give new energy to that political power so as to make it\r\nact with more force upon a new State than upon the old--make the will\r\nof those agents more effectually the arbiter of the fate of a new State\r\nthan of the old, and it may be confidently said that the new State has\r\nnot entered into this Union, but into another Union. How far the Union\r\nhas been varied is another question. But that it has been varied is\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nIf I am told that by the bill relative to Missouri, you do not legislate\r\nupon a new State, I answer that you do; and I answer further that it is\r\nimmaterial whether you do or not. But it is upon Missouri, as a State,\r\nthat your terms and conditions are to act. Until Missouri is a State,\r\nthe terms and conditions are nothing. You legislate in the shape of\r\nterms and conditions, prospectively--and you so legislate upon it that\r\nwhen it comes into the Union it is to be bound by a contract degrading\r\nand diminishing its sovereignty--and is to be stripped of rights which\r\nthe original parties to the Union did not consent to abandon, and which\r\nthat Union (so far as depends upon it) takes under its protection and\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\nIs the right to hold slaves a right which Massachusetts enjoys? If it\r\nis, Massachusetts is under this Union in a different character from\r\nMissouri. The compact of Union for it, is different from the\r\nsame compact of Union for Missouri. The power of Congress is\r\ndifferent--everything which depends upon the Union is, in that respect,\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nBut it is immaterial whether you legislate for Missouri as a State or\r\nnot. The effect of your legislation is to bring it into the Union with a\r\nportion of its sovereignty taken away.\r\n\r\nBut it is a State which you are to admit. What is a State in the sense\r\nof the Constitution? It is not a State in the general--but a State as\r\nyou find it in the Constitution. A State, generally, is a body politic\r\nor independent political society of men. But the State which you are to\r\nadmit must be more or less than this political entity. What must it be?\r\nAsk the constitution. It shows what it means by a State by reference to\r\nthe parties to it. It must be such a State as Massachusetts, Virginia,\r\nand the other members of the American confederacy--a State with full\r\nsovereignty except as the constitution restricts it.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn a word, the whole amount of the argument on the other side is, that\r\nyou may refuse to admit a new State, and that therefore if you admit,\r\nyou may prescribe the terms.\r\n\r\nThe answer to that argument is--that even if you can refuse, you can\r\nprescribe no terms which are inconsistent with the act you are to do.\r\nYou can prescribe no conditions which, if carried into effect, would\r\nmake the new State less a sovereign State than, under the Union as it\r\nstands, it would be. You can prescribe no terms which will make\r\nthe compact of Union between it and the original States essentially\r\ndifferent from that compact among the original States. You may admit, or\r\nrefuse to admit: but if you admit, you must admit a State in the sense\r\nof the Constitution--a State with all such sovereignty as belongs to the\r\noriginal parties: and it must be into this Union that you are to admit\r\nit, not into a Union of your own dictating, formed out of the existing\r\nUnion by qualifications and new compacts, altering its character and\r\neffect, and making it fall short of its protecting energy in reference\r\nto the new State, whilst it acquires an energy of another sort--the\r\nenergy of restraint and destruction.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOne of the most signal errors with which the argument on the other side\r\nhas abounded, is this of considering the proposed restriction as if\r\nlevelled at the introduction or establishment of slavery. And hence the\r\nvehement declamation, which, among other things, has informed us that\r\nslavery originated in fraud or violence.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the restriction has no relation, real or pretended,\r\nto the right of making slaves of those who are free, or of introducing\r\nslavery where it does not already exist. It applies to those who are\r\nadmitted to be already slaves, and who (with their posterity) would\r\ncontinue to be slaves if they should remain where they are at present;\r\nand to a place where slavery already exists by the local law. Their\r\ncivil condition will not be altered by their removal from Virginia, or\r\nCarolina, to Missouri. They will not be more slaves than they now are.\r\nTheir abode, indeed, will be different, but their bondage the same.\r\nTheir numbers may possibly be augmented by the diffusion, and I think\r\nthey will. But this can only happen because their hardships will be\r\nmitigated, and their comforts increased. The checks to population,\r\nwhich exist in the older States, will be diminished. The restriction,\r\ntherefore does not prevent the establishment of slavery, either with\r\nreference to persons or place; but simply inhibits the removal from\r\nplace to place (the law in each being the same) of a slave, or make his\r\nemancipation the consequence of that removal. It acts professedly merely\r\non slavery as it exists, and thus acting restrains its present lawful\r\neffects. That slavery, like many other human institutions, originated\r\nin fraud or violence, may be conceded: but, however it originated, it is\r\nestablished among us, and no man seeks a further establishment of it\r\nby new importations of freemen to be converted into slaves. On the\r\ncontrary, all are anxious to mitigate its evils, by all the means within\r\nthe reach of the appropriate authority, the domestic legislatures of the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOf the declaration of our independence, which has also been quoted in\r\nsupport of the perilous doctrines now urged upon us, I need not now\r\nspeak at large. I have shown on a former occasion how idle it is to rely\r\nupon that instrument for such a purpose, and I will not fatigue you by\r\nmere repetition. The self-evident truths announced in the Declaration\r\nof Independence are not truths at all, if taken literally; and the\r\npractical conclusions contained in the same passage of that declaration\r\nprove that they were never designed to be so received.\r\n\r\nThe articles of confederation contain nothing on the subject; whilst the\r\nactual Constitution recognizes the legal existence of slavery by various\r\nprovisions. The power of prohibiting the slave trade is involved in that\r\nof regulating commerce, but this is coupled with an express inhibition\r\nto the exercise of it for twenty years. How then can that Constitution\r\nwhich expressly permits the importation of slaves authorize the National\r\nGovernment to set on foot a crusade against slavery?\r\n\r\nThe clause respecting fugitive slaves is affirmative and active in its\r\neffects. It is a direct sanction and positive protection of the right of\r\nthe master to the services of his slave as derived under the local laws\r\nof the States. The phraseology in which it is wrapped up still leaves\r\nthe intention clear, and the words, \"persons held to service or labor\r\nin one State under the laws thereof,\" have always been interpreted to\r\nextend to the case of slaves, in the various acts of Congress which\r\nhave been passed to give efficacy to the provision, and in the judicial\r\napplication of those laws. So also in the clause prescribing the ratio\r\nof representation--the phrase, \"three-fifths of all other persons,\"\r\nis equivalent to slaves, or it means nothing. And yet we are told that\r\nthose who are acting under a Constitution which sanctions the existence\r\nof slavery in those States which choose to tolerate it, are at liberty\r\nto hold that no law can sanction its existence.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to make the rightfulness of an act the measure of sovereign\r\npower. The distinction between sovereign power and the moral right\r\nto exercise it has always been recognized. All political power may be\r\nabused, but is it to stop where abuse may begin? The power of declaring\r\nwar is a power of vast capacity for mischief, and capable of inflicting\r\nthe most wide-spread desolation. But it is given to Congress without\r\nstint and without measure. Is a citizen, or are the courts of justice\r\nto inquire whether that, or any other law, is just, before they obey or\r\nexecute it? And are there any degrees of injustice which will withdraw\r\nfrom sovereign power the capacity of making a given law?\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe power is \"to admit new States into this Union,\" and it may be safely\r\nconceded that here is discretion to admit or refuse. The question is,\r\nwhat must we do if we do anything? What must we admit, and into what?\r\nThe answer is a State--and into this Union.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between Federal rights and local rights, is an idle\r\ndistinction. Because the new State acquires Federal rights, it is not,\r\ntherefore, in this Union. The Union is a compact; and is it an equal\r\nparty to that compact, because it has equal Federal rights?\r\n\r\nHow is the Union formed? By equal contributions of power. Make one\r\nmember sacrifice more than another, and it becomes unequal. The compact\r\nis of two parts:\r\n\r\n1. The thing obtained--Federal rights. 2. The price paid--local\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\nYou may disturb the balance of the Union, either by diminishing the\r\nthing acquired, or increasing the sacrifice paid.\r\n\r\nWhat were the purposes of coming into the Union among the original\r\nStates? The States were originally sovereign without limit, as to\r\nforeign and domestic concerns. But being incapable of protecting\r\nthemselves singly, they entered into the Union to defend themselves\r\nagainst foreign violence. The domestic concerns of the people were not,\r\nin general, to be acted on by it. The security of the power, of managing\r\nthem by domestic legislature, is one of the great objects of the Union.\r\nThe Union is a means, not an end. By requiring greater sacrifices\r\nof domestic power, the end is sacrificed to the means. Suppose the\r\nsurrender of all, or nearly all, the domestic powers of legislation were\r\nrequired; the means would there have swallowed up the end.\r\n\r\nThe argument that the compact may be enforced, shows that the Federal\r\npredicament changed. The power of the Union not only acts on persons or\r\ncitizens, but on the faculty of the government, and restrains it in a\r\nway which the Constitution nowhere authorizes. This new obligation takes\r\naway a right which is expressly \"reserved to the people or the States,\"\r\nsince it is nowhere granted to the government of the Union. You cannot\r\ndo indirectly what you cannot do directly. It is said that this Union\r\nis competent to make compacts. Who doubts it? But can you make this\r\ncompact? I insist that you cannot make it, because it is repugnant to\r\nthe thing to be done.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such a compact would be to produce that inequality in the\r\nUnion, to which the Constitution, in all its provisions, is adverse.\r\nEverything in it looks to equality among the members of the Union. Under\r\nit you cannot produce inequality. Nor can you get before-hand of the\r\nConstitution, and do it by anticipation. Wait until a State is in the\r\nUnion, and you cannot do it; yet it is only upon the State in the Union\r\nthat what you do begins to act.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that, although the proposed restrictions may not be\r\njustified by the clause of the Constitution which gives power to admit\r\nnew States into the Union, separately considered, there are other parts\r\nof the Constitution which, combined with that clause, will warrant it.\r\nAnd first, we are informed that there is a clause in this instrument\r\nwhich declares that Congress shall guarantee to every State a republican\r\nform of government; that slavery and such a form of government are\r\nincompatible; and, finally, as a conclusion from these premises, that\r\nCongress not only have a right, but are bound to exclude slavery from a\r\nnew State. Here again, sir, there is an edifying inconsistency between\r\nthe argument and the measure which it professes to vindicate. By the\r\nargument it is maintained that Missouri cannot have a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and at the same time tolerate negro slavery. By the measure\r\nit is admitted that Missouri may tolerate slavery, as to persons already\r\nin bondage there, and be nevertheless fit to be received into the Union.\r\nWhat sort of constitutional mandate is this which can thus be made\r\nto bend and truckle and compromise as if it were a simple rule of\r\nexpediency that might admit of exceptions upon motives of countervailing\r\nexpediency. There can be no such pliancy in the peremptory provisions of\r\nthe Constitution. They cannot be obeyed by moieties and violated in the\r\nsame ratio. They must be followed out to their full extent, or treated\r\nwith that decent neglect which has at least the merit of forbearing to\r\nrender contumacy obtrusive by an ostentatious display of the very duty\r\nwhich we in part abandon. If the decalogue could be observed in this\r\ncasuistical manner, we might be grievous sinners, and yet be liable to\r\nno reproach. We might persist in all our habitual irregularities,\r\nand still be spotless. We might, for example, continue to covet our\r\nneighbors' goods, provided they were the same neighbors whose goods we\r\nhad before coveted--and so of all the other commandments.\r\n\r\nWill the gentlemen tell us that it is the quantity of slaves, not the\r\nquality of slavery, which takes from a government the republican\r\nform? Will they tell us (for they have not yet told us) that there are\r\nconstitutional grounds (to say nothing of common sense) upon which the\r\nslavery which now exists in Missouri may be reconciled with a republican\r\nform of government, while any addition to the number of its slaves (the\r\nquality of slavery remaining the same) from the other States, will\r\nbe repugnant to that form, and metamorphose it into some nondescript\r\ngovernment disowned by the Constitution? They cannot have recourse to\r\nthe treaty of 1803 for such a distinction, since independently of what I\r\nhave before observed on that head, the gentlemen have contended that the\r\ntreaty has nothing to do with the matter.\r\n\r\nThey have cut themselves off from all chance of a convenient distinction\r\nin or out of that treaty, by insisting that slavery beyond the old\r\nUnited States is rejected by the Constitution, and by the law of God\r\nas discoverable by the aid of either reason or revelation; and moreover\r\nthat the treaty does not include the case, and if it did could not make\r\nit better. They have, therefore, completely discredited their own theory\r\nby their own practice, and left us no theory worthy of being seriously\r\ncontroverted. This peculiarity in reasoning of giving out a universal\r\nprinciple, and coupling with it a practical concession that it is wholly\r\nfallacious, has indeed run through the greater part of the arguments\r\non the other side; but it is not, as I think, the more imposing on that\r\naccount, or the less liable to the criticism which I have here bestowed\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBut let us proceed to take a rapid glance at the reasons which have been\r\nassigned for this notion that involuntary servitude and a republican\r\nform of government are perfect antipathies. The gentleman from New\r\nHampshire has defined a republican government to be that in which all\r\nthe men participate in its power and privileges; from whence it follows\r\nthat where there are slaves, it can have no existence. A definition is\r\nno proof, however, and even if it be dignified (as I think it was) with\r\nthe name of a maxim, the matter is not much mended. It is Lord Bacon\r\nwho says \"That nothing is so easily made as a maxim\"; and certainly a\r\ndefinition is manufactured with equal facility. A political maxim is\r\nthe work of induction, and cannot stand against experience, or stand on\r\nanything but experience. But this maxim, or definition, or whatever else\r\nit may be, sets facts at defiance. If you go back to antiquity, you will\r\nobtain no countenance for this hypothesis; and if you look at home you\r\nwill gain still less. I have read that Sparta, and Rome, and Athens, and\r\nmany others of the ancient family, were republics. They were so in form\r\nundoubtedly--the last approaching nearer to a perfect democracy than any\r\nother government which has yet been known in the world. Judging of\r\nthem also by their fruits, they were of the highest order of republics.\r\nSparta could scarcely be any other than a republic, when a Spartan\r\nmatron could say to her son just marching to battle, \"Return victorious,\r\nor return no more.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the unconquerable spirit of liberty, nurtured by republican\r\nhabits and institutions, that illustrated the pass of Thermopylae. Yet\r\nslavery was not only tolerated in Sparta, but was established by one\r\nof the fundamental laws of Lycurgus, having for its object the\r\nencouragement of that very spirit. Attica was full of slaves--yet the\r\nlove of liberty was its characteristic. What else was it that foiled the\r\nwhole power of Persia at Marathon and Salamis? What other soil than that\r\nwhich the genial sun of republican freedom illuminated and warmed,\r\ncould have produced such men as Leonidas and Miltiades, Themistocles and\r\nEpaminondas? Of Rome it would be superfluous to speak at large. It is\r\nsufficient to name the mighty mistress of the world, before Sylla gave\r\nthe first stab to her liberties and the great dictator accomplished\r\ntheir final ruin, to be reminded of the practicability of union between\r\ncivil slavery and an ardent love of liberty cherished by republican\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nIf we return home for instruction upon this point, we perceive that same\r\nunion exemplified in many a State, in which \"Liberty has a temple in\r\nevery house, an altar in every heart,\" while involuntary servitude is\r\nseen in every direction.\r\n\r\nIs it denied that those States possess a republican form of government?\r\nIf it is, why does our power of correction sleep? Why is the\r\nconstitutional guaranty suffered to be inactive? Why am I permitted to\r\nfatigue you, as the representative of a slaveholding State, with the\r\ndiscussion of the \"_nugae canorae_\" (for so I think them) that have been\r\nforced into this debate contrary to all the remonstrances of taste\r\nand prudence? Do gentlemen perceive the consequences to which their\r\narguments must lead if they are of any value? Do they reflect that they\r\nlead to emancipation in the old United States--or to an exclusion of\r\nDelaware, Maryland, and all the South, and a great portion of the West\r\nfrom the Union? My honorable friend from Virginia has no business here,\r\nif this disorganizing creed be anything but the production of a heated\r\nbrain. The State to which I belong, must \"perform a lustration\"--must\r\npurge and purify herself from the feculence of civil slavery, and\r\nemulate the States of the North in their zeal for throwing down the\r\ngloomy idol which we are said to worship, before her senators can have\r\nany title to appear in this high assembly. It will be in vain to urge\r\nthat the old United States are exceptions to the rule--or rather (as the\r\ngentlemen express it), that they have no disposition to apply the rule\r\nto them. There can be no exceptions by implication only, to such a\r\nrule; and expressions which justify the exemption of the old States\r\nby inference, will justify the like exemption of Missouri, unless they\r\npoint exclusively to them, as I have shown they do not. The guarded\r\nmanner, too, in which some of the gentlemen have occasionally expressed\r\nthemselves on this subject, is somewhat alarming. They have no\r\ndisposition to meddle with slavery in the old United States. Perhaps\r\nnot--but who shall answer for their successors? Who shall furnish a\r\npledge that the principle once ingrafted into the Constitution, will not\r\ngrow, and spread, and fructify, and overshadow the whole land? It is the\r\nnatural office of such a principle to wrestle with slavery, wheresoever\r\nit finds it. New States, colonized by the apostles of this principle,\r\nwill enable it to set on foot a fanatical crusade against all who still\r\ncontinue to tolerate it, although no practicable means are pointed out\r\nby which they can get rid of it consistently with their own safety. At\r\nany rate, a present forbearing disposition, in a few or in many, is not\r\na security upon which much reliance can be placed upon a subject as to\r\nwhich so many selfish interests and ardent feelings are connected with\r\nthe cold calculations of policy. Admitting, however, that the old United\r\nStates are in no danger from this principle--why is it so? There can be\r\nno other answer (which these zealous enemies of slavery can use) than\r\nthat the Constitution recognizes slavery as existing or capable of\r\nexisting in those States. The Constitution, then, admits that slavery\r\nand a republican form of government are not incongruous. It associates\r\nand binds them up together and repudiates this wild imagination which\r\nthe gentlemen have pressed upon us with such an air of triumph. But the\r\nConstitution does more, as I have heretofore proved. It concedes that\r\nslavery may exist in a new State, as well as in an old one--since the\r\nlanguage in which it recognizes slavery comprehends new States as well\r\nas actual. I trust then that I shall be forgiven if I suggest, that no\r\neccentricity in argument can be more trying to human patience, than a\r\nformal assertion that a constitution, to which slave-holding States were\r\nthe most numerous parties, in which slaves are treated as property\r\nas well as persons, and provision is made for the security of that\r\nproperty, and even for an augmentation of it by a temporary importation\r\nfrom Africa, with a clause commanding Congress to guarantee a republican\r\nform of government to those very States, as well as to others,\r\nauthorizes you to determine that slavery and a republican form of\r\ngovernment cannot coexist.\r\n\r\nBut if a republican form of government is that in which all the men have\r\na share in the public power, the slave-holding States will not alone\r\nretire from the Union. The constitutions of some of the other States do\r\nnot sanction universal suffrage, or universal eligibility. They require\r\ncitizenship, and age, and a certain amount of property, to give a title\r\nto vote or to be voted for; and they who have not those qualifications\r\nare just as much disfranchised, with regard to the government and its\r\npower, as if they were slaves. They have civil rights indeed (and\r\nso have slaves in a less degree; ) but they have no share in the\r\ngovernment. Their province is to obey the laws, not to assist in making\r\nthem. All such States must therefore be forisfamiliated with Virginia\r\nand the rest, or change their system. For the Constitution being\r\nabsolutely silent on those subjects, will afford them no protection. The\r\nUnion might thus be reduced from an Union to an unit. Who does not see\r\nthat such conclusions flow from false notions--that the true theory of a\r\nrepublican government is mistaken--and that in such a government rights,\r\npolitical and civil, may be qualified by the fundamental law, upon such\r\ninducements as the freemen of the country deem sufficient? That civil\r\nrights may be qualified as well as political, is proved by a\r\nthousand examples. Minors, resident aliens, who are in a course of\r\nnaturalization--the other sex, whether maids, or wives, or widows,\r\nfurnish sufficient practical proofs of this.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe are next invited to study that clause of the Constitution which\r\nrelates to the migration or importation, before the year 1808, of such\r\npersons as any of the States then existing should think proper to admit.\r\nIt runs thus: \"The migration or importation of such persons as any\r\nof the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be\r\nprohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred\r\nand eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not\r\nexceeding ten dollars for each person.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that this clause empowers Congress, after the year 1808,\r\nto prohibit the passage of slaves from State to State, and the word\r\n\"migration\" is relied upon for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the latitude in which the word \"persons\" is capable of\r\nbeing received, it is not denied that the word \"importation\" indicates\r\na bringing in from a jurisdiction foreign to the United States. The two\r\ntermini of the importation, here spoken of, are a foreign country and\r\nthe American Union--the first the _terminus a quo_, the second the\r\n_terminus ad quem_. The word migration stands in simple connexion with\r\nit, and of course is left to the full influence of that connection.\r\nThe natural conclusion is, that the same termini belong to each, or, in\r\nother words, that if the importation must be abroad, so also must be\r\nthe migration--no other termini being assigned to the one which are not\r\nmanifestly characteristic of the other. This conclusion is so obvious,\r\nthat to repel it, the word migration requires, as an appendage,\r\nexplanatory phraseology, giving to it a different beginning from that\r\nof importation. To justify the conclusion that it was intended to mean a\r\nremoval from State to State, each within the sphere of the constitution\r\nin which it is used, the addition of the words from one to another State\r\nin this Union, were indispensable. By the omission of these words, the\r\nword \"migration\" is compelled to take every sense of which it is fairly\r\nsusceptible from its immediate neighbor, \"importation.\" In this view\r\nit means a coming, as \"importation\" means a bringing, from a foreign\r\njurisdiction into the United States. That it is susceptible of this\r\nmeaning, nobody doubts. I go further. It can have no other meaning in\r\nthe place in which it is found. It is found in the Constitution of this\r\nUnion--which, when it speaks of migration as of a general concern, must\r\nbe supposed to have in view a migration into the domain which itself\r\nembraces as a general government.\r\n\r\nMigration, then, even if it comprehends slaves, does not mean the\r\nremoval of them from State to State, but means the coming of slaves\r\nfrom places beyond their limits and their power. And if this be so, the\r\ngentlemen gain nothing for their argument by showing that slaves were\r\nthe objects of this term.\r\n\r\nAn honorable gentleman from Rhode Island, whose speech was distinguished\r\nfor its ability, and for an admirable force of reasoning, as well to\r\nas by the moderation and mildness of its spirit, informed us, with less\r\ndiscretion than in general he exhibited, that the word \"migration\" was\r\nintroduced into this clause at the instance of some of the Southern\r\nStates, who wished by its instrumentality to guard against a prohibition\r\nby Congress of the passage into those States of slaves from other\r\nStates. He has given us no authority for this supposition, and it is,\r\ntherefore, a gratuitous one. How improbable it is, a moment's reflection\r\nwill convince him. The African slave trade being open during the whole\r\nof the time to which the entire clause in question referred, such a\r\npurpose could scarcely be entertained; but if it had been entertained,\r\nand there was believed to be a necessity for securing it, by a\r\nrestriction upon the power of Congress to interfere with it, is it\r\npossible that they who deemed it important, would have contented\r\nthemselves with a vague restraint, which was calculated to operate\r\nin almost any other manner than that which they desired? If fear and\r\njealousy, such as the honorable gentleman has described, had dictated\r\nthis provision, a better term than that of \"migration,\" simple and\r\nunqualified, and joined, too, with the word \"importation,\" would have\r\nbeen found to tranquilize those fears and satisfy that jealousy. Fear\r\nand jealousy are watchful, and are rarely seen to accept a security\r\nshort of their object, and less rarely to shape that security, of their\r\nown accord, in such a way as to make it no security at all. They always\r\nseek an explicit guaranty; and that this is not such a guaranty this\r\ndebate has proved, if it has proved nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN 1811, DIED 1884.)\r\n\r\nON THE MURDER OF LOVEJOY;\r\n\r\nFANEUIL HALL, BOSTON, DECEMBER 8, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nWe have met for the freest discussion of these resolutions, and the\r\nevents which gave rise to them. [Cries of \"Question,\" \"Hear him,\" \"Go\r\non,\" \"No gagging,\" etc.] I hope I shall be permitted to express my\r\nsurprise at the sentiments of the last speaker, surprise not only at\r\nsuch sentiments from such a man, but at the applause they have received\r\nwithin these walls. A comparison has been drawn between the events of\r\nthe Revolution and the tragedy at Alton. We have heard it asserted here,\r\nin Faneuil Hall, that Great Britain had a right to tax the colonies,\r\nand we have heard the mob at Alton, the drunken murderers of Lovejoy,\r\ncompared to those patriot fathers who threw the tea overboard! Fellow\r\ncitizens, is this Faneuil Hall doctrine? [\"No, no.\"] The mob at Alton\r\nwere met to wrest from a citizen his just rights--met to resist the\r\nlaws. We have been told that our fathers did the same; and the glorious\r\nmantle of Revolutionary precedent has been thrown over the mobs of our\r\nday. To make out their title to such defence, the gentleman says that\r\nthe British Parliament had a right to tax these colonies. It is manifest\r\nthat, without this, his parallel falls to the ground, for Lovejoy\r\nhad stationed himself within constitutional bulwarks. He was not only\r\ndefending the freedom of the press, but he was under his own roof, in\r\narms with the sanction of the civil authority. The men who assailed him\r\nwent against and over the laws. The mob, as the gentleman terms it--mob,\r\nforsooth! certainly we sons of the tea-spillers are a marvellously\r\npatient generation!--the \"orderly mob\" which assembled in the Old\r\nSouth to destroy the tea, were met to resist, not the laws, but illegal\r\nenactions. Shame on the American who calls the tea tax and stamp act\r\nlaws! Our fathers resisted, not the King's prerogative, but the King's\r\nusurpation. To find any other account, you must read our Revolutionary\r\nhistory upside down. Our State archives are loaded with arguments\r\nof John Adams to prove the taxes laid by the British Parliament\r\nunconstitutional--beyond its power. It was not until this was made out\r\nthat the men of New England rushed to arms. The arguments of the Council\r\nChamber and the House of Representatives preceded and sanctioned the\r\ncontest. To draw the conduct of our ancestors into a precedent for mobs,\r\nfor a right to resist laws we ourselves have enacted, is an insult to\r\ntheir memory. The difference between the excitements of those days and\r\nour own, which the gentleman in kindness to the latter has overlooked,\r\nis simply this: the men of that day went for the right, as secured\r\nby the laws. They were the people rising to sustain the laws and\r\nconstitution of the Province. The rioters of our days go for their\r\nown wills, right or wrong. Sir, when I heard the gentleman lay down\r\nprinciples which place the murderers of Alton side by side with Otis and\r\nHancock, with Quincy and Adams, I thought those pictured lips [pointing\r\nto the portraits in the Hall] would have broken into voice to rebuke the\r\nrecreant American--the slanderer of the dead. The gentleman said that he\r\nshould sink into insignificance if he dared to gainsay the principles\r\nof these resolutions. Sir, for the sentiments he has uttered, on soil\r\nconsecrated by the prayers of Puritans and the blood of patriots, the\r\nearth should have yawned and swallowed him up.\r\n\r\n[By this time, the uproar in the Hall had risen so high that the speech\r\nwas suspended for a short time. Applause and counter applause, cries of\r\n\"Take that back,\" \"Make him take back recreant,\" \"He sha'n't go on till\r\nhe takes it back,\" and counter cries of \"Phillips or nobody,\" continued\r\nuntil the pleadings of well-known citizens had somewhat restored order,\r\nwhen Mr. Phillips resumed.]\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, I cannot take back my words. Surely the\r\nAttorney-General, so long and so well known here, needs not the aid of\r\nyour hisses against one so young as I am--my voice never before heard\r\nwithin these walls!\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI must find some fault with the statement which has been made of the\r\nevents at Alton. It has been asked why Lovejoy and his friends did not\r\nappeal to the executive--trust their defence to the police of the city?\r\nIt has been hinted that, from hasty and ill-judged excitement, the men\r\nwithin the building provoked a quarrel, and that he fell in the course\r\nof it, one mob resisting another. Recollect, sir, that they did act with\r\nthe approbation and sanction of the Mayor. In strict truth, there was\r\nno executive to appeal to for protection. The Mayor acknowledged that\r\nhe could not protect them. They asked him if it was lawful for them to\r\ndefend themselves. He told them it was, and sanctioned their assembling\r\nin arms to do so. They were not, then, a mob; they were not merely\r\ncitizens defending their own property; they were in some sense the\r\n_posse comitatus_, adopted for the occasion into the police of the city,\r\nacting under the order of a magistrate. It was civil authority resisting\r\nlawless violence. Where, then, was the imprudence? Is the doctrine to\r\nbe sustained here that it is imprudent for men to aid magistrates in\r\nexecuting the laws?\r\n\r\nMen are continually asking each other, Had Lovejoy a right to resist?\r\nSir, I protest against the question instead of answering it. Lovejoy did\r\nnot resist, in the sense they mean. He did not throw himself back on the\r\nnatural right of self-defence. He did not cry anarchy, and let slip the\r\ndogs of civil war, careless of the horrors which would follow. Sir, as\r\nI understand this affair, it was not an individual protecting his\r\nproperty; it was not one body of armed men resisting another, and making\r\nthe streets of a peaceful city run blood with their contentions. It did\r\nnot bring back the scenes in some old Italian cities, where family met\r\nfamily, and faction met faction, and mutually trampled the laws under\r\nfoot. No! the men in that house were regularly enrolled, under the\r\nsanction of the Mayor. There being no militia in Alton, about seventy\r\nmen were enrolled with the approbation of the Mayor. These relieved each\r\nother every other night. About thirty men were in arms on the night\r\nof the sixth, when the press was landed. The next evening, it was not\r\nthought necessary to summon more than half that number; among these was\r\nLovejoy. It was, therefore, you perceive, sir, the police of the city\r\nresisting rioters--civil government breasting itself to the shock of\r\nlawless men.\r\n\r\nHere is no question about the right of self-defence. It is in fact\r\nsimply this: Has the civil magistrate a right to put down a riot?\r\n\r\nSome persons seem to imagine that anarchy existed at Alton from the\r\ncommencement of these disputes. Not at all. \"No one of us,\" says an\r\neyewitness and a comrade of Lovejoy, \"has taken up arms during these\r\ndisturbances but at the command of the Mayor.\" Anarchy did not settle\r\ndown on that devoted city till Lovejoy breathed his last. Till then the\r\nlaw, represented in his person, sustained itself against its foes.\r\nWhen he fell, civil authority was trampled under foot. He had \"planted\r\nhimself on his constitutional rights,\"--appealed to the laws,--claimed\r\nthe protection of the civil authority,--taken refuge under \"the broad\r\nshield of the Constitution. When through that he was pierced and fell,\r\nhe fell but one sufferer in a common catastrophe.\" He took refuge under\r\nthe banner of liberty--amid its folds; and when he fell, its glorious\r\nstars and stripes, the emblem of free institutions, around which cluster\r\nso many heart-stirring memories, were blotted out in the martyr's blood.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, perhaps inadvertently, that Lovejoy or his comrades\r\nfired first. This is denied by those who have the best means of knowing.\r\nGuns were first fired by the mob. After being twice fired on, those\r\nwithin the building consulted together and deliberately returned the\r\nfire. But suppose they did fire first. They had a right so to do;\r\nnot only the right which every citizen has to defend himself, but the\r\nfurther right which every civil officer has to resist violence. Even\r\nif Lovejoy fired the first gun, it would not lessen his claim to our\r\nsympathy, or destroy his title to be considered a martyr in defence of a\r\nfree press. The question now is, Did he act within the constitution and\r\nthe laws? The men who fell in State Street, on the 5th of March, 1770,\r\ndid more than Lovejoy is charged with. They were the first assailants\r\nupon some slight quarrel, they pelted the troops with every missile\r\nwithin reach. Did this bate one jot of the eulogy with which Hancock and\r\nWarren hallowed their memory, hailing them as the first martyrs in the\r\ncause of American liberty? If, sir, I had adopted what are called Peace\r\nprinciples, I might lament the circumstances of this case. But all you\r\nwho believe as I do, in the right and duty of magistrates to execute the\r\nlaws, join with me and brand as base hypocrisy the conduct of those who\r\nassemble year after year on the 4th of July to fight over the battles of\r\nthe Revolution, and yet \"damn with faint praise\" or load with obloquy,\r\nthe memory of this man who shed his blood in defence of life, liberty,\r\nproperty, and the freedom of the press!\r\n\r\nThroughout that terrible night I find nothing to regret but this, that,\r\nwithin the limits of our country, civil authority should have been so\r\nprostrated as to oblige a citizen to arm in his own defence, and to arm\r\nin vain. The gentleman says Lovejoy was presumptuous and imprudent--he\r\n\"died as the fool dieth.\" And a reverend clergyman of the city tells\r\nus that no citizen has a right to publish opinions disagreeable to the\r\ncommunity! If any mob follows such publication, on him rests its guilt.\r\nHe must wait, forsooth, till the people come up to it and agree with\r\nhim! This libel on liberty goes on to say that the want of right to\r\nspeak as we think is an evil inseparable from republican institutions!\r\nIf this be so, what are they worth? Welcome the despotism of the Sultan,\r\nwhere one knows what he may publish and what he may not, rather than the\r\ntyranny of this many-headed monster, the mob, where we know not what we\r\nmay do or say, till some fellow-citizen has tried it, and paid for the\r\nlesson with his life. This clerical absurdity chooses as a check for the\r\nabuses of the press, not the law, but the dread of a mob. By so doing,\r\nit deprives not only the individual and the minority of their rights,\r\nbut the majority also, since the expression of their opinion may\r\nsometime provoke disturbances from the minority. A few men may make a\r\nmob as well as many. The majority then, have no right, as Christian men,\r\nto utter their sentiments, if by any possibility it may lead to a mob!\r\nShades of Hugh Peters and John Cotton, save us from such pulpits!\r\n\r\nImprudent to defend the liberty of the press! Why? Because the defence\r\nwas unsuccessful? Does success gild crime into patriotism, and the want\r\nof it change heroic self-devotion to imprudence? Was Hampden imprudent\r\nwhen he drew the sword and threw away the scabbard? Yet he, judged by\r\nthat single hour, was unsuccessful. After a short exile, the race he\r\nhated sat again upon the throne.\r\n\r\nImagine yourself present when the first news of Bunker Hill battle\r\nreached a New England town. The tale would have run thus: \"The patriots\r\nare routed,--the redcoats victorious, Warren lies dead upon the field.\"\r\nWith what scorn would that Tory have been received, who should have\r\ncharged Warren with imprudence! who should have said that, bred a\r\nphysician, he was \"out of place\" in that battle, and \"died as the fool\r\ndieth.\" How would the intimation have been received, that Warren and his\r\nassociates should have merited a better time? But if success be indeed\r\nthe only criterion of prudence, _Respice finem_,--wait till the end!\r\n\r\n_Presumptuous_ to assert the freedom of the press on American ground! Is\r\nthe assertion of such freedom before the age? So much before the age as\r\nto leave one no right to make it because it displeases the community?\r\nWho invents this libel on his country? It is this very thing which\r\nentitles Lovejoy to greater praise. The disputed right which provoked\r\nthe Revolution--taxation without representation--is far beneath that\r\nfor which he died. [Here there was a general expression of strong\r\ndisapprobation.] One word, gentlemen. As much as thought is better than\r\nmoney, so much is the cause in which Lovejoy died nobler than a mere\r\nquestion of taxes. James Otis thundered in this hall when the King did\r\nbut touch his pocket. Imagine, if you can, his indignant eloquence had\r\nEngland offered to put a gag upon his lips. The question that stirred\r\nthe Revolution touched our civil interests. This concerns us not only as\r\ncitizens, but as immortal beings. Wrapped up in its fate, saved or lost\r\nwith it, are not only the voice of the statesman, but the instructions\r\nof the pulpit and the progress of our faith.\r\n\r\nThe clergy, \"marvellously out of place\" where free speech is battled\r\nfor--liberty of speech on national sins! Does the gentleman remember\r\nthat freedom to preach was first gained, dragging in its train freedom\r\nto print? I thank the clergy here present, as I reverence their\r\npredecessors, who did not so far forget their country in their immediate\r\nprofession as to deem it duty to separate themselves from the struggle\r\nof '76--the Mayhews and Coopers, who remembered that they were citizens\r\nbefore they were clergymen.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, from the bottom of my heart I thank that brave little band\r\nat Alton for resisting. We must remember that Lovejoy had fled from city\r\nto city,--suffered the destruction of three presses patiently. At length\r\nhe took counsel with friends, men of character, of tried integrity, of\r\nwide views, of Christian principle. They thought the crisis had come; it\r\nwas full time to assert the laws. They saw around them, not a community\r\nlike our own, of fixed habits, of character moulded and settled, but one\r\n\"in the gristle, not yet hardened into the bone of manhood.\" The\r\npeople there, children of our older States, seem to have forgotten the\r\nblood-tried principles of their fathers the moment they lost sight\r\nof our New England hills. Something was to be done to show them the\r\npriceless value of the freedom of the press, to bring back and set right\r\ntheir wandering and confused ideas. He and his advisers looked out on\r\na community, staggering like a drunken man, indifferent to their rights\r\nand confused in their feelings. Deaf to argument, haply they might\r\nbe stunned into sobriety. They saw that of which we cannot judge, the\r\nnecessity of resistance. Insulted law called for it. Public opinion,\r\nfast hastening on the downward course, must be arrested.\r\n\r\nDoes not the event show they judged rightly? Absorbed in a thousand\r\ntrifles, how has the nation all at once come to a stand? Men begin, as\r\nin 1776 and 1640, to discuss principles, to weigh characters, to find\r\nout where they are. Haply we may awake before we are borne over the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nI am glad, sir, to see this crowded house, It is good for us to be here.\r\nWhen Liberty is in danger Faneuil Hall has the right, it is her duty, to\r\nstrike the key-note for these United States. I am glad, for one reason,\r\nthat remarks such as those to which I have alluded have been uttered\r\nhere. The passage of these resolutions, in spite of this opposition,\r\nled by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, will show more clearly,\r\nmore decisively, the deep indignation with which Boston regards this\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Q. Adams]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN 1767, DIED 1848.)\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTITUTIONAL WAR POWER OVER SLAVERY\r\n\r\n--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MAY 25, 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, then, Mr. Chairman, in the authority of Congress and of the\r\nExecutive, two classes of powers, altogether different in their nature,\r\nand often incompatible with each other--the war power and the peace\r\npower. The peace power is limited by regulations and restricted by\r\nprovisions, prescribed within the constitution itself. The war power is\r\nlimited only by the laws and usages of nations. The power is tremendous;\r\nit is strictly constitutional, but it breaks down every barrier so\r\nanxiously erected for the protection of liberty, of property, and\r\nof life. This, sir, is the power which authorizes you to pass the\r\nresolution now before you, and, in my opinion, there is no other.\r\n\r\nAnd this, sir, is the reason which I was not permitted to give this\r\nmorning for voting with only eight associates against the first\r\nresolution reported by the committee on the abolition petitions; not one\r\nword of discussion had been permitted on either of those resolutions.\r\nWhen called to vote upon the first of them, I asked only five minutes of\r\nthe time of the House to prove that it was utterly unfounded, It was not\r\nthe pleasure of the House to grant me those five minutes. Sir, I must\r\nsay that, in all the proceedings of the House upon that report, from the\r\nprevious question, moved and inflexibly persisted in by a member of\r\nthe committee itself which reported the resolutions, (Mr. Owens, of\r\nGeorgia,) to the refusal of the Speaker, sustained by the majority of\r\nthe House, to permit the other gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Glascock) to\r\nrecord upon the journal his reasons for asking to be excused from voting\r\non that same resolution, the freedom of debate has been stifled in this\r\nHouse to a degree far beyond any thing that ever happened since\r\nthe existence of the Constitution of the United States; nor is it a\r\nconsolatory reflection to me how intensely we have been made to feel,\r\nin the process of that operation, that the Speaker of this House is a\r\nslaveholder. And, sir, as I was not then permitted to assign my reasons\r\nfor voting against that resolution before I gave the vote, I rejoice\r\nthat the reason for which I shall vote for the resolution now before the\r\ncommittee is identically the same with that for which I voted against\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Adams at this, and at many other passages of this speech, was\r\ninterrupted by calls to order. The Chairman of the Committee (Mr. A. H.\r\nShepperd, of North Carolina,) in every instance, decided that he was not\r\nout of order, but at this passage intimated that he was approaching\r\nvery close upon its borders; upon which Mr. Adams said, \"Then I am to\r\nunder-stand, sir, that I am yet within the bounds of order, but that I\r\nmay transcend them hereafter.\"]\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnd, now, sir, am I to be disconcerted and silenced, or admonished by\r\nthe Chair that I am approaching to irrelevant matter, which may warrant\r\nhim to arrest me in my argument, because I say that the reason for which\r\nI shall vote for the resolution now before the committee, levying a\r\nheavy contribution upon the property of my constituents, is identically\r\nthe same with the reason for which I voted against the resolution\r\nreported by the slavery committee, that Congress have no authority to\r\ninterfere, in any way, with slavery in any of the States of this Union.\r\nSir, I was not allowed to give my reasons for that vote, and a majority\r\nof my constituents, perhaps proportionately as large as that of this\r\nHouse in favor of that resolution, may and probably will disapprove my\r\nvote against, unless my reasons for so voting should be explained to\r\nthem. I asked but five minutes of the House to give those reasons, and\r\nwas refused. I shall, therefore, take the liberty to give them now, as\r\nthey are strictly applicable to the measure now before the Committee,\r\nand are my only justification for voting in favor of this resolution.\r\n\r\nI return, then, to my first position, that there are two classes of\r\npowers vested by the Constitution of the United States in their Congress\r\nand Executive Government: the powers to be exercised in the time of\r\npeace, and the powers incidental to war. That the powers of peace are\r\nlimited by provisions within the body of the Constitution itself, but\r\nthat the powers of war are limited and regulated only by the laws and\r\nusages of nations. There are, indeed, powers of peace conferred upon\r\nCongress, which also come within the scope and jurisdiction of the laws\r\nof nations, such as the negotiation of treaties of amity and commerce,\r\nthe interchange of public ministers and consuls, and all the personal\r\nand social intercourse between the individual inhabitants of the United\r\nStates and foreign nations, and the Indian tribes, which require the\r\ninterposition of any law. But the powers of war are all regulated by the\r\nlaws of nations, and are subject to no other limitation. It is by this\r\npower that I am justified in voting the money of my constituents for\r\nthe immediate relief of their fellow-citizens suffering with extreme\r\nnecessity even for subsistence, by the direct consequence of an\r\nIndian war. Upon the same principle, your consuls in foreign ports are\r\nauthorized to provide for the subsistence of seamen in distress, and\r\neven for their passage to their own country.\r\n\r\nAnd it was upon that same principle that I voted against the\r\nresolution reported by the slavery committee, \"That Congress possess no\r\nconstitutional authority to interfere, in any way, with the institution\r\nof slavery in any of the States of this confederacy,\" to which\r\nresolution most of those with whom I usually concur, and even my own\r\ncolleagues in this House, gave their assent. I do not admit that there\r\nis even among the peace powers of Congress no such authority; but in war\r\nthere are many ways by which Congress not only have the authority, but\r\nare bound to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States.\r\nThe existing law prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United\r\nStates from foreign countries, is itself an interference with the\r\ninstitution of slavery in the States. It was so considered by the\r\nfounders of the Constitution of the United States, in which it was\r\nstipulated that Congress should not interfere, in that way, with the\r\ninstitution, prior to the year 1808.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war with Great Britain the military and naval commanders\r\nof that nation issued proclamations inviting the slaves to repair to\r\ntheir standards, with promises of freedom and of settlement in some of\r\nthe British colonial establishments. This, surely, was an interference\r\nwith the institution of slavery in the States. By the treaty of peace,\r\nGreat Britain stipulated to evacuate all the forts and places in the\r\nUnited States, without carrying away any slaves. If the Government of\r\nthe United States had no authority to interfere, in any way, with\r\nthe institution of slavery in the States, they would not have had\r\nthe authority to require this stipulation. It is well known that\r\nthis engagement was not fulfilled by the British naval and military\r\ncommanders; that, on the contrary, they did carry away all the slaves\r\nwhom they had induced to join them, and that the British Government\r\ninflexibly refused to restore any of them to their masters; that a claim\r\nof indemnity was consequently instituted in behalf of the owners of the\r\nslaves, and was successfully maintained. All that series of transactions\r\nwas an interference by Congress with the institution of slavery in the\r\nStates in one way--in the way of protection and support. It was by the\r\ninstitution of slavery alone that the restitution of slaves enticed by\r\nproclamations into the British service could be claimed as property.\r\nBut for the institution of slavery, the British commanders could neither\r\nhave allured them to their standard, nor restored them otherwise than\r\nas liberated prisoners of war. But for the institution of slavery, there\r\ncould have been no stipulation that they should not be carried away\r\nas property, nor any claim of indemnity for the violation of that\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nBut the war power of Congress over the institution of slavery in the\r\nStates is yet far more extensive. Suppose the case of a servile war,\r\ncomplicated, as to some extent it is even now, with an Indian war;\r\nsuppose Congress were called to raise armies, to supply money from the\r\nwhole Union, to suppress a servile insurrection: would they have no\r\nauthority to interfere with the institution of slavery? The issue of a\r\nservile war may be disastrous. By war the slave may emancipate himself;\r\nit may become necessary for the master to recognize his emancipation by\r\na treaty of peace; can it for an instant be pretended that Congress,\r\nin such a contingency, would have no authority to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery, in any way, in the States? Why, it would be\r\nequivalent to saying that Congress have no constitutional authority to\r\nmake peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John C. Calhoun]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN C. CALHOUN,\r\n\r\nOF SOUTh CAROLINA (BORN 1782, DIED 1850.)\r\n\r\nON THE SLAVERY QUESTION,\r\n\r\nSENATE, MARCH 4, 1850\r\n\r\n\r\nI have, Senators, believed from the first that the agitation of the\r\nsubject of slavery would, if not prevented by some timely and effective\r\nmeasure, end in disunion. Entertaining this opinion, I have, on all\r\nproper occasions, endeavored to call the attention of both the two great\r\nparties which divide the country to adopt some measure to prevent so\r\ngreat a disaster, but without success. The agitation has been permitted\r\nto proceed, with almost no attempt to resist it, until it has reached a\r\npoint when it can no longer be disguised or denied that the Union is in\r\ndanger. You have thus had forced upon you the greatest and the gravest\r\nquestion that can ever come under your consideration: How can the Union\r\nbe preserved?\r\n\r\nTo give a satisfactory answer to this mighty question, it is\r\nindispensable to have an accurate and thorough knowledge of the nature\r\nand the character of the cause by which the Union is endangered. Without\r\nsuch knowledge it is impossible to pronounce, with any certainty, by\r\nwhat measure it can be saved; just as it would be impossible for a\r\nphysician to pronounce, in the case of some dangerous disease, with any\r\ncertainty, by what remedy the patient could be saved, without similar\r\nknowledge of the nature and character of the cause which produced\r\nit. The first question, then, presented for consideration, in the\r\ninvestigation I propose to make, in order to obtain such knowledge, is:\r\nWhat is it that has endangered the Union?\r\n\r\nTo this question there can be but one answer: That the immediate\r\ncause is the almost universal discontent which pervades all the States\r\ncomposing the southern section of the Union. This widely-extended\r\ndiscontent is not of recent origin. It commenced with the agitation\r\nof the slavery question, and has been increasing ever since. The\r\nnext question, going one step further back, is: What has caused this\r\nwidely-diffused and almost universal discontent?\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose, as is by some, that it originated\r\nwith demagogues, who excited the discontent with the intention of aiding\r\ntheir personal advancement, or with the disappointed ambition of certain\r\npoliticians, who resorted to it as a means of retrieving their fortunes.\r\nOn the contrary, all the great political influences of the section were\r\narrayed against excitement, and exerted to the utmost to keep the people\r\nquiet. The great mass of the people of the South were divided, as in the\r\nother section, into Whigs and Democrats. The leaders and the presses of\r\nboth parties in the South were very solicitous to prevent excitement and\r\nto preserve quiet; because it was seen that the effects of the former\r\nwould necessarily tend to weaken, if not destroy, the political ties\r\nwhich united them with their respective parties in the other section.\r\nThose who know the strength of the party ties will readily appreciate\r\nthe immense force which this cause exerted against agitation, and in\r\nfavor of preserving quiet. But, great as it was, it was not sufficient\r\nto prevent the wide-spread discontent which now pervades the section.\r\nNo; some cause, far deeper and more powerful than the one supposed, must\r\nexist, to account for discontent so wide and deep. The question then\r\nrecurs: What is the cause of this discontent? It will be found in\r\nthe belief of the people of the Southern States, as prevalent as\r\nthe discontent itself, that they cannot remain, as things now are,\r\nconsistently with honor and safety, in the Union. The next question to\r\nbe considered is: What has caused this belief?\r\n\r\nOne of the causes is, undoubtedly, to be traced to the long-continued\r\nagitation of the slavery question on the part of the North, and the many\r\naggressions which they have made on the rights of the South during the\r\ntime. I will not enumerate them at present, as it will be done hereafter\r\nin its proper place.\r\n\r\nThere is another lying back of it--with which this is intimately\r\nconnected--that may be regarded as the great and primary cause. This is\r\nto be found in the fact, that the equilibrium between the two sections,\r\nin the Government as it stood when the Constitution was ratified and\r\nthe Government put in action, has been destroyed. At that time there was\r\nnearly a perfect equilibrium between the two, which afforded ample means\r\nto each to protect itself against the aggression of the other; but, as\r\nit now stands, one section has the exclusive power of controlling\r\nthe Government, which leaves the other without any adequate means of\r\nprotecting itself against its encroachment and oppression. To place\r\nthis subject distinctly before you, I have, Senators, prepared a brief\r\nstatistical statement, showing the relative weight of the two sections\r\nin the Government under the first census of 1790, and the last census of\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nAccording to the former, the population of the United States, including\r\nVermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee, which then were in their incipient\r\ncondition of becoming States, but were not actually admitted, amounted\r\nto 3,929,827. Of this number the Northern States had 1,997,899, and the\r\nSouthern 1,952,072, making a difference of only 45,827 in favor of the\r\nformer States.\r\n\r\nThe number of States, including Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee, were\r\nsixteen; of which eight, including Vermont, belonged to the northern\r\nsection, and eight, including Kentucky and Tennessee, to the\r\nsouthern,--making an equal division of the States between the two\r\nsections, under the first census. There was a small preponderance in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and in the Electoral College, in favor of the\r\nnorthern, owing to the fact that, according to the provisions of the\r\nConstitution, in estimating federal numbers five slaves count but three;\r\nbut it was too small to affect sensibly the perfect equilibrium which,\r\nwith that exception, existed at the time. Such was the equality of\r\nthe two sections when the States composing them agreed to enter into a\r\nFederal Union. Since then the equilibrium between them has been greatly\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the last census the aggregate population of the United\r\nStates amounted to 17,063,357, of which the northern section contained\r\n9,728,920, and the southern 7,334,437, making a difference in round\r\nnumbers, of 2,400,000. The number of States had increased from sixteen\r\nto twenty-six, making an addition of ten States. In the meantime\r\nthe position of Delaware had become doubtful as to which section she\r\nproperly belonged. Considering her as neutral, the Northern States will\r\nhave thirteen and the Southern States twelve, making a difference in\r\nthe Senate of two senators in favor of the former. According to the\r\napportionment under the census of 1840, there were two hundred and\r\ntwenty-three members of the House of Representatives, of which the\r\nNorth-ern States had one hundred and thirty-five, and the Southern\r\nStates (considering Delaware as neutral) eighty-seven, making a\r\ndifference in favor of the former in the House of Representatives of\r\nforty-eight. The difference in the Senate of two members, added to this,\r\ngives to the North in the Electoral College, a majority of fifty. Since\r\nthe census of 1840, four States have been added to the Union--Iowa,\r\nWisconsin, Florida, and Texas. They leave the difference in the Senate\r\nas it was when the census was taken; but add two to the side of the\r\nNorth in the House, making the present majority in the House in its\r\nfavor fifty, and in the Electoral College fifty-two.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole is to give the northern section a predominance\r\nin every department of the Government, and thereby concentrate in it\r\nthe two elements which constitute the Federal Government,--majority\r\nof States, and a majority of their population, estimated in federal\r\nnumbers. Whatever section concentrates the two in itself possesses the\r\ncontrol of the entire Government.\r\n\r\nBut we are just at the close of the sixth decade, and the commencement\r\nof the seventh. The census is to be taken this year, which must add\r\ngreatly to the decided preponderance of the North in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and in the Electoral College. The prospect is, also,\r\nthat a great increase will be added to its present preponderance in the\r\nSenate, during the period of the decade, by the addition of new States.\r\nTwo territories, Oregon and Minnesota, are already in progress, and\r\nstrenuous efforts are making to bring in three additional States' from\r\nthe territory recently conquered from Mexico; which, if successful, will\r\nadd three other States in a short time to the northern section, making\r\nfive States; and increasing the present number of its States from\r\nfifteen to twenty, and of its senators from thirty to forty. On the\r\ncontrary, there is not a single territory in progress in the southern\r\nsection, and no certainty that any additional State will be added to it\r\nduring the decade. The prospect then is, that the two sections in the\r\nsenate, should the effort now made to exclude the South from the newly\r\nacquired territories succeed, will stand before the end of the decade,\r\ntwenty Northern States to fourteen Southern (considering Delaware as\r\nneutral), and forty Northern senators to twenty-eight Southern. This\r\ngreat increase of senators, added to the great increase of members of\r\nthe House of Representatives and the Electoral College on the part of\r\nthe North, which must take place under the next decade, will effectually\r\nand irretrievably destroy the equilibrium which existed when the\r\nGovernment commenced.\r\n\r\nHad this destruction been the operation of time, without the\r\ninterference of Government, the South would have had no reason to\r\ncomplain; but such was not the fact. It was caused by the legislation\r\nof this Government, which was appointed as the common agent of all, and\r\ncharged with the protection of the interests and security of all. The\r\nlegislation by which it has been effected may be classed under three\r\nheads. The first is, that series of acts by which the South has been\r\nexcluded from the common territory belonging to all the States as\r\nmembers of the Federal Union--which have had the effect of extending\r\nvastly the portion allotted to the northern section, and restricting\r\nwithin narrow limits the portion left the South. the next consists\r\nin adopting a system of revenue and disbursements, by which an undue\r\nproportion of the burden of taxation has been imposed upon the South,\r\nand an undue proportion of its proceeds appropriated to the North;\r\nand the last is a system of political measures, by which the original\r\ncharacter of the Government has been radically changed. I propose to\r\nbestow upon each of these, in the order they stand, a few remarks, with\r\nthe view of showing that it is owing to the action of this Government\r\nthat the equilibrium between the two sections has been destroyed, and\r\nthe whole powers of the system centered in a sectional majority.\r\n\r\nThe first of the series of Acts by which the South was deprived of its\r\ndue share of the territories, originated with the confederacy which\r\npreceded the existence of this Government. It is to be found in the\r\nprovision of the ordinance of 1787. Its effect was to exclude the South\r\nentirely from that vast and fertile region which lies between the Ohio\r\nand the Mississippi rivers, now embracing five States and one Territory.\r\nThe next of the series is the Missouri compromise, which excluded the\r\nSouth from that large portion of Louisiana which lies north of 36° 30',\r\nexcepting what is included in the State of Missouri. The last of the\r\nseries excluded the South from the whole of Oregon Territory. All these,\r\nin the slang of the day, were what are called slave territories,' and\r\nnot free soil; that is, territories belonging to slaveholding powers and\r\nopen to the emigration of masters with their slaves. By these\r\nseveral Acts the South was excluded from one million two hundred and\r\nthirty-eight thousand and twenty-five square miles--an extent of country\r\nconsiderably exceeding the entire valley of the Mississippi. To the\r\nSouth was left the portion of the Territory of Louisiana lying south of\r\n36° 30', and the portion north of it included in the State of Missouri,\r\nwith the portion lying south of 36° 30' including the States of\r\nLouisiana and Arkansas, and the territory lying west of the latter, and\r\nsouth of 36° 30', called the Indian country. These, with the Territory\r\nof Florida, now the State, make, in the whole, two hundred and\r\neighty-three thousand five hundred and three square miles. To this must\r\nbe added the territory acquired with Texas. If the whole should be added\r\nto the southern section it would make an increase of three hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand five hundred and twenty, which would make the whole\r\nleft to the South six hundred and nine thousand and twenty-three. But a\r\nlarge part of Texas is still in contest between the two sections, which\r\nleaves it uncertain what will be the real extent of the proportion of\r\nterritory that may be left to the South.\r\n\r\nI have not included the territory recently acquired by the treaty with\r\nMexico. The North is making the most strenuous efforts to appropriate\r\nthe whole to herself, by excluding the South from every foot of it. If\r\nshe should succeed, it will add to that from which the South has already\r\nbeen excluded, 526,078 square miles, and would increase the whole which\r\nthe North has appropriated to herself, to 1,764,023, not including the\r\nportion that she may succeed in excluding us from in Texas. To sum up\r\nthe whole, the United States, since they declared their independence,\r\nhave acquired 2,373,046 square miles of territory, from which the North\r\nwill have excluded the South, if she should succeed in monopolizing the\r\nnewly acquired territories, about three fourths of the whole, leaving to\r\nthe South but about one fourth.\r\n\r\nSuch is the first and great cause that has destroyed the equilibrium\r\nbetween the two sections in the Government.\r\n\r\nThe next is the system of revenue and disbursements which has been\r\nadopted by the Government. It is well known that the Government has\r\nderived its revenue mainly from duties on imports. I shall not undertake\r\nto show that such duties must necessarily fall mainly on the exporting\r\nStates, and that the South, as the great exporting portion of the Union,\r\nhas in reality paid vastly more than her due proportion of the revenue;\r\nbecause I deem it unnecessary, as the subject has on so many occasions\r\nbeen fully discussed. Nor shall I, for the same reason, undertake to\r\nshow that a far greater portion of the revenue has been disbursed at the\r\nNorth, than its due share; and that the joint effect of these causes\r\nhas been, to transfer a vast amount from South to North, which, under an\r\nequal system of revenue and disbursements, would not have been lost to\r\nher. If to this be added, that many of the duties were imposed, not for\r\nrevenue, but for protection,--that is, intended to put money, not in\r\nthe treasury, but directly into the pockets of the manufacturers,--some\r\nconception may be formed of the immense amount which, in the long course\r\nof sixty years, has been transferred from South to North. There are no\r\ndata by which it can be estimated with any certainty; but it is safe to\r\nsay that it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars. Under the most\r\nmoderate estimate, it would be sufficient to add greatly to the wealth\r\nof the North, and thus greatly increase her population by attracting\r\nemigration from all quarters to that section.\r\n\r\nThis, combined with the great primary cause, amply explains why the\r\nNorth has acquired a preponderance in every department of the Government\r\nby its disproportionate increase of population and States. The former,\r\nas has been shown, has increased, in fifty years, 2,400,000 over that\r\nof the South. This increase of population, during so long a period,\r\nis satisfactorily accounted for, by the number of emigrants, and the\r\nincrease of their descendants, which have been attracted to the northern\r\nsection from Europe and the South, in consequence of the advantages\r\nderived from the causes assigned. If they had not existed--if the South\r\nhad retained all the capital which had been extracted from her by the\r\nfiscal action of the Government; and, if it had not been excluded by\r\nthe ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri compromise, from the region lying\r\nbetween the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers, and between the Mississippi\r\nand the Rocky Mountains north of 36° 30'--it scarcely admits of a\r\ndoubt, that it would have divided the emigration with the North, and\r\nby retaining her own people, would have at least equalled the North in\r\npopulation under the census of 1840, and probably under that about to\r\nbe taken. She would also, if she had retained her equal rights in those\r\nterritories, have maintained an equality in the number of States with\r\nthe North, and have preserved the equilibrium between the two sections\r\nthat existed at the commencement of the Government. The loss, then, of\r\nthe equilibrium is to be attributed to the action of this Government.\r\n\r\nBut while these measures were destroying the equilibrium between the two\r\nsections, the action of the Government was leading to a radical change\r\nin its character, by concentrating all the power of the system in\r\nitself. The occasion will not permit me to trace the measures by which\r\nthis great change has been consummated. If it did, it would not be\r\ndifficult to show that the process commenced at an early period of the\r\nGovernment; and that it proceeded, almost without interruption, step by\r\nstep, until it virtually absorbed its entire powers; but without\r\ngoing through the whole process to establish the fact, it may be done\r\nsatisfactorily by a very short statement.\r\n\r\nThat the Government claims, and practically maintains, the right to\r\ndecide in the last resort, as to the extent of its powers, will scarcely\r\nbe denied by any one conversant with the political history of the\r\ncountry. That it also claims the right to resort to force to maintain\r\nwhatever power it claims against all opposition is equally certain.\r\nIndeed it is apparent, from what we daily hear, that this has become the\r\nprevailing and fixed opinion of a great majority of the community.\r\nNow, I ask, what limitation can possibly be placed upon the powers of a\r\ngovernment claiming and exercising such rights? And, if none can be,\r\nhow can the separate governments of the States maintain and protect\r\nthe powers reserved to them by the Constitution--or the people of the\r\nseveral States maintain those which are reserved to them, and among\r\nothers, the sovereign powers by which they ordained and established, not\r\nonly their separate State Constitutions and Governments, but also the\r\nConstitution and Government of the United States? But, if they have no\r\nconstitutional means of maintaining them against the right claimed by\r\nthis Government, it necessarily follows, that they hold them at its\r\npleasure and discretion, and that all the powers of the system are in\r\nreality concentrated in it. It also follows, that the character of the\r\nGovernment has been changed in consequence, from a federal republic, as\r\nit originally came from the hands of its framers, into a great\r\nnational consolidated democracy. It has indeed, at present, all the\r\ncharacteristics of the latter, and not of the former, although it still\r\nretains its outward form.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole of those causes combined is, that the North has\r\nacquired a decided ascendency over every department of this Government,\r\nand through it a control over all the powers of the system. A single\r\nsection governed by the will of the numerical majority, has now, in\r\nfact, the control of the Government and the entire powers of the system.\r\nWhat was once a constitutional federal republic, is now converted, in\r\nreality, into one as absolute as that of the Autocrat of Russia, and as\r\ndespotic in its tendency as any absolute government that ever existed.\r\n\r\nAs, then, the North has the absolute control over the Government, it is\r\nmanifest that on all questions between it and the South, where there is\r\na diversity of interests, the interest of the latter will be sacrificed\r\nto the former, however oppressive the effects may be; as the South\r\npossesses no means by which it can resist, through the action of the\r\nGovernment. But if there was no question of vital importance to the\r\nSouth, in reference to which there was a diversity of views between the\r\ntwo sections, this state of things might be endured without the hazard\r\nof destruction to the South. But such is not the fact. There is a\r\nquestion of vital importance to the southern section, in reference to\r\nwhich the views and feelings of the two sections are as opposite and\r\nhostile as they can possibly be.\r\n\r\nI refer to the relation between the two races in the southern section,\r\nwhich constitutes a vital portion of her social organization. Every\r\nportion of the North entertains views and feelings more or less hostile\r\nto it. Those most opposed and hostile, regard it as a sin, and consider\r\nthemselves under the most sacred obligation to use every effort to\r\ndestroy it. Indeed, to the extent that they conceive that they have\r\npower, they regard themselves as implicated in the sin, and responsible\r\nfor not suppressing it by the use of all and every means. Those\r\nless opposed and hostile, regarded it as a crime--an offence against\r\nhumanity, as they call it; and, although not so fanatical, feel\r\nthemselves bound to use all efforts to effect the same object; while\r\nthose who are least opposed and hostile, regard it as a blot and a\r\nstain on the character of what they call the Nation, and feel themselves\r\naccordingly bound to give it no countenance or support. On the contrary,\r\nthe southern section regards the relation as one which cannot be\r\ndestroyed without subjecting the two races to the greatest calamity, and\r\nthe section to poverty, desolation, and wretchedness; and accordingly\r\nthey feel bound, by every consideration of interest and safety, to\r\ndefend it.\r\n\r\nThis hostile feeling on the part of the North toward the social\r\norganization of the South long lay dormant, and it only required some\r\ncause to act on those who felt most intensely that they were responsible\r\nfor its continuance, to call it into action. The increasing power of\r\nthis Government, and of the control of the northern section over all its\r\ndepartments, furnished the cause. It was this which made the impression\r\non the minds of many, that there was little or no restraint to prevent\r\nthe Government from doing whatever it might choose to do. This was\r\nsufficient of itself to put the most fanatical portion of the North in\r\naction, for the purpose of destroying the existing relation between the\r\ntwo races in the South.\r\n\r\nThe first organized movement toward it commenced in 1835. Then, for the\r\nfirst time, societies were organized, presses established, lecturers\r\nsent forth to excite the people of the North, and incendiary\r\npublications scattered over the whole South, through the mail. The South\r\nwas thoroughly aroused. Meetings were held everywhere, and resolutions\r\nadopted, calling upon the North to apply a remedy to arrest the\r\nthreatened evil, and pledging themselves to adopt measures for their\r\nown protection, if it was not arrested. At the meeting of Congress,\r\npetitions poured in from the North, calling upon Congress to abolish\r\nslavery in the District of Columbia, and to prohibit, what they called,\r\nthe internal slave trade between the States--announcing at the same\r\ntime, that their ultimate object was to abolish slavery, not only in the\r\nDistrict, but in the States and throughout the Union. At this period,\r\nthe number engaged in the agitation was small, and possessed little or\r\nno personal influence.\r\n\r\nNeither party in Congress had, at that time, any sympathy with them or\r\ntheir cause. The members of each party presented their petitions with\r\ngreat reluctance. Nevertheless, small, and contemptible as the party\r\nthen was, both of the great parties of the North dreaded them. They\r\nfelt, that though small, they were organized in reference to a subject\r\nwhich had a great and commanding influence over the northern mind.\r\nEach party, on that account, feared to oppose their petitions, lest\r\nthe opposite party should take advantage of the one who might do so, by\r\nfavoring them. The effect was, that both united in insisting that the\r\npetitions should be received, and that Congress should take jurisdiction\r\nover the subject. To justify their course, they took the extraordinary\r\nground, that Congress was bound to receive petitions on every subject,\r\nhowever objectionable they might be, and whether they had, or had not,\r\njurisdiction over the subject. Those views prevailed in the House\r\nof Representatives, and partially in the Senate; and thus the party\r\nsucceeded in their first movements, in gaining what they proposed--a\r\nposition in Congress, from which agitation could be extended over the\r\nwhole Union. This was the commencement of the agitation, which has ever\r\nsince continued, and which, as is now acknowledged, has endangered the\r\nUnion itself.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I believed at that early period, if the party who got up\r\nthe petitions should succeed in getting Congress to take jurisdiction,\r\nthat agitation would follow, and that it would in the end, if not\r\narrested, destroy the Union. I then so expressed myself in debate, and\r\ncalled upon both parties to take grounds against assuming jurisdiction;\r\nbut in vain. Had my voice been heeded, and had Congress refused to take\r\njurisdiction, by the united votes of all parties, the agitation which\r\nfollowed would have been prevented, and the fanatical zeal that gave\r\nimpulse to the agitation, and which has brought us to our present\r\nperilous condition, would have become extinguished, from the want of\r\nfuel to feed the flame. That was the time for the North to have shown\r\nher devotion to the Union; but, unfortunately, both of the great\r\nparties of that section were so intent on obtaining or retaining party\r\nascendency, that all other considerations were overlooked or forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhat has since followed are but natural consequences. With the success\r\nof their first movement, this small fanatical party began to acquire\r\nstrength; and with that, to become an object of courtship to both the\r\ngreat parties. The necessary consequence was, a further increase of\r\npower, and a gradual tainting of the opinions of both the other parties\r\nwith their doctrines,until the infection has extended over both; and the\r\ngreat mass of the population of the North, who, whatever may be their\r\nopinion of the original abolition party, which still preserves its\r\ndistinctive organization, hardly ever fail, when it comes to acting,\r\nto cooperate in carrying out their measures. With the increase of their\r\ninfluence, they extended the sphere of their action. In a short time\r\nafter the commencement of their first movement, they had acquired\r\nsufficient influence to induce the legislatures of most of the Northern\r\nStates to pass acts, which in effect abrogated the clause of the\r\nConstitution that provides for the delivery up of fugitive slaves. Not\r\nlong after, petitions followed to abolish slavery in forts, magazines,\r\nand dock-yards, and all other places where Congress had exclusive\r\npower of legislation. This was followed by petitions and resolutions of\r\nlegislatures of the Northern States, and popular meetings, to exclude\r\nthe Southern States from all territories acquired, or to be acquired,\r\nand to prevent the admission of any State hereafter into the Union,\r\nwhich, by its constitution, does not prohibit slavery. And Congress is\r\ninvoked to do all this, expressly with the view of the final abolition\r\nof slavery in the States. That has been avowed to be the ultimate object\r\nfrom the beginning of the agitation until the present time; and yet the\r\ngreat body of both parties of the North, with the full knowledge of the\r\nfact, although disavowing the abolitionists, have co-operated with them\r\nin almost all their measures.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief history of the agitation, as far as it has yet advanced.\r\nNow I ask, Senators, what is there to prevent its further progress,\r\nuntil it fulfils the ultimate end proposed, unless some decisive measure\r\nshould be adopted to prevent it? Has any one of the causes, which has\r\nadded to its increase from its original small and contemptible beginning\r\nuntil it has attained its present magnitude, diminished in force? Is the\r\noriginal cause of the movement--that slavery is a sin, and ought to be\r\nsuppressed--weaker now than at the commencement? Or is the abolition\r\nparty less numerous or influential, or have they less influence with,\r\nor less control over the two great parties of the North in elections? Or\r\nhas the South greater means of influencing or controlling the movements\r\nof this Government now, than it had when the agitation commenced? To\r\nall these questions but one answer can be given: No, no, no. The very\r\nreverse is true. Instead of being weaker, all the elements in favor\r\nof agitation are stronger now than they were in 1835, when it first\r\ncommenced, while all the elements of influence on the part of the South\r\nare weaker. Unless something decisive is done, I again ask, what is\r\nto stop this agitation, before the great and final object at which it\r\naims--the abolition of slavery in the States--is consummated? Is it,\r\nthen, not certain, that if something is not done to arrest it, the South\r\nwill be forced to choose between abolition and secession? Indeed, as\r\nevents are now moving, it will not require the South to secede, in order\r\nto dissolve the Union. Agitation will of itself effect it, of which its\r\npast history furnishes abundant proof--as I shall next proceed to show.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that disunion can be effected by a\r\nsingle blow. The cords which bound these States together in one common\r\nUnion, are far too numerous and powerful for that. Disunion must be the\r\nwork of time. It is only through a long process, and successively, that\r\nthe cords can be snapped, until the whole fabric falls asunder. Already\r\nthe agitation of the slavery question has snapped some of the most\r\nimportant, and has greatly weakened all the others, as I shall proceed\r\nto show.\r\n\r\nThe cords that bind the States together are not only many, but various\r\nin character. Some are spiritual or ecclesiastical; some political;\r\nothers social. Some appertain to the benefit conferred by the Union, and\r\nothers to the feeling of duty and obligation.\r\n\r\nThe strongest of those of a spiritual and ecclesiastical nature,\r\nconsisted in the unity of the great religious denominations, all of\r\nwhich originally embraced the whole Union. All these denominations, with\r\nthe exception, perhaps, of the Catholics, were organized very much upon\r\nthe principle of our political institutions. Beginning with smaller\r\nmeetings, corresponding with the political divisions of the country,\r\ntheir organization terminated in one great central assemblage,\r\ncorresponding very much with the character of Congress. At these\r\nmeetings the principal clergymen and lay members of the respective\r\ndenominations from all parts of the Union, met to transact business\r\nrelating to their common concerns. It was not confined to what\r\nappertained to the doctrines and discipline of the respective\r\ndenominations, but extended to plans for disseminating the\r\nBible--establishing missions, distributing tracts--and of establishing\r\npresses for the publication of tracts, newspapers, and periodicals, with\r\na view of diffusing religious information--and for the support of their\r\nrespective doctrines and creeds. All this combined contributed\r\ngreatly to strengthen the bonds of the Union. The ties which held each\r\ndenomination together formed a strong cord to hold the whole Union\r\ntogether, but, powerful as they were, they have not been able to resist\r\nthe explosive effect of slavery agitation.\r\n\r\nThe first of these cords which snapped, under its explosive force, was\r\nthat of the powerful Methodist Episcopal Church. The numerous and strong\r\nties which held it together, are all broken, and its unity is gone. They\r\nnow form separate churches; and, instead of that feeling of attachment\r\nand devotion to the interests of the whole church which was formerly\r\nfelt, they are now arrayed into two hostile bodies, engaged in\r\nlitigation about what was formerly their common property.\r\n\r\nThe next cord that snapped was that of the Baptists--one of the largest\r\nand most respectable of the denominations. That of the Presbyterian is\r\nnot entirely snapped, but some of its strands have given way. That\r\nof the Episcopal Church is the only one of the four great Protestant\r\ndenominations which remains unbroken and entire.\r\n\r\nThe strongest cord, of a political character, consists of the many and\r\npowerful ties that have held together the two great parties which have,\r\nwith some modifications, existed from the beginning of the Government.\r\nThey both extended to every portion of the Union, and strongly\r\ncontributed to hold all its parts together. But this powerful cord has\r\nfared no better than the spiritual. It resisted, for a long time, the\r\nexplosive tendency of the agitation, but has finally snapped under its\r\nforce--if not entirely, in a great measure. Nor is there one of the\r\nremaining cords which has not been greatly weakened. To this extent the\r\nUnion has already been destroyed by agitation, in the only way it can\r\nbe, by sundering and weakening the cords which bind it together.\r\n\r\nIf the agitation goes on, the same force, acting with increased\r\nintensity, as has been shown, will finally snap every cord, when nothing\r\nwill be left to hold the States together except force. But, surely, that\r\ncan, with no propriety of language, be called a Union, when the only\r\nmeans by which the weaker is held connected with the stronger portion\r\nis force. It may, indeed, keep them connected; but the connection will\r\npartake much more of the character of subjugation, on the part of the\r\nweaker to the stronger, than the union of free, independent States, in\r\none confederation, as they stood in the early stages of the Government,\r\nand which only is worthy of the sacred name of Union.\r\n\r\nHaving now, Senators, explained what it is that endangers the Union,\r\nand traced it to its cause, and explained its nature and character, the\r\nquestion again recurs, How can the Union be saved? To this I answer,\r\nthere is but one way by which it can be, and that is by adopting such\r\nmeasures as will satisfy the States belonging to the southern section,\r\nthat they can remain in the Union consistently with their honor and\r\ntheir safety. There is, again, only one way by which this can be\r\neffected, and that is by removing the causes by which this belief has\r\nbeen produced. Do this, and discontent will cease, harmony and kind\r\nfeelings between the sections be restored, and every apprehension of\r\ndanger to the Union be removed. The question, then, is, How can this be\r\ndone? But, before I undertake to answer this question, I propose to show\r\nby what the Union cannot be saved.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, then, be saved by eulogies on the Union, however splendid\r\nor numerous. The cry of \"Union, Union, the glorious Union!\" can no more\r\nprevent disunion than the cry of \"Health, health, glorious health!\" on\r\nthe part of the physician, can save a patient lying dangerously ill. So\r\nlong as the Union, instead of being regarded as a protector, is regarded\r\nin the opposite character, by not much less than a majority of the\r\nStates, it will be in vain to attempt to conciliate them by pronouncing\r\neulogies on it.\r\n\r\nBesides, this cry of Union comes commonly from those whom we cannot\r\nbelieve to be sincere. It usually comes from our assailants. But we\r\ncannot believe them to be sincere; for, if they loved the Union,\r\nthey would necessarily be devoted to the Constitution. It made the\r\nUnion,--and to destroy the Constitution would be to destroy the\r\nUnion. But the only reliable and certain evidence of devotion to the\r\nConstitution is to abstain, on the one hand, from violating it, and\r\nto repel, on the other, all attempts to violate it. It is only by\r\nfaithfully performing these high duties that the Constitution can be\r\npreserved, and with it the Union.\r\n\r\nBut how stands the profession of devotion to the Union by our\r\nassailants, when brought to this test? Have they abstained from\r\nviolating the Constitution? Let the many acts passed by the Northern\r\nStates to set aside and annul the clause of the Constitution providing\r\nfor the delivery up of fugitive slaves answer. I cite this, not that\r\nit is the only instance (for there are many others), but because the\r\nviolation in this particular is too notorious and palpable to be denied.\r\nAgain: Have they stood forth faithfully to repel violations of the\r\nConstitution? Let their course in reference to the agitation of the\r\nslavery question, which was commenced and has been carried on for\r\nfifteen years, avowedly for the purpose of abolishing slavery in the\r\nStates--an object all acknowledged to be unconstitutional,--answer. Let\r\nthem show a single instance, during this long period, in which they have\r\ndenounced the agitators or their attempts to effect what is admitted to\r\nbe unconstitutional, or a single measure which they have brought forward\r\nfor that purpose. How can we, with all these facts before us, believe\r\nthat they are sincere in their profession of devotion to the Union, or\r\navoid believing their profession is but intended to increase the vigor\r\nof their assaults and to weaken the force of our resistance?\r\n\r\nNor can we regard the profession of devotion to the Union, on the part\r\nof those who are not our assailants, as sincere, when they pronounce\r\neulogies upon the Union, evidently with the intent of charging us\r\nwith disunion, without uttering one word of denunciation against our\r\nassailants. If friends of the Union, their course should be to unite\r\nwith us in repelling these assaults, and denouncing the authors as\r\nenemies of the Union. Why they avoid this, and pursue the course they\r\ndo, it is for them to explain.\r\n\r\nNor can the Union be saved by invoking the name of the illustrious\r\nSoutherner whose mortal remains repose on the western bank of the\r\nPotomac. He was one of us,--a slave-holder and a planter. We have\r\nstudied his history, and find nothing in it to justify submission to\r\nwrong. On the contrary, his great fame rests on the solid foundation,\r\nthat, while he was careful to avoid doing wrong to others, he was\r\nprompt and decided in repelling wrong. I trust that, in this respect, we\r\nprofited by his example.\r\n\r\nNor can we find any thing in his history to deter us from seceding\r\nfrom the Union, should it fail to fulfil the objects for which it was\r\ninstituted, by being permanently and hopelessly converted into the means\r\nof oppressing instead of protecting us. On the contrary, we find much\r\nin his example to encourage us, should we be forced to the extremity of\r\ndeciding between submission and disunion.\r\n\r\nThere existed then, as well as now, a union--between the parent country\r\nand her colonies. It was a union that had much to endear it to the\r\npeople of the colonies. Under its protecting and superintending care,\r\nthe colonies were planted and grew up and prospered, through a long\r\ncourse of years, until they be-came populous and wealthy. Its benefits\r\nwere not limited to them. Their extensive agricultural and other\r\nproductions, gave birth to a flourishing commerce, which richly rewarded\r\nthe parent country for the trouble and expense of establishing and\r\nprotecting them. Washing-ton was born and grew up to manhood under that\r\nUnion. He acquired his early distinction in its service, and there is\r\nevery reason to believe that he was devotedly attached to it. But his\r\ndevotion was a national one. He was attached to it, not as an end, but\r\nas a means to an end. When it failed to fulfil its end, and, instead\r\nof affording protection, was converted into the means of oppressing\r\nthe colonies, he did not hesitate to draw his sword, and head the great\r\nmovement by which that union was forever severed, and the independence\r\nof these States established. This was the great and crowning glory\r\nof his life, which has spread his fame over the whole globe, and will\r\ntransmit it to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\nNor can the plan proposed by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky,\r\nnor that of the administration, save the Union. I shall pass by,\r\nwithout remark, the plan proposed by the Senator. I, however, assure\r\nthe distinguished and able Senator, that, in taking this course, no\r\ndisrespect whatever is intended to him or to his plan. I have adopted\r\nit because so many Senators of distinguished abilities, who were present\r\nwhen he delivered his speech, and explained his plan, and who were fully\r\ncapable to do justice to the side they support, have replied to\r\nhim. * * *\r\n\r\nHaving now shown what cannot save the Union, I return to the question\r\nwith which I commenced, How can the Union be saved? There is but one\r\nway by which it can with any certainty; and that is, by a full and final\r\nsettlement, on the principle of justice, of all the questions at issue\r\nbetween the two sections. The South asks for justice, simple justice,\r\nand less she ought not to take. She has no compromise to offer, but the\r\nConstitution; and no concession or surrender to make. She has already\r\nsurrendered so much that she has little left to surrender. Such a\r\nsettlement would go to the root of the evil, and remove all cause of\r\ndiscontent, by satisfying the South that she could remain honorably\r\nand safely in the Union, and thereby restore the harmony and fraternal\r\nfeelings between the sections, which existed anterior to the Missouri\r\nagitation. Nothing else can, with any certainty, finally and forever\r\nsettle the question at issue, terminate agitation, and save the Union.\r\n\r\nBut can this be done? Yes, easily; not by the weaker party, for it can,\r\nof itself do nothing,--not even protect itself--but by the stronger. The\r\nNorth has only to will it to accomplish it--to do justice by conceding\r\nto the South an equal right in the acquired territory, and to do her\r\nduty by causing the stipulations relative to fugitive slaves to be\r\nfaithfully fulfilled, to cease the agitation of the slave question, and\r\nto provide for the insertion of a provision in the Constitution, by an\r\namendment, which will restore to the South, in substance, the power\r\nshe possessed of protecting herself, before the equilibrium between the\r\nsections was destroyed by the action of this Government. There will be\r\nno difficulty in devising such a provision--one that will protect the\r\nSouth, and which, at the same time, will improve and strengthen the\r\nGovernment, instead of impairing and weakening it.\r\n\r\nBut will the North agree to this? It is for her to answer the question.\r\nBut, I will say, she cannot refuse, if she has half the love for the\r\nUnion which she professes to have, or without justly exposing herself to\r\nthe charge that her love of power and aggrandizement is far greater than\r\nher love of the Union. At all events the responsibility of saving the\r\nUnion rests on the North, and not on the South. The South cannot save\r\nit by any act of hers, and the North may save it without any sacrifice\r\nwhatever, unless to do justice, and to perform her duties under the\r\nConstitution, should be regarded by her as a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is time, Senators, that there should be an open and manly avowal on\r\nall sides, as to what is intended to be done. If the question is not now\r\nsettled, it is uncertain whether it ever can hereafter be; and we,\r\nas the representatives of the States of this Union, regarded as\r\ngovernments, should come to a distinct understanding as to our\r\nrespective views, in order to ascertain whether the great questions at\r\nissue can be settled or not. If you, who represent the stronger portion,\r\ncannot agree to settle on the broad principle of justice and duty, say\r\nso; and let the States we both represent agree to separate and part in\r\npeace. If you are unwilling we should part in peace, tell us so, and\r\nwe shall know what to do, when you reduce the question to submission or\r\nresistance. If you remain silent, you will compel us to infer by your\r\nacts what you intend. In that case, California will become the test\r\nquestion. If you admit her, under all the difficulties that oppose her\r\nadmission, you compel us to infer that you intend to exclude us from\r\nthe whole of the acquired territories, with the intention of destroying,\r\nirretrievably, the equilibrium between the two sections. We would be\r\nblind not to perceive in that case, that your real objects are power and\r\naggrandizement, and infatuated, not to act accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have now, Senators, done my duty in ex-pressing my opinions fully,\r\nfreely and candidly, on this solemn occasion. In doing so, I have been\r\ngoverned by the motives which have governed me in all the stages of the\r\nagitation of the slavery question since its commencement. I have exerted\r\nmyself, during the whole period, to arrest it, with the intention of\r\nsaving the Union, if it could be done; and if it could not, to save\r\nthe section where it has pleased Providence to cast my lot, and which I\r\nsincerely believe has justice and the Constitution on its side. Having\r\nfaithfully done my duty to the best of my ability, both to the Union and\r\nmy section, throughout this agitation, I shall have the consolation, let\r\nwhat will come, that I am free from all responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daniel Webster]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN, 1782, DIED, 1852.)\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNION;\r\n\r\nSENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, MARCH 7, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nI wish to speak to-day, not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a northern\r\nman, but as an American, and a member of the Senate of the United\r\nStates. It is fortunate that there is a Senate of the United States; a\r\nbody not yet moved from its propriety, nor lost to a just sense of its\r\nown dignity and its own high responsibilities, and a body to which\r\nthe country looks, with confidence, for wise, moderate, patriotic, and\r\nhealing counsels. It is not to be denied that we live in the midst of\r\nstrong agitations and are surrounded by very considerable dangers to\r\nour institutions and government. The imprisoned winds are let loose.\r\nThe East, the North, and the stormy South combine to throw the whole\r\nsea into commotion, to toss its billows to the skies, and disclose its\r\nprofoundest depths. I do not affect to regard myself, Mr. President,\r\nas holding, or fit to hold, the helm in this combat with the political\r\nelements; but I have a duty to perform, and I mean to perform it with\r\nfidelity, not without a sense of existing dangers, but not without\r\nhope. I have a part to act, not for my own security or safety, for I am\r\nlooking out for no fragment upon which to float away from the wreck, if\r\nwreck there must be, but for the good of the whole, and the preservation\r\nof all; and there is that which will keep me to my duty during this\r\nstruggle, whether the sun and the stars shall appear for many days. I\r\nspeak to-day for the preservation of the Union. \"Hear me for my\r\ncause.\" I speak to-day out of a solicitous and anxious heart, for the\r\nrestoration to the country of that quiet and that harmony which make the\r\nblessings of this Union so rich, and so dear to us all. These are the\r\ntopics that I propose to myself to discuss; these are the motives,\r\nand the sole motives, that influence me in the wish to communicate\r\nmy opinions to the Senate and the country; and if I can do any\r\nthing, however little, for the promotion of these ends, I shall have\r\naccomplished all that I expect.\r\n\r\n* * * We all know, sir, that slavery has existed in the world from time\r\nimmemorial. There was slavery in the earliest periods of history, among\r\nthe Oriental nations. There was slavery among the Jews; the theocratic\r\ngovernment of that people issued no injunction against it. There was\r\nslavery among the Greeks. * * * At the introduction of Christianity, the\r\nRoman world was full of slaves, and I suppose there is to be found no\r\ninjunction against that relation between man and man in the teachings\r\nof the Gospel of Jesus Christ or of any of his apostles. * * * Now, sir,\r\nupon the general nature and influence of slavery there exists a wide\r\ndifference of opinion between the northern portion of this country and\r\nthe southern. It is said on the one side, that, although not the subject\r\nof any injunction or direct prohibition in the New Testament, slavery\r\nis a wrong; that it is founded merely in the right of the strongest; and\r\nthat it is an oppression, like unjust wars, like all those conflicts by\r\nwhich a powerful nation subjects a weaker to its will; and that, in its\r\nnature, whatever may be said of it in the modifications which have taken\r\nplace, it is not according to the meek spirit of the Gospel. It is not\r\n\"kindly affectioned\"; it does not \"seek another's, and not its own\";\r\nit does not \"let the oppressed go free.\" These are sentiments that are\r\ncherished, and of late with greatly augmented force, among the people of\r\nthe Northern States. They have taken hold of the religious sentiment of\r\nthat part of the country, as they have, more or less, taken hold of the\r\nreligious feelings of a considerable portion of mankind. The South upon\r\nthe other side, having been accustomed to this relation between the two\r\nraces all their lives; from their birth, having been taught, in general,\r\nto treat the subjects of this bondage with care and kindness, and I\r\nbelieve, in general, feeling great kindness for them, have not taken\r\nthe view of the subject which I have mentioned. There are thousands of\r\nreligious men, with consciences as tender as any of their brethren at\r\nthe North, who do not see the unlawfulness of slavery; and there are\r\nmore thousands, perhaps, that, whatsoever they may think of it in its\r\norigin, and as a matter depending upon natural rights, yet take things\r\nas they are, and, finding slavery to be an established relation of the\r\nsociety in which they live, can see no way in which, let their opinions\r\non the abstract question be what they may, it is in the power of this\r\ngeneration to relieve themselves from this relation. And candor obliges\r\nme to say, that I believe they are just as conscientious many of them,\r\nand the religious people, all of them, as they are at the North who hold\r\ndifferent opinions. * * *\r\n\r\nThere are men who, with clear perceptions, as they think, of their own\r\nduty, do not see how too eager a pursuit of one duty may involve them in\r\nthe violation of others, or how too warm an embracement of one truth\r\nmay lead to a disregard of other truths just as important. As I heard it\r\nstated strongly, not many days ago, these persons are disposed to mount\r\nupon some particular duty, as upon a war-horse, and to drive furiously\r\non and upon and over all other duties that may stand in the way. There\r\nare men who, in reference to disputes of that sort, are of opinion that\r\nhuman duties may be ascertained with the exactness of mathematics. They\r\ndeal with morals as with mathematics; and they think what is right may\r\nbe distinguished from what is wrong with the precision of an algebraic\r\nequation. They have, therefore, none too much charity toward others who\r\ndiffer from them. They are apt, too, to think that nothing is good but\r\nwhat is perfect, and that there are no compromises or modifications to\r\nbe made in consideration of difference of opinion or in deference to\r\nother men's judgment. If their perspicacious vision enables them to\r\ndetect a spot on the face of the sun, they think that a good reason why\r\nthe sun should be struck down from heaven. They prefer the chance\r\nof running into utter darkness to living in heavenly light, if that\r\nheavenly light be not absolutely without any imperfection. * * *\r\n\r\nBut we must view things as they are. Slavery does exist in the\r\nUnited States. It did exist in the States before the adoption of this\r\nConstitution, and at that time. Let us, therefore, consider for a\r\nmoment what was the state of sentiment, North and South, in regard\r\nto slavery,--in regard to slavery, at the time this Constitution was\r\nadopted. A remarkable change has taken place since; but what did the\r\nwise and great men of all parts of the country think of slavery then? In\r\nwhat estimation did they hold it at the time when this Constitution was\r\nadopted? It will be found, sir, if we will carry ourselves by historical\r\nresearch back to that day, and ascertain men's opinions by authentic\r\nrecords still existing among us, that there was no diversity of opinion\r\nbetween the North and the South upon the subject of slavery. It will be\r\nfound that both parts of the country held it equally an evil, a moral\r\nand political evil. It will not be found that, either at the North or\r\nat the South, there was much, though there was some, invective against\r\nslavery as inhuman and cruel. The great ground of objection to it was\r\npolitical; that it weakened the social fabric; that, taking the place\r\nof free labor, society became less strong and labor less productive;\r\nand therefore we find from all the eminent men of the time the clearest\r\nexpression of their opinion that slavery is an evil. They ascribed its\r\nexistence here, not without truth, and not without some acerbity of\r\ntemper and force of language, to the injurious policy of the mother\r\ncountry, who, to favor the navigator, had entailed these evils upon the\r\ncolonies. * * * You observe, sir, that the term slave, or slavery, is\r\nnot used in the Constitution. The Constitution does not require that\r\n\"fugitive slaves\" shall be delivered up. It requires that persons held\r\nto service in one State, and escaping into another, shall be delivered\r\nup. Mr. Madison opposed the introduction of the term slave, or slavery,\r\ninto the Constitution; for he said, that he did not wish to see it\r\nrecognized by the Constitution of the United States of America that\r\nthere could be property in men. * * *\r\n\r\nHere we may pause. There was, if not an entire unanimity, a general\r\nconcurrence of sentiment running through the whole community, and\r\nespecially entertained by the eminent men of all parts of the country.\r\nBut soon a change began, at the North and the South, and a difference\r\nof opinion showed itself; the North growing much more warm and strong\r\nagainst slavery, and the South growing much more warm and strong in its\r\nsupport. Sir, there is no generation of mankind whose opinions are not\r\nsubject to be influenced by what appear to them to be their present\r\nemergent and exigent interests. I impute to the South no particularly\r\nselfish view in the change which has come over her. I impute to her\r\ncertainly no dishonest view. All that has happened has been natural.\r\nIt has followed those causes which always influence the human mind and\r\noperate upon it. What, then, have been the causes which have created so\r\nnew a feeling in favor of slavery in the South, which have changed the\r\nwhole nomenclature of the South on that subject, so that, from being\r\nthought and described in the terms I have mentioned and will not repeat,\r\nit has now become an institution, a cherished institution, in that\r\nquarter; no evil, no scourge, but a great religious, social, and moral\r\nblessing, as I think I have heard it latterly spoken of? I suppose this,\r\nsir, is owing to the rapid growth and sudden extension of the cotton\r\nplantations of the South. So far as any motive consistent with honor,\r\njustice, and general judgment could act, it was the cotton interest\r\nthat gave a new desire to promote slavery, to spread it, and to use its\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nI again say that this change was produced by causes which must always\r\nproduce like effects. The whole interest of the South became connected,\r\nmore or less, with the extension of slavery. If we look back to the\r\nhistory of the commerce of this country in the early years of this\r\ngovernment, what were our exports? Cotton was hardly, or but to a very\r\nlimited extent, known. In 1791 the first parcel of cotton of the growth\r\nof the United States was exported, and amounted only to 19,200 pounds.\r\nIt has gone on increasing rapidly, until the whole crop may now,\r\nperhaps, in a season of great product and high prices, amount to a\r\nhundred millions of dollars. In the years I have mentioned, there was\r\nmore of wax, more of indigo, more of rice, more of almost every article\r\nof export from the South, than of cotton. When Mr. Jay negotiated the\r\ntreaty of 1794 with England, it is evident from the Twelfth Article of\r\nthe Treaty, which was suspended by the Senate, that he did not know that\r\ncotton was exported at all from the United States.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSir, there is not so remarkable a chapter in our history of political\r\nevents, political parties, and political men as is afforded by this\r\nadmission of a new slave-holding territory, so vast that a bird cannot\r\nfly over it in a week. New England, as I have said, with some of her\r\nown votes, supported this measure. Three-fourths of the votes of\r\nliberty-loving Connecticut were given for it in the other house, and one\r\nhalf here. There was one vote for it from Maine but, I am happy to say,\r\nnot the vote of the honorable member who addressed the Senate the day\r\nbefore yesterday, and who was then a Representative from Maine in the\r\nHouse of Representatives; but there was one vote from Maine, ay, and\r\nthere was one vote for it from Massachusetts, given by a gentleman then\r\nrepresenting, and now living in, the district in which the prevalence of\r\nFree Soil sentiment for a couple of years or so has defeated the choice\r\nof any member to represent it in Congress. Sir, that body of Northern\r\nand Eastern men who gave those votes at that time are now seen taking\r\nupon themselves, in the nomenclature of politics, the appellation of\r\nthe Northern Democracy. They undertook to wield the destinies of this\r\nempire, if I may give that name to a Republic, and their policy was,\r\nand they persisted in it, to bring into this country and under this\r\ngovernment all the territory they could. They did it, in the case of\r\nTexas, under pledges, absolute pledges, to the slave interest, and they\r\nafterwards lent their aid in bringing in these new conquests, to take\r\ntheir chance for slavery or freedom. My honorable friend from Georgia,\r\nin March, 1847, moved the Senate to declare that the war ought not to\r\nbe prosecuted for the conquest of territory, or for the dismemberment of\r\nMexico. The whole of the Northern Democracy voted against it. He did not\r\nget a vote from them. It suited the patriotic and elevated sentiments of\r\nthe Northern Democracy to bring in a world from among the mountains and\r\nvalleys of California and New Mexico, or any other part of Mexico, and\r\nthen quarrel about it; to bring it in, and then endeavor to put upon\r\nit the saving grace of the Wilmot Proviso. There were two eminent and\r\nhighly respectable gentlemen from the North and East, then leading\r\ngentlemen in the Senate (I refer, and I do so with entire respect, for\r\nI entertain for both of those gentlemen, in general, high regard, to Mr.\r\nDix of New York and Mr. Niles of Connecticut), who both voted for the\r\nadmission of Texas. They would not have that vote any other way than as\r\nit stood; and they would have it as it did stand. I speak of the\r\nvote upon the annexation of Texas. Those two gentlemen would have the\r\nresolution of annexation just as it is, without amendment; and they\r\nvoted for it just as it is, and their eyes were all open to its true\r\ncharacter. The honorable member from South Carolina who addressed us\r\nthe other day was then Secretary of State. His correspondence with Mr.\r\nMurphy, the Charge d'Affaires of the United States in Texas, had been\r\npublished. That correspondence was all before those gentlemen, and the\r\nSecretary had the boldness and candor to avow in that correspondence,\r\nthat the great object sought by the annexation of Texas was to\r\nstrengthen the slave interest of the South. Why, sir, he said so in so\r\nmany words.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun. Will the honorable Senator permit me to interrupt him for a\r\nmoment? Mr. Webster. Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun. I am very reluctant to interrupt the honorable gentleman;\r\nbut, upon a point of so much importance, I deem it right to put myself\r\n_rectus in curia_. I did not put it upon the ground assumed by the\r\nSenator. I put it upon this ground; that Great Britain had announced to\r\nthis country, in so many words, that her object was to abolish slavery\r\nin Texas, and, through Texas, to accomplish the abolition of slavery\r\nin the United States and the world. The ground I put it on was, that it\r\nwould make an exposed frontier, and, if Great Britain succeeded in\r\nher object, it would be impossible that that frontier could be secured\r\nagainst the aggressions of the Abolitionists; and that this Government\r\nwas bound, under the guaranties of the Constitution, to protect us\r\nagainst such a state of things.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster. That comes, I suppose, Sir, to exactly the same thing. It\r\nwas, that Texas must be obtained for the security of the slave interest\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun. Another view is very distinctly given.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster. That was the object set forth in the correspondence of a\r\nworthy gentleman not now living, who preceded the honorable member from\r\nSouth Carolina in the Department of State. There repose on the files\r\nof the Department, as I have occasion to know, strong letters from Mr.\r\nUpshur to the United States Minister in England, and I believe there are\r\nsome to the same Minister from the honorable Senator himself, asserting\r\nto this effect the sentiments of this government; namely, that Great\r\nBritain was expected not to interfere to take Texas out of the hands\r\nof its then existing government and make it a free country. But my\r\nargument, my suggestion, is this: that those gentlemen who composed the\r\nNorthern Democracy when Texas was brought into the Union saw clearly\r\nthat it was brought in as a slave country, and brought in for the\r\npurpose of being maintained as slave territory, to the Greek Kalends.\r\nI rather think the honorable gentleman who was then Secretary of State\r\nmight, in some of his correspondence with Mr. Murphy, have suggested\r\nthat it was not expedient to say too much about this object, lest it\r\nshould create some alarm. At any rate, Mr. Murphy wrote to him that\r\nEngland was anxious to get rid of the constitution of Texas, because it\r\nwas a constitution establishing slavery; and that what the United\r\nStates had to do was to aid the people of Texas in upholding their\r\nconstitution; but that nothing should be said which should offend the\r\nfanatical men of the North. But, Sir, the honorable member did avow this\r\nobject himself, openly, boldly, and manfully; he did not disguise his\r\nconduct or his motives.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun. Never, never.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster. What he means he is very apt to say.\r\n\r\nMr. Calhoun. Always, always.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster. And I honor him for it.\r\n\r\nThis admission of Texas was in 1845. Then in 1847, _flagrante bello_\r\nbetween the United States and Mexico, the proposition I have mentioned\r\nwas brought forward by my friend from Georgia, and the Northern\r\nDemocracy voted steadily against it. Their remedy was to apply to\r\nthe acquisitions, after they should come in, the Wilmot Proviso. What\r\nfollows? These two gentlemen, worthy and honorable and influential men\r\n(and if they had not been they could not have carried the measure),\r\nthese two gentlemen, members of this body, brought in Texas, and by\r\ntheir votes they also pre-vented the passage of the resolution of the\r\nhonorable member from Georgia, and then they went home and took the lead\r\nin the Free Soil party. And there they stand, Sir! They leave us here,\r\nbound in honor and conscience by the resolutions of annexation; they\r\nleave us here, to take the odium of fulfilling the obligations in\r\nfavor of slavery which they voted us into, or else the greater odium of\r\nviolating those obligations, while they are at home making capital and\r\nrousing speeches for free soil and no slavery. And therefore I say, Sir,\r\nthat there is not a chapter in our history, respecting public measures\r\nand public men, more full of what would create surprise, and more full\r\nof what does create, in my mind, extreme mortification, than that of the\r\nconduct of the Northern Democracy on this subject.\r\n\r\nMr. President, sometimes when a man is found in a new relation to things\r\naround him and to other men, he says the world has changed, and that he\r\nis not changed. I believe, sir, that our self-respect leads us often\r\nto make this declaration in regard to ourselves when it is not exactly\r\ntrue. An individual is more apt to change, perhaps, than all the\r\nworld around him. But under the present circumstances, and under the\r\nresponsibility which I know I incur by what I am now stating here, I\r\nfeel at liberty to recur to the various expressions and statements,\r\nmade at various times, of my own opinions and resolutions respecting the\r\nadmission of Texas, and all that has followed.\r\n\r\n* * * On other occasions, in debate here, I have expressed my\r\ndetermination to vote for no acquisition, or cession, or annexation,\r\nNorth or South, East or West. My opinion has been, that we have\r\nterritory enough, and that we should follow the Spartan maxim: \"Improve,\r\nadorn what you have,\"--seek no further. I think that it was in some\r\nobservations that I made on the three million loan bill that I avowed\r\nthis sentiment. In short, sir, it has been avowed quite as often in as\r\nmany places, and before as many assemblies, as any humble opinions of\r\nmine ought to be avowed.\r\n\r\nBut now that, under certain conditions, Texas is in the Union, with all\r\nher territory, as a slave State, with a solemn pledge also that, if she\r\nshall be divided into many States, those States may come in as slave\r\nStates south of 36° 30', how are we to deal with this subject? I know no\r\nway of honest legislation, when the proper time comes for the enactment,\r\nbut to carry into effect all that we have stipulated to do. * * *\r\nThat is the meaning of the contract which our friends, the northern\r\nDemocracy, have left us to fulfil; and I, for one, mean to fulfil it,\r\nbecause I will not violate the faith of the Government. What I mean\r\nto say is, that the time for the admission of new States formed out of\r\nTexas, the number of such States, their boundaries, the requisite amount\r\nof population, and all other things connected with the admission, are\r\nin the free discretion of Congress, except this: to wit, that when new\r\nStates formed out of Texas are to be admitted, they have a right, by\r\nlegal stipulation and contract, to come in as slave States.\r\n\r\nNow, as to California and New Mexico, I hold slavery to be excluded\r\nfrom these territories by a law even superior to that which admits and\r\nsanctions it in Texas. I mean the law of nature, of physical geography,\r\nthe law of the formation of the earth. That law settles forever, with a\r\nstrength beyond all terms of human enactment, that slavery cannot exist\r\nin California or New Mexico. Understand me, sir; I mean slavery as we\r\nregard it; the slavery of the colored race as it exists in the southern\r\nStates. I shall not discuss the point, but leave it to the learned\r\ngentlemen who have undertaken to discuss it; but I suppose there is\r\nno slavery of that description in California now. I understand that\r\npeonism, a sort of penal servitude, exists there, or rather a sort of\r\nvoluntary sale of a man and his offspring for debt, an arrangement of a\r\npeculiar nature known to the law of Mexico. But what I mean to say\r\nis, that it is impossible that African slavery, as we see it among us,\r\nshould find its way, or be introduced, into California and New Mexico,\r\nas any other natural impossibility. California and New Mexico are\r\nAsiatic in their formation and scenery. They are composed of vast ridges\r\nof mountains of great height, with broken ridges and deep valleys.\r\nThe sides of these mountains are entirely barren; their tops capped\r\nby perennial snow. There may be in California, now made free by its\r\nconstitution, and no doubt there are, some tracts of valuable land.\r\nBut it is not so in New Mexico. Pray, what is the evidence which every\r\ngentleman must have obtained on this subject, from information sought by\r\nhimself or communicated by others? I have inquired and read all I could\r\nfind, in order to acquire information on this important subject. What is\r\nthere in New Mexico that could, by any possibility, induce anybody to go\r\nthere with slaves! There are some narrow strips of tillable land on the\r\nborders of the rivers; but the rivers themselves dry up before midsummer\r\nis gone. All that the people can do in that region is to raise some\r\nlittle articles, some little wheat for their tortillas, and that by\r\nirrigation. And who expects to see a hundred black men cultivating\r\ntobacco, corn, cotton, rice, or any thing else, on lands in New Mexico,\r\nmade fertile by irrigation?\r\n\r\nI look upon it, therefore, as a fixed fact, to use the current\r\nexpression of the day, that both California and New Mexico are destined\r\nto be free, so far as they are settled at all, which I believe, in\r\nregard to New Mexico, will be but partially, for a great length of time;\r\nfree by the arrangement of things ordained by the Power above us. I have\r\ntherefore to say, in this respect also, that this country is fixed\r\nfor freedom, to as many persons as shall ever live in it, by a less\r\nrepealable law than that which attaches to the right of holding slaves\r\nin Texas; and I will say further, that, if a resolution or a bill were\r\nnow before us, to provide a territorial government for New Mexico,\r\nI would not vote to put any prohibition into it whatever. Such a\r\nprohibition would be idle, as it respects any effect it would have\r\nupon the territory; and I would not take pains uselessly to reaffirm an\r\nordinance of nature, nor to re-enact the will of God. I would put in no\r\nWilmot proviso for the mere purpose of a taunt or a reproach. I would\r\nput into it no evidence of the votes of superior power, exercised for no\r\npurpose but to wound the pride, whether a just and a rational pride, or\r\nan irrational pride, of the citizens of the southern States. I have no\r\nsuch object, no such purpose. They would think it a taunt, an indignity;\r\nthey would think it to be an act taking away from them what they regard\r\nas a proper equality of privilege. Whether they expect to realize any\r\nbenefit from it or not, they would think it at least a plain theoretic\r\nwrong; that something more or less derogatory to their character and\r\ntheir rights had taken place. I propose to inflict no such wound upon\r\nanybody, unless something essentially important to the country, and\r\nefficient to the preservation of liberty and freedom, is to be effected.\r\nI repeat, therefore, sir, and, as I do not propose to address the Senate\r\noften on this subject, I repeat it because I wish it to be distinctly\r\nunderstood, that, for the reasons stated, if a proposition were now here\r\nto establish a government for New Mexico, and it was moved to insert a\r\nprovision for a prohibition of slavery, I would not vote for it. * * *\r\nSir, we hear occasionally of the annexation of Canada; and if there be\r\nany man, any of the northern Democracy, or any of the Free Soil party,\r\nwho supposes it necessary to insert a Wilmot Proviso in a territorial\r\ngovernment for New Mexico, that man would, of course, be of opinion that\r\nit is necessary to protect the ever-lasting snows of Canada from the\r\nfoot of slavery by the same overspreading wing of an act of Congress.\r\nSir, wherever there is a substantive good to be done, wherever there is\r\na foot of land to be prevented from becoming slave territory, I am ready\r\nto assert the principle of the exclusion of slavery. I am pledged to\r\nit from the year 1837; I have been pledged to it again and again; and I\r\nwill perform these pledges; but I will not do a thing unnecessarily\r\nthat wounds the feelings of others, or that does discredit to my own\r\nunderstanding. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. President, in the excited times in which we live, there is found\r\nto exist a state of crimination and recrimination between the North\r\nand South. There are lists of grievances produced by each; and those\r\ngrievances, real or supposed, alienate the minds of one portion of the\r\ncountry from the other, exasperate the feelings, and subdue the sense of\r\nfraternal affection, patriotic love, and mutual regard. I shall bestow a\r\nlittle attention, sir, upon these various grievances existing on the one\r\nside and on the other. I begin with complaints of the South. I will not\r\nanswer, further than I have, the general statements of the honorable\r\nSenator from South Carolina, that the North has prospered at the\r\nexpense of the South in consequence of the manner of administering this\r\nGovernment, in the collection of its revenues, and so forth. These are\r\ndisputed topics, and I have no inclination to enter into them. But I\r\nwill allude to other complaints of the South, and especially to one\r\nwhich has in my opinion, just foundation; and that is, that there has\r\nbeen found at the North, among individuals and among legislators, a\r\ndisinclination to perform fully their constitutional duties in regard\r\nto the return of persons bound to service who have escaped into the free\r\nStates. In that respect, the South, in my judgment, is right, and the\r\nNorth is wrong. Every member of every Northern legislature is bound\r\nby oath, like every other officer in the country, to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States; and the article of the Constitution\r\nwhich says to these States that they shall deliver up fugitives from\r\nservice, is as binding in honor and conscience as any other article.\r\nNo man fulfils his duty in any legislature who sets himself to find\r\nexcuses, evasions, escapes from this constitutional obligation. I\r\nhave always thought that the Constitution addressed itself to the\r\nlegislatures of the States or to the States themselves. It says that\r\nthose persons escaping to other States \"shall be delivered up,\" and I\r\nconfess I have always been of the opinion that it was an injunction\r\nupon the States themselves. When it is said that a person escaping into\r\nanother State, and coming therefore within the jurisdiction of that\r\nState, shall be delivered up, it seems to me the import of the clause\r\nis, that the State itself, in obedience to the Constitution, shall cause\r\nhim to be delivered up. That is my judgment. I have always entertained\r\nthat opinion, and I entertain it now. But when the subject, some years\r\nago, was before the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority\r\nof the judges held that the power to cause fugitives from service to\r\nbe delivered up was a power to be exercised under the authority of this\r\nGovernment. I do not know, on the whole, that it may not have been\r\na fortunate decision. My habit is to respect the result of judicial\r\ndeliberations and the solemnity of judicial decisions. As it now stands,\r\nthe business of seeing that these fugitives are delivered up resides in\r\nthe power of Congress and the national judicature, and my friend at the\r\nhead of the Judiciary Committee has a bill on the subject now before the\r\nSenate, which, with some amendments to it, I propose to support, with\r\nall its provisions, to the fullest extent. And I desire to call the\r\nattention of all sober-minded men at the North, of all conscientious\r\nmen, of all men who are not carried away by some fanatical idea or some\r\nfalse impression, to their constitutional obligations. I put it to all\r\nthe sober and sound minds at the North as a question of morals and\r\na question of conscience. What right have they, in their legislative\r\ncapacity, or any other capacity, to endeavor to get round this\r\nConstitution, or to embarrass the free exercise of the rights secured by\r\nthe Constitution, to the person whose slaves escape from them? None at\r\nall; none at all. Neither in the forum of conscience, nor before the\r\nface of the Constitution, are they, in my opinion, justified in such\r\nan attempt. Of course it is a matter for their consideration. They\r\nprobably, in the excitement of the times, have not stopped to consider\r\nthis. They have followed what seemed to be the current of thought and of\r\nmotives, as the occasion arose, and they have neglected to investigate\r\nfully the real question, and to consider their constitutional\r\nobligations; which, I am sure, if they did consider, they would fulfil\r\nwith alacrity. I repeat, therefore, sir, that here is a well-founded\r\nground of complaint against the North, which ought to be removed, which\r\nis now in the power of the different departments of this government to\r\nremove; which calls for the enactment of proper laws authorizing the\r\njudicature of this Government, in the several States, to do all that is\r\nnecessary for the recapture of fugitive slaves and for their restoration\r\nto those who claim them. Wherever I go, and whenever I speak on the\r\nsubject, and when I speak here I desire to speak to the whole North, I\r\nsay that the South has been injured in this respect, and has a right\r\nto complain; and the North has been too careless of what I think the\r\nConstitution peremptorily and emphatically enjoins upon her as a duty.\r\n\r\nComplaint has been made against certain resolutions that emanate from\r\nlegislatures at the North, and are sent here to us, not only on the\r\nsubject of slavery in this District, but sometimes recommending Congress\r\nto consider the means of abolishing slavery in the States. I should be\r\nsorry to be called upon to present any resolutions here which could not\r\nbe referable to any committee or any power in Congress; and therefore I\r\nshould be unwilling to receive from the legislature of Massachusetts any\r\ninstructions to present resolutions expressive of any opinion whatever\r\non the subject of slavery, as it exists at the present moment in the\r\nStates, for two reasons: because I do not consider that I, as her\r\nrepresentative here, have any thing to do with it. It has become, in my\r\nopinion, quite too common; and if the legislatures of the States do not\r\nlike that opinion, they have a great deal more power to put it down than\r\nI have to uphold it; it has become, in my opinion, quite too common a\r\npractice for the State legislatures to present resolutions here on all\r\nsubjects and to instruct us on all subjects. There is no public man that\r\nrequires instruction more than I do, or who requires information more\r\nthan I do, or desires it more heartily; but I do not like to have it in\r\ntoo imperative a shape. * * *\r\n\r\nThen, sir, there are the Abolition societies, of which I am unwilling to\r\nspeak, but in regard to which I have very clear notions and opinions. I\r\ndo not think them useful. I think their operations for the last twenty\r\nyears have produced nothing good or valuable. At the same time, I\r\nbelieve thousands of their members to be honest and good men, perfectly\r\nwell-meaning men. They have excited feelings; they think they must do\r\nsomething for the cause of liberty; and, in their sphere of action,\r\nthey do not see what else they can do than to contribute to an abolition\r\npress, or an abolition society, or to pay an abolition lecturer. I do\r\nnot mean to impute gross motives even to the leaders of these societies,\r\nbut I am not blind to the consequences of their proceedings. I cannot\r\nbut see what mischief their interference with the South has produced.\r\nAnd is it not plain to every man? Let any gentleman who entertains\r\ndoubts on this point, recur to the debates in the Virginia House of\r\nDelegates in 1832, and he will see with what freedom a proposition made\r\nby Mr. Jefferson Randolph, for the gradual abolition of slavery was\r\ndiscussed in that body. Every one spoke of slavery as he thought; very\r\nignominous and disparaging names and epithets were applied to it. The\r\ndebates in the House of Delegates on that occasion, I believe were all\r\npublished. They were read by every colored man who could read, and to\r\nthose who could not read, those debates were read by others. At that\r\ntime Virginia was not unwilling or afraid to discuss this question, and\r\nto let that part of her population know as much of the discussion as\r\nthey could learn. That was in 1832. As has been said by the honorable\r\nmember from South Carolina, these abolition societies commenced their\r\ncourse of action in 1835. It is said, I do not know how true it may be,\r\nthat they sent incendiary publications into the slave States; at any\r\nrate, they attempted to arouse, and did arouse, a very strong feeling;\r\nin other words, they created great agitation in the North against\r\nSouthern slavery. Well, what was the result? The bonds of the slaves\r\nwere bound more firmly than before, their rivets were more strongly\r\nfastened. Public opinion, which in Virginia had begun to be exhibited\r\nagainst slavery, and was opening out for the discussion of the question,\r\ndrew back and shut itself up in its castle. I wish to know whether\r\nanybody in Virginia can now talk openly, as Mr. Randolph, Governor\r\nMcDowel, and others talked in 1832, and sent their remarks to the press?\r\nWe all know the fact, and we all know the cause; and every thing that\r\nthese agitating people have done has been, not to enlarge, but to\r\nrestrain, not to set free, but to bind faster, the slave population of\r\nthe South. * * *\r\n\r\nThere are also complaints of the North against the South. I need not go\r\nover them particularly. The first and gravest is, that the North adopted\r\nthe Constitution, recognizing the existence of slavery in the States,\r\nand recognizing the right, to a certain extent, of the representation\r\nof slaves in Congress, under a state of sentiment and expectation\r\nwhich does not now exist; and that by events, by circumstances, by\r\nthe eagerness of the South to acquire territory and extend her slave\r\npopulation, the North finds itself, in regard to the relative influence\r\nof the South and the North, of the free States and the slave States,\r\nwhere it never did expect to find itself when they agreed to the compact\r\nof the Constitution. They complain, therefore, that, instead of slavery\r\nbeing regarded as an evil, as it was then, an evil which all hoped\r\nwould be extinguished gradually, it is now regarded by the South as an\r\ninstitution to be cherished, and preserved, and extended; an institution\r\nwhich the South has already extended to the utmost of her power by the\r\nacquisition of new territory.\r\n\r\nWell, then, passing from that, everybody in the North reads; and\r\neverybody reads whatsoever the newspapers contain; and the news-papers,\r\nsome of them, especially those presses to which I have alluded, are\r\ncareful to spread about among the people every reproachful sentiment\r\nuttered by any Southern man bearing at all against the North; every\r\nthing that is calculated to exasperate and to alienate; and there are\r\nmany such things, as everybody will admit, from the South, or from\r\nportions of it, which are disseminated among the reading people; and\r\nthey do exasperate, and alienate, and produce a most mischievous effect\r\nupon the public mind at the North. Sir, I would not notice things of\r\nthis sort appearing in obscure quarters; but one thing has occurred\r\nin this debate which struck me very forcibly. An honorable member from\r\nLouisiana addressed us the other day on this subject. I suppose there is\r\nnot a more amiable and worthy gentleman in this chamber, nor a gentleman\r\nwho would be more slow to give offence to any body, and he did not mean\r\nin his remarks to give offence. But what did he say? Why, sir, he took\r\npains to run a contrast between the slaves of the South and the laboring\r\npeople of the North, giving the preference, in all points of condition,\r\nand comfort, and happiness to the slaves of the South. The honorable\r\nmember, doubtless, did not suppose that he gave any offence, or did any\r\ninjustice. He was merely expressing his opinion. But does he know how\r\nremarks of that sort will be received by the laboring people of the\r\nNorth? Why, who are the laboring people of the North? They are the\r\nwhole North. They are the people who till their own farms with their own\r\nhands; freeholders, educated men, independent men. Let me say, sir, that\r\nfive sixths of the whole property of the North is in the hands of the\r\nlaborers of the North; they cultivate their farms, they educate\r\ntheir children, they provide the means of independence. If they are not\r\nfreeholders, they earn wages; these wages accumulate, are turned into\r\ncapital, into new freeholds, and small capitalists are created. Such\r\nis the case, and such the course of things, among the industrious and\r\nfrugal. And what can these people think when so respectable and worthy\r\na gentleman as the member from Louisiana undertakes to prove that the\r\nabsolute ignorance and the abject slavery of the South are more in\r\nconformity with the high purposes and destiny of immortal, rational,\r\nhuman beings, than the educated, the independent free labor of the\r\nNorth?\r\n\r\nThere is a more tangible and irritating cause of grievance at the\r\nNorth. Free blacks are constantly employed in the vessels of the North,\r\ngenerally as cooks or stewards. When the vessel arrives at a southern\r\nport, these free colored men are taken on shore, by the police or\r\nmunicipal authority, imprisoned, and kept in prison till the vessel\r\nis again ready to sail. This is not only irritating, but exceedingly\r\nunjustifiable and oppressive. Mr. Hoar's mission, some time ago to South\r\nCarolina, was a well-intended effort to remove this cause of complaint.\r\nThe North thinks such imprisonments illegal and unconstitutional; and as\r\nthe cases occur constantly and frequently they regard it as a grievance.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, so far as any of these grievances have their foundation in\r\nmatters of law, they can be redressed, and ought to be redressed; and so\r\nfar as they have their foundation in matters of opinion, in sentiment,\r\nin mutual crimination and recrimination, all that we can do is to\r\nendeavor to allay the agitation, and cultivate a better feeling and more\r\nfraternal sentiments between the South and the North.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I should much prefer to have heard from every member\r\non this floor declarations of opinion that this Union could never be\r\ndissolved, than the declaration of opinion by anybody, that in any\r\ncase, under the pressure of any circumstances, such a dissolution\r\nwas possible. I hear with distress and anguish the word \"secession,\"\r\nespecially when it falls from the lips of those who are patriotic, and\r\nknown to the country, and known all over the world for their political\r\nservices. Secession! Peaceable secession! Sir, your eyes and mine are\r\nnever destined to see that miracle. The dismemberment of this vast\r\ncountry without convulsion! The breaking up of the fountains of the\r\ngreat deep without ruffling the surface! Who is so foolish--I beg\r\neverybody's pardon--as to expect to see any such thing? Sir, he who\r\nsees these States, now revolving in harmony around a common centre, and\r\nexpects to see them quit their places and fly off without convulsion,\r\nmay look the next hour to see the heavenly bodies rush from their\r\nspheres, and jostle against each other in the realms of space, without\r\ncausing the wreck of the universe. There can be no such thing as a\r\npeaceable secession. Peaceable secession is an utter impossibility. Is\r\nthe great Constitution under which we live, covering this whole country,\r\nis it to be thawed and melted away by secession, as the snows on the\r\nmountain melt under the influence of a vernal sun, disappear almost\r\nunobserved, and run off? No, sir! No, sir! I will not state what might\r\nproduce the disruption of the Union; but, sir, I see as plainly as I can\r\nsee the sun in heaven what that disruption itself must produce; I see\r\nthat it must produce war, and such a war as I will not describe, in its\r\ntwofold character.\r\n\r\nPeaceable secession! Peaceable secession! The concurrent agreement\r\nof all the members of this great Republic to separate! A voluntary\r\nseparation, with alimony on one side and on the other. Why, what would\r\nbe the result? Where is the line to be drawn? What States are to secede?\r\nWhat is to remain American? What am I to be? An American no longer? Am I\r\nto become a sectional man, a local man, a separatist, with no country in\r\ncommon with the gentlemen who sit around me here, or who fill the other\r\nhouse of Congress? Heaven forbid! Where is the flag of the Republic\r\nto remain? Where is the eagle still to tower? or is he to cower, and\r\nshrink, and fall to the ground? Why, sir, our ancestors, our fathers\r\nand our grandfathers, those of them that are yet living amongst us with\r\nprolonged lives, would rebuke and reproach us; and our children and\r\nour grandchildren would cry out shame upon us, if we of this generation\r\nshould dishonor these ensigns of the power of the Government and the\r\nharmony of that Union which is every day felt among us with so much joy\r\nand gratitude. What is to become of the army? What is to become of the\r\nnavy? What is to become of the public lands? How is each of the thirty\r\nStates to defend itself? I know, although the idea has not been stated\r\ndistinctly, there is to be, or it is supposed possible that there\r\nwill be, a Southern Confederacy. I do not mean, when I allude to this\r\nstatement, that any one seriously contemplates such a state of things.\r\nI do not mean to say that it is true, but I have heard it suggested\r\nelsewhere, that the idea has been entertained, that, after the\r\ndissolution of this Union, a Southern Confederacy might be formed. I am\r\nsorry, sir, that it has ever been thought of, talked of, in the wildest\r\nflights of human imagination. But the idea, so far as it exists, must\r\nbe of a separation, assigning the slave States to one side, and the free\r\nStates to the other. Sir, I may express myself too strongly, perhaps,\r\nbut there are impossibilities in the natural as well as in the physical\r\nworld, and I hold the idea of the separation of these States, those that\r\nare free to form one government, and those that are slave-holding to\r\nform another, as such an impossibility. We could not separate the States\r\nby any such line, if we were to draw it. We could not sit down here\r\nto-day and draw a line of separation that would satisfy any five men\r\nin the country. There are natural causes that would keep and tie us\r\ntogether, and there are social and domestic relations which we could not\r\nbreak if we would, and which we should not if we could.\r\n\r\nSir, nobody can look over the face of this country at the present\r\nmoment, nobody can see where its population is the most dense and\r\ngrowing, without being ready to admit, and compelled to admit,\r\nthat erelong the strength of America will be in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi. Well, now, sir, I beg to inquire what the wildest\r\nenthusiast has to say on the possibility of cutting that river in two,\r\nand leaving free States at its source and on its branches, and slave\r\nStates down near its mouth, each forming a separate government? Pray,\r\nsir, let me say to the people of this country, that these things are\r\nworthy of their pondering and of their consideration. Here, sir, are\r\nfive millions of freemen in the free States north of the river Ohio.\r\nCan anybody suppose that this population can be severed, by a line that\r\ndivides them from the territory of a foreign and alien government,\r\ndown somewhere, the Lord knows where, upon the lower banks of\r\nthe Mississippi? What would become of Missouri? Will she join the\r\narrondissement of the slave States? Shall the man from the Yellowstone\r\nand the Platte be connected, in the new republic, with the man who lives\r\non the southern extremity of the Cape of Florida? Sir, I am ashamed to\r\npursue this line of remark. I dislike it, I have an utter disgust for\r\nit. I would rather hear of natural blasts and mildews, war, pestilence,\r\nand famine, than to hear gentlemen talk of secession. To break up this\r\ngreat Government! to dismember this glorious country! to astonish Europe\r\nwith an act of folly such as Europe for two centuries has never beheld\r\nin any government or any people! No, sir! no, sir! There will be no\r\nsecession! Gentlemen are not serious when they talk of secession.\r\n\r\nSir, I hear there is to be a convention held at Nashville. I am bound to\r\nbelieve that if worthy gentlemen meet at Nashville in convention, their\r\nobject will be to adopt conciliatory counsels; to advise the South to\r\nforbearance and moderation, and to advise the North to forbearance and\r\nmoderation; and to inculcate principles of brotherly love and affection,\r\nand attachment to the Constitution of the country as it now is. I\r\nbelieve, if the convention meet at all, it will be for this purpose; for\r\ncertainly, if they meet for any purpose hostile to the Union, they have\r\nbeen singularly inappropriate in their selection of a place. I remember,\r\nsir, that, when the treaty of Amiens was concluded between France and\r\nEngland, a sturdy Englishman and a distinguished orator, who regarded\r\nthe conditions of the peace as ignominious to England, said in the House\r\nof Commons, that if King William could know the terms of that treaty, he\r\nwould turn in his coffin! Let me commend this saying to Mr. Windham, in\r\nall its emphasis and in all its force, to any persons who shall meet at\r\nNashville for the purpose of concerting measures for the overthrow of\r\nthis Union over the bones of Andrew Jackson. * * *\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, instead of speaking of the possibility or\r\nutility of secession, instead of dwelling in those caverns of darkness,\r\ninstead of groping with those ideas so full of all that is horrid and\r\nhorrible, let us come out into the light of the day; let us enjoy the\r\nfresh air of Liberty and Union; let us cherish those hopes which belong\r\nto us; let us devote ourselves to those great objects that are fit for\r\nour consideration and our action; let us raise our conceptions to the\r\nmagnitude and the importance of the duties that devolve upon us; let\r\nour comprehension be as broad as the country for which we act, our\r\naspirations as high as its certain destiny; let us not be pigmies in a\r\ncase that calls for men. Never did there devolve on any generation of\r\nmen higher trusts than now devolve upon us, for the preservation of this\r\nConstitution and the harmony and peace of all who are destined to live\r\nunder it. Let us make our generation one of the strongest and brightest\r\nlinks in that golden chain which is destined, I fondly believe, to\r\ngrapple the people of all the States to this Constitution for ages to\r\ncome. We have a great, popular, Constitutional Government, guarded\r\nby law and by judicature, and defended by the affections of the whole\r\npeople. No monarchical throne presses these States together, no iron\r\nchain of military power encircles them; they live and stand under a\r\nGovernment popular in its form, representative in its character, founded\r\nupon principles of equality, and so constructed, we hope, as to last\r\nforever. In all its history it has been beneficent; it has trodden down\r\nno man's liberty; it has crushed no State. Its daily respiration is\r\nliberty and patriotism; its yet youthful veins are full of enterprise,\r\ncourage, and honorable love of glory and renown. Large before, the\r\ncountry has now, by recent events, become vastly larger. This Republic\r\nnow extends, with a vast breadth across the whole continent. The two\r\ngreat seas of the world wash the one and the other shore. We realize,\r\non a mighty scale, the beautiful description of the ornamental border of\r\nthe buckler of Achilles:\r\n\r\n     \"Now, the broad shield complete, the artist crowned\r\n     With his last hand, and poured the ocean round;\r\n     In living silver seemed the waves to roll,\r\n     And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry Clay]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY,\r\n\r\nOF KENTUCKY, (BORN 1777, DIED 1852.)\r\n\r\nON THE COMPROMISE OF 1850; UNITED STATES SENATE, JULY 22, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIn the progress of this debate it has been again and again argued that\r\nperfect tranquillity reigns throughout the country, and that there is\r\nno disturbance threatening its peace, endangering its safety, but that\r\nwhich was produced by busy, restless politicians. It has been maintained\r\nthat the surface of the public mind is perfectly smooth and undisturbed\r\nby a single billow. I most heartily wish I could concur in this picture\r\nof general tranquillity that has been drawn upon both sides of the\r\nSenate. I am no alarmist; nor, I thank God, at the advanced age at which\r\nHis providence has been pleased to allow me to reach, am I very easily\r\nalarmed by any human event; but I totally misread the signs of the\r\ntimes, if there be that state of profound peace and quiet, that absence\r\nof all just cause of apprehension of future danger to this confederacy,\r\nwhich appears to be entertained by some other senators. Mr. President,\r\nall the tendencies of the times, I lament to say, are toward\r\ndisquietude, if not more fatal consequences. When before, in the midst\r\nof profound peace with all the nations of the earth, have we seen a\r\nconvention, representing a considerable portion of one great part of\r\nthe Republic, meet to deliberate about measures of future safety in\r\nconnection with great interests of that quarter of the country? When\r\nbefore have we seen, not one, but more--some half a dozen legislative\r\nbodies solemnly resolving that if any one of these measures--the\r\nadmission of California, the adoption of the Wilmot proviso, the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia--should be adopted by\r\nCongress, measures of an extreme character, for the safety of the great\r\ninterests to which I refer, in a particular section of the country,\r\nwould be resorted to? For years, this subject of the abolition of\r\nslavery, even within this District of Columbia, small as is the number\r\nof slaves here, has been a source of constant irritation and disquiet.\r\nSo of the subject of the recovery of fugitive slaves who have escaped\r\nfrom their lawful owners: not a mere border contest, as has been\r\nsupposed--although there, undoubtedly, it has given rise to more\r\nirritation than in other portions of the Union--but everywhere\r\nthrough-out the slave-holding country it has been felt as a great evil,\r\na great wrong which required the intervention of congressional power.\r\nBut these two subjects, unpleasant as has been the agitation to which\r\nthey have given rise, are nothing in comparison to those which have\r\nsprung out of the acquisitions recently made from the Republic of\r\nMexico. These are not only great and leading causes of just apprehension\r\nas respects the future, but all the minor circumstances of the day\r\nintimate danger ahead, whatever may be its final issue and consequence.\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I will not dwell upon other concomitant causes, all\r\nhaving the same tendency, and all well calculated to awaken, to arouse\r\nus--if, as I hope the fact is, we are all of us sincerely desirous\r\nof preserving this Union--to rouse us to dangers which really exist,\r\nwithout underrating them upon the one hand, or magnifying them upon the\r\nother. * * *\r\n\r\nIt has been objected against this measure that it is a compromise. It\r\nhas been said that it is a compromise of principle, or of a\r\nprinciple. Mr. President, what is a compromise? It is a work of mutual\r\nconcession--an agreement in which there are reciprocal stipulations--a\r\nwork in which, for the sake of peace and concord, one party abates his\r\nextreme demands in consideration of an abatement of extreme demands\r\nby the other party: it is a measure of mutual concession--a measure of\r\nmutual sacrifice. Undoubtedly, Mr. President, in all such measures\r\nof compromise, one party would be very glad to get what he wants, and\r\nreject what he does not desire, but which the other party wants. But\r\nwhen he comes to reflect that, from the nature of the Government and its\r\noperations, and from those with whom he is dealing, it is necessary upon\r\nhis part, in order to secure what he wants, to grant something to the\r\nother side, he should be reconciled to the concession which he has made,\r\nin consequence of the concession which he is to receive, if there is no\r\ngreat principle involved, such as a violation of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. I admit that such a compromise as that ought never to be\r\nsanctioned or adopted. But I now call upon any senator in his place to\r\npoint out from the beginning to the end, from California to New Mexico,\r\na solitary provision in this bill which is violative of the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nSir, adjustments in the shape of compromise may be made without\r\nproducing any such consequences as have been apprehended. There may be\r\na mutual forbearance. You forbear on your side to insist upon the\r\napplication of the restriction denominated the Wilmot proviso. Is\r\nthere any violation of principle there? The most that can be said, even\r\nassuming the power to pass the Wilmot proviso, which is denied, is that\r\nthere is a forbearance to exercise, not a violation of, the power to\r\npass the proviso. So, upon the other hand, if there was a power in\r\nthe Constitution of the United States authorizing the establishment\r\nof slavery in any of the Territories--a power, however, which is\r\ncontroverted by a large portion of this Senate--if there was a power\r\nunder the Constitution to establish slavery, the forbearance to exercise\r\nthat power is no violation of the Constitution, any more than the\r\nConstitution is violated by a forbearance to exercise numerous powers,\r\nthat might be specified, that are granted in the Constitution, and that\r\nremain dormant until they come to be exercised by the proper\r\nlegislative authorities. It is said that the bill presents the state of\r\ncoercion--that members are coerced, in order to get what they want, to\r\nvote for that which they disapprove. Why, sir, what coercion is there?\r\n* * * Can it be said upon the part of our Northern friends, because they\r\nhave not got the Wilmot proviso incorporated in the territorial part\r\nof the bill, that they are coerced--wanting California, as they do, so\r\nmuch--to vote for the bill, if they do vote for it? Sir, they might\r\nhave imitated the noble example of my friend (Senator Cooper, of\r\nPennsylvania), from that State upon whose devotion to this Union I place\r\none of my greatest reliances for its preservation. What was the course\r\nof my friend upon this subject of the Wilmot proviso? He voted for it;\r\nand he could go back to his constituents and say, as all of you could go\r\nback and say to your constituents, if you chose to do so--\"We wanted the\r\nWilmot proviso in the bill; we tried to get it in; but the majority of\r\nthe Senate was against it.\" The question then came up whether we should\r\nlose California, which has got an interdiction in her constitution,\r\nwhich, in point of value and duration, is worth a thousand Wilmot\r\nprovisos; we were induced, as my honorable friend would say, to take the\r\nbill and the whole of it together, although we were disappointed in our\r\nvotes with respect to the Wilmot proviso--to take it, whatever omissions\r\nmay have been made, on account of the superior amount of good it\r\ncontains. * * *\r\n\r\nNot the reception of the treaty of peace negotiated at Ghent, nor any\r\nother event which has occurred during my progress in public life, ever\r\ngave such unbounded and universal satisfaction as the settlement of the\r\nMissouri compromise. We may argue from like causes like effects. Then,\r\nindeed, there was great excitement. Then, indeed, all the legislatures\r\nof the North called out for the exclusion of Missouri, and all the\r\nlegislatures of the South called out for her admission as a State.\r\nThen, as now, the country was agitated like the ocean in the midst of\r\na turbulent storm. But now, more than then, has this agitation been\r\nincreased. Now, more than then, are the dangers which exist, if the\r\ncontroversy remains unsettled, more aggravated and more to be dreaded.\r\nThe idea of disunion was then scarcely a low whisper. Now, it has become\r\na familiar language in certain portions of the country. The public mind\r\nand the public heart are becoming familiarized with that most dangerous\r\nand fatal of all events--the disunion of the States. People begin to\r\ncontend that this is not so bad a thing as they had supposed. Like the\r\nprogress in all human affairs, as we approach danger it disappears, it\r\ndiminishes in our conception, and we no longer regard it with that awful\r\napprehension of consequences that we did before we came into contact\r\nwith it. Everywhere now there is a state of things, a degree of alarm\r\nand apprehension, and determination to fight, as they regard it, against\r\nthe aggressions of the North. That did not so demonstrate itself at the\r\nperiod of the Missouri compromise. It was followed, in consequence of\r\nthe adoption of the measure which settled the difficulty of Missouri,\r\nby peace, harmony, and tranquillity. So, now, I infer, from the greater\r\namount of agitation, from the greater amount of danger, that, if you\r\nadopt the measures under consideration, they, too, will be followed by\r\nthe same amount of contentment, satisfaction, peace, and tranquillity,\r\nwhich ensued after the Missouri compromise. * * *\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of this great measure passes from the hands of the\r\ncommittee, and from my hands. They know, and I know, that it is an awful\r\nand tremendous responsibility. I hope that you will meet it with a just\r\nconception and a true appreciation of its magnitude, and the magnitude\r\nof the consequences that may ensue from your decision one way or, the\r\nother. The alternatives, I fear, which the measure presents, are concord\r\nand increased discord; a servile civil war, originating in its causes\r\non the lower Rio Grande, and terminating possibly in its consequences\r\non the upper Rio Grande in the Santa Fe country, or the restoration of\r\nharmony and fraternal kindness. I believe from the bottom of my soul,\r\nthat the measure is the reunion of this Union. I believe it is the dove\r\nof peace, which, taking its aerial flight from the dome of the Capitol,\r\ncarries the glad tidings of assured peace and restored harmony to all\r\nthe remotest extremities of this distracted land. I believe that it will\r\nbe attended with all these beneficent effects. And now let us discard\r\nall resentment, all passions, all petty jealousies, all personal\r\ndesires, all love of place, all hankerings after the gilded crumbs which\r\nfall from the table of power. Let us forget popular fears, from\r\nwhatever quarter they may spring. Let us go to the limpid fountain of\r\nunadulterated patriotism, and, performing a solemn lustration, return\r\ndivested of all selfish, sinister, and sordid impurities, and think\r\nalone of our God, our country, our consciences, and our glorious\r\nUnion--that Union without which we shall be torn into hostile fragments,\r\nand sooner or later become the victims of military despotism, or foreign\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nMr. President, what is an individual man? An atom, almost invisible\r\nwithout a magnifying glass--a mere speck upon the surface of the\r\nimmense universe; not a second in time, compared to immeasurable,\r\nnever-beginning, and never-ending eternity; a drop of water in the great\r\ndeep, which evaporates and is borne off by the winds; a grain of sand,\r\nwhich is soon gathered to the dust from which it sprung. Shall a being\r\nso small, so petty, so fleeting, so evanescent, oppose itself to the\r\nonward march of a great nation, which is to subsist for ages and ages to\r\ncome; oppose itself to that long line of posterity which, issuing from\r\nour loins, will endure during the existence of the world? Forbid it,\r\nGod. Let us look to our country and our cause, elevate ourselves to the\r\ndignity of pure and disinterested patriots, and save our country from\r\nall impending dangers. What if, in the march of this nation to greatness\r\nand power, we should be buried beneath the wheels that propel it onward!\r\nWhat are we--what is any man--worth who is not ready and willing to\r\nsacrifice himself for the benefit of his country when it is necessary? *\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIf this Union shall become separated, new unions, new confederacies will\r\narise. And with respect to this, if there be any--I hope there is no one\r\nin the Senate--before whose imagination is flitting the idea of a great\r\nSouthern Confederacy to take possession of the Balize and the mouth\r\nof the Mississippi, I say in my place never! never! NEVER! will we who\r\noccupy the broad waters of the Mississippi and its upper tributaries\r\nconsent that any foreign flag shall float at the Balize or upon the\r\nturrets of the Crescent City--NEVER! NEVER! I call upon all the South.\r\nSir, we have had hard words, bitter words, bitter thoughts, unpleasant\r\nfeelings toward each other in the progress of this great measure. Let us\r\nforget them. Let us sacrifice these feelings. Let us go to the altar of\r\nour country and swear, as the oath was taken of old, that we will stand\r\nby her; that we will support her; that we will uphold her Constitution;\r\nthat we will preserve her Union; and that we will pass this great,\r\ncomprehensive, and healing system of measures, which will hush all the\r\njarring elements, and bring peace and tranquillity to our homes.\r\n\r\nLet me, Mr. President, in conclusion, say that the most disastrous\r\nconsequences would occur, in my opinion, were we to go home, doing\r\nnothing to satisfy and tranquillize the country upon these great\r\nquestions. What will be the judgment of mankind, what the judgment of\r\nthat portion of mankind who are looking upon the progress of this scheme\r\nof self-government as being that which holds the highest hopes and\r\nexpectations of ameliorating the condition of mankind--what will their\r\njudgment be? Will not all the monarchs of the Old World pronounce our\r\nglorious Republic a disgraceful failure? What will be the judgment of\r\nour constituents, when we return to them and they ask us: \"How have\r\nyou left your country? Is all quiet--all happy? Are all the seeds of\r\ndistraction or division crushed and dissipated?\" And, sir, when you\r\ncome into the bosom of your family, when you come to converse with the\r\npartner of your fortunes, of your happiness, and of your sorrows, and\r\nwhen in the midst of the common offspring of both of you, she asks you:\r\n\"Is there any danger of civil war? Is there any danger of the torch\r\nbeing applied to any portion of the country? Have you settled the\r\nquestions which you have been so long discussing and deliberating\r\nupon at Washington? Is all peace and all quiet?\" what response, Mr.\r\nPresident, can you make to that wife of your choice and those children\r\nwith whom you have been blessed by God? Will you go home and leave all\r\nin disorder and confusion--all unsettled--all open? The contentions and\r\nagitations of the past will be increased and augmented by the agitations\r\nresulting from our neglect to decide them. Sir, we shall stand condemned\r\nby all human judgment below, and of that above it is not for me to\r\nspeak. We shall stand condemned in our own consciences, by our own\r\nconstituents, and by our own country. The measure may be defeated.\r\nI have been aware that its passage for many days was not absolutely\r\ncertain. From the first to the last, I hoped and believed it would pass,\r\nbecause from the first to the last I believed it was founded on the\r\nprinciples of just and righteous concession of mutual conciliation. I\r\nbelieve that it deals unjustly by no part of the Republic; that it saves\r\ntheir honor, and, as far as it is dependent upon Congress, saves the\r\ninterests of all quarters of the country. But, sir, I have known that\r\nthe decision of its fate depended upon four or five votes in the Senate\r\nof the United States, whose ultimate judgment we could not count upon\r\nthe one side or the other with absolute certainty. Its fate is now\r\ncommitted to the Senate, and to those five or six votes to which I have\r\nreferred. It may be defeated. It is possible that, for the chastisement\r\nof our sins and transgressions, the rod of Providence may be still\r\napplied to us, may be still suspended over us. But, if defeated, it\r\nwill be a triumph of ultraism and impracticability--a triumph of a most\r\nextraordinary conjunction of extremes; a victory won by abolitionism; a\r\nvictory achieved by freesoilism; a victory of discord and agitation over\r\npeace and tranquillity; and I pray to Almighty God that it may not, in\r\nconsequence of the inauspicious result, lead to the most unhappy and\r\ndisastrous consequences to our beloved country.\r\n\r\nMR. BARNWELL:--It is not my intention to reply to the argument of the\r\nSenator from Kentucky, but there were expressions used by him not a\r\nlittle disrespectful to a friend whom I hold very dear. * * * It is true\r\nthat his political opinions differ very widely from those of the Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky. It may be true, that he, with many great statesmen, may\r\nbelieve that the Wilmot proviso is a grievance to be resisted \"to the\r\nutmost extremity\" by those whose rights it destroys and whose honor it\r\ndegrades. It is true that he may believe * * * that the admission of\r\nCalifornia will be the passing of the Wilmot proviso, when we here in\r\nCongress give vitality to an act otherwise totally dead, and by our\r\nlegislation exclude slaveholders from that whole broad territory on the\r\nPacific; and, entertaining this opinion, he may have declared that the\r\ncontingency will then have occurred which will, in the judgment of most\r\nof the slave-holding States, as expressed by their resolutions, justify\r\nresistance as to an intolerable aggression. If he does entertain and\r\nhas expressed such sentiments, he is not to be held up as peculiarly a\r\ndisunionist. Allow me to say, in reference to this matter, I regret that\r\nyou have brought it about, but it is true that this epithet \"disunionist\"\r\nis likely soon to have very little terror in it in the South. Words do\r\nnot make things. \"Rebel\" was designed as a very odious term when applied\r\nby those who would have trampled on the rights of our ancestors, but I\r\nbelieve that the expression became not an ungrateful one to the ears\r\nof those who resisted them. It was not the lowest term of abuse to call\r\nthose who were conscious that they were struggling against oppression;\r\nand let me assure gentlemen that the term disunionist is rapidly\r\nassuming at the South the meaning which rebel took when it was baptized\r\nin the blood of Warren at Bunker Hill, and illustrated by the gallantry\r\nof Jasper at Fort Moultrie. * * *\r\n\r\nMR. CLAY:--Mr. President, I said nothing with respect to the character\r\nof Mr. Rhett, for I might as well name him. I know him personally,\r\nand have some respect for him. But, if he pronounced the sentiment\r\nattributed to him--of raising the standard of disunion and of resistance\r\nto the common government, whatever he has been, if he follows up that\r\ndeclaration by corresponding overt acts, he will be a traitor, and I\r\nhope he will meet the fate of a traitor.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:--The Chair will be under the necessity of ordering the\r\ngallery to be cleared if there is again the slightest interruption. He\r\nhas once already given warning that he is under the necessity of keeping\r\norder. The Senate chamber is not a theatre.\r\n\r\nMR. CLAY:--Mr. President, I have heard with pain and regret a\r\nconfirmation of the remark I made, that the sentiment of disunion is\r\nbecoming familiar. I hope it is confined to South Carolina. I do not\r\nregard as my duty what the honorable Senator seems to regard as his. If\r\nKentucky to-morrow unfurls the banner of resistance unjustly, I never\r\nwill fight under that banner. I owe a paramount allegiance to the whole\r\nUnion--a subordinate one to my own State. When my State is right--when\r\nit has a cause for resistance--when tyranny, and wrong, and oppression\r\ninsufferable arise, I will then share her fortunes; but if she summons\r\nme to the battle-field, or to support her in any cause which is unjust,\r\nagainst the Union, never, never will I engage with her in such cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACIUSETTS. (BORN 1811, DIED 1884.)\r\n\r\nON THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT, BEFORE THE MASSACHUSETTS\r\nANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, AT BOSTON, JANUARY 27, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nI have to present, from the business committee, the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\nResolved; That the object of this society is now, as it has always been,\r\nto convince our countrymen, by arguments addressed to their hearts and\r\nconsciences, that slave-holding is a heinous crime, and that the duty,\r\nsafety, and interest of all concerned demand its immediate abolition\r\nwithout expatriation.\r\n\r\nI wish, Mr, Chairman, to notice some objections that have been made to\r\nour course ever since Mr. Garrison began his career, and which have been\r\nlately urged again, with considerable force and emphasis, in the\r\ncolumns of the London Leader, the able organ of a very respectable and\r\ninfluential class in England. * * * The charges to which I refer are\r\nthese: That, in dealing with slave-holders and their apologists, we\r\nindulge in fierce denunciations, instead of appealing to their reason\r\nand common sense by plain statements and fair argument; that we might\r\nhave won the sympathies and support of the nation, if we would have\r\nsubmitted to argue this question with a manly patience; but, instead of\r\nthis, we have outraged the feelings of the community by attacks, unjust\r\nand unnecessarily severe, on its most valued institutions, and gratified\r\nour spleen by indiscriminate abuse of leading men, who were often honest\r\nin their intentions, however mistaken in their views; that we have\r\nutterly neglected the ample means that lay around us to convert the\r\nnation, submitted to no discipline, formed no plan, been guided by no\r\nforesight, but hurried on in childish, reckless, blind, and hot-headed\r\nzeal,--bigots in the narrowness of our views, and fanatics in our blind\r\nfury of invective and malignant judgment of other men's motives.\r\n\r\nThere are some who come upon our platform, and give us the aid of names\r\nand reputations less burdened than ours with popular odium,who are\r\nperpetually urging us to exercise charity in our judgments of those\r\nabout us, and to consent to argue these questions. These men are ever\r\nparading their wish to draw a line between themselves and us,\r\nbecause they must be permitted to wait,--to trust more to reason than\r\nfeeling,--to indulge a generous charity,--to rely on the sure influence\r\nof simple truth, uttered in love, etc., etc. I reject with scorn all\r\nthese implications that our judgments are uncharitable,--that we are\r\nlacking in patience,--that we have any other dependence than on the\r\nsimple truth, spoken with Christian frankness, yet with Christian\r\nlove. These lectures, to which you, sir, and all of us, have so often\r\nlistened, would be impertinent, if they were not rather ridiculous for\r\nthe gross ignorance they betray of the community, of the cause, and of\r\nthe whole course of its friends.\r\n\r\nThe article in the _Leader_ to which I refer is signed \"ION,\" and may\r\nbe found in the _Liberator_ of December 17, 1852. * * * \"Ion\" quotes\r\nMr Garrison's original declaration in the _Liberator_: \"I am aware that\r\nmany object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause\r\nfor severity? I _will_ be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as\r\njustice. I am in earnest,--I will not equivocate,--I will not excuse,--I\r\nwill not retreat a single inch,--AND I WILL BE HEARD. It is pretended\r\nthat I am retarding the cause of emancipation by the coarseness of my\r\ninvective and the precipitancy of my measures. The charge is not true.\r\nOn this question, my influence, humble as it is, is felt at this\r\nmoment to a considerable extent, and shall be felt in coming years, not\r\nperniciously, but beneficially; not as a curse, but as a blessing; and\r\nposterity will bear testimony that I was right. I desire to thank\r\nGod that He enables me to disregard 'the fear of man which bringeth a\r\nsnare,' and to speak His truth in its simplicity and power.\" * * *\r\n\r\n\"Ion's\" charges are the old ones, that we Abolitionists are hurting our\r\nown cause; that, instead of waiting for the community to come up to our\r\nviews, and endeavoring to remove prejudice and enlighten ignorance by\r\npatient explanation and fair argument, we fall at once, like children,\r\nto abusing every thing and everybody; that we imagine zeal will supply\r\nthe place of common sense; that we have never shown any sagacity\r\nin adapting our means to our ends; have never studied the national\r\ncharacter, or attempted to make use of the materials which lay all about\r\nus to influence public opinion, but by blind, childish, obstinate fury\r\nand indiscriminate denunciation, have become \"honestly impotent, and\r\nconscientious hinderances.\"\r\n\r\nI claim, before you who know the true state of the case, I claim for\r\nthe antislavery movement with which this society is identified, that,\r\nlooking back over its whole course, and considering the men connected\r\nwith it in the mass, it has been marked by sound judgment, unerring\r\nforesight, the most sagacious adaptation of means to ends, the strictest\r\nself-discipline, the most thorough research, and an amount of patient\r\nand manly argument addressed to the conscience and intellect of the\r\nnation, such as no other cause of the kind, in England or this country,\r\nhas ever offered. I claim, also, that its course has been marked by a\r\ncheerful surrender of all individual claims to merit or leadership,--the\r\nmost cordial welcoming of the slightest effort, of every honest attempt,\r\nto lighten or to break the chain of the slave. I need not waste time by\r\nrepeating the superfluous confession that we are men, and therefore do\r\nnot claim to be perfect. Neither would I be understood as denying that\r\nwe use denunciation, and ridicule, and every other weapon that the human\r\nmind knows. We must plead guilty, if there be guilt in not knowing\r\nhow to separate the sin from the sinner. With all the fondness for\r\nabstractions attributed to us, we are not yet capable of that. We are\r\nfighting a momentous battle at desperate odds,--one against a thousand.\r\nEvery weapon that ability or ignorance, wit, wealth, prejudice, or\r\nfashion can command, is pointed against us. The guns are shotted to\r\ntheir lips. The arrows are poisoned. Fighting against such an array, we\r\ncannot afford to confine ourselves to any one weapon. The cause is not\r\nours, so that we might, rightfully, postpone or put in peril the victory\r\nby moderating our demands, stifling our convictions, or filing down\r\nour rebukes, to gratify any sickly taste of our own, or to spare the\r\ndelicate nerves of our neighbor. Our clients are three millions of\r\nChristian slaves, standing dumb suppliants at the threshold of the\r\nChristian world. They have no voice but ours to utter their complaints,\r\nor to demand justice. The press, the pulpit, the wealth, the literature,\r\nthe prejudices, the political arrangements, the present self-interest\r\nof the country, are all against us. God has given us no weapon but\r\nthe truth, faithfully uttered, and addressed, with the old prophets'\r\ndirectness, to the conscience of the individual sinner. The elements\r\nwhich control public opinion and mould the masses are against us. We can\r\nbut pick off here and there a man from the triumphant majority. We have\r\nfacts for those who think, arguments for those who reason; but he who\r\ncannot be reasoned out of his prejudices must be laughed out of them; he\r\nwho cannot be argued out of his selfishness must be shamed out of it by\r\nthe mirror of his hateful self held up relentlessly before his eyes. We\r\nlive in a land where every man makes broad his phylactery, inscribing\r\nthereon, \"All men are created equal,\"--\"God hath made of one blood all\r\nnations of men.\" It seems to us that in such a land there must be, on\r\nthis question of slavery, sluggards to be awakened, as well as doubters\r\nto be convinced. Many more, we verily believe, of the first than of\r\nthe last. There are far more dead hearts to be quickened, than confused\r\nintellects to be cleared up,--more dumb dogs to be made to speak, than\r\ndoubting consciences to be enlightened. We have use, then, sometimes,\r\nfor something beside argument.\r\n\r\nWhat is the denunciation with which we are charged? It is endeavoring,\r\nin our faltering human speech, to declare the enormity of the sin of\r\nmaking merchandize of men,--of separating husband and wife,--taking the\r\ninfant from its mother and selling the daughter to prostitution,--of\r\na professedly Christian nation denying, by statute, the Bible to every\r\nsixth man and woman of its population, and making it illegal for \"two\r\nor three\" to meet together, except a white man be present! What is\r\nthis harsh criticism of motives with which we are charged? It is\r\nsimply holding the intelligent and deliberate actor responsible for the\r\ncharacter and consequences of his acts. Is there any thing inherently\r\nwrong in such denunciation of such criticism? This we may claim,--we\r\nhave never judged a man but out of his own mouth. We have seldom, if\r\never, held him to account, except for acts of which he and his own\r\nfriends were proud. All that we ask the world and thoughtful men to note\r\nare the principles and deeds on which the American pulpit and American\r\npublic men plume themselves. We always allow our opponents to paint\r\ntheir own pictures. Our humble duty is to stand by and assure the\r\nspectators that what they would take for a knave or a hypocrite is\r\nreally, in American estimation, a Doctor of Divinity or a Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe South is one great brothel, where half a million of women are\r\nflogged to prostitution, or, worse still, are degraded to believe it\r\nhonorable. The public squares of half our great cities echo to the wail\r\nof families torn asunder at the auction-block; no one of our fair rivers\r\nthat has not closed over the negro seeking in death a refuge from a life\r\ntoo wretched to bear; thousands of fugitives skulk along our highways,\r\nafraid to tell their names, and trembling at the sight of a human being;\r\nfree men are kidnapped in our streets, to be plunged into that hell\r\nof slavery; and now and then one, as if by miracle, after long years\r\nreturns to make men aghast with his tale. The press says, \"It is all\r\nright\"; and the pulpit cries, \"Amen.\" They print the Bible in every\r\ntongue in which man utters his prayers; and they get the money to do so\r\nby agreeing never to give the book, in the language our mothers taught\r\nus, to any negro, free or bond, south of Mason and Dixon's line. The\r\npress says, \"It is all right\"; and the pulpit cries, \"Amen.\" The slave\r\nlifts up his imploring eyes, and sees in every face but ours the face\r\nof an enemy. Prove to me now that harsh rebuke, indignant denunciation,\r\nscathing sarcasm, and pitiless ridicule are wholly and always\r\nunjustifiable; else we dare not, in so desperate a case, throw away any\r\nweapon which ever broke up the crust of an ignorant prejudice, roused a\r\nslumbering conscience, shamed a proud sinner, or changed in any way the\r\nconduct of a human being. Our aim is to alter public opinion. Did we\r\nlive in a market, our talk should be of dollars and cents, and we would\r\nseek to prove only that slavery was an unprofitable investment. Were\r\nthe nation one great, pure church, we would sit down and reason of\r\n\"righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.\" Had slavery fortified\r\nitself in a college, we would load our cannons with cold facts, and\r\nwing our arrows with arguments. But we happen to live in the world,--the\r\nworld made up of thought and impulse, of self-conceit and self-interest,\r\nof weak men and wicked. To conquer, we must reach all. Our object is not\r\nto make every man a Christian or a philosopher, but to induce every one\r\nto aid in the abolition of slavery. We expect to accomplish our object\r\nlong before the nation is made over into saints or elevated into\r\nphilosophers. To change public opinion, we use the very tools by which\r\nit was formed. That is, all such as an honest man may touch.\r\n\r\nAll this I am not only ready to allow, but I should be ashamed to think\r\nof the slave, or to look into the face of my fellow-man, if it\r\nwere otherwise. It is the only thing which justifies us to our own\r\nconsciences, and makes us able to say we have done, or at least tried to\r\ndo, our duty.\r\n\r\nSo far, however you distrust my philosophy, you will not doubt my\r\nstatements. That we have denounced and rebuked with unsparing fidelity\r\nwill not be denied. Have we not also addressed ourselves to that other\r\nduty, of arguing our question thoroughly?--of using due discretion and\r\nfair sagacity in endeavoring to promote our cause? Yes, we have. Every\r\nstatement we have made has been doubted. Every principle we have laid\r\ndown has been denied by overwhelming majorities against us. No one step\r\nhas ever been gained but by the most laborious research and the most\r\nexhausting argument. And no question has ever, since Revolutionary days,\r\nbeen so thoroughly investigated or argued here, as that of slavery. Of\r\nthat research and that argument, of the whole of it, the old-fashioned,\r\nfanatical, crazy Garrisonian antislavery movement has been the author.\r\nFrom this band of men has proceeded every important argument or idea\r\nwhich has been broached on the antislavery question from 1830 to the\r\npresent time. I am well aware of the extent of the claim I make. I\r\nrecognize, as fully as any one can, the ability of the new laborers, the\r\neloquence and genius with which they have recommended this cause to the\r\nnation, and flashed conviction home on the conscience of the community.\r\nI do not mean, either, to assert that they have in every instance\r\nborrowed from our treasury their facts and arguments. Left to\r\nthemselves, they would probably have looked up the one and originated\r\nthe other. As a matter of fact, however, they have generally made use\r\nof the materials collected to their hands. * * * When once brought fully\r\ninto the struggle, they have found it necessary to adopt the same means,\r\nto rely on the same arguments, to hold up the same men and the same\r\nmeasures to public reprobation, with the same bold rebuke and unsparing\r\ninvective that we have used. All their conciliatory bearing, their\r\npainstaking moderation, their constant and anxious endeavor to draw a\r\nbroad line between their camp and ours, have been thrown away. Just so\r\nfar as they have been effective laborers, they have found, as we have,\r\ntheir hands against every man, and every man's hand against them. The\r\nmost experienced of them are ready to acknowledge that our plan has been\r\nwise, our course efficient, and that our unpopularity is no fault of\r\nours, but flows necessarily and unavoidably from our position. \"I should\r\nsuspect,\" says old Fuller, \"that his preaching had no salt in it, if no\r\ngalled horse did wince.\" Our friends find, after all, that men do not\r\nso much hate us as the truth we utter and the light we bring. They find\r\nthat the community are not the honest seekers after truth which they\r\nfancied, but selfish politicians and sectarian bigots, who shiver, like\r\nAlexander's butler, whenever the sun shines on them. Experience has\r\ndriven these new laborers back to our method. We have no quarrel with\r\nthem--would not steal one wreath of their laurels. All we claim is,\r\nthat, if they are to be complimented as prudent, moderate, Christian,\r\nsagacious, statesmanlike reformers, we deserve the same praise; for they\r\nhave done nothing that we, in our measure, did not attempt before.\r\n\r\nI claim this, that the cause, in its recent aspect, has put on nothing\r\nbut timidity. It has taken to itself no new weapons of recent years; it\r\nhas become more compromising,--that is all! It has become neither more\r\npersuasive, more earnest, more Christian, more charitable, nor more\r\neffective than for the twenty years pre-ceding. Mr. Hale, the head of\r\nthe Free Soil movement, after a career in the Senate that would do honor\r\nto any man,--after a six years' course which entitles him to the respect\r\nand confidence of the antislavery public, can put his name, within\r\nthe last month, to an appeal from the city of Washington, signed by a\r\nHouston and a Cass, for a monument to be raised to Henry Clay! If that\r\nbe the test of charity and courtesy, we cannot give it to the world.\r\nSome of the leaders of the Free Soil party of Massachusetts, after\r\nexhausting the whole capacity of our language to paint the treachery of\r\nDaniel Webster to the cause of liberty, and the evil they thought he was\r\nable and seeking to do,--after that, could feel it in their hearts to\r\nparade themselves in the funeral procession got up to do him honor! In\r\nthis we allow we cannot follow them. The deference which every gentleman\r\nowes to the proprieties of social life, that self-respect and regard to\r\nconsistency which is every man's duty,--these, if no deeper feelings,\r\nwill ever prevent us from giving such proofs of this newly invented\r\nChristian courtesy. We do not play politics, antislavery is no half-jest\r\nwith us; it is a terrible earnest, with life or death, worse than life\r\nor death, on the issue. It is no lawsuit, where it matters not to the\r\ngood feeling of opposing counsel which way the verdict goes, and where\r\nadvocates can shake hands after the decision as pleasantly as before.\r\nWhen we think of such a man as Henry Clay, his long life, his mighty\r\ninfluence cast always into the scale against the slave, of that\r\nirresistible fascination with which he moulded every one to his will;\r\nwhen we remember that, his conscience acknowledging the justice of our\r\ncause, and his heart open on every other side to the gentlest impulses,\r\nhe could sacrifice so remorselessly his convictions and the welfare of\r\nmillions to his low ambition; when we think how the slave trembled at\r\nthe sound of his voice, and that, from a multitude of breaking hearts\r\nthere went up nothing but gratitude to God when it pleased him to call\r\nthat great sinner from this world, we cannot find it in our hearts, we\r\ncould not shape our lips to ask any man to do him honor. No amount of\r\neloquence, no sheen of official position, no loud grief of partisan\r\nfriends, would ever lead us to ask monuments or walk in fine processions\r\nfor pirates; and the sectarian zeal or selfish ambition which gives up,\r\ndeliberately and in full knowledge of the facts, three million of human\r\nbeings to hopeless ignorance, daily robbery, systematic prostitution,\r\nand murder, which the law is neither able nor undertakes to prevent\r\nor avenge, is more monstrous, in our eyes, than the love of gold which\r\ntakes a score of lives with merciful quickness on the high seas. Haynau\r\non the Danube is no more hateful to us than Haynau on the Potomac. Why\r\ngive mobs to one and monuments to the other?\r\n\r\nIf these things be necessary to courtesy, I cannot claim that we are\r\ncourteous. We seek only to be honest men, and speak the same of the dead\r\nas of the living. If the grave that hides their bodies could swallow\r\nalso the evil they have done and the example they leave, we might enjoy\r\nat least the luxury of forgetting them. But the evil that men do lives\r\nafter them, and example acquires tenfold authority when it speaks from\r\nthe grave. History, also, is to be written. How shall a feeble minority,\r\nwithout weight or influence in the country, with no jury of millions to\r\nappeal to--denounced, vilified, and contemned,--how shall we make way\r\nagainst the overwhelming weight of some colossal reputation, if we do\r\nnot turn from the idolatrous present, and appeal to the human race?\r\nsaying to your idols of to-day: \"Here we are defeated; but we will write\r\nour judgment with the iron pen of a century to come, and it shall never\r\nbe forgotten, if we can help it, that you were false in your generation\r\nto the claims of the slave!\" * * *\r\n\r\nWe are weak here,--out-talked, out-voted. You load our names with\r\ninfamy, and shout us down. But our words bide their time. We warn the\r\nliving that we have terrible memories, and their sins are never to be\r\nforgotten. We will gibbet the name of every apostate so black and high\r\nthat his children's children shall blush to bear it. Yet we bear no\r\nmalice,--cherish no resentment. We thank God that the love of fame,\r\n\"that last infirmity of noble minds,\" is shared by the ignoble. In our\r\nnecessity, we seize this weapon in the slave's behalf, and teach caution\r\nto the living by meting out relentless justice to the dead. * * *\r\n\"These, Mr. Chairman, are the reasons why, we take care that 'the memory\r\nof the wicked shall rot.'\"\r\n\r\nI have claimed that the antislavery cause has, from the first, been ably\r\nand dispassionately argued, every objection candidly examined, and every\r\ndifficulty or doubt anywhere honestly entertained treated with respect.\r\nLet me glance at the literature of the cause, and try not so much, in\r\na brief hour, to prove this assertion, as to point out the sources from\r\nwhich any one may satisfy himself of its truth.\r\n\r\nI will begin with certainly the ablest and perhaps the most honest\r\nstatesman who has ever touched the slave question. Any one who will\r\nexamine John Quincy Adams' speech on Texas, in 1838, will see that\r\nhe was only seconding the full and able exposure of the Texas plot,\r\nprepared by Benjamin Lundy, to one of whose pamphlets Dr. Channing,\r\nin his \"Letter to Henry Clay,\" has confessed his obligation. Every one\r\nacquainted with those years will allow that the North owes its earliest\r\nknowledge and first awakening on that subject to Mr. Lundy, who made\r\nlong journeys and devoted years to the investigation. His labors have\r\nthis attestation, that they quickened the zeal and strengthened the\r\nhands of such men as Adams and Channing. I have been told that Mr. Lundy\r\nprepared a brief for Mr. Adams, and furnished him the materials for his\r\nspeech on Texas.\r\n\r\nLook next at the right of petition. Long before any member of Congress\r\nhad opened his mouth in its defence, the Abolition presses and lecturers\r\nhad examined and defended the limits of this right with profound\r\nhistorical research and eminent constitutional ability. So thoroughly\r\nhad the work been done, that all classes of the people had made up their\r\nminds about it long before any speaker of eminence had touched it in\r\nCongress. The politicians were little aware of this. When Mr. Adams\r\nthrew himself so gallantly into the breach, it is said he wrote\r\nanxiously home to know whether he would be supported in Massachusetts,\r\nlittle aware of the outburst of popular gratitude which the northern\r\nbreeze was even then bringing him, deep and cordial enough to wipe away\r\nthe old grudge Massachusetts had borne him so long. Mr. Adams himself\r\nwas only in favor of receiving the petitions, and advised to refuse\r\ntheir prayer, which was the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia. He doubted the power of Congress to abolish. His doubts were\r\nexamined by Mr. William Goodell, in two letters of most acute logic,\r\nand of masterly ability. If Mr. Adams still retained his doubts, it is\r\ncertain at least that he never expressed them afterward. When Mr. Clay\r\nparaded the same objections, the whole question of the power of Congress\r\nover the District was treated by Theodore D. Weld in the fullest manner,\r\nand with the widest research,--indeed, leaving nothing to be added:\r\nan argument which Dr. Channing characterized as \"demonstration,\" and\r\npronounced the essay \"one of the ablest pamphlets from the American\r\npress.\" No answer was ever attempted. The best proof of its ability is\r\nthat no one since has presumed to doubt the power. Lawyers and statesmen\r\nhave tacitly settled down into its full acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Colonization Society on the welfare of the colored\r\nrace was the first question our movement encountered. To the close\r\nlogic, eloquent appeals, and fully sustained charges of Mr. Garrison's\r\nletters on that subject no answer was ever made. Judge Jay followed\r\nwith a work full and able, establishing every charge by the most patient\r\ninvestigation of facts. It is not too much to say of these two volumes,\r\nthat they left the Colonization Society hopeless at the North. It dares\r\nnever show its face before the people, and only lingers in some few\r\nnooks of sectarian pride, so secluded from the influence of present\r\nideas as to be almost fossil in their character.\r\n\r\nThe practical working of the slave system, the slave laws, the treatment\r\nof slaves, their food, the duration of their lives, their ignorance and\r\nmoral condition, and the influence of Southern public opinion on their\r\nfate, have been spread out in a detail and with a fulness of evidence\r\nwhich no subject has ever received before in this country. Witness the\r\nwords of Phelps, Bourne, Rankin, Grimke, the _Anti-slavery Record_, and,\r\nabove all, that encyclopaedia of facts and storehouse of arguments, the\r\n_Thousand Witnesses_ of Mr. Theodore D. Weld. He also prepared that full\r\nand valuable tract for the World's Convention called _Slavery and the\r\nInternal Slave-Trade_ in the United States, published in London in 1841.\r\nUnique in antislavery literature is Mrs. Child's _Appeal_, one of the\r\nablest of our weapons, and one of the finest efforts of her rare genius.\r\n\r\n_The Princeton Review_, I believe, first challenged the Abolitionists\r\nto an investigation of the teachings of the Bible on slavery. That field\r\nhad been somewhat broken by our English predecessors. But in England the\r\npro-slavery party had been soon shamed out of the attempt to drag the\r\nBible into their service, and hence the discussion there had been short\r\nand some-what superficial. The pro-slavery side of the question has been\r\neagerly sustained by theological reviews and doctors of divinity without\r\nnumber, from the half-way and timid faltering of Wayland up to the\r\nunblushing and melancholy recklessness of Stuart. The argument on the\r\nother side has come wholly from the Abolitionists; for neither Dr. Hague\r\nnor Dr. Barnes can be said to have added any thing to the wide research,\r\ncritical acumen, and comprehensive views of Theodore D. Weld, Beriah\r\nGreen, J. G. Fee, and the old work of Duncan.\r\n\r\nOn the constitutional questions which have at various times arisen,--the\r\ncitizenship of the colored man, the soundness of the \"Prigg\" decision,\r\nthe constitutionality of the old Fugitive Slave Law, the true\r\nconstruction of the slave-surrender clause,--nothing has been added,\r\neither in the way of fact or argument, to the works of Jay, Weld, Alvan\r\nStewart, E. G. Loring, S. E. Sewall, Richard Hildreth, W. I. Bowditch,\r\nthe masterly essays of the _Emancipator_ at New York and the _Liberator_\r\nat Boston, and the various addresses of the Massachusetts and American\r\nSocieties for the last twenty years. The idea of the antislavery\r\ncharacter of the Constitution,--the opiate with which Free Soil quiets\r\nits conscience for voting under a pro-slavery government,--I heard first\r\nsuggested by Mr. Garrison in 1838. It was elaborately argued that\r\nyear in all our antislavery gatherings, both here and in New York, and\r\nsustained with great ability by Alvan Stewart, and in part by T. D.\r\nWeld. The antislavery construction of the Constitution was ably argued\r\nin 1836, in the _Antislavery Magazine_, by Rev. Samuel J. May, one of\r\nthe very first to seek the side of Mr. Garrison, and pledge to the slave\r\nhis life and efforts,--a pledge which thirty years of devoted labors\r\nhave redeemed. If it has either merit or truth, they are due to no\r\nlegal learning recently added to our ranks, but to some of the old\r\nand well-known pioneers. This claim has since received the fullest\r\ninvestigation from Mr. Lysander Spooner, who has urged it with all his\r\nunrivalled ingenuity, laborious research, and close logic. He writes\r\nas a lawyer, and has no wish, I believe, to be ranked with any class of\r\nanti-slavery men.\r\n\r\nThe influence of slavery on our Government has received the profoundest\r\nphilosophical investigation from the pen of Richard Hildreth, in his\r\ninvaluable essay on _Despotism in America_,--a work which deserves a\r\nplace by the side of the ablest political disquisitions of any age.\r\n\r\nEven the vigorous mind of Rantoul, the ablest man, without doubt, of\r\nthe Democratic party, and perhaps the ripest politician in New England,\r\nadded little or nothing to the store-house of antislavery argument. *\r\n* * His speeches on our question, too short and too few, are remarkable\r\nfor their compact statement, iron logic, bold denunciation, and the\r\nwonderful light thrown back upon our history. Yet how little do they\r\npresent which was not familiar for years in our anti-slavery\r\nmeetings! Look, too, at the last great effort of the idol of so many\r\nthousands,--Mr. Senator Sumner,--the discussion of a great national\r\nquestion, of which it has been said that we must go back to Webster's\r\nreply to Hayne, and Fisher Ames on the Jay treaty, to find its equal in\r\nCongress,--praise which we might perhaps qualify, if any adequate report\r\nwere left us of some of the noble orations of Adams. No one can be blind\r\nto the skilful use he has made of his materials, the consummate ability\r\nwith which he has marshalled them, and the radiant glow which his genius\r\nhas thrown over all. Yet, with the exception of his reference to the\r\nantislavery debate in Congress in 1817, there is hardly a train of\r\nthought or argument, and no single fact in the whole speech, which has\r\nnot been familiar in our meetings and essays for the last ten\r\nyears. * * *\r\n\r\nThe relations of the American Church to slavery, and the duties of\r\nprivate Christians, the whole casuistry of this portion of the question,\r\nso momentous among descendants of the Puritans,--have been discussed\r\nwith great acuteness and rare common-sense by Messrs. Garrison, Goodell,\r\nGerrit Smith, Pillsbury, and Foster. They have never attempted to judge\r\nthe American Church by any standard except that which she has herself\r\nlaid down,--never claimed that she should be perfect, but have contented\r\nthemselves by demanding that she should be consistent. They have never\r\njudged her except out of her own mouth, and on facts asserted by her\r\nown presses and leaders. The sundering of the Methodist and Baptist\r\ndenominations, and the universal agitation of the religious world,\r\nare the best proof of the sagacity with which their measures have been\r\nchosen, the cogent arguments they have used, and the indisputable\r\nfacts on which their criticisms have been founded. In nothing have the\r\nAbolitionists shown more sagacity or more thorough knowledge of their\r\ncountrymen than in the course they have pursued in relation to the\r\nChurch. None but a New-Englander can appreciate the power which church\r\norganizations wield over all who share the blood of the Puritans. The\r\ninfluence of each sect over its own members is overwhelming, often\r\nshutting out, or controlling, all other influences. We have Popes here,\r\nall the more dangerous because no triple crown puts you on your guard.\r\n* * * In such a land, the Abolitionists early saw, that, for a moral\r\nquestion like theirs, only two paths lay open: to work through the\r\nChurch; that failing, to join battle with it. Some tried long, like\r\nLuther, to be Protestants, and yet not come out of Catholicism; but\r\ntheir eyes were soon opened. Since then we have been convinced that, to\r\ncome out from the Church, to hold her up as the bulwark of slavery, and\r\nto make her shortcomings the main burden of our appeals to the religious\r\nsentiment of the community, was our first duty and best policy. This\r\ncourse alienated many friends, and was a subject of frequent rebuke from\r\nsuch men as Dr. Channing. But nothing has ever more strengthened the\r\ncause, or won it more influence; and it has had the healthiest effect on\r\nthe Church itself. * * *\r\n\r\nUnable to command a wide circulation for our books and journals, we have\r\nbeen obliged to bring ourselves into close contact with the people, and\r\nto rely mainly on public addresses. These have been our most efficient\r\ninstrumentality. For proof that these addresses have been full of\r\npertinent facts, sound sense, and able arguments, we must necessarily\r\npoint to results, and demand to be tried by our fruits. Within these\r\nlast twenty years it has been very rare that any fact stated by our\r\nlecturers has been disproved, or any statement of theirs successfully\r\nimpeached. And for evidence of the soundness, simplicity, and pertinency\r\nof their arguments we can only claim that our converts and co-laborers\r\nthroughout the land have at least the reputation of being specially able\r\n\"to give a reason for the faith that is in them.\"\r\n\r\nI remember that when, in 1845, the present leaders of the Free Soil\r\nparty, with Daniel Webster in their company, met to draw up the\r\nAnti-Texas Address of the Massachusetts Convention, they sent to\r\nAbolitionists for anti-slavery facts and history, for the remarkable\r\ntestimonies of our Revolutionary great men which they wished to quote.\r\nWhen, many years ago, the Legislature of Massachusetts wished to send to\r\nCongress a resolution affirming the duty of immediate emancipation, the\r\ncommittee sent to William Lloyd Garrison to draw it up, and it stands\r\nnow on our statute-book as he drafted it.\r\n\r\nHow vigilantly, how patiently, did we watch the Texas plot from its\r\ncommencement! The politic South felt that its first move had been too\r\nbold, and thenceforward worked underground. For many a year men laughed\r\nat us for entertaining any apprehensions. It was impossible to rouse the\r\nNorth to its peril. David Lee Child was thought crazy because he would\r\nnot believe there was no danger. His elaborate \"_Letters on Texas\r\nAnnexation_\" are the ablest and most valuable contribution that has\r\nbeen made toward a history of the whole plot. Though we foresaw and\r\nproclaimed our conviction that annexation would be, in the end, a fatal\r\nstep for the South, we did not feel at liberty to relax our opposition,\r\nwell knowing the vast increase of strength it would give, at first, to\r\nthe slave power. I remember being one of a committee which waited\r\non Abbott Lawrence, a year or so only before annexation, to ask his\r\ncountenance to some general movement, without distinction of party,\r\nagainst the Texas scheme. He smiled at our fears, begged us to have\r\nno apprehensions; stating that his correspondence with leading men at\r\nWashington enabled him to assure us annexation was impossible, and that\r\nthe South itself was determined to defeat the project. A short time\r\nafter, Senators and Representatives from Texas took their seats in\r\nCongress!\r\n\r\nMany of these services to the slave were done before I joined his cause.\r\nIn thus referring to them, do not suppose me merely seeking occasion of\r\neulogy on my predecessors and present co-laborers. I recall these things\r\nonly to rebut the contemptuous criticism which some about us make the\r\nexcuse for their past neglect of the movement, and in answer to\r\n\"Ion's\" representation of our course as reckless fanaticism, childish\r\nimpatience, utter lack of good sense, and of our meetings as scenes only\r\nof excitement, of reckless and indiscriminate denunciation. I assert\r\nthat every social, moral, economical, religious, political, and\r\nhistorical aspect of the question has been ably and patiently examined.\r\nAnd all this has been done with an industry and ability which have left\r\nlittle for the professional skill, scholarly culture, and historical\r\nlearning of the new laborers to accomplish. If the people are still in\r\ndoubt, it is from the inherent difficulty of the subject, or a hatred of\r\nlight, not from want of it. * * *\r\n\r\nSir, when a nation sets itself to do evil, and all its leading forces,\r\nwealth, party, and piety, join in the career, it is impossible but that\r\nthose who offer a constant opposition should be hated and maligned, no\r\nmatter how wise, cautious, and well planned their course may be. We\r\nare peculiar sufferers in this way. The community has come to hate its\r\nreproving Nathan so bitterly, that even those whom the relenting part of\r\nit are beginning to regard as standard-bearers of the antislavery host\r\nthink it unwise to avow any connection or sympathy with him. I refer to\r\nsome of the leaders of the political movement against slavery. They feel\r\nit to be their mission to marshal and use as effectively as possible\r\nthe present convictions of the people. They cannot afford to encumber\r\nthemselves with the odium which twenty years of angry agitation have\r\nengendered in great sects sore from unsparing rebuke, parties galled by\r\nconstant defeat, and leading men provoked by unexpected exposure. They\r\nare willing to confess, privately, that our movement produced theirs,\r\nand that its continued existence is the very breath of their life. But,\r\nat the same time, they would fain walk on the road without being soiled\r\nby too close contact with the rough pioneers who threw it up. They are\r\nwise and honorable, and their silence is very expressive.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of their eminent position and acknowledged ability, another\r\nthought strikes me. Who converted these men and their distinguished\r\nassociates? It is said we have shown neither sagacity in plans,\r\nnor candor in discussion, nor ability. Who, then, or what converted\r\nBurlingame and Wilson, Sumner and Adams, Palfrey and Mann, Chase and\r\nHale, and Phillips and Giddings? Who taught the _Christian Register_,\r\nthe _Daily Advertiser_, and that class of prints, that there were such\r\nthings as a slave and a slave-holder in the land, and so gave them some\r\nmore intelligent basis than their mere instincts to hate William Lloyd\r\nGarrison? What magic wand was it whose touch made the todying servility\r\nof the land start up the real demon that it was, and at the same\r\ntime gathered into the slave's service the professional ability, ripe\r\nculture, and personal integrity which grace the Free Soil ranks? We\r\nnever argue! These men, then, were converted by simple denunciation!\r\nThey were all converted by the \"hot,\" \"reckless,\" \"ranting,\" \"bigoted,\"\r\n\"fanatic\" Garrison, who never troubled himself about facts, nor stopped\r\nto argue with an opponent, but straightway knocked him down! My old\r\nand valued friend, Mr. Sumner, often boasts that he was a reader of the\r\n_Liberator_ before I was. Do not criticise too much the agency by which\r\nsuch men were converted. That blade has a double edge. Our reckless\r\ncourse, our empty rant, our fanaticism, has made Abolitionists of some\r\nof the best and ablest men in the land. We are inclined to go on, and\r\nsee if, even with such poor tools, we cannot make some more. Antislavery\r\nzeal and the roused conscience of the \"godless comeouters\" made the\r\ntrembling South demand the Fugitive Slave Law, and the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw provoked Mrs. Stowe to the good work of \"Uncle Tom.\" That is\r\nsomething! Let me say, in passing, that you will nowhere find an earlier\r\nor more generous appreciation, or more flowing eulogy, of these men and\r\ntheir labors, than in the columns of the _Liberator_. No one, however\r\nfeeble, has ever peeped or muttered, in any quarter, that the vigilant\r\neye of the _Pioneer_ has not recognized him. He has stretched out the\r\nright hand of a most cordial welcome the moment any man's face was\r\nturned Zionward.\r\n\r\nI do not mention these things to praise Mr. Garrison; I do not stand\r\nhere for that purpose. You will not deny--if you do, I can prove\r\nit--that the movement of the Abolitionists converted these men. Their\r\nconstituents were converted by it. The assault upon the right of\r\npetition, upon the right to print and speak of slavery, the denial of\r\nthe right of Congress over the District, the annexation of Texas,\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law, were measures which the anti-slavery movement\r\nprovoked, and the discussion of which has made all the Abolitionists we\r\nhave. The antislavery cause, then, converted these men; it gave them a\r\nconstituency; it gave them an opportunity to speak, and it gave them a\r\npublic to listen. The antislavery cause gave them their votes, got them\r\ntheir offices, furnished them their facts, gave them their audience.\r\nIf you tell me they cherished all these principles in their own breasts\r\nbefore Mr. Garrison appeared, I can only say, if the anti-slavery\r\nmovement did not give them their ideas, it surely gave the courage to\r\nutter them.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, is it not singular that the name of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison has never been pronounced on the floor of the United States\r\nCongress linked with any epithet but that of contempt! No one of those\r\nmen who owe their ideas, their station, their audience, to him,\r\nhave ever thought it worth their while to utter one word in grateful\r\nrecognition of the power which called them into being. When obliged, by\r\nthe course of their argument, to treat the question historically, they\r\ncan go across the water to Clarkson and Wilberforce--yes, to a safe\r\nsalt-water distance. As Daniel Webster, when he was talking to the\r\nfarmers of Western New York, and wished to contrast slave labor and free\r\nlabor, did not dare to compare New York with Virginia--sister States,\r\nunder the same government, planted by the same race, worshipping at the\r\nsame altar, speaking the same language--identical in all respects, save\r\nthat one in which he wished to seek the contrast; but no; he compared\r\nit with Cuba--the contrast was so close! Catholic--Protestant;\r\nSpanish--Saxon; despotism--municipal institutions; readers of Lope de\r\nVega and of Shakespeare; mutterers of the Mass--children of the Bible!\r\nBut Virginia is too near home! So is Garrison! One would have thought\r\nthere was something in the human breast which would sometimes break\r\nthrough policy. These noble-hearted men whom I have named must surely\r\nhave found quite irksome the constant practice of what Dr. Gardiner used\r\nto call \"that despicable virtue, prudence.\" One would have thought, when\r\nthey heard that name spoken with contempt, their ready eloquence would\r\nhave leaped from its scabbard to avenge even a word that threatened\r\nhim with insult. But it never came--never! I do not say I blame them.\r\nPerhaps they thought they should serve the cause better by drawing a\r\nbroad black line between themselves and him. Perhaps they thought the\r\nDevil could be cheated: I do not!\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nCaution is not always good policy in a cause like ours. It is said that,\r\nwhen Napoleon saw the day going against him, he used to throw away\r\nall the rules of war, and trust himself to the hot impetuosity of his\r\nsoldiers. The masses are governed more by impulse than conviction, and\r\neven were it not so, the convictions of most men are on our side,\r\nand this will surely appear, if we can only pierce the crust of their\r\nprejudice or indifference. I observe that our Free Soil friends never\r\nstir their audience so deeply as when some individual leaps beyond the\r\nplatform, and strikes upon the very heart of the people. Men listen to\r\ndiscussions of laws and tactics with ominous patience. It is when Mr.\r\nSumner, in Faneuil Hall, avows his determination to disobey the\r\nFugitive Slave Law, and cries out: \"I was a man before I was a\r\nCommissioner,\"--when Mr. Giddings says of the fall of slavery, quoting\r\nAdams: \"Let it come. If it must come in blood, yet I say let it\r\ncome!\"--that their associates on the platform are sure they are\r\nwrecking the party,--while many a heart beneath beats its first pulse of\r\nanti-slavery life.\r\n\r\nThese are brave words. When I compare them with the general tone of Free\r\nSoil men in Congress, I distrust the atmosphere of Washington and of\r\npolitics. These men move about, Sauls and Goliaths among us, taller by\r\nmany a cubit. There they lose port and stature. Mr. Sumner's speech\r\nin the Senate unsays no part of his Faneuil Hall pledge. But, though\r\ndiscussing the same topic, no one would gather from any word or argument\r\nthat the speaker ever took such ground as he did in Faneuil Hall. It\r\nis all through, the law, the manner of the surrender, not the surrender\r\nitself, of the slave, that he objects to. As my friend Mr. Pillsbury\r\nso forcibly says, so far as any thing in the speech shows, he puts the\r\nslave behind the jury trial, behind the habeas corpus act, and behind\r\nthe new interpretation of the Constitution, and says to the slave\r\nclaimant: \"You must get through all these before you reach him; but, if\r\nyou can get through all these, you may have him!\" It was no tone like\r\nthis which made the old Hall rock! Not if he got through twelve jury\r\ntrials, and forty habeas corpus acts, and constitutions built high\r\nas yonder monument, would he permit so much as the shadow of a little\r\nfinger of the slave claimant to touch the slave! At least so he was\r\nunderstood. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. Mann, in his speech of February 5, 1850, says: \"The States being\r\nseparated, I would as soon return my own brother or sister into bondage,\r\nas I would return a fugitive slave. Before God, and Christ, and all\r\nChristian men, they are my brothers and sisters.\" What a condition! From\r\nthe lips, too, of a champion of the Higher Law! Whether the States\r\nbe separate or united, neither my brother nor any other man's brother\r\nshall, with my consent, go back to bondage! So speaks the heart--Mr.\r\nMann's version is that of the politician.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me a very mistaken strain. Whenever slavery is banished\r\nfrom our national jurisdiction, it will be a momentous gain, a vast\r\nstride. But let us not mistake the half-way house for the end of the\r\njourney. I need not say that it matters not to Abolitionists under what\r\nspecial law slavery exists. Their battle lasts while it exists anywhere,\r\nand I doubt not Mr. Sumner and Mr. Giddings feel themselves enlisted\r\nfor the whole war. I will even suppose, what neither of these gentlemen\r\nstates, that their plan includes not only that slavery shall be\r\nabolished in the District and Territories but that the slave basis\r\nof representation shall be struck from the Constitution, and the\r\nslave-surrender clause construed away. But even then does Mr. Giddings\r\nor Mr. Sumner really believe that slavery, existing in its full force in\r\nthe States, \"will cease to vex our national politics?\" Can they point to\r\nany State where a powerful oligarchy, possessed of immense wealth, has\r\never existed without attempting to meddle in the government? Even now,\r\ndoes not manufacturing, banking, and commercial capital perpetually vex\r\nour politics? Why should not slave capital exert the same influence?\r\nDo they imagine that a hundred thousand men, possessed of two thousand\r\nmillions of dollars, which they feel the spirit of the age is seeking\r\nto tear from their grasp, will not eagerly catch at all the support they\r\ncan obtain by getting the control of the government? In a land where the\r\ndollar is almighty, \"where the sin of not being rich is only atoned for\r\nby the effort to become so,\" do they doubt that such an oligarchy will\r\ngenerally succeed? Besides, banking and manufacturing stocks are not\r\nurged by despair to seek a controlling influence in politics. They know\r\nthey are about equally safe, whichever party rules--that no party wishes\r\nto legislate their rights away. Slave property knows that its being\r\nallowed to exist depends on its having the virtual control of the\r\ngovernment. Its constant presence in politics is dictated, therefore,\r\nby despair, as well as by the wish to secure fresh privileges. Money,\r\nhowever, is not the only strength of the slave power. That, indeed, were\r\nenough, in an age when capitalists are our feudal barons. But, though\r\ndriven entirely from national shelter, the slave-holders would have the\r\nstrength of old associations, and of peculiar laws in their own States,\r\nwhich give those States wholly into their hands. A weaker prestige,\r\nfewer privileges, and less comparative wealth, have enabled the British\r\naristocracy to rule England for two centuries, though the root of their\r\nstrength was cut at Naseby. It takes ages for deeply-rooted institutions\r\nto die; and driving slavery into the States will hardly be our Naseby. *\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Sumner \"knows no better aim, under the Constitution, than to\r\nbring back the government to where it was in 1789!\" Has the voyage been\r\nso very honest and prosperous a one, in his opinion, that his only\r\nwish is to start again with the same ship, the same crew, and the same\r\nsailing orders? Grant all he claims as to the state of public opinion,\r\nthe intentions of leading men, and the form of our institutions at that\r\nperiod; still, with all these checks on wicked men, and helps to good\r\nones, here we are, in 1853, according to his own showing, ruled by\r\nslavery, tainted to the core with slavery, and binding the infamous\r\nFugitive Slave Law like an honorable frontlet on our brows. The more\r\naccurate and truthful his glowing picture of the public virtue of 1789,\r\nthe stronger my argument. If even all those great patriots, and all that\r\nenthusiasm for justice and liberty, did not avail to keep us safe\r\nin such a Union, what will? In such desperate circumstances, can his\r\nstatesmanship devise no better aim than to try the same experiment over\r\nagain, under precisely the same conditions? What new guaranties does he\r\npropose to prevent the voyage from being again turned into a piratical\r\nslave-trading cruise? None! Have sixty years taught us nothing? In 1660,\r\nthe English thought, in recalling Charles II., that the memory of that\r\nscaffold which had once darkened the windows of Whitehall would be\r\nguaranty enough for his good behavior. But, spite of the spectre,\r\nCharles II. repeated Charles I., and James outdid him. Wiser by this\r\nexperience, when the nation in 1689 got another chance, they trusted\r\nto no guaranties, but so arranged the very elements of their government\r\nthat William III. could not repeat Charles I. Let us profit by the\r\nlesson. * * *\r\n\r\nIf all I have said to you is untrue, if I have exaggerated, explain to\r\nme this fact. In 1831, Mr. Garrison commenced a paper advocating the\r\ndoctrine of immediate emancipation. He had against him the thirty\r\nthousand churches and all the clergy of the country,--its wealth, its\r\ncommerce, its press. In 1831, what was the state of things? There was\r\nthe most entire ignorance and apathy on the slave question. If men\r\nknew of the existence of slavery, it was only as a part of picturesque\r\nVirginia life. No one preached, no one talked, no one wrote about it. No\r\nwhisper of it stirred the surface of the political sea. The church heard\r\nof it occasionally, when some colonization agent asked funds to send\r\nthe blacks to Africa. Old school-books tainted with some antislavery\r\nselections had passed out of use, and new ones were compiled to suit the\r\ntimes. Soon as any dissent from the prevailing faith appeared, every one\r\nset himself to crush it. The pulpits preached at it; the press denounced\r\nit; mobs tore down houses, threw presses into the fire and the stream,\r\nand shot the editors; religious conventions tried to smother it; parties\r\narrayed themselves against it. Daniel Webster boasted in the Senate,\r\nthat he had never introduced the subject of slavery to that body, and\r\nnever would. Mr. Clay, in 1839, makes a speech for the Presidency, in\r\nwhich he says, that to discuss the subject of slavery is moral treason,\r\nand that no man has a right to introduce the subject into Congress.\r\nMr. Benton, in 1844, laid down his platform, and he not only denies the\r\nright, but asserts that he never has and never will discuss the subject.\r\nYet Mr. Clay, from 1839 down to his death, hardly made a remarkable\r\nspeech of any kind, except on slavery. Mr. Webster, having indulged now\r\nand then in a little easy rhetoric, as at Niblo's and elsewhere, opens\r\nhis mouth in 1840, generously contributing his aid to both sides, and\r\nstops talking about it only when death closes his lips. Mr. Benton's\r\nsix or eight speeches in the United States Senate have all been on the\r\nsubject of slavery in the Southwestern section of the country, and form\r\nthe basis of whatever claim he has to the character of a statesman, and\r\nhe owes his seat in the next Congress somewhat, perhaps, to anti-slavery\r\npretentions! The Whig and Democratic parties pledged themselves just as\r\nemphatically against the antislavery discussion,--against agitation and\r\nfree speech. These men said: \"It sha'n't be talked about; it won't be\r\ntalked about!\" These are your statesmen!--men who understand the present\r\nthat is, and mould the future! The man who understands his own time, and\r\nwhose genius moulds the future to his views, he is a statesman, is he\r\nnot? These men devoted themselves to banks, to the tariff, to internal\r\nimprovements, to constitutional and financial questions. They said to\r\nslavery: \"Back! no entrance here! We pledge ourselves against you.\"\r\nAnd then there came up a little printer-boy, who whipped them into\r\nthe traces, and made them talk, like Hotspur's starling, nothing\r\nBUT slavery. He scattered all these gigantic shadows,--tariff, bank,\r\nconstitutional questions, financial questions; and slavery, like\r\nthe colossal head in Walpole's romance, came up and filled the whole\r\npolitical horizon! Yet you must remember he is not a statesman! he is\r\na \"fanatic.\" He has no discipline,--Mr. \"Ion\" says so; he does not\r\nunderstand the \"discipline that is essential to victory\"! This man did\r\nnot understand his own time, he did not know what the future was to\r\nbe,--he was not able to shape it--he had no \"prudence,\"--he had no\r\n\"foresight\"! Daniel Webster says, \"I have never introduced this subject,\r\nand never will,\"--and dies broken-hearted because he had not been\r\nable to talk enough about it! Benton says, \"I will never speak of\r\nslavery,\"--and lives to break with his party on this issue! Clay says it\r\nis \"moral treason\" to introduce the subject into Congress--and lives to\r\nsee Congress turned into an antislavery debating society, to suit the\r\npurpose of one \"too powerful individual.\" * * * Remember who it was\r\nthat said in 1831: \"I am in earnest--I will not equivocate--I will not\r\nexcuse--I will not retreat a single inch--and I will be heard!\" That\r\nspeaker has lived twenty-two years, and the complaint of twenty-three\r\nmillions of people is, \"Shall we never hear of any thing but slavery?\"\r\n* * * \"Well, it is all HIS fault\" [pointing to Mr. Garrison]. * * * It\r\nseems to me that such men may point to the present aspect of the nation,\r\nto their originally avowed purpose, to the pledges and efforts of all\r\nyour great men against them, and then let you determine to which side\r\nthe credit of sagacity and statesmanship belongs. Napoleon busied\r\nhimself at St. Helena in showing how Wellington ought to have conquered\r\nat Waterloo. The world has never got time to listen to the explanation.\r\nSufficient for it that the allies entered Paris.\r\n\r\nIt may sound strange to some, this claim for Mr. Garrison of a profound\r\nstatesmanship. \"Men have heard him styled a mere fanatic so long\r\nthat they are incompetent to judge him fairly.\" \"The phrases men are\r\naccustomed,\" says Goethe, \"to repeat incessantly, end by becoming\r\nconvictions, and ossify the organs of intelligence.\" I cannot accept\r\nyou, therefore, as my jury. I appeal from Festus to Csar, from the\r\nprejudice of our streets to the common-sense of the world, and to your\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nEvery thoughtful and unprejudiced mind must see that such an evil as\r\nslavery will yield only to the most radical treatment. If you consider\r\nthe work we have to do, you will not think us needlessly aggressive,\r\nor that we dig down unnecessarily deep in laying the foundations of our\r\nenterprise. A money power of two thousand millions of dollars, as the\r\nprices of slaves now range, held by a small body of able and desperate\r\nmen; that body raised into a political aristocracy by special\r\nconstitutional provisions; cotton, the product of slave labor, forming\r\nthe basis of our whole foreign commerce, and the commercial class thus\r\nsubsidized; the press bought up, the pulpit reduced to vassalage, the\r\nheart of the common people chilled by a bitter prejudice against the\r\nblack race; our leading men bribed, by ambition, either to silence or\r\nopen hostility;--in such a land, on what shall an Abolitionist rely?\r\nOn a few cold prayers, mere lip-service, and never from the heart? On\r\na church resolution, hidden often in its records, and meant only as a\r\ndecent cover for servility in daily practice? On political parties, with\r\ntheir superficial influence at best, and seeking ordinarily only to use\r\nexisting prejudices to the best advantage? Slavery has deeper root here\r\nthan any aristocratic institution has in Europe; and politics is but the\r\ncommon pulse-beat, of which revolution is the fever-spasm. Yet we have\r\nseen European aristocracy survive storms which seemed to reach down\r\nto the primal strata of European life. Shall we, then, trust to mere\r\npolitics, where even revolution has failed? How shall the stream rise\r\nabove its fountain? Where shall our church organizations or parties\r\nget strength to attack their great parent and moulder, the slave power?\r\nShall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me\r\nthus? The old jest of one who tried to lift himself in his own basket,\r\nis but a tame picture of the man who imagines that, by working solely\r\nthrough existing sects and parties, he can destroy slavery. Mechanics\r\nsay nothing, but an earthquake strong enough to move all Egypt can bring\r\ndown the pyramids.\r\n\r\nExperience has confirmed these views. The Abolitionists who have acted\r\non them have a \"short method\" with all unbelievers. They have but to\r\npoint to their own success, in contrast with every other man's failure.\r\nTo waken the nation to its real state, and chain it to the consideration\r\nof this one duty, is half the work. So much we have done. Slavery has\r\nbeen made the question of this generation. To startle the South to\r\nmadness, so that every step she takes, in her blindness, is one step\r\nmore toward ruin, is much. This we have done. Witness Texas and the\r\nFugitive Slave Law.\r\n\r\nTo have elaborated for the nation the only plan of redemption, pointed\r\nout the only exodus from this \"sea of troubles,\" is much. This we claim\r\nto have done in our motto of IMMEDIATE, UNCONDITIONAL, EMANCIPATION ON\r\nTHE SOIL. The closer any statesmanlike mind looks into the question,\r\nthe more favor our plan finds with it. The Christian asks fairly of\r\nthe infidel, \"If this religion be not from God, how do you explain its\r\ntriumph, and the history of the first three centuries?\" Our question\r\nis similar. If our agitation has not been wisely planned and conducted,\r\nexplain for us the history of the last twenty years! Experience is a\r\nsafe light to walk by, and he is not a rash man who expects success in\r\nfuture from the same means which have secured it in times past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN 1811, DIED 1874.)\r\n\r\nON THE REPEAL OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW--\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AUGUST 26, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, 26TH AUGUST, 1852.--The Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation\r\nBill being under consideration, the following amendment was moved by Mr.\r\nHunter, of Virginia, on the recommendation of the Committee on Finance:\r\n\r\n\"That, where the ministerial officers of the United States have or shall\r\nincur extraordinary expense in executing the laws thereof, the payment\r\nof which is not specifically provided for, the President of the United\r\nStates is authorized to allow the payment thereof, under the special\r\ntaxation of the District or Circuit Court of the District in which\r\nthe said services have been or shall be rendered, to be paid from the\r\nappropriation for defraying the expenses of the Judiciary.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner seized the opportunity for which he had been waiting, and at\r\nonce moved the following amendment to the amendment:\r\n\r\n\"Provided, That no such allowance shall be authorized for any expenses\r\nincurred in executing the Act of September 18, 1850, for the surrender\r\nof fugitives from service or labor; which said Act is hereby repealed.\"\r\n\r\nOn this he took the floor, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,\r\n\r\nHere is a provision for extraordinary expense incurred in executing the\r\nlaws of the United States. Extraordinary expenses! Sir, beneath these\r\nspecious words lurks the very subject on which, by a solemn vote of this\r\nbody, I was refused a hearing. Here it is; no longer open to the\r\ncharge of being an \"abstraction,\" but actually presented for practical\r\nlegislation; not introduced by me, but by the Senator from Virginia (Mr.\r\nHunter), on the recommendation of an important committee of the Senate;\r\nnot brought forward weeks ago, when there was ample time for discussion,\r\nbut only at this moment, without any reference to the late period of\r\nthe session. The amendment which I offer proposes to remove one chief\r\noccasion of these extraordinary expenses. Beyond all controversy or\r\ncavil it is strictly in order. And now, at last, among these final,\r\ncrowded days of our duties here, but at this earliest opportunity, I\r\nam to be heard,--not as a favor, but as a right. The graceful usages\r\nof this body may be abandoned, but the established privileges of\r\ndebate cannot be abridged. Parliamentary courtesy may be forgotten,\r\nbut parliamentary law must prevail. The subject is broadly before the\r\nSenate. By the blessing of God it shall be discussed.\r\n\r\nSir, a severe lawgiver of early Greece vainly sought to secure\r\npermanence for his imperfect institutions by providing that the citizen\r\nwho at any time attempted their repeal or alteration should appear in\r\nthe public assembly with a halter about his neck, ready to be drawn,\r\nif his proposition failed. A tyrannical spirit among us, in unconscious\r\nimitation of this antique and discarded barbarism, seeks to surround an\r\noffensive institution with similar safeguard.\r\n\r\nIn the existing distemper of the public mind, and at this present\r\njuncture, no man can enter upon the service which I now undertake,\r\nwith-out personal responsibility, such as can be sustained only by\r\nthat sense of duty which, under God, is always our best support. That\r\npersonal responsibility I accept. Before the Senate and the country let\r\nme be held accountable for this act and for every word which I utter.\r\n\r\nWith me, Sir, there is no alternative. Painfully convinced of the\r\nunutterable wrong and woe of Slavery,--profoundly believing, that,\r\naccording to the true spirit of the Constitution and the sentiments of\r\nthe Fathers, it can find no place under our National Government,--that\r\nit is in every respect sectional, and in no respect national,--that it\r\nis always and everywhere creature and dependent of the States, and never\r\nanywhere creature or dependent of the Nation,--and that the Nation can\r\nnever, by legislative or other act, impart to it any support, under the\r\nConstitution of the United States,--with these convictions I could\r\nnot allow this session to reach its close without making or seizing an\r\nopportunity to declare myself openly against the usurpation, injustice,\r\nand cruelty of the late intolerable enactment for the recovery of\r\nfugitive slaves. Full well I know, Sir, the difficulties of this\r\ndiscussion, arising from prejudices of opinion and from adverse\r\nconclusions strong and sincere as my own. Full well I know that I am\r\nin a small minority, with few here to whom I can look for sympathy or\r\nsupport. Full well I know that I must utter things unwelcome to many\r\nin this body, which I cannot do without pain. Full well I know that the\r\ninstitution of Slavery in our country, which I now proceed to consider,\r\nis as sensitive as it is powerful, possessing a power to shake the whole\r\nland, with a sensitiveness that shrinks and trembles at the touch. But\r\nwhile these things may properly prompt me to caution and reserve, they\r\ncannot change my duty, or my determination to perform it. For this I\r\nwillingly forget myself and all personal consequences. The favor and\r\ngood-will of my fellow-citizens, of my brethren of the Senate,\r\nSir, grateful to me as they justly are, I am ready, if required, to\r\nsacrifice. Whatever I am or may be I freely offer to this cause.\r\n\r\nHere allow, for one moment, a reference to myself and my position. Sir,\r\nI have never been a politician. The slave of principles, I call no party\r\nmaster. By sentiment, education, and conviction a friend of Human Rights\r\nin their utmost expansion, I have ever most sincerely embraced the\r\nDemocratic Idea,--not, indeed, as represented or professed by any\r\nparty, but according to its real significance, as transfigured in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and in the injunctions of Christianity. In\r\nthis idea I see no narrow advantage merely for individuals or classes,\r\nbut the sovereignty of the people, and the greatest happiness of all\r\nsecured by equal laws. Amidst the vicissitudes of public affairs I shall\r\nhold fast always to this idea, and to any political party which truly\r\nembraces it.\r\n\r\nParty does not constrain me; nor is my independence lessened by any\r\nrelations to the office which gives me a title to be heard on this\r\nfloor. Here, Sir, I speak proudly. By no effort, by no desire of my own,\r\nI find myself a Senator of the United States. Never before have I held\r\npublic office of any kind. With the ample opportunities of private life\r\nI was content. No tombstone for me could bear a fairer inscription than\r\nthis: \"Here lies one who, without the honors or emoluments of public\r\nstation, did something for his fellowmen.\" From such simple aspirations\r\nI was taken away by the free choice of my native Commonwealth, and\r\nplaced at this responsible post of duty, without personal obligation of\r\nany kind, beyond what was implied in my life and published words. The\r\nearnest friends by whose confidence I was first designated asked nothing\r\nfrom me, and throughout the long conflict which ended in my election\r\nrejoiced in the position which I most carefully guarded. To all my\r\nlanguage was uniform: that I did not desire to be brought forward;\r\nthat I would do nothing to promote the result; that I had no pledges or\r\npromises to offer; that the office should seek me, and not I the office;\r\nand that it should find me in all respects an independent man, bound to\r\nno party and to no human being, but only, according to my best judgment,\r\nto act for the good of all. Again, Sir, I speak with pride, both for\r\nmyself and others, when I add that these avowals found a sympathizing\r\nresponse. In this spirit I have come here, and in this spirit I shall\r\nspeak to-day.\r\n\r\nRejoicing in my independence, and claiming nothing from party ties, I\r\nthrow myself upon the candor and magnanimity of the Senate. I ask your\r\nattention; I trust not to abuse it. I may speak strongly, for I shall\r\nspeak openly and from the strength of my convictions. I may speak warmly,\r\nfor I shall speak from the heart. But in no event can I forget the\r\namenities which belong to debate, and which especially become this body.\r\nSlavery I must condemn with my whole soul; but here I need only borrow\r\nthe language of slaveholders; nor would it accord with my habits or\r\nmy sense of justice to exhibit them as the impersonation of the\r\ninstitution--Jefferson calls it the \"enormity\"--which they cherish.\r\nOf them I do not speak; but without fear and without favor, as without\r\nimpeachment of any person, I assail this wrong. Again, Sir, I may err;\r\nbut it will be with the Fathers. I plant myself on the ancient ways of\r\nthe Republic, with its grandest names, its surest landmarks, and all its\r\noriginal altar-fires about me.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on the very threshold, I encounter the objection, that there\r\nis a final settlement, in principle and substance, of the question of\r\nslavery, and that all discussion of it is closed. Both the old political\r\nparties, by formal resolutions, in recent conventions at Baltimore, have\r\nunited in this declaration. On a subject which for years has agitated\r\nthe public mind, which yet palpitates in every heart and burns on every\r\ntongue, which in its immeasurable importance dwarfs all other subjects,\r\nwhich by its constant and gigantic presence throws a shadow across\r\nthese halls, which at this very time calls for appropriations to meet\r\nextraordinary expenses it has caused, they impose the rule of silence.\r\nAccording to them, Sir, we may speak of everything except that alone\r\nwhich is most present in all our minds.\r\n\r\nTo this combined effort I might fitly reply, that, with flagrant\r\ninconsistency, it challenges the very discussion it pretends to forbid.\r\nTheir very declaration, on the eve of an election, is, of course,\r\nsubmitted to the consideration and ratification of the people. Debate,\r\ninquiry, discussion, are the necessary consequence. Silence becomes\r\nimpossible. Slavery, which you profess to banish from public attention,\r\nopenly by your invitation enters every political meeting and every\r\npolitical convention. Nay, at this moment it stalks into this Senate,\r\ncrying, like the daughters of the horseleech, \"Give! give.\"\r\n\r\nBut no unanimity of politicians can uphold the baseless assumption, that\r\na law, or any conglomerate of laws, under the name of compromise, or\r\nhowsoever called, is final. Nothing can be plainer than this,--that by\r\nno parliamentary device or knot can any legislature tie the hands of\r\na succeeding legislature, so as to prevent the full exercise of its\r\nconstitutional powers. Each legislature, under a just sense of its\r\nresponsibility, must judge for itself; and if it think proper, it may\r\nrevise, or amend, or absolutely undo the work of any predecessor.\r\nThe laws of the Medes and Persians are said proverbially to have been\r\nunalterable; but they stand forth in history as a single example where\r\nthe true principles of all law have been so irrationally defied.\r\n\r\nTo make a law final, so as not to be reached by Congress, is, by mere\r\nlegislation, to fasten a new provision on the Constitution. Nay, more;\r\nit gives to the law a character which the very Constitution does not\r\npossess. The wise Fathers did not treat the country as a Chinese foot,\r\nnever to grow after infancy; but, anticipating progress, they\r\ndeclared expressly that their great Act is not final. According to the\r\nConstitution itself, there is not one of its existing provisions--not\r\neven that with regard to fugitives from labor--which may not at all\r\ntimes be reached by amendment, and thus be drawn into debate. This\r\nis rational and just. Sir, nothing from man's hands, nor law, nor\r\nconstitution, can be final. Truth alone is final.\r\n\r\nInconsistent and absurd, this effort is tyrannical also. The\r\nresponsibility for the recent Slave Act, and for slavery everywhere\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of Congress, necessarily involves the right to\r\ndiscuss them. To separate these is impossible. Like the twenty-fifth\r\nrule of the House of Representatives against petitions on Slavery,--now\r\nrepealed and dishonored,--the Compromise, as explained and urged, is a\r\ncurtailment of the actual powers of legislation, and a perpetual\r\ndenial of the indisputable principle, that the right to deliberate is\r\ncoextensive with the responsibility for an act. To sustain Slavery it\r\nis now proposed to trample on free speech. In any country this would be\r\ngrievous; but here, where the Constitution expressly provides against\r\nabridging freedom of speech, it is a special outrage. In vain do we\r\ncondemn the despotisms of Europe, while we borrow the rigors with which\r\nthey repress Liberty, and guard their own uncertain power. For myself,\r\nin no factious spirit, but solemnly and in loyalty to the Constitution,\r\nas a Senator of the United States, representing a free Commonwealth, I\r\nprotest against this wrong.\r\n\r\nOn Slavery, as on every other subject, I claim the right to be heard.\r\nThat right I cannot, I will not abandon. \"Give me the liberty to\r\nknow, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above\r\nall liberties\"; these are glowing words, flashed from the soul of John\r\nMilton in his struggles with English tyranny. With equal fervor they\r\ncould be echoed now by every American not already a slave.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, this effort is impotent as tyrannical. Convictions of the\r\nheart cannot be repressed. Utterances of conscience must be heard. They\r\nbreak forth with irrepressible might. As well attempt to check the tides\r\nof ocean, the currents of the Mississippi, or the rushing waters of\r\nNiagara. The discussion of Slavery will proceed, wherever two or three\r\nare gathered together,--by the fireside, on the highway, at the public\r\nmeeting, in the church. The movement against Slavery is from the\r\nEverlasting Arm. Even now it is gathering its forces, soon to be\r\nconfessed everywhere. It may not be felt yet in the high places of\r\noffice and power, but all who can put their ears humbly to the ground\r\nwill hear and comprehend its incessant and advancing tread.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the National Government to Slavery, though plain and\r\nobvious, are constantly misunderstood. A popular belief at this moment\r\nmakes Slavery a national institution, and of course renders its support\r\na national duty. The extravagance of this error can hardly be surpassed.\r\nAn institution which our fathers most carefully omitted to name in the\r\nConstitution, which, according to the debates in the Convention,\r\nthey refused to cover with any \"sanction,\" and which, at the original\r\norganization of the Government, was merely sectional, existing nowhere\r\non the national territory, is now, above all other things, blazoned as\r\nnational. Its supporters pride themselves as national. The old political\r\nparties, while upholding it, claim to be national. A National Whig\r\nis simply a Slavery Whig, and a National Democrat is simply a Slavery\r\nDemocrat, in contradistinction to all who regard Slavery as a sectional\r\ninstitution, within the exclusive control of the States and with which\r\nthe nation has nothing to do.\r\n\r\nAs Slavery assumes to be national, so, by an equally strange perversion,\r\nFreedom is degraded to be sectional, and all who uphold it, under the\r\nNational Constitution, are made to share this same epithet. Honest\r\nefforts to secure its blessings everywhere within the jurisdiction of\r\nCongress are scouted as sectional; and this cause, which the founders\r\nof our National Government had so much at heart, is called Sectionalism.\r\nThese terms, now belonging to the common places of political speech, are\r\nadopted and misapplied by most persons without reflection. But here is\r\nthe power of Slavery. According to a curious tradition of the French\r\nlanguage, Louis XIV., the Grand Monarch, by an accidental error of\r\nspeech, among supple courtiers, changed the gender of a noun. But\r\nslavery does more. It changes word for word. It teaches men to say\r\nnational instead of sectional, and sectional instead of national.\r\n\r\nSlavery national! Sir, this is a mistake and absurdity, fit to have a\r\nplace in some new collection of Vulgar Errors, by some other Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne, with the ancient, but exploded stories, that the toad has a\r\ngem in its head, and that ostriches digest iron. According to the true\r\nspirit of the Constitution, and the sentiments of the Fathers, Slavery,\r\nand not Freedom, is sectional, while Freedom, and not Slavery, is\r\nnational. On this unanswerable proposition I take my stand, and here\r\ncommences my argument.\r\n\r\nThe subject presents itself under two principal heads: _First, the true\r\nrelations of the National Government to Slavery_, wherein it will appear\r\nthat there is no national fountain from which Slavery can be derived,\r\nand no national power, under the Constitution, by which it can be\r\nsupported. Enlightened by this general survey, we shall be prepared to\r\nconsider, _secondly, the true nature of the provision for the rendition\r\nof fugitives from service_, and herein especially the unconstitutional\r\nand offensive legislation of Congress in pursuance thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAnd now for THE TRUE RELATIONS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO SLAVERY.\r\nThese are readily apparent, if we do not neglect well-established\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIf slavery be national, if there be any power in the National Government\r\nto withhold this institution,--as in the recent Slave Act,--it must\r\nbe by virtue of the Constitution. Nor can it be by mere inference,\r\nimplication, or conjecture. According to the uniform admission of courts\r\nand jurists in Europe, again and again promulgated in our country,\r\nslavery can be derived only from clear and special recognition. \"The\r\nstate of Slavery,\" said Lord Mansfield, pronouncing judgment in the\r\ngreat case of Sommersett, \"is of such a nature that it is incapable\r\nof being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by\r\npositive law.... _It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to\r\nsupport it but positive law_.\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOf course every power to uphold slavery must have an origin as distinct\r\nas that of Slavery itself. Every presumption must be as strong against\r\nsuch a power as against slavery. A power so peculiar and offensive,\r\nso hostile to reason, so repugnant to the law of Nature and the inborn\r\nrights of man,--which despoils its victim of the fruits of labor,--which\r\nsubstitutes concubinage for marriage,--which abrogates the relation of\r\nparent and child,--which, by denial of education, abases the intellect,\r\nprevents a true knowledge of God, and murders the very soul,--which,\r\namidst a plausible physical comfort, degrades man, created in the\r\ndivine image, to the state of a beast,--such a power, so eminent, so\r\ntranscendent, so tyrannical, so unjust, can find no place in any system\r\nof government, unless by virtue of positive sanction. It can spring from\r\nno doubtful phrase. It must be declared by unambiguous words, incapable\r\nof a double sense.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSir, such, briefly, are the rules of interpretation, which, as applied\r\nto the Constitution, fill it with the breath of freedom,--\r\n\r\n     \"Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt.\"\r\n\r\nTo the history and prevailing sentiments of the times we may turn for\r\nfurther assurance. In the spirit of freedom the Constitution was formed.\r\nIn this spirit our fathers always spoke and acted. In this spirit the\r\nNational Government was first organized under Washington. And here I\r\nrecall a scene, in itself a touch-stone of the period, and an example\r\nfor us, upon which we may look with pure national pride, while we learn\r\nanew the relations of the National Government to Slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was accomplished. The feeble Government of the\r\nConfederation passed away. The Constitution, slowly matured in a\r\nNational Convention, discussed before the people, defended by masterly\r\npens, was adopted. The Thirteen States stood forth a Nation, where was\r\nunity without consolidation, and diversity without discord. The hopes of\r\nall were anxiously hanging upon the new order of things and the mighty\r\nprocession of events. With signal unanimity Washington was chosen\r\nPresident. Leaving his home at Mount Vernon, he repaired to New\r\nYork,--where the first Congress had commenced its session,--to assume\r\nhis place as Chief of the Republic. On the 30th of April, 1789, the\r\norganization of the Government was completed by his inauguration.\r\nEntering the Senate Chamber, where the two Houses were assembled, he was\r\ninformed that they awaited his readiness to receive the oath of office.\r\nWithout delay, attended by the Senators and Representatives, with\r\nfriends and men of mark gathered about him, he moved to the balcony in\r\nfront of the edifice. A countless multitude, thronging the open ways,\r\nand eagerly watching this great espousal,\r\n\r\n     \"With reverence look on his majestic face,\r\n     Proud to be less, but of his godlike race.\"\r\n\r\nThe oath was administered by the Chancellor of New York. At such time,\r\nand in such presence, beneath the unveiled heavens, Washington first\r\ntook this vow upon his lips: \"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully\r\nexecute the office of President of the United States, and will, to the\r\nbest of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nOver the President, on this new occasion, floated the national flag,\r\nwith its stripes of red and white, its stars on a field of blue. As\r\nhis patriot eye rested upon the glowing ensign, what currents must have\r\nrushed swiftly through his soul. In the early days of the Revolution, in\r\nthose darkest hours about Boston, after the Battle of Bunker Hill, and\r\nbefore the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen stripes had been\r\nfirst unfurled by him, as the emblem of Union among the Colonies for\r\nthe sake of Freedom. By him, at that time, they had been named the Union\r\nFlag. Trial, struggle, and war were now ended, and the Union, which they\r\nfirst heralded, was unalterably established. To every beholder these\r\nmemories, must have been full of pride and consolation. But, looking\r\nback upon the scene, there is one circumstance which, more than all its\r\nother associations, fills the soul,--more even than the suggestions of\r\nUnion, which I prize so much. AT THIS MOMENT, WHEN WASHINGTON TOOK\r\nHIS FIRST OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, THE\r\nNATIONAL ENSIGN, NOWHERE WITHIN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY, COVERED A SINGLE\r\nSLAVE. Then, indeed, was Slavery Sectional, and Freedom National.\r\n\r\nOn the sea an execrable piracy, the trade in slaves, to the national\r\nscandal, was still tolerated under the national flag. In the States,\r\nas a sectional institution, beneath the shelter of local laws, Slavery\r\nunhappily found a home. But in the only terrritories at this time\r\nbelonging to the nation, the broad region of the Northwest, it was\r\nalready made impossible, by the Ordinance of Freedom, even before the\r\nadoption of the Constitution. The District of Columbia, with its Fatal\r\nDowry, was not yet acquired.\r\n\r\nThe government thus organized was Anti-slavery in character. Washington\r\nwas a slave-holder, but it would be unjust to his memory not to say that\r\nhe was an Abolitionist also. His opinions do not admit of question.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBy the side of Washington, as, standing beneath the national flag, he\r\nswore to support the Constitution, were illustrious men, whose lives\r\nand recorded words now rise in judgment. There was John Adams, the\r\nVice-President, great vindicator and final negotiator of our national\r\nindependence, whose soul, flaming with Freedom, broke forth in the early\r\ndeclaration, that \"consenting to Slavery is a sacrilegious breach of\r\ntrust,\" and whose immitigable hostility to this wrong is immortal in his\r\ndescendants. There was also a companion in arms and attached friend,\r\nof beautiful genius, the yet youthful and \"incomparable\" Hamilton,--fit\r\ncompanion in early glories and fame with that darling of English\r\nhistory, Sir Philip Sidney, to whom the latter epithet has been\r\nreserved,--who, as member of the Abolition Society of New York, had\r\nrecently united in a solemn petition for those who, though \"free by the\r\nlaws of God; are held in Slavery by the laws of this State.\" There, too,\r\nwas a noble spirit, of spotless virtue, the ornament of human nature,\r\nwho, like the sun, ever held an unerring course,--John Jay. Filling the\r\nimportant post of Secretary for Foreign Affairs under the Confederation,\r\nhe found time to organize the \"Society for Promoting the Manumission\r\nof Slaves\" in New York, and to act as its President, until, by the\r\nnomination of Washington, he became Chief Justice of the United States.\r\nIn his sight Slavery was an \"iniquity,\" \"a sin of crimson dye,\" against\r\nwhich ministers of the Gospel should testify, and which the Government\r\nshould seek in every way to abolish. \"Till America comes into this\r\nmeasure,\" he wrote, \"her prayers to Heaven for liberty will be impious.\r\nThis is a strong expression, but it is just. Were I in your legislature,\r\nI would prepare a bill for the purpose with great care, and I would\r\nnever cease moving it till it became a law or I ceased to be a member.\"\r\nSuch words as these, fitly coming from our leaders, belong to the true\r\nglories of the country:\r\n\r\n    \"While we such precedents can boast at home,\r\n     Keep thy Fabricius and thy Cato, Rome!\"\r\n\r\nThey stood not alone. The convictions and earnest aspirations of the\r\ncountry were with them. At the North these were broad and general. At\r\nthe South they found fervid utterance from slaveholders. By early\r\nand precocious efforts for \"total emancipation,\" the author of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence placed himself foremost among the\r\nAbolitionists of the land. In language now familiar to all, and\r\nwhich can never die, he perpetually denounced Slavery. He exposed its\r\npernicious influence upon master as well as slave, declared that the\r\nlove of justice and the love of country pleaded equally for the slave,\r\nand that \"the abolition of domestic slavery was the greatest object of\r\ndesire.\" He believed that \"the sacred side was gaining daily recruits,\"\r\nand confidently looked to the young for the accomplishment of this\r\ngood work. In fitful sympathy with Jefferson was another honored son of\r\nVirginia, the Orator of Liberty, Patrick Henry, who, while confessing\r\nthat he was a master of slaves, said: \"I will not, I cannot justify it.\r\nHowever culpable my conduct, I will so far pay my devoir to virtue as to\r\nown the excellence and rectitude of her precepts, and lament my want\r\nof conformity to them.\" At this very period, in the Legislature of\r\nMaryland, on a bill for the relief of oppressed slaves, a young man,\r\nafterwards by consummate learning and forensic powers acknowledged head\r\nof the American bar, William Pinkney, in a speech of earnest,\r\ntruthful eloquence,--better for his memory than even his professional\r\nfame,--branded Slavery as \"iniquitous and most dishonorable,\" \"founded\r\nin a disgraceful traffic,\" \"its continuance as shameful as its origin,\"\r\nand he openly declared, that \"by the eternal principles of natural\r\njustice, no master in the State has a right to hold his slave in bondage\r\nfor a single hour.\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repetition, but for the sake of clearness, review now\r\nthis argument, and gather it together. Considering that Slavery is of\r\nsuch an offensive character that it can find sanction only in\r\n\"positive law,\" and that it has no such \"positive\" sanction in the\r\nConstitution,--that the Constitution, according to its preamble,\r\nwas ordained to \"establish justice\" and \"secure the blessings of\r\nliberty,\"--that, in the Convention which framed it, and also elsewhere\r\nat the time, it was declared not to sanction slavery,--that, according\r\nto the Declaration of Independence, and the Address of the Continental\r\nCongress, the nation was dedicated to \"liberty,\" and the \"rights of\r\nhuman nature,\"--that, according to the principles of the common law, the\r\nConstitution must be interpreted openly, actively, and perpetually for\r\nfreedom,--that, according to the decision of the Supreme Court, it acts\r\nupon slaves, _not as property_, but as PERSONS,--that, at the first\r\norganization of the national Government under Washington, Slavery had no\r\nnational favor, existed nowhere on the national territory, beneath the\r\nnational flag, but was openly condemned by Nation, Church, Colleges, and\r\nLiterature of the time,--and, finally, that, according to an amendment\r\nof the Constitution, the National Government can exercise only powers\r\ndelegated to it, among which is none to support Slavery,--considering\r\nthese things, Sir, it is impossible to avoid the single conclusion,\r\nthat Slavery is in no respect a national institution, and that the\r\nConstitution nowhere upholds property in man.\r\n\r\nThere is one other special provision of the Constitution, which I have\r\nreserved to this stage, not so much from its superior importance, but\r\nbecause it fitly stands by itself. This alone, if practically applied,\r\nwould carry Freedom to all within its influence. It is an amendment\r\nproposed by the First Congress, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"No _person_ shall be deprived of life, _liberty_, or property,\r\n     _without due process of law_.\"\r\n\r\nUnder this great aegis the liberty of every person within the national\r\njurisdiction is unequivocally placed. I say every person. Of this there\r\ncan be no question. The word \"person\" in the Constitution embraces every\r\nhuman being within its sphere, whether Caucasian, Indian, or African,\r\nfrom the president to the slave. Show me a person within the national\r\njurisdiction, and I confidently claim for him this protection, no matter\r\nwhat his condition or race or color. The natural meaning of the clause\r\nis clear, but a single fact of its history places it in the broad light\r\nof noon. As originally recommended by Virginia, North Carolina, and\r\nRhode Island, it was restricted to the freeman. Its language was, \"No\r\nfreeman ought to be deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by\r\nthe law of the land.\" In rejecting this limitation, the authors of the\r\namendment revealed their purpose, that no person, under the National\r\nGovernment, of whatever character, should be deprived of liberty without\r\ndue process of law,--that is, without due presentment, indictment, or\r\nother judicial proceeding. But this amendment is nothing less than an\r\nexpress guaranty of Personal Liberty, and an express prohibition of its\r\ninvasion anywhere, at least within the national jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSir, apply these principles, and Slavery will again be as when\r\nWashington took his first oath as President. The Union Flag of the\r\nRepublic will become once more the flag of Freedom, and at all points\r\nwithin the national jurisdiction will refuse to cover a slave. Beneath\r\nits beneficent folds, wherever it is carried, on land or sea, slavery\r\nwill disappear, like darkness under the arrows of the ascending\r\nsun,--like the Spirit of Evil before the Angel of the Lord.\r\n\r\nIn all national territories Slavery will be impossible.\r\n\r\nOn the high seas, under the national flag, Slavery will be impossible.\r\n\r\nIn the District of Columbia Slavery will instantly cease.\r\n\r\nInspired by these principles, Congress can give no sanction to Slavery\r\nby the admission of new slave States.\r\n\r\nNowhere under the Constitution can the Nation, by legislation or\r\notherwise, support Slavery, hunt slaves, or hold property in man.\r\n\r\nSuch, sir, are my sincere convictions. According to the Constitution,\r\nas I understand it, in the light of the past and of its true principles,\r\nthere is no other conclusion which is rational or tenable, which\r\ndoes not defy authoritative rules of interpretation, does not falsify\r\nindisputable facts of history, does not affront the public opinion in\r\nwhich it had its birth, and does not dishonor the memory of the fathers.\r\nAnd yet politicians of the hour undertake to place these convictions\r\nunder formal ban. The generous sentiments which filled the early\r\npatriots, and impressed upon the government they founded, as upon the\r\ncoin they circulated, the image and superscription of LIBERTY, have lost\r\ntheir power. The slave-masters, few in number, amounting to not more\r\nthan three hundred and fifty thousand, according to the recent census,\r\nhave succeeded in dictating the policy of the National Government, and\r\nhave written SLAVERY on its front. The change, which began in the desire\r\nfor wealth, was aggravated by the desire for political predominance.\r\nThrough Slavery the cotton crop increased with its enriching gains;\r\nthrough Slavery States became part of the slave power. And now an\r\narrogant and unrelenting ostracism is applied, not only to all who\r\nexpress themselves against Slavery, but to every man unwilling to be its\r\nmenial. A novel test for office is introduced, which would have excluded\r\nall the fathers of the Republic,--even Washington, Jefferson, and\r\nFranklin!\r\n\r\nYes, Sir! Startling it may be, but indisputable. Could these revered\r\ndemigods of history once again descend upon earth and mingle in our\r\naffairs, not one of them could receive a nomination from the National\r\nConvention of either of the two old political parties! Out of the\r\nconvictions of their hearts and the utterances of their lips against\r\nSlavery they would be condemned.\r\n\r\nThis single fact reveals the extent to which the National Government has\r\ndeparted from its true course and its great examples. For myself, I know\r\nno better aim under the Constitution than to bring the Government back\r\nto the precise position on this question it occupied on the auspicious\r\nmorning of its first organization by Washington,\r\n\r\n     \"Nunc retrorsum\r\n     Vela dare, atque iterare cursus\r\n     . . . . . . relictos,\"\r\n\r\nthat the sentiments of the Fathers may again prevail with our rulers,\r\nand the National Flag may nowhere shelter Slavery.\r\n\r\nTo such as count this aspiration unreasonable let me commend a renowned\r\nand life-giving precedent of English history. As early as the days of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, a courtier boasted that the air of England was too pure\r\nfor a slave to breathe, and the Common Law was said to forbid Slavery.\r\nAnd yet, in the face of this vaunt, kindred to that of our fathers, and\r\nso truly honorable, slaves were introduced from the West Indies.\r\nThe custom of Slavery gradually prevailed. Its positive legality was\r\naffirmed, in professional opinions, by two eminent lawyers, Talbot and\r\nYorke, each afterwards Lord Chancellor. It was also affirmed on the\r\nbench by the latter as Lord Hardwicke. England was already a Slave\r\nState. The following advertisement, copied from a London newspaper, _The\r\nPublic Advertiser_, of November 22, 1769, shows that the journals there\r\nwere disfigured as some of ours, even in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\"To be sold, a black girl, the property of J. B., eleven years of\r\nage, who is extremely handy, works at her needle tolerably, and\r\nspeaks English perfectly well; is of an excellent temper and willing\r\ndisposition. Inquire of her owner at the Angel Inn, behind St. Clement's\r\nChurch, in the Strand.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1772, only three years after this advertisement, the single\r\nquestion of the legality of Slavery was presented to Lord Mansfield, on\r\na writ of _habeas corpus_. A poor negro, named Sommersett, brought to\r\nEngland as a slave, became ill, and, with an inhumanity disgraceful even\r\nto Slavery, was turned adrift upon the world. Through the charity of\r\nan estimable man, the eminent Abolitionist, Granville Sharp, he was\r\nrestored to health, when his unfeeling and avaricious master again\r\nclaimed him as bondman. The claim was repelled. After elaborate and\r\nprotracted discussion in Westminster Hall, marked by rarest learning\r\nand ability, Lord Mansfield, with discreditable reluctance, sullying\r\nhis great judicial name, but in trembling obedience to the genius of the\r\nBritish Constitution, pronounced a decree which made the early boast a\r\npractical verity, and rendered Slavery forever impossible in England.\r\nMore than fourteen thousand persons, at that time held as slaves, and\r\nbreathing English air,--four times as many as are now found in this\r\nnational metropolis,--stepped forth in the happiness and dignity of free\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWith this guiding example I cannot despair. The time will yet come when\r\nthe boast of our fathers will be made a practical verity also, and\r\nCourt or Congress, in the spirit of this British judgment, will proudly\r\ndeclare that nowhere under the Constitution can man hold property in\r\nman. For the Republic such a decree will be the way of peace and safety.\r\nAs Slavery is banished from the national jurisdiction, it will cease\r\nto vex our national politics. It may linger in the States as a local\r\ninstitution; but it will no longer engender national animosities, when\r\nit no longer demands national support.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFrom this general review of the relations of the National Government to\r\nSlavery, I pass to the consideration of THE TRUE NATURE OF THE PROVISION\r\nFOR THE RENDITION OF FUGITIVES FROM SERVICE, embracing an examination of\r\nthis provision in the Constitution, and especially of the recent Act\r\nof Congress in pursuance thereof. As I begin this discussion, let me\r\nbespeak anew your candor. Not in prejudice, but in the light of history\r\nand of reason, we must consider this subject. The way will then be easy\r\nand the conclusion certain.\r\n\r\nMuch error arises from the exaggerated importance now attached to this\r\nprovision, and from assumptions with regard to its origin and primitive\r\ncharacter. It is often asserted that it was suggested by some special\r\ndifficulty, which had become practically and extensively felt, anterior\r\nto the Constitution. But this is one of the myths or fables with which\r\nthe supporters of Slavery have surrounded their false god. In the\r\narticles of Confederation, while provision is made for the surrender of\r\nfugitive criminals, nothing is said of fugitive slaves or servants;\r\nand there is no evidence in any quarter, until after the National\r\nConvention, of hardship or solicitude on this account. No previous voice\r\nwas heard to express desire for any provision on the subject. The story\r\nto the contrary is a modern fiction.\r\n\r\nI put aside, as equally fabulous, the common saying, that this provision\r\nwas one of the original compromises of the Constitution, and an\r\nessential condition of Union. Though sanctioned by eminent judicial\r\nopinions, it will be found that this statement is hastily made, without\r\nany support in the records of the Convention, the only authentic\r\nevidence of the compromises; nor will it be easy to find any authority\r\nfor it in any contemporary document, speech, published letter, or\r\npamphlet of any kind. It is true that there were compromises at the\r\nformation of the Constitution, which were the subject of anxious debate;\r\nbut this was not one of them.\r\n\r\nThere was a compromise between the small and large States, by which\r\nequality was secured to all the States in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere was another compromise finally carried, under threats from the\r\nSouth, on the motion of a New England member, by which the Slave States\r\nare allowed Representatives according to the whole number of free\r\npersons and \"three fifths of all other persons,\" thus securing political\r\npower on account of their slaves, in consideration that direct taxes\r\nshould be apportioned in the same way. Direct taxes have been imposed at\r\nonly four brief intervals. The political power has been constant, and at\r\nthis moment sends twenty-one members to the other House.\r\n\r\nThere was a third compromise, not to be mentioned without shame. It was\r\nthat hateful bargain by which Congress was restrained until 1808 from\r\nthe prohibition of the foreign Slave-trade, thus securing, down to that\r\nperiod, toleration for crime. This was pertinaciously pressed by the\r\nSouth, even to the extent of absolute restriction on Congress. John\r\nRutledge said:\r\n\r\n\"If the Convention thinks that North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia will ever agree to the Plan (the National Constitution), unless\r\ntheir right to import slaves be untouched, the expectation is vain.\r\nThe people of those States will never be such fools as to give up so\r\nimportant an interest.\" Charles Pinckney said: \"South Carolina can never\r\nreceive the Plan, if it prohibits the slave-trade.\" Charles Cotesworth\r\nPinckney \"thought himself bound to declare candidly, that he did not\r\nthink South Carolina would stop her importations of slaves in any short\r\ntime.\" The effrontery of the slave-masters was matched by the sordidness\r\nof the Eastern members, who yielded again. Luther Martin, the eminent\r\nmember of the Convention, in his contemporary address to the Legislature\r\nof Maryland, described the compromise. \"I found,\" he said, \"The Eastern\r\nStates, notwithstanding their aversion to Slavery, were very willing\r\nto indulge the Southern States at least with a temporary liberty to\r\nprosecute the slave-trade, _provided the Southern States would in their\r\nturn gratify them by laying no restriction on navigation acts_.\" The\r\nbargain was struck, and at this price the Southern States gained\r\nthe detestable indulgence. At a subsequent day Congress branded the\r\nslave-trade as piracy, and thus, by solemn legislative act, adjudged\r\nthis compromise to be felonious and wicked.\r\n\r\nSuch are the three chief original compromises of the Constitution and\r\nessential conditions of Union. The case of fugitives from service is not\r\nof these. During the Convention it was not in any way associated with\r\nthese. Nor is there any evidence from the records of this body, that the\r\nprovision on this subject was regarded with any peculiar interest. As\r\nits absence from the Articles of Confederation had not been the occasion\r\nof solicitude or de-sire, anterior to the National Convention, so it\r\ndid not enter into any of the original plans of the Constitution. It was\r\nintroduced tardily, at a late period of the Convention, and adopted with\r\nvery little and most casual discussion. A few facts show how utterly\r\nunfounded are recent assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe National Convention was convoked to meet at Philadelphia on the\r\nsecond Monday in May, 1787. Several members appeared at this time, but,\r\na majority of the States not being represented, those present adjourned\r\nfrom day to day until the 25th, when the Convention was organized by the\r\nchoice of George Washington as President. On the 28th a few brief rules\r\nand orders were adopted. On the next day, they commenced their great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, Edmund Randolph, of slaveholding Virginia, laid before\r\nthe Convention a series of fifteen resolutions, containing his plan for\r\nthe establishment of a New National Government. Here was no allusion to\r\nfugitives slaves.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the same day, Charles Pinckney, of slaveholding South Carolina,\r\nlaid before the Convention what was called \"A Draft of a Federal\r\nGovernment, to be agreed upon between the Free and Independent States\r\nof America,\" an elaborate paper, marked by considerable minuteness\r\nof detail. Here are provisions, borrowed from the Articles of\r\nConfederation, securing to the citizens of each State equal privileges,\r\nin the several States, giving faith to the public records of the States,\r\nand ordaining the surrender of fugitives from justice. But this draft,\r\nthough from the flaming guardian of the slave interest, contained no\r\nallusion to fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Convention other plans were brought forward: on\r\nthe 15th of June, aseries of eleven propositions by Mr. Paterson, of\r\nNew Jersey, \"so as to render the Federal Constitution adequate to the\r\nexigencies of Government and the preservation of the Union\"; on the 18th\r\nJune, eleven propositions by Mr. Hamilton, of New York, \"containing his\r\nideas of a suitable plan of Government for the United States\" and on the\r\n19th June, Mr. Randolph's resolutions, originally offered on the 29th\r\nMay, \"as altered, amended, and agreed to in Committee of the Whole\r\nHouse.\" On the 26th July, twenty-three resolutions, already adopted\r\non different days in the Convention, were referred to a \"Committee of\r\nDetail,\" for reduction to the form of a Constitution. On the 6th August\r\nthis Committee reported the finished draft of a Constitution. And yet\r\nin all these resolutions, plans, and drafts, seven in number, proceeding\r\nfrom eminent members and from able committees, no allusion is made to\r\nfugitive slaves. For three months the Convention was in session, and not\r\na word uttered on this subject.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 28th August, as the Convention was drawing to a close,\r\non the consideration of the article providing for the privileges of\r\ncitizens in different States, we meet the first reference to this\r\nmatter, in words worthy of note. \"General (Charles Cotesworth) Pinckney\r\nwas not satisfied with it. He SEEMED to wish some provision should be\r\nincluded in favor of property in slaves.\" But he made no proposition.\r\nUnwilling to shock the Convention, and uncertain in his own mind, he\r\nonly seemed to wish such a provision. In this vague expression of a\r\nvague desire this idea first appeared. In this modest, hesitating phrase\r\nis the germ of the audacious, unhesitating Slave Act. Here is the little\r\nvapor, which has since swollen, as in the Arabian tale, to the power and\r\ndimensions of a giant. The next article under discussion provided for\r\nthe surrender of fugitives from justice. Mr. Butler and Mr. Charles\r\nPinckney, both from South Carolina, now moved openly to require\r\n\"fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up like criminals.\" Here\r\nwas no disguise. With Hamlet, it was now said in spirit,\r\n\r\n\"Seems, Madam! Nay it is. I know not seems.\"\r\n\r\nBut the very boldness of the effort drew attention and opposition. Mr.\r\nWilson, of Pennsylvania, the learned jurist and excellent man, at once\r\nobjected: \"This would oblige the Executive of the State to do it at the\r\npublic expense.\" Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut, \"saw no more propriety in\r\nthe public seizing and surrendering a slave or servant than a horse.\"\r\nUnder the pressure of these objections, the offensive proposition was\r\nwithdrawn,--never more to be renewed. The article for the surrender of\r\ncriminals was then unanimously adopted. On the next day, 29th\r\nAugust, profiting by the suggestions already made, Mr. Butler moved\r\na proposition,--substantially like that now found in the\r\nConstitution,--for the surrender, not of \"fugitive slaves,\" as\r\noriginally proposed, but simply of \"persons bound to service or labor,\"\r\nwhich, without debate or opposition of any kind, was unanimously\r\nadopted.'\r\n\r\nHere, palpably, was no labor of compromise, no adjustment of conflicting\r\ninterest,--nor even any expression of solicitude. The clause finally\r\nadopted was vague and faint as the original suggestion. In its natural\r\nimport it is not applicable to slaves. If supposed by some to\r\nbe applicable, it is clear that it was supposed by others to be\r\ninapplicable. It is now insisted that the term \"persons bound to\r\nservice,\" or \"held to service,\" as expressed in the final revision, is\r\nthe equivalent or synonym for \"slaves.\" This interpretation is rebuked\r\nby an incident to which reference has been already made, but which will\r\nbear repetition. On the 13th September--a little more than a fortnight\r\nafter the clause was adopted, and when, if deemed to be of any\r\nsignificance, it could not have been forgotten--the very word \"service,\"\r\ncame under debate, and received a fixed meaning. It was unanimously\r\nadopted as a substitute for \"servitude\" in another part of the\r\nConstitution, for the reason that it expressed \"the obligations of free\r\npersons,\" while the other expressed \"the condition of slaves.\" In\r\nthe face of this authentic evidence, reported by Mr. Madison, it is\r\ndifficult to see how the term \"persons held to service\" can be deemed to\r\nexpress anything beyond the \"obligations of free persons.\" Thus, in the\r\nlight of calm inquiry, does this exaggerated clause lose its importance.\r\n\r\nThe provision, showing itself thus tardily, and so slightly regarded in\r\nthe National Convention, was neglected in much of the contemporaneous\r\ndiscussion before the people. In the Conventions of South Carolina,\r\nNorth Carolina,and Virginia, it was commended as securing important\r\nrights, though on this point there was difference of opinion. In the\r\nVirginia Convention, an eminent character, Mr. George Mason, with\r\nothers, expressly declared that there was \"no security of property\r\ncoming within this section.\" In the other Conventions it was\r\ndisregarded. Massachusetts, while exhibiting peculiar sensitiveness at\r\nany responsibility for slavery, seemed to view it with unconcern. One\r\nof her leading statesmen, General Heath, in the debates of the State\r\nConvention, strenuously asserted, that, in ratifying the Constitution,\r\nthe people of Massachusetts \"would do nothing to hold the blacks in\r\nslavery.\" \"_The Federalist_,\" in its classification of the powers of\r\nCongress, describes and groups a large number as \"those which provide\r\nfor the harmony and proper intercourse among the States,\" and\r\ntherein speaks of the power over public records, standing next in the\r\nConstitution to the provision concerning fugitives from service; but it\r\nfails to recognize the latter among the means of promoting \"harmony and\r\nproper intercourse;\" nor does its triumvirate of authors anywhere allude\r\nto the provision.\r\n\r\nThe indifference thus far attending this subject still continued. The\r\nearliest Act of Congress, passed in 1793, drew little attention. It was\r\nnot suggested originally by any difficulty or anxiety touching fugitives\r\nfrom service, nor is there any contemporary record, in debate or\r\notherwise, showing that any special importance was attached to its\r\nprovisions in this regard. The attention of Congress was directed to\r\nfugitives from justice, and, with little deliberation, it undertook, in\r\nthe same bill, to provide for both cases. In this accidental manner was\r\nlegislation on this subject first attempted.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that fugitives were often seized under this Act.\r\nFrom a competent inquirer we learn that twenty-six years elapsed before\r\nit was successfully enforced in any Free State. It is certain, that, in\r\na case at Boston, towards the close of the last century, illustrated\r\nby Josiah Quincy as counsel, the crowd about the magistrate, at the\r\nexamination, quietly and spontaneously opened a way for the fugitive,\r\nand thus the Act failed to be executed. It is also certain, that, in\r\nVermont, at the beginning of the century, a Judge of the Supreme Court\r\nof the State, on application for the surrender of an alleged slave,\r\naccompanied by documentary evidence, gloriously refused compliance,\r\nunless the master could show a Bill of Sale from the Almighty. Even\r\nthese cases passed without public comment.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the subject was introduced in the House of Representatives by\r\nan effort for another Act, which, on consideration, was rejected. At\r\na later day, in 1817-18, though still disregarded by the country, it\r\nseemed to excite a short-lived interest in Congress. In the House of\r\nRepresentatives, on motion of Mr. Pindall, of Virginia, a committee was\r\nappointed to inquire into the expediency of \"providing more effectually\r\nby law for reclaiming servants and slaves escaping from one State into\r\nan-other,\" and a bill reported by them to amend the Act of 1793, after\r\nconsideration for several days in Committee of the Whole, was passed.\r\nIn the Senate, after much attention and warm debate, it passed with\r\namendments. But on return to the House for adoption of the amendments,\r\nit was dropped. This effort, which, in the discussions of this subject,\r\nhas been thus far unnoticed, is chiefly remarkable as the earliest\r\nrecorded evidence of the unwarrantable assertion, now so common, that\r\nthis provision was originally of vital importance to the peace and\r\nharmony of the country.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1850, we have another Act, passed by both Houses of\r\nCongress, and approved by the President, familiarly known as the\r\nFugitive Slave Bill. As I read this statute, I am filled with painful\r\nemotions. The masterly subtlety with which it is drawn might challenge\r\nadmiration, if exerted for a benevolent purpose; but in an age of\r\nsensibility and refinement, a machine of torture, however skilful\r\nand apt, cannot be regarded without horror. Sir, in the name of the\r\nConstitution, which it violates, of my country, which it dishonors,\r\nof Humanity, which it degrades, of Christianity, which it offends, I\r\narraign this enactment, and now hold it up to the judgment of the Senate\r\nand the world. Again, I shrink from no responsibility. I may seem\r\nto stand alone; but all the patriots and martyrs of history, all the\r\nFathers of the Republic, are with me. Sir, there is no attribute of God\r\nwhich does not take part against this Act.\r\n\r\nBut I am to regard it now chiefly as an infringement of the\r\nConstitution. Here its outrages, flagrant as manifold, assume the\r\ndeepest dye and broadest character only when we consider that by its\r\nlanguage it is not restricted to any special race or class, to the\r\nAfrican or to the person with African blood, but that any inhabitant\r\nof the United States, of whatever complexion or condition, may be its\r\nvictim. Without discrimination of color even, and in violation of every\r\npresumption of freedom, the Act surrenders all who may be claimed as\r\n\"owing service or labor\" to the same tyrannical proceeding. If there be\r\nany whose sympathies are not moved for the slave, who do not cherish the\r\nrights of the humble African, struggling for divine Freedom, as warmly\r\nas the rights of the white man, let him consider well that the rights of\r\nall are equally assailed. \"Nephew,\" said Algernon Sidney in prison, on\r\nthe night before his execution, \"I value not my own life a chip; but\r\nwhat concerns me is, that the law which takes away my life may hang\r\nevery one of you, whenever it is thought convenient.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst thus comprehensive in its provisions, and applicable to all,\r\nthere is no safeguard of Human Freedom which the monster Act does not\r\nset at nought.\r\n\r\nIt commits this great question--than which none is more sacred in the\r\nlaw--not to a solemn trial, but to summary proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt commits this great question, not to one of the high tribunals of the\r\nland, but to the unaided judgment of a single petty magistrate.\r\n\r\nIt commits this great question to a magistrate appointed, not by the\r\nPresident with the consent of the Senate, but by the Court,--holding\r\noffice, not during good behavior, but merely during the will of the\r\nCourt,--and receiving, not a regular salary, but fees according to each\r\nindividual case.\r\n\r\nIt authorizes judgment on _ex parte_ evidence, by affidavit, without the\r\nsanction of cross-examination.\r\n\r\nIt denies the writ of _Habeas Corpus_, ever known as the palladium of\r\nthe citizen.\r\n\r\nContrary to the declared purposes of the framers of the Constitution, it\r\nsends the fugitive back \"at the public expense.\"\r\n\r\nAdding meanness to violation of the Constitution, it bribes the\r\nCommissioner by a double stipend to pronounce against Freedom. If he\r\ndooms a man to Slavery, the reward is ten dollars; but saving him to\r\nFreedom, his dole is five.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution expressly secures the \"free exercise of religion\"; but\r\nthis Act visits with unrelenting penalties the faithful men and women\r\nwho render to the fugitive that countenance, succor, and shelter which\r\nin their conscience \"religion\" requires; and thus is practical religion\r\ndirectly assailed. Plain commandments are broken; and are we not told\r\nthat \"Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall\r\nteach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of Heaven\"?\r\n\r\nAs it is for the public weal that there should be an end of suits, so by\r\nthe consent of civilized nations these must be instituted within fixed\r\nlimitations of time; but this Act, exalting Slavery above even this\r\npractical principle of universal justice, ordains proceedings against\r\nFreedom without any reference to the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nGlancing only at these points, and not stopping for argument,\r\nvindication, or illustration, I come at once upon two chief radical\r\nobjections to this Act, identical in principle with those triumphantly\r\nurged by our fathers against the British Stamp Act; first, that it is a\r\nusurpation by Congress of powers not granted by the Constitution, and an\r\ninfraction of rights secured to the States; and, secondly, that it\r\ntakes away Trial by Jury in a question of Personal Liberty and a suit\r\nat Common Law. Either of these objections, if sustained, strikes at the\r\nvery root of the Act. That it is obnoxious to both is beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nHere, at this stage, I encounter the difficulty, that these objections\r\nare already foreclosed by legislation of Congress and decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court,--that as early as 1793 Congress assumed power over this\r\nsubject by an Act which failed to secure Trial by Jury, and that the\r\nvalidity of this Act under the Constitution has been affirmed by the\r\nSupreme Court. On examination, this difficulty will disappear.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1793 proceeded from a Congress that had already recognized\r\nthe United States Bank, chartered by a previous Congress, which,\r\nthough sanctioned by the Supreme Court, has been since in high quarters\r\npronounced unconstitutional. If it erred as to the Bank, it may have\r\nerred also as to fugitives from service. But the Act itself contains a\r\ncapital error on this very subject, so declared by the Supreme Court,\r\nin pretending to vest a portion of the judicial power of the Nation\r\nin State officers. This error takes from the Act all authority as an\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution. I dismiss it.\r\n\r\nThe decisions of the Supreme Court are entitled to great consideration,\r\nand will not be mentioned by me except with respect. Among the memories\r\nof my youth are happy days when I sat at the feet of this tribunal,\r\nwhile MARSHALL presided, with STORY by his side. The pressure now\r\nproceeds from the case of Prigg v. Pennsylvania (16 Peters, 539), where\r\nis asserted the power of Congress. Without going into minute\r\ncriticism of this judgment, or considering the extent to which it is\r\nextra-judicial, and therefore of no binding force,--all which has been\r\ndone at the bar in one State, and by an able court in another,--but\r\nconceding to it a certain degree of weight as a rule to the judiciary on\r\nthis particular point, still it does not touch the grave question which\r\nsprings from the denial of Trial by Jury. This judgment was pronounced\r\nby Mr. Justice Story. From the interesting biography of the great\r\njurist, recently published by his son, we learn that the question of\r\nTrial by Jury was not considered as before the Court; so that, in the\r\nestimation of the learned judge himself, it was still an open question.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n(1). _First of the power of Congress over this subject_.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution contains _powers_ granted to Congress, _compacts_\r\nbetween the States, and _prohibitions_ addressed to the Nation and to\r\nthe States. A compact or prohibition may be accompanied by a power,--but\r\nnot necessarily, for it is essentially distinct in nature. And here the\r\nsingle question arises, Whether the Constitution, by grant, general or\r\nspecial, confers upon Congress any power to legislate on the subject of\r\nfugitives from service.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution were wise and careful, having a reason\r\nfor what they did, and understanding the language they employed. They\r\ndid not, after discussion, incorporate into their work any superfluous\r\nprovision; nor did they without design adopt the peculiar arrangement\r\nin which it appears. Adding to the record compact an express grant of\r\npower, they testified not only their desire for such power in Congress,\r\nbut their conviction that without such express grant it would not\r\nexist. But if express grant was necessary in this case, it was equally\r\nnecessary in all the other cases. _Expressum facit cessare tacitum_.\r\nEspecially, in view of its odious character, was it necessary in the\r\ncase of fugitives from service. Abstaining from any such grant, and then\r\ngrouping the bare compact with other similar compacts, separate from\r\nevery grant of power, they testified their purpose most significantly.\r\nNot only do they decline all addition to the compact of any such power,\r\nbut, to render misapprehension impossible, to make assurance doubly\r\nsure, to exclude any contrary conclusion, they punctiliously arrange the\r\nclauses, on the principle of _noscitur a sociis_, so as to distinguish\r\nall the grants of power, but especially to make the new grant of power,\r\nin the case of public records, stand forth in the front by itself,\r\nsevered from the naked compacts with which it was originally associated.\r\n\r\nThus the proceedings of the Convention show that the founders understood\r\nthe necessity of powers in certain cases, and, on consideration,\r\njealously granted them. A closing example will strengthen the argument.\r\nCongress is expressly empowered \"to establish an uniform rule of\r\nnaturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies,\r\nthroughout the United States.\" Without this provision these two subjects\r\nwould have fallen within the control of the States, leaving the nation\r\npowerless to establish a uniform rule thereupon. Now, instead of the\r\nexisting compact on fugitives from service, it would have been easy,\r\nhad any such desire prevailed, to add this case to the clause on\r\nnaturalization and bankruptcies, and to empower Congress To ESTABLISH A\r\nUNIFORM RULE FOR THE SURRENDER OF FUGITIVES FROM SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE\r\nUNITED STATES. Then, of course, whenever Congress undertook to exercise\r\nthe power, all State control of the subject would be superseded. The\r\nNational Government would have been constistuted, like Nimrod, the\r\nmighty Hunter, with power to gather the huntsmen, to halloo the pack,\r\nand to direct the chase of men, ranging at will, without regard to\r\nboundaries or jurisdictions, throughout all the States. But no person\r\nin the Convention, not one of the reckless partisans of slavery, was so\r\naudacious as to make this proposition. Had it been distinctly made, it\r\nwould have been as distinctly denied.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the provision on this subject was adopted unanimously,\r\nwhile showing the little importance attached to it in the shape it\r\nfinally assumed, testifies also that it could not have been regarded as\r\na source of national power for Slavery. It will be remembered that among\r\nthe members of the Convention were Gouverneur Morris, who had said that\r\nhe \"NEVER would concur in upholding domestic Slavery,\"--Elbridge\r\nGerry, who thought we \"ought to be careful NOT to give any sanction\r\nto it,\"--Roger Sherman, who \"was OPPOSED to a tax on slaves imported,\r\nbecause it implied they were property,\"--James Madison, who \"thought it\r\nWRONG to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property\r\nin men,\"--and Benjamin Franklin, who likened American slaveholders to\r\nAlgerine corsairs. In the face of these unequivocal judgments, it is\r\nabsurd to suppose that these eminent citizens consented unanimously to\r\nany provision by which the National Government, the creature of their\r\nhands, dedicated to freedom, could become the most offensive agent of\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\nThus much for the evidence from the history of the Convention. But\r\nthe true principles of our political system are in harmony with this\r\nconclusion of history; and here let me say a word of State rights.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of our fathers to create a National Government,\r\nand to endow it with adequate powers. They had known the perils of\r\nimbecility, discord, and confusion, protracted through the uncertain\r\ndays of the Confederation, and they desired a government which should\r\nbe a true bond of union and an efficient organ of national interests at\r\nhome and abroad. But while fashioning this agency, they fully recognized\r\nthe governments of the States. To the nation were delegated high powers,\r\nessential to the national interests, but specific in character and\r\nlimited in number. To the States and to the people were reserved the\r\npowers, general in character and unlimited in number, not delegated to\r\nthe nation or prohibited to the States.\r\n\r\nThe integrity of our political system depends upon harmony in the\r\noperations of the Nation and of the States. While the nation within its\r\nwide orbit is supreme, the States move with equal supremacy in their\r\nown. But, from the necessity of the case, the supremacy of each in\r\nits proper place excludes the other. The Nation cannot exercise rights\r\nreserved to the States, nor can the States interfere with the powers\r\nof the nation. Any such action on either side is a usurpation. These\r\nprinciples were distinctly declared by Mr. Jefferson in 1798, in words\r\noften adopted since, and which must find acceptance from all parties.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI have already amply shown to-day that Slavery is in no respect\r\nnational--that it is not within the sphere of national activity,--that\r\nit has no \"positive\" support in the Constitution,--and that any\r\ninterpretation inconsistent with this principle would be abhorrent to\r\nthe sentiments of its founders. Slavery is a local institution, peculiar\r\nto the States, and under the guardianship of State rights. It\r\nis impossible, without violence to the spirit and letter of the\r\nConstitution, to claim for Congress any power to legislate either for\r\nits abolition in the States or its support anywhere. Non-Intervention\r\nis the rule prescribed to the nation. Regarding the question in its more\r\ngeneral aspects only, and putting aside, for the moment, the perfect\r\nevidence from the records of the convention, it is palpable that there\r\nis no national fountain out of which the existing Slave Act can possibly\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nBut this Act is not only an unwarrantable assumption of power by the\r\nnation, it is also an infraction of rights reserved to the States.\r\nEverywhere within their borders the States are peculiar guardians of\r\npersonal liberty. By jury and habeas corpus to save the citizen harmless\r\nagainst all assault is among their duties and rights. To his State the\r\ncitizen, when oppressed, may appeal; nor should he find that appeal\r\ndenied. But this Act despoils him of rights, and despoils his State\r\nof all power to protect him. It subjects him to the wretched chance of\r\nfalse oaths, forged papers, and facile commissioners, and takes from\r\nhim every safeguard. Now, if the slaveholder has a right to be secure\r\nat home in the enjoyment of Slavery, so also has the freeman of the\r\nNorth--and every person there is presumed to be a free man--an equal\r\nright to be secure at home in the enjoyment of freedom. The same\r\nprinciple of State rights by which Slavery is protected in the slave\r\nStates throws an impenetrable shield over Freedom in the free States.\r\nAnd here, let me say, is the only security for Slavery in the slave\r\nStates, as for Freedom in the free States. In the present fatal\r\noverthrow of State rights you teach a lesson which may return to plague\r\nthe teacher. Compelling the National Government to stretch its Briarean\r\narms into the free States for the sake of Slavery, you show openly how\r\nit may stretch these same hundred giant arms into the slave States for\r\nthe sake of Freedom. This lesson was not taught by our fathers.\r\n\r\nHere I end this branch of the question. The true principles of our\r\npolitical system, the history of the National Convention, the natural\r\ninterpretation of the Constitution, all teach that this Act is a\r\nusurpation by Congress of powers that do not belong to it, and an\r\ninfraction of rights secured to the States. It is a sword, whose handle\r\nis at the National Capital, and whose point is everywhere in the States.\r\nA weapon so terrible to personal liberty the nation has no power to\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2). And now of the denial of Trial by Jury.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, for the moment, that Congress is intrusted with power over\r\nthis subject, which truth disowns, still the Act is again radically\r\nunconstitutional from its denial of Trial by Jury in a question of\r\npersonal liberty and a suit of common law. Since on the one side there\r\nis a claim of property, and on the other of liberty, both property\r\nand liberty are involved in the issue. To this claim on either side is\r\nattached Trial by Jury.\r\n\r\nTo me, Sir, regarding this matter in the light of the Common Law and\r\nin the blaze of free institutions, it has always seemed impossible to\r\narrive at any other conclusion. If the language of the Constitution were\r\nopen to doubt, which it is not, still all the presumptions of law,\r\nall the leanings to Freedom, all the suggestions of justice, plead\r\nangel-tongued for this right. Nobody doubts that Congress, if it\r\nlegislates on this matter, may allow a Trial by Jury. But if it may, so\r\noverwhelming is the claim of justice, it MUST. Beyond this, however, the\r\nquestion is determined by the precise letter of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSeveral expressions in the provision for the surrender of fugitives from\r\nservice show the essential character of the proceedings. In the first\r\nplace, the person must be, not merely charged, as in the case of\r\nfugitives from justice, but actually held to service in the State which\r\nhe escaped. In the second place, he must \"be delivered up on claim\r\nof the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\" These two\r\nfacts--that he was held to service, and that his service was due to\r\nhis claimant--are directly placed in issue, and must be proved. Two\r\nnecessary incidents of the delivery may also be observed. First, it\r\nis made in the State where the fugitive is found; and, secondly,\r\nit restores to the claimant complete control over the person of the\r\nfugitive. From these circumstances it is evident that the proceedings\r\ncannot be regarded, in any just sense, as preliminary, or ancillary\r\nto some future formal trial, but as complete in themselves, final and\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings determine on the one side the question of property,\r\nand on the other the sacred question of personal liberty in its most\r\ntranscendent form,--Liberty not merely for a day or a year, but for\r\nlife, and the Liberty of generations that shall come after, so long as\r\nSlavery endures. To these questions the Constitution, by two specific\r\nprovisions, attaches Trial by Jury. One is the familiar clause, already\r\nadduced: \"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property\r\nwithout due process of law,\"--that is, without due proceeding at law,\r\nwith Trial by Jury. Not stopping to dwell on this, I press at once to\r\nthe other provision, which is still more express: \"In suits at common\r\nlaw, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the\r\nright of Trial by Jury shall be preserved.\" This clause, which does not\r\nappear in the Constitution as first adopted, was suggested by the very\r\nspirit of freedom. At the close of the National Convention, Elbridge\r\nGerry refused to sign the Constitution because, among other things,\r\nit established \"a tribunal without juries, a star chamber as to civil\r\ncases.\"\r\n\r\nMany united in his opposition, and on the recommendation of the First\r\nCongress this additional safeguard was adopted as an amendment.\r\n\r\nOpposing this Act as doubly unconstitutional from the want of power\r\nin Congress and from the denial of trial by jury, I find myself again\r\nencouraged by the example of our Revolutionary Fathers, in a case which\r\nis a landmark of history. The parallel is important and complete. In\r\n1765, the British Parliament, by a notorious statute, attempted to draw\r\nmoney from the colonies through a stamp tax, while the determination of\r\ncertain questions of forfeiture under the statute was delegated, not to\r\nthe Courts of Common Law, but to Courts of Admiralty without a jury. The\r\nStamp Act, now execrated by all lovers of liberty, had this extent and\r\nno more. Its passage was the signal for a general flame of opposition\r\nand indignation throughout the colonies. It was denounced as contrary\r\nto the British Constitution, on two principal grounds--first, as\r\na usurpation by Parliament of powers not belonging to it, and an\r\ninfraction of rights secured to the colonies; and, secondly, as a denial\r\nof Trial by Jury in certain cases of property.\r\n\r\nThe public feeling was variously expressed. At Boston, on the day the\r\nact was to take effect, the shops were closed, the bells of the churches\r\ntolled, and the flags of the ships hung at half-mast. At Portsmouth, in\r\nNew Hampshire, the bells were tolled, and the friends of liberty were\r\nsummoned to hold themselves in readiness for her funeral. At New York,\r\nthe obnoxious Act, headed \"Folly of England and Ruin of America,\"\r\nwas contemptuously hawked about the streets. Bodies of patriots were\r\norganized everywhere under the name of \"Sons of Liberty.\" The merchants,\r\ninspired then by liberty, resolved to import no more goods from England\r\nuntil the repeal of the Act. The orators also spoke. James Otis with\r\nfiery tongue appealed to Magna Charta.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSir, regarding the Stamp Act candidly and cautiously, free from\r\nanimosities of the time, it is impossible not to see that, though\r\ngravely unconstitutional, it was at most an infringement of civil\r\nliberty only, not of personal liberty. There was an unjust tax of a few\r\npence, with the chance of amercement by a single judge without a jury;\r\nbut by no provision of this act was the personal liberty of any man\r\nassailed. No freeman could be seized under it as a slave. Such an act,\r\nthough justly obnoxious to every lover of constitutional Liberty, cannot\r\nbe viewed with the feelings of repugnance enkindled by a statute which\r\nassails the personal liberty of every man, and under which any freeman\r\nmay be seized as a slave. Sir, in placing the Stamp Act by the side of\r\nthe Slave Act, I do injustice to that emanation of British tyranny. Both\r\ninfringe important rights: one, of property; the other, the vital right\r\nof all, which is to other rights as soul to body,--the right of a man\r\nto himself. Both are condemned; but their relative condemnation must be\r\nmeasured by their relative characters. As Freedom is more than property,\r\nas Man is above the dollar that he owns, as heaven, to which we all\r\naspire, is higher than earth, where every accumulation of wealth must\r\never remain, so are the rights assailed by an American Congress higher\r\nthan those once assailed by the British Parliament. And just in this\r\ndegree must history condemn the Slave Act more than the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nSir, I might here stop. It is enough, in this place, and on this\r\noccasion, to show the unconstitutionality of this enactment. Your duty\r\ncommences at once. All legislation hostile to the fundamental law of\r\nthe land should be repealed without delay. But the argument is not yet\r\nexhausted. Even if this Act could claim any validity or apology under\r\nthe Constitution, which it cannot, it lacks that essential support in\r\nthe Public Conscience of the States, where it is to be enforced, which\r\nis the life of all law, and with-out which any law must become a dead\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWith every attempt to administer the Slave Act, it constantly becomes\r\nmore revolting, particularly in its influence on the agents it enlists.\r\nPitch cannot be touched without defilement, and all who lend themselves\r\nto this work seem at once and unconsciously to lose the better part of\r\nman. The spirit of the law passes into them, as the devils entered the\r\nswine. Upstart commissioners, mere mushrooms of courts, vie and revie\r\nwith each other. Now by indecent speed, now by harshness of manner, now\r\nby denial of evidence, now by crippling the defense, and now by open,\r\nglaring wrong they make the odious Act yet more odious. Clemency, grace,\r\nand justice die in its presence. All this is observed by the world. Not\r\na case occurs which does not harrow the souls of good men, and bring\r\ntears of sympathy to the eyes, and those nobler tears which \"patriots\r\nshed o'er dying laws.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I shall speak frankly. If there be an exception to this feeling,\r\nit will be found chiefly with a peculiar class. It is a sorry fact, that\r\nthe \"mercantile interest,\" in unpardonable selfishness, twice in English\r\nhistory, frowned upon endeavors to suppress the atrocity of Algerine\r\nSlavery, that it sought to baffle Wilberforce's great effort for the\r\nabolition of the African slave-trade, and that, by a sordid compromise,\r\nat the formation of our Constitution, it exempted the same detested,\r\nHeaven-defying traffic from American judgment. And now representatives\r\nof this \"interest,\" forgetful that Commerce is born of Freedom, join in\r\nhunting the Slave. But the great heart of the people recoils from this\r\nenactment. It palpitates for the fugitive, and rejoices in his escape.\r\nSir, I am telling you facts. The literature of the age is all on his\r\nside. Songs, more potent than laws, are for him. Poets, with voices of\r\nmelody, sing for Freedom. Who could tune for Slavery? They who make\r\nthe permanent opinion of the country, who mould our youth,whose words,\r\ndropped into the soul, are the germs of character, supplicate for the\r\nSlave. And now, Sir, behold a new and heavenly ally. A woman, inspired\r\nby Christian genius, enters the lists, like another Joan of Arc, and\r\nwith marvellous power sweeps the popular heart. Now melting to tears,\r\nand now inspiring to rage, her work everywhere touches the conscience,\r\nand makes the Slave-Hunter more hateful. In a brief period, nearly\r\none hundred thousand copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin have been already\r\ncirculated. But this extraordinary and sudden success, surpassing all\r\nother instances in the records of literature, cannot be regarded as but\r\nthe triumph of genius. Better far, it is the testimony of the people, by\r\nan unprecedented act, against the Fugitive Slave Bill.\r\n\r\nThese things I dwell upon as incentives and tokens of an existing public\r\nsentiment, rendering this Act practically inoperative, except as a\r\ntremendous engine of horror. Sir, the sentiment is just. Even in the\r\nlands of Slavery, the slave-trader is loathed as an ignoble character,\r\nfrom whom the countenance is turned away; and can the Slave-Hunter be\r\nmore regarded, while pursuing his prey in a land of Freedom? In early\r\nEurope, in barbarous days, while Slavery prevailed, a Hunting Master\r\nwas held in aversion. Nor was this all. The fugitive was welcomed in the\r\ncities, and protected against pursuit. Sometimes vengeance awaited\r\nthe Hunter. Down to this day, at Revel, now a Russian city, a sword\r\nis proudly preserved with which a hunting Baron was beheaded, who, in\r\nviolation of the municipal rights of the place, seized a fugitive slave.\r\nHostile to this Act as our public sentiment may be, it exhibits no\r\nsimilar trophy. The State laws of Massachusetts have been violated in\r\nthe seizure of a fugitive slave; but no sword, like that of Revel, now\r\nhangs at Boston.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, let us review the field over which we have passed. We\r\nhave seen that any compromise, finally closing the discussion of Slavery\r\nunder the Constitution, is tyrannical, absurd, and impotent; that, as\r\nSlavery can exist only by virtue of positive law, and as it has no\r\nsuch positive support in the Constitution, it cannot exist within the\r\nnational jurisdiction; that the Constitution nowhere recognizes property\r\nin man, and that, according to its true interpretation, Freedom and not\r\nSlavery is national, while Slavery and not Freedom is sectional;that\r\nin this spirit the National Government was first organized under\r\nWashington, himself an Abolitionist, surrounded by Abolitionists, while\r\nthe whole country, by its Church, its Colleges, its Literature, and all\r\nits best voices, was united against Slavery, and the national flag at\r\nthat time nowhere within the National Territory covered a single slave;\r\nstill further, that the National Government is a government of delegated\r\npowers, and, as among these there is no power to support Slavery, this\r\ninstitution cannot be national, nor can Congress in any way legislate\r\nin its behalf; and, finally, that the establishment of this principle is\r\nthe true way of peace and safety for the Republic. Considering next the\r\nprovision for the surrender of fugitives from service, we have seen that\r\nit was not one of the original compromises of the Constitution; that\r\nit was introduced tardily and with hesitation, and adopted with little\r\ndiscussion, while then and for a long period thereafter it was regarded\r\nwith comparative indifference; that the recent Slave Act, though many\r\ntimes unconstitutional, is especially so on two grounds, first, as a\r\nusurpation by Congress of powers not granted by the Constitution, and an\r\ninfraction of rights secured to the States, and, secondly, as the denial\r\nof Trial by Jury, in a question of personal liberty and a suit at Common\r\nLaw; that its glaring unconstitutionality finds a prototype in the\r\nBritish Stamp Act, which our fathers refused to obey as unconstitutional\r\non two parallel grounds,--first, because it was a usurpation by\r\nParliament of powers not belonging to it under the British Constitution,\r\nand an infraction of rights belonging to the Colonies, and, secondly,\r\nbecause it was the denial of Trial by Jury in certain cases of property;\r\nthat, as Liberty is far above property, so is the outrage perpetrated\r\nby the American Congress far above that perpetrated by the British\r\nParliament; and, finally, that the Slave Act has not that support, in\r\nthe public sentiment of the States where it is to be executed, which is\r\nthe life of all law, and which prudence and the precept of Washington\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have occupied much time; but the great subject still\r\nstretches before us. One other point yet remains, which I must not leave\r\nuntouched, and which justly belongs to the close. The Slave Act violates\r\nthe Constitution, and shocks the Public Conscience. With modesty, and\r\nyet with firmness, let me add, Sir,it offends against the Divine Law.\r\nNo such enactment is entitled to support. As the throne of God is above\r\nevery earthly throne, so are his laws and statutes above all the laws\r\nand statutes of man. To question these is to question God himself. But\r\nto assume that human laws are beyond question is to claim for their\r\nfallible authors infallibility. To assume that they are always in\r\nconformity with the laws of God is presumptuously and impiously to exalt\r\nman even to equality with God. Clearly, human laws are not always\r\nin such conformity; nor can they ever be beyond question from each\r\nindividual. Where the conflict is open, as if Congress should command\r\nthe perpetration of murder, the office of conscience as final arbiter is\r\nundisputed. But in every conflict the same queenly office is hers. By\r\nno earthly power can she be dethroned. Each person, after anxious\r\nexamination, without haste, without passion, solemnly for himself must\r\ndecide this great controversy. Any other rule attributes infallibility\r\nto human laws, places them beyond question, and degrades all men to an\r\nunthinking, passive obedience.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe mandates of an earthly power are to be discussed; those of Heaven\r\nmust at once be performed; nor should we suffer ourselves to be drawn\r\nby any compact into opposition to God. Such is the rule of morals.\r\nSuch, also, by the lips of judges and sages, is the proud declaration\r\nof English law, whence our own is derived. In this conviction, patriots\r\nhave braved unjust commands, and martyrs have died.\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, the rule is commended to us. The good citizen, who sees\r\nbefore him the shivering fugitive, guilty of no crime, pursued, hunted\r\ndown like a beast, while praying for Christian help and deliverance, and\r\nthen reads the requirements of this Act, is filled with horror. Here\r\nis a despotic mandate \"to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient\r\nexecution of this law.\" Again let me speak frankly. Not rashly would I\r\nset myself against any requirement of law. This grave responsibility\r\nI would not lightly assume. But here the path of duty is clear. By the\r\nSupreme Law, which commands me to do no injustice, by the comprehensive\r\nChristian Law of Brotherhood, by the Constitution, which I have sworn to\r\nsupport, I AM BOUND TO DISOBEY THIS ACT. Never, in any capacity, can\r\nI render voluntary aid in its execution. Pains and penalties I will\r\nendure, but this great wrong, I will not do. \"Where I cannot obey\r\nactively, there I am willing to lie down and to suffer what they shall\r\ndo unto me\"; such was the exclamation of him to whom we are indebted for\r\nthe Pilgrim's Progress while in prison for disobedience to an earthly\r\nstatute. Better suffer injustice than do it. Better victim than\r\ninstrument of wrong. Better even the poor slave returned to bondage than\r\nthe wretched Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThere is, sir, an incident of history which suggests a parallel, and\r\naffords a lesson of fidelity. Under the triumphant exertions of that\r\nApostolic Jesuit, St. Francis Xavier, large numbers of Japanese,\r\namounting to as many as two hundred thousand,--among them princes,\r\ngenerals, and the flower of the nobility,--were converted to\r\nChristianity. Afterwards, amidst the frenzy of civil war, religious\r\npersecution arose, and the penalty of death was denounced against all\r\nwho refused to trample upon the effigy of the Redeemer. This was the\r\nPagan law of a Pagan land. But the delighted historian records, that\r\nfrom the multitude of converts scarcely one was guilty of this apostasy.\r\nThe law of man was set at naught. Imprisonment, torture, death, were\r\npreferred. Thus did this people refuse to trample on the painted image.\r\nSir, multitudes among us will not be less steadfast in refusing to\r\ntrample on the living image of their Redeemer.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sir, for the sake of peace and tranquility, cease to shock the\r\nPublic Conscience; for the sake of the Constitution, cease to exercise\r\na power nowhere granted, and which violates inviolable rights expressly\r\nsecured. Leave this question where it was left by our fathers, at the\r\nformation of our National Government,--in the absolute control of\r\nthe States, the appointed guardians of Personal Liberty. Repeal this\r\nenactment. Let its terrors no longer rage through the land. Mindful\r\nof the lowly whom it pursues, mindful of the good men perplexed by its\r\nrequirements, in the name of Charity, in the name of the Constitution,\r\nrepeal this enactment, totally and without delay. There is the example\r\nof Washington, follow it. There also are words of Oriental piety,\r\nmost touching and full of warning, which speak to all mankind, and now\r\nespecially to us: \"Beware of the groans of wounded souls, since the\r\ninward sore will at length break out. Oppress not to the utmost a single\r\nheart; for a solitary sigh has power to overturn a whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's American Eloquence, Volume II.
