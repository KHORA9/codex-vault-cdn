The mere incidents\r\nof this growth, which satisfied the childlike curiosity of earlier\r\ngenerations, hardly appeal to a public which is learning to look upon\r\nhistorical narrative not as a simple story, but as an interpretation of\r\nhuman development, and upon historical fact as the complex resultant of\r\ncharacter and conditions; and introspective readers will look less for\r\na list of facts and dates marking the milestones on this national march\r\nthan for suggestions to explain the formation of the army, the spirit\r\nof its leaders and its men, the progress made, and the obstacles\r\novercome. No solution of the problems presented by history will be\r\ncomplete until the knowledge of man is perfect; but we cannot approach\r\nthe threshold of understanding without realizing that our national\r\nachievement has been the outcome of singular powers of assimilation, of\r\nadaptation to changing circumstances, and of elasticity of system.\r\nChange has been, and is, the breath of our existence and the condition\r\nof our growth.\r\n\r\nChange began with the Creation, and ages of momentous development are\r\nshrouded from our eyes. The land and the people are the two foundations\r\nof English history; but before history began, the land had received the\r\ninsular configuration which has largely determined its fortune; and the\r\nvarious peoples, who were to mould and be moulded by the land, had\r\ndifferentiated from the other races of the world. Several of these\r\npeoples had occupied the land before its conquest by the Anglo-Saxons,\r\nsome before it was even Britain. Whether neolithic man superseded\r\npalaeolithic man in these islands by invasion or by domestic evolution,\r\nwe do not know; but centuries before the Christian era the Britons\r\noverran the country and superimposed themselves upon its swarthy, squat\r\ninhabitants. They mounted comparatively high in the scale of\r\ncivilization; they tilled the soil, worked mines, cultivated various\r\nforms of art, and even built towns. But their loose tribal organization\r\nleft them at the mercy of the Romans; and though Julius Caesar's two\r\nraids in 55 B.C. and 54 B.C. left no permanent results, the conquest\r\nwas soon completed when the Romans came in earnest in A.D. 43.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the Romans during the three and a half centuries of\r\ntheir rule in Britain civilized its inhabitants is a matter of doubtful\r\ninference. The remains of Roman roads, Roman walls, and Roman villas\r\nstill bear witness to their material activity; and an occupation of the\r\nland by Roman troops and Roman officials, spread over three hundred and\r\nfifty years, must have impressed upon the upper classes of the Britons\r\nat least some acquaintance with the language, religion, administration,\r\nand social and economic arrangements of the conquerors. But, on the\r\nwhole, the evidence points rather to military occupation than to\r\ncolonization; and the Roman province resembled more nearly a German\r\nthan a British colony of to-day. Rome had then no surplus population\r\nwith which to fill new territory; the only emigrants were the soldiers,\r\nthe officials, and a few traders or prospectors; and of these most were\r\npartially Romanized provincials from other parts of the empire, for a\r\nRoman soldier of the third century A.D. was not generally a Roman or\r\neven an Italian. The imperial government, moreover, considered the\r\ninterests of Britain not in themselves but only as subordinate to the\r\nempire, which any sort of distinctive national organization would have\r\nthreatened. This distinguishes Roman rule in Britain from British rule\r\nin India; and if the army in Britain gradually grew more British, it\r\nwas due to the weakness and not to the policy of the imperial\r\ngovernment. There was no attempt to form a British constitution, or\r\nweld British tribes into a nation; for Rome brought to birth no\r\ndaughter states, lest she should dismember her all-embracing unity. So\r\nthe nascent nations warred within and rent her; and when, enfeebled and\r\ndistracted by the struggle, she relaxed her hold on Britain, she left\r\nit more cultivated, perhaps, but more enervated and hardly stronger or\r\nmore united than before.\r\n\r\nHardier peoples were already hovering over the prey. The Romans had\r\nthemselves established a \"count of the Saxon shore\" to defend the\r\neastern coasts of Britain against the pirates of the German Ocean; and\r\nit was not long after its revolt from Rome in 410, that the Angles and\r\nSaxons and Jutes discovered a chance to meddle in Britain, torn as it\r\nwas by domestic anarchy, and threatened with inroads by the Picts and\r\nScots in the north. Neither this temptation nor the alleged invitation\r\nfrom the British chief Vortigern to come over and help, supplied the\r\noriginal impulse which drove the Angles and Saxons across the sea.\r\nWhatever its origin--whether pressure from other tribes behind,\r\ninternal dissensions, or the economic necessities of a population\r\ngrowing too fast for the produce of primitive farming--the restlessness\r\nwas general; but while the Goths and the Franks poured south over the\r\nRoman frontiers on land, the Angles and Saxons obeyed a prophetic call\r\nto the sea and the setting sun.\r\n\r\nThis migration by sea is a strange phenomenon. That nations should\r\nwander by land was no new thing; but how in those days whole tribes\r\ntransported themselves, their wives and their chattels, from the mouths\r\nof the Elbe and the Weser to those of the Thames and the Humber, we are\r\nat a loss to understand. Yet come they did, and the name of the Angles\r\nat least, which clung to the land they reached, was blotted out from\r\nthe home they left. It is clear that they came in detachments, as their\r\ndescendants went, centuries later, to a land still further west; and\r\nthe process was spread over a hundred years or more. They conquered\r\nBritain blindly and piecemeal; and the traditional three years which\r\nare said to have elapsed between the occupation of Sheppey and the\r\nlanding in Kent prove not that the puny arm of the intervening sea\r\ndeterred those who had crossed the ocean, but that Sheppey was as much\r\nas these petrels of the storm could manage. The failure to dislodge\r\nthem, and the absence of centralized government and national\r\nconsciousness among the Britons encouraged further invaders; and Kent,\r\neast of the Medway, and the Isle of Wight may have been the next\r\nmorsels they swallowed. These early comers were Jutes, but their easy\r\nsuccess led to imitation by their more numerous southern neighbours,\r\nthe Angles and Saxons; and the torrent of conquest grew in volume and\r\nrapidity. Invaders by sea naturally sailed or rowed up the rivers, and\r\nall conquerors master the plains before the hills, which are the home\r\nof lost causes and the refuge of native states. Their progress may be\r\ntraced in the names of English kingdoms and shires: in the south the\r\nSaxons founded the kingdoms of Sussex, Essex, Middlesex, and Wessex; in\r\nthe east the Anglians founded East Anglia, though in the north they\r\nretained the Celtic names, Bernicia and Deira. The districts in which\r\nthey met and mingled have less distinctive names; Surrey was perhaps\r\ndisputed between all the Saxon kingdoms, Hampshire between West Saxons,\r\nSouth Saxons, and Jutes; while in the centre Mercia was a mixed march\r\nor borderland of Angles and Saxons against the retiring Britons or\r\nWelsh.\r\n\r\nIt used to be almost a point of honour with champions of the\r\nsuperiority of Anglo-Saxon virtues to maintain that the invaders, like\r\nthe Israelites of old, massacred their enemies to a man, if not also to\r\na woman and child. Massacre there certainly was at Anderida and other\r\nplaces taken by storm, and no doubt whole British villages fled at the\r\napproach of their bloodthirsty foes; but as the wave of conquest rolled\r\nfrom east to west, and the concentration of the Britons grew while that\r\nof the invader relaxed, there was less and less extermination. The\r\nEnglish hordes cannot have been as numerous in women as in men; and in\r\nthat case some of the British women would be spared. It no more\r\nrequired wholesale slaughter of the Britons to establish English\r\nlanguage and institutions in Britain than it required wholesale\r\nslaughter of the Irish to produce the same results in Ireland; and a\r\nlarge admixture of Celtic blood in the English race can hardly be\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Anglo-Saxons began to fight one another before they\r\nceased to fight their common enemy, who must have profited by this\r\ninternecine strife. Of the process by which the migrating clans and\r\nfamilies were blended into tribal kingdoms, we learn nothing; but the\r\nblending favoured expansion, and expansion brought the tribal kingdoms\r\ninto hostile contact with tougher rivals than the Britons. The\r\nexpansion of Sussex and Kent was checked by Saxons who had landed in\r\nEssex or advanced up the Thames and the Itchen; East Anglia was hemmed\r\nin by tribes who had sailed up the Wash, the Humber, and their\r\ntributaries; and the three great kingdoms which emerged out of the\r\nanarchy--Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex--seem to have owed the\r\nsupremacy, which they wielded in turn, to the circumstance that each\r\npossessed a British hinterland into which it could expand. For\r\nNorthumbria there was Strathclyde on the west and Scotland on the\r\nnorth; for Mercia there was Wales; and for Wessex there were the\r\nBritish remnants in Devon and in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nBut a kingdom may have too much hinterland. Scotland taxed for\r\ncenturies the assimilative capacity of united England; it was too much\r\nfor Northumbria to digest. Northumbria's supremacy was distinguished by\r\nthe religious labours of Aidan and Cuthbert and Wilfrid in England, by\r\nthe missions of Willibrord on the Continent, and by the revival of\r\nliterature and learning under Caedmon and Bede; but it spent its\r\nsubstance in efforts to conquer Scotland, and then fell a victim to the\r\nbarbaric strength of Mercia and to civil strife between its component\r\nparts, Bernicia and Deira. Mercia was even less homogeneous than\r\nNorthumbria; it had no frontiers worth mention; and in spite of its\r\nmilitary prowess it could not absorb a hinterland treble the size of\r\nthe Wales which troubled Edward I. Wessex, with serviceable frontiers\r\nconsisting of the Thames, the Cotswolds, the Severn, and the sea, and\r\nwith a hinterland narrowing down to the Cornish peninsula, developed a\r\nslower but more lasting strength. Political organization seems to have\r\nbeen its forte, and it had set its own house in some sort of order\r\nbefore it was summoned by Ecgberht to assume the lead in English\r\npolitics. From that day to this the sceptre has remained in his house\r\nwithout a permanent break.\r\n\r\nSome slight semblance of political unity was thus achieved, but it was\r\nalready threatened by the Northmen and Danes, who were harrying England\r\nin much the same way as the English, three centuries earlier, had\r\nharried Britain. The invaders were invaded because they had forsaken\r\nthe sea to fight one another on land; and then Christianity had come to\r\ntame their turbulent vigour. A wave of missionary zeal from Rome and a\r\nbackwash from unconquered Ireland had met at the synod of Whitby in\r\n664, and Roman priests recovered what Roman soldiers had lost. But the\r\nchurch had not yet armed itself with the weapons of the world, and\r\nChristian England was no more a match than Christian Britain had been\r\nfor a heathen foe. Ecgberht's feeble successors in Wessex, and their\r\nfeebler rivals in the subordinate kingdoms, gave way step by step\r\nbefore the Danes, until in 879 Ecgberht's grandson Alfred the Great\r\nwas, like a second King Arthur, a fugitive lurking in the recesses of\r\nhis disappearing realm.\r\n\r\nWessex, however, was more closely knit than any Celtic realm had been;\r\nthe Danes were fewer than their Anglo-Saxon predecessors; and Alfred\r\nwas made of sterner stuff than early British princes. He was typical of\r\nWessex; moral strength and all-round capacity rather than supreme\r\nability in any one direction are his title-deeds to greatness. After\r\nhard fighting he imposed terms of peace upon the Danish leader Guthrum.\r\nEngland south-west of Watling Street, which ran from London to Chester,\r\nwas to be Alfred's, the rest to be Danish; and Guthrum succumbed to the\r\npacifying influence of Christianity. Not the least of Alfred's gains\r\nwas the destruction of Mercia's unity; its royal house had disappeared\r\nin the struggle, and the kingdom was now divided; while Alfred lost his\r\nnominal suzerainty over north-east England, he gained a real\r\nsovereignty over south-west Mercia. His children, Edward the Elder and\r\nEthelfleda, the Lady of the Mercians, and his grandson Athelstan,\r\npushed on the expansion of Wessex thus begun, dividing the land as they\r\nwon it into shires, each with a burh (borough) or fortified centre for\r\nits military organization; and Anglo-Saxon monarchy reached its zenith\r\nunder Edgar, who ruled over the whole of England and asserted a\r\nsuzerainty over most of Britain.\r\n\r\nIt was transitory glory and superficial unity; for there was no real\r\npossibility of a national state in Anglo-Saxon-Celtic-Danish England,\r\nand the whole meaning of English history is missed in antedating that\r\nachievement by several hundred years. Edgar could do no more than evade\r\ndifficulties and temporize with problems which imperceptible growth\r\nalone could solve; and the idealistic pictures of early England are not\r\ndrawn from life, but inspired by a belief in good old days and an\r\nunconscious appreciation of the polemical value of such a theory in\r\npolitical controversy. Tacitus, a splenetic Roman aristocrat, had\r\nsatirized the degeneracy of the empire under the guise of a description\r\nof the primitive virtues of a Utopian Germany; and modern theorists\r\nhave found in his _Germania_ an armoury of democratic weapons\r\nagainst aristocracy and despotism. From this golden age the Angles and\r\nSaxons are supposed to have derived a political system in which most\r\nmen were free and equal, owning their land in common, debating and\r\ndeciding in folkmoots the issues of peace and war, electing their kings\r\n(if any), and obeying them only so far as they inspired respect. These\r\nidyllic arrangements, if they ever existed, did not survive the stress\r\nof the migration and the struggle with the Celts. War begat the king,\r\nand soon the church baptized him and confirmed his power with unction\r\nand biblical precedents. The moot of the folk became the moot of the\r\nWise (Witan), and only those were wise whose wisdom was apparent to the\r\nking. Community of goods and equality of property broke down in the\r\nvast appropriation involved in the conquest of Britain; and when, after\r\ntheir conversion to Christianity, the barbarians learnt to write and\r\nleft authentic records, they reveal a state of society which bears some\r\nresemblance to that of medieval England but little to that of the\r\nmythical golden age.\r\n\r\nUpon a nation of freemen in arms had been superimposed a class of\r\nmilitary specialists, of whom the king was head. Specialization had\r\nbroken down the system by which all men did an equal amount of\r\neverything. The few, who were called thegns, served the king, generally\r\nby fighting his enemies, while the many worked for themselves and for\r\nthose who served the king. All holders of land, however, had to serve\r\nin the national levy and to help in maintaining the bridges and\r\nprimitive fortifications. But there were endless degrees of inequality\r\nin wealth; some now owned but a fraction of what had been the normal\r\nshare of a household in the land; others held many shares, and the\r\npossession of five shares became the dividing line between the class\r\nfrom which the servants of the king were chosen and the rest of the\r\ncommunity. While this inequality increased, the tenure of land grew\r\nmore and more important as the basis of social position and political\r\ninfluence. Land has little value for nomads, but so soon as they settle\r\nits worth begins to grow; and the more labour they put into the land,\r\nthe higher rises its value and the less they want to leave it; in a\r\npurely agricultural community land is the great source of everything\r\nworth having, and therefore the main object of desire.\r\n\r\nBut it became increasingly difficult for the small man to retain his\r\nholding. He needed protection, especially during the civil wars of the\r\nHeptarchy and the Danish inroads which followed. There was, however, no\r\ngovernment strong enough to afford protection, and he had to seek it\r\nfrom the nearest magnate, who might possess armed servants to defend\r\nhim, and perhaps a rudimentary stronghold within which he might shelter\r\nhimself and his belongings till the storm was past. The magnate\r\nnaturally wanted his price for these commodities, and the only price\r\nthat would satisfy him was the poor man's land. So many poor men\r\nsurrendered the ownership of their land, receiving it back to be held\r\nby them as tenants on condition of rendering various services to the\r\nlandlord, such as ploughing his land, reaping his crops, and other\r\nwork. Generally, too, the tenant became the landlord's \"man,\" and did\r\nhim homage; and, thirdly, he would be bound to attend the court in\r\nwhich the lord or his steward exercised jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThis growth of private jurisdiction was another sign of the times.\r\nJustice had once been administered in the popular moots, though from\r\nvery early times there had been social distinctions. Each village had\r\nits \"best\" men, generally four in number, who attended the moots of the\r\nlarger districts called the Hundreds; and the \"best\" were probably\r\nthose who had inherited or acquired the best homesteads. This\r\naristocracy sometimes shrank to one, and the magnate, to whom the poor\r\nsurrendered their land in return for protection, often acquired also\r\nrights of jurisdiction, receiving the fines and forfeits imposed for\r\nbreaches of the law. He was made responsible, too, for the conduct of\r\nhis poorer neighbours. Originally the family had been made to answer\r\nfor the offences of its members; but the tie of blood-relationship\r\nweakened as the bond of neighbourhood grew stronger with attachment to\r\nthe soil; and instead of the natural unit of the family, an artificial\r\nunit was created for the purpose of responsibility to the law by\r\nassociating neighbours together in groups of ten, called peace-pledges\r\nor frith-borhs. It is at least possible that the \"Hundred\" was a\r\nfurther association of ten frith-borhs as a higher and more responsible\r\nunit for the administration of justice. But the landless man was\r\nworthless as a member of a frith-borh, for the law had little hold over\r\na man who had no land to forfeit and no fixed habitation. So the\r\nlandless man was compelled by law to submit to a lord, who was held\r\nresponsible for the behaviour of all his \"men\"; his estate became, so\r\nto speak, a private frith-borh, consisting of dependents instead of the\r\nfreemen of the public frith-borhs. These two systems, with many\r\nvariations, existed side by side; but there was a general tendency for\r\nthe freemen to get fewer and for the lords to grow more powerful.\r\n\r\nThis growth of over-mighty subjects was due to the fact that a\r\ngovernment which could not protect the poorest could not restrain the\r\nlocal magnates to whom the poor were forced to turn; and the weakness\r\nof the government was due ultimately to the lack of political education\r\nand of material resources. The mass of Englishmen were locally minded;\r\nthere was nothing to suggest national unity to their imagination. They\r\ncould not read, they had no maps, nor pictures of crowned sovereigns,\r\nnot even a flag to wave; none, indeed, of those symbols which bring\r\nhome to the peasant or artisan a consciousness that he belongs to a\r\nnational entity. Their interests centred round the village green; the\r\n\"best\" men travelled further afield to the hundred and shire-moot, but\r\nanything beyond these limits was distant and unreal, the affair of an\r\noutside world with which they had no concern. Anglo-Saxon patriotism\r\nnever transcended provincial boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe government, on the other hand, possessed no proper roads, no\r\nregular means of communication, none of those nerves which enable it to\r\nfeel what goes on in distant parts. The king, indeed, was beginning to\r\nsupply the deficiencies of local and popular organization: a special\r\nroyal peace or protection, which meant specially severe penalties to\r\nthe offender, was being thrown over special places like highways,\r\nmarkets, boroughs, and churches; over special times like Sundays, holy\r\ndays, and the meeting-days of moots; and over special persons like\r\npriests and royal officials. The church, too, strove to set an example\r\nof centralized administration; but its organization was still monastic\r\nrather than parochial and episcopal, and even Dunstan failed to cleanse\r\nit of sloth and simony. With no regular system of taxation, little\r\ngovernment machinery, and no police, standing army, or royal judges, it\r\nwas impossible to enforce royal protection adequately, or to check the\r\ncentrifugal tendency of England to break up into its component parts.\r\nThe monarchy was a man rather than a machine; a vigorous ruler could\r\nmake some impression, but whenever the crown passed to a feeble king,\r\nthe reign of anarchy recommenced.\r\n\r\nAlfred's successors annexed the Danelaw which Alfred had left to\r\nGuthrum, but their efforts to assimilate the Danes provoked in the\r\nfirst place a reaction against West Saxon influence which threatened\r\nmore than once to separate England north of the Thames from Wessex,\r\nand, secondly, a determination on the part of Danes across the sea to\r\nsave their fellow-countrymen in England from absorption. Other causes\r\nno doubt assisted to bring about a renewal of Danish invasion; but the\r\nDanes who came at the end of the tenth century, if they began as\r\nhaphazard bands of rovers, greedy of spoil and ransom, developed into\r\nthe emissaries of an organized government bent on political conquest.\r\nEthelred, who had to suffer from evils that were incurable as well as\r\nfor his predecessors' neglect, bought off the raiders with ever-\r\nincreasing bribes which tempted them to return; and by levying Danegeld\r\nto stop invasion, set a precedent for direct taxation which the\r\ninvaders eventually used as the financial basis of efficient\r\ngovernment. At length a foolish massacre of the Danish \"uitlanders\" in\r\nEngland precipitated the ruin of Anglo-Saxon monarchy; and after heroic\r\nresistance by Edmund Ironside, England was absorbed in the empire of\r\nCanute.\r\n\r\nCanute tried to put himself into the position, while avoiding the\r\nmistakes, of his English predecessors. He adopted the Christian\r\nreligion and set up a force of hus-earls to terrify local magnates and\r\nenforce obedience to the English laws which he re-enacted. His division\r\nof England into four great earldoms seems to have been merely a casual\r\narrangement, but he does not appear to have checked the dangerous\r\npractice by which under Edgar and Ethelred the ealdormen had begun to\r\nconcentrate in their hands the control of various shires. The greater\r\nthe sphere of a subject's jurisdiction, the more it menaced the\r\nmonarchy and national unity; and after Canute's empire had fallen to\r\npieces under his worthless sons, the restoration of Ecgberht's line in\r\nthe person of Edward the Confessor merely provided a figurehead under\r\nwhose nominal rule the great earls of Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, and\r\nEast Anglia fought at first for control of the monarchy and at length\r\nfor the crown itself. The strife resolved itself into a faction fight\r\nbetween the Mercian house of Leofric and the West Saxon house of\r\nGodwine, whose dynastic policy has been magnified into patriotism by a\r\ngreat West Saxon historian. The prize fell for the moment on Edward's\r\ndeath to Godwine's son, Harold, whose ambition to sit on a throne cost\r\nhim his life and the glory, which otherwise might have been his, of\r\nsaving his country from William the Norman. As regent for one of the\r\nscions of Ecgberht's house, he might have relied on the co-operation of\r\nhis rivals; as an upstart on the throne he could only count on the\r\nveiled or open enmity of Mercians and Northumbrians, who regarded him,\r\nand were regarded by him, as hardly less foreign than the invader from\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Hastings sums up a series and clinches an argument.\r\nAnglo-Saxondom had only been saved from Danish marauders by the\r\npersonal greatness of Alfred; it had utterly failed to respond to\r\nEdmund's call to arms against Canute, and the respite under Edward the\r\nConfessor had been frittered away. Angles and Saxons invited foreign\r\nconquest by a civil war; and when Harold beat back Tostig and his\r\nNorwegian ally, the sullen north left him alone to do the same by\r\nWilliam. William's was the third and decisive Danish conquest of a\r\nhouse divided against itself; for his Normans were Northmen with a\r\nFrench polish, and they conquered a country in which the soundest\r\nelements were already Danish. The stoutest resistance, not only in the\r\nmilitary but in the constitutional and social sense, to the Norman\r\nConquest was offered not by Wessex but by the Danelaw, where personal\r\nfreedom had outlived its hey-day elsewhere; and the reflection that,\r\nhad the English re-conquest of the Danelaw been more complete, so, too,\r\nwould have been the Norman Conquest of England, may modify the view\r\nthat everything great and good in England is Anglo-Saxon in origin.\r\nEngland, indeed, was still in the crudest stages of its making; it had\r\nas yet no law worth the name, no trial by jury, no parliament, no real\r\nconstitution, no effective army or navy, no universities, few schools,\r\nhardly any literature, and little art. The disjointed and unruly\r\nmembers of which it consisted in 1066 had to undergo a severe\r\ndiscipline before they could form an organic national state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SUBMERGENCE OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n1066-1272\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nearly two centuries after the Norman Conquest there is no history\r\nof the English people. There is history enough of England, but it is\r\nthe history of a foreign government. We may now feel pride in the\r\nstrength of our conqueror or pretend claims to descent from William's\r\ncompanions. We may boast of the empire of Henry II and the prowess of\r\nRichard I, and we may celebrate the organized law and justice, the\r\nscholarship and the architecture, of the early Plantagenet period; but\r\nthese things were no more English than the government of India to-day\r\nis Hindu. With Waltheof and Hereward English names disappear from\r\nEnglish history, from the roll of sovereigns, ministers, bishops,\r\nearls, and sheriffs; and their place is taken by names beginning with\r\n\"fitz\" and distinguished by \"de.\" No William, Thomas, Henry, Geoffrey,\r\nGilbert, John, Stephen, Richard, or Robert had played any part in\r\nAnglo-Saxon affairs, but they fill the pages of England's history from\r\nthe days of Harold to those of Edward I. The English language went\r\nunderground, and became the patois of peasants; the thin trickle of\r\nAnglo-Saxon literature dried up, for there was no demand for Anglo-\r\nSaxon among an upper class which wrote Latin and spoke French.\r\nForeigners ruled and owned the land, and \"native\" became synonymous\r\nwith \"serf.\"\r\n\r\nTheir common lot, however, gave birth to a common feeling. The Norman\r\nwas more alien to the Mercian than had been Northumbrian or West-Saxon,\r\nand rival tribes at last discovered a bond of unity in the impartial\r\nrigour of their masters. The Norman, coming from outside and exempt\r\nfrom local prejudice, applied the same methods of government and\r\nexploitation to all parts of England, just as Englishmen bring the same\r\nideas to bear upon all parts of India; and in both cases the steady\r\npressure of a superimposed civilization tended to obliterate local and\r\nclass divisions. Unwittingly Norman and Angevin despotism made an\r\nEnglish nation out of Anglo-Saxon tribes, as English despotism has made\r\na nation out of Irish septs, and will make another out of the hundred\r\nraces and religions of our Indian empire. The more efficient a\r\ndespotism, the sooner it makes itself impossible, and the greater the\r\nproblems it stores up for the future, unless it can divest itself of\r\nits despotic attributes and make common cause with the nation it has\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nThe provision of this even-handed tyranny was the great contribution of\r\nthe Normans to the making of England. They had no written law of their\r\nown, but to secure themselves they had to enforce order upon their\r\nschismatic subjects; and they were able to enforce it because, as\r\nmilitary experts, they had no equals in that age. They could not have\r\nstood against a nation in arms; but the increasing cost of equipment\r\nand the growth of poor and landless classes among the Anglo-Saxons had\r\ntransferred the military business of the nation into the hands of large\r\nlandowning specialists; and the Anglo-Saxon warrior was no match for\r\nhis Norman rival, either individually or collectively. His burh was\r\ninferior to the Norman castle, his shield and battle-axe to the weapons\r\nof the mailed and mounted knight; and he had none of the coherence that\r\nwas forced upon the conquerors by the iron hand of William and by their\r\nsituation amid a hostile people.\r\n\r\nThe problem for William and his companions was how to organize this\r\nmilitary superiority as a means of orderly government, and this problem\r\nwore a twofold aspect. William had to control his barons, and his\r\nbarons had to control their vassals. Their methods have been summed up\r\nin the phrase, the \"feudal system,\" which William is still popularly\r\nsupposed to have introduced into England. On the other hand, it has\r\nbeen humourously suggested that the feudal system was really introduced\r\ninto England by Sir Henry Spelman, a seventeenth-century scholar.\r\nOthers have maintained that, so far from feudalism being introduced\r\nfrom Normandy into England, it would be truer to say that feudalism was\r\nintroduced from England into Normandy, and thence spread throughout\r\nFrance. These speculations serve, at any rate, to show that feudalism\r\nwas a very vague and elusive system, consisting of generalizations from\r\na vast number of conflicting data. Spelman was the first to attempt to\r\nreduce these data to a system, and his successors tended to forget more\r\nand more the exceptions to his rules. It is now clear that much that we\r\ncall feudal existed in England before the Norman Conquest; that much of\r\nit was not developed until after the Norman period; and that at no time\r\ndid feudalism exist as a completely rounded and logical system outside\r\nhistorical and legal text-books.\r\n\r\nThe political and social arrangements summed up in the phrase related\r\nprimarily to the land and the conditions of service upon which it was\r\nheld. Commerce and manufactures, and the organization of towns which\r\ngrew out of them, were always exceptions to the feudal system; the\r\nmonarchy saved itself, its sheriffs, and the shires to some extent from\r\nfeudal influence; and soon it set to work to redeem the administration\r\nof justice from its clutches. In all parts of the country, moreover,\r\nthere was land, the tenure of which was never feudalized. Generally,\r\nhowever, the theory was applied that all land was held directly or\r\nindirectly from the king, who was the sole owner of it, that there was\r\nno land without a lord, and that from every acre of land some sort of\r\nservice was due to some one or other. A great deal of it was held by\r\nmilitary service; the tenant-in-chief of this land, who might be either\r\na layman or an ecclesiastic, had to render this military service to the\r\nking, while the sub-tenants had to render it to the tenants-in-chief.\r\nWhen the tenant died his land reverted to the lord, who only granted it\r\nto the heir after the payment of a year's revenue, and on condition of\r\nthe same service being rendered. If the heir were a minor, and thus\r\nincapable of rendering military service, the land was retained by the\r\nlord until the heir came of age; heiresses could only marry with the\r\nlord's leave some one who could perform his services. The tenant had\r\nfurther to attend the lord's court--whether the lord was his king or\r\nnot--submit to his jurisdiction, and pay aids to the lord whenever he\r\nwas captured and needed ransom, when his eldest son was made a knight,\r\nand when his eldest daughter married.\r\n\r\nOther land was held by churchmen on condition of praying or singing for\r\nthe soul of the lord, and the importance of this tenure was that it was\r\nsubject to the church courts and not to those of the king. Some was\r\nheld in what was called free socage, the terms of which varied; but its\r\ndistinguishing feature seems to have been that the service, which was\r\nnot military, was fixed, and that when it was performed the lord had no\r\nfurther hold on the tenant. The great mass of the population were,\r\nhowever, villeins, who were always at the beck and call of their lords,\r\nand had to do as much ploughing, sowing, and reaping of his land as he\r\ncould make them. Theoretically they were his goods and chattels, who\r\ncould obtain no redress against any one except in the lord's court, and\r\nnone at all against him. They could not leave their land, nor marry,\r\nnor enter the church, nor go to school without his leave. All these\r\nforms of tenure and kinds of service, however, shaded off into one\r\nanother, so that it is impossible to draw hard and fast lines between\r\nthem. Any one, moreover, might hold different lands on different terms\r\nof service, so that there was little of caste in the English system; it\r\nwas upon the land and not the person that the service was imposed; and\r\nWilliam's Domesday Book was not a record of the ranks and classes of\r\nthe people, but a survey of the land, detailing the rents and service\r\ndue from every part.\r\n\r\nThe local agency by which the Normans enforced these arrangements was\r\nthe manor. The Anglo-Saxons had organized shires and hundreds, but the\r\nlowest unit, township or vill seems to have had no organization except,\r\nperhaps, for agricultural purposes. The Danegeld, which William imposed\r\nafter the Domesday survey, was assessed on the hundreds, as though\r\nthere were no smaller units from which it could be levied. But the\r\nhundred was found too cumbrous for the efficient control of local\r\ndetails; it was divided into manors, the Normans using for this purpose\r\nthe germs of dependent townships which had long been growing up in\r\nEngland; and the agricultural organization of the township was\r\ndovetailed into the jurisdictional organization of the manor. The lord\r\nbecame the lord of all the land on the manor, the owner of a court\r\nwhich tried local disputes; but he rarely possessed that criminal\r\njurisdiction in matters of life and death which was common in\r\ncontinental feudalism; and if he did, it was only by special royal\r\ngrant, and he was gradually deprived of it by the development of royal\r\ncourts of justice, which drew to themselves large parts of manorial\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThese and other matters were reserved for the old courts of the shire\r\nand hundred, which the Norman kings found it advisable to encourage as\r\na check upon their barons; for the more completely the natives and\r\nvillagers were subjected to their lords, the more necessary was it for\r\nthe king to maintain his hold upon their masters. For this reason\r\nWilliam imposed the famous Salisbury oath. In France the sub-tenant was\r\nbound to follow and obey his immediate lord rather than the king.\r\nWilliam was determined that every man's duty to the king should come\r\nfirst. Similarly, he separated church courts from the secular courts,\r\nin order that the former might be saved from the feudal influence of\r\nthe latter; and he enforced the ecclesiastical reforms of Hildebrand,\r\nespecially the prohibition of the marriage of the clergy, lest they\r\nshould convert their benefices into hereditary fiefs for the benefit of\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\nFor the principles of heredity and primogeniture were among the\r\nstrongest of feudal tendencies. Primogeniture had proved politically\r\nadvantageous; and one of the best things in the Anglo-Saxon monarchy\r\nhad been its avoidance of the practice, prevalent on the Continent, of\r\nkings dividing their dominions among their sons, instead of leaving all\r\nunited to the eldest. But the principle of heredity, sound enough in\r\nnational monarchy, was to prove very dangerous in the other spheres of\r\npolitics. Office tended to become hereditary, and to be regarded as the\r\nprivate property of the family rather than a position of national\r\ntrust, thus escaping national control and being prostituted for\r\npersonal ends. The earldoms in England were so perverted; originally\r\nthey were offices like the modern lords-lieutenancies of the shires;\r\ngradually they became hereditary titles. The only remedy the king had\r\nwas to deprive the earls of their power, and entrust it to a nominal\r\ndeputy, the sheriff. In France, the sheriff  (_vice-comes_, _vicomte_)\r\nbecame hereditary in his turn, and a prolonged struggle over the same\r\ntendency was fought in England. Fortunately, the crown and country\r\ntriumphed over the hereditary principle in this respect; the sheriff\r\nremained an official, and when viscounts were created later, in\r\nimitation of the French nobility, they received only a meaningless and\r\ncomparatively innocuous title.\r\n\r\nSome slight check, too, was retained upon the crown owing to a series\r\nof disputed successions to the throne. The Anglo-Saxon monarchy had\r\nalways been in theory elective, and William had been careful to observe\r\nthe form. His son, William II, had to obtain election in order to\r\nsecure the throne against the claims of his elder brother Robert, and\r\nHenry I followed his example for similar reasons. Each had to make\r\nelection promises in the form of a charter; and election promises,\r\nalthough they were seldom kept, had some value as reminders to kings of\r\ntheir duties and theoretical dependence upon the electors. Gradually,\r\ntoo, the kings began to look for support outside their Norman baronage,\r\nand to realize that even the submerged English might serve as a\r\nmakeweight in a balance of opposing forces. Henry I bid for London's\r\nsupport by the grant of a notable charter; for, assisted by the order\r\nand communications with the Continent fostered by Norman rule, commerce\r\nwas beginning to flourish and towns to grow. London was already\r\ndistancing Winchester in their common ambition to be the capital of the\r\nkingdom, and the support of it and of other towns began to be worth\r\nbuying by grants of local government, more especially as their\r\nencouragement provided another check on feudal magnates. Henry, too,\r\nmade a great appeal to English sentiment by marrying Matilda, the\r\ngranddaughter of Edmund Ironside, and by revenging the battle of\r\nHastings through a conquest of Normandy from his brother Robert,\r\neffected partly by English troops.\r\n\r\nBut the order, which the three Norman sovereigns evolved out of chaos,\r\nwas still due more to their personal vigour than to the strength of the\r\nadministrative machinery which they sought to develop; and though that\r\nmachinery continued to work during the anarchy which followed, it could\r\nnot restrain the feudal barons, when the crown was disputed between\r\nHenry's daughter Matilda and his nephew Stephen. The barons, indeed,\r\nhad been more successful in riveting their baronial yoke on the people\r\nthan the kings had been in riveting a monarchical yoke on the barons;\r\nand nothing more vividly illustrates the utter subjection of Anglo-\r\nSaxons than the fact that the conquerors could afford to tear each\r\nother to pieces for nineteen years (1135-1154) without the least\r\nattempt on the part of their subjects to throw off their tyranny. There\r\nwas no English nation yet; each feudal magnate did what he pleased with\r\nhis own without fear of royal or popular vengeance, and for once in\r\nEnglish history, at any rate, the lords vindicated their independence.\r\nThe church was the only other body which profited by the strife; within\r\nits portals and its courts there was some law and order, some peace and\r\nrefuge from the worldly welter; and it seized the opportunity to\r\nbroaden its jurisdiction, magnify its law, exalt its privileges, and\r\nassert that to it belonged principally the right to elect and to depose\r\nsovereigns. Greater still would have been its services to civilization,\r\nhad it been able to assert a power of putting down the barons from\r\ntheir castles and raising the peasantry from their bondage.\r\n\r\nDeliverance could only come by royal power, and in Henry II, Matilda's\r\nson, Anjou gave England a greater king than Normandy had done in\r\nWilliam the Bastard. Although a foreigner, who ruled a vast continental\r\nempire and spent but a fraction of his days on this side of the\r\nChannel, he stands second to none of England's makers. He fashioned the\r\ngovernment which hammered together the framework of a national state.\r\nFirst, he gathered up such fragments of royal authority as survived the\r\nanarchy; then, with the conservative instincts and pretences of a\r\nradical, he looked about for precedents in the customs of his\r\ngrandfather, proclaiming his intention of restoring good old laws. This\r\nreaction brought him up against the encroachments of the church, and\r\nthe untoward incident of Becket's murder impaired the success of\r\nHenry's efforts to establish royal supremacy. But this supremacy must\r\nnot be exaggerated. Henry did not usurp ecclesiastical jurisdiction; he\r\nwanted to see that the clerical courts did their duty; he claimed the\r\npower of moving them in this direction; and he hoped to make the crown\r\nthe arbiter of disputes between the rival spiritual and temporal\r\njurisdictions, realizing that the only alternative to this supreme\r\nauthority was the arbitrament of war. He also contended that clergy who\r\nhad been unfrocked in the clerical courts for murder or other crimes\r\nshould be handed over as laymen to be further punished according to the\r\nlaw of the land, while Becket maintained that unfrocking was a\r\nsufficient penalty for the first offence, and that it required a second\r\nmurder to hang a former priest.\r\n\r\nNext, he sought to curb the barons. He instituted scutage, by which the\r\ngreat feudatories granted a money payment instead of bringing with them\r\nto the army hordes of their sub-tenants who might obey them rather than\r\nthe king; this enabled the king to hire mercenaries who respected him\r\nbut not the feudatories. He cashiered all the sheriffs at once, to\r\nexplode their pretensions to hereditary tenure of their office. By the\r\nassize of arms he called the mass of Englishmen to redress the military\r\nbalance between the barons and the crown. By other assizes he enabled\r\nthe owners and possessors of property to appeal to the protection of\r\nthe royal court of justice: instead of trial by battle they could\r\nsubmit their case to a jury of neighbours; and the weapons of the\r\nmilitary expert were thus superseded by the verdicts of peaceful\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThis method, which was extended to criminal as well as civil cases, of\r\nascertaining the truth and deciding disputes by means of juratores, men\r\nsworn to tell the truth impartially, involved a vast educational\r\nprocess. Hitherto men had regarded the ascertainment of truth as a\r\nsupernatural task, and they had abandoned it to Providence or the\r\npriests. Each party to a dispute had been required to produce oath-\r\nhelpers or compurgators and each compurgator's oath was valued\r\naccording to his property, just as the number of a man's votes is still\r\nproportioned to some extent to his possessions. But if, as commonly\r\nhappened, both parties produced the requisite oath-helpers, there was\r\nnothing for it but the ordeal by fire or water; the man who sank was\r\ninnocent, he who floated guilty; and the only rational element in the\r\nritual was its supervision by the priests, who knew something of their\r\nparishioners' character. Military tenants, however, preferred their\r\nprivilege of trial by battle. Now Henry began to teach men to rely upon\r\ntheir judgment; and by degrees a distinction was even made between\r\nmurder and homicide, which had hitherto been confounded because \"the\r\nthought of man shall not be tried, for the devil himself knoweth not\r\nthe thought of man.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out his judicial reforms, Henry developed the\r\n_curia regis_, or royal court of justice. That court had simply\r\nbeen the court of the king's barons corresponding to the court of his\r\ntenants which every feudal lord possessed. Its financial aspect had\r\nalready been specialized as the exchequer by the Norman kings, who had\r\nrealized that finance is the first essential of efficient government.\r\nFrom finance Henry I had gone on to the administration of justice,\r\nbecause _justitia magnum emolumentum_, the administration of\r\njustice is a great source of profit. Henry II's zeal for justice sprang\r\nfrom similar motives: the more justice he could draw from the feudal\r\ncourts to his own, the greater the revenue he would divert from his\r\nunruly barons into the royal exchequer. From the central stores of the\r\n_curia regis_ he dispensed a justice that was cheaper, more\r\nexpeditious, and more expert, than that provided by the local courts.\r\nHe threw open its doors to all except villeins, he transformed it from\r\nan occasional assembly of warlike barons into a regular court of\r\ntrained lawyers--mere servants of the royal household, the barons\r\ncalled them; and by means of justices in eyre he brought it into touch\r\nwith all localities in the kingdom, and convinced his people that there\r\nwas a king who meant to govern with their help.\r\n\r\nThese experts had a free hand as regards the law they administered. The\r\nold Anglo-Saxon customs which had done duty for law had degenerated\r\ninto antiquated formalities, varying in almost every shire and hundred,\r\nwhich were perforce ignored by Henry's judges because they were\r\nincomprehensible. So much as they understood and approved they blended\r\nwith principles drawn from the revived study of Roman law and with\r\nFrankish and Norman customs. The legal rules thus elaborated by the\r\nking's court were applied by the justices in eyre where-ever their\r\ncircuits took them, and became in time the common law of England,\r\ncommon because it admitted no local bars and no provincial prejudices.\r\nOne great stride had been taken in the making of the English nation,\r\nwhen the king's court, trespassing upon local popular and feudal\r\njurisdiction, dumped upon the Anglo-Saxon market the following among\r\nother foreign legal concepts--assize, circuit, suit, plaintiff,\r\ndefendant, maintenance, livery, possession, property, probate,\r\nrecovery, trespass, treason, felony, fine, coroner, court, inquest,\r\njudge, jury, justice, verdict, taxation, charter, liberty,\r\nrepresentation, parliament, and constitution. It is difficult to over-\r\nestimate the debt the English people owe to their powers of absorbing\r\nimports. The very watchwords of progress and catchwords of liberty,\r\nfrom the trial by jury which was ascribed to Alfred the Great to the\r\ncharter extorted from John, were alien immigrants. We call them alien\r\nbecause they were alien to the Anglo-Saxons; but they are the warp and\r\nwoof of English institutions, which are too great and too complex to\r\nhave sprung from purely insular sources.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fierce opposition of the barons, who rebelled in 1173,\r\nand of disputes with his fractious children which embittered his\r\nclosing years, Henry II had laid the foundations of national monarchy.\r\nBut in completing one part of the Norman Conquest, namely, the\r\nestablishment of royal supremacy over disorderly feudatories, he had\r\nmodified the other, the arbitrary rule of the barons over the subject\r\npeople. William had only conquered the people by the help of his\r\nbarons; Henry II only crushed the barons with the help of lower orders\r\nand of ministers raised from the ranks. It was left for his sons to\r\nalienate the support which he had enlisted, and to show that, if the\r\nfirst condition of progress was the restraint of the barons, the second\r\nwas the curbing of the crown. Their reigns illustrate the ineradicable\r\ndefect of arbitrary rule: a monarch of genius creates an efficient\r\ndespotism, and is allowed to create it, to deal with evils that yield\r\nto no milder treatment. His successors proceed to use that machinery\r\nfor personal ends. Richard I gilded his abuse of his father's power\r\nwith the glory of his crusade, and the end afforded a plausible\r\njustification for the means he adopted. But John cloaked his tyranny\r\nwith no specious pretences; his greed and violence spared no section of\r\nthe community, and forced all into a coalition which extorted from him\r\nthe Great Charter.\r\n\r\nThis famous document betrays its composite authorship; no section of\r\nthe community entered the coalition without something to gain, and none\r\nwent entirely unrewarded from Runnymede. But if Sir Henry Spelman\r\nintroduced feudalism into England, his contemporary, Chief-justice\r\nCoke, invented Magna Carta: and in view of the profound misconceptions\r\nwhich prevail with regard to its character, it is necessary to insist\r\nrather upon its reactionary than upon its reforming elements. The great\r\nsource of error lies in the change which is always insensibly, but\r\nsometimes completely, transforming the meaning of words. Generally the\r\nchange has been from the concrete to the abstract, because in their\r\nearlier stages of education men find it very difficult to grasp\r\nanything which is not concrete. The word \"liberty\" affords a good\r\nillustration: in 1215 a \"liberty\" was the possession by a definite\r\nperson or group of persons of very definite and tangible privileges,\r\nsuch as having a court of your own with its perquisites, or exemption\r\nfrom the duties of attending the public courts of the shire or hundred,\r\nof rendering the services or of paying the dues to which the majority\r\nwere liable. The value of a \"liberty\" was that through its enjoyment\r\nyou were not as other men; the barons would have eared little for\r\nliberties which they had to share with the common herd. To them liberty\r\nmeant privilege and monopoly; it was not a general right to be enjoyed\r\nin common. Now Magna Carta is a charter not of \"liberty,\" but of\r\n\"liberties\"; it guaranteed to each section of the coalition those\r\nspecial privileges which Henry II and his sons had threatened or taken\r\naway. Some of these liberties were dangerous obstacles to the common\r\nwelfare--for instance the \"liberty\" of every lord of the manor to try\r\nall suits relating to property and possession in his own manorial\r\ncourt, or to be punished by his fellow-barons instead of by the judges\r\nof the king's court. This was what the barons meant by their famous\r\ndemand in Magna Carta that every man should be judged by his peers;\r\nthey insisted that the royal judges were not their peers, but only\r\nservants of the crown, and their demands in these respects were\r\nreactionary proposals which might have been fatal to liberty as we\r\nconceive it.\r\n\r\nNor is there anything about trial by jury or \"no taxation without\r\nrepresentation\" in Magna Carta. What we mean by \"trial by jury\" was not\r\ndeveloped till long after 1215; there was still no national, but only\r\nclass taxation; and the great council, which was to give its assent to\r\nroyal demands for money, represented nobody but the tenants-in-chief of\r\nwhom it was composed. All that the barons meant by this clause was that\r\nthey, as feudal tenants-in-chief, were not to pay more than the\r\nordinary feudal dues. But they left to the king, and they reserved to\r\nthemselves, the right to tallage their villeins as arbitrarily as they\r\npleased; and even where they seem to be protecting the villeins, they\r\nare only preventing the king from levying such judicial fines from\r\ntheir villeins as would make it impossible for those villeins to render\r\ntheir services to the lords. It was to be no affair of the king or\r\nnation if a lord exacted the uttermost farthing from his own chattels;\r\nlegally, the villeins, who were the bulk of the nation, remained after\r\nMagna Carta, as before, in the position of a man's ox or horse to-day,\r\nexcept that there was no law for the prevention of cruelty to animals.\r\nFinally, the provision that no one was to be arrested until he had been\r\nconvicted would, if carried out, have made impossible the\r\nadministration of justice.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the provisions for the fixing of the court of common\r\npleas at Westminster, for standard weights and measures, for the\r\nadministration of law by men acquainted with English customs, and some\r\nothers were wholesome reforms. The first clause, guaranteeing that the\r\nchurch should be free from royal (not papal) encroachments, was sound\r\nenough when John was king, and the general restraint of his authority,\r\neven in the interests of the barons, was not an unmixed evil. But it is\r\nas absurd to think that John conceded modern liberty when he granted\r\nthe charter of medieval liberties, as to think that he permitted some\r\none to found a new religion when he licensed him to endow a new\r\nreligious house (_novam religionem_); and to regard Magna Carta as\r\na great popular achievement, when no vernacular version of it is known\r\nto have existed before the sixteenth century, and when it contains\r\nhardly a word or an idea of popular English origin, involves complete\r\nmisunderstanding of its meaning and a serious antedating of English\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nAt no time, indeed, did foreign influence appear more dominant in\r\nEnglish politics than during the generation which saw Richard I\r\nsurrender his kingdom to be held as a fief of the empire, and John\r\nsurrender it to be held as a temporal fief of the papacy; or when, in\r\nthe reign of Henry III, a papal legate, Gualo, administered England as\r\na province of the Papal States; when a foreign freebooter was sheriff\r\nof six English shires; and when aliens held in their hands the castles\r\nand keys of the kingdom. It was a dark hour which preceded the dawn of\r\nEnglish nationality, and so far there was no sign of English\r\nindignation at the bartering of England's independence. Resistance\r\nthere was, but it came from men who were only a degree less alien than\r\nthose whose domination they resented.\r\n\r\nYet a governing class, planted by Henry II, was striking root in\r\nEnglish soil and drawing nourishment and inspiration from English\r\nfeelings. It was reinforced by John's loss of Normandy, which compelled\r\nbi-national barons who held lands in both countries to choose between\r\ntheir French and English sovereigns; and those who preferred England\r\nbecame more English than they had been before. The French invasion of\r\nEngland, which followed John's repudiation of the charter, widened the\r\ncleavage; and there was something national, if little that was English,\r\nin the government of Hubert de Burgh, and still more in the naval\r\nvictory which Hubert and the men of the Cinque Ports won over the\r\nFrench in the Straits of Dover in 1217. But not a vestige of national\r\nfeeling animated Henry III; and for twenty-five wearisome years after\r\nhe had attained his majority he strove to govern England by means of\r\nalien relatives and dependents.\r\n\r\nThe opposition offered by the great council was baronial rather than\r\nnational; the revolt in which it ended was a revolt of the half-breeds\r\nrather than a revolt of the English; and the government they\r\nestablished in 1258 was merely a legalized form of baronial anarchy.\r\nBut there was this difference between the anarchy of Stephen's reign\r\nand that of Henry III's: now, when the foreigners fell out, the English\r\nbegan to come by their own. A sort of \"young England\" party fell foul\r\nof both the barons and the king; Simon de Montfort detached himself\r\nfrom the baronial brethren with whom he had acted, and boldly placed\r\nhimself at the head of a movement for securing England for the English.\r\nHe summoned representatives from cities and boroughs to sit side by\r\nside with greater and lesser barons in the great council of the realm,\r\nwhich now became an English parliament; and for the first time since\r\nthe Norman Conquest men of the subject race were called up to\r\ndeliberate on national affairs. It does not matter whether this was the\r\nstroke of a statesman's genius or the lucky improvisation of a party-\r\nleader. Simon fell, but his work remained; Prince Edward, who copied\r\nhis tactics at Evesham, copied his politics in 1275 and afterwards at\r\nWestminster; and under the first sovereign since the Norman Conquest\r\nwho bore an English name, the English people received their national\r\nlivery and the seisin of their inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEMERGENCE OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE\r\n\r\n1272-1485\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1265, simultaneously with the appearance of English townsfolk in\r\nparliament, an official document couched in the English tongue appeared\r\nlike a first peak above the subsiding flood of foreign language. When,\r\nthree generations back, Abbot Samson had preached English sermons, they\r\nwere noted as exceptions; but now the vernacular language of the\r\nsubject race was forcing its way into higher circles, and even into\r\nliterary use. The upper classes were learning English, and those whose\r\nnormal tongue was English were thrusting themselves into, or at any\r\nrate upon the notice of, the higher strata of society.\r\n\r\nThe two normal ranks of feudal society had in England naturally been\r\nFrench lords and English tillers of the soil; but commerce had never\r\naccommodated itself to this agricultural system, and the growth of\r\ntrade, of towns, of other forms of wealth than land, tended\r\nconcurrently to break down French and feudal domination. A large number\r\nof towns had been granted, or rather sold, charters by Richard I and\r\nJohn, not because those monarchs were interested in municipal\r\ndevelopment, but because they wanted money, and in their rights of\r\njurisdiction over towns on the royal domain they possessed a ready\r\nmarketable commodity. The body which had the means to pay the king's\r\nprice was generally the local merchant guild; and while these\r\ntransactions developed local government, they did not necessarily\r\npromote popular self-government, because the merchant guild was a\r\nwealthy oligarchical body, and it might exercise the jurisdiction it\r\nhad bought from the king in quite as narrow and harsh a spirit as he\r\nhad done. The consequent quarrels between town oligarchies and town\r\ndemocracies do not, however, justify the common assumption that there\r\nhad once been an era of municipal democracy which gradually gave way to\r\noligarchy and corruption. Nevertheless, these local bodies were\r\nEnglish, and legally their members had been villeins; and their\r\nexperience in local government prepared them for admittance to that\r\nshare in national government which the development of taxation made\r\nalmost necessary.\r\n\r\nHenry II's scheme of active and comprehensive administration, indeed,\r\nled by a natural sequence to the parliament of Edward I and further.\r\nThe more a government tries to do, the more taxation it must impose;\r\nand the broadening of the basis of taxation led gradually to the\r\nbroadening of the basis of representation, for taxation is the mother\r\nof representation. So long as real property only--that is to say, the\r\nownership of land--was taxed, the great council contained only the\r\ngreat landowners. But Henry II had found it necessary to tax personalty\r\nas well, both clerical and lay, and so by slow steps his successors in\r\nthe thirteenth century were driven to admit payers of taxes on\r\npersonalty to the great council. This representative system must not be\r\nregarded as a concession to a popular demand for national self-\r\ngovernment. When in 1791 a beneficent British parliament granted a\r\npopular assembly to the French Canadians, they looked askance and\r\nmuttered, \"_C'est une machine anglaise pour nous taxer_\"; and\r\nEdward I's people would have been justified in entertaining the\r\nsuspicion that it was their money he wanted, not their advice, and\r\nstill less their control. He wished taxes to be voted in the royal\r\npalace at Westminster, just as Henry I had insisted upon bishops being\r\nelected in the royal chapel. In the royal presence burgesses and\r\nknights of the shire would be more liberal with their constituents'\r\nmoney than those constituents would be with their own when there were\r\nneighbours to encourage resistance to a merely distant terror.\r\n\r\nThe representation people had enjoyed in the shire and hundred moots\r\nhad been a boon, not because it enabled a few privileged persons to\r\nattend, but because by their attendance the mass were enabled to stay\r\naway. If the lord or his steward would go in person, his attendance\r\nexempted all his tenants; if he would not, the reeve and four \"best\"\r\nmen from each township had to go. The \"best,\" moreover, were not chosen\r\nby election; the duty and burden was attached to the \"best\" holdings in\r\nthe township, and in the thirteenth century the sheriff was hard put to\r\nit to secure an adequate representation. This \"suit of court\" was, in\r\nfact, an obligatory service, and membership of parliament was long\r\nregarded in a similar light. Parliament did not clamour to be created;\r\nit was forced by an enlightened monarchy on a less enlightened people.\r\nA parliamentary \"summons\" had the imperative, minatory sound which now\r\nonly attaches to its police court use; and centuries later members were\r\noccasionally \"bound over\" to attend at Westminster, and prosecuted if\r\nthey failed. On one occasion the two knights for Oxfordshire fled the\r\ncountry on hearing of their election, and were proclaimed outlaws.\r\nMembers of parliament were, in fact, the scapegoats for the people, who\r\nwere all \"intended\" or understood to be present in parliament, but\r\nenjoyed the privilege of absence through representation. The greater\r\nbarons never secured this privilege; they had to come in person when\r\nsummoned, just as they had to serve in person when the king went to the\r\nwars. Gradually, of course, this attitude towards representation\r\nchanged as parliament grasped control of the public purse, and with it\r\nthe power of taxing its foes and sparing its friends. In other than\r\nfinancial matters it began to pay to be a member; and then it suited\r\nmagnates not only to come in person but to represent the people in the\r\nLower House, the social quality of which developed with the growth of\r\nits power. Only in very recent times has the House of Commons again\r\nincluded such representatives as these whose names are taken from the\r\nofficial returns for the parliaments of Edward I: John the Baker,\r\nWilliam the Tailor, Thomas the Summoner, Andrew the Piper, Walter the\r\nSpicer, Roger the Draper, Richard the Dyer, Henry the Butcher, Durant\r\nthe Cordwainer, John the Taverner, William the Red of Bideford, Citizen\r\nRichard (Ricardus Civis), and William the priest's son.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of emancipated villeins side by side with earls and\r\nprelates in the great council of the realm is the most significant fact\r\nof thirteenth-century English history. The people of England were\r\nbeginning to have a history which was not merely that of an alien\r\ngovernment; and their emergence is traceable not only in language,\r\nliterature, and local and national politics, but also in the art of\r\nwar. Edward I discovered in his Welsh wars that the long-bow was more\r\nefficient than the weapons of the knight; and his grandson won English\r\nvictories at Crecy and Poitiers with a weapon which was within the\r\nreach of the simple yeoman. The discovery of gunpowder and development\r\nof artillery soon proved as fatal to the feudal castle as the long-bow\r\nhad to the mailed knight; and when the feudal classes had lost their\r\npredominance in the art of war, and with it their monopoly of the power\r\nof protection, both the reasons for their existence and their capacity\r\nto maintain it were undermined. They took to trade, or, at least, to\r\nmoney-making out of land, like ordinary citizens, and thus entered into\r\na competition in which they had not the same assurance of success.\r\n\r\nEdward I's greatness consists mainly in his practical appreciation of\r\nthese tendencies. He was less original, but more fortunate in his\r\nopportunity, than Henry II. The time had come to set limits to the\r\nencroachments of feudalism and of the church, and Edward was able to\r\nimpose them because, unlike Henry II, he had the elements of a nation\r\nat his back. He was not able to sweep back these inroads, but he placed\r\nhigh-water marks along the frontiers of the state, and saw that they\r\nwere not transgressed. He inquired into the titles by which the great\r\nlords held those portions of sovereign authority which they called\r\ntheir liberties; but he could take no further action when Earl Warenne\r\nproduced a rusty sword as his effective title-deeds. He prohibited\r\nfurther subinfeudation by enacting that when an estate was sold, the\r\npurchaser should become the vassal of the vendor's lord and not of the\r\nvendor himself; and the social pyramid was thus rendered more stable,\r\nbecause its base was broadened instead of its height being increased.\r\nHe expelled the Jews as aliens, in spite of their usefulness to the\r\ncrown; he encouraged commerce by making profits from land liable to\r\nseizure for debt; and he defined the jurisdiction of the church, though\r\nhe had to leave it authority over all matters relating to marriage,\r\nwills, perjury, tithes, offences against the clergy, and ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings. He succeeded, however, in defiance of its opposition, in\r\nmaking church property liable to temporal taxation, and in passing a\r\nMortmain Act which prohibited the giving of land to monasteries or\r\nother corporations without the royal licence.\r\n\r\nBy thus increasing the national control over the church in England, he\r\nmade the church itself more national. It is sometimes implied that the\r\nchurch was equally national throughout the Middle Ages; but it is\r\ndifficult to speak of a national church before there was a nation, or\r\nto see that there was anything really English in a church ruled by\r\nLanfranc or Anselm, when there was not an Englishman on the bishops'\r\nbench, when the vast majority of Englishmen were legally incapable as\r\nvilleins of even taking orders in the church, and when the vernacular\r\nlanguage had been ousted from its services. But with the English nation\r\ngrew an English church; Grosseteste denounced the dominance of aliens\r\nin the church, while Simon de Montfort denounced it in the state. It\r\nwas, however, by secular authority that the English church was\r\ndifferentiated from the church abroad. It was the barons and not the\r\nbishops who had resisted the assimilation of English to Roman canon\r\nlaw, and it was Edward I, and not Archbishops Peckham and Winchilsey,\r\nwho defied Pope Boniface VIII. Archbishops, indeed, still placed their\r\nallegiance to the pope above that to their king.\r\n\r\nThe same sense of national and insular solidarity which led Edward to\r\ndefy the papacy also inspired his efforts to conquer Wales and\r\nScotland. Indeed, it was the refusal of the church to pay taxes in the\r\ncrisis of the Scottish war that provoked the quarrel with Boniface.\r\nBut, while Edward was successful in Wales, he encountered in Scotland a\r\ngrowing national spirit not altogether unlike that upon which Edward\r\nhimself relied in England. Nor was English patriotism sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to counteract the sectional feelings which took advantage of\r\nthe king's embarrassments. The king's necessity was his subjects'\r\nopportunity, and the Confirmation of Charters extorted from him in 1297\r\nstands, it is said, to the Great Charter of 1215 in the relation of\r\nsubstance to shadow, of achievement to promise. Edward, however, gave\r\naway much less than has often been imagined; he certainly did not\r\nabandon his right to tallage the towns, and the lustre of his motto,\r\n\"Keep troth,\" is tarnished by his application to the pope for\r\nabsolution from his promises. Still, he was a great king who served\r\nEngland well by his efforts to eliminate feudalism from the sphere of\r\ngovernment, and by his insistence on the doctrine that what touches all\r\nshould be approved by all. If to some catholic medievalists his reign\r\nseems a climax in the ascent of the English people, a climax to be\r\nfollowed by a prolonged recessional, it is because the national forces\r\nwhich he fostered were soon to make irreparable breaches in the\r\nsuperficial unity of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe miserable reign of his worthless successor, Edward II, illustrated\r\nthe importance of the personal factor in the monarchy, and also showed\r\nhow incapable the barons were of supplying the place of the feeblest\r\nking. Both parties failed because they took no account of the commons\r\nof England or of national interests. The leading baron, Thomas of\r\nLancaster, was executed; Edward II was murdered; and his assassin,\r\nMortimer, was put to death by Edward III, who grasped some of the\r\nsignificance of his grandfather's success and his father's failure. He\r\nfelt the national impulse, but he twisted it to serve a selfish and\r\ndynastic end. It must not, however, be supposed that the Hundred Years'\r\nWar originated in Edward's claim to the French throne; that claim was\r\ninvented to provide a colourable pretext for French feudatories to\r\nfight their sovereign in a war which was due to other causes. There was\r\nScotland, for instance, which France wished to save from Edward's\r\nclutches; there were the English possessions in Gascony and Guienne,\r\nfrom which the French king hoped to oust his rival; there were\r\nbickerings about the lordship of the Narrow Seas which England claimed\r\nunder Edward II; and there was the wool-market in the Netherlands which\r\nEngland wanted to control. The French nation, in fact, was feeling its\r\nfeet as well as the English; and a collision was only natural,\r\nespecially in Guienne and Gascony. Henry II had been as natural a\r\nsovereign in France as in England, because he was quite as much a\r\nFrenchman as an Englishman. But since then the kings of England had\r\ngrown English, and their dominion over soil which was growing French\r\nbecame more and more unnatural. The claim to the throne, however, gave\r\nthe struggle a bitter and fruitless character; and the national means,\r\nwhich Edward employed to maintain the war, only delayed its inevitably\r\nfutile end. It was supported by wealth derived from national commerce\r\nwith Flanders and Gascony; national armies were raised by enlistment to\r\nreplace the feudal levy; the national long-bow and not the feudal war-\r\nhorse won the battles of Crecy and Poitiers; and command of the sea\r\nsecured by a national navy enabled Edward to win the victory of Sluys\r\nand complete the reduction of Calais. War, moreover, required extra\r\nsupplies in unprecedented amounts, and they took the form of national\r\ntaxes, voted by the House of Commons, which supplemented and then\r\nsupplanted the feudal aids as the mainstay of royal finance.\r\n\r\nControl of these supplies brought the House of Commons into\r\nconstitutional prominence. It was no mere Third Estate after the\r\ncontinental model, for knights of the shire sat side by side with\r\nburgesses and citizens; and knights of the shire were the lesser\r\nbarons, who, receiving no special writ of summons, cast in their lot\r\nwith the Lower and not with the Upper House. Parliament had separated\r\ninto two Houses in the reign of Edward II--for Edward I's Model\r\nParliament had been a Single Chamber, though doubtless it voted by\r\nclasses--but the House of Commons represented the _communities_ of\r\nthe realm, and not its lower orders; or rather, it concentrated all\r\nthese communities--shires, cities, and boroughs--and welded them into a\r\nsingle community of the realm. It thus created a nucleus for national\r\nfeeling, which gradually cured the localism of early England and the\r\nsectionalism of feudal society; and it developed an _esprit de\r\ncorps_ which counteracted the influence of the court. The advantages\r\nwhich the crown may have hoped to secure by bringing representatives up\r\nto Westminster, and thus detaching them from their basis of local\r\nresistance, were frustrated by the solidarity and consistency which\r\ngrew up among members of parliament; and this growing national\r\nconsciousness supplanted local consciousness as the safeguard of\r\nconstitutional liberty.\r\n\r\nMost of the principles and expedients of representative government were\r\nadumbrated during this first flush of English nationalism, which has\r\nbeen called \"the age of the Commons.\" The petitions, by which alone\r\nparliament had been able to express its grievances, were turned into\r\nbills which the crown had to answer, not evasively, but by a thinly\r\nveiled \"yes\" or \"no.\" The granting of taxes was made conditional upon\r\nthe redress of grievances; the crown finally lost its right to tallage;\r\nand its powers of independent taxation were restricted to the levying\r\nof the \"ancient customs\" upon dry goods and wines. If it required more\r\nthan these and than the proceeds from the royal domains, royal\r\njurisdiction, and diminishing feudal aids, it had to apply to\r\nparliament. The expense of the Hundred Years' War rendered such\r\napplications frequent; and they were used by the Commons to increase\r\ntheir constitutional power. Attempts were made with varying success to\r\nassert that the ministers of the crown, both local and national, were\r\nresponsible to parliament, and that money-grants could only originate\r\nin the House of Commons, which might appropriate taxes to specific\r\nobjects and audit accounts so as to see that the appropriation was\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe growth of national feeling led also to limitations of papal power.\r\nEarly in Edward III's reign a claim was made that the king, in virtue\r\nof his anointing at coronation, could exercise spiritual jurisdiction,\r\nand the statutes of _Praemunire_ and _Provisors_ prohibited the\r\nexercise in England of the pope's powers of judicature and appointment\r\nto benefices without the royal licence, though royal connivance and\r\npopular acquiescence enabled the papacy to enjoy these privileges for\r\nnearly two centuries longer. National feeling was particularly inflamed\r\nagainst the papacy because the \"Babylonish captivity\" of the pope at\r\nAvignon made him appear an instrument in the hands of England's enemy,\r\nthe king of France; and that captivity was followed by the \"Great\r\nSchism,\" during which the quarrels of two, and then three, popes,\r\nsimultaneously claiming to be the only head of the church on earth,\r\nundermined respect for their office. These circumstances combined with\r\nthe wealth and corruption of the church to provoke the Lollard\r\nmovement, which was the ecclesiastical aspect of the democratic\r\ntendencies of the age.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking illustrations of popular development was the\r\ndemand for vernacular versions of the Scriptures, which Wycliffe met by\r\nhis translation of the Bible. At the same time Langland made literature\r\nfor the common people out of their common lot, a fact that can hardly\r\nbe understood unless we remember that villeins, although they might be\r\nfined by their lords for so doing, were sending their sons in\r\nincreasing numbers to schools, which were eventually thrown open to\r\nthem by the Statute of Labourers in 1406. The fact that Chaucer wrote\r\nin English shows how the popular tongue was becoming the language of\r\nthe court and educated classes. Town chronicles and the records of\r\nguilds and companies began to be written in English; legal proceedings\r\nare taken in the same tongue, though the law-reports continued to be\r\nwritten in French; and after a struggle between French and Latin, even\r\nthe laws are drawn up in English. That the church persisted, naturally\r\nenough, in its usage of catholic Latin, tended to increase its\r\nalienation from popular sympathies. Wycliffe represented this national\r\nfeeling when he appealed to national authority to reform a corrupt\r\nCatholic church, and when he finally denied that power of miraculous\r\ntransubstantiation, upon which ultimately was based the claim of the\r\npriesthood to special privileges and estimation. But his association\r\nwith the extreme forms of social agitation, which accompanied the\r\nLollard movement, is less clear.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of Edward III's reign the French war had produced a crop\r\nof disgrace, disorder, and discontent. Heavy taxation had not availed\r\nto retain the provinces ceded to England at the Treaty of Bretigny in\r\n1360, and hordes of disbanded soldiery exploited the social\r\ndisorganization produced by the Black Death; a third of the population\r\nwas swept away, and many villeins deserted their land to take up the\r\nmore attractive labour provided in towns by growing crafts and\r\nmanufactures. The lords tried by drastic measures to exact the services\r\nfrom villeins which there were not enough villeins to perform; and the\r\nimposition of a poll-tax was the signal for a comprehensive revolt of\r\ntown artisans and agricultural labourers in 1381. Its failure did not\r\nlong impede their emancipation, and the process of commuting services\r\nfor rent seems to have gone on more rapidly in the first half of the\r\nfifteenth than in the fourteenth century. But the passionate preaching\r\nof social equality which inflamed the minds of the insurgents produced\r\nno further results; in their existing condition of political education,\r\nthe peasant and artisan had perforce to be content with watching the\r\nstruggles of higher classes for power.\r\n\r\nRichard II, who had succeeded his grandfather in 1377, reaped the\r\nwhirlwind of Edward's sowing, not so much in the consequences of the\r\nwar as in the fruits of his peerage policy. The fourteenth century\r\nwhich nationalized the Commons, isolated the Lords; and the baronage\r\nshrank into the peerage. The word \"peer\" is not of English origin, nor\r\nhas it any real English meaning. Its etymological meaning of \"equal\"\r\ndoes not carry us very far; for a peer may be equal to anything. But\r\nthe peers, consisting as they do of archbishops, dukes, marquises,\r\nearls, viscounts, bishops, and barons, of peers who are lords of\r\nparliament and of peers who are neither lords of parliament nor\r\nelectors to the House of Commons, are not even equal to one another;\r\nand certainly they would deny that other people were equal to them. The\r\nuse of the word in its modern sense was borrowed from France in the\r\nfourteenth century; but in France it had a meaning which it could not\r\nhave in England. A peer in France claimed equality with the crown; that\r\nis to say, he was the ruler of one of the great fiefs which had been\r\nequal to the county of Paris when the count of Paris had been elected\r\nby his equals king of France. If the king of Wessex had been elected\r\nking of England by the other kings of the Heptarchy, and if those other\r\nkings had left successors, those successors might have claimed to be\r\npeers in a real sense. But they had no such pretensions; they were\r\nsimply greater barons, who had been the tenants-at-will of their king.\r\n\r\nThe barons, however, of William I or Henry II had been a large class of\r\ncomparatively small men, while the peers of Richard II were a small\r\nclass of big men. The mass of lesser barons had been separated from the\r\ngreater barons, and had been merged in the landed gentry who were\r\nrepresented by the knights of the shire in the House of Commons. The\r\ngreater barons were summoned by special and individual writs to the\r\nHouse of Lords; but there was nothing to fetter the crown in its issue\r\nof these writs. The fact that a great baron was summoned once, did not\r\nmean that he need be summoned again, and the summons of the father did\r\nnot involve the summons of his eldest son and successor. But gradually\r\nthe greater barons made this summons hereditary and robbed the crown of\r\nall discretion in the matter, though it was not till the reign of\r\nCharles I that the House of Lords decided in its own favour the\r\nquestion whether the crown had the power to refuse a writ of summons to\r\na peer who had once received one.\r\n\r\nWith this narrowing of the baronage, the barons lost the position they\r\nhad held in the thirteenth century as leaders of constitutional reform,\r\nand this part was played in the fourteenth century by the knights of\r\nthe shire. The greater barons devoted themselves rather to family than\r\nto national politics; and a system of breeding-in amalgamated many\r\nsmall houses into a few great ones. Thomas of Lancaster held five\r\nearldoms; he was the rival of Edward II, and might well be called a\r\npeer of the crown. Edward III, perceiving the menace of these great\r\nhouses to the crown, tried to capture them in its interests by means of\r\nmarriages between his sons and great heiresses. The Black Prince\r\nmarried the daughter of the Earl of Kent; Lionel became Earl of Ulster\r\nin the right of his wife; John of Gaunt married the heiress of\r\nLancaster and became Duke of Lancaster; Thomas of Woodstock married the\r\nheiress of the Bohuns, Earls of Essex and of Hereford; the descendants\r\nof Edmund, Duke of York, absorbed the great rival house of Mortimer;\r\nand other great houses were brought within the royal family circle. New\r\ntitles were imported from abroad to emphasize the new dignity of the\r\ngreater barons. Hitherto there had been barons only, and a few earls\r\nwhose dignity was an office; now by Edward III and Richard II there\r\nwere added dukes, marquises, and viscounts, and England might boast of\r\na peerage nearly, if not quite, as dangerous to the crown as that of\r\nFrance. For Edward's policy failed: instead of securing the great\r\nhouses in the interests of the crown, it degraded the crown to the\r\narena of peerage rivalries, and ultimately made it the prize of noble\r\nfactions.\r\n\r\nRichard II was not the man to deal with these over-mighty subjects. He\r\nmay perhaps be described as a \"New\" monarch born before his time. He\r\nhad some of the notions which the Tudors subsequently developed with\r\nsuccess; but he had none of their power and self-control, and he was\r\nfaced from his accession by a band of insubordinate uncles. Moreover,\r\nit needed the Wars of the Roses finally to convince the country of the\r\nmeaning of the independence of the peerage. Richard fell a victim to\r\nhis own impatience and their turbulence. Henry IV came to the throne as\r\nthe king of the peers, and hardly maintained his uneasy crown against\r\ntheir rival ambitions. The Commons, by constitutional reform, reduced\r\nalmost to insignificance a sovereignty which the Lords could not\r\noverthrow by rebellion; and by insisting that the king should \"live of\r\nhis own,\" without taxing the country, deprived him of the means of\r\norderly government. Their ideal constitution approached so nearly to\r\nanarchy that it is impossible not to suspect collusion between them and\r\nthe Lords. The church alone could Henry placate by passing his statute\r\nfor burning heretics.\r\n\r\nHenry V took refuge from this domestic imbroglio in a spirited foreign\r\npolicy, and put forward a claim more hollow than Edward III's to the\r\nthrone of France. There were temptations in the hopeless condition of\r\nFrench affairs which no one but a statesman could have resisted; Henry,\r\na brilliant soldier and a bigoted churchman, was anything but a\r\nstatesman; and the value of his churchmanship may be gauged from the\r\nfact that he assumed the insolence of a crusader against a nation more\r\ncatholic than his own. He won a deplorably splendid victory at\r\nAgincourt, married the French king's daughter, and was crowned king of\r\nFrance. Then he died in 1422, leaving a son nine months old, with\r\nnothing but success in the impossible task of subduing France to save\r\nthe Lancastrian dynasty from the nemesis of vaulting ambition abroad\r\nand problems shelved at home.\r\n\r\nStep by step the curse of war came home to roost. Henry V's abler but\r\nless brilliant brother, Bedford, stemmed till his death the rising tide\r\nof English faction and French patriotism. Then the expulsion of the\r\nEnglish from France began, and a long tale of failure discredited the\r\ngovernment. The nation had spirit enough to resent defeat, but not the\r\nmeans to avoid it; and strife between the peace party and the war party\r\nin the government resolved itself into a faction fight between\r\nLancastrians and Yorkists. The consequent impotence of the government\r\nprovoked a bastard feudal anarchy, maintained by hirelings instead of\r\nliegemen. Local factions fought with no respect for the law, which was\r\nadministered, if at all, in the interests of one or other of the great\r\nfactions at court; and these two great factions fostered and organized\r\nlocal parties till the strife between them grew into the Wars of the\r\nRoses.\r\n\r\nThose wars are perhaps the most puzzling episode in English history.\r\nThe action of an organized government is comparatively easy to follow,\r\nbut it is impossible to analyze the politics of anarchy. The Yorkist\r\nclaim to the throne was not the cause of the war; it was, like Edward\r\nIII's claim to the throne of France, merely a matter of tactics, and\r\nwas only played as a trump card. No political, constitutional, or\r\nreligious principle was at stake; and the more peaceable, organized\r\nparts of the community took little share in the struggle. No great\r\nbattle was fought south of the Thames, and no town stood a siege. It\r\nlooks as though the great military and feudal specialists, whose power\r\nlay principally on the Borders, were engaged in a final internecine\r\nstruggle for the control of England, in somewhat the same way as the\r\nOstmark or East Border of the Empire became Austria, and the Nordmark\r\nor North Border became Prussia, and in turn dominated Germany.\r\nCertainly the defeat of these forces was a victory for southern and\r\neastern England, and for the commercial and maritime interests on which\r\nits growing wealth and prosperity hung; and the most important point in\r\nthe wars was not the triumph of Edward IV over the Lancastrians in\r\n1461, but his triumph over Warwick, the kingmaker, ten years later. The\r\nNew Monarchy has been plausibly dated from 1471; but Edward IV had not\r\nthe political genius to work out in detailed administration the results\r\nof the victory which he owed to his military skill, and Richard III,\r\nwho possessed the ability, made himself impossible as a king by the\r\ncrimes he had to commit in order to reach the throne. The\r\nreconstruction of English government on a broader and firmer national\r\nbasis was therefore left to Henry VII and the House of Tudor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF NATIONALISM\r\n\r\n1485-1603\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland had passed through the Middle Ages without giving any sign of\r\nthe greatness which awaited its future development. Edward III and\r\nHenry V had won temporary renown in France, but English sovereigns had\r\nfailed to subjugate the smaller countries of Scotland and Ireland,\r\nwhich were more immediately their concern. Wycliffe and Chaucer, with\r\nperhaps Roger Bacon, are the only English names of first importance in\r\nthe realms of medieval thought and literature, unless we put Bede (673-\r\n735) in the Middle Ages; for insular genius does not seem to have\r\nflourished under ecumenical inspiration; and even Wycliffe and Chaucer\r\nmay be claimed as products of the national rather than of the catholic\r\nspirit. But with the transition from medieval to modern history, the\r\nconditions were altered in England's favour. The geographical expansion\r\nof Europe made the outposts of the Old World the _entrepôts_ for\r\nthe New; the development of navigation and sea-power changed the ocean\r\nfrom the limit into the link of empires; and the growth of industry and\r\ncommerce revolutionized the social and financial foundations of power.\r\nNational states were forming; the state which could best adapt itself\r\nto these changed and changing conditions would outdistance its rivals;\r\nand its capacity to adapt itself to them would largely depend on the\r\nstrength and flexibility of its national organization. It was the\r\nachievement of the New Monarchy to fashion this organization, and to\r\nrescue the country from an anarchy which had already given other powers\r\nthe start in the race and promised little success for England.\r\n\r\nHenry VII had to begin in a quiet, unostentatious way with very scanty\r\nmaterials. With a bad title and many pretenders, with an evil heritage\r\nof social disorder, he must have been sorely tempted to indulge in the\r\nheroics of Henry V. He followed a sounder business policy, and his\r\nreign is dull, because he gave peace and prosperity at home without\r\nfighting a battle abroad. His foreign policy was dictated by insular\r\ninterests regardless of personal glory; and the security of his kingdom\r\nand the trade of his people were the aims of all his treaties with\r\nother powers. At home he carefully depressed the over-mighty subjects\r\nwho had made the Wars of the Roses; he kept down their number with such\r\nsuccess that he left behind him only one English duke and one English\r\nmarquis; he limited their retainers, and restrained by means of the\r\nStar Chamber their habits of maintaining lawbreakers, packing juries,\r\nand intimidating judges. By a careful distribution of fines and\r\nbenevolences he filled his exchequer without taxing the mass of his\r\npeople; and by giving office to ecclesiastics and men of humble origin\r\nhe both secured cheaper and more efficient administration, and\r\nestablished a check upon feudal influence. He was determined that no\r\nEnglishman should build any castle walls over which the English king\r\ncould not look, and that, as far as possible, no private person should\r\npossess a franchise in which the king's writ did not run. He left to\r\nhis son, Henry VIII, a stable throne and a united kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe first half of Henry VIII's reign left little mark on English\r\nhistory. Wolsey played a brilliant but essentially futile part on the\r\ndiplomatic stage, where the rivalry and balance of forces between the\r\nEmperor Charles V and Francis I of France helped him to pose as the\r\narbiter of Christendom. But he obtained no permanent national gains;\r\nand the final result of his foreign policy was to make the emperor\r\nmaster of the papacy at the moment when Henry wanted the pope to annul\r\nhis marriage with the emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. Henry\r\ndesired a son to succeed him and to prevent the recurrence of dynastic\r\nwars; he had only a daughter, Mary, and no woman had yet ruled or\r\nreigned in England. The death of all his male children by Catherine\r\nconvinced him that his marriage with his deceased brother Arthur's\r\nwidow was invalid; and his passion for Anne Boleyn added zest to his\r\nsuit for a divorce. The pope could not afford to quarrel with Charles\r\nV, who cared little, indeed, for the cause of his aunt, but much for\r\nhis cousin Mary's claim to the English throne; and in 1529 Henry began\r\nthe process, completed in the acts of Annates, Appeals, and Supremacy,\r\nby which England severed its connexion with Rome, and the king became\r\nhead of an English church.\r\n\r\nIt is irrational to pretend that so durable an achievement was due to\r\nso transient a cause as Henry's passion for Anne Boleyn or desire for a\r\nson; vaster, older, and more deeply seated forces were at work. In one\r\nsense the breach was simply the ecclesiastical consummation of the\r\nforces which had long been making for national independence, and the\r\nreligious complement of the changes which had emancipated the English\r\nstate, language, and literature from foreign control.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic church naturally resisted its disintegration, and the\r\nseverance was effected by the secular arms of parliament and the crown.\r\nThe nationalism of the English church was the result rather than the\r\ncause of the breach with Rome, and its national characteristics--\r\nsupreme governance by the king, the disappearance of cosmopolitan\r\nreligious orders, the parliamentary authorization of services in the\r\nvernacular, of English books of Common Prayer, of English versions of\r\nthe Bible, and of the Thirty-nine Articles--were all imposed by\r\nparliament after, and not adopted by the church before, the separation.\r\nThere were, indeed, no legal means by which the church in England could\r\nhave accomplished these things for itself; there were the convocations\r\nof Canterbury and York, but these were two subordinate provinces of the\r\nCatholic church; and, whatever may be said for provincial autonomy in\r\nthe medieval church, the only marks of national autonomy were stamped\r\nupon it by the state. York was more independent of Canterbury than\r\nCanterbury was of Rome; and the unity as well as the independence of\r\nthe national church depends upon the common subjection of both its\r\nprovinces to the crown.  This predominance of state over church was a\r\nconsequence of its nationalization; for where the boundaries of the two\r\ncoincide, the state generally has the upper hand. The papacy was only\r\nmade possible by the fall of the Western Empire; in the Eastern Empire\r\nthe state, so long as it survived, controlled the church; and the\r\nindependence of the medieval church was due to its catholicity, while\r\nthe state at best was only national. It was in defence of the\r\ncatholicity, as opposed to the nationalism, of the church that More and\r\nFisher went to the scaffold in 1535, and nearly the whole bench of\r\nbishops was deprived in 1559. Henry VIII and Elizabeth were bent on\r\ndestroying the medieval discord between the Catholic church and the\r\nnational state. Catholicity had broken down in the state with the\r\ndecline of the empire, and was fast breaking down in the church;\r\nnationalism had triumphed in the state, and was now to triumph in the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the Reformation was the greatest achievement of the\r\nnational state, which emerged from the struggle with no rival for its\r\nomnicompetent authority. Its despotism was the predominant\r\ncharacteristic of the century, for the national state successfully rid\r\nitself of the checks imposed, on the one hand by the Catholic church,\r\nand on the other by the feudal franchises. But the supremacy was not\r\nexclusively royal; parliament was the partner and accomplice of the\r\ncrown. It was the weapon which the Tudors employed to pass Acts of\r\nAttainder against feudal magnates and Acts of Supremacy against the\r\nchurch; and men complained that despotic authority had merely been\r\ntransferred from the pope to the king, and infallibility from the\r\nchurch to parliament. \"Parliament,\" wrote an Elizabethan statesman,\r\n\"establisheth forms of religion....\"\r\n\r\nBut while Englishmen on the whole were pretty well agreed that foreign\r\njurisdiction was to be eliminated, and that Englishmen were to be\r\norganized in one body, secular and spiritual, which might be called\r\nindifferently a state-church or a church-state, there was much more\r\ndifference of opinion with regard to its theological complexion. It\r\nmight be Catholic or it might be Protestant in doctrine; and it was far\r\nmore difficult to solve this religious problem than to effect the\r\nseverance from Rome. There were, indeed, many currents in the stream,\r\nsome of them cross-currents, some political, some religious, but all\r\nmingling imperceptibly with one another. The revolt of the nation\r\nagainst a foreign authority is the most easily distinguished of these\r\ntendencies; another is the revolt of the laity against the clerical\r\nspecialist. The church, it must be remembered, was often regarded as\r\nconsisting not of the whole body of the faithful, but simply of the\r\nclergy, who continued to claim a monopoly of its privileges after they\r\nhad ceased to enjoy a monopoly of its intelligence and virtue. The\r\nRenaissance had been a new birth of secular learning, not a revival of\r\nclerical learning. Others besides the clergy could now read and write\r\nand understand; town chronicles took the place of monastic chronicles,\r\nsecular poets of divines; and a middle class that was growing in wealth\r\nand intelligence grew also as impatient of clerical as it had done of\r\nmilitary specialists. The essential feature of the reformed services\r\nwas that they were compiled in the common tongue and not in the Latin\r\nof ecclesiastical experts, that a Book of _Common_ Prayer was used,\r\nthat congregational psalm-singing replaced the sacerdotal solo,\r\nand a communion was substituted for a priestly miracle. Religious\r\nservice was to be something rendered by the people themselves, and not\r\nperformed for their benefit by the priest.\r\n\r\nIndividual participation and private judgment in religion were indeed\r\nthe essence of Protestantism, which was largely the religious aspect of\r\nthe revolt of the individual against the collectivism of the Middle\r\nAges. The control exercised by the church had, however, been less the\r\nexpression of the general will than the discipline by authority of\r\nmasses too illiterate to think for themselves. Attendance at public\r\nworship would necessarily be their only form of devotion. But the\r\ngeneral emancipation of servile classes and spread of intelligence by\r\nthe Renaissance had led to a demand for vernacular versions of the\r\nScriptures and to a great deal of private and family religious\r\nexercise, without which there could have been no Protestant\r\nReformation. Lollardy, which was a violent outburst of this domestic\r\npiety, was never completely suppressed; and it flamed out afresh when\r\nonce political reasons, which had led the Lancastrians to support the\r\nchurch, induced the Tudors to attack it.\r\n\r\nMost spiritual of all the factors in the Reformation was the slow and\r\npartial emancipation of men's minds from the materialism of the Middle\r\nAges. It may seem bold, in face of the vast secularization of church\r\nproperty and other things in the sixteenth century, to speak of\r\nemancipation from materialism. Nevertheless, there was a distinct step\r\nin the progress of men's minds from that primitive condition of\r\nintelligence in which they can only grasp material symbols of the real\r\nconception. Rudimentary jurisprudence had confessed its inability to\r\npenetrate men's thoughts and differentiate their actions according to\r\ntheir motives; there had been a time when possession had seemed more\r\nreal than property, and when the transference of a right was\r\nincomprehensible without the transference of its concrete symbols.\r\nThere could be no gift without its manual conveyance, no marriage\r\nwithout a ring, no king without a coronation. Many of these material\r\nswaddling-clothes remain and have their value. A national flag\r\nstimulates loyalty, gold lace helps the cause of discipline. Bishop\r\nGardiner, in the sixteenth century, defended images on the ground that\r\nthey were documents all could read, while few could read the\r\nScriptures. To unimaginative men there could be no priest without\r\nvestments, no worship without ritual, no communion of the Spirit\r\nwithout the presence of the Body, no temple not made with hands, no God\r\nwithout an image. To break the image, to abolish the vestments and the\r\nritual, to deny the transubstantiation, was to destroy the religion and\r\nreverence of the masses, who could only grasp matter and worship with\r\ntheir senses.\r\n\r\nProtestantism was, therefore, not a popular religion, and to thousands\r\nof educated men it did not appeal. Few people are so immaterialistic\r\nthat they can dispense with symbols; many can idealize symbols in which\r\nothers see nothing but matter; and only those devoid of artistic\r\nperception deny the religious value of sculpture, painting, and music.\r\nProtestantism might be an ideal religion if men were compounded of pure\r\nreason; being what they were, many adopted it because they were\r\nimpervious to artistic influence or impatient of spiritual discipline.\r\nIt will hardly do to divide the nation into intelligent Protestants and\r\nilliterate Catholics: the point is that the somewhat crude symbolism\r\nwhich had satisfied the cravings of the average man had ceased to be\r\nsufficient for his newer intelligent needs; he demanded either a higher\r\nsymbolism or else as little as possible. Some felt the symbol a help,\r\nothers felt it a hindrance to the realization of the ideal; so some men\r\ncan see better with, others without, spectacles, but that fact would\r\nhardly justify their abolition.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII confined his sympathies to the revolt of the nation against\r\nRome and the revolt of the laity against the priests. The former he\r\nused to make himself Supreme Head of the church, the latter to subdue\r\nconvocation and despoil the monasteries. All civilized countries have\r\nfound it expedient sooner or later to follow his example with regard to\r\nmonastic wealth; and there can be little doubt that the withholding of\r\nso much land and so many men and women from productive purposes impeded\r\nthe material prosperity of the nation. But the devotion of the proceeds\r\nto the foundation of private families, instead of to educational\r\nendowment, can only be explained and not excused by the exigencies of\r\npolitical tactics. His real services were political, not religious. He\r\ntaught England a good deal of her insular confidence; he proclaimed the\r\nindivisible and indisputable sovereignty of the crown in parliament; he\r\nnot only incorporated Wales and the county palatine of Chester with\r\nEngland, and began the English re-organization of Ireland, but he\r\nunited England north with England south of the Humber, and consolidated\r\nthe Borders, those frayed edges of the national state. He carried on\r\nthe work of Henry II and Edward I, and by subduing rival jurisdictions\r\nstamped a final unity on the framework of the government.\r\n\r\nThe advisers of Edward VI embarked on the more difficult task of making\r\nthis organization Protestant; and the haste with which they, and\r\nespecially Northumberland, pressed on the change provoked first\r\nrebellion in 1549 and then reaction under Mary. They were also\r\nconfronted with social discontent arising out of the general\r\nsubstitution of competition for custom as the ruling economic\r\nprinciple. Capital amassed in trade was applied to land, which began to\r\nbe treated as a source of money, not a source of men. Land held in\r\nseveralty was found more profitable than land held in common, large\r\nestates than small holdings, and wool-growing than corn-growing. Small\r\ntenants were evicted, small holdings consolidated, commons enclosed,\r\nand arable land converted to pasture. The mass of the agricultural\r\npopulation became mere labourers without rights of property on the soil\r\nthey tilled; thousands lost employment and swelled the ranks of sturdy\r\nbeggars; and sporadic disorder came to a head in Kett's rebellion in\r\nNorfolk in 1549, which was with difficulty suppressed. But even this\r\nhighhanded expropriation of peasants by their landlords stimulated\r\nnational development. It created a vagrant mobile mass of labour, which\r\nhelped to meet the demands of new industrial markets and to feed\r\nEnglish oversea enterprise. A race that sticks like a limpet to the\r\nsoil may be happy but cannot be great; and the ejection of English\r\npeasants from their homesteads saved them from the reproach of home-\r\nkeeping youths that they have ever homely wits.\r\n\r\nMary's reign, however, checked the national impulse towards expansion,\r\nand thrust England for the moment back into the Middle Ages. First she\r\nput herself and her kingdom under the aegis of Spain, to which in heart\r\nand mind she belonged, by marrying Philip II. Then with his assistance\r\nshe restored the papal jurisdiction, and England surrendered its\r\nnational independence. Those who repudiated their foreign jurisdiction\r\nwere naturally treated as contumacious by the papal courts in England\r\nand sent to the stake; and English adventurers were prohibited, in the\r\ninterests of Spain and Portugal, from trespassing in the New World.\r\nFinally England was plunged into war with France in order to help\r\nPhilip, and lost Calais for its pains. Mary's reign showed that in a\r\nsovereign good intentions and upright conversation exaggerate rather\r\nthan redeem the evil effects of bigotry and blindness. She had,\r\nhowever, made it impossible for any successor to perpetuate in England\r\nthe Roman jurisdiction and the patronage of Spain.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was a sovereign more purely British in blood than any other\r\nsince the Norman Conquest; and to her appropriately fell the task of\r\ncompleting her country's national independence. Henry VIII's Act of\r\nSupremacy and Edward VI's of Uniformity were restored with some\r\nmodifications, in spite of the opposition of the Catholic bishops, who\r\ncontended that a nation had no right to deal independently with\r\necclesiastical matters, and suffered deprivation and imprisonment\r\nrather than recognize a schismatic national church. Elizabeth rejected\r\nPhilip's offers of marriage and paid no heed to his counsels of state.\r\nShe scandalized Catholic Europe by assisting the revolted Scots to\r\nexpel the French from North Britain; and revenged the contempt, in\r\nwhich England had been held in Mary's reign, by supporting with\r\nimpunity the Dutch against Philip II and the Huguenots against the king\r\nof France. She concealed her aggressions with diplomatic artifice and\r\ncaution; but at heart she was with her people, who lost no opportunity,\r\nin their new-found confidence, of plundering and insulting the Catholic\r\npowers in their way.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing success of England amid the novel conditions of\r\nnational rivalry requires some attempt at explanation. It seems to have\r\nbeen due to the singular flexibility of the English character and\r\nnational system, and to the consequent ease with which they adapted\r\nthemselves to changing environment. Indeed, whatever may be the case at\r\npresent, a survey of English history suggests that the conventional\r\nstolidity ascribed to John Bull was the least obvious of his\r\ncharacteristics; and even to-day the only people who never change their\r\nmind at general elections are the mercurial Celts. Certainly England\r\nhas never suffered from that rigidity of social system which has\r\nhampered in the past the adaptability of its rivals. Even in feudal\r\ntimes there was little law about status; and when the customary\r\narrangement of society in two agricultural classes of landlord and\r\ntenant was modified by commerce, capitalism, and competition, nobles\r\nadapted themselves to the change with some facility. They took to\r\nsheep-farming and commercial speculations, just as later on they took\r\nto keeping dairy-shops. It is the smallness rather than the source of\r\nhis profits that excites social prejudice against the shopkeeper in\r\nEngland. On the Continent, however, class feeling prevented the\r\ngoverning classes from participating in the expansion of commerce.\r\nGerman barons, for instance, often with only a few florins a year\r\nincome, could not supplement it by trade; all they could do was to rob\r\nthe traders, robbery being a thoroughly genteel occupation. Hence\r\nforeign governments were, as a rule, less alive and less responsive to\r\nthe commercial interests of their subjects. Philip II trampled on\r\ncommercial opinion in a way no English sovereign could have done.\r\nIndeed, complaints were raised in England at the extent to which the\r\ncommercial classes had the ear of parliament and the crown; since the\r\naccession of Henry VIII, it was said in 1559, they had succeeded by\r\ntheir secret influence in procuring the rejection of every bill they\r\nthought injurious to their interests.\r\n\r\nThere was no feeling of caste to obstruct the efficiency of English\r\nadministration. The nobility were separated from the nation by no fixed\r\nline; there never was in England a nobility of blood, for all the sons\r\nof a noble except the eldest were commoners. And while they were\r\nconstantly sinking into the mass of the nation, commoners frequently\r\nrose to the rank of nobility. Before the end of the fourteenth century\r\nwealth derived from trade had become an avenue to the House of Lords.\r\nThe justices of the peace, on whom the Tudors relied for local\r\nadministration, were largely descended from successful city men who\r\nhad, like the Walsinghams, planted themselves out in the country; and\r\nElizabeth herself was great-great-granddaughter of a London mayor. This\r\nsocial elasticity enabled the government to avail itself of able men of\r\nall classes, and the efficiency of Tudor administration was mainly due\r\nto these recruits, whose genius would have been elsewhere neglected.\r\nFurther, it provided the government with agents peculiarly fitted by\r\ntraining and knowledge to deal with the commercial problems which were\r\nbeginning to fill so large a sphere in politics; and finally, it\r\nrendered the government singularly responsive to the public opinion of\r\nthe classes upon whose welfare depended the expansion of England.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen likewise took to the sea, when the sea became all-important,\r\nas readily as they took to trade. English command of the Narrow Seas\r\nhad laid France open to the invasions of Edward III and Henry V, and\r\nhad checked the tide of French reconquest before the walls of Calais.\r\nEnglish piracy in the Channel was notorious in the fifteenth century,\r\nand in the sixteenth it attained patriotic proportions. Henry VII had\r\nencouraged Cabot's voyage to Newfoundland, but the papal partition of\r\nnew-found lands between Spain and Portugal barred to England the door\r\nof legitimate, peaceful expansion; and there can be little doubt that\r\nthis prohibition made many converts to Protestantism among English\r\nseafaring folk. Even Mary could not prevent her subjects from preying\r\non Spanish and Portuguese commerce and colonies; and with Elizabeth's\r\naccession preying grew into a national pastime. Hawkins broke into\r\nSpanish monopoly in the West Indies, Drake burst into their Pacific\r\npreserves, and circumvented their defences; and a host of followers\r\nplundered nearly every Spanish and Portuguese colony.\r\n\r\nAt last Philip was provoked into a naval war for which the English were\r\nand he was not prepared. Spanish rigidity embraced the Spanish marine\r\nas well as Spanish theology. Clinging to Mediterranean and medieval\r\ntraditions, Spain had failed to realize the conditions of sea-power or\r\nnaval tactics. England, on the other hand, had, largely under the\r\ninspiration of Henry VIII, adapted its navy to oceanic purposes. A type\r\nof vessel had been evolved capable of crossing the ocean, of\r\nmanoeuvring and of fighting under sail; to Drake the ship had become\r\nthe fighting unit, to the Duke of Medina Sidonia a ship was simply a\r\nvehicle for soldiers, and a sea-fight was simply a land-fight on sea.\r\nThe crowning illustration of Spain's incapacity to adapt itself to new\r\nconditions is perhaps the fact that only a marquis or duke could be\r\nmade a Spanish admiral.\r\n\r\nEngland had disposed of similar claims to political and military\r\nauthority in 1569, when medieval feudalism made its last bid for the\r\ncontrol of English policy. For ten years Elizabeth had been guided by\r\nSir William Cecil, a typical \"new man\" of Tudor making, who hoped to\r\nwean the common people from dependence upon their lords, and to\r\ncomplete the destruction of feudal privileges which still impeded the\r\naction of national sovereignty. The flight of Mary Queen of Scots into\r\nEngland in 1568 provided a focus for noble discontent with Cecil's\r\nrule, and the northern earls rebelled in 1569. The rebellion was easily\r\nsuppressed, but its failure did not deter the Duke of Norfolk, the\r\nearls' accomplice, from joining Ridolfi's plot with similar ends. He\r\nwas brought to the block in 1572, and in him perished the last\r\nsurviving English duke. For more than half a century England had to do\r\nits best--defeat the Spanish Armada, conquer Ireland, circumnavigate\r\nthe globe, lay the foundations of empire, produce the literature of the\r\nElizabethan age--without any ducal assistance. It was left for James I,\r\nwho also created the rank of baronet in order to sell the title (1611),\r\nto revive the glories of ducal dignity in the persons of Ludovic\r\nStuart, Duke of Richmond, and George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham\r\n(1623).\r\n\r\nCecil's drastic methods of dealing with the opposition lords left the\r\ndoor of government open to men like Walsingham, who were determined to\r\ngive full play to the new forces in English politics. Discontented\r\nreactionaries were reduced to impotent silence, or driven abroad to\r\nside openly with the enemy. Pius V's bull excommunicating and deposing\r\nElizabeth (1570) shattered in a similar way the old Catholic party. The\r\nmajority acquiesced in the national religion; the extremists fled to\r\nbecome conspirators at foreign courts or Jesuit and missionary priests.\r\nThe antagonism between England and Spain in the New World did more,\r\nperhaps, than Spanish Catholicism to make Philip the natural patron of\r\nthese exiles and of their plots against the English government; and as\r\nSpain and England drew apart, England and France drew together. In 1572\r\na defensive alliance was formed between them, and there seemed a\r\nprospect of their co-operation to drive the Spaniards out of the\r\nNetherlands. But Catholic France resented this Huguenot policy, and the\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew put a violent end to the scheme, while\r\nElizabeth and Philip patched up a truce for some years. There could,\r\nhowever, be no permanent compromise, on the one hand, between Spanish\r\nexclusiveness and the determination of Englishmen to force open the\r\ndoor of the New World and, on the other, between English nationalism\r\nand the papal resolve to reconquer England for the Catholic church.\r\nPhilip made common cause with the papacy and with its British champion,\r\nMary Queen of Scots, while Englishmen made common cause with Philip's\r\nrevolted subjects in the Netherlands. The acquisition of Portugal, its\r\nfleet, and its colonial empire by Philip in 1580, the assassination of\r\nWilliam of Orange in 1584, and the victories of Alexander of Parma in\r\nthe Netherlands forced Elizabeth into decisive action. The Dutch were\r\ntaken under her wing, a national expedition led by Drake paralyzed\r\nSpanish dominion in the West Indies in 1585 and then destroyed Philip's\r\nfleet at Cadiz in 1587, and the Queen of Scots was executed.\r\n\r\nAt last Philip attempted a tardy retaliation with the Spanish Armada.\r\nIts naval inefficiency was matched by political miscalculations. Philip\r\nnever imagined that a united England could be conquered; but he\r\nlaboured under the delusion, spread by English Catholic exiles, that\r\nthe majority of the English people only awaited a signal to rise\r\nagainst their queen. When this delusion was exploded and the naval\r\nincompetence of Spain exposed, his dreams of conquest vanished, and he\r\ncontinued the war merely in the hope of securing guarantees against\r\nEnglish interference in the New World, in the Netherlands, and in\r\nFrance, where he was helping the Catholic League to keep Henry of\r\nNavarre off the French throne. Ireland, however, was his most promising\r\nsphere of operations. There religious and racial hostility to the\r\nEnglish was fusing discordant Irish septs into an Irish nation, and the\r\nappearance of a Spanish expedition was the signal for something like a\r\nnational revolt. England had not been rich enough in men or money to\r\ngive Ireland a really efficient government, but the extent of the\r\ndanger in 1598-1602 stimulated an effort which resulted in the first\r\nreal conquest of Ireland; and Englishmen set themselves to do the same\r\nwork, with about the same amount of benevolence, for the Irish that the\r\nNormans had done for the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nSo far Tudor monarchy had proved an adequate exponent of English\r\nnationalism, because nationalism had been concerned mainly with the\r\nexternal problems of defence against foreign powers and jurisdictions.\r\nBut with the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the urgency of those\r\nproblems passed away; and during the last fifteen years of Elizabeth's\r\nreign national feelings found increasing expression in parliament and\r\nin popular literature. In all forms of literature, but especially in\r\nthe Shakespearean drama, the keynote of the age was the evolution of a\r\nnational spirit and technique, and their emancipation from the\r\ninfluence of classical and foreign models. In domestic politics a rift\r\nappeared between the monarchy and the nation. For one thing the\r\nalliance, forged by Henry VIII between the crown and parliament,\r\nagainst the church, was being changed into an alliance between the\r\ncrown and church against the parliament, because parliament was\r\nbeginning to give expression to democratic ideas of government in state\r\nand church which threatened the principle of personal rule common to\r\nmonarchy and to episcopacy. \"No Bishop, no King,\" was a shrewd aphorism\r\nof James I, which was in the making before he reached the throne. In\r\nother respects--such as monopolies, the power of the crown to levy\r\nindirect taxation without consent of parliament, to imprison subjects\r\nwithout cause shown, and to tamper with the privileges of the House of\r\nCommons--the royal prerogative was called in question. Popular\r\nacquiescence in strong personal monarchy was beginning to waver now\r\nthat the need for it was disappearing with the growing security of\r\nnational independence. People could afford the luxuries of liberty and\r\nparty strife when their national existence was placed beyond the reach\r\nof danger; and a national demand for a greater share of self-\r\ngovernment, which was to wreck the House of Stuart, was making itself\r\nheard before, on March 24, 1603, the last sovereign of the line which\r\nhad made England a really national state passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n1603-1815\r\n\r\n\r\nNational independence and popular self-government, although they were\r\nintimately associated as the two cardinal dogmas of nineteenth-century\r\nliberalism, are very different things; and the achievement of complete\r\nnational independence under the Tudors did not in the least involve any\r\nsolution of the question of popular self-government. Still, that\r\nachievement had been largely the work of the nation itself, and a\r\nnation which had braved the spiritual thunders of the papacy and the\r\ntemporal arms of Philip II would not be naturally submissive under\r\ndomestic tyranny. Perhaps the fact that James I was an alien hastened\r\nthe admonition, which parliament addressed to him in the first session\r\nof the reign, to the effect that it was not prepared to tolerate in him\r\nmany things which, on account of her age and sex, it had overlooked in\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nParliament began the constitutional conflict thus foreshadowed with no\r\nclear constitutional theory; and its views only crystallized under\r\npressure of James I's pretensions. James possessed an aptitude for\r\npolitical speculation, which was rendered all the more dangerous by the\r\nfacilities he enjoyed for putting his theories into practice. He tried\r\nto reduce monarchy to a logical system, and to enforce that system as\r\npractical politics. He had succeeded to the English throne in spite of\r\nHenry VIII's will, which had been given the force of a parliamentary\r\nstatute, and in spite of the common law which disabled an alien from\r\ninheriting English land. His only claim was by heredity, which had\r\nnever been legally recognized to the exclusion of other principles of\r\nsuccession. James was not content to ascribe his accession to such\r\nmundane circumstances as the personal unfitness of his rivals and the\r\nobvious advantages of a union of the English and Scottish crowns; and\r\nhe was led to attribute a supernatural virtue to the hereditary\r\nprinciple which had overcome obstacles so tremendous. Hence his theory\r\nof divine hereditary right. It must be distinguished from the divine\r\nright which the Tudors claimed; that was a right which was not\r\nnecessarily hereditary, but might be varied by the God of battles, as\r\nat Bosworth. It must also be distinguished from the Catholic theory,\r\nwhich gave the church a voice in the election and deposition of kings.\r\nAccording to James's view, Providence had not merely ordained the king\r\n_de facto_, but had pre-ordained the kings that were to be, by\r\nselecting heredity as the principle by which the succession was to be\r\ndetermined for ever and ever. This ordinance, being divine, was beyond\r\nthe power of man to alter. The fitness of the king to rule, the justice\r\nor efficiency of his government, were irrelevant details. Parliament\r\ncould no more alter the succession, depose a sovereign, or limit his\r\nauthority than it could amend the constitution of the universe. From\r\nthis premiss James deduced a number of conclusions. Royal power was\r\nabsolute; the king could do no wrong for which his subjects could call\r\nhim to account; he was responsible to God but not to man--a doctrine\r\nwhich the Reformation had encouraged by proclaiming the Royal Supremacy\r\nover the church. He might, if he chose, make concessions to his people,\r\nand a wise sovereign like himself would respect the concessions of his\r\npredecessors. But parliamentary and popular privileges existed by royal\r\ngrace; they could not be claimed as rights.\r\n\r\nThis dogmatic assurance, to which the Tudors had never resorted,\r\nembittered parliamentary opposition and obscured the historical\r\njustification for many of James's claims. Historically, there was much\r\nmore to be said for the contention that parliament existed by grace of\r\nthe monarchy than for the counterclaim that the monarchy existed by\r\ngrace of parliament; and for the plea that parliament only possessed\r\nsuch powers as the crown had granted, than for the counter-assertion\r\nthat the crown only enjoyed such rights as parliament had conceded. Few\r\nof James's arbitrary acts could not be justified by precedent, and not\r\na little of his unpopularity was due to his efforts to exact from local\r\ngentry the performance of duties which had been imposed upon them by\r\nearlier parliaments. The main cause of dissatisfaction was the growing\r\npopular conviction that constitutional weapons, used by the Tudors for\r\nnational purposes, were now being used by the Stuarts in the interests\r\nof the monarchy against those of the nation; and as the breach widened,\r\nthe more the Stuarts were led to rely on these weapons and on their\r\ntheory of the divine right of kings, and the more parliament was driven\r\nto insist upon its privileges and upon an alternative theory to that of\r\nJames I.\r\n\r\nThis alternative theory was difficult to elaborate. There was no idea\r\nof democracy. Complete popular self-government is, indeed, impossible;\r\nfor the mass of men cannot rule, and the actual administration must\r\nalways be in the hands of a comparatively few experts. The problem was\r\nand is how to control them and where to limit their authority; and this\r\nis a question of degree. In 1603 no one claimed that ministers were\r\nresponsible to any one but the king; administration was his exclusive\r\nfunction. It was, however, claimed that parliamentary sanction must be\r\nobtained for the general principles upon which the people were to be\r\ngoverned--that is to say, for legislation. The crown might appoint what\r\nbishops it pleased, but it could not repeal the Act of Uniformity; it\r\nmight make war or peace, but could not impose direct and general\r\ntaxation; it selected judges, but they could only condemn men to death\r\nor imprisonment for offences recognized by the law. The subject was not\r\nat the mercy of the king except when he placed himself outside the law.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage, however, of an unwritten constitution is that there\r\nare always a number of cases for which the law does not provide; and\r\nthere were many more in the seventeenth century than there are to-day.\r\nThese cases constituted the debatable land between the crown and\r\nparliament. Parliament assumed that the crown could neither diminish\r\nparliamentary privilege nor develop its own prerogative without\r\nparliamentary sanction; and it read this assumption back into history.\r\nNothing was legal unless it had been sanctioned by parliament; unless\r\nthe crown could vouch a parliamentary statute for its claims they were\r\ndenounced as void. This theory would have disposed of much of the\r\nconstitution, including the crown itself; even parliament had grown by\r\nprecedent rather than by statute. There were, as always, precedents on\r\nboth sides. The question was, which were the precedents of growth and\r\nwhich were those of decay? That could only be decided by the force of\r\ncircumstances, and the control of parliament over the national purse\r\nwas the decisive factor in the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Stuarts, indeed, were held in a cleft stick. Their revenue was\r\nsteadily decreasing because the direct taxes, instead of growing with\r\nthe nation's income, had remained fixed amounts since the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and the real value of those amounts declined rapidly with the\r\ninflux of precious metals from the New World. Yet the expense of\r\ngovernment automatically and inevitably increased, and disputes over\r\nforeign policy, over the treatment of Roman Catholics, over episcopal\r\njurisdiction, over parliamentary privileges, and a host of minor\r\nmatters made the Commons more and more reluctant to fill the empty\r\nTreasury. The blunt truth is that people will not pay for what they do\r\nnot consider their concern; and Stuart government grew less and less a\r\npopular affair. The more the Stuarts demanded, the greater the\r\nobstacles they encountered in securing compliance.\r\n\r\nJames I levied additional customs which were called impositions, and\r\nthe judges in 1606 properly decided that these were legal. But they\r\nincreased James's unpopularity; and, as a precaution, parliament would\r\nonly grant Charles I tonnage and poundage (the normal customs duties)\r\nfor one year after his accession instead of for life. Charles contended\r\nthat parliament had, owing to non-user, lost the right of refusing\r\nthese supplies to the crown; he proceeded to levy them by his own\r\nauthority, and further demanded a general forced loan and benevolence.\r\nFor refusing to pay, five knights were sent to prison by order of the\r\nprivy council \"without cause shewn,\" whereby the crown avoided a\r\njudicial decision on the legality of the loan. This provoked the\r\nPetition of Right in 1628; but in 1629 Charles finally quarrelled with\r\nparliament over the question whether in assenting to the petition he\r\nhad abandoned his right to levy tonnage and poundage. For eleven years\r\nhe ruled without parliament, raising supplies by various obsolete\r\nexpedients culminating in ship money, on behalf of which many patriotic\r\narguments about the necessities of naval defence were used.\r\n\r\nHe was brought up sharply when he began to kick against the\r\nPresbyterian pricks of Scotland; and the expenses of the Bishops' War\r\nput an end to the hand-to-mouth existence of his unparliamentary\r\ngovernment in England. The Long parliament went to the root of the\r\nmatter by demanding triennial sessions and the choice of ministers who\r\nhad the confidence of parliament. It emphasized its insistence upon\r\nministerial responsibility to parliament by executing Strafford and\r\nafterwards Laud. Charles, who laboured under the impression common to\r\nreactionaries that they are defending the rights of the people,\r\ncontended that, in claiming an unfettered right to choose his own\r\nadvisers, he was championing one of the most obvious liberties of the\r\nsubject. Parliament, however, had realized that in politics principles\r\nconsist of details as a pound consists of pence; and that if it wanted\r\nsound legislative principles, it must take care of the details of\r\nadministration. Charles had ruled eleven years without parliament; but\r\nso had Wolsey, and Elizabeth had apologized when she called it together\r\noftener than about once in five years. If the state had had more\r\nfinancial ballast, and the church had been less high and top-heavy,\r\nCharles might seemingly have weathered the storm and let parliament\r\nsubside into impotence, as the Bourbons let the States-General of\r\nFrance, without any overt breach of the constitution. After all, the\r\noriginal design of the crown had been to get money out of parliament,\r\nand the main object of parliament had once been to make the king live\r\nof his own. A king content with parsimony might lawfully dispense with\r\nparliament; and the eleven years had shown the precarious basis of\r\nparliamentary institutions, given a thrifty king and an unambitious\r\ncountry. Events were demonstrating the truth of Hobbes's maxim that\r\nsovereignty is indivisible; peace could not be kept between a sovereign\r\nlegislature and a sovereign executive; parliament must control the\r\ncrown, or some day the eleven years would recur and become perpetual.\r\nIn France, unparliamentary government was prolonged by the victory of\r\nthe crown for a century and three-quarters. In England, Charles's was\r\nthe last experiment, because parliament defeated the claim of the crown\r\nto rule by means of irresponsible ministers.\r\n\r\nIn such a contest for the control of the executive there could be no\r\nfinal arbitrament save that of force; but Charles was only able to\r\nfight at all because parliament destroyed its own unanimity by\r\nattacking the church, and thus provided him with a party and an army.\r\nMore than a temporary importance, however, attaches to the fact that\r\nthe abeyance of monarchical power at once gave rise to permanent\r\nEnglish parties; and it was natural that those parties should begin by\r\nfighting a civil war, for party is in the main an organ for the\r\nexpression of combative instincts, and the metaphors of party warfare\r\nare still of a military character. Englishmen's combative instincts\r\nwere formerly curbed by the crown; but since the decline of monarchy\r\nthey have either been vented against other nations, or expressed in\r\nparty conflicts. The instinct does not commonly require two forms of\r\nexpression at once, and party strife subsides during a national war.\r\nIts methods of expression, too, have been slowly and partially\r\ncivilized; and even a general election is more humane than a civil war.\r\nBut the first attack of an epidemic is usually the most virulent, and\r\nparty strife has not a second time attained the dimensions of civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this mitigation is that the questions at issue have been\r\ngradually narrowed down until, although they bulk large to heated\r\nimaginations, they really cover a very small area of political life,\r\nand the main lines continue the same whichever party triumphs. Another\r\nreason is that experience has proved the necessity of the submission of\r\nthe minority to the majority. This is one of the greatest achievements\r\nof politics. In the thirteenth century Peter des Roches claimed\r\nexemption from the payment of a scutage on the ground that he had voted\r\nagainst it, and his claim was held to be valid. Such a contention means\r\nanarchy, and considerable progress had been made before the seventeenth\r\ncentury towards the constitutional doctrine that the vote of the\r\nmajority binds the whole community. But the process was incomplete, and\r\nthe causes of strife between Roundhead and Royalist were fundamental. A\r\nvictory of the Royalists would have been carried to extremes, as the\r\nvictory of the Roundheads was; and the result would almost certainly\r\nhave been despotic government until a still more violent outbreak\r\nprecipitated the country into a series of revolutions.\r\n\r\nLiberty, like religious toleration, has been won through the\r\ninternecine warfare between various forms of despotism; and the\r\nstrength of the Royalists lay in the fact that parliament, in espousing\r\nPresbyterianism, weighted its cause with an ecclesiastical system as\r\nnarrow and tyrannical as Laud's. New presbyter was but old priest writ\r\nlarge, and the balance between the two gave the decision into the hands\r\nof the Independents, whose numerical inferiority was redeemed by\r\nCromwell's military genius. When Presbyterians and Independents had\r\nground the Royalists to powder at Marston Moor and Naseby, Charles\r\nsought to recover his authority through their quarrels. He fell between\r\ntwo stools. His double dealings with both parties led to the second\r\ncivil war, to his own execution, and to the abolition of monarchy and\r\nof the House of Lords in 1649. Having crushed Catholic Ireland and\r\nPresbyterian Scotland, to which Charles and his son had in turn\r\nappealed, Cromwell was faced with the problem of governing England.\r\n\r\nThe victorious party was in a hopeless minority, and some of the\r\nfervour with which the Independents appealed to divine election may\r\nhave been due to a consciousness that they would not have passed the\r\ntest of a popular vote. In their view, God had determined the\r\nfundamentals of the constitution by giving the victory to His elect;\r\nthese fundamentals were to be enshrined in a written rigid\r\nconstitution, and placed beyond the reach of parliament or the people.\r\nUnder the sovereignty of this inspired constitution (1653), which\r\nprovided, among other things, for the union of England, Ireland, and\r\nScotland, a drastic reform of the franchise and redistribution of\r\nseats, the government was to be in the hands of a \"single person,\" the\r\nProtector, and a single chamber, the House of Commons. The single\r\nperson soon found the single chamber \"horridly arbitrary,\" and\r\npreferred the freedom of military despotism. But his major-generals\r\nwere even more arbitrary than the single chamber, and in 1657 a fresh\r\nconstitution was elaborated with a Second Chamber to make it popular.\r\nThe Restoration had, in fact, begun almost as soon as the war was over;\r\nthe single chamber republic of 1649-1653 had given place to a single-\r\nchamber monarchy, called the Protectorate, and a further step was taken\r\nwhen in 1657 the \"other\" House was added; Cromwell was within an ace of\r\nmaking himself a king and his dynasty hereditary. Only his personal\r\ngenius, the strength of his army, and the success of his foreign policy\r\nenabled him thus to restore the forms of the old constitution without\r\nthe support of the social forces on which it had been based. His death\r\nin 1658 was necessarily followed by anarchy, and anarchy by the recall\r\nof Charles II.\r\n\r\nThe Restoration was not so much a restoration of monarchy, which had\r\nreally been achieved in 1653, as a restoration of the church, of\r\nparliament, and of the landed gentry; and each took its toll of profit\r\nfrom the situation. The church secured the most sectarian of its\r\nvarious settlements, and the narrowness of its re-establishment kept\r\nnearly half the nation outside its pale. The landed gentry obtained the\r\npredominant voice in parliament for a century and three-quarters, and,\r\nas a consequence, the abolition of its feudal services to the crown,\r\nthe financial deficit being made up by an excise on beer instead of by\r\na land-tax. Parliament emancipated itself from the dictation of the\r\narmy, taking care never to run that risk again, and from the\r\nrestrictions of a written, rigid constitution. It also recovered its\r\nrotten boroughs and antiquated franchise, but lost its union with the\r\nparliaments of Ireland and Scotland. At first it seemed more royalist\r\nthan the king; but it soon appeared that its enthusiasm for the\r\nmonarchy was more evanescent than its attachment to the church and\r\nlanded interest. Even in the first flush it refrained from restoring\r\nthe Star Chamber and the other prerogative courts and councils which\r\nhad enabled the crown to dispense with parliamentary and common law\r\ncontrol; and Charles II was never able to repeat his father's\r\nexperiment of ruling for eleven years without a parliament.\r\n\r\nThe ablest, least scrupulous, and most popular of the Stuarts, he began\r\nhis reign with two objects: the emancipation of the crown from control\r\nas far as possible, and the emancipation of the Roman Catholics from\r\ntheir position of political inferiority; but the pursuit of both\r\nobjects was strictly conditioned by a determination not to embark on\r\nhis travels again. The two objects were really incompatible. Charles\r\ncould only make himself autocratic with the support of the Anglican\r\nchurch, and the church was determined to tolerate no relaxation of the\r\npenal code against other Catholics. At first Charles had to submit to\r\nClarendon and the church; but in 1667 he gladly replaced Clarendon by\r\nthe Cabal administration, among the members of which the only bond of\r\nunity was that it did not contain a sound Anglican churchman. With its\r\nassistance he published his Declarations of Indulgence for Roman\r\nCatholics and Dissenters (1672), and sought to secure himself against\r\nparliamentary recalcitrance by a secret treaty with Louis XIV (1670).\r\nThis policy failed against the stubborn opposition of the church. The\r\nCabal fell; Danby, a replica of Clarendon, came into office; and the\r\nTest Act of 1673 made the position of the Roman Catholics worse than it\r\nwas before the Declaration.\r\n\r\nThis failure convinced Charles that one of his two designs must go by\r\nthe board. He threw over the less popular cause of his co-religionists;\r\nand henceforth devoted himself to the task of emancipating the crown\r\nfrom parliamentary interference. But popular suspicion had been aroused\r\nby Charles's secret dealings and James's open professions; and Titus\r\nOates, who knew something about real plans for the reconversion of\r\nEngland, inflated his knowledge into a monstrous tale of a popish plot.\r\nThe Whigs, as the opposition party came to be called, used it for more\r\nthan it was worth to damage the Tories under Danby. The panic produced\r\none useful measure, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, many judicial\r\nmurders, and a foolish attempt to exclude James from the succession, As\r\nit subsided, Charles deftly turned the reaction to the ruin of the\r\nWhigs (1681). Of their leaders, Shaftesbury fled to Holland, and Sidney\r\nand Russell were brought to the block; their parliamentary strongholds\r\nin the cities and towns were packed with Tories; and for the last four\r\nyears of his reign Charles ruled without a parliament, but with the\r\ngoodwill of the Tories and the church.\r\n\r\nThis half of the nation would probably have acquiesced in the growth of\r\ndespotism under James II, had not the new king ostentatiously ignored\r\nthe wisdom of Charles II. He began (1685) with everything in his\r\nfavour: a Tory parliament, a discredited opposition, which further\r\nweakened its case by Argyll's and Monmouth's rebellions, and a great\r\nreputation for honesty. Within a couple of years he had thrown away all\r\nthese advantages by his revival of Charles II's abandoned Roman\r\nCatholic policy, and had alienated the Anglican church, by whose\r\nsupport alone he could hope to rule as an English despot. He suspended\r\nand dispensed with laws, introduced Roman Catholics into the army, the\r\nuniversities, the privy council, raised a standing force of thirty\r\nthousand men, and finally prosecuted seven bishops for seditious libel.\r\nWilliam III, the husband of James's daughter Mary, was invited by\r\nrepresentatives of all parties to come over as England's deliverer, and\r\nJames fled on his approach. He could not fight, like his father,\r\nbecause no English party supported his cause.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1688 was singularly negative so far as its results\r\nwere expressed in the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement. These\r\ncelebrated constitutional documents made little provision for national\r\nself-government. One king, it is true, had been evicted from the\r\nthrone, and Roman Catholics were to be always excluded; and these\r\nmeasures disposed of divine hereditary right. But that had been a\r\nStuart invention, and kings had been deposed before James II. Why\r\nshould self-government follow on the events of 1688 any more than on\r\nthose of 1399, 1461, or 1485? Future sovereigns were, indeed, to\r\nrefrain from doing much that James had done. They were not to keep a\r\nstanding army in time of peace, not to pardon ministers impeached by\r\nthe House of Commons, not to dismiss judges except on an address from\r\nboth Houses of Parliament, not to suspend laws at all nor to dispense\r\nwith them in the way James had done, not to keep a parliament nor do\r\nwithout one longer than three years, and not to require excessive bail.\r\nReligious toleration, too, was secured in some measure, and freedom of\r\nthe press to a limited extent. But all these enactments were safeguards\r\nagainst the abuse of royal power and infringement of civil liberty\r\nrather than provisions for self-government. No law was passed requiring\r\nthe king to be guided by ministers enjoying the confidence of\r\nparliament; he was still the real and irresponsible executive, and\r\nparliament was limited to legislation. The favourite Whig toast of\r\n\"civil and religious liberty\" implied an Englishman's right to freedom\r\nfrom molestation, but not a right to a voice in the government of the\r\ncountry. Responsible self-government was not guaranteed by the laws,\r\nbut it was ensured by the facts, of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the methods of English constitutional progress have\r\nbeen, down to this day, offensive strategy and defensive tactics.\r\nPositions have been taken up which necessitate the retirement of the\r\nforces of reaction, unless they are prepared to make attacks\r\npredestined to defeat; and so, nearly every Liberal advance has been\r\nmade to appear the result of Tory aggression. The central position has\r\nalways been control of the purse by parliament. At first it only\r\nembraced certain forms of direct taxation; gradually it was extended\r\nand developed by careful spade-work until it covered every source of\r\nrevenue. Entrenched behind these formidable earthworks, parliament\r\nproceeded to dictate to the early Stuarts the terms of national policy.\r\nCharles I, provoked by its assumptions, made his attack on the central\r\nposition, was foiled, and in his retreat left large portions of the\r\ncrown's equipment in the hands of parliament. Rasher attacks by James\r\nII resulted in a still more precipitate retreat and in the abandonment\r\nof more of the royal prerogatives. The growth of the empire and of the\r\nexpenses of government riveted more firmly than ever the hold of\r\nparliament over the crown; the greater the demands which it alone could\r\nmeet, the higher the conditions it could impose upon their grant, until\r\nparliament determined absolutely the terms upon which the office of\r\nmonarchy should be held. In a similar way the Commons used their\r\ncontrol of the national purse to restrict the powers of the House of\r\nLords; provocation has led to attacks on the central position, and the\r\nfailure of these attacks has been followed by surrender. Prudent\r\nleaders have preferred to retire without courting the preliminary of\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nWilliam III and his successors adopted this course when confronted with\r\nthe impregnable position of parliament after the Revolution; and hence\r\nlater constitutional gains, while no apparent part of the parliamentary\r\nposition, were its inevitable consequences. William, absorbed in a\r\nlife-and-death struggle with Louis XIV, required a constant stream of\r\nsupplies from parliament; and to secure its regularity he had to rely\r\non the good offices and advice of those who commanded most votes in the\r\nHouse of Commons. In the Lords, who then numbered less than two\r\nhundred, he could secure the balance of power through the appointment\r\nof bishops. In the Commons his situation was more difficult. The\r\npartial demise of personal monarchy in 1688 led to a scramble for its\r\neffects, and the scramble to the organization of the two principal\r\ncompetitors, the Whig and Tory parties. The Whigs formed a \"junto,\" or\r\ncaucus, and the Tories followed their example. William preferred the\r\nWhigs, because they sympathized with his wars; but the country\r\nsometimes preferred the Tories, because it hated William's Dutchmen and\r\ntaxation. On William's death in 1702 the danger from Louis XIV was\r\nconsidered so acute that a ministry was formed from all parties in\r\norder to secure the united support of parliament; but gradually, in\r\nAnne's reign, the Tories who wanted to make peace left the ministry,\r\nuntil in 1708 it became purely Whig. In 1710 it fell, and the Tories\r\ntook its place. They wanted a Stuart restoration, even at the price of\r\nundoing the Revolution, if only the Pretender would abandon his popery;\r\nwhile the Whigs were determined to maintain the Revolution even at the\r\nprice of a Hanoverian dynasty. They returned to power in 1714 with the\r\naccession of George I, and monopolized office for more than half a\r\ncentury. As time went on, many Whigs became hardly distinguishable from\r\nTories who had relinquished Jacobitism; and from Lord North's accession\r\nto office in 1770 down to 1830 the Tories enjoyed in their turn a half-\r\ncentury of nearly unbroken power.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the party system and cabinet government were\r\nelaborated. Party supplanted the crown as the determining factor in\r\nBritish government, and the cabinet became the executive committee of\r\nthe party possessing a majority in the House of Commons. Queen Anne had\r\nnot the intellect nor vigour to assert her independence of ministers,\r\nand George I, who understood no English, ceased to attend cabinet\r\nmeetings. The royal veto disappeared, and even the king's choice of\r\nministers was severely limited, not by law but by practical\r\nnecessities. Ministers, instead of giving individual advice which the\r\nsovereign might reject, met together without the king and tendered\r\ncollective advice, the rejection of which by the sovereign meant their\r\nresignation, and if parliament agreed with them, its dissolution or\r\nsurrender on the part of the crown. For the purpose of tendering this\r\nadvice and maintaining order in the cabinet, a chief was needed;\r\nWalpole, by eliminating all competitors during his long administration\r\n(1721-1742), developed the office of prime minister, which, without any\r\nlaw to establish it, became one of the most important of British\r\ninstitutions. Similarly the cabinet itself grew and was not created by\r\nany Act; indeed, while the cabinet and the prime minister were growing,\r\nit would have been impossible to induce any parliament to create them,\r\nfor parliament was still jealous of royal influence, and even wanted to\r\nexclude from its ranks all servants of the crown. But, fortunately, the\r\nabsence of a written constitution enabled the British constitution to\r\ngrow and adapt itself to circumstances without legal enactment.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that the cabinet was the executive committee of the\r\nmajority in the House of Commons gave it the command of the Lower\r\nHouse, and by means of the Commons' financial powers, of the crown.\r\nThis party system was deplored by many; Bolingbroke, a Tory leader out\r\nof office, called for a national party, and urged the crown to\r\nemancipate itself from Whig domination by choosing ministers from all\r\nsections. Chatham thought that in the interests of national efficiency,\r\nthe ablest ministers should be selected, whatever their political\r\npredilections. George III adapted these ideas to the purpose of making\r\nhimself a king in deed. But his success in breaking down the party and\r\ncabinet system was partial and temporary; he only succeeded in humbling\r\nthe Whig houses by giving himself a master in the person of the younger\r\nPitt (1784), who was supported by the majority of the nation.\r\n\r\nWith the House of Lords the cabinet has had more prolonged and\r\ncomplicated troubles. Ostensibly and constitutionally the disputes have\r\nbeen between the two Houses of Parliament; and this was really the case\r\nbefore the development of the close connexion between the cabinet and\r\nthe Commons. Both Houses had profited by the overthrow of the crown in\r\nthe seventeenth century, and the extremes to which they sometimes\r\npushed their claims suggest that they were as anxious as the crown had\r\nbeen to place themselves above the law. The House of Lords did succeed\r\nin making its judicial decisions law in spite of the crown and Commons,\r\nalthough the Commons were part of the \"High Court of Parliament,\" and\r\nno law had granted the Lords supreme appellate jurisdiction; hence the\r\nconstitutional position of the House of Lords was made by its own\r\ndecisions and not by Act of Parliament or of the crown. This claim to\r\nappellate jurisdiction, which was much disputed by the Commons during\r\nthe reign of Charles II, was only conceded in return for a similar\r\nconcession to the Commons in financial matters. Here the Commons\r\npractically made their resolutions law, though the Lords insisted that\r\nthe privilege should not be abused by \"tacking\" extraneous provisions\r\non to financial measures.\r\n\r\nThere were some further disputes in the reigns of William III and Anne,\r\nbut the only occasion upon which peers were actually made in order to\r\ncarry a measure, was when the Tories created a dozen to pass the Peace\r\nof Utrecht in 1712. It is, indeed, a singular fact that no serious\r\nconflict between the two Houses occurred during the whole of the\r\nGeorgian period from 1714 to 1830. The explanation seems to be that\r\nboth Houses were simply the political agents of the same organized\r\naristocracy. The humble townsfolk who figured in the parliaments of\r\nEdward I (see p. 65) disappeared when a seat in the House of Commons\r\nbecame a position of power and privilege; and to the first parliament\r\n(1547) for which journals of the Commons proved worth preserving, the\r\neldest son of a peer thought it worth while seeking election. Many\r\nsuccessors followed; towns were bribed or constrained to choose the\r\nnominees of peers and country magnates; burgage tenements were bought\r\nup by noble families to secure votes; and the Restoration parliament\r\nhad material reasons for treating Cromwell's reforms as void, and\r\nrestoring rotten boroughs and fancy franchises. By the time that\r\nparliament had emancipated itself from the control of the crown, it had\r\nalso emancipated itself to a considerable extent from the control of\r\nthe constituencies.\r\n\r\nThis political system would not have developed nor lasted so long as it\r\ndid, had it not had some virtue and some relevance to its environment.\r\nIn every country's development there is a stage in which aristocracy is\r\nthe best form of government. England had outgrown monarchical\r\ndespotism, but it was not yet fit for democracy. Political power\r\ndepends upon education, and it would have been unreasonable to expect\r\nintelligent votes from men who could not read or write, had small\r\nknowledge of politics, little practical training in local\r\nadministration, and none of the will to exercise control. Politics were\r\nstill the affair of the few, because only the few could comprehend\r\nthem, or were conscious of the uses and limitations of political power.\r\nThe corrupt and misguided use of their votes by those who possessed\r\nthem was some reason for not extending the franchise to still more\r\nignorant masses; and it was not entirely irrational to leave the\r\ncontrol of national affairs in the hands of that section of the nation\r\nwhich had received some sort of political education.\r\n\r\nThe defects, however, of a political system, which restricts power to a\r\nlimited class or classes, are that each class tends to exercise it in\r\nits own interests and resents its extension to others, even when they\r\nare qualified for its use. If all other historical records had\r\ndisappeared, land laws, game laws, inclosure acts, and corn laws--after\r\nthe Revolution a bounty was actually placed on the export of corn,\r\nwhereby the community was taxed in order to deprive itself of food or\r\nmake it dearer--alone would prove that political power in the Georgian\r\nperiod was vested in a landed aristocracy, though England's commercial\r\npolicy, especially towards Ireland, would show that mercantile\r\ninterests had also to be consulted. Similarly, the journals of the\r\nHouse of Commons would prove it to have been a close corporation less\r\nanxious for the reign of law than for its own supremacy over the law.\r\nIt claimed authority to decide by its own resolutions who had the right\r\nto vote for its members and who had the right to a seat. It expelled\r\nmembers duly elected, and declared candidates elected who had been duly\r\nrejected. It repudiated responsibility to public opinion as derogatory\r\nto its liberties and independence; it excluded strangers, and punished\r\nthe publication of debates and division-lists as high misdemeanours. It\r\nwas a law unto itself, and its notions of liberty sometimes sank to the\r\nlevel of those of a feudal baron.\r\n\r\nHence the comparative ease and success with which George III filled its\r\nsacred precincts with his paid battalions of \"king's friends.\" He would\r\nhave been powerless against a really representative House; but he could\r\nbuy boroughs and votes as effectively as Whig or Tory dukes, and it was\r\nhis intervention that raised a doubt in the mind of the House whether\r\nit might not need some measure of reform. The influence of the crown,\r\nit resolved in 1780, had increased, was increasing, and ought to be\r\ndiminished. But it could only be diminished by destroying that basis of\r\ncorruption which supported the power of the oligarchs no less than that\r\nof the crown. Reform would be a self-denying ordinance, if not an act\r\nof political suicide, as well as a blow at George III. Privileged\r\nbodies do not reform themselves; proposals by Burke and by Pitt and by\r\nothers were rejected one after another; and then the French Revolution\r\ncame to stiffen the wavering ranks of reaction. Not till the Industrial\r\nRevolution had changed the face of England did the old political forces\r\nacknowledge their defeat and surrender their claim to govern the nation\r\nagainst its will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n1603-1815\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Elizabeth Englishmen had made themselves acquainted\r\nwith the world. They had surveyed it from Greenland's icy mountains to\r\nIndia's coral strand, and from the Orinoco to Japan, where William\r\nAdams built the first Japanese navy; they had interfered in the\r\npolitics of the Moluccas and had sold English woollens in Bokhara; they\r\nhad sailed through the Golden Gate of California and up the Golden Horn\r\nof the Bosphorus; they had crossed the Pacific Ocean and the deserts of\r\nCentral Asia; they had made their country known alike to the Great Turk\r\nand to the Grand Moghul. National unity and the fertile mingling of\r\nclasses had generated this expansive energy, for the explorers included\r\nearls as well as humble mariners and traders; and all ranks, from the\r\nqueen downwards, took shares in their \"adventures.\" They had thus\r\nacquired a body of knowledge and experience which makes it misleading\r\nto speak of their blundering into empire. They soon learnt to\r\nconcentrate their energies upon those quarters of the globe in which\r\nexpansion was easiest and most profitable. The East India Company had\r\nreceived its charter in 1600, and the naval defeat of Spain had opened\r\nthe sea to all men; but, with the doubtful exception of Newfoundland,\r\nEngland secured no permanent footing outside the British Isles until\r\nafter the crowns of England and Scotland had been united.\r\n\r\nThis personal union can hardly be called part of the expansion of\r\nEngland, but it had been prepared by some assimilation and cooperation\r\nbetween the two peoples, and it was followed by a great deal more. The\r\nplantation of Ulster by English and Scots after the flight of the Irish\r\nearls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell in 1607 is one illustration, and Nova\r\nScotia is another; but Virginia, the first colony of the empire, was a\r\npurely English enterprise, and it cradled the first-born child of the\r\nMother of Parliaments. To Virginia men went for profit; principle drove\r\nthem to New England. The Pilgrim Fathers, who sailed in the\r\n_Mayflower_ in 1620, had separated from the church and meant to\r\nseparate from the state, and to set up a polity the antithesis of that\r\nof Laud and the Stuarts. But there was something in common between\r\nthem; the Puritans, too, wanted uniformity, and believed in their right\r\nto compel all to think, or at least to worship, alike. Schism, however,\r\nappeals with ill grace and little success to authority; and\r\ndissentients from the dissenters formed Independent offshoots from New\r\nEngland. But all these Puritan communities in the north were different\r\nin character from Virginia in the south; they consisted of democratic\r\ntownships, Virginia of plantations worked by slaves. Slave labour was\r\nalso the economic basis of the colonies established on various West\r\nIndian islands during the first half of the seventeenth century; and\r\nthis distinction between colonies used for exploitation and colonies\r\nused for settlement has led to important constitutional variations in\r\nthe empire. Only those colonies in which large white communities are\r\nsettled have received self-government; those in which a few whites\r\nexploit a large coloured population remain subject to the control of\r\nthe home government. The same economic and social differences were\r\nresponsible for the great American civil war between North and South in\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere are three periods in British colonial expansion. The first, or\r\nintroductory period, was marked by England's rivalry with Spain and\r\nPortugal; the second by its rivalry with the Dutch; and the third by\r\nits rivalry with France; and in each the rivalry led to wars in which\r\nBritain was victorious. The Elizabethan war with Spain was followed by\r\nthe Dutch wars of the Commonwealth and Charles II's reign, and then by\r\nthe French wars, which lasted, with longer or shorter intervals, from\r\n1688 to 1815. The wars with the Dutch showed how completely, in the\r\nlatter half of the seventeenth century, commercial interests outweighed\r\nthose of religion and politics. Even when English and Dutch were both\r\nliving under Protestant republics, they fought one another rather than\r\nthe Catholic monarchies of France and Spain. Their antagonism arose\r\nover rival claims to sovereignty in the Narrow Seas, which the herring\r\nfisheries had made as valuable as gold mines, and out of competition\r\nfor the world's carrying trade and for commerce in the East Indies. The\r\nlast-named source of irritation had led to a \"massacre\" of Englishmen\r\nat Amboyna in 1623, after which the English abandoned the East Indian\r\nislands to the Dutch East India Company, concentrating their attention\r\nupon India, where the acquisition of settlements at Calcutta, Madras,\r\nand Bombay laid the foundations of the three great Presidencies of the\r\nBritish Empire in India.\r\n\r\nA fatal blow was struck at the Dutch carrying trade by the Navigation\r\nActs of 1650-1651, which provided that all goods imported into England\r\nor any of its colonies must be brought either in English ships or in\r\nthose of the producing country. The Dutch contested these Acts in a\r\nstubborn naval war. The great Admirals, Van Tromp and Blake, were not\r\nunevenly matched; but the Dutch failed to carry their point. The\r\nprinciple of the Navigation Acts was reaffirmed, with some\r\nmodifications, after the Restoration, which made no difference to\r\nEngland's commercial and colonial policy. A second Dutch war\r\naccordingly broke out in 1664, and this time the Dutch, besides failing\r\nin their original design, lost the New Netherland colony they had\r\nestablished in North America. Portions of it became New York, so named\r\nafter the future James II, who was Duke of York and Lord High Admiral,\r\nand other parts were colonized as Pennsylvania by the Quaker, William\r\nPenn. The great importance of this acquisition was that it drove out\r\nthe wedge dividing the New England colonies to the north from Virginia\r\nand Maryland, which had been founded in Charles I's reign, mainly as a\r\nrefuge for Roman Catholics, to the south; and this continuous line of\r\nBritish colonies along the Atlantic seaboard was soon continued\r\nsouthwards by the settlement of the two Carolinas. The colonization of\r\nGeorgia, still further south, in the reign of George II, completed the\r\nthirteen colonies which became the original United States.\r\n\r\nFrance now overshadowed Holland as England's chief competitor. Canada,\r\noriginally colonized by the French, had been conquered by the English\r\nin 1629, but speedily restored by Charles I; and towards the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century France began to think of uniting Canada with\r\nanother French colony, Louisiana, by a chain of posts along the\r\nMississippi. Colbert, Louis XIV's minister, had greatly developed\r\nFrench commerce, navy, and navigation; and the Mississippi Company was\r\nan important factor in French history early in the eighteenth century.\r\nThis design, if successful, would have neutralized the advantage\r\nEngland had secured in the possession of the Atlantic seaboard of North\r\nAmerica, and have made the vast West a heritage of France.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the wars of William III and Anne were not in the main\r\ncolonial. Louis' support of James II, and his recognition of the Old\r\nPretender, were blows at the heart of the empire. Moderate success on\r\nJames's part might have led to its dismemberment, to the separation of\r\nCatholic Ireland and the Scottish Highlands from the remainder of the\r\nBritish Isles; and dominion abroad would not long have survived\r\ndisruption at home. The battle of the Boyne (1690) disposed of Irish\r\nindependence, and the Act of Union with Scotland (1707) ensured Great\r\nBritain against the revival of separate sovereignties north and south\r\nof the Tweed. Scotland surrendered her independent parliament and\r\nadministration: it received instead the protection of the Navigation\r\nlaws, representation in both houses of the United Parliament, and the\r\nprivilege of free trade with England and its colonies--which put an end\r\nto the tariff wars waged between the two countries in the seventeenth\r\ncentury; and it retained its established Presbyterian church. Forty-\r\nfive Scottish members were to sit in the House of Commons, and sixteen\r\nScottish peers elected by their fellows for each parliament in the\r\nHouse of Lords. Scottish peers who were not thus chosen could neither\r\nsit in the House of Lords nor seek election to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIn time this union contributed materially to the expansive energy of\r\nthe British Empire, but it did not substantially help Marlborough to\r\nwin his brilliant victories in the war with France (1702-1713). Apart\r\nfrom the general defeat of Louis XIV's ambition to dominate Europe, the\r\nmost important result, from the British point of view, was the definite\r\nestablishment of Great Britain as a Mediterranean power by the\r\nacquisition of Gibraltar and Minorca. English expeditions against\r\nCanada had not been very successful, but the Peace of Utrecht (1713)\r\nfinally secured for the empire the outworks of the Canadian citadel--\r\nHudson's Bay Territories, Newfoundland, and the future provinces of\r\nNova Scotia and New Brunswick. The trading privileges which Great\r\nBritain also secured in Spanish America both assisted the vast growth\r\nof British commerce under Walpole's pacific rule, and provoked the war\r\nwith Spain in 1739 which helped to bring about his fall. This war,\r\nwhich soon merged in the war of the Austrian Succession (1741-1748),\r\nwas indecisive in its colonial aspects, and left the question of French\r\nor English predominance in India and North America to be settled in the\r\nSeven Years' War of 1756-1763.\r\n\r\nWar, however, decides little by itself, and three of the world's\r\ngreatest soldiers, Alexander, Hannibal, and Napoleon, founded no\r\npermanent empires. An excellent servant, but a bad master, the soldier\r\nneeds to be the instrument of other than military forces if his labours\r\nare to last; and the permanence of the results of the Seven Years' War\r\nis due less to the genius of Pitt, Wolfe, Clive, and Howe than to the\r\ncauses which laid the foundations of their achievements. The future of\r\nNorth America was determined not so much by Wolfe's capture of Quebec--\r\nwhich had fallen into British hands before--as by the fact that before\r\nthe Seven Years' War broke out there were a million and a quarter\r\nBritish colonists against some eighty thousand French. If Canada had\r\nnot fallen in the Seven Years' War, it would have succumbed to British\r\narms in the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon. The fate of\r\nIndia seemed less certain, and the genius of Dupleix roused better\r\nhopes for France; yet India, defenceless as it was against European\r\nforces, was bound to fall a prize to the masters of the sea, unless\r\nsome European state could control its almost impassable overland\r\napproaches. Clive, perhaps, was almost as much the brilliant adventurer\r\nas Dupleix, but he was supported at need by an organized government\r\nmore susceptible than the French _ancien régime_ to the pressure\r\nof commercial interests and of popular ambitions.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Canada led to the loss of the thirteen American\r\ncolonies. Their original bias towards separation had never been\r\neradicated, and the recurrent quarrels between the various legislatures\r\nand their governors had only been prevented from coming to a head by\r\nfear of the Frenchmen at their gates and disunion among themselves.\r\nCharles II and James II wanted to centralize the New England colonies\r\non a monarchical basis; and they began by attacking their charters in\r\nmuch the same way as they dealt with the Puritan corporations of\r\nEnglish cities and boroughs. Those of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and\r\nRhode Island were forfeited, and these colonies were thus provided with\r\na grievance common to themselves and to the mother-country. But, while\r\nthe Revolution supplied a remedy at home, it did not in the colonies.\r\nTheir charters, indeed, were restored; but when the Massachusetts\r\nlegislature passed a bill similar to the Bill of Rights, the royal\r\nassent was not accorded, and the colonists remained liable to taxation\r\nwithout their own consent. This theoretical right of Great Britain to\r\ntax the American colonies was wisely left in abeyance until George\r\nGrenville's righteous soul was vexed with the thought that colonists,\r\nfor whose benefit the Seven Years' War had largely been waged, should\r\nescape contribution towards its expenses. Walpole had reduced the\r\nduties on colonial produce and had winked at the systematic evasion of\r\nthe Navigation Acts by the colonists. Grenville was incapable of such\r\nstatesmanlike obliquity. He tried to stop smuggling; he asserted the\r\nright of the home government to control the vast hinterland from which\r\nthe colonists thought that the French had been evicted for their\r\nparticular benefit; and he passed the Stamp Act, levying internal\r\ntaxation from the colonies without consulting their legislatures.\r\n\r\nSecurity from the French made the colonists think they were independent\r\nof the British, and, having an inordinate proportion of lawyers among\r\nthem, they did not lack plausible arguments. They admitted the right of\r\nthe British parliament to impose external taxes, such as customs\r\nduties, on the colonies, but denied its right to levy internal\r\ntaxation. The distinction was well established in English\r\nconstitutional history, and kings had long enjoyed powers over the\r\ncustoms which they had lost over direct taxation. But the English\r\nforefathers of the Puritan colonists had seen to it that control over\r\ndirect, led to control over indirect, taxation; and it may be assumed\r\nthat the American demand for the one would, if granted, soon have been\r\nfollowed by a demand for the other. In any case, reasons for separation\r\nwould not have been long in forthcoming. It was not that the old\r\ncolonial system was particularly harsh or oppressive; for the colonial\r\nproducer, if restricted (nominally) to the home market, was well\r\nprotected there. But the colonists wanted complete control over their\r\nown domestic affairs. It was a natural and a thoroughly British desire,\r\nthe denial of which to-day would at once provoke the disruption of the\r\nempire; and there was no reason to expect colonial content with a\r\ngovernment which was not giving much satisfaction in England. A\r\npeaceful solution was out of the question, because the governing\r\nclasses, which steadily resisted English demands for reform, were not\r\nlikely to concede American demands for radical innovations. There were\r\nno precedents for such a self-denying ordinance as the grant of\r\ncolonial self-government, and law was on the side of George III. But\r\nthings that are lawful are not always expedient, and legal\r\njustification is no proof of wisdom or statesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe English people supported George III until he had failed; but there\r\nwas not much enthusiasm for the war, except at places like Birmingham,\r\nwhich possessed a small-arms manufactory and other stimulants to\r\npatriotic fervour. It was badly mismanaged by George, and Whigs did\r\ntheir best to hamper his efforts, fearing, with some reason, that\r\nsuccess in North America would encourage despotic enterprise at home.\r\nGeorge would, however, in all probability have won but for the\r\nintervention of France and Spain (1778-1779), who hoped to wipe off the\r\nscores of the Seven Years' War, and for the armed neutrality of Russia\r\nand Holland (1780), who resented the arrogant claims of the British to\r\nright of search on the high seas. At the critical moment Britain lost\r\nthe command of the sea; and although Rodney's naval victory (1782) and\r\nthe successful defence of Gibraltar (1779-1783) enabled her to obtain\r\ntolerable terms from her European enemies, American independence had to\r\nbe granted (1783). For Ireland was on the verge of revolt, and British\r\ndominion in India was shaken to its foundations. So the two great\r\nsections of the English people parted company, perhaps to their mutual\r\nprofit. Certainly each government has now enough to do without solving\r\nthe other's problems, and it is well-nigh impossible to conceive a\r\nstate maintaining its equilibrium or its equanimity with two such\r\npartners as the British Empire and the United States struggling for\r\npredominance within it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Warren Hastings saved the situation in India by means that\r\nwere above the Oriental but below the normal English standard of\r\nmorality. He was impeached for his pains later on by the Whigs, whose\r\nmoral indignation was sharpened by resentment at the use of Anglo-\r\nIndian gold to defeat them at the general election of 1784. Ireland was\r\nplacated by the grant of legislative independence (1782), a concession\r\nboth too wide and too narrow to provide any real solution of her\r\ndifficulties. It was too wide because Grattan's parliament, as it is\r\ncalled, was co-ordinate with, and not subordinate to, the imperial\r\nparliament; and there was thus no supreme authority to settle\r\ndifferences, which sooner or later were bound to arise between the two.\r\nIt was too narrow, because the Irish executive remained responsible to\r\nDowning Street and not to the Irish parliament. The parliament,\r\nmoreover, did not represent the Irish people; Catholics were excluded\r\nfrom it, and until 1793 were denied the vote; sixty seats were in the\r\nhands of three families, and a majority of the members were returned by\r\npocket-boroughs. A more hopeless want of system can hardly be imagined:\r\na corrupt aristocracy, a ferocious commonalty, a distracted government,\r\na divided people--such was the verdict of a contemporary politician. At\r\nlength, after a Protestant revolt in Ulster, a Catholic rising in the\r\nsouth, and a French invasion, Pitt bribed and cajoled the borough-\r\nmongers to consent to union with Great Britain (1800). Thirty-two Irish\r\npeers, twenty-eight temporal and four spiritual, were to sit in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and a hundred Irish members in the House of Commons.\r\nThe realization of the prospect of Roman Catholic Emancipation, which\r\nhad been held out as a further consideration, was postponed by the\r\nprejudices of George III until its saving grace had been lost.\r\nGrattan's prophecy of retribution for the destruction of Irish liberty\r\nhas often been quoted: \"We will avenge ourselves,\" he said, \"by sending\r\ninto the ranks of your parliament, and into the very heart of your\r\nconstitution, one hundred of the greatest scoundrels in the kingdom\";\r\nbut it is generally forgotten that he had in mind the kind of members\r\nnominated by peers and borough-mongers to represent them in an\r\nunreformed House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the American colonies threw a shadow over British colonial\r\nenterprise which had some lasting effects on the colonial policy of the\r\nmother-country. The severance did not, as is often supposed, convince\r\nGreat Britain that the grant of self-government to colonies was the\r\nonly means to retain them. But they had been esteemed mainly as markets\r\nfor British exports, and the discovery that British exports to America\r\nincreased, instead of diminishing, after the grant of independence,\r\nraised doubts about the value of colonies which explain the comparative\r\nindifference of public opinion towards them during the next half-\r\ncentury. For the commercial conception of empire was still in the\r\nascendant; and if the landed interest controlled the domestic politics\r\nof the eighteenth century, the commercial interest determined the\r\noutlines of British expansion. Territory was acquired or strongholds\r\nseized in order to provide markets and guard trade communications.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view India became, after the loss of the American\r\ncolonies, the dominant factor in British external policy. The monetary\r\nvalue of India to the British far exceeded that of all their other\r\nforeign possessions put together. The East India Company's servants\r\noften amassed huge fortunes in a few years, and the influence of this\r\nwealth upon British politics became very apparent in the last quarter\r\nof the century. It put up the price of parliamentary pocket-boroughs,\r\nand thus delayed reform; it enabled commercial men to force their way\r\ninto the House of Lords by the side of landed magnates, and the younger\r\nPitt doubled its numbers in his efforts to win the political support of\r\nthe moneyed classes; and finally, it affected consciously or\r\nunconsciously men's views of the interests of the empire and of the\r\npolicy to be pursued to serve them.\r\n\r\nThe half-century which followed the American War of Independence was\r\nnot, indeed, barren of results in other directions than those indicated\r\nby the East India Company. Canada was saved from the seductions of\r\nAmerican independence by a wise recognition of its established customs\r\nand religion (1774), and was strengthened by the influx of United\r\nEmpire Loyalists who would not bow the knee to republican separatism.\r\nProvision was made for the government of these some what discordant\r\nelements by dividing Canada into two provinces, one predominantly\r\nFrench, the other British, and giving each a legislature for the\r\nvoicing of its grievances (1791). So, too, the impulse of the Seven\r\nYears' War survived the War of Independence in other quarters of the\r\nglobe. Naval officers, released from war-like operations, were sent to\r\nexplore the Pacific; and, among them, Captain James Cook surveyed the\r\ncoasts of Australia and New Zealand (1770). The enthusiastic naturalist\r\nof the expedition, Joseph Banks, persistently sang the praises of\r\nBotany Bay; but the new acquisition was used as a convict settlement\r\n(1788), which was hardly a happy method of extending British\r\ncivilization. The origin of Australia differed from that of New\r\nEngland, in that the Pilgrim Fathers wanted to avoid the mother-\r\ncountry; while the mother-country wanted to avoid the convicts; but in\r\nneither case was there any imperialism in the aversion.\r\n\r\nIndia was, in fact, the chief outlet at that period for British\r\nimperial sentiment. It is true that Great Britain laid down in solemn\r\nofficial language, in 1784, that the acquisition of territory was\r\nrepugnant to the principles of British government. But so had Frederick\r\nthe Great begun his career by writing a refutation of Machiavelli;\r\ncircumstances, and something within which made for empire, proved too\r\nstrong for liberal intentions, and the only British war waged between\r\nthe Peace of Versailles in 1783 and the rupture with Revolutionary\r\nFrance in 1793 resulted in the dismemberment of Tippoo Sultan's kingdom\r\nof Mysore (1792). The crusading truculence of the French republicans,\r\nand Napoleon's ambition, made the security of the British Isles Pitt's\r\nfirst consideration; but when that was confirmed by naval victories\r\nover the French on the 1st of June, 1794, and at the battle of the Nile\r\nin 1798, over the Dutch at Camperdown and over the Spaniards at Cape\r\nSt. Vincent in 1797, over the Danes at Copenhagen in 1801, and over the\r\nFrench and Spaniards combined at Trafalgar in 1805, Great Britain\r\nconcentrated its energies mainly on extending its hold on India and the\r\nFar East, and on strengthening its communications with them. The\r\npurpose of the battle of the Nile was to evict Napoleon from Egypt,\r\nwhich he had occupied as a stepping-stone to India, and Malta was\r\nseized (1800) with a similar object. Mauritius, too, was taken (1810),\r\nbecause it had formed a profitable basis of operations for French\r\nprivateers against the East India trade; and the Cape of Good Hope was\r\nconquered from the Dutch, the reluctant allies of the French, in 1795,\r\nas a better half-way house to India than St. Helena, which England had\r\nacquired from the same colonial rivals in 1673. The Cape was restored\r\nin 1802, but reconquered in 1806 and retained in 1815.\r\n\r\nIn the Far East, British dominion was rapidly extended under the\r\nstimulus of the Marquess Wellesley, elder brother of the Duke of\r\nWellington, who endeavoured in redundantly eloquent despatches to\r\nreconcile his deeds with the pacific tone of his instructions. Ceylon\r\nwas taken from the Dutch in 1796, and was not restored like Java, which\r\nsuffered a similar conquest; and British settlements were soon\r\nafterwards founded at Singapore and on the Malay Peninsula. In India\r\nitself Tippoo was defeated and slain in his capital at Seringapatam in\r\n1799, the Mahrattas were crushed at Assye and Argaum in 1803, the nabob\r\nwas forced to surrender the Carnatic, and the vizier the province of\r\nOudh, until the whole coast-line of India and the valley of the Ganges\r\nhad passed directly or indirectly under British control. These regions\r\nwere conquered partly because they were more attractive and accessible\r\nto the British, and partly to prevent their being accessible to the\r\nFrench; the poorer and more difficult mountainous districts of the\r\nDeccan, isolated from foreign infection, were left under native rulers.\r\n\r\nThe final overthrow of Napoleon, to which Great Britain had contributed\r\nmore by its efforts in the Spanish Peninsular War (1808-1814) than at\r\nthe crowning mercy of Waterloo, confirmed its conquests in India and\r\nits control of the trade routes of the world. Its one permanent failure\r\nduring the war was Whitelocke's expedition to Buenos Ayres in 1807;\r\nthat attack was not repeated because the Spaniards having, by their\r\nrevolt against Napoleon, become England's allies, it was hardly fair to\r\nappropriate their colonies; and so South America was left to work out\r\nits destinies under Latin and not Teutonic influence. Most of the West\r\nIndian islands, however, with British Honduras and British Guiana on\r\nthe mainland, had been acquired for the empire, which had now secured\r\nfootholds in all the continents of the world. The development of those\r\nfootholds into great self-governing communities, the unique and real\r\nachievement of the British Empire, was the work of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; and its accomplishment depended upon the effects of the\r\nchanges known to us as the Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Revolution is a phrase invented by Arnold Toynbee, and\r\nnow generally used to indicate those economic changes which turned\r\nEngland from an agricultural into an industrial community. The period\r\nduring which these changes took place cannot from the nature of things\r\nbe definitely fixed; but usually it is taken to extend from about the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century to the close of the reign of George\r\nIII. Two points, however, must be remembered: first, that there was a\r\ncommercial as well as an agricultural and an industrial stage of\r\ndevelopment; and secondly, that this period contains merely the central\r\nand crucial years of a process of specialization and expansion which\r\noccupied centuries of English economic history. There was also before\r\nthe agricultural stage a pastoral stage; but that lies beyond the scope\r\nof English history, because both the English people and the Celts they\r\nconquered had passed out of the pastoral stage before recorded English\r\nhistory begins. Each of these stages corresponds to a different social\r\norganization: the pastoral stage was patriarchal, the agricultural\r\nstage was feudal, the commercial stage was plutocratic, and the\r\nindustrial stage leads towards democracy. The stages, of course,\r\noverlap one another, and every national community to-day is partly\r\npastoral, partly agricultural, partly commercial, and partly\r\nindustrial. We can only call a nation any one of these things in the\r\nsense that they denote its dominant characteristic.\r\n\r\nThis evolution has been the result of man's increasing control over\r\nnature. In the pastoral stage he takes of the produce of nature,\r\nproviding little or nothing himself. In the agricultural stage he\r\nmanipulates the soil and subdues it, he harnesses the wind and the\r\nstreams to grind his corn, and to water his land; Providence may have\r\nplaced all things under his feet, but he takes long to discover their\r\nuse and the means to use them. In the commercial and industrial stages\r\nhe employs the wind and water, steam and electricity, for transport,\r\ncommunications, and manufactures. But he can only develop this mastery\r\nby the interdependent processes of specialization, co-operation, and\r\nexpansion. A lonely shepherd can live on his flocks without help; a\r\nsingle family can provide for its own agricultural subsistence, and the\r\nnormal holding of the primitive English family, the \"hide\" as it was\r\ncalled, was really a share in all the means of livelihood, corn-land,\r\npasture-land, rights of common and of cutting wood. This family\r\nindependence long survived, and home-brewing, home-baking, home-\r\nwashing, are not even now extinct. Each family in the primitive village\r\ndid everything for itself. When its needs and standard of comfort grew,\r\nincreased facilities beyond the reach of the individual household were\r\nprovided by the lord of the manor, as, for instance, a mill, a\r\nbakehouse, a wine-press. Indeed, the possession of these things may\r\nhave helped him into the lordship of the manor. Certainly, some of them\r\nare mentioned in early Anglo-Saxon days among the qualifications for\r\nthegnhood, and when the lord possessed these things, he claimed a\r\nmonopoly; his tenants were bound to grind their corn at his mill, and\r\nso forth. But there were things he did not care to do, and a villager\r\nhere and there began to specialize in such trades as the blacksmith's,\r\ncarpenter's, and mason's. This specialization involved co-operation and\r\nthe expansion of household economy into village economy. Others must do\r\nthe blacksmith's sowing and reaping, while he did the shoeing for the\r\nwhole village.\r\n\r\nThus village industries grew up, and in unprogressive countries, such\r\nas India, where, owing to distance and lack of communications, villages\r\nwere isolated and self-sufficing, this village economy became\r\nstereotyped, and the village trades hereditary. But in western Europe,\r\nas order was slowly evolved after the chaos of the Dark Ages,\r\ncommunications and trade-routes were opened up; and whole villages\r\nbegan to specialize in certain industries, leaving other commodities to\r\nbe produced by other communities. For the exchange of these commodities\r\nmarkets and fairs were established at various convenient centres; and\r\nthis in turn led to the specialization of traders and merchants, who\r\ndid not make, but only arranged for the barter of, manufactures.\r\nThrough the development of local industries and markets, villages grew\r\ninto towns, and towns expanded with the extent of the area they\r\nsupplied. A town which supplied a nation with cutlery, for instance,\r\nwas necessarily bigger than a town which only supplied a county. This\r\nexpansion of markets meant that towns and cities were more and more\r\nspecializing in some one or more industries, leaving the great majority\r\nof their needs to be supplied from elsewhere; and the whole process was\r\nbased on the growing complexity of civilization, on the multiplying\r\nnumber of implements required to do the work of the world.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively simple organization of feudal society broke down\r\nunder the stress of these changes; a middle class, consisting of\r\nneither lords nor villeins, was needed to cope with industry and\r\ncommerce. Handworkers also were required, so that from the middle of\r\nthe fourteenth century we find a regular flight from the land to the\r\ntowns in progress. Another great change took place. No one had been\r\nrich according to modern notions in the early Middle Ages, and no one\r\nhad been destitute; there was no need of a Poor Law. But with the\r\nexpansion of the sphere of men's operations, the differences between\r\nthe poor and the rich began to increase. There is little to choose\r\nbetween a slow runner and a swift when the race covers only ten yards;\r\nthere is more when it covers a hundred, and a great deal when it covers\r\na mile. So, too, when operations are limited to the village market,\r\nability has a limited scope, and the able financier does not grow so\r\nvery much richer than his neighbour. But when his market comprises a\r\nnation, his means for acquiring wealth are extended; the rich become\r\nricher, and the poor, comparatively at any rate, poorer. Hence, when in\r\nthe fourteenth and following centuries the national market expands into\r\na world market, we find growing up side by side capitalism and\r\ndestitution; and the reason why there are so many millionaires and so\r\nmuch destitution to-day, compared with earlier times, is that the world\r\nis now one market, and the range of operations is only limited by the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe control of the world's supplies tends to get into the hands of a\r\nfew big producers or operators instead of being in the hands of a vast\r\nnumber of small ones; and this has come about through ever-expanding\r\nmarkets and ever-increasing specialization. Even whole nations\r\nspecialize more or less; some produce the corn-supply of the world,\r\nsome its coal, some its oil, and some do its carrying trade. It is now\r\na question whether there should not be some limits to this process, and\r\nit is asked whether a nation or empire should not be self-supporting,\r\nirrespective of the economic advantages of expansion and\r\nspecialization, and of the fact that the more self-supporting it is,\r\nthe less trade can it do with others; for it cannot export unless it\r\nimports, and if each nation makes everything it wants itself it will\r\nneither sell to, nor buy from, other nations.\r\n\r\nThere have been two periods in English history during which these\r\ngeneral tendencies have been especially marked. One was at the close of\r\nthe Middle Ages, and the other during the reign of George III. The\r\nbreak-up of the manorial system, the growth of a body of mobile labour,\r\nand of capital seeking investment, the discovery of new worlds and new\r\nmarkets, heralded the advent of the middle class and of the commercial\r\nage. Custom, which had regulated most things in the Middle Ages, gave\r\nway to competition, which defied all regulation; and England became a\r\nnation of privateers, despoiling the church, Spain, Ireland, and often\r\nthe commonwealth itself. Scores of acts against fraudulent\r\nmanufacturers and against inclosures were passed in vain, because they\r\nran counter to economic conditions. The products of the new factories,\r\nlike Jack of Newbury's kerseys, could not equal in quality the older\r\nhome-made article, because the home-made article was produced under\r\nnon-economic conditions. Spinsters today knit better garments than\r\nthose turned out in bulk, because neither time nor money is any\r\nconsideration with them; they knit for occupation, not for a living,\r\nand they can afford to devote more labour to their produce than they\r\ncould possibly do if they depended upon it for subsistence. The case\r\nwas the same with the home-products of earlier times, and compared with\r\nthem the newer factory-product was shoddy; because, if the manufacturer\r\nwas to earn a living from his industry he must produce a certain\r\nquantity within a limited time. These by-products of the home were\r\nenabled to hold their own against the factory products until the\r\ndevelopment of machinery in the eighteenth century; and until that time\r\nthe factory system, although factories existed on a rudimentary scale,\r\ndid not fully develop. So far as it did develop, it meant an increase\r\nin the efficiency and in the total wealth of the nation, but a decrease\r\nin the prosperity of thousands of individual households.\r\n\r\nThe effect of inclosures was very similar. The old system of the\r\nvillagers cultivating in turn strips of land in open fields was\r\nundoubtedly unsound, if the amount of wealth produced is the sole\r\ncriterion; but it produced enough for the individual village-community,\r\nand the increased production accruing from inclosures went to swell the\r\ntotal wealth of the nation and of those who manipulated it at the cost\r\nof the tillers of the soil. The cost to the community was potential\r\nrather than actual; common lands which are now worth millions were\r\nappropriated by landlords in defiance of the law. This illegality was\r\nremedied in 1549, not by stopping the inclosures but by making them\r\nlegal, provided that \"sufficient\" commons were left; if the incloser\r\nconsidered his leavings enough, the gainsaying of the tenants was to be\r\nignored, or punished as treason or felony in case of persistence.\r\nEngland, however, was still fairly big for its three or four millions\r\nof souls, and an Act of Queen Elizabeth provided that every new cottage\r\nbuilt should stand in four acres of its own. This anticipation of the\r\ndemand for three acres and a cow did something to check excessive\r\nspecialization; for the tenants of these cottages added a little\r\ncultivation on their own account to their occupations as hired\r\nlabourers or village artisans. In the seventeenth century the land-\r\nhunger of the landlords was generally sated by schemes for draining and\r\nembanking; and vast tracts of fen and marsh, such as Hatfield Chase and\r\nBedford Level, were thus brought under cultivation.\r\n\r\nCommerce rather than industrialism or agriculture is the distinctive\r\nfeature of English economy during the seventeenth and first half of the\r\neighteenth century. By means of newly developed trade-routes, the East\r\nand the West were tapped for such products as tobacco, tea, coffee,\r\ncocoa, sugar, rum, spices, oranges, lemons, raisins, currants, silks,\r\ncotton, rice, and others with which England had previously somehow or\r\nother dispensed; and the principal bone of contention was the carrying\r\ntrade of the world. Shipbuilding was the most famous English industry;\r\nand when Peter the Great visited England, he spent most of his time in\r\nthe Deptford yards. For some of these imports England paid by her\r\nservices as carrier; and so far as India was concerned it was a case of\r\nrobbery rather than exchange. But exports were more and more required\r\nto pay for the ever-increasing imports. It is impossible to state\r\ncategorically either that the imports provoked the exports or the\r\nexports the imports; for the supply creates the demand as much as the\r\ndemand creates the supply. There can have been no conscious demand for\r\ntobacco in England before any Englishman had smoked a pipe; and when an\r\nEnglish merchant in Elizabeth's reign took a thousand kerseys to\r\nBokhara, he did so without waiting for an order. Both exports and\r\nimports, however, can only develop together; the dimensions to which\r\nEnglish commerce had attained by Walpole's time involved exports as\r\nwell as imports; and the exports could not have been provided without\r\ndeveloping English industries.\r\n\r\nIn particular, England had to export to the colonies because the\r\ncolonies had by the Navigation Acts to export to England; and Walpole's\r\nabolition or reduction of duties on colonial produce illustrated and\r\nencouraged the growth of this trade. In return for colonial tobacco,\r\nrice, cotton, sugar, England sent chiefly woollen and afterwards cotton\r\nmanufactures. These woollens had long been manufactured on the domestic\r\nsystem in the sheep-rearing districts of England, particularly\r\nYorkshire; many a cottage with its four acres for farming had also its\r\nspinning-wheel, and many a village its loom; and the cloth when\r\nfinished was conveyed by pack-horses or waggons to the markets and\r\nfairs to be sold for export or home consumption. But between 1764 and\r\n1779 a series of inventions by Arkwright, Hargreaves, and Crompton,\r\ntransformed the simple spinning-wheel into an elaborate machine capable\r\nof doing the work of many spinners; and once more an advance in\r\nnational productivity was made at the expense of the individual workers\r\nwho took to breaking the machines to stop their loss of work.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes followed in cotton-spinning and other industries, and\r\nthe result was to alter the whole economic structure of England. The\r\ncottager could not afford the new and expensive machinery, and his\r\nspinning-wheels and hand-looms were hopelessly beaten in the\r\ncompetition. Huge factories were required for the new inventions, where\r\nthe workers were all huddled together instead of working in their\r\nscattered homes; and large populations grew up around these new and\r\nartificial manufacturing centres. Their locality was, however,\r\ndetermined by natural causes; at first water-power was the best\r\navailable force to drive the new machines, and consequently towns\r\nsprang up along the banks of rivers. But Watt's application of steam-\r\npower to machinery soon supplanted water; and for steam-power coal and\r\niron were the greatest necessities. Factories therefore tended to\r\ncongregate where coal and iron were found; and the need for these\r\nmaterials created the coal and iron industries. Moreover, the pack-\r\nhorse, the waggon, and the old unmetalled roads soon proved inadequate\r\nfor the new requirements of transport. For a time canals became the\r\nfavourite substitute, and many were constructed. Then Macadam invented\r\nhis method of making roads; finally, Stephenson developed the steam\r\nlocomotive, and the railway system came into existence.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with these changes was a renewal of the inclosure\r\nmovement. The introduction of turnips and other roots, and the\r\ndevelopment of the rotation of crops increased the value of the soil\r\nand revived the stimulus to inclosure; and hundreds of inclosure acts\r\nwere hurriedly passed by a parliament which contained no\r\nrepresentatives of those who suffered from the process. It was assisted\r\nby the further specialization consequent upon the industrial\r\nrevolution; while the agricultural labourer gave up spinning under the\r\nstress of factory competition, the spinner deserted his cottage and\r\nfour acres in the country, to seek a dwelling near the factory which\r\nemployed him; and the Elizabethan Act, insisting upon the allocation of\r\nfour acres to each new cottage built, was repealed. But for that\r\nrepeal, factory slums would be garden cities, unless the incubus of\r\nthis provision had stopped the factory development. The final result of\r\nthe inclosure movement upon the country was to deprive the public of\r\nmost of its commons and open spaces, to deprive the agricultural\r\nlabourer of all right in the soil he tilled, and to rob him of that\r\nmagic of property which, in Arthur Young's phrase, turned sand into\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable adjustment of the population to these altered economic\r\nconditions entirely changed its distribution. Hitherto the progressive\r\nand predominant parts of England had been the south and east;\r\nconservatism found its refuge in the north and west, which rebelled\r\nagainst the Tudors and fought for Charles I. The south and east had\r\nbeen the manufacturing centres because iron was smelted with wood and\r\nnot with coal. Now that coal was substituted for wood, the\r\njuxtaposition of coal and iron mines in the north attracted thither the\r\nindustries of the nation, while the special features of its climate\r\nmade South Lancashire the home of cotton-spinning. The balance of\r\npopulation and political power followed. To-day southern England, apart\r\nfrom London and some other ports, hardly does more than subsist, and\r\nits occupations are largely parasitic. The work and the wealth and the\r\ntrade which support the empire and its burdens have their origin and\r\nbeing in the north.\r\n\r\nThe population not only shifted, but rapidly increased. The uprooting\r\nof peasants from their little plots of land which acted in medieval\r\nEngland and acts to-day in France as a check upon breeding, and their\r\nherding in crowded tenements, weakened both moral and prudential\r\nrestraints in the towns; while in the country the well-meant but ill-\r\nconsidered action of the justices of the peace in supplementing the\r\nbeggarly wages of the labourers by grants out of the rates proportioned\r\nto the number of each man's children produced a similar effect. The\r\nresult was an increase in the population welcome to patriots who hoped\r\nfor hordes of soldiers and sailors to fight Napoleon, but startling to\r\neconomists like Malthus, who inferred therefrom a natural law\r\nconstraining population to outrun the earth's increase. Malthus did not\r\nforesee the needs of the empire, nor realize that the rapid growth in\r\nthe population of his day was largely due to the absence from the\r\nproletariate of a standard of comfort and decency. Without the\r\nIndustrial Revolution Great Britain would not have been able to people\r\nthe lands she had marked for her own.\r\n\r\nThis increase and shifting of the people put the finishing touch to the\r\nincongruities of the old political system, in which vast centres of\r\npopulation teeming with life and throbbing with industry were\r\nunrepresented, while members sat in parliament for boroughs so decayed\r\nthat nothing was left of them but a green mound, a park, or a ruined\r\nwall. The struggle with the French Revolution and then with Napoleon\r\ngave the vested interests a respite from their doom; and for seventeen\r\nyears after its close the Tories sat, clothed in the departing glories\r\nof the war, upon the safety-valve of constitutional reform. Then in\r\n1832, after one general election fought on this issue, and after\r\nfurther resistance by the House of Lords on behalf of the liberties of\r\nborough-proprietors and faggot-voters, the threat to create peers\r\ninduced a number to abstain sufficient to ensure the passing of the\r\nfirst Reform Bill. It was a moderate measure to have brought the\r\ncountry to the verge of political revolution; roughly, it disfranchised\r\na number of poor voters, but enfranchised the mass of the middle and\r\nlower middle-class. Absolutely rotten boroughs were abolished, but a\r\nlarge number of very small ones were retained, and the representation\r\nof the new towns was somewhat grudging and restricted. A more drastic\r\nmeasure, giving the vote to most of the town artisans was--being\r\nintroduced by a Tory minister, Disraeli, in 1867--passed by the House\r\nof Lords without difficulty. The last alteration of the franchise,\r\ngiving the vote to agricultural labourers was--being introduced by\r\nGladstone in 1884--only passed by the House of Lords at the second time\r\nof asking and after an agitation.\r\n\r\nPolitical emancipation was but one of the results of the Industrial\r\nRevolution; commercial expansion was another. England had now\r\ndefinitely and decisively specialized in certain industries; she could\r\nonly do so by relying upon external sources for her supply of other\r\nwants. The more her new industries gave her to export, the more she\r\nrequired to import from customers upon whose wealth her own prosperity\r\ndepended. In particular, England became dependent upon foreign\r\nproducers for her food supplies. During the war the foreign supply of\r\ncorn was so hampered that it was as dear to import as to grow at home;\r\nbut after the peace the price began to fall, and the farmers and\r\nlandlords, whose rents depended ultimately upon the price of corn,\r\ndemanded protection corresponding to that which extensive tariffs on\r\nimported articles gave to the manufacturers. The manufacturers, on the\r\nother hand, wanted cheap food for their workpeople in order to be able\r\nto pay them low wages. As a compromise, the Corn Laws of 1814 and 1828\r\nprovided a sliding scale of duties which rose as prices fell, and fell\r\nas prices rose, a preference being given to colonial wheat.\r\n\r\nThe Reform Act of 1832, however, and the rapid increase of\r\nmanufactures, transferred the balance of power in parliament from the\r\nlanded to the manufacturing classes; factory hands were persuaded that\r\nthe repeal of the duties would largely increase the value of their\r\nwages; and the failure of the potato-crop in Ireland in 1845-46\r\nrendered an increase of imported food-stuffs imperative. Sir Robert\r\nPeel accordingly carried a measure in 1846 providing for the gradual\r\nabolition of the corn-duties, saving only a registration duty of one\r\nshilling, which was removed some twenty years later. This repeal of the\r\nCorn Laws did not appreciably affect the price of corn, the great\r\nreduction of which was subsequently effected by the vast expansion of\r\ncorn-growing areas in the colonies and abroad. But it enormously\r\nincreased the supply at once, and gradually gave England the full\r\nbenefit of growing areas and declining prices. It is obvious that the\r\nretention of the duty, which had been fixed at 24_s_. 8_d_. in 1828\r\nwhen the price was 62_s_. or less a quarter, would have prevented\r\nprices falling as they subsequently did below the value of the duty;\r\nand it is no less certain that it would have impeded the development of\r\ncorn-growing districts in the colonies and abroad, and of British\r\nimports from, and exports to, them.\r\n\r\nThe enormous increase in the import of corn helped, in fact, to double\r\nBritish exports within ten years. This was the result of the general\r\nfreeing of trade, of which the repeal of the Corn Laws was only a part.\r\nIn the third quarter of the eighteenth century there were hundreds of\r\nActs, covering thousands of pages, on the statute-book, imposing an\r\ninfinity of chaotic duties on every kind of import; they made the\r\ncustoms costly to collect and easy to evade; and the industry they\r\nstimulated most was smuggling. The younger Pitt, influenced by Adam\r\nSmith, whose _Wealth of Nations_ appeared in 1776, reduced and\r\nsimplified these duties; but 443 Acts still survived when in 1825\r\nHuskisson and other enlightened statesmen secured their consolidation\r\nand reduction to eleven. This Tariff Reform, as its supporters called\r\nit, was a step towards Free Trade. Peel gradually adopted its\r\nprinciples, induced partly by the failure of his efforts to use\r\nexisting duties for purposes of retaliation; and between 1841 and 1846\r\nhe abolished the duties on 605 articles and reduced them on 1035 more,\r\nimposing a direct income-tax to replace the indirect taxes thus\r\nrepealed. The process was completed by Gladstone, and what is called\r\nFree Trade was established as the fundamental principle of English\r\nfinancial policy.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that no duties are imposed on exports or imports; it\r\nsimply means that such duties as are levied are imposed for the sake of\r\nrevenue, and to protect neither the consumer from the export of\r\ncommodities he desires to purchase, nor the manufacturer from the\r\nimport of those he wishes to make. The great interests connected with\r\nland and manufactures had ceased to hang together, and fell separately.\r\nProtection of manufactured goods did not long survive the successful\r\nattack which manufacturers had levelled against the protected produce\r\nof the landlords and the farmers. The repeal of the Navigation Acts\r\nrounded off the system; British shipping, indeed, needed no protection,\r\nbut the admission of colonial goods free of duty and the removal of the\r\nembargo on their trade with foreign countries may not have compensated\r\nthe colonies for the loss of their preference in the British market.\r\nThe whole trend of affairs, however, both conscious and unconscious,\r\nwas to make the world one vast hive of industry, instead of an infinite\r\nnumber of self-sufficient, separate hives; the village market had\r\nexpanded into the provincial market, the provincial into the national,\r\nthe national into the imperial, and the imperial into the world market.\r\n\r\nWe have not by any means exhausted the results of the Industrial\r\nRevolution, and most of our social problems may be traced directly or\r\nindirectly to this source. Its most general effect was to emphasize and\r\nexaggerate the tendency towards specialization. Not only have most\r\nworkers now but one kind of work; that work becomes a smaller and\r\nsmaller part of increasingly complex industrial processes; and\r\nconcentration thereon makes it more and more difficult for the worker\r\nto turn to other labour, if his employment fails. The specialist's lack\r\nof all-round capacity is natural and notorious. Hence most serious\r\nresults follow the slightest dislocation of national economy. This\r\nspecialization has also important psychological effects. A farmer, with\r\nhis varied outdoor occupations, feels little craving for relief and\r\nrelaxation. The factory hand, with his attention riveted for hours at a\r\nstretch on the wearisome iteration of machinery, requires recreation\r\nand distraction: naturally he is a prey to unwholesome stimulants, such\r\nas drink, betting, or the yellow press. The more educated and morally\r\nrestrained, however, seek intellectual stimulus, and the modern popular\r\ndemand for culture arises largely from the need of something to relieve\r\nthe grey monotony of industrial labour.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the problems of poverty, local government, and sanitation have\r\nbeen created or intensified by the Industrial Revolution. It made\r\ncapitalists of the few and wage-earners of the many; and the tendency\r\nof wages towards a minimum and of hours of labour towards a maximum has\r\nonly been counteracted by painful organization among the workers, and\r\nlater on by legislation extorted by their votes. Neither the\r\nEvangelical nor the Oxford movement proved any prophylactic against the\r\nimmorality of commercial and industrial creeds. While those two\r\nreligious movements were at their height, new centres of industrial\r\npopulation were allowed to grow up without the least regard for health\r\nor decency. Under the influence of _laissez-faire_ philosophy, each\r\nwretched slum-dweller was supposed to be capable, after his ten or\r\ntwelve hours in the factory, of looking after his own and his\r\nchildren's education, his main-drainage, his risks from infection, and\r\nthe purity of his food and his water-supply. The old system of local\r\ngovernment was utterly inadequate and ill adapted to the new\r\nconditions; and the social and physical environment of the working\r\nclasses was a disgrace to civilization pending the reconstruction of\r\nsociety, still incomplete, which the Industrial Revolution imposed upon\r\nthe country in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA CENTURY OF EMPIRE\r\n\r\n1815-1911\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British realms beyond the seas have little history before the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, a date at which the Englishman's historical\r\neducation has commonly come to an end; and if by chance it has gone any\r\nfurther, it has probably been confined to purely domestic events or to\r\nforeign episodes of such ephemeral interest as the Crimean War. It may\r\nbe well, therefore, to pass lightly over these matters in order to\r\nsketch in brief outline the development of the empire and the problems\r\nwhich it involves. European affairs, in fact, played a very subordinate\r\npart in English history after 1815; so far as England was concerned, it\r\nwas a period of excursions and alarms rather than actual hostilities;\r\nand the fortunes of English-speaking communities were not greatly\r\naffected by the revolutions and wars which made and marred continental\r\nnations, a circumstance which explains, if it does not excuse, the\r\nalmost total ignorance of European history displayed in British\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThe interventions of Britain in continental politics were generally on\r\nbehalf of the principles of nationality and self-government. Under the\r\ninfluence of Castlereagh and Canning the British government gradually\r\nbroke away from the Holy Alliance formed to suppress all protests\r\nagainst the settlement reached after Napoleon's fall; and Britain\r\ninterposed with decisive effect at the battle of Navarino in 1827,\r\nwhich secured the independence of Greece from Turkey. More diplomatic\r\nintervention assisted the South American colonies to assert their\r\nindependence of the Spanish mother-country; and British volunteers\r\nhelped the Liberal cause in Spain and Portugal against reactionary\r\nmonarchs. Belgium was countenanced in its successful revolution against\r\nthe House of Orange, and Italian states in their revolts against native\r\nand foreign despots; the expulsion of the Hapsburgs and Bourbons from\r\nItaly, and its unification on a nationalist basis, owed something to\r\nBritish diplomacy, which supported Cavour, and to British volunteers\r\nwho fought for Garibaldi. The attitude of Britain towards the Balkan\r\nnationalities, which were endeavouring to throw off the Turkish yoke,\r\nwas more dubious; while Gladstone denounced Turkish atrocities,\r\nDisraeli strengthened Turkey's hands. Yet England would have been as\r\nenthusiastic for a liberated and united Balkan power as it had been for\r\na united Italy but for the claims of a rival liberator, Russia.\r\n\r\nRussia was the bugbear of two generations of Englishmen; and classical\r\nscholars, who interpreted modern politics by the light of ancient\r\nGreece, saw in the absorption of Athens by Macedon a convincing\r\ndemonstration of the fate which the modern barbarian of the north was\r\nto inflict upon the British heirs of Hellas. India was the real source\r\nof this nervousness. British dominion, after further wars with the\r\nMahrattas, the Sikhs, and the Gurkhas, had extended up to the frontiers\r\nof Afghanistan; but there was always the fear lest another sword should\r\ntake away dominion won by the British, and in British eyes it was an\r\noffence that any other power should expand in Asia. The Russian and\r\nBritish spheres of influence advanced till they met in Kabul; and for\r\nfifty years the two powers contested, by more or less diplomatic\r\nmethods, the control of the Amir of Afghanistan. Turkey flanked the\r\noverland route to India; and hence the protection of Turkey against\r\nRussia became a cardinal point in British foreign policy. On behalf of\r\nTurkey's integrity Great Britain fought, in alliance with France and\r\nSardinia, the futile Crimean War of 1854-1856, and nearly went to war\r\nin 1877.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 introduced a fresh complication.\r\nRelations between England and France had since Waterloo been friendly,\r\non the whole; but France had traditional interests in Egypt, which were\r\nstrengthened by the fact that a French engineer had constructed the\r\nSuez Canal, and by French colonies in the Far East, to which the canal\r\nwas the shortest route. Rivalry with England for the control of Egypt\r\nfollowed. The Dual Control, which was established in 1876, was\r\nterminated by the refusal of France to assist in the suppression of\r\nEgyptian revolts in 1882; and Great Britain was left in sole but\r\ninformal possession of power in Egypt, with the responsibility for its\r\ndefence against the Mahdi (1884-1885) and for the re-conquest of the\r\nSudan (1896-1898), which is now under the joint Egyptian and British\r\nflags.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, British expansion to the east of India, the Burmese wars,\r\nand annexation of Burma (1885) brought the empire into a contact with\r\nFrench influence in Siam similar to its contact with Russian in\r\nAfghanistan. Community of interests in the Far East, as well as the\r\nneed of protection against the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and\r\nItaly produced the _entente cordiale_ between France and Russia in\r\n1890. Fortunately, the dangerous questions between them and Great\r\nBritain were settled by diplomacy, assisted by the alliance between\r\nGreat Britain and Japan. The British and Russian spheres of action on\r\nthe north-west, and the British and French spheres to the east, of\r\nIndia were delimited; southern Persia, the Persian Gulf, and the Malay\r\nPeninsula were left to British vigilance and penetration, northern\r\nPersia to Russian, and eastern Siam to French. Freed from these causes\r\nof friction, Great Britain, Russia, and France exert a restraining\r\ninfluence on the predominant partner in the Triple Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe development of a vast dominion in India has created for the British\r\ngovernment problems, of which the great Indian mutiny of 1857 was\r\nmerely one illustration. No power has succeeded in permanently\r\ngoverning subject races by despotic authority; in North and South\r\nAmerica the natives have so dwindled in numbers as to leave the\r\nconquerors indisputably supreme; in Europe and elsewhere in former\r\ntimes the subject races fitted themselves for self-government, and then\r\nabsorbed their conquerors. The racial and religious gulf forbids a\r\nsimilar solution of the Indian question, while the abandonment of her\r\ntask by Great Britain would leave India a prey to anarchy. The\r\ndifficulties of despotic rule were mitigated in the past by the utter\r\nabsence of any common sentiments and ideas among the many races,\r\nreligions, and castes which constituted India; and a Machiavellian\r\nperpetuation of these divisions might have eased the labours of its\r\ngovernors. But a government suffers for its virtues, and the steady\r\nefforts of Great Britain to civilize and educate its Eastern subjects\r\nhave tended to destroy the divisions which made common action, common\r\naspirations, public opinion and self-government impossible in India.\r\nThe missionary, the engineer, the doctor, the lawyer, and the political\r\nreformer have all helped to remove the bars of caste and race by\r\nconverting Brahmans, Mohammedans, Parsees to a common Christianity or\r\nby undermining their attachment to their particular distinctions. They\r\nhave built railways and canals, which made communications and contact\r\nunavoidable; they have imposed common measures of health, common legal\r\nprinciples, and a common education in English culture and methods of\r\nadministration. The result has been to foster a consciousness of\r\nnationality, the growth of a public opinion, and a demand for a greater\r\nshare in the management of affairs. The more efficient a despotism, the\r\nmore certain is its supersession; and the problem for the Indian\r\ngovernment is how to adjust and adapt the political emancipation of the\r\nnatives of India to the slow growth of their education and sense of\r\nmoral responsibility. At present, caste and racial and religious\r\ndifferences, especially between Mohammedans and Hindus, though\r\nweakening, are powerful disintegrants; not one per cent of the\r\npopulation can read or write; and the existence of hundreds of native\r\nstates impedes the progress of national agitation.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar problem confronts British administration in Egypt,\r\nwhere the difficulty of dealing with the agitation for national self-\r\ngovernment is complicated by the fact that technically the British\r\nagent and consul-general is merely the informal adviser of the khedive,\r\nwho is himself the viceroy of the Sultan of Turkey. Ultimately the same\r\nsort of dilemma will have to be faced in other parts of Africa under\r\nBritish rule--British East Africa and Uganda, the Nigerian\r\nprotectorates and neighbouring districts, Rhodesia and British Central\r\nAfrica--as well as in the Malay States, Hong Kong, and the West Indies.\r\nThere are great differences of opinion among the white citizens of the\r\nempire with regard to the treatment of their coloured fellow-subjects.\r\nAustralia and some provinces of the South African Union would exclude\r\nIndian immigrants altogether; and white minorities have an invincible\r\nrepugnance to allowing black majorities to exercise a vote, except\r\nunder stringent precautions against its effect. We have, indeed,\r\nimproved upon the Greeks, who regarded all other races as outside the\r\nscope of Greek morality; but we do not yet extend to coloured races the\r\nsame consideration that we do to white men.\r\n\r\nSo far as the white population of the empire is concerned, the problem\r\nof self-government was solved in the nineteenth century by procedure\r\ncommon to all the great dominions of the crown, though the\r\nemancipation, which had cost the mother-country centuries of conflict,\r\nwas secured by many colonies in less than fifty years. Three normal\r\nstages marked their progress, and Canada led the way in each. The first\r\nwas the acquisition of representative government--that is to say, of a\r\nlegislature consisting generally of two Houses, one of which was\r\npopularly elected but had little control over the executive; the second\r\nwas the acquisition of responsible government--that is to say, of an\r\nexecutive responsible to the popular local legislature instead of to\r\nthe home Colonial Office; and the third was federation. Canada had\r\npossessed the first degree of self-government ever since 1791 (see p.\r\n169), and was rapidly outgrowing it. Australia, however, did not pass\r\nout of the crown colony stage, in which affairs are controlled by a\r\ngovernor, with or without the assistance of a nominated legislative\r\ncouncil, until 1842, when elected members were added to the council of\r\nNew South Wales, and it was given the power of the purse. This\r\ndevelopment was due to the exodus of the surplus population, created by\r\nthe Industrial Revolution, from Great Britain, which began soon after\r\n1820, and affected Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\r\nVarious companies and associations were founded under the influence of\r\nLord Durham, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and others, for the purpose of\r\nsettling labourers in these lands. Between 1820 and 1830 several\r\nsettlements were established in Western Australia, in 1836 South\r\nAustralia was colonized, and gradually Victoria, Queensland, and\r\nTasmania were organized as independent colonies out of offshoots from\r\nthe parent New South Wales. Each in turn received a representative\r\nassembly, and developed individual characteristics.\r\n\r\nCape Colony followed on similar lines, variegated by the presence of a\r\nrival European race, the Dutch. Slowly, in the generation which\r\nsucceeded the British conquest, they accumulated grievances against\r\ntheir rulers. English was made the sole official language; Dutch\r\nmagistrates were superseded by English commissioners; slavery was\r\nabolished, with inadequate compensation to the owners; little support\r\nwas given them in their wars with the natives, which the home\r\ngovernment and the missionaries, more interested in the woes of negroes\r\nin South Africa than in those of children in British mines and\r\nfactories, attributed to Dutch brutality; and a Hottentot police was\r\nactually established. In 1837 the more determined of the Dutch\r\n\"trekked\" north and east to found republics in Natal, the Orange River\r\nFree State, and the Transvaal. Purged of these discontented elements,\r\nthe Cape was given representative government in 1853, and Natal, which\r\nhad been annexed in 1844, received a similar constitution in 1856.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Canada had advanced through constitutional struggles and\r\nopen rebellion to the second stage. It had received its baptism of fire\r\nduring the war (1812-1814) between Great Britain and the United States,\r\nwhen French and British Canadians fought side by side against a common\r\nenemy. But both provinces soon experienced difficulties similar to\r\nthose between the Stuarts and their parliaments; their legislative\r\nassemblies had no control over their executive governments, and in 1837\r\nPapineau's rebellion broke out in Lower, and Mackenzie's in Upper,\r\nCanada. Lord Durham was sent out to investigate the causes of\r\ndiscontent, and his report marks an epoch in colonial history. The idea\r\nthat the American War of Independence had taught the mother-country the\r\nnecessity of granting complete self-government to her colonies is a\r\npersistent misconception; and hitherto no British colony had received a\r\nfuller measure of self-government than had been enjoyed by the American\r\ncolonies before their Declaration of Independence. The grant of this\r\nresponsible self-government was one of the two principal\r\nrecommendations of Lord Durham's report. The other was the union of the\r\ntwo provinces, which, it was hoped, would give the British a majority\r\nover the French. This recommendation, which ultimately proved\r\nunworkable, was carried out at once; the other, which has been the\r\nsaving of the empire, was left for Lord Elgin to elaborate. He made it\r\na principle to choose as ministers only those politicians who possessed\r\nthe confidence of the popular assembly, and his example, followed by\r\nhis successors, crystallized into a fundamental maxim of British\r\ncolonial government. It was extended to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick\r\nin 1848, and to Newfoundland (which had in 1832 received a legislative\r\nassembly) in 1855.\r\n\r\nTo Lord John Russell, who was prime minister from 1846 to 1851, to his\r\ncolonial secretary, the third Earl Grey, and to Lords Aberdeen and\r\nPalmerston, who succeeded as premiers in 1852 and 1855, belongs the\r\ncredit of having conferred full rights of self-government on most of\r\nthe empire's oversea dominions. Australia, where the discovery of gold\r\nin 1851 added enormously to her population, soon followed in Canada's\r\nwake, and by 1856 every Australian colony, with the exception of\r\nWestern Australia, had, with the consent of the Imperial parliament,\r\nworked out a constitution for itself, comprising two legislative\r\nchambers and a responsible cabinet. New Zealand, which had begun to be\r\nsparsely settled between 1820 and 1840, and had been annexed in the\r\nlatter year, received in 1852 from the Imperial parliament a\r\nConstitution Act, which left it to Sir George Grey, the Governor, to\r\nwork out in practice the responsibility of ministers to the\r\nlegislature. Other colonies were slower in their constitutional\r\ndevelopment; Cape Colony was not granted a responsible administration\r\ntill 1872; Western Australia, which had continued to receive convicts\r\nafter their transportation to other Australian colonies had been\r\nsuccessfully resisted, did not receive complete self-government till\r\n1890, and Natal not until 1893.\r\n\r\nThe latest British colonies to receive this livery of the empire were\r\nthe Transvaal and the Orange River colonies. A chequered existence had\r\nbeen their fate since their founders had trekked north in 1837. The\r\nOrange River Free State had been annexed by Britain in 1848, had\r\nrebelled, and been granted independence again in 1854. The Transvaal\r\nhad been annexed in 1877, had rebelled, and had been granted almost\r\ncomplete independence again after Majuba in 1881. The Orange Free\r\nState, relieved of the diamond fields which belonged to it in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kimberley in 1870, pursued the even tenor of its way;\r\nbut the gold mines discovered in the Transvaal were not so near its\r\nborders, and gave rise to more prolonged dissensions. Crowds of\r\ncosmopolitan adventurers, as lawless as those who disturbed the peace\r\nin Victoria or California, flocked to the Rand. They were not of the\r\nstuff of which Dutch burghers were made, and the franchise was denied\r\nthem by a government which did not hesitate to profit from their\r\nlabours. The Jameson Raid, a hasty attempt to use their wrongs to\r\noverthrow President Kruger's government in 1895, \"upset the apple-cart\"\r\nof Cecil Rhodes, the prime minister of the Cape, who had added Rhodesia\r\nto the empire and was planning, with moderate Dutch support, to\r\nfederate South Africa. Kruger hardened his heart against the\r\nUitlanders, and armed himself to resist the arguments of the British\r\ngovernment on their behalf. Both sides underestimated the determination\r\nand resources of the other. But Kruger was more ignorant, if not more\r\nobstinate, than Mr. Chamberlain; and his ultimatum of October 1899\r\nprecipitated a war which lasted two years and a half, and cost the two\r\nrepublics their independence. The Transvaal was given, and the Orange\r\nRiver Colony was promised, representative government by the\r\nConservatives; but the Liberals, who came into power at the end of\r\n1905, excused them this apprenticeship, and granted them full\r\nresponsible government in 1906-1907.\r\n\r\nBritish colonies have tried a series of useful experiments with the\r\npower thus allotted them of managing their own affairs, and have\r\ncontributed more to the science of politics than all the arm-chair\r\nphilosophers from Aristotle downwards; and an examination in their\r\nresults would be a valuable test for aspiring politicians and civil\r\nservants. The Canadian provinces, with two exceptions, dispense with a\r\nsecond chamber; elsewhere in the empire, second chambers are universal,\r\nbut nowhere outside the United Kingdom hereditary. Their members are\r\neither nominated by the prime minister for life, as in the Dominion of\r\nCanada, or for a term of years, which is fixed at seven in New Zealand;\r\nor they are popularly elected, sometimes on a different property\r\nqualification from the Lower House, sometimes for a different period,\r\nsometimes by a different constituency. In the Commonwealth of Australia\r\nthey are chosen by each state voting as a whole, and this method, by\r\nwhich a big majority in one locality outweighs several small majorities\r\nin others, has sometimes resulted in making the Upper House more\r\nradical and socialistic than the Lower; the system of nomination\r\noccasionally has in Canada a result equally strange to English ideas,\r\nfor the present Conservative majority in the House of Commons is\r\nconfronted with a hostile Liberal majority in the Upper House, placed\r\nthere by Sir Wilfrid Laurier during his long tenure of office. The most\r\neffective provision against deadlocks between the two Houses is one in\r\nthe constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, by which, if they\r\ncannot agree, both are dissolved.\r\n\r\nOther contrasts are more bewildering than instructive. In Canada the\r\nmovement for women's suffrage has made little headway, and even less in\r\nSouth Africa; but at the Antipodes women share with men the privilege\r\nof adult suffrage in New Zealand, in the Commonwealth of Australia, and\r\nin every one of its component states; an advocate of the cause would\r\nperhaps explain the contrast by the presence of unprogressive French in\r\nCanada, and of unprogressive Dutch in South Africa. Certainly, the all-\r\nBritish dominions have been more advanced in their political\r\nexperiments than those in which the flighty Anglo-Saxon has been\r\ntempered by more stolid elements; and the pendulum swings little more\r\nin French Canada than it does in Celtic Ireland. In New Zealand old age\r\npensions were in force long before they were introduced into the\r\nmother-country; and compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes,\r\npayment of M.P.'s, and powers of local option and prohibition have been\r\nfor years in operation. Both the Dominion and the Commonwealth levy\r\ntaxes on land far exceeding those imposed by the British budget of\r\n1909. Australia is, in addition, trying a socialistic labour ministry\r\nand compulsory military training. It has also tried the more serious\r\nexperiment of developing a standard of comfort among its proletariate\r\nbefore peopling the country; and is consequently forced to exclude by\r\nlegislation all sorts of cheap labour, which might develop its\r\nindustries but would certainly lower its level of wages. It believes in\r\nhigh protection, but takes care by socialistic legislation that high\r\nwages shall more than counterbalance high prices; protection is to it\r\nmerely the form of state socialism which primarily benefits the\r\nemployer. It has also nationalized its railways and denationalized all\r\nchurches and religious instruction in public schools. There is, indeed,\r\nno state church in the empire outside Great Britain. But the most\r\nsignificant, perhaps, of Antipodean notions is the doctrine, inculcated\r\nin the Queensland elementary schools, of the sanctity of state\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nFinally, the colonies have made momentous experiments in federation.\r\nNew Zealand's was the earliest and the briefest; after a few years'\r\nexperience of provincial governments between 1852 and 1870, it reduced\r\nits provincial parliaments to the level of county councils, and adopted\r\na unitary constitution. In Canada, on the other hand, the union of the\r\nUpper and Lower Provinces proved unworkable owing to racial\r\ndifferences; and in 1867 the federation called the Dominion of Canada\r\nwas formed by agreement between Upper and Lower Canada (henceforth\r\ncalled Ontario and Quebec), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Prince\r\nEdward Island and British Columbia joined soon afterwards; and fresh\r\nprovinces have since been created out of the Hudson Bay and North-west\r\nTerritories; Newfoundland alone has stood aloof. Considerable powers\r\nare allotted to the provinces, including education; but the\r\ndistinguishing feature of this federation is that all powers not\r\ndefinitely assigned by the Dominion Act to the provinces belong to the\r\nDominion. This is in sharp contrast to the United States, where each\r\nindividual state is the sovereign body, and the Federal government only\r\npossesses such powers as the states have delegated to it by the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the Australian federation called the Commonwealth,\r\nwhich was formed in 1900, resembles the United States rather than\r\nCanada. The circumstance that each Australian colony grew up round a\r\nseaport, having little or no overland connexion with other Australian\r\ncolonies, kept them long apart; and the commercial interests centred in\r\nthese ports are still centrifugal rather than centripetal in sentiment.\r\nHence powers, not specifically assigned to the Federal government,\r\nremain in the hands of the individual states; the Labour party,\r\nhowever, inclines towards a centralizing policy, and the general trend\r\nseems to be in that direction. It will probably be strengthened by the\r\nconstruction of transcontinental railways and by a further growth of\r\nthe nationalist feeling of Australia, which is already marked.\r\n\r\nThe Union of South Africa, formed in 1909, soon after the Boer colonies\r\nhad received self-government, went almost as far towards unification as\r\nNew Zealand, and became a unitary state rather than a federation. The\r\ngreater expense of maintaining several local parliaments as well as a\r\ncentral legislature, and the difficulty of apportioning their powers,\r\ndetermined South African statesmen to sweep away the old legislatures\r\naltogether, and to establish a united parliament which meets at Cape\r\nTown, a single executive which has its offices at Pretoria, and a\r\njudicature which is located at Bloemfontein. Thus almost every variety\r\nof Union and Home Rule exists within the empire, and arguments from\r\nanalogy are provided for both the British political parties.\r\n\r\nTwo extremes have been, and must be, avoided. History has falsified the\r\nimpression prevalent in the middle of the nineteenth century that the\r\ncolonies would sooner or later follow the example of the United States,\r\nand sever their connexion with the mother-country. It has no less\r\nclearly demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining a centralized\r\ngovernment of the empire in Downing Street. The union or federation of\r\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa has strengthened the\r\nclaims of each of those imperial realms to be considered a nation, with\r\nfull rights and powers of self-government; and it remains to be seen\r\nwhether the federating process can be carried to a higher level, and\r\nimperial sentiment crystallized in Imperial Federation. Imperial\r\nConferences have become regular, but we may not call them councils; no\r\nmajority in them has power to bind a minority, and no conference can\r\nbind the mother-country or a single dominion of the crown. As an\r\neducational body the Imperial Conference is excellent; but no one would\r\nventure to give powers of taxation or of making war and peace to a\r\nconclave in which Great Britain, with its forty-four millions of people\r\nand the navy and army it supports, has no more votes than Newfoundland,\r\nwith its quarter of a million of inhabitants and immunity from imperial\r\nburdens.\r\n\r\nEducation is, however, at the root of all political systems. Where the\r\nmass of the people know nothing of politics, a despotism is essential;\r\nwhere only the few are politically educated, there needs must be an\r\naristocracy. Great Britain lost its American colonies largely through\r\nignorance; and no imperial organization could arise among a group of\r\nstates ignorant of each other's needs, resources, and aspirations. The\r\nImperial Conference is not to be judged by its meagre tangible results;\r\nif it has led British politicians to appreciate the varying character\r\nand depth of national feeling in the Dominions, and politicians oversea\r\nto appreciate the delicacies of the European diplomatic situation, the\r\ndependence of every part of the empire upon sea-power, and the\r\ncomplexities of an Imperial government which has also to consider the\r\ninterests of hundreds of millions of subjects in India, in tropical\r\nAfrica, in the West Indies, and in the Pacific, the Conference will\r\nhave helped to foster the intellectual conditions which must underlie\r\nany attempt at an imperial superstructure.\r\n\r\nFor the halcyon days of peace, prosperity, and progress can hardly be\r\nassumed as yet, and not even the most distant and self-contained\r\nDominions can afford to ignore the menace of blood and iron. No power,\r\nindeed, is likely to find the thousand millions or so which it would\r\ncost to conquer and hold Canada, Australia, or South Africa; but a\r\nlucky raid on their commerce or some undefended port might cost many\r\nmillions by way of ransom. A slackening birth-rate is, moreover, a\r\nreminder that empires in the past, like that of Rome, have civilized\r\nthemselves out of existence in the competition with races which bred\r\nwith primitive vigour, and had no costly standards of comfort. There\r\nare such races to-day; the slumbering East has wakened, and the tide\r\nwhich flowed for four centuries from West to East is on the turn. The\r\nvictory of Japan over Russia was an event beside which the great Boer\r\nWar sinks into insignificance. Asiatics, relieved by the _Pax\r\nBritannica_ from mutual destruction, are eating the whites out of\r\nthe islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and threatening South\r\nAfrica, Australia, and the western shores of America. No armaments and\r\nno treaties of arbitration can ward off their economic competition; and\r\nit is not certain that their myriads, armed with Western morality and\r\nmethods of warfare, will be always content to refrain from turning\r\nagainst Europe the means of expansion which Europe has used with so\r\nmuch success against them. The British Empire will need all the wisdom\r\nit can command, if it is to hold its own in the parliament of reason or\r\nthe arbitrament of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nENGLISH DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern national state is the most powerful political organism ever\r\nknown, because it is the conscious or unconscious agency of a people's\r\nwill. Government is no longer in England the instrument of a family or\r\na class; and the only real check upon its power is the circumstance\r\nthat in some matters it acts as the executive committee of one party\r\nand is legitimately resisted by the other. Were there no parties, the\r\ngovernment would be a popular despotism absolutely uncontrolled.\r\nTheoretically it is omnicompetent; parliament--or, to use more\r\ntechnical phraseology, the Crown in Parliament--can make anything law\r\nthat it chooses; and no one has a legal right to resist, or authority\r\nto pronounce what parliament has done to be unconstitutional. No Act of\r\nParliament can be illegal or unconstitutional, because there are no\r\nfundamental laws and no written constitution in this country; and when\r\npeople loosely speak of an Act being unconstitutional, all that they\r\nmean is that they do not agree with it. Other countries, like the\r\nUnited States, have drawn up a written constitution and established a\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature to guard it; and if the American\r\nlegislature violates this constitution by any Act, the Supreme Court\r\nmay declare that Act unconstitutional, in which case it is void. But\r\nthere is no such limitation in England upon the sovereignty of\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nThis sovereignty has been gradually evolved. At first it was royal and\r\npersonal, but not parliamentary or representative; and medieval kings\r\nhad to struggle with the rival claims of the barons and the church. By\r\ncalling in the assistance of the people assembled and represented in\r\nparliament, the monarchy triumphed over both the barons and the church;\r\nbut when, in the seventeenth century, the two partners to this victory\r\nquarrelled over the spoils, parliament and not the crown established\r\nits claim to be the real representative of the state; and in the cases\r\nof Strafford, Danby, and others it even asserted that loyalty to the\r\nking might be treason to the state. The church, vanquished at the\r\nReformation, dropped more and more out of the struggle for sovereignty,\r\nbecause, while the state grew more comprehensive, the church grew more\r\nexclusive. It was not that, after 1662, it seriously narrowed its\r\nformulas or doctrines, but it failed to enlarge them, and a larger and\r\nlarger proportion of Englishmen thus found themselves outside its pale.\r\nThe state, on the other hand, embraced an ever-widening circle of\r\ndissent; and by degrees Protestant Nonconformists, Roman Catholics,\r\nQuakers, Jews, Atheists, Mohammedans, believers, misbelievers, and\r\nunbelievers of all sorts, were admitted to the fullest rights of\r\ncitizenship. State and church ceased to correspond; one became the\r\nwhole, the other only a part, and there could be no serious rivalry\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\nThe state had to contend, however, with more subtle and serious\r\nattacks. This great Leviathan, as Hobbes called it, was not at first a\r\npopular institution; and it frightened many people. The American\r\ncolonists, for instance, thought that its absolute sovereignty was too\r\ndangerous a thing to be left loose, and they put sovereignty under a\r\ntriple lock and key, giving one to the judicature, one to the\r\nlegislature, and a third to the executive. Only by the co-operation of\r\nthese three keepers can the American people loose their sovereignty and\r\nuse it to amend their constitution; and so jealously is sovereignty\r\nconfined that anarchy often seems to reign in its stead. There was,\r\nindeed, some excuse for distrusting a sovereignty claimed by George III\r\nand the unreformed British parliament; and it was natural enough that\r\npeople should deny its necessity and set up in its place Declarations\r\nof the Rights of Man. Sovereignty of Hobbes's type was a somewhat novel\r\nconception; men had not grasped its possibilities as an engine of\r\npopular will, because they were only familiar with its exploitation by\r\nkings and oligarchs; and so closely did they identify the thing with\r\nits abuses that they preferred to do without it altogether, or at least\r\nto confine it to the narrowest possible limits. Government and the\r\npeople were antagonistic: the less government there was, the less harm\r\nwould be done to the people, and so a general body of individualistic,\r\n_laissez-faire_ theory developed, which was expressed in various\r\nDeclarations of the Rights of Man, and set up against the \"paternal\r\ndespotism\" of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThese Rights of Man helped to produce alike the anarchy of the first\r\nFrench Revolution and the remedial despotism of the Jacobins and their\r\nsuccessor Napoleon; and the oscillation between under-government and\r\nover-government, between individualism and socialism has continued to\r\nthis day. Each coincides with obvious human interests: the blessed in\r\npossession prefer a policy of _laissez faire_; they are all for\r\nLiberty and Property, enjoying sufficient means for doing whatsoever\r\nthey like with what they are pleased to call their own. But those who\r\nhave little to call their own, and much that they would like, prefer\r\nstrong government if they can control it; and the strength of\r\ngovernment has steadily grown with popular control. This is due to more\r\nthan a predatory instinct; it is natural, and excusable enough, that\r\npeople should be reluctant to maintain what is no affair of theirs; but\r\neven staunch Conservatives have been known to pay Radical taxes with\r\ncomparative cheerfulness when their party has returned to power.\r\n\r\nGovernment was gradually made the affair of the people by the series of\r\nReform Acts extending from 1832 to 1885; and it is no mere accident\r\nthat this half-century also witnessed the political emancipation of the\r\nBritish colonies. Nor must we forget the Acts beginning with the repeal\r\nof the Test and Corporation Acts (1828) and Roman Catholic Emancipation\r\n(1829), which extended political rights to men of all religious\r\npersuasions. These and the Franchise Acts made the House of Commons\r\ninfinitely more representative than it had been before, and gave it its\r\nconclusive superiority over the House of Lords. Not that the Peers\r\nrepresent no one but themselves; had that been true, the House of Lords\r\nwould have disappeared long ago. In reality it came to embody a fairly\r\ncomplete representation of the Conservative party; and as a party does\r\nnot need two legislative organs, the House of Lords retired whenever\r\nthe Conservatives controlled the House of Commons, and only resumed its\r\nproper functions when the Liberals had a majority. Hence its most\r\nindefensible characteristic as a Second Chamber became its strongest\r\npractical bulwark; for it enlisted the support of many who had no\r\nparticular views about Second Chambers in the abstract, but were keenly\r\ninterested in the predominance of their party.\r\n\r\nThe restraint thus imposed by the House of Lords upon popular\r\ngovernment checked the development of its power and the extension of\r\nits activity, which would naturally have followed upon the acquisition\r\nby the people of control over the House of Commons and indirectly over\r\nthe Cabinet. Other causes co-operated to induce delay. The most\r\npowerful was lack of popular education; constitutional privileges are\r\nof no value to people who do not understand how they may be used, or\r\nare so unimaginative and ill-disciplined as to prefer such immediate\r\nand tangible rewards as a half-crown for their vote, a donation to\r\ntheir football club or local charity, or a gracious word from an\r\ninterested lady, to their distant and infinitesimal share in the\r\ndirection of national government. This participation is, in fact, so\r\nminute to the individual voter and so intangible in its operation, that\r\na high degree of education is required to appreciate its value; and the\r\nEducation Acts of 1870 and 1889 were indispensable preliminaries to\r\nanything like a real democracy. A democracy really educated in politics\r\nwill express views strange to our ears with an emphasis of which even\r\nyet we have little conception.\r\n\r\nOther obstacles to the overthrow of the rule of _laissez faire_\r\nwere the vested interests of over-mighty manufacturers and landlords in\r\nthe maintenance of that anarchy which is the logical extreme of Liberty\r\nand Property; and such elementary measures of humanity as the Factory\r\nActs were long resisted by men so humane as Cobden and John Bright as\r\narbitrary interventions with the natural liberty of man to drive\r\nbargains with his fellows in search of a living wage. There seemed to\r\nbe no idea that economic warfare might be quite as degrading as that\r\nprimitive condition of natural war, in which Hobbes said that the life\r\nof man was \"nasty, short, brutish and mean,\" and that it might as\r\nurgently require a similar sovereign remedy. The repugnance to such a\r\nremedy was reinforced by crude analogies between a perverted Darwinism\r\nand politics. Darwin's demonstration of evolution by means of the\r\nstruggle for existence in the natural world was used to support the\r\nassumption that a similar struggle among civilized men was natural and\r\ntherefore inevitable; and that all attempts to interfere with the\r\nconflict between the weak and the strong, the scrupulous and the\r\nunscrupulous, were foredoomed to disastrous failure. It was forgotten\r\nthat civilization itself involves a more or less conscious repeal of\r\n\"Nature,\" and that the progress of man depends upon the conquest of\r\nhimself and of his surroundings. In a better sense of the word, the\r\nevolution of man's self-control and conscience is just as \"natural\" as\r\nthe gratification of his animal instincts.\r\n\r\nThe view that each individual should be left without further help from\r\nthe state to cope with his environment might be acceptable to landlords\r\nwho had already obtained from parliament hundreds of Inclosure Acts,\r\nand to manufacturers whose profits were inflated by laws making it\r\ncriminal for workmen to combine. They might rest from political\r\nagitation and be thankful for their constitutional gains; at any rate\r\nthey had little to hope from a legislature in which working men had\r\nvotes. But the masses, who had just secured the franchise, were\r\nreluctant to believe that the action of the state had lost its virtue\r\nat the moment when the control of the state came within their grasp.\r\nThe vote seems to have been given them under the amiable delusion that\r\nthey would be happy when they got it, as if it had any value whatever\r\nexcept as a means to an end. Nor is it adequate as a means: it is not\r\nsufficient for a nation by adult suffrage to express its will; that\r\nwill has also to be carried into execution, and it requires a strong\r\nexecutive to do so. Hence the reversal of the old Liberal attitude\r\ntowards the royal prerogative, which may be best dated from 1872, when\r\nGladstone abolished the purchase of commissions in the army by means of\r\nthe royal prerogative, after the proposed reform had been rejected as a\r\nbill by the House of Lords. No Liberal is likely in the future to\r\nsuggest that \"the influence of the crown has increased, is increasing,\r\nand ought to be diminished\"; because the prerogative of the crown has\r\nbecome the privilege of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Franchise Acts had apparently provided a solution of the old\r\nantithesis of Man _versus_ the State by comprehending all men\r\n_in_ the state; and the great value of those reforms was that they\r\ntended to eliminate force from the sphere of politics. When men could\r\nvote, there was less reason in rebellion; and the antithesis of Man\r\n_versus_ the State has almost been reduced to one of Woman _versus_ the\r\nState. But representative government, which promised to be ideal when\r\nevery man, or every adult, had a vote, is threatened in various\r\nquarters. Its operations are too deliberate and involved to satisfy\r\nimpatient spirits, and three alternative methods of procedure are\r\nadvocated as improvements upon it. One is the \"direct action\" of\r\nworking men, by which they can speedily obtain their objects through a\r\ngeneral or partial strike paralyzing the food supply or other national\r\nnecessities. This is obviously a dangerous and double-edged weapon, the\r\nadoption of which by other sections of the community--the Army and\r\nNavy, for instance, or the medical profession--might mean national\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nAnother method is the Referendum, by which important decisions adopted\r\nby parliament would be referred to a direct popular vote. This proposal\r\nis only logical when coupled with the Initiative, by which a direct\r\npopular vote could compel parliament to pass any measure desired by the\r\nmajority of voters; otherwise its object is merely obstructive. The\r\nthird method is the supersession of parliament by the action of the\r\nexecutive. The difficulties which Liberal measures have experienced in\r\nthe House of Lords, and the impossibility of the House of Commons\r\ndealing by debate with the increasing complexities of national\r\nbusiness, have encouraged a tendency in Liberal governments to entrust\r\nto their departments decisions which trench upon the legislative\r\nfunctions of parliament. The trend of hostile opinion is to regard\r\nparliament as an unnecessary middleman, and to advocate in its stead a\r\nsort of plebiscitary bureaucracy, a constitution under which\r\nlegislation drafted by officials would be demanded, sanctioned, or\r\nrejected by direct popular vote, and would be discussed, like the\r\nInsurance Bill, in informal conferences outside, rather than inside,\r\nparliament; while administration by a vast army of experts would be\r\npartially controlled by popularly elected ministers; for socialists\r\nwaver between their faith in human equality and their trust in the\r\nsuperman. Others think that the milder method of Devolution, or \"Home\r\nRule all round,\" would meet the evils caused by the congestion of\r\nbusiness, and restore to the Mother of Parliaments her time-honoured\r\nfunction of governing by debate.\r\n\r\nParliament has already had to delegate legislative powers to other\r\nbodies than colonial legislatures; and county councils, borough\r\ncouncils, district councils, and parish councils share with it in\r\nvarious degrees the task of legislating for the country. They can, of\r\ncourse, only legislate, as they can only administer, within the limits\r\nimposed by Act of Parliament; but their development, like the\r\nmultiplication of central administrative departments, indicates the\r\nlatest, but not the final, stages in the growth and specialization of\r\nEnglish government. A century and a half ago two Secretaries of State\r\nwere all that Great Britain required; now there are half-a-dozen, and a\r\ndozen other departments have been added. Among them are the Local\r\nGovernment Board, the Board of Education, the Board of Trade, the Board\r\nof Agriculture, while many sub-departments such as the Public Health\r\nDepartment of the Local Government Board, the Bankruptcy Department of\r\nthe Board of Trade, and the Factory Department of the Home Office, have\r\nmore work to do than originally had a Secretary of State. It is\r\nprobable, moreover, that departments will multiply and subdivide at an\r\never-increasing rate.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is merely machinery provided to give effect to\r\npublic opinion, which determines the use to which it shall be put. But\r\nits very provision indicates that England expects the state to-day to\r\ndo more and more extensive duty for the individual. For one thing the\r\nstate has largely taken the place of the church as the organ of the\r\ncollective conscience of the community. It can hardly be said that the\r\nAnglican church has an articulate conscience apart from questions of\r\ncanon law and ecclesiastical property; and other churches are, as\r\nbodies, no better provided with creeds of social morality. The Eighth\r\nCommandment is never applied to such genteel delinquencies as making a\r\nfalse return of income, or defrauding a railway company or the customs;\r\nbut is reserved for the grosser offences which no member of the\r\ncongregation is likely to have committed; and it is left to the state\r\nto provide by warning and penalty against neglect of one's duty to\r\none's neighbour when one's neighbour is not one individual but the sum\r\nof all. It was not by any ecclesiastical agitation that some humanity\r\nwas introduced into the criminal code in the third decade of the\r\nnineteenth century; and the protest against the blind cruelty of\r\neconomic _laissez faire_ was made by Sadler, Shaftesbury, Ruskin,\r\nand Carlyle rather than by any church. Their writings and speeches\r\nawoke a conscience in the state, which began to insist by means of\r\nlegislation upon humaner hours and conditions of labour, upon decent\r\nsanitation, upon a standard of public education, and upon provision\r\nbeing made against fraudulent dealings with more helpless fellow-men.\r\n\r\nThis public conscience has inevitably proved expensive, and the expense\r\nhas had to be borne either by the state or by the individual. Now, it\r\nmight have been possible, when the expense of these new standards of\r\npublic health and comfort began to be incurred, to provide by an heroic\r\neffort of socialism for a perpetuation of the individualistic basis of\r\nsocial duty. That is to say, if the state had guaranteed to every\r\nindividual an income which would enable him to bear his share of this\r\nexpense, it might also have imposed upon him the duty of meeting it, of\r\npaying fees for the education of his children, for hospital treatment,\r\nfor medical inspection, and so forth. But that effort was not, and\r\nperhaps could not, in the existing condition of public opinion, be\r\nmade; and the state has therefore got into the habit of providing and\r\npaying for all these things itself. When the majority of male adults\r\nearn twenty shillings or less a week, and possess a vote, there would\r\nbe no raising of standards at all, if they had to pay the cost. Hence\r\nthe state has been compelled step by step to meet the expense of\r\nburdens imposed by its conscience. Free education has therefore\r\nfollowed compulsory education; the demands of sanitary inspectors and\r\nmedical officers of health have led to free medical inspection, medical\r\ntreatment, the feeding of necessitous school children, and other\r\npiecemeal socialism; and, ignoring the historical causes of this\r\ndevelopment, we are embarked on a wordy warfare of socialists and\r\nindividualists as to the abstract merits of antagonistic theories.\r\n\r\nIt is mainly a battle of phrases, in which few pause to examine what\r\ntheir opponents or they themselves mean by the epithets they employ. In\r\nthe sense in which the individualist uses the term socialist, there are\r\nhardly any socialists, and in the sense in which the socialist uses the\r\nterm individualist, there are practically no individualists. In reality\r\nwe are all both individualists and socialists. It is a question of\r\ndegree and not of dogma; and most people are at heart agreed that some\r\neconomic socialism is required in order to promote a certain amount of\r\nmoral and intellectual individualism. The defect of so-called economic\r\nindividualism is that it reduces the mass of workers to one dead level\r\nof common poverty, in which wages, instead of increasing like capital,\r\nbarely keep pace with the rise of rent and prices, in which men occupy\r\ndwellings all alike in the same mean streets, pursuing the same routine\r\nof labour and same trivial round of relaxation, and in which there\r\nseems no possibility of securing for the individual adequate\r\nopportunities for that development of his individuality by which alone\r\nhe can render his best service to the community.\r\n\r\nThat service is the common end and object towards which men of all\r\nparties in English history have striven through the growth of conscious\r\nand collective action. A communist has maintained that we are all\r\ncommunists because we have developed a common army, a common navy, and\r\na common national government, in place of the individualistic forces\r\nand jurisdictions of feudal barons. We have, indeed, nationalized these\r\nthings and many others as well, including the crown, the church, the\r\nadministration of justice, education, highways and byways, posts and\r\ntelegraphs, woods and forests. Even the House of Lords has been\r\nconstrained to abandon its independence by a process akin to that\r\nmedieval _peine forte et dure_, by which the obstinate individualist\r\nwas, when accused, compelled to surrender his ancient immunity and\r\nsubmit to the common law; and this common control, which came into\r\nbeing as the nation emerged out of its diverse elements in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and slowly gathered force as\r\nit realized its strength under the Tudors, has attained fresh momentum\r\nin the latest ages as the state step by step extended to all sorts and\r\nconditions of men a share in the exercise of its power.\r\n\r\nThis is the real English conquest, and it forms the chief content of\r\nEnglish history. It is part of the triumph of man over the forces of\r\nnature and over himself, and the two have gone hand in hand. An English\r\nstate could hardly exist before men had made roads, but it could no\r\nmore exist until they had achieved that great victory of civilized\r\ngovernment by which a minority agrees for the sake of peace to submit\r\nto the greater number. Steam and railways and telegraphs have placed\r\nfurther powers in the hands of men; they have conquered the land and\r\nthe sea and the air; and medical science has built up their physique\r\nand paved the way for empire in tropical climes. But while he has\r\nconquered nature, man has also conquered himself. He has tamed his\r\ncombative instincts; he has reduced civil strife to political combats,\r\nrestrained national conflicts by treaties of arbitration, and subdued\r\nprivate wars to judicial proceedings; it is only in partially civilized\r\ncountries that gentlemen cannot rule their temper or bend their honour\r\nto the base arbitrament of justice. He looks before and after, and\r\nforgoes the gratification of the present to insure against the\r\naccidents of the future, though the extent to which the community as a\r\nwhole can follow the example of individuals in this respect remains at\r\nthe moment a test of its self-control and sense of collective\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWhether this growth of power in the individual and in the state is a\r\ngood or an evil thing depends on the conscience of those who wield it.\r\nThe power of the over-mighty subject has generally been a tyranny; and\r\nall power is distrusted by old-fashioned Liberals and philosophic\r\nAnarchists, because they have a traditional suspicion that it will fall\r\ninto hostile or unscrupulous hands. But the forces of evil cannot be\r\novercome by _laissez faire_, and power is an indispensable weapon\r\nof progress. A powerless state means a helpless community; and anarchy\r\nis the worst of all forms of tyranny, because it is irresponsible,\r\nincorrigible, and capricious. Weakness, moreover, is the parent of\r\npanic, and panic brings cruelty in its train. So long as the state was\r\nweak, it was cruel; and the hideous treason-laws of Tudor times were\r\ndue to fear. The weak cannot afford to be tolerant any more than the\r\npoor can afford to be generous. Cecil thought that the state could not\r\nafford to tolerate two forms of religion; to-day it tolerates hundreds,\r\nand it laughs at treason because it is strong. We are humanitarian, not\r\nbecause we are so much better than our ancestors, but because we can\r\nafford the luxury of dissent and conscientious objections so much\r\nbetter than they could. Political liberty and religious freedom depend\r\nupon the power of the state, inspired, controlled, and guided by the\r\nmind of the community.\r\n\r\nLast of all, through this power man has acquired faith, not in\r\nmiraculous intervention, but in his capacity to work out his own\r\ndestinies by means of the weapons placed in his hands and the dominion\r\nput under his feet. He no longer believes that the weakest must go to\r\nthe wall, and the helpless be trampled under foot in the march of\r\ncivilization; nature is no longer a mass of inscrutable, iron decrees,\r\nbut a treasury of forces to be tamed and used in the redemption of\r\nmankind by man; and mankind is no longer a mob of blind victims to\r\npanic and passion, but a more or less orderly host marching on to more\r\nor less definite goals. The individual, however, can do little by\r\nhimself; he needs the strength of union for his herculean tasks; and he\r\nhas found that union in the state. It is not an engine of tyranny, but\r\nthe lever of social morality; and the function of English government is\r\nnot merely to embody the organized might and the executive brain of\r\nEngland, but also to enforce its collective and coordinating\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nB.C. 55.
