VI.--NOVEMBER, 1864--No. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF LIBERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of persons in the loyal States of this Union who\r\nproclaim the present civil war unnecessary, and clamor for peace at any\r\nprice: first, a multitude of people, so ignorant of the history of the\r\ncountry that they do not know what the conflict is about; secondly, a\r\nsmaller class of better-informed citizens, who have no moral\r\ncomprehension of the inevitable opposition of democracy and aristocracy,\r\nfree society and slave society, and who believe sincerely that a\r\npermanent compromise or trade can be negotiated between these opposing\r\nforces in human affairs; thirdly, a clique of demagogues, who are trying\r\nto use these two classes of people to paralyze the Government, and force\r\nit into a surrender to the rebels on such terms as they choose to\r\ndictate: their separation from the United States or recall to their old\r\npower in a restored and reconstructed Union.\r\n\r\nIt will be my purpose, in this article, to show the complete fallacy of\r\nthis notion, by presenting the facts concerning the progress of the\r\ndifferent portions of our country in the American idea of liberty during\r\nthe years preceding this war. The census of 1860, if honestly studied,\r\nmust convince any unprejudiced man, at home or abroad, that the Slave\r\nPower deliberately brought this war upon the United States, to save\r\nitself from destruction by the irresistible and powerful growth of free\r\nsociety in the Union. This war had the same origin and necessity of\r\nevery great conflict between the people and the aristocracy since the\r\nworld began.\r\n\r\nEvery war of this kind in history has been the result of the advancement\r\nof the people in liberty. Now the people have inaugurated the conflict\r\nagainst the aristocracy, either in the interest of self-government, or\r\nan imperial rule which should virtually rest upon their suffrage. Now\r\nthe aristocracy has risen upon the people, who were becoming too strong\r\nand free, to conquer and govern them through republican or monarchical\r\nforms of society. There has always been an irrepressible conflict\r\nbetween aristocracy and democracy; in times of peace carried on by all\r\nthe agencies of popular advancement; but in every nation finally\r\nbursting into civil war. And every such war, however slow its progress,\r\nor uncertain its immediate consequence, has finally left the mass of\r\nthe people nearer liberty than it found them.\r\n\r\nThe northern Grecian states represented the cause of the people; and the\r\noriental empires the cause of the few. These little states grew so\r\nrapidly that the despots of Asia became alarmed, and organized gigantic\r\nexpeditions to destroy them. At Marathon and Salamis, the people's cause\r\nmet and drove back the mighty invasion; and two hundred years later,\r\nunder the lead of Alexander, dissolved every Asiatic empire, from the\r\nMediterranean to the Euphrates, to its original elements.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar destroyed the power of the old Roman aristocracy in the\r\ninterest of the people of the Roman empire. Under the name of 'The\r\nRepublic,' that patrician class had oppressed the people of Rome and her\r\nprovinces for years as never was people oppressed before. After fifty\r\nyears of civil war, Julius and Augustus Caesar organized the masses of\r\nthis world-wide empire, and established a government under which the\r\naristocracy was fearfully worried, but which administered such, justice\r\nto the world as had never before been possible.\r\n\r\nThe religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which\r\ninvolved the whole of Europe for eighty years, were begun by the civil\r\nand religious aristocracy of Europe to crush the progress of religious\r\nand civil liberty among the people. These wars continued until religious\r\nfreedom was established in Germany, Holland, and Great Britain, and\r\nthose seeds of political liberty sown that afterward sprang up in the\r\nAmerican republic.\r\n\r\nThe English civil wars of the seventeenth century were begun by the king\r\nand great nobles to suppress the rising power of the commons, and\r\ncontinued till constitutional liberty was practically secured to all the\r\nsubjects of the British empire.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution was the revolt of the people of France against one\r\nof the most cruel and tyrannical aristocracies that ever reigned; and\r\ncontinued, with brief interruptions, till the people of both France and\r\nItaly had vindicated the right to choose their emperors by popular\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nDuring the half century between the years 1775 and 1825, every people in\r\nNorth America had thrown off the power of a foreign aristocracy by war,\r\nand established a republican form of government, except the Canadas,\r\nwhich secured the same practical results by more peaceful methods.\r\n\r\nThe historian perceives that each of these great wars was an inevitable\r\ncondition of liberty for the people, and has exalted their condition. In\r\nall these struggles there were the same kinds of opponents to the war:\r\nthe ignorant, who knew nothing about it; the morally indifferent, who\r\ncould not see why freemen and tyrants could not agree to live together\r\nin amity; and the demagogues, who were willing to ruin the country to\r\nexalt themselves. But we now understand that only through these red\r\ngates of war could the peoples of the world have marched up to their\r\npresent enjoyment of liberty; that each naming portal is a triumphal\r\narch, on which is inscribed some great conquest for mankind.\r\n\r\nThe present civil war in the United States is the last frantic attempt\r\nof this dying feudal aristocracy to save itself from inevitable\r\ndissolution. The election of Mr. Lincoln as President of the United\r\nStates, in 1860, by the vote of every Free State, was the announcement\r\nto the world that the people of the United States had finally and\r\ndecisively conquered the feudal aristocracy of the republic after a\r\ncivil contest of eighty years. With no weapons but those placed in their\r\nhands by the Constitution of the United States, the freemen of the\r\nrepublic had practically put this great slave aristocracy under their\r\nfeet forever. That portion of the Union which was controlled by the will\r\nof the whole people had become so decidedly superior in every attribute\r\nof power and civilization, that the slave aristocracy despaired of\r\nfurther peaceful resistance to the march of liberty through the land.\r\nLike every other aristocracy that has lived, it drew the sword on the\r\npeople, either to subdue the whole country, or carry off a portion of\r\nit, to be governed in the interests of an oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThis great people was not plunged into civil war by unfriendly talking,\r\nor by the unfriendly legislation of the Northern people, or by the\r\naccidental election of Abraham Lincoln as President. Nations do not go\r\nto war for hard words or trifling acts of unfriendliness or accidental\r\npolitical changes; although these may be the ostensible causes of\r\nwar--the sparks that finally explode the magazine. There was a real\r\ncause for this rebellion--_the peaceful, constitutional triumph of the\r\npeople over the aristocracy of the republic, after a struggle of eighty\r\nyears_. If ever a great oligarchy had good reason to fight, it was the\r\nSlave Power in 1860. It found itself defeated and condemned to a\r\nsecondary position in the republic, with the assurance that its death\r\nwas only a question of time. It is always a good cause of war to an\r\naristocracy that its power is abridged; for an aristocracy cares only\r\nfor itself, and honestly regards its own supremacy as the chief interest\r\non earth. This Slave Power has only done what every such power has done\r\nsince the foundation of the world. It has drawn the sword against the\r\ninevitable progress of mankind, and will be conquered by mankind. It is\r\nwaging this terrible war, not against Northern Abolitionists, or the\r\npresent Administration, _but against the United States census tables of\r\n1860_; against the mighty realities of the progress of free society in\r\nthe republic, which have startled us all; but with which no class of men\r\nwere so well acquainted as Mr. Jefferson Davis and his associates in\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a conflict in our country between this old slave\r\naristocracy and the people. The first great victory of the people was in\r\nthe war of the Revolution. That war was inaugurated and forced upon the\r\ncountry by the masses of the people of the New England and Middle\r\nStates. The aristocracy of the South, with their associates in the\r\nNorth, resisted the movement to separate the people from the crown of\r\nGreat Britain, till resistance was impossible, and then came in, to some\r\nextent, to lead the movement and appropriate the rewards of success. But\r\nthe free people of the North brought on and sustained the war.\r\nMassachusetts was then the fourth province in population; but she sent\r\neight thousand more soldiers to the field during those bloody eight\r\nyears than all the Southern States united. Virginia was then the empire\r\nState of the Union, and Rhode Island the least; but great, aristocratic\r\nVirginia furnished only seven hundred more soldiers than little,\r\ndemocratic Rhode Island. New England furnished more than half the troops\r\nraised during the Revolution; and the great centres of aristocracy in\r\nthe Middle and Southern States were the stronghold of Toryism during the\r\nwar. Indeed, a glance at the map of the Eastern and Middle States\r\nreveals the fact that the headquarters of the 'peace party' in the\r\nRevolutionary and the present war are in precisely the same localities.\r\nThe 'Copperhead' districts of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are\r\nthe old Tory districts of the Revolution. The Tories of that day, with\r\nthe mass of the Southern aristocracy, tried to 'stop the war' which was\r\nto lay the foundations of the freedom of all men. The Tories of to-day\r\nare engaged in the same infamous enterprise, and their fate will be the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nHad the Slave Power been united in 1776, we should never have gained our\r\nindependence. But it was divided. Every State was nominally a Slave\r\nState; but slaveholders were divided into two classes. The first was led\r\nby Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and other illustrious aristocrats,\r\nNorth and South; and, like the Liberal lords of Great Britain, threw\r\ntheir influence on the side of the people. This party, very strong in\r\nVirginia, very weak in the Carolinas, dragged the South through the war\r\nby the hair of its head; and compelled it to come into the Union. It\r\nalso resolved to abolish the Slave Power, and succeeded in consecrating\r\nthe whole Northwestern territory to freedom as early as 1790. The\r\nopposition party had its headquarters at Charleston, was treasonable or\r\nluke-warm during the war, and refused to come into the Union without\r\nguarantees for slavery.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole struggle was, that the people of the thirteen\r\ncolonies, with the help of a portion of their aristocracy, severed the\r\ncountry from Great Britain, and established a Government by which they,\r\nthe people, believed themselves able, in time, to control the whole\r\nUnion, and secure personal liberty in every State. For 'the compromises\r\nof the Constitution' mean just this: that our National Government was a\r\ngreat arena on which aristocracy and democracy could have a free fight.\r\nIf the aristocracy beat, that Government would be made as despotic as\r\nSouth Carolina; if the democracy triumphed, it would become as free as\r\nMassachusetts. That was what the people had never before achieved: _a\r\nfree field to work for a Christian democracy_. God bless the sturdy\r\npeople of New England and the Middle States for this! God bless George\r\nWashington and Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall and the liberal gentlemen\r\nof the Old Dominion, for helping the people do it. They did not win the\r\nvictory, as many have supposed; but they bravely helped to lead the\r\npeople of the Free States to this great military and civil achievement.\r\nVirginia was richly paid for the service of her aristocracy. But history\r\ntells us who did the work, and how nobly it was done.\r\n\r\nThe republic was now established, with a Constitution which might be\r\nmade to uphold a democratic or an aristocratic government, as either\r\nparty should triumph. The Slave Power, forced half reluctantly into the\r\nUnion, now began to conspire to rule it for its own uses. All that was\r\nnecessary, it thought, was to unite the aristocracy against the people.\r\nAnd this work was at once well begun. The first census was taken in\r\n1790, and the last in 1860. This period divides itself, historically,\r\ninto two portions. The thirty years from 1780 may be regarded as the\r\nperiod of the _consolidation of the Slave Power, and its first distinct\r\nappearance as a great sectional aristocracy in 1820, in the struggle\r\nthat resulted in the 'Missouri Compromise_.' The forty years succeeding\r\n1820 may be called the period of the _consolidation of freedom to resist\r\nthis assault, and the final triumph of democracy in 1860, by the\r\nelection of a President_.\r\n\r\nThe first thirty years was a period of incessant activity by the slave\r\naristocracy. It incurred a nominal loss in the abolition of slavery in\r\neight Eastern and Middle States, and the consecration of the great\r\nNorthwestern territory to freedom; out of which three great Free States\r\nhad already been carved; making, in 1820, eleven Free States. But it had\r\ngained by the concentration of its power below the line of the Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania boundary, the division of the territory belonging to the\r\nCarolinas, and the Louisiana purchase; whereby it had gained five new\r\nSlave States; making the number of Slave States equal to the\r\nFree--eleven. It put forward the liberal aristocracy of Virginia to\r\noccupy the Presidential chair during thirty-two of the thirty-six years\r\nbetween 1789 and 1825; thus compelling Virginia and Maryland to a firm\r\nalliance with itself. It had man[oe]uvred the country through a great\r\npolitical struggle and a foreign war, both of which were chiefly\r\nengineered to secure the consolidation of the slave aristocracy. In\r\n1820 its power was extended in eleven States, containing four hundred\r\nand twenty-four thousand square miles, with one hundred and seventy-nine\r\nthousand square miles of territory sure to come in as Slave States; and\r\nthe remainder of the Louisiana purchase not secure to liberty. It had a\r\nwhite population only seven hundred thousand less, while its white and\r\nblack population was a million more than all the Free States.\r\n\r\nThe North was barely half as large in area of States: two hundred and\r\nseventy thousand square miles, with only one hundred thousand square\r\nmiles in reserve of the territory dedicated to liberty. With an equality\r\nof representation in the Senate of the United States, and a firm hold of\r\nall the branches of the Government, the prospect of the oligarchy for\r\nsuccess was brilliant. In every nation the aristocracy first gets\r\npossession, organizes first, and proceeds deliberately to seize and\r\nadminister the government. The people are always unsuspicious, slow,\r\nlate in organizing, and seem to blunder into success or be led to it by\r\na Providence higher than themselves. In this Government the slave\r\naristocracy first consolidated, and in 1820 appeared boldly on the\r\narena, claiming the superiority, and threatening ruin to the republic in\r\nthe event of the failure of their plans. It had managed so well that\r\nthere was now no division in its ranks, and for the last forty years has\r\nmoved forward in solid column to repeated assaults on liberty.\r\n\r\nThe people, as usual, did not suspect the existence of this concentrated\r\npower till 1820. They made a brave militia fight then against the\r\naristocracy, and compelled it to acknowledge a drawn battle by the\r\nadmission of Maine to balance Missouri, and the establishment of a line\r\nof compromise, which would leave all territory north of 36 deg. 30'\r\nconsecrated to freedom. The Slave Power submitted with anger, intending\r\nto break the bargain as soon as it was strong enough, and continued on\r\nits relentless struggle for power. It determined to gain possession of\r\nthe Senate of the United States; make it a house of nobles; control\r\nthrough it the foreign policy, the Executive, and the Supreme Court;\r\nand, with this advantage, reckoned it could always manage the House of\r\nRepresentatives and govern the nation. The key to all the political\r\npolicy of the Slave Power through these last forty years is this\r\nendeavor to capture the Senate of the United States, and hold it, by\r\nbringing in a superior _number_ of Slave States. So well did it play\r\nthis card that, till 1850, it maintained an equality of senatorial\r\nrepresentation, and, by the help of Northern allies and the superior\r\npolitical dexterity of the aristocracy, controlled our foreign policy;\r\nkept its own representatives in all the great courts of Europe; made\r\npeace or war at will; managed the Executive through a veto on his\r\nappointments; and endeavored to fill the Supreme Court with men in favor\r\nof its policy, while the House of Representatives never was able to pass\r\na measure without its consent. Under the past forty years' reign of the\r\nSlave Power, the Senate of the United States has been a greater farce in\r\nthe republic than the crown and House of Lords in the British empire.\r\nIndeed, so well did this aristocracy play its part, _that it was\r\nsupposed by the whole world to be the American Government_; and the news\r\nthat the people of the United States had refused, in 1860, to register\r\nits behests, was received abroad with the same astonishment and\r\nindignation as if there had been a revolt of the subjects of any\r\nEuropean nation against their anointed rulers.\r\n\r\nBut spite of these great advantages at the outset--spite of its\r\nincredible political activity and admirable concentration, the slave\r\naristocracy was finally defeated by the people. How this was done is the\r\nmost interesting narrative in modern history. Never has the intrinsic\r\nsuperiority of a democratic over an aristocratic order of society been\r\nso magnificently vindicated as during the last forty years of our\r\nnational career. During that period the free portion of this Union has\r\ngrown to an overwhelming superiority over the slave portion, and\r\ncompelled the slaveholders to draw the sword to save themselves from\r\nmaterial and providential destruction.\r\n\r\nThis period of forty years may be regarded as that of the _consolidation\r\nof the people_. The first thirty years of it was the era of their\r\n_industrial and social consolidation_; the last ten years has been the\r\nperiod of their _political union against the Slave Power_.\r\n\r\nAn aristocracy always exhibits the uttermost pitch of human policy in\r\nits career, and amazes and outwits society by its marvellous display of\r\nexecutive ability. But the people are always moved by great supernatural\r\nforces that are beyond their comprehension, often disowned or scorned by\r\nthem, but which mould their destiny and lead them to a victory spite of\r\nthemselves. The people always grow without conscious plan or method, and\r\nrarely know their own strength. But there are always a few great men who\r\nrepresent their destiny, and, often against their will, direct them in\r\nthe path to liberty. History will record the names of three great men\r\nwho, during the last forty years, have been the most notable figures in\r\nthis consolidation of the people in this republic; three men that the\r\nimplacable hatred of the Slave Power has singled out from all other\r\nNorthern men as special objects of infamy; men who represent the\r\nindustrial, moral, and political phases of the people's growth to\r\nsupremacy. Each came when he was wanted, and faithfully did his work;\r\nand their history is the chronicle of this advance of liberty in the\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nThe first of these men was De Witt Clinton, of New York. No Northern man\r\nso early discovered the deep game of the Slave Power as he. He was the\r\nablest statesman of the North in the days when the aristocracy of the\r\nSouth was just effecting its consolidation. He was a prominent candidate\r\nfor the Presidency, and was scornfully put down by the power that ruled\r\nat Richmond. The slaveholders knew him for their clear-headed enemy, and\r\ndrove him out of the arena of national politics. Never was political\r\ndefeat so auspicious. Cured of the political ambition of his youth, Mr.\r\nClinton turned the energies of his massive genius to the _industrial\r\nconsolidation of the North_. He saw that all future political triumph of\r\nliberty must rest on the triumph of free labor. He anticipated the\r\ncoming greatness of the Northwest, and boldly devoted his life to the\r\ninauguration of that system of internal improvements which has made the\r\nNorthern States the mighty, free industrial empire it now is. Within the\r\nperiod of ten years lying nearest 1820, the people, under the lead of\r\nClinton and his associates, had brought into active operation the three\r\ngreat agencies of free labor--the steamer, the canal, the railroad;\r\nwhile our manufacturing industry dates from the same period.\r\n\r\nThis was the providential movement of a great people, organizing a\r\nmethod of labor which should overthrow the American aristocracy. Of\r\ncourse the people did not know what all this meant; thousands of the men\r\nwho were foremost in organizing Northern industry did not suspect the\r\nend; but De Witt Clinton knew. The wiseacres of the city of New York\r\nnicknamed his canal 'Clinton's Ditch.' It was the first ditch in that\r\nseries of continental 'parallels' by which the people of the North have\r\napproached the citadel of the Slave Power. They have dug in those vast\r\nintrenchments for forty years, to such purpose that in 1860 the great\r\nguns of free labor commanded every plantation in the Union. Pardon them,\r\nthen, O lieutenant-generals of the slavery forces, if they still think\r\nwell of the spade that has dug their highway to power. The Northern\r\nspade is a slow machine--but it will yet shovel the slave aristocracy\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico as sure as God lives!\r\n\r\nGlance over this field of industrial and material growth in the free\r\nportion of the Union, as it appeared in 1860.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Free States had increased to nineteen, while the Slave\r\nStates were fifteen, containing eight hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\nsquare miles. The people had nine hundred and fifty thousand square\r\nmiles organized into free-labor States, with eight vast Territories,\r\ncontaining one million square miles, an area equal to twenty-four States\r\nas large as New York. In this vast extent of States and Territories,\r\nincluding two thirds the land of the Union, there were not a hundred\r\nslaves. _The Government holds all those States and Territories to-day._\r\n\r\nLook at the position and value of these possessions of freedom. In 1850\r\nliberty secured the great State of California, and in 1860 the State of\r\nKansas. These States insure the possession of the whole Pacific coast,\r\nthe entire mineral wealth of the mountains, the Indian Territory, and\r\nthe vast spaces of Northwestern Texas to freedom, and open Mexico to\r\nNorthern occupation. In the East, freedom had already secured the best\r\nharbors for commerce; in the Northwest, the granary of the world; the\r\ninexhaustible mineral wealth of Lake Superior, and the navigation of\r\nthousands of miles upon the great inland seas that separate the republic\r\nfrom the Canadas. From the Northern Atlantic and the Pacific it\r\ncommanded the trade of Europe and Asia. This region embraces the best\r\nclimates of the continent for the habitation of a vigorous race of men,\r\nand contains all the elements of imperial power.\r\n\r\nFreedom had secured, in 1860, a population of twenty millions, while the\r\nSlave Power had reached but twelve millions, one third of whom were\r\nslaves. From 1850 to 1860 the Union _gained_ almost as much in\r\npopulation as the entire census of 1820; and of that gain the North\r\nsecured forty-one and the South but twenty-seven per cent. The slave\r\npopulation increased but twenty-three per cent. At this rate of increase\r\nthe year 1900 will see a population of one hundred millions in the\r\nUnion, of whom nine millions will be negroes, and a vast majority of the\r\nwhite population located in territory now free. Between 1820 and 1860\r\nfive million emigrants reenforced the Union, of which the North received\r\nthe greater portion. Between the war of 1814 and 1860, Great Britain and\r\nIreland sent to us more people than inhabited the thirteen States that\r\nformed the Union, and of this immigrant population there was an excess\r\nof nine hundred and fifty thousand _men_--a nation poured in upon the\r\ngreat, free North, to reenforce the people.\r\n\r\nAlready was this increase of free population telling upon slave labor in\r\nSlave States. Even in the Gulf cities Sambo was fast receding before the\r\nbrawny arms of Hans and Patrick. Northwestern Texan was becoming a new\r\nGermany. Western Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, and Delaware were rapidly\r\nlosing in slave labor; while along the border had grown up a line of ten\r\ncities in Slave States, containing six hundred thousand people, of whom\r\nless than ten thousand were slaves. This line of cities, from Wilmington\r\nDelaware, to St. Louis, Missouri, was becoming a great cordon of\r\nfree-labor citadels; supported in the rear by another line of Free\r\nBorder-State cities, stretching from Philadelphia to Leavenworth,\r\ncontaining nine hundred thousand; thus _massing a free population of one\r\nmillion five hundred thousand in border cities that overlooked the land\r\nof despotism_.\r\n\r\nThen consider the growth of free agriculture. In 1860 the South had a\r\ncotton and rice crop as her exclusive possession. Already the Northwest\r\nwas encroaching upon her sugar cultivation. Against her agriculture,\r\nmainly supported by one great staple, which can also be cultivated all\r\nround the globe, the free North could oppose every variety of crop;\r\nseveral of greater value than the boasted cotton. In all the grains, in\r\ncattle and the products of the dairy, in hay, in fruits; in the superior\r\ncultivation of land; in the vastly superior value of land; in\r\nagricultural machinery, probably representing a labor force equal to all\r\nthe slaves--the superiority of freedom was too evident for discussion.\r\n_The value of agricultural machinery in the Free States had trebled\r\nbetween 1850 and 1860_. The Homestead Law was the fit result of this\r\nvast advance of free labor, and has sealed the destiny of every present\r\nand future Territory of the Union.\r\n\r\nThen contemplate the vast expansion of manufacturing industry, of which\r\nnine tenths belong to the Free States. _In ten years from 1850 to 1860,\r\nthis branch of labor had increased eighty-six per cent._, reaching the\r\nenormous sum of $2,000,000,000; $60 for every inhabitant of the Union. A\r\nmillion and a half of people were engaged as operatives therein,\r\nsupporting nearly five millions--one sixth the whole population of the\r\nUnion; while fully one third our population may be said to directly and\r\nindirectly live by manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe increase of iron manufactures in ten years was forty-four per cent.;\r\nthe coal mines reached a treble yield in ten years; $10,000,000, of\r\nclothing were produced in 1860. The lumber trade had increased\r\nsixty-four percent, in ten years, reaching $100,000,000. Flouring mills\r\nshowed sixty-five per cent, increase, reaching $225,000,000; spirits,\r\n$24,000,000; cotton manufactures had increased seventy-six per cent, in\r\nten years, reaching $115,000,000; woollens had increased sixty-seven per\r\ncent.; boots and shoes walked up to $76,000,000, and leather to\r\n$63,000,000. The fishermen of New England increased mightily. The gold\r\nof California, copper of the Northwest, the salt of New York and\r\nMichigan had reached colossal proportions. Whoever studies the\r\nmanufacturing statistics of the North for the past ten years will be at\r\nno loss to know why the manufacturers of Great Britain are willing to\r\nsever the Slave States from the Union, to gain a customer it was thus\r\nsupplying in 1860.\r\n\r\nNow add to this array of agriculture, manufactures, extent of territory,\r\nand excess of population, the superiority of the Free States in\r\ncommerce. The tonnage of the Union was twenty-six millions in 1860, the\r\nfourth of which was the growth of the ten years previous. Out of the one\r\nthousand and seventy-one ships built in 1860, the 'nation' of South\r\nCarolina produced one steamer and one schooner! Contemplate the money\r\npower of the city of New York, the vast capital invested in trade, in\r\nbanks, insurance, and the like, in the North. The slave aristocracy was\r\nbecoming imprisoned in a vast web of financial dependence--a web that\r\nwar and wholesale repudiation of debts alone could break through.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 there were in the Union 30,- 600 miles of railroad, costing\r\n$1,134,- 452,909, four times the extent of 1850. In 1850 only one line\r\nof railroad connected the Atlantic with the Mississippi. Now, of the\r\neight great railroad and canal routes connecting the sea coast with this\r\nvalley, six run through the Free States; transportation on these avenues\r\ncosts but one tenth the old methods. Governor Letcher declares the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad has 'abolitionized' Northern and Western\r\nVirginia, and the Southern rebellion has been especially savage on\r\nrailroads. Whoever would understand one secret of the consolidation of\r\nthe people should study the railroad map of the Northern States, and\r\ncontrast it with the South. It was a fine tribute to the value of the\r\nrailroad that the first use the people made of their new political\r\nsupremacy in 1860 was to pass the bill for connecting the Atlantic and\r\nPacific by the iron rail and the telegraphic wire.\r\n\r\nThis vast advancement in free labor, from 1820 to 1850, was fitly closed\r\nin 1850 by the annexation of California to the roll of the Free States,\r\nsecuring to liberty the gold mines and the Pacific coast. It is\r\nimpossible to comprehend all the consequences of this step. It was the\r\ndecisive industrial triumph of the people over the slave aristocracy.\r\nThe Slave Power went mad over the defeat, _and for the last ten years\r\nhas virtually abandoned the rivalry of industries, and turned to\r\nviolence_, breaking of compromises, forcible seizure of the ballot box,\r\nrepudiation of debts, stealing of arms, and finally cruel war, as if\r\nlying and robbing, in the long run, could upset free and honest\r\nindustry. After the loss of California and the Pacific coast, the\r\nstruggle for the Territories was but a, preliminary skirmish of the war\r\nfor the conquest and desolation of the Union. The people had _waged the\r\nbattle of liberty with the gigantic agencies of material prosperity for\r\nforty years, and the aristocracy was completely in their power_.\r\n\r\nFor this material superiority of the free-labor States inevitably inured\r\nto the advantage of liberty. In vain did every new Free State, year\r\nafter year, vote with the Slave Power; in vain did every great railroad\r\nand manufacturing corporation of the North obey the political behests of\r\nthe lords of the plantations; in vain was the mercantile aristocracy of\r\nall the great cities the fast friend of the slave aristocracy; and\r\nvainly did almost the entire immigrant population fall politically into\r\nits control. All this was as nothing _against the irresistible natural\r\ntendency of free labor_. The Irishman who voted against the negro was\r\nbreaking his chain with every blow of his pick. The Wall-street banker,\r\nthe great railroad king, the cotton manufacturer, who railed against\r\nabolitionism like mad, were condemning the slave aristocracy every day\r\nthey lived. There is a divine law by which the work of freemen shall\r\nroot out the work of slaves; and no law enacted by the will of Northern\r\ndoughfaces could repeal this statute of nature. These Northern friends\r\nof the aristocracy supposed themselves to be helping their ambitious\r\nallies by their political support. But the slaveholders knew how\r\nfallacious was this aid. They saw that the North was gaining a huge\r\nsuperiority to the South; that the people were slowly consolidating;\r\nthat when the free-labour interest did finally concentrate, it would\r\ncarry every Northern interest with it, and, when the pinch came, no\r\nNorthern party or statesman could or would help them do their will. They\r\ncarefully sifted all offers of aid from such quarters, and having used\r\nevery Northern interest and institution and party till it was squeezed\r\ndry of all its black blood, they turned their backs haughtily on the\r\nwhite sections of the Union, plundered friend and foe alike, and flew\r\ninto civil war, out of spite and rage at the census of 1860; in other\r\nwords, _declared war against the providence of God as manifested in the\r\nprogress of free society_. They have fought well; at first, perhaps,\r\nbetter than we; but when General Lee 'flanks' the industrial decrees of\r\nthe Almighty, and Stuart 'cuts the communications' between free labor\r\nand imperial power, they will destroy this republic--and not till then.\r\n\r\nBut was this great material gain of the people to be accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding spiritual advancement? _Was man to become the chief object\r\nof reverence in this wonderfully expanding industrial empire?_ If not,\r\nall this progress was deceptive, and nobody could predict how soon our\r\nvery superiority should be turned to the advantage of that aristocracy\r\nwhich had perverted so many things in the republic.\r\n\r\nIt could not be denied that the Free States were making wonderful\r\nstrides, during these forty years, in mental cultivation and power. The\r\nfree industry of the North was an education to the people, and nowhere\r\nhas so much popular intelligence been carried into the business of life\r\nas here. This period also witnessed the organization of the free school\r\neverywhere outside of New England, its home; the daily press, the public\r\nlecture, the creation of an American literature, all Northern; the\r\ngrowth of all institutions of learning and means of intellectual and\r\nartistic cultivation unparalleled in any other age or land. No\r\nwell-informed person could also deny the astonishing progress in\r\nfurnishing the means of religious instruction, the multiplication of\r\nchurches, great ecclesiastical organizations, and philanthropic leagues.\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent absorption of the North in its material\r\nprosperity, no people ever was so busy in furnishing itself with the\r\nmeans of spiritual improvement; and though a population of several\r\nmillions of ignorant and superstitious foreigners was thrown in upon it\r\nduring these eventful years, it came out at the end the most intelligent\r\npeople, the best provided with the apparatus of religion, that was ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nBut there was one element yet wanting to assure the right usage of all\r\nthis wealth of material, intellectual, and ecclesiastical power. This\r\nwas what the slaveholding aristocracy saw at once to be the fatal omen\r\nfor their cause, and nicknamed 'Abolitionism.' _Abolitionism, as\r\nrecognized by the Slave Power, is nothing more nor less than the\r\nreligious reverence for man and his natural rights._ This moral respect\r\nfor the nature and rights of all men has always encountered the peculiar\r\nscorn of aristocracies, and no men have been so bitterly persecuted in\r\nhistory as those who represented the religious opposition to despotism.\r\nThe Hebrew aristocracy in old Palestine called this sentiment 'atheism'\r\nin Jesus Christ, and crucified Him. The pagan aristocracy called it a\r\n'devilish superstition' in the early Christians, and slaughtered them\r\nlike cattle. The priestly and civil absolutism of the sixteenth century\r\ncalled it 'fanaticism' in the Dutch and German reformers, and fought it\r\neighty years with fire and rack and sword. The church and crown\r\nnicknamed it 'Puritanism,' and persecuted it till it turned and cut off\r\nthe head of Charles the First, and secured religious liberty. The slave\r\naristocracy stigmatized it 'Abolitionism,' and let loose upon it every\r\ninfernal agency in its power.\r\n\r\nOne great man, yet alive, but not yet recognized as he will be, was the\r\nrepresentative of this religious reverence for the rights of man. Lloyd\r\nGarrison has been, for the last twenty-five years, the best-hated man in\r\nthese Northern States, not because he failed to see just how a Union of\r\nFree and Slave States could endure; not because of any visionary theory\r\nof political action or the structure of society he cherished; but,\r\nstrangely enough, because _he stood-up for man and his divine right to\r\nfreedom_. This was what the aristocracy hated in him, and this is what,\r\nwith inexpressible rage, it saw gaining in the North. It truly said that\r\nour education, our arts, our literature, our press, our churches, our\r\nbenevolent organizations, our families, all that was best in Northern\r\nsociety, even our politics, were being consolidated by this\r\n'fanaticism,' Puritanism,' 'Abolitionism'--otherwise, by _reverence for\r\nman and his right to freedom_.\r\n\r\nIt grew, however, almost as fast as the material power of the\r\nNorth--this moral conviction of the divine right of man to liberty; grew\r\nso fast, that in 1860, South Carolina glanced over the November election\r\nreturns, saw the name of Abraham Lincoln at the head, shrieked, '_The\r\nNorth is abolitionized!_' and rushed out of the Union, with ten other\r\nSlave States at her heels, while four more were held back by the strong\r\narm of the national power. The North is not yet 'abolitionized,' but\r\nevery volley fired at liberty by the Slave Power these last three years,\r\nhas killed a lover of slavery, and made an Abolitionist; as the juggler\r\nfires his pistol at your old black hat, and, when the smoke clears up, a\r\nwhite dove flutters in its place. If the Slave Power shoots at us long\r\nenough, we shall all become Abolitionists, and all learn to love our\r\nfellow man and protect him in the enjoyment of every right given him by\r\nGod!\r\n\r\nThus had the Free States, the people's part of the Union, gone up\r\nsteadily to overshadowing material, intellectual, moral power. But up to\r\n1850 this mighty growth had got no fit expression in State or national\r\npolitics. All the great parties had mildly tried to remonstrate with the\r\nslave aristocracy, but quickly recoiled as from the mouth of a furnace.\r\nA few attempts had been made to organize a party for freedom, but\r\nnothing could gain foothold at Washington. A few noble men had lifted\r\ntheir voices against the rampant tyranny of the slaveholders: chief\r\namong these was John Quincy Adams, the John the Baptist crying in the\r\ndesert of American partisan politics the coming of the kingdom of\r\nHeaven! But when the people had come up to a consciousness of their\r\nconsolidated power, and the reverence for human right was changing and\r\npolarizing every Northern institution--in the fierce struggle that\r\nushered in and succeeded the admission of California, between 1848 and\r\n1856--this Northern superiority culminated in a great political movement\r\nagainst slavery. _This movement assumed a double form-positive, in the\r\nassertion that the Slave Power should be arrested; negative, in the\r\nassertion that the people should have their own way with it._ The\r\nRepublican party said: _The slave aristocracy shall go no farther._ The\r\n'Popular Sovereignty' party, or Douglas Democracy, said: _The people\r\nshall do what they choose about this matter._ Now the people were\r\nalready the superior power in the republic, and were rapidly growing to\r\nhate the Slave Power; so the slaveholders, saw that the Northern\r\nDemocracy, with their war cry of _popular sovereignty_, might in time be\r\njust as dangerous to them as their more open enemies. They repudiated\r\nboth forms of Northern politics, and tied the executive, under James\r\nBuchanan, and the Supreme Court, under Judge Taney, to their dogma: _The\r\nright of the aristocracy is supreme. Slavery, not liberty, is the law of\r\nthe republic._\r\n\r\nThe great leaders of these Northern parties were Stephen H. Douglas and\r\nWilliam H. Seward. Mr. Douglas was the best practical politician,\r\npopular debater, and magnetizer of the masses, the North has yet\r\nproduced. _He was the representative of the blind power of the North_,\r\nand stood up all his life, in his better hours, for the right of the\r\npeople to make the republic what they would. But the representative\r\nstatesman of the era is the Secretary of State. The whole career of Mr.\r\nSeward is so interwoven with the history of the political consolidation\r\nof the people against the Slave Power, that the two must be studied\r\ntogether to be understood. Nowhere so clearly and eloquently as in the\r\npages of this great philosophical statesman can be read the rapid growth\r\nof that political movement that in twelve years captured every Free\r\nState, placed a President in the chair, and then, with a splendid\r\ngenerosity, invited the whole loyal people to unite in a party of the\r\nUnion, _knowing that henceforth the Union meant the people and liberty\r\nagainst the aristocracy and slavery_. And only in the light of this view\r\ncan the course of this man and his great seeming opponent, but real\r\nassociate, be fitly displayed. _Douglas had taught the people of the\r\nNorth that their will should be the law of the republic. Seward had told\r\nthem that will should be in accordance with the 'higher law' of justice\r\nand freedom._ Like men fighting in the dark, they supposed themselves\r\neach other's enemies, while they were only commanders of the front and\r\nrear of the army of the people. Both appeared on the national arena in\r\nthe struggle of 1850, and soon strode to the first place. The Slave\r\nPower repudiated Seward and his 'higher law' of justice and liberty at\r\nonce. They tolerated Douglas and his 'popular sovereignty ' ten years\r\nlonger, when they found it even a more dangerous heresy, and threw him\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nIn the election of 1860 there were but two parties--the two wings of the\r\npeople's army, under the patriots Lincoln and Douglas; the two wings of\r\nthe slave host, under the traitors Breckinridge and Bell. Of course the\r\npeople triumphed. Had Douglas been elected instead of Lincoln, the Slave\r\nPower would not have stayed in the Union one hour longer. _It was not\r\nLincoln, but the political supremacy of the people they resisted._ The\r\nFree States had at last consolidated, never to recede, and that was\r\nenough. Henceforth no party could live in the North that espoused the\r\ncause of this rebel aristocracy. Whoever was Governor or President,\r\nDemocrat, Republican, Union, what not, the people's party was henceforth\r\nsupreme, and the aristocracy, with all its works of darkness, was second\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThe political victory of 1860 was virtually complete. For the first time\r\nin eighty years had the people concentrated against the Slave Power. The\r\nexecutive was gained, placing the army, navy, appointments, and\r\npatronage in the hands of the President, the people's representative by\r\nbirth and choice. The North had a majority of eight in the Senate and\r\nsixty-five in the House of Representatives, insuring a control of the\r\nforeign policy and the financial affairs of the republic; while the\r\nSupreme Court, the last bulwark of despotism, could be reconstructed in\r\nthe interest of the Constitution. It is true the people did not\r\nappreciate the magnitude of the victory, or realize what it implied.\r\nThey would probably have made no special use of it at once, and the\r\naristocracy might have outwitted them again, as they had for three\r\nquarters of a century past. But the slaveholders knew that now was just\r\nthe time to strike. If they waited till the people understood themselves\r\nbetter, and learned how to administer the Government for liberty, it\r\nwould be too late. They still had possession of the executive, with all\r\nthe departments, the Supreme Court, army, and navy, for four precious\r\nmonths. This was improved in inflicting as much damage on the Government\r\nas possible, and organizing a confederacy of revolted States. The people\r\ndid not believe they would fight, and offered them various compromises,\r\n_everything except the thing they desired--unlimited power to control\r\nthe republic_. The aristocracy knew that no compromises would do them\r\ngood which proposed anything less than a reconstruction of the Union\r\nwhich would insure their perpetual supremacy. They even doubted if this\r\ncould be effectually accomplished in a peaceful way. The people must\r\nfirst be subdued by arms, their Union destroyed, and brought to the\r\nverge of anarchy by this mighty power, backed by the whole despotism of\r\nEurope; then might they be compelled to accept such terms as it chose to\r\ndictate. It waited no longer than was necessary to complete its\r\npreparations, and opened ed its guns in Charleston harbor. When the\r\nsmoke of that cannonade drifted away, the people beheld with\r\nconsternation the Slave Powers arrayed in arms, from Baltimore and St.\r\nLouis to New Orleans and the Rio Grande, advancing to seize their\r\ncapital and overthrow the republic.\r\n\r\nHaving conquered the aristocracy by its industry, education, religion,\r\nand politics--driven it from every position on the great field of\r\nAmerican society in an era of peace--the people slowly awoke to the\r\nconviction that they must now conquer it on the field of arms. They were\r\nslow to come to that conviction. Their ablest leaders were not\r\nwar-statesmen, and did not comprehend at once the full meaning of the\r\nwar. They called it a 'conspiracy,' a 'rebellion,' an 'insurrection,' a\r\n'summer madness,' anything but what it was--_the American stave\r\naristocracy in arms to subdue the people of the United States with every\r\nother aristocracy on earth wishing it success_. But the people did not\r\nrefuse the challenge. In April, 1861, they rushed to the capital, saved\r\ntheir Government from immediate capture or dispersion, and then began to\r\nprepare, after their way, for--they hardly knew what--to suppress a riot\r\nor wage a civil war.\r\n\r\nIn every such conflict as this the aristocracy has a great advantage,\r\nespecially if it can choose its own time to begin the war. Never was an\r\noligarchy more favored in its preparations than ours. Since 1820 it had\r\ncontemplated and prepared for this very hour. It had almost unlimited\r\ncontrol over fifteen States of the Union. Society was constructed in all\r\nthese States on a military basis, the laboring class being held in place\r\nby the power of the sword. An aristocracy is always preceded by military\r\nambition; for all subordinate orders of its people have acquired the\r\nhabit of respect for rank and implicit obedience to superiors, so\r\nessential to success in war. When the war broke out, the Slave Power was\r\nready. Its arms and ammunition and forts were stolen; its military\r\norganizations had been perfected in secret societies; its generals were\r\nselected--its president perhaps the best general of all; its military\r\nsurveys were made, every Southern State mapped, and every strategical\r\npoint marked; its subordinate officers, in which the real efficiency of\r\nan army consists, had been educated in military schools kept by such\r\nteachers as Hill and Stonewall Jackson. It had a full crop of cotton as\r\na basis for finance. Its government was practically such a despotism as\r\ndoes not exist in the world. At the sound of the first gun in\r\nCharleston, the aristocracy sprang to arms; in a fortnight every\r\nstrategical point in fifteen States was practically in its possession,\r\nand Washington tottered to its fall.\r\n\r\nThe people, as the people always are, were unprepared for war. Their\r\nentire energies had been concentrated for forty years in organizing the\r\ngigantic victory of peace which they had just achieved. When they woke\r\nup to the idea that there was yet another battle to be fought before the\r\naristocracy would subside, they _began to learn the art of war_. And\r\nnever did the people begin a great war so unprepared. The people of\r\nEurope have always had military traditions and cultivation to fall back\r\nupon in their civil wars. The North had no military traditions later\r\nthan the Revolution, for no war since that day had really called forth\r\ntheir hearty efforts. Three generations of peace had destroyed even\r\nrespect for war as an employment fit for civilized men. There were not\r\nten thousand trained soldiers in all the nineteen States in April, 1861.\r\nThere were not good arms to furnish fifty thousand troops in the\r\npossession of the National or loyal State Governments. Most of the\r\nablest military men of the North had left the army, and were engaged in\r\npeaceful occupations. Halleck was in the law; McClellan, Burnside,\r\nBanks, on the railroad; Mitchel and Sigel teaching schoolboys; Hooker,\r\nKearny, McCall, Dix, retired gentlemen; Fremont digging gold; Rosecrans\r\nmanufacturing oil, and Grant in a tanyard; and so on to the end of the\r\nchapter; while Scott, the patriot hero, who was but once defeated in\r\nfifty years' service, was passing over into the helplessness of old age.\r\nOf course such a people did not realize the value of military education,\r\nand fell into the natural delusion that a multitude of men carrying guns\r\nand wearing blue coats is an army; and any 'smart man' can make a\r\ncolonel in three months. There was not even a corporal in the Cabinet,\r\nand Mr, Lincoln's military exploits were confined to one campaign, in\r\nthe war of 1812, and one challenge to fight a duel. There were not ten\r\nNorthern men in Congress who could take a company into action. In short,\r\nwe had the art of war to learn; even did not know it was necessary to\r\nlearn to fight as to do anything else; especially to fight against an\r\naristocracy that had been studying war for forty years.\r\n\r\nFor more than three years have the people of the United States waged\r\nthis gigantic war thus precipitated upon them by their aristocracy to\r\narrest the irresistible growth of modern society in the republic. Every\r\nyear has been a period of great success, though our peaceful population,\r\nunacquainted with war, and often ignorant of the vast issues of this\r\nconflict, have often inclined to despondency. Of course the aristocracy\r\nfought best, at first, as every aristocracy in the world has done. With\r\nhalf our number of better disciplined troops, better commanded and\r\nman[oe]uvred, and the great advantage of interior lines, supported by\r\nrailroad communications, and possessing in Virginia, perhaps, the most\r\ndefensible region in the Union, they held our Army of the Potomac at bay\r\nfor two years; have thrice overrun Maryland and the Pennsylvania border,\r\nand yet hold their fortified capital; while every step of our victorious\r\nprogress in the Southwest has been bitterly contested. Yet this war of\r\nmartial forces has been strangely like the long, varied war of material,\r\nmoral, and political forces of which it is the logical sequel.\r\n\r\nThe Union navy won the earliest laurels in the war. The navy has been\r\nthe right arm of the people in all ages. The Athenian navy repelled the\r\ninvasion of Greece by the Persian empire. Antony, Pompey, Caesar, the\r\npeople's leaders in Rome, built up their youthful power upon the sea.\r\nThe Dutch and English navies saved religious and civil liberty in the\r\nsixteenth century; and all the constitutional Governments that now exist\r\nin Europe came out of the hold of a British man-of-war. The United\r\nStates, in 1812, extemporized a navy that gained us the freedom of the\r\nseas. And now the navy has led the way in the war for the freedom of the\r\ncontinent. The aristocracy felt, intuitively, the danger of this arm of\r\ndefence, and discouraged, scattered, and almost annihilated our naval\r\npower before they entered upon the war. When we learn that our active\r\nnavy, in April, 1861, consisted of one frigate, too large to sail over\r\nthe bar of Charleston harbor, and one two-gun supply ship; and that in\r\nthe three successive years it has shot up into a force of five hundred\r\nvessels; that our new ironclads and guns have revolutionized the art of\r\nnaval warfare; that we have established the most effective blockade ever\r\nknown along two thousand miles of dangerous coast; have captured Port\r\nRoyal and New Orleans, aided in the opening of the Mississippi and all\r\nits dependencies which we now patrol, penetrated to the cotton fields of\r\nAlabama, occupied the inland waters of North Carolina and Virginia,\r\nseized every important rebel port and navy yard save four, and destroyed\r\nevery war ship of the enemy that has ventured in range of our cannon, we\r\nare pronouncing a eulogy of which any people may be proud. One year more\r\nwill swell this maritime power to a force amply sufficient to protect\r\nthe coast of the whole republic from all assault of traitors at home or\r\ntheir friends abroad.\r\n\r\nBut the army of the Union has not been content to remain permanently\r\nbehind the navy. Even in the first year of the conflict, when it was\r\nonly a crowd of seventy-five thousand undisciplined militia, contending\r\nagainst a solid body of well-disciplined and commanded forces, it\r\nwrested two States from the foe, and baffled his intentions for the\r\ncapture of all our great border cities. But since the opening of the\r\ncampaign of 1802, the real beginning of war by the North, we have\r\nconquered from the aristocracy and now hold fast in Slave States an\r\narea of two hundred thousand square miles, inhabited by four millions of\r\npeople--a district larger than France. Three years ago, every Slave\r\nState was virtually in the grasp of the rebels, and the Union was really\r\nput upon the defensive to protect freedom in the Free States and the\r\nnational capital. Now, by a masterly series of campaigns in the West and\r\nSouthwest, ranging from the Alleghanies to the Gulf, in which we have\r\nnever lost a decisive battle, we have saved all the Territories of the\r\nUnited States, cut the 'Confederacy' in two equal parts, holding the\r\nwestern division at our mercy, opened the Mississippi and all its\r\ntributaries, and crowded the rebellion into the five States nearest the\r\nAtlantic coast. In the east we have fought a score of battles with the\r\nmost formidable army ever marshalled on this continent, composed of the\r\nflower of the rebel soldiery led by their best generalship, and, spite\r\nof frequent repulses, have forced it from the Potomac and below the\r\nRappahannock to the James, away from the smell of salt water, holding\r\nfirmly every seaport from Washington to Wilmington, North Carolina, and\r\na belt of land and water commanding the approach to the interior of\r\nevery Atlantic State. The military force of the rebellion is rapidly\r\nbeing crowded into one army, not exceeding two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men, against which the mighty power of the Union can be\r\nmarshalled in overwhelming array. I know well enough that the decisive\r\nmoment will really come when we confront that desperate and veteran\r\nhost, on which the fate of aristocratic government upon this continent\r\ndepends. But we shall then have a great army of veterans, marshalled\r\nunder commanders fit to lead them in the name of liberty and the people.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange it has taken us three years to find who can fight\r\namong us. The Germans fought fifty years against religious despotism\r\nbefore they found Gustavus Adolphus to lead them to victory. The English\r\nfought ten years before Cromwell took command of his Ironsides. The\r\nFrench blundered ten years before the 'little corporal' led the army of\r\nthe republic over the Alps to dethrone half the monarchs of Europe. The\r\npeople had but one great general in the Revolutionary War. Until 1860\r\nthe aristocracy had furnished the only great American commander. But\r\ngreat generals have now appeared among the people; and if we fight\r\nstoutly and treat men fairly, our commander will appear when his army of\r\nveterans is ready.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy at first moved armies faster than the people, for the\r\nsame reason that the Tartars, the Cossacks, the Arabs, the Indians, and\r\nall semi-barbarians move more rapidly in war than a civilized people. A\r\nsemi-barbarous oligarchy fights because it loves war; a civilized people\r\nfights to _establish civilization and peace_. The Southern army carries\r\nlittle along, lives on the food and wears the dress of the semi-savage,\r\nand overruns vast spaces, leaving a smoking desolation and a ruined\r\nsociety. The Northern army moves slowly, because it carries American\r\ncivilization in its knapsack and baggage wagons, organizes republican\r\nsociety as it goes, and prepares to hold for liberty all it has gained.\r\nThe people's army has paved the way for liberty and a democratic order\r\nof society over two hundred thousand square miles, among four millions\r\nof people, in three years. New Orleans, Nashville, Memphis, Beaufort,\r\nAlexandria, every slave city in our possession, is being made over into\r\na free city.\r\n\r\nThe army goes slow because it is only the people's pioneer to level the\r\nmountains and fill up the valleys, and construct the highway of liberty\r\nfrom the Potomac to the Rio Grande. The Secretary of State has well\r\nsaid: '_The war means the dissolution of slave society._' It was entered\r\ninto with the distinct understanding that it was the last expedient to\r\nsave the negro oligarchy from ruin, and every day it goes on its\r\nthundering course it more emphatically pronounces its doom. The war for\r\nthe Union is the people's final contest for liberty, a contest in which\r\nthey will be victorious, as in the strife of industry, morals, and\r\npolitics. The people, like John Brown's soul, are 'marching on' to\r\ndissolve the slave oligarchy and establish democracy. The people now\r\npossess three fourths the territory, population, and wealth of the\r\nrepublic. There are yet some six million black and white people in the\r\nSouth to rescue from their masters, who now use them against us. They\r\nare being prepared for Union with us by this war. The poor white man\r\nwill be made better, more intelligent, more ambitious even, by service\r\nin the rebel army, and on the return of peace will become the small\r\nfarmer of a free soil. The black men will be raised, in due time made\r\nfreemen, and start as a free peasantry on a new career. A hundred\r\nthousand slaveholders, with their families, not more than one million of\r\npeople in all, will hate the Union permanently. They will be defeated,\r\nwe hope and believe, and disorganized as a social and political power,\r\nand the people rule in every State they have cursed by their ambition\r\nfor the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nWe do not prophesy just when or how the people will triumph. The\r\nvictory, we believe, will come; but whether all at once, or through\r\ntemporary revulsions of purpose and alternate truce and war, whether\r\nfinished by arms or yet cast again into the arena of polities, whether\r\nby occupying all this three millions of square miles of territory or\r\ngaining on despotism year by year, nobody knows. The Slave Power has not\r\nyet played its trump card. It has a hundred devilish resources yet to\r\nfoil us. It may yet try to use the negroes it still holds against us by\r\nemancipation. It may yet drag us into a war with Europe, and Saratoga\r\nand Lake Erie and Plattsburg, and Long Island and Trenton and Bunker\r\nHill, and Detroit and New Orleans may yet be fought over again. But we\r\nhave seen how, for the last forty years, the people of the United States\r\nhave strode on toward supremacy, led by a Power they did not always\r\nrecognize, and sometimes scorned, but led to victory spite of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere has indeed been a Divine Intelligence guiding the destiny of our\r\nrepublic by the 'higher law' of the progress of free society toward a\r\nChristian democracy. We do not think the Peace Party will be able to\r\nabolish that 'higher law,' as certain of our politicians expect. We\r\nbelieve God Almighty is shaping a free and exalted civilized nation out\r\nof this republic, by a law of progress which we did not make and cannot\r\nrepeal. We may postpone that nation by our folly and sins, but it must\r\nbe made. Through labor and education, and religion and arts, and\r\npolitics and war, 'it marches' on to supremacy--_the people's nation_.\r\nAnd when it is established it will be the controlling nation of this\r\ncontinent, one of the firmest powers on the earth, the terror of every\r\naristocracy, and the joy and hope of every people on the round globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDIVINE COMEDY-A POLISH DRAMA.\r\n\r\nDedicated to Mary\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n     'Il fut administe, parceque le niais demandait un pretre, puis\r\n     pende a la satisfaction generale,' etc, etc.--_Rapport du citoyen\r\n     Gaillot, commissaire de la sixieme chambre, an III., 5 prairial._\r\n\r\n     'The sacraments were administered to him, because the fool demanded\r\n     a priest; he was hung to the general satisfaction.'--_Report of\r\n     citizen Gaillot, commissary of the sixth session, 3d year, 5th\r\n     prairial._\r\n\r\n\r\nA song! a new song!\r\n\r\nWho will begin it? Who will end it?\r\n\r\nGive me the Past, clad in steel, barbed with iron, floating in knightly\r\nplumes! With magic power I would invoke before you gothic towers and\r\ncastellated turrets, bristling barbacans and mighty arches, baronial\r\nhalls and clustered shafts; I would throw around you the giant shadows\r\nof vaulted domes and of revered cathedrals: but it may not be; all that\r\nis with the Past: the Past is never to return!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpeak, whosoever thou mayst be, and tell me in what thou believest! It\r\nis easier to lose thy life than to invent a faith; to awaken any belief\r\nin it!\r\n\r\nShame upon you all, great and small, for all things pursue their own\r\ncourse in defiance of your schemes! You may be mean and wretched,\r\nwithout hearts and without brains, yet the world hastens to its allotted\r\ndestiny; it hurries you on whether you will or no, throws you in the\r\ndust, tosses you into wild confusion, or whirls you in resistless\r\ncircles, which cease not until they grow into dances of Death! But the\r\nworld rolls on--on; clouds and storms arise and vanish; then it grows\r\nslippery--new couples join the dance of Death--they totter--fall--lost\r\nin an abyss of blood--for it is slippery-blood-human blood is gushing\r\neverywhere, as if the path to peace led through a charnel house!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBehold the crowds of people thronging the gates of the cities, the\r\nhills, the valleys, and resting beneath the shadows of the trees! Tents\r\nare spread about, long boards are placed on the trunks of fallen trees\r\nor on pikes and sticks to serve as tables; they are covered with meat\r\nand drink, the full cups pass from hand to hand, and, as they touch the\r\neager mouth, threats, oaths, and curses press forth from the hot lips.\r\nFaster and faster fly the cups from hand to hand, beaded, bubbling,\r\nglittering, always filling, striking, tinkling, ringing, as they circle\r\namong the millions: Hurrah! hurrah! Long live the cup of drunkenness and\r\njoy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow fiercely they are agitated; how impatiently they wait! They murmur,\r\nthey break into riotous noise!\r\n\r\nPoor wretches! scarcely covered with their miserable rags, the seal of\r\nweary labors deeply stamped upon their sunburnt faces set with uncombed,\r\nbristling hair, the sweat starting from their rugged brows, their strong\r\nand horny hands armed with scythes, axes, hammers, hatchets, spades!\r\n\r\nLook at that broad youth with the pickaxe; at the slight one with the\r\nsword. Here is one who holds aloft a glittering pike; another who\r\nbrandishes a massive club with his brawny arm! There under the willows a\r\nboy crams cherries into his mouth with the one hand, and with the other\r\npunches the tree with a long, sharp awl. Women are also there, wives,\r\nmothers, daughters, poor and hungry as the men, Not a single trace of\r\nwomanly beauty, of healthful freshness upon them; their hair is\r\ndisordered and sprinkled with the dust of the highways, their tawny\r\nbodies scarcely covered with unsightly rags, their gloomy eyes seem\r\nfading into their sockets, only half open as if gluing together in very\r\nweariness: but they will soon be quickened, for the full cup flies from\r\nlip to lip, they quaff long draughts: Hurrah! hurrah! Long live the cup\r\nof drunkenness and joy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHark! a noise and rustling among the masses! Is it joy, or is it grief?\r\nWho can read the meaning of a thing so monstrously multiform!\r\n\r\nA man arrives, mounts a table, harangues and sways the multitude. His\r\nvoice drags and grates upon the ear, but hacks itself into sharp, strong\r\nwords, clearly heard and easily understood; his gestures are slow and\r\nlight, accompanying his words as music, song. His brow is high and\r\nstrong, his head is entirely bald; thought has uprooted its last hair.\r\nHis skin is dull and tawny, the blood never tinges its dingy pallor, no\r\nemotion ever paints its secrets there, yellow wrinkles form and cross\r\nbetween the bones and muscles of his face, and a dark beard, like a\r\nblack wreath, encircles it from temple to temple. He fastens a steady\r\ngaze upon his hearers, no doubt or hesitation ever clouds his clear,\r\ncold eye. When he raises his arm and stretches it out toward the people,\r\nthey bow before him, as if to receive, prostrate, the blessing of a\r\n_great intellect_, not that of a _great heart_! Down, down with the\r\ngreat hearts! Away, away with old prejudices! Hurrah! hurrah! for the\r\nwords of consolation! Hurrah for the license to murder!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis man is the idol of the people, their passion, the ruler of their\r\nsouls, the stimulator of their enthusiasm. He promises them bread and\r\nmoney, and their cries rise like the rushing of a storm, widening and\r\ndeepening in every direction: 'Long live Pancratius! Hurrah! Bread and\r\nmoney! Bread for us, our wives, our children! Hurrah! hurrah!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the feet of the speaker, leaning against the table on which he\r\nstands, rests his friend, companion, and disciple. His eye is dark and\r\noriental, shadowed by long and gloomy lashes, his arms hang down, his\r\nlimbs bend under him, his body is badly formed and distorted, his mouth\r\nis sensual and voluptuous, his expression is sharp and malicious, his\r\nfingers are laden with rings of gold--he joins the tumult, crying with a\r\nrough, hoarse voice: 'Long live Pancratius!' The speaker looks at him\r\ncarelessly for a moment, and says: 'Citizen, Baptized, hand me a\r\nhandkerchief!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeantime the uproar continues; the cries become more and more\r\ntumultuous: 'Bread for us! Bread! bread! Long live Pancratius! Death to\r\nthe nobles! to the merchants! to the rich! Bread! bread! Bread and\r\nblood! Hurrah! hurrah!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A tabernacle. Lamps. An open book lies on a table. Baptized Jews.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. My wretched brethren; my revenge-seeking, beloved\r\nbrethren! let us suck nourishment from the pages of the Talmud, as from\r\nthe breast of our mother; it is the breast of life from which strength\r\nand honey flow for us, bitterness and poison for our enemies.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF BAPTIZED JEWS. Jehovah is our God, and ours alone; therefore\r\nhas He scattered us in every land!\r\n\r\nLike the coiled folds of an enormous serpent, He has wreathed us\r\neverywhere round and through the adorers of the cross; our lithe and\r\nsubtile rings pass round and through our foolish, proud, unclean\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\nLet us thrice spew them forth to destruction! Threefold curses light\r\nupon them!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Rejoice, my brethren! the Cross of our Great Enemy is\r\nalready more than half hewn down; it is rotting to its fall; it is only\r\nstanding on a root of blood: if it once plunge into the abyss it will\r\nnever rise again. Hitherto the nobles have been its sole defence, but\r\nthey are ours! ours!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF BAPTIZED JEWS. Our work, our long, long work of centuries, our\r\nsad, ardent, painful work is almost done!\r\n\r\nDeath to the nobles--let us thrice spew them forth to destruction!\r\nThreefold curses light upon them!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. The might of Israel shall be built upon a liberty without\r\nlaw or order, upon a slaughter without end, upon the _pride_ of the\r\nnobility, the _folly_ of the masses. The nobles are almost destroyed; we\r\nmust drive the few still left into the abyss of death, and scatter over\r\ntheir livid corpses the ruins of the shattered cross in which they\r\ntrusted!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF BAPTIZED JEWS. The cross is now our holy symbol; the water of\r\nbaptism has reunited us with men; the scorning repose upon the love of\r\nthe scorned!\r\n\r\nThe freedom of men is our cry; the welfare of the people our aim; ha!\r\nha! the eons of Christ trust the sons of Caiaphas!\r\n\r\nCenturies ago our fathers tortured our Great Enemy to death; we will\r\nagain torture him to death this very day--but He will never rise more\r\nfrom the grave which we prepare for Him!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Yet a little space, a little time, a few drops of poison,\r\nand the whole world will be our own, my brethren!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF BAPTIZED JEWS. Jehovah is the God of Israel, and of it alone.\r\n\r\nLet us thrice spew forth the nations to destruction! Threefold curses\r\nlight upon them!\r\n\r\n  Knocking is heard at the door.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Take up your work, brethren! And thou, Holy Book, away\r\nfrom sight--no unclean look shall soil thy spotless leaves! Who is\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n  Hides the Talmud.\r\n\r\nVOICE (_without_). A friend. Open in the name of freedom.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Quick to your hammers and looms, my brethren!\r\n\r\n  He opens the door.\r\n\r\n  Enter Leonard.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Well done, citizens. You watch, I see, and whet your swords for\r\nto-morrow.--(_Approaching one of the men:_) What are you making here in\r\nthis corner?\r\n\r\nONE OF THE BAPTIZED. Ropes.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. You are right, citizen, for he who falls not by iron must hang!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Citizen Leonard, is the thing really to come off\r\nto-morrow?\r\n\r\nLEONARD. He who thinks, feels, and acts with the most force among us,\r\nhas sent me to you to appoint an interview. He will himself answer your\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. I go to meet him. Brethren, remain at work. Look well to\r\nthem, citizen Yankel.\r\n\r\n  Exit with Leonard.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF BAPTIZED JEWS. Ye ropes and daggers, ye clubs and bills, the\r\nworks of our hands, ye wilt go forth to destroy them!\r\n\r\nThe people will kill the nobles upon the plains, will hang them in the\r\nforests, and then, having none to defend them, we will kill and hang the\r\npeople! The Despised will arise in their anger, will array themselves in\r\nthe might of Jehovah: His Word is Redemption and Love for His people\r\nIsrael, but scorn and fury for their enemies!\r\n\r\nLet us thrice spew them forth to destruction: threefold curses fall upon\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  A tent. A profusion of flasks, cups, and\r\n  flagons. Pancratius alone.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. The mob howled in applause but a moment ago, shouted in loud\r\nhurrahs at every word I uttered. But is there a single man among them\r\nall who really understands my ideas, or who comprehends the end and aim\r\nof that path upon which we have entered, or where the reforms will\r\nterminate which have been so loudly inaugurated within the last hour?\r\n'Ah! fervidum imitatorum pecus!'\r\n\r\n  Enter Leonard and the Baptized Jew.\r\n\r\nDo you know Count Henry?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. I know him well by sight, great citizen, but I am not\r\npersonally acquainted with him. I remember once when I was approaching\r\nthe Lord's Supper, he cried to me, '_Out of the way!_' and looked down\r\nupon me with the arrogant look peculiar to the nobles--for which I vowed\r\nhim a rope in my soul.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Prepare to visit him early to-morrow morning, and announce\r\nto him that it is my wish to confer with him alone.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. How many men will you send with me on this embassy? I do\r\nnot think it would be safe to undertake it without a guard.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You must go alone, my name will be sufficient guard, and the\r\ngallows on which you hung the baron yesterday, your shield.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Woe is me!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Tell him I will visit him to-morrow night.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. And if he should put me in chains or order me to be hung?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You would die a martyr for the freedom of the people!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. I will sacrifice all for the freedom of the\r\npeople.--(_Aside_.) Woe is me!--(_Aloud._) Good night, citizen.\r\n\r\n  Exit the Baptized.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Pancratius, why this delay, these half measures, these\r\ncontracts, this strange interview? When I swore to honor and obey you,\r\nit was because I believed you to be a hero of extremes, an eagle flying\r\neven in the face of the sun directly to its aim; a brave man ready to\r\nventure all upon the cast of a die.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Silence, child!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Everything is ready; the baptized Jews have forged arms and\r\nwoven ropes; the masses clamor for immediate orders. Speak but the word\r\nnow, and the electric sparks will fly, the millions flash into forked\r\nlightnings, kindle into flame, and consume our enemies!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You are young, and the blood mounts rapidly into your brain;\r\nbut will the hour of combat find you more resolute than myself?\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Think well what you are doing. The nobles, weak and exhausted,\r\nhave fled for refuge to the famous fortress of the Holy Trinity,[1] and\r\nawait our arrival, as men wait the knife of the guillotine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A renowned fort in Polish history. It stood on the old\r\nbattlefield between Turkey and Poland, between Europe and Asia.]\r\n\r\nForward, citizen, attack them without delay, and it is over with them\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. It can make no difference; they have lost the old energy of\r\ntheir caste in luxury and idleness. To-morrow or the next day they must\r\nfall, what matter which?\r\n\r\nLEONARD. What and whom do you fear, and why do you delay?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. I fear nothing. I act but in accordance with my own will.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. And am I to trust it blindly?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Yes. Blindly.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. You may betray us, citizen!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Betrayal rings forever from your lips like the refrain of an\r\nold song.\r\n\r\nBut hush! not so loud--if any one should hear us ...\r\n\r\nLEONARD. There are no spies here; and what if some one should hear us?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Nothing; only five balls in your heart for having ventured\r\nto raise your voice a tone too high in my presence. (_Approaching close\r\nto him_.) Leonard, trust me, and be tranquil!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I confess I have been too hasty, but I fear no punishment. If\r\nmy death could help the cause of the down-trodden masses, I would\r\ncheerfully die.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You are full of life, hope, faith. Happiest of men, I will\r\nnot rob you of the bliss of existence.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. What do you say, citizen?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Think more; speak less; the time will come when you will\r\nfully understand me!\r\n\r\nHave you collected the provisions for the carousal of the millions?\r\n\r\nLEONARD. They have all been sent to the arsenal under guard.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Has the contribution from the shoemakers been received?\r\n\r\nLEONARD. It has. Every one gave with the greatest eagerness; it amounts\r\nto a hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. They must all be invited to a general festival to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHave you heard nothing of Count Henry?\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I despise the nobles too deeply to credit what I hear of him.\r\nThe dying race have no energy left; it is impossible they should dare or\r\nventure aught.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. And yet it is true that he is collecting and training his\r\nserfs and peasants, and, confiding in their devotion and attachment to\r\nhimself, intends leading them to the relief of the fortress of the Holy\r\nTrinity.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Who can oppose us? _The ideas of our century stand incorporated\r\nin us!_\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. I am determined to see Count Henry, to gaze into his eyes,\r\nto read the very depths of his brave spirit, to win him over to the\r\nglorious cause of the people.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. An aristocrat, body and soul!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. True: but also a Poet!\r\n\r\nGood night, Leonard, I would be alone.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Have you forgiven me, citizen?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Sleep in peace: if I had not forgiven you, you would ere\r\nthis have slept the eternal sleep.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. And will nothing take place to-morrow?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Good night, and pleasant dreams!\r\n\r\n  Leonard is retiring.\r\n\r\nHo, Leonard!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Citizen general?\r\n\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You will accompany me day after morrow on my visit to Count\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I will obey.\r\n\r\n  Exit Leonard.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. How is it that this man, Count Henry, still dares to resist\r\nand defy _me_, the ruler of millions? His forces will bear no comparison\r\nwith mine; indeed he stands almost alone, although it is true that some\r\nhundred or two of peasants, confiding blindly in his word and clinging\r\nto him as the dog clings to his master, still cluster round him--but\r\nthat is all folly, and can amount to nothing. Why, then, do I long to\r\nsee him, long to win him to our side? Has my spirit for the first time\r\nencountered its equal? Can it progress no farther in the path in which\r\nhe stands to oppose me? His resistance is the last obstacle to be\r\novercome--he must be overthrown--and then? ... and then! ...\r\n\r\nO my cunning intellect! Canst thou not deceive _thyself_ as thou hast\r\ndeceived others?...\r\n\r\nShame! thou shouldst know thine own might! Thou art _thought_, the\r\nintelligence and reason of the people--the ruler of the masses--thou\r\ncontrollest the millions, so that their will and giant force is _one_\r\nwith _thine_--all authority and government are incarnated and\r\nconcentrated in thee alone--all that would be crime in others is in thee\r\nfame and glory--thou hast given name and place to unknown and obscure\r\nmen--thou hast given faith and eloquence to beings who had been almost\r\nrobbed of moral sentiment--thou hast created a new world in thine own\r\nimage, and _art thyself its god_! and yet ... and yet ... thou art\r\nwandering in unknown wastes, and fearest to be lost thyself--to go\r\nastray!\r\n\r\nThou knowest not thyself, nor of what thou art capable; thou rulest\r\nothers, yet doubt'st thyself--thou knowest not what thou art--whither\r\nthou goest--nor whence thou earnest! No ... no.... Thou art sublime!\r\n\r\n  Sinks upon a chair in silent thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A forest, with a cleared hill in its midst, upon which stands a\r\n     gallows; huts, tents, watchfires, barrels, tables, and crowds of\r\n     men. The Man disguised in a dark cloak and red liberty cap, and\r\n     holding the Baptized Jew by the hand.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Remember!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED (_in a whisper_). Upon my honor, I will lead your\r\nexcellency aright, I will not betray you.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Give but one suspicious wink, raise but a finger, and my bullet\r\nfinds its way to your heart! You may readily imagine that I attach no\r\ngreat value to your life when I thus lightly risk my own.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Oh woe! You press my hand like a vice of steel. What is it\r\nyou wish me to do?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Appear to the crowd as if I were an acquaintance--treat me as a\r\nnewly arrived friend.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a dance is that?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. The dance of a free people.\r\n\r\n     Men and woman dance, leap, and sing round the gallows.\r\n\r\nTHEIR CHORUS. Bread! meat! work! wood in winter, rest in summer! Hurrah!\r\nhurrah!\r\n\r\nGod had no compassion upon us: Hurrah! hurrah!\r\n\r\nKings had no compassion upon us: Hurrah! hurrah!\r\n\r\nThe nobles had no compassion upon us: Hurrah! hurrah!\r\n\r\nWe renounce God, kings, and nobles: Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_to a maiden_). I am glad to see you look so gay, so blooming.\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. I am sure we have waited quite long enough for such a day as\r\nthis! I have washed dishes and cleaned knives and forks all my life,\r\nwithout ever having heard a kind word spoken to me: it is high time I\r\ntoo should begin to eat, to dance, to make merry. Hurrah! hurrah!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Dance, citizeness!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. For God's sake, be cautious, count! You may be recognized;\r\nlet us go!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. If any one should recognize me, you are lost. We will mingle\r\nwith the throng.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. A crowd of servants are sitting under the shade of this\r\noak.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Let us approach them.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. I have just killed my first master.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. And I am on the search for my baron. Your health,\r\ncitizens!\r\n\r\nVALET DE CHAMBRE. In the sweat of our brows, in the depths of\r\nhumiliation, licking the dust from the boots of our masters, and\r\nprostrate before them, we have yet always felt our rights as men: let us\r\ndrink the health of our present society!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF SERVANTS. Here's to the health of our citizen President! one\r\nof ourselves, he will lead us to glory!\r\n\r\nVALET DE CHAMBRE. Thanks, citizens, thanks!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF SERVANTS. Out of dark kitchens, dressing rooms, and\r\nantechambers, our prisons of old, we rush together into freedom: Hurrah!\r\n\r\nWe know the ridiculous follies, peevishness, and perversity of our\r\nmasters; we have been behind the shows and shams of glittering halls:\r\nHurrah!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Whose voices are those I hear so harsh and wild from that\r\nlittle mound on our left?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. The butchers are singing a chorus.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF THE BUTCHERS. The cleaver and axe are our weapons; our life is\r\nin the slaughter house; we know the hue of blood, and care not if we\r\nkill _cattle_ or _nobles_!\r\n\r\nChildren of blood and strength, we look with indifference upon the pale\r\nand weak; he who needs us, has us; we slaughter beeves for the nobles;\r\nthe nobles for the people!\r\n\r\nThe cleaver and axe are our arms; our life is in the slaughter house:\r\nHurrah for the slaughter house! the slaughter house! the slaughter\r\nhouse! the slaughter house!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Come! I like the next group better; honor and philosophy are at\r\nleast named in it. Good evening, madame!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. It would be better if your excellency should say,\r\n'citizeness,' or 'woman of freedom.'\r\n\r\nWOMAN. What do you mean by the title, 'madame?' From whence did it come?\r\nFie! fie! you smell of mould!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Pardon my mistake!\r\n\r\nWOMAN. I am as free as you, I am a free woman; I give my love freely to\r\nthe community, because they have acknowledged my right to lavish it\r\nwhere I will!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. And have the community given you for it these jewelled rings,\r\nthese chains of violet amethysts?... O thrice beneficent community!\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN. No, the community did not give them to me; but at my\r\nemancipation I took these things secretly from the casket of my husband,\r\nfor he was my enemy, the enemy of freedom, and had long held me\r\nenslaved!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Citizeness, I wish you a most agreeable promenade!\r\n\r\n     They pass on.\r\n\r\nWho is this marvellous-looking warrior leaning upon a two-edged sword,\r\nwith a death's head upon his cap, another upon his badge, and a third\r\nupon his breast? Is he not the famous Bianchetti, a condottiere employed\r\nby the people, as the condottieri once were by the kings and nobles?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Yes, it is Bianchetti; he has been with us for the last\r\neight or ten days.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_to Bianchetti_). What is General Bianchetti considering with\r\nso much attention?\r\n\r\nBIANCHETTI. Look through this opening in the woods, citizen, and you\r\nwill see a castle upon a hill: with my glass I can see the walls,\r\nramparts, bastions, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. It will be hard to take, will it not?\r\n\r\nBIANCHETTI. Kings and devils! it can be surrounded by subterranean\r\npassages, undermined, and....\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED (_winking at Bianchetti_). Citizen general....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_in a whisper to the Baptized_). Look under my cloak how the\r\ncock of my pistol is raised!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED (_aside_). Oh woe!--(_Aloud._) How do you mean to conduct\r\nthe siege, citizen general?\r\n\r\nBIANCHETTI. Although you are my brother in freedom, you are not my\r\nconfidant in strategy. After the capitulation of the castle, my plans\r\nwill be made public.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_to the Baptized_). Take my advice, Jew, and strike him dead,\r\nfor such is the beginning of all aristocracies.\r\n\r\nA WEAVER. Curses! curses! curses!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Poor fellow! what are you doing under this tree, and why do you\r\nlook so pale and wild?\r\n\r\nTHE WEAVER. Curses upon the merchants and manufacturers! All the best\r\nyears of my life, years in which other men love maidens, meet in wide\r\nplains, or sail upon vast seas, with free air and open space around\r\nthem, I have spent in a narrow, dark, gloomy room, chained like a galley\r\nslave to a silk loom!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Take some food! Empty the full cup which you hold in your hand!\r\n\r\nWEAVER. I have not strength enough left to carry it to my lips! I am so\r\ntired; I could scarcely crawl up here--it is the day of freedom! but a\r\nday of freedom is not for me--it comes too late, too late!--(_He falls,\r\nand gasps out_:) Curses upon the manufacturers who make silks! upon the\r\nmerchants, who buy them! upon the nobles, who wear them! Curses! curses!\r\ncurses!\r\n\r\n     He writhes on the ground and dies.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. What a ghastly corpse!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Baptized Jew, citizen, poltroon of freedom, look upon this\r\nlifeless head, shining in the blood-red rays of the setting sun! Where\r\nare now your words and promises; the equality, perfectibility, and\r\nuniversal happiness of the human race?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED (_aside_). May you soon fall into a like ruin, and the dogs\r\ntear the flesh from your rotting corpse!--(_Aloud._) I beg that your\r\nexcellency will now permit me to return, that I may give an account of\r\nmy embassy!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You may say that, believing you to be a spy, I forcibly\r\ndetained you.--(_Looking around him._) The tumult and noise of the\r\ncarousal is dying away behind us; before us there is nothing to be seen\r\nbut fir and pine trees bathed in the crimson rays of sunset.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Clouds are gathering thick and fast over the tops of the\r\ntrees: had you not better return to your people, Count Henry, who have\r\nbeen waiting so long for you in the vault of St. Ignatius?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thank you for your exceeding care of me, Sir Jew! But back! I\r\nwill return and take another look at the festival of the citizens.\r\n\r\nVOICES (_under the trees_). The children of Ham bid good night to thee,\r\nold Sun!\r\n\r\nVOICE (_on the right_). Here's to thy health, old enemy! Thou hast long\r\ndriven us on to unpaid work, and awaked us early to unheeded pain! Ha!\r\nha! When thou risest upon us to-morrow, thou wilt find us with fish and\r\nflesh: now off to the devil, empty glass!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. The bands of peasants are coming this way.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You shall not leave me. Place yourself behind this tree trunk,\r\nand be silent!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PEASANTS. Forward, forward, under the white tents to meet our\r\nbrethren! Forward, forward, under the green shade of the beeches, to\r\nrest, to sleep, to pleasant sunset greetings!\r\n\r\nOur maidens there await us; there await us our slaughtered oxen, the\r\nold teams of our ploughs!\r\n\r\nA VOICE. I am pulling and dragging him on with all my strength--now he\r\nturns and defends himself--down! down among the dead!\r\n\r\nVOICE OF THE DYING NOBLE. My children, pity! pity!\r\n\r\nSECOND VOICE. Chain me to your land and make me work without pay\r\nagain--will you!\r\n\r\nTHIRD VOICE. My only son fell under the blows of your lash, old lord;\r\neither wake him from the dead, or die to join him!\r\n\r\nFOURTH VOICE. The children of Ham drink thy health, old lord! they beg\r\nthee for forgiveness, lord!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PEASANTS (_passing on out of sight_). A vampire sucked our\r\nblood, and lived upon our strength:\r\n\r\nWe have caught the vampire, he shall escape no more!\r\n\r\nBy Satan, thou shalt hang as high as a great lord should!\r\n\r\nBy Satan, thou shalt die high, high above us all!\r\n\r\nDeath to the nobles; tyrants were they all!\r\n\r\nDrink, food, and rest for us; poor, weary, hungry, thirsty, naked!\r\n\r\nYour bodies shall lie like sheaves upon our fields; the ruins of your\r\ncastles fly like chaff beneath the flail of the thresher!\r\n\r\nVOICE. The children of Ham will dance merrily round their bonfires!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I cannot see the face of the murdered noble, they throng so\r\nthickly round him.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. It is in all probability a friend or relation of your\r\nexcellency!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I despise him, and hate you!\r\n\r\nPoetry will sweeten all this horror hereafter. Forward, Jew, forward!\r\n\r\n     They disappear among the trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Another part of the forest. A mound upon which watchfires are\r\n     burning. A procession of people bearing torches.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_appearing among them with the Baptized_). These drooping\r\nbranches have torn my liberty cap into tatters.\r\n\r\nHa! what hell of flame is this throwing its crimson light into the\r\ngloom, and leaping through these heavily fringed walls of the forest?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. We have wandered from our way while seeking the pass of\r\nSt. Ignatius. We must retrace our steps immediately, for this is the\r\nspot in which Leonard celebrates the solemnities of the New Faith!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Forward, in the name of God! I must see these solemnities. Fear\r\nnothing, Jew, no one will recognize us.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Be prudent; our lives hang on a breath!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What enormous ruins are these scattered around us! This\r\nponderous pile must have lasted centuries before it fell!\r\n\r\nPillars, pedestals, capitals, fallen arches--ha! I am treading upon the\r\nbroken remnants of an escutcheon. Bas-reliefs of exquisite sculpture are\r\nscattered about upon the earth! Heavens! that is the sweet face of the\r\nVirgin Mother shining through the heart of the darkness! The light\r\nflickers, I can see it no more. Here are the slight-fluted shafts of a\r\nshrine, panes of colored glass with cherub heads, a carved railing of\r\nbronze, and now, in the light of yonder torch, I see the half of a\r\nmonumental figure of a reclining knight in armor thrown upon the burnt\r\nand withered grass: Where am I, Jew?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. You are passing through the graveyard of the last church\r\nof the Old Faith; our people labored forty days and forty nights without\r\nintermission to destroy it; it seemed built for eternal ages.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Your songs and hymns, ye new men, grate harshly on my ears!\r\n\r\nDark forms are moving forward in every direction, from before us, behind\r\nus, and from either side; lights and shadows, driven to and fro by the\r\nwind, float like living spirits through the throng.\r\n\r\nA PASSER-BY. I greet you, citizens, in the name of freedom!\r\n\r\nSECOND PASSER-BY. I greet you in the name of the slaughter of the\r\nnobles!\r\n\r\nTHIRD PASSER-BY. The priests chant the praise of freedom; why do you not\r\nhasten forward?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. We cannot resist the pressure of the throng; they drive us\r\non from every side.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Who is this young man standing in front of us, mounted upon the\r\nruins of the shrine? Three flames burn beneath him, his face shines from\r\nthe midst of fire and smoke, his voice rings like the shriek of a\r\nmaniac; and his gestures are rapid and eager?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. That is Leonard, the inspired and enthusiastic prophet of\r\nfreedom. Our priests, our philosophers, our poets, our artists, with\r\ntheir daughters and loved ones, are standing round him.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Ha, I understand; your aristocracy! Point out to me the man who\r\nsent you to seek an interview with me.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. He is not here.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Fly to my arms; cling to my lips; come to me, my beautiful\r\nbride! Independent, free, stripped of the veils of hypocrisy, full of\r\nlove, untrammelled from the chilling fetters of prejudice, come to me,\r\nthou chosen one of the lovely daughters of freedom!\r\n\r\nVOICE OF A MAIDEN. I fly to thee, beloved one!\r\n\r\nSECOND MAIDEN. Look upon me! I stretch forth my arms to thee, but have\r\nsunk fainting among the ruins; I cannot rise, and have only strength\r\nleft to turn to thee, beloved!\r\n\r\nTHIRD MAIDEN. I have outstripped them all; through cinders and ashes,\r\nflame and smoke, I fly to thee, beloved!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. With long, dishevelled hair far floating on the wind, with\r\nsnowy bosom panting with wild excitement, she clambers up the smoking\r\nruins to his arms!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Thus is it every night.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. To me! to me! my bliss, my rapture! Lovely daughter of freedom,\r\nthou tremblest with delicious, god-like madness!\r\n\r\nInspiration, flood my soul! Listen to me, all ye people, for now will I\r\nprophesy unto you!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Her head sinks on his bosom; she faints in his arms.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Look upon us, ye people! we offer you an image of the human\r\nrace, freed from trammels, and risen into new life from the death of\r\nforms. We stand upon the ruins of old dogmas, of old gods; yea, glory\r\nunto us, for we have torn the old gods limb from limb!\r\n\r\nThey have rotted into dust; our spirits have conquered theirs; their\r\nvery souls have fallen into the abyss of nothingness!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Happy among women is the bride of the prophet: we stand\r\nbelow and envy her glory!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I announce to you a new world; to a new god I have given the\r\nheavens; to the god of freedom and of bliss, the god of the people;\r\nevery offering of their vengeance, the piled corpses of their\r\noppressors, be his fitting altar! The old tears and agonies of humanity\r\nwill be forever swept away in an ocean of blood!\r\n\r\nWe now inaugurate the perpetual happiness of men; freedom and equality\r\nbelong of right to all!\r\n\r\nDamnation and the gallows to him who would reorganize the Past; to him\r\nwho would conspire against the common fraternity!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF MEN. The towers of superstition, of tyranny, of pride, have\r\nfallen, have fallen! To him who would save one stone from the old\r\nbuildings--damnation and death!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED (_aside_). Ye blasphemers of Jehovah, I thrice spew you\r\nforth to destruction!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Keep but thy promise, Eagle, and I will build on this very spot\r\nand upon their bowed necks a new temple to the Son of God, the Merciful!\r\n\r\nA CONFUSED CRY FROM MINGLING VOICES. Freedom! Equality! Bliss! Hurrah!\r\nhurrah!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF THE NEW PRIESTS. Where are the lords, where are the kings, who\r\nlately walked the earth with crown and sceptre, ruled with pride and\r\nscorn?\r\n\r\nFIRST MURDERER. I killed King Alexander.\r\n\r\nSECOND MURDERER. I stabbed King Henry.\r\n\r\nTHIRD MURDERER. I murdered King Immanuel!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Go on without fear; murder without a sting of conscience!\r\n\r\nRemember that you are the Elect of the Elect; the Holy among the Holy;\r\nthe brave heroes and blessed martyrs of equality and freedom!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF MURDERERS. We go in the darkness of night; we move in the\r\ngloom of the shadow! With the dagger firmly clutched in our unsparing\r\nhands, we go, we go!\r\n\r\nLEONARD (_to the Maiden_). Arouse thee, my beautiful and free!\r\n\r\n     A loud clap of thunder is heard.\r\n\r\nReply to the living god of thunder: raise high the hymn of strength!\r\nFollow me all, all! Let us once more trample under our feet the ruined\r\ntemple of the dead God!\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN. I glow with love to thee and to thy god! I will share my\r\nlove with the whole world: I glow! I glow!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Some one blocks the way; he falls upon his knees, raises his\r\njoined hands, struggles, sighs, sobs....\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. He is the son of a famous philosopher.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. What do you demand, Herman?\r\n\r\nHERMAN. High priest, give me the Sacrament of Murder!\r\n\r\nLEONARD (_to the Priests_). Give me the oil, the dagger, and the\r\npoison!--(To Herman.) With the sacred oil once used to anoint kings, I\r\nnow anoint thee to their destruction!\r\n\r\nThe arm once used by knights and nobles, I give thee now for their\r\ndestruction!\r\n\r\nI hang upon thy breast this flask of poison, that where the sword cannot\r\nreach, it may gnaw, corrode, and burn the bowels of the tyrants!\r\n\r\nGo, and destroy the old race in all parts of the world!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. He is gone! I see him, at the head of a band of assassins,\r\ncrossing the crest of the nearest hill.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. They turn, they approach us, we must move out of their\r\nway!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. No. I will dream this dream to its end!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED (_aside_). I thrice spew thee forth to destruction!--(_To\r\nthe Man_). Leonard might recognize me, your excellency. Do you not see\r\nthe knife glittering upon his breast?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Wrap yourself up in my cloak. What ladies are those dancing\r\nbefore him you call Leonard?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Princesses and countesses who have forsaken their\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Once my angels!!\r\n\r\nThe people now surround him on every side, I can see him no longer, I\r\nonly know by the retreating music that he is going farther from us.\r\nFollow me, Jew, we can see him better up here!\r\n\r\n     He clambers up the parapet of a wall.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Woe! woe! We will certainly be discovered.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. There, now I can see him again! Ha! other women are with him\r\nnow, pale, confused, trembling, following him convulsively; the son of\r\nthe philosopher foams and brandishes his dagger; they are stopping by\r\nthe ruins of the North Tower.\r\n\r\nThey remain standing for a moment, they climb upon the ruins, they tear\r\nthem down, they pull the shrine apart, they throw coals upon the\r\nprostrate altars, the votive wreaths, the holy pictures; the fire\r\nkindles, columns of smoke darken all before me: Woe to the destroyers!\r\nWoe!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Woe to the men who still bow down before the dead God!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Dark masses of the people turn and drive upon us.\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. O Father Abraham!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Old Eagle of glory, is it not true that my hour is not yet\r\ncome?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. We are lost!\r\n\r\nLEONARD (_stopping immediately in front of Count Henry_). Who are you\r\nwith that haughty face, citizen, and why do you not join in the\r\nsolemnities?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I hastened here when I heard of the revolution; I am a murderer\r\nof the Spanish league, and have only arrived to-day.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Who is that man hiding himself in the folds of your mantle?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. He is my younger brother. He has taken an oath to show his face\r\nto no one, until he has at least killed a baron.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Of whose murder can you yourself boast?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. My elder brothers consecrated me only two days before my\r\ndeparture, and....\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Whom do you think of killing?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You in the first place, if you should prove false to us!\r\n\r\n\r\nLEONARD. For this use, brother, take my dagger!\r\n\r\n     Hands it to him.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. For such use my own will suffice me, brother!\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. Long live Leonard! Long live the Spanish murderer!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Meet me to-morrow in the tent of Pancratius, our citizen\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PRIESTS. We greet thee, stranger, in the name of the Spirit of\r\nLiberty: we intrust to thy hand a share of our emancipation!\r\n\r\nTo men who combat without cessation, who kill without pity or weakness,\r\nwho work for freedom by day, and dream of it by night, will be at last\r\nthe victory!\r\n\r\n     They pass on out of sight.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PHILOSOPHERS. We have wakened the human race, and torn them\r\naway from the days of childhood! We have found truth, and brought it to\r\nlight from the womb of darkness! Combat, murder, and die for it,\r\nbrethren!\r\n\r\nTHE SON OF THE PHILOSOPHER (_to the Man_). Brother and friend, I drink\r\nyour health out of the skull of an old saint! May we soon meet again!\r\n\r\nA MAIDEN (_dancing_). Kill Prince John for me!\r\n\r\nSECOND MAIDEN. Count Henry for me!\r\n\r\nCHILDREN. Bring us back the head of a noble for a ball.\r\n\r\nOTHER VOICES. Good fortune guide your daggers home!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF ARTISTS. On these sublime old ruins we build no temples more;\r\nwe paint no pictures, mould no statues for forgotten shrines; our arches\r\nshall be formed of pointed pikes and naked blades; our pillars built of\r\nghastly piles of human skulls; the capitals of human hair dyed in\r\ngushing streams of crimson blood; our altar shall be white as snow, our\r\ngod will rest upon it, the cap of liberty: Hurrah! hurrah!\r\n\r\nOTHER VOICES. On! on! the morning dawn already breaks!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. They will soon catch and hang us; we are but one step from\r\nthe gallows.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Fear nothing, Jew, they follow Leonard, and observe us no\r\nlonger. I see with my own eyes, I understand with my own mind, and for\r\nthe last time before it engulfs me, the chaos now generating in the\r\nabyss of Time, in the womb of Darkness, for my own destruction, for the\r\nannihilation of my brethren!\r\n\r\nDriven on by madness, stung by despair, my thoughts awake in all their\r\nstrength....\r\n\r\nO God! give me again the power which Thou didst not of old deny me, and\r\nI will condense this new and fearful world, which does not understand\r\nitself, into _one_ burning word, but which one word will be the Poetry\r\nof the entire Past!\r\n\r\nVOICE IN THE AIR. Poet, thou chant'st a drama!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thanks for thy good counsel!\r\n\r\nRevenge for the desecrated ashes of my fathers--malediction upon the new\r\nraces! their whirlpool is around me, but it shall not draw me into the\r\ngiddying and increasing circles of its abyss! Keep but thy promise,\r\nEagle; Eagle of glory!\r\n\r\nJew, I am ready now for the vault of St. Ignatius!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. The day dawns; I can go no farther.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Lead me on until we strike the right path; I will then release\r\nyou!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Why do you drag me on through mist, through thorns and\r\nbriers, through ashes and embers, over heaps of ruins? Let me go, I\r\nentreat!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Forward! forward! and descend with me!\r\n\r\nThe last songs of the people are dying away behind us; a few torches\r\nhere and there just glimmer through the gloom!\r\n\r\nHa! under those hoary trees drooping with the night dew, and through\r\nthis curdling, whitening vapor, see you not the giant shadow of the dead\r\nPast? Hark! hear you not that wailing chant?\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Everything is shrouded in the thickening mist; at every\r\nstep we descend, deeper, deeper!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOOD SPIRITS. Let us weep for Christ, the persecuted, martyred\r\nJesus!\r\n\r\nWhere is our God; where is His church?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Unsheathe the sword--to arms! to arms!\r\n\r\nI will restore Him to you; upon thousands and thousands of crosses will\r\nI crucify His enemies!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF SPIRITS. We kept guard by day and night around the altar and\r\nthe holy graves; upon untiring wings we bore the matin chime and vesper\r\nbell to the ear of the believer; our voices floated on the organ's peal!\r\nIn the glitter of the stained and rainbow panes, the shadows of the\r\nvaulted domes, the light of the holy chalice, the blessed consecration\r\nof the Body of our Lord--was our whole life centred!\r\n\r\nWoe! woe! what will become of us?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. It is growing lighter; their dim forms fade and melt into the\r\nred of morn!\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. Here lies your way: this is the entrance to the Pass.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Hail! Christ Jesus and my sword! (_He tears off the liberty\r\ncap, throws it upon the ground, and casts pieces of silver upon it.)_\r\nTake together the Thing and the Image for a remembrance!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTIZED. You pledge your word to me for the honorable treatment of\r\nhim who will visit you at midnight?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. An old noble never repeats or breaks a promise!\r\n\r\nHail! Christ Jesus and our swords!\r\n\r\nVOICES (_from the depths of the Pass_). Mary and our swords! Long live\r\nour lord, Count Henry!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. My faithful followers, to me--to me!\r\n\r\nAid me, Mary, and Christ Jesus!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Night. Trees and shrubbery. Pancratius, Leonard, and attendants.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS (_to his attendants_). Lie upon this spot with your faces to\r\nthe turf, remain perfectly still, kindle no fires, beat no signals, and,\r\nunless you hear the report of firearms, stir not until the dawn of day!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I once more conjure you, citizen!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Lean against this tall pine, Leonard, and pass the night in\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I pray you, Pancratius, take me with you! Remember, you are\r\nabout to intrust yourself alone with an aristocrat, a betrayer, an\r\noppressor....\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS (_interrupting him, and impatiently gesturing to him to\r\nremain behind_). The old nobles seldom broke a plighted promise!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A vast feudal hall in the castle of Count Henry. Pictures of\r\n     knights and ladies hang upon the walls. A pillar is seen in the\r\n     background bearing the arms and escutcheons of the family. The\r\n     Count is seated at a marble table upon which are placed an antique\r\n     lamp of wrought silver, a jewel-hilted sword, a pair of pistols, an\r\n     hourglass, and clock. Another table stands on the opposite side,\r\n     with silver pitchers, decanters, and massive goblets.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. At the same hour, surrounded by appalling perils, agitated by\r\nforeboding thoughts, the last Brutus met his Evil Genius.\r\n\r\nI await a like apparition. A man without a name, without ancestors,\r\nwithout a faith or guardian angel; a man who is destroying the Past, and\r\nwho will, in all probability, establish a new era, though himself sprung\r\nfrom the very dust, if I cannot succeed in casting him back into his\r\noriginal nothingness--is now to appear before me!\r\n\r\nSpirit of my forefathers! inspire me with that haughty energy which once\r\nrendered you the rulers of the world! Give me the lion heart which erst\r\nthrobbed in your dauntless breasts! Give me your peerless dignity, your\r\nnoble and chivalric courtesy!\r\n\r\nRekindle in my wavering soul your blind, undoubting, earnest faith in\r\nChrist and in His church: at once the source of your noblest deeds on\r\nearth, your brightest hopes in heaven! Oh, let it open for me, as it was\r\nwont to do for you; and I will struggle with fire and sword against its\r\nenemies! Hear me, the son of countless generations, the sole heir of\r\nyour thoughts, your courage, your virtues, and your faults!\r\n\r\n     The castle bell sounds twelve.\r\n\r\nIt is the appointed hour: I am prepared!\r\n\r\n     An old and faithful servant, Jacob, enters, fully armed.\r\n\r\nJACOB. My lord, the person whom your excellency expects is in the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Admit him here.\r\n\r\n     Exit Jacob.\r\n\r\n     He reappears, announcing Pancratius, and again retires.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Count Henry, I salute you! The word 'count' sounds strangely\r\non my lips.\r\n\r\n     He seats himself, throws off his cloak and liberty cap, and fastens\r\n     his eyes on the pillar on which hang the arms and shield.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thanks, guest, that you have confided in the honor of my house!\r\nFaithful to our ancient forms, I pledge you in a glass of wine. Your\r\ngood health, guest!\r\n\r\n     He takes a goblet, fills, tastes, and hands it to Pancratius.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. If I am not mistaken, this red and blue shield was called a\r\ncoat of arms in the language of the Dead; but such trifles have vanished\r\nfrom the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n     He drinks.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Vanished? With the aid of God, you will soon look upon them by\r\nthousands!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Commend me to the old noble! always confident in himself,\r\nthough without money, arms, or soldiers; proud, obstinate, and hoping\r\nagainst all hope; like the corpse in the fable, threatening the driver\r\nof the hearse at the very door of the charnel house, and confiding in\r\nGod, or at least pretending to confide in Him, when confidence in\r\nhimself is no longer even possible!\r\n\r\nPray, Count Henry, give me but one little glimpse of the lightning which\r\nis to be sent from heaven, for your especial benefit, to blast me and my\r\nmillions; or show me at least one angel of the thousands of the heavenly\r\nhosts, who are to encamp on your side, and whose prowess is so speedily\r\nto decide the combat in your favor!\r\n\r\n     He empties the goblet.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You are pleased to jest, leader of the people; but atheism is\r\nquite an old formula, and I looked for something _new_ from the _new\r\nmen_!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Laugh, if you will, at your own wit, but my faith is wider,\r\ndeeper, and more firmly based than your own. Its central dogma is the\r\nemancipation of humanity. It has its source in the cries of despair\r\nwhich rise unceasingly to heaven from the hearts of tortured millions,\r\nin the famine of the operatives, the grinding poverty of the peasants,\r\nthe desecration of their wives and daughters, the degradation of the\r\nrace through unjust laws and debasing and brutal prejudices--from all\r\nthis agony spring my new formulas, the creed which I am determined to\r\nestablish: _'Man has a birthright of happiness_.' These thoughts are my\r\ngod, a god which will give bread, rest, bliss, glory to man!\r\n\r\n     He fills, drinks, and casts and goblet from him.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I place my trust in that God who gave power and rule, into the\r\nhands of my forefathers!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You trust Him still, and yet through your whole life you\r\nhave been but a plaything in the hands of the Devil!\r\n\r\nBut let us leave such discussions to the theologians, if any such still\r\nlinger upon earth:--to business, Count Henry, to stern facts!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What do you seek from me, redeemer of the people, citizen-god?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. I sought you, in the first place, because I wished to know\r\nyou; in the second, because I desire to save you.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. For the first, receive my thanks; for the second, trust my\r\nsword!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Your God! your sword! vain phantoms of the brain! Look at\r\nthe dread realities of your situation! The curses of the millions are\r\nupon you; myriads of brawny arms are already raised to hurl you to\r\ndestruction! Of all the vaunted Past nothing remains to you save a few\r\nfeet of earth, scarcely enough to offer you a grave. Even your last\r\nfortress, the castle of the Holy Trinity, can hold out but a few days\r\nlonger. Where is your artillery? Where are the arms and provisions for\r\nyour soldiers? Where are your soldiers? and what dependence can you\r\nplace on the few you still retain? You must surely know there is\r\nnothing left you on which to hang a single hope!\r\n\r\nIf I were in your place, Count Henry, I know what I would do!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Speak! you see how patiently I listen!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Were I Count Henry, I would say to Pancratius: 'I will\r\ndismiss my troops, my few retainers; I will not go to the relief of the\r\nHoly Trinity--and for this I will retain my title and my estates; and\r\nyou, Pancratius, will pledge your own honor to guarantee me the\r\npossession of the things I require.'\r\n\r\nHow old are you, Count Henry?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I am thirty-six years old, citizen.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Then you have but about fifteen years of life to expect, for\r\nmen of your temperament die young; your son is nearer to the grave than\r\nto maturity. A single exception, such as yours, can do no harm to the\r\ngreat whole. Remain, then, where you are, the last of the counts. Rule,\r\nas long as you shall live, in the house of your fathers; have your\r\nfamily portraits retouched, your armorial bearings renewed, and think no\r\nmore of the wretched remnant of your fallen order. Let the justice of\r\nthe long-injured people be fulfilled upon them! (_He fills for himself\r\nanother cup._) Your good health, Henry, the last of the counts!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Every word you utter is a new insult to me! Do you really\r\nbelieve that, to save a dishonored life, I would suffer myself to be\r\nenslaved and dragged about, chained to your car of triumph?\r\n\r\nCease! cease! I can endure no longer! I cannot answer as my spirit\r\ndictates, for you are my guest, sheltered from all insult while under my\r\nroof by my plighted honor!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Plighted honor and knightly faith have, ere this, swung from\r\na gallows! You unfurl a tattered banner whose faded rags seem strangely\r\nout of place among the brilliant flags and joyous symbols of universal\r\nhumanitarian progress. Oh, I know you, and protest against your course!\r\nFull of life and generous vigor, you bind to your heart a putrefying\r\ncorpse! You court your own destruction, clinging to a vain belief in\r\nprivileged orders, in worn-out relics, in the bones of dead men, in\r\nmouldering escutcheons and forgotten coats of arms--and yet in your\r\ninmost heart you are forced to acknowledge that your brother nobles have\r\ndeserved their punishment, that forgetfulness were mercy for them!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You, Pancratius, and your followers, what do you deserve?\r\n\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Victory and life! I acknowledge but one right, I bow to but\r\none law, the law of perpetual progress, and this law is your death\r\nwarrant. It cries to you through my lips: 'Worm-eaten, mouldering\r\naristocracy! full of rottenness, crammed with meat and wine, satiated\r\nwith luxury--give place to the young, the strong, the hungry!'\r\n\r\nBut I will save you, and you alone!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Cease! I will not brook your arrogant pity!\r\n\r\nI know you, and your new world; I have visited your camp at night, and\r\nlooked upon the restless swarms upon whose necks you ride to power! I\r\nsaw all: I detected the _old_ crimes peering through the thin veils of\r\n_new_ draperies, shining under new shams, whirling to new tunes,\r\ncircling in new dances--but the end was ever the same which it has been\r\nfor centuries, which it will forever be: adultery, license, theft, gold,\r\nblood!\r\n\r\nBut I saw you not there; you were not with your guilty children; you\r\nknow you despise them in the depths of your soul; and if you do not go\r\nmad yourself in the mad dances of the blood-thirsty and blood-drunken\r\npeople, you will soon scorn and despise yourself!\r\n\r\nTorture me no more!\r\n\r\n     He rises, moves hurriedly to and fro, then seats himself under his\r\n     escutcheon.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. It is true my world is in its infancy, unformed and\r\nundeveloped; it requires food, ease, material gratifications; but\r\nit is growing, and the time will come--(_He rises from his chair,\r\napproaches the count, and leans against the pillar supporting the\r\nescutcheons_)--the time will come when my world will arrive at maturity,\r\nwill attain the consciousness of its own strength, when it will say, I\r\nAM; and there will be no other voice on earth able to reply, 'I ALSO\r\nAM!'\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. And then?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. A race will spring from the generation I am now quickening\r\nand elevating, stronger, higher, and nobler than any the world has yet\r\nproduced; the earth has never yet seen such men upon her bosom. They\r\nwill be free, lords of the globe from pole to pole; the earth will be a\r\nblooming garden, every part of her surface under the highest culture;\r\nthe sea will be covered with floating palaces and argosies of wealth and\r\ncommerce; a universal exchange of commodities will carry civilization,\r\nmutual recognition, and comfort to every clime; prosperous cities will\r\ncrown every height, and expand their blessings of refinement and culture\r\no'er every plain; earth will then offer happy and tranquil homes to all\r\nher children, she will be one vast and united house of blissful industry\r\nand highest art!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Your words and voice dissemble well, but your pale and rigid\r\nfeatures in vain struggle to assume the generous glow of a noble\r\nenthusiasm, which your soul cannot feel.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Interrupt me not! Men have begged on bended knees before me\r\nfor such prophecies.\r\n\r\nThe world of the Future will possess a god whose highest fact will not\r\nbe his own defeat and death upon a cross; a god whom the people, by\r\ntheir own power and skill, _will force_ to unveil his face to them; a\r\ngod who will be torn by the very children whom he once scattered over\r\nthe face of the earth in his anger, from the infinite recesses of the\r\ndistant heavens in which he loves to hide! Babel will be no more, all\r\ntribes and nations will meet and understand their mutual wants, and,\r\nunited by a _universal language_, his scattered children, having\r\nattained their majority, assert their _right_ to know their creator, and\r\nclaim their just inheritance from a common father: '_the full possession\r\nof all truth_!'\r\n\r\nThe god of humanity at last reveals himself to man!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Yes, He revealed Himself some centuries ago; through Him is\r\nhumanity already redeemed.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Alas! let the redeemed delight in the sweetness of such\r\nredemption! let them rejoice in the multiplied agonies which have in\r\nvain cried to a Redeemer for relief during the three thousand years\r\nwhich have elapsed since His defeat and death!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Blasphemer, cease! I have seen the Cross, the holy symbol of\r\nHis mystic love, standing in the heart of the eternal city, Rome; the\r\nruins of a power far greater than thine were crumbling into dust around\r\nIt; hundreds of gods such as those you trust in, were lying prostrate on\r\nthe ground, trampled under careless feet, not even daring to raise their\r\ncrushed and wounded heads to gaze upon the Crucified. It stood upon the\r\nseven hills, stretching its mighty arms to the east and to the west, its\r\nholy brow glittering in the golden sunshine; men wistfully gazed upon\r\nits perfect lesson of self-abnegating Love; it won all hearts, it RULED\r\nTHE WORLD!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. An old wife's tale, hollow as the rattling of these vain\r\nescutcheons! (_He strikes the shield._) These discussions are in vain,\r\nfor I have read all the secrets of your yearning heart! If you really\r\nwish to find the _infinite_ which has so long baffled your search; if\r\nyou love the _truth_, and are willing to suffer for it; if you are a\r\n_man_, created in the image of our common humanity, and not the\r\nimpossible hero of an old nursery song--listen to me! Oh, let not these\r\nrapidly fleeting moments, the last in which you can possibly be saved,\r\npass in vain! The race renews itself, man of the Past; and _of the blood\r\nwe shed to-day, no trace will be found to-morrow_! For the last time I\r\nconjure you, if you are what you once appeared to be, A MAN, rise in\r\nyour former might, aid the down-trodden and oppressed people, help to\r\nemancipate and enlighten your fellow men, work for the common good,\r\nforsake your false ideas of a personal glory, quit these tottering ruins\r\nwhich all your pride and power cannot prevent from crumbling o'er you,\r\ndesert your falling house, and follow me!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. O youngest born of Satan's brood!--(_He paces up and down the\r\nhall, speaking to himself_:) Dreams, dreams, beautiful dreams--but their\r\nrealization is impossible! Who could achieve them? Adam died in the\r\ndesert--the flaming sword still guards the gates--we are never more to\r\nenter Paradise! In vain we dream!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS (_aside_). I have driven the probe to the core of his heart;\r\nI have struck the electric nerve of Poetry, which quivers through the\r\nvery base of his complicated being!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Progress of humanity; universal happiness; I once believed them\r\npossible! There--there--take my head--my life--if that were possi--....\r\n(_He sighs, and is silent for a moment._) It is past! two centuries ago\r\nit might have been--but now.... But now I have seen and know there will\r\nbe nothing but assassination and murder--murder on either side--nothing\r\ncan satisfy now but an unceasing war of mutual extermination!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Woe then to the vanquished! Falter not, seeker of universal\r\nhappiness! Cry but once with us: '_Woe to the oppressors of the\r\npeople_!' and stand preeminent o'er all, the First among the Victors!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Have you already explored all the paths in the dark and unknown\r\ncountry of the Future? Did Destiny, withdrawing at midnight the curtains\r\nof your tent, stand visibly before you, and, placing her giant hand upon\r\nyour scheming brain, impress upon it the mystic seal of victory? or in\r\nthe heat of midday, when the world slept, and you alone were watching,\r\ndid she glide pale, pitiless, and stern before you, and promise\r\nconquest, that you thus threaten me with defeat and ruin? You are but a\r\nman of clay as fragile as my own, and may be the victim of the first\r\nwell-aimed ball, the first sharp thrust of the sword! Your life, like\r\nmine, hangs on a single thread, and you have no immunity from death!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Dreams! idle dreams! Oh do not deceive yourself with hopes\r\nso vain, for no bullet aimed by man will reach me, no sword will pierce\r\nme, while a single member of your haughty caste remains capable of\r\nresisting the task which it is my destiny to fulfil. And what doom\r\nsoever may befall me, after its completion, count, will be too late to\r\noffer you the least advantage. (_The clock strikes._) Hark! time\r\nflies--and scorns us both!\r\n\r\nIf you are weary of your own life, save at least your unfortunate son!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. His pure soul is already saved in heaven: on earth he must\r\nshare the fate of his father.\r\n\r\n     His head sinks heavily, and remains for some time buried in his\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You reject too all hope for him?... (_Pauses._) Nay--you are\r\nsilent--you reflect--it is well: reflection becomes him who stands upon\r\nthe brink of the grave!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Away! away! Back from the passionate mysteries now surging\r\nthrough the depths of my soul! Profane them not with a word; they lie\r\nbeyond your sphere!\r\n\r\nThe rough, wide world belongs to you; feed it with meat; flood it with\r\nwine; but press not into the holy secrets of my heart! Away! away from\r\nme, framer of material bliss!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Shame upon you, warrior, scholar, poet, and yet the slave of\r\none idea and its dying forms! Thought and form are wax beneath my\r\nplastic fingers!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. In vain would you seek to follow my thoughts; you will never\r\nunderstand me, for all your forefathers were buried in a common ditch,\r\nas dead things, not as men of individual character and bold distinctive\r\nspirit. (_He points to the portraits of his ancestors._) Look upon these\r\npictures! Love of country, of family, of the home hearth, feelings at\r\nwar with all your ideas, are written in every line of their firm\r\nbrows--their spirit lives entire in me, their last heir and\r\nrepresentative. Tell me, O man without ancestors, where is your natal\r\nsoil? You spread your wandering tent each coming eve Upon the ruins of\r\nanother's home, every morning roll it up again that it may be unrolled\r\nanew at night to blight and spoil! Yon have not yet found a _home_, a\r\n_hearth_, and you will never find one as long as a hundred men live to\r\ncry with me: '_Glory to our fathers_!'\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Yes, glory to your fathers in heaven and upon earth; but it\r\nwill repay us to look at them a little more closely. (_He points to one\r\nof the portraits._) This gentleman was a famous Starost; he shot old\r\nwomen in the woods, and roasted the Jews alive: this one with the\r\ninscription, 'Chancellor,' and the great seal in his right hand,\r\nfalsified and forged acts, burned archives, stabbed knights, and sullied\r\nthe inheritance with poison; through him came your villages, your\r\nincome, your power. That dark man played at adultery with the wife of\r\nhis friend. This one, with the golden fleece on his Spanish cloak,\r\nserved in a foreign land, when his own country was in danger.\r\n\r\nThis pale lady with the raven ringlets carried on an intrigue with a\r\nhandsome page. That one with the lustrous braids is reading a letter\r\nfrom her gallant; she smiles, as well she may, for night approaches, and\r\nlove is bold.\r\n\r\nThis timid beauty with the deep blue eyes and golden curls, clasping a\r\nRoman hound in her braceleted arm, was the mistress of a king, and\r\nsoothed his softer hours.\r\n\r\nSuch is the true history of your unbroken, ancient, and unsullied line!\r\nBut I like this jolly fellow in the green riding jacket; he drank and\r\nhunted with the nobles, and employed the peasants to run down the tall\r\ndeer with the hounds. Indeed, the ignorance, stupidity, and wretchedness\r\nof the serf were the strength of the noble, and give convincing proof of\r\nhis own intellect.\r\n\r\nBut the Day of Judgment is approaching: I promise you that none of your\r\nvaunted ancestors, that nought of their fame shall be forgotten in the\r\ndark award.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You deceive yourself, son of the people! Neither you nor your\r\nbrethren could have preserved existence, had not our noble ancestors\r\nnourished you with their bread, and defended you with their blood. In\r\ntimes of famine, they gave you grain, and when the plague swept over you\r\nwith its hot breath of death, they built hospitals to receive you, found\r\nnurses to take care of you, and educated physicians to save you from the\r\ngrave. When from a herd of unformed brutes they had nurtured you into\r\nhuman beings, they built schools and churches for you, sharing\r\neverything with you save the dangers of the battle field, for war they\r\nknew you were not formed to bear. As the sharp lance of the pagan was\r\nwont to recoil, shattered and riven, from the glittering armor of my\r\nfathers, so recoil your vain words as they strike the dazzling record\r\nof their long-consecrated glory. They disturb not the repose of their\r\nsacred ashes. Like the howlings of a mad dog, who froths, bites, and\r\nsnaps as he runs, until he is driven out of the pale of humanity, so\r\nfall your accusations, dying out in their own insanity.\r\n\r\nBut it is almost dawn, and time you should depart from the halls of my\r\nancestors! Pass in safety and in freedom from their home, my guest!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Farewell then, until we meet again upon the ramparts of the\r\nHoly Trinity. And when your powder and ball shall be utterly exhausted?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. _We will then approach within the length of our swords._\r\nFarewell!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. We are twin Eagles, but your nest is shattered by the\r\nlightning! (_He takes up his cloak and liberty cap._) In passing from\r\nyour threshold, I leave the curse, due to decrepitude, behind me. I\r\ndevote you and your son to destruction!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Ho! Jacob!\r\n\r\n     Enter Jacob.\r\n\r\nConduct this man in safety through my last post on the hill!\r\n\r\nJACOB. So help me God the Lord!\r\n\r\n     Exit Jacob with Pancratius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH IN LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some dull hour of doubt or pain,\r\n  Who has not felt that life is slain--\r\n  And while there yet remain\r\n\r\n  Long years, perhaps, of joyless mirth,\r\n  Ere earth shall claim its kindred earth,\r\n  Such years were nothing worth\r\n\r\n  But that some duty still demands\r\n  The sweating brow, the weary hands?\r\n  And so Existence stands\r\n\r\n  With an appeal we cannot shun,\r\n  To make complete what Life begun,\r\n  With toil from sun to sun.\r\n\r\n  And so we keep the sorry tryst,\r\n  With all its fancied sweetness missed--\r\n  Consenting to exist\r\n\r\n  When Life has fled beyond recall,\r\n  And left us to its heir in thrall,\r\n  With chains that will not fall.\r\n\r\n  Belated stars were waning fast\r\n  As through an open gate I passed,\r\n  And crossed a meadow vast--\r\n\r\n  And, still descending, followed still\r\n  The path that wound adown the hill\r\n  And by the ruined mill--\r\n\r\n  Till in its garden I espied\r\n  The cottage by the river side\r\n  Where dwelt my promised bride.\r\n\r\n  Beneath the porch no lantern flared,\r\n  No watch dog kept his faithful ward,\r\n  The window blinds were barred.\r\n\r\n  Entering with eager eye and ear,\r\n  And ushered by the phantom Fear,\r\n  I stood beside the bier\r\n\r\n  Of one who, passing hence away,\r\n  Left something more than lifeless clay,\r\n  As twilight lingers after day,\r\n\r\n  The pulseless heart, the pallid lips,\r\n  The eyes just closed in death's eclipse,\r\n  The fairy finger tips\r\n\r\n  So lightly locked across the breast,\r\n  Seemed to obey the sweet behest\r\n  By angels whispered--Rest!\r\n\r\n  That beauty had been mine alone,\r\n  Those hands had fondly pressed my own,\r\n  Those eyes in mine had shone.\r\n\r\n  The open door was banged about,\r\n  As wailing winds went in and out\r\n  With sigh and groan and shout.\r\n\r\n  And darkly ran the river cold,\r\n  Whose swollen waters, as they rolled,\r\n  A tale of sorrow told.\r\n\r\n  I could not choose but seek that stream,\r\n  Whose sympathetic moan did seem\r\n  The music of a dream.\r\n\r\n  O River, that unceasing lay\r\n  Charms each fair tree along thy way,\r\n  Until it falls thy prey!\r\n\r\n  O endless moan within my heart,\r\n  Thy constancy has made me part\r\n  Of what thou wert and art!\r\n\r\n  And while I stood upon the brink,\r\n  And tried to think, but could not think,\r\n  Nor sight with reason link--\r\n\r\n  A form I had not seen before\r\n  Came slowly down the dismal shore;\r\n  A sombre robe she wore,\r\n\r\n  And in her air and on her face\r\n  There was a sterner kind of grace,\r\n  Heightened by time and place--\r\n\r\n  A sort of conscious power and pride,\r\n  A soul to substance more allied--\r\n  Than that of her who died.\r\n\r\n  With scarce a semblance of design,\r\n  Toward me her steps she did incline,\r\n  And raised her eyes to mine\r\n\r\n  So sweetly, so imploringly,\r\n  I scarcely wished, and did not try,\r\n  To put their pleading by,\r\n\r\n  And, ere a movement I had made,\r\n  Her hand upon my arm she laid,\r\n  And whispered: I obeyed.\r\n\r\n  While one into the darkness sped,\r\n  I followed where the other led;\r\n  Yet often turned my head,\r\n\r\n  As one who fancies that he hears\r\n  His own name ringing in his ears\r\n  Shouted from far-off spheres.\r\n\r\n  Oh! bliss misplaced is misery!\r\n  I love the life I've lost, but, see!\r\n  The life that's here loves me.\r\n\r\n  And while I seem her willing slave,\r\n  My heart is hid in weeds that wave\r\n  Above a distant grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAENONE:\r\n\r\nA TALE OF SLAVE LIFE IN ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIn an hour from that time the banqueting hall of the palace was prepared\r\nfor its guests. Silken couches had been drawn up around the table. Upon\r\nit glittered a rich array of gold and silver. Between the dishes stood\r\nflasks of rare wines. Upon the buffet near by were other wines cooling\r\nin Apennine snow. Tall candelabras in worked and twisted bronze stood at\r\nthe ends and sides of the table, and stretched overhead their arms hung\r\nwith lamps. From the walls were suspended other lamps, lighting up the\r\ntapestries and frescoes. At one end of the hall, richly scented spices\r\nburned upon a tripod. With a readiness and celerity for which the Vanno\r\npalace was famous, a feast fit for the emperor had been improvised in a\r\nfew minutes, and nothing was now wanting except the guests.\r\n\r\nThese now began to drop in one by one. The poet Emilius--the comedian\r\nBassus--the proconsul Sardesus--others of lesser note; but not one who\r\nhad not a claim to be present, by reason of intimate acquaintance or\r\nelse some peculiarly valuable trait of conviviality. In collecting\r\nthese, the armor bearer had made no mistake; and knowing his master's\r\ntastes and intimates, he had made up the roll of guests as discreetly as\r\nthough their names had been given him. One he had met in the\r\nstreet--others he had found at their homes. None to whom he gave the\r\ninvitation was backward in accepting it upon the spot, for there were\r\nfew places in Rome where equal festal gratification could be obtained.\r\nTo have been called to the house of Sergius Vanno and not to have gone\r\nthere, was to have lost a day to be forever regretted. None, therefore,\r\nwho had been spoken to, among that club of congenial spirits, was\r\nabsent. Of those who did not come, one was sick and two were at their\r\ncountry villas. These, however, were lesser lights, valuable by\r\nthemselves, perhaps, but of no account in comparison with others who had\r\ncome; and therefore their absence was scarcely noticed.\r\n\r\nSergius stood at the door receiving his guests as each arrived. He had\r\narrayed himself in his most festive costume, and had evidently resolved\r\nthat whatever might happen on the morrow, that night at least should be\r\npassed in forgetfulness and unbridled enjoyment. Even now his face was\r\nflushed with the wine he had taken in anticipation, in the hope of\r\ngiving an artificial elation to his spirits. But it seemed as though for\r\nthat time the wine had lost its accustomed charm. Although at each\r\ngreeting he strove to wreathe his face in smiles, yet it was but a\r\nfeeble mask, and could not hide the more natural appearances of care and\r\ngloom which rested upon his features; and while his voice seemed to\r\nretain its old ring of joyous welcome, there was an undertone of sad\r\ndiscordance. As the guests entered and exchanged greetings with their\r\nhost, each, after the first moment, looked askant at him, with the dim\r\nperception that, in some way, he was not as he was wont to be; and so,\r\nin a little while, they sank, one by one, into a troubled and\r\napprehensive silence. He, too, upon his part, looked furtively at them,\r\nwondering whether they had yet heard the thing that had befallen him. It\r\nwas but a short time ago, indeed, and yet in how few minutes might the\r\nunrestrained gossip of a slave have spread the ill tidings! For the\r\nmoment, Sergius recoiled from the difficult task of entertainment which\r\nhe had taken upon himself. Why, indeed, had he called these men around\r\nhim? How could he sit and pledge them in deep draughts, and all the time\r\nsuspect that each one knew his secret, and was laughing about it in his\r\nsleeve? And if they knew it not, so much the worse, for then he must\r\ntell the tale himself. Was it not partly for this purpose that he had\r\nassembled them? Far better to speak of it himself--to let them see how\r\nlittle he regarded the misfortune and the scandal--to treat it as a\r\nbrave jest--to give his own version of it--than to have the matter leak\r\nout in the ordinary way, with all conceivable distortions and\r\nexaggerations. But how, in fact, could he tell it? Was there one among\r\nthem who would not, while openly commiserating him, laugh at him in the\r\nheart? Did there not now sit before him the lieutenant Plautus, who,\r\nonly a month before, had met with a like disgrace, and about whom he had\r\ncomposed derisive verses? Would not the lieutenant Plautus now rejoice\r\nto make retaliatory odes? Would it not b e better, then, after all, to\r\nforbear any mention of the matter, and, letting its announcement take\r\nthe usual chance course, to devote this night, at least, to unbroken\r\nfestivity? But what if they already knew it?\r\n\r\nThus wandering in his mind from one debate to another, and ever, in a\r\nmoment, coming back to his original suspicion, he sat, essaying\r\ncomplimentary speeches and convivial jests, and moodily gazing from face\r\nto face, in a vain attempt to read their secret thoughts. He was wrong\r\nin his suspicions. Not one of them knew the reason of the burden upon\r\nhis mind. All, however, perceived that something had occurred to disturb\r\nhim, and his moody spirit shed its influence around, until the\r\nconversation once again flagged, and there was not one of the party who\r\ndid not wish himself elsewhere. The costliest viands and wines spread\r\nout before them were ineffective to produce that festive gayety upon\r\nwhich they had calculated.\r\n\r\n'By Parnassus!' exclaimed the poet Emilius, at length, pushing aside his\r\nplate of turbot, and draining his goblet 'Are we to sit here, hour after\r\nhour, winking and blinking at each other like owls over their mice? Was\r\nit merely to eat and drink that we have assembled? Hearken! I will read\r\nthat to you which will raise your spirits, to a certainty. To-morrow the\r\ngames and combats commence in the arena of the new amphitheatre. Well;\r\nand is it known to you that I am appointed to read a dedicatory ode\r\nbefore the emperor and in honor of that occasion? I will give you a\r\npleasure, now. I will forestall your joy, and let you hear what I have\r\nwritten. And be assured that this is no small compliment to your\r\nintelligence, since no eye hath yet looked upon a single verse thereof.'\r\n\r\nWith that the poet dragged from his breast his silken bundle, and\r\ncarefully began to unwind the covering.\r\n\r\n'You will observe,' he said, as he brought the precious parchment to\r\nlight, and smoothed it out upon the table before him, 'you will observe\r\nthat I commence with an invocation to the emperor, whom I call the most\r\nillustrious of all the Caesars, and liken to Jove. I then congratulate\r\nthe spectators, not only upon the joy of living in his time, but also\r\nupon being there to bask in the effulgence of--'\r\n\r\n'A truce to such mummery!' cried Sergius, suddenly arousing from his\r\nspiritual stupor and bursting into a shrill laugh. 'Do we care to listen\r\nto your miserable dactyls? Is it not a standing jest through Rome that,\r\nfor the past month, you have daily read your verses to one person after\r\nanother, with the same wretched pretence of exclusive favoritism? And do\r\nwe not know that no warrant has ever been given to you to recite a\r\nsingle line before the emperor, either in or out of the arena? We are\r\nhere to revel, not to listen to your stale aphorisms upon death and\r\nimmortality. Ho, there, more wine! Take off these viands, which already\r\npall upon us! Bring wine-more wine!'\r\n\r\nThe guests were not slow to respond to the altered mood of their host;\r\nfor it was merely the reflection of his sullen gravity that had eclipsed\r\ntheir own vivacity. The instant, therefore, that he led the way, the\r\nhall began to resound with jest and laughter. The poet, with some\r\nhumiliation, which he endeavored to conceal beneath an affectation of\r\nwounded dignity, commenced rolling up his manuscript, not before a\r\nsplash of wine from a carelessly filled flagon had soiled the\r\nfair-written characters. More flasks were placed upon the table by ready\r\nand obedient hands--and from that moment the real entertainment of the\r\nevening commenced.\r\n\r\nFaster than any of his guests, as though care could be the better\r\ndrowned by frequent libations, Sergius now filled and refilled his\r\nflagon; and though the repeated draughts may not have brought\r\nforgetfulness, yet, what was the nearest thing, they produced reckless\r\nindifference. No longer should the cloud which he had thus suddenly\r\nswept away from his brow be suffered to remain. Was he not master in his\r\nown house? If woman deceives, was that a reason why man should mourn and\r\ngrow gray with melancholy? What though a random thought might at times\r\nintrude, of one who, in the next room, with her head against the wall,\r\nlay in a half stupor, listening to the ring of goblets and the loud\r\nlaugh and jest? Had she not brought it all upon herself? He would fill\r\nup again, and think no more about it! And still, obedient to his\r\ndirecting tone, the guests followed him with more and more unbridled\r\nlicense, until the hall rang with merriment as it had never rung before.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, came the throwing of dice, which, at that time, were as\r\nessential a concomitant of a roystering party as, in later centuries,\r\ncards became. Nor were these the least attraction of the feasts of\r\nSergius; for though the excellence of his viands and wines was\r\nproverbial, the ease with which he could be despoiled at the gambling\r\ntable was not less so. Already he was known to have seriously crippled\r\nhis heritage by continued reverses, springing from united ill luck and\r\nwant of skill; but it was as well understood that much still remained.\r\nAnd then, as now, the morality of gambling was of a most questionable\r\ncharacter--invited guests not thinking it discreditable to unite in any\r\ncombinations for the purpose of better pillaging their host. This seemed\r\nnow the general purpose; for, leaving each other in comparative freedom\r\nfrom attack, they came forward one by one and pitted their purses, great\r\nand small, against Sergius, who sat pouring down wine and shaking the\r\ndicebox, while he called each by name, and contended against him. The\r\nusual result followed; for, whether owing to secret signs among the\r\nplayers, or to superior skill, the current of gold flowed but one way,\r\nfrom the host to his guests. For a while he bore the continued ill luck\r\nwith undiminished gayety, deeming that in meeting their united prowess\r\nhe was doing a brave thing, and that, whatever befell him, he should\r\nremember that in character of host, he must consent to suffer. But at\r\nlength he began to realize that his losses had been carried far enough.\r\nHe had never suffered so severely in any one evening before. Even his\r\nduty to them as their host did not demand that he should completely ruin\r\nhimself, and he began to suspect that he had half done so already. With\r\na hoarse laugh he pushed the dice away, and arose.\r\n\r\n'Enough--quite enough for one night,' he exclaimed. 'I have no more\r\ngold, nor, if I had, could I dare to continue, with this ill run against\r\nme. Perhaps after another campaign I may meet you again, and take my\r\nrevenge; which, if the Fates are just, must one day or another be\r\nallotted me. But not now.'\r\n\r\nHe thought that he was firm in his refusal, but his guests had not yet\r\ndone with him. It needed but gentle violence to push him back again upon\r\nhis seat, and to replace the dicebox in his hand.\r\n\r\n'Art weary, or afraid to continue?' said the praetorian captain. 'Well,\r\nlet there be one more main between us, and then we will end it all.\r\nListen! I have won this night two hundred sestertia. What is the worth\r\nof that quarry of yours to the south of the Porta Triumphalis?'\r\n\r\n'Three hundred sestertia--not less,' responded Sergius.\r\n\r\n'Nay, as much as that?' rejoined the captain, carelessly throwing down\r\nhis own dice. 'Then it is useless to propose what I was about to. I had\r\nthought that as the quarry had been well worked already, and was now\r\noverrun with fugitive slaves and Nazarenes, and the like, to ferret out\r\nwhom would require half a legion, I could offer to put the two hundred\r\nsestertia against it, so that you might chance to win them back. But it\r\nis of little consequence.'\r\n\r\nSergius sat for the moment nervously drumming upon the table. He knew\r\nthat the other was purposely disparaging the property and trying to\r\ntempt him into an equal stake; and yet he suffered himself to be\r\ntempted. The luck might this time be with him. It were worth while to\r\ntry it, at least. If he lost, it would be but one more buffet of\r\nfortune. And if he won, how easily would those two hundred sestertia\r\nhave been regained, and what a triumph over the one who had enticed him!\r\nAnd therefore they threw--five times a piece; and after a moment of\r\nbreathless excitement, the play was decided in favor of the captain.\r\n\r\n'The quarry is mine, therefore,' he said, endeavoring to assume a\r\nnonchalant air of indifference. 'Would you still win it back, Sergius?\r\nAnd the sesteria also? Well, there is that vineyard of yours on the\r\nslope of Tivoli, which--'\r\n\r\n'Stay!' exclaimed the proconsul Sardesus, who, of all the party had not\r\nas yet touched the dicebox. 'Let this be enough. Will you plunder him\r\nentirely? Have you no regard for my rights over him? Do you not know\r\nthat to-morrow, at the amphitheatre, Sergius and I are to match\r\ngladiators against each other for a heavy wager, and that I expect to\r\nwin? How, then will I get this money, if you now strip him of all that\r\nhe owns?'\r\n\r\nProbably the proconsul felt no fear about collecting what he might win,\r\nand spoke jestingly, and with the sole intention of putting a stop to a\r\nsystem of pillage which seemed to him already too flagrant and\r\nunscrupulous. But his words were too plainly spoken not to give offence\r\nat any time, more particularly now that all present were heated with\r\nexcitement; and the usual consequence of disinterested interference\r\nensued. The other guests in no measured language, began to mutter their\r\ndispleasure at the insinuations against themselves; while the host, for\r\nwhose benefit the interruption had been intended, resented it most\r\nstrongly of all. He needed no counsel, but was well able to take care of\r\nhimself, he intimated. And he remembered that he had entered into some\r\nsort of a wager about the result of a gladiatorial combat, and he had\r\nsupposed that no one would have doubted his ability to pay all that he\r\nmight lose therein. It was proper, at least, to wait until there had\r\nbeen some precedent of the kind proved against him. No one, so far, had\r\nfound him wanting. And the like.\r\n\r\n'And yet,' he continued, as after a moment of reflection he began to\r\nrealise the value of the wager, and how inconvenient it would be to\r\nlose, and that he had not yet succeeded in making any preparation for\r\nthe contest, 'when I tell you that I have not yet found a gladiator to\r\nmy mind, you will not force this match upon me to-morrow? You will\r\nforbear that advantage, and will consent to postpone our trial to\r\nanother time?'\r\n\r\nThe proconsul shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n'Was it in the bond,' he said, 'that one should await the convenience of\r\nthe other? Has there not been time enough for each to procure his man?\r\nThis wager was made between us mouths ago, Sergius--before even you went\r\ninto the East.'\r\n\r\n'And it was while I was there,' exclaimed Sergius eagerly, 'that I found\r\nmy man--a Rhodian, with the forehead, neck, and sinews of a bull. He\r\ncould have hugged a bull to death almost. Having him, I felt safe, for\r\nwho could you obtain to stand up against him? But in an evil hour, not\r\nover a month ago, this play actor here--this Bassus--by a stupid trick\r\ngained him from me. What, then, have I been able to do for myself since?\r\nI have sought far and near to replace him, but without success; and had\r\nmade up my mind, if you would not postpone the trial, to pay up the\r\nforfeit for not appearing, and think no more about it. But by the gods!\r\nI will, even at this late hour, make one more attempt. Harkee, Bassus!\r\nWhenever I have asked you about this Rhodian, you have said that you\r\nhave sold him; and, for some low reason, you have refused to tell who\r\nowns him now. Tell me, now, to whom you sold him, so that I can purchase\r\nhim at once! Tell me, I say; or there will be blood between us!'\r\n\r\n'What can he say,' interrupted the proconsul, 'but that he sold his\r\nRhodian to me, the day thereafter? You do well to praise him, Sergius.\r\nNever have I seen such a creature of brawn and muscle. And with the\r\ntraining I have given him, who, indeed, could overcome him? You will see\r\nhim to-morrow, in the arena. You will see how he will crush in the ribs\r\nof your gladiator, like an egg shell.'\r\n\r\nSergius gave vent to a groan of mingled rage and despair.\r\n\r\n'And you will not postpone this trial?' he said. 'Will you, then, take\r\nup with an offer to play off that Rhodian against ten of my slaves? No?\r\nAgainst twenty, then? What else will tempt you? Ah, you may think that I\r\nhave but little to offer to play against you, but it is not so. I have\r\nno gold left, and my last quarry is gone. But I have my vineyards and\r\nslaves in plenty. What say you, therefore?'\r\n\r\n'Tush! Beseech him not!' interrupted Emilius, to whom the mention of\r\nvineyards and slaves gave intimation of further spoils. 'Do you not see\r\nthat he shakes his head? And do you not know his obstinacy? You could\r\nnot move him now were you to pay him in full the amount of the forfeit.\r\nIt is not the gold that he longer cares for, but the chance to\r\ndistinguish himself by the exhibition of the slave of greatest strength\r\nand prowess. So let that matter go for settled. Rather strive, in some\r\nother manner, to win the money with which to pay your forfeit. This,\r\nwith good luck, you may do--a little here and a little there--who knows?\r\nPerhaps even I can help you. Have I not won fifty sestertia from you? I\r\nwill now wager it back against a slave.'\r\n\r\n'Against any slave?'\r\n\r\n'By Bacchus, no! I have enough of ordinary captives to suit me, and care\r\nbut little for any accession to the rabble of them. But you have one\r\nwhom I covet--a Greek of fair appearance and pleasing manners--fit not\r\nfor the camp or the quarries, but of some value as a page or cupbearer.\r\nIt was but lately that I saw him, writing at your lady's dictation, and\r\nI wished for him at once. Shall we play for him?'\r\n\r\n'No! a thousand times, no!' exclaimed Sergius, striking the table so\r\nheavily with his open hand that the dice danced and the flagons shook.\r\n'Were you to offer me thrice his value--to pay off my forfeit to\r\nSardesus to the last sestertium--to gain me back my quarry and my\r\nvineyards--all that I have lost--I would not give up that slave. My\r\npurpose is sweeter to me than all the gold you could offer, and I will\r\nnot be cheated out of it. That slave dies to-morrow in the\r\namphitheatre--between the lion's jaws!'\r\n\r\n'Dies? In the arena?' was the astonished exclamation.\r\n\r\n'Is there aught wonderful in that?' Sergius fiercely cried. 'Have you\r\nnever before known such a thing as a master giving up his slave for the\r\npublic amusement? And let no man ask me why I do it. It may be that I\r\nwish revenge, hating him too much to let him live. It may be that I seek\r\nto be a benefactor like others, and furnish entertainment to the\r\npopulace at my own expense. It is sufficient that I choose it. Will not\r\nany other slave answer, Emilius?'\r\n\r\n'Nay, no other will do,' remarked the poet, throwing himself carelessly\r\nback, with the air of one dismissing a fruitless subject from his mind.\r\n'This was the only one whom I coveted. For any other I would not care to\r\nshake the dicebox three times, though I might feel sure to win.'\r\n\r\n'Will you offer the same to me, Sergius?' eagerly cried the comedian. 'I\r\nalso have won heavily from you. Will you play any other slave than this\r\npage against fifty sestertia?'\r\n\r\nFor his only answer, Sergius seized the dice, and began impatiently to\r\nrattle them. The eyes of Bassus sparkled with anticipated victory.\r\n\r\n'You hear?' he cried, to all around him. 'Against my fifty sestertia he\r\nwill stake any of his slaves excepting this Greek page?'\r\n\r\n'They all hear the terms,' retorted Sergius. 'Now throw!'\r\n\r\n'Whether male or female?' continued Bassus, still looking around to see\r\nthat all understood.\r\n\r\n'Are they fools? Can they not hear? Will you throw or not?' shouted\r\nSergius.\r\n\r\nIn a wild delirium of excitement, the comedian began the game, and in a\r\nfew minutes it was concluded. Then he leaped from his seat, crying out:\r\n\r\n'I have won! And there can be no dispute now! You all heard that he gave\r\nthe choice of his slaves, whether male or female?'\r\n\r\n'Fool!' sneered Sergius, throwing himself back. 'What dispute can there\r\nbe? Do you think that I would deny my word? And do you suppose I did not\r\nknow your aims, cunningly as you may think you veiled them? Would I have\r\ngiven up Leta to you, if she had been of any further value to myself? By\r\nthe gods! had you waited a while, I do not know but what I would have\r\nmade her a present to you; not however, to oblige you, but to punish\r\nher!'\r\n\r\nThe comedian listened in chopfallen amazement. Already it seemed to him\r\nthat his prize had lost half its value.\r\n\r\n'Be at rest, though,' Sergius continued, in a contemptuous tone. 'I have\r\nmerely tired of her, that is all. Her eyes are as bright and her voice\r\nas silvery as ever. She may not ever come to love you much, but she will\r\nhave the wit to pretend that she does; and if she makes you believe\r\nher--as you doubtless will--it will be all the same thing to you. Who\r\nknows, too, with what zeal she may worm herself into your affection,\r\nunder the guidance of her ambition? For, that she has ambition, you will\r\nsoon discover. By Bacchus! since you have no wife or household to fetter\r\nyour fancies, it would not surprise me were you to succumb to her wiles,\r\nand to make of her your wife. You may recline there and smile with\r\nincredulity; but such things have been done before this, and by men who\r\nwould not condescend to look upon one in your poor station. Yes, I will\r\nwager that, in the end, you will make of her your wife. Well, it would\r\nbe no harm to you. She will then deceive you, of course; but what of\r\nthat? Have not better men submitted to that inevitable lot? Yes, she\r\nwill deceive you; and then will smile upon you, and you will believe her\r\nword, and be again deceived. But you will have only yourself to blame\r\nfor it. I have warned you in advance.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nAs the shouts of laughter elicited by the host's remark rang through the\r\nhall, drowning the muttered response of the comedian, Leta glided softly\r\nand rapidly from behind the screen of tapestry which veiled the open\r\ndoorway. There, crouching out of sight, she had remained concealed for\r\nthe last hour--watching the revellers through a crevice in the\r\nneedlework, and vainly hoping, either in the words or face of Sergius,\r\nto detect some tone or expression indicative of regretful thought or\r\nrecollection of herself. When at last her name had been mentioned, for a\r\nmoment she had eagerly held her breath, lest she might lose one syllable\r\nfrom which an augury of her fate could be drawn. Then, repressing, with\r\na violent effort, the cry of despair which rose to her lips, upon\r\nhearing herself thus coolly and disdainfully surrendered as the stake of\r\na game of dice, and with less apparent regret than would have been felt\r\nfor the loss of a single gold piece, she drew the folds of her dress\r\nclosely about her and passed out.\r\n\r\nOut through the antechamber--down the stairway--and into the central\r\ncourt; no other purpose guiding her footsteps than that of finding some\r\nplace where she could reflect, without disturbance, upon the fate before\r\nher. In that heated hall she must have died; but it might be that in the\r\ncool, open air, she could conquer the delirium which threatened to\r\noverwhelm her, and could thus regain her self-control. If only for five\r\nminutes, it might be well. With her quick energy and power of decision,\r\neven five minutes of cool, deliberate counsel with herself might suffice\r\nto shape and direct her whole future life.\r\n\r\nHardly realizing how she had come there, she found herself sitting upon\r\nthe coping of the courtyard fountain. The night was dark, for thick\r\nclouds shut out the gleam of moon and stars. No one could see her, nor\r\nwas it an hour when any one was likely to be near. From one end to the\r\nother the court was deserted, except by herself. No light, other than\r\nthe faint glow from the windows of the banquet hall upon the story above\r\nher. No sound beyond the sullen splash of the water falling into the\r\nmarble basin of the fountain. There was now but little to interfere with\r\ndeliberate reflection.\r\n\r\nWhat demon had possessed the Fates that they should have brought this\r\nlot upon her? It could not be the destiny which had been marked out for\r\nher from the first. That had been a different one, she was sure. Her\r\ninstinct had whispered peace and success to her. Such were the blessings\r\nwhich should have been unravelled for her from off the twirling spindle;\r\nbut some malignant spirit must have substituted another person's\r\ndeserved condemnation in place of her more kindly lot.\r\n\r\nThat she had failed in attaining the grand end of her desires was not,\r\nof itself, the utmost of her misfortune. She had aimed high, because it\r\nwas as easy to do that as to accept a lower object of ambition. She had\r\ntaken her course, believing that all things are possible to the\r\nenergetic and daring, but, at the same time, fully realizing the chances\r\nof failure. But to fail had simply seemed to her to remain where she\r\nwas, instead of ascending higher--to miss becoming the wife of the\r\nimperator, but to continue, as before, the main guide and direction of\r\nhis thoughts, impulses, and affections.\r\n\r\nAnd now, without previous token or warning, had come upon her the\r\nterrible realization that she had not only gained nothing, but had lost\r\nall, and that the fatal chance which had fettered her schemes, had also\r\nled to her further degradation. Thrown aside like a broken toy-with a\r\njeering confession that she had wearied her possessor--with a cool,\r\nheartless criticism upon her character, and with cruel prophecies about\r\nher future--gambled for with one whose sight filled her with\r\nabhorrence--and, when won, made over to him as a bone is tossed to a\r\ndog--what more bitterness could be heaped upon her?\r\n\r\nBut there was now no use in mourning about the past. What had been done\r\ncould not be altered. Nor could she disguise from herself the\r\nimpossibility of ever regaining her former position and influence. Those\r\nhad passed away forever. She must now look to the future alone, and\r\nendeavor so to shape its course as to afford herself some relief from\r\nits terrors. Possibly there might yet be found a way of escape.\r\n\r\nShould she try to fly? That, she knew, could not be done--at least,\r\nalone. The world was wide, but the arm of the imperial police was long;\r\nand though she might, for a little while, wander purposelessly hither\r\nand thither, yet before many hours the well-directed efforts of a\r\npursuer would be sure to arrest her. She could die--for in every place\r\ndeath is within reach of the resolute; but she did not wish to die. For\r\none instant, indeed, she thought of the Tiber, and the peace which might\r\nbe found beneath its flow--but only for an instant. And she almost\r\nthanked the gods in her heart that it had not yet gone so far with her\r\nas that.\r\n\r\nBurying her face in her hands, she sat for a moment, endeavoring to\r\nabstract her thoughts from all outward objects, so as the more readily\r\nto determine what course to adopt. But for a while it seemed as though\r\nit was impossible for her to fix her mind aright. Each instant some\r\nintruding trifle interfered to distract her attention from the only\r\ngreat object which now should claim it. A long-forgotten incident of the\r\npast would come into her mind--or perhaps some queer conceit which at\r\nthe time had caused laughter. She did not laugh now, but none the less\r\nwould she find herself revolving the merits of the speech or action.\r\nThen, the soft fall of the water into the fountain basin annoyed her,\r\nand it occurred to her that it might be this--which prevented undivided\r\nreflection. Stooping over, therefore, and feeling along the edge of the\r\nbasin, she found the vent of the pipes, and stopped the flow. At once\r\nthe light stream began to diminish and die away, until in a moment the\r\nwater was at rest, except for the few laggard drops which one by one\r\nrolled off the polished shoulders of the bronze figures. These gradually\r\nall trickled down, and then it seemed as though at last there must be\r\nsilence. But the murmur of the evening breeze among the trees\r\nintervened; and, far more exasperating than all, she could now hear the\r\nbursts of merriment which rang out from the banqueting room overhead.\r\nTherefore, once more putting her hand into the basin, she turned on the\r\nflow, and the gentle stream again sprang from the outstretched cup and\r\nfell down, deadening all lesser sounds.\r\n\r\nThen Leta looked up at the sky, overspread with its thick pall of\r\nclouds, and wondered vacantly whether there would be rain upon the\r\nmorrow, and if so, whether the games appointed for the new amphitheatre\r\nwould take place. But she recovered herself with a start, and again\r\nburied her face in her hands. What were games and combats of that kind\r\nto her? She was to enter upon a different kind of struggle. She must\r\nreflect--reflect!--and when she had reflected, must act!\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes she thus remained; and now, indeed, seemed to have\r\ngained the required concentration of thought. No outward sound disturbed\r\nher. Once a Nubian slave, who had heard the stoppage of the fountain's\r\nflow, emerged from beneath an archway, as though to examine into the\r\ndifficulty. Finding that the water was still playing as usual, he\r\nimagined that he must have been mistaken, gave utterance to an oath in\r\ncondemnation of his own stupidity, slowly walked around the basin,\r\nlooked inquiringly at Leta, and, for the moment, made as though he would\r\nhave accosted her--and then, changing his mind, withdrew and walked back\r\nsilently into the house. Still she did not move.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, she raised her head and stood upright. Her eyes now\r\nshone with deep intensity of purpose, and her lips were firmly set.\r\nSomething akin to a smile flickered around the corners of her mouth,\r\nbetraying not pleasure, but satisfaction. She had evidently reflected to\r\nsome purpose, and now the trial for action had arrived.\r\n\r\n'Strange that I should not have thought of it before,' she murmured to\r\nherself. Then stepping under the archway which led from the courtyard\r\ninto the palace, she reached up against the wall and took down two keys\r\nwhich hung there. Holding them tightly, so that they might not clink\r\ntogether, she glided along, past the fountain--through the clump of\r\nplane trees--keeping as much as possible in the deeper shadows of arch\r\nand shrubbery--and so on along the whole length of the court, until she\r\nstood by the range of lower erections which bounded its farther\r\nextremity. Then, fitting one of the keys into an iron door, she softly\r\nunlocked it.\r\n\r\nEntering, she stood within a low stone cell. It was the prison house of\r\nthe palace, used for the reception of new slaves, and for the punishment\r\nof such others as gave offence. It was a long, narrow apartment, paved\r\nwith stone and lighted by a single grated aperture set high in the wall\r\nupon the courtyard side. The place was of sufficient dimensions to hold\r\nfifty or sixty persons, but, in the present case, there was but one\r\ntenant--Cleotos---Not even a guard was with him, for the strength of the\r\nwalls and the locks were considered amply sufficient to prevent escape.\r\n\r\nCleotos was sitting upon a stone bench, resting his head upon his right\r\nhand. At the opening of the door he looked up. He could not see who it\r\nwas that entered, but the light tread and the faint rustle of a waving\r\ndress sufficiently indicated the sex. If it had been daylight, a flush\r\nmight have been seen upon his face, for the thought flashed upon his\r\nmind that it might be AEnone herself coming to his assistance. But the\r\nfirst word undeceived him; and he let his head once more fall between\r\nthe palms of his hands.\r\n\r\n'Cleotos,' whispered Leta, 'it is I. I have come to set you free.'\r\n\r\n'It is right,' he said, moodily. 'All this I owe to you alone. It is\r\nfit that you should try to undo your work.'\r\n\r\n'Could I foresee that it would come to this?' she responded, attempting\r\njustification. 'How was I to know that my trivial transgression would\r\nhave ended so sorrowfully for you? But all that is easily mended. You\r\nhave money, and a token which will identify you to the proper parties.\r\nThere is yet time to reach Ostia before that ship can sail.'\r\n\r\n'How knew you that I had gold--or this signet ring; or that there was a\r\nship to sail from Ostia?' he exclaimed with sudden fierceness. 'You,\r\nthen, had been listening at the door! And having listened, you must have\r\nknown with what innocence we spoke together! And yet, seeing all this,\r\nyou called him to the spot and left him to let his eyes be deceived and\r\nhis heart filled with bitter jealousy, and have played upon his passion\r\nby wicked misrepresentation, until you have succeeded in bringing ruin\r\nupon all about you! I see it all now, as clearly as though it were\r\nwritten upon a parchment rolled out before me! To think that the gods\r\nhave beheld you doing this thing, and yet have not stricken you dead!'\r\n\r\n'I have sinned,' she murmured, seizing his hand and bending over, so\r\nthat a ready tear rolled down upon it. He felt it fall, but moved not.\r\nOnly a few days before, her tears would have moved him; but now his\r\nheart was hardened against her. He had found out that her nature was\r\ncruel and not easily moral to repentance, and that, if emotion was ever\r\nsuffered to overcome her, it was tolerated solely for some crafty\r\ndesign. The falling tear, therefore, simply bade him be upon his guard\r\nagainst deceit, lest once again she might succeed in weaving her wiles\r\nabout him. Or, if she really wept with repentance, he knew that it was\r\nnot repentance for the sin itself, but rather for some baffled purpose.\r\n\r\n'Go on,' he simply said.\r\n\r\n'I have sinned,' she repeated, still clinging to his hands. 'But, O\r\nCleotos! when I offer to undo my work and set you free, you will surely\r\nforgive me?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is right that you should repair the mischief you have caused,'\r\nhe repeated; 'and I will avail myself of it. To-night, since you offer\r\nto set me free, and claim that you have the power to do so--to-night for\r\nOstia; and then, then away forever from this ruthless land! But stay!\r\nWhat of our mistress? I will not go hence until I know that she is safe\r\nand well.'\r\n\r\n'She is well,' responded Leta, fearful lest the truth might throw a new\r\nobstacle before her plans. 'And all is again right between her lord and\r\nherself, for I have assured him of her innocence.'\r\n\r\n'Then, since this is so, there is no motive for me to tarry,' he said.\r\nHe believed her, and was satisfied; not that he esteemed her worthy of\r\nbelief, but because it did not seem to him possible that such a matter\r\nas a grateful kiss upon a protecting hand could require much\r\nexplanation. 'I would like well once more to see her and bid her\r\nfarewell, and utter my thanks for all her kindness; but to what purpose?\r\nI have done that already, and could do and say no more than I have\r\nalready done and said. There remains, therefore, nothing more than to\r\nfulfil her commands, and return to my native home. But tell her, Leta,\r\nthat my last thought was for her, and that her memory will ever live in\r\nmy heart.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot tell her this,' slowly murmured Leta, 'for I shall not see her\r\nagain. I--I go with you.'\r\n\r\nCleotos listened for a moment in perplexed wonderment, and then, for his\r\nsole answer, dropped her hand and turned away. She understood him as\r\nwell as though he had spoken the words of refusal.\r\n\r\n'You will not take me with you, then; is it not so?' she said. 'Some\r\nnice point of pride, or some feeling of fancied wrong, or craving for\r\nrevenge, or, perhaps, love for another person, tells you now to separate\r\nyourself from me! And yet you loved me once. This, then, is man's\r\npromised faith!'\r\n\r\n'You dare to talk to me of faith and broken vows!' he exclaimed, after a\r\nmoment of speechless amazement at her hardiness in advancing such a\r\nplea. 'You, who for weeks have treated me with scorn and\r\nindifference--who have plotted against me, until my life itself has been\r\nbrought into danger--who, apart from all that, cast me off when first we\r\nmet in Rome, telling me then that I was and could be nothing to you,\r\nyes, even that our association from the first had been a mistake and a\r\nwrong! Yes, Leta, there was a time when I truly loved you, as man had\r\nnever then done, or since, or ever will again; but impute not to me the\r\nblame that I cannot do so now.'\r\n\r\n'I was to blame,' she said; and it seemed that this night must be a\r\nnight of confession for her, in so few things could she justify herself\r\nby denial or argument. 'I acknowledge my fault, and how my heart has\r\nbeen drawn from you by some delusion, as powerful and resistless as\r\nthough the result of magic. But when I confess it freely, and tell you\r\nhow I now see my duty and my heart more clearly, as though a veil of\r\nafter all, I find no forgiveness in your heart, said I not truly that\r\nman's faith cannot be trusted? Am I not the same Leta as of old?'\r\n\r\n'The same as of old?' he exclaimed. 'Can you look earnestly and\r\ntruthfully into your soul, and yet avow that you are the pure-hearted\r\ngirl who roamed hand in hand with me only a year ago, in our native\r\nisle, content to have no ambition except that of living a humble life\r\nwith me? And now, with your simple tastes and desires swept away--with\r\nyour soul covered with love of material pleasures as with a lava\r\ncrust--wrapt up in longing for Rome's most sinful, artificial\r\nexcesses--having, for gold or position or power or ambition, or what\r\nnot, so long as it was not for love, given yourself up a willing victim\r\nto a heartless master--do you dare, after this, to talk to me of love,\r\nand call yourself the same?'\r\n\r\n'And are you one of those who believe that there can be no forgiveness\r\nfor repentant woman?'\r\n\r\n'Of forgiveness, all that can be desired; but of forgetfulness, none.\r\nThere is one thing that no man can forget; and were I to repulse the\r\nadmonitions of my judgment, and strive to pass that thing by, who would\r\nsooner scorn me than yourself? Let all this end. Know that I love you\r\nnot, and could never love you again. Your scorn, indifference, and\r\ndeceit have long ago crushed from my heart all the love it once held.\r\nKnow further, that if I did still love you, my pride would condemn the\r\nfeeling, and I would never rest until I had destroyed it, even were it\r\nnecessary to destroy myself rather than to yield.'\r\n\r\n'These are brave words, indeed!' she exclaimed, taunted by his rebuke\r\ninto a departure from her assumption of affection. 'But they better suit\r\nthe freeman upon his own mountain side than the slave in his cell. Samos\r\nis still afar off. The road from here to Ostia has not yet been\r\ntraversed by you in safety. Even this door between you and the open\r\nstreet has not been thrown back. And yet you dare to taunt me, knowing\r\nthat I hold in my hand the key, and, by withdrawing it, can take away\r\nall hope from you. Do you realize what will be your fate if you remain\r\nhere--how that on the morrow the lions and leopards of the amphitheatre\r\nwill quarrel over your scattered limbs?'\r\n\r\n'Is this a threat?' he cried. 'Is it to tell me that if I do not give my\r\nlove where my honor tells me it should not be given, I must surely die!\r\nSo, then, let it be. I accept the doom. One year ago, I would have\r\ncheerfully fought in the arena for your faintest smile. Now I would\r\nrather die there than have your sullied love forced upon me.'\r\n\r\nWithout another word he sat down again upon the stone bench. Even in\r\nthat darkness she could note how resolute was his expression, how firm\r\nand unyielding his attitude. She had roused his nature, as she had never\r\nseen it before. She had not believed that a spirit which she had been\r\naccustomed to look upon as so much inferior in strength to her own,\r\ncould show such unflinching determination; and for the moment she stood\r\nadmiring him, and wondering whether, if he had always acted like that,\r\nhe might not have bound her soul to his own and kept her to himself\r\nthrough all temptation and trial. Then, taking the other key, she\r\nunlocked the door in the rear wall of the cell, and threw it open. The\r\nnarrow street behind the court was before him, and he was free to go.\r\n\r\n'I meant it not for a threat,' she said. 'However low I may sink, I have\r\nnot yet reached the pass of wishing to purchase or beg for affection.\r\nWhy I spoke thus, I know not. It may be that I thought some gratitude\r\nmight be due me for rescuing you. But I cannot tell what I, thought. Or\r\nit might have been that words were necessary for me, and that I used the\r\nfirst that came. But let that pass. Know only that your safety lies\r\nbefore you, and that it is in your power to grasp it. And now, farewell.\r\nYou leave me drifting upon a downward course, Cleotos. Sometimes,\r\nperhaps, when another person is at your side, making your life far\r\nhappier than I could have made it, you will think kindly of me.'\r\n\r\n'I think kindly of you now, Leta,' he said. 'Whatever love I can give,\r\napart from the love which I once asked you to accept, is yours. In\r\neverything that brotherly affection can bestow, there will be no limit\r\nto my care and interest for you. Nay, more, you shall now go away from\r\nhence with me; and though I cannot promise more than a brother's love,\r\nyet with that for your guide and protection, you can reach your native\r\nhome in peace and security, and there work out whatever repentance you\r\nmay have here begun.'\r\n\r\n'And when we are there, and those who have known us begin to ask why,\r\nwhen Cleotos has brought Leta back in safety, he regards her only as a\r\nsister and a friend, and otherwise remains sternly apart from her, what\r\nanswer can be given which will not raise suspicion and scorn, and make\r\nmy life a burden to me? No, Cleotos, it cannot be. Cruel as my lot may\r\nbe here, I have only myself to answer for it, and it is easier to hide\r\nmyself from notice in this whirl of sin and passion than if at home\r\nagain. And whatever may henceforth happen to me, the Fates are surely\r\nmost to blame. How can one avoid his destiny?'\r\n\r\n'The Fates do not carve out our destiny,' he said. 'They simply carry\r\ninto relentless effect the judgments which our own passions and\r\nweaknesses pronounced upon ourselves. O Leta! have you considered what\r\nyou are resolved upon encountering? Do you not know that some day this\r\nmaster of yours will tire of you, and fling you to some friend of his--a\r\nsoldier, actor, or what not--that as the years run on and your beauty\r\nfades, you will fall lower and lower? Have not thousands like yourself\r\nthus gone on, until at last, becoming old and worthless, they are left\r\nto die alone upon some island in the Tiber? Pray that you may die a\r\nbetter death than that!'\r\n\r\n'It is a sad picture,' she answered. 'It is not merely possible, but\r\nalso probable. I acknowledge it all. And yet, if I saw it all unrolled\r\nbefore me as my certain doom, I do not know that I would try to shun it.\r\nAlready the glitter of this world has changed my soul from what it was,\r\nand I am now too feeble of purpose to spend long years in retrieving the\r\nerrors of the past. There came into my heart a thought--a selfish\r\nthought--that you might forget what has gone before; and then it seemed\r\nthat I might succeed in winning back my peace, and so shun the fate\r\nwhich lies before me. But you cannot forget. I blame you not: you are\r\nright. You have never spoken more truly than when you said that I would\r\nhave despised you if you had yielded. Therefore, that hope is gone; and\r\nnow I must submit to the destiny which is coming upon me.'\r\n\r\n'But, Leta, only strive to think that--'\r\n\r\n'Nay, what is the use? Rather let me throw all regrets away, and strive\r\nnot to think at all. Why not yield with a pleasant grace to the current,\r\nwhen we know that, in the end, struggle as we may, it will surely sweep\r\nus under?'\r\n\r\n'Leta--dear Leta--'\r\n\r\n'Not a word, dear Cleotos; it must not be. From this hour I banish all\r\nhuman affections from my heart, as I banish all hope. Could you remain\r\nhere, you would see how relentless and fierce my nature will grow. Plots\r\nand schemes shall now be my amusement; for if I must be destroyed,\r\nothers shall fall with me. This must be the last tender impulse of my\r\nlife. I know not why it is, but I could now really weep. Cleotos,\r\nforgive me! I came hither, loving you not, but hoping to beguile you\r\ninto receiving me again. I have failed, and I ought to hate you for it;\r\nand yet I almost love you instead. It is strange, is it not?\r\n\r\n'But, Leta--'\r\n\r\n'How my heart now feels soft and tender with our recollections of other\r\ndays! Do you remember, Cleotos, how once, when children, we went\r\ntogether and stole the grapes from Eminides's vine? And how, when he\r\nwould have beaten you, I stood before you, and prevented him? Who would\r\nthen have thought that, in a few years, we should be here in\r\nRome--slaves, and parting forever? We shall never again together see\r\nEminides's vineyard, shall we?'\r\n\r\n'O Leta--my sister--'\r\n\r\n'There, there; speak not, but go at once, for some one comes near. Tarry\r\nno longer. If at home they ask after me, tell them I am dead. Farewell,\r\ndear Cleotos. Kiss me good-by. Do not grudge me that, at least. And may\r\nthe gods bless you!'\r\n\r\nHe would still have spoken, would have claimed a minute to plead with\r\nher and try to induce her to leave the path she was pursuing, and go\r\nwith him. But at that instant the voice of some one approaching sounded\r\nlouder, and the tones of Sergias could be distinguished as he tried to\r\ntroll forth the catch of a drinking melody. There was no time to lose.\r\nWith a farewell pressure of her arm about Cleotos's neck, Leta pushed\r\nhim through the aperture into the dark back street; and then, leaving\r\nthe keys in the locks, turned back into the garden, and fled toward the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary characteristics of creation are aggregation, producing all\r\nexisting forms; and dissolution, in which the parts suffer\r\ndisintegration, their varied elements entering into new combinations.\r\nThe active powers producing such normal condition of matter, which is\r\nceaseless motion, are comprehended in attraction for aggregation, and\r\nrepulsion for dissolution, alternately. This power of combing atoms and\r\ndissolving their connection is electric, which is only possessed by that\r\nelement, in its dual character of attraction and repulsion; and thus we\r\nmay reasonably assume that electricity is the material wherewith\r\ncreative energy manifests its power in the varied combinations,\r\ndissolutions, and reconstructions which comprise all animate and\r\ninanimate existences. This same cosmical power, electricity, holds all\r\nworlds in their normal relations, and is the source of light and heat,\r\nas well as the connecting link, through our electric nerve cords, by\r\nwhich our minds alone commune with the outer world, in direct contact\r\nwith our bodily senses, and hence becomes the medium of all our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY AS THE SOURCE OF LIGHT, HEAT, GRAVITATION, AND THE ORIGIN op\r\nALL GLOBES, NEBULAE, AND COMETIC MATTER.\r\n\r\nIf space were wholly devoid of matter, all globes, or other masses of\r\nmatter, would be dissipated into it, or _a priori_ could not have been\r\nformed from it. The material interchange, passing through space, between\r\nglobes, in all stages of formation, such as light, heat, and\r\ngravitation, could not be conducted through a vacuum, as their very\r\npresence would be destructive of vacuity. Materiality would be\r\ndissipated or absorbed in an attempted passage through vacuity;\r\ntherefore, as we know that light, heat, and gravitation are,\r\nnecessarily, material, space is but diffused materiality, at its minimum\r\nof etheriality. Globes moving in their orbits and on their axes must\r\nthus meet with resistance: this, together with the internal motion of\r\ntheir contained elements, necessarily excites the constant production of\r\nelectricity, in its dual character of attraction and repulsion,\r\naccording to its well-known laws; and this double character, alone\r\npossessed by electricity, when concentrated produces material affinity,\r\nwith reciprocal attraction and repulsion, in all its atoms, thus forever\r\npreventing entire solidity or entire separation of its parts. Such\r\ncondensation of matter by electric action, is the origin of heat and the\r\nvariety produced by incandescence, which, therefore, accounts for the\r\nformation of globes from the materials in space, and their sustentation\r\nin orbit.\r\n\r\nAs motion is the normal condition of matter, and is the producer of\r\nelectricity, therefore electric actions, concentrated in space,\r\nnecessarily gathers cometic and nebulous matter from space, the\r\nmaterials, through incandescence, for future globes, with orbits\r\ncontracting in proportion to condensation, its maximum of attraction. As\r\nmaterial space is boundless, so the creation of globes is endless\r\ntherein, through electric action, by producing gradual centres of\r\nmaterial condensation, the mere whirlpool specks in infinite space.\r\n\r\nRevolving bodies, gaseous, fluid, or solid, thus impress or charge the\r\ncentres of their motion, by superinduced attraction, with electricity,\r\nas their Leyden jars. So, too, the central body, or primary of a system,\r\nso overcharged with electricity by its revolving secondaries, becomes\r\npositively electrified or repellant to all such revolving bodies; and\r\nthus the producers and accumulator are mutually attractive and repellant\r\nof each other.\r\n\r\nThe planets, by their lightning speed in orbits and on their axes, being\r\nproducers, and the sun the recipient or accumulator of electricity; the\r\nlatter, as the centre of our revolving system, is the Leyden jar, and\r\nthus becomes the overcharged positive source and dispenser of electric\r\nlight and heat to the surrounding planets.\r\n\r\nThe planets, as producers, are always negatively electric, tending\r\ntoward the accumulator, the sun; while the latter, as the accumulator,\r\nbeing overcharged, is positively electric, and repels. The sun being the\r\ngreater body, the planets' negative electric attraction for it must\r\nalways yield to the greater mass and tend toward the sun; while that\r\ngreat body, overcharged with accumulated positive electricity, is fully\r\ncapable of repelling such tendency of the lesser revolving planets\r\ntoward it. Attraction or gravitation with the planets, and repulsion\r\n(instead of centrifugal force) with the sun, forever and inexhaustibly\r\nretain the various bodies, of each system, in their respective orbits.\r\nAs motion is the normal condition of matter, eternally producing\r\nelectric action, and when centralized evolving light and heat; so light\r\nand heat are as inexhaustibly eternal as motion, and may thus be\r\ndemonstrated as electric. The same principle of action applies to all\r\nindividual globes of each separate system, conjointly; and collectively,\r\nthe different systems mutually attract and repel each other,\r\nproportionate to mass and the weakened forces of distance, thus\r\npreserving a cosmical harmony throughout creation, forever forbidding\r\ncollision or destruction of individual globes.\r\n\r\nThis theory will be found to correspond with the well-known laws of\r\npositive and negative electric action; as well as illustrative of the\r\ninfluence of electric light on vegetable production--the only\r\nartificially produced light, capable of imparting a healthy growth, and\r\ncolor--which, I think, clearly proves it to be of the same character as\r\nsolar light. It is also corroborative of much that is inexplicable,\r\nexcept in the identity of electricity with solar effulgence, as the\r\nsource of light, heat, and gravitation, as well as substituting\r\nrepulsion for centrifugal force, and must forever disprove the theory of\r\nsolar light being the result of mere metallic incandescence, or any\r\nother equally exhausting combustion. The latter theory, with such\r\nsupposed expedients in nature, to carry out the mighty design of\r\ncreation, belittles the subject by its transitoriness, and is,\r\ntherefore, unworthy the conception of modern generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF HAZE, FOGS, AND CLOUDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe predominant haze, which generally envelops the landscape and reddens\r\nthe sun and moon during long droughts, is usually ascribed to smoke from\r\nburning woods and forests, pervading the air. I have observed a similar\r\nprevalent haze, connected with other extensive droughts than the one\r\nfrom which the country is now (August) suffering, and have invariably\r\nheard the same vague and inadequate cause assigned. Observation proves\r\nconclusively, that the assigned is not the true general cause (although\r\nit has its purely local effect), as with winds, for days together, in\r\nopposite quarters from local fires on mountain or plain, such widespread\r\ndistricts remain enveloped in haze, although hundreds of miles distant.\r\nNeither over such districts was there any odor as from smoke pervading\r\nthe atmosphere (except temporarily from some neighboring chimneys, which\r\nthe then heavy air kept near the earth), nor felt by the eyes, which\r\nvery perceptibly smart when exposed to smoke. It is impossible, with\r\nvarying winds, that mere local fires should spread smoke so uniformly as\r\nto comprise most of the area of the drought, which on this occasion\r\nextended from our great western lakes to the Atlantic seacoast; and\r\nanomalously, too, that it should have continued so long after a rain had\r\nextinguished those fires.\r\n\r\nI should assign a very different cause for this phenomenon. Rain drops\r\nare negatively electric, while suspended moisture, such as fog, displays\r\nitself in the form of vesicles or globules, distended by the presence\r\nand prevalence of positive electricity, which refracts the rays of light\r\nfrom so many myriad surfaces, that all objects are thus, necessarily,\r\nobscured to the eye. During droughts, when haze prevails, positive\r\nelectricity in the air becomes in excess, which is heating, and\r\ntherefore serves still more to subdivide, as well as to expand or\r\ndistend the floating moisture in the atmosphere (of which it is never\r\nentirely deprived) into infinitesimal vesicles, or globules, like minute\r\nsoap bubbles, and thus from such an infinite number of refracting\r\nsurfaces is produced the haze, as well as the obscuration of the\r\nlandscape and the reddened disks of the sun and moon, by the absorption\r\nof their heat or red rays, so characteristic of great droughts. This\r\nsame infinitesimal vesicular condition of suspended moisture, is also\r\nthe sufficient cause of there being no deposition of dew on such\r\noccasions, except where a local change of electric condition cools the\r\nair, thus temporarily clearing the atmosphere, and permitting a local\r\ndeposition of the previously suspended moisture, in the form of dew.\r\n\r\nAll fogs are due to this same cause, as well as that which, in extreme\r\nwintry cold, overhangs the open water, as it yields its comparative heat\r\nto the air. The formation and suspension of clouds, in all their varied\r\ncharacteristics, have the same origin. That highly attenuated haze which\r\ninvests the distant landscape, particularly mountains, with its magical\r\npurple hue, is due to the same, but still more ethereal interposition of\r\ninfinitesimal globules of suspended moisture. In corroboration of this\r\nbeing the true explanation of the phenomena of haze, fogs, etc., is the\r\nfact, that as soon as clouds prevail, denoting an electric change in the\r\natmosphere, all haze immediately disappears, or becomes embraced in the\r\nlarger vesicles or globules, forming clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLY LEAVES FROM THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER.\r\n\r\nPART II.--CHEVRONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sewed them on upside down. Please to remember that this was in May,\r\n1861 (or was it 1851? it seems a long time ago), when a young lady of\r\nthe most finished education, polished to the uttermost nine, could not\r\nreasonably be expected to know what a sergeant-major was, much less the\r\nparticular cut and fashion of his badge of rank. I told her, exultingly,\r\nthat I was appointed sergeant-major of our battalion. 'What's that?' she\r\ninquired, simply enough. I explained. The dignity and importance of the\r\noffice was scarcely diminished in her mind by my explanation; and,\r\nindeed, I thought it the grandest in the army. Who would be a\r\ncommissioned officer, when he could wear our gorgeous gray uniform,\r\ntrimmed with red, the sleeves wellnigh hidden behind three broad red\r\nstripes in the shape of a V, joined at the top by as many broad red\r\narcs, all beautifully set off by the lithe and active figure of\r\nSergeant-Major William Jenkins? As for Mary, who protested that she\r\nnever could learn the difference between all these grades, or make out\r\nthe reason for them, she was for her part convinced that not even the\r\ncolonel himself, certainly not that fat Major Heavysterne, could be\r\ngrander, or handsomer, or more important than her William. So I forgave\r\nher for sewing on my chevrons upside down, although it was at the time\r\nan infliction grievous to be born, inasmuch as the fussy little\r\nquartermaster-sergeant was thereby enabled to get a day's start of in\r\nthe admiration and envy of our old company. How they envied us, to be\r\nsure! But I had one consolation: Oates' were all straight; mine were\r\narched. And _she_ sewed mine on. His were done by Cutts & Dunn's\r\nbandy-legged foreman.\r\n\r\nThere never was such a uniform as ours. Not even the 'Seventh'\r\nitself--incomparable in the eyes of the _three_-months'--could vie in\r\ngrand and soldierly simplicity, we thought, with the gray and red of the\r\n9th Battalion, District of Columbia Volunteers. Gray cap, with a red\r\nband round it, letters A S, for 'American Sharpshooters' (Smallweed used\r\nto say he never saw it spelt in that way before, and to ask anxiously\r\nfor the other S), gray single-breasted frock coat, with nine gilt\r\nbuttons, and red facings on the collar and cuffs. Gray pantaloons, with\r\na broad red stripe down the outer seam. The drummers sported the most\r\ngorgeous red stomachs ever seen, between two rows of twenty little\r\nbullet buttons. The color rendered us liable to be mistaken for the\r\nrebels, it is true; but this source of anxiety to the more nervous among\r\nus was happily prevented from leading to any unfavorable results by the\r\nfatherly care displayed by poor old General Balkinsop, under whose\r\nprotection, we were sent into the field, in always keeping at least a\r\nday's march from the enemy!\r\n\r\nWhen we non-commissioned staff officers were first promoted, we felt\r\nbadly about leaving our companies; wanted to drill with them still, and\r\nso on. But this soon wore off under the pressure of new duties. For my\r\npart, I soon found that the adjutant, Lieutenant Harch, regarded it as\r\nquite a natural arrangement that the sergeant-major should attend to the\r\noffice duties, while the adjutant occupied himself exclusively with what\r\nhe was pleased to style the military part of the business; meaning\r\nthereby, guard mounting every morning and Sunday morning, inspection\r\nonce a week, making an average of, say, twenty minutes work per diem for\r\nthe adjutant, and leaving the poor sergeant-major enough to occupy and\r\nworry him for ten or eleven hours. 'Sergeant-major, publish these\r\norders,' Lieutenant Harch would say, in tones of authority exceeding in\r\nperemptory curtness anything I have ever heard since from the commander\r\nof a grand army; and then, scraping a match--my match--upon the wall, he\r\nwould begin attending to his 'military duties' by lighting a cigar--my\r\ncigar--and strolling up the avenue, on exhibition, preparatory to going\r\nhome to dine, while the fag remained driving the pen madly, kindly\r\nassisted sometimes by Quartermaster-Sergeant Oates, until long after the\r\ndinner hour of the non-commissioned staff. I think the company\r\ncommanders must sometimes have doubted (unless they carefully refrained\r\nfrom reading orders, as I have sometimes thought probable) whether the\r\nadjutant could write his name; for all our orders used to be signed:\r\n\r\n                'By order of Major JOHNSON HEAVYSTERNE:\r\n                          FREDERICK HARCH, 1st Lieutenant and Adjutant,\r\n                                   By WILLIAM JENKINS, Sergeant-Major.'\r\n\r\nNow, if the printer sets this up properly, you will see that, even at\r\nthat early day, we knew too much to adopt the sensation style of signing\r\norders which some officers have since learned from the _New York\r\nHerald_, thus:\r\n\r\n                          By command of\r\n                                Major-General BULGER!\r\n                                   WASHINGTON SMITH, A. A.-G.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was but little of that distinction of ranks which\r\nhas come to be better observed now that our volunteers have grown into\r\nan army. You see, the process of forming an army out of its constituent\r\nelement follows pretty much the fashion set by that complex machine the\r\nhuman animal: the materials go through all the processes of swallowing,\r\ndigestion, chylifaction, chymifaction, absorption, alteration, and\r\nexcretion; bone, muscle, nerve, sinew, viscera, and what not, each\r\ntaking its share, and discarding the useless material that has only\r\nserved, like bran in horse feed, to give volume and _prehensibility_ to\r\nthe mass. Our non-commissioned staff messed with the major, who was as\r\njolly a bachelor as need be, of some forty-nine years of growth, and\r\nthirty of butchering, that being his occupation. The adjutant, being\r\nnewly married to a gaunt female, who, I hope, nagged him as he us,\r\n_preferred_ to take his meals at home. Smallweed, who had somehow got\r\nmade quartermaster, couldn't go old Heavysterne, he said, and so kept as\r\nlong as he could to his desultory habits of living as a citizen and a\r\nbachelor. So our mess consisted of the major, who exercised a paternal\r\ncare over the rest of us, superintending, indeed often joining in, our\r\namusements and discussions, our quarrels and makings up; of\r\nQuartermaster-Sergeant Oates, who knew all about everything and\r\neverybody better than anybody, and was always ready to ventilate his\r\nsuperior knowledge on the slightest provocation, and who, as Smallweed,\r\nnow Lieutenant Smallweed, used to say, 'would have made a d----d elegant\r\nquartermaster-sergeant, if he hadn't had a moral objection to issuing\r\nanything;' of Chaplain Bender, a sanctified-looking individual of\r\npromiscuous theology and doubtful morals (the funny men used to speak of\r\nhim irreverently as Hell Bender); of the battalion commissary,\r\nLieutenant Fippany, an unmitigated swell; of Commissary-Sergeant Peck, a\r\nstumpy little fellow, full of facts and figures, and always quiet and\r\nready; of the writer, Sergeant-Major Jenkins, or Jinkens as my name used\r\nto be mispronounced, infinitely to my disgust; and lastly,\r\nsemi-occasionally, of the sutler, Mr. Cann. The surgeon, old Doctor\r\nPeacack, ran a separate mess, consisting of himself, the assistant\r\nsurgeon, Dr. Launcelot Cutts, and hospital steward Spatcheloe.\r\n\r\nThe drum-major, Musician Tappit, having refused to be mustered in, and\r\nthe War Department having presently refused to let us have any musicians\r\nat all, used to appear only on parades, gorgeous in his gray uniform and\r\nornamental red stomach, disappearing with exemplary regularity, and\r\ndiving into his upholsterer's cap and baize apron upon the slightest\r\nprospect of work or danger. I don't think it was ever my bad fortune to\r\neat more unpleasant meals than those eaten at our mess table. The\r\nofficers, excepting the major, but specially including the chaplain,\r\nused to insist on being helped first and excessively to everything; also\r\non inviting their friends to dine on our plates, there being no extra\r\nones; also on giving us the broken chairs, one in particular, that was\r\ncracked in a romp between the chaplain and the adjutant, and that\r\npinched you when you sat on it. Then Lieutenant Harch was always playing\r\nadjutant at the dinner table, settling discussions _ex cathedra_ in a\r\nsharp tone, and ordering his companions to help him to dishes, as thus:\r\n'Sergeant-Major, p'tatoes!' 'Oates, beef!' 'Hurry up with those beans!'\r\nTo be monosyllabic, rude to his superiors and equals, and overbearing to\r\nhis inferiors in rank, this fledgling soldier--our comrade of a few days\r\nsince, and presently the subordinate of most of us, through standing\r\nstill while we went ahead--used to think the perfection and essence of\r\nthe military system. And then that smug-faced, smooth-tongued,\r\ndirty-looking chaplain, with his second-hand shirt collars and slopshop\r\nmorality--was it whiskey or brandy that his breath smelt oftenest of? He\r\nwas the first chaplain I had seen, and I confess his rank breath, dirty\r\nlinen, and ranker and dirtier hypocrisy, gave me a disgust toward his\r\norder that it took long months and many good men to obliterate.\r\n\r\nThe best part of May we spent in drilling and idling and grumbling, and\r\nsome of us, not so hard worked as Sergeant-Major Jenkins, in the true\r\nmilitary style of conviviality, usually terminating in an abrupt entry\r\nin the orderly book, opposite the name of the follower of Bacchus,\r\n'Drunk; two extra tours guard duty;' or 'Drunk again; four extra tours\r\nknapsack drill.' Now, the knapsack drill, as practised by well-informed\r\nand duty-loving sergeants of the guard, simply consists in requiring the\r\ndelinquent to shoulder, say, for two hours in every six, a knapsack\r\nfilled with stones, blankets, or what not, until it weighs twenty,\r\nthirty, or perhaps forty pounds, according to the nature of the case and\r\nthe officer who orders the punishment.\r\n\r\nQuartermaster-Sergeant Oates and I went up, one afternoon, with\r\nLieutenant Smallweed, Corporal Bledsoe of our old company, and two or\r\nthree others, to see the famous 'Seventh' drill, out at Camp Cameron,\r\nwhich I suppose nearly everybody knows is situated about a mile and a\r\nhalf north of the President's house, on the 14th-street road, and just\r\nopposite to a one-horse affair that used to call itself 'Columbian\r\nCollege,' but which, after passing through a course of weak\r\nsemi-religio-secessionism, gradually dried up, leaving its skin to the\r\nsurgeon-general for a hospital. The afternoon we selected to visit Camp\r\nCameron turned out to be an extra occasion. General Thomas, the\r\nadjutant-general of the army, was to present a stand of colors to the\r\n'Seventh' on behalf of Mr. Secretary Cameron, on behalf of some ladies,\r\nI think. Ladies! I admire you very much, for the very many things\r\nwherein you are most admirable, but why, oh! why, in the name of the\r\nimmortals, will you, why will you present flags? Don't do it any more,\r\nplease. They are always packed up in a box and left somewhere almost as\r\nsoon as your handkerchiefs have ceased waving, your soprano hurrahs\r\nceased ringing; or else they are given to some pet officer for a\r\ncoverlet. They cost a great deal of money; they oblige the poor soldiers\r\nto endure a mort of flatulent oratory at a parade rest; and they force\r\nthe poor colonel, in a great perspiration, to stumble through a few\r\nfeeble, ineffectual, and disjointed words of thanks, which he committed\r\nto memory last night from the original, written for him by the adjutant\r\nor the young regimental poet, but of which he has forgotten almost every\r\nother word. The wise old Trojan says, speaking of the horse (I get my\r\nquotations from the newspapers, you may be sure):\r\n\r\n     'Timeo Danaos, et dona ferentes;'\r\n\r\nimplying that he is opposed to going into that speculation in wooden\r\nhorseflesh, because he fears the Greeks, even when they bring gifts.\r\nJust so, I fear the ladies, especially when they present flags. Remember\r\n_Punch's_ advice to young persons about to be married? _'Don't!'_\r\n\r\nThe Seventh, after going through the usual evening parade, and a few\r\nsimple man[oe]uvres, formed square, facing inward, with General Thomas\r\nand the oil-skin sausage that contained the new colors, and all the\r\nregimental officers, in the centre. General Thomas's feeble pipes\r\nsounded faintly enough for about half an hour, during which time no man\r\nin the ranks heard more than a dozen words. Then Colonel Lefferts\r\nresponded in a few inaudible, but no doubt very appropriate remarks.\r\nThen 'the boys,' seeing that the time had come, cheered lustily, after\r\nthe hypothetical manner of the rocket. But there was one thing we did\r\nhear, standing on tiptoe, and straining every ear. The Seventh was to go\r\nsomewhere. The crisis of the war had come. The Seventh was going to\r\nshoot at it. Their thirty days were almost out; but they were going to\r\nbe shot at, just like any of us three-months men.\r\n\r\nTo leave their canned fruits, and milk, and fresh eggs, and board\r\nfloors, and a stroll on the avenue in the afternoon, and go where glory\r\nwaited for them! Happy, happy gray-breasts! We wandered enviously round\r\nthe excited camp, and talked with our friends. Many were the rumors,\r\nappalling to us in those days, when we were yet unused to camp 'chin.'\r\nThe regiment was to go to Harper's Ferry. Johnston was there. They would\r\nhang him if they took him. They were to march straight to Richmond, One\r\nman of the 'Engineer Company' was going to resign, he said, because his\r\ncompany had to remain to guard the camp. They were to take two days'\r\nrations and forty rounds of cartridges per man--_ball_ cartridges. Forty\r\nrounds of ball cartridges and two days' work! Surely, we thought, the\r\ndays of the rebellion are numbered. And then, chewing the bitter cud of\r\nthe reflection that the war would almost certainly be ended before we\r\ngot a chance at the enemy, we wandered sadly back to our quarters,\r\nSmallweed growling horribly all the way. Our 'headquarters' we find in a\r\ngreat state of excitement. We find the orderly and Major Heavysterne\r\ndiscussing the prospects of the rebels being able to hold out a month,\r\nand Color-Sergeant Hepp and the adjutant both trying to decide the\r\ndispute. Hepp thinks they can't do without leather, and the adjutant\r\nthinks the want of salt must fetch them in a few weeks. Thinks? Decides!\r\nWhatever may be doubtful, this is certain. Everybody seems strangely\r\nexcited. We tell them our news. 'Tell us some'n do'n know!' rasps\r\nLieutenant Harch; 'our b'ttalion's goin', too; get ready, both of,\r\nquick! Smallweed, where in the h-- have you been? I've had to do all\r\nyour work.' We were to go at nine o'clock at night. It was then eight.\r\nWhither? No one knew. The chaplain comes in, with symptoms of erysipelas\r\nin his nose, and a villanous breath, to tell us, while we--the\r\nquartermaster-sergeant and I--are packing our knapsacks and leaving\r\nlines of farewell for those at home and at other people's homes, that\r\nthe major has imparted to him in confidence the awful secret that we are\r\nbound for Mount Vernon, to remove the bones of Washington. This gives us\r\nsomething terrible to think of as we march down, in quick time (a\r\nsuggestion of that adjutant, I know), to the Long Bridge, and during the\r\nlong delay there, spent by commanding officers in pottering about and\r\ngesticulating. By commanding officers? There is one there who does not\r\npotter, standing erect--that one with the little point of fire between\r\nhis fingers that marks the never-quenched cigarette--talking to Major\r\nHeavysterne in low and earnest tones, but perfectly cool and clear the\r\nwhile. That is our splendid Colonel Diamond, as brave and good a soldier\r\nas ever drew sword, as noble and true a Christian as ever endured\r\npersecution and showed patience. They are discussing a plan for crossing\r\nthe river in boats, landing at a causeway where the Alexandria road\r\ncrosses Four Mile Run, and so cutting off the impudent picket of the\r\nenemy's cavalry that holds post at the Virginia end of the Long Bridge.\r\nThe battalion commanders are evidently dazzled by the brilliancy of the\r\nmoonlight and the colonel's scheme, for it soon becomes apparent that\r\nthey haven't the pluck and dash necessary to render such an operation\r\nsuccessful. Even we young soldiers, intent upon the awful idea of\r\nresurrecting Washington's bones, and little dreaming then of becoming\r\nthe pioneers of the great invasion, could see the hitch. Presently the\r\nmajor got a definite order, and beckoning to us of the battalion staff,\r\nbegan to cross the bridge. Dusky bodies of troops, their arms glistening\r\nin the moonlight, had been silently gliding past us while the discussion\r\nprogressed. Most of them seemed to have halted on the bridge, we found\r\nas we passed on, and to have squatted down in the shade of the parapet,\r\ngassing, smoking, or napping. It was nearly midnight. We had got to the\r\nmiddle of the causeway, and found ourselves alone, bathed in silence and\r\nmoonlight and wonder, when up dashed a horseman from the direction of\r\nthe Virginia side. He stopped, and peered at us over his horse's neck.\r\n'O'Malley, is that you?' says the major, seeing it is an Irish officer\r\nbelonging to Colonel Diamond's staff. 'Yes,' says the captain, 'and who\r\nthe devil are you?' 'Major Heavysterne. Won't you please ride back and\r\nsend my battalion forward? You'll find the boys standing on the draw.\r\nCap'n Bopp, of the Fisler Guards, is the senior officer, I believe.' But\r\nthe Irishman was off, with an oath at the major's stupidity in\r\nforgetting to order his men forward. Presently the battalion came\r\ncreeping up, silently enough, I thought, but the adjutant made the\r\nexcuse of a casual 'ouch' from a man on whose heels Hrsthzschnoffski\r\nhad casually trodden, to shriek out his favorite 'Stop 'at talken'!' 'Do\r\nyou command this battalion?' asks Captain Pipes, sternly; and\r\nstraightway there would have been a dire altercation, but for the\r\nmajor's gentle interference. The bridge began to sway and roar under our\r\nsteps. We were on the draw. Clinging to the theory of Washington's\r\nbones, I peered over the draw, in the hope of seeing a steamer; there\r\nwas nothing there but the sop and swish of the tide. Perhaps we were not\r\ngoing to Mount Vernon at all! 'Halt! Who are these sleeping beauties on\r\nthe draw? Ah! these are the Bulgers. 'Say, Bulger,' I ask of one of\r\nthem, 'who's ahead of you?' 'A'n't nobody,' he replied indignantly, as\r\nwho should say, Who _can_ be ahead of the invincible Bulger Guards.\r\nNobody! Here was great news. ''_Orr'd_ H'RCH!' drones the major, in low\r\ntones; and '_Owa_'' H'MP,' sharply, ''_Orrrr_ 'RRRCH,' gruffly, repeat\r\nthe captains. On we go, breaking step to save the bridge, surprise and\r\nfluttering in our hearts. A'n't nobody ahead! Now we are on the hard\r\ndirt, the sacred soil, of the pewter State, mother of Presidents, the\r\nbirthplace of Washington, the feeding ground of hams, but otherwise the\r\nvery nursery and hive of worthlessness, humbug, sham, and superstition.\r\nVirginia, that might have been the first, and proudest, and most\r\nenlightened State in the Union, that is the last and most besodden State\r\nin or half out of it--But while my apostrophe runs on, the bit between\r\nits teeth, the head of our little column muffles its tread on the sacred\r\nsoil itself, dirtying its boots in the sacred mud, the roar of the\r\nbridge ceases, the last files and the sergeant-major run after them to\r\nclose up, in obedience to the sharp mandate of the major, and the\r\ninvasion is begun. No man spoke a word; no sound was audible save the\r\ndistant hum and cracking of the city, the cry of a thousand frogs, and\r\nthe muffled tramp of our advancing footsteps. I thought the enemy, if\r\nany were near, must surely hear the cartridges rattle in my cartridge\r\nbox as we double-quicked to close up, and I put my hand behind me to\r\nstop the clatter. If any enemy were near, indeed! There seemed an enemy\r\nbehind every bush, a rebel in every corner of the worm fence. I am in\r\nthe rear of the column, I thought, and my heart went thump, bump, and my\r\ngreat central nervous ganglion ached amain. 'Sergeant-major,' whispers\r\nMajor Heavysterne; 'Sergeant-major,' barks the adjutant. 'Fall out four\r\nfiles and keep off to the right, and about fifty paces in advance of the\r\nbattalion, and examine the ground thoroughly. Report any signs of the\r\nenemy.' The ache grew bigger, and I perspired terribly as I inquired, in\r\ntones whose tremor I hoped would be mistaken for ardor, whether any one\r\nwas ahead of us. 'No one except the enemy,' laughed the major, quietly.\r\nNo one except the enemy! Fifty paces from any one except the enemy, by\r\nmy legs, each pace a yard! 'The ground to the right is all water, and\r\nabout seven feet deep,' I reported joyfully, having ascertained the\r\nfact. 'Then go fifty yards ahead, as far to the right as you can get,\r\nand keep out of sight,' were our new orders. I thought we would keep out\r\nof sight well enough! We were going up hill--up the hill on which Fort\r\nRunyon now stands. Here is a shanty. What if it should be full of the\r\nenemy, and we but four poor frightened men, with our battalion hidden by\r\nthe turn in the road. Mechanically I cocked my rifle and opened the\r\ndoor, and strained my eyes into the darkness. Nobody. I let down the\r\nhammer again.\r\n\r\nFear had oozed out of my fingers' ends, in lifting the latch, just as\r\nvalor did from those of Bob Acres, and Jenkins was himself again. We\r\njobbed our bayonets under the lager-beer counter, to provide for the\r\ncase of any lurking foe in that quarter. Just here the road forked.\r\nSending two of us to the right, the rest kept on the Alexandria. 'Look\r\nthere,' chatters Todd second between his teeth, wafting in my face a\r\nmingled odor of fear and gin cocktails. 'Where?' 'Why there! on top of\r\nthe hill--a horse.' 'Is that a horse?' 'Yes.' 'A man on him, too!' 'Two\r\nof 'em!' Click, click, click, from our locks. We creep on and up\r\nstealthily. We are scarcely thirty yards distant from the two horsemen,\r\nwhen a man darts out from the left-hand side of the road behind us--two\r\nmen--three! We are surrounded. Todd second would have fired, but I held\r\nhim back. '_Who's that?_' I whispered; '_speak quick, or I fire!_'\r\n'Can't you see, you d--d fool,' barks out our surly adjutant, who,\r\nunknown to us, had been leading a similar scout on the opposite side of\r\nthe road. Click, click, from up the hill. The enemy are going to shoot.\r\nAn awful moment. We steady our rifles and our nerves; all trace of fear\r\nis gone; nothing remains but eagerness for the conflict that seems so\r\nnear, and with a bound, without waiting for orders, we move quickly up\r\nthe hill. Lieutenant Harch moves his men out into the road, where the\r\nbright moonlight betrays, perhaps multiplies, their number; the horsemen\r\nspring to their saddles, and are off at a clattering gallop, to alarm\r\nAlexandria. 'Don't shoot!' shrieks the adjutant; our rifles waver; the\r\nhill hides the flying picket; the chance is lost; presently all\r\nAlexandria will be awake, and a beautiful surprise frustrated. As we\r\npeer into the moonlit distance from the top of the hill now almost\r\nspaded away and trimmed up into Fort Runyon, feeling the solemnity of\r\nthe occasion impressed upon us with dramatic force by all the\r\nsurroundings--by our loneliness, by our character as the harbingers of\r\nthe advance of the armies of American freedom and American nationality,\r\nand by the recent flight of the first squad of the enemy whom we had met\r\nwith hostile purpose: as we dreamily drink in all these and many other\r\nvague ideas, up comes our battalion, and occupies the hill, the major\r\nsending off a company to hold the bridge where the road crosses the\r\ncanal and forks to Arlington and Fairfax Court House. Presently there\r\npass by us regiments from Michigan, New York, New Jersey, and it may be\r\nfrom other States which I forget. Some turn off to the right, to settle\r\non the hill which is now scooped into Fort Albany; others press forward\r\nto Alexandria, the bells of which town very soon begin to ring a\r\nfrightened peal of alarm and confusion. We move out a half mile farther\r\nand halt, our night's work being over, and other things in store; the\r\nmoonlight wanes, and grows insensibly into a chilly daylight, presently\r\nreddened by the sun of to-morrow. All this seems to us to have occupied\r\nscarcely half an hour, but it is broad day again for certain, and surely\r\nwe are a mortally tired and aching battalion as we march back listless,\r\nhot, sleepy, and gastric, over the Long Bridge, to our armory, there to\r\nfall asleep over breakfast in sheer exhaustion, and to spend the\r\nremainder of the day in a dry, hard series of naps, not the least\r\nrefreshing--such as leave you the impression of having slept in hot\r\nsand. As we--the quartermaster-sergeant and I--stroll down the avenue\r\nthat afternoon according to our wont, we hear the news of Ellsworth's\r\ndeath, of the occupation of Alexandria by our forces, and of the flight\r\nof the enemy's handful of silly, braggadocio Virginia militia, hastily\r\ncollected to brag and drink the town safe from the pollution of the vile\r\nYankee's invading foot. Ah! V'ginia; as thou art easily pleased to sing\r\nof thy sister-in-law, Ma'yland,\r\n\r\n     'The taaeirahnt's foot is awn thai sho','\r\n\r\nand will be likely to remain thar a right tollable peert length of time,\r\nI expect.\r\n\r\nNothing but bridge guarding in the festering swamp on the Virginia side\r\nof the Potomac, varied by multiplying details for extra duty as clerks\r\nin all imaginable offices, falls to our lot until the 10th of June,\r\nwhen, after a number of rumors, and many dark forebodings as to what the\r\nDistrict men would do, we are finally ordered into the field as a part\r\nof the Chickfield expedition, originally designed for the capture of\r\nDregsville, I believe; an object which may have been slightly interfered\r\nwith by its detailed announcement about a week beforehand in one of the\r\nPhiladelphia papers. The expedition consisted of the First, Third,\r\nFifth, and Ninth Battalions of District of Columbia Volunteers, the\r\nFirst New Hampshire, the Ninth New York, and the Seventeenth\r\nPennsylvania, which _would_ call itself the First. I think four other\r\nregiments from the same State did the same thing, it being a cardinal\r\nprinciple with them, perhaps, that each regiment was to claim two\r\ndifferent names and three different numbers, and that at least four\r\nother regiments were fiercely to dispute with it each name and each\r\nnumber: for example, there was the\r\n\r\n  First Pennsylvania Artillery,           }\r\n  calling itself the...                   }\r\n                                          }\r\n  First Pennsylvania Militia, Infantry,   } First\r\n  calling itself the...                   } Pennsylvania\r\n                                          } Regiment.\r\n  First Pennsylvania Volunteers, Infantry,}\r\n  calling itself the...                   }\r\n                                          }\r\n  First Pennsylvania Volunteers, Infantry,}\r\n  calling itself, and called by           }\r\n  the Governor, the...                    }\r\n\r\nAnd for another example there was a regiment which called itself the\r\n'Swishtail Carbines,' after a beastly ornament in the hats of its men;\r\nthe 'Shine Musketoons,' after their lieutenant-colonel; the '289th\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers,' after the State series of numbers, which began\r\nwith 280 or thereabout; and the 'First Regiment of the Pennsylvania\r\nVolunteer Reserve Corps, Breech-Loading Carbineers,' and doubtless by\r\nother names, though I don't remember them.\r\n\r\nBesides this tremendous host--we had never seen so large a force\r\ntogether, and thought it the most invincible of armadas--we had a\r\nbattery of artillery, composed of three or four different kinds of guns,\r\nas the fashion was in the good old days of our company posts, wherefrom\r\nwe were just emerging in a chrysalis state, and also two companies of\r\ncavalry; one a real live company of regulars, commanded by Captain\r\nCautle, of the Third Dragoons, the other led by Captain (he called\r\nhimself major, and his company a battalion) Cutts, formerly and since an\r\nenterprising member of the firm of Cutts & Dunn, who made my uniform,\r\nand who will make your clothes, if you wish, my dear reader, and charge\r\nyou rather less than three times their value, after the manner of\r\nWashington tailors; which charge will appear especially moderate when\r\nyou remember that the clothes will almost fit, and won't wear out so\r\nvery soon after all, as is the way with Washington clothes. Indeed, as\r\nthe tactics say, 'this remark is general for all the deployments;' and\r\nthe same may as well be said of all bills and things made in the great\r\ncity of sheds, contractors, politicians, dust, and unfinished buildings.\r\nBut is this a description of Washington? We are at Chickfield, where the\r\nloyal Maryland farmers come to us to protect their loyalty, to charge a\r\ndollar a panel for old worm fences thrown down by 'the boys,' to sell\r\nforage at double prices, to reclaim runaway negroes, and to assure us of\r\nthe impossibility of subjugating the South. And here, in the peaceful\r\nvillage of Chickfield, the object of our expedition having been happily\r\nfrustrated by the newspapers, we enjoy our ease for a week or ten days,\r\nand our first camp experiences. Oh! that first experience of unboxing\r\ntents smelling loudly as of candle grease, of finding the right poles,\r\nof vainly endeavoring to pitch them straight, of hot and excited\r\nofficers rushing hither and thither in a flurry, trying to instruct the\r\ndifferent squads in their work, and straightway frustrated by the thick\r\nheads, or worse, by the inevitable suggestions of those remarkably\r\nintelligent corporals, who seem to consider themselves as having a\r\nspecial mission direct from heaven to know everything except how to do\r\nwhat they are bid. And oh! the first camp cookery, when everything is\r\noverdone except what is underdone; when the soup is water, and the\r\ncoffee grounds, and the tea (we had tea in the _three_-months!) senna!\r\nAnd after a day of worry, hurry, confusion, and awful cooking, the first\r\nrough sleep, with a root running across your ribs, and a sizable gravel\r\nindenting the small of your back! How the teamsters talk all night, and\r\nthe sentinels call wildly, incessantly, for the corporal of the guard!\r\nHow you dream of being hung on a wire, as if to dry, with your head on a\r\njagged rock; of an army of sentinels pacing your breast, ceaselessly\r\nengaged in coming to an 'order arms;' of millions of ants crawling over\r\nand through you; of having your legs suddenly thrust into an icehouse,\r\nand a brush fire built under your head; of black darkness, in which you\r\nfall down, down, down, down--faster, faster, faster!--till crash! you\r\nbump against something, and split wide open with a thundering roar,\r\nwhich gradually expands into the sound of a bugle as you awake to\r\nrenewed misery, and are, as Mr. Sawin says, 'once more routed out of bed\r\nby that derned reveille.'\r\n\r\nPresently there comes an order for us to march to Billsburg, and there\r\njoin the army of the Musconetcong, commanded by that dauntless hero,\r\nMajor-General Robert Balkinsop. Of course we march in a hurry, as much\r\nas possible by night, 'without baggage,' as the orders say--meaning with\r\nonly _two_ wagons to a company. The other battalions of D.C. Vols. stay\r\nbehind and loaf back to Washington, there to be mislaid by Major-General\r\nBlankhed, who is so preoccupied with issuing and affixing his sign\r\nmanual to passes for milk, eggs, and secessionists, to cross and recross\r\nLong Bridge, that the war must wait for him or go ahead without him. We\r\ngo on to glory, as we suppose (deluded _three_-months!), and march\r\nexcitedly, with all our legs, fearing we shall be too late. As we near\r\nBillsburg, we can hear the since familiar _tick--tack_, _pip--pop--pop_\r\nof a rattling skirmish, and the _vroom--vroom_ of volley firing.\r\nAnxiously, eagerly--no need for the colonel to cry 'Step out\r\nlively!'--we press forward, with all the ardor of recruits. Recruits!\r\nHadn't we been a month in service, and been through one great invasion\r\nalready? There they are! See the smoke? Where? On top of that hill!\r\nHalt! Our battalion deploys as skirmishers with a useless cheer. We\r\nclose up. We load with ball cartridge, and most of us, on our individual\r\nresponsibility, fix bayonets; it looks so determined--nothing like the\r\ncold steel, we think. Slowly, resolutely, we advance. An aid comes\r\ngalloping back. We crowd round him. The colonel looks disgustedly\r\nhandsome. What does he say? Pshaw! It's only the 284th Pennsylvania,\r\npart of General Balkinsop's body guard, discharging muskets after rain.\r\nOnly three soldiers, a negro, a couple of mules, and an old woman, have\r\nbeen hurt so far, and 'the boys' will be through in an hour or so more!\r\n\r\nWell, as we were sent for in a hurry, of course we waited a week. How\r\nGeneral Balkinsop man[oe]uvred the great army of the Musconetcong; what\r\nfatherly, nay, grandmotherly care he took to keep us out of danger; how\r\ncautiously he spread, his nets for the enemy, and how rapidly he left\r\nthem miles behind; how we killed nothing but chickens, wounded nothing\r\nbut our own silly pride, and captured nothing but green apples and\r\nroasting ears; all this, and more, let history tell. The poor old\r\ngeneral kept us safe, at all events; and if the enemy, with half our\r\nnumbers, was left unharmed, and allowed quietly and leisurely to move\r\noff and swell his force elsewhere, and so whip us in detail, what of it?\r\nDidn't we save our wagon train? And isn't that, as everyone knows, the\r\nhighest result of strategy?\r\n\r\nAnd then came the battle (the _battle!_) of Bull Run, with its first\r\nglowing, crowing accounts of victory, and its later story of humiliation\r\nand shame! Ah! let me shut up the page! My heart grows sick over this\r\nmangy, scrofulous period of our national disease; give me air!\r\n\r\nLuckily for me, I had a raging fever just after that awful 21st of July,\r\n1861. When I awoke from my delirium, and had got as far as tea, toast,\r\nand the door of the hospital, they told me of the great uprising of the\r\npeople, of General McClellan's appointment to command the Army of the\r\nPotomac, of how 'our boys' had reenlisted for the war, and of how I, no\r\nlonger Sergeant-Major William Jenkins, was to be adjutant of the\r\nregiment, and might now take off my _chevrons_, and put on my SHOULDER\r\nSTRAPS.\r\n\r\n_She_ sent them to me in a letter. Wait a month, and I'll tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST FANATIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Noah hewed the timber\r\n    Wherewith to build the ark,\r\n  Outside the woods one shouted--\r\n    'That wild fanatic!--_hark!_'\r\n\r\n  And when he drew the beams\r\n    And laid them on the plain,\r\n  One said,'He has no balance,\r\n    He surely is insane.'\r\n\r\n  And when he raised the frame,\r\n    One clear, sunshiny day,\r\n  'Poor fool of _one idea_,'\r\n    A smiling man did say.\r\n\r\n  When he foretold the flood,\r\n    And stood repentance teaching,\r\n  They sneered, 'You radical,\r\n    We'll hear no ultra preaching!'\r\n\r\n  And when he drove the beasts and birds\r\n    Into the ark one morn,\r\n  They shouted, 'Odd enthusiast!'\r\n    And laughed with ringing scorn.\r\n\r\n  When he and all his house went in,\r\n    They gazed, and said, 'Erratic!'\r\n  'A pleasant voyage to you, Noah!\r\n    You canting, queer fanatic!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF AMERICAN LIFE AND SCENERY.\r\n\r\nV.--THE ADIRONDACS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interesting mountain region embraces the triangular plateau lying\r\nbetween Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence, Lake Ontario and the\r\nMohawk. The name was formerly restricted to the central group containing\r\nthe highest peaks, but is now applied to the various ranges traversing\r\nthe northeastern counties of the State of New York. The loftiest points\r\nare found in the County of Essex and the neighboring corners of\r\nFranklin; but the surfaces of Clinton, St. Lawrence, Herkimer, Hamilton,\r\nWarren, and Washington are all diversified by the various branches of\r\nthe same mountain system. The principal ranges have a general\r\nnortheasterly and southwesterly direction, and are about six in number.\r\nThey run nearly parallel with one another, and with the watercourses\r\nflowing into Lake Champlain, namely, Lake George and Putnam's Creek, the\r\nBoquet, Au Sable, and Saranac Rivers. Recent surveys made by, or under\r\nthe direction of, Professor A. Guyot, will doubtless furnish us with\r\nmore accurate information regarding ranges and measurements of heights\r\nthan any we can now refer to. So far as we have been able to learn from\r\nthe best authorities within our reach,[2] the situation and names of the\r\nmost prominent ranges are as follows: The most southerly is that known\r\nas the Palmertown or Luzerne Mountains, and embraces the highlands of\r\nLake George, terminating at Mount Defiance, on Lake Champlain. This\r\nrange has also been called Black Mountain range and Tongue Mountains.\r\nThe second range, the Kayaderosseras, ends in the high cliff overlooking\r\nBulwagga Bay. The third, or Schroon range, terminates on Lake Champlain\r\nin the high promontory of Split Rock. It borders Schroon Lake, and its\r\nhighest peak is Mount Pharaoh, nearly 4,000 feet above tidewater. The\r\nfourth, or Boquet range, finds its terminus at Perou Bay, and contains\r\nDix Peak (5,200 feet), Nipple Top (4,900 feet), Raven Hill, and Mount\r\nDiscovery. The fifth or Adirondac range (known also as Clinton or Au\r\nSable) meets Lake Champlain in the rocks of Trembleau Point, and\r\nembraces the highest peaks of the system, namely, Mount Tahawus (Marcy),\r\n5,379 feet, and Mounts Mc-Intire, McMartin, and San-da-no-na, all above\r\n5,000 feet in elevation. The series nest succeeding on the northwest,\r\ndoes not consist of a single distinguishable range, but of a\r\ncontinuation of groups which may be considered as a sixth range, under\r\nthe name of Chateaugay or Au Sable. Its highest points are Mount Seward\r\n(5,100 feet), and Whiteface, nearly 5,000 feet in height. We have also\r\nseen noticed as distinguishable a ridge still exterior to the last\r\nmentioned, as Chateaugay, _i.e._, the range of the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: NEW YORK SATE GAZETTEER.]\r\n\r\nThe above-named ranges are not always clearly defined, as cross spurs or\r\nsingle mountains sometimes occupy the entire space between two ridges,\r\nreducing the customary valley to a mere ravine. The usual uncertainty\r\nand redundancy of nomenclature common to mountain regions, adds to the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining or conveying clear ideas of the local\r\ndistribution of elevation and depression. On the northern slope, the\r\nthree rivers, Boquet, Au Sable (with two branches, East and West), and\r\nSaranac, furnish to the traveller excellent guides for the arrangement\r\nof his conceptions, regarding the general face of the country. To the\r\nsouth, the same office is performed by the various branching headwaters\r\nof the Hudson.\r\n\r\nThese mountains are granitic, and the river bottoms have a light, sandy\r\nsoil. The Au Sable well deserves its name, not only from the bar at its\r\nmouth, but also from the sand fields through which it chiefly flows.\r\nSteep, bare peaks, wild ravines, and stupendous precipices characterize\r\nthe loftier ranges. The waterfalls are numerous and beautiful, and the\r\nlakes lovely beyond description. More than one hundred in number, they\r\ncluster round the higher groups of peaks, strings of glittering gems\r\nabout the stately forms of these proud, dark-browed, Indian\r\nbeauties--mirrors wherein they may gaze upon the softened outlines of\r\ntheir haughty heads, their wind-tossed raiment of spruce fir, pines, and\r\nbirch.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest valleys the oak and chestnut are abundant, but as we leave\r\nthe shores of Lake Champlain and ascend toward the west, the beech and\r\nbasswood, butternut, elm, ash, and maple, hemlock and arbor vitae,\r\ntamarack, white, black, and yellow pines, white and black birch,\r\ngradually disappear, until finally the forest growth of the higher\r\nportions of the loftier summits is composed almost exclusively of the\r\nvarious species of spruce or fir. The tamarack sometimes covers vast\r\nplains, and, with the long moss waving from its sombre branches, looks\r\nmelancholy enough to be fancied a mourner over the ring of the axe\r\nfelling noble pines, the crack of the rifle threatening extermination to\r\nthe deer once so numerous, or the cautious tread of the fisherman under\r\nwhose wasteful rapacity the trout are gradually disappearing. We have\r\nreason to be thankful that all are not yet gone--that some splendid\r\nspecimens are left to tell the glorious tale of the primeval forest,\r\nthat on the more secluded lake shores an occasional deer may yet be seen\r\ncoming down to drink, and that in the shadier pools the wary and\r\nsagacious prince of fishes still disports himself and cleaves the\r\ncrystal water with his jewelled wedge.\r\n\r\nBerries of all sorts spring up on the cleared spots; the wide-spreading\r\njuniper, with its great prickly disks, covers the barer slopes; the\r\nwillow herb, wild rose, clematis, violet, golden rod, aster, immortelle,\r\narbutus, harebell, orchis, linnaea borealis, mitchella, dalibarda,\r\nwintergreen, ferns innumerable, and four species of running pine, all in\r\ndue season, deck the waysides and forest depths.\r\n\r\nThe climate is intensely cold in winter, and in the summer cool upon the\r\nheights, but in the narrow sandy valleys the long days of June, July,\r\nand August are sometimes uncomfortably hot. The nights, however, are\r\nordinarily cool. Going west through the middle of the region, from\r\nWestport to Saranac, a difference of several weeks in the progress of\r\nvegetation is perceptible. Long after the linnaea had ceased to bloom at\r\nElizabethtown, we found its tender, fragrant, pink bells flushing a\r\nwooded bank near Lake Placid. Good grass grows upon the hillsides, and\r\nin the valleys are found excellent potatoes, oats, peas, beans, and\r\nbuckwheat. The corn is small, but seems prolific, and occasional fields\r\nof flax, rye, barley, and even wheat, present a flourishing appearance.\r\nLumber, charcoal, and iron ore of an excellent quality are, however, the\r\npresent staples of this mountain region. Bears and panthers are found in\r\nsome secluded localities, and the farmer still dreads the latter for his\r\nsheep. The wolves are said to kill more deer than the hunters. The otter\r\nand beaver are found among the watercourses, and the mink or sable is\r\nstill the prey of the trapper. The horses are ordinarily of a small\r\nbreed, but very strong and enduring.\r\n\r\nThe men are chiefly of the Vermont type, most of the original settlers\r\nhaving come from the neighboring State. The school house, court house,\r\nchurch, and town hall are hence regarded as among the necessary\r\nelements of life to the well-ordered citizen. Honest dealing, thrift,\r\nand cleanliness are the rule, and the farm houses are comfortable and\r\nwell cared for. The men look intelligent, and the women are handsome,\r\nalthough, indeed, too many pale or sallow complexions give evidence of\r\nsedentary habits, and of the almost universal use of _saleratus_ and hot\r\nbread [??]. The families of many farmers far in among the mountains\r\nrarely taste fresh meat, but subsist chiefly upon salt pork, fish, fresh\r\nor salted, as the season will permit, potatoes, wheat, rye, and Indian\r\nmeal, with berries, dried apples, perhaps a few garden vegetables,\r\nplenty of good milk, and excellent butter. Eggs, chickens, and veal are\r\nluxuries occasionally to be enjoyed, and, should one of the family be a\r\ngood shot, venison and partridge may appear upon the bill of fare.\r\nBright flowers ornament the gardens, and gay creepers embower doors and\r\nwindows. Along the more secluded roads are the log cabins of the\r\ncharcoal burners, said cabins containing, if apparently nothing else,\r\ntwo or three healthy, chubby, pretty children, and a substantial cooking\r\nstove, of elaborate pattern, recently patented by some enterprising\r\ncompatriot.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable features of these mountains are the 'Passes,'\r\nanswering to Gaps, Notches, and Cloves in other parts of the Union. They\r\nafford means for excellent roads from end to end of the mountain region,\r\nand are, in addition, eminently picturesque. The two most noteworthy are\r\nthe Indian and Wilmington Passes; the first too rugged for the present\r\nto admit of a road; and the latter containing the beautiful Wilmington\r\nFall. Many of the mountains have been burned over, and the bare,\r\ngaunt-limbed timber, and contorted folds of gray, glittering rock,\r\nafford a spectral contrast to the gentler contours of hills still clad\r\nin their natural verdure, bright or dark as deciduous or evergreen trees\r\npreponderate. The variety of form is endless; long ridges, high peaks,\r\nsharp or blunt, sudden clefts, great bare slides, flowing curves, convex\r\nor concave, serrated slopes crowned with dark spruce or jagged as the\r\nnaked vertebrae of some enormous antediluvian monster, stimulate the\r\ncuriosity and excite the imagination of the beholder. There is an\r\nessential difference in the character of the views obtained, whether\r\nlooking from the south, or the east. In the former case, the eye,\r\nfollowing the axes of the ranges, sees the mountains as a cross ridge of\r\nelevated peaks; and in the latter, where the sight strikes the ranges\r\nperpendicularly to their axes, one, or, at most, two ridges are all that\r\ncan be seen from any single point.\r\n\r\nThis region may be approached from Lake Champlain by way of Ticonderoga,\r\nCrown Point, Port Henry, Westport, and Port Kent, the two latter places\r\nbeing the nearer to the higher peaks; or from the lake country in\r\nHamilton County, by way of Racket and Long Lakes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe night boat for Albany, June 27th, 1864, was crowded with passengers\r\nfleeing from pavements, summer heats, and stifling city air, to green\r\nfields, cool shadows of wooded glens, or life-giving breezes from\r\nmountain heights. True, there were some who, like Aunt Sarah Grundy,\r\nbitterly lamented the ample rooms and choice fare of their own\r\nestablishments, and whose idea of a 'summer in the country' was limited\r\nto a couple of months at Saratoga or Newport, with a fresh toilette for\r\neach succeeding day; but even these knew that there were at both places\r\ngreen trees, limpid waters, whether of lake or ocean, and a wide horizon\r\nwherein to see sunsets, moonrises, and starlight. Aunt Sarah went to\r\nNewport; she found there fewer of such persons as she was pleased to\r\ndesignate as 'rabble,' and the soft, warm fogs were exactly the summer\r\natmosphere for a complexion too delicate to be exposed to the fervent\r\nblaze of a July sun.\r\n\r\nBut the majority were not of Aunt Sarah's stamp. They were men, wearied\r\nwith nine months' steady work, eager for country sports, for the freedom\r\nof God's own workhouse, where labor and bad air and cramped positions\r\nneed not be synonymous; or women, glad to escape the routine of\r\nhousekeeping, the daily contest with Bridget or Katrine, with Jean,\r\nWilliams, or Priscilla. There were young girls, with round hats and\r\nthick boots, anxious to substitute grassy lanes or rocky hillsides for\r\nthe flagstones of avenues; lads, to whom climbing of fruit trees and\r\nrowing boats were pleasant reminiscences of some foregone year; and\r\nfinally, children, who longed for change, and whose little frames needed\r\nall the oxygen and exercise their anxious parents could procure for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuch, doubtless, was a large portion of the precious freight of our\r\n'floating palace,' whose magnificence proved to us rather of the\r\nDead-Sea-apple sort, as we had arrived upon the scene of action too late\r\nto procure comfortable quarters for the night, and, in addition, soon\r\nafter daybreak found ourselves aground within sight of Albany, and with\r\nno prospect of release until after the departure of the train for\r\nWhitehall. At a few moments past seven, we heard the final whistle, and\r\nknew that our journey's end was now postponed some four and twenty\r\nhours. We afterward learned that by taking the boat to Troy we would\r\nhave run less risk of delay, as the Whitehall and Rutland train usually\r\nawaits the arrival of said boat. At nine o'clock we reached Albany, and\r\none of our number spent a dreary day, battling with headache and the\r\nennui of a little four year old, who could extract no amusement from the\r\nunsuggestive walls of a hotel parlor. About five in the afternoon we\r\nleft for Whitehall, where we purposed passing the night. This movement\r\ndid not one whit expedite the completion of our journey, but offered a\r\nchange of place, and an additional hour of rest in the morning, as the\r\nlake-boat train from Whitehall was the same that left Albany shortly\r\nafter seven.\r\n\r\nWe found Whitehall a homely little town, in a picturesque situation, on\r\nthe side of a steep hill, past which winds the canal, and under which\r\nthundered the train that on the following morning bore us to the lake,\r\nwhere the pleasant steamboat 'United States' awaited her daily cargo.\r\nThe upper portion of Lake Champlain is very narrow, and the channel\r\ndevious; the shores are sometimes marshy, sometimes rocky, and the\r\nbordering hills have softly swelling outlines. Our day was hazy, and the\r\nGreen Mountains of Vermont seemed floating in some species of celestial\r\natmosphere suddenly descended upon that fair State. We passed the\r\nNarrows (a singular, rocky cleft, through which flows the lake), and\r\nsoon after came to Ticonderoga, with its ruined fort and environing\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Crown Point, the lake becomes much wider, and at Port\r\nHenry spreads out into a noble expanse of water. Behind Port Henry, the\r\nAdirondac peaks already begin to form a towering background. Westport,\r\nhowever, has a still more beautiful situation. The lake there is very\r\nbroad, the sloping shores are wooded, the highest peaks of the Green\r\nMountains are visible to the east and northeast, and the Adirondacs\r\nrise, tier after tier, toward the west.\r\n\r\nOn the boat were wounded soldiers going to their homes. Poor fellows!\r\nThey had left their ploughs and their native hills, to find wounds and\r\nfevers in Virginia. When one looked upon the tranquil lake and\r\nhalo-crowned mountains, it seemed almost impossible that the passions of\r\nevil men should have power to draw even that placid region into the\r\nvortex, and hurl back its denizens scarred and scathed, to suffer amid\r\nits beauty. And yet were these men the very marrow and kernel of the\r\nlandscape, the defenders of the soil, the patriots who were willing to\r\ngive themselves that their country might remain one and undivided, that\r\nthe 'home of the brave' might indeed be the 'land of the free.'\r\n\r\nAt Westport we left the boat, and found the stage to Elizabethtown, a\r\n_buckboard_, already crowded with passengers. An inn close at hand\r\nfurnished us the only covered wagon we chanced to see during our ten\r\nweeks' sojourn among the Adirondacs. The drive to Elizabethtown (eight\r\nmiles) was hot and dusty, for we faced the western sun, and the long\r\nsummer drought was just then commencing to make itself felt.\r\nNevertheless, there was beauty enough by the wayside to make one forget\r\nsuch minor physical annoyances. As the road rose over the first hills,\r\nthe views back, over the lake and toward those hazy, dreamy-looking\r\nVermont mountains, seemed a leaf from some ancient romance, wherein\r\nfaultless knights errant sought peerless lady loves with golden locks\r\nflowing to their tiny feet, and the dragons were all on the outside,\r\ndwellers in dark caverns and noisome dens. In our day, I fear, we have\r\nnot improved the matter, for the dark caverns seem to have passed\r\nwithin, and the dragons have been adopted as familiars.\r\n\r\nBy and by, on some arid spots, appeared the low, spreading juniper,\r\nwhich we had previously known only as the garden pet of an enthusiastic\r\ntree fancier. And thus, perhaps, the virtues which here we cultivate by\r\nunceasing care and watchfulness, will, when we are translated to some\r\nwider sphere, nearer to the Creator of all, burst upon us as simple,\r\nnatural gifts to the higher and freer intelligences native to that\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nRaven Hill is the highest point between Westport and Elizabethtown. It\r\nis a beautifully formed conical hill, rising some twenty-one hundred\r\nfeet above the sea level, and contributing the cliffs on the northern\r\nside of the 'Pass,' through which leads the road into the valley of the\r\nBoquet, that vale known formerly as the 'The Pleasant Valley,' in which\r\nwas Betseytown, now dignified into Elizabethtown. Does an increase in\r\ncivilization and refinement indeed destroy familiarity, render us more\r\nstrange one to another, even, through much complexity, to our own\r\nselves? The southern side of the Pass is formed by the slope of the\r\n'Green Mountain,' once so called from its beautiful verdure, now, alas!\r\nburnt over, bristling with dead trees and bare rocks, and green only by\r\nreason of weeds, brambles, and a bushy growth of saplings. The view,\r\ndescending from the summit of the Pass into the Pleasant Valley, is\r\ncharming. The Boquet runs through green meadows and cultivated fields,\r\nwhile round it rise lofty mountains--the 'Giant of the Valley' (alias\r\n'Great Dome' or 'Bald Peak'), being especially remarkable, with its\r\nsummits, green or bare, round or peaked, glittering with white scars of\r\nancient slides. To the west lies the Keene Pass, a steep, rocky gateway\r\nto the Au Sable River and the wonders beyond. This view of the descent\r\ninto the Pleasant Valley is even more striking from a road passing over\r\nthe hills some five miles south of Elizabethtown. The vale is narrower,\r\nthe point of view higher, and the opposite mountains nearer and more\r\nlofty. The Giant of the Valley rises directly in the west, and Dix's\r\nPeak closes the vista to the south. On a semi-hazy afternoon, with the\r\nsunlight streaming through in broad pathways of quivering glory, it\r\nwould be difficult to imagine a more enchanting scene.\r\n\r\nThere are in Elizabethtown two inns,[3] one down by the stream, a branch\r\nof the Boquet, and the other up on the 'Plain,' near the court house.\r\nThe latter has decidedly the advantage in situation. Both are owned by\r\nthe same landlord, and are well kept. We arrived in the midst of court\r\nweek, and found every place filled with lawyers, clients, witnesses, and\r\neven, behind the bars of the brick jail, we could see the prisoners,\r\nmore fortunate than their city compeers, in that they breathed pure air,\r\nand could look out upon the everlasting hills, solemn preachers of the\r\nmight and the rights, as well as the mercy of their Creator.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: During the past season, the Mansion House, on the Plain,\r\nwas not opened until near the close Of the summer. We understand it is\r\nto be henceforth a permanent 'institution.']\r\n\r\nFrom two to three miles from the Valley House is the top of Raven Hill,\r\nseemingly a watchtower on the outskirts of the citadel of the\r\nAdirondacs. The ascent is easy, and the view panoramic, embracing Lake\r\nChamplain and the Green Mountains, Burlington and Westport, the bare,\r\ncraggy hills to the north, the higher ranges to the west, with the\r\nabrupt precipices of the 'Keene Pass' and the lofty 'Dome' and 'Bald\r\nMountain,' Dix's Peak to the south, a clear lake known as 'Black Pond'\r\namong the hills toward Moriah, and at the base the Pleasant Valley with\r\nthe winding Boquet River.\r\n\r\nNear the lower hotel is Wood Mountain, about half as high as Raven Hill,\r\nand offering a view somewhat similar, although of course not so\r\nextended. The distance to the top is but little over a mile, and the\r\npathway, although somewhat steep, is very good.\r\n\r\nA visit to the iron mines and works at Moriah can readily be made from\r\nElizabethtown. The distance is from twelve to fourteen miles. One of the\r\nmines is quite picturesque, being cut into the solid rock, under a roof\r\nsupported by great columns of the valuable ore. The workmen, with their\r\npicks and barrows, passing to and fro, as seen from the top of the\r\nexcavation, look like German pictures of tiny gnomes and elves delving\r\nfor precious minerals. The yield from the ore is about eighty per cent.,\r\nand of very superior quality. The return road passes down the hill,\r\nwhence is the splendid view of the 'Valley' before mentioned.\r\n\r\nA delightful excursion can also be made to 'Split Rock,' about nine\r\nmiles up the valley of the Boquet. The little river there, in two\r\nseparate falls, makes its way through a rocky cleft. The basins of the\r\nupper, and the singularly winding chasm of the lower fall, are\r\nespecially worthy of observation. At Split Rock we first made any\r\nextensive acquaintance with a costume which threatens to be immensely\r\npopular among the Adirondacs, namely, the _Bloomer_, and in the agility\r\ndisplayed by some of its fair wearers we beheld the results likely to\r\nspring from its adoption as a mountain walking dress. Our private\r\nobservation was, that moderately full, short skirts, without hoop of\r\ncourse, terminating a little distance above the ankle, and worn with\r\nclocked or striped woollen stockings, were more graceful than a somewhat\r\nshorter and scantier skirt, with the pantalette extending down to the\r\nfoot. The former seems really _a la paysanne_, while the latter, in\r\naddition to some want of grace, suggests _Bloomer_, and the many\r\nabsurdities which have been connected with that name. It is a great pity\r\nthat a sensible and healthful change in walking attire should have been\r\ncaricatured by its own advocates, and thus rendered too conspicuous to\r\nbe agreeable to many who would otherwise have adopted it in some\r\nmodified and reasonable form.\r\n\r\nNear New Russia, about five miles from Elizabethtown, is a brook\r\nflowing among moss-covered stones and rocks, overhung by giant trees of\r\nthe original forest; and just out of Elizabethtown is a glen, through\r\nwhich pours a pretty stream, making pleasant little cascades under the\r\nshadow of a less aged wood, and within a bordering of beautiful ferns,\r\nrunning pines, and bright forest blossoms. We should also not neglect to\r\nmention Cobble Hill, a bold pile of rocks, rising directly out of the\r\nplain on which a portion of the town is situated.\r\n\r\nBut we had heard of the 'Walled Rocks of the Au Sable,' and Elsie and I\r\ncould not rest until our own eyes had witnessed that they were worthy of\r\ntheir reputation. We left Elizabethtown at half past six in the morning,\r\nour team a fast pair of ponies, belonging to our landlord. The previous\r\ndays had been warm and obstinately hazy, but for that especial occasion\r\nthe atmosphere cooled and cleared, and lent us some fine views back\r\ntoward the Giant of the Valley and the Keene Pass. The first ten miles\r\nof road were excellent. We then crossed a little stream known as Trout\r\nBrook, a tributary of the Boquet, and, by a somewhat rough and stony\r\nway, began to ascend the high land separating the Boquet from the Au\r\nSable. This ridge includes the 'Poke a Moonshine' Mountain, a rude pile\r\nof rocks, burnt over, and with perpendicular precipices of some three or\r\nfour hundred feet, facing the road which winds along the bottom of the\r\ndeclivity. This cleft thus becomes another 'Pass,' and, with the huge\r\nrocks fallen at its base, offers a wild and rather dreary scene. To the\r\nnorth, near the foot of the mountain, are two ponds, Butternut and\r\nAuger, which wind fantastically in and out among the hills. As we\r\ndescended the ridge, we looked toward Canada, far away over rolling\r\nplains and hillocks, and soon after reached the sandy stretch of the\r\nbasin of the Au Sable, in the midst of which is Keeneville, twenty-two\r\nmiles from Elizabethtown.\r\n\r\nBy the wayside we passed a solitary grave, the mound and headstone in a\r\npatch of corn and potatoes. Was the unknown occupant some dear one whom\r\nthe dwellers in the humble cabin near by were unwilling to send far away\r\nfrom daily remembrance, or were they too poor to seek the shelter of the\r\ncommon graveyard, or, again, had the buriers of that dead one followed\r\nto the 'land of promise,' or departed to some other far country, leaving\r\nthis grave to the care or rather carelessness of stranger hands, and did\r\nthe snowy headstone recall no memory of past love to the laborer who\r\nploughed his furrow near that mound, or to the children who played\r\naround it?\r\n\r\nAh! thus, not only in the mystical caverns of beauty, poetry, and\r\nromance are hidden the graves of buried hopes, but even amid the corn\r\nand potatoes of daily life rise the ghostly head and foot stones of\r\naspirations dead and put away out of sight, dead in the body, in daily\r\nact, but living yet in spirit, and influencing the commonplace facts to\r\nwhich they have yielded the field, permeating the everyday routine with\r\nthe ennobling power of lofty desires, and keeping the wayworn traveller\r\nfrom sinking into the slough of materialism or the quicksands of utter\r\nweariness. The man who in his youth dreamed of elevating his kind by a\r\nnoble employment of the gifts of genius, may find that genius apparently\r\nuseless, a hindrance even to prosperity, but he can nevertheless sow\r\nalong his way seeds of beauty not lost upon the thinking beings about\r\nhim, and bearing fruit perhaps in some future generation. The woman\r\nwhose reveries have pictured her a Joan of Arc, leading her country's\r\narmies to victory, and finally yielding her life in the good cause, may\r\nsew for sanitary commissions, and, nursing in some hospital, dropping\r\nmedicines, making soups and teas, die of some deadly fever, a willing\r\nsacrifice to her country.\r\n\r\nLater in the day we saw the corn and potatoes growing up to the very\r\nverge of an exquisite waterfall, reckless strength and glorious poetry\r\nside by side with patient utility and humble prose. This union seemed\r\nnot strange and unnatural, as did that of the solitary grave with the\r\nactive labor of supplying the living with daily food, the grave the more\r\nlonely that the living with their material wants encircled it so\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nKeeseville is a manufacturing town, situated upon the Au Sable, which\r\nhere breaks through a layer of Potsdam sandstone, and presents a series\r\nof most interesting and wonderful falls and chasms. About a mile below\r\nthe village is the first fall of eighty feet. The river has here a large\r\nbody of water, and falls in fan shape over a rapid descent of steps. It\r\ntakes a sharp turn, so that without crossing the stream, a fine view can\r\nbe obtained of the dancing, glittering sheet of foam. About half a mile\r\nbelow is Birmingham, another manufacturing town, which has done its\r\nbest, but without entire success, to destroy the beauty of the second\r\nfall, immediately below the bridge, said bridge being erected upon\r\nnatural piers at the sides and in the centre of the stream.\r\n\r\nHere begins a chasm which continues for the distance of about a mile and\r\na half. Wonderfully grand are these Walled Rocks of the Au Sable,\r\nthrough, which rushes the river, pent up between literally perpendicular\r\nwalls, a hundred or more feet in height, and from eleven to sixty or\r\neighty feet apart, generally from twelve to fourteen. The water\r\nsometimes rushes smoothly and deeply below, and sometimes falls over\r\nobstructions, roaring, and tumbling, and foaming. The turns in the river\r\nare very sudden, and there are great cracks and gullies extending from\r\ntop to base, pillars of rock standing alone or leaning against their\r\ncompanions. Occasionally, looking down one of these clefts, one sees\r\nnothing but the rock walls with a foaming, rapid rushing below. At one\r\nof these most remarkable points, a rude stairway has been constructed,\r\nby which the traveller can descend to the bottom, and, standing by the\r\nwater's edge, look up to the top of this singular chasm. The walls\r\nfinally lower, and the river flows out into a broad basin, whence it ere\r\nlong finds its way into Lake Champlain. The banks are wooded with pines,\r\nhemlocks, spruce, arbor vitaae, beech, birch, and basswood, and the\r\nground is covered with ferns, harebells, arbutus, linnaea, mitchella,\r\nblue lobelia, and other wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent inn, the Adirondac House, in Keeseville. Our\r\nattentive host told us of Professor Agassiz, and the fiery nature of his\r\nspeculations regarding the probable history of the sandstone, whose\r\nstrata, laid as at Trenton Falls, horizontally, layer above layer, add\r\nsuch interest and beauty to the stupendous walls, with their unseen,\r\nwater-covered depths below, and their graceful wreaths of arbor vittae\r\nnodding and swaying above.\r\n\r\nHe also told us a tale of the war of 1812, when a bridge, known as the\r\n'High Bridge,' crossed the Au Sable at the narrowest point, some eleven\r\nfeet in width. A rumor was abroad that the British were about to march\r\nup from Plattsburg; whereupon the bridge, consisting of three beams,\r\neach nine inches wide, was stripped of its planking. A gentleman had\r\nleft his home in the morning, and, ignorant of the fate of the bridge,\r\nreturned quite late at night. Urging his steed forward, it refused to\r\ncross the bridge, and not until after repeated castigation would it make\r\nthe attempt. The crossing was safely accomplished, and the rider\r\nsuspected nothing amiss until he reached home and was asked how he had\r\ncome. 'By the High Bridge,' was his reply; whereupon he was informed\r\nthat the planking had been torn away, and he must have crossed upon a\r\nstring piece nine inches wide, hanging some hundred feet above the\r\nsurface of the water. His sensations may be imagined.\r\n\r\nA venturesome expedition had also been essayed by our host, in the shape\r\nof a voyage down the chasm in a boat. We presume he went at high water,\r\nwhen the rapids would be less dangerous.\r\n\r\nKeeseville is only four miles from Port Kent, a steamboat landing on\r\nLake Champlain nearly opposite Burlington, and the Adirondacs may then\r\nbe approached in several ways. A stage runs three times per week from\r\nKeeseville through Elizabethtown and Schroon River to Schroon Lake.\r\nNorth Elba and Lake Placid are some thirty-six miles distant, and may be\r\nreached by a good road through the Wilmington Pass. Saranac is somewhat\r\nfarther, but readily accessible. Strong wagons and good teams are\r\neverywhere to be found, and the only recommendation we here think\r\nneedful to make to the traveller is to have a good umbrella, a thick\r\nshawl or overcoat, and as little other baggage as he or she can possibly\r\nmanage to find sufficient. Trunks are sadly in the way, and carpet bags\r\nor valises the best forms for stowage under seats or among feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOIS PEARL BERKELEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fiery July noon was blazing over the unsheltered depot platform,\r\nwhere everybody was in the agony of trying to compress half an hour's\r\nwork into the fifteen minutes' stop of the long express train. The day\r\nwas so hot that even the group of idlers which usually formed the still\r\nlife of the picture was out of sight on the shady side of the buildings.\r\nHackmen bustled noisily about; baggage masters were busier and crosser\r\nthan ever; there was the usual _melee_ of leave-takings and greetings.\r\nWith the choking dust and scalding glare of the sun, the whole scene\r\nmight have been an anteroom to Tophet.\r\n\r\nFrom the car window, Clement Moore, brown, hollow-cheeked, and clad in\r\narmy blue, looked out with weary eyes on all the confusion. Half asleep\r\nin the parching heat, visions of cool, green forest depths, and endless\r\nripple of leaves, of the ceaseless wash and sway of salt tides, drifted\r\nacross his brain, and rapt him out of the sick, comfortless present. But\r\nthey vanished like a flash with the sudden cessation of motion, and the\r\nreality of his surroundings came back with a great shock. Captain\r\nGeorge, coming in five minutes after with a glass of iced lemonade in\r\none hand and a half dozen letters in the other, found necessary so much\r\nof cheer and comfort as lay in--\r\n\r\n'Keep courage, Clement, old fellow, it's only a few hours longer now.'\r\n\r\nAnd then he fell to reading his epistles, testifying his disapprobation\r\nof their contents presently by sundry grunts, ending finally in a\r\n'Confound it!' given explosively and an explanation:\r\n\r\n'Too bad, Moore! Here am I taking you home to get well in peace and\r\nquiet, and Ellen has filled the house up with half a dozen girls, more\r\nor less. Writes me to come home and be 'made a lion of;' as sensible as\r\nmost women!' And the grumble subsided. He broke out again shortly:\r\n'Louise Meller--Lois Berkeley--Susy--' the other names were drowned in\r\nthe rattle of the starting train. The captain finished his letters, and\r\nClement Moore took up his broken dreams, but this time with a new\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nLois Berkeley. With the name came back a fortnight of the last\r\nsummer--perfect bright days, far-off skies filled with drifting fleets\r\nof sunny vapor, summer green piled deep over the land, the gurgle of\r\nfalling waters, the shimmer of near grain fields, deep-hued flowers\r\nglowing in the garden borders, all the prodigality of splendor that July\r\npours over the world. And floating through these memories, scarce\r\nrecognized, but giving hue and tone to them like a far-off, half-heard\r\nstrain of music--a woman's presence. By some fine, subtile harmony, such\r\nas spirits recognize, all the summer glow and depth of color, as it came\r\nback to him, came only as part of an exquisite clothing and setting for\r\na slender figure and dark face. All the dainty adaptations of nature\r\nwere but an expression, in a rude, material way, for those elegances and\r\nfitnesses which surrounded her, and which were as natural to her very\r\nexistence as to the birds and flowers. Only a fortnight, and in that\r\nfortnight every look and word of hers, every detail of dress, even to\r\nthe texture of the garments she wore, were indelibly fixed in his\r\nmemory. She was so daintily neat in everything, nothing soiled or coarse\r\never came near her. Careless, too, he thought, remembering how, coming\r\nthrough the parlor in the evening dusk, he had entangled himself in the\r\ncostly crape shawl left trailing across a chair, of the gloves he had\r\npicked up fluttering with the leaves on the veranda, and the\r\nhandkerchiefs always lying about. Perhaps Clement Moore was over\r\ncritical in his fancies about ladies' dresses, and felt that inner\r\nperfect cleanliness and refinement worked itself out in such little\r\nmatters as the material and color and fit of garments, and all the\r\ntrifles of the toilet. A soiled or rumpled article of attire showed a\r\ndangerous lack of something that should make up the womanly character.\r\nHe had not reduced all these unreasonable men's notions to a system by\r\nwhich to measure femininity. He did not even know he had them. An\r\nexcessive constitutional refinement and keenness of perception made him\r\ninvoluntarily look for such scrupulous delicacy as belonging of course\r\nto every woman he was thrown in contact with. He had always been\r\ndisappointed, at first with a feeling of half disgust with himself and\r\nothers, that his dreams were so different from the reality. It drove him\r\napart from the sex, and gained him the reputation of being shy or ill\r\nnatured. After finding that disappointments repeated themselves, he\r\naccepted them as the natural order of events, let his fancies go as the\r\nbeau ideal that he was to seek for through life, and became the\r\npolished, unimpressible man of society.\r\n\r\nBut this little Yankee girl had of a sudden realized his ideal.\r\nSomething in their first meeting, momentary though it was, and strange\r\naccording to conventional notions, struck the chord in his heart that\r\nwas waiting silent for the magic fingers that knew the secret of waking\r\nit. If he had fancied that those fingers would never come, or coming,\r\nnever find it, that something in his unhappy birth set him apart with\r\nthat strange pain of yearning as his portion in life, and so had tried\r\nto forget or choke the want under commonplace attachments and ties, he\r\nwas no worse than, nor different from, the rest of humanity. But all\r\nhumanity does not meet trial as unflinchingly and honorably--does not\r\nput temptation out of its way as purely and honestly as did this\r\nundisciplined life. It is hard to take at once the path that duty\r\norders: we linger to play with possibilities, shed some idle tears,\r\nwaste life before the necessity, and go back to everyday work weakened\r\nand scarred and aching. And once or twice in a lifetime that black,\r\nhopeless _never_ drops down, not the less grievous and inexorable\r\nbecause simply a moral obligation.\r\n\r\nWell, only babies cry for the moon. Anything clearly impossible and out\r\nof our reach we very soon cease sighing for. Men do not cherish a\r\npassion which they recognize as utterly hopeless; and Clement Moore,\r\nbeing a man, and moreover an honorable one, put this summer idyl out of\r\nhis head and heart with all despatch. 'All blundering is sin.' If he had\r\nblundered in allowing it to take such hold of his life, he expiated the\r\nsin bravely. Sympathies bud and blossom with miraculous quickness in\r\nthis tropical atmosphere of affinity. He did not know till the\r\nexcitement of actual presence was over, and he had time to think\r\nsoberly, in the dead blank and quiet that followed, how it had grown to\r\nbe a part of his very existence. But whether that part was to be just a\r\npleasant remembrance through the dusty and hot years before him, or\r\nwhether it was to go deeper and wring his heart with bitterest sense of\r\nloss, he did not quite realize. At any rate there was a risk in dwelling\r\non it. He had no more right to be running that risk than he had to be\r\ntrifling with a cup of deadliest poison; and so he shut away all the\r\ngolden-winged fancies that had sprung into life with those long, fervid\r\ndays. Shut them away and sealed their prison place. If they were dead,\r\nor pleading for freedom in his still moments, he never asked nor\r\nthought. He came back from his lounging summer trip with a certain new,\r\nstrange drive of purpose in him never seen before. The many events that\r\nhad crowded themselves into the next year did not smother his prisoners.\r\nHe never saw their corpses or thought of them sneeringly, and by that\r\nsign knew they existed still. But dust and all the desolation of\r\ndesertion gathered about the hidden chamber that he never recurred to\r\nnow. Still he kept away from its neighborhood; at first setting a guard\r\nof persistent physical action. He was always reading or writing or going\r\nsomewhere with a kind of hidden, misty aim in his most objectless\r\njourneys. After--as the necessity for such occupation wore away, and he\r\nlapsed back into the old listless ways of dreaming--his thoughts were\r\nalways busy with the future; never now did he indulge in those wayward\r\ndreams of old. They had a dangerous tendency to take a certain forbidden\r\nway. Finally, this self-control became a habit, and he scarcely felt its\r\nnecessity. The 'might have been' never came back more poignantly than as\r\na vague, shadowy regret, that gave everything a slightly flat and\r\nunpalatable taste. But he did not take life any less fully, or with any\r\nabatement of whatever earnestness was in him.\r\n\r\nMen are not patient under sickness, at least not that unquestioning,\r\nunresisting patience which most women and the lower animals show. These\r\nespecially who are usually well and robust are a trial to the flesh and\r\nspirit of those about them. Moore was not the wonderful exception. His\r\nfirst few weeks in the hospital were not so bad; but when the actual\r\nracking pain was over, and nothing remained but that halting of the\r\nphysical machinery to which we never give a thought during perfect\r\naction--the weakness hanging leaden weights to every limb, the unwonted\r\nnervousness and irritability, the apparently causeless necessity for\r\ninaction--he was anything but a resigned man. Captain George, getting\r\nhis furlough and carrying him off, was blessed from the deepest heart of\r\nthe ward nurses. He had a kind of feeling that this his first illness\r\nwas a matter in which the universe should be concerned, and with that\r\nfretful self-exaggeration came that other unutterable yearning that\r\nattends the first proof that we are coheirs with others to the ills\r\nflesh is heir to, weary homesickness and childish desire for sympathy.\r\n\r\nSo now, weakened physically with that strange new heartsickness,\r\nparalyzing his will and giving freer scope to is feverish impatience,\r\nGeorge's careless words had rolled away the stone from the sepulchre,\r\nand its prisoners were free. Not dead, not having lost a shade of color\r\nfrom their wings, they nestled and gleamed through his heart, filling\r\nthe summer day with just such intangible perfect witchery as those other\r\ndays had been full of. Perhaps, too, time and absence had heightened the\r\ncharm. Imagination has such a way of catching up little scenes and words\r\nand looks, and, without altering one of the facts, haloing them with\r\nsuch a golden deceptive atmosphere, adding, day by day, faintest\r\ntouches, that they grow by and by into a something wholly different. So\r\nthat fortnight came back to him, an illuminated poem, along rich strains\r\nof music, making every nerve thrill with the pleasure-pain of its\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nAnd by degrees, as the tide of sensation, thinned itself, lying back\r\nwith closed eyes, while the long train swept on through the torrid day,\r\nseparate pictures came before his inner sight. Just as keen and clear\r\nwere they as when they first fell on his vision. He had not blurred nor\r\ndimmed their outlines with frequent recalling and suggestions of\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nA narrow strip of gray sand, ribbed with the wave wash to the very foot\r\nof the reddish brown bowlders that bounded it. Standing thereon a\r\nslender woman's figure, clad in quiet gray. The face was turned toward\r\nhim--a dark, unflushed face, with calm, fixed mouth, and clear gray eyes\r\nunder straight-drawn brows and long, separate, lashes. Fine, lustreless,\r\nsilky hair was pushed back into a net glittering with shining specks\r\nunder the narrow-brimmed straw hat. A face full of a waiting look, not\r\nhopeful nor expectant, simply unsettled and watchful, yet fresh, and\r\nrounded with the dimples and childlike curves of eighteen. Whatever of\r\nyearning and unrest the years had brought lingered only about the\r\nshadowy eyes and fine mouth. There were no haggard nor worn outlines,\r\nand a baby's skin could not have been softer and finer.\r\n\r\nAt her feet crisped the shining ripples of the incoming tide. Far\r\nbeyond, calm and burnished, stretched the summer sea into the dreamy\r\ndistance, where the white noon sky, stricken through with intensest\r\nlight and heat, dropped down a palpitating arch to meet it. And in all\r\nthe dazzle of blue and white and silver and bare shining gray, she\r\nstood, a straight, slender, haughty little figure, as indefinite of\r\ncolor as all the rest; all but a narrow strip of scarlet at her throat,\r\nfalling in a flaming line to her waist. The shimmering atmosphere seemed\r\nto pant about her; and through the high noon, over the still waters and\r\nsleeping shore, hummed the peering strains of a weird little song. She\r\nwas singing softly:\r\n\r\n  'For men must work and women must weep,\r\n  And the sooner 'tis over the sooner to sleep.'\r\n\r\nIn the long parlor, the leaf ghosts that had all day long been flitting\r\nin, were darkening with the sunset and filling the room with twilight\r\ndimness. Deep in a crimson couch and haloed with the last brightness,\r\nlay the long, white outlines of a reclining figure. A handful of Japan\r\nlilies burned against the pure drapery, and another handful of tea\r\nviolets lay crushed in the fleecy handkerchief on the floor. Against the\r\ncushions the exquisite contour of the sleeping face showed plainly.\r\nCoolest quiet sphered the whole figure; not a suggestion of anything but\r\nslowest calm grace disturbed its repose. But with the hushing rustle of\r\nleaves with the summer murmur flowing in, seemed to come also the deep\r\nmonotone of the waves, when this inanimate statue was striking out at\r\nhis side through the rattle and rush of the surf, the wide eyes filled\r\nwith fierce light, the whole face fixed and stern with the strain of\r\nheart muscle, toward the helpless shape shooting out on the undertow. He\r\nhad not seen her after, and, coming to seek her that night with words of\r\ncompliment and thanks, he was met by this white vision that had absorbed\r\nall the fire and force of the afternoon into its blankness.\r\n\r\nA depot platform--long afternoon shadows fell over the pretty country\r\nstation--standing alone in the woods. The small, temporary bustle about\r\nthe waiting train was not discordant with the dreamy, restful look of\r\nthe whole picture. Then the culminating hurry, the shriek and rattle of\r\nthe starting train--a little figure poising itself for an instant on the\r\ncar step--a face flushed a little, and dark eyes brightened with a flash\r\nof surprised recognition--a quick gesture of greeting and farewell, and\r\nthen she was gone into the purple shades of evening.\r\n\r\nOnce again he had seen her, but from afar off, in the glare and heat of\r\na crowded assembly room. The face was a little thinner now, and the eyes\r\nwere looking farther away than ever. The blood-red light of rubies\r\nflashed in the soft lace at her throat and wrists, and dropped in\r\nglittering pendants against the slender neck. She was talking evidently\r\nof a brilliant bouquet of pomegranates and daphnes that lay in her lap,\r\nswinging dreamily the dainty, glittering white fan. And while he looked,\r\nshe drew away the heavy brocade she wore, from under a careless tread--a\r\nslight, slow motion, wholly unlike the careless sweeps of other women.\r\nThe imperious nature that thrilled her even to the tips of the long\r\nfingers, manifested itself, as inborn natures always do, under the\r\ndeepest disguises, in just this unconscious, most trifling of acts; and,\r\nremembering the gesture, he asked, with words far lighter than the tone\r\nor feeling:\r\n\r\n'As much of a princess as ever?'\r\n\r\nAnd Captain George answered:\r\n\r\n'As much of a princess!' both unmindful that no word had been spoken to\r\ntoken who was in the thought of each.\r\n\r\nVery trifling things these were to remember. Very likely he had seen\r\nscores of far more graceful and memorable scenes; but just these\r\ntrifles, coming back so vividly, proved to him, as nothing else could\r\nhave done, with what a keen, intense sympathy every word and look of\r\nhers had been noted.\r\n\r\nThe spoken words roused him. In the ride that followed, twenty different\r\npersons and things came into their talk; but never once the princess.\r\n_That_, arousing himself again from his half-dreamful lapse from the old\r\nguarded habit, was put away steadily and quietly. His battle had been\r\nfought once. He was not to weaken his victory with fancies of the 'might\r\nhave been.' He had not been tempted, through all these months; he would\r\nnot tempt himself, now that real trial was so near at hand. Man as he\r\nwas, if escape had been possible, he would have fled. But there was\r\nnothing to do but to go forward, and he called up that old, mighty,\r\nintangible safeguard of honor. The matter was settled beyond any\r\nquestion of surprise--he must avoid the long, sapping days of contact,\r\nthe wasting, feverish yearnings of absence coming after.\r\n\r\nFlying over miles and miles of the summer land, heaped with the red\r\ntangled sweets of clover fields, belted with white starry mayweed, blue\r\nwith marshy growth of wild flag, with hazy lines of far-off hills,\r\nfading into purple depths of distance, and near low ones lying green and\r\ncalm close beside them, with brown clear brooks, famous trout streams,\r\nafter the New England fashion, went running across their way, the old\r\nhome pride leaped up in George's eyes and voice, and even Moore forgot\r\nhis weariness, and talked with a flash of the old, careless spirit.\r\n\r\nThe hack that brought them to their destination left them, deep in the\r\nsummer night, at the foot of the long avenue of elms--going up which,\r\nwith slow steps, on a sudden the house broke on them, ablaze with\r\nlights, athrob with music, whereat there was a renewal of explosive\r\nutterances, and the captain led his friend to the rear of the house to\r\ninsure a quiet entrance.\r\n\r\nFrom the dark piazza, where he waited while George summoned some one to\r\nreceive them, he caught, through the long, open casement, the vista of\r\nthe parlors, with their glitter and confusion of light drapery and\r\nglimpses of bright faces and light forms, and softened hum of voices, as\r\nthe dancers circled with the music. And through it all, straight down\r\ntoward him, floating in one of the weird Strauss waltzes, came the\r\nprincess, swathed in something white, airy, wide-falling. The same dark,\r\nunflushed face, the same wide, far-looking eyes, and fixed mouth, the\r\nsame silky falling hair, but cut short now, and floating back as she\r\nmoved. It was only for a moment: the perfumed darkness that seemed to\r\nthrob with a sudden life of its own, the great, slow, summer stars above\r\nhim, the wailing, passionate music that came trembling out among the\r\nheavy dew-wet foliage, the dark, calm earth about him, and the light and\r\ncolor and giddy motion that filled the gleaming square before him,\r\nstruck in on his senses with staggering force; and then she swayed out\r\nof his sight, and Mrs. Morris came forward with words of cheer and\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThat night, lying sleepless after the music was hushed and the wheels\r\nhad done rolling away from the door, as if material enough for all fever\r\nfancies had not been given, backward and forward through the corridor a\r\nwoman's garments trailed with light rustle, and a low voice hummed\r\nbrokenly the waltz he had heard. Ceasing by and by in a murmur of girls'\r\nvoices, and the old-remembered air, sung softly:\r\n\r\n  'For men must work and women must weep,\r\n  Though storms be sudden and waters deep.'\r\n\r\nAfter that many days went by unmarked. His wound, aggravated by fatigue,\r\nracked him with renewed pain; and when that was over, vitality was at\r\ntoo low an ebb for anything but the most passive quiet. Before listless,\r\nunnoting eyes drifted the crystal mornings, the golden hours steeped\r\ndeep in summer languors, the miracles of sun-settings and star-filled\r\nholy nights. From his window he saw and heard always the ocean, blue and\r\ncalm, lapping the shore with dreamy ripple in bright days--driving\r\nghostly swirls of spray and fog clown the beach in stormy, gray ones.\r\nThe house itself seemed set in the deepest haunt of summertime. Great\r\ntrees, draped in the fullest growth of the year, rippled waves of green\r\nhigh about it. All day long the leaf sounds and leaf shadows came\r\ndrifting in at the windows. Perfectest hush and quiet wrapped its\r\noccasional faint strains of music, or chime of voices came up to him,\r\nbut did not break the silence. A place for a well soul to find its full\r\nstature, for a tired or sick one to gather again its lost forces. And by\r\nslow degrees the life held at first with so feeble a grasp came back to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBy and by there came a day when, from his balcony, he witnessed a\r\ndeparture, full of girls' profuse adieux, and then the hush of vacancy\r\nfell on the wide halls and airy rooms of the great house. That evening,\r\nwith slow steps, he came down the staircase. In the twilight of the\r\nparlors showed dimly outlined a drift of woman's drapery, and the piano\r\nwas murmuring inarticulately. Outside, on the broad stone doorstep,\r\nshowed another drift, resolving itself into the muslins of Miss Nelly\r\nMorris, springing up with glad words of welcome as his unsteady frame\r\ncame into view. Before half the protracted and vehement hand shaking was\r\nover, Moore turned at a soft rustle behind him, and Nelly found her\r\nintroduction forestalled. Moore hoped, with his courtliest reverence,\r\nthat Miss Berkeley had not forgotten him.\r\n\r\nShe made two noiseless steps forward, and put out a small, brown band.\r\nHe took it in his left, with a smiling glance of apology at the\r\nsling-fettered right arm. It was not often that Miss Berkeley's broad\r\nlids found it worth their while to raise themselves for such a wide,\r\nclear look as they allowed with the clasp. And then Nelly broke in:\r\n\r\n'Then you two people know each other. Grand! And I've been wondering\r\nthese two weeks what to do with you! Why didn't you tell me, Leu?'\r\n\r\n'How was I to identify Mr. Moore with 'George's friend from the army'?\r\nMr. Moore remembers he was on debatable ground last summer.'\r\n\r\nHer soft, slow speech fell on his hearing like the silver ripple of\r\nwater, clear and fine cut, but without a bit of the New England\r\nincisiveness of tone that filled his delicate Southern ear with slight,\r\nperpetual irritation.\r\n\r\n'But I've made my calling and election sure at last. I was transformed\r\ninto a mudsill and Northern hireling last spring.'\r\n\r\n'In spite of the transformation, I recognized you as soon as you spoke.\r\nI was not quite willing to be forgotten, you see, by any one who wore\r\nthe glorifying army cloth.'\r\n\r\nThey were out on the veranda now. Nelly was gazing with pitiful eyes at\r\nthe sleeve fastened away, while the wasted left hand drew forward a\r\ngreat wicker chair into the circle of the moonlight. He caught the look:\r\n\r\n'Not so very bad, Miss Nelly; not off, you see, only useless for the\r\npresent;' and he took a lowly seat at her side, near the princess's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n'You are guiltless of shoulder straps. You might have obtained a\r\ncommission, I think. Why didn't you, I wonder,' she said speculatively.\r\n\r\n'Because I knew nothing of military matters, for one thing, and hadn't\r\nthe assurance to take my first lesson as lieutenant or captain.'\r\n\r\nMiss Berkeley's white lids lifted themselves again.\r\n\r\n'More nice then wise, sir. Others do it,' was Nelly's comment.\r\n\r\n'Yes, but I haven't forgotten the old copy-book instructions, 'Learn to\r\nobey before you command,' and began at the beginning. I've taken the\r\nfirst step toward the starred shoulder straps'--he wore the corporal's\r\nstripes--' and am hopeful.'\r\n\r\n'You'll never attain to them, you lazy Southron. Tell as about your camp\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\n'There's very little to tell. Drill, smoke, loaf--begging your pardon\r\nfor the rough expression of a rough fact--drill again. As one day is, so\r\nis another; they're all alike.'\r\n\r\n'Well, tell us about your getting wounded, then, and the fight. George\r\nwill not get wounded himself, in spite of my repeated requests to that\r\neffect.'\r\n\r\nAnd so Moore fought his battle over again, in the midst of which Miss\r\nBerkeley dropped out of the talk, folded some soft brilliant net over\r\nher light dress, and went down the walk leading to the shore, and he did\r\nnot see her again that night.\r\n\r\nAfter that he spent much of his time below stairs. Much alone; there\r\nwere walks and rides in which he could take no part. Despite of George's\r\nprediction, he had peace and quiet, and gathered strength hourly.\r\nWhatever of graciousness he _had_ seen or fancied in Miss Berkeley's\r\nmanner in that first unexpected meeting had all vanished. A subtile,\r\nunconquerable something shut her out from all friendliness of speech or\r\naction. She went about the house in her slow, abstracted way, or in her\r\nother mood, with sudden darting motions like a swallow, or dreamed all\r\nday beside the summer sea, coming back browner and with mistier looks in\r\nher gray eyes, but always alone and unapproachable. So that in half a\r\ndozen days he had not received as many voluntary sentences from her.\r\n\r\nBut one morning the clouds had gathered black and heavy. The sea fogs\r\nhad pitched their tents to landward, and their misty battalions were\r\ndriving gray across the landscape. Dim reaches of blank water--lay\r\nbeyond, weltering with an uneasy, rocking motion against the low, dark\r\nsky. White, ghostly sea birds wheeled low, a fretful wind grieved about\r\nthe house, and a New England northeast storm was in progress. She was\r\nstanding at the window, looking out with eyes farther away than ever\r\nover the haze-draped sea. Some fine, heavy material, the same indistinct\r\nhue as the day outside, fell about her in large, sweeping folds. A\r\nbreath of sudden, penetrating perfume struck across his senses as he\r\napproached her. 'And gray heliotrope!' he said; but the heliotrope\r\nvanished as she turned and displayed the blaze of carnations at her\r\nthroat, and the gleam of crimson silk under the jaunty zouave.\r\n\r\n'Lois Pearl Berkeley,' he read from the golden thimble he had nearly\r\ncrushed under foot. He half wondered if she would know what it was. He\r\nnever saw her do anything. She was never 'engaged,' nor in haste about\r\nany occupation. The perfect freedom from the universal Yankee necessity\r\nof motion, with which the brown, small hands fell before her, was as\r\nthoroughly a part of her as the strange Indian scent which clung to\r\neverything she touched, and sphered her like the atmosphere of another\r\nworld. He never could associate the idea of any kind of personal\r\ncare-taking with her dainty leisure, more than with the lilies of the\r\nfield, though they never appeared in as many graceful arrays as she.\r\n\r\n'Yes, mine, thank you,' she said, and composedly dropped it into its\r\nplace in the most orderly of useless conglomerations of silken pockets\r\nand puzzling pigeon holes. He watched her fingers, and then looked back\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n'Lois--such an odd name for you--such a quaint, staid Puritan name.'\r\n\r\n'And I am neither quaint nor staid nor Puritan. Thank you. Yes, my\r\nmother must have had recollections of her New England home strong on her\r\nwhen she gave it me, down on the Louisiana shores. It always sounded\r\neven to me a little strange and frigid among such half-tropical\r\nsurroundings.'\r\n\r\nAs she spoke a sudden pang of utter weariness and longing seized him. A\r\nrush of the boyish malady of homesickness, concentrated from all the\r\ndreary months of his long absence, and none the less poignant because it\r\nwas involuntary. The wide, cool, shadowy halls of his mother's house,\r\nalways aglow with blossoms and haunted with their odors, all the\r\nsuperficial lotus-charm of Southern life--and he had lived it\r\nsuperficially enough to catch all its poetry rose before him. It caught\r\naway his breath and choked sudden tears into his eyes. Came and went\r\nlike a flash--for before she had done speaking a sudden new bond of\r\nsympathy put away the _stranger_ forevermore, and he was no longer\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n'Then you are Southern born too,' he said, with a quick step forward,\r\nand involuntarily outstretched hand. Hers dropped into it.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I am hardly acclimated yet. I shiver under these pale Northern\r\nskies from August till June. O my Louisiana, you never made 'life a\r\nburden' with such dark, chill days, and sobbing, cruel winds!' She\r\nturned to the windows. A sudden uncontrollable quaver of impatience and\r\nlonging ran through her speech and hurried the words with unusual\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n'I thought you must have liked the day, since you robed yourself in its\r\nhaze and mist.' He laid his hand lightly on her gray drapery with\r\nreverent touch.\r\n\r\n'And _I_ thought my carnations would redeem that. Since they\r\ndidn't--'and she tossed the whole bright, spicy handful on the table.\r\n\r\nIn a vase on the mantle, gray, passionate, odorous blooms were massed\r\nloosely about a cluster of fragile, intense day lilies, and a dash of\r\npurple and crimson trailed with the fuchsias over its edge, and gleamed\r\nup from the white marble ledge. He went to the vase, shook out the\r\nfuchsias, and laid the residue in her lap.\r\n\r\n'Heliotrope, finally,' he said.\r\n\r\nShe brushed it lightly away with a half shudder.\r\n\r\n'Not that. I don't like heliotrope. Its perfume is heart-breaking,\r\nhopeless. It belongs in coffins, about still, dead faces. If it had a\r\nvoice, we should hear continual moans. It would be no worse than this,\r\nthough.'\r\n\r\n'You will wear the lilies then, unless the heliotrope scent clings to\r\nthem too,' he said, gathering up the obnoxious flowers.\r\n\r\n'Yes, if it doesn't jar your ideal to see them worn against such a\r\nstormy day dress. To me they are the perfection of summer. No _color_\r\ncould be more intense than this spotless whiteness. There!' Fastening\r\nthem, the brittle stems snapped, and the flowers fell at her feet. 'No\r\nflowers for me to-day, of your choosing at least. Practically, lilies\r\nhave such an uncomfortable way of breaking short off.'\r\n\r\nA broad, bright ribbon lay drawn through 'Charles Anchester' on the\r\ntable. She knotted it carelessly at her throat.\r\n\r\n'That will do for the now; but, O my carnations, how your mission\r\nfailed!' hovering over them a minute.\r\n\r\n'Then you are not satisfied with the New England mean of perfection, in\r\neverything, mentally, morally, and meteorologically?' going back to the\r\nweather again.\r\n\r\n'Satisfied! I'd exchange this whole pale summer for one hour of broad,\r\ntorrid noonlight. Deep, far-off tropical skies, great fronds of tropical\r\nfoliage, drawing their sustenance from the slowest, richest juices of\r\nnature, gorgeous depths of color blazing with the very heart of the sun,\r\ndeep, intoxicating odors poured from creamy white or flaming flower\r\nchalices, and always the silver-sprayed wash of the blue sea. I remember\r\nthat of my home. It is months and months since I have seen a magnolia or\r\njasmine.'\r\n\r\nFate sent Miss Morris to the parlor just then, luckily enough, perhaps,\r\nand the first dash of rain from the coming storm struck the windows\r\nsharply. Miss Berkeley shivered; a gray shadow swept up over her face,\r\nand absorbed all the gleam and unrest. She moved off with her book to a\r\nwindow; shut herself out from the room, and into the storm, with a heavy\r\nfall of curtains; and Nelly's voice rippled through a tripping, Venetian\r\nbarcarole.\r\n\r\nIt stormed all the next day, and when twilight came, it rained still\r\nwith desperation. A narrow sphere of light from the flame low down in\r\nits alabaster shade held the piano, and through the warm scented gloom\r\nthat filled the rest of the parlor thrilled echoing chords. Moore,\r\ncoming in, stopped in the dimness to listen. A troubled uncertainty made\r\nitself felt through the strains, a sudden discordant crash jarred\r\nthrough the room, and the performer rose abruptly. He came forward.\r\n\r\n'O my prophetic soul, magnolias!' said Nelly, from her lounge, just\r\noutside the lighted circle.\r\n\r\nIt had just come from him, the light, exquisite basket he held filled\r\nwith great, pink, flushed magnolia blooms. Nelly raved in most\r\nfashionably extravagant adjectives. Lois looked at it with hungry eyes,\r\nbut motionless and speechless. He laid it before her on the table, and\r\nturned away. She stood for a moment looking gravely down on it, then\r\nburied her face among the cool petals with a sudden caressing motion.\r\nLooking up again shortly, 'Thank you,' she said simply to the giver\r\nchatting carelessly.\r\n\r\nA broad illumination flooded the other end of the parlor a minute after,\r\nand the chess board came into requisition. If Miss Morris found little\r\nskill necessary to discomfit her opponent, and wondered thereat, she\r\ncould not see, as he saw, a dark face, bowed on tropic blooms, flushed\r\nwith unwonted glad color, lips apart and aquiver, wide eyes lustrous\r\nwith purple light, shining through the tears that gathered in them.\r\n\r\nThen the piano began, played dreamily, irregularly, with slender, single\r\nthreads of tune, and frequent pauses, as if the preoccupied mind let the\r\nlistless fingers fall away from the keys. They gathered up finally all\r\nthe broken strains into a low, slow-moving harmony. Through it Moore\r\nheard the soft lap of waves, the slow rock of Pacific tidal swells,\r\nflowing and ebbing and flowing again through flaming noons, about\r\nhalf-submerged bits of world, palm-shaded, sun-drenched, or swaying\r\nwhite with moonlight under purple midnights, holy with the clear burning\r\nstars: heard the gurgle and ripple of falling streams, deepening into\r\nthe wide flow of mighty rivers, bearing in their calm sweep the secrets\r\nof a zone--of ice-choked springs, of the dead stillness of Northern\r\nforests, and the overgrowth, and passionate life of endless summers.\r\n\r\nThe red and white combatants now held truce over a queen check, while\r\nthe players sat silent, listening.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, through the murmur and rhythmic flow of water sounds, struck\r\nshrill and sharp the opening strains of a march--not such marches as\r\nmark time for dainty figures crowding ballroom floors, but triumphant,\r\ncruel, proud, with throbbing drum-beat--steadying the tramp of weary\r\nfeet over red battle fields. Its unswerving hurry, its terrible, calm\r\nexcitement, brought before his vision long blue lines--the fixed faces\r\nsterner than death, with steady eyes and quickened breath--the nervous\r\nclutch of muskets, as the rattle of small arms and boom of cannon came\r\nnearer and nearer, the fluttering silken banners, the calm sunshine, and\r\nsweet May breath--and the quick, questioning note of a meadow lark\r\ndropped down through the silence of the advancing column. As the\r\nmaddening music stormed and beat about him, his heart throbbed audibly,\r\nand the rushing currents of his fiery Southern blood sounded in his\r\nears. Honor, prudence, resolution, everything was swept away in the lava\r\ntide of excitement. Before him he saw the crown of his life. All heaven\r\nand all earth should not stop him short of it. He rose and began\r\ncrossing the room, with heavy, resolute tread. In the dimness, the\r\nplayer was hardly visible; he would assure himself of her mortality at\r\nleast. A sudden, fierce hunger for sight and touch thrilled him.\r\n\r\nMidway he stopped. The music dropped with a shock from its fiery\r\nenthusiasm. Was it only an echo, or an army of ghosts crossing a dim\r\nfield, long since fought over--the steady tramp, tramp, the pendulum of\r\ntime? Unutterably wailing, pitiful, it sent plaintive, piercing cries up\r\nto the calm, dead heavens. All the fearful sights he had seen rose\r\nbefore him. Upturned lay faces calm in death as in a child's sleep, with\r\nall camp roughnesses swept away in that still whiteness; strong men's,\r\nwith that terrible scowl of battle or the distortion of agonized death\r\non them--mangled and crushed forms--all the wreck of a fought battle,\r\nterrible in its suggestive pathos. It sank away into the minor of water\r\nvoices, soft, monotonous, agonizing in its utter passivity, a brilliant\r\narpeggio flashed up the keys like a shower of gold, and Miss Berkeley\r\nrose with white face and trembling breath, and Nelly was alone in the\r\nroom, sobbing nervously in her armchair.\r\n\r\nThe storm passed that night, with great swayings of trees, and dash of\r\nbroad raindrops, and piled up broken masses of fleecy white clouds,\r\ntossed about by the rough, exultant September wind. Bright days\r\nfollowed, mellowing with each one to sunnier, calmer perfection. Moore\r\npassed them in his own room. That night had torn away all the disguises\r\nthat he had put upon his heart. He knew now that he loved this\r\nwoman--knew it with such a bitter sense of humiliation as such proud\r\nspirits writhe under when honor turns traitor and betrays them to the\r\nenemy. 'Lead us not into temptation.' If it meant anything in the old\r\nhabit of child's prayer which clung to him yet, it meant that he should\r\nput himself out of its way, since he had proved himself too weak to meet\r\nit. His inborn honesty let him build no excuses for his failure. He saw,\r\nand acknowledged with a flush of scorn and curling lip, his own\r\ntreachery to himself in his hour of need. That he had not committed\r\nhimself--that his self-betrayal was only known to self--was no merit of\r\nhis--simply a circumstance. And circumstances seemed mighty in their\r\ninfluence upon him, he thought, with a feeling of deepest contempt. All\r\npride and self-reliance were taken out of him. Absence, at least, would\r\nbe a safeguard, since it would render harmless such impulses as those of\r\nthat night. However much he might sin in yearning, she; should never\r\nknow, never be exposed to the risk of being drawn into his guilt and\r\npain. He had come at last to the place where all the old delicate pride\r\nwas merged in the one anxious fear that she should suffer. He would go\r\naway the next day; he would not see her again--never see her\r\nvoluntarily--putting away fiercely the sudden pang of yearning: not that\r\nhe came at once to such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nHonor, pride, self-respect, having failed him once, were not easily\r\nrecalled to their allegiance. His was no feeble nature, to sin and\r\nrepent in an hour. He fought over every inch of his way, and came out at\r\nlast conqueror, but scarred and weary and very weak in heart, and\r\ndistrustful of himself.\r\n\r\nThey had gone to ride that afternoon--he had seen them drive away. He\r\nwould go down and make the necessary arrangements for his departure. And\r\nso it happened that he stood an hour before sunset in the parlor. A\r\nsudden heart sickness drove the blood from his lips with the wrench of\r\nremembrance. It did not strengthen him to meet her, cool and royal, in\r\nfilmy purple, putting out her hand with frank friendliness, and with a\r\nnew quaver of interest in her voice. Those fatal magnolias: all the\r\noutside world seemed pressing nearer these two strangers in a strange\r\nland.\r\n\r\n'How pale you are! You have been ill again.'\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, almost harshly. 'You like tiger lilies,' lifting a stem\r\ncrowded with the flaming whirls.\r\n\r\n'Like them? yes--don't you? As I like the fiery, deafening drum-roll and\r\nscreaming fife, and silver, sweet bugle-calls. Think where they found\r\nthese wide, free curves of outline--that flaming contrast of color.\r\nIndian skies have rounded over them, Indian suns poured their fervor\r\ninto their hearts. In the depth of forest jungles the velvet-coated\r\ntiger has shaken off their petals--glittering, deadly cobras crushed\r\nthem in their slow coils; gorgeous-winged birds and insects swept them\r\nin their flight.'\r\n\r\nSome new mental impulse sent a rare, faint flush to the olive cheeks,\r\nand filled the uplooking clear eyes with light. This purple-clad shape,\r\nwith fiery nasturtiums burning on the breast and filling the air with\r\ntheir peculiar odor, with the barbaric splendor of tiger lilies\r\nreflecting their lurid glare about her as she stood, bore no more\r\nlikeness to the ordinary haughty woman than fire to snow. He would have\r\nliked to have crowned her with pomegranate blossoms--have dropped the\r\nsilvery sheen of ermine under her feet, and have knelt there to worship.\r\n\r\nShe moved away impatiently, trailed her noiseless drapery through the\r\nroom once or twice, and came back to the window, where he stood looking\r\nout. Before them lay the sea, calm in a sheen of blue, gathering faint\r\namethystine vapors, that the sunset would light up in a miracle of\r\nbronze and purple and rose.\r\n\r\n'You should have been with us last night! A soft, rushing south wind\r\nfilled all the air with whispers, and drew up a veil of lace round the\r\nhorizon, very high up in the east. Stars were few; the new moon dropped\r\ntender, faint beams down into the gray mist and grayer water that broke\r\nin ripples of white fire against the dark in the west, and mingled with\r\nthe mystery in the east. I want to go again. Mr. Moore, I can manage a\r\nboat; will you go with me?'\r\n\r\nWith every minute he saw his hard-earned victory slipping away. With\r\nevery minute his reeling sense lost foothold in the strange, new\r\nfascination of her excited presence. Will rallied to a last effort; he\r\nmuttered some broken excuse, that she must have thought an assent, for\r\nshe dropped a soft, white, clinging shawl over her shoulders, slipped\r\nthe tie of the jaunty hat beneath her chin, and he could only follow her\r\nas she slid through the flicker of shade and sunshine down to the beach,\r\nwhere the summer sea washed lazily.\r\n\r\nLow in the west and northwest lay piled ominous clouds; white, angry\r\nthunder heads began showing themselves.\r\n\r\n'A grand sunset for to-night, and a shower perhaps. We shall be back\r\nbefore it breaks.'\r\n\r\nA small boat--a frail thing of white and gilding--floated at anchor.\r\nLois shook out the sail in her character of manager, seated herself at\r\nthe helm, and they drifted out. No word was spoken; the light in her\r\neyes grew brighter and brighter; the scarlet curves of her mouth more\r\nand more intense. Sitting with face turned away from the west, she did\r\nnot see, as he did, the rising blackness. The wind freshened, skimming\r\nin fitful gusts over the waves, and the little craft flung off the spray\r\nlike rain. Away off in the shadow of the cloud the water was black as\r\ndeath, a faint line of white defining its edge. Was she infatuated? As\r\nfor him, he grew very calm, with a kind of desperation. Better to die\r\nso, with her face the last sight on earth--his last consciousness her\r\nclinging arms, sinking down to the dark, still caverns beneath--than to\r\nlive out the life that lay before him. He leaned forward and looked over\r\ninto the green depths of the sea. Sunshine still struck down in rippling\r\nlines, a golden network. Soft emerald shadows hung far down, breaking up\r\ninto surface rifts of cool dimness as the waves swung over them.\r\n\r\nHer hat had fallen back; her whole face was alive with a proud, exultant\r\ndelight in the exhilarating motion. Higher and higher rose the veil of\r\ncloud, and the blackness in the water was creeping toward them. Sea\r\nbirds wheeled low about them, with their peculiar quavering cry, and a\r\nlow swell made itself felt. Miss Berkeley turned her head; a sudden look\r\nof affright blanched her face to deadliest whiteness. A hand's breadth\r\nof clear sky lay beneath the sun, and down after them, with the speed of\r\na racer, came that great black wave. Before it the blue ripples shivered\r\nbrightly; behind it the angry water tossed and seethed. In its bosom,\r\nlurid, phosphorescent lights seemed to flit to and fro. Its crest was\r\nragged and white with dashes of foam. She took in the whole in a\r\nsecond's glance, and made a movement to bring the boat's head up to the\r\nwind. As the white face turned toward him, a quick instinct of\r\nself-preservation seized him, and he sprang up to lower the sail.\r\nSomething caught the halliards. His left arm was of little service; his\r\nright hung useless at his side. She reached forward--one hand on the\r\ntiller--to help him. The rim of the storm slipped up over the sun--a\r\nsudden flaw struck them--the rudder flew sharp round, wrenched out of\r\nher slight hold--the top-heavy sail caught the full force of the blow,\r\nsurged downward with a heavy lurch, and the gale was on them. A great\r\nblow, and swift darkness, then fierce currents rushing coldly past him;\r\nstrange, wild sounds filling his ears; and when his vision cleared\r\nitself, he saw Lois, unimpeded by her light drapery, striking out for\r\nthe sunken ledge, half a dozen yards away, over which the spray was\r\nflying furiously. He ground his teeth with impatience as his nerveless\r\narm fell helpless; but he reached her side at last. A narrow shelf, with\r\nbarely sufficient standing room for two. Great, dark waves, with strange\r\nlights flashing through them, whirled blinding deluges high above their\r\nheads, as he held her close. With the instinct of the weaker toward the\r\nstronger, she grasped and clung to him; and the fierce exultation that\r\nthrilled through his veins with actual contact, made him strong as a\r\ngiant. And then, close on the gale, came the rain, beating down the\r\nwaves with its heavy pour. In the thunder and tramp of the storm no\r\nhuman voice could have made itself audible, if speech had been needed.\r\n\r\nThe storm passed as suddenly as it had risen. Through a rift in the\r\nclouds a dash of blood-red light burst over the troubled waters, and\r\nwith it a sudden quiet fell about them. They were to have their 'grand\r\nsunset' finally.\r\n\r\n'We are too far from the mainland to reach it without help; no boats are\r\nlikely to pass this way after this storm; the tide is at its lowest now;\r\nit rises high over this ledge.'\r\n\r\nIn his quiet voice a half-savage triumph made itself heard. This\r\nnear-coming fate, that he believed inevitable, put away completely all\r\nclaims of that world that lay behind him--shut out everything but their\r\nown individuality. Time had narrowed to a point; all landmarks were\r\nswept away.\r\n\r\nMiss Berkeley's face had lost none of its whiteness; but the pallor was\r\nnot of fear. The great eyes burned star-like, and the mouth was like\r\niron. She looked up as his even tones fell on her ear. Something in his\r\ngaze fixed hers; through fearless, unveiled eyes, the soul looked\r\nstraight out to his. What he saw there dazzled and blinded him. He\r\ncaught her up to his heart suddenly and fiercely. His lips crushed hers\r\nin a long, clinging kiss, that seemed to drink up her very life. For\r\nthem, the brightness that for others is dissipated over long years of\r\nthe future, was concentrated into the single intense moment of the\r\npresent--this one moment, that seemed to burst into bud and blossom, the\r\nfruition of a lifetime. The sky lifted away and poured down fuller\r\nfloods of light; the air vibrated with strange, audible throbs. When he\r\nreleased her, she did not move away. Never again, though they lived out\r\na century, could the past be quite what it had been before; through it\r\nthey had come to this, the crowning perfection of their lives. Through\r\nthe future would run the memory of a caress in which--she was not a\r\nwoman who measured her gifts--she had dissolved all the hope and promise\r\nof that future for him. Desperation was no small element in the whirl.\r\nOnly into the eternities could he carry the _now_ pure and loyal. It had\r\nnothing to do with time; only through the shadow of the coming death had\r\nhe attained to it.\r\n\r\nThe fancy that had always haunted him with her peculiar name and dainty\r\npresence, prompted the 'Marguerite!'\r\n\r\nShe was not a woman to whom people give pet names. A _rested_, loving\r\nsmile gleamed over her face, and her lips sought his again.\r\n\r\n'My darling!'\r\n\r\n'Mine!' and then time drifted on, unbroken by the speech which would\r\nhave jarred the new, perfect harmony. Neither _thought_--the life\r\ncurrents that had met so wildly and suddenly, left space in their full,\r\ndisturbed flow, for just the one consciousness of delirious, satisfying\r\nlove. While the fiery sunset paled, he held the little drenched figure\r\nclose, her warm breath flowing across his cheek.\r\n\r\nOut of the gathering dimness shoreward, came a hail. It struck him with\r\nan icy chill that death could never have brought. She raised her head,\r\nlistening. The longing and temptation to hold her to his breast, and\r\nsink down through the green, curling waves, came back stronger than\r\never. Only so could he hope to keep her. That inexorable future of time\r\nreaching out to grasp him back again, would put them apart so\r\nhopelessly. His voice was hoarse--broken up with the heart wrench.\r\n\r\n'Marguerite, will you die here with me, or go back again to the life\r\nthat will separate us?'\r\n\r\nShe did not understand him. Why should she? Did she not love him, and he\r\nher? and what _could_ come between them? For her a future burst suddenly\r\ninto hope with that faint call. In it lay untried, unfathomable sources\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nAnother breathless kiss--this time crowded with the agony of a parting\r\nfor him--and then, as the hail came again, nearer and more distinct, the\r\nwhite shawl, that still clung about her, floated in the air as a signal.\r\n\r\nThey lifted her into the rescuing boat shortly, white and breathless,\r\nand wrapped her in heavy shawls. Not senseless, lying against his\r\nbreast, the dark eyes opened once to meet his, and the pallid face\r\nnestled a little closer to its resting place. He could not tell if the\r\ntime were long or short, before Nelly's voice broke on his ear.\r\n\r\n'Only a comedy, instead of the tragedy which mother is arranging up at\r\nthe house!'\r\n\r\nThe half-hysterical quaver broke into the woman's refuge of tears, and\r\nsobs with that; and Moore gave up his burden to stronger arms.\r\n\r\n'Up at the house,' Mrs. Morris, busied with her blazing fires and\r\nmultitudinous appliances for any stage of disaster, met them with the\r\nquiet tears that mothers learn to shed, and the reverent 'Thank God!'\r\nthat comes oftenest from mothers' lips.\r\n\r\nAnd the bustle being over, he looked reality and duty straight in the\r\nface. The man was in no sense a coward--_flinch_ was not in him. He came\r\nout on the upper balcony two hours later, with the face of a man over\r\nwhom ten years more of life had gone heavily. A dozen steps away sat\r\nMarguerite--the white heart of a softened glow of light. She came out at\r\nhis call quiet and stately, but with a kind of shy happiness touching\r\neye and cheek with light and flame. At sight of her, all the mad passion\r\nin his heart leaped up--a groan came in place of the words he had\r\npromised himself. He strode away with heavy, hard footfalls. Not\r\nstrange, since he was trampling Satan and his own heart under his feet.\r\nHe came back again, quickly, eagerly, as a man forcing himself forward\r\nto a mortal sacrifice, who feels that resolution may fail. The words\r\nthat came finally were half a groan, half an imprecation, hissed through\r\nclenched teeth.\r\n\r\n'Three years ago, a Louisiana lady promised to be my wife. She is not\r\ndead; the engagement is not broken.'\r\n\r\nThere were no words beyond the plain statement of facts that he had any\r\nright to use--harsh and brutal though they seemed. Seen in the\r\nearth-light that had broken on him with that rescuing hail, he had acted\r\nthe coward and villain. If she thought him so, he had no right to demur.\r\n\r\nThere was no need of other words. The eyes, after their first terrified\r\nglance, had fixed themselves out on the night, and then the lids fell,\r\nand the wondering, stunned look changed slowly into one of perfect\r\ncomprehension. Not a muscle moved. The present, leaping forward, laid\r\nbefore her the future, scorched and seared, beyond possibility of bloom\r\nagain. She looked into it with just the same attitude--even to the\r\ntapering fingers laid lightly on the railing--as five minutes before she\r\nhad dreamed over a land of promise. He, looking down on her white\r\nface--whiter in the silver powder of the moonlight--saw a look of utter,\r\nhopeless quiet settle there--such quiet as one sees in an unclosed\r\ncoffin, such marble, impassive calm, neither reproachful nor grieving,\r\nas covers deadly wounds--settle never again to rise till Death shall\r\nsweep it off. Some lives are stamped at once and forever; and faces\r\ngather in an hour the look that haunts them for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nThen he knew that no one ever bears the consequences of a sin alone. On\r\nthis woman, for whom he would have gone to death, he had drawn down the\r\ncurse. He was powerless to help her; all that he could give--the promise\r\nof lifelong love and tenderness--was itself a deadly wrong--would blast\r\nhis life in giving, hers in receiving. In the minutes that he stood\r\nthere, gazing into her face, all the waves and billows of bitterest\r\nrealization of helplessness went over his heart.\r\n\r\nShe turned to go away. 'Marguerite!' The man's despairing soul, his\r\nbitter struggles and failures, atoned for in this last agony, made\r\nitself utterance in that one cry. She turned back, without looking up;\r\neven his eager gaze could not force up the heavy lids. Then, with that\r\nsweet, miraculous woman's grace of patience and pity, she put out her\r\nhand, and as he bowed his head over it, touched her lips to his cheek\r\nwith quick, light contact, and glided away.\r\n\r\nEarliest morning shimmered lances of gray, ghostly light on the horizon,\r\nand across the sea to the waiting shore. They struck grayest and\r\nghostliest on a high balcony, where a woman's figure crouched, swathed\r\nin damp, trailing drapery, with silky, falling hair about a still face,\r\nand steadfast eyes that had burned just as steadfastly through the long\r\nhours gone by. Great, calm stars, circling slowly, had slipped out of\r\nsight into the waves; the restless, grieving ocean had swayed all night\r\nwith heavy beat against the beach; mysterious whisperings had stirred\r\nthe broad summer leaves, heavy with dew and moonlight; faint night\r\nnoises had drifted up to her, leaving the silence unrippled by an echo;\r\ntill the old moon dropped a wasted, blood-red crescent out of sight, and\r\nthe world, exhausted with the passion of the yearning night, shrouded\r\nitself in the gloom and quiet that comes before the dawn.\r\n\r\nTo the watcher, who, with strained, unconscious attention, had taken in\r\nevery change of the night, the promise of the day came almost as a\r\npersonal wrong. That the glare of the sunshine should fall on her\r\npain--that the necessity for meeting mere acquaintances with the same\r\nface as yesterday should exist, now that her life lay so scorched and\r\nsere before her, filled her with rebellious impatience.\r\n\r\nBut when, with the growing light, the first sounds of household waking\r\ncame to her, she rose wearily, and went, with tired, heavy steps to her\r\nown room. And Nelly, coming in half an hour later, with an indefinite\r\nsense of uneasiness, found an older face than last evening's on the\r\npillow, with harder lines about the mouth, and with a wearier droop of\r\nthe eyelids. The voice, too, that answered her good morning, had a kind\r\nof echoing dreariness in it. But such traces are not patent to many eyes\r\nor ears, and Nelly did not realize them.\r\n\r\nThere are a few women, mostly of this dark, slender type, who bear these\r\nwrenching heart agonies as some animals bear extremest suffering of\r\nbody--not a sound or struggle testifies to pain--receiving blow after\r\nblow without hope or thought of appeal--going off by and by to die, or\r\nto suffer back to life alone. Not much merit in it, perhaps--a passive,\r\nhopeless endurance of an inevitable torture; but such tortures warp or\r\nshape a lifetime. Rarely ever eyes that have watched out such a night\r\nsee the sun rise with its old promise.\r\n\r\nClement Moore, coming slowly back to life after a fortnight of delirium,\r\nfound the woods ablaze with October, and Miss Berkeley gone. Another\r\nfortnight, and he was with his regiment. Captain George--off on some\r\nscouting expedition--was not in camp to meet him. But stretched out on\r\nthe dry turf a night or two after, through the clash of the band on the\r\nhillside above broke Captain George's sonorous voice, and straightway\r\nfollowed such a catalogue of questions as dwellers in camps have always\r\nready to propound to the latest comer from the northward. Concluding\r\nfinally with--\r\n\r\n'And you didn't fall in love with 'the princess'?' Poor Captain George!\r\nThe prodigious effort _ought_ to have kept the heart throb out of his\r\nvoice, though it didn't. Moore's quick ear caught it (sympathy has a\r\nwonderfully quickening effect on the perceptions sometimes), and he took\r\nrefuge in a truth that in no way touched the past few months--feeling\r\nlike a coward and traitor meanwhile, and yet utterly helpless to save\r\neither himself or his friend from coming evil. Another item added to\r\nretributive justice.\r\n\r\n'I thought you knew'--flashing the diamond on his hand in the\r\nmoonlight--'somewhere beyond the lines yonder a lady wears the companion\r\nto this--or did, last spring.'\r\n\r\nAnd George's spirits rose immensely thereupon.\r\n\r\nThe old, miserable monotony of camp life began again. It wore on him,\r\nthis machine-like existence, this blind, unquestioning obedience, days\r\nand nights of purposeless waiting, brightened by neither hope nor\r\nmemory. He had hated it before; now he loathed it with the whole\r\nstrength of his unrestful soul. But it did him good. Brought face to\r\nface with his life, he met the chances of his future like the man he\r\nwas, and at last, out of the blackness end desolation, came the comfort\r\nof conquering small, every-day temptations, more of a comfort than we\r\nare willing to admit at first thought.\r\n\r\nThis bare, unbroken life cuts straight down to the marrow of a man.\r\nStripped of all conventionalities, individuals come out broadly. The\r\ntrue metal shows itself grandly in this strange, impartial throwing\r\ntogether of social elements--this commingling on one level of all ranks\r\nand conditions of men in the same broad glare of every-day trial,\r\nunmodified by any of society's false lights. The factitious barriers of\r\nrank once broken over, all early associations, whether of workshop or\r\ncollege, go for nought, or, rather, for what they are worth. The _man_\r\ngravitates to his proper place, whether he makes himself known with the\r\npolished sentences of the school, or in terse, sinewy, workman's talk.\r\nAnd through the months Moore learned to respect humanity as it showed\r\nitself, made gentler to every one, driven out from himself, perhaps, by\r\nthe bitterness and darkness that centred in his own heart. It was a new\r\nphase of life for him, but he bated his haughty Southern exclusiveness\r\nto meet it. Before, he had kept himself aloof as far as the surroundings\r\nallowed from those about him--now, his never-failing good nature, his\r\nflow of song and story, his untiring physical endurance, all upborne by\r\na certain proud delicacy and reticence, made him a general favorite. But\r\nhe hailed as a relief the long, exhausting marches that came after a\r\nwhile. Bodily weariness stood in the place of head or heart exercise,\r\nand men falling asleep on the spot where they halted for the night,\r\nafter a day in the clinging Virginia mud, had little time for the noisy\r\noutbreaks that filled the evenings in days of inaction. So he did his\r\nprivate's duty bravely, with cheery patience, relieving many a slender\r\nboy's arms of his gun, helping many another with words of cheer as he\r\nslumped on at his side, always with some device for making their dreary\r\nnight-stops more endurable. Thanksgiving came and went. George went\r\nhome on furlough. Moore refused one, and ate the day's extra allowance\r\nof tough beef and insipid rice with much fought-against memories of his\r\nNew England festivals. The winter went on. Christmas days came. The\r\nman's brown face was getting positively thinner with homesick\r\nrecollections of the Southern carnival. This brilliant, ready spirit,\r\nwho never grew sour nor selfish under any circumstances, actually spent\r\ntwo good hours, the afternoon before Christmas day, in a brown study,\r\nand with a suspicious, tightened feeling in his throat, and mistiness in\r\nhis eyes. Coming in at nightfall from his picket duty, tired and hungry,\r\nJim Murphy, stretching his long length before the fire, rose on his\r\nelbow to find half a dozen epistles he had brought down to camp that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n'Yer letthers, Musther Moore.' Jim, even with his sudden accession of\r\nindependence as an American citizen, paid unconscious deference to the\r\nworld-old subtile difference between gentleman and 'rough,' and used the\r\ntitle involuntarily.\r\n\r\nHe opened them sitting by the same fire, munching his hard tack as he\r\nread. Murphy, watching him, saw his lips quiver and work over one\r\nbearing half a dozen postmarks--a letter from his mother, conveyed\r\nacross the lines by some sleight-of-hand of influence or pay, and mailed\r\nand remailed from place to place, till weeks had grown into months since\r\nit was written. Noncommittal as it had need to be--filled with home\r\nitems to the last page--there his heart stood still, to bound again\r\nfuriously back, and his breath came sharp and hot. He rose blinded and\r\nstaggering. Jim Murphy, seeing how white and rigid his face had grown,\r\ncame toward him, putting out his hand with a dumb impulse of sympathy,\r\nnot understanding how the shock of a great hope, springing full grown\r\ninto existence, sometimes puts on the semblance of as great a loss.\r\n\r\nPrivate Moore's application for a furlough being duly made, that night\r\nwas duly granted.\r\n\r\n'Just in time--the last one for your regiment!' said the good-natured\r\nofficial, registering the necessary items.\r\n\r\nIn another hour he was whirling away, and in early evening two days\r\nlater he stepped out into the clear moonlight and crisp air of a\r\nNorthern city.\r\n\r\nA New England sleighing season was at its height. The streets were\r\ncrowded with swift-flying graceful vehicles, the air ringing with bell\r\nmusic and chimes of voices. Out through the brilliant confusion he went\r\nto the quiet square where the great trees laid a dark tracery of shadow\r\nupon the snow beneath. No thought of the accidents of absence or\r\ncompany, or any of the chances of everyday life, had occurred to him\r\nbefore. A carriage stood at the door. He almost stamped with impatience\r\ntill the door opened and he was admitted. The change to the warm,\r\nluxurious gloom of the parlors quieted him a little, but he paced up and\r\ndown with long strides while he waited. The strong stillness that he had\r\nresolutely maintained was broken down now with a feverish restlessness.\r\n\r\nShe came at length--it seemed to him forever first--with the rustle and\r\nshimmer of trailing lengths of silk down the long room. A fleecy mist\r\ncovered neck and arms, and some miracle of a carriage wrapping lay white\r\nand soft about her face. She did not recognize him in the obscurity; his\r\nmessage of 'a friend' had not betrayed him. But his voice, with its new,\r\nproud hopefulness, its under vein triumphant and eager, struck her into\r\na blinding, giddy whirl, in which voice and words were lost. It passed\r\nin a moment, and he was saying, 'And I am free now--honorably free--and\r\nhave come where my heart has been, ever since that month on the seaside.\r\nMost gracious and sovereign lady,'--he broke into sudden, almost\r\nmirthful speech, dropping on one knee with a semblance of humility\r\nproved no mockery by the diamond light in the brown eyes and the\r\nreverent throb that came straight from his voice.\r\n\r\nShe bent over him as he knelt, and drew her cool, soft hands across his\r\nforehead and down his face, and her even, silvery syllables cut like\r\ndeath:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Moore, last night I promised to marry your friend, Captain Morris.'\r\n\r\nFor the space of a minute stillness like the grave filled the room, and\r\nthen all the intense strain of heart and nerve gave way, as the bitter\r\ntide of disappointment broke in and rolled over his future; and without\r\nword or sound he dropped forward at her feet.\r\n\r\nShe knelt down beside him with a low, bitter cry. It reached his dulled\r\nsense; he rose feebly.\r\n\r\n'Forgive me; I have not been myself of late, I think; and this--this was\r\nso sudden,' and he walked away with dull, nerveless tread.\r\n\r\nOn the table, near her, lay her handkerchief. It breathed of heliotrope.\r\nHer words came back to him: 'Only in coffins, about still, dead faces.'\r\nHe stopped in his walk and looked down on her. Forever he should\r\nremember all that ghostly sheen of silvery white about a rigid face with\r\nunutterably sad fixed mouth and drooping lids. He thrust the fleecy\r\nhandful into his breast.\r\n\r\n'I may keep this?' and took permission from her silence.\r\n\r\n'Good-by;' the words came through ashy lips, a half sob. She knelt as\r\nimpassive as marble, as cold and white. He waited a moment for the word\r\nor look that did not come, turned away, the hall door fell heavily shut,\r\nand he was gone.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes after, Miss Berkeley was whirling to the house where she\r\nwas to officiate as bridesmaid, and where she was haughtier, and colder,\r\nand ten times more attractive than ever.\r\n\r\nPrivate Moore, waiting for the midnight return train, found life a grim\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after, a summons came from the captain's tent. George had\r\njust returned from his own furlough, and this was their first meeting.\r\nEven while their hands clasped, his new, happy secret told itself.\r\n\r\n'Congratulate me, Clement Moore! You remember Lois Berkeley? She has\r\npromised to be Lois Berkeley Morris one day!' and, with happy lover's\r\negotism, did not notice the gray shade about his hearer's lips.\r\n\r\nVarious items of news followed.\r\n\r\n'A truce boat goes over to-morrow,' remembering the fact suddenly;\r\n'there will be opportunity to send a few letters; so, if you wish to\r\nwrite to that lady 'beyond the lines'--\r\n\r\nThe voice that replied was thin and harsh:\r\n\r\n'Miss Rose declined alliance with a 'Yankee hireling,' and was married\r\nlast October.'\r\n\r\nHonest George wrung his friend's hand anew, and heaped mental anathemas\r\non his own stupidity for not seeing how haggard and worn the dark face\r\nhad grown--anathemas which were just enough, perhaps, only he hardly saw\r\nthe reason in quite the right light. But he spared all allusions to his\r\nown prospects thereafter, and finding that Moore rather avoided than\r\nsought him, measured and forgave the supposed cause by his own heart.\r\n\r\nAt length came a time when a new life and impulse roused into action\r\neven that slowly moved great body, the officers of the Potomac Army, and\r\nthat much-abused and sorely tried insignificant item, the army itself.\r\nOn every camp ground reigned the confusion of a flitting. All the roads\r\nwere filled with regiments hurrying southward, faces growing more and\r\nmore hazard with fatigue and privation, weak and slender forms falling\r\nfrom the ranks, cowards and traitors skulking to the rear, till at\r\nlength on the banks of the river stood an army, hungry, footsore,\r\nmarchworn, but plucky, and ready for any service that might be required\r\nof them, even if that service were but to 'march up the hill and then\r\nmarch down again'--what was left of them.\r\n\r\nAn atom in the moving mass of blue, Clement Moore shared the pontoon\r\ncrossing, was silent through the storms of cheers that greeted each\r\nregiment as they splashed over and up the bank, and, drawn up in line of\r\nbattle at last, surveyed the field without a pulsation of emotion. Other\r\nmen about him chafed at the restraint; he stood motionless, with eyes a\r\nthousand miles away. And when the advance sounded, and the line started\r\nwith a cheer, no sound passed his lips. A half-unconscious prayer went\r\nup that he might fall there, and have it over with this life battle,\r\nthat had gone so sorely against him. He moved as in a dream. The whirl\r\nand roar of battle swept around and by him; he charged with the\r\nfiercest, saw the blue lines reel and break only to close up and charge\r\nagain, took his life in his hand a dozen times, and stood at length with\r\nthe few who held that first line of rifle pits, gazing in each other's\r\nfaces in the momentary lull, and wondering at their own existence. Then\r\ncame a shock, shivers of red-hot pain ran through every nerve, and\r\nthen--blissful, cool unconsciousness. Captain George, galloping by, with\r\nthe red glare of battle on his face, saw the fall, and halted. A half\r\ndozen ready hands swung the body to his saddle. For a little the tide of\r\nbattle eddied away, and in the comparative quiet, George tore down the\r\nhill to a spring bubbling out under the cedars.\r\n\r\nThe darkness that wrapped the wounded man dissolved gradually. The\r\nthunder and crash of guns, the mad cheers, the confusion of the bands\r\nwithdrew farther and farther, and drifted away from his failing senses.\r\nHe was back in his Southern home; the arm under his head was his\r\nmother's; and he murmured some boyish request. Jasmine and clematis\r\noppressed him with their oversweetness; overhead the shining leaves of\r\nthe magnolia swung with slow grace. So long since he had seen a\r\nmagnolia, not since that evening--a life time ago, it seemed; the sight\r\nand fragrance fell on him as her cool touch did that last time. The\r\nheart throbs choked him then; he was choking again. 'Water, mother--a\r\ndrink!' and something wet his lips and trickled down his throat, not\r\ncool and sweet as the rippling water he longed for, and he turned away\r\nwith sickly fretfulness; but a new strength thrilled through his limbs.\r\nHe opened his eyes; a face, battle-stained, but tear-wet like a woman's,\r\nbent over him.\r\n\r\n'O Clement, dear old fellow, do you know me?'\r\n\r\nHe smiled faintly, with stiffening lips. 'Yes, I know. I've prayed for\r\nit, George. I couldn't live to see her your wife. Good-by, dear boy.\r\nTell mother--' He wandered again. 'Kiss me, mother--now Lois, my\r\nMarguerite. Into thy hands, O Lord--' A momentary struggle for breath,\r\nand then Morris laid back the grand head, and knelt, looking down on the\r\nbeautiful face, over which the patient strength of perfect calm had\r\nsettled forever.\r\n\r\n'So that was it, after all,' he said, bitterly. 'Fool not to see; and he\r\nwas worth a generation of such as I.'\r\n\r\nHe turned away, tightened his saddle girths, cast a look on the\r\npandemonium before him, looked back with one foot already in the\r\nstirrup.\r\n\r\n'I sha'n't see him again in this hell, even if I come out of it myself.'\r\nAnd going back, with gentle fingers he removed the few trinkets on the\r\nbody. In an inner pocket of the blouse he found a small packet. He\r\nopened it on the spot. A lady's handkerchief, silky fine, white as ever.\r\nNo need of the delicate tracery in the corners to tell him whose. The\r\nperfume that haunted it still called back too vividly that evening when\r\nhe had wondered at and loved her more for the strange, perfect calm that\r\nchilled a little his outburst of happiness. He folded it back carefully,\r\ntouched his lips as a woman might have done to the cold forehead, and\r\nmounted, plunging up the hill to the fight that had recommenced over the\r\ntrench. Later in the day, the ball that fate moulded for Captain George\r\nfound him. He gave one low, pitiful cry as it crashed through his bridle\r\narm, and then a merciful darkness closed about him.\r\n\r\nTwo months after, white and thin, with one empty sleeve fastened across\r\nhis chest, he stood where another had stood waiting for the same woman.\r\nThrough the window drifted in the early spring fragrance; a handful of\r\nearly spring flowers lay on the table. A soft rustle and slow step\r\nthrough the hall, and he rose as Lois came in. She glanced at the empty\r\nsleeve with grave, wide eyes, and sat down near him. He would not have\r\nknown the face before him, it had so altered; the hair pushed back from\r\nhollow, blue-veined temples, the sharpened, angular outlines, and an\r\nold, suffering look about the mouth and sunken eyes.\r\n\r\nFew words were spoken--nothing beyond the most commonplace greetings.\r\nThen she said:\r\n\r\n'I should have come to you, but I have been ill myself; near death, I\r\nbelieve,' she added, wearily.\r\n\r\nShe gave the explanation with no throb of feeling. She would have\r\napologized for a careless dress with more spirit once.\r\n\r\nHe rose and laid a packet before her.\r\n\r\n'A lady's handkerchief--yours, I think. I was with him when he died,\r\nthough his body was not found afterward. I was hurt myself, you know,\r\nand could not attend to it,' he said, deprecatingly.\r\n\r\nShe did not touch it, looking from it up to him with eyes filled with\r\njust such a grieved, questioning look as might come into the eyes of\r\nsome animal dying in torture. He could not endure it. He put out his\r\nwhite, wasted left hand.\r\n\r\n'My poor child!' She shivered, caught her breath with a sob, and,\r\nburying her face in the pillows of a couch, gave way to her first tears\r\nin an agony of weeping. And he sat apart, not daring to touch her, nor\r\nto speak--wishing, with unavailing bitterness, that it had been he who\r\nwas left lying stark and still beneath the cedars.\r\n\r\nThe storm passed. She lay quiet now, all but the sobs that shook her\r\nwhole slight frame. He said, at last, very gently:\r\n\r\n'If I had known--you should have told me. He was my best friend.' His\r\nvoice trembled a little. 'I know how I must seem to you. His murderer,\r\nperhaps; surely the murderer of your happiness.' A deeper quaver in the\r\nsorrowful tones. 'It is too late now, I know; but if it would help you\r\never so little to be released from your promise--'\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n'You are free. I am going now.' He bent over her for a breath, making a\r\nheart picture of the tired face, the closed eyes, and grieved mouth.\r\nOnly to take her up for a moment, with power to comfort her--he would\r\nhave given his life for that--and turned away with a great, yearning\r\npain snatching at his breath. In the hall he paused a moment, trying to\r\nthink. A light step, a frail hand on his arm, a wistful face lifted to\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n'Forgive me; I have been very unkind. You are so good and noble. I will\r\nbe your wife, if you will be any happier.'\r\n\r\nHe looked down at her pityingly. 'You are very tired. Shall you say that\r\nwhen you are rested again? Remember, you are free.'\r\n\r\n'If not yours, then never any one's.'\r\n\r\nHis arm fell about her, his lips touched her forehead quietly; he led\r\nher back to her couch, and arranged her pillow, smiling a little at his\r\none awkward hand.\r\n\r\n'I shall not see you again before I go back, unless you send for me.'\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand and touched the bowed face quickly and lightly; and\r\nwith that touch thrilling in his veins he went away.\r\n\r\nThrough Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and the Charleston siege, Captain\r\nGeorge, no longer captain, now twice promoted for cool bravery, has\r\nborne a charmed life--a grave, calm man, remembering always a still\r\nface, 'pathetic with dying.'\r\n\r\nOut from the future is turned toward him another face, no less pathetic\r\nin its unrest of living. The soldiers in the Capital hospitals, dragging\r\nthrough the weary weeks of convalescence, know that face well. For hours\r\nof every day she goes about busied with such voluntary service as she is\r\npermitted to do. She sees tired faces brighten at her coming--is\r\nwelcomed by rough and gentle voices. Always patient, ready, thoughtful,\r\nshe is 'spending' herself--waiting for the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE: ITS CHARACTER AND RELATION TO OTHER\r\nLANGUAGES.\r\n\r\n_ARTICLE TWO._\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDING FIRST DISCRIMINATIONS IN THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these papers, as announced and partially carried forward\r\nin the preceding one, is to explain the nature of the NEW SCIENTIFIC\r\nUNIVERSAL LANGUAGE, a component part of the new Science of UNIVERSOLOGY,\r\nand to exhibit its relation to the Lingual Structures hitherto extant.\r\nFor this purpose we entered upon the necessary preliminary consideration\r\nof the fundamental question of the Origin of Speech. We found that the\r\nlatest developments of Comparative Philology upon this subject, as\r\nembodied in Prof. Mueller's recent work, 'Lectures on the Science of\r\nLanguage,' brought us no farther along to the goal of our investigation\r\nthan Compound Roots--one-, two-, three-, four-, five--(or more) letter\r\nRoots--some four or five hundred of which are the insoluble residuum\r\nwhich the Philologists furnish as the Ultimate Elements of Language. It\r\nwas pointed out that these Roots are not, however, the _Ultimate_\r\nElements of Language, any more than Compound Substances are the Prime\r\nConstituents of Matter; and that, as Chemistry, as a Science, could\r\nbegin its career, only after a knowledge of the veritable Ultimate\r\nElements of the Physical Constitution of the Globe was obtained, so a\r\n_True Science of Language_ must be based upon an understanding of the\r\nvalue and meaning of the True Prime or Ultimate Elements of Speech--the\r\n_Vowels_ and _Consonants_.\r\n\r\nIt is with the exposition of the nature of these Fundamental\r\nConstituents of Language, and of their Correspondential Relationship or\r\n_Analogy_ with the Fundamental Constituents of Thought, the Ultimate\r\nRational Conceptions of the Mind, that the New UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE begins\r\nits developments. Through its agency we may hope to find, therefore, a\r\nsatisfactory solution to the problem of the Origin of Speech, which\r\nComparative Philology abandons at the critical point, and so to be able\r\nto pass to the consideration of the more specific objects of our present\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUNIVERSOLOGY establishes the fact that there is Analogy or Repetition of\r\nPlan throughout the various Departments of the Universe. It\r\ndemonstrates, in other words, that the same Principles which generate,\r\nand the same Laws which regulate, the Phenomena of the Universe as a\r\nwhole, fulfil the same functions in connection with the Phenomena of\r\nevery one of its parts. The Mathematical, Psychological, or any other\r\nspecific Domain is, therefore, an expression or embodiment of the same\r\nSystem of Principles and Laws, with reference to both Generals and\r\nDetails, which is otherwise exhibited in Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry,\r\nand elsewhere universally; just as the same Architectural Plan may be\r\nvariously employed in constructions of different size, material, color,\r\nmodes of ornamentation, etc.; and may be modified to suit the\r\nrequirements of each individual construction. To every Elementary Form\r\nof _Thought_ there is, consequently, a corresponding and related Law of\r\n_Number_, of _Form_, of _Color_, of _Chemical_ Constitution, and of\r\n_Oral Sound_ or _Speech_. Every Basic Idea, to state it otherwise,\r\npertaining to the Universe at large or to any of its Divisions, has its\r\ncounterpart or double in every other Division. Or, to express it yet\r\nanother way: the manifold, diverse, and unlike Appearances or Phenomena\r\nwhich the Universe presents to our understanding, are not _radically_\r\nand _essentially_ different; but are the same Typal Ideas or Thoughts of\r\nGod or of Nature, arrayed in various garbs, and, hence, assuming varying\r\npresentations. The Numerical _Unit_, the Geometrical _Point_, the\r\nWritten _Dot_, the _Globule_, the Chemical _Atom_, the Physical\r\n_Molecule_, the Physiological _Granule_, the _Yod_ or _Iota_, the least\r\nElement of Sound, are, for example, _Identical Types_, differently\r\nmodified or clothed upon in accordance with the medium through which\r\nthey are to be _phenomenally_ presented. It is with this _Echo_ or\r\nRepetitory Relationship, existing between all the Domains of the\r\nUniverse, but more particularly as exhibited between the two Domains of\r\n_Ideas_ and _Language_, that we are at present concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficiently obvious that Analogy should be sought for first, in\r\nthe _Generals_ of any department under examination, and, subsequently,\r\nthrough them, in the _Particulars_. In respect to the two Domains now\r\nunder special consideration, this relation is between the Fundamental\r\nElements of Thought, including those called by the Philosophers the\r\nCategories of the Understanding, and the Fundamental Elements of\r\nLanguage. In pointing out the Correspondence subsisting between the\r\nElements of these two Domains, I shall use, partly by way of\r\ncondensation, and partly by copious extracts, the Elaborate Expositions\r\ncontained in the yet unpublished text books of Universology. And, as\r\nwhat follows relating to this subject will consist, almost wholly, of\r\nthis material, I do not deem it essential to encumber the page with\r\nnumerous and unnecessary quotation marks. It is advisable to caution the\r\nReader, however, that as my present purpose is explanation and\r\nillustration only, and not formal demonstration, what is about to be\r\ngiven will be mostly in the nature of mere statement, unaccompanied by\r\nany other evidence of its truthfulness than may be found in the\r\nself-supporting reasonableness of the statements themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the basic and axiomatic proposition of Hegel's Philosophy, that\r\nthe first discrimination of Thought and Being in any sphere is into two\r\nfactors, a _Something_ and a _Nothing_;--that which constitutes the\r\n_main_ or _predominant_ element of the Conception or Creation, and that\r\nwhich we endeavor to exclude from contemplation or activity, but which,\r\nnevertheless, by virtue of the impossibility of _perfect_ or _absolute_\r\nabstraction, inevitably becomes a _minor_ or _subordinate_ element in\r\nthe Idea or the Act which may be engaging the attention. _Something_ and\r\n_Nothing_ are also averred to be _equal_ factors in the Constitution of\r\nThoughts or Things, because both are alike indispensable to the\r\ncognition of either; because, in other words, it is only by the presence\r\nof the _Nothing_ as a _background_ or _contrasting_ element, that the\r\n_Something_ has an independent or cognizable existence. If there were no\r\nblank space, for instance, there could be no Moon, relatively, or so far\r\nas our ability to perceive it is concerned. For the Moon is, in this\r\nillustration, a _Something_ which is visible to us, and of which we have\r\na knowledge, only by reason of the fact that it is surrounded by and\r\ncontrasted with that which is _not_ Moon, and which, in reference to the\r\nparticular aspect under consideration is, therefore, a _Nothing_; though\r\nit in turn may be a _Something_ or main object of attention in some\r\nother view or conception, where some other factor shall be the Nothing.\r\n\r\nThat this Relationship of Antithesis and Rank existed, as between the\r\nConstituents of some Thoughts or Things, was known from the earliest\r\ntimes, and gave rise to the terms _Positive_ and _Negative_, expressive\r\nof it. But Hegel was the first--of modern Philosophers, at least--to\r\npoint out its necessarily _Universal_ and fundamental character, and to\r\nassume it as the starting-point in the development of all Philosophy and\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the investigation of the Universe from the\r\n_Philosophical_ point of view (which is the less precise and definite\r\naspect), Hegel is right in affirming that the first discrimination of\r\nall Thought and Being is that between _Something_ and _Nothing_. But he\r\nis wrong in regarding the starting-point or first differentiation of\r\n_Science_, as being identical with that of _Philosophy_. Science\r\nconsiders, primarily and predominantly, the more exact and rigorous\r\nrelations of Phenomena; and the existence of an _exact_ and _definite_\r\npoint of departure in Thought and Being, more fundamental, from the\r\nScientific or rigorously precise point of view, than that of Hegel, is\r\nthe initiatory proposition of UNIVERSOLOGY.\r\n\r\nA full explanation of the nature of this Starting-point is not, however,\r\nin place here. And as the discrimination into _Something_ and _Nothing_\r\nserves all the purposes of our present inquiry, a single word respecting\r\nthe character of the Universological Point of Departure in question is\r\nall that it is now necessary to say concerning it.\r\n\r\nThis Starting-point of Thought and Action has reference to the Ideas of\r\n_Oneness_ (Primitive Unity) and _Twoness_ (Plurality). These conceptions\r\ngive rise to _two_ Primordial Principles, which form the basis of the\r\ndevelopment of UNIVERSOLOGY, and which are fundamental in every\r\nDepartment of the Universe and in the Universe as a whole, namely: _The\r\nPrinciple of Unism_ (from the Latin _unus_, _one_), the _Spirit_ of the\r\nNumber _One_, the Principle of _Undifferentiated_, _Unanalyzed_,\r\n_Agglomerative_ Unity; and _The Principle of_ DUISM (from the Latin\r\n_duo_, _two_), the _Spirit_ of the Number _Two_, the Principle of\r\n_Differentiation_, _Analysis_, _Separation_, _Apartness_, or\r\n_Plurality_, typically embodied in _Two_, the first division of the\r\nPrimitive Unity, and especially representative of the Principle of\r\nDisunity, the essence of all division or plurality. _One_, in the Domain\r\nof _Number_, and UNISM, in the Department of Primordial Principles,\r\ncorrespond, it must be added, with _The Absolute_ (the Undifferentiated\r\nand Unconditioned), as one of the Aspects of Being; while _Two_, in the\r\nDomain of _Number_, and _Duism_, among Primordial Principles, are allied\r\nwith _The Relative_ (the Differentiated and Conditioned), of which\r\nlatter Domain _Something_ and _Nothing_ are the two Prime Factors. The\r\ndistinction between _One_ and _Two_, or their analogous Aspects of\r\nBeing, _Absolute_ and _Relative_, is, therefore, prior to that between\r\n_Something_ and _Nothing_, because _Something_ and _Nothing_ are two\r\nterms of _The Relative_ (_Two_), which has first to be itself\r\ndiscriminated from _The Absolute_ (_One_) before it can be sub-divided\r\ninto these two factors.\r\n\r\nWhile the nature of this discrimination into _Something_ and _Nothing_\r\nmay be sufficiently intelligible to the student of Metaphysics, it may\r\nnot be so to the Reader unaccustomed to Philosophical Speculation. For\r\nthe purpose, therefore, of rendering it somewhat clearer, I will point\r\nout the manner in which it exhibits itself in respect to the\r\nConstitution of the External World and elsewise.\r\n\r\nThe Totality of all material objects and substances is the _Positive_\r\nMaterial Universe. This is contained in _Space_, which is the _Negative_\r\nMaterial Universe. Compoundly the two, _Matter_ and _Space_, are the\r\nwhole Material Universe, as to the Parts or Constituent Factors of which\r\nit consists.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, and in one, and by no means an unimportant sense, the\r\n_Zero_-Element or _Nothing_-side of the Universe or of a given\r\nDepartment of Being, is one whole half, or an equal hemisphere of the\r\nTotality of Being. Thus, for example, _Zero_ (0) in the usage of the\r\nArabic Numbers, while it is represented in an obscure way merely by a\r\nsingle figure below the nine digits, yet stands over, in a sense,\r\nagainst all the digits, and all their possible combinations, as equal to\r\nthem all in importance. For it is by means of this _Zero_ (0) that the\r\nOne (1) for instance, becomes 10, 100, 1000, etc.; and that all the\r\n_Positive_ Numbers acquire their relative values, according to the\r\nplaces or positions in space which they occupy.\r\n\r\nIn another sense, however, the Negative Ground of Being, in the Universe\r\nat large, or in any given Domain, quickly sinks out of view, and\r\nPositive Being becomes the whole of what is commonly regarded. It is in\r\nthis sense that, ordinarily, in speaking of The Digits of Number, the\r\n_Zero_ is left out of the count.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, when speaking or thinking of the Material Universe,\r\nwhile the notion of _Space_ is ever present, and is, in the absolute\r\nsense, an equal half of the whole conception, still it is Matter, the\r\ntotal congeries of objects and substances in Space, of which we mainly\r\nthink; the Space, as such, being understood and implied, but\r\nsubordinated as a mere _negative_ adjunct of the _positive_ idea.\r\n\r\nIn strictness, _Matter_ and _Space_ are so mutually dependent on each\r\nother, that either without the other is an impossible conception. The\r\nnotion of Space permeates that of Matter; passing through it, so to\r\nspeak, as well as surrounding it; so that it needs no proof that Matter\r\ncannot be conceived of as existing without Space. But, on the other\r\nhand, Space is only the negation of Matter; the shadow, as it were, cast\r\nby Matter; and, so, dependent on Matter for the very origin of the idea\r\nin the mind.\r\n\r\nIf _Space_, therefore, be the analogue of _Nothing_; _Matter_, wholly\r\napart from Space, is only a _theoretical_ Something, really and actually\r\nas much a Nothing as Space itself, when abstractly considered in its\r\nequally impossible separation from Matter. But Matter, completely\r\nseparated from Space, is the exact external analogue of the _Something_\r\nopposed to the _Nothing_ of abstract Metaphysical Thinking. Here, then,\r\nis a lucid exposition, by virtue of these analogies, of the famous\r\nMetaphysical Axiom of Hegel, which, at its announcement, threw all\r\nEurope into amazement:\r\n\r\n  _Something_ = (_equal to_) _Nothing_.\r\n\r\nIt is the logic of this statement that all _Reality_ or Relative Being\r\nis a product of two factors, each of which is a _Nothing_. The\r\nstrangeness of this proposition will disappear when it is recognized\r\nthat these two Nothings are mere aspects or sides of presentation of the\r\nProduct, which is itself the only Reality. In respect to the _Real\r\nBeing_, those two sides are _Nothings_. But, as appearances or ideal\r\nviews of the Reality under the process of analytical abstraction in the\r\nmind, they are so far _Somethings_ as to receive names and to be treated\r\nof and considered as _if_ they were _Realities_. _Reality_ in the\r\n_Absolute_ aspect, the aspect of _Undifferentiated Unity_, (Unismal),\r\ncontains these two factors interblended and undiscriminated. In the\r\n_Relative_ aspect, that of _Duality_, (Duismal), it is the compound of\r\nthese two factors separated and distinguished. Finally, in the\r\n_Integral_ aspect of _Compound Unity_ (Trinismal), it consists of the\r\n_Unismal_ and the _Duismal_ aspects contrasted--the only _real_ state,\r\nor possible condition of actual existence. _And this is the Type of all\r\nReality or Real Existence in every department of Being in the Universe._\r\n\r\nBut practically and ordinarily, these strictly analytical views of the\r\nquestion of existence are abandoned. Reality, compounded, as we have\r\nseen that it is when viewed in this way, of a Positive and a Negative\r\nFactor, is assumed as itself a Simple Element and set over against the\r\ngrand residuum of Negation in the Universe of Being. This is what Kant,\r\nless analytical than Hegel, has done, when, in distributing the\r\nCategories of Thought, he has contrasted REALITY with NEGATION.\r\n\r\nThis is, as if, in respect to the External Material World, we were to\r\ndivide Matter--the Planets, for example, first assigning to them the\r\nportions of Space which they bodily and respectively fill as if it were\r\na part of themselves--from the remaining ocean or grand residuum of\r\nSpace which surrounds them and in which they float. This residuum of\r\nSpace would then be spoken of as _Space_, and the Planetary Bodies,\r\n_along with and including the spaces which they fill_, would be spoken\r\nof as _Matter_. This is a kind of division, less analytical, but more\r\nconvenient, obvious, and practical, than the other which would attempt\r\nto separate the whole of Space from the Matter within Space. It is in\r\nthis more practical manner that we _ordinarily_ think of the division of\r\nthe Heavens into the Domains of _Matter_ and _Space_.\r\n\r\nBetween _Reality_, then, including a subordinate portion of Space--the\r\ncontent and volume of the Planet--and the grand ocean of Space, outlying\r\nand surrounding the Planet, there is _Limitation_, the outline of the\r\nPlanet, the _Limit_ or dividing surface between the space within it and\r\nthe space without.\r\n\r\nIt is this Congeries of the Aspects of Being which Kant denominates\r\nQUALITY, as a name of a Group of the Categories of the Understanding;\r\nand which he divides into\r\n\r\n  1. REALITY.\r\n  2. NEGATION.\r\n  3. LIMITATION.\r\n\r\nHe then treats REALITY as synonymous with the _Affirmative_ (Positive),\r\nand NEGATION as synonymous with the _Negative_; although, as we have\r\nseen, this Affirmative is not strictly equivalent to the _Something_ of\r\nHegel, nor this Negative to his _Nothing_. For _Reality_ we may, in a\r\ngeneral sense, put _Substance_, and for _Limitation_ we may put _Form_,\r\nOmitting Negation which repeats the _Nothing_, as Reality repeats the\r\n_Something_, it may now be said that the next Grand Division of the\r\nElements of Universal Being (after that into Something and Nothing) is\r\ninto\r\n\r\n  1. SUBSTANCE. )\r\n                            = 3. EXISTENCE.\r\n  2. FORM.      )\r\n\r\nThat is to say: _The Relative_ (The Domain of Cognizable Being) is first\r\nmade known to us through the _differentiation_ and _discrimination_ of\r\nthe two Factors _Something_ and _Nothing_ which lie _undifferentiated_\r\nand _indistinguishable_ in _The Absolute_ (The Primitive Ground of\r\nBeing). _The Relative_ then subdivides into 1. _Substance_ (Reality),\r\nand, 2. _Form_ (Limitation), which reunite to constitute that actualized\r\nBeing which we denominate _Existence_. Or, tabulated, thus:\r\n\r\n  THE ABSOLUTE (THE PRIMITIVE\r\n  GROUND OF BEING)\r\n  CONTAINS UNDIFFERENTIATED AND INDISTINGUISHABLE\r\n  THE TWO FACTORS\r\n  SOMETHING and NOTHING\r\n  WHICH CONSTITUTE THE FIRST TERMS\r\n  AND DISCRIMINATIONS OF\r\n  THE RELATIVE (THE DOMAIN OF\r\n  COGNIZABLE BEING);\r\n  WHICH ITSELF DIVIDES INTO\r\n  SUBSTANCE (REALITY) and FORM\r\n  (LIMITATION),\r\n  THE PRIME CONSTITUENTS OF\r\n  EXISTENCE.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend the vast importance of these discriminations, it is\r\nnecessary to understand that precisely those Principles of Distribution\r\nwhich are applicable to the Universe at large are found to be applicable\r\nto every minor sphere or domain of the Universe; in the same manner as\r\nthe same Geometrical Laws which prevail in the largest circle prevail\r\nequally in the smallest. It is the prevalence of _Identical Principles_\r\nin _diverse spheres_ which is the source of that Universal Analogy\r\nthroughout _all_ spheres that lies at the basis of UNIVERSOLOGY, and\r\ngives the possibility of such a Science. The nature of this Analogy, as\r\nwell as the value of the discriminations themselves, will be more\r\nclearly seen by glancing at corresponding discriminations in other\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nIn the Constitution of the External World, _Something_ is represented,\r\nas we have seen, by the solid and tangible substance which we call\r\n_Matter_, and _Nothing_ by the Expanse of Space.\r\n\r\nIn the Science of Acoustics, _Sound_, the pure _Phonos_, is the\r\n_Something_, the _Reality_, as it is denominated by Kant, the _Positive_\r\nFactor of Speech. _Silence_ is the relative _Nothing_, the Negation, so\r\ncalled by Kant, the _Negative_ Factor of Speech. The Silences, or\r\nIntervals of Rest which intervene between Sounds (and also between\r\nSyllables, Words, Sentences, and still larger divisions of Speech), are\r\nonly so many successive reappearances of this _negative_ element.\r\nSilence, the Nothing of Sound, is, in fact, in the most radical aspect\r\nof the subject, one entire half or hemisphere or equal Factor of the\r\nwhole of Speech or Music. Josiah Warren, the author of a work entitled\r\n'Music as an Exact Science,' is the only writer I have noticed who has\r\nhad the discrimination _distinctively_ to recognize Silence as one of\r\nthe Elements of the Musical Structure.\r\n\r\n_Impliedly_ it is, however, always so recognized. The Silences\r\nintervening between tones _tunewise_, or in respect to altitude, are, in\r\nMusical Nomenclature, denominated _Intervals_. _Timewise_ Silences, or\r\nthose which intervene between Tones rhythmically considered, are called\r\n_Rests_. The Intervals of Silence between Syllables and Words, in Oral\r\nSpeech, are represented in the printed book by what the Printer calls\r\n_Spaces_, which are _blank_ or _negative_ Types interposed between the\r\npositive Types expressive of Sounds. This term _Space_ or _Spaces_\r\ncarries us to the analogous Total Space or Blank Space and intervening\r\nreaches of Space between the Planets, Orbs or Material Worlds, the\r\nformer the corresponding _Nothing_ of the total Material Universe of\r\nwhich these worlds are the _Something_; as exhibited in the\r\ndemonstrations of UNIVERSOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIn the Domain of Optics, covering the Phenomena of Light, Shade and\r\nColor, _Light_ is the _Positive_ Factor or _Something_, and _Darkness_\r\nthe _Negative_ Factor or _Nothing_. _Light_ is, therefore, the analogue\r\nof _Sound_, and _Darkness_ the analogue of _Silence_. That is to say,\r\neach of these two, Silence and Darkness, denote the absence, the lack,\r\nthe want or the negation of the opposite and _Positive_ Element or\r\nFactor.\r\n\r\nSo in Thermotics, the Science of Heat, _Heat_ itself is the\r\n_Positismus_ or _Something_ of the Domain; and _Cold_ the _Negatismus_\r\nor Correlative _Nothing_. _Heat_ is, consequently, the analogue of\r\n_Sound_ and _Light_; while _Cold_ is the analogue of _Silence_ and\r\n_Darkness_.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the Domain of Mind, _Positive Mental Experience_\r\n(Feelings, Thoughts, and Volitions, including self-consciousness) are\r\nthe _Positive_ Factor, the _Something_ of Mentality. _Inexperience_, the\r\nlack of mental exercitation, hence _Ignorance_, is the _Negative_\r\nFactor, or _Nothing_. The Correspondential Relationship or Analogy\r\nexisting between this Domain of the Universe and others already\r\nmentioned is testified to in a remarkable manner by our use of Language.\r\nWe denominate the want of Feeling _Cold_ or _Frigidity_--in respect to\r\nthe Mind or the individual character. The absence of Thought and\r\nKnowledge, or, in other words, Intellectual Barrenness, is called\r\n_Darkness_ or _Obscurity_ of the Mind. While the lack of Will or Purpose\r\nin the Mind is said to be the absence of _Tension_ or _Strain_ (the\r\ngreat Musical term); and the Stillness or quiet hence resulting may be\r\nappropriately designated as the _Silence_ of the Mind; Musical Silences\r\nbeing, as pointed out above, technically termed Rests.\r\n\r\nWith this superficial exhibition of the most radical aspect of the _Echo\r\nof Idea_ or _Repetition of Type_ which subsists between all the\r\ndepartments of the Universe, I pass to the more specific consideration\r\nof this Analogy as concerning the Domain of Thought and the Domain of\r\nLanguage.\r\n\r\nSetting aside from our present consideration _Silence_, the _Negative_\r\nfactor or _Negatismus_ of Language, and fixing our attention upon\r\n_Sound_, the Positive factor or _Positismus_ of Language, we discover it\r\nto be composed of two constituents, _Vowels_ and _Consonants_.\r\n\r\nThe _Vowel_ is the _Substance_, the Reality of Language, and the\r\n_Consonant_ is the _Form_, the Limitation.\r\n\r\nBy _Vowel_ sound is meant the free or unobstructed, and as such\r\nunlimited flow of the vocalized or sounding breath. Vowels are defined\r\nin the simplest way as those sounds which are uttered with the month\r\nopen; as _a_ (ah) in F_a_ther, _o_ in r_o_ll, etc.\r\n\r\nConsonants are, on the contrary, those sounds which are produced by the\r\ncrack of commencing or by obstructing, breaking, or cutting off the\r\nsounding breath, by completely or partially closing the organs of\r\nspeech; as, for instance, by closing the lips, as when we pronounce\r\n_p_ie, _b_y, _m_y, etc.; or by pressing the point of the tongue against\r\nthe gums and teeth, as when we say t_ie_, d_ie_, etc.; or by lifting the\r\nbody of the tongue against the hard palate or roof of the mouth, as when\r\nwe give the _k_ or hard _g_ sound, as in rac_k_, ra_g_, or in any other\r\nsimilar way.\r\n\r\nConsonants are, therefore, the breaks or _limitations_ upon the\r\notherwise unbroken and continuous vocality, voice, or vocalized breath.\r\nIn other words, as already said, _Vowel_-Sound is the Elemental\r\n_Substance_, and _Consonant_-Sound the Elemental _Form_ of Language, or\r\nSpeech. (By Vowels and Consonants are here meant, the Reader should\r\nclosely observe, Vowel-_Sounds_ and Consonant-_Sounds_, as produced by\r\nthe _Organs_ of _Speech_, and as they address themselves to the _Ear_,\r\ndistinguished and wholly apart from the _letters_ or combinations of\r\nletters by which they are diversely represented to the _Eye_ in\r\ndifferent languages.)\r\n\r\nBy a valid but somewhat remote analogy, the _Vowel_-Sounds of Language\r\nmay be regarded collectively as the _Flesh_, and the _Consonant_-Sounds\r\nas the _Bone_ or _Skeleton_ of the Lingual Structure. Flesh is an\r\n_Analogue_ or Correspondential Equivalent of Substance. Bone or\r\nSkeleton, which gives _outline_ or _shape_ to the otherwise soft,\r\ncollapsing, and lumpy flesh-mass of the Human or Animal Body, is an\r\n_Analogue_ of Correspondential Equivalent of Limitation or Form; as the\r\nframework of a house is the shaping or form-giving factor or agent of\r\nthe entire structure.\r\n\r\n_Vowel_-Sounds are soft, fluent, changeful, and evanescent. One passes\r\neasily into another by slight deviations of pronunciation, resulting\r\nfrom trivial differences in National and Individual condition and\r\nculture; like the Flesh of the animal, which readily decays from the\r\nBony Skeleton, while the last remains preserved for ages as a fossil.\r\nThe Vowel-Sounds so readily lose their identity, that they are of slight\r\nimportance to the Etymologist or Comparative Philologist, who is, in\r\nfact, dealing in the _Paleontology_ of Language.\r\n\r\nThe _Consonants_ are, on the contrary, the _Fossils_ of Speech; bony and\r\npermanent representatives of Framework, of _Limitation_, of Form.\r\nConsonant-Sounds are also sometimes denominated _Articulations_. This\r\nword means _joinings_ or _jointings_. It is from the Latin _articulus_,\r\na JOINT, and is instinctually applied to the Consonant-Sounds in\r\naccordance with their analogy with the _Skeleton_ of the Human or Animal\r\nSystem.\r\n\r\nBy an easy and habitual slide in the meaning of Words, a term like\r\n_Joint_ is sometimes used to denote the _break_ or _opening_ between\r\nparts, and sometimes to denote one of the parts intervening between such\r\nbreaks; as when we speak of a _joint_ of meat, meaning thereby what a\r\nBotanist would signify by the term _Internode_, the stretch or reach or\r\nshaft of bone extending from one joint (break) to another, with the meat\r\nattached to it.\r\n\r\nConsonants have, in like manner, a double aspect as Articulations or\r\n_Joints_. In a rigorous and abstract sense, the Consonant has no sound\r\nof its own. It is simply a break or interruption of Sound.\r\nEtymologically, it is from the Latin _con_, WITH, and _sonans_,\r\nSOUNDING; as if it were a mere accessory to a (vowel) Sound; the Vowels\r\nbeing, in that sense, the only sounds. In this sense, the Consonants are\r\nanalogous with the mere cracks or opening _joints_, which intervene\r\nbetween the bones of the Skeleton. In other words, they are no sounds,\r\nbut mere nothings; the analogy, in that case, of _Abstract_ Limitation.\r\n\r\nPractically, on the contrary, the Consonant takes to itself such a\r\nportion of the vocalized or sounding breath which it serves primarily to\r\nlimit, that it becomes not merely a sound ranking with the Vowel; but\r\nthe more prominent and abiding sound of the two. It is in this latter\r\nsense, that it is the Analogue of the Bone.\r\n\r\nIn Phonography, as in Hebrew and some other Languages, the letters\r\nrepresenting the Consonant-Sounds only are written or printed; the\r\nVowel-Sounds being either represented by mere points added to the\r\nConsonant characters, or left wholly unrepresented, to be supplied by\r\nthe intelligence of the Reader. The written words so constructed,\r\nrepresent the real words with about the degree of accuracy with which a\r\nskeleton represents the living man; so that the meaning can be readily\r\ngathered by the practised reader, by the aid of the context. In\r\nPhonography, the Consonant-Sounds, which are simple straight or curved\r\nlines, are joined together at their ends, forming an outline shape,\r\nsomewhat like a single script (written) letter of our ordinary writing.\r\nThese outline words are then instinctually and technically called\r\n_Skeleton-words_, from the natural perception of a genuine Scientific\r\nAnalogy.\r\n\r\nConsonants constitute, then, what may be denominated the _Limitismus_\r\n(Limiting Domain) of Language. The Limit is primarily represented by the\r\nLine (a line, any line); then by the Line embodying Substance as _seam_,\r\n_ridge_, _bar_, _beam_, _shaft_, _or bone_; and, finally, by a System of\r\nLines, Shafts or Bones which may then be jointed or limited in turn\r\namong themselves, forming a concatenation of Lines, Bars or Shafts, the\r\nframework of a machine or house or other edifice, or the ideal columnar\r\nand orbital structure of the Universe itself. All these conceptions or\r\ncreations belong to the practical Limitismus, the Form Aspect or\r\nFramework of Being in Universals and in Particulars in every Sphere and\r\nDepartment of the Universe.\r\n\r\nThe _Limitismus_ of Being so defined then stands over against or\r\ncontrasted with the _Substancismus_ (Substance-Domain) of Being which\r\nembraces the Substances, Materials or Stuffs of creation of whatsoever\r\nname that infill the interstices of the Framework or are laid upon it,\r\nand constitute the richness and fulness and plumpness of the Structure,\r\nas the Flesh does of the Body.\r\n\r\nThe wholeness or _Integrality_ of the structure then consists of the\r\ncomposity of these Two (Limitismus and Substancismus), as the wholeness\r\nof the Body consists of the Flesh and the Bone. The Consonants being the\r\nLimitismus, and the Vowels the Substancismus of Language; the Two united\r\nand coordinated comprise the Trinismal Integrality or Integralismus of\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\nThe Vowels denote, then, _Reality_, as distinguished from _Limitation_,\r\nor, what is nearly the same thing, _Substance_, as distinguished from\r\n_Form_.\r\n\r\nThere are in all _Seven_ (7); or if we include one somewhat more obscure\r\nthan the rest, a kind of semi-tone, there are _Eight_ (8) full-toned,\r\nperfectly distinct and primary Vowel-Sounds, which constitute the\r\nFundamental Vowel Scale of the Universal Alphabet. Their number and\r\nnature is governed by the Mechanical Law of their organic production in\r\nthe mouth. And the number can only be increased by interposing minor\r\nshades of sound, as we produce minor shades of color by blending the\r\nSeven (7) Prismatic Colors. The new Sound will then belong, in\r\npredominance and as a mere variety, to one of these Seven (7) Primary\r\nSounds.\r\n\r\nThese Seven (7) Sounds constitute the Leading Vowel-System of all\r\nLanguages; with certain irregularities of omission in the Vowel-System\r\nof some Languages.\r\n\r\nBy the addition of Five (5) equally leading _Diphthongs_ (or Double\r\nVowels) the number of leading Vowel representations is carried up to\r\nTwelve (12) or Thirteen (13)--which may then be regarded as the\r\nCompleted Fundamental Vowel Scale of the Universal Lingual Alphabet.\r\n\r\n_There are, in like manner, Seven (7)--or Eight (8)--Leading Realities\r\nof the Universe_, AND OF EVERY MINOR SPHERE OR DOMAIN OF BEING IN THE\r\nUNIVERSE, _which correspond with, echo or repeat, and are therefore the\r\nScientific Analogues of, these Seven (7) Leading Vowel-Sounds, as they\r\noccur among the Elements of Speech_.\r\n\r\nIn representing the Vowel-Sounds, it is better, for numerous reasons, to\r\nuse the letters with their general _European_ Values, than it is to\r\nconform to their altered or corrupted _English_ Values. For instance,\r\nthe Vowel I (i) is pronounced in nearly every language of Europe, and in\r\nall those languages which the Missionaries have reduced to writing, as\r\nwe pronounce _e_ or _ee_, or as _i_ in mach_i_ne, or p_i_que; E (e) is\r\npronounced as we enunciate _a_ in paper; and A is reserved for the full\r\nItalian sound of _a_ (_ah_), as in father; _U_ is pronounced like _oo_,\r\nas in German, Spanish, Italian and many other languages.\r\n\r\nThe Seven (7) Vowels in question are then as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. I, i (_ee_ in f_ee_l).\r\n  2. E, e (_a_ in m_a_te).\r\n  3. A, a (_a_ in f_a_-ther).\r\n  4. _o_, _o_ (_aw_ in _aw_ful).\r\n  5. _u_, _u_ (_u_ in c_u_rd).\r\n  6. O, o (_o_ in n_o_-ble).\r\n  7. U, u (_oo_ in f_oo_l).\r\n\r\nThese sounds are produced in the middle, at the back, and at the front\r\nof the mouth respectively. These localities, and something of the nature\r\nof the sounds themselves, as _slender_ or _full_, will be plainly\r\nillustrated by the annexed figure:\r\n\r\n  3. Front-   1. Middle-     2. Back-\r\n     Mouth       Mouth          Mouth\r\n\r\n\r\n      ou           i         e (^a) a; _o_ _u_\r\n\r\nThe following description of the organic formation or production of\r\nthese sounds now becomes important.\r\n\r\nThe Vowel-Sound I (ee) is the most slender and condensed of the\r\nVowel-Scale. It is produced at the middle or central part of the mouth,\r\nby forcing a slight, closely-squeezed current of Sounding Breath,\r\nthrough a small, smooth channel or opening made by forming _a gutter or\r\nscoop of the flattened point of the tongue_; while, at the same time,\r\nthe tongue is applied at the edges to the teeth and gums. This sound\r\nhas, therefore, an actual _form_ resembling that of a thread or line; or\r\nstill better, like that of a wire drawn through one of the iron openings\r\nby means of which wire is manufactured. It resembles also a slight,\r\nsmooth, roundish stream of fluid escaping through a tube or trough.\r\n\r\nThis sound has relation, therefore, in the first place, to _Centrality_\r\nor CENTRE; and then to LENGTH (or Line), which is the First Dimension of\r\nExtension. The I-sound continued or prolonged gives the idea of Length.\r\nBut broken into Least Units of the same quality of Sound, we have\r\nindividualized Vowel-Sounds of this quality, each one of which is a new\r\n_Centre_; like the successive _Points_ of which a _Line_ is composed.\r\n\r\nAn individual sound, I, has relation, therefore, to _Centre_ and to\r\n_Point_ generally. As such it stands representatively for the _Soul_ or\r\n_Identity_ or _Central Individuality of Being_--for that which gives to\r\nanything its distinctive character, as existing in the _Point_ or the\r\n_Unit_, or the _Atom_, or in any Individual Object or Thing from the\r\nAtom up to a World and to the Universe as a whole. _Identity_ is,\r\nperhaps, the best single term furnished by our Language to signify this\r\nbasic idea. _Individuality_ approximates the meaning. It is the\r\n_pivotal_ notion of Being itself, and has relation, therefore, to\r\nOntology, the Science of Abstract Being. _Essence_ and _Essential Being_\r\nare terms which may also be used in defining it. The Reader should\r\nunderstand, however, that with reference to this Sound, as to those to\r\nbe hereafter considered, there is no term or terms in any Language which\r\nwill indicate their meaning _exactly_. The analysis of Ideas upon which\r\nUNIVERSOLOGY is based is more fundamental than any which has preceded\r\nit. Its Primary Conceptions are, therefore, broader and more inclusive\r\nthan any former ones which existing terms are employed to denote. In\r\nexplaining the meaning of these First Elements of Sound, then, as\r\nrelated to the First Elements of Thought, all that is now attempted is\r\nto convey as clear a notion of this meaning as is possible with our\r\npresent terminology, without any expectation that the _precise_ meaning\r\nintended will be at once or entirely apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe sound E (_a_ in m_a_te) is likewise a slender, abstract-like,\r\nmiddle-mouth sound; but differs from I in the fact that it is produced\r\nby _flattening_ the opening for the Sounding Breath instead of retaining\r\nit in a roundish position. The angles of the mouth are drawn asunder, as\r\nif pointing outward to the sides of the head, and the sound is, as it\r\nwere, _elongated in the crosswise direction_, as if a stick or a quill\r\nwere held in the teeth, the extremities extending outward to the sides.\r\nA line, in this direction, is the measurer of BREADTH, which is the\r\nSecond Dimension of Extension, crossing the Length-line represented by I\r\nat right angles. _Side-wise-ness_ is synonymous with RELATION, as one of\r\nthe Sub-divisions of Reality, or, in other words, of the Realities of\r\nBeing. _Re-lation_ is, etymologically, from the Latin _re_, BACK or\r\nREFLECTED, and _latus_, SIDE; that which mutually and reciprocally\r\nre-sides the _Centre_, or furnishes it with sides or _wings_. The\r\nVowel-Sound E (_a_, in m_a_te) is, therefore, the Analogue or\r\nCorresponding Representative or Equivalent in the Domain of Sound of\r\nthat _Fundamental Conception_ which, in respect to Thought, is\r\ndenominated _Relation_, in respect to Position _Collaterality_ or\r\n_Sideness_, and in respect to Dimension _Breadth_ or _Width_.\r\n\r\nThe Sound A (_a_ in f_a_ther) is made farther back in the mouth, with\r\nthe mouth stretched quite open, and is the richest and most harmonious\r\nof the Vowel Sounds--the Queen of the Vowels. It is the Italian A, the\r\nsound most allied with Music and Euphony, and yet a sound which is\r\ngreatly lacking in the English Language.\r\n\r\nThe English Reader must guard himself from confounding the Vowel-Sound\r\nof which we are here speaking, with the Consonant R, the alphabetical\r\nname of which is by a lax habit of pronunciation made to be nearly\r\nidentical with this Vowel-Sound; while for this beautiful and brilliant\r\nand leading Vowel in the Alphabet of Nature we have no distinct letter\r\nin English, and reckon it merely as one of the values or powers of the\r\nLetter A, to which we ordinarily give the value of E (_a_ in m_a_te,\r\n_ai_ in p_ai_n).\r\n\r\nThis Vowel A (_ah_, _a_ in f_a_ther) is made with the mouth so open that\r\nthe form of its production suggests the insertion of a stick or other\r\nelongated object in a perpendicular direction to retain the jaws in\r\ntheir position; a practice said sometimes to be resorted to by the\r\nItalian Music Teacher, in order to correct the bad habit of talking\r\nthrough the teeth, common among his English pupils.\r\n\r\nThis height and depth involved in the Sound of the Vowel A (ah) relates\r\nit to THICKNESS, the Third Dimension of Extension; as the Sound I is\r\nrelated to _Length_, the First of these Dimensions, and the Sound E to\r\n_Breadth_, the Second of them.\r\n\r\n_Thickness_ is again related to _richness_ and _sweetness_, to _fulness_\r\nand _fatness_, as of the good condition of an Animal in flesh, or of\r\nrich and productive soils. And these ideas are again related to _wealth_\r\nor to _riches_ generally; and, hence, again to SUBSTANCE. The objects of\r\nwealth are called _goods_, and a wealthy man is said to be a '_man of\r\nsubstance_.' A (ah) is the representative or pivotal Vowel; that one\r\nwhich embodies most completely the _Vowel Idea_. Its inherent meaning is\r\nespecially, therefore, that of SUBSTANCE or REALITY, which, is, in a\r\nmore general way, as we have seen, the meaning of all the Vowels. The\r\nmost real, tangible, sensible substance from an ordinary point of view\r\nbeing. Matter, this Vowel-Sound allies itself also with _Matter_ or\r\n_Materiality_ as contrasted with _Spiritual_ Substance.\r\n\r\nThere is, it must now be observed, a flattened variety of A (ah), which\r\nwill here be represented by the same letter italicized, thus, _A_, _a_,\r\nwhich is the so-called flat sound of A (ah) as when heard prolonged in\r\nm_a_re, pe_a_r, etc., or when stopped, in m_a_n, m_a_t, etc. This sound\r\nis intermediate in position between E and A (ah). That is to say, it is\r\nproduced farther back in the mouth and with the mouth somewhat more open\r\nthan when we say E, and not so far back as when we say A (ah); and with\r\nthe mouth less open. As contrasted with the A (ah), it is a thin, flat,\r\nand slightly unsatisfactory and disagreeable sound, analogically related\r\nto the natural semitone _fa_ of the Diatonic Scale of Musical Tones.\r\nThis Sound signifies accordingly, THINNESS, ATTENUATED MATTER, the Ghost\r\nor Spirit of Nature, related to Odic Force, Magnetisms, Electricity,\r\netc.; still not, however, Spirit in the sense of Mind, or in the\r\nReligio-Spiritual sense of the word. This is the exceptional or bastard\r\nVowel-Sound which has but an imperfect or half claim to be inserted in\r\nthe Leading Vowel Scale. When inserted, its natural position is between\r\nthe E and the A (ah), although for certain reasons it sometimes changes\r\nposition with the A (ah), following instead of preceding it.\r\n\r\nThe next two Vowel-Sounds, _o_ (_aw_ in _aw_ful), and _u_ (_u_ in\r\nc_u_rd), are somewhat like the _a_ (_a_ in m_a_re), exceptional or\r\nbastard Sounds. They are unheard in many Languages, and unrecognized as\r\ndistinct sounds in many Languages where they are, in fact, heard. Very\r\nfew Languages have distinct Letter-Signs for them. In using the Roman\r\nAlphabet, I am compelled to adopt a contrivance to represent them; which\r\nis, as in the case of the _a_, to print them in italic types, for which,\r\nwhen the remainder of the word is in italic, small capitals are\r\nsubstituted, thus: _O_ful (awful); _U_rgent; or, in case the whole word\r\nis intended to be italicized, for the sake of emphasis, O_ful_,\r\nU_rgent_. In script or handwriting, the italic Letter is marked by\r\nunderscoring a single line, and the small capital by underscoring two\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n_O_ (aw) is the fullest of the Vowel-Sounds. It is made with the mouth\r\nstill farther open than when we say A (ah), and somewhat farther back;\r\nor, rather, with the cavity enlarged in all directions, and especially\r\ndeepened. The mouth is stretched in all ways to its utmost capacity,\r\ngiving a hollow, vacant effect to the voice, instead of the rich, mellow\r\nand substantial sound of the A (ah). The Sound so produced is,\r\nnevertheless, on the one hand, a broader quality of the A (ah), and\r\nthere is a strong tendency on the part of the A (ah) to degenerate into\r\nit, as when the uneducated German, says _Yaw_ for _Ja_ (yah). On the\r\nother hand, this sound has something of the quality of O. It is,\r\ntherefore, intermediate in quality between A (ah) and O. In respect to\r\nmeaning, it is the Type, Analogue, Equivalent, or Representative of\r\nVolume or SPACE, whether filled or unfilled by Substance. That is to\r\nsay, it is the Analogue of Space, not in the sense in which we formerly\r\nregarded Space as the _negation_ of Matter; but in the sense of\r\n_Infinite Dimensionality_, or of Dimensionality in all directions, as a\r\nvague generalization from the three special dimensions _Length_,\r\n_Breadth_, and _Thickness_. It is, therefore, round or ball-like, and\r\nhuge, and, in respect to the nature of the tone, vague and vacant.\r\n\r\nSpace _as mere nothing_ has no Letter-Sign in the Alphabet; but is\r\nrepresented by the blank types or spaces used by the printer to separate\r\nhis syllables and words, as shown heretofore. Space _as a Department of\r\nReality_, as one of the _Realities_ of the Universe, a bastard or\r\nsemi-Reality it is true, but nevertheless, belonging to that Domain, is\r\ndenoted by the Vowel-Sound _o_ (aw).\r\n\r\nThe Sound _u_ (uh, _u_ in c_u_rd), the fifth of the Scale, is called\r\namong Phoneticians, the _Natural_ Vowel. It is the simple, unmodulated\r\nor unformed vocal breath permitted to flow forth from the throat or\r\nlarynx with no effort to produce any specific sound. It is the mere\r\ngrunt, a little prolonged; the unwrought material out of which the other\r\nand more perfect Vowel Sounds are made by modulation, or, in other\r\nwords, by the shapings and strains put upon the machinery of utterance.\r\nThe Hebrew _scheva_, the French _eu_, and _e_ mute, are varieties of\r\nthis easily-flowing, unmodulated, unstable, unsatisfactory sound. Like\r\nthe _o_ (aw), this sound _u_ (uh) has a vacant, unfinished, and\r\ninorganic character as a sound, while yet, from its great fluency, its\r\nfrequent occurrence tends, more than that of any other sound, to give to\r\nLanguage that conversational fluency, rapidity and ease which are\r\nespecially characteristic of the French Tongue. From this same easy\r\nlaxity of its nature all the other Vowel Sounds tend, in English\r\nparticularly, when they are not accented, to fall back into this Natural\r\nVowel; as in the following instances: Rom_a_n, brok_e_n, m_i_rth,\r\nmart_y_r, Bost_o_n, c_u_rd, etc.; words which we pronounce nearly\r\nRom_u_n, brok_u_n, m_u_rth, mart_u_r, Bost_u_n, c_u_rd, etc.\r\n\r\nThis Sound, as to inherent meaning, is, by its alliance with the idea of\r\nflux, flow and continuity, the Type, Analogue, Equivalent or\r\nRepresentative in the Domain of Oral Sound of that _Fundamental\r\nConception_ which, in respect to Idea, we denominate TIME; and of\r\nStream-like or _Currental_ Being of all kinds.\r\n\r\n_Space_, denoted by _o_ (aw), has relation to the Air as an atmosphere,\r\nand to the Ocean of Ether in filling the Great Spheral Dome of Empyrean\r\nor Firmament. The Vowel-Sound _u_ (uh) has a similar relation to\r\nFluidity or Liquidity, and, hence, to Water as a typical fluid, to the\r\nOcean Flux or Tide, to the Flowing Stream, etc. This Time-like idea is\r\nuni-dimensional or elongate in a _general_ or _fluctuating_ sense; not\r\n_specifically_ like I. It is in view of this characteristic, that it is\r\nbroadly and primarily contrasted with the Spacic significance of _o_\r\n(aw), which is omnidimensional.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining Vowel-Sounds, the O and U (oo), repeat the _o_ (aw)\r\nand _u_ (uh), in a sense, but in a new and more refined stage or degree\r\nof development. The sound O is made at the front mouth--the locality the\r\nmost openly in sight of any at which Sound is produced--by rounding the\r\nlips into an irregularly-circular, face-like, or disk-like presentation.\r\nThe O Sound so produced denotes Presence, as of an object by virtue of\r\nits reflection of Light; and, hence, LIGHT, _Clearness_, _Purity_,\r\n_Reflection_.\r\n\r\nThe U (_oo_ in f_oo_l) is an obscured or impure pronunciation of the O.\r\nThe lips are protruded as if to say O; but not being sufficiently so for\r\nthe production of the pure Sound, the Sound actually given is mixed, or\r\nmade turbid or thick. The U-Sound denotes accordingly _Retiracy_,\r\n_Obscurity_, _Shade_, _Turbidity_, _Mixedness_, or _Impurity_, as of\r\nColors in a dim light, or as of Materials in a slime or plasma, etc.\r\n\r\nMetaphysically, O denotes PURE THEORY, the _Abstract_; and U (oo)\r\nsignifies the ACTUAL or PRACTICAL, the Tempic, the Concrete (the\r\nTemporal or Profane), which is always mixed with contingency.\r\n\r\nOther Vowel-Sounds, shades more or less distinct of some one of these\r\nLeading Sounds, are interspersed by nature between these _diatonic_\r\nSounds, like the half tones and quarter tones in Music. Two of these\r\nFrench _eu_ and _e muet_ modifications of _u_ (uh) have been mentioned.\r\n_Eu_ is modulated at the lips, and _e muet_ at the middle mouth, but\r\nboth have the general character of _u_ (uh). The French U is a\r\nmodification of the U (oo), of the Scale just given, but made finer, and\r\napproximating I (ee). The Italian O is a modification of _o_ (aw). These\r\nfour are the Leading Semi-tone Sounds; which along with _a_ carry the\r\nScale from Seven (7) diatonic up to twelve (12) chromatic. As they will\r\nbe passed over for the present with this mere mention, the points of the\r\nScale at which they intervene will not be now considered.\r\n\r\nDiscarding these minor shades of Sounds, the Leading Scale of\r\nVowel-Sounds is augmented from Seven (7) or Eight (8) to Twelve (12) or\r\nThirteen (13), by the addition of the following five (5) Diphthongs or\r\nDouble Vowels. In respect to the _quality_ of Sound, they are pronounced\r\njust as the Vowels of which they are composed would be if separated and\r\nsucceeding each other. To make the Diphthong _long_, the two Sounds are\r\nkept quite distinct. To make it _short_, they are closely blended; as,\r\nAU (ah-oo), long; A[)U] (ahoo), short. With no diacretical mark they are\r\npronounced _ad libidum_, or neither very long nor short.\r\n\r\nThe following are the five (5) Diphthongs which complete the Vowel\r\nScale:\r\n\r\nThe IU is composed of the first Vowel I (ee) and the last U (oo). The\r\nI-sound, so placed before another Vowel-Sound, tends readily to be\r\nconverted into or more properly to prefix to itself the weak\r\nConsonant-Sound represented in English by Y (in German and Italian by\r\nJ); thus YIU for IU. The whole of the three Sounds so involved (a real\r\nTriphthong) are represented by the English U long--which is never a\r\n_simple_ Vowel-Sound--as in _union_, pronounced _yioonyun_.\r\n\r\nThis Diphthong IU (or yiu) denotes _Conjunction_, _Conjuncture_, _Event_\r\n(the two ends meeting); and also _Coupling_ or _Unition_; a central\r\npoint between extremes.\r\n\r\nThe next and the most important of the Diphthongs (except AU) is AI,\r\ncompounded of the third (A) and the first (I) of the simple\r\nVowel-Sounds. It is pronounced very nearly like the English long I, as\r\nin p_i_ne, f_i_ne, etc., which is not a _simple_ Vowel; but is\r\ncompounded of the two simple Vowels above mentioned (A and I, ahee) in a\r\nvery close union with each other; or, as it were, squeezed into each\r\nother. The Tikiwa (Tee-kee-wah) combination (this is the name of the\r\nScientific Universal Language), AI, is not ordinarily quite so close,\r\nand when pronounced _long_, is quite open, so that each Vowel is\r\ndistinctly heard (ah-ee).\r\n\r\nThis Diphthong AI may be regarded as embracing and epitomizing the lower\r\nor ground wing or half of the Simple Vowel-Scale (I E _a_ A); its\r\nmeaning is, therefore, that of BASIC or SUBSTANTIAL REALITY: the GROUND\r\nof Existence.\r\n\r\nContrasted with this is the next Diphthong, _O_I (aw-ee), compounded of\r\nthe fifth (_o_) and the first (I) Vowel-Sounds. It is the Sound of _oy_\r\nin b_oy_. The I contained in this Diphthong may be regarded as standing\r\nin the place of U at the other extremity of the Scale. This last Sound\r\nhas a tendency to return into I through the French slender U,\r\nillustrating the Principle of the Contact of Extremes. The Diphthong\r\n_O_I may, therefore, be viewed as embracing and epitomizing the upper or\r\nethereal wing or half of the Simple Vowel Scale (_o_ _u_ O U); its\r\nmeaning is, therefore, that of AERIAL or ASCENDING REALITY; LOFTINESS or\r\nLOFT.\r\n\r\nNext there occurs a Diphthong OI, pronounced as the same letters in the\r\nEnglish word g_oi_ng, which has a half claim to be ranked with the\r\nLeading Diphthongs. It is sometimes reckoned into, and sometimes out of,\r\nthe Scale--like _a_ among the Simple Vowels. Its meaning is that of\r\nFRONTNESS, PROSPECT.\r\n\r\nFinally, the great Focal Diphthong, that which includes and epitomizes\r\nthe whole Vowel Scale, is AU (ah-oo), compounded of the third\r\nVowel-Sound (A) and the Seventh (or Eighth) U. It is the sound heard in\r\n_ou_r, or in the Spanish c_au_sa. The meaning of this Supreme Diphthong\r\nand general Vowel Representative is UNIVERSAL REALITY. It stands\r\npractically in the place of all the Vowels, in the Composition of Words\r\nof an inclusive meaning. That is to say, it integrates in its\r\nsignification, all that is inherently signified by all the other Vowels.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, AU is practically and usually the Representative,\r\nAnalogue or Equivalent, in the Domain of Language, of Universal Reality\r\namong the Elements of Being, this is so _only in practice_.\r\n_Theoretically_, the Diphthong best adapted to represent this Idea is\r\nAO; the A and the O being, in a supreme sense, the two most prominent or\r\nleading Vowels. But it is a little difficult to retain the Organs of\r\nUtterance in the position which they must assume in order to pronounce\r\nthese two Vowel-Sounds in conjunction. The organs readily and naturally\r\nslide into the easier position in which they utter AU. This is\r\ncorrespondential with the difficulty always experienced in adhering to\r\n_Pure Theory_ (O); and the natural tendency to glide from it, as ground\r\ntoo high for permanent occupation, into the more accommodating Domain of\r\nthe _Practical_ (U).\r\n\r\nThe Full Scale of Vowel Sounds coupled with the Full Scale of the\r\n(Indeterminate) Realities of Universal Being is, therefore, as follows:\r\n\r\n       1. SOUNDS.                          2. REALITIES OF BEING.\r\n\r\n 1. I, i (ee as in feel).             ENTITY or IDENTITY (Centre, Least\r\n                                        Element, Essential Being,\r\n                                        Individuality).\r\n\r\n 2.

This difference is indicated by\r\ndiacritical marks, which it is not now necessary to exhibit.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these merely _quantitative_ differences in the\r\nVowel-Sounds, there is a corresponding difference of _Quality_, which\r\nproduces a Counter-Scale of Vowel-Sounds; an echo or repetition of the\r\nBasic Scale throughout its entire length. This new Scale is a Series of\r\nSounds predominantly _short_ in quantity. They are called by Mr. Pitman\r\nthe _Stopped_ Vowels. (In German they are denominated the _Sharp_\r\nVowels.) These Sounds are nearly always followed by a Consonant-Sound in\r\nthe same syllable, by which they are _stopped_ or _broken abruptly off_,\r\nand the purity of their quality as Vowels affected or disturbed.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential for our present purpose to give a detailed list of\r\nthese Vowels; more especially as every Reader will readily recall them;\r\nas I, in pIn; E, in pEt; A in pAt; _o_, in n_o_t; _u_, in b_u_t; O, in\r\nstOne, cOAt; U, in fUll.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the Vowel Diphthongs, the _Stopped_ Sounds are not\r\nmaterially different from the _short_ quantities of the corresponding\r\nFull ones; and no effort need be made to distinguish the two former\r\nvarieties of Sound. The same is true of the Short and Stopped Sounds of\r\nA (ah). But the difference is very marked in the remaining Seven (7)\r\nSimple Vowels; the Stopped Sounds of which are given above. For the\r\nordinary purposes of Language it is not necessary to distinguish these\r\nStopped Sounds by any diacritical mark. But in the short Root-Words,\r\nwhere a difference of meaning depends upon the difference between the\r\n_full_ and _stopped_ Vowel, the so-called _grave_ accent is employed to\r\ndenote the _stopped_ quality, as pique, pick, for example, written thus:\r\npik, pik.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the Stopped Vowel-Sounds is merely the broken or\r\n_fractionized_ aspect of the same ideas which are symbolized by the\r\ncorresponding _Full_ Vowel-Sounds.\r\n\r\nThe nature and meaning of the Vowels being thus explained with\r\nsufficient amplitude for the uses now in view, we are prepared to\r\nadvance, in a subsequent paper, to the consideration of the individual\r\nConsonant-Sounds, their character and inherent signification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO PLATFORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the opprobrium of the Republican party in the Presidential\r\ncampaign of 1860, that the Southern States were not, in any but a\r\nlimited degree, represented in its ranks; and so it was called a\r\nsectional party. The Presidential campaign of 1864 is not less\r\nremarkable, on the other hand, because the party which now appropriates\r\nthe honored name of Democratic seems to ignore the crime of rebellion on\r\nthe part of those Southern States, and thus invites an even more\r\nobnoxious appellation. History will record with amazement, as among the\r\nstrange phenomena of a war the most wicked of all the wicked wars with\r\nwhich ambition has desolated the earth (phenomena that will perplex men\r\nand women of loyal instincts and righteous common sense to the latest\r\nday), the resolutions of the Chicago Convention of 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this article to consider as dispassionately as may\r\nbe, those Chicago resolutions, as well as the ones previously adopted at\r\nBaltimore; desiring to look at them both from the standpoint of a\r\npatriotism which loves the whole country as one indivisible nation--the\r\ngift of God, to be cherished as we cherish our homes and our altars.\r\n\r\nA convention called of all those, without respect to former political\r\naffinities, who believed in an uncompromising prosecution of the war for\r\nthe Union till the armed rebellion against its authority should be\r\nsubdued and brought to terms, met at Baltimore on the 7th of June last,\r\nand nominated Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, for reelection as President,\r\nand Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, for election as Vice-President. The\r\nconvention, with exceeding good sense, and obedient to the just and\r\npatriotic impulses of the people, disregarded all party names of the\r\npast, and called itself simply a National Union Convention. Two months\r\nlater, and on the 29th of August last, obedient to the call of\r\nDemocratic committees, a convention met at Chicago, composed of men\r\nwhose voices were for peace, and nominated for President General George\r\nB. McClellan, of New Jersey, and for Vice-President George H. Pendleton,\r\nof Ohio. This convention took the name of Democratic, indicating thereby\r\nnot the idea of the equal rule of all the people, as the name imports,\r\nbut the traditions and policies of those degenerate days before the war,\r\nwhen Democracy had strangely come to mean the rule of a few ambitious\r\nmen. In other words, it ignored the crime of those men (who have\r\nsacrificed their country to their ambition), and assumed that the\r\ncountry could also overlook the crime. It supposed the people ready to\r\nstrike hands with rebellion and elevate the authors of rebellion to\r\npower again.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the difference between the two conventions may be concisely\r\nstated thus: The Chicago Convention was for peace first, and Union\r\nafterward; the Baltimore Convention for Union first, then peace. Let us\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO PLATFORM.\r\n\r\nWe suppose that no one will think us wanting in fairness when we\r\ncharacterize the Chicago Platform as one of peace.[4] If there is any\r\nreproach in the term, it surely is not the fault of those who take men\r\nto mean what they say.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: It is presumed that every one is familiar with the two\r\nplatforms, as they are so easily obtained, and it is, therefore, not\r\ndeemed necessary to encumber the pages of the Magazine with inserting\r\nthem in full.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is simply the truth to declare that the general impression on\r\nthe first publication of it confirmed the view we have taken, and that\r\neven among the supporters of the convention there were many who\r\nproclaimed their confident expectation that General McClellan, if he\r\nshould accept the nomination, would disregard the platform, and stake\r\nhis chances on his own more warlike record. We will not stop to consider\r\nin this place whether that expectation has been fulfilled. It suffices\r\nfor our present purpose to remind our readers that the great doctrine of\r\nthe Democratic party of former days was expressed in the motto,\r\n'Principles, not men;' and that the rigid discipline of the party has\r\nalways required the nominee to be the mere representative of the\r\nplatform--its other self, so to speak: as witness the case of Buchanan,\r\nwho declared himself, following the approved formulas of his party, no\r\nlonger James Buchanan, but the Cincinnati Platform. It ought also to be\r\nborne in mind, that General McClellan's letter of acceptance does not,\r\nin terms, repudiate the platform, and is not necessarily inconsistent\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe first one of the six resolutions that constitute the Chicago\r\nPlatform, has the sound of true doctrine. 'Unswerving fidelity to the\r\nUnion under the Constitution,' is the duty of every citizen, and has\r\nalways been the proud war-cry of every party; and they who swerve from\r\nit are subject not simply to our individual censure, but to the sanction\r\nof our supreme law. The just complaint against this platform is, that,\r\nwhile thus proclaiming good doctrine, it overlooks the departure\r\ntherefrom of a large portion of the people, misled by wicked men. When\r\nwe look at the other resolutions, the first one seems all 'sound and\r\nfury, signifying nothing.'\r\n\r\nNor will we withhold what of approval may possibly be due, in strict\r\njustice, to the sixth and last resolution; although the approval can\r\nonly be a limited one. No one can overlook the entire lack in that\r\nresolution of cordial sympathy with the sacred cause of nationality, to\r\nwhich the brave heroes of the war have given their lives and fortunes.\r\nIt restricts itself to a simple recognition of the 'soldiery of our\r\narmy,' as entitled to 'sympathy,' with a promise of 'protection' to\r\nthem, 'in the event of our attaining power.' It ignores the navy, and\r\npasses by the gallant heroes who on sea and river have upheld the flag\r\nof our country with a lustre that pales not before the names of Paul\r\nJones, and Perry, and Decatur. Moreover, the sympathy 'extended to the\r\nsoldiery' is the sympathy not of the American people, but of 'the\r\nDemocratic party.' Surely, this phrase was ill conceived. It has a touch\r\nof partisan exclusiveness that is sadly out of place. But the resolution\r\nis unpartisan and patriotic in another respect that deserves notice. It\r\nextends the 'sympathy of the Democratic party to the soldiery of our\r\narmy,' without making any discrimination to the prejudice of the negro\r\nsoldiers; and thus commits the 'Democratic party,' with honorable\r\nimpartiality, to the 'care and protection' of _all_ 'the brave soldiers\r\nof the Republic.'\r\n\r\nWith these criticisms upon the first and sixth resolutions, we proceed\r\nto record our total disapprobation of the remaining four. In all candor,\r\nwe contend that those four resolutions are a surrender of the national\r\nhonor, and a violation of the national faith. They are unworthy the old\r\nglory of the Democratic party. For what is the purport of them? Is it\r\ncondemnation of a rebellion that has 'rent the land with civil feud, and\r\ndrenched it in fraternal blood'? Is it to stimulate the heroism of those\r\nwhose breasts are bared to the bullets of traitors in Virginia and\r\nGeorgia, and who have 'borne aloft the flag and kept step to the music\r\nof the Union' these three years and a half in unwearied defence of the\r\nnation? Ah, no; they declare the war a 'failure'! The second resolution\r\nis the keynote of the platform, reciting 'that after four years (three\r\nyears and a half) of _failure_ to restore the Union by the _experiment\r\nof war_,... justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare demand\r\nthat _immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities_.' Upon\r\nthis resolution there can be no better comment than the remembrance of\r\nDonelson and Pea Ridge, Pittsburg Landing and Vicksburg, Murfreesboro'\r\nand Chattanooga, Antictam and Gettysburg; not to speak of that splendid\r\nseries of battles from the Wilderness to Petersburg, which at last has\r\nbrought the rebel general to bay; nor of the glorious victories, since\r\nthe Chicago Convention, at Mobile and Atlanta, and in the Shenandoah\r\nValley. It can never be forgotten that on the fourth of July, 1863,\r\nGovernor Seymour, in a public discourse at the Academy of Music, in New\r\nYork, drew a deplorable picture of the straits to which the nation was\r\nat last reduced, with the enemy marching defiantly across the fertile\r\nfields of Pennsylvania, and men's hearts failing them for fear of\r\ndanger, not alone to the political capital, Washington, but also to the\r\nfinancial capital, New York; and that, even while the words fell from\r\nthe speaker's lips, that defiant enemy, already beaten, was rapidly\r\nretreating before the magnificent old Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg:\r\nwhile victorious Grant had already broken the left of the rebel line,\r\nand was celebrating the nation's anniversary in the triumph of\r\nVicksburg. Even so, let it never be forgotten that the delegates who\r\nadopted this second resolution, so burdened with despair, had scarcely\r\nreached their homes, ere the stronghold of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nwhich, ever since the war was begun, has been boastfully proclaimed the\r\nkey of its military lines, and as impregnable as Gibraltar, fell before\r\nthe unconquerable progress of the armies of the West, under General\r\nSherman; and thus the rebel centre, as well as left, had been broken,\r\nand only the rebel right, at Richmond, yet remains to the Southern army.\r\n\r\nIn further answer to the discouraging language of this resolution, let\r\nus offset the following terse and comprehensive statement of what has\r\nbeen accomplished in the course of the nation's 'experiment of war.' It\r\nis copied from _The Evening Post_ of a recent date, and the writer\r\nsupposes the soldiers to speak thus:\r\n\r\n     'We have not failed; on the contrary, we have fought bravely and\r\n     conquered splendidly. In proof of our words we can point to such\r\n     trophies as few wars can equal and none surpass. Besides defending\r\n     with unusual vigilance and completeness two thousand miles of\r\n     frontier, in three years we have taken from the enemies of the\r\n     Union, by valor and generalship, thirty complete and thoroughly\r\n     furnished fortresses; we have captured over two thousand cannon; we\r\n     have reconquered and now hold nearly four thousand miles of\r\n     navigable river courses; we have taken ten of the enemy's principal\r\n     cities, three of them capitals of States; in thirty days last\r\n     summer we captured sixty thousand prisoners; we have penetrated\r\n     more than three hundred miles into the territory claimed by the\r\n     enemy; we have cut that territory into strips, leaving his armies\r\n     without effectual communication with each other; the main\r\n     operations and interests of the war, which were lately concentrated\r\n     about Baltimore, Paducah, and St. Louis, have been transferred, by\r\n     our steady and constant advance, to the narrow limits of the\r\n     seaboard Slave States; we hold every harbor but one, of a coast six\r\n     thousand miles long. And whatever we have taken we hold; we have\r\n     never turned back, or given up that which we once fairly\r\n     possessed.'\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been fittingly reserved for the chief of the rebellion\r\nhimself to give the full and complete answer to this dishonorable\r\ncomplaint of failure. Not a month after the meeting of the Chicago\r\nConvention, and on the 23d of September last, Jeff. Davis uttered these\r\nwords, in a public speech, at Macon, Geo.: '_You have not many men\r\nbetween eighteen and forty-five left_.... Two-thirds of our men are\r\nabsent, some sick, some wounded, but _most of them absent without\r\nleave_. ... _In Virginia the disparity of numbers is just an great as it\r\nis in Georgia._'\r\n\r\nBut let it be granted that after these three years and a half of war,\r\nand having accomplished such unquestionably important results, the Union\r\nis not yet restored, what then? Is that a reason for giving up now? Our\r\nfathers fought the British seven years without flinching; and under the\r\nindomitable leader God had given them, they would have fought seven\r\nyears longer with equal determination. Are we less determined than they\r\nwere? Are we such degenerate sons that we are willing to give up the\r\nlegacy they left us, at half its original cost? There is just the same\r\nreason that we should yield the contest now as there was in 1861 that we\r\nshould yield it then; neither more nor less. The integrity of the\r\nnation, the perpetuity of our institutions, the safety, honor, and\r\nwelfare of the people are still at stake.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that 'justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare\r\ndemand that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities,'\r\nthen those same holy principles were assailed when the war was begun. If\r\nthe United States Government was the assailant, it did wrong, and has\r\ncontinued doing wrong ever since; and not a century of such wrong-doing\r\ncan make the war just and right on our part. This brings us face to face\r\nwith the question, Who began the war? Who, in this contest, has assailed\r\nthe principles of 'justice, humanity, and liberty'? Who has attacked the\r\n'public welfare'? Has it been the United States Government? Let us\r\nrevert to the occasion of the war. Confining ourselves to what all\r\nparties admit--even the rebels themselves--the immediate occasion of the\r\nwar was the election of a President distasteful, for whatever cause, to\r\nthe Southern leaders. Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the\r\nUnited States under the organic law of the nation, in strict accordance\r\nwith all its modes and requirements, and none ever disputed the fairness\r\nof the election. That organic law is the Constitution, to which the\r\nSouth is bound equally with the North. The men of the Chicago\r\nConvention, who have recalled to our minds its high supremacy, neglected\r\nto express their opinion of those who, immediately on the election of\r\nPresident Lincoln, contemptuously spurned it, and have sought these\r\nthree years and a half to overthrow it and destroy the Union which it\r\nupholds.\r\n\r\nEvery sentiment of 'justice' was outraged when wicked sedition thus\r\nwithout cause reared its head against the covenant of the nation. Every\r\ninstinct of 'humanity' was stifled by the traitors who surrounded a\r\ngallant garrison of seventy men with a force of ten thousand, and opened\r\nfire on the heroes who stood by the flag that had been the glory and\r\ndefence of both for more than half a century. 'Liberty,' in all its\r\nblessed relations of home, and country, and religion, was struck at when\r\nblind ambition thus set at defiance the power of the Union, to which\r\nliberty owes its life on this continent, and its hopes throughout the\r\nworld. The constitutional liberty that is the glory of our civilization,\r\nthe liberty regulated by law that is the pride of our institutions, was\r\nattacked by those who at Montgomery fiercely defied the Constitution and\r\nlaws. And what shall we say of the constitution which these traitors to\r\ntheir country and humanity affected to establish, instead of that, the\r\nheritage of their and our Washington and his compeers, which had made\r\nour country powerful among nations, and blessed it with equal laws and\r\nequal protection to all? What shall we say of the constitution that\r\nordained slavery as the corner stone of a new confederacy, to teach\r\nmankind the folly of Christian civilization, and bring back the\r\n'statelier Eden' of the dark ages? To which party in this terrible\r\nstrife of brothers does 'liberty' look for protection to-day? Which of\r\nthe two armies of brothers now arrayed against each other on the plains\r\nof Virginia and Georgia, is fighting for the principle of order, which\r\nis the 'public welfare'? Let these questions be answered, and then it\r\nwill appear how much reason there is in the declaration that 'liberty,\r\njustice, humanity, and the public welfare' demand the 'cessation of\r\nhostilities.' On the contrary, these very principles demand that the war\r\nbe continued without abatement till they are guaranteed safe residence\r\nand sure protection under the United States Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut, it is objected, you ignore the basis on which, this 'cessation of\r\nhostilities' is proposed, namely, 'the Federal Union of the States.'\r\nThere is a word to be said in reference to this clause which will\r\nillustrate the high-toned patriotism of some of the convention which\r\nadopted it. There was an alteration in the wording of the resolution,\r\nand some of the papers printed it accordingly, '_the basis of the\r\nFederal States_.' The editor of the _New York Freeman's Journal_ (a\r\npaper which zealously supports the Chicago platform and all peace\r\nmeasures, and is called Democratic), being requested to explain which\r\nversion was correct, said, in a late issue of his journal, that in the\r\noriginal draft of the resolution 'it was not the _bold doctrine_ of\r\nFederal States;' it was the _delusion and snare_ of a Federal 'Union,'\r\nand that therefore the latter must be taken as the correct version.\r\n\r\nReplying to the above objection, we say that we neither ignore this\r\n'delusion and snare' of the Federal Union as the basis of the proposed\r\npeace, nor those other words in the fourth resolution, 'that the aim and\r\nobject of the Democratic party is to preserve the Federal Union and the\r\nrights of the States unimpaired.' The question is, how possibly to\r\nreconcile the demand for an immediate 'cessation of hostilities' with\r\nthis great anxiety to preserve the Federal Union? For the Federal Union\r\ncan only be preserved by subduing the armed rebellion that menaces it.\r\nAnything short of the absolute and thorough defeat of the Southern\r\narmies must lower the dignity of the nation, and weaken and subvert the\r\nfoundations of the Union. Thus far, by the grace of God and our right\r\narm, the Constitution and Union are preserved, and so long as they\r\n'still stand strong,' the basis of settlement remains; and whenever the\r\nrebels are tired of trying their strength against them, the nation\r\nstands ready to welcome them back, as penitent prodigals. It is not we\r\nwho are unreconciled to them: it is they who refuse to be reconciled to\r\nus. If the illustration offend no weaker brother, we may say that, like\r\nthe ever-surrounding love of God, the Federal Union is still watching\r\nover the rebels, and is only waiting the first symptom of their\r\nreturning conscience to run and fall on their necks and kiss them, and\r\nbring them in peace to the home they so foolishly left. They are\r\nstriving to destroy the Constitution and the Union. We oppose them. Let\r\nus consider what, under these circumstances, 'a cessation of\r\nhostilities' means.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, how are hostilities to cease, unless the power that\r\ncontrols the Southern armies so wills it? That power is a military\r\ndespotism. It has usurped all other power within the limits of the\r\nrebellion, and the United States Government is seeking to overthrow it,\r\nin order that the Constitution may be restored, in all its benignity, to\r\nthe people of the South, whom the usurpation has deprived of it. Is it,\r\nthen, for the United States Government to propose to the authors of this\r\nusurpation to cease seeking its total overthrow? The question recurs,\r\nmoreover, what 'cessation' have we to propose? It is for them to offer\r\nto yield: they are the aggressors, threatening the life of the nation.\r\nIs any among us so base he would have peace with dishonor? A nation\r\ncannot submit to be dishonored before the world--for its honor is its\r\nlife. Yet what sort of peace would that be which we should thus begin by\r\nseeking? It is far from pertinent to cite, as some have done, the\r\nexample of Napoleon on this point: even supposing that civil war were,\r\nin respect of this thing, the same as war between independent nations.\r\nFor Napoleon never proposed suspensions of hostilities except in his own\r\nextremity, and as a convenient means to extricate himself from\r\ndifficulties which he had the art of concealing from his adversaries.\r\nAre we in extremity, that this example of Napoleon should be suggested\r\nin support of the Chicago platform?\r\n\r\nAs to how our overtures might be received at Richmond, we are no longer\r\nleft any excuse for doubting. The oft-repeated assurances of all who\r\nhave fled from the rebel tyranny since the war was begun, are, at\r\nlength, confirmed by the authoritative declaration of Jeff. Davis\r\nhimself. It is a declaration promulgated not only by Colonel Jaquess and\r\nMr. Gilmore, in the account given by the latter of their recent visit to\r\nRichmond, but also by Mr. Benjamin, the rebel Secretary of State, in a\r\ncircular letter written for the purpose of giving the rebel account of\r\nthat visit. We are told by the rebel chief himself, that as _preliminary\r\nto any negotiations, the independence of the Southern Confederacy must\r\nbe first acknowledged_. Why does not the Chicago platform suggest a way\r\nof avoiding this difficulty? Why has it left the country in uncertainty\r\non a question so vital?\r\n\r\nBut, in the second place, suppose it were possible to have a 'cessation\r\nof hostilities' without this preliminary acknowledgment of the\r\nConfederate independence, and that the war might be at an absolute stand\r\nstill for a definite season, are we fully aware of the risks attending\r\nthis measure? For the Chicago platform has left them out of sight. 'A\r\ncessation of hostilities' is an armistice; and there is no such thing\r\nknown in the authorities on international law, or in history, as 'a\r\ncessation of hostilities' distinct from an armistice. In defining the\r\nincidents of war, Wheaton speaks of a '_suspension of hostilities by\r\nmeans of a truce_, or _armistice_,' and uses the three terms\r\ninterchangeably. In other words, whatever 'cessation (or suspension, as\r\nit is called in the books) of hostilities,' there may occur between the\r\nparties to a war, it is known among men and in history as an armistice,\r\nwhich is also the technical term for it. There would be no need to\r\nenlarge upon this point, if it had not been made already the basis of\r\nfallacious appeals to popular ignorance. Now, the incidents of an\r\narmistice are well defined, giving to both parties, besides the\r\nadvantage of time to rest, full liberty to repair damages and make up\r\nlosses of men and material; and it is perfect folly, or worse, to talk\r\nof 'a cessation of hostilities' without giving to the rebels these\r\nimportant advantages. But the controlling consideration in reference to\r\nthis whole thing, and which every person ought to ponder carefully, is\r\nthe effect of the proposed 'cessation of hostilities' upon our neutral\r\nneighbors. On this point the doctrine of international law is thus\r\nstated by the distinguished French writer, Hautefeuille, 'the eminent\r\nadvocate of neutral rights,' as he is justly called by the American\r\neditor of Wheaton, and whose works on neutral relations are always cited\r\nwith respect, and recognized as authority.\r\n\r\n     'The duties imposed on neutrals by the state of war belong\r\n     essentially to the state of war itself. From the moment it ceases,\r\n     for whatever cause, even temporarily, the duties of neutrals\r\n     likewise cease; _as to them, peace is completely restored during\r\n     the suspension of arms_. They resume then all the rights which had\r\n     been modified by the war, and can exercise them in their full\r\n     extent during the whole time fixed for the duration of the truce,\r\n     if this time has been limited by the agreement; and until the\r\n     resumption of hostilities has been officially announced to them, if\r\n     it has not been limited.'[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 'Des Droits des Nations Neutres,' t. I., p. 301]\r\n\r\nCan language be clearer? It will not do to treat it lightly. It is a\r\nstatement of what international law is on this point from an authority;\r\nand the reasons for the doctrine are clear and incontrovertible.\r\nNeutrality depends on the fact of war; when, for any cause, that fact no\r\nlonger exists, neutrality ceases likewise, of course. It is only the\r\napplication of a well-known maxim of law, that when the reason of a rule\r\nfails, the rule itself fails. Let there be 'a cessation of hostilities,'\r\nthen, as proposed in the Chicago platform, and how long would it be\r\nbefore rebel ships of war from English ports would be ready to desolate\r\nour coast, destroy our shipping, raise the blockade, and give to the\r\nrebellion the aid and sustenance it must have ere long or perish?\r\n\r\nThere is still another difficulty in the way of suspending hostilities,\r\nwhich it is well for us not to ignore. If we propose to the rebels 'a\r\ncessation of hostilities,' does not the question immediately become one\r\nof negotiation between separate Governments? Have we not in that moment,\r\nand in that thing, then recognized the Southern Confederacy as a\r\nseparate and independent Power? For does not 'a cessation of\r\nhostilities' presuppose parties of equal sovereignty on both sides?\r\nIndeed, _The London Times_ of a recent date already declares that 'it\r\nwould concede to the South a position of equality.' Such a concession\r\ncannot, for a moment, be thought of. For the very question at issue is\r\nour constitutional supremacy. When that is yielded, all is yielded. The\r\nexchanging of prisoners, and the numerous like questions that\r\nperpetually arise in the progress of war, are matters of common\r\nhumanity, that depend upon their own law. They are totally independent\r\nof the questions at issue between the parties belligerent; and our\r\ndealings with the South, in reference to such matters, cannot be\r\nconstrued into a recognition of its separate independence. If we consent\r\nto treat with the rebel chiefs, however, in regard to the very question\r\ninvolved in the war, how can we longer compel the non-interference of\r\nforeign Powers? If _we_ acknowledge the authority of Jeff. Davis to\r\nspeak for the Southern people, we cannot then take offence if other\r\nnations acknowledge him as the representative and head of a new\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nSuch and so great are the consequences of a 'cessation of hostilities,'\r\nwhich the Chicago platform proposes to the serious consideration of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears how irreconcilable are the expressions in that platform\r\nin regard to the preservation of the Federal Union, with the clearly\r\nannounced determination to propose immediately 'a cessation of\r\nhostilities.' They are vague generalities, and can have no other purpose\r\nthan to catch the popular ear so as more effectually to deceive the\r\npopular heart. That this is not a harsh judgment, consider how the four\r\nresolutions that treat of the war all hinge upon the proposition to\r\nsuspend hostilities. For they concern themselves with what? With\r\ncondemnation of the rebellion, its authors, and objects, suggesting, at\r\nthe same time, how more effectually to bring upon it its righteous\r\nretribution? Far from it. Indeed, a stranger to all that has passed in\r\nour country during the last three years, would suppose, from a study of\r\nthese resolutions, that the United States Government had usurped the\r\npower of a despotism, and that all who are not arrayed in open\r\nrebellion, against its authority were groaning under the yoke of a\r\ntyrant. The platform throughout ignores the one supreme question that is\r\nbefore the people to-day. That one question is, Shall we maintain the\r\nintegrity of the nation? It is vain to introduce other issues; they must\r\nabide the event of arms. The old maxim that in the midst of war the laws\r\nare silent, is not to be condemned. For our laws are of no avail, the\r\nnation cannot enforce them, so long as armed rebellion threatens its\r\nexistence. With the nation, all its laws, principles, vital forces, are\r\nequally menaced and imperilled; and they are, in virtue of that very\r\nfact, in abeyance, in order that they may be saved. It is said that the\r\nConstitution is not suspended because of rebellion, and this is the\r\nbasis of much declamation, both in the Chicago platform and elsewhere,\r\nagainst the exercise of extraordinary powers on the part of the\r\nPresident. But the Constitution authorizes the suspension of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, that great writ of right which is the bulwark of our\r\nAnglo-Saxon liberty, 'when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public\r\nsafety may require it;' and confers upon Congress full power to\r\nlegislate for the defence of the nation, making it then the duty of the\r\nPresident to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' What more\r\nis needed as a warrant for extraordinary power? The Chicago Convention\r\nhas appealed to the Constitution, and in that has done wisely. But what\r\nis the Constitution? It is the organic law of the nation. In virtue of\r\nit the nation exists, and by the supreme warrant of it the nation\r\nmaintains its existence against parricidal treason. Under the\r\nConstitution all power is granted to the public authorities to quell\r\ninsurrection; and the grant of a power, by one of the first principles\r\nof law, as also of common sense, implies every essential incident to\r\nmake the grant effectual.\r\n\r\nIn support of these views it is pertinent to cite the authority of an\r\napproved text writer on municipal law, whose book has appeared since\r\nthey were first written, and who has elaborately investigated the points\r\ninvolved. The result of his patient and thorough study is stated in\r\nthese propositions:\r\n\r\n     'That no civil power resides in any department of the Government to\r\n     interfere with the fundamental, personal rights of life, liberty,\r\n     and property, guaranteed by the Constitution; that a warlike power\r\n     is given by the Constitution to the President temporarily to\r\n     disregard these rights by means of the martial law; that under the\r\n     sanction of this species of law, the President and his subordinate\r\n     military officers may, within reasonable limits, suspend the\r\n     privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_, cause arrests to be made,\r\n     trials and condemnations to be had, and punishments to be\r\n     inflicted, in methods unknown to the civil procedure, but are\r\n     responsible for an abuse of the power; and that the martial law, as\r\n     a necessary adjunct of military movements, may be enforced in time\r\n     of invasion or rebellion, wherever the influence and effect of\r\n     these movements directly extends.'[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Sec.716 of 'An Introduction to Municipal Law,' by John Norton\r\nPomeroy, Esq., Professor of Law in the New York University Law School.\r\nThe whole chapter from which the extract is taken is worthy of diligent\r\nperusal, and the writer regrets that want of space alone prevents him\r\nquoting more fully from Professor Pomeroy's lucid exposition of the\r\ndoctrine of martial law under our Constitution.]\r\n\r\nThese conclusions of the law are worthy to be considered carefully in\r\nview of the solemn resolutions of the Chicago platform, that 'military\r\nnecessity' and the 'war power' are 'mere pretences' to override the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say, with reference to the third and fifth resolutions of\r\nthis platform, that they are chargeable with an equal and common\r\nignorance: the third, in ignoring the necessity of the presence of the\r\nmilitary at the elections referred to, in order that disloyalty and\r\ntreason might not openly defy the authority of the nation; the fifth, in\r\nignoring two things, first, the monstrous baseness of the rebel\r\ntreatment of our prisoners, who have been starved alive, with a\r\nrefinement of cruelty reserved for this Christian age, and practised\r\nonly by the Christian chivalry of the South; and secondly, the rebel\r\nrefusal to exchange prisoners man for man; the resolution seeking,\r\nmoreover, to charge upon the United States Government the fault of both\r\nthese rebel violations of humanity. It may be asked, moreover, in\r\nfurther reference to the third resolution, if the convention really\r\nmeant to pledge itself to revolution;[7] and why, if the President, as\r\nchief of 'the military authority of the United States,' should be guilty\r\nof any abuses, the proper remedy is not by impeachment, as provided in\r\nthe Constitution? The language of this resolution is gravely suggestive,\r\nand cannot be too closely criticised. It seems to shadow forth some dark\r\ndesign, which surely is in harmony with the whole tone of hostility to\r\nour Government that pervades the platform. Taken, moreover, in\r\nconnection with the fact that the Chicago Convention declared itself a\r\npermanent body, subject to the call of the chairman, this criticism does\r\nnot seem unreasonable; for permanent conventions have generally been the\r\nbeginning of revolution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The third resolution is, 'That the direct interference of\r\nthe military authority of the United States in the recent elections held\r\nin Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and Delaware, was a shameful violation\r\nof the Constitution, and the repetition of such acts in the approaching\r\nelection _will be held as revolutionary, and resisted with all the means\r\nand power under our control_.']\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALTIMORE PLATFORM.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore platform consists of eleven resolutions; and we may\r\nperceive at a glance the important respect in which it differs from the\r\none adopted at Chicago. That confines itself to criticism and censure of\r\nthose who are striving to uphold the Constitution and the Union against\r\nan armed rebellion, which it does not so much as by a single word\r\ncondemn. This declares the purpose of the people 'to aid the Government\r\nin quelling by force the rebellion now raging against its authority;' so\r\nthat its power shall be felt throughout the whole extent of our\r\nterritory, and its blessings be restored to every section of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to overlook this essential distinction of the two\r\nplatforms. The one is full of the captious complaint of partisanship,\r\nintent on power, and oblivious of the highest duty of patriotism in this\r\nhour of the country's need; the other recognizes no higher duty now than\r\nthe union of all parties for the sake of the Union. The one vainly cries\r\npeace when there is no peace; the other thinks not of peace except in\r\nand through the Union, without which there cannot be peace. Above all,\r\nthe one takes us back to the former times of purely party strife, and\r\nseeks to revive the political issues of the past; the other, leaving\r\n'the dead past to bury its dead,' keeps pace with the living present,\r\nand looks forward to a future of glory in a restored and regenerated\r\nUnion. For it is folly to suppose there can ever again be 'the Union as\r\nit was.' This is a superficial phrase, which it is marvellous that any\r\nreflecting person can delude himself with. 'The Constitution as it is'\r\nis the motto that condemns it; for under the Constitution we are to have\r\n'a more perfect Union,' as our fathers designed, and so stated in the\r\nConstitution itself. We are to have a constitutional Union in which\r\nevery right guaranteed by the Constitution shall be maintained; and this\r\nwas not so in 'the Union as it was.'\r\n\r\nThus it is that the Baltimore platform, after pledging the people to\r\nmaintain 'the paramount authority of the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States,' and approving the 'determination of the Government not\r\nto compromise' this authority, but holding out the same Constitution and\r\nlaws as our only and the sufficient 'terms of peace' to all who will\r\naccept them, proceeds to take notice of what none but the wilfully blind\r\nfail to perceive, the changed aspect of the slavery question. It is\r\nimpossible to hold the same position to-day in regard to this vexed\r\nquestion as in the days before the war. As an element of the politics of\r\nthis country its aspect is wholly changed, and there is no sort of\r\nconsistency in upholding our opinions of four years ago in reference to\r\nit. We do well to remember that consistency is not obstinacy. It is not\r\nan absolute, but a relative thing, and takes note of all the new\r\nelements which are ever entering into public affairs. The criterion of\r\none's political consistency in our country is unfaltering devotion to\r\nthe Union. If the measures he advocates look always to its paramount\r\nauthority, his record is truly and honorably inconsistent. On the other\r\nhand, he who forgets the end of his labors in the ardor of seeking to\r\nsave the means, is chargeable with the grossest inconsistency. What,\r\ntherefore, consists with the perpetuity and strength of the Union? is\r\nthe question which the American patriot proposes to himself.\r\n\r\nIt is in reference to this question that the Baltimore Platform\r\nchallenges comparison with the one adopted at Chicago. For guided by the\r\nexperience of the past four years (the culmination of fifty years'\r\nexperience), and noting without fear the facts which that experience has\r\nrevealed as in the clear light of midday, it declares that slavery is\r\ninconsistent with the existence of the Union. Does anybody deny it? Men\r\ntell us that the Union and slavery have heretofore, for more than half a\r\ncentury, existed together, and why may they not continue to exist in\r\nharmonious conjunction for the next half century? We are asked,\r\nmoreover, with sarcastic disdain, if our wisdom is superior to that of\r\nthe fathers. Our wisdom is not, indeed, superior to that of the fathers\r\nof the republic, but it would be far beneath it, and we should be\r\nunworthy sons of such fathers, if we undertook to carry out, in 1864,\r\nthe policies and measures of 1764. The progress of affairs has developed\r\nthe antagonism that was only latent before, but which, nevertheless,\r\nsome of the wisest of our fathers foresaw; and it is now very clear that\r\nthere is a terrible antagonism (no longer latent) between slavery and\r\nthe principles that underlie the Constitution. The time has come to\r\nvindicate the wisdom of the Constitution by utterly removing what seeks\r\nto disgrace and destroy it--as it were a viper in the bosom of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nWe must show that our Government is strong enough not only to control,\r\nbut also destroy, the interest which arrays itself in arms and war\r\nagainst it. It is useless, surely, to deny that the Southern Confederacy\r\nmeans slavery. Over and over again the Southern journals have asserted,\r\nand Southern politicians have said, that free labor was a mistake, and\r\nthat slavery was the true condition of labor. That these are the\r\ndeliberate convictions of the Southern leaders, and these the doctrines\r\non which the Montgomery constitution is based, no reflecting person can\r\nhesitate to believe; and the boastful declaration of the rebel\r\nvice-president, that slavery was the corner stone of the rebel\r\nconfederacy, serves to confirm our conclusion beyond possibility of\r\ndoubt. What these things prove is nothing more nor less than that the\r\nUnion with such an element in it to feed the ambition of politicians\r\nwith, as this slavery has shown itself to be, is henceforth impossible.\r\nFor we see now that for the sake of slavery the slaveholding leaders are\r\nwilling to destroy the Government. Who can complain if the basis of\r\ntheir rebellious scheme is annihilated? The answer to those who say,\r\nTouch tenderly the institutions of the South, is, Nay, but let them\r\nfirst cease their rebellion. Therefore, so long as the rebellion lifts\r\nits unblushing front against the Government, so long it is the duty of\r\nevery lover of the Government, in the language of the third resolution\r\nof this platform, to 'uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by\r\nwhich the Government, in its own defence, has aimed a death blow at this\r\ngigantic evil.'\r\n\r\nBut that makes us, Abolitionists, says the reader. Be it so. Are we not\r\nwilling to be Abolitionists for the sake of saving the Constitution and\r\nthe Union? And if, despising our proffers of 'the Constitution as it\r\nis,' which we have now held out to them for three years and a half, the\r\nrebels continue to defy the authority of the Government, who can\r\ncomplain if we proceed to adopt an amendment to the Constitution that\r\nshall leave no possibility of slaveholding treason hereafter? Surely\r\nnone but themselves. Let them, then, come back and vote against it; for\r\nthree fourths of all the States must concur in such an amendment before\r\nit can become part of the Constitution. Ah, the leaders of the Southern\r\nrebellion know full well how the great masses at the South would vote on\r\nsuch a measure! Let us be ready, then, acting not for ourselves alone,\r\nbut also for our deluded brethren of the South, who are to-day the\r\nvictims of a military usurpation the most monstrous the world ever saw,\r\nto put the finishing stroke to the scheme of this Confederate rebellion\r\nby adopting the proposed amendment.\r\n\r\nThe fifth resolution commits us to the approval of two measures that\r\nhave aroused the most various and strenuous opposition, the Proclamation\r\nof Emancipation and the use of negro troops. In reference to the first,\r\nit is to be remembered that it is a war measure. The express language of\r\nit is: 'By virtue of the power in me vested as commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy and navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion\r\nagainst the authority and Government of the United States, and as a _fit\r\nand necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion_.' Considered\r\nthus, the Proclamation is not merely defensible, but it is more; it is a\r\nproper and efficient means of weakening the rebellion which every person\r\ndesiring its speedy overthrow must zealously and perforce uphold.\r\nWhether it is of any legal effect beyond the actual limits of our\r\nmilitary lines, is a question that need not agitate us. In due time the\r\nsupreme tribunal of the nation will be called to determine that, and to\r\nits decision the country will yield with all respect and loyalty. But in\r\nthe mean time let the Proclamation go wherever the army goes, let it go\r\nwherever the navy secures us a foothold on the outer border of the rebel\r\nterritory, and let it summon to our aid the negroes who are truer to the\r\nUnion than their disloyal masters; and when they have come to us and put\r\ntheir lives in our keeping, let us protect and defend them with the\r\nwhole power of the nation. Is there anything unconstitutional in that?\r\nThank God, there is not. And he who is willing to give back to slavery a\r\nsingle person who has heard the summons and come within our lines to\r\nobtain his freedom, he who would give up a single man, woman, or child,\r\nonce thus actually freed, is not worthy the name of American. He may\r\ncall himself Confederate, if he will.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered, also, that the Proclamation has had a very\r\nimportant bearing upon our foreign relations. It evoked in behalf of our\r\ncountry that sympathy on the part of the people in Europe, whose is the\r\nonly sympathy we can ever expect in our struggle to perpetuate free\r\ninstitutions. Possessing that sympathy, moreover, we have had an element\r\nin our favor which has kept the rulers of Europe in wholesome dread of\r\ninterference. The Proclamation relieved us from the false position\r\nbefore attributed to us of fighting simply for national power. It placed\r\nus right in the eyes of the world, and transferred men's sympathies from\r\na confederacy fighting for independence as a means of establishing\r\nslavery, to a nation whose institutions mean constitutional liberty,\r\nand, when fairly wrought out, must end in universal freedom.\r\n\r\nWe are to consider, furthermore, that from the issuing of the\r\nProclamation dates the organization of negro troops--a measure that is\r\ndestined to affect materially the future composition, as it is\r\nbelieved, of our regular army. This is 'the employment as Union soldiers\r\nof men heretofore held in slavery,' which the fifth resolution asks us\r\nto approve. Can we not approve it? The fighting qualities of the\r\ndespised 'niggers' (as South Carolina chivalry terms the gallant fellows\r\nwho followed Colonel Shaw to the deadly breach of Wagner, reckless of\r\nall things save the stars and stripes they fought under) have been\r\ntested on many battle fields. He whose heart does not respond in\r\nsympathy with their heroism on those fields, while defending from\r\ndisgrace his country's flag, need not approve. The approval of the\r\ncountry will be given, nevertheless. There can be nothing better said,\r\non this point than President Lincoln's own words, as reported lately by\r\nJudge Mills, of Wisconsin, to whom the President uttered them in\r\nconversation. They cover also the question of the Proclamation, and will\r\nfitly conclude our discussion of these two important measures:\r\n\r\n     'Sir,' said the President, 'the slightest knowledge of arithmetic\r\n     will prove to any man that the rebel armies cannot be destroyed\r\n     with Democratic strategy. It would sacrifice all the white men of\r\n     the North to do it. There are now in the service of the United\r\n     States near two hundred thousand ablebodied colored men, most of\r\n     them under arms, defending and acquiring Union territory. The\r\n     Democratic strategy demands that these forces be disbanded, and\r\n     that the masters be conciliated by restoring them to slavery. The\r\n     black men who now assist Union prisoners to escape, they are to be\r\n     converted into our enemies in the vain hope of gaining the good\r\n     will of their masters. We shall have to fight two nations instead\r\n     of one.\r\n\r\n     'You cannot conciliate the South if you guarantee to them ultimate\r\n     success; and the experience of the present war proves their success\r\n     is inevitable if you fling the compulsory labor of millions of\r\n     black men into their side of the scale. Will you give our enemies\r\n     such military advantages as insure success, and then depend on\r\n     coaxing, flattery, and concession to get them back into the Union?\r\n     Abandon all the posts now garrisoned by black men, take two hundred\r\n     thousand men from our side and put them in the battle field or corn\r\n     field against us, and we would be compelled to abandon the war in\r\n     three weeks.\r\n\r\n     'We have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places; where\r\n     are the Democrats to do this? It was a free fight, and the field\r\n     was open to the war Democrats to put down this rebellion by\r\n     fighting against both master and slave, long before the present\r\n     policy was inaugurated.\r\n\r\n     'There have been men base enough to propose to me to return to\r\n     slavery the black warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win\r\n     the respect of the masters they fought. Should I do so, I should\r\n     deserve to be damned in time and eternity. Come what will, I will\r\n     keep my faith with friend and foe. My enemies pretend I am now\r\n     carrying on this war for the sole purpose of abolition. So long as\r\n     I am President, it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of\r\n     restoring the Union. But no human power can subdue this rebellion\r\n     without the use of the emancipation policy, and every other policy\r\n     calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the\r\n     rebellion.\r\n\r\n     'Freedom has given us two hundred thousand men raised on Southern\r\n     soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much it has subtracted from\r\n     the enemy; and instead of alienating the South, there are now\r\n     evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the\r\n     rank and file of the rebel soldiers. Let my enemies prove to the\r\n     country that the destruction of slavery is not necessary to a\r\n     restoration of the Union. I will abide the issue.'\r\n\r\nSurely these are words of exceeding good sense. They are full of a\r\nfeeling of the speaker's responsibility to God and his country; and the\r\nman who cares not for his responsibility to God, may well be distrusted\r\nby his country. Is he who speaks these words of patriotism a tyrant and\r\nusurper? Are not the words convincing proof that President Lincoln is\r\nhonest and faithful and capable? And if he thus meets those three\r\nrequirements of Jefferson's comprehensive formula, let us not refuse the\r\nlanguage of the platform: 'That we have full confidence in his\r\ndetermination to carry these and all other constitutional measures\r\nessential to the salvation of the country into full and complete\r\neffect.'\r\n\r\nThe remaining six resolutions of this platform deserve the general\r\nremark, that they declare with no uncertain sound the views of the\r\nBaltimore Convention in reference to vital questions of public policy;\r\nwhereas, the Chicago Convention has not even alluded to those questions.\r\nThat in this hour of the country's crisis, in this life struggle of the\r\nnation with foes both open and secret, there should be 'harmony in the\r\nnational councils;' that men once clothed in the uniform of United\r\nStates soldiers become entitled to 'the full protection of the laws of\r\nwar,' as forming part of the nation's defenders when those who ought to\r\nbe its defenders have joined in an unholy sedition to destroy its life;\r\nthat 'foreign immigration,' deserves especial encouragement at a time\r\nwhen the demands of the army leave the places of home labor without\r\nadequate means of refilling them; that a Pacific Railroad, uniting the\r\nextreme Western portion of the Union with all the other sections, and\r\nthus bringing within nearer reach of our California and Oregon\r\ncountrymen all the advantages and facilities of the Government, while at\r\nthe same time binding more closely the ties that make us one people with\r\nthe West equally with the South; and that the nation's faith with all\r\nits creditors must be strictly kept, be the cost what it may; all these\r\nare duties which the terrible emergency of the hour only makes more\r\nimperative and exacting of fulfilment than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh and last resolution commits the country anew to the Monroe\r\nDoctrine. In view of the great crime that is enacting in Mexico, where a\r\nforeign power has assumed to change the Government of that afflicted\r\ncountry at its own arbitrary will, the declaration that we have not\r\nabandoned the doctrine is appropriate and necessary. It is a warning\r\nthat our eyes are not closed to the schemes on foot for the suppression\r\nof republican government on this continent. While our present necessity\r\ncompels us, as of course, to act with great circumspection, yet it would\r\nbe unbecoming our dignity to quietly ignore the spoliation of Mexico. It\r\nis often said that President Lincoln, in his letter accepting the\r\nBaltimore nomination, has repudiated this resolution. These are his\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     'While the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican\r\n     government upon the Western Continent is fully concurred in, there\r\n     might be misunderstanding were I not to say that the position of\r\n     the Government in relation to the action of France in Mexico, as\r\n     assumed through the State Department, and indorsed by the\r\n     convention, among the measures and acts of the Executive, will be\r\n     faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts shall leave\r\n     that position pertinent and applicable.'\r\n\r\nIt is not fair to say that this is a repudiation of the resolution, or\r\nof the Monroe Doctrine, until it is first shown that the Government\r\n'through the State Department,' has already repudiated the doctrine. The\r\ntime for the enforcement of that doctrine has not yet come, and this\r\nseems to be the position that has been assumed by the Government. It\r\ncertainly is the position of common sense and patriotism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe candid reader has now before him a brief exposition of the two\r\nplatforms, and of the doctrines and bearing of each. It is believed that\r\nnothing has been extenuated; nor, on the other hand, has aught been here\r\nset down in malice. Let every one study the platforms and try\r\nconclusions for himself; then say whether the foregoing discussion could\r\nwell have shaped itself differently. The sum of the whole matter seems\r\nto be, War and Union, or Peace and Disunion. If we have Union, it can\r\nonly be now through war. We must 'seek peace with the sword.' The\r\nrebels have appealed from the civil law to the military law, from the\r\nConstitution to the sword; let us not shrink from the ordeal. No\r\nrevolution to perpetuate oppression can hope for the favor of a God of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThere are two platforms in this Presidential campaign, representing the\r\ntwo parties into which the voters will be divided. But there is a third\r\nparty, without platform and without vote, which has, nevertheless,\r\ninterests at stake transcending even ours. Let the calmly considered\r\nwords of an impartial English journal,[8] which wishes well to our\r\ncountry, speak, in conclusion, on behalf of that third party:\r\n\r\n     'There are three parties to the American war. There are the slaves,\r\n     the bondsmen of the South, whose flight was restrained by the\r\n     Fugitive Bill, and whose wrongs have brought about the disruption;\r\n     there are the Confederates, who, when Southern supremacy in the\r\n     republic was menaced by the election of Abraham Lincoln, threw off\r\n     their allegiance; and there are the Government and its supporters,\r\n     who are striving to restore the integrity of the Union. These are\r\n     the three parties; and as the war has gone on from year to year,\r\n     the cause of the negro has brightened, and hundreds of thousands of\r\n     the African race have passed out of slavery into freedom. They\r\n     flock in multitudes within the Federal lines, and take their stand\r\n     under the Constitution as free men. Abandoned by their former\r\n     masters, or flying from their fetters, the chattels become\r\n     citizens, and rejoice. No matter what their misery, they keep their\r\n     faces to the North, and bear up under their privations. Every\r\n     advance of the national army liberates new throngs, and they rush\r\n     eagerly to the camps where their brethren are cared for. The\r\n     exodus, continually going on, increases in volume.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 8: London Inquirer.]\r\n\r\n     'Such are the colored freedmen, the innocent victims of the war,\r\n     the slaves whom it has marvellously enfranchised; such are the\r\n     dusky clouds that flit o'er the continent of America and settle\r\n     down on strange lands--the harbingers of a social revolution in the\r\n     great republic of the West. More than fifty thousand are formed\r\n     into camps in the Mississippi Valley, and not fewer in Middle and\r\n     East Tennessee and North Alabama. It is a vast responsibility which\r\n     is cast upon the Government and the people of the North, a sore and\r\n     mighty burden; and proportionate are the efforts which have been\r\n     made to meet the trying emergency. The Government finds rations for\r\n     the negro camps, provides free carriage for the contributions of\r\n     the humane, appoints surgeons and superintendents, enlists in the\r\n     army the men who are suitable, and, as far as possible, gives\r\n     employment to all. Clothing and other necessaries are forwarded to\r\n     the camps by the ton by benevolent hands, and books for the schools\r\n     by tens of thousands. All along the banks of the Mississippi, from\r\n     Cairo to New Orleans, and in Arkansas and Tennessee, the aged and\r\n     infirm fugitives, the women and children, are collected into\r\n     colored colonies, and tended and taught with a care that is worthy\r\n     of a great and Christian people. All that can work are more than\r\n     willing to do so; they labor gladly; and among old and young there\r\n     is an eager desire for education. Books are coveted as badges of\r\n     freedom; and the negro soldier carries them with him wherever he\r\n     goes, and studies them whenever he can. It is a great work which is\r\n     in progress across the Atlantic. Providence, in a manner which man\r\n     foresaw not, is solving a dark problem of the past, and we may well\r\n     look on with awe and wonder. There were thousands of minds which\r\n     apprehended the downfall of the 'peculiar institution.' There were\r\n     a prophetic few, who clearly perceived that it would be purged away\r\n     by no milder scourge than that of war. But there were none who\r\n     dreamed that the slaveholder would be the Samson to bring down the\r\n     atrocious system of human slavery by madly taking arms in its\r\n     defence! Yet so it was; and the Divine penalty is before us. The\r\n     wrath of man has worked out the retributive justice of God. The\r\n     crime which a country would not put away from it has ended in war,\r\n     and slavery is a ruin.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES unavoidably postponed until the ensuing issue of THE\r\nCONTINENTAL.",
