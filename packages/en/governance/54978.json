BRANCH,\r\n                                  FOR\r\n                                 LIBEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor want of room we omit the evidence and insert summing up of counsel\r\nfor defendant, remarks of Mr. Branch, sentence by the Recorder and\r\nopinions of the Press:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [_From the N. Y. Express._]\r\n\r\n                        SUMMING UP FOR DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nShortly after the opening of the Court, Mr. Ashmead rose and commenced\r\nto sum up for the defence. He opened by pointing out the\r\nresponsibilities of the Jury, stating that should they find a verdict in\r\nfavor of the prosecution, it would establish a precedent which would\r\nstrike a serious blow at the liberty of the citizen. He characterized\r\nthe prosecution as one of the most extraordinary character. In\r\ncommenting on the experience of the opposing counsel, he said he\r\nremembered a comment by a most eminent divine, on the words of Solomon,\r\n“I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their\r\nbread,” namely, that what Solomon had not seen he had. He spoke strongly\r\nagainst the fact that the prosecution had originated with the Grand\r\nJury, instead of taking the action before a committing magistrate,\r\nhaving a preliminary examination. Here was a citizen, humble if they\r\npleased, on one side, while on the other was the Mayor of the greatest\r\ncity in the New World, and these officers of the Grand Jury, forgetting\r\nthat in this republic all should be treated alike, encroached upon the\r\nliberty of this citizen by stepping out of their usual course. Should\r\nthe jury adopt the precedent of convicting a man under such\r\ncircumstances, then God help the liberty of the citizen; but the\r\nconsequences would rest upon the heads of them and their children. [Mr.\r\nAshmead here read extracts from the opinions of eminent Judges, showing\r\nthat a prisoner had a right to a preliminary examination before the case\r\ncould go before the Grand Jury.] But this unfortunate man was not so\r\nserved; he knew nothing of the accusation, nor was he brought face to\r\nface with his powerful accusers. Were this man immaculate, he stood,\r\nunder these circumstances, subject to all the lightning elequence of the\r\nopposite side, and was not able to do as was his right, namely, bring an\r\naction for damages against his accusers, because the responsibility\r\nrested with the public prosecutor.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead continued to read from the same book, contending that no\r\nindictment should be smuggled into a Grand Jury room as this had been.\r\nThe Mayor, or the Governor, or His Honor on the Bench had no right to\r\nadopt a system denied to the meanest citizen; and in their anxiety to\r\npunish crime, they should take care that they did not strike a blow at\r\nthe liberty of the community, nor should Judicial Legislation take away\r\nthe rights of the citizen. The Jury should take care that this man was\r\nnot made a victim through the variation of the Grand Jury from the usual\r\ncourse; but they should follow the example of English Grand Juries, and\r\ntake care how they struck a blow at Constitutional rights. He next\r\nreferred to the noble speech of Robert Emmet, before Lord Norbury, who\r\nseveral times attempted to stop the criminal when speaking before he was\r\nsentenced. He said: “Though I am to be sacrificed, I insist that all the\r\nforms be gone through.” Let the Jury, then do as Emmet did to Lord\r\nNorbury—make the Mayor go through the forms. (Here McKeon smiled.) And\r\nthough the District Attorney should smile at these remarks, this matter\r\nwas serious, and a laugh and a sneer were not an argument. He referred\r\nto the case of the libel of MacIntosh, where, it was asserted, there was\r\non one side a Napoleon, the ruler of the greatest empire in the world,\r\nand on the other, as in this case, a poor and obscure citizen; yet in\r\nthat case a British Jury taught future generations a lesson, and showed\r\nan example which an American Jury should endeavor to follow.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead next read from the revised statutes, showing that an accused\r\nperson should have a preliminary examination before being indicted, and\r\ncontended that a great privilege had been taken from his client, and by\r\nthis means a blow had been struck at the liberties of the citizen. He\r\nalluded to the fact that Mr. Draper had not been before the Grand Jury\r\nat all, and yet this poor man had been indicted for a libel on him; this\r\nwas a proceeding which, if sanctioned by the Jury, would establish a\r\nperfect tyranny by breaking down all the safeguards of the law which\r\nsurrounded the citizen. He insisted that the prosecution had taken away\r\nevery privilege from this man, and environed him by a wall, so that he\r\ncould not escape, by getting up this Trinity of indictments. These three\r\nindictments were united so that one should support the other. The\r\nRecorder had said that Mr. Draper was old enough to take care of\r\nhimself, but wisdom didn’t come with length of year, and certainly\r\nSimeon Draper was not bred in the school of Chesterfield, for he forgot\r\ncommon courtesy by saying the alleged libel was a lie. Mr. Ashmead then\r\ncommented on the conduct of the prosecution in putting in only one half\r\nof the libel in the indictment, and keeping out that part which had a\r\nfoundation in truth, which he said was a piece with the remainder of\r\nthese proceedings. Such conduct struck a serious blow at our free\r\ninstitutions, and as Erskine said if such proceedings were to obtain,\r\nour halls of justice would be turned into altars, and the poor victim\r\nwould be immolated at the shrine of persecution.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead then proceeded to explain the law of libel, contending that\r\nit was necessary that “malice” should be proved, in order to sustain an\r\nindictment for libel. He spoke of the law in England, which would not\r\npermit the truth to be given in evidence, and contrasted such with the\r\nlaws of New York, which provided that if an article was published\r\nwithout malice, it was not libellous; for it permitted a reporter to\r\npublish the proceedings of a meeting or of a legislative body without\r\nholding him liable, provided it was proved that it had been published\r\nwithout malice. The counsel then commented on the remark made by the\r\nRecorder relative to his taking no decisions but his own, and that Mr.\r\nAshmead’s points would not be fit for a Kamschatka Court, and proceeded\r\nto justify his own course in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Recorder remarked that Mr. Ashmead must have forgotten his own\r\nobservations, he had said that “a certain decision had been made by one\r\nof the Judges of this Court” and that caused his Honor to make the\r\nremark to which he had alluded.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead replied that it had been so ruled in this Court in the case\r\nof Coleman vs. Magoon, in 1818. The Counsell then pointed out the fact\r\nthat Mayor Tiemann had testified that he had been spoken to on this\r\nsubject nearly a year ago, and wanted to know why he had not then\r\npursued the originator of these stories. This showed clearly that Branch\r\ndid not originate the alleged libel, and that therefore there was no\r\nmalice on his part.—He complained that the testimony for the defence had\r\nbeen entirely shut out by objections, and asked why the Mayor did not\r\ncome in manfully and clear his skirts of these charges, without\r\nshielding himself under technicalities. He, however, did not pursue the\r\noriginator of this story, but when this poor man who considered himself\r\na sentinel upon the watch-tower of this great city, exposed what he\r\nconsidered to be corruption in high places, then the Mayor pounced upon\r\nhim. Why did not the Mayor go into the civil court, as he could have\r\ndone, and then this poor man could stand on an equal footing with him,\r\nand tell his own story? In God’s name if they wanted a victim let them\r\ntake him, but they should not condemn him without show of a trial. If a\r\nsacrifice was required Mr. Branch was ready to be immolated; but here\r\nwas an extraordinary fact. Why did not Mayor Tieman bring forward the\r\nmatron? He had seen her before witnesses. If this thing was done, no one\r\nknew it but his Excellency the Mayor, and this lady. No eye but that of\r\nthe Omniscient One above, saw the act if it had occurred? Why, then, did\r\nhe not bring this lady here, and then if she swore that it did not\r\noccur, there was an end of the matter. But they might ask, why did not\r\nhe (Counsel) bring the lady? For a very sensible and legal reason,\r\nbecause, if he had brought her into Court, she would become his own\r\nwitness, and he could not bring evidence to contradict her, whereas, if\r\nMayor Tiemann had put her on the stand, and she had told her statement,\r\nthen they could have cross-examined her and brought Evans and other\r\nwitnesses to contradict her. If, therefore, the prosecution had examined\r\nher, and other evidence would have been admitted which had been shut\r\nout, but by the course the prosecution had pursued half the defence was\r\nmade non-effective. He admitted that what was acknowledged by the Mayor\r\ndid not amount to proof, yet it was very extraordinary. The Mayor\r\nadmitted that there was a friend who visited the lady whom he ordered\r\nshould not be allowed on the island.—There was no impropriety shown in\r\nthese visits; he came every Sunday, he behaved himself, and yet he was\r\ninterdicted. Now there was other matrons there; they had friends, no\r\ndoubt, and yet this lady was the only one selected for deprivation of\r\nher friend’s society. This to say the least of it was very\r\nextraordinary. Another thing, the Mayor had lent this lady money, but he\r\nlent money to no other matron. Now this was curious, if he was simply\r\nfriendly to this lady he would not prevent her other friends from coming\r\nto see her, or did he give this money to the lady, and give her the\r\nmoney for her torn dress to compensate her for interdicting her friend\r\nfrom visiting the island?\r\n\r\nBut this was not alone,—Mr. Draper suspended this lady, and the Mayor\r\npersuaded her to write an apologetic note, and so she got restored. Now\r\nthis was a friend indeed a friend he was going to say that “sticketh\r\ncloser than a brother” (laughter), but he allowed her to have no friend\r\nbut himself, although one would suppose that a lone woman should be\r\nsurrounded by friends. Now these little things loomed up curiously, but\r\nhis honor was not content with being _her_ friend, he was the friend of\r\nher boy? He said it was his duty to procure situations for boys; yes,\r\ncertainly; but this boy was not then in New York at all—he was in the\r\nfar West, and not under the control of the Alms House Governors at all.\r\nHe had been sent safely away from the temptations of this great\r\nMetropolis: and yet the Mayor brought him back, and provided for\r\nhim—proving himself the friend of the boy’s mother in every way, except\r\nthat of letting her other friend come on the island. The Mayor was\r\nwilling to lend her money, to get her boy a situation, to get her\r\nfriend, Waters, a situation, and to do everything for her except to\r\nallow her friend to see her. He did not say that this proved anything\r\nagainst Mayor Tiemann; he was an honorable and upright man, as far as\r\nCounsel knew; but these little circumstances looked suspicious, and it\r\nwas curious that the Mayor had shut out the rest of the testimony. The\r\nwhole case however showed that Mr. Branch had not fabricated these\r\nstories, and certainly did not publish them with malice; and therefore\r\nhe ought to be acquitted. Mr. Ashmead then referred to an extraordinary\r\nconversation between Justice Buller and Mr. Erskine, in a libel case,\r\nwhere the Jury returned a verdict of “guilty of publishing ONLY” the\r\nJudge wanted the word _only_ left out, and Mr. Erskine defended the\r\nverdict, notwithstanding that the Judge threatened to proceed in another\r\nmanner. Erskine replied that he knew his duty as an advocate, as well as\r\nHis Lordship knew his as a Judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead then submitted several points,—upon which he argued,—namely:\r\nThat if the libel was published with an honest motive, then the\r\ndefendant was guiltless: that the Jury, in Libel cases were judges of\r\nthe law as well as of the fact, they having the right and the sole right\r\nto determine what was and what was not a libel, and this was the law in\r\nEngland and Ireland, also. He contended that according to the Mayor’s\r\ntestimony the base of the libel was true, and if so, he begged and\r\npleaded that the Jury would not, for the sake of truth, for the sake of\r\nan innocent man, for the sake of a newspaper publisher, who did not\r\nfabricate what he wrote, for the sake of the liberty of the press,\r\nimmolate this humble citizen. But, he concluded, if Branch must be\r\nimmolated, he had only to say in the words of that immortal Irishman\r\nCurran:—\r\n\r\n“If it be determined that because this man would not bow to power and\r\nauthority, because he would not bow down to the golden calf and worship\r\nit, he should be cast in the fiery furnace, I do trust in God that there\r\nis a redeeming spirit in the constitution which will go with the\r\nsufferer through the flames and preserve him unhurt by the\r\nconflagration.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead sat down amid a burst of applause, which was immediately\r\nchecked. His speech which occupied about an hour and a half, was spoken\r\nof by several as one of the most brilliant specimens of logical\r\neloquence which has been heard in this Court for years. It was listened\r\nto with breathless attention by the largest audience which had assembled\r\ninside those walls since the Huntingdon trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       [_From the New York Sun._]\r\n\r\n                      STEPHEN H. BRANCH’S SPEECH.\r\n\r\nMy counsel has done well. He has made an effort of which I am proud, and\r\nof which your Honor ought to be proud.\r\n\r\nThe Recorder—I am, sir.\r\n\r\nBranch—I am sorry that I have not prepared to address you. I came to\r\nthis country thirty-five years ago, a poor boy. I got a clerk’s\r\nsituation at $2 a week. Then I went to Leary’s hat store, in Water\r\nStreet. Afterwards I went to Harper’s, then to the New York _American_,\r\nand afterwards to the _Evening Post_. Then I returned to Rhode Island,\r\nand went afterwards to Boston, Hartford, Springfield and New Haven, and\r\nworked at the printing business, and was the first compositor on the\r\nWashington _Globe_. and set up the first article on that paper, which\r\nwas a comment on the conduct of General Jackson, from the pen of Amos\r\nKendall. I then took a room with Edward Dodge, of Philadelphia, and\r\nroomed with him some time. My father sent me a letter from Providence,\r\nand procured for me a situation in the Post Office, and I was there four\r\nor five years. I became ambitious, and studied at nights. I studied with\r\nThomas F. Carpenter. I left the Post Office, and continued my Greek and\r\nLatin studies. I returned to the Post Office, but such was my desire for\r\nlearning that I went to Cambridge Law School, and studied under Judge\r\nStory. I mingled with Southern students, and spent much money. They were\r\nhigh-bloods, and I spent a dissolue winter. I came back, and went to\r\nAndover, where I resumed my studies in Greek and mathematics. I then\r\nleft for Providence, and was unfortunate in my domestic life. I left\r\nProvidence and went to Washington, where I got $10 a week at the\r\nprinting business. I went next to Columbia College, when I would take my\r\nbasket of bread and butter, work all day at the job office, walk back to\r\nthe College at ten o’clock at night, and study till daylight. I would\r\nthen get to the office at seven in the morning. I lost my health in\r\ndoing this, and was reduced to the verge of the grave. My father\r\nremained true to me, notwithstanding my domestic misfortunes. I came to\r\nNew York, and saw an advertisement in a paper, that a teacher was wanted\r\nin Alabama. I secured the situation, and afterwards went to\r\nApalachicola, thence to Alabama, and taught school. I found they were\r\ncruel to slaves there. The lady on the plantation used to whip the\r\nslaves early in the morning; it disgusted me, and I went to New Orleans.\r\nMy brother Albert printed the New Orleans _Times_. I advertised for a\r\nsituation as teacher, and soon secured one. I remained there till my\r\nbrother Albert died—no, I am mistaken, he did not die then. I came to\r\nNew York, and had but little money left. I could not work at the\r\nprinting business. My father sustained me in the sun and rain, although\r\nhe was a man of limited means though of high position, for he was a\r\nJudge of Rhode Island. I went to Arthur Tappan, who introduced me to his\r\nbrother Lewis. I told him that I wanted to teach colored scholars. I\r\nsuppose you will call me a lunatic for that. I told him my\r\nqualifications, and he sent me to Mr. Van Rensselaer, under the _Journal\r\nof Commerce_. I taught a colored boy for him, for which he gave me my\r\nboard. I lost my health, and finally—but I won’t mention names—I taught\r\na candidate for Alderman of the Fourteenth Ward. That was the first\r\npublic man I ever taught in New York. There was a man named Gouraud, a\r\nFrenchman, a teacher of the art of memory. I found he was trying to\r\nhumbug the public. I saw he was an impostor, and exposed him. He had\r\nsecured the press and the people, and I exposed him. I attended his\r\nlectures, and saw there William Cullen Bryant, Horace Greeley, Judge\r\nOakley, and all the leading men and women of the city. His system was an\r\nexploded system of the Sixteenth Century. I exposed him in various\r\ncities. I exposed him, and stopped him. He was denounced in\r\nPhiladelphia. Through educating public men, I got into politics. There\r\nmay be a desire to get me into prison as soon as possible, and so I will\r\nbe brief.\r\n\r\nThe Recorder—There is no desire to get you into prison, Mr. Branch.\r\n\r\nBranch—I taught the Aldermen till the California mania broke out, when I\r\nwent to California. I wrote a letter to the New York _Herald_, about\r\nalligators on the Isthmus, which gave me the title of “Alligator.” I\r\ntaught servants and public men. Alfred Carson wanted me to write his\r\nreports for him, which I did. In 1855, I got into the Matsell campaign.\r\nI pursued _him_. You all know the result. I went to Brandon, England, to\r\nfind his birth-place, and I found it. Soon after I saw Carson, I found\r\nthat the officers of this city were very corrupt. Carson asked me to\r\nwrite his reports. He informed me that the officers around the City Hall\r\ninterfered with the affairs of the Fire Department. I advised him to\r\nresist it, I wrote his reports for some years, I got through with the\r\nFrenchman, Gouraud. I got through with teaching public men and servants,\r\nand with the fire and Matsell campaign. I thought I would start the\r\n_Alligator_. I did, and _I don’t regret it_. There is a gang of thieves\r\naround the City Hall, and your Honor knows it, and we all know it. I\r\npursued them hard, days and nights for years, in defence of honesty,\r\nindustry, and the tax-payers, rich and poor, but especially the poor,\r\nwho go to corner groceries, barefooted, naked, who live in attics. I—a\r\nlunatic, so-called, have passed my days in their defence. Ask Carson;\r\nask Harry Howard—I saw him here to-day—ask the editors, if I have not\r\npassed the midnight hours in their editorial habitations—if I have not\r\nbeen true to them, to Carson, and all for whom I professed friendship—to\r\nall whom I found advocating the cause of the poor tax-payers? Do I\r\nregret the establishment of the _Alligator_? No; and why? I have\r\nattacked thieves indiscriminately. Hitherto these men had reputation as\r\npublic officers, and amid tears oftentimes, my shafts have fallen\r\nharmless. But now, I have struck at a dynasty which has existed in this\r\ncity for thirty years, the Peter Cooper guild. He was Alderman in 1828,\r\n’29, and ’40. Tiemann was Alderman in 1839, ’44, ’62, and ’63. Through\r\nDenman, who was a pupil of mine, I first heard that Tiemann and Cooper\r\nwere corrupt men.\r\n\r\nThe Recorder—Mr. Branch, I must stop you. You cannot be allowed to use\r\nsuch language In this Court.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashmead—Will your Honor remember the case of Lord Norbury, to which\r\nI drew your attention this morning?\r\n\r\nRecorder—I remember Lord Norbury, and every other lord, but I cannot\r\npermit such language.\r\n\r\nBranch—I will spare your feelings. Peter Cooper and his daughter I\r\ntaught in his own house. He does not deny it; but, if I had taught my\r\nfather, and was satisfied he was corrupt, I would trample him down. I\r\nhave attacked the Mayoralty, and for that I am on my way to a prison.\r\n_Send me there._ I will walk with a firm step to my dungeon. Before\r\nGod—before God, I declare with my hand on my heart, that this is the\r\nhappiest moment of my life. What have I stolen? Whom have I murdered?\r\nWhat crime have I committed? I have pursued the plunderers of the\r\nmasses, and for that you send me to a dungeon. You can desert me—the\r\nprosecution can oppress me, but God—but God will not desert me. Your\r\nprisoner is ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                  New York, Saturday, August 14, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IN MY CELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn either side of me are three murderers, and my cell has a murderer’s\r\nlock. My bed is straw, with a blanket. I slept well last night, and had\r\na good breakfast this morning, which my keeper kindly procured for me,\r\nand who has extended the kindness of a brother towards me, in obtaining\r\nevery thing I desired for my comfort, and in permitting my friends to\r\nvisit me. I have read all the daily papers; and to Horace Greeley,\r\nDoctor Frank Tuthill of the _Times_, and to James and Erastus Brooks,\r\nfor their genial sympathy, I express my cordial gratitude. The _Courier\r\n& Enquirer_ is silent, and that is preferable to denunciation, in my\r\nshackles and dungeon gloom. Bennett lashes me with the stings of a\r\nscorpion, who has fattened on libel and obscenity, and blasphemy, and\r\nblack mail, from the dawn of his infamous editorial career. In his aged\r\nvisions he often beholds the poor creatures whom his defamation hurled\r\ninto premature graves. Halleck, of the _Journal of Commerce_, is brief\r\nbut bitter in his comments on my alleged lunacy. The _Daily News_ I have\r\nnot seen, but I learn that its anathema of me is terrible, and has a\r\nbulletin against me written in letters of blood. Its former editor, Mr.\r\nAuld, is the Mayor’s Clerk, which accounts for the severe comments of\r\nthe _News_. But the article in the _Sun_ grieved me more than all the\r\nphillippics of my editorial adversaries. The _Sun_ has clung to me for a\r\ndozen years, and to have it desert me now, is like the fatal stab of\r\nBrutus at Caesar. But I will forgive Moses S. Beach and John Vance of\r\nthe _Sun_ for their deep and unexpected gashes in my heart. Let all my\r\nfriends be cheerful, when I inform them that neither sighs nor tears\r\nhave passed from my lips or eyes, and that I only grieve at the official\r\nstabs at the liberty of speech and of the press, which the people will\r\nbe sure to avenge, and soon consign the Grand Jury Inquisitions to the\r\nSpanish despots, and all their advocates to an ignominious destiny.\r\n\r\n                                                    STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [_From the N. Y. Express._]\r\n\r\nTHE BRANCH LIBEL CASE.—Stephen H. Branch has been convicted of a gross\r\nand malicious libel upon Mayor Tiemann, Simeon Draper, and Isaac Bell,\r\nand has been sentenced to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for one\r\nyear, to pay a fine of $250, and stand committed until that sum shall be\r\npaid. The scene at the closing of the Court on Wednesday was a very\r\nmelo-dramatic one, and fully in keeping with all the previous steps in\r\nthis extraordinary case. Mr. Branch being asked what he had to say why\r\nsentence should not be pronounced against him, made a long speech, in\r\nwhich he reviewed the various events of his somewhat eccentric life; but\r\njust as he commenced to allude to the libels, and to speak thereon and\r\nthe persons aggrieved, the court stopped him. The prisoner bore himself\r\nwith the air of a martyr to the cause of public virtue, and said it was\r\nthe happiest and proudest day of his life; but his excitement at the\r\nclose of his address was very great, and his delivery vehement and\r\nearnest almost to weeping. The court was full of his sympathizers, who\r\ndid not scruple to say that they believed the convict to be more sinned\r\nagainst than sinning.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary case will long be remembered. The libels published\r\nand circulated by Mr. Branch were the most outrageous ever perpetrated\r\nin this city, and the prosecution has been in keeping with the\r\nprovocation, amounting in its virulence almost to a persecution.\r\nCircumstances on the trial favored the presumption that the whole of the\r\nproceedings had been decided upon in advance, even to the wording of the\r\nrecorder’s charge and sentence. His honor himself informed the counsel\r\nfor the prisoner that he had considered his possible application for a\r\nsuspension of judgment, had examined the point, and had made up his mind\r\nthat such a motion could not be allowed. Every precaution had been\r\ntaken. The whole power of the corporation—executive, legal, judicial—was\r\ninvoked to annihilate Mr. Branch, and the end was attained. The offence\r\nwas outrageous, and will admit of no palliation; but it was hardly good\r\ntaste in the powerful complainants to take every advantage of a criminal\r\nwhom many believe to be a monomaniac, and by the extreme vindicativeness\r\nof the prosecution, give to the administration of public justice the\r\nappearance of private revenge.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in the case were worthy of the best days of the criminal\r\nbar of New York. Mr. Ashmead distinguished himself highly in his appeal\r\nfor the prisoner, and had the case gone to the jury before the cool and\r\ndispassionate reasoning of Mr. McKeon had partially weakened the effect\r\nof Mr. Ashmead’s eloquence, the result might have been different. The\r\ncharge of the Recorder was decidedly against the prisoner, and his\r\nsentence, it will be seen, was severe in its terms to an excess that was\r\nnot called for. The punishment imposed was the extent of the law, and\r\nwas by no means disproportioned to the offence; but it was entirely\r\ngratuitous on the part of the Recorder to drag into his remarks matters\r\nextraneous to the issue, and not at all connected with the present\r\ntrial. The Recorder’s announcement of the rod he has in pickle for\r\ncertain other libellers who he intimates are shortly to be tried, will\r\nprobably put those prospective culprits upon their guard, and they will\r\nat least have this advantage over Mr. Branch that they will not be taken\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the distinguished citizens whose characters have been\r\ncleared again by this conviction of Mr. Branch; but can assure them that\r\ntheir fair fame by no means suffered so much from the attacks of the\r\n“ALLIGATOR” as they presumed that it did.\r\n\r\nWe understand that Mr. Ashmead will to-day prepare a bill of exceptions,\r\nand move in the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari and stay of\r\nproceedings. The bill will not be settled until late in the day, and the\r\nmotion in the Supreme Court cannot be made until to-morrow. In case,\r\ntherefore, that Mr. Branch should be sent to Penitentiary to-day, the\r\nmotion will not avail him. It is hardly to be presumed that when a\r\nmotion for arrest of judgment was denied without argument, the prisoner\r\nwill be allowed time to benefit by an appeal to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [_From the N. Y. Tribune._]\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H. BRANCH was yesterday convicted of a gross libel on Mayor\r\nTiemann and others, and sentenced by the Recorder to the Penitentiary\r\nfor one year, and to pay a fine of $250. Considering that the libel,\r\nhowever groundless essentially, appears to have had a real foundation in\r\nstatements made to Branch by persons whom he undoubtedly believed, and\r\nwhom his counsel had ready to produce (but their testimony was not\r\nallowed), we must consider this sentence a severe one. We believe it\r\nwill excite for him a sympathy which it is unwise to provoke. Branch, we\r\nbelieve, has been trying pretty hard to libel _us_ in his abusive little\r\nsheet; but we have never considered his slanders worth any sort of\r\nnotice. It may be well to stop his career, but not to make him a martyr.\r\nAnd we say most decidedly, that considering the libel for which he was\r\nindicted was really based on information furnished him by persons whom\r\nhe had reason to believe, we deem his sentence a harsh one, and trust it\r\nmay be mitigated by pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [_From the New York Times._]\r\n\r\nThe verdict and the sentence startled a great many people. BRANCH was\r\nimmediately surrounded by a troop of friends, who nearly shook his hands\r\noff with their greetings. He was followed to the Tombs by a large crowd,\r\nwho only left him at the gates of that edifice. But though incarcerated\r\nin prison, we have not as BRANCH says, heard the last of BRANCH.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ALLIGATORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PANAMA, New Granada, }\r\n                                                       Jan. 7, 1849. }\r\n\r\nJAMES GORDON BENNETT,\r\n    _Editor of the N. Y. Herald_:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen three miles from Panama, I saw two spires of the largest and most\r\nimposing cathedrals here—larger than any church in America. On either\r\nside I beheld the Cordileras and the Andes, towering high up towards the\r\nglorious sun—the Cordileras connecting the Andes with the Rocky\r\nMountains. As you near the city, you are gradually lead upon a\r\nbeautifully paved road—paved by Pizzaro, the fiend, under whose\r\nsuperintendence the path from there to Cruces was made, through which\r\nPizzaro, with his terrible banditti, often passed. On entering the city,\r\nthe natives outside the gates were singing and dancing merrily in honor\r\nof some festival. Boys were flying their kites on the road, which they\r\nseemed to enjoy like the youth of all countries. There kites were made\r\nin the form of a coffin, and fringed on the sides with a very curious\r\ntail, partially resembling a rattlesnake. The more genteel natives wore\r\nwhite dresses and Panama hats. These hats are not made in Panama, but at\r\nSt. Helena, and other places on the coast, which was news for me. Panama\r\ncontains an impoverished population, whose leading maintenance is a few\r\nmerchants of very little energy, who deal in British drillings and\r\nmanufactures of various kinds. There are some choice relics of the old\r\nCastilians who are never seen in the streets by day, but who walk in\r\ntheir rear balconies in the evening to inhale the tropic air. The female\r\nCastilians are as beautiful as the Georgians or Circassians, and will\r\nnot recognize the common natives, nor even the English or Americans, nor\r\nthe aristocracy or nobility of any country as their equals. I had the\r\nfortune, through influential letters to a large mercantile house here,\r\nto get an introduction to a Castilian family, and I was invited to a\r\nrural gathering of the friends and relatives of this family. The\r\nloveliest girl I ever saw is the daughter of the gentleman who is at the\r\nhead of the family. To attempt a description of her accomplishments and\r\nextraordinary personal fascinations, would be as impossible as to\r\ndescribe the horrors of a trip up the Chagres, and especially the defile\r\nfrom this to Cruces, which still haunts, and will haunt me for a long\r\nperiod. The best description I can convey to my countrymen of the river\r\nChagres, is its comparison with the river Styx, and you can form a\r\nslight conception of the defile between this and Cruces by its\r\ncomparison with purgatory, as described by an illiterate and boisterous\r\nparson; and you can appreciate the loveliness of this Castilian female,\r\nby fancying that she is the very prototype of the unearthly Cleopatra,\r\nthe accomplished and captivating queen of ancient Egypt, who was\r\nfamiliar with all the dialects of the East (thirty in number), whose\r\nglowing eloquence and brilliant eye, and majestic form, and perfect\r\nsymmetry of mind and body and feature, only could have allured the\r\neloquent, rich, and noble Anthony from his ambition of military glory\r\nand his love of his native country. The Cathedral is dingy and very\r\ngloomy. All the bells are cracked, and their doleful tones thrill the\r\nsenses. I saw the leading priest to-day, who seems very old and infirm.\r\nIn front of the Cathedral, are the Twelve Apostles, with the Saviour.\r\nThe spires are adorned with pearls, with which the coast abounds. I have\r\nvisited the temples, jails, walls, churches, old governors’ palaces and\r\ntrenches, and my heart was filled with pensive emotions, as I gazed on\r\nthese crumbling ruins of other generations. The best idea I can give\r\nabout this place, is its comparison with New York, after the great fires\r\nof 1835 and ’46. The tortures and mode of life here are very peculiar. I\r\nslept on a bare cot, and with only one sheet over me—sweat like blazes.\r\nThe meats and cooking are extremely novel. Lizzards, spiders,\r\nmusquitoes, galinippers and ants, crawl around and over me, and often\r\npenetrate the ears and nose. Some lizzards gathered around my head the\r\nother night and awoke me, which I scattered very quick. I think they\r\nwere preparing to play some trick on me, and perhaps even contemplated\r\nthe decapitation of my beloved proboscis, as one of the rascals was\r\nsmelling around my nostrils when I suddenly awoke. I hate lizzards, but\r\nI can stand spiders and alligators, and the other animalculae of the\r\ncountry tolerably well. A girl only ten years of age was married to-day.\r\nThis seems incredible, but you may repose implicit confidence in its\r\ntruth. Females mature more rapidly here than in any other part of the\r\nearth. At eight and nine there is often every indication of puberty. I\r\nsaw the young “lady” of ten, who was married to-day. I was utterly\r\nastonished at her prodigious maturity. She was extremely beautiful, and\r\nher glances were bewitching, and she seemed very devoted to her young\r\nand enthusiastic lover. It rains or pours in these latitudes ten months\r\nin the year, which the natives call the wet season. The other two months\r\nare called the dry season, when it only rains about twelve times a day.\r\nThe lightning is sometimes incessant, and the thunder is terrific and\r\nmakes the alligators look glassy about the eye. We had a shock of an\r\nearthquake last night which lasted some seconds. It created quite a\r\nsensation among the emigrants, but it did not terrify the natives, as\r\nthey are used to earthquakes. A small lizzard crawled into the ear of an\r\nemigrant, who lives near the shore, which nearly killed him. I attended\r\nthe Cathedral this morning, and the music and ceremonies were grateful\r\nto my heart. After the solemn scenes of last week, and the death of a\r\nbeloved friend on Tuesday last. The attendance was not large. Youth,\r\nage, decrepitude, competence, affluence, penury and utter rags, all\r\nknelt side by side. Six priests of various grades were present. As I\r\ngazed on these splendid ruins, at the images, paintings and costly\r\ndecorations, and grasped a retrospect of the long line of generations of\r\nSpanish nobility who had worshipped in its sacred aisles, and gazed down\r\nto the sepulchres of their fathers, contrasting this dismal structure\r\nwith its tottering walls and spires, with its ancient glory, and as I\r\ngazed on its wildness and dilapidated magnificence, I was impressed with\r\nthe most solemn and overwhelming emotions. Last evening I visited the\r\nramparts, that encircle a portion of the city. The work is truly\r\nbeautiful and exhilarating at early twilight, when the burning sun is\r\ngone, and when, as in last evening, the full moon was emerging with\r\nuncommon splendor from the far horizon of a tranquil sea. A group of\r\nlovely children just passed my window, followed by their slaves, with\r\ngorgeous turbans clad in red, white and blue. A passenger just entered\r\nmy apartment and informs me that while dozing in his canoe on the banks\r\nof the Chagres, he was suddenly aroused from his slumber and saw an\r\nenormous alligator crawling over the base of his canoe, when he sprang\r\nand leaped to the shore and ran for his life up the embankment with the\r\nalligator in hot pursuit, which nearly caught him by the tail of his\r\ncoat. He rushed into the hut of a friendly native, and closed and barred\r\nthe door, and flew to the roof, where he found piles of stones for\r\ndefensive operations, and immediately opened a battery of flying stones\r\nat the alligator, causing him to retreat and disappear beneath the\r\nwaters of the Chagres. There are turkey buzzards in countless thousands\r\nhovering over the city, which greatly alarm the natives. Such flocks\r\nwere never seen before. The timid and superstitious natives predict the\r\nmost awful visitations from the sudden appearance of so many buzzards,\r\nwhich darken the air like a cloud with their hideous presence. Some of\r\nthe natives prognosticate a famine, or others fatal convulsions of\r\nnature. My chum predicts extraordinary heat (theremometer now about 100\r\nin the shade), and a shower of rain (only rained six times to-day,) and\r\nother calamities. But I do not fear these terrible disasters from the\r\nadvent of large flocks of turkey buzzards, as I have been taught to\r\nscout every thing in the form of representation.\r\n\r\n                                                    STEPHEN H.

T. VALENTINE,\r\n                                                                Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Hon. the Mayor and Common Council of the city of New York.\r\n\r\nThe subscriber takes this method to present to your Hon. Body, certain\r\nimprovements for the prevention and extinguishing of fires, to give\r\ngreater efficiency to the police and greatly lessen the labors of the\r\nFire Department, and at the same time give greater security to life and\r\nproperty, and the government of our city.\r\n\r\nYour subscriber is of the opinion, that these improvements will, if\r\nadopted, result in great benefit to the City, State and Nation.\r\n\r\nA good government in this city, like the heart of a great body, will\r\nmake itself felt throughout our State, our Nation, and to some extent\r\nthroughout the world. Desiring greatly to secure for my native city, the\r\ninestimable blessings of good government I have ventured to propose and\r\nurgently recommend, to the serious consideration of your Hon. body, a\r\nplan founded on a principle, that I believe will do more to bring about\r\nsecurity, order and good government, than any and all other measures,\r\nthat are within the range of our municipal powers, to adopt. The plan\r\nand principle to which I allude, will make it directly the dollar and\r\ncent interest, of some three-quarters of all the officers in the employ\r\nof the city government to faithfully perform their duty.\r\n\r\nIf this can be shown to be conveniently practicable, it must be admitted\r\nthat it would bring about greater efficiency in the execution of all\r\nuseful laws and ordinances, than any other means which have ever been\r\napplied to the government of our city.\r\n\r\nBefore I attempt a description of this plan, I will state that it will\r\nrequire greater conveniences for the extinguishment of fires than those\r\nnow provided by our present arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe necessary facilities for conveniently putting out fires, can be\r\narranged in a short time and at comparatively small expense, by placing\r\na boiler-iron tank of some thirty feet in height, on the top of the\r\npresent reservoir on Murray Hill. This tank to be filled and kept full\r\nof water by a small steam engine provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd as an additional security I would propose that the present City Hall\r\nbe raised an additional story, and covered with an iron tank that would\r\nhold some ten feet of water. The outside of this tank to be made to\r\nrepresent a cornice around the building.\r\n\r\nIf an additional building should be put up, to take the place of the one\r\nlately destroyed by fire, it should be so formed as to be in harmony\r\nwith the present City Hall, and covered with a similar tank, and\r\ncorniced to correspond. With this greater head and supply of water\r\nalways at command, and ready for connection with the present street\r\nmains, the moment the signal is given from any Police Station, it will\r\nbe apparent that all the hydrants will be made efficient to raise water\r\nover the tops of the highest houses in the city.\r\n\r\nI would, in addition propose, that there should be placed at convenient\r\ndistances in every street, a small cart containing some three hundred\r\nfeet of hose. These carts should be so light that one man could draw\r\nthem to the nearest hydrant to the fire, and bring the water on the fire\r\nin the shortest possible time. With this arrangement, I propose to make\r\nit the interest of every man in the police, to watch against\r\nincendiaries and thieves, and to use every possible effort to extinguish\r\nfires as soon as they occur. To make it the interest for the police to\r\nperform their duty faithfully, I propose that the Corporation should set\r\napart as a fund, two shillings per day, in addition to the wages of each\r\nman, to be held by the Corporation to the end of each year, and when it\r\nshall be ascertained that the loss and damage by fire, and the loss of\r\nproperty stolen, shall have been reduced below the average of the last\r\nten years, then this fund of two shillings per day, in addition to their\r\nformer wages, shall be equally divided between the men forming the\r\nPolice Department.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this I propose that the Corporation should request all\r\nthe Insurance Companies interested in the property of this city to bid\r\nor offer the largest per centage that they are willing to give on all,\r\nthat the loss and damage by fire can be reduced below the average agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThis fund to be added to the Corporation fund of two shillings per day,\r\nand to be equally divided with the men forming the City Police.\r\n\r\nThis would enable every one of the members of the police to secure for\r\nhimself sufficient to pay his rent every year over and above his present\r\nwages. They would also have the elevating satisfaction of knowing that\r\nwhile they are saving one dollar for themselves they are saving fifty\r\ndollars for the community, and in addition saving thousands of\r\nindividuals from that wretchedness and misery annually produced by the\r\ndesolating ravages of fire.\r\n\r\nA police appointed for and during good behavior, with the liberal salary\r\nthey now receive, and with the additional privilege of securing to\r\nthemselves annually so large an amount over and above their regular\r\nsalaries might always be relied on to forward every measure that would\r\ntend to secure order and good government. A department so formed, whose\r\nduty it would be to traverse every street of the city by day and night,\r\nwould find it their interest as well as duty to watch against\r\nincendiaries, and when a fire was discovered they would instantly signal\r\nfor as many hose carts as desirable, with directions for every next man\r\nto double his walk. When such men come to a fire they would all be armed\r\nwith police powers to protect property, and to bring and use the carts\r\nwith hose on the fire, until the general alarm became necessary to\r\nsummon the firemen to the charge, which would seldom happen with such\r\nfacilities and such an interest to extinguish fires. One of the best\r\nfeatures in this arrangement will be the constant tendency and interest\r\nthere will be to draw into the department good men and crowd out bad\r\nmen. They find it their interest to have every man turned out who is\r\neither drunken, idle or dishonest, and to have in their place those that\r\nare sober, honest and efficient. They find it their interest to close\r\nevery rum shop that is selling without license, and they will not be\r\nlong in finding out that a large part of the fires arise from\r\ndrunkenness and the degradation and carelessness that are the natural\r\nresults of dissipation.\r\n\r\n                      [_Conclusion in our next._]\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n☞ Owing to an unusual amount of matter in this number, we have omitted\r\nour advertisements.
