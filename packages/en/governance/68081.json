THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n               PRINCIPLES, NOT PERSONALITIES, AT STAKE.\r\n\r\nMy friends and fellow citizens, men and women of Massachusetts, men and\r\nwomen of Boston, I am glad indeed to be in your old historic State,\r\nyour old historic city, this evening to plead for a cause which is\r\npreeminently the cause for which Massachusetts has stood throughout\r\nher existence as a colony and as a Commonwealth. [Cheers.] And\r\nfriends――friends, I shall make my appeal to you in the name of every\r\nman and every principle for whom and for which Massachusetts has stood\r\nin the heroic days of the past. [Applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\nNow, friends, last night I felt obliged to answer at length the attacks\r\nmade upon me by Mr. Taft, but I do not wish this contest to be put\r\nupon the basis of a contest of personalities [Good! good! and cheers]\r\nbetween myself and Mr. Taft, and to-night I shall only allude to Mr.\r\nTaft just as far as it is necessary for me in order to illustrate the\r\nprinciples for which he and I respectively stand. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FIGHTING FOR EVERY GOOD CITIZEN.\r\n\r\nAnd those allusions I shall make right at the outset, so that I can\r\nget down to the part of my speech in which I shall strive, however\r\nfeebly, to put before you the principles which I think are at stake in\r\nthis contest. For mind you, friends, I hold that this is infinitely\r\nmore than a mere faction fight in the Republican Party. [A voice:\r\n“That’s where you’re right.”] I hold that this is infinitely more than\r\nany ordinary party contest, for I claim that we who stand for the\r\nprinciples of progressive Republicanism [applause and cheers]――that\r\nwe who stand for making the principles of Abraham Lincoln living\r\nprinciples applied to the living issues of to-day――I hold that we are\r\nfighting not only for every good Republican, but for every good citizen\r\nin the United States, whoever he may be. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAnd now at the outset, to dispose of the only matters that I have to\r\ntake up in connection with Mr. Taft, I am more fortunate than Mr. Taft\r\nin my friends. [A voice: “You bet your life.” Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   WILLING TO LOSE WITH A GOOD MAN.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Taft came here on Thursday and I came here on Friday, Mr. Taft\r\ncame here having lost the State of Illinois; I came here having lost\r\nthe State of New Hampshire. [Laughter.] In Illinois Mr. Taft’s chief\r\nlieutenant had been Mr. Lorimer. [Hisses.] In New Hampshire my chief\r\nsupporter, chief lieutenant, had been Gov. Bass. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Taft came here to explain that he didn’t like Mr. Lorimer\r\n[laughter and applause], having kept his dislike strictly private\r\nand confidential [laughter] until Mr. Lorimer lost out in Illinois.\r\n[Laughter.]\r\n\r\nAnd I came here to say that, win or lose, I am with Gov. Bass every\r\ntime, and that I count it the highest privilege to have had him as my\r\nchampion, and I would rather lose with him than win with the forces\r\nallied against me. [Great applause and cries of “Bully.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FOUGHT LORIMER IN ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nNow, just one more moment about Mr. Lorimer.\r\n\r\nI know his record well. Mr. Taft was originally, a year and a quarter\r\nago, against Mr. Lorimer, and at that time he requested me not to\r\nassault Mr. Lorimer in public for fear it would help Mr. Lorimer.\r\n[Laughter.]\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly I kept quiet for several months, until I became\r\nconvinced that the assault against Mr. Lorimer was going on with such\r\nexcessive secrecy [laughter] that neither Mr. Lorimer nor any of his\r\nfriends knew that there was an assault at all. [Laughter.] And then\r\nI took up the cudgels that I had dropped and I attacked Mr. Lorimer\r\nagain. [Applause.] And I didn’t attack him in Massachusetts after\r\nthe Illinois primary; I attacked him in Illinois before the Illinois\r\nprimary. [Applause.] I was informed before I went there that I ought\r\nnot to attack Mr. Lorimer because he had many friends, some of whom\r\n“intended to vote for me,” and that I would alienate their support. And\r\nI answered to them that I would rather lose every delegate in Illinois\r\nthan by silence connive at the wickedness of which Mr. Lorimer had been\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nAnd I fought it out fair and square on that issue from one end of\r\nIllinois to the other. [A voice: “You did.”] And I won. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd I got every delegate in Illinois excepting two, the two from the\r\ndistrict which Mr. Lorimer carries in his waistcoat pocket, and those\r\ntwo are for Mr. Taft. And, friends, it would not have been possible\r\nfor me to have supported Mr. Lorimer at all――to have acquiesced in his\r\nsupport of me; but if it had been, and I had been going to repudiate\r\nhim, I would have repudiated him before the Illinois primary and not\r\nafterwards. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE MAN FOR THE BOSSES.\r\n\r\nI have got a couple of columns arranged parallel here, one containing\r\na dozen of my representative supporters and the other containing the\r\ndozen foremost supporters of Mr. Taft.\r\n\r\nThere has been a question raised by Mr. Taft as to whom the bosses were\r\nfor. I will read you these two lists, and I will ask you to judge for\r\nyourselves. [A voice: “Exactly.” Laughter.] I will read you――[pounding\r\nat entrance]――there seem to be some gentlemen who would like to come\r\nin. I will read you the dozen of my supporters first: Gov. Hadley, Gov.\r\nBass, Gov. Stubbs, Gov. Johnson, Senator Beveridge, Senator Clark,\r\nSenator Bristow, Frank Heney, Gifford Pinchot, Mr. Garfield, Judge Ben\r\nLindsey, Jacob Riis.\r\n\r\n[A voice: “How about Perkins?”]\r\n\r\nPerkins? He is for me. You can’t――I will tell you. Wait a minute. You\r\ncan’t put a question to me that it will embarrass me to answer for one\r\nmoment. [Great applause. A voice: “Go to him! Go to him!”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RECORD IS OPEN TO ALL.\r\n\r\nWait a moment. I know that kind well. And you can guarantee that any\r\nsupporter of mine comes out in the open and supports me. [Applause.]\r\nAnd you can guarantee also that after he has supported me, and I\r\nhave accepted his support, I won’t repudiate him afterwards. [Great\r\napplause. A voice: “That is a square deal.”]\r\n\r\nAnd finally, you can guarantee this, that you can search from the top\r\nto the bottom of my record in the past and of my record in the future\r\nand you will never find that I have done or am doing or ever shall\r\ndo for Mr. Perkins or for any other human being [applause]――wait a\r\nminute――or for any other human being one thing that I wouldn’t tell\r\nto this audience in its entire details. [A voice: “We believe it.”\r\nApplause.]\r\n\r\n[Voices: “Put him out.”] Not a bit. I am glad to have him stay in.\r\nDon’t put him out. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HISSES ON THE BOSSES.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have given you the names of my supporters. Here are the names\r\nof a dozen representative supporters of Mr. Taft: Senator Lorimer\r\n[hisses], Senator Penrose [hisses], Senator Gallinger [hisses], Senator\r\nGuggenheim [hisses], Senator Aldrich [hisses], Senator Stephenson\r\n[hisses], Mr. Kealing of Indiana [hisses], Mr. Barnes of New York\r\n[hisses], Mr. Cox of Ohio [hisses], Mr. Cannon [hisses], Mr. Ballinger\r\n[hisses], and finally, to balance Frank Heney in California, Mr.\r\nPatrick Calhoun [hisses], whom Frank Heney tried to put into the\r\npenitentiary.\r\n\r\nNow, friends, Mr. Taft has said that I have accepted the support of\r\nbosses. So I have, when they went my way; but I never went their\r\nway. [Applause.] Either they had to go my way or we parted company.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nUnderstand me, friends, and make no thought of Mr. Taft. I think he\r\nmeans well, but he means feebly, and he is surrounded by men who are\r\nneither well meaning nor feeble. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends, that is all I have got to say of the personalities in\r\nthis contest. I have not been interested in them in any shape or way. I\r\nhave no personal feeling whatever in the matter. I will support any man\r\nas long as that man renders service to the people of the United States.\r\n[Great applause and cheers.] And when he ceases rendering service I\r\nshall cease to support him. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        APPEAL TO THE PATRIOTS.\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends, to you men and women of Massachusetts, I wish to make\r\nas strong an appeal as I know how. I come from another State. I have\r\nno New England blood in me, but nine-tenths of the men in our nation’s\r\npast to whom I have looked up most have been men of New England blood.\r\n[Cries of “Hear! Hear!” and applause.] And I ask Massachusetts now\r\nto stand as Massachusetts has ever stood, to stand in the van of the\r\nforward movement and not to be dragged reluctantly onward behind the\r\nother States that go forward. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts stood by Abraham Lincoln. [Applause.] Massachusetts gave\r\nher mighty support to the rail splitter from Illinois when he announced\r\nas his cardinal doctrines the right of the people to rule, and their\r\ngood sense which would so guide them as to bring nearer the day when\r\nsocial and industrial justice should prevail in this Republic of ours.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE REAL KIND OF FIGHT.\r\n\r\nAnd I ask Massachusetts to support us in this campaign, not because it\r\nis easy, but because it is hard. [Applause.] I appeal to you because\r\nthis is the only kind of a fight worth going into, the kind of fight\r\nwhere the victory is worth winning and where the struggle is difficult.\r\n\r\nHere in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, we have against us the enormous\r\npreponderance of the forces that win victory in ordinary political\r\ncontests. [A voice: “They won’t do it this time.”]\r\n\r\nWe have against us 95 per cent of the old regular political leaders.\r\nWe have against us 95 per cent of the great corporations, which either\r\nlegitimately fear that we would not tolerate their benefiting by\r\nprivilege or else which are merely panic-struck and fail to realize\r\nthat we will do absolute justice――just as much justice to the big man\r\nas the little man, but no more. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SILK STOCKINGS AGAINST HIM.\r\n\r\nFriends, we have against us also, I am sorry to say, 95 per cent of the\r\nrespectable, amiable, silk-stocking vote. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nAnd it is amusing to see how exactly the conditions now parallel the\r\nconditions 55 years ago, when Abraham Lincoln was making his fight for\r\nthe Union and for freedom.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat by Douglas in 1858, in November of that year, he wrote\r\na letter to a friend, dating the letter at Springfield, Ill. It’s a\r\nletter I should like to have framed at this moment in every house in\r\nthe Back Bay. [Laughter.] He said:\r\n\r\n    In the late contest we had with us a considerable proportion\r\n    of the plain Democracy, but we lost almost all the old silk\r\n    stocking, exclusive Whigery. I do not mean that we lost all the\r\n    Whigs, but only those of the nice, exclusive, silk-stocking\r\n    type. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nNow that was written by Abraham Lincoln 54 years ago, and it has just\r\nhappened in your own city, and in mine, and in the country generally at\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, friends, we have against us the money; we have\r\nagainst us the politicians; we have against us every newspaper that\r\ncan be reached or controlled [hisses] by the money power [cries of\r\n“right,” and applause]; we have against us the timid silk-stocking\r\nelement――understand, not the silk-stocking man who feels competent to\r\nhold his own in the turmoil of actual life, not the silk-stocking man\r\nwho is content to go out into the world and take his chances as any\r\nother man takes his.\r\n\r\nWe have got that man with us. We have got that man with us. [Applause.]\r\nWe have against us only the silk-stocking man who is not quite\r\nconfident enough in himself to believe in himself, who is not quite\r\nconfident enough in himself to believe that he can hold his own\r\nwith the rest of his fellow-Americans without advantage on his part.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nWe have these men that I have spoken of against us, and we have not\r\ngot anybody with us except the people. [Great applause.] And on next\r\nTuesday I want the people――I want you――to go to the polls and vote the\r\nsame way you shout. [Cries of “you bet, you,” and applause.]\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, as in Illinois, and as in most other States this\r\nyear, it is such a contest in the civic field as you saw in the\r\nmilitary field in 1775 and 1776.\r\n\r\nIt is a contest between the Minute Men and the mercenaries. [Applause].\r\nAnd I want to show that in civic life you are competent to do the\r\nwork that your forefathers have done; done with honor in the past.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LOWELL’S PROPHECY.\r\n\r\nNow, friends, there has been an element of comedy to me in being held\r\nup in Massachusetts as an anarchistic agitator, when all that I have\r\nbeen doing has been to try to reduce to practice in the present day\r\nwhat the greatest men of Massachusetts have preached in past time.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nI have got here, and I am going to read to you, just a few lines from\r\nLowell and then two lines from Emerson――Lowell’s being written nearly\r\n60 years ago and Emerson’s 50 years ago. Lowell’s run:\r\n\r\n    New times demand new measures and new men;\r\n    The old advances and in time outgrows\r\n    The laws that in our fathers’ day were best.\r\n    And doubtless after us some purer scheme will be\r\n    Shaped out by wiser men than we,\r\n    Made wiser by the steady growth of truth.\r\n    My soul is not a palace of the past,\r\n    Where outworn creeds like Rome’s great Senate quake,\r\n    Hearing afar the vandals’ trumpet hoarse\r\n    That shakes old systems with a thunder fit.\r\n    The time is ripe and rotten ripe for change.   [Applause.]\r\n    Then let it come; I have no dread\r\n    Of what is called for by the instinct of mankind.\r\n\r\n[Cries of “Good!”]\r\n\r\nFriends, that is what Lowell wrote in 1856. It is what we could put on\r\nour banners now in 1912.\r\n\r\nAnd I appeal to the Massachusetts of Lowell’s time, to the Massachusetts\r\nthat believed in the Bigelow papers, to the Massachusetts that sent\r\nyoung Lowell and Shaw, that sent Hallowell and so many of your people to\r\nthe front in the Civil War.\r\n\r\nI appeal to that Massachusetts to stand loyal now to the memories of\r\nMassachusetts’ great past.\r\n\r\nAnd now just wait――only two more lines of poetry. One of the curious\r\ntraits of many of our good friends who are at the moment our opponents\r\nis that they are entirely willing to pay heed to the loftiest\r\ndemocratic sentiments if you will only keep them as sentiments and not\r\ntry to reduce them to prose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EMERSON AND THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nI think I could get every worthy citizen of the Back Bay who at\r\npresent feels the deepest distrust of us to applaud with tepid decorum\r\n[laughter] the following two lines of Emerson, provided only that I\r\nmerely read them, in the course of a lecture on Emerson, and did not\r\nask to translate them into action. [Laughter and applause.] The lines\r\nare:\r\n\r\n    For fishers and choppers and plowmen\r\n    Shall constitute a State.\r\n\r\nHe is describing the birth of Massachusetts, the birth of the United\r\nStates, and he describes this country as being foreordained through\r\nthe ages to show the kings, the aristocracy, the powers of privilege\r\nin the Old World, that here in the New World we could have a true and\r\nreal democracy, a democracy where fishers and choppers and plowmen\r\nconstitute a State. [Applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\nAs I say, friends, I could get decorous applause in any part of the\r\nBack Bay for that sentiment so long as I treated it purely as poetry of\r\nthe past and not as politics of the present. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          “THE MOB” WHO RULE.\r\n\r\nBut when I ask that the choppers, the plowmen, the fishers be given\r\nthe absolute, the real control over their Government: when I ask that\r\nthe farmers, the factory workers, the retail merchants, the young\r\nprofessional men, the railroad men, all the average citizens, be given\r\nthe real control of this Government of theirs, be given the right to\r\nnominate their own candidates, be given the right to supervise the\r\nacts of all their servants――the minute I do that, I am told that I am\r\nappealing to the momentary passion of the mob [laughter and applause],\r\nthat fishers and choppers and plowmen are all right in poetry but\r\nwhen I try to put them into politics they become a mob cursed with\r\nan inability to act except under the impulse of momentary passion.\r\n[Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nNow, friends, in my life, according to the strength that has been\r\ngiven me, I have always striven measurably to realize every ideal I\r\nhave ever possessed, and I hold with deepest conviction that there is\r\nnothing worse in any man than to profess a high ideal as a mere matter\r\nof intellectual pleasure and in practice to make no effort to realize\r\nthat ideal. [Applause.] I hold that it is discreditable to us as a\r\npeople, discreditable to you of Massachusetts, if you praise Emerson’s\r\nand Lowell’s lines in the abstract and fail to do your best to endeavor\r\nactually to realize them in the present. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PEOPLE NO JUDGES.\r\n\r\nAll I am trying to do is to practically put into effect now in America,\r\nin 1912, the principles which your great leaders in Massachusetts, your\r\ngreat statesmen of the past, your great writers, your poets of the\r\npast, preached 30 and 50 and 70 years ago. [Applause.] That is all that\r\nI am trying to do.\r\n\r\nAnd, friends, I now wish to put before you just what I mean by one of\r\nmy proposals which has attracted the most criticism, and the people\r\nwill catch up with it in the end.\r\n\r\nIn different parts of this Union, in different States, we have had very\r\ndifferent qualities of public service. Nowhere have the differences\r\nbeen greater than in the judiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MASSACHUSETTS JUDGES GOOD.\r\n\r\nHere in Massachusetts you have had, I believe, a very unusually high\r\nquality of service from your judges. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nWhen I was President, one of the revolutionary things that I did, of\r\nwhich you have heard so much, was, without any precedent――to put on the\r\nSupreme Court of the Nation two judges from Massachusetts. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt was revolution; it had never been done before, but I should not\r\nthink that Massachusetts would attack me because of it. [Laughter and\r\napplause.] I put on those two men――one of them Mr. Moody, my Attorney\r\nGeneral [applause], because I had become convinced from my association\r\nwith him that he not only knew law but knew life [applause], and that\r\nhe had a realization of the needs and of the ideals of the great\r\nmajority of his fellow citizens, the men and women who go to make up\r\nthe average of the citizenship of the United States.\r\n\r\nI put on Mr. Holmes, then chief justice here [applause], because\r\nstudying his decisions I had grown to feel that he, too, sympathized\r\nwith the American people, and, what was even more important, realized\r\nthat the American people must decide for themselves, and not have\r\nanyone else decide for them, what their ideas of fundamental justice,\r\nas expressed in law, ought to be. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE BAY STATE EXAMPLE.\r\n\r\nAnd when I made my Columbus speech the State that I held up as an\r\nexample to other States in the matter of the treatment of its judiciary\r\nwas Massachusetts. [Applause.] Now, from reading the Massachusetts\r\npapers you would have thought that I was holding up the Massachusetts\r\ncourts to obloquy.\r\n\r\nI was holding them up for imitation elsewhere and I was advocating that\r\nin other States you should exercise the same type of supervision over\r\nyour courts as Massachusetts has exercised.\r\n\r\nBut that was not all. I am dealing not with Massachusetts only; I am\r\ndealing with the 40 or 50 Commonwealths that go to make up this country\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE TRAITOR JUDGES.\r\n\r\nIn some of these Commonwealths there have been put on the bench judges\r\nwho have betrayed the interests of the people. [“Right!”]\r\n\r\nIf you doubt my words, you study the history of the cases in California\r\nin which Frank Heney was engaged, you study the history of the cases in\r\nMissouri in which Folk and Hadley were engaged. In those two States,\r\ngentlemen, I would have gone to any necessary length to take off the\r\nbench the judges who had betrayed the interests of justice and of the\r\nplain people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIn certain other States, my own State of New York, the great State of\r\nIllinois, we were fronted with an entirely different situation. In\r\nthose States, as far as I know, there was no trouble with the judges\r\nbeing corrupt.\r\n\r\nIn New York I know that the court of appeals is composed of upright,\r\nwell-meaning men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DO NOT KNOW VITAL NEEDS.\r\n\r\nBut the courts in those States have been composed of men who know\r\nnothing whatever of the vital needs of the great bulk of their\r\nfellow Americans, and who, unlike your courts in Massachusetts, have\r\nendeavored to impose their own outworn philosophy of life upon the\r\nmillions of their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to give you certain examples, concrete cases of just what\r\nI mean, because I have always found that a concrete case explains my\r\nposition better than a general statement.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as I left Harvard I went into the New York Legislature.\r\nAnd my education began. [Laughter.] Now, I did not come to my present\r\nposition as a result of study in the library, in the closet.\r\n\r\nI came to my present position as the result of living in a world of\r\nmen. It is because I have associated with them, I have worked with\r\nthem, and I know my fellow Americans in many a different part of this\r\nUnion and in all grades of life. [Applause.] I have worked with them.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO THE MEN OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I am just going to give these one or two examples just to\r\nshow you what I mean; that is all. For instance, I lived out West, in\r\nthe cow country, quite a time, the short-grass country [laughter], and\r\nwe would ship trainloads of cattle East. I and three or four other men\r\nwho were going would go in the caboose at the end of the cattle train.\r\n\r\nIf the train stopped we would jump out with our poles, and we would run\r\nup along the length of the cars to poke up the cattle that had lain\r\ndown, because if we let them lie down the others would trample them to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAnd usually about the time we got near the engine the train would start\r\nagain. Then we would have to climb up on the first car and dance along\r\nback from car to car until we got to the last car and climb down to the\r\ncaboose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          KNOWS THE BRAKEMAN.\r\n\r\nNow, once or twice I had to perform that voyage in a late fall or early\r\nwinter night with snow on the roofs of the cars and the wind blowing,\r\nand I was thoroughly contented when it was through.\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends, when a workman’s-compensation act comes up and the\r\nquestion arises whether a brakeman, a switchman, any man of the kind\r\nshould be compensated for the loss of life or limb in taking charge\r\nof the trains in which you and I travel in comfort in the Pullman\r\ncars――when that comes up I think of my feelings when I jumped from car\r\nto car on the top of that cattle train, and when a miss or slip meant\r\nthe loss of a leg or an arm or the loss of my life, and I know how the\r\nbrakeman feels in such a case. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE JUDGES DON’T KNOW.\r\n\r\nNow in New York those worthy, well-meaning, elderly judges of the court\r\nof appeals have never had such an experience in their lives.\r\n\r\nThey don’t know. They don’t visualize to themselves how that brakeman\r\nfeels. They are not able to present to their minds the risks incident\r\nto the ordinary, everyday performance of his duties.\r\n\r\nThey don’t know the brakeman. They don’t know what it is――I am speaking\r\nof a case I know――they don’t know what it means when a brakeman loses\r\nboth legs, and the following winter――I am speaking of a case I know,\r\nmy own personal experience――the following winter his wife can’t go out\r\nbecause she can’t purchase shoes if she purchases shoes to send the\r\nchildren to school in. If they did visualize those facts to themselves,\r\nI know that they would entirely alter the course of their judicial\r\ndecisions. They don’t understand what the facts of the case are.\r\n\r\nNow, this is simply as a preliminary, because I want you to know,\r\nto realize, that I have come to my present convictions as a result\r\nof having lived in the actual world of workaday men. I am not a\r\nsentimentalist. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BELIEVES IN JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nI am not a sentimentalist. If there is one quality I dislike as much as\r\nhardness of heart it is softness of head.\r\n\r\nBut I do believe in justice just as you believe in justice, and I am\r\ntrying to get justice, and I am trying to get it for those who are less\r\nfortunate just as for those who are more fortunate. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nJust wait. I want to give you just four or five cases of laws which the\r\ncourts of Illinois and New York have declared unconstitutional. When\r\nI went into the legislature 30 years ago in New York, I was put on a\r\ncommittee to investigate the manufacture of cigars in tenement houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LIFE IN DESPAIR.\r\n\r\nI remember well of one of them coming upon a room about 14 feet――16\r\nfeet, perhaps――square, in which two families lived, one of them with\r\na boarder. Those two families, men, women, and children, worked and\r\nlived, day in and day out, night in and night out, there, at the\r\nmanufacture of tobacco into cigars.\r\n\r\nThey lived in squalid filth, with the great sheets of tobacco in the\r\nbed clothing, under the beds, mixed up with stale food, put in the\r\ncorners of the dirty room.\r\n\r\nWe got a bill through to put a stop to that kind of work, and the court\r\nof appeals declared it unconstitutional. Friends, there was this gem in\r\nthe opinion.\r\n\r\nThe court said that it could not permit the legislature to interfere\r\nwith the sanctity of home. [Laughter. A voice: “No home at all.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TAKES WORLD OF TIME.\r\n\r\nIt was not home at all, as you say, that squalid 16-foot room where\r\nthose families lived day in and day out and worked day in and day out;\r\nand yet the court forbade us to try and improve those conditions, to\r\ntry and make the conditions of tenement-house life so that it would be\r\npossible for decent men and decent women to live decently there and\r\nbring up their children as American citizens should be brought up.\r\n\r\nFriends, it is idle for any man to ask me to sit unmoved and without\r\nprotest when a court makes a decision like that [cries of “Good” and\r\napplause], and it is a waste of time to tell me, as Mr. Taft did in his\r\nspeech, that I am laying an impious hand on the ark of the covenant\r\nwhen I try to secure the reversal of such a decision. [Laughter and\r\napplause.]\r\n\r\nNow wait. I have only just begun. [Applause.] I am sorry for you, but I\r\nwill get through as quick as I can. [Voices: “Go on, go on.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED.\r\n\r\nThen we passed a law providing that in factories there should be\r\nsafeguards over all the dangerous machinery, and a girl working in\r\na factory had her arm taken off above the elbow by an unprotected\r\nflywheel. She sued and recovered damages, and the court of appeals of\r\nthe State of New York threw out her case, and there was another gem in\r\ntheir opinion. They said that they would not permit the legislature\r\nto interfere with the liberty of that girl to work amidst dangerous\r\nmachinery. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nNow you can see yourselves――you can look up. I will refer anyone who\r\nwants to look it up to the exact decisions where this language occurred.\r\n\r\nThe liberty of that girl was protected by the court――the liberty; she\r\nhad the liberty to starve or to work under the conditions offered her,\r\nand she had no other liberty. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DREADFUL DENIAL OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nAnd I hold that it was a dreadful denial of justice to prevent that\r\npoor girl from recovering for the accident due to the criminal\r\ncarelessness of her employer, and I, for one, will never rest when\r\nthere is a decision like that on the books until we have got it\r\nrepealed. [“Good! Good!” and cheers.]\r\n\r\nI could give you 20 such cases. I will only give you 2 more――only 2\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThen in the next case that came up that I refer to we passed a law,\r\nmodeled on your Massachusetts law, a law forbidding women to be worked\r\nin factories more than 10 hours a day or after 9 o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nFriends, personally, I thought that was an utterly insufficient law.\r\nI felt that it did not go nearly far enough. Your Massachusetts law\r\nprohibits them from working more than 9 hours a day and after 6 o’clock\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nOurs did not go as far. It was with reluctance that I could make myself\r\naccept it at all. I did simply because it was the best we could get at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nAt that time girls and women in factories, in sweatshops, were being\r\nworked 12, 14, sometimes 16 hours a day and until 10, 11, and 12 at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COURT’S BARRIER.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts court held that your law was constitutional; but our\r\nlaw, which did not go as far, the Court of Appeals of the State of\r\nNew York held as unconstitutional, and there was this further gem in\r\nthe language――the court said that there had been altogether too much\r\nlegislation of this kind in the United States and the time had come for\r\nthe court fearlessly to oppose the barrier of its judgment against it.\r\n\r\nI love that word “fearlessly.” [Prolonged cheering.] Those amiable,\r\nwell-meaning, excellently intentioned judges, who, doubtless, did not\r\nin their whole circle of acquaintances know one woman who was working\r\nin a factory or a sweatshop, said that they would stand “fearlessly”\r\nfor what?\r\n\r\n“Fearlessly” for the right of the big factory owner and the small\r\nsweatshop owner to earn their money by working women, haggard, hour\r\nafter hour, day after day, night after night, in the factory and\r\nsweatshop.\r\n\r\nNow, friends, do you know what my proposal is――this revolutionary\r\nproposal of mine [laughter], this proposal of mine that they say\r\nrepresents socialism and anarchy?\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FOR THE 10,000,000.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is this: That in a case like that, the 10,000,000 people\r\nof the State of New York, to whom those 6 or 7 elderly, worthy,\r\nwell-meaning men had said that they could not have justice――that those\r\n10,000,000 people, after a time amply sufficient in which to come to\r\na sober judgment, should be permitted to vote for themselves as to\r\nwhether the Constitution, which they themselves had made, had been\r\ncorrectly interpreted by your court here in Massachusetts and the Court\r\nof Appeals in the State of New York. [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\nAnd if in a case like that the people are not intelligent enough\r\nto vote and say what they themselves meant when they made the\r\nConstitution, they are not intelligent enough to have made the\r\nConstitution in the first place. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COMPENSATION ACT.\r\n\r\nOne more case, only one more――two, perhaps. [Laughter.] We passed in\r\nNew York a workmen’s compensation act.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, interpreting exactly the same\r\nlanguage in the Constitution of the United States as the court of\r\nappeals interpreted in the constitution of the State of New York, and\r\nin reference to a practically exactly similar bill, decided that that\r\nlaw was constitutional.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals of the State of New York decided that the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States was wrong [laughter] and that the law was\r\nnot constitutional.\r\n\r\nNow, I want you to listen to this sentence, because I haven’t seen this\r\nfact brought out by any man yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “UNCONSTITUTIONALITY.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment in the State of New York if a New York brakeman is\r\ninjured on a train going straight through across New York, from Boston\r\nto Chicago, he has a right to recover, it is constitutional for him\r\nto recover [laughter] for the injury.\r\n\r\nBut if his brother is working on a trolley in the same city in\r\nwhich he is injured on the railroad train, or if he is working on a\r\nrailway train that only goes from Albany to Buffalo, then it becomes\r\nunconstitutional for him to recover. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANARCHY OR JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nFriends, it is idle to tell me that I have not the right to protest\r\nthat the United States Supreme Court was right and the court of\r\nappeals wrong [applause]; and if I am an anarchist, I am an anarchist\r\nin company with the Supreme Court of the United States. [Applause and\r\ncheers.]\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that, in that kind of a case, the ten millions of people\r\nof New York State shall not be balked of justice, but, after ample\r\ntime for due deliberation on their part, shall be permitted to vote in\r\nthis case whether the Supreme Court of the United States and the State\r\ncourts of a dozen other States, like Iowa and Washington, are right, or\r\nwhether the amiable elderly gentlemen of the New York Court of Appeals\r\nare right.\r\n\r\nI ask whether it be true that justice can not be given to the man\r\ncrippled in industry in New York, although it can be given to him in\r\nthe Nation, and in Iowa and in Washington, and in every civilized\r\ncountry abroad; whether it be true that the man can not have justice\r\ndone him in New York, or whether we shall say to the judges of the\r\nCourt of Appeals of New York, “No; we stand by the doctrines laid down\r\nby the Supreme Court of the Nation,” and given utterance to by the\r\nMassachusetts judge, Mr. Justice Holmes, in the Oklahoma bank case.\r\n“We say that the people have the right, in the exercise of the police\r\npower of the general-welfare clause of the Constitution”――I am using\r\nMr. Holmes’s words, not mine――“that the people have the right to decide\r\nsuch cases in accordance with the common standard of morality, with the\r\npreponderance opinion of the citizenship of the community, and that the\r\ncourts have to respect such opinion as the popular opinion as to what\r\nmorality demands.” [Applause.]\r\n\r\nI hold that if it be true――if it be true――that in this country fishers\r\nand plowmen and choppers are to constitute a State, it must be true\r\nthat they shall be permitted to impose their ideas of common justice,\r\nof common decency, upon their public servants, and that the public\r\nservants are in very fact the servants and not the masters of the\r\ncommunity. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE BATTLE FOR JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nNow, friends, I ask you of Massachusetts to stand in the front of the\r\nbattle for justice and for righteousness as I have outlined. I wish\r\nthat I could make the men who are best off in the community――the big\r\ncorporation men, the big bankers, merchants, railroad men――understand\r\nthat in this fight for justice we ought to have the right to expect\r\nthem to lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOR THE RIGHT.\r\n\r\nSurely, friends, surely men of Massachusetts, if we are true to the\r\nMassachusetts ideals of the past, we will expect those to whom much\r\nhas been given to take the lead in striving to get justice for their\r\nfellows to whom less has been given. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nI want the men who are well off to give justice now because it is\r\nright, and not to wait till they have given justice simply because they\r\nfear longer to deny it. Justice! Let it come, because we believe in it.\r\nLet it not be forced upon us because we are afraid to deny it.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of wisdom is being wise in time, and the proper way to\r\nconserve all of the present system of our civilization that is best\r\nworth conserving is to alter that which causes a heavy strain to come\r\nupon the rest.\r\n\r\nI ask, at least, that we decline to commit ourselves to a policy of\r\nfoolish Bourbonism; that instead of denying the need of any change in\r\nour laws, in our social and industrial system, to meet the changing\r\nneeds of the times, we take the lead in making every change that is\r\nnecessary in order to make our constitutions and the body of our law\r\nenacted under the Constitution instruments for justice as between man\r\nand man, instruments for getting justice for the average citizenship of\r\nthe American Republic. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nFriends, now you have heard me to-night and you can judge for\r\nyourselves. Am I preaching anarchy? Am I preaching socialism? [Cries of\r\n“No.”]\r\n\r\nI am preaching elementary justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MISSOURI AND MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nAnd now I ask you of Massachusetts to respond to the appeal contained\r\nin this telegram to me from Missouri, which says that the State\r\nconvention of Missouri, representing the State, has refused all\r\ncompromise and has sent a delegation to Chicago standing straight for\r\nme [great cheering] and for the cause that I represent.\r\n\r\nAnd I ask you people of Massachusetts, you men of Massachusetts, on\r\nnext Tuesday to put yourselves beside Illinois and Pennsylvania and\r\nMaine in the lead of the movement. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n                                   O\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n ――Text in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\n ――Punctuation and spelling inaccuracies were silently corrected.\r\n\r\n ――Archaic and variable spelling has been preserved.\r\n\r\n ――Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved.",
