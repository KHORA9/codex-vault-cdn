It\r\ncan hardly be said that any serious attempt has been made either in\r\nEngland or Italy to deal with either. Hence the present volume,\r\nhowever unequal to the subject, may have its use. The thirty years,\r\nwhich have passed since Mazzini's death, make it possible now to place\r\nhim in his true perspective; and the author trusts that the supreme\r\nadmiration, which he feels for Mazzini as a man, has not prevented him\r\nfrom viewing the politician with impartiality. There exists abundant\r\nmatter to allow us to judge Mazzini's political work, and it is\r\nunlikely that anything yet to be published will seriously affect our\r\nestimate of it. For the personal side of Mazzini's life, the moment is\r\nnot a very opportune one. Ten years ago it would have been possible to\r\nglean reminiscences from many, who are now silent. It has been the\r\nauthor's privilege, however, to obtain invaluable information from two\r\nof the very few persons now living, who knew Mazzini intimately. While\r\nit is nearly too late for personal reminiscences, it is too early to\r\navail oneself fully of Mazzini's correspondence. A good many of his\r\nletters have indeed been published, and I have been able to use a\r\ngood many unpublished ones, especially his correspondence with Mr and\r\nMrs Peter Taylor, which I have found of the greatest value. But\r\nunfortunately only one volume has as yet appeared of the collected\r\nedition of his correspondence, and there are still probably many of\r\nhis letters, which have yet to come to light in Italy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the study, which occupies the second part of this\r\nvolume, the author is very sensible of his limitations in dealing with\r\nso vast and complex a system as Mazzini's ethical and political\r\nthought. It is his hope that he may do something to stimulate more\r\ncompetent writers to labour in a very fruitful field. He believes that\r\nthe more Mazzini's thought is disentangled, the more its essential\r\nimportance will appear.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge gratefully the kindness of those who have helped\r\nme in writing this book. Above all I am indebted to Mr and Mrs W. T.\r\nMalleson, to whom I owe the loan of the Peter Taylor correspondence\r\nand other invaluable help; to Miss Shaen for letting me see Mazzini's\r\nletters to her father, Mr W. Shaen, and the MS. of the \"Prayer for the\r\nPlanters,\" now first published; to Mr Milner-Gibson Cullum, Miss\r\nDorothea Hickson, Mr Mazzini Stuart, Mr P. S. King, and Miss Galeer\r\nfor the loan of unpublished letters from Mazzini. I have also to\r\nacknowledge my grateful thanks to many others, who have assisted me,\r\namong whom I would especially mention Miss Ashurst Biggs, Signor\r\nMario Borsa, Mr James Bryce, M.P., Mr W. Burnley, Signora Giuditta\r\nCasali-Benvenuti (to whom I owe the portrait of her grandmother,\r\nGiuditta Sidoli), Mr T. Chambers, Signor Felice Dagnino, Signor G.\r\nGallavresi, Mrs Goodwin, Miss Edith Harvey, Mr H. M. Hyndman, Dr\r\nCourtney Kenny, Miss Lucy Martineau, Professor Masson, Mr C. E.\r\nMaurice, Mademoiselle Dora Melegari, Mr D. Nathan, Mr T. Okey, Mr\r\nChas. Roberts, Mr J. J. Stansfeld, the Società Editrice Sonzogno (for\r\npermission to reproduce some illustrations from Madame White Mario's\r\nlife of Mazzini), Mr W. R. Thayer, and Mr Remsen Whitehouse.\r\n\r\n    BOLTON KING.\r\n    _October 1902._\r\n\r\n\r\nA reissue of the book has allowed me to revise it in the light of\r\nrecent publications referring to Mazzini. A good many more of his\r\nletters have been printed since 1902 (including a second volume of the\r\n_Epistolario_), but with the exception of Mademoiselle Melegari's\r\ncollection of his letters to her father, they are not important. Nor,\r\nwith the exception of Signor Cantimori's illuminating _Saggio_, have I\r\nfound any useful recent studies of his thought. I still adhere to the\r\nview that subsequent research will add little to our knowledge of him.\r\nI am glad, however, to be able now to take a different view of his\r\nconnection with the publication of Kossuth's manifesto in 1853, and of\r\nMadame Sidoli's mission to Florence in 1833 (see pp. 68 and 169).\r\n\r\n     BOLTON KING.\r\n     WARWICK, _November 1911_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A complete Bibliography of Mazzini will be found on page 367._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n     THE HOME AT GENOA\r\n     1805-1831.

His father was a doctor of some repute and Professor of Anatomy\r\nat the University, a democrat in creed and life, who gave much of his\r\ntime to unpaid service of the poor; at home affectionate and loved,\r\nthough sometimes hard and imperious. His mother, to whom in after life\r\nhe bore a strong resemblance, was a capable and devoted woman, who had\r\nlittle of the weakness of an Italian mother, and brought up her\r\nchildren to bear the brunt of life; with strong interest in the mighty\r\nmovements that were remoulding Europe at the time, a mordant critic of\r\ngovernors and governments inside the four walls of her house. It was a\r\nhappy home, and \"Pippo\" grew up the darling of his parents and three\r\nsisters, a delicate, sensitive, gentle child, quick and insistent to\r\nlearn despite his father's fears for his health, and giving precocious\r\nproof of brilliant talents. He was nearly nine years old, when the\r\nNapoleonic system was shattered, and the Emperor went to Elba.\r\nDoubtless, Mazzini heard from his father that Napoleon was Italian\r\nborn and was going to exile in an Italian island. The shock of the\r\ndownfall was felt at Genoa, for the proud city, to which Lord William\r\nBentinck had promised in the name of England its ancient independence,\r\nlearnt that \"republics were no longer fashionable,\" and saw itself\r\nhelplessly made over to the alien rule of Piedmont. Bitterly the\r\nGenoese chafed at the traffic of their liberties, and we may be sure\r\nthat there was republican talk in Mazzini's home, which sank into the\r\nmind of the thoughtful child. He himself mentions four influences that\r\nturned his boyish mind to democracy: his parents' uniform courtesy to\r\nevery rank of life; the reminiscences of the French republican wars in\r\nthe talk at home; some numbers of an old Girondist paper, which his\r\nfather kept half hidden, for fear of the police, behind his medical\r\nbooks; and--more than all these, probably--the classics that he read\r\nunder his Latin tutor. \"The history of Greece and Rome,\" wrote a\r\nfellow-student, \"the only thing taught us with any care at school, was\r\nlittle else than a constant libel upon monarchy, and a panegyric upon\r\nthe democratic form of government.\" Like many another boy of his time\r\nwho had for school exercises to declaim the praises of Cato and the\r\nBruti, he came to regard republics as the appointed homes of virtue.\r\nIt was the unintended fruit of the classical training, which the\r\ndespotic governments of the time fostered to keep their youth innocent\r\nof any itch for innovation.\r\n\r\nSo he lived his quiet, studious home-life, till an incident one day,\r\nwhen he was nearly sixteen, suddenly changed its tenor. The Carbonaro\r\nrevolutions of 1820 and 1821 had ended in deserved collapse; and the\r\nPiedmontese Liberals, abandoned and defeated, crowded to Genoa and\r\nSampierdarena, while yet there was time to escape to Spain. Some had\r\nfled penniless, and Mazzini, walking with his mother, noted their\r\ndespairing faces, and watched while a collection was made for them in\r\nthe streets. Their memory haunted him, and with a boy's enthusiasm for\r\nhis heroes, he longed to follow them. He neglected his lessons, and\r\nsat moody and absorbed, interested only in gleaning news of the exiles\r\nand learning the history of their defeat. In his boyish impatience,\r\nwhich came near the truth, he felt \"they might have won, if all had\r\ndone their duty,\" and the thought puzzled and obsessed him. He\r\ninsisted on dressing in black, and kept the habit to the end of life.\r\nHe brooded over Foscolo's _Jacopo Ortis_, till the morbid pessimism of\r\nthe book wrought on him, and his mother, apparently with good reason,\r\nfeared suicide.\r\n\r\nIn time he recovered his balance, and went back to his books with the\r\nold zest. He was now studying medicine, intending to follow his\r\nfather's profession; but at his first attendance in the operation room\r\nhe fainted, and it was clear that he could never be a surgeon.[1] To\r\nhis father it must have been a sore disappointment, but he seems to\r\nhave at once recognised the inevitable, and allowed the lad to read\r\nlaw. Mazzini had little heart in his new studies, for the arid,\r\nperfunctory teaching of law current at the time had small attraction\r\nfor one who wanted to know the reason of things; but he persevered,\r\nand did well in his examinations, though it is probable that he always\r\ngave a big slice of his time to reading poetry and history. He was now\r\nat the University. Probably he went to school, though there is some\r\ndoubt about it; at all events he seems to have escaped the brutality\r\nand bad pedagogy, which generally made school life then one long\r\nmisery for a high-principled or sensitive lad. University life began\r\nat an early age in Italy, and Mazzini had matriculated at Genoa, when\r\nhe was fourteen. So far as his fellow-students were concerned, he was\r\nin happy surroundings. But he was a troublesome scholar, always ready\r\nto rebel against the formalities that made a big part of University\r\nlife. To the last he refused to attend the compulsory religious\r\nobservances, not because he disliked them, but because they were\r\ncompulsory; and the authorities, tolerant for once, shut their eyes to\r\nhis insubordination. The University of Genoa did not possess a high\r\nname for scholarship; and at this time it had its special drawbacks,\r\nfor the government was scared by the recent revolution, and fearful\r\nthat a few hundred lads might shake the pillars of the state. No one\r\ncould matriculate without a certificate that he had regularly attended\r\nchurch and confession. Those whose parents did not possess a certain\r\nquantity of landed property, had to pass a stiffer examination, though\r\nat the worst, it is probable, not a very prohibitive one. Lecturers,\r\nbeadles, porters, all had the cue from government to make life\r\nunpleasant for the students, and the better professors dared not be\r\ndetected in any leniency or considerateness. Moustaches were\r\nforbidden, as a mark of the revolutionary mind, and if any student,\r\ngreatly daring, grew them, he was carried off between two carabineers\r\nto a barber's shop.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOUSE at GENOA in which MAZZINI Was BORN]\r\n\r\nMazzini soon became a leader among the clean-living, affectionate,\r\nimpetuous undergraduates. His appearance was now, as always, very\r\nstriking; he had a high and prominent forehead, black, flashing eyes,\r\nfine olive features, set in a mass of thick black hair, a grave,\r\nserious face, that could look hard at times, but readily melted in the\r\nkindliest of smiles. He led a studious, retiring life, fond of\r\ngymnastics and fencing, but with small taste for amusements, his\r\ncigars and coffee his only indulgences; his days spent among his\r\nbooks, his evenings with his mother, or in long solitary walks that\r\ndefied the weather, or in rare and stolen visits to the theatre, which\r\nhe had to leave after the first act, for the home was rigorously shut\r\nat ten. But, though he was slow to make close friendships, he was no\r\nmisanthrope. He played much on the guitar and sang well to it; and his\r\nmusical talents and clever reciting made him in demand among his\r\nmiddle-class and patrician friends. There was none yet of the\r\nhalf-bitter sadness of after life; he had a shrewd sense of humour,\r\nperhaps inherited from his mother; when warmed by enthusiasm or\r\nindignation, he could speak with a fiery eloquence, that was\r\nremarkable even among those declamatory Italian youths. \"My soul,\" he\r\nwrote afterwards, \"was then a smile for all created things, life\r\nshowed to my virgin fancy as a dream of love, my warmest thoughts were\r\nfor nature's loveliness and the ideal woman of my youth.\" He revelled\r\nin generous actions, sharing books and money, even clothes, with his\r\npoorer friends. But it was sheer force of character that gave him his\r\nascendancy over them--the loyal, justice-loving nature that made him\r\nchampion of every victim of undergraduate or professorial spite, the\r\npurity of thought, that checked each loose or coarse word from those\r\nabout him. That clear, high soul, untouched by self, not knowing fear,\r\npassionate for righteousness, gave him even when a lad the power that\r\nbelongs only to the saints of God.\r\n\r\nHis closest friends were three brothers, Jacopo, Giovanni, and\r\nAgostino Ruffini. Jacopo, the eldest of the three, had perhaps more\r\ninfluence on Mazzini's life than any other man. They were born on the\r\nsame day; and Jacopo's fine, sensitive, enthusiastic nature matched\r\nwell with Mazzini's own. The tragic fate, that afterwards brought his\r\nlife to an early close, only strengthened the influence; and the\r\nmemory of one so dear, who gave his life for their common cause,\r\nremained a perennial inspiration to keep his faith alive in years of\r\nweariness and failure. The other brothers had little of Jacopo's\r\ntemperament. Giovanni at this time was an even-tempered, humourous,\r\nbrilliant lad; Agostino was impressionable, impulsive, shallow, of\r\nquick and artistic nature. Mazzini's closest companions for some\r\nyears, they proved how little they could rise to his high level, and\r\nthey repaid his devotion by a want of sympathy and an ingratitude,\r\nwhich, in Agostino's case at all events, was gross. In later life both\r\nattained in their small way; both were deputies in the Piedmontese\r\nparliament, and Giovanni was minister at Paris. They long moved in\r\nEnglish society and had some reputation there. Agostino, who was for a\r\ntime a teacher at Edinburgh, is the \"Signor Sperano\" who tells the\r\nstory of _The Poor Clare_, in Mrs Gaskell's _Round the Sofa_.\r\nGiovanni, who became as proficient in English as in his mother tongue,\r\nwrote two notable but now half-forgotten tales, _Lorenzo Benoni_ and\r\n_Doctor Antonio_, which stand among the best second-rate novels of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nUnder Mazzini's lead the group of friends at Genoa formed a society to\r\nstudy literature and politics and smuggle in forbidden books. Half the\r\nmasterpieces of contemporary European literature came at this time\r\nunder the censor's ban; no foreign papers were admitted except two\r\nultra-monarchical French journals; and contraband was a necessity of\r\nliterary study. Mazzini's strongest interests took him to literature.\r\nHe read omnivorously in Italian and French and English and\r\ntranslations from the German.[2] His favourite books, he tells us,\r\nwere the Bible and Dante, Shakespeare and Byron. His close knowledge\r\nof the Gospels comes out in everything he wrote. He shed his orthodoxy\r\nindeed as soon as he began to think; he went sometimes to mass, when a\r\nlad, and read Condorcet's _Esquisse_ disguised as a missal; but he\r\nrefused to go to confession as soon as he understood its meaning,--the\r\none thing, apparently, in all his life which pained his mother. For a\r\nshort time he went through a phase of scepticism, but the Ruffinis'\r\nmother soon rescued him from this, and a deep religious faith came to\r\nhim, to remain the spring of all his life. The poets he loved best\r\nwere Dante and Byron, and he always remained true to them. From Dante\r\nhe learnt many of the master-ideas of his mind, the conception of the\r\nunity of man and unity of law, the fervid patriotism, the belief in\r\nItaly and Rome predestined to be teachers of the world, the faith in\r\nItalian Unity, the moral strength that makes life one long fight for\r\ngood. When only some twenty years old, he wrote an essay on Dante's\r\npatriotism, which, however boyish in style, proves his close knowledge\r\nof the master. Byron was then at the height of his fame, and then, as\r\nalways afterwards, Mazzini thought him the greatest of modern English,\r\nperhaps of modern European poets. He was \"completely fascinated\" by\r\nGoethe, and would often say that \"to pass a day with him or a genius\r\nlike him would be the fairest day of life.\" How his admiration for\r\nGoethe waned, while that for Byron grew, will be told in another\r\nchapter.[3] He read Shakespeare, but always, apparently, with more\r\nrespect than enjoyment, and Shakespeare too came under the same ban as\r\nGoethe. He thought very highly of Schiller, and placed him with\r\nÆschylus and Shakespeare, as the third great dramatist of the world.\r\nHe read a good deal of English literature; at this time he was a\r\nfervent admirer of Scott, but he seems afterwards to have lost his\r\ninterest in him; he knew something at least of Wordsworth and Shelley,\r\nBurns and Crabbe. Modern French literature, except de Vigny's and some\r\nof Victor Hugo's writings, did not now (nor, with the exception of\r\nGeorge Sand and Lamennais, at any time), appeal to him, for he\r\ndisliked the tendencies of French Romanticism, and already there were\r\nthe beginnings of his life-long prejudice against most things French.\r\nAmong his modern fellow-countrymen Alfieri and Foscolo were his\r\nfavourites; he read Manzoni and Guerrazzi, but largely to criticise\r\nthem, though he was ready to do justice to the strength of both. He\r\nthought Mickiewicz, the Polish national poet, \"the most powerful\r\npoetic nature of the time.\" The classics he no doubt read pretty\r\nwidely, as every educated lad was then bound to do, but none seem to\r\nhave made much impression on him, except Æschylus, for whom his\r\nveneration was unbounded, and Tacitus. Both now and later he gave much\r\ntime to metaphysical and political writers. He read something of\r\nHegel, whom he detested for his political fatalism, of Kant and\r\nFichte; but the German who influenced him most was the now-forgotten\r\nHerder. From him he learned or confirmed his spiritual conception of\r\nlife, his belief in immortality, his theory of the progress of\r\nhumanity and man's co-operation in the work of Providence. Among\r\nItalian philosophers he studied Giordano Bruno and Vico; he rated the\r\nlatter at his real worth, and regarded him as the great luminary of an\r\nItalian school of thought whose continuity he professed to trace from\r\nPythagoras. Among political writers Macchiavelli certainly impressed\r\nhim most, as a great Italian patriot, and he excused his morality as a\r\nproduct of his time. He seems to have known a good deal of Voltaire\r\nand Rousseau. Of recent political writers, he and his circle most read\r\nGuizot and Victor Cousin, whose lectures at this time made them the\r\nmentors of young liberalism; he records how the group at Genoa handed\r\non to one another manuscript copies of the lectures, and found their\r\ninspiration in the men whom they were soon to regard as traitors.\r\n\r\nNow and for long after, literature was the call that spoke sweetest\r\nto Mazzini. Politics and conspiracy were constraining but unwelcomed\r\nduties; he gave his love to literature. To be a dramatist or write\r\nhistorical novels was at this time his plan of life. Many a time in\r\nlater years he was still looking for the day, when Italy would be\r\nunited and free, and, his political task accomplished, he could give\r\nhimself to the literary schemes he still cherished,--a history of\r\nreligious ideas, a popular history of Italy, and the editing of a\r\nseries of the great dramas of the world. But the burden of his\r\ncountry's woe lay too heavily on him to be long forgotten. It was no\r\ntime now for Dante studies or play-writing. Sadly and unwillingly he\r\nconvinced himself that at such a time pure literature was no patriot's\r\nfirst task, that the writer, who would not shirk his duty, must make\r\nhis work political. Not but what the literary critic still appears on\r\nevery page; but the whole gist of his teaching is that the value of a\r\nbook is in proportion to its power to inform the reader's soul to love\r\nof country and mankind, and impel him to serve his fellows by\r\npolitical action in the sight of God. He held it wasted effort to do,\r\nwhat Manzoni had tried to do,--to school the individual to a smug life\r\nof cloistered virtue, a life which in a vicious or torpid society was\r\nimpossible to the many. No religion, no morality, he taught, is worth\r\nthe writer's labours, unless it dedicates men to be workers in the\r\npublic cause, to hold comfort, and, if need be, home and life itself\r\nas cheap, while oppression and wrong are stunting other lives, and men\r\nand women round are crying to be freed.\r\n\r\nHe found his opportunity in the controversy between Romanticists and\r\nClassicists, which then divided the literary world of Italy into hot\r\nfactions. Not that he held Romanticism to be any final or faultless\r\nform of literature. But when a theory of literary servitude, like\r\nClassicism, lent itself to political oppression and depressed the\r\nvital and spiritual forces of the country, when a young and vigorous\r\nmovement was making literature free and stood for liberty all round,\r\nhe necessarily took his stand for the latter. There could be no\r\npolitical or social regeneration for Italy, till she had a literature\r\nthat made for freedom and progress. \"These literary disputes,\" he\r\nurged, \"are bound up with all that is important in social and civil\r\nlife\"; \"the legislation and literature of a people always advance on\r\nparallel lines,\" and \"the progress of intellectual culture stands in\r\nintimate relationship with the political life of the country.\" It was\r\nthe aim of the Romanticists \"to give Italians an original national\r\nliterature, not one that is as a sound of passing music to tickle the\r\near and die, but one that will interpret to them their aspirations,\r\ntheir ideas, their needs, their social movement.\" And thus, while\r\ngenerously recognising Manzoni's worth, he looked rather to Alfieri\r\nand Foscolo, who had scourged political wrong-doing and preached\r\nresistance to tyranny; he praised the writers of the _Conciliatore_,\r\nthe short-lived Milanese journal of Silvio Pellico and Confalonieri,\r\nwhich, like himself, had turned Romanticism to political purposes.\r\nHere and there in his writings of this time a more or less direct\r\npolitical allusion manages to escape the censor's eye. He speaks for\r\nthe first time of \"Young Italy,\" a name soon to ring through Europe;\r\nhe pays his tribute to the political exiles; he slips in a remark\r\nthat the spirit of a state cannot be changed without recasting its\r\ninstitutions. More than this he could not do in a censor-ridden press;\r\nperhaps literature was struggling still with politics to command his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he had trouble enough with the censors. His first published\r\narticles appeared in the _Indicatore Genovese_, a commercial paper\r\nissuing at Genoa, whose editor was persuaded to admit short notices of\r\nrecent books, which gradually swelled into literary essays. Among his\r\nlater contributions were an article on the historical novel and\r\nreviews of Friedrich Schlegel's History of Literature and Guerrazzi's\r\nBattle of Benevento. They do not read very well. They are juvenile and\r\nexaggerated, and it is amusing to find the twenty-three years' old\r\nauthor telling his coeval Guerrazzi, the young Leghorn novelist, that\r\nhe had not drunk enough of the cup of life to be a pessimist. The\r\n_Indicatore_ gradually became a literary paper, and for a few months\r\nthe censorship did not see what it was tending to. At the end of 1828,\r\nhowever, about a year after Mazzini began to write in it, it was\r\nsuppressed. Mazzini easily transferred his energies. Guerrazzi had\r\nfounded another paper at Leghorn much on the same lines, the\r\n_Indicatore Livornese_, and asked Mazzini to send contributions.\r\nMazzini readily responded; he wrote, besides minor papers, an article\r\non Faust, and attacked the defects of the Romanticist School in an\r\nessay on _Some Tendencies of European Literature_. His writing is\r\nstill effusive, and generally dogmatic and sententious, but the style\r\nhas improved. The censorship was comparatively lenient in Tuscany,\r\nand though the young writers were barred from direct reference to\r\npolitics, they were able to make the political allusions sufficiently\r\ntransparent. But the paper grew too daring even for the somnolent\r\nTuscan censors, and, like its predecessor, it was snuffed out after a\r\nyear of life. Mazzini and Guerrazzi parted, to go on very different\r\nways, and meet again nineteen years later when both were famous.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mazzini had with some difficulty got a footing on the\r\n_Antologia_, the one Italian review of the time that ranked among the\r\ngreat European periodicals. It had been founded some ten years before,\r\nin the hope that it might become an Italian Edinburgh Review, by Gino\r\nCapponi, the blind Florentine noble who traced his race from the\r\nCapponi who bearded Charles VIII., and Vieusseux, a Swiss bookseller\r\nwho had settled at Florence and opened the one circulating library of\r\nany note in Italy. Most of the leading Italian writers of the day\r\ncontributed to it; and though its aim was avowedly nationalist, and in\r\na sense Liberal, it had succeeded so far, thanks probably to its\r\ninfluential patrons, in eluding the censor's ban. Mazzini wrote for it\r\nthree articles _On the Historical Drama_ and another _On a European\r\nLiterature_. His work had rapidly matured, and there is no trace now\r\nof the juvenilities of his earlier efforts. Every page has the mark of\r\nthe strong, original thought, which made him one of the greatest\r\ncritics of the century.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was practising at the bar in a desultory fashion.\r\nSometimes he pleaded in the lower courts as an \"advocate of the poor,\"\r\nand was much in demand for his attention and skill. According to the\r\netiquette of the profession, he read in the rooms of a barrister, who\r\nlimited his interest to seeing that his pupils sat with a book in\r\nfront of them. The vacations were generally spent in a little country\r\nvilla at San Secondo, in the Bisagno valley, within sight of a house\r\nwhich the Ruffinis occupied; and he shared in attentions to the\r\nRuffinis' mother, who was now his spiritual guide and dearest friend,\r\nor went on botanical walks or shooting expeditions in the lovely hill\r\ncountry. He did not do much of the shooting himself, and when he was\r\nmore than fifty, he remembered with remorse a thrush that he had\r\nmangled when sixteen.\r\n\r\nHis interests became more and more absorbed by politics. His Genoese\r\nhome no doubt encouraged this, for the nobles and the working-classes\r\nwere still unreconciled to Piedmontese rule, while the liberals of the\r\nmiddle classes looked on the annexation only as a step to some wider\r\nItalian state. But the local environment was only a minor influence,\r\nand Mazzini would doubtless have become a conspirator, had he lived in\r\nany other town of Italy. About the time that he began to write in the\r\n_Indicatore Genovese_, he was admitted into the Society of the\r\nCarbonari. The Carbonari were at this time suffering from the\r\ndecadence, which sooner or later palsies every secret society. They\r\nhad grown out of Neapolitan Freemasonry in the days of the French\r\nrule, and when, after Napoleon's fall, reaction came and the old\r\ndynasties returned, they swept into their ranks the mass of\r\ndiscontented men, who, with very varying political ideals, were at one\r\nin resenting the small tyrannies, the bigotry and obscurantism of the\r\nprinces, who had come back from exile to misgovern and sometimes to\r\noppress. The high level of their tenets, their appeals to religion and\r\nmorality, the esoteric symbolism of their rites, the vague democratic\r\nsentiment that was often only skin-deep, had made them a vast Liberal\r\norganisation. Since they had made and wrecked the revolutions of\r\nNaples and Piedmont seven years before, they had kept the skeleton of\r\ntheir party together with considerable skill and persistency. But the\r\nconspiracy had changed its character. It was no longer a purely\r\nItalian society, for the exiles had carried it into France and Spain,\r\nand the headquarters were now at Paris, where Lafayette and the\r\nOrleanist conspirators were using it to upset the Legitimist monarchy\r\nand dreamed of a league of Latin countries to balance the Holy\r\nAlliance. In Italy the democratic sentimentalism had left it, it had\r\nlost touch with the masses, and its leaders were mostly middle-aged\r\nmen of the professional classes, who discouraged young recruits, and\r\nhad no wish to step outside their meaningless small formalisms and\r\nbarren talk of liberty.\r\n\r\nMazzini had little stomach for their ritualism and lack of purpose,\r\ntheir love of royal and noble leaders; and probably the subordinate\r\nposition, that as a young man he necessarily took, sat uncomfortably\r\non him. But at all events they were the only revolutionary\r\norganisation in the country, and he admired the bravery of men, who\r\nrisked prison or exile for however inadequate an end. Though fitfully\r\nin practice, he had a theoretic belief in subordination, which\r\nprepared him for the moment to act under orders. But as soon as he\r\njoined the Carbonari and swore the usual oath of initiation over a\r\nbared dagger, he began to see the futility of it all. He found that\r\nhe was sworn only to obey his unknown chiefs, and he was allowed to\r\nknow the names of two or three only of his fellow-conspirators. He\r\nsuspected that their political programme, if they had any, was but a\r\nthin one. All the Italian in him revolted against men, who talked\r\nlightly of their country, and preached that salvation could only come\r\nfrom France. The subscription to the Society's funds, of which,\r\nneedless to say, no account was rendered, was sufficiently heavy to\r\nbear hardly on his slender purse. He was so sickened by a melodramatic\r\nannouncement, perhaps in bluff, that a member was to be assassinated\r\nfor criticising the chiefs, that he threatened to withdraw. His\r\nunknown superiors, however, apparently thought well of him, and he was\r\ncommissioned to go on propagandist work to Tuscany, where he made a\r\nfew recruits. He seems to have returned in better spirits as to the\r\nfuture of the Society; and if we may believe Giovanni Ruffini, he\r\nbegan with a few young co-affiliates to organise on his own account,\r\nnominally in the name of the Carbonari, but really to substitute a\r\nmore vigorous association. His plan was apparently to bring the\r\nCarbonari of Tuscany and Bologna into closer touch with those of Genoa\r\nand Piedmont. He asked for a passport for Bologna on the pretext that\r\nhe wanted to examine a Dante manuscript, but was told by the police,\r\nthat if he had no more important business, he could wait. Baffled in\r\nthis, he returned to his semi-independent conspiracy at home. The July\r\nRevolution in France had raised the hopes of liberals everywhere; and\r\nhe and his friends enrolled affiliates, discarding the Carbonaro\r\nlumber of oaths and secret signs, and simply pledging them to act, if\r\nan insurrection proved possible. Bullets were cast, and other juvenile\r\npreparations made. How far he succeeded in enlisting followers, we do\r\nnot know, for he himself has left hardly any record of the plan.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it was abruptly nipped. The government had its secret\r\nagents among the Carbonari, and Mazzini was arrested on the charge of\r\ninitiating one of them. It is probable that the authorities had\r\nsuspected him for some time. He was, as the governor of Genoa told his\r\nfather, \"gifted with some talent, and too fond of walking by himself\r\nat night absorbed in thought. What on earth,\" asked the offended\r\nofficer, \"has he at his age to think about? We don't like young people\r\nthinking without our knowing the subject of their thoughts.\" Mazzini\r\nwas taken to the fortress of Savona, where he consoled himself by\r\nwatching the sea and sky, which made all the prospect from his cell\r\nwindows, and taming a serin finch, which would fly in through the\r\ngratings, and to which he \"became exceedingly attached.\" His case came\r\nbefore the Senate of Turin, the highest court in the country. In the\r\neyes of the law he was supremely guilty; but, with an adroitness that\r\nhe afterwards recalled with pride, he managed to destroy all\r\ncompromising papers, and there was only one witness of the initiation,\r\nwhereas the law required two. Mazzini stoutly denied the fact. The\r\ndenial was more than a plea of not guilty in an English court; perhaps\r\nhe thought that a conspirator is bound to put his government outside\r\nthe pale of moral obligation. But whatever we may allow for his\r\nposition, the plain man will count his action as one of the\r\ndisingenuous lapses, that rarely, now and again, stain the clear\r\nhonour of his life.\r\n\r\nThe court had to acquit him, but the authorities had too much evidence\r\nof his activity to leave him unmolested. They gave him the choice\r\nbetween internment in a small town or exile. Contemporary events\r\ndecided him. The revolution had just broken out in Central Italy; the\r\nFrench government had encouraged the Carbonari to expect direct or\r\nindirect assistance, and Mazzini thought that he would serve the cause\r\nbest at Paris, whence, he confidently hoped, he would soon return to a\r\nliberated Italy. In February 1831 he said his good-byes to his family,\r\nwho had hastened to Savona, and crossed the Apennines and, for the\r\nfirst time, the Alps, afterwards so familiar and beloved. He watched\r\nthe sunrise from Mont Cenis, and has left a memorable description of\r\nit, drawn with all the wealth of his artistic imagery. At Geneva he\r\nmade the acquaintance of Sismondi and his Scotch wife. While there, he\r\nwas advised to join the Italian exiles at Lyons, and, giving up the\r\nprojected journey to Paris, he made his way to them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] So Madame Mario, who probably had it from Mazzini's mother, and\r\nMadame Venturi on the authority of a college friend. The memoir by\r\nanother fellow-student in _Epistolario di G. Mazzini_, I. xxix. says\r\nthat he thought that a doctor was not free to express his opinions for\r\nfear of offending his patients, and that he therefore never studied\r\nmedicine; so too Donaver, _Uomini e libri_, 70. But see his _Vita di\r\nG. Mazzini_, 13, on apparently good evidence.\r\n\r\n[2] He seems never to have learnt to read German easily; at all events\r\nhe could not do so till comparatively late in life.\r\n\r\n[3] See pp. 325-327.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nYoung Italy\r\n\r\n1831-1833. AETAT 25-27\r\n\r\n     Condition of Italy--The Revolution of 1831--Young Italy--Its\r\n     principles: belief in Italy; inspiration of duty; social\r\n     reform--Its political system: Republicanism; Italian Unity;\r\n     war with Austria--Secret societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governor of the prison at Savona had allowed him to read the\r\nBible, Byron, and Tacitus, innocently thinking that they contained no\r\nrevolutionary material. Out of these and Dante sprang Young Italy.\r\nItaly was ripe for the teaching of the epoch-making society. The\r\ncountry was \"a geographical expression.\" Conquerors, whose appetites\r\nhad been tempted by the Southern land, had carved it into appanages\r\nfor themselves. Austria held Lombardy and the lands of the Venetian\r\nrepublic; the King of Piedmont ruled the North-West, and Sardinia, and\r\nSavoy across the Alps; the Bourbons of Naples had the South; the Pope,\r\nthe grand-duke of Tuscany, the petty dukes of Modena, Parma, and Lucca\r\ndivided up the Centre. Nor had there been any serious demand for\r\nunity. History and character sundered North and South; the great\r\nmedieval cities still cherished their independence too dearly to wish\r\nto sink it in a common country. Napoleon, while he ruled, had gone far\r\nto unite the land both in form and substance; and the aspirations he\r\ndid so much to create survived him. Weak though they still were,\r\npractical grievances were ever enforcing the argument for unity; and\r\nItalians were chafing more and more against the artificial barriers,\r\nwhich stopped the circulation of the nation's life. The customs-lines,\r\nthat met the trader on the confines of each state, strangled commerce.\r\nLiterature circulated with difficulty, and the Genoese could hardly\r\nget access to books published at Florence or Leghorn, a hundred miles\r\naway. In the smaller states at all events, the area was too small to\r\noffer any field for enterprise, and every lawyer and engineer and\r\ncivil servant was cribbed by the restrictions, that confined his\r\nactivities to a handful of towns. Through all the peninsula there was\r\na more or less intolerable misrule. Political disabilities allowed no\r\nvoice in legislation, no control of taxation or the executive, no\r\nrights of public meeting or association, small liberty of speech or\r\nwriting. There were more present grievances in the discouragement of\r\neducation, in the clerical tyranny, in the obsolete and partial legal\r\nsystem. And the misgovernment had its yet more evil and intimate\r\naspect in the power of the police, which threatened each man's home\r\nand honour and career. Governments, that breathed and moved in chronic\r\ndread of revolution, sought safety in a system of covert terrorism.\r\nThe police had their spies everywhere,--in the streets, in men's\r\nhouseholds, in the churches, in the universities,--to scrape up any\r\nidle word or act, that seemed to mark a possible critic of government.\r\nThere were mitigations of the misrule in Piedmont, Tuscany, and the\r\nAustrian territories. But in the Pope's states and Naples there was\r\nlittle or nothing to relieve the crying corruption and incompetency;\r\nand everywhere there was more or less a vexatious intolerance and\r\noppression, that showed the blacker after the relative liberty and\r\nprogress of Napoleon's rule.\r\n\r\nThe Carbonari had voiced somewhat fitfully the national protest. And\r\njust at this time they made their final attempt at revolution. Early\r\nin February 1831,--just before Mazzini was released from Savona,--the\r\ninsurrection broke out in Modena, and spread at once to Parma and the\r\nPapal province of Romagna. In three weeks the greater part of the\r\nPope's dominions were free, and the insurgent army was marching\r\ntowards Rome. The leaders knew that, however easy it was to upset the\r\nrule of the Pope and Dukes, they could make no effective resistance to\r\nan Austrian attack; but they counted on the promised backing of France\r\nto ward off invasion. \"Non-intervention,\"--the European equivalent of\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine,--was one of the formulas of the July Monarchy,\r\nand by it Austria had no right to interfere in the domestic concerns\r\nof an Italian state. The French government had assured the Carbonari,\r\nthat, if she violated the principle, it would declare war against her.\r\nBut only a section of the ministry was sincere in the promise, and\r\nLouis Philippe saw that a war in the name of nationality might easily\r\nslide into a revolutionary movement, which would shake his own unsure\r\nthrone. His government let Metternich know that non-intervention was a\r\nphrase that stopped at words. By the end of March, despite some fine\r\nfighting by the Italian levies, the Austrians had stamped out the\r\nephemeral insurrection. Its feebleness courted failure. Not that the\r\nprogramme of the leaders wanted breadth and boldness. Mazzini's after\r\ncriticism that it was neither nationalist nor democratic was\r\nexaggerated and unjust. During their few weeks of rule, the chiefs had\r\nshowered projects of social reform. Some of them at all events wished\r\nto make Romagna the centre of a great national rising, and aimed at an\r\nindependent federation of all Italy with Rome for its capital. But\r\nthey made two irreparable mistakes. They did not face the facts; they\r\nfailed to win the people. They were for the most part, like the rest\r\nof the Carbonaro leaders, middle-aged professional men, out of touch\r\nwith the masses, possessed by the dread that popular imprudences might\r\nscare the diplomatists, on whom they built their hopes. Under an\r\ninspiring chief, the people would have fought perhaps, as they fought\r\nseventeen years later, when they drove the Austrians in confusion from\r\nBologna. But the leaders were not the men to touch their enthusiasm.\r\nThey had, in fact, miscalculated what the movement meant. These\r\ncomfortable men of peace flinched from the fact that Austria must be\r\nfought and beaten. They had no stuff for a desperate guerilla fight,\r\nthat meant the wasting of the country, privation and disease and\r\ndeath, for an uncertain hope that France might come eventually to the\r\nrescue. Still less were they prepared to launch on a forlorn\r\nenterprise, where friends were none and immediate disaster certain,\r\nthat they might be precursors of their children's victories.\r\n\r\nTheir failure, so consonant with all the later Carbonaro policy,\r\nconfirmed Mazzini in his belief that a new organisation was needed and\r\nnew men to lead it. As usual, he saw only one set of facts. He\r\nexaggerated the mistakes of the revolutionary governments, and left\r\nout of his reckoning the unreadiness of the people. The insurrections\r\nhad failed, he convinced himself, simply because they had been badly\r\nled. In the main, indeed, he was right. The revolution had been in the\r\nwrong hands. The Carbonaro chiefs kept at arm's-length younger men,\r\nwhose energy might have made up for their own unforwardness. If the\r\nnext revolution was to fare better, it must have these younger men to\r\ncaptain it, men of confidence and enthusiasm and fresh ideas, men with\r\na message that would nerve \"those artisans of insurrection, the people\r\nand the young.\" Mazzini had at this time a supreme faith in his\r\ngeneration; he had already written in the _Antologia_ of \"this young\r\nItaly of ours,\" so vigorous and cultured and warm-hearted, that no new\r\nmovement, however bold and difficult, was beyond its powers. \"Place,\"\r\nhe said now, \"the young at the head of the insurgent masses; you do\r\nnot know what strength is latent in those young bands, what magic\r\ninfluence the voice of the young has on the crowd; you will find in\r\nthem a host of apostles for the new religion. But youth lives on\r\nmovement, grows great in enthusiasm and faith. Consecrate them with a\r\nlofty mission; inflame them with emulation and praise; spread through\r\ntheir ranks the word of fire, the word of inspiration; speak to them\r\nof country, of glory, of power, of great memories.\" They had been\r\nmuzzled in the past; they must not be again. So rigidly did he insist\r\non this, that the rules of Young Italy excluded from membership,\r\nexcept in special cases, all who were over forty years. Mazzini had no\r\ndiffidence to curb the magnificent egotism of a design, in which he\r\nconsciously destined for himself the leading part. As one of his\r\nclosest friends of those days said, \"his confidence in men was great\r\nand in himself unlimited.\" \"All great national movements,\" he wrote in\r\nlater years, \"begin with unknown men of the people, without influence\r\nexcept for the faith and will, that counts not time or difficulties.\"\r\nIt is worth noting that Camillo Cavour, five years younger still, was\r\nat this same time writing to a friend that \"he would one fine morning\r\nwake up Prime Minister of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we disentangle Mazzini's ideas from the superfluous verbiage that\r\nsometimes wraps them, two leading principles are found to\r\ndifferentiate them from those of earlier movements,--the principles,\r\nthat, with his trick of making watchwords, he summed up in the phrase,\r\n\"God and the People.\" The new movement must have the inspiration and\r\npower of a religion. Italy needed something that would shake her from\r\nthe hopelessness of disillusion and defeat, something that would prove\r\nshe \"had a strength within her, that was arbiter of facts, mightier\r\nthan destiny itself.\" Action must be roused by action, energy by\r\nenergy, faith by faith,--the faith that made Rome great and inspired\r\nChristianity and sent forth the armies of the Convention, the faith\r\nthat makes the weak strong in the knowledge they are carrying out\r\nGod's will. Mazzini had two arguments to persuade his countrymen to\r\nthis believing and conquering patriotism. He hoped to fire them with\r\nhis own superb faith in Italy and her destinies. He called up \"that\r\nold name of Italy, hung round with memories and glory and majestic\r\ngriefs, that centuries of mute servitude could not destroy.\" Twice had\r\nshe been queen of the world; many times had she, the land of Dante and\r\nVico, of the Papacy and the Renaissance, inspired European thought.\r\n\"Italy,\" he said, \"has been called a graveyard; but a graveyard\r\npeopled by our mighty dead is nearer life than a land that teems with\r\nliving weaklings and braggarts.\" Her task was not yet done; she had\r\nstill to speak to the nations \"the gospel of the new age, the gospel\r\nof humanity.\" He pointed Italians to \"the vision of their country,\r\nradiant, purified by suffering, moving as an angel of light among the\r\nnations that thought her dead.\" Rightly he judged that men, who shared\r\nhis faith, would never despair of their country. But he had a more\r\nsounding note to strike. He had the genius to see that he who would\r\nhave men rise to high endeavour, must appeal to their unselfish\r\nmotives, that only when some great principle calls, will they lift\r\nthemselves to heroism and sacrifice of all that makes life dear. The\r\neffort to make Italy meant the loss of thousands of lives, meant exile\r\nand imprisonment and poverty, the blighting of homes and the misery of\r\ndear ones; and men would only face it at the call of duty. The\r\nCarbonari had no call; they came of a school that appealed to\r\ninterested motives, and the appeal inevitably broke down in the day of\r\ndisappointment and defeat. Mazzini offered his countrymen \"a national\r\nreligion\"; Young Italy was no mere political party, but \"a creed and\r\nan apostolate\"; it taught that victory came \"by reverence for\r\nprinciples, reverence for the just and true, by sacrifice and\r\nconstancy in sacrifice.\" As individuals and as a nation, they had a\r\nmission given them by God. God's law of duty bade them follow it;\r\nGod's law of progress promised them accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe other principle of Young Italy was social reform. Earlier liberal\r\nmovements had thought or attempted little for the masses, though at\r\nall events the recent rising in Romagna aimed higher than Mazzini gave\r\nit credit for, and had more of a democratic tendency than contemporary\r\nmovements in France and England. Mazzini exaggerated the revolutionary\r\nimpatience of the masses in 1821 and 1831; but it was true that such\r\nenthusiasm as they had, had been cooled by the disappointment of their\r\nhopes. Revolutions, as he said, had been Dead Sea apples to them. They\r\nwould be slow to stir again, till they saw that the liberation of\r\ntheir country had tangible social results in store. The gospel of duty\r\nwould rouse the cultured middle classes, but at this time he seems to\r\nhave thought that the uneducated, down-trodden, priest and\r\nofficial-ridden masses could not respond to the higher call, and must\r\nbe won by some visible prospect of relief from present evils. Pope\r\nJulius' cry of \"Out with the barbarian\" would not touch men, who did\r\nnot see how every social injustice leant in the last resort on\r\nAustria, how dear food, conscription, all the petty tyranny, were\r\nfruits of the foreign domination, that sheltered the princes who\r\nmisgoverned them. Till the masses felt this, there was no hope of a\r\nsuccessful war of liberation. \"Revolutions,\" he said, \"must be made\r\nfor the people and by the people, and so long as revolutions are, as\r\nnow, the inheritance and monopoly of a single class, and lead only to\r\nthe substitution of one aristocracy for another, we shall never find\r\nsalvation.\" The cry of the poor, unheard by most Italian statesmen\r\nfrom his time, down to yesterday, was ever with him. \"I see the people\r\npass before my eyes in the livery of wretchedness and political\r\nsubjection, ragged and hungry, painfully gathering the crumbs that\r\nwealth tosses insultingly to it, or lost and wandering in riot and the\r\nintoxication of a brutish, angry, savage joy; and I remember that\r\nthose brutalised faces bear the finger-print of God, the mark of the\r\nsame mission as our own. I lift myself to the vision of the future and\r\nbehold the people rising in its majesty, brothers in one faith, one\r\nbond of equality and love, one ideal of citizen virtue that ever grows\r\nin beauty and might; the people of the future, unspoilt by luxury,\r\nungoaded by wretchedness, awed by the consciousness of its rights and\r\nduties. And in the presence of that vision my heart beats with anguish\r\nfor the present and glorying for the future.\" That they would rise in\r\ninsurrection, he had no doubt. Once make them see whence sprang their\r\nwretchedness, where stood its remedies, once make them feel that \"God\r\nis on the side of the down-trodden,\" the people of Italy would be\r\nagain what they had been in the days of the Lombard League and the\r\nSicilian Vespers.\r\n\r\nOut of these principles,--social reform as the immediate end of\r\nrevolution and duty as its inspiration,--Mazzini built up an elaborate\r\npolitical programme. He loved system-making and hardly apologised for\r\nit. You cannot have unity or harmony without it, he urged, and to a\r\ncertain extent he had practical justification. It were better, as he\r\nsaid and as subsequent events proved, that the nationalists should\r\nargue out their differences before the time for action came, and not\r\nparalyse themselves by quarrels in front of the enemy. It was this\r\nwant of a positive programme, that was, he thought, largely\r\nresponsible for the failure of the Carbonari. Their policy had hardly\r\ngone beyond the overthrow of the existing governments; and they had\r\nmustered under their flag royalists and republicans, conservatives and\r\nliberals, with the inevitable result that after their first successes\r\nthey split their ranks and fell an easy prey. It were wiser, so\r\nMazzini pleaded, to be few but united. \"The strength of an association\r\ndepends not on its numbers but on its homogeneity.\" But the principle\r\nwas necessarily an intolerant one. It barred many a true patriot, who\r\ncould not swear to the whole Mazzinian doctrine. For such he had no\r\npity. In his view it was only fear, \"the Almighty God of most\r\npoliticians,\" that prevented the Moderates from accepting his\r\nposition. \"There can be no moderation,\" he said at a later date,\r\n\"between good and evil, truth and error, progress and reaction.\"\r\nUnluckily truth to him too often meant adhesion to his own theories;\r\nand he could never forgive men, who, starting from his premisses,\r\ncould not follow his logic to the end, though, like most men who pride\r\nthemselves on being logical, he was often singularly incapable of\r\naccurate reasoning. It was this intolerance that wrecked so much of\r\nhis after life, that made him waste his splendid powers in fighting\r\nmen, by whose side he ought to have been working.\r\n\r\nHowever, for better or worse, Mazzini required from his\r\nfellow-workers implicit acceptance of his theories,--theories which\r\nembraced every sphere of national life, religion and politics,\r\nliterature and art. His chief political doctrines were republicanism\r\nand Italian Unity. How he pieced republicanism on his general theory\r\nof things, is the subject of another chapter. It is sufficient here to\r\nnote that he was a republican, chiefly because he thought that\r\ndemocratic legislation was impossible under any form of monarchy. The\r\nbelief was natural enough at the time. Few had been the popular\r\nreforms under any European crown, while the one genuine series of\r\ndemocratic laws had been passed by the French Republic or while the\r\nFrench monarchy was tottering to its fall. Mazzini may be pardoned, if\r\nat that time he sharply sundered monarchies and republics, and failed\r\nto see how imperfect was the classification. In Italy, Mazzini saw\r\nspecial circumstances that made for a republic. Her great memories\r\nwere republican, though even he must have recognised how little the\r\nrepublics of medieval Italy had in common with his ideal polity. At\r\nVenice and his own Genoa the republican tradition was still dear.\r\nItalian republicanism was free from any recent memory of outrage and\r\nproscription, such as tarnished the name in France. And above all, he\r\nurged, there was no possible king for a united Italy. Each prince was\r\npledged to Austria, each had proved his sympathy with reaction.\r\nMonarchy in Italy had \"no splendid annals, no venerable traditions,\"\r\nno powerful nobility to buttress it. Two princes only had an army,\r\nwhich could help in the war of liberation; and neither the King of\r\nPiedmont nor the King of Naples would submit to the other without a\r\nbitter civil struggle. And the antipathies of North and South, though\r\nthey might bow to the principle of a common republic, would never\r\nallow the Neapolitan to take a king from Piedmont. History has proved\r\nhow wrong was his diagnosis, and temporarily and reluctantly he had\r\nglimpses of his error. More than once in after life, as we shall see,\r\nhe alternated his republicanism with fits of half-belief in the\r\nPiedmontese monarchy.\r\n\r\nHis advocacy of Italian Unity rests on a surer bottom. That the\r\ncountry was fated to stagnate till the foreigner had gone, was common\r\nground with every school of patriots. But when the Austrians had been\r\ndriven out, was Italy to be a federation of states or one united\r\ncountry? Mazzini pleaded that the point at issue between him and the\r\nfederalists was mainly one of practicability. This hardly took\r\nsufficient account of the school, which looked to Switzerland and\r\nAmerica for its types, and preferred a federation on its own merits.\r\nBut on the whole his contention was right. Every argument that told\r\nfor federation, told yet more forcibly for unity. The strength of the\r\nfederalist movement lay in the belief that unity was impossible. As\r\nyet, though Napoleon had foretold that unity must come, only a handful\r\nof Italians had dared to speak of it as a possible ideal. The great\r\nmajority doubted whether Italy even wished to be united, whether, if\r\nshe did, the facts of the European polity made it possible, whether\r\nunity could permanently stand the strain of the old provincial\r\nanimosities. It was easy for them to adduce a host of facts,--the\r\ndifferences of race and temperament and tradition, the various habits\r\nformed by dissimilar systems of law and land tenure and education,\r\nthe jealousies, still far from dead, that sundered province from\r\nprovince and city from city. Mazzini himself had felt the force of\r\ntheir arguments, and there was a moment, when even he had been shaken\r\nin his faith. He had little tangible reasoning to back his confidence.\r\nBut he had the prophetic assurance of a great possibility, and his\r\ncontagious faith made it a reality. He saw, when hardly another of his\r\ncontemporaries saw it, that Italian Unity was a practicable ideal; his\r\nteaching informed the national resolve, that changed the seemingly\r\nimpossible into a fact. To few men has it been given to create a great\r\npolitical idea; to fewer still to be not only the creator, but the\r\nchief instrument in realising it. Mazzini was both, and it gives him\r\ntitle to rank among the makers of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nBut there could be no unity, no republic, no political advance of any\r\nkind, till the inevitable war with Austria had been fought and won.\r\nShe would not surrender her Italian provinces, unless by force of\r\narms. She could not tolerate free institutions side by side with her\r\nown despotic rule. She had crushed the Neapolitan and Piedmontese\r\nrisings ten years before; she had done the same in Modena and Romagna\r\nyesterday. \"She robs us,\" said Mazzini, \"of life and country, name,\r\nglory, culture, material well-being.\" As Giusti said more pointedly a\r\nfew years later, the Italians \"ate Austria in their bread.\" Mazzini\r\nand many another patriot knew that any peaceful solution was utopian.\r\n\"The destinies of Italy,\" he preached, \"have to be decided on the\r\nplains of Lombardy, and peace must be signed beyond the Alps.\"\r\nMazzini rather welcomed war in a just cause. It would redeem the\r\ntorpid, disillusioned Italian, who was brave enough, as Napoleon's\r\ncampaigns had proved, but required much to nerve him to effort. It\r\nwould give Italy again her national self-respect, her claim to the\r\nesteem of other peoples. \"War,\" he said, \"is the eternal law, that\r\nstands between the master and the slave who breaks his chains.\" But\r\nMazzini in his saner moods saw the futility of any local or\r\nill-prepared rising. In words, that condemn only too eloquently much\r\nof his after action, he declared that only victory could justify a\r\nrising against Austria. It was only when the great mass of the people\r\nhad been won to the nationalist cause, that the patriots \"might\r\nstretch their hand to Lombardy and say, 'There are the men who\r\nperpetuate your servitude,' towards the Alps and say, 'There stand\r\nyour confines.'\" Mazzini's plan of campaign was guerilla fighting. It\r\nwas, as he said, the natural resource of an insurgent people, that had\r\nto win its freedom against disciplined armies,--the method chosen by\r\nthe Dutch against Philip II., by the American colonists against\r\nEngland, by the Spaniards and Greeks in more recent times. Had he\r\nlived now, he might have added another illustrious example. Italy,\r\nwith her long chain of mountains that no enemy could hold in force,\r\nhad special fitness for the strategy. \"Italians,\" he cried, \"look to\r\nyour mountains, there stand strength and infallible victory.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the work of Young Italy was to organise and educate;\r\nand the only possible organisation was that of the secret society.\r\nMazzini did not see its inherent weaknesses. Young Italy soon became\r\nas much the quarry of the spy and police agent as the Carbonari had\r\nbeen; and to the end of life Mazzini was the victim of informers, who\r\nwon his easy confidence. The society developed an uncontrolled and\r\nirresponsible leadership, and its chief, eager as he was and sincerely\r\neager to disclaim any desire to dictate, was too impatient, too\r\nself-confident to allow fair play to other men's convictions. As a\r\nmeans of preparing for war, it failed disastrously; and it proved an\r\nill school for the parliamentary politics of later days. But in a\r\ncountry, where any open expression of liberal sentiment meant prison\r\nor exile, if not the scaffold, there was no alternative; and as an\r\neducating influence it came to be the greatest of the forces that made\r\nItaly. Its writings, smuggled into every corner of the land, moved\r\nmany a young thinker to a passionate resolve, that bore its fruit in\r\nafter times. At this stage, however, Mazzini was hardly looking to the\r\nslow results of political education. The hour of insurrection, he\r\nconfidently believed, was near; the European revolution was\r\nthreatening, and Italy must not be behind the sister nations. He was\r\ncertain of success. Whatever difficulties might come to a nationalist\r\nmovement without a backing from the native governments, however much\r\nItalians might distrust their own unaided strength, there was \"no real\r\nobstacle for twenty-six millions of men, who wished to rise and fight\r\nfor their country.\" Austria, he calculated, could at the best put two\r\nhundred thousand men into the field; he fondly counted on four million\r\nItalian volunteers. A people, that even under the leading of the\r\nCarbonari had made three revolutions in ten years, would rise again\r\nmore readily and more victoriously at the inspiration of a nobler\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nMarseilles\r\n\r\n1831-1834. AETAT 25-28\r\n\r\n     At Marseilles--Spread of Young Italy--Letter to Charles\r\n     Albert--The Army Plot in Piedmont--At Geneva--The Savoy\r\n     Raid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mazzini arrived at Lyons, he found an unhopeful plan in\r\npreparation for raiding Savoy. Some 2000 Italian refugees, many of\r\nthem Piedmontese who had fled through Genoa ten years before and\r\nstirred his boyish enthusiasm, were ready to march under the hardly\r\nconcealed protection of the French government. It was still in the\r\nearly days of the July monarchy, when it had yet not quite forgotten\r\nits revolutionary origin. But before the expedition could start, Louis\r\nPhilippe's swift lapse into conservatism, which had already made him\r\nbreak his promises to the Romagnuols, abruptly ended the patronage of\r\nthe authorities. The would-be raiders were scattered, and Mazzini\r\njoined a small party of republicans, who were starting for Corsica, on\r\ntheir way to join the insurgents in Romagna. The Corsicans were still\r\nItalian in sentiment as well as race, and the Carbonaro influence was\r\nstrong in the island. Two thousand men offered themselves for service\r\nwith the insurgents, but no funds were forthcoming to pay their\r\npassage, and before arrangements could be made the news arrived that\r\nthe rising had collapsed.\r\n\r\nMazzini returned to Marseilles, and found himself among the refugees\r\nwho had escaped from Central Italy. He recruited a few young patriots\r\namong them, and with their help he began to give body to his schemes.\r\nIn a small room at Marseilles the young Titans started, with nothing\r\nbut their own sincerity and daring, to revolutionise Italy. \"We had no\r\noffice, no helpers,\" he wrote of them in after years. \"All day, and a\r\ngreat part of the night, we were buried in our work, writing articles\r\nand letters, getting information from travellers, enlisting seamen,\r\nfolding papers, fastening envelopes, dividing our time between\r\nliterary and manual work. La Cecilia was compositor; Lamberti\r\ncorrected the proofs; another of us made himself literally porter, to\r\nsave the expense of distributing the papers. We lived as equals and\r\nbrothers; we had but one thought, one hope, one ideal to reverence.\r\nThe foreign republicans loved and admired us for our tenacity and\r\nunflagging industry; we were often in real want, but we were\r\nlight-hearted in a way, and smiling because we believed in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nIn later life Mazzini looked back longingly to the freshness and\r\nenthusiasm of those days, before failure had disillusioned him or\r\nmisunderstanding estranged him from his friends. When he was well and\r\nhappy, all the charm of his nature--his radiant idealism, his\r\nwarm-hearted friendship, his contagious unselfishness--made him the\r\nbeloved inspirer of the little band that worked under his orders. \"He\r\nwas,\" said an Italian of him at this time, \"about 5 feet 8 inches high\r\nand slightly made; he was dressed in black Genoa velvet, with a large\r\n\"republican\" hat; his long, curling black hair, which fell upon his\r\nshoulders, the extreme freshness of his clear olive complexion, the\r\nchiselled delicacy of his regular and beautiful features, aided by his\r\nvery youthful look and sweetness and openness of expression, would\r\nhave made his appearance almost too feminine, if it had not been for\r\nhis noble forehead, the power of firmness and decision that was\r\nmingled with their gaiety and sweetness in the bright flashes of his\r\ndark eyes and in the varying expression of his mouth, together with\r\nhis small and beautiful moustachios and beard. Altogether he was at\r\nthat time the most beautiful being, male or female, that I had ever\r\nseen, and I have not since seen his equal.\"[4] But sometimes even now\r\noverwork and impatience told on him, and he felt ill and exhausted. In\r\nsuch moods he must have been a trying man to be much with--irritable,\r\nexacting, requiring absolute submission from his fellow-workers, angry\r\nif they thought well of men whom he disliked.\r\n\r\nFor two years the little band worked on, sowing the seeds of\r\nrevolution. It was a heroic enterprise. A few young men, without birth\r\nor wealth to help them, and, except for their leader, of no great\r\nability, were planning to change the future of their country and\r\npreparing for war with a great military empire. To an outsider it must\r\nhave seemed a madman's dream. But their masterful chief had taught\r\nthem his own faith; and they, and thousands of their countrymen after\r\nthem, found in it the power, to which few things are impossible. They\r\nworked with remorseless energy, month after month, corresponding with\r\nsympathisers all over the peninsula, planting lodges of Young Italy\r\nwherever a chance opened, drawing together the threads of conspiracy.\r\nThey found abundant backing in Italy. Mazzini appealed to his\r\nfollowers there to work among the people by every road that the\r\ndespotism left open, to bring children to school and teach them, to\r\nhold classes for men in the country districts, to circulate pictures\r\nand pamphlets and almanacs, which would insinuate patriotic ideas\r\nwithout exciting the suspicions of the police, to carry the cross of\r\nfire from town to town and village to village. \"Climb the hills,\" he\r\nasked of them, \"sit at the farmer's table, visit the workshops and the\r\nartisans, whom you now neglect. Tell them of their rightful liberties,\r\ntheir ancient traditions and glories, the old commercial greatness\r\nwhich has gone; talk to them of the thousand forms of oppression,\r\nwhich they ignore, because no one points them out.\" His appeal found a\r\nready response. Hundreds of young Italians, fired by his own passion,\r\ngave themselves to the dangers and toils and the thousand small\r\nannoyances of a conspirator's life. It was no light call. \"I know of\r\nno existence,\" said one of them in later life, \"which requires such\r\ncontinual self-abnegation and endurance. A conspirator has to listen\r\nto all sorts of gossip, to soothe every variety of vanity, discuss\r\nnonsense seriously, feel sick and stifling under the pressure of empty\r\ntalk, idle boasting, and vulgarity, and yet maintain an unmoved and\r\ncomplacent countenance. A conspirator ceases to belong to himself, and\r\nbecomes the toy of anyone he may meet; he must go out when he would\r\nrather stay at home, and stay at home when he would rather go out; he\r\nhas to talk when he would be silent, and to hold vigils when he would\r\nrather be in bed.\" And behind these petty vexations, which meant more\r\nto the Italians of that day than to a generation trained in\r\nstrenuousness, lay the knowledge that discovery meant prison or exile,\r\nperhaps death. But they faced it with the courage of men who believed\r\nthat the \"wear and tear was smoothing the way, inch by inch, towards a\r\nnoble and holy end,\" who looked to the day when through their labours\r\ntheir country would be lifted from the slough of misgovernment and low\r\nideals. Life and everything they were ready to give for that. \"Here\r\nare we,\" said Jacopo Ruffini to his fellow-conspirators at Genoa,\r\n\"five young, very young men, with but limited means, and we are called\r\non to do nothing less than overthrow an established government. I have\r\na presentiment that few of us will live to see the final results of\r\nour labours, but the seed we have sown will shoot forth after us, and\r\nthe bread we have cast upon the waters will be found again.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini might well be sanguine, with men like these behind him. He\r\nlooked to his literature to do the rest. The journal of Young Italy\r\nwas, as he described it, \"a collection of political pamphlets,\" each\r\nof the infrequent and irregular numbers consisting of a hundred to two\r\nhundred pages, badly printed on bad paper. Later on, it was set up by\r\nFrench compositors, who knew no Italian, and whose misprints gave him\r\ninfinite concern. He himself did most of the writing. It was terribly\r\ndiffusive often and wanting in precision, but his articles redeem\r\ntheir literary defects by the glow of noble purpose, that made them\r\nthrill their readers, and gave them a potency, that perhaps no other\r\npolitical writings of the century attained to. Most of the remaining\r\narticles came from his fellow-workers. Mazzini tried to persuade\r\nSismondi to contribute, but the historian, though sympathetic, was too\r\nopposed to some of his teaching to respond. Louis Napoleon, drawn by a\r\nfellow-feeling for conspiracy and scenting a chance to preach\r\nBonapartism, sent an essay on Military Honour, with the thesis that\r\nsoldiers are not bound by their oath to act against a revolution.\r\nMazzini consented to insert it with many emendations, which apparently\r\nleft little of its Bonapartist intention; but for some reason that\r\ndoes not appear, it was not published. The journal had a small\r\ncirculation, and only reached a limited number of young educated men;\r\nit was indeed too literary for popular consumption. There seems to\r\nhave been a larger demand for rules and instructions and popular\r\ntracts written by Gustavo Modena, afterwards to become one of the most\r\nfamous Italian tragedians of his day. At all events there was a\r\nconsiderable contraband of printed matter, smuggled to Genoa or\r\nLeghorn or across the passes into Piedmont, inside barrels of pitch\r\nand pumice stone or bales of drapery or packages of sausages. So great\r\nbecame the demand, that secret presses were set up in Italy and the\r\nTicino to supplement the output from Marseilles.\r\n\r\nThe results surpassed even Mazzini's sanguine hopes. The first lodges\r\nof Young Italy were planted at Genoa and Leghorn, and they spread\r\nthence to a good many towns of North and Central Italy. The chief\r\nstrength of the society lay at Genoa, where the nationalist and\r\nanti-Piedmontese parties made common cause, and men of every class\r\ncame in--nobles and commoners, lawyers and civil servants and priests,\r\nseamen and artisans. Outside Genoa the working men seem to have kept\r\naloof as a rule; years had yet to pass before Mazzini's social\r\nteaching reached them. The recruits came chiefly from the young men of\r\nthe middle classes, sons of the men who had had their importance under\r\nthe French rule and had been cribbed and kept under since the\r\nrestoration. Here and there a young noble joined; in Piedmont and at\r\nGenoa at all events there was a sprinkling of older professional and\r\nbusiness men; a few priests welcomed a movement, which bore so strong\r\na religious imprint. Everywhere the scattered remnants of the\r\nCarbonari enrolled themselves. Buonarrotti, _doyen_ of the\r\nconspirators, descendant of Michelangelo, friend of Robespierre and\r\nBaboeuf and Napoleon, attached his society of the _Veri Italiani_.\r\nEarly in 1833 Mazzini, it is impossible to say with what accuracy, put\r\nthe number of affiliates at fifty or sixty thousand. Many a man, who\r\ncame to the front in the later nationalist movement or in the first\r\nItalian parliaments, began his political life as a member of Young\r\nItaly. Garibaldi, a young sailor who wrote verses, just promoted to be\r\ncaptain in the Genoese mercantile marine, whose fearlessness and charm\r\nof manner made him the idol of the men under him, and who had already\r\nlearnt from Foscolo a belief in the destinies of Italy as ardent as\r\nMazzini's own, met the chief at Marseilles and joined the society.\r\nGioberti, who was teaching a transcendental and literary patriotism to\r\nthe novices in the Archbishop's seminary at Vercelli, sent warm words\r\nof encouragement to the cause of God and the People.\r\n\r\nAll Mazzini's preparations centred round Piedmont and Genoa. He\r\nrealised, with the bulk of patriots of whatever school, that though\r\nthe other provinces might play a secondary part, Piedmont must take\r\nthe lead. It was the only state that possessed the military training\r\nand traditions, essential in a war; it was the natural base for an\r\ninvasion of Lombardy; Alessandria and Genoa were two all-important\r\nstrategic points, and if the Italians were defeated in the plains,\r\nthey could fall back on the Alps and Apennines. There were few\r\nrepublicans among the Piedmontese, but they were nationalists with all\r\ntheir race's tenacity of purpose. The Genoese were zealots for the\r\ncause, all the more if it were under a republican flag; in Savoy there\r\nwas a strong strain of liberalism, and its position made it a\r\nconnecting link with sympathisers in France. Mazzini's first public\r\nact--some three or four months after he left Italy--was to write an\r\nopen letter to the king. Charles Albert had just ascended the throne\r\nof Piedmont; and expectation ran high, as it had run ten years before,\r\nthat he would lead the nationalists. This time there was small bottom\r\nfor the hope. Charles Albert had had his phase of liberalism; in his\r\nyouth he had relations with the Carbonari, and encouraged the\r\nPiedmontese conspirators of 1821 to look to him to lead the army to a\r\nwar for Lombard independence. Had he had the courage, he would have\r\nstood by his word. But as he was then, so was he now, a moral coward,\r\nbuffeted by irreconcilable ambitions. He was still a nationalist, but\r\nno liberal. Liberalism had come to loom before him as a spectre of\r\nRevolution, to be fought and crushed without pity. But priest-ridden\r\nabsolutist as he was, he never quite forgot his patriotic faith, he\r\nalways had some vision, faint though it often was, of an Italy\r\nuntrodden by the foreign soldier. It is probable that even now, in his\r\nworst years, he was waiting dubiously for the distant day, when he\r\nwould measure himself with the enemy. But he knew that as yet this was\r\nimpossible. He had a saner view than Mazzini of the possibilities of\r\nthe time, when France--on the high road to the _juste-milieu_--would\r\ngive no help, and a single-handed fight with Austria was foredoomed to\r\ndefeat. He would have scorned an offer of Mazzini's guerilla bands;\r\nbut had he been as ready to welcome the volunteers, as his son was\r\ntwenty-eight years later, they had little prospect of existence at\r\nthis time outside Mazzini's visionary hopes.\r\n\r\nSuch was Charles Albert, when Mazzini appealed to him to lead the\r\nnationalist movement. What was the exact purpose of the letter, will\r\nprobably never be known. In after life Mazzini denied that there was\r\nany serious intention in it; he pleaded that he expressed the hopes of\r\nothers rather than his own, and wrote it in the certainty that its\r\nappeal would not be heard. At the time he disclaimed, though not so\r\nemphatically, any hope of a response, and suggested that its object\r\nwas to disillusion the Piedmontese of any belief in their king. There\r\nis some reason for thinking that the disclaimers must not be taken\r\nquite literally. When he wrote twenty years and more afterwards, he\r\nwas anxious to prove that he had never lapsed from his republican\r\nfaith. His earlier commentary was in a letter to a man, whom he did\r\nnot know, and to whom he was not likely to express himself\r\nunreservedly. There are indications that he had not quite escaped the\r\nglamour that Charles Albert threw over the liberals, had not entirely\r\nabandoned all hope of winning him. The secret instructions of Young\r\nItaly, written a few months later, accepted the possibility of a\r\nmonarchy as a \"system of transition\"; and in the subsequent army plot\r\nMazzini intended to offer the King the leadership of the revolution.\r\nOne would fain believe that his own interpretations do him injustice,\r\nthat he did not write his glowing prose in utter insincerity. Were it\r\notherwise, we must bow the head and sadly own a stain upon that noble\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe letter, it must be confessed, was hardly calculated to make a\r\nconvert. Threats alternate with overdone praise; the assumption of\r\npolitical omniscience, the claim of the young exile to speak for\r\nItaly, the magniloquent parade of the obvious, must have, like much\r\nelse of his earlier writings, offended Italian common-sense and been\r\nextremely irritating. Much of it reads like a declamatory school essay\r\non the duties of a constitutional king. But the lesson was true enough\r\non its negative side. Charles Albert could find no safe foothold\r\noutside popular government; coercion, administrative reform, the\r\nsupport of Austria or France--none would permanently content or\r\noverawe his people. And if Charles Albert had retorted that to grant a\r\nconstitution meant war with Austria, Mazzini would have welcomed the\r\ncorollary. The King was right and Mazzini was wrong as to the\r\ninopportuneness of a national rising at the moment. But for the policy\r\nof another day, the letter has passages that speak like a trumpet\r\ncall. \"Sire, there is another road, leading to true power and a\r\nglorious immortality; another ally, safer and more strong than\r\nAustria or France. There is a crown more brilliant and sublime than\r\nthat of Piedmont, a crown that waits the man, who dares to think of\r\nit, who dedicates his life to winning it, and scorns to dull its\r\nsplendour with thoughts of petty tyranny. Sire, have you never cast an\r\neagle glance upon this Italy, so fair with nature's smile, crowned by\r\ntwenty centuries of noble memory, the land of genius, strong in the\r\ninfinite resources that only want a common purpose, girt round with\r\nbarriers so impregnable, that it needs but a firm will and a few brave\r\nbreasts to shelter it from foreign insult? Place yourself at the head\r\nof the nation, write on your flag, 'Union, Liberty, Independence.'\r\nFree Italy from the barbarian, build up the future, be the Napoleon of\r\nItalian freedom. Do this and we will gather round you, we will give\r\nour lives for you, we will bring the little states of Italy under your\r\nflag. Your safety lies on the sword's point; draw it and throw away\r\nthe scabbard. But remember, if you do it not, others will do it\r\nwithout you and against you.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was published in May or June 1831, and a few copies found\r\ntheir way into Italy. Mazzini thought he had evidence that the King\r\nread it. At all events his police did, and ordered the writer whose\r\nanonymity did not conceal him, to be seized, if he crossed the\r\nfrontier. Whatever Mazzini's hopes may have been, this proved that the\r\nletter had failed in its ostensible object, and he threw himself\r\nfeverishly into his preparations for a revolt in Piedmont. His\r\ndetailed scheme shows that he had not yet planned or had abandoned for\r\nthe time the strategy of guerilla fighting, and intended to rely on\r\nthe Piedmontese army. Charles Albert was, if possible, to be\r\npersuaded to lead the revolution, and the army was to be mobilised for\r\nan immediate advance on Lombardy. Should the King decline the offer, a\r\nprovisional directorate at Genoa would assume the government. Mazzini\r\nhad better ground for his hopes than often afterwards. The army had\r\nnot forgotten that it had led the constitutional and nationalist\r\nmovement ten years before. Many a soldier, who had served in the\r\n_Grande Armée_, cherished the democratic sentiment that clung to it\r\nall through, and was eager to avenge himself on the enemy, whom he had\r\nrouted in old days. These feelings were especially strong among the\r\nnon-commissioned officers. Many of them were men of the middle classes\r\nof good standing and education, for in many, if not all, of the\r\nregiments commissions could be held only by those of noble birth, and\r\nno bourgeois, whatever his capacities, could rise above the ranks. A\r\nfew officers joined the society, and a general or two promised to\r\nthrow in his lot, if the movement proved successful. At Alessandria\r\nand Genoa, the two chief garrison towns, the society had a\r\nconsiderable strength. The government, though quietly tracking the\r\ncivilian conspirators, seems to have had no suspicion of the army\r\nplot; and had the revolt broken out early in 1833, it would have had\r\nits chance of success at home, though the inevitable disaster must\r\nhave come, when the little army faced the Austrians.\r\n\r\nBut the conspirators waited too long, and late in the spring an\r\naccident led to the discovery of the plot. The government cautiously\r\nfollowed up the clue, till it possessed itself of every detail of the\r\nconspiracy. Then it threw itself on its prey with a savage vengeance,\r\nthat outside the Austrian provinces has had no parallel in Italy since\r\nthe days of Fra Diavolo. Charles Albert, pitiless with fright,\r\nsurrendered himself to the reactionary court party and fed their\r\nthirst for blood. Moral, sometimes physical, torture was inflicted on\r\nthe victims to extort confession of their own or their confederates'\r\nguilt. Jacopo Ruffini, given the choice between execution and the\r\nbetrayal of his friends, committed suicide in prison. Ten soldiers and\r\ntwo civilians were shot; fourteen more only escaped by flight; numbers\r\nwere sent to longer or shorter imprisonment. Italy still execrates\r\nthose courts-martial. Not all Charles Albert's later patriotism has\r\npurged his memory from their indelible shame; and while yet he\r\nreigned, the Genoese erased from their city every record of the brutal\r\ngeneral who was his worst instrument. The humble lawyers and sergeants\r\nwhom he shot, have a deathless homage from their country. \"Ideas ripen\r\nquickly,\" said Mazzini, \"when nourished by the blood of martyrs.\" It\r\nwas the memory of these and other victims of tyranny, that helped to\r\nnerve Italian arms and send Italians to die in the battles that won\r\ntheir country's liberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, since the previous August, Mazzini had been driven into\r\nhiding at Marseilles. The French government decreed his banishment and\r\nbroke up his press. Mazzini eluded both blows. He started a secret\r\npress and got French compositors to work it. He himself found refuge\r\nin the house of a French sympathiser, Démosthène Ollivier, father of\r\nLouis Napoleon's last premier, under whose roof he remained \"a\r\nvoluntary prisoner.\" Twice only in the year he passed its threshold,\r\nand then only at night, disguised as a woman or a _garde national_. It\r\nwas at this time that the French government, whether maliciously or\r\nitself deceived, brought against him a false charge of encouraging\r\nassassination, for repeating which in after years Sir James Graham\r\nwore sackcloth.[5] Mazzini was still at Marseilles, when the news of\r\nthe Genoese executions came; and so terrible was his anguish, for in\r\nJacopo Ruffini he had lost his dearest friend, that his health and\r\nmind nearly broke down. The devotion of a noble woman, whom he\r\nloved,[6] saved him from insanity or death.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of July 1833 he moved to Geneva. He came there to\r\nbe on the spot for a new plan of insurrection. The failure of the army\r\nplot only impelled him more feverishly into his fixed idea of a rising\r\nin Piedmont. He wished no doubt to punish Charles Albert, and well may\r\nhe have been maddened by the savagery, which had sickened Europe. He\r\nwanted to \"moralise\" his party by proving that the terrorism had no\r\nfears for him and striking back at the victorious and brutal enemy. He\r\nthought that, if he was to keep his following together, he must make\r\nhis cast now or never. Once allow the fire to slack down, and it would\r\nbe beyond his power to rekindle it. He believed that half Europe was\r\non the brink of revolution, that a republican movement in Italy would\r\nbe the signal for republican risings in France and Spain and Germany.\r\nIt was probably a fantastic dream; but he had surer ground for\r\nthinking that a revolt would fire the tinder throughout Italy.\r\nExaggerated as his hopes were even here, the revolutionary spirit,\r\nthat Young Italy created, had sunk deep. In the Genovesate and Savoy,\r\nin the Papal States and parts of Naples there was a good deal of\r\nmaterial ready for an insurrection; and Mazzini had assured himself\r\nthat on the appointed day guerilla bands would take to the mountains\r\nin several districts. The chances of success, indeed, were not bright\r\nat the best; but the raid was not quite the unpardonable playing with\r\nbrave lives, that it seems at first sight. Mazzini, taking up a plan\r\nof the Carbonari at Paris, chose Savoy for the starting-point of the\r\ninsurrection. He expected that the troops there would join the\r\ninsurgents, and the revolutionary army would cross the Alps into\r\nPiedmont, while another band would land in the Riviera and rouse the\r\nGenoese country.[7]\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of 1833 several hundred exiles had been enrolled in\r\nSwitzerland. Many of them were Poles and Germans, a few were French;\r\nand Mazzini welcomed assistance, which he hoped might cement an\r\ninternational alliance of democrats, and develop into a \"Young\r\nEurope,\" which would do elsewhere what Young Italy was doing for his\r\nown country. He had the help of several officers, Bianco di San\r\nJorioz, author of a clever book on guerilla warfare, which had much\r\ninfluenced him, and Manfredo Fanti, the future organiser of the\r\nItalian army. They saw the importance of giving the command to an\r\nexperienced officer, and the Savoyard conspirators insisted that the\r\nchoice should fall on a certain General Ramorino, a cosmopolitan\r\nadventurer of Savoyard birth, who had fought under Napoleon, and had\r\nan undistinguished command in the Polish rising of 1831. Mazzini's\r\nslender preparations were completed by October, and about eight\r\nhundred men were armed and ready to march. There were plans of\r\nsimultaneous risings at Genoa and Naples, in the Marches and the\r\nAbruzzi; and Garibaldi enlisted in the Piedmontese navy in the\r\nquixotic hope of bringing it over to the revolution. But what chance\r\nthere was of success was spoilt by Ramorino. He had no real interest\r\nin the expedition; perhaps he was paid by the French government to\r\nwreck it. At all events he lingered at Paris, squandering much of the\r\nwar-fund, that Mazzini had collected with infinite labour. Every week\r\nadded to the difficulties. The foreign governments put pressure on the\r\nSwiss to break up the volunteers. Buonarrotti, suspicious of the whole\r\ndesign, did his best to discredit Mazzini among his own men. When\r\nMazzini at last insisted that the volunteers must wait no longer, the\r\nconspirators in Savoy refused to cooperate unless Ramorino came.\r\nMazzini worked desperately to undo the mischief, and at last, in\r\nJanuary, Ramorino arrived. It was too late. The Swiss authorities\r\nharassed the volunteers, and on February 1 only a small body of the\r\nraiders could gather on the frontier near St Julien. Ramorino marched\r\nthem aimlessly about. Probably he saw from the first how desperate\r\nwere the chances, and wished to spare a useless loss of life. On the\r\n4th, before hardly a shot had been exchanged, he disbanded his men,\r\nand the insurrection was still-born.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] This description was given to, and published by Mr W.

The strain of work and\r\nanxiety might have broken down a stronger man; he had not touched his\r\nbed for a week, and fatigue and cold and the crushing responsibility\r\nbrought on fever. There was a false alarm one night, and a patrol\r\nfired; and Mazzini, hurrying up excitedly with his musket, lost\r\nconsciousness and did not regain it till the volunteers had recrossed\r\nthe frontier. The collapse unstrung him for the time, and perhaps it\r\nwas only the letters of the woman he loved, that kept him from a worse\r\nfate. \"I have moral convulsions,\" he writes to her; \"there are moments\r\nwhen I could roll on the ground and bite myself. I have fits of rage\r\nat every human face and voice.\" When he recovered, he found his\r\nresidence in Switzerland threatened. The foreign governments rained\r\nthreats on the Federal Diet to make it expel the refugees. The Diet\r\nwas easily frightened, but even had it been braver, it could not\r\ntolerate acts contrary to international law, or allow Switzerland to\r\nbe a recruiting ground for raids upon a neighbouring power. The Swiss\r\ncould not be expected to risk foreign complications for the sake of\r\nmen who, from any ordinary standpoint, had abused their hospitality.\r\nAfter what had happened, it was difficult for the raiders to plead at\r\nonce even the traditional right of asylum for political refugees; and\r\nthough after a lapse of time a stronger government would have reverted\r\nto the more generous policy, and though some of the cantons were\r\nrestive at its continued deference to foreign pressure, it is not easy\r\nto blame the Diet, even at a later date, for its unwillingness to\r\nshelter the raiders.\r\n\r\nMany of them were sent at once across the frontier; others succeeded\r\nin hiding themselves. Mazzini was determined not to leave Switzerland.\r\nIt was essential to his plans that he should be near Italy, and he\r\ndreaded moving further from the beloved land. He grew fond of\r\nSwitzerland, and came to \"love the Alps almost as one loves a mother.\"\r\nEngland and America were the only other countries open to him, and he\r\nfeared that if a Tory government came into power in England, he would\r\nfind no shelter even there. \"Besides,\" he said, in words to be\r\nrecanted later, \"there is no sympathy there, no help, no anything.\"\r\nFor nearly three years he led a more or less hunted life--at Lausanne,\r\nat Berne, at Soleure and Bienne and Grenchen, in the house of a\r\nProtestant pastor at Langnau; sometimes hotly sought by the police,\r\nsometimes with the connivance of the government, but generally a\r\nvirtual prisoner in the houses where he found a refuge. For seven\r\nmonths, at one time, he fled from place to place, living in\r\napparently untenanted houses, with mats at the windows, never setting\r\nfoot outside, except in his fugitive removes by night across the\r\nmountains. Exhausted in body and soul, he had to taste an exile's life\r\nin all its bitterness; \"the existence mournful and dull as a stormy\r\nsky or the ashes of a dead fire; the suffering that has no name, that\r\nfinds no vent in tears or words, that has no poetry save for the\r\ndistant sentimentalist; the suffering that makes a man wan and\r\nhollow-cheeked but kills not, that bows but does not break; while the\r\nweary eyes follow the driven clouds, that the wind wafts away to the\r\nskies of fatherland, beyond the everlasting Alps, those icy cherubim\r\nthat guard the gate of the heart's Eden.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little interruption to his desolate solitude. Save for\r\noccasional glimpses, he was parted from his old comrades, except the\r\nRuffinis; and though he found a few sympathetic friends in Switzerland\r\nand caught greedily at their affections, it could not make up for the\r\nloss. He had few books; \"I could well live all my life shut up in one\r\nroom,\" he wrote wearily, \"if I had all my books at hand, but without\r\nbooks, or guitar, or view, it is too much.\" The sedentary life told on\r\nhis health, and he obstinately declined the medicines his mother sent\r\nhim. Toothache wore him down, though sometimes he welcomed it as a\r\ndiversion from his sickness of heart. Money difficulties came, with\r\ntheir sordid complications. His mother sent what she could spare;\r\nfriends helped him with loans. But he could never refuse an exile in\r\nneed, and they importuned him, till even he rebelled against their\r\nexigencies. The organisation of Young Italy--such of it as still was\r\nleft--and expenses of publishing and postage absorbed most of the\r\nrest, for there were few subscribers to the party funds. He denied\r\nhimself all but bare necessities and cigars, even the two small\r\nluxuries he valued--scent and good writing paper. He borrowed what few\r\nbooks he had. He went short of clothes, and sends his mother lean\r\ninventories of his wardrobe, which she and his old nurse did their\r\nbest to replenish. Sometimes he found himself in absolute want, and\r\nwrites \"with a blush on his face\" to the mother who never refused him.\r\nAching fits of home-sickness came on him, \"a physical craving for\r\nhome, for Italian clouds and winds and sea.\" \"The other day,\" he\r\nwrites to a little girl friend, \"I was looking at the Alps in the\r\ndistance--beyond them is my country, my poor country that I love so\r\nmuch, where my father and mother are, and my two sisters, and another\r\nsister who has been dead many years, and the tomb of the best friend\r\nof my youth, who died for liberty, and meadows and hills and beautiful\r\nlakes like your own, and flowers and oranges and a beautiful sky--all\r\nthat one needs to make one die happy, and I thought sadly on it all.\"\r\n\r\nHe had more pungent thoughts to trouble him. The disastrous raid\r\ndemoralised his party. From Italy came news of discouragement and\r\ndesertion. The exiles loaded him with the responsibility of the\r\nfiasco; he found himself the centre of a miserable cross-fire of\r\nrecrimination, and he repaid the criticism with scorn and suspicion.\r\nThe want of response in Italy made him at times very bitter against\r\nhis countrymen. \"Oh, how cold those Italians are, and how they hunt\r\nfor excuses for their apathy. They will not see that they are slaves,\r\nwithout a name, accursed by God, and mocked among the nations.\" The\r\nhuman sweetness in him was half dried up, and a misanthropy, so new\r\nand alien to him, made him querulous and captious. Friends were cold,\r\nor at all events seemed so to his sick mind. He wrote peevishly to the\r\nbest of them; probably he talked more peevishly still. The society,\r\neven of those who were dearest, worried and distressed him, and he\r\npreferred to be left alone with a favourite cat. \"I am inclined to\r\nlove men at a distance,\" he writes; \"contact makes me hate them.\" The\r\nsorest pain, one that obsessed him and dragged him to the abyss, was\r\nthe thought of his suffering friends, suffering because of him, though\r\nfor a cause for which he too had given all. It was the Gethsemane of\r\nevery true-hearted man, who calls his fellows forth to sacrifice and\r\nbattle. The friends of his youth were in exile. Men who had loved him\r\nand whom he had loved, were laying their misery to his charge. The\r\nRuffinis' home was desolate--one son the victim of his own hand, two\r\nmore in exile, the mother, whom of all women he reverenced most,\r\nsitting in loneliness and mourning. Another woman, to whom he had\r\ngiven his love, but to whom a fugitive exile could not give a home,\r\nwas hunted by the Italian police, worn and desperate. \"What gives me\r\npain and very sad moments,\" he writes to his mother, \"is the past and\r\npresent and future of the few beings who love me and whom I really\r\nlove, you, and the Ruffinis, their mother, my sisters, and Her. If I\r\ncould see you all and my few other friends, I will not say happy, for\r\nthat we can never be again, but tranquil, quiet, smiling, and united,\r\nI would die that day with rapture.\" \"I wanted to do good,\" he writes\r\nto a friend, \"but I have always done harm to everybody, and the\r\nthought grows and grows till I think I shall go mad. Sometimes I fancy\r\nI am hated by those I love most.\" Once, at all events, it made him\r\ndoubt of all that he had done. \"I think over it from morning to night,\r\nand ask pardon of my God for having been a conspirator; not that I in\r\nthe least repent the reasons for it, or recant a single one of my\r\nbeliefs, which were, and are, and will be a religion to me, but\r\nbecause I ought to have seen that there are times, when a believer\r\nshould only sacrifice himself to his belief. I have sacrificed\r\neverybody.\"\r\n\r\nThe black misery settled on him. \"I felt alone in the world, except\r\nfor my poor mother, and she too was away and unhappy for my sake, and\r\nI stopped in terror at the void. In that wilderness I met Doubt.\" The\r\nmen whom he had sent to a patriot's death, had they died in vain? Was\r\nit all a frightful error, an empty dream born of ambition and pride of\r\nintellect? Was it for some grandiose, impossible chimera, that he had\r\ntaken men from quiet useful lives and the simple round of kindliness?\r\nWhat authority had he still to preach a creed, which meant the\r\nsacrifice of thousands more, the unhappiness of many another mother?\r\nIn his nightly terrors, in his little lonely room, while the wind\r\nhowled round, he heard Jacopo Ruffini's voice calling to him. He was\r\nof course verging on insanity, and thoughts of suicide passed through\r\nhis mind. His strong moral nature and the influence of two\r\nwomen--Madame Ruffini and one unknown--saved him. Characteristically,\r\nmental health returned in the shape of a philosophy of life. It was\r\nhis theory of Duty, expanded till it penetrated every cranny of the\r\nindividual soul. His old enemy, the utilitarian theory, had taken\r\nsubtle root in his affections. \"I should have thought of them, as of a\r\nblessing from God, to be accepted with thankfulness, not as of\r\nsomething to be expected and exacted as a right and a reward. Instead\r\nof this, I had made them a condition of fulfilling my duties. I had\r\nnot reached the ideal of love, love that has no hope in this life. I\r\nhad worshipped not love but the joys of love.\" And so he put away that\r\nlast infirmity of the true man, took to himself not only toil and\r\ndanger and opprobrium, but unloved solitude of soul, the desert life\r\nof him who has no friend but God. He, who ached for sympathy and love,\r\ntook duty for his hard task-master--duty, \"an arid, bare religion,\r\nwhich does not save my heart a single atom of unhappiness, but still\r\nthe only one that can save me from suicide.\" \"There are four lines of\r\nJuvenal,\" he said, \"that sum up all we ought to ask of God, all that\r\nmade Rome the mistress and the benefactress of the world:--\r\n\r\n     'Pray for the soul, that has no fear of death,\r\n     That holds life's end among kind nature's gifts,\r\n     Brave to endure each pain and labour; nought\r\n     Vexes it, nought it covets.'\"\r\n\r\n\"When a man,\" he writes to a friend, \"has once said to himself in all\r\nseriousness of thought and feeling, I believe in liberty and country\r\nand humanity, he is bound to fight for liberty and country and\r\nhumanity, fight long as life lasts, fight always, fight with every\r\nweapon, face all from death to ridicule, face hatred and contempt,\r\nwork on because it is his duty and for no other reason.\"\r\n\r\nLong indeed before his mental crisis, the light and joy had gone out\r\nof his work. There were times when he felt he had neither strength nor\r\ntime nor capacity for it, when his theories became cold, emotionless\r\nabstractions, far other than the passionate beliefs of other days. God\r\nwas \"a geometrical solution,\" his own task \"a fated mission.\" All life\r\nseemed drab and purposeless. \"There is so much agony in life,\" he\r\nwrites, \"that when I see a baby quiet, smiling, at peace, I can only\r\nwish for death for it.\" Perhaps though such moods were the exception.\r\n\"He is almost always good-tempered and sometimes gay,\" wrote Giovanni\r\nRuffini. Certainly during these three years he wrote some of his\r\nwarmest and humanest pages. At times he was even hopeful of his\r\nimmediate political schemes. He was strong in the sense of his\r\nmission. \"I know,\" he said, \"there is the future in this life of mine,\r\nlittle matter if I see it.\" \"We have made,\" he writes, \"the cause of\r\nthe people our own, we have voluntarily taken on ourselves the sorrows\r\nof all a generation. We have snatched a spark from the Eternal God,\r\nand placed ourselves between Him and the people; we have taken on\r\nourselves the part of the emancipator, and God has accepted us.\"\r\n\r\nAlike in hours of insight and of gloom he remained ever constant to\r\nhis work. His friends advised him to retire. His father threatened,\r\nhis mother entreated. To the latter he \"would have yielded, if he\r\ncould.\" He would gladly have withdrawn, at least he thought so, if\r\nanyone else had come forward to take up the work; but this of course\r\nwas impossible. He would have liked to fall back on the Manzonian\r\npolicy, and devote himself to quiet moral and literary education. But\r\nthis seemed an impossible solution in a country, where there was no\r\nfreedom of speech or writing. The only way, he thought, to rouse his\r\ncountrymen was to give them the example of a life, that no adversity\r\ncould turn back, no want of response dishearten, ever labouring and\r\nsuffering for their sake and the ideal's. There must be no folding of\r\nthe hands, because others were slow to follow.\r\n\r\nHe set himself to think why the revolutions of the last five years had\r\nfailed, why the people, whether in Italy or France or elsewhere, had\r\nbeen so deaf to the call to liberty. He was always asking himself why\r\nit was that Christianity had succeeded, and why a movement, that had\r\nso much in common with it, the movement for the social and political\r\nredemption of the people, had failed. He found his answer in the fact\r\nthat the Revolution had missed the spiritual power, that made\r\nChristianity triumphant. It was the substance of his Marseilles\r\nteaching, but informed with a more mystical, transcendental spirit,\r\ndue no doubt to the apocalyptic results of his depression, and partly\r\ntoo to the influence that Lamennais had over him at this time. The\r\nFrench Revolution had appealed to men's selfish and personal\r\ninterests, their rights, their desire for happiness. It had been a\r\nrebellion against evil, not a mission in search of good. It had had\r\nits use, but now it had done its work. The principle of liberty and\r\nhuman dignity was accepted everywhere in theory, however much\r\nrealisation lagged. The nineteenth century was plagiarising the\r\neighteenth, and following precedents whose day was past. A new\r\nprinciple was needed to carry progress one step further, and that\r\nprinciple must be a spiritual one. \"We fell as a political party, we\r\nmust rise again as a religious party.\" The new revolution must find\r\nits strength in \"the enthusiasm, which alone begets great things\"; it\r\nmust appeal to men's sense of duty, it must bid them work not for\r\nthemselves but for humanity. Then and not till then, the pettiness and\r\nparty feeling and want of earnestness, which had wrecked the movements\r\nof 1831 and his own Italian schemes, would vanish in the light of a\r\ngreat faith, and that same light would be a beacon, which would draw\r\nthe masses after.\r\n\r\nHe was still, in spite of disappointment and the scepticism of his\r\nfriends, convinced that Europe was ripe for revolution, if only one\r\ncountry showed the way. He was equally convinced that Italy would be\r\nthat country. France, he thought, had disqualified herself by her\r\nadherence to the traditions of her Revolution. The strong dislike of\r\nFrance, which marked him all through life, was now especially\r\nprominent, and he declared that popular progress throughout Europe\r\ndepended on emancipation from her political and literary influence.\r\nWhy he appropriated for Italy the revolutionary hegemony, he would\r\nhave found it difficult to give a convincing reason. At bottom,\r\nprobably, with the sublime prophetic confidence that went hand in hand\r\nwith all his searchings of heart and absence of personal ambition, he\r\nclaimed the primacy for his country, because he hoped to inform her\r\nwith his own principles.\r\n\r\nHis Italian programme remained almost unaltered. He was indeed\r\nprepared, though regretfully, to support a royalist movement, if it\r\ndeclared for Italian Unity. But he would not countenance a royalist\r\nprogramme with any lesser goal. He still believed in the Republic,\r\nboth for Italy's own sake and for the example it would give to other\r\ndemocracies. And he still believed in insurrection as the only\r\npossible road to reformation in a country, where there were no\r\nconstitutional liberties to make constitutional progress possible.\r\nGioberti urged to him in vain that unsuccessful insurrections only\r\ndiscouraged the patriots and intensified the oppression. Mazzini,\r\nthough he promised that he would not again encourage an\r\ninsurrectionary movement, unless it started inside the country and\r\nindependently of the exiles, argued that insurrection was the only\r\nmeans to rouse the masses. It mattered little if the first risings\r\nfailed; they would keep alive the spirit, that one day would lead to\r\nvictory. His hopes of the early triumph of the revolution grew slowly\r\nfainter; he began to see that time, perhaps a generation, was needed\r\nto quicken the inertia, that ages of despotism had instilled. But\r\nevery effort brought them nearer to the goal; every slackening made it\r\nmore remote. He would not believe that sacrifice and struggle could go\r\nunrewarded, or quiet waiting spring from ought but cowardice. He\r\nstill, though fitfully--for want of money and the need of secrecy and\r\nhis own deepening gloom hampered him at every turn--went on with his\r\npreparations. The sixth number of _Young Italy_ appeared in July 1834;\r\nthis was its last issue, but he persevered in the thankless work of\r\norganisation, carrying on a voluminous correspondence, raking in\r\nsympathisers from every quarter, sending agents to Italy, who brought\r\nback the same monotonous tale of discouragement and unreadiness.\r\n\r\nHe found time meanwhile to interest himself in Swiss politics, and\r\ntried to organise a party to do for Switzerland, what Young Italy had\r\nbeen doing for his own country. Many of the Swiss naturally resented\r\nthe intrusion of a stranger. Mazzini brushed away the objection,\r\nthough he would perhaps have been the first to criticise a foreigner,\r\nwho had preached to the Italians, as he preached to the Swiss.\r\nSwitzerland, he urged, played so important a part in the European\r\npolity, that no one could be indifferent to its destiny. At this time,\r\ncertainly, Swiss politics offered abundant scope for a reformer. The\r\nFederal Pact of 1815 had undone Napoleon's comparatively liberal\r\nconstitution. The cantons were connected by the loosest of ties; many\r\nof them were governed by small oligarchies; class privileges depressed\r\nthe artisans and peasants. The return of the Jesuits stirred a bitter\r\nreligious struggle, which from time to time threatened to blaze into\r\ncivil war. A vigorous reform movement had indeed recently swept away\r\nthe worst abuses inside some of the cantons; but, nothing had been\r\ndone to strengthen the bonds between them, and the narrow cantonal\r\nlife threatened to smother the country in a \"mud-death.\" It was\r\nimpossible for Switzerland to assert her independence or maintain her\r\ntraditions, when she had no central authority worthy of the name. To\r\nMazzini it meant too the absence of any real national life, the\r\nadhesion to a policy of neutrality, which prevented the one republican\r\nstate of Europe from throwing its weight into the European balance.\r\nMazzini's ideal for Switzerland was to include it with the Tyrol and\r\nSavoy in a federation of republics, and substitute for the settlement\r\nof 1815 a true federal authority, representing and responsible to the\r\nwhole people and not to the separate cantons. He founded a \"Young\r\nSwitzerland\" society, and published a paper, _La Jeune Suisse_, which\r\nappeared twice a week in French and German, till after a year's\r\nexistence (the usual life of Mazzini's journalistic ventures) the Diet\r\nsuppressed it and decreed Mazzini's perpetual banishment. In some of\r\nits articles Mazzini appears at his best,--more tolerant, less\r\ndogmatic and theoretical. The movement does not seem to have found any\r\ngreat measure of success, though it attracted a certain number of the\r\nfiner spirits among the younger men and Protestant clergy. But,\r\nwhatever may have been the immediate fruits of Mazzini's work, at all\r\nevents his ideas triumphed. The Swiss constitution of 1848 embodied\r\ntheir essentials, and it is worth noting that Druey, one of its two\r\ndraughtsmen, was his personal friend.\r\n\r\nItaly and Switzerland together were not enough to occupy his energies.\r\nTwo months after the collapse of the Savoy raid, seventeen of the\r\nexiles, Italians, Germans, Poles, signed a \"pact of Young Europe,\"\r\nwhich was intended to be an alliance on Mazzinian principles of the\r\nrepublicans of the three countries. When one remembers that its vast\r\nscheme of transformation was the work of a few young exiles, it reads\r\nlike pure rhodomontade. Mazzini himself recognised afterwards that the\r\nplan was too embracing to lead to practical results. But at the time\r\nhe seems to have expected a good deal from it. It was to be a kind of\r\n\"college of intellects,\" which would watch and give information on\r\nthe popular and nationalist movements of the Continent, and at the\r\nsame time be an organised propagandism with its machinery of agents\r\n\"and countless other means.\" One thing in particular he hoped from it,\r\nthat it would assist towards \"the emancipation from France,\" and\r\nencourage another country, Italy of course by preference, to initiate\r\nthe new age of religion and the republic. As a matter of fact, nothing\r\nseems to have been done beyond the despatch of a few agents to France\r\nand Spain, and an attempt to organise meetings in England. But it\r\nloomed large in the public eye, and did something to teach democracy\r\nthat its interests are international.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in addition to his political correspondence and journalism,\r\nhe found time for literary writing. It was partly in the vain hope of\r\nearning a little money for himself and his political work. \"I think\r\nover schemes day and night, as every man in want does.\" It was partly\r\ntoo to encourage \"a religious and poetic sentiment\" in Italy, and\r\ncombat the dominant scepticism and materialism. For literary fame he\r\ncared nothing. Friends, who wished him to retire from political work,\r\nadvised him to \"honour Italy with his pen.\" \"Excuse me,\" he answered,\r\n\"but this has no meaning for me. I don't know what or where Italy is.\r\nWe must try to regenerate and create her, and honour her afterwards.\"\r\nHis articles on _Byron and Goethe_ and _The Philosophy of Music_ date\r\nfrom this period. He collected materials for the edition of Foscolo's\r\nworks, which was so near his heart now as at a later time. He wished\r\nto edit a collection of translated dramas, and wrote introductions to\r\nWerner's _Der vierundzwanzigste Februar_ and De Vigny's _Chatterton_.\r\n\"No other critic,\" says a recent Italian writer, \"has written at such\r\nlength or so profoundly on Werner as did Mazzini.\" The essay was\r\npublished later at Brussels with Agostino Ruffini's translation,--the\r\nonly instalment of the projected series. He planned a _Foreign\r\nReview_, to be published at Genoa, but an indiscreet friend betrayed\r\nhis editorship, and the censorship promptly withdrew its sanction.\r\nAnother scheme for a _Review of European Literature_, to be issued in\r\nthe freer air of Lugano, broke down, apparently for want of funds.\r\nAnother venture, which had a brief life, was the _Italiano_, a\r\nliterary and scientific magazine, which appeared at Paris for a few\r\nmonths in 1836, to which he and Tommaseo and some of the best Italian\r\nwriters of the day contributed, and where Guerrazzi published the\r\nfirst chapters of his _Siege of Florence_. Mazzini, who drafted the\r\nprospectus, seems to have been especially anxious to include novels\r\nand poetry. \"It must be remembered,\" he writes, \"that fancy and the\r\naffections make up at least four-fifths of man. Poetry is not the gift\r\nand privilege of a few, the masses are full of a living and speaking\r\npoetry.\" He urged too that women's questions should have adequate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is to this period chiefly that belong the only love-episodes of\r\nMazzini's life. He had a lofty conception of womanhood. \"Love and\r\nrespect woman,\" he once wrote. \"Look to her not only for comfort, but\r\nfor strength and inspiration and the doubling of your intellectual and\r\nmoral powers. Blot out from your mind any idea of superiority; you\r\nhave none. There is no inequality between man and woman; but as often\r\nis the case between two men, only different tendencies and special\r\nvocations. Woman and man are the two notes, without which the human\r\nchord cannot be struck.\" \"Marriage,\" he wrote to a young wife many\r\nyears afterwards, \"is sacred, because it is one of the most potent\r\nmeans of accomplishing life's mission. It gives the almost superhuman\r\nstrength that comes of love, the supreme comfort that makes sacrifice\r\na joy, the dew that tempers the scorching heat upon the flower.\" But\r\n\"now, as a rule,\" he says, \"we do not love. Love, the most holy thing\r\nthat God has given to man, has become a febrile need, a brutish\r\ninstinct; the family is perverted into a denial of all vocation and\r\nsocial duty; male and female have cancelled man and woman.\" He himself\r\nwas a man, not likely to be easily in love. His work absorbed his\r\nvital force, and he had no pity for men who forgot public work in\r\ndomestic happiness. And though his unsoiled purity and gentleness,\r\ntogether with the sympathy that allowed him to understand women as few\r\nmen can do, won him the devotion and affection of many women,\r\nespecially Englishwomen, the sentiment, on his side at least, was,\r\nsave in two cases, one of \"intense friendship\" only.\r\n\r\nHe had two or three boyish passions, one for an English girl who lived\r\nnear his home at Genoa, another for a Genoese, Adele Zoagli, who\r\nafterwards became the mother of the patriot-poet Mameli. When he went\r\ninto exile, the only women who had a place in his heart were his own\r\nmother and Madame Ruffini. His affection for his mother was very\r\nserious and deep, more masculine and less sentimental than in the\r\ncommon course of Italian filial love. Perhaps after his boyhood she\r\ndid not influence him in details, and intellectually there was some\r\nlack of sympathy between them. But her strong pride in him, that made\r\nher \"thank God day and night for having given her that son,\" her faith\r\nin his political, though not in his religious beliefs, the love that\r\nwatched year after year over the son she saw not, the courage that\r\nmade her bear long years of parting rather than ask him to deny his\r\ncall, made the most lasting human inspiration of his life. In time of\r\ndeep trouble a man will turn to his mother and his God, and he looked\r\nto her, as to one whose love would never change, to whom he could pour\r\nout, not indeed his spiritual misery, but all the little material\r\nworries which a man tells only to his mother and his wife, certain\r\nthat her sympathy would never fail. His love for Madame Ruffini was of\r\nanother kind. She was a very noble woman, with intense and unconcealed\r\nsympathies, wise with the experience of age and motherhood and sorrow;\r\nand Mazzini was not the only one in the circle of friends at Genoa,\r\nwho loved her with the reverential affection, that an elderly woman of\r\nsaintly life and understanding will call forth from young men. It was\r\nshe, whose own deep religious faith had saved him in youth from his\r\nshort episode of scepticism. Another woman would have reproached him\r\nwith Jacopo's death; to her the common memory of one so dear only fed\r\nthe affection, that many memories and the same intense religious,\r\nalmost mystical, beliefs had already made so strong. He calls her\r\n\"mother, friend, and all that is more sacred,\" \"the purest, whitest,\r\nholiest soul he had ever met on earth.\" As far as we can tell, it was\r\nfrom no fault of his that their friendship closed afterwards in\r\nmisunderstanding and silence.\r\n\r\nHis devotion to these two women had a deeper and more lasting\r\ninfluence on him than any lover's passion. There was, however, at\r\nleast one other, whom he loved in another way, one to whom he gave his\r\ntroth and whom he would have married, had an exile's life allowed it.\r\nGiuditta Sidoli was the daughter of a noble Lombard family, where she\r\nhad been brought up in a school of patriotism. Her brother, Carlo\r\nBellerio, was a follower of Young Italy, and was banished for his\r\nfaith. She had been married, when a mere girl, to Giovanni Sidoli, a\r\nwealthy Reggian, a patriot and an exile too; and he swore her on his\r\ndeath-bed to be true to the cause to which he had given his life. She\r\nwas one year older than Mazzini, a quiet-moving, gracious woman,\r\nalmost beautiful, with a gentle, blonde Venetian face, warm, golden\r\nhair, and dark, thoughtful eyes; sober and unemotional in her manner,\r\nbut with deep springs of enthusiasm and devotion. Mazzini first met\r\nher, a five years' widow, at Marseilles and afterwards in Switzerland;\r\ntheir liking and common interests soon deepened into love, and he was\r\nengaged to her before he left France. A few months before the Savoy\r\nExpedition, her yearning for her children, who were left at Reggio,\r\ndrove her to Florence in the hope that with or without the\r\nGovernment's consent she might see them. Thanks to the Tuscan police,\r\nwho opened and copied Mazzini's letters to her, we have some fragments\r\nof their correspondence. \"There are words in your letter,\" he writes,\r\n\"which make me still thrill with joy. In these last days I have\r\nlearnt the strength of my love. I have covered your lock with kisses.\r\nOh, that I could sleep for once with my head resting on your knees.\"\r\nTo a common friend he writes, probably a little later, \"I love her\r\nmore than she thinks, much more than she loves me. I dream of her day\r\nand night, and it becomes more and more a fixed idea with me; and yet\r\nI know with absolute certainty I shall never live with her, not even\r\nif Italy were free.\"\r\n\r\nUp to a point they doubtless loved; but, especially when one remembers\r\nMazzini's emotional epistolary style of this time, one is tempted to\r\nquestion whether their love had very much passion in it. It was the\r\ntender, strong affection of two absolutely good and kindred souls, and\r\nwith neighbourhood it might have ripened into more. But long\r\nseparation cooled it, and neither was inconsolable. To Giuditta\r\nprobably at bottom her children were dearer than her lover, and\r\nMazzini felt this. She seems to have made no effort to join him\r\nafterwards in England; she went to Parma to be near her children and\r\nimportune the ducal brute, who forbade her access to them, at last\r\ngoing to Reggio in his despite and apparently seeing them for a\r\nmoment. Mazzini for his part was wrapped up in his work and the\r\nstruggle with exacting poverty. In England he hardly corresponds with\r\nher, partly because his letters might have brought fresh persecution\r\non her, but partly, one is forced to conclude, because there was no\r\nlover's ardour to find out a way. But he still considered himself as\r\nin honour bound to her, and in a sense no doubt he loved her still. He\r\nwrites in the summer of 1838, \"Giuditta loves me, I love her, and have\r\npromised to love her,\" but he speaks as if he feared a rupture rather\r\nfor its effects on her than on himself. Two years later he writes as\r\nif his love were dead. But, if love was dead, friendship, and a very\r\nstrong and true one, remained to the end. It is probable that they\r\nnever ceased entirely to correspond. In the fifties, when she was\r\nliving in the Valle dei Salici, near Turin, a grey-haired woman, with\r\nall the gracious gentleness and culture of her earlier days, Mazzini\r\nwould come to see her in his secret visits to Piedmont, and she was\r\nstill the tolerant but ardent believer in his policy. When she was on\r\nher death-bed, a year before he died himself, he wrote \"as an old\r\nfriend\" to \"one of the best spirits he had ever met.\"\r\n\r\nIn a sense Giuditta had a rival. During his Swiss wanderings, the\r\ndaughter of de Mandrot, a friendly _avocat_ at Lausanne, whom he had\r\nmet casually,[8] became strongly attracted to him. And what was at\r\nfirst a woman's pity and a disciple's adoration, changed to passionate\r\nlove. She was a girl of some sixteen years, of rich, emotional nature\r\nand spiritual yearnings, that echoed to his own. When he went to\r\nLondon, and she saw no more of him and heard of his uncared-for\r\nloneliness, her hopeless love and pity worked on her, till she pined\r\ninto melancholy and illness, and her friends begged him to return and\r\nsave her by his presence. What response he made to her love, it is not\r\neasy to say. If one may judge from the meagre references in his\r\nletters, he felt at first no more than affectionate gratitude for the\r\nrich gift he could not take. But later, as he learnt more of her\r\nconstancy and unhappiness, and his love for Giuditta wore away, and he\r\nached for a woman's loving hand, his affection ripened into something\r\nthat was probably nearer passionate love than anything he felt before\r\nor after. Not that his permanent, reasoning self was disloyal to\r\nGiuditta. \"Am I free?\" he writes to a friend, who would gladly have\r\nseen him and the girl united; \"before society and men, who recognise\r\nonly actual bonds, I am; but before my own heart and God, who watches\r\nover promises, I am not.\" Sometimes indeed he balanced the results to\r\nthe two women, and was tempted for the moment to think that \"the\r\nimperious duty\" of saving the one from death or life-long misery might\r\njustify the breaking of his promise to Giuditta. But he knew that it\r\nwould be a cruel blow to the woman to whom he had pledged himself; he\r\nfelt he would gladly escape from an attachment, which stained his\r\nloyalty to her; and his common sense told him that his gloomy\r\ncompanionship and the privations of an exile's life would never make a\r\nyoung girl permanently happy. And so he never seriously faltered in\r\ncrushing down the rising love within him or trying to crush it out in\r\nher. He steadily declines to admit more than a brother-and-sisterly\r\nrelationship; he prays she may forget him and begs his friends to do\r\ntheir best to kill her love by painting him in his defects; he refuses\r\nto correspond with her, and though at last at the earnest prayer of\r\nher friends he promises to come, if he can find the money, it was only\r\nto save her from the pining that was bringing her to her grave. But\r\nthough he put her aside as a beautiful and impossible dream, he could\r\nnot stop the yearning. \"Do you think,\" he writes, \"that I easily give\r\nup having near me one like her, a creature of God, young, pure,\r\nreligious, enthusiastic, into whose heart I could pour all the world\r\nof feelings and dreams and beliefs and love that is in me?\" He finds\r\nhis comfort in the thought that theirs is \"a mystical, spiritual\r\nunion,\" that she will meet and make him happy in another world. In\r\nthis world he never saw her again, and it seems that her passion soon\r\nfretted her frail life away. Love of wife and love of family were not\r\nfor him, and bitterly he felt it. \"He, who through fatality of\r\ncircumstances,\" he wrote long after, \"cannot live the serene life of\r\nfamily, has a void in his heart, that nothing fills; and I who write\r\nthese pages, well I know it.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] Her niece, Mademoiselle Dora Melegari, tells me that her aunt's\r\nreal name was not Madeleine, as given in the _Lettres Intimes_; what\r\nit was, Mademoiselle Melegari does not at present feel justified in\r\ndisclosing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nLondon\r\n\r\n1837-1843. AETAT 31-38\r\n\r\n     Life in London--Spiritual condition--English friends--The\r\n     Carlyles--Lamennais and George Sand--Literary work--Decay of\r\n     Young Italy--The Italian School at Hatton Garden--Appeal to\r\n     working men.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1837 Mazzini and the Ruffinis came to London. The determining\r\ncause was the inability of the latter to bear the privations of a life\r\nof hiding. They travelled by slow diligence stages through France, the\r\nFrench government, which was only glad to get them out of Switzerland,\r\ngiving them every facility for the journey. In London at all events\r\nthey were free men, able to live under their own names and move where\r\nthey liked, untroubled by the police. But the change from the snows\r\nand sunsets and silences of Switzerland to the squalor and noise of a\r\nback street in London added to Mazzini's desolation. In this \"sunless\r\nand musicless island,\" with the dreary stretches of houses and the\r\nwearing din, he pined for the peace of the Alps, where nature had\r\nbrought him an occasional respite from his heart-ache. \"We have lost,\"\r\nhe writes, \"even the sky, which the veriest wretch on the Continent\r\ncan look at\"; and in time the desolate walls across the street worried\r\nhim, till he would not go to the window. The one thing in London that\r\nappealed to him was the fog. \"When you look up, the eye loses itself\r\nin a reddish, bell-shaped vault, which always gives me, I don't know\r\nwhy, an idea of the phosphorescent light of the Inferno.[9] The whole\r\ncity seems under a kind of spell, and reminds me of the Witches' Scene\r\nin Macbeth or the Brocksberg or the Witch of Endor. The passers-by\r\nlook like ghosts,--one feels almost a ghost oneself.\" The\r\nhalf-glimpses of the buildings, harmonising with their sombre\r\ncolouring, gave him a sense of mystery and indefiniteness, that\r\nredeemed London of \"the positive and finite\" of a Southern town, and\r\nresponded to his growing faith in the poetic and unseen.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks he lived at 24 Goodge Street, Tottenham Court Road,\r\nwith the Ruffinis and two other exiles, who had helped him in the\r\nMarseilles days. In March the quintet moved to 9 George Street, near\r\nthe Euston Road, where they suffered many things from the\r\nmaid-of-all-work, who no doubt did much as she liked with the five\r\ninexperienced males, only two of whom could speak English at all well.\r\nHere they lived for three years, on the whole a very miserable\r\nhousehold. Mazzini himself was \"an angel of kindness and good-temper\r\nand enthusiasm,\" ever ready to sacrifice himself to others' whims and\r\ncomforts. But the unhappy mystic was no cheerful companion, he was\r\nunpractical and dogmatic, probably sometimes peevish, half-lost in the\r\nempyrean of his ideals, beyond the ken or sympathy of the others.\r\nAgostino Ruffini's petty selfishness and ungovernable tongue were the\r\nsource of frequent scenes, which one day brought Mazzini to tears,\r\n\"tears which nothing else could have drawn from him,\" as he writes\r\nplaintively to Agostino's mother. At bottom young Ruffini recognized\r\nMazzini's worth and devotedness, and swore himself on paper to keep\r\nhis temper, with other salutary resolutions, to be read over three\r\ntimes a week; but he was quite incapable of reaching to Mazzini's\r\nmind, and he longed to enjoy himself in a freer life, where the gospel\r\nof duty was never heard. Giovanni was more equable, and knew Mazzini\r\nbetter, but he too had small belief in the gospel, and there was\r\nlittle except old associations and the common love of his mother to\r\nbind him to his transcendental friend. The general irresponsiveness at\r\nhome bitterly hurt and saddened Mazzini. \"I love no one and want to\r\nlove no one,\" he writes of his English surroundings; and in his\r\nletters to his friends in Italy and Switzerland, he returns again and\r\nagain to the lack of sympathy around him, as the heaviest trial of\r\nthose unhappy days.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to distract him from the sordidness of the bickering\r\nhousehold in George Street. He seldom went out of doors, except to the\r\nBritish Museum. He had no money to buy books and complains that nobody\r\nwould lend them. He saw few besides a few exiles, as poor and perhaps\r\nas unhappy as himself. He was \"lost in a vast crowd of strangers, in a\r\ncountry where want, especially in a foreigner, is a reason for a\r\ndistrust, which is often unjust and sometimes cruel.\" In common with\r\nhis companions, he was miserably poor, often living on potatoes or\r\nrice. His father advanced him money to speculate in olive oil;\r\nnaturally he lost it, and after an angry letter from the hard old man,\r\nrefused for several years to accept help from home. He tried to find\r\nemployment as a proof-reader, but in vain. He had an offer of work at\r\nEdinburgh, but the Ruffinis would not leave London, and he felt\r\nhimself tied to them. Literary work came in very slowly, and for a\r\nyear or two his articles in the English reviews brought in little\r\nprofit, when the translator had been paid. The income of the rest of\r\nthe household was not much larger, and the bad house-keepers found\r\nthat in England \"francs were little better than sous.\" Mazzini, as\r\never, could not shut his purse to the needy exiles, who importuned him\r\nand, as Agostino grumbled, \"in the name of this chimera of human\r\nbrotherhood thought they had a right to make themselves at home in his\r\nhouse.\" His few possessions soon found their way to the pawn-shop. He\r\npledged his mother's ring, his watch and books and maps; his cloak\r\nwent to buy cigars, \"the one thing I don't think I can do without.\" On\r\none black Saturday he pawned a pair of boots and an old waistcoat to\r\nfind food for the Sunday. One winter he risked his health by giving\r\naway his only overcoat. His mother, finding that good clothes got sold\r\nat once to buy suits for his friends, thought it better to send\r\nseveral suits of cheaper garments, so that he could keep one at least\r\nfor himself. Sometimes his wardrobe was so depleted, that he had to\r\nstay at home, and could not go to the British Museum to carry on his\r\nliterary work. His generosity was well-known to his better-off\r\nfriends, and it is not surprising that their patience in lending him\r\nmoney was exhausted. He tried a few years later to negotiate a loan on\r\nthe security of yet unwritten manuscripts; but the ingenuous scheme\r\nmet with no better success. Once some friends at Paris lent him £120;\r\nanother by a ruse persuaded him to accept what was practically a\r\ngift;[10] but when towards the end of his first residence in England a\r\nproposal was made at Turin to raise a subscription for him, he\r\nobstinately declined it, partly because, if it reached his mother's\r\nears, she \"would have died of shame.\" There were thus only two roads\r\nopen to him, suicide or the money-lenders. The thought of suicide came\r\nto him again and again, but he put it away as a coward's act and for\r\nhis mother's sake. So more and more he fell into the money-lenders'\r\nhands, borrowing at thirty or forty or sometimes nearly one hundred\r\nper cent. from loan societies, that \"rob the poor man of his last drop\r\nof blood and sometimes his last rags of self-respect.\" Year after year\r\nhe plunged desperately in the morass, and though £320 seems to have\r\nbeen the limit of his indebtedness, it was a crushing sum for one so\r\nutterly destitute. It was the common lot of the exiles, and some of\r\nthem fared worse. In the midst of wealthy London, with men of means\r\nall round them, who shared their political views and made speeches for\r\ntheir cause, Karl Stolzmann, the Polish leader, one of Mazzini's\r\nnearest friends, went sometimes literally without food, and Stanislaus\r\nWorcell, born a rich Polish noble, was saved from a pauper's burial by\r\nan English acquaintance.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from money troubles, Mazzini's external life gradually\r\nbrightened. In 1840, after a short stay at 26 Clarendon Square, not\r\nfar from their George Street house, where happily Agostino left them\r\nfor work in Edinburgh, he and Giovanni moved to 4 York Buildings,\r\nwhich then stood in the angle between King's Road, Chelsea, and Riley\r\nStreet. He came there to be near the Carlyles, and escape from London\r\ngloom and noise and importunate visitors. An Italian artisan, an exile\r\nfrom Perugia, kept house with his English wife, who proved an\r\nexcellent housekeeper and saved them from servant-girl worries. In\r\nthose days there was a hay-field on one side of the house and\r\nmarket-gardens on another, some trees in view \"of a very sombre green,\r\nbut still trees,\" and not far off the Thames, \"equally sombre with its\r\nmuddy dirty-yellow water, but beautiful at night, when its colour is\r\nlost in the dark, and the water shines silver in the moonlight, and\r\nthe barges go down, black, silent, mysterious as ghosts.\" After a year\r\nGiovanni left him after a violent quarrel, and went to Paris. They\r\nwere never really reconciled again, and Giovanni repaid his friend's\r\ndevotion with a coldness and contempt almost as unworthy as his\r\nbrother's, though he did something to atone for it by the sympathetic\r\npicture of his old comrade as the Fantasio of his _Lorenzo Benoni_.\r\n\r\nUncomfortable as his relations with them had been, Mazzini felt the\r\nloss of the Ruffinis. With them or without them, the early years of\r\nhis English life were, if anything, more utterly forlorn and miserable\r\nthan his worst days in Switzerland. His intellect, indeed, was safe\r\nnow, though there are indications still of a mental weariness and\r\nstrain, that bordered on hallucination. There was no longer any fear\r\nof a spiritual collapse, like that which had threatened a year or two\r\nago to wreck his moral faith. But he was more wedded to his misery,\r\nmore desolate, alone in \"the solitude of a damned soul.\" \"A man cannot\r\nlive alone,\" he writes, \"and I have nobody who cares to know what I am\r\nthinking of and what I want.\" His heart sank, when he came home from\r\nthe British Museum to his bare, dark room, where there was no friend\r\nor woman to welcome him, and Agostino's querulous temper to add to the\r\nloneliness of it all. More and more the want of response around him\r\nmade him seal up his thoughts and aspirations. His friends'\r\ningratitude, the desertion of his followers added to the \"terrors\" of\r\nhis spiritual solitude. It seemed to him \"an age of moral dissolution\r\nand unbelief, an age like that in which Christ died.\" The sense of\r\nfailure still lay heavy on him, a brooding, unhealthy feeling that his\r\nwork had been in vain, that it was his doom to bring ill-fortune to\r\nhis friends, that he had sacrificed himself and made no one happier by\r\nit. He felt like \"one irrevocably condemned, though without fault.\"\r\n\"Pray for me,\" he writes to one of his best friends, \"that, before I\r\ndie, I may be good for something.\"\r\n\r\nTwo things saved him from despair, perhaps from suicide. In the crisis\r\nin Switzerland he had put away, once for all, any thought of personal\r\nhappiness. Sometimes still the natural man rebelled. \"Do you think,\"\r\nhe writes of Madeleine, \"that in my hours of desolation I would not,\r\nif I could, seek a breast on which to lay my brow, a loving hand to\r\nplace upon my head.\" But he knew that to look for happiness led\r\nimperceptibly but certainly to selfishness, that \"sacrifice was the\r\none real virtue,\" that duty \"to God, and humanity, and country, and\r\nall men\" was the only law of life for the true man. And what he had\r\nworked out once in cold philosophy, now mellowed into religion,\r\nmystical sometimes, but beautiful and saving. Jacopo Ruffini and his\r\nown dead sister were praying for him, watching over him, inspiring him\r\nwith strength and love. Life was an expiation, to purify the soul for\r\nanother stage, where friends would meet again, and misunderstandings\r\npass, and love reign over all. And even in this world, though sorrow\r\nmight be the portion of the individual man, Humanity, the great\r\ncollective being, would go ever forward to new knowledge, and new\r\nhopes, and nobler rules of life.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, even more than by his faith, he was saved by his intense\r\naffections. True that they centred on ever fewer persons. He had\r\nhardly a real friend left among his old political associates. For the\r\nmen and women, whom he was coming to know in England, he felt as yet\r\ngratitude but little more. His love for Giuditta Sidoli was fading\r\ninto a sincere but unpassionate esteem. Madeleine was an impossible\r\ndream, that he resolutely shook away. But the dear ones of his\r\nboyhood,--Madame Ruffini, his mother, his unmarried sister, even his\r\ndour father,--were loved with an affection that was pitifully, almost\r\nmorbidly sad, but ever more intense. It was the only sunshine in his\r\nclouded life. \"I feel God's power and law more every day,\" he wrote to\r\nMadame Ruffini, \"but He cannot weep with me or fill my soul's void\r\nfor I am a man still and tied to earth. I worship Him more than I love\r\nHim, but you I love.\" And he pours out, in words that read extravagant\r\nbut came in truth from his inmost being, all that reverential love,\r\nwhich he felt for her, who had been more than mother, but whose\r\naffection for her devotee was cooling all too quickly. Agostino did\r\nhis best to damage his friend in her eyes; there seems to have been\r\nfriction between her and Madame Mazzini; and no doubt she sided with\r\nher own sons, when the estrangement with them came. At the beginning\r\nof 1841 Mazzini's correspondence with her appears to have abruptly\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nTo his parents he turned yearningly in a new sorrow, that was bowing\r\nthem down. His one surviving unmarried sister died. She had been his\r\nfavourite, the one of the family who had sympathized most with his\r\npolitical schemes, and encouraged him in his work, and pleaded for him\r\nwith his father. Her death obsessed him with an unhealthy depression;\r\nbut he felt most for his parents, left in the solitude of old age,\r\nbereft of the one who had been a needed link between them, for the\r\nfather had grown morose, and there was evidently some want of harmony\r\nbetween the old people. Then the father himself fell very ill and\r\nrecovered with difficulty. His son brooded over the thought that he\r\nhad not been enough to his parents while he was with them, that the\r\nlife he had chosen for himself had been the cause of all their\r\ntrouble. Plans for their comfort worked in his mind \"like a\r\nnever-resting wheel.\" He would have risked the death-sentence that\r\nstill hung over him, and gone to live with them in hiding, but he knew\r\nthat the dread of discovery would only have added to their cares. It\r\nseems indeed that in 1844 he paid a visit to them in disguise.[11]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe gloom lifted somewhat, as he began to make friends in England. He\r\nwas not yet, it is true, in sympathy with English life. He found\r\nlittle liking here for his transcendentalisms, his big indeterminate\r\ngeneralizations; and English love of facts and suspicion of theories\r\nseemed to him \"materialism incarnate, pure critical analysis,\" fatal\r\nto spiritual or philosophic thought. \"Here,\" he writes, \"everybody is\r\na sectarian or a materialist\"; and now, as always, he never understood\r\nor valued Protestantism. He had a poor opinion of English statesmen,\r\nespecially of the Whigs, who irritated him by the folly of their\r\nattempts to put down Chartism. Nor did he think much better of the\r\nChartist leaders, who were \"Englishmen, which means materialists,\r\nutilitarians, Benthamists _par excellence_, with no principle except\r\nthat of the greatest possible happiness.\" The severance between the\r\nmiddle and working classes portended, he thought, an imminent and\r\nterrible revolution. But he came by degrees to recognize the better\r\nside of English life. He admired its tolerance, its insistency and\r\ntenacity, the \"unity of thought and action, which never rests till it\r\nhas carried each new social idea into practice, and when it has taken\r\na step, never retraces it.\" He watched the Chartist movement\r\nsympathetically, and contrasted its great following with the scanty\r\ndisciples of the French socialists. Though he cared little for its\r\ndoctrines, he saw in it something that rose above \"the narrow egotism,\r\nwhich characterizes English politics,\" and he especially approved,\r\nwhen the Chartists put aside national prejudices and sent their good\r\nwishes to the Canadian rebels.\r\n\r\nGradually he came to feel more at home in England. \"There,\" he says,\r\n\"friendships develop slowly and with difficulty, but nowhere are they\r\nso sincere and lasting.\" \"Never,\" he wrote in after days, \"shall I\r\nforget, never without a throb of gratitude shall I mention the land,\r\nwhich became a kind of second country to me, where I found friendships\r\nthat brought an enduring balm to my weary and unhappy life.\" After a\r\nyear or two his circle widened almost too rapidly, for clothes and bus\r\nfares and the drain upon his time made society an expensive matter to\r\nhim. One of the first English persons who took an interest in him, was\r\nMrs Archibald Fletcher of Edinburgh. A few months after he came to\r\nEngland, she met him, \"a young, slim, dark man of very prepossessing\r\nappearance,\" who could not speak English and wanted admission to a\r\npublic library. So profoundly unhappy he seemed, that the kind old\r\nlady feared suicide and wrote to gently warn him. Mazzini replied that\r\nno one but \"a man, who wished only to enjoy and has made that his\r\nchief thought, will destroy his life as a child does its play-thing.\"\r\n\r\nHis first close English friendship was with the Carlyles. \"They love\r\nme as a brother,\" he wrote in 1840, \"and would like to do me more good\r\nthan it is in their power to do.\" For Carlyle he had for several years\r\na very sincere liking. \"He is good, good, good; and still, I think, in\r\nspite of his great reputation, unhappy.\" He respected Carlyle's\r\nsincerity, his freedom from insular narrowness, his outspokenness. \"He\r\nmay preach the merit of 'holding one's tongue';--to those, in truth,\r\nwho do not agree with him, are such words addressed,--but 'the talent\r\nof silence' is not his.\" He welcomed him as one \"who served the same\r\nGod\" as himself, \"though with a different worship\"; his ally in the\r\nattack on utilitarianism, in the exaltation of the spiritual. \"His\r\nmotive is the love of his fellow-men, a deep and active feeling of\r\nduty, for he believes this to be the mission of man on earth.\" Their\r\ncommon love of Dante, no doubt, too, helped to draw them together. But\r\nin his criticisms of his books he condemned, however gently and\r\nrespectfully, his individualism, his hero-worship, his depreciation of\r\nthe great common march of the race, his ineffectiveness and timidity,\r\nwhen he came to practical political applications. And the antagonism\r\ngrew on him, till in time they seemed to be \"diametrically opposed.\"\r\n\"Why,\" he said long afterwards to a girl, who had been reading and\r\nadmiring Carlyle, \"you are fast drifting down the road to materialism.\r\nYou are lost. Carlyle worships force, I combat it with all my might.\r\nCarlyle is the sceptic of sceptics. He is grand, when he pulls down,\r\nbut incapable of reconstructing something [anything] fresh. If instead\r\nof loving and admiring nations and humanity, you only love, admire,\r\nand reverence individuals, you must end by being an advocate of\r\ndespots.\" Carlyle on his side had little sympathy with Mazzini's\r\nopinions, which to him were \"incredible and (at once tragically and\r\ncomically) impossible in this world.\" He was impatient with his\r\n\"Republicanisms, his 'Progress' and other Rousseau fanaticisms.\"[12]\r\nHe valued him none the less for \"a most valiant, faithful,\r\nconsiderably gifted and noble soul.\" Once the Piedmontese minister\r\nspoke lightly of Mazzini in his presence. \"Sir, you do not know\r\nMazzini at all, not at all, not at all,\" Carlyle angrily replied and\r\nleft the house. At the time of the Bandiera episode, though they had\r\nrecently been quarrelling, he wrote to the _Times_, \"Whatever I may\r\nthink of his practical insight and skill in worldly affairs, I can\r\nwith great freedom testify to all men, that he, if I have ever seen\r\nsuch, is a man of genius and virtue, a man of sterling veracity,\r\nhumanity, and nobleness of mind, one of those rare men, numerable\r\nunfortunately but as units in this world, who are worthy to be called\r\nmartyr souls; who in silence, piously in their daily life, understand\r\nand practise what is meant by that.\" Mazzini, mindful of their late\r\ncoolness, was much touched by the defence. \"That I call noble,\" he\r\nsaid of it to a friend.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs Carlyle Mazzini had a warmer feeling; and she reciprocated it\r\nnot only with an intense personal confidence, but for a time at all\r\nevents by sharing his political beliefs. Gradually she came more to\r\nher husband's view of these; and Mazzini and she had \"warm\r\ndialogues,\" when he unfolded some wild design of throwing away his\r\nlife in Italy. \"Are there not things more important than my head?\" he\r\nasked her. \"Certainly,\" she replied, \"but the man, who has not sense\r\nenough to keep his head on his shoulders till something is to be\r\ngained by parting from it, has not sense enough to manage any\r\nimportant matter.\" But \"to the last,\" says Carlyle, \"she had always an\r\naffection for him\"; in 1846 she came to him for advice on her troubled\r\nmarried life, and he appeals to her to \"send her ghosts and phantoms\r\nback to nothingness\" and make it bearable by communion with her dead\r\nparents and work and love. \"Get up and work. When the Evil One wanted\r\nto tempt Jesus, he led Him into a solitude.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini was a frequent caller at their house; coming in all weathers,\r\n\"his doe-skin boots oozing out water in a manner frightful to behold\"\r\nupon her carpets. Sometimes he would come with any story that he could\r\nthink of to amuse her; sometimes he would discuss Dante with John\r\nCarlyle, who was then writing his translation of the _Divina\r\nCommedia_, till Carlyle grew weary of the talk and reminded both that\r\nthe last bus was starting. Margaret Fuller has left a description of\r\nan evening spent with the trio; how Mazzini turned the conversation\r\n\"to progress and ideal subjects, and Carlyle was fluent in invectives\r\non all our 'rose-water imbecilities,'\" how his flippancy saddened\r\nMazzini, and Mrs Carlyle said to Margaret, \"these are but opinions to\r\nCarlyle, but to Mazzini, who has given his all and helped bring his\r\nfriends to the scaffold in pursuit of such subjects, it is a matter of\r\nlife and death.\" On another occasion Carlyle, after monopolizing the\r\ntalk while he passed in long review the silent great ones of earth,\r\nturned to Mazzini, saying, \"You have not succeeded yet, because you\r\nhave talked too much.\" The contests between them became more frequent\r\nand painful. They would argue, so the tradition has been handed down,\r\nthe one courteous, deeply moved, pleading with his whole heart,\r\neloquent in his rather broken English; the other exaggerative,\r\nsplenetic, scornful in the wild flow of his language. All the time\r\nMazzini would sit pale and quiet in his chair, sometimes excited\r\nalmost to tears, nervously smoking his small cigar; while Carlyle with\r\nhis long clay pipe shifted restlessly, as he stormed out his\r\nsentences.[13] None the less Mazzini's intimacy with them went on\r\nunbroken, at all events as far as Mrs Carlyle was concerned, through\r\nall his first stay in England. When he left for Milan in 1848, he told\r\nher with a kiss to be \"strong and good until he returned\"; and when he\r\ncame back aged and worn, she sadly stroked his grey beard. She found\r\nlodgings for him; she went to comfort him, when prostrated by his\r\nmother's death. But the severance between him and her husband\r\ngradually widened, till two or three years later they completely\r\nparted, to respect each other's character and detest each other's\r\nopinions to the end. Once more they met, years afterwards, and \"talked\r\nin a cordial and sincere way with real emotion on both sides.\"\r\n\"Mazzini,\" Carlyle noted at the time, \"is the most _pious_ living man\r\nI now know.\" Even for his politics he had at last some tolerance. \"The\r\nidealist has conquered,\" he confessed, \"and transformed his utopia\r\ninto a patent and potent reality.\"\r\n\r\nWith the Carlyles, however, even in the days of his closest\r\nacquaintanceship, he was never at home as he came to be in other\r\nEnglish households. His best friends in the forties were the Ashursts\r\nof Muswell Hill. They were, he says, \"a dear, good, holy family, who\r\nsurrounded me with such loving care as sometimes to make me forget I\r\nwas an exile.\" W. H. Ashurst was a solicitor, who had been a friend of\r\nRobert Owen, and who made Mazzini's acquaintance at the time of the\r\nletter-opening episode. To Mrs Ashurst Mazzini, forgetful of Madame\r\nRuffini's expired title, gave the name of \"second mother.\" One\r\ndaughter married James Stansfeld; the other, at this time \"the\r\nfavourite of his English sisters,\" afterwards became Madame Venturi,\r\nand has left the best English memoir of him. Both they and their\r\nbrother for long years after gave him much quiet help in his work.\r\nThrough the Ashursts he came to know the Stansfelds and Peter Taylors,\r\nbut his intimate friendship with them belongs rather to the time of\r\nhis second residence in England. Among his other friends were William\r\nShaen, whom the Italian refugees knew as their _angelo salvatore_,\r\nJoseph Toynbee, the father of Arnold Toynbee, Joseph Cowen, afterwards\r\nmember for Newcastle, and George Jacob Holyoake. J. S. Mill wrote of\r\nhim as \"one of the men he most respected.\" Margaret Fuller, who had\r\ncome to England prepossessed against him, lost her prejudices when she\r\nvisited his school for organ-boys, and began the friendship which was\r\nto be renewed in the days of the Roman Republic. \"She is,\" he writes\r\nof her to a friend, \"one of the rarest of women in her love and\r\nactive sympathy with everything that is great, beautiful, and holy.\"\r\nHe had some intercourse with the two, next to himself, most notable\r\nItalian exiles in London at that time, Gabriel Rossetti and Antonio\r\nPanizzi. Mazzini interested Rossetti in his school, and they had\r\ncommon acquaintances among the exiles; but they never came into close\r\ntouch, and Mazzini tried in vain to persuade him to help in his\r\npatriotic work. At a later date political differences completely\r\nsundered them. Panizzi was already Keeper of Printed Books at the\r\nBritish Museum. He had been a Carbonaro in his Italian days, and he\r\nand Mazzini had common ground in their cult of Dante and Foscolo. He\r\nbacked Mazzini warmly in the incident of the letter-opening a few\r\nyears later; but they disagreed on Italian politics, and they saw\r\nlittle of one another, though they seem to have been never entirely\r\nestranged. Among other foreigners that he met were Prince Napoleon\r\n(\"Plon-Plon\"), then busily conspiring against the Orleanists, and\r\nConneau, afterwards Louis Napoleon's doctor and a general go-between\r\nfor the Emperor and the Italian patriots. But he hated anything that\r\ntasted of fashionable society. The mistress of a famous London salon\r\nonce persuaded him to come to her house, but when he found that she\r\nwanted him to adorn her society and not from any interest in his\r\ncause, he refused to go again.\r\n\r\nHe came at this time much under the influence of Lamennais. They began\r\nto correspond soon after the _Words of a Believer_ were published, and\r\nonce at least they met. Mazzini saw a kindred soul in this \"priest of\r\nthe Church Universal,\" who \"preached God, the people, love, and\r\nliberty\"; this man \"whom I saw but lately,\" so he writes in 1839, \"so\r\nfull of sweetness and love, who weeps like a child at a symphony of\r\nBeethoven, who will give his last franc to the poor, who tends flowers\r\nlike a woman, and steps out of his path rather than crush an ant.\" He\r\nrecognised how much Lamennais' teaching had in common with his own in\r\nits reaction against the sceptical, destructive school of the\r\nRevolution, in its belief in tradition and humanity, in its appeal to\r\nduty as the principle of life. In some degree, perhaps, Lamennais'\r\n_Words of a Believer_ inspired his own _Duties of Man_. He had his own\r\nplans for him. He saw in him \"a Luther of the nineteenth century\"; he\r\nhoped, though not very confidently, that he would come frankly forward\r\nas a teacher of the religion of humanity, and he urged him to \"do\r\nsomething better than write books,\" and become the missionary of the\r\nnew faith. Lamennais replied, that though Christ could preach in the\r\nhighways, four persons could not meet now in a field to speak of God\r\nand humanity without being taken up by a policeman. Mazzini was\r\ngrievously disappointed at the refusal, and he felt that Lamennais\r\nregarded him with some diffidence, as indeed was natural enough. He\r\n\"loved him as a friend and revered him as a saint\"; but he felt that\r\nLamennais returned his love \"as it were in spite of himself.\" \"This\r\ngood Mazzini, one cannot help loving him,\" Lamennais once said in his\r\nhearing; and the phrase left an unhappy sense in Mazzini's mind.\r\n\r\nLamennais and \"George Sand\" were in his judgment \"the two first living\r\nwriters of France\" at this time, and he looked to the latter too as\r\none of his own faith. At the time of his mental crisis in Switzerland\r\nhe read her _Lettres d'un Voyageur_ (he always thought it her best\r\nproduction), and the book was \"sweet to him as is the cradle song to a\r\nweeping child.\" He corresponded with her, and in 1847 visited her in\r\nthe Vallée Noire. She impressed him above all, as she did Matthew\r\nArnold the year before, by her simplicity. \"Madame Sand,\" he wrote\r\nback to England, \"is just as we wanted her to be; good, noble, candid,\r\nsimple, calmly suffering, even more than can be seen in her books.\" He\r\nwarmly defended her in England; not that he thought that all her books\r\nwere to be lightly put into everybody's hand; but \"the evil she has\r\nportrayed is not _her_ evil, it is ours,\" and her realism was informed\r\nby a passionate moral purpose. Genius, he said, can in the long-run do\r\nnothing but good, and it is bound to make itself heard. \"You may sound\r\nyour alarm against her in your old _Quarterly_, and forbid your youth\r\nto read her: you will find some day, without well knowing how, the\r\nbest places in your library usurped by her volumes.\" He saw in her \"an\r\napostle of religious democracy\"; he responded to her sense of the\r\nDivine, her belief that the decay of the old creeds restored\r\nallegiance to the true Godhead, her faith in a future which should be\r\nbuilt on love. He delighted to repeat her words, \"there is but one\r\nvirtue, the eternal sacrifice of self.\" And he saw in her, too, the\r\nvoice of down-trodden womanhood; \"thank God,\" he says, \"she is a\r\nwoman,\" and her books were a revelation of the \"inward life of woman,\"\r\na woman's pleading for justice and equality. At this time few writers\r\nappealed to him more; but her later works and her acceptance of the\r\nEmpire alienated him, and afterwards he \"sadly and unwillingly\"\r\nconvinced himself that what he had hailed as the sincere and conscious\r\n\"utterance of a high priestess,\" was but the artist's passive echo of\r\na faith that was not hers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSlowly, besides making friends, Mazzini began to find work. The\r\ndifficulties were great. He was at first too worn-out and unhappy to\r\ncare to write. He could not yet write in English, and the expenses of\r\ntranslation absorbed a large part of the remuneration. It was a\r\npainful effort to trim his pen to the likings of the English public.\r\n\"My ideas and style frighten them,\" he says. \"What is old to us is new\r\nto them. One cannot talk to them of mission or humanity or progress or\r\nsocialism.\" One editor refused an article in praise of Byron, \"because\r\nByron was an immoral poet.\" Kemble, the editor of the _British and\r\nForeign Review_, politely declined his articles, after some experience\r\nof them, on the ground that the English public were \"conceited asses,\"\r\nwho could only gradually be broken in to listen to generalizations.\r\nMazzini sometimes promised to do his best, but the effort came\r\nunwillingly, and it was only the pressing need of money and his\r\nresolve to ask no more from home, that made him write in an alien\r\nstyle on subjects that often had little interest for him. To an English\r\nreader, however, the discipline appears a salutary one; and his\r\nEnglish articles have a precision of thought that his earlier writings\r\nlacked. His literary out-put was considerable. Some of his articles\r\nwere more or less pot-boiling; thus he wrote on Fra Paolo Sarpi in the\r\n_Westminster Review_, on Victor Hugo and Lamartine--brilliant and\r\nsuggestive essays--in the _British and Foreign Review_, on\r\ncontemporary French literature in the _Monthly Chronicle_. He put more\r\nheart into those on English subjects,--his masterly criticisms of\r\nCarlyle in the _British and Foreign Review_ and the _Monthly\r\nChronicle_, and his papers on Chartism in _Tait's Edinburgh Journal_.\r\nBut what he cared for most was to bring Italy or his own religious\r\nfaith before English readers. He wrote for the love of it, when he\r\ndiscoursed on Dante's Minor Works in the _Foreign Quarterly_ and on\r\nLamennais in the _Monthly Chronicle_, or when he wrote on Italian\r\npolitics for the same magazine, and on recent Italian literature, and\r\nprobably on Italian art, for the _Westminster Review_. In the\r\n_People's Journal_ under John Saunders' editorship he began the\r\n_Thoughts on Democracy in Europe_, which were afterwards expanded into\r\n_I sistemi e la democrazia_,--a very able criticism of the utilitarian\r\nand earlier socialist schools; in his own _Apostolato Popolare_ he\r\nwrote the first six chapters of the noblest of all his writings, _The\r\nDuties of Man_. He seems to have written a novel, which never saw the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nHe found one literary task very near his heart. From the days of his\r\nearly studies at Genoa, he had had a supreme admiration for Ugo\r\nFoscolo, as the one modern Italian writer, besides Alfieri, who had a\r\nvirile political teaching for his countrymen. While in Switzerland, he\r\nhad planned to write his life, and made researches for his manuscripts\r\nand rare and scattered publications. His interest strengthened, now\r\nthat he was living close to where Foscolo's bones lay in Chiswick\r\nchurchyard. He knew that Pickering, one of Foscolo's English\r\npublishers, possessed the manuscript of his unfinished notes on the\r\n_Divina Commedia_, already published, but with many inaccuracies, in\r\n1825; and in a dusty corner of Pickering's shop he found the proof of\r\npart of Foscolo's _Lettera apologetica_, a kind of political\r\ntestament, which apparently had not been published. Mazzini undertook\r\nthe task of getting both re-published with more zeal than candour.\r\nPickering would not sell the _Lettera_ apart from the Dante\r\nmanuscript, and asked £420 for the two. Mazzini \"cursed his bookseller\r\nsoul, and would have stolen them without scruple, if he could.\" A\r\nTuscan lady, Foscolo's _donna gentile_, lent the money for the proofs;\r\nand Rolandi, the Italian publisher in Berners Street, was disposed to\r\nbuy the Dante notes. Mazzini found that the notes were very\r\nincomplete, and feared that Rolandi would not buy, if aware of the\r\ndeficiencies. He concealed the fact, and with immense labour completed\r\nthe notes and the revision of the text. Rolandi, who, it seems, did\r\nnot discover the pious fraud, bought the manuscript, and in 1842\r\npublished the edition in four volumes with an anonymous introduction\r\nby Mazzini, who took no pay for his known and unknown labours. The\r\nedition had its value at the time, though its interest now is\r\nhistorical only. Meanwhile he discovered the remaining manuscript of\r\nthe _Lettera apologetica_ in an old trunkful of Foscolo's papers; and\r\nthanks mainly to his friend, Enrico Mayer, the educationalist, this\r\nand others of Foscolo's political writings were published at Lugano in\r\n1844. Mazzini gave much assistance to Le Monnier, the Florentine\r\npublisher, in the complete edition of Foscolo, which he brought out a\r\nfew years later. But the life remained undone. For years with the true\r\nstudent's fever he hunted up every letter and record of Foscolo, to\r\nwhich he could find a clue. But as time went on, politics and social\r\nwork commanded him again, and the biography, on which so many cares\r\nhad been spent, was never written.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGradually he returned to political work. At first the moral\r\nprostration produced intense lassitude; and he found it as difficult\r\nto settle down to politics as to literature. There were moments indeed\r\nof nervous reaction, when his brain teemed with \"daring projects,\r\ntitanic presentiments, limitless conceptions.\" But generally the\r\nstruggle with depression used up his strength, and he felt too weary\r\nand discouraged to revive Young Italy. He seems, a few months before\r\nhe left Switzerland, to have taken some sort of formal step to\r\nabdicate leadership. But where no actual organization survived, and\r\nthere was no one to step into his place, the retirement meant nothing.\r\nYoung Italy was so completely himself, that the society was\r\nnon-existent, till he took up the reins again. There had been\r\nsomething of a stampede among its members. In Italy many had made\r\ntheir peace with the governments; others were nourishing their faith\r\nin silence; few carried on the work, at least in the old spirit.\r\nConspiracy, it is true, was not quite dead; but the few secret\r\nsocieties, that still lived on, mostly harked back to Carbonaro\r\ntraditions, or turned to an agrarian and free-thinking agitation,\r\nwhich was as hateful to Mazzini as apostacy itself. It was no better\r\namong the exiles. \"There are not two of us,\" he complained, \"who\r\nthink the same on any single subject.\" \"You cannot find one Young\r\nItalian among us.\" Many took advantage of the Lombard and Piedmontese\r\namnesties to return home. Gioberti was attacking the society. Even\r\nthose nearest to Mazzini had little faith in its methods or hopes, and\r\nMazzini would compromise on no tittle of his creed to win them. In his\r\nhigh singleness of purpose he could not understand or tolerate the\r\nfaintness of men, who had sworn to fight for an idea, but deserted at\r\nthe first defeat. If his countrymen had not responded, that was only\r\nan argument for renewed and yet more strenuous effort. It was all so\r\npitiful to him,--this want of faithfulness unto death. \"When I write\r\nin favour of Italy,\" he says, \"I feel myself blush, as if I were\r\nlying.\" For a time, though, he himself felt powerless to act. He was\r\ntempted to go to Italy, and throw away his life in some desperate act\r\nof protest. But he had too fine a nature to be long content with\r\ninaction or despair. \"If you only knew,\" he writes early in 1839, \"how\r\nthis absolute uselessness of existence weighs on me.\" He dreaded dying\r\nwith his work undone. Jacopo Ruffini's memory was ever present with\r\nhim, and he felt that he was dedicated to the cause for which his\r\nprotomartyr had died. He had taken on himself a task \"in the face of\r\nGod and Italy and himself\"; he thought of himself as blasphemer and\r\nhypocrite, if he slackened in it; and though he knew that his\r\nenthusiasm had gone, sometimes too his confidence in Italy and\r\nhimself, yet duty still remained, and he could trust in God and the\r\nrighteousness of his cause. \"I know,\" he wrote, \"that Jacopo is not\r\ndead, that he and we are forerunners, not of a new policy, but of a\r\nnew faith, which we perhaps shall see not, but whose advent no human\r\nforce can stop.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not however till the summer or autumn of 1839,[14] that he\r\ndecided to return to active political work \"with an almost fierce\r\nresolve.\" At first he had no definite plan, except to accentuate the\r\npopular side of his programme and appeal more than he had yet done to\r\nthe working classes. He had at present little means of reaching those\r\nat home, but he could do something among the Italian population in\r\nLondon, the shopkeepers and organ-grinders and hawkers of terra-cotta\r\ncasts. Hitherto he had been little in contact with his working-class\r\ncompatriots; now in the whirl of a foreign city he came to know them.\r\nIt began with his intense feeling for suffering, that for the\r\nremainder of his life made him happiest when relieving individual\r\ncases of misery. About this time, going out one winter morning, he\r\nfound a young girl on the doorstep worn out with cold and hunger. With\r\nthe sympathy for forlorn womanhood, which he had in common with the\r\ngreatest of English statesmen, he took her in and put her in his\r\nlandlady's charge. When the girl afterwards married, and was deserted\r\nby her husband, he undertook the education of her children, and for\r\nmany years devoted to it a large share of his scanty income. The same\r\ncharity now drew him to the waifs of his own land. Talking to the\r\nItalian organ-boys, who went about the streets of London with a\r\nbarrel-organ and its squirrel or white rat, speaking a patois half\r\nComasque half English, he learnt the details of the \"white-slave\r\ntraffic,\" how a few Italians living in London brought over poor\r\npeasant-boys under contracts, which promised high pay and good living,\r\nbut which had no validity in England; how when the boys got there,\r\nthey were beaten and half-starved and cowed. He brought the worst\r\noffenders to justice, and did something to frighten the masters into\r\nbetter treatment of their victims. But he cared more to influence the\r\nboys themselves. In 1841 he opened a school at 5 Hatton Garden\r\n(afterwards removed to 5 Greville Street, Leather Lane), where the\r\nboys came in the late evenings to learn the three Rs and some\r\nelementary science, and on Sundays had lessons in drawing and Italian\r\nhistory. The school was very dear to Mazzini, and the boys, says an\r\nEnglish observer, \"revered him as a god and loved him as a father.\"\r\nOne of them, returning to Italy, travelled to Genoa expressly to tell\r\nMadame Mazzini what her son had done for him. Italian and English\r\nfriends (Joseph Toynbee among them) taught gratuitously, and the\r\nannual supper was a great event for him and his circle. Mario and\r\nGrisi sang at concerts to help the school's finances. The school\r\nflourished in spite of the noisy opposition of a neighbouring Italian\r\npriest,--an opposition, which Mazzini repaid by his first angry attack\r\non the Papacy.\r\n\r\nAlready, before the school was opened, he had started a political\r\nsociety for the Italian workmen in London, and was publishing a paper,\r\nthe _Apostolato Popolare_, which came out at intervals till 1843. In\r\nit he makes his appeal to the working-men of Italy. He felt more\r\nstrongly even than in his Marseilles days that a revolutionary\r\nmovement must depend for its main support on the working classes and\r\nhave their good for its ultimate goal. English life had brought him\r\ninto touch with the social thought of the time, and he felt that\r\npolitical movements were dwarfing beside the question of the condition\r\nof the masses. He began to speak of the Italy to-be as the \"Italy of\r\nthe People.\" It was the people, he wrote, who suffered most from her\r\ndismemberment and misrule. While other classes had their\r\ncompensations, there were no distractions for the unknown poor, no\r\ntrue home life, no intellectual interest. He tried to rouse them from\r\ntheir provincialism, their self-absorbed indifference to politics. He\r\nappealed to them to be patriots and republicans, proud of their\r\ncountry's glorious past, working for its future and their children,\r\nand remember that God would judge them not by what wages they earned\r\nbut by what they had done for their fellows. But however much he laid\r\nstress on the democratic side of his agitation, on working-class\r\norganization and social reform, he was careful to safeguard Young\r\nItaly from becoming a class movement. It was at this time and in his\r\npapers for working men, that he first began the crusade against\r\nsocialism, which he continued, sometimes with less discernment, to the\r\nend of life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] For once his knowledge of Dante seems to have failed him. Many\r\nyears after he quotes the expression to \"Daniel Stern,\" but owns that\r\nhe cannot refer to the verse.\r\n\r\n[10] He subsequently discovered that it was a loan, and insisted on\r\nrepaying it shortly before his death.\r\n\r\n[11] The only evidence for this is contained in Cagnacci, _Giuseppe\r\nMazzini e i fratelli Ruffini_, pp. 287, 290, from which it seems\r\nprobable that Mazzini saw Madame Ruffini between June and November,\r\n1844, and therefore, almost certainly, was at Genoa. Signor Donaver\r\nthinks it doubtful whether _la Cugina_ of the Ruffinis' letters refers\r\nto Mazzini, but the internal evidence seems to me to favour the\r\nidentification. Signor Cagnacci's note on p. 290 seems to imply that\r\nhe has seen a memorandum by Elia Benza to the effect that Benza saw\r\nhim at Porto Maurizio about this time disguised as a Capucin.\r\n\r\n[12] Carlyle's statement (_Reminiscences_, ii. 182) that he \"once or\r\ntwice\" talked with Mazzini is rather startlingly inaccurate. See\r\nCarlyle's _Life in London_, i. 488.\r\n\r\n[13] There are some interesting descriptions of the Carlyles in\r\nGiovanni Ruffini's letters to his mother. See Cagnacci, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[14] Madame Mario says in her _Della vita di Mazzini_, in the middle\r\nof 1838; but I think it is quite clear from _Lettres intimes_, 197 and\r\n205; Giurati, _op. cit._, 11-12; Cagnacci, _op. cit._, 447 that 1839\r\nis the true date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nThe Revolution\r\n\r\n1843-1848. AETAT 37-43\r\n\r\n     Politics in Italy--The Bandieras--The Post-Office\r\n     scandal--The People's International League--Life in\r\n     1845-47--Letter to Pio Nono--Attitude towards the\r\n     royalists--The Revolution of 1848--At Milan.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Mazzini was watching from England in discouragement, and the\r\nwaves seemed to gain no painful inch, in Italy the main came flooding\r\nin. How far exactly the sudden tide of national impulse owed itself to\r\nhis teaching, is perhaps an insoluble problem. But when one remembers\r\nhow wide had been the influence of Young Italy, how many of the men\r\nwho were now coming to the front had been its members, it seems\r\nunlikely that the impetus could have come without him. Young\r\nUniversity men who treasured secretly at home his pamphlets or numbers\r\nof the _Apostolato Popolare_, artisans who had fingermarked his or\r\nGustavo Modena's tracts, were pondering his teaching and waiting for\r\nthe times to ripen. But Mazzini's influence, even if the most\r\npowerful, was not the only one. Traditions still lived on, handed down\r\nfrom the Carbonaro revolutions; the old belief in Charles Albert was\r\nflickering into life again; the mild Catholic nationalism, that came\r\nfrom Manzoni and his school, flowed strong; and all the time the daily\r\nwitness of oppression and misrule was there to preach against the\r\nAustrians and the native tyrants. And though there were many currents\r\nin the swelling crowd of nationalists, at two points all moved\r\ntogether. Austria must go, and there must be some guarantee for good\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn spite of censors and police, the rising spirit showed itself in\r\nliterature. \"The shade of Dante, the poet of the regenerated nation,\r\nbegan to brood above the speech and silence of the land.\" Students, in\r\nthe footsteps of Foscolo and Gabriel Rossetti, drew all the reading\r\nworld of Italy to the great national seer, who more than five\r\ncenturies before had pleaded for unity. Dramatists and historians and\r\nnovel-writers spoke of the ancient glories of their country. Social\r\nreformers came in to swell the liberal movement, founders of schools\r\nand savings banks, agricultural pioneers, builders of railways that\r\nwould \"stitch the boot.\" Their interest in politics was a secondary\r\none, and such political sympathies as they had, were generally with\r\nthe Moderate politicians, just rising to a prominence, which was soon\r\nto eclipse Mazzini's waning light. Gioberti had already published his\r\n_Moral and Civil Primacy of the Italians_, which, while it echoed\r\nMazzini's faith in Italy and Rome, banned democracy and unity,\r\npreached federalism and half-hearted liberalism, and looked for\r\nsalvation to Charles Albert and a reforming Pope. Cesare Balbo in\r\nPiedmont was pleading for the same mild policy, without its faith in\r\nthe Papacy. Theirs was an easy creed beside Mazzini's. They had little\r\nof his religious faith, none of his passionate democracy, his demand\r\nfor sacrifice and martyrdom. It was a creed for the doubting and\r\nhalf-hearted, for the royalist and Catholic, for the courtier and the\r\nrich man and the priest; and also for the level-headed man of the\r\nworld, who turned from Mazzini's fancies and idealism, who laughed at\r\nItaly's mission to humanity but cherished a more modest hope for her\r\nown regeneration. But at all events the teaching had two notes in\r\ncommon with his own. It strove to lift the nation to healthy ambition\r\nand strenuous effort; it cried as earnestly as he did for the\r\nexpulsion of the Austrian. And so it made the complement of his work.\r\nLess noble in its spirit, more halting in its patriotism and\r\nuninspiring of great deeds, yet it marshalled for the cause a host,\r\nthat would never have swelled the thin ranks of Young Italy. It\r\nsupplied the common movement with qualities that Mazzini conspicuously\r\nlacked,--a political sense of the possible, and, among its better\r\nexponents, a patience and tolerance, a comprehensiveness that\r\nprejudged no class and welcomed all, who, gladly or reluctantly,\r\noffered themselves for the great task.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources of the Moderate movement was the impatience at the\r\nlittle insurrections, that only led to useless loss of life and an\r\nembittering of the tyranny. One of its postulates laid down that there\r\nshould be no revolt against the better native princes, and that the\r\nfight with Austria should be waged by regular armies. But the\r\ntraditions of revolt could not die out at once, indeed were all the\r\nstronger for the new spirit of hope that was abroad. All Central Italy\r\nwas alive with plots. Mazzini, though he was coming partially to\r\nrecognize the futility of these petty risings, still had a standard\r\nof preparation that was pitifully inadequate. He was elaborating a\r\nscheme for a rising in the Papal States, to be followed by movements\r\nin the North and South and supported by the exiles. He was still\r\npersuaded that a few small guerilla bands would draw the people after\r\nthem, that daring and a clear programme were the only necessary\r\nconditions of victory. He found few men and less money for his plot.\r\nAmong the handful, who put themselves at his disposal, were two young\r\nVenetian nobles, Attilio and Emilio Bandiera, officers in the Austrian\r\nnavy, which was chiefly manned by Italians and Dalmatians. They were\r\nhigh-minded lads, and, one is bound to add, sentimentalists and prigs,\r\nnaively self-conscious and immature; but with the supreme virtue that\r\nthey were ready to take their lives in their hands. Mazzini wished to\r\nuse them for his designs in Central Italy; but there were police\r\nagents of the governments around them, who had their ear and sent them\r\nwith a handful of followers, including a man in the pay of the police,\r\nto help an imaginary rising in Calabria. The English government, too,\r\nhad opened their correspondence with Mazzini, and put the government\r\nat Naples on its guard. Thus they went, as they foreboded, to their\r\ndeath. The trap was ready for them; and when they landed near Cosenza,\r\nthey were captured easily and shot.\r\n\r\nThe ignoble action of the English government brought Mazzini into\r\nEnglish political life. He suspected that his correspondence had been\r\ntampered with in the post, and careful experiments proved to him that\r\nhis letters had been opened, sealed with new wafers, and the postmark\r\naltered. He put the matter into the hands of Thomas Duncombe, the\r\nmember for Finsbury; and the storm of indignation, that followed\r\nDuncombe's disclosures in the House of Commons, showed how angrily the\r\nbetter English opinion felt it, that the government had violated\r\nelementary ethics and \"played the spy\" in the interests of continental\r\ntyranny. Shiel and Macaulay denounced it in parliament. Carlyle wrote\r\nto the _Times_ that \"it is a question vital to us that sealed letters\r\nin an English post-office be, as we all fancied they were, respected\r\nas things sacred; that opening of men's letters, a practice near of\r\nkin to picking men's pockets, and to other still viler and far fataler\r\nforms of scoundrelism, be not resorted to except in cases of very last\r\nextremity.\" The government tried to ride out the storm with quibbles\r\nand constructive falsehoods, which proved, as Mazzini said, that they\r\nadopted different standards of honour for their public and their\r\nprivate lives. Sir James Graham repeated the stale charge that Mazzini\r\nhad promoted assassination in France, and honourably withdrew it, when\r\nhe knew the facts. But public feeling was too heated to let the matter\r\nrest there; and secret Committees of enquiry were appointed by both\r\nHouses. They reported that letters had been constantly opened at the\r\nPost-Office, at all events since 1806; that even letters of members of\r\nparliament had been tampered with; that in this case the government\r\nhad issued a warrant to open Mazzini's letters (his letters had in\r\nfact been opened several months before the date of the warrant), and\r\nhad sent information extracted from them to \"a Foreign Power.\" It is\r\ntrue that this information seems to have been of a general character,\r\nbut that did not affect the ignominy of the whole business or the fact\r\nthat an English government had sent a warning to the Bourbons, that\r\nhelped them to entrap the hapless patriots.\r\n\r\nThe incident gave Mazzini a welcome opportunity to appeal more\r\ndirectly to English opinion on behalf of Italy. He had a supreme\r\ncontempt for English foreign policy, which \"opposes everything that\r\nintroduces a new fact in the European polity, and is the first to\r\nrecognize it when it shows its strength.\" It was an unfair criticism,\r\nat least of Canning and Palmerston, tied though the latter's hands\r\nwere by court and colleagues. England was still on the whole the\r\nchampion of the cause of men. But it was true that the Foreign Office\r\ngave small attention to the great nationalist movements that were\r\nmaturing in Europe. The wise policy for England, as he urged, was to\r\nencourage these movements, and win the gratitude of the rising\r\nnationalities, not necessarily by armed intervention (he expressly\r\ndisclaimed asking for that), but by her moral backing. Perhaps it was\r\npartly owing to the seeds he sowed at this time, that Palmerston\r\nafterwards did for Italy so much of what he asked for. We may regret\r\nthat he never gave a generous recognition to the great Foreign\r\nSecretary's policy.\r\n\r\nOn individual Englishmen and Americans he knew that he could count for\r\npractical sympathy. He exploited well both the anti-Papal feeling in\r\nthe country and the old love of Italian liberty, which had descended\r\nfrom the days of Byron and Hobhouse. English and American travellers\r\ncarried his secret letters and literature into Italy. He had plans\r\nfor utilizing the Christian Alliance, an American society for\r\nProtestant propagandism. A year or two later he induced his English\r\nwomen-friends to organize an Italian bazaar, which was held at Mrs\r\nMilner-Gibson's, nominally for the expenses of his Italian school, but\r\nwith the secret intention of devoting any surplus from the Italian\r\ncontributions to a National Fund, which he was trying to raise for\r\npolitical work. In the same year, 1847, he founded a People's\r\nInternational League to resume the interrupted work of Young Europe,\r\nbut mainly with the object of enlisting sympathy for Italy. Stansfeld,\r\nthe Ashursts, Peter Taylor, W. Shaen, Thomas Cooper, Henry Vincent the\r\nChartist, W. J. Fox (the Unitarian orator, afterwards M.P. for\r\nOldham), served on the Committee. They used to meet once a week at Mr\r\nW. J. Linton's house in Hatton Garden, and Mazzini \"with those\r\nwondrous eyes of his lit up with a power that was almost\r\noverwhelming,\" infected them with his own enthusiasm and faith. Men\r\namong them, like Thomas Cooper and Peter Taylor, who had denounced\r\nphysical force remedies in England, demurred at his gospel of\r\nrevolution. \"You are right about your own country,\" he passionately\r\nanswered. \"You have had your grand decisive struggle against tyrannous\r\npower. You need no physical force. But what are my countrymen to do,\r\nwho are trodden down under the iron heel of a foreign tyranny? They\r\nhave no representation, they have no charters, they have no written\r\nrights. They must fight.\"\r\n\r\nThe business of the League brought one of the very few occasions, on\r\nwhich, so far as is known, he expressed his views on Ireland. Some\r\nRepealers complained to the League that it had omitted Ireland in its\r\nreport from the list of the nationalities of the future; and Mazzini\r\nwas asked to draft an answer to them. His argument was addressed to\r\nSeparatists, but it would apply almost equally to Home Rulers; it\r\nproves how radically he misunderstood the Irish movement, and he seems\r\nto have felt himself on unsafe ground. He regarded the Irish demand as\r\nat bottom one for better government only; and he had every sympathy\r\nwith their \"just consciousness of human dignity, claiming its long\r\nviolated rights,\" their \"wish to have rulers, educators, not masters,\"\r\ntheir protests against \"legislation grounded on distrust and\r\nhostility.\" But he believed that the nationalist movement was not\r\nlikely to be permanent, and he refused to see any elements of true\r\nnationality in it, on the grounds that the Irish did not \"plead for\r\nany distinct principle of life or system of legislation, derived from\r\nnative peculiarities, and contrasting radically with English wants and\r\nwishes,\" nor claimed for their country any \"high special function\" to\r\ndischarge in the interests of humanity. On which it may be noted that\r\nthe first objection shows Mazzini's ill-acquaintance with Irish life\r\nand feeling, and that the second involves a condition, which, save in\r\nhis own theories, has not been asked of any nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn place of the enforced idleness of a few years before, he was now\r\nonly too busy. Political correspondence, literary work, the school,\r\nthe bazaar, visiting and being visited crowded on his time. He hardly\r\nleft London, except for two visits to France and one perhaps to\r\nItaly, and once for a pilgrimage to Newstead Abbey and other places of\r\nByronic memory. He had left Chelsea, and moved first to Devonshire\r\nStreet, near the British Museum, and afterwards to Cropley Street,\r\nnear the New North Road. He was somewhat happier and more hopeful. His\r\nactive life left little time for the old broodings. The Post-Office\r\nscandal had brought him new friends, and the desolation of his\r\nsolitude had gone. He joined the Whittington Club, largely for the\r\nsake of playing chess, at which he was an adept and did not like being\r\nbeaten. He was much perturbed by a proposal to allow no chess on\r\nSundays, and jokingly threatens a rider that smoking too shall be\r\nforbidden, except to those who undertake to sit silent for an hour in\r\nreligious contemplation, and that, as further penance for the members,\r\none of them shall \"read twelve minutes every hour _alta voce e con\r\ndeclamazione_ a parliamentary speech from Mr Plumpton or Sir Robert\r\nInglis or a chapter from the second volume of Tancred by D'Israeli.\"\r\nBut when back in his lodgings, he was often depressed and miserable\r\nagain. He was \"giddy\" with writing, worn down with work and want of\r\nproper food and clothes; and for the first time he writes in bad\r\nspirits about his physical condition. The burden of poverty and debt\r\nstill \"dominated his life.\" He was now in receipt of a small allowance\r\nfrom his mother, to find which she stinted herself of every luxury and\r\nmore. But he was generous as ever, and probably as bad a housekeeper;\r\nand he found himself powerless to reduce the mountain of debt. His\r\nliterary earnings were again very small. The life of Foscolo was still\r\nwaiting to be begun, for he thought it better now \"to supply new\r\nmaterials for Italian history than make an inventory of the old.\" The\r\nbetter-paying reviews no longer took his articles, and he was \"writing\r\non Switzerland and heaven knows what for a petty Edinburgh magazine.\"\r\nHe fretted because the need of hack-work and his multifarious\r\noccupations left little time for writings that would help the cause,\r\nas they had helped it fifteen years ago. \"For the wretched sum of some\r\n8000 francs,\" he writes, \"I am a slave; I am growing old in body, in\r\nsoul, in power, and I am not allowed to help my country and fulfil my\r\nmission.\" And from causes that we can only guess at,--perhaps the\r\nworry and publicity, perhaps the partial lifting of his unhappiness,\r\nperhaps the loss of physical health,--there is a perceptible, though\r\nslight decline from the moral height of a few years before. He is less\r\nthe apostle, more the politician, too fond of coming forward as the\r\npractical man--a part that ill became him,--not always straightforward\r\nin his utterances and methods, more reasonable, it is true, and\r\ntolerant, but at the same time sliding into occasional reticences and\r\nequivocation.\r\n\r\nThe result of the Bandiera episode was to leave Young Italy yet more\r\nfriendless than before. Its miserable mismanagement was set down to\r\nMazzini, unfairly on the whole; and cruel slanders charged him with\r\negging others to a desperate task, while he stayed safe behind. In\r\nreality, he was more impatient than ever to lead a fight in Italy\r\n\"before he grew quite old.\" But he seems again to have recognized that\r\nany fruitful action was impossible. All his efforts for the National\r\nFund brought in a poor £100. And he knew that he was losing his hold\r\non the middle classes, and must wait till he had formed a party among\r\nthe working men of the towns. The Rimini revolt of 1845, its poor\r\nprogramme of local reform and silence on the bigger issues, proved\r\nwhat influence the Moderate movement in its worst and weakest form had\r\neven in those parts of Italy, from which he had hoped most. A year\r\nlater the Moderates leaped into overwhelming prominence with the\r\naccession of Pio Nono to the Papacy. Here was a Pope, the Italians\r\nfondly thought, eager to bless Liberals and Nationalists, while\r\nCharles Albert in the North was threatening to bare his sword for war.\r\nThe mass of Italian Liberalism caught at their protection, and was\r\nready to pay the price. Some no doubt hoped to push on the King, till\r\nhe was \"moral,\" if not actual \"lord of Italy\"; others dreamed that\r\ncircumstances might make Pius president of an Italian Republic. But\r\nthe majority willingly accepted the limitations of the policy, were\r\nready to safeguard the Temporal Power, to make Italian union no better\r\nthan a loose federation, to stop short at administrative reform or at\r\nthe most at middle-class constitutions.\r\n\r\nMazzini was very suspicious of the new development; jealous that the\r\nnationalist movement had passed into other hands, that the credit of\r\nit went to men like Gioberti, who had halted in their faith, while he\r\nalone had held the banner high; sceptical of Charles Albert's and the\r\nPope's intentions; angry at the tentative, compromising ambitions of\r\nthe Moderates, at their repudiation of democracy, their trust in\r\ndiplomacy and its pretences and deceptions. He knew Charles Albert's\r\n\"rabbit-nature\"; he judged Pio Nono much at his own estimate. \"They\r\nwant,\" said the Pope, \"to make a Napoleon of me, who am only a poor\r\ncountry parson.\" \"An honest parson but a bad prince,\" was Mazzini's\r\nverdict. The triumph of the Moderates meant that Unity would be put\r\nindefinitely back, and federalism inflict \"perpetual impotence\" on\r\nItaly. But he saw the impossibility of standing out against the new\r\nspirit. And he was prepared, as he had been in 1833 and again in 1844,\r\nto waive his republican agitation, if the Moderates for their part\r\nwould abandon federalism and declare for unity. \"If I thought,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that Charles Albert would rise to rare ambition and unite Italy\r\nfor his own behoof, I would say Amen.\" \"Let the Moderates,\" he wrote,\r\n\"give us, if they like, a Pope, a single king, a dictator; we can\r\ncompromise on everything but federalism.\" And on these lines he was\r\nworking through 1847 to bring the exiles at Paris together on a common\r\nprogramme of Unity, to which both monarchists and republicans could\r\nrally.\r\n\r\nIt was in this spirit that in September of the same year he wrote his\r\nfamous letter to the Pope. As with the parallel letter to Charles\r\nAlbert, he was anxious afterwards to explain away in part its implied\r\nbelief in the Pope's patriotism and its anxiety to see him leader of\r\nthe Italian movement. But his private letters of the time would seem\r\nto show that this was an afterthought, and that he was sincerer than\r\nhe gave himself credit for. In one of them, written apparently just\r\nbefore the letter to Pius, he says in somewhat Carlylean style, \"I\r\nconsider this as the last agony of popedom authority. And in my own\r\nway of feeling I would not be sorry to see a great institution dying,\r\nfor once, in a noble manner; transmitting the watchword of the future\r\nbefore vanishing, rather than sinking into the Crockford or Tuileries\r\nmud of the English aristocracy and French monarchy. A moral power,\r\nlike a great man, ought always to die so; uttering the words of dying\r\nGoethe, 'let more light in.'\" In another letter, written in the same\r\nmonth, he says that he wrote to the Pope \"in a moment of expansiveness\r\nand juvenile illusion,\" as he would have written to his friend\r\nhimself. He was excited and sanguine at the great European drama, that\r\nwas developing so fast. He still probably had moments, when the old\r\nfaith in men broke through his later suspicion and exclusiveness. He\r\nwas ever looking for a new religion to issue forth from Rome,[15] and\r\nfor the moment dreamed that a nationalist Pope might be its herald.\r\nHis appeal, however, was ludicrous in its miscalculation of the facts.\r\n\"Be a believer,\" he said to Pius, \"and unite Italy.\" He told him that\r\nhe, the foremost man of the moment in Europe, had duties of\r\ncorresponding magnitude. He could guide Italy to her appointed future,\r\nmake of her one great state, based on the people and justice and\r\nreligion, with \"a government unique in Europe, which would end the\r\nabsurd divorce between the spiritual and temporal powers.\" If\r\nCatholicism were capable of revival, he under God might be the\r\ninstrument; if it were destined to give place to a new creed, based on\r\nthe same Christian principles, he could be the leader, who would guide\r\nthe Church securely through its passage. One can imagine the horror\r\nwith which Pius read the part so tactlessly suggested to him; and we\r\nknow that the only result of the letter was to thoroughly alarm him.\r\n\r\nIn fact Mazzini's fits of belief in Pope or King were very transitory.\r\nOnly five months before he had written in an open letter, that he \"did\r\nnot believe that from prince or king or pope Italy would now or ever\r\nfind salvation.\" His mind was in a state of flux, wavering between his\r\nold simple, but for the time impracticable, creed and some compromise\r\nwith the new order. It would read him wrongly, if we charged him with\r\ndownright insincerity; but his whole conduct through this period is a\r\ndisingenuous one, too subordinate to unavowed intentions, too much\r\nakin to that \"substitution of Macchiavelli for Dante,\" which he\r\ncondemned so unsparingly in the Moderates. While professedly ready to\r\nwork with the monarchical nationalists, while abstaining from any\r\nactive republican agitation, he was encouraging republican beliefs,\r\nanxious even to keep something together of a republican organization,\r\nthat when \"the Moderate farce was hissed off the stage,\" the\r\nrepublicans would be again in a position to captain the nationalist\r\ncause and lead it to their own goal. He wants to spread the literature\r\nof Young Italy broadcast. He urges that his followers, while nominally\r\njoining the Moderate ranks and \"shouting for Pio Nono louder than the\r\nrest,\" should quietly prepare to seize the movement for themselves. At\r\nthe same time, outside Italy they were to depreciate the Pope with\r\nequal vehemency, that when the inevitable disillusioning in Pius came,\r\nthey could put in a claim to foresight. Apart from this underhand\r\ndiplomacy, his hesitation was largely justified. He had no security\r\nthat the Moderates would accept the offered compromise or declare for\r\nUnity. And he feared that the enthusiasm of the masses might\r\nevaporate in noisy demonstrations, that reform would prove an opiate\r\nto lull the nationalist impulses to sleep again. Towards the end of\r\n1847 his chief anxiety, as Cavour's was for different reasons twelve\r\nyears later, was to irritate Austria into taking the offensive, and\r\nforce the Italians to fight for independence. He was confident that\r\nshe would intervene. Sometimes he hoped that the popular pressure\r\nbehind would force Charles Albert to head the national defence; at\r\nother moments he welcomed the thought that the native governments\r\nwould decline the challenge, and Young Italy be left alone to lead the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nFor once he underrated the strength of the nationalist feeling. The\r\nnew year opened with revolutions in dramatic sequence. Its first day\r\nsaw the Tobacco Riots at Milan,--the overture to the maturing Lombard\r\nrising. Two days later the social revolution mildly reared its head at\r\nLeghorn, and Mazzini's old collaborator, Guerrazzi, was master for a\r\nfew days of the insurgent city. In another fortnight Sicily, with one\r\ngreat effort, threw off the Bourbon yoke; and before the month was\r\nout, the Neapolitans had forced a constitution on King Ferdinand. In\r\nthe first half of February Tuscany and Piedmont had their\r\nconstitutions too; in a few days more the Second Republic was\r\nproclaimed in France, and the face of European politics was changed.\r\nPio Nono, ever more fearful of liberalism, but carried helplessly\r\nalong, gave the Romans a constitution; and, save in the Austrian\r\nprovinces and dependant Duchies, all Italy had won its liberties. War\r\nwith Austria was now only a question of weeks, and the nation waited\r\nbreathlessly till the signal came from Milan or Turin. Charles Albert\r\nwas still the \"Wobbling King,\" drifting towards war, thirsting for\r\nnational applause and revenge on Austria, but timorous of the\r\ndemocratic forces that pushed on behind, dreading republican France as\r\nmuch as the real enemy across the Ticino.\r\n\r\nWhile he paused, the great uprising came. The news of revolution at\r\nVienna passed the signal through the North. The heroic Milanese after\r\nfive days of memorable struggle drove the great garrison out in\r\nflight. Venice, Bergamo, Brescia, Como, well-nigh every city in the\r\nLombard and Venetian lands, fought for and won their liberty. The\r\nAustrian power crumbled in a week, and save at Ferrara and the\r\nfortresses of the Quadrilateral,--themselves too all but lost,--no\r\nfoot of Italian ground remained to Austria. From all Italy the forces\r\nof the nation were hurrying to complete the work. Piedmont and Tuscany\r\ndeclared war. The Pope and King of Naples let perforce their troops\r\nmarch to the front. From town and village, from plain and mountain\r\nvalley the volunteers poured up. Princes and statesmen, clergy and\r\nnobles, students and artisans,--all were swept along by the great\r\nflood of patriotism, some lightly or with purpose to betray, but the\r\nmass with the enthusiasm of crusaders, glad, for the day at all\r\nevents, to give up comfort and home and life. It seemed as if\r\nMazzini's vision were fulfilled, and Italy, transfigured by a holy\r\ncall, had risen in unconquerable might.\r\n\r\nMazzini hurried to Italy at the glad tidings. He was already in\r\nParis, where he had gone again directly after the Revolution, and had\r\njust founded a National Association to carry out his policy of\r\nbringing royalist and republican exiles together in the cause of\r\nindependence and unity. He crossed the St Gotthard with some danger.\r\n\"The scene,\" he wrote back to England, \"was sublime, Godlike. No one\r\nknows what poetry is, who has not found himself there, at the highest\r\npoint of the route, on the plateau, surrounded by the peaks of the\r\nAlps in the everlasting silence that speaks of God. There is no\r\natheism possible on the Alps.\" He stopped to pick the first pansy he\r\nsaw, when he left the snows, to send it to an English friend. He\r\nreached Milan on April 7. He could not go to Piedmont or Genoa, for\r\nthe sentence of 1833 still hung over him, and, besides, Milan was the\r\ncentre of everything at the moment. But the scene of the Five Days did\r\nnot bring the sense of exultation he had expected. \"As for Italy,\" he\r\nwrites, \"I have grown old, and seem only too much to bear the chains\r\nof exile with me.\" But he \"cried like a child\" with enthusiasm, when\r\nhe saw two thousand Italians, who had deserted from an Austrian\r\nregiment, march through the shouting crowd; and the reception he found\r\nmust soon have cheered him. The very customs-officers on the frontier\r\nhad known him from his portraits, and repeated his phrases to him. A\r\nprocession met him at the gates of Milan, and took him in triumph to\r\nhis hotel. His position was in fact a very strong one. He stood before\r\nhis countrymen as the prophet once cast out and stoned, who had\r\npreached in the wilderness, what was now a commonplace on every\r\ntongue. His beliefs of yesterday--utopias to other men--were potent\r\nfacts to-day. Italy was free or nearly so. Throughout the land\r\ndemocracy seemed on the eve of triumph. Even the republicans and\r\nunitarians had shown an unexpected strength. And he, who through long\r\nyears had preached and suffered, while others fell away or doubted,\r\nhad the grateful homage of his countrymen. At this time, probably, his\r\nword was law at Milan.\r\n\r\nIt remained to be seen if he had the talent for actual political life,\r\nwhether he could put away accumulated prejudices, see clear to the\r\nsupreme and indispensable end, and waive all secondary things for\r\nthat. His professed position was a sound one. While the war lasted, so\r\nhe laid down, there must--apart from the postulate of Unity--be a\r\ntruce to party struggles. Monarchy or republic must await the decision\r\nof the liberated and united nation; and meanwhile the whole strength\r\nof the country must be given to the war. His earlier actions were true\r\nto this programme. He supported the Provisional Government, and\r\ndiscouraged the extremer republicans. Probably, as he hinted later, he\r\nwas half inclined at first to believe that Charles Albert was the\r\nfittest instrument for the deliverance of Italy. And though he soon\r\nabandoned any hope in the King, he repeated to the end that, while the\r\nwar lasted, there should be no republican agitation.\r\n\r\nSo far as the war itself was concerned, he did his best in the one way\r\nopen to him, the encouragement of the volunteers. He exaggerated their\r\nmilitary value, just as he had always exaggerated the possibilities\r\nof guerilla fighting in Italy. But his advice that every available man\r\nshould be thrown on the enemy's communications in Venetia was better\r\nstrategy and patriotism than the poor jealousies, that made the\r\nregular army and the politicians depreciate the volunteers from fear\r\nlest their influence should be cast for a republic. In a fight, where\r\nthe Italians had no single commander of genius, the Moderates had the\r\nfolly to reject the services of men, like Garibaldi and Fanti, who\r\ntwelve years later were the first generals in Italy. But, sincerely as\r\nMazzini tried to help the war, he was not equally loyal to his\r\nprofessions of political neutrality. His refusal to let unity remain\r\nan open question deprived them at once of any seriousness. Even his\r\nostensible attitude towards the monarchy was no doubt in part a matter\r\nmore of necessity than principle. He seems to have gone to Milan\r\nundecided what exact policy to adopt; and as soon as he arrived there,\r\nhe wrote that he was occupied in organizing the republicans, and that,\r\nshould Charles Albert fail to gain a speedy and brilliant victory, he\r\nhad hopes of success for them. But he soon realized that a republican\r\nagitation meant, if not civil war, at all events a fierce dissension\r\nin the face of the enemy, a dissension on no point of vital principle\r\nor honour,--which would have shamed its author. And, though the\r\nrepublicans were strong at Milan, they were perhaps a minority even\r\nthere, and in the rest of Lombardy a handful, while Piedmont and its\r\narmy stood solid in their loyalty to the King. And so, whether from\r\nchoice or from necessity, he stood in the letter by his promise to\r\nabstain from republican agitation. But the policy of neutrality sat\r\nuneasily on him, and he soon broke from the spirit of his undertaking\r\nby loud professions of republican faith and suggestions quite\r\ninconsistent with the silence he was pledged to.\r\n\r\nTo some extent the policy of the Provisional Government excused his\r\nchange of attitude. At the beginning of the war everybody had accepted\r\nthe position, that there should be a truce to politics till the\r\nfighting was over. But as the war dragged on, the position became a\r\nhardly possible one. The government of Lombardy was hopelessly\r\nincapable, and everybody wished to see it superseded. The\r\nconservatives both at Milan and Turin feared to leave an opening for a\r\npossible Lombard republic after the war. Many of the democrats wished\r\nfor annexation as a step to Unity. The agitation for \"fusion\" with\r\nPiedmont grew so strong, that the government, not unwillingly,\r\ncapitulated, and ordered a plebiscite to be taken on the question\r\nwhether fusion should take place at once. When the voting came, there\r\nwas no doubt abundance of intimidation by the fusionists; but the\r\noverwhelming majority that declared for them proved that the desire\r\nfor a North Italian Kingdom was predominant in the politics of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAlmost irresistible as the forces were that made for fusion, Mazzini\r\nwas strictly accurate in branding it as a breach of faith. The\r\nfusionists had tried to win him over. The King had sent a message,\r\nthat, if he would use his influence with the republicans in favour of\r\nfusion, he should have an interview with himself, and exercise as much\r\ninfluence as he wished in drafting the constitution on democratic\r\nlines.[16] The offer was a generous and patriotic one, but Mazzini\r\nconsented only on condition that the King would publicly declare for\r\nUnity, and sign a bombastic promise to be \"the priest-king of the new\r\nage.\" Naturally no answer came to this, and Mazzini broke into\r\npolemics, that the bad faith of the other side did something to\r\nexcuse, but which were none the less opposed to the spirit of his\r\npledge. Italy, he said, would never be united, till the flag of the\r\nrepublic flew at Rome. He pleaded that France should adopt a frankly\r\n\"republican and revolutionary\" diplomacy. Royalty was \"a hereditary\r\nlie,\" and the republic the only government which would put the best\r\ncitizens in power. Now and again he shot stinging phrases at his\r\nopponents, that only added to the bitterness of faction; for, as\r\noften, even when Mazzini tried to be tolerant, his pen ran away with\r\nhim. He attacked the Turin nobles, forgetting that they and their sons\r\nwere at the war, giving their lives for the cause he loved. No doubt\r\nhe had provocation, and the baser Moderates were even more intolerant,\r\nbut none the less he was playing a hurtful and ungenerous part.\r\n\r\nHe made, in fact, a grave blunder in staying at Milan. His presence\r\nthere did little to help the war; it was, whether he wished it or not,\r\na standing encouragement to the factiousness, that was not a little\r\nresponsible for the ill-fortune of the army. His place was at Rome. At\r\nbottom the Italians were defeated through the feebleness of Charles\r\nAlbert's generalship and policy and the defection of the Pope and\r\nKing of Naples. Mazzini could do nothing to make a capable commander\r\nof the King; but he might have influenced his policy. Charles Albert,\r\ntimid and conventional as he was, had had his hand forced already and\r\nwas prepared to have it forced again, as his son's was a few years\r\nlater. Mazzini judged the King accurately and not unkindly; but his\r\nattitude towards him was lacking in all tact. Bad-tempered attacks on\r\nthe monarchy, melodramatic appeals for a \"priest-king,\" suggestions\r\nthat the united nation would proclaim the republic from the Capitol,\r\ncould only alarm. But had the popular pressure been sufficient and\r\nwell-directed, Charles Albert would, half fearfully but half gladly,\r\nhave felt his way to the crown of Italy. He had a deep belief in\r\nnationality; he dearly loved popular applause. Romagna was only\r\nwaiting for his signal to come over to him. Piedmontese agents were at\r\nwork in Tuscany, and it is hard to believe that he had not approved\r\ntheir mission. He hesitated long before he declined for his son the\r\ncrown that Sicily laid at his feet. Had Mazzini gone to Rome, he would\r\nhave given a great impulse to the radicals and unitarians there. It\r\nwould almost certainly have decided the Romagnuols; it would not\r\nimpossibly have created such a force of opinion in all Central Italy,\r\nas would have overborne the autonomist parties and the King's own\r\nhesitations, and put all the Papal States and Tuscany under his\r\nsuzerainty. Nay more, though the counter-revolution had triumphed at\r\nNaples, the nationalist elements were strong throughout the South; and\r\nhad Mazzini organized them from Rome, and Garibaldi marched South in\r\nthe name of Unity and Charles Albert, the work of 1860 might have been\r\ndone twelve years earlier. Even had the bigger consummation failed,\r\nMazzini could have forced the Pope to choose between a nationalist\r\npolicy and deposition from his temporal throne; he would have thrown\r\nall the energies of the Roman government into the war, and given\r\nCharles Albert another ten or twenty thousand men, enough to shift the\r\nscales of victory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] See below, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[16] According to Madame Venturi (English Edition of Mazzini, V. 96)\r\nthe King offered him the premiership; but neither Mazzini himself,\r\nnor, so far as I know, any of the memoirs of the time mention it. For\r\nother overtures from the government see Donaver in _Rassegna\r\nNazionale_, Dec. 1, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nThe Roman Republic\r\n\r\n1848-1849. AETAT 43-44\r\n\r\n     The collapse of the war--The People's War--At Florence--The\r\n     mission of Rome--The Roman Republic--The\r\n     Triumvirate--Attitude to the Church--The French attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad he done this, he might have averted the catastrophe, which\r\nquenched the nation's hopes in swift disaster. In one pitched fight\r\nafter another the Italians had won. But courage could not repair bad\r\ngeneralship and growing inferiority of numbers, and Mazzini foretold\r\ndisaster only too accurately. At the end of July the collapse came,\r\nand the army, still fighting doggedly, but starved and outmanoeuvred,\r\nretreated on Milan. For some weeks past Mazzini had urged that a small\r\ncommittee of defence should be appointed; and when disaster\r\nthreatened, he was allowed to nominate his men. He chose Fanti and two\r\nothers, who did their best in the short time to organize the defence\r\nof the city. The Milanese rose again to something of the spirit of the\r\nFive Days; but it was too late to turn the tide of victory. The army\r\nmade a gallant fight outside the city walls, but were driven back\r\nwithin the gates. The unhappy king would fain have fought on still,\r\nbut he knew there was no hope of victory, and after long hesitation\r\nhe surrendered the city. The people, maddened by the desertion,\r\nattacked the palace where he lodged, and it was with difficulty that\r\nhis life was saved. Sullenly he and his army withdrew, followed by\r\nthousands of the citizens, intolerant of Austrian rule.\r\n\r\nMazzini left Milan, as soon as the army arrived, shouldering a rifle\r\nthat Mrs Ashurst had given him when he left England. He had persuaded\r\nhimself that a popular rising might have saved the city, but that the\r\narmy could not. He started to join Garibaldi, who was in command of\r\nthe volunteers at Bergamo, and met a detachment of them at Monza.\r\nTheir flag had \"God and the People\" for its legend, and the volunteers\r\nchose Mazzini to carry it. Garibaldi's small force of three thousand\r\nmen made a difficult retreat, in terrible weather and ever harassed by\r\nthe Austrian cavalry. Mazzini, frail and exhausted, won their\r\nadmiration by his endurance and intrepidity. He was happy doubtless to\r\nhave a simple task, which only asked for physical courage, after the\r\ntangled politics of the last four months.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers disbanded when they had passed the frontier, for the\r\nnational cause seemed desperate. The army had retreated into Piedmont,\r\nand the King had signed an armistice. The Roman and Tuscan forces\r\nhardly existed; Naples was at the mercy of King Ferdinand. The\r\nAustrians had triumphed swiftly and conclusively. They dared not\r\nindeed cross the Ticino for fear of French intervention, they were not\r\nstrong enough as yet to advance into Central Italy, and Venice defied\r\nthem in her lagunes; but Lombardy and the Venetian mainland seemed\r\nlost past hope. Mazzini refused to own defeat. But he based his hopes\r\nmore on partisan illusions than on cool possibilities. The royal war\r\nhad ended; the people's war would begin. The Italians, betrayed by\r\ntheir princes, would rise in their own strength, and crush the\r\nAustrians by force of numbers and enthusiasm. He was working\r\nfeverishly at Lugano to create a national organization to this end,\r\nand prepare for a popular rising in Lombardy. Again he wavered whether\r\nor not to raise the republican flag. Providence, he thought, had by\r\nthe recent disasters pointed the Italians to a republic. But, at all\r\nevents after the fiasco of a mad rising near Como, he recognized the\r\nhopelessness of an unsupported insurrection in the Austrian provinces.\r\nHe saw, as cooler heads saw all along, that the Piedmontese army was\r\nindispensable; and, while urging the Romans to declare for a republic\r\nthere, he was willing to postpone the political question elsewhere,\r\nand work with any, who would relegate it to the decision of a\r\nConstituent Assembly after the war and throw their strength into a new\r\nfight. He recognized at last that his own best field was in Central\r\nItaly. Various motives drew him there. He could use his influence at\r\nFlorence and Rome to push on the military preparations; he could\r\nperhaps secure a union of the two states, which would be a step\r\ntowards unity; he might, if circumstances favoured, help to plant the\r\nrepublican flag. Both in Tuscany and at Rome democracy was triumphant.\r\nThe Pope had fled to Ferdinand's fortress at Gaeta, and the Romans,\r\nfinding every overture for compromise rejected, and left without a\r\nstable government, were heading irresistibly for a republic. At\r\nFlorence the Grand Duke was at the mercy of the democrats, with no\r\nalternative before him but flight or unconditional surrender. Mazzini\r\nleft Lugano, and sailing from Marseilles, arrived at Leghorn on\r\nFebruary 8, just when the news had come that the Grand Duke had fled\r\nfrom Florence. He used his influence to prevent any attack on the\r\nducalists and dissuade the Livornese from secession. A week later he\r\nwas at Florence. Here he saw Giuditta Sidoli, at whose house he met\r\nGino Capponi, and paid a visit to Giusti. But he had little time for\r\nthe society of friends. Guerrazzi was now virtually dictator of\r\nTuscany. More practical in small things than Mazzini, but with none of\r\nhis inspiring confidence or simple loyalty to an idea, he was trying\r\nto steer a middle course and keep clear of a republic. He and Mazzini\r\nhad hot words, and Mazzini, backed by a great republican meeting by\r\nOrcagna's Loggia, forced him to a nominal and insincere acceptance of\r\nits programme. After fruitless efforts to promote union with the Roman\r\nstates, and make the slow Tuscans prepare for war, Mazzini left for\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nEver since the Pope's flight in November, he had been appealing to his\r\nfriends there to agitate for a republic. The road, he urged, was\r\nplain. The Pope had virtually abdicated, and, without a blow, the\r\nrepublic was in their grasp,--a republic, which might grow into a\r\nrepublican Italy. \"You have,\" he wrote, \"in your hands the destinies\r\nof Italy, and the destinies of Italy are the destinies of the world.\"\r\nIt was one of the master-ideas of his life, cherished through years of\r\nmeditation from the first days of Young Italy. The thought was a\r\nfantastic one; a student's conceit, fed on his early classical\r\nstudies, on his later readings in medieval history, above all on\r\nDante's faith in Rome, the destined seat of Empire; a strange\r\nhistorical survival, born of what Cesare Balbo called \"the importunate\r\nmemory of Rome's past greatness,\" which translated into modern terms\r\nthe theories of the Holy Roman Empire. Many an Italian in those days\r\nshared that faith,--a faith that fed their inextinguishable resolve\r\nthat Rome should be the capital of Italy. Mazzini and Gioberti went\r\nbeyond, and looked to Rome for some new word of truth for all\r\nhumanity. But while Gioberti's destined instrument was a reformed\r\nPapacy, Mazzini watched for a Pope-less, republican, Italian Rome to\r\nbring the dawn of that \"religious transformation,\" Christian in spirit\r\nand in origin but with another dogma, which would again unite mankind\r\nin a living, universal faith. Indefinite as his conception was, the\r\nthought of an all-embracing unity, the \"word of universal\r\nbrotherhood\"--the necessary mark of any great religion--runs through\r\nit all. As Imperial Rome had united Europe by force of arms and\r\nmajesty of law, as Papal Rome had united it by thought and spiritual\r\nauthority, so \"Rome of the People\" would unite it once again in some\r\nnew gospel of social duty and progress, would harmonize the temporal\r\nand the spiritual, the Roman law of justice and the Christian law of\r\nsacrifice. When nationality had remodelled Europe, then would eternal\r\nRome, destined alone of cities to rise more mighty from each fall, be\r\nhailed its moral centre, seat of a diet of the nations, to teach to\r\nthem their common duties to humanity.[17] Who will say that this last\r\nmore modest vision may not some day and in some sense be fulfilled?\r\n\r\nPartly in consequence of Mazzini's incentives, more from force of\r\ncircumstances, the republic was proclaimed at Rome on the day after he\r\nlanded at Leghorn. The Assembly, a fairly level-headed body, elected\r\non manhood suffrage and drawing its members from the larger landed\r\nproprietors and upper middle classes, had voted for it by a great\r\nmajority; and the republican Triumvirs had discoursed in true\r\nMazzinian phrases, and headed their acts with the rubric \"God and the\r\nPeople.\" On the fourth day of the republic the Assembly unanimously\r\nmade Mazzini citizen of Rome, and invited him to come. He started as\r\nsoon as he could leave Tuscany, and arrived on the evening of March 5,\r\nslipping into the city unobserved, \"awed and like a worshipper,\"\r\nfeeling, as he passed under the Porta del Popolo, \"a spurt of new\r\nlife,\" that for the moment swept away doubtings and disappointments.\r\nHis first thought was to organize for the impending war. Piedmont,\r\nunreconciled to defeat and stung by Austrian brutalities in Lombardy,\r\nwas about to denounce the armistice; there were formidable\r\npreparations for insurrection in the Lombard cities; Venice was\r\nundaunted and threatening from her lagunes. Republican Rome must not\r\nbe behindhand. Mazzini made her anticipate the belated appeal from\r\nPiedmont by offering ten thousand men, and they had started for the\r\nNorth when the news of Novara came.\r\n\r\nPiedmont lay crushed by one staggering blow, and the hope of freeing\r\nLombardy had gone. The moment's task was to save Central Italy, and in\r\nthe imminent danger the Romans turned to the man who had won their\r\nreverence and lifted them to something of his own moral greatness.\r\nMazzini was made a Triumvir, and henceforth became little less than\r\ndictator. He had probably at heart small hope of saving the Republic,\r\nand to foreigners like Clough and Margaret Fuller did not conceal his\r\nfears. But the cause was not yet desperate. He knew he could\r\ncontemptuously disregard the Neapolitans, who were hovering on the\r\nSouthern frontier; and at this time he could not foresee how base a\r\npart France was soon to play. The Austrians were the only serious\r\nenemy in sight; and with Hungary still untamed, with the chance that\r\nPiedmont might brace itself to a third effort, a desperate defence\r\nmight yet keep them at bay. He intended to treble the Roman forces,\r\nand concentrating them at Terni, swoop down on the long line of\r\nAustrian communications, as they advanced along the Eastern coast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, among the cares of war, he began to build a government that\r\nshould be worthy of his ideal. \"Here in Rome,\" he told the bickering\r\npoliticians in the Assembly, \"we may not be moral mediocrities.\" He\r\nhoped to inspire government and people with one great purpose, that\r\nwould leave no place for party-spirit or suspicion. He would have no\r\nexclusiveness, no intolerance, no war of classes or attacks on\r\nproperty or person. \"Stiffness in principles, tolerance to\r\nindividuals\" was the motto of his rule, and to this, through all the\r\ntroubled times that followed, he was nobly true. At a time when\r\nnational danger might have excused severe precautions, the press was\r\nhardly interfered with; there were few arrests, fewer penalties, for\r\npolitical offences; conspirators, with barely an exception, were left\r\nin contemptuous tolerance, or merely warned not to let the people know\r\nof their intrigues. It was this very leniency to the men who were\r\nplotting the Republic's downfall, that led to the few outrages that\r\nstained its name. The civil service and police, left full of enemies\r\nand lukewarm friends, lacked vigour to repress the disorderly\r\nelements; and here and there a fanatic or criminal took advantage of\r\nthe murmurings at Mazzini's tolerance to assassinate a Papalist. But\r\nsave in a few provincial towns, where political murder was endemic,\r\nand for a few isolated outrages at Rome, there was absolute security\r\nalike for friend and foe. Mazzini's mild authority stands out in\r\nluminous contrast with the Papal terrorism, that scourged the unhappy\r\nland before and after.\r\n\r\nThe Triumvir's attitude to the Catholic Church is a strange commentary\r\non the myth, that writes him down an anti-clerical fanatic. The man,\r\nwho believed Catholicism a spent force, whose whole soul yearned for a\r\nnew religion to issue forth from Rome, was yet superlatively careful\r\nnot to shake the people's one religious creed. It would have been easy\r\nto do otherwise. There was fierce exasperation at the Pope's obduracy,\r\nat the ferocious fanaticism of men, who would see Rome bombarded\r\nrather than yield one tittle of their temporal power. Churches were\r\nhalf empty, and, but for the government's precautions, many another\r\npriest would have died the victim of the people's anger. But Mazzini\r\nmade it one of his first cares to protect the clergy in their\r\nspiritual work. His deep religious instinct, old memories and\r\nfriendships, his respect for men who in their way were witnesses to\r\nthe spiritual, made him always tolerant towards them. \"In Italy,\" he\r\nonce said, \"the priest is powerless for harm but powerful to do good\";\r\nand before this time and after he made impassioned appeals to them to\r\ntake their part in the national work. He tried to win them now. It was\r\nfrom no ill-will towards the Church that he did something to repair\r\nthe ecclesiastical misrule. Such reforms as he effected were bound to\r\ngo to the strengthening of a church, made hateful by clerical\r\ndomination; and many were the priests and monks who defied the\r\nthreatening cardinals at Gaeta, and gladly rallied to the republic.\r\nThe nationalization of church lands, which Mazzini took over from his\r\npredecessors, aimed at improving the stipends of the poorer clergy.\r\nReligious services and processions went on uninterrupted, and his one\r\nact of severity towards the priests was to fine the canons of St\r\nPeter's for refusing to celebrate the usual Easter services. \"It is\r\nthe duty of the government,\" the Triumvirs said, \"to preserve religion\r\nuncontaminated.\" \"Do not be afraid,\" he wrote to a nun, who feared the\r\nsuppression of her convent; \"pray God for our country and for men of\r\ngood intentions.\" Once in the fear of imminent attack upon the city,\r\nthe crowd fetched a few confessional boxes from the churches to make\r\nbarricades. Mazzini reminded them that from those confessionals had\r\ncome at all events words of comfort to their mothers. It is perhaps\r\nthe most convincing proof of his grip on the people's hearts, that the\r\nconfessionals were taken back. With the Pope himself he was ever ready\r\nto compromise. True, he had postulated his expulsion and the downfall\r\nof his authority as the condition of the new faith, for which he\r\nyearned. But whether it was that the statesman saw that the idealist\r\nmust wait, or from his deep respect for the institution round which\r\nhung so much of Christian history, or that he wished to remove the\r\nlast pretext for the intervention of foreign Catholics, his attitude\r\nwent to the extreme of conciliatoriness. At its first outset the\r\nRepublic, while decreeing the fall of the Temporal Power, had promised\r\nall necessary guarantees for the Pope's spiritual authority; and\r\nMazzini, anticipating Cavour, tried to persuade the Assembly to define\r\nthe guarantees, and offer to consider any suggestions for them that\r\nthe Catholic Powers chose to make. We must distinguish, he said, the\r\nPope from the Prince, and claim our rights without doing violence to\r\nreligious faith.\r\n\r\nThus noble and thus gentle was the Triumvir's rule, and finely the\r\npeople responded to it. At first there had been small enthusiasm for\r\nthe Republic. The Romans had accepted it calmly, as the one\r\nalternative to the intolerable rule of priests. But Mazzini touched\r\nthem with his own great faith. He appealed to no selfish interests. He\r\npromised social legislation, but it went into the background behind\r\nthe national question; and except for a land scheme to create a\r\npeasant proprietary on the church lands, there was no time to project\r\nmuch for their material well-being. His was a pure spiritual\r\nascendancy, that made a populace, demoralized by bad government and\r\ncharity, rise to something of his own moral height and dare to bear\r\nand die. There were some at all events, to whom Rome, hallowed by a\r\ngreat ideal and noble rule, had become as the city of God. Greatly\r\ntheir leader merited their love. The equivocations of the past few\r\nmonths had gone, and in a clear position of command, untrammelled by\r\nthe need to compromise with alien forces, he stood in all the majesty\r\nof his translucent soul. It shone in his face; worn and emaciated, he\r\nseemed to Margaret Fuller \"more divine than ever.\" His personal life,\r\nof which we have grievously few records, was one of democratic\r\nsimplicity. Lodged in the Quirinal, he hunted for a room \"small enough\r\nto feel at home in.\" Here he sat unguarded and serene, \"sadly [Greek:\r\nadoryphoros] for a [Greek: tyrannos],\" wrote Clough (for it was a\r\ncountry where political assassination was a tradition on both sides),\r\nas accessible to working men and women as to his own officials, with\r\nthe same smile and warm hand-shake for all; dining for two francs at a\r\ncheap restaurant, afterwards, during the siege, living on bread and\r\nraisins, his only luxury the flowers that an unknown hand sent every\r\nday, his one relaxation to sing to his guitar when left alone at\r\nnight. The Triumvir's slender stipend of £32 a month he spent entirely\r\non others. As an administrator, he was too gentle to be sufficiently\r\nprompt and stern. He even refused to sign the death-warrant of a\r\nsoldier condemned by court-martial. But he made amends by his\r\nunbending energy and the quick and fertile intellect, that helped in\r\nevery military detail of the defence and made his diplomatic notes, so\r\nPalmerston is said to have called them, \"models of reasoning and\r\nargument.\" Through all the tangled cares of government he kept his\r\ncalmness and serenity, the statesman's right to lift his people to new\r\nvisions and new powers.\r\n\r\nHis hope was to leave a great republican example. Probably he dared\r\nexpect no more. Sanguine no doubt he was, but in his cooler moments\r\nhe seems to have realized from the first that the powers of evil were\r\ntoo strong for the noble little republic. The blow came from an\r\nunexpected quarter. This is not the place to dissect the causes, that\r\nled France to the meanest of modern political crimes, that impelled a\r\nstate, pledged by its own constitution \"never to employ its forces\r\nagainst the liberties of another people,\" to destroy an unoffending\r\nsister-republic. France paid at Sedan for the carelessness of honour,\r\nthat allowed the Catholics and Louis Napoleon to do a great crime in\r\nher name. When Oudinot's expedition started, and, in spite of falsity\r\non falsity, it was plain that the French government intended to crush\r\nthe Romans, Mazzini's policy was clear. He would not yield to brute,\r\nunrighteous force; Rome, he told the Assembly, must \"do its duty and\r\ngive a high example to every people and every part of Italy.\" But to\r\nhim the enemy was not France but the French government. The true\r\nrepublicans at Paris were striving courageously to save the Romans and\r\ntheir own national honour; and on their efforts depended the one hope\r\nof safety. He would do nothing that would weaken their hands or\r\nunnecessarily hurt French pride. When the Assembly resolved without a\r\ndissentient voice to resist at all cost, and Oudinot's troops were\r\ningloriously driven back, defeated by the raw Italian levies, he\r\nrefused to let Garibaldi make the rout complete. The French prisoners\r\nwere released after generous and diplomatic hospitality. A monster\r\ngift of cigars was sent to the enemy's quarters, wrapped in handbills\r\nthat appealed to republican fraternity. Perhaps someone remembered\r\nthat eighty years before the American Congress had sent the same\r\ningenuous present to the Hessian mercenaries.\r\n\r\nFraud and force alike had failed to open the gates of Rome, and the\r\nlong chapter of deceit went on,--deceit hard to parallel even in the\r\ndiplomacy of great nations. Ferdinand de Lesseps, then a budding\r\nattaché, was sent to parley with the Romans, till Oudinot's\r\nreinforcements arrived, and the new elections in France gave a\r\nCatholic majority in the Chamber. It was a mere ruse, but de Lesseps\r\nwas Napoleon's dupe and negotiated in all good faith, giving ample\r\ncredit to Mazzini's \"moderation and loyalty and courage.\" Had they\r\nbeen left alone, they would have concluded peace on terms honourable\r\nto both sides, and Mazzini seems to have hoped that the danger from\r\nFrance was passing. Garibaldi was sent to meet the Neapolitans, who\r\nhad advanced as far as Albano, and drove them back in rout across the\r\nfrontier. King Ferdinand brevetted Ignatius Loyola field-marshal of\r\nhis army, but the very posthumous honour could not exorcise the\r\nsuperstitious terror, with which the great guerilla-chieftain's name\r\ninspired his men. Had the Triumvirs been free to let Garibaldi\r\nadvance, the Bourbon power would perhaps have crumbled, as it crumbled\r\neleven years later.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment when Mazzini and de Lesseps had agreed on terms, the\r\nFrench government threw off the mask, and Oudinot made a treacherous\r\nattack. Then came the memorable siege, when for nearly a month the\r\nbadly-armed and badly-generalled Romans kept at bay an army twice\r\ntheir number and a powerful siege artillery. Heroically they\r\nstruggled on against the overwhelming odds. The great majority of the\r\nsoldiers were natives of the state; but some had gathered from all\r\nItaly, drawn by the spell of Rome to fight once more for country. It\r\nwas a band of heroes, such as never came again together in the Italian\r\nstruggle; generals of the future like Medici and Bixio; Manara, the\r\nLombard leader in the Five Days; Mameli, the war-poet of Italy, son of\r\nthe woman who had been Mazzini's boyish love; Ugo Bassi, the\r\npriest-patriot, greatest Italian preacher of his day, nearest of\r\nspiritual kin to Mazzini's self; Bertani, the future organizer of the\r\nSicilian Thousand and Pisacane their precursor; and the great\r\nprotagonists themselves, Mazzini and Garibaldi;--a diverse band,\r\npatricians and plebeians, saints and sinners, royalists and\r\nrepublicans, all moved by one supreme redeeming love of Italy and\r\nRome. Within, the city showed a passive heroism as fine. Calmly and\r\npatiently the people bore the destruction of their homes, the growing\r\nscarcity, the hopelessness of victory as the toils drew ever closer\r\nround the fated city. Six thousand women came forward to offer their\r\nservice in the hospitals. When the women of the poor Trastevere were\r\ndriven from their homes by the French shells, the government lodged\r\nthem in the palaces of the fugitive nobles, on their simple promise\r\nthat there should be neither theft nor injury, and the promise given\r\nin the name of \"God and the People\" was scrupulously kept.\r\n\r\nTo their leader those weeks must have been a time of fearful strain.\r\nGaribaldi's bad generalship and bad temper shortened a resistance,\r\nthat was hopeless from the first. The losses were heavy, and Mameli\r\nand Manara fell with many another of Mazzini's friends. After the\r\nill-fated revolt of the Mountain on June 13, there was no hope of\r\ndiversion from the republicans at Paris. At home, though the Assembly\r\nloyally supported him, he had to meet the petulant criticism of\r\nGaribaldi and the intriguers who made him their tool. To him it was a\r\nmatter of clear duty that the Republic should fight on to the end.\r\n\"Monarchies may capitulate, republics die and bear their testimony\r\neven to martyrdom.\" When the last defences broke down, he wished to\r\nmake a desperate fight from street to street, or retire with the\r\nAssembly and the army to the Apennines, throw themselves on the\r\nAustrian lines, and keep the republican flag flying in Romagna. The\r\narmy was prepared for either course; but the Assembly had no stomach\r\nfor the sacrifice, and Mazzini, bitterly reproaching them, resigned\r\nhis office on the eve of the city's fall. Sullenly Rome surrendered,\r\nand the victors, as they entered the city, hung back before the\r\nthreatening populace. Garibaldi, with three thousand who disdained\r\nsurrender, began his great retreat. \"Hunger and thirst and vigil,\" he\r\npromised them, \"but never terms with the enemy.\" Mazzini would have\r\nbeen more consistent, had he gone out with them. Perhaps he had no\r\nliking for a desperate fragment of his rejected scheme; perhaps the\r\npersonal tension with Garibaldi was too great. For some days he stayed\r\non in Rome. He was worn out and overstrung; he had not slept on a bed\r\nsince the siege began, he had fed on coarse and insufficient food. In\r\ntwo short months he had grown old; his beard was grey, his face\r\ncadaverous, his manner, so Margaret Fuller noted, \"sweet and calm,\r\nbut full of a more fiery purpose than ever.\" He wandered defiantly\r\nabout the streets. It was partly that he wanted, by offering himself\r\nto any assassin's knife, to kill the lie of the Catholic press that he\r\nhad forced a hated tyranny upon the Romans. Besides, he had a\r\ndesperate hope that he might rouse the people and the remaining troops\r\nto one more struggle. His whole soul was possessed by the passion to\r\nprotest on to the end against the triumph of brute force. It is\r\nstrange that the French did not arrest him; perhaps they knew too well\r\nthe temper of the people. At last Gustavo Modena's wife and Margaret\r\nFuller persuaded him to withdraw. He had no passport, but he found the\r\nmeans of sailing to Marseilles; there he succeeded in eluding the\r\nFrench police and travelled on to Geneva.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[17] See below, c. xvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nLondon Again\r\n\r\n1849-1859. AETAT 44-54\r\n\r\n     In Switzerland--Life in London--English friends--English\r\n     politics and literature--The Friends of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMazzini stayed for a few weeks in a quiet hotel near his old quarters\r\nat Geneva, then moved to Lausanne, where he and a few more refugees,\r\nSaffi, his co-Triumvir, and Pisacane among them, took a small house\r\n(the Villa Montallegro) near the town on the hills that overlook the\r\nlake. Here he and his friends plunged at once into the old eager work\r\nof correspondence and journalism, as if the struggle at Rome had been\r\na holiday. Another ephemeral paper, _L'Italia del Popolo_, was\r\nlaunched on its short career. His head was full of literary\r\nschemes,--an Italian translation of the Gospels with an introduction,\r\na new Encyclopædia, which should do for religious democracy what the\r\nold Encyclopædia had done for the thought of the eighteenth century.\r\nIt was a quiet, not unhappy time, that must have recalled something of\r\nthe old days at Marseilles. At times indeed he was miserable and\r\npessimistic as of old, brooding over lost friendships, chafing at the\r\ntriumph of brute force in Italy. But except in these hours of taciturn\r\ngloom, when he avoided all companionship, he was serene and genial,\r\nsometimes brightening into anecdote and humour, when the party settled\r\ndown to the evening's talk and chess.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1850 the agitation in France at the proposed revision\r\nof the constitution excited vague hopes of a revolution there; and\r\nwith some fatuous idea that he could help to stop Louis Napoleon's\r\nprogress to empire, Mazzini went to Paris, only to discover how empty\r\nwas the expectation. On the journey he lost a note-book, in which for\r\nmany years he had entered his thoughts on religion. The world would\r\ngain more from its discovery than from that of any lost Greek tragedy.\r\nHe crossed to England for a few months, then returned to Switzerland.\r\nBut the persecution of 1834 repeated itself. The governments put\r\npressure on the Swiss to expel the refugees, and Mazzini after a month\r\nor two of hiding found it necessary to leave. One night in November he\r\nand two friends left Geneva, walking along the lake to Nyon, while\r\nthey discussed Byron and Mickiewicz, and were taken on in a friend's\r\ncarriage to Lausanne, whence he found the means to escape to England.\r\n\r\nHere he made his home with few interruptions till the last years of\r\nhis life, taking no small part in English society and politics,\r\nfinding his best friends in English men and women. \"Italy is my\r\ncountry, but England is my real home, if I have any,\" he said. He had\r\ncome to love England and English ways, and in his brief political\r\njourneys to Italy his home thoughts went to England, and he was glad\r\nto be back again. His old horror of London changed to a real liking;\r\nand its conveniences for his work made it difficult to get him out of\r\ntown, save for a rare visit to his friends, or for a day or two to\r\nrecruit his health at St Leonard's or Eastbourne, which he liked, or\r\nat Brighton, which he hated. He longed sometimes, indeed, for \"some\r\nsecret nook in the country, to breathe fresh air and gaze on the sky\r\nor at the sea\"; but when he was urged to take rest in the country, he\r\nrailed affectionately at his \"misled and dreamy friends\" for supposing\r\nhe could attend to his work anywhere out of London. The fogs still had\r\ntheir fascination for him; he wrote once from Italy, \"I think very\r\noften under these radiant skies of the London fogs and always\r\nregretfully. Individually speaking, I was evidently intended for an\r\nEnglishman.\"\r\n\r\nAt first he lived at Cromwell Lodge, Old Brompton, a little house in\r\nthe middle of orchards and gardens at what was then the extreme\r\nwestern end of London. Building operations drove him thence, and Mrs\r\nCarlyle found him lodgings over a post-office at 15 Radnor Street,\r\nnear his old rooms in York Buildings. Here, at first with Saffi and\r\nthree other exiles, afterwards alone, he lived the frugallest of\r\nlives. His income indeed was somewhat larger than it had been. At his\r\nmother's death he came into an annuity of £160 a year, which she,\r\nknowing how readily his money flowed to public work and charity, had\r\nwisely invested with obdurate trustees. His friends would gladly have\r\nhelped him, but though he frankly asked money of them for his cause\r\n(always scrupulously repaying it, if borrowed on his personal\r\nresponsibility), he never, so far as I know, would take from this time\r\nforward money for strictly personal needs. Once only he accepted some\r\nto pay for a private secretary, and once again for cabs, when his\r\nfriends suspected that there were plots to assassinate him, and feared\r\nfor his walking in London streets, unprotected save by a sword-cane.\r\nThus, even with casual literary earnings, his income seldom reached\r\n£200, and of this for some years £80 went to the education of the\r\nTencioni children, and often every other available penny to finance\r\nhis plots of insurrection. While his enemies in Italy painted him\r\nliving in patrician luxury, he denied himself every comfort (cigars\r\nalways excepted), save the modest ones that his friends forced on him.\r\nMoney he only wanted for his political schemes. \"I have never felt so\r\nbitterly the curse of not being rich,\" he wrote once, when wanting\r\nrifles for one of his revolutionary plots. For himself, he was content\r\nwith his humble fare and modest lodgings. Here in his small room,\r\nevery piece of furniture littered with books and papers, the air thick\r\nwith smoke of cheap Swiss cigars (except when friends sent Havannahs),\r\nbrightened only by his tame canaries and carefully-tended plants, he\r\nwas generally writing at his desk till evening, always with more work\r\nin hand than he could cope with, carrying on the usual mass of\r\ncorrespondence, writing articles for his Italian papers, raising\r\npublic funds with infinite labour, stirring his English friends to\r\nhelp the cause, finding money and work for the poor refugees, or\r\norganizing concerts in their interest. The school in Greville Street\r\nwent on for three years longer, when, except for the Sunday lectures,\r\nit was closed. And amid all the exacting cares of public work he\r\nspared himself no trouble for his English friends, advising in their\r\nfamily affairs, writing long letters of tenderness and spiritual\r\nwisdom to comfort a bereaved son or lead a young girl from a life of\r\nselfishness to higher things.\r\n\r\nHe had aged greatly since he left London less than three years ago. He\r\nwas worn and thin, his beard was white, and the once dark features\r\nwore \"a sort of grey, ashy halo.\" But it was the same high\r\n\"cliff-like\" forehead, the regular features, the strong, straight\r\nnose, \"the exquisite curve of lips like a woman's in their expression\r\nof spotless purity,\" the piercing black eyes, whose like none ever\r\nknew who saw them, \"of luminous depth, full of sadness, tenderness,\r\nand courage, of purity and fire, readily flashing into indignation or\r\nhumour, always with the latent expression of exhaustless resolution\";\r\n\"the only eyes,\" says another observer, \"I ever saw that looked like\r\nflames.\" \"His face in repose was grave, even sad, but it lit up with a\r\nsmile of wonderful sweetness, as he greeted a friend with a pressure,\r\nrather than a shake, from the thin hand.\"[18] He carried his head a\r\nlittle forward, and he had a habit of sitting on the edge of a chair,\r\nperhaps, it has been suggested, because in his own room his books left\r\nbut narrow margin for sedentary uses. He dressed, as ever, with\r\nperfect neatness, in a worn black frock-coat, a double-breasted velvet\r\nwaistcoat buttoned high, despising collars and substituting a silk\r\nhandkerchief wound round his neck, wearing a long thin gold watch\r\nchain, which had probably been his father's, and two rings, one at\r\nleast no doubt his mother's, now rescued from the pawn-shop.\r\n\r\nHis personal life was centred almost wholly in his English friends. It\r\nis true, he felt his exile bitterly. \"Wish for me,\" he writes to\r\nfriends one Christmas, \"that I may die in the country and for the\r\ncountry, in which I have been forbidden to live.\" But he had no home\r\nties in Italy now. His father had died in the winter of 1848, leaving\r\nhim to brood over the thought that he had been but a source of pain to\r\nthe grim old man, who under all his moroseness and want of sympathy\r\nhad never lost his pride and affection for his son. His mother, whom\r\nhe had seen once again when at Milan, with whom he had never relaxed\r\nthe close, affectionate correspondence, died in the summer of 1852. It\r\nwas a very heavy blow. There was no one to replace her; he had lost\r\n\"the dream of his individual life,--to see her in the joy of triumph,\"\r\nwhen Italy was free. But he nerved himself, and took her loss as an\r\nincentive to fresh effort. \"My mother,\" he writes, \"seems to me to be\r\npresent, perhaps nearer than she was in her terrestrial life. I feel\r\nmore and more the sacredness of duties, which she recognized, and of a\r\nmission which she approved. I have now no mother on earth except my\r\ncountry, and I shall be true to her, as my mother has been to me.\" So\r\nintensely actual was she still to him, that once afterwards, when in\r\nhiding and deep dejection, he thought she came to him in veritable\r\npresence to strengthen and console him. His lonely heart, athirst as\r\never for affection, went out to his English friends, the men and still\r\nmore the women, who believed in him and in his politics, and tried to\r\nbring some warmth and brightness into his sad life. After a year or\r\ntwo he saw little more of the Carlyles, but their place was more than\r\ntaken by the Ashursts, the Stansfelds, the Peter Taylors, the Shaens,\r\nthe Mallesons, the Nathans, the Milner-Gibsons. When the day's work\r\nwas over, he would generally spend the evening at one or other of\r\ntheir houses, most often with the Stansfelds, whose home at Bellevue\r\nLodge was within an easy walk from his lodgings. Gradually he came to\r\nhave a large outside circle of acquaintances. He corresponded with\r\nGrote and Mrs Gaskell; the Brownings, J. S. Mill, Jowett, Swinburne,\r\nCairnes, Miss Martineau, probably Dickens were among the people he\r\nmet.[19]\r\n\r\nWith these friendships a new light and happiness came to his life.\r\nProbably, too, the consciousness of having played a great part nobly\r\nadded a new touch of dignity and gentleness. \"The indescribable look\r\nof suffering for others,\" noted one who met him now after a ten years'\r\ninterval, \"has disappeared, and he is now a man full of experience,\r\npatience, and hope.\" \"The Roman revolution,\" wrote Carlyle to Emerson,\r\n\"has made a man of him,--quite brightened up ever since.\" All the\r\nhuman sweetness in him blossomed out. His friends provided the home\r\ncare, which he had lost, since he left his mother and sisters at Genoa\r\ntwenty years ago; and he loved to repay them by many little marks of\r\naffection, never forgetting birthdays, buying presents of books and\r\njewelry out of his slender purse, taking them to the Opera, where his\r\nacquaintance with the great Italian singers sometimes put boxes at his\r\ndisposal. In his evenings at the Stansfelds he was often full of\r\nmerry fun; he could tell a story well, all the more piquantly for his\r\nItalicisms. One favourite anecdote (he had told it to Mrs Carlyle) was\r\nhow he baffled an undertaker, who brought a coffin by mistake to his\r\nlandlady's, and refused to take it away. \"My dear,\" he said, no doubt\r\nwith his sweet gravity, \"we have not here a dead.\" Or he would, when\r\nquite alone with the family, sing to his guitar, or finger out on it\r\nthe score of some favourite opera. His native gentleness came out in\r\nhis kindness to children and animals. He does not seem to have been\r\nnaturally very fond of children, but, when among them, he made himself\r\neasily at home. Some French children at a house which he visited, who\r\ngot into disgrace when Louis Blanc came to see them, were always good\r\nwith Mazzini, \"because he was so kind and never failed to enquire\r\nafter the dolls.\" They loved to sit and listen to his talk, not that\r\nthey understood him, but because the beautiful voice fascinated them.\r\nWith dogs and cats and birds he was always happy. He would make one of\r\nhis hostesses angry, because he insisted on feeding her dog at dinner.\r\n\"But, my dear,\" he would say, \"I make Bruno happy.\" Ledru Rollin and\r\nhe, once talking, probably, of the European revolution, put out their\r\ncigars, because the smoke made a dog uncomfortable. His most constant\r\ncompanions were his tame linnets and canaries. He had netting over the\r\nwindows, so that they could fly about his room at liberty; and\r\nvisitors would generally find a bird or two perched on his head or\r\nshoulders, or hopping among his papers, inured to the thick tobacco\r\nsmoke, in which they and he lived.\r\n\r\nHe was a brilliant talker, because he was in earnest and his thoughts\r\nwere clear, at all events to himself. There was no trace of effort or\r\naffectation; he was always just himself and never played a part. He\r\nwould speak with a prophet's simplicity and conviction of his\r\nreligious faith and the destinies of man, talking vivaciously,\r\ntenaciously, passionately sometimes, with the authority of one who had\r\nno thought of self and had lived and suffered for his creed. Some of\r\nhis hosts were the champions of every struggling cause, and the\r\nconversation turned naturally to American slavery or women's rights or\r\nnationality or cooperation. Music and poetry were favourite subjects\r\nwith him, and he would contend pugnaciously in mock-earnestness for\r\nthe superiority of Meyerbeer over Rossini, or inveigh to his heart's\r\ncontent against the abominated doctrine of \"art for the sake of art.\"\r\nHe once, when dining with Mr and Mrs William Shaen, forgot his dinner\r\nin his eagerness to convert his hostess from the heresy; and when\r\npressed to eat, pleaded that he had something else to do, for \"here is\r\nMrs Shaen travelling to perdition as fast as she can, and I must save\r\nher soul.\" He spoke English now well and fluently, but,--unlike his\r\nEnglish writing, which was rarely unidiomatic,--with many little\r\nItalicisms. Among those he seldom met, he was sometimes nervous and\r\nsilent; at other times, perhaps from the same nervousness, he would\r\nmonopolize the conversation, and was remorseful afterwards. Once, many\r\nyears after this time, he met Jowett, and talked uninterruptedly for\r\ntwo hours, Jowett listening silently. When Jowett went, he observed,\r\n\"he made me talk all the time, and I have no notion what he thought\r\nof it.\" Jowett, made careful notes of what he said, and years\r\nafterwards remarked, in allusion to their meeting, \"Mazzini was a man\r\nof genius, but too much under the influence of two abstract ideas, God\r\nand the principle of nationality.\" He thought, though, very highly of\r\nhim. \"He was an enthusiast, a visionary,\" he said, \"but he was a very\r\nnoble character, and had a genius far beyond that of ordinary\r\nstatesmen. Though not a statesman, I think that his reputation will\r\nincrease as time goes on, when that of most statesmen disappears.\"\r\n\r\nWith those, who knew him well, constraining was the influence of this\r\nman, who spoke with authority of life and God and duty. Young people\r\nat all events, who came under the spell of those eyes, and heard the\r\nvibrating voice speak with passionate earnestness of the deep things\r\nof God, felt for him an awe and veneration, such as few, if any, of\r\nhis generation inspired. Here was one who had given all for his ideal,\r\nwho had taken poverty for his bride, yet without self-righteousness,\r\ntoo sad at the world's sin and struggle to be aught but humble; one\r\ntoo, who had lived on a great stage, who was helping to remodel\r\nEurope, a great thinker, a great moral teacher, yet with infinite\r\nconcern for the trials and temptations of some puzzled soul. \"Thou\r\nnoble Mazzini,\" said Clough after brief knowledge of his life at Rome.\r\nMuch deeper was the feeling of those, who had the privilege of close\r\ncompanionship. And, though, perhaps, it would be difficult to prove\r\nit, it is probable that he has left no inconsiderable impress on\r\nEnglish thought. Here and there one finds strong traces of his\r\ninfluence on men, who have helped to mould the best thought among us\r\nin the last forty years. \"Mazzini is the true teacher of our age,\"\r\nsaid Arnold Toynbee. Never, certainly, did age more need his high\r\nidealism to teach a nobler rule in national and private life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis literary work at this time was not remarkable. He was \"still\r\npraying God to grant him, when Italy had become a nation, two years of\r\nhermit life,\" when he could write his long-cherished book on religion\r\nand a popular history of Italian nationality. But the hope of ever\r\nwriting them was gradually fading. He was too absorbed through all\r\nthis period by political propagandism, and in his controversial\r\nwritings of these years he is generally far from being at his best.\r\nThe latter chapters of his _Duties of Man_, however, date from this\r\ndecade. He seems, despite his busy life, to have found a good deal of\r\ntime for reading. His writings on the Slav question are evidently the\r\nresult of careful study. Apart from political reading, English\r\nliterature seems to have claimed his interests. Byron was still to him\r\nthe greatest of English poets, and he read Byroniana with the zest of\r\na devotee. He could not forgive England for her neglect of her \"only\r\npoet who will live in times to come.\" \"I wish,\" he once wrote, \"I had\r\ntime to write before dying a book on Byron, and abuse all England, a\r\nfew women excepted, for the way she treats one of her greatest souls\r\nand minds.\" He was keenly interested in the controversy on Byron's\r\ntreatment of his wife, refusing to believe that the husband was the\r\nmore in fault, but owning himself too indiscriminating an admirer to\r\nbe a fair judge.[20] He would contrast him with Wordsworth and\r\nColeridge, criticizing the latter as contemplative poets, living\r\nremote from action among their lakes and mountains,--which proves that\r\nhe had not read Wordsworth's patriotic sonnets. He liked Chatterton in\r\na way, drawn doubtless to him by his sad end and de Vigny's drama; \"I\r\nhave always,\" he writes, \"had a sort of fondness for him, as I have\r\nfor crushed flowers.\" Among contemporary poets Mrs Browning was\r\nprobably his favourite. He reads _Aurora Leigh_, \"admiring it very\r\nmuch, only wishing from time to time that she had written it in\r\nbeautiful prose than--passages excepted--in neglected poetry.\"\r\nBrowning himself he is said to have read and admired. But perhaps he\r\nalludes to him when he writes, \"the form in England begins to be\r\nsystematically wrong, I think.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had resumed his strong interest in English life and\r\npolitics, stimulated no doubt by the keen thinkers he moved among, but\r\nalways preserving his own original outlook. On the whole, his was not\r\na very appreciative criticism. Sincerely and increasingly as he\r\nadmired the freedom and seriousness of English ways, he keenly felt\r\nthe decay of our religious life, and, what he regarded as its\r\nconsequence, the selfishness and want of principle in our foreign\r\npolicy. His knowledge of Protestantism was never very deep or\r\nsympathetic; but he knew enough of it to apply his own tests of\r\nreligious vitality. He condemned it for its soul-killing formalism; he\r\nshowed how it sinned against itself, when it ceased to be concerned\r\nwith men as citizens; he poured scorn on the Bible Societies, that\r\ntried to proselytize his countrymen, and made no sign, when he and\r\nother Italians had fought at Rome for liberty of conscience. It was to\r\nthis want of true religion, that he charged our insular selfishness.\r\nHe detested the Cobdenites. \"The 'peace-men' have no principle.\" \"Your\r\nPeace Societies,\" he wrote in an open letter to \"the people of\r\nEngland,\" \"allowing God's law and Godlike human life to be\r\nsystematically crushed on the two-thirds of Europe,--your _believers_\r\nin liberty as the only pledge for man's responsibility, allying\r\nthemselves with despots,--your Christians fighting for the maintenance\r\nof Mahommedan law on European populations,--seem to me to be the\r\nreverse of religious.\" If England gave no helping hand to the young\r\nnationalities to which belonged the future, she would find herself in\r\ntwenty years shut out from the sympathies and alliances and markets of\r\nthe Continent. He vigorously condemned the Crimean War, and took his\r\nstand with the few, who tried to save England from that colossal\r\nblunder. Not that he objected to war with the oppressor of the Poles.\r\nBut a war, which might have been a crusade for the downtrodden peoples\r\nof the East, had ranged England, once the champion of liberty, on the\r\nside of Turkey and Austria. The alliance with the tyrant of Italy and\r\nHungary \"took from the war whatever made it sacred in the eyes of God\r\nand man.\" It pledged English backing for the evilest of Continental\r\ndespotisms. It robbed the war of any principle, and \"war is the\r\ngreatest of crimes, when it is not waged for the benefit of mankind,\r\nfor the sake of a great truth to enthrone or of a great lie to\r\nentomb.\" He \"bowed before\" the heroism of the army, \"the quiet,\r\nsilent devotedness, with which the nation accepts all the sacrifices\r\ninseparable from a war\"; but \"the policy of your war,\" he said, \"is\r\nabsolutely immoral, how can you hope for victory?\" How different had\r\nit been, had England avoided the dishonouring touch of Austria, and\r\nsought her ally in a Polish revolution.\r\n\r\nMazzini's interest in English society and politics was, like\r\neverything else except his friendships, turned to the use of his own\r\ncountry. He expected three results from his English propagandism,--to\r\nsecure for Italy the moral support of English opinion and the English\r\npress, to influence the foreign policy of the country in her favour,\r\nand to obtain money for his insurrectionary schemes. He worked on the\r\ntraditional sympathy for Italy, and tried to turn it from its belief\r\nin Piedmont to his own revolutionary and democratic programme. He\r\nappealed to the anti-Papal feeling of the country, and played on the\r\ntheme that a free Italy would allow fair play for Protestant missions.\r\nWith men of the Manchester School he argued that free trade would\r\nfollow free government; with the working classes he spoke of the\r\ncommon interests of working men the world over. His own friends he\r\nconstantly enlisted in his schemes, and made large levies on their\r\nprivate purses. \"It makes my hair stand on end,\" said one of them--a\r\nwell-known politician--afterwards, \"to think of what I did at the\r\nsuggestion of that man.\" Public opinion he hoped to influence through\r\nthe Society of the Friends of Italy, founded in the autumn of 1851 by\r\nthe men, who had promoted the People's International League four years\r\nbefore,--James Stansfeld, Peter Taylor, William Ashurst, William\r\nShaen. Some of the best English Liberals of the day were on the\r\ncommittee,--William Byles of Bradford, Joseph Cowen, George Dawson,\r\nJohn Forster, W. E. Forster, J. A. Froude, G. J. Holyoake, William\r\nHowitt, Douglas Jerrold, Walter Savage Landor, G. H. Lewes, W. J.\r\nLinton, David Masson, Edward Miall, Professor Newman. Mazzini\r\ngenerally, if not always, spoke at their annual meetings,--with\r\nintense nervousness, for he was not yet sufficient master of English\r\nto speak it fluently, and he \"could not think without a pen in his\r\nhand.\" \"I cannot understand people,\" he writes, \"who can prepare a\r\nspeech or article walking up and down their room or garden. I could\r\nwalk about a day without an idea entering my head.\" His speeches, none\r\nthe less, seem to have been eloquent and successful, his manner being,\r\nas the newspapers reported, \"most exciting.\" The Society suspended\r\nwork, when the Crimean War broke out, and was re-constituted again at\r\nthe end of 1856. As far as money went, Mazzini got less than he hoped\r\nfrom his English agitation. A few friends gave generously, but there\r\nwas little of the response that came to Garibaldi's appeal a few years\r\nlater. But the Society did much to win English opinion, if not for\r\nMazzini's own special schemes, at all events for the bigger question\r\nof Italian liberty. The _Leader_, the _Daily News_, the _Morning\r\nAdvertiser_ opened their columns, and did something to counteract the\r\nanti-Italian bias of the _Times_. In 1857 a fairly vigorous agitation,\r\nespecially in the North and Scotland, carried on the work that\r\nKossuth's meetings had begun, and roused a vehement popular feeling\r\nagainst Austria.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] I owe these particulars to one who knew him well, and to a\r\ncontemporary description in a private letter.\r\n\r\n[19] It has often been supposed that Browning had Mazzini in mind,\r\nwhen he wrote _The Italian in England_. I know of no evidence for or\r\nagainst this; but the poem was written in 1845, when the\r\nletter-opening affair had made Mazzini prominently public. Mazzini is\r\nsaid to have made a translation of it.\r\n\r\n[20] See below, pp. 359-360.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nMazzini and Cavour\r\n\r\n1850-1857. AETAT 45-52.\r\n\r\n     The Piedmontese School--Mazzini and Cavour--The French\r\n     alliance--Mazzini and Manin--The theory of the\r\n     dagger--Conspiracies--The Genoese plot of 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is painful to turn from Mazzini in England, the great-hearted\r\nfriend, the prophetic thinker, the generous worker in the cause of\r\nman, to his political action in Italy. Had he yielded to the advice of\r\nsome of his friends and left politics at this time for literature, his\r\nfame were brighter and his life more fruitful in pure good. His work\r\nfor Italy was done; he had conquered it for more than half his creed.\r\nHalf its best men had been nurtured on his writings, had learned from\r\nhim to believe in independence and unity, though still they spoke of\r\nunity in whispers, and he himself knew not how far opinion had\r\nadvanced. The day of conspiracy had passed; free Piedmont was slowly\r\nmarshalling the forces of the nation for another and decisive war. The\r\nrepublic became impossible on the day, when Victor Emmanuel swore\r\nloyalty to the constitution, and thereby proclaimed himself champion\r\nof Italian aspirations. The one thing needful was to rally every\r\nsection of patriots to the one possible flag. To attack the monarchy\r\nnow only hurt the bigger issue, lost sight of the great goal in mists\r\nof schism, brought bitterness and dissension where discipline was all\r\nimportant for the day of trial. No one was more insistent than Mazzini\r\non the need of discipline, but in practice he conditioned it in these\r\nyears by being himself leader. One who found it so difficult to\r\ncompromise, could hardly follow.\r\n\r\nHad Mazzini thought the republic the more important issue, his action\r\nwould at least have been consistent. But he had deliberately set unity\r\nabove it, and independence from Austria above either. A saner\r\npolitician would have been silent on the minor question. But Mazzini\r\ncould never long repress his republican teaching. It was partly that,\r\nsave in moments of comparative lucidity, he convinced himself that\r\nPiedmont would never make a cast for unity, that the Austrians could\r\nnot be expelled but by a great rising of the people. Had he gauged\r\nItalian sentiment more accurately, he would have spared himself the\r\nerror, would have lost his deep distrust in Piedmont and its king, his\r\nbitter animosity to Cavour, his pitiable exaggeration of the strength\r\nof his own party. But an exile lives in necessary half-knowledge. The\r\ngovernment of Piedmont, as exclusive and intolerant as himself, barred\r\nfrom wholesome activity in his own land the man, who, had he been at\r\nTurin in daily contact with men of other parties, would have been a\r\nmighty force for good; and to them, more than to Mazzini himself,\r\nbelongs the pity of his wasted patriotism. Not but what in any\r\ncircumstances Mazzini found it hard to recognize new facts. The\r\nprophet is by nature inflexible; and Mazzini's whole creed was a thing\r\nof such passionate intensity, each part had twisted itself so\r\ninextricably round the rest, that it cost a wrench to part with any\r\ndetail. \"I may, of course, be mistaken,\" he wrote of his political\r\ncreed, \"but mine is a matter of deep conviction, and it is impossible\r\nfor me to modify or alter it.\" He was incapable of taking advice; if\r\nmen differed from him, he assailed them bitterly instead of examining\r\nthe reasons for their dissent. And the partisan, that was always\r\nlatent in him, grew till it obscured the statesman. He who was so\r\ninsistent that no one had a right to set his own opinions above the\r\npeople's common sense, was the last to bow to the popular verdict,\r\nwhen it declared against himself. Henceforth Mazzini was more foe than\r\nfriend to his own ideals. Much he still did to stir his countrymen to\r\nstrenuous and high-thinking patriotism. Though he aimed beyond their\r\nken, he shot more high than all the politicians. But in the great\r\nmarch he broke the ranks, and made the task more difficult for men,\r\nwho, with a patriotism as true and with a saner strategy, had set\r\ntheir faces for the same high goal.\r\n\r\nRetirement was however impossible for a man of Mazzini's temperament.\r\nHe was too feverishly impatient for his country's salvation to only\r\nstand and wait. Inaction seemed treachery to the cause of\r\nrighteousness. Both in public and private life he insisted that\r\n\"thought and action\" must go hand in hand, that a man had no right to\r\nconfine his energies to literature and decline his part in practical\r\npolitical work. He criticized intolerantly the men in Italy, who wrote\r\npatriotic literature instead of plotting insurrection. \"Actions,\" he\r\nsaid, \"are the books of the masses,\" especially in a country where\r\nthe majority were illiterate. He in fact, like every other patriot,\r\nwas maddened by the savage tyranny, with which the Austrians and the\r\nPope and the King of Naples were scourging his unhappy country,--\"the\r\ninsolent triumph of brute force, the exile and death of our brothers\r\nin two-thirds of Europe, the long weeping of their sisters and\r\nmothers, the lying, the espionage, the corruption, the cry of the\r\noppressed masses, the teaching of those who fight and die in silence,\r\nthe shame that makes us blush for those who submit and sell themselves\r\nin despair.\" \"Such a state of things,\" he wrote to an English friend\r\nafter the Mantuan executions, \"cannot last, must not last. It is far\r\nbetter to die in a supreme glorious battle, fought under the eye of\r\nGod with our national banner unfurled, than to see the best of our\r\nland falling one by one under the axe of the executioner.\" It were sin\r\nto wait, and he saw no need for waiting. He was right of course in his\r\nbelief that a nation, which had once so nearly won its freedom, would\r\ntry for it again. \"The dreams of violence,\" he said, \"are brief, and\r\ninfallible the triumph of a people, that hopes and fights and suffers\r\nfor justice and holy liberty.\" He had persuaded himself that the\r\nmasses were only waiting for a signal to rise and throw themselves on\r\nAustria. As so often in his logic, the thing ought to be and therefore\r\nmust be. He knew indeed that he could not count on the middle classes\r\nfor insurrection. The men, who had been the strength of Young Italy,\r\nhad gone over almost in mass to the Piedmontese School, and he did not\r\nspare them his reproaches. But he hoped in the working men. While the\r\nModerates hardly noticed them, he saw what stuff lay in the despised\r\nand misunderstood Italian artisans. But he exaggerated his influence\r\nwith them. \"They are mine, devotedly mine, to blindness.\" Individuals,\r\nindeed, among them he won, as he won men of every class, by his\r\nsimple, noble earnestness. But except in and round Genoa their numbers\r\nat this time were few.\r\n\r\nIt was an impossible policy. It had nearly succeeded in 1848, when\r\nEurope was in flames, but Mazzini would not see how radically\r\ncircumstances had changed. There was no serious hope now that a\r\ngeneral movement of European democracy would divide the forces of\r\nAustria; and his efforts to bring together again the democrats of\r\ndifferent countries, especially of Italy and Hungary, had no results,\r\nat all events till in after years. The resuscitation of Austria, the\r\nevidence of her military strength, the Second Empire in France, the\r\nresignation of Palmerston, the collapse of the German democrats had\r\nkilled any early hope of a successful war, even though all the armed\r\nstrength of the nation, regular armies and volunteers alike, were put\r\ninto it. It was true that the nation could win its freedom even now,\r\nif it sought it at all cost, if it were willing to face the awful\r\nsacrifice,--the mowing down of the undisciplined levies, the wasting\r\nof the country,--and fight through defeat to victory. But Mazzini's\r\nhopes shipwrecked on the fact,--and bitterly he came to recognize\r\nit,--that the Italians, like most other peoples, were not a nation of\r\nmartyr-heroes, that the peasants had little active patriotism, that\r\nthousands in other classes cared more for church than country, that\r\neven among the rest there was little of the grim tenacity of\r\nAmericans or Dutch or of the fierce unconquerableness of Greeks and\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nIt was this that gave the Piedmontese party its justification. Timid\r\nand conservative as it often was, it at all events recognized facts.\r\nIt saw that this undisciplined enthusiasm was not business, that in\r\nthe present condition of Europe another national rising meant another\r\nand more terrible disaster, that each little revolt with its miserable\r\nending only tightened the tyranny and damped the patriots, that\r\nPiedmont's first duty was to preserve its own liberty,--no light task\r\nin itself,--that its next was to gather round it all the aspirations\r\nof the country, discipline them and husband them, till the chance came\r\nagain to fight with a probability of victory. The Piedmontese had\r\nlearnt the lessons of 1848-49 very differently from their critic. To\r\nthem discipline was the one essential. Never again must dissension\r\nabout means paralyze the country in front of the enemy. And in the\r\ninterests of union they had small mercy for democratic theories, they\r\nwere prepared to be unfair to opponents and crush minorities. Victor\r\nEmmanuel must be the figure-head of the movement and the Piedmontese\r\nstatesmen its leaders. Theoretically, of course, their policy was a\r\nsmaller one than Mazzini's. It had little of the poetry and idealism\r\nof the movement, which he had helped to inspire. There was no majestic\r\nvision of a people rising in its own spontaneous might and deciding\r\nits destinies in a great national pact. It postulated encroachments on\r\ndemocratic freedom. It was willing to buy alliances by concessions,\r\nthat abated the country's dignity. It veiled the great ideal of\r\nUnity, and sought attainment by slow stages and crooked paths. But,\r\nassuming that independence and unity were the great essentials,--and\r\non this the best men of the party were at one with Mazzini,--it was on\r\nits main lines the only possible policy. And it was a sense of this,\r\nthat rallied the great mass of patriots to the flag of Piedmont, and\r\nleft Mazzini to protest almost alone, a leader without followers.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism of the two schools was typified in Cavour and Mazzini.\r\nThey were very different in temperament:--the one an aristocrat by\r\ntraining, a genial hater of theories, an opportunist content to feel\r\nhis way by little steps, to wait patiently year after year rather than\r\nrisk failure, making success his object, with small scruple as to\r\nmeans or personal honour, so his country stood to gain; the other a\r\nman of greater nature and culture but less capacity, democrat of\r\ndemocrats, distrusting king and nobles and middle classes, passionate\r\nand outspoken in his friendships and his enmities, the uncompromising,\r\ninflexible, restless apostle, who would conquer armies by a principle\r\nof abstract righteousness, too dazzled by the future to see the\r\nmundane obstacles and hard facts about his feet. Cavour had a\r\nsupercilious contempt for Mazzini and his doctrines; he probably\r\nregarded him as a nuisance, and would have gladly seen him shot. His\r\nbusiness was to win Italy, if he could do so without risking overmuch;\r\nbut he was minister of a crown and would do nothing to endanger it. He\r\nhad convinced himself, save at moments of impatient optimism, that\r\nonly through a French alliance could Austria be driven out. For this\r\nhe was willing to humour Louis Napoleon, to stoop to trickery, to be\r\nbrutal to the republicans. He would use the revolutionaries if he\r\ncould, but it must be at their own risk and for the greater glory of\r\nthe monarchy. Cavour, hiding his ideals and working in mists of\r\ndiplomacy, chose to be misunderstood; and it is no wonder that Mazzini\r\ngenerally read him on the surface, and refused to see how much their\r\nprogrammes had in common. To him Cavour's slow patient policy came of\r\nmere weakness and inconstancy of purpose. He thought of him as a timid\r\ndiplomatist, half-leagued with the despotisms, more careful of\r\nconvention than of right, incapable of aspiring to Italy and Rome. It\r\nwas only late in life, that he recognised his statesmanship. He hated\r\nhim as a truckler to Napoleon; he thought that he favoured Napoleon's\r\ncousin, Lucien Murat, for the throne of Naples, that he held the\r\nEmperor's friendship of more account than Italy. He never realised\r\nthat under the careful statesman lay a bold and eager spirit, that at\r\nthe fitting moment might be as revolutionary as himself.\r\n\r\nTwo men of such diverse character could probably have never worked\r\ncordially together. But under other circumstances they might have\r\nhelped and supplemented one another. It was a cruel fate that, owing\r\nto Mazzini's exile and the consequent impossibility of mutual\r\nunderstanding, they should have wasted so much in a bitter and\r\nunnecessary antagonism. Mazzini no doubt had much provocation for his\r\nfixed hostility. He, who had given all for country, was an exile from\r\nthe land he loved, seeing it only in rare and secret visits, stealing\r\nto his mother's grave by night \"like a man bent on a crime,\" his\r\nfollowers persecuted, his apologies suppressed. But he painfully\r\nexaggerated the deficiencies of the rival school. When he asked the\r\nPiedmontese government, \"Are you with Austria or against her?\" when he\r\nbranded the royalists as being, \"next to Austria, the great obstacle\r\nto Italian freedom,\" he showed a partisan's unwillingness or\r\nincapacity to grasp the facts. His watch, in Giusti's phrase, had\r\nstopped at 1848; and he could not see how radically Cavour and the new\r\nKing had changed the spirit of Piedmontese policy. Victor Emmanuel, he\r\nconfidently asserted, though \"better than his ministers,\" \"neither\r\nwishes to be nor can be King of Italy\"; it was \"an absolute\r\nimpossibility\" that he would try, unless compelled, to win Italian\r\nfreedom. Mazzini was on sounder ground, when he fulminated against the\r\nFrench alliance. Others besides him foresaw the difficulty of\r\nreconciling Louis Napoleon's timidity with Italian aspirations, the\r\nrecurring temptation to duplicity, if Italian statesmen had to quiet\r\nhis suspicions and fears. He well said that it stained the name of\r\nItaly to seek salvation from the man who had crushed the Roman\r\nRepublic and made the _coup d'état_. But Mazzini never faced the hard\r\nfact, that no otherwise could Austria be driven out. And his blindness\r\ngrew partly out of the sheer personal hatred of the Emperor, which he\r\ndid not attempt to conceal. Only in later years he came to see at all,\r\nand never fully, that Louis Napoleon, however timidly, wished to\r\nremodel Europe on his own principle of nationality. He never\r\nunderstood how real was the Emperor's good-will to Italy, how far his\r\nforeign policy outstripped his people's. He thought he had first-hand\r\ninformation as to Napoleon's schemes, and the first-hand information\r\nwas always incomplete and misleading. Nor were his antipathies limited\r\nto the Emperor. \"My antagonism to the French,\" he writes in 1850,\r\n\"grows stronger every day.\" He had a bitter controversy with Louis\r\nBlanc and the French socialists. But, strangely, he had no word of\r\ncondemnation for the French Catholics, who had prompted the expedition\r\nto Rome and were ever pulling back Napoleon in his more generous\r\ndesigns. At a later time, at all events, he quite underrated their\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nWas compromise with Piedmont impossible? Daniel Manin, the republican\r\nTriumvir at Venice in 1849, whose rule there stands out with Mazzini's\r\nown at Rome as one of the most brilliant pages in the history of the\r\ncentury, founded in these years a National Society, with a unitarian\r\nbut royalist programme. He recognised with the Piedmontese politicians\r\nthe need of discipline, and that discipline could only come by\r\naccepting Victor Emmanuel as nominal leader. But he conditioned his\r\nconversion to royalism by the King's acceptance of Unity. \"Make\r\nItaly,\" he wrote to him, \"and we are with you; if not, not.\" Manin\r\nhoped to win Mazzini to his programme. He, like him, had been a\r\nrepublican; he was a man of noblest private life, of sincerest\r\npatriotism; he was striving earnestly for Unity; he fretted almost as\r\nmuch as did Mazzini himself at Cavour's slow manoeuvring. Why should\r\nnot Mazzini abandon his impossible dream of the republic, and work\r\ntogether for the bigger end with a man as democratic as himself?\r\nMazzini refused. All that he would offer was \"the neutral flag\" of\r\n1848,--a promise to leave the settlement of the question between\r\nmonarchy and republic to a future Constituent of the freed nation. The\r\nposition was plausible enough, but there were fatal objections to it.\r\nIt encouraged the federalists to agitate; it must necessarily alienate\r\nthe King; it would make discipline more difficult than ever. And, when\r\nthe country, as Mazzini himself began to recognise, was declaring\r\nunmistakably for the monarchy, to keep the question nominally open was\r\na homage more to the letter than to the spirit of popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a kind of appendix to the controversy, Mazzini had his famous\r\nargument with Manin on \"the theory of the dagger.\" In 1856 Manin wrote\r\nan open letter, attacking the theory as \"the great enemy of Italy.\" He\r\nsent his letter to the _Times_, provoking Mazzini's retort that his\r\n\"sense of personal dignity and respect for his country should have\r\nprevented him from writing to such a paper.\" Manin did not\r\nspecifically mention Mazzini, but the reference was understood, and\r\nMazzini indignantly replied. It is hardly necessary to-day to answer\r\nthe charge that Mazzini encouraged political assassination. He held\r\nindeed that there were rare occasions when it was right,--\"exceptional\r\nmoments in the life and history of nations, not to be judged by normal\r\nrules of human justice, and in which the actors can take their\r\ninspiration only from their conscience and God.\" Tyrannicide was\r\njustifiable, when it was the only means, and the successful means, of\r\nstaying an intolerable oppression. It was a commonplace to glorify\r\nJudith and Brutus and Charlotte Corday; it was hypocrisy, he said,\r\nbegging his own postulates, to condemn for the same actions the men\r\nwho tried to kill Louis Napoleon or Ferdinand of Naples.[21] In every\r\nother case he \"abominated\" political assassination. It is, he says, \"a\r\ncrime, if attempted with the idea of revenge or punishment; a crime\r\nwhen there are other roads to freedom open; culpable and mistaken,\r\nwhen directed against a man, whose tyranny does not descend into the\r\ngrave with him.\" When, for instance, Cavour charged him with plotting\r\nto kill Victor Emmanuel, he indignantly replied that the King's life\r\nwas \"protected, first by the existence of a constitution, next by the\r\nuselessness of the crime.\" With one exception only, he was loyal to\r\nhis profession. Young Italy explicitly abandoned the Carbonaro\r\ntradition of assassinating traitors, and so far as its founder could\r\ncontrol the society, it never sinned against the precept. The forged\r\ncharge of the French government in 1833 that he ordered the murder of\r\nsome spies at Rodez was amply exposed, when Sir James Graham repeated\r\nit in 1845, though the Paris correspondent of the _Times_ was not\r\nashamed to drag the libel up again nineteen years afterwards. When\r\nTriumvir at Rome, Mazzini vigorously repressed the assassinations\r\nthere and at Ancona. He was absolutely ignorant of Orsini's attempt to\r\nassassinate Louis Napoleon, though he disdained to defend himself from\r\nthe suspicion of complicity, partly because he scorned the puny\r\nlibellers of the press, partly because \"Europe needed a bugbear to\r\nfrighten it and his name would do as well as any other.\" The charges\r\nthat he was privy to Tibaldi's and Greco's plots against the Emperor\r\nwere certainly in the latter case, and almost as certainly in the\r\nformer, inventions of the French police. Late in life, he vigorously\r\ndiscouraged plots to assassinate the Pope and Victor Emmanuel, and\r\nstopped another to explode six bombs at a ball given at Venice by the\r\nAustrian Viceroy. In one case only--in early life--Mazzini was in some\r\nsense an accomplice in an assassination plot. In the midst of the\r\npreparations for the Savoy raid, a young Corsican, Antonio\r\nGallenga,[22] who afterwards settled in England and was for some time\r\nspecial correspondent of the _Times_ in Italy, came to him with a plan\r\nto assassinate Charles Albert in revenge for the Genoese executions.\r\nMazzini tried to dissuade him, but at last persuaded himself that\r\nGallenga was an appointed agent of Providence \"to teach despots that\r\ntheir life may depend on the will of a single man.\" He gave Gallenga\r\nthe means of travelling to Turin and sent him a dagger; but he seems\r\nto have given little more thought to the matter, perhaps concluding on\r\nreflection that, as proved to be the case, Gallenga had no stuff in\r\nhim for the business.[23]\r\n\r\nManin's indictment aimed equally at the use of the knife in popular\r\ninsurrections. Mazzini's answer here was easier but less ingenuous in\r\nits applications. It was cant, he properly replied, to call it no\r\nmurder, if a soldier shot an enemy with his rifle, and murder, if an\r\nartisan conspirator stabbed an Austrian soldier with the only weapon\r\nhe possessed. Unfortunately he weakened his argument by extending this\r\ntheory of \"irregular warfare\" to cases, like those of Rossi or\r\nMarinovich, where men had been killed treacherously in revolutionary\r\ntimes for political or private vengeance. Perhaps he was defiantly\r\nexaggerating, for before this he had strongly reprobated Rossi's\r\nmurder; probably he did not know the facts of Marinovich's case. It\r\nwould at all events be very hard to justify him, when he commissioned\r\nOrsini to find men to surprise and kill the Austrian officers at Milan\r\nas the first step in an insurrection. It was no lower in its ethics\r\nthan some established rules of war, but it came sadly below his own\r\nmore noble estimate of the sacredness of human life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile Mazzini's theories kicked against the pricks, his political work\r\nof these years is a pitiable tale of noble effort all in vain, of high\r\npurpose spoilt by obstinacy and incapacity. In the autumn of 1850 he\r\nfounded a National Italian Committee, which claimed to be a kind of\r\nlegal successor to the Assembly of the Roman Republic. Practically,\r\nthough not ostensibly, it was a republican organisation. \"The\r\nmanifesto is moderate,\" Mazzini wrote privately to Italy, \"but behind\r\nthe manifesto am I, which means, I think, the republic.\" The ambiguity\r\ndoomed it from the start. The straiter republicans attacked it as\r\ndeparting from the faith. The much vaster host of democrats, who were\r\nlearning to believe in the Piedmontese monarchy, held carefully aloof.\r\nOthers revolted at Mazzini's \"intolerable dictatorship\"; and the\r\ncharge was half a true one. He proudly and sincerely replied to the\r\ntaunt of personal ambition, but now, as always, he exacted an\r\nimpossible obedience from his fellow-workers. In Italy the society\r\nfound a certain following; and Mazzini boasted half-seriously to his\r\nfriends that the republican flag would be flying on the Quirinal next\r\nyear. But outside some of the Lombard towns the movement had little\r\nreal strength; its organisation was too loose to be effective; and one\r\nby one the exiles on the Committee drifted away, till in 1853 it died\r\na natural death. The same fate befell a \"National Loan,\" which he had\r\nstarted with the ambitious hope of raising an adequate fund for\r\ninsurrection. He issued bonds, which were to be honoured by the future\r\nItalian state. It was to be \"the first act of a financial war, which\r\nwould prove that the few monarchical or aristocratic possessors of big\r\ncapitals can be matched by the collective power of the small capitals\r\nof democracy.\" Apparently a good many of the bonds were taken up in\r\nItaly, but the money they brought in seems to have been soon exhausted\r\nin the expenses of agitation and conspiracy.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Mazzini had been inclined to postpone insurrection,\r\ntill, at all events in his own judgment, it had a fair prospect of\r\nsuccess. Unluckily at this moment he was approached by a revolutionary\r\nsociety among the artisans at Milan. He was hesitating whether to\r\nencourage them to action, when the ruthless execution by the Austrians\r\nof some conspirators at Mantua maddened the men, and they decided on\r\nrevolt whether he supported them or not. He was very anxious about the\r\nscheme and far from hopeful, but he was too generous and impatient to\r\nrefuse help now. He did what he could to find them money and\r\nsympathisers, and late in 1852 he went in disguise to Locarno to\r\ncomplete the preparations. The rising was fixed for the Carnival on\r\nFebruary 6, and on the eve of it Mazzini was on the frontier at\r\nChiasso, ready to go on to Milan, as soon as the call came. Had the\r\nrising been better organized, it had some small chance of success. As\r\nit was, Mazzini learnt at Chiasso that it had smoked itself out in a\r\nconfused and bloody scuffle. The business was disastrous to him, and\r\nhe came out with reputation badly damaged. The responsibility was\r\nfixed on him, and he accepted it, though he had only been drawn into a\r\nplan that others made. His friends in Italy had published a\r\ntwo-years-old appeal from Kossuth urging the Hungarian regiments in\r\nthe garrison to revolt, and whether or not Kossuth authorized its\r\npublication now, had made unjustifiable alterations in the wording.\r\nMazzini was responsible, if at all, only in not taking precautions to\r\nprevent the issue, but he did not make matters better, when he pleaded\r\nthat men, who were risking their lives for their country, were \"not\r\namenable by strictly punctilious rules of normal times.\"[24] The\r\nfatuousness and mismanagement of the whole business, the pity of the\r\nwasted lives, a feeling that these ill-judged risings hindered the\r\ncause and damaged it in the eyes of Europe, hastened the stampede from\r\nhis own party. He still kept a considerable though reduced hold on\r\nthe artisans in a few towns of the North, but among the middle classes\r\nhis following shrank to nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nEven he almost despaired. He felt himself \"accursed by all,\" the\r\n\"scapegoat on whom all the faults of Israel will be heaped with a\r\ncurse.\" The Piedmontese press loaded him with shameful scurrility; and\r\nthere seems to have been an attempt to assassinate him. He fretted\r\nwith the sense of failure, with something like remorse at the\r\nsufferings of the conspirators under the Austrians' brutal vengeance.\r\nBut instead of taking the moral of the failure home, he broke into\r\ninvective against the Piedmontese, and only plunged more desperately\r\ninto schemes of insurrection. He had been misled into suspecting an\r\nunderstanding between France and Piedmont to create French\r\nprotectorates in the South and Centre; and he was eager to checkmate\r\nit by forcing on the movement for unity and a revolutionary war with\r\nAustria. He had two main plans of operation. For one, the\r\nrevolutionising of South Italy, he could, though anxious for immediate\r\naction, at present only sow the seed. The other was to organise\r\nguerilla fighting in the Alps and Northern Apennines and encourage the\r\nLombard cities to revolt. He had persuaded himself that the\r\nfast-maturing Eastern question gave a favourable chance of attacking\r\nAustria. Her policy of see-saw between the Western Powers and Russia\r\nhad won her the ill-will of both sides, and she had been obliged to\r\ndenude her Italian garrisons to concentrate troops on the Russian\r\nfrontier. Mazzini had vague hopes, too, of help from America.\r\nKossuth's lecturing tour in the States in 1852 had excited an angry\r\nfeeling against Austria. The American government was irritated by the\r\nunfriendly attitude of France and England, and perhaps had its designs\r\non Cuba; and Mazzini hoped that it would encourage the revolutionary\r\nforces in Europe, in order to keep the Powers occupied at home. George\r\nN. Sanders, the American Consul in London, gave a dinner to him and\r\nKossuth and Ledru Rollin, and healths were drunk to a future alliance\r\nof America with a federation of the free peoples of Europe.[25]\r\nMazzini's hopes were high. He studied military maps with Kossuth and\r\nLedru Rollin at St John's Wood. He went to Paris and Italy in 1854 in\r\ndisguise, probably spending most of his time at Genoa, and perhaps on\r\nhis way paying a visit to Giuditta Sidoli, now silver-haired, and\r\nsweet and gracious as ever. His movements worried all the police of\r\nItaly and France and Switzerland, and his secret journeys had their\r\nromance of clever disguises and audacious escapes. A popular rhyme of\r\nthe time, attributed to Dall'Ongaro, said:--\r\n\r\n     Where is Mazzini? Ask the pines\r\n     Upon the Alps and Apennines.\r\n     He is, wherever traitors cower\r\n     In terror for their fatal hour;\r\n     Where'er men wait impatiently\r\n     To give their blood for Italy.\r\n\r\nMazzini wrote home to England that the people were fretting for\r\naction, and would have risen already, \"had he not been exceptionally\r\nprudent and calm\"; in two months more he hoped to have sapped the\r\ninfluence of the royalists, and then \"the field will be mine.\" In\r\nAugust he was in the Engadin, arranging for insurrection in the\r\nValtellin and the Como hill country. But the Swiss police broke up the\r\nconspirators, and Mazzini narrowly escaped capture as he came by the\r\nJulier diligence to Chur.\r\n\r\nHis hopes of Austrian isolation were soon dashed. Austria nominally\r\njoined the Western alliance, and Piedmont followed her into it and\r\nsent a contingent to the Crimea. He was bitterly disappointed, and\r\nrelieved himself in angry criticisms on English and Piedmontese\r\npolicy. Against Piedmont he turned with sheer passionate bitterness.\r\nCavour's adhesion to the alliance puzzled his own followers; and even\r\nnow it is not easy to be sure as to its wisdom, still less as to its\r\nmorality. But at all events everyone else recognised that the Crimea\r\nwas intended to be \"the road to Lombardy.\" Mazzini, blinded by his\r\npartisanship, saw only proof that Cavour's sympathies were more with\r\nthe oppressors than the oppressed.\r\n\r\nFor the moment all seemed to him a hopeless blank. His soul was\r\n\"wasting in a decline,\" and he longed to find mechanical work to drug\r\nthe pain, or break into some desperate action. \"I am dreaming of,\r\nraving, raging about action, physical action,\" he wrote. \"I am sick of\r\nthe world and all its concerns, and want to _protest_.\" \"Literally,\"\r\nhe wrote to another friend, \"life weighs on me. My feeling towards my\r\ncountry, right or wrong, is intolerable. If I were younger, I would be\r\non a mountain to protest, with twenty or thirty more. As I am, I can\r\nonly eat myself away, and pretend to smile, to avoid torturing\r\nothers.\" Next year (1856) his hopes suddenly revived. There seemed a\r\nchance that Cavour would secretly assist an insurrection against the\r\nDuke of Modena in the Carrara country. Through this and the two\r\nfollowing years the premier had intermittent plans to foment a rising\r\nthere, which would lead to annexation of the borderland, or be twisted\r\ninto a _casus belli_ with Austria and force Louis Napoleon to send his\r\narmy across the Alps. He allowed Mazzini to visit Genoa, and carried\r\non communications with him there. What were the details of the plot,\r\nwe have no means of knowing; but at all events it was impossible to\r\ncome to terms. \"The Piedmontese government,\" Mazzini wrote to England,\r\n\"are a plague. I am indirectly in contact with them and trying all\r\nsorts of concessions, but it is of no use. My own position is\r\nextremely delicate and difficult between their party and the extreme\r\nmen of our own. I have now sent a sort of ultimatum to them, which\r\nwill compromise them, if accepted, or leaves me free, if not.\" When\r\nthe rupture came, he turned to his plans for revolutionising the\r\nSouth. For two years past he had been industriously connecting the\r\nthreads of conspiracy, that Crispi and others had laid in Sicily and\r\nNaples. He had met Garibaldi in London, and discussed plans with him\r\nfor an expedition to the island; and Garibaldi had promised to go, if\r\nthe Sicilians revolted and Cavour was willing to cooperate. Again\r\nthere seemed a hope that the premier would secretly assist. Every\r\npatriot saw the danger of Napoleon's fitful scheme to put his cousin,\r\nLucien Murat, on the throne of Naples; and Cavour, though he dared not\r\nopenly oppose, would gladly see the scheme checkmated, and he had his\r\nown plans for adding Sicily to Victor Emmanuel's kingdom. He seems to\r\nhave promised funds for Mazzini's design, but again from some\r\nunexplained cause he drew back. Mazzini refused to give up his\r\nscheme, and indeed the Genoese conspirators were too impatient for\r\naction to desist, whether he wished it or not. He went to England to\r\nraise money for the project, and returned to Genoa to mature it. Carlo\r\nPisacane, his friend and fellow-exile, a Neapolitan duke with\r\nsocialist theories that little accorded with his own, was to seize a\r\nsteamer plying between Genoa and Sardinia, and make for Calabria,\r\nthere to join hands with the insurgents in the South and raise the\r\ncountry in the name of Unity. The plot was linked to a more\r\nquestionable plan. It was proposed that the conspirators, who stayed\r\nbehind, should seize the forts at Genoa and Leghorn and obtain\r\nmunitions to send on to Pisacane. Mazzini realised the peril of the\r\nbusiness, the risk of civil war, the certainty that the movement would\r\nbe understood as one for the republic rather than for unity. But he\r\neasily allowed himself to be persuaded into it. It would, he thought,\r\nat all events prove the solidarity of North and South, force on a war\r\nwith Austria, and prevent the French alliance; and he had a hardly\r\navowed hope that the movement might after all make for a republic. So,\r\ntaking careful precautions to avoid reprisals on the Genoese\r\nconservatives, and prevent if possible a conflict with the troops, he\r\nthrew himself into the mad plot. Pisacane seized the _Cagliari_, and\r\nwent to his doom. Mazzini, finding that the government had scent of\r\nthe design on the forts, tried to stop it at the last moment; but it\r\nwas too late, and the fatuous attempt ended in some street fighting\r\nand a little loss of life. The government struck at its\r\nfellow-conspirators of a few months back with a severity, that did\r\nlittle credit to its honesty. It deliberately misrepresented the\r\nmovement as anarchist. Mazzini and five more, who escaped, were\r\nsentenced in contumacy to death; others were sent to long terms of\r\nimprisonment. Mazzini took refuge in the house of the Marquis Ernesto\r\nPareto, a relative of the minister of 1848, who concealed him\r\nsuccessfully, though the police searched his house and probed the\r\nmattresses and the Marchioness' wardrobes with their swords. The story\r\nwent that Mazzini, disguised as a footman, opened the door to the\r\npolice-officer who proved to be an old school-fellow and probably\r\nrecognised him. Some days after he walked out of the house without\r\ndisguise, arm-in-arm with a Genoese lady, asked the sentry for a light\r\nfor his cigar, and drove away unsuspected to Quarto, where he remained\r\nin safe hiding, till the news of Pisacane's disaster reached him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Walter Savage Landor wrote to one of Mazzini's friends, promising\r\n£95 for the family \"of the first patriot, who asserts the dignity and\r\nfulfils the duty of tyrannicide.\"\r\n\r\n[22] _Alias_ Luigi Mariotti, writer of Italian grammar books for\r\nEnglish schools.\r\n\r\n[23] For some of the evidence on these cases, I may refer to my\r\n_History of Italian Unity_, II. 385-387. See also Uccellini,\r\n_Memorie_, 209-210; Mazzini, _Lettere ad A. Giannelli_, 301, 437.\r\nSignor Dagnino tells me from his personal knowledge that in 1864\r\nMazzini stopped a plot to blow up the Austrian Viceroy of Venetia.\r\n\r\n[24] Mazzini's and Kossuth's letters on the subject are in the _Daily\r\nNews_ of February 19, March 2 and 4, 1853. See also Mazzini,\r\n_Scritti_, VIII. 283-4. He seems to have made a disingenuous use of\r\nanother proclamation by Kossuth later in the year: see Bianchi,\r\n_Vicende del Mazzinianismo_, 85. I hardly think that Mr Stillman's\r\nstatement in his _Union of Italy_, p. 275, can stand against Kossuth's\r\nplain statement in the _Daily News_. Mr Stillman too is wrong as to\r\nMazzini's share in the rising. I am inclined on the whole to think\r\nthat he was justified in using Agostino's name; see _Daily News_,\r\nFebruary 17 and 20, 1853.\r\n\r\n[25] Mr W. R. Thayer has kindly ascertained for me that there is\r\nabsolutely nothing in Sanders' correspondence in the U.S.A. Bureau of\r\nRolls, that relates either to Mazzini or Kossuth; but Saffi, who tells\r\nthe story of the dinner, was present at it himself. See Mazzini,\r\n_Scritti_, IX. xciv, 60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nUnity Half Won\r\n\r\n1858-1860.

He recognised how strongly the tide was setting towards\r\nthe royalists, but he still thought he had the working classes with\r\nhim. Cavour's double play and the cruel repression of the Genoese plot\r\nleft him bitterer than ever against the monarchy and its men. \"I have\r\nnever loved you,\" he wrote in an open letter to the premier; \"now I\r\ndespise you.\" He attacked more angrily still the fast-cementing\r\nalliance with France. The Emperor was maturing his plans to drive the\r\nAustrians out of Italy. It was not, as Mazzini thought, mere policy\r\nalone that moved him. No doubt, his waning prestige at home, and the\r\nfear that another Orsini might arise, both had their influence; but he\r\nwas still true in a way to his nationalist ideals, and since he had\r\nsacrificed Poland to the Russian alliance, he was the more eager to\r\nfree Italy and Hungary. Mazzini, through his private channels of\r\ninformation, was among the first to have an inkling of the compact\r\nbetween Cavour and the Emperor at Plombières, but, as usual, his\r\ninformation was inaccurate. He believed, quite wrongly, as we know\r\nnow, that they had agreed to leave Venetia to Austria and give Central\r\nItaly to Prince Napoleon, and that Cavour had offered to surrender the\r\nparliamentary liberties of Piedmont as the price of Lombardy; he had\r\nno knowledge that Napoleon had promised that half the Pope's territory\r\nshould pass to Victor Emmanuel's crown.\r\n\r\nEvents moved fast. In the spring of 1859, thanks to Cavour's\r\nunscrupulous but supremely skilful diplomacy, war was imminent, and\r\nall Italy was fretting for it. Cavour was hardy and shrewd enough to\r\nuse the revolutionary elements, on whose value Mazzini had laid\r\ninsistent stress. The volunteers flocked to Piedmont with Garibaldi\r\nfor their general, and, except for Mazzini and Crispi and a stranded\r\nhandful, the republicans declared definitely for Victor Emmanuel's\r\nleadership. Even Mazzini was sometimes carried by the tide. He told\r\nhis English friends that royalists and republicans were aiming equally\r\nat Unity; he appealed to the Piedmontese statesmen to pronounce for\r\nthe greater policy, and if the French alliance broke down, he was\r\nprepared to support them. But he could not reconcile himself to the\r\nhated Emperor's help. Shutting his eyes to the hard facts, he thought\r\nthat Piedmont could defeat Austria with no other allies than the\r\nhesitating revolutionaries of Hungary. To ask assistance from a despot\r\nblighted the country's self-respect; to win its freedom, save by its\r\nown unaided strength, dishonoured it at the birth; and it were small\r\ngain to change the tyranny of Austria for the domineering patronage of\r\nFrance. \"I am equally hostile to Austria and to Napoleon,\" he wrote;\r\n\"and my double aim is to get rid, if possible, of both.\" When war was\r\ndeclared, Cavour and he both said, \"the die is cast\"; Cavour added,\r\n\"we have made history,\" Mazzini \"we are beaten.\" But when the fighting\r\nbegan, when, in spite of his previsions, the enthusiasm swept through\r\nthe land, and for a moment Louis Napoleon was, next to the king and\r\nGaribaldi, the hero of his countrymen, he could not hold back. Be it\r\nright or wrong, the best must be made of the war; it might yet, in the\r\nend, make Italy. Modena and Parma, Romagna and Tuscany had driven out\r\ntheir princes and declared for Victor Emmanuel's rule. While the\r\narmies were winning Lombardy and Venetia, he wished to see the popular\r\nforces overrun all the Centre and make an end of the Temporal Power.\r\nHe appealed to his friends at Naples to revolutionise the South,\r\nthough he urged that they should not annex themselves to Piedmont,\r\nwhile the war lasted. After Solferino he was very hopeful. \"The\r\nAustrian domination in Italy,\" he said, \"is at an end.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly came the great betrayal of Villafranca. Louis Napoleon,\r\nafraid of defeat in Venetia, afraid of an attack from Prussia,\r\nrepentant of his promises to Cavour, made peace with Austria, and\r\nabandoned Venetia to the enemy and Central Italy to the fugitive\r\nprinces. Mazzini took credit for prophesying it; and what came of the\r\nEmperor's timidity and the real difficulties of the situation, he\r\nregarded as the pre-determined treachery of Plombières. Relying again\r\non his imperfect private information, he thought he had discovered an\r\nunderstanding between France and Russia to partition Europe into\r\nspheres of influence, and that Villafranca was a prelude to a triple\r\nalliance of the three Empires. He fulminated against \"the European\r\n_coup d'état_\"; he appealed to English fears, and preached a league of\r\nEngland, Prussia, and the smaller states in defence of Italian\r\nfreedom. At home he urged a truce to party feeling and the completing\r\nof the work in despite of France and Austria. He voiced the feeling of\r\nthe country. Cavour had resigned in hot anger at the Emperor's\r\ndesertion; but his influence was still very powerful, and he and the\r\nKing and the men, who were at the head of affairs at Florence and\r\nModena, were no less determined than the democrats that at least\r\nCentral Italy should be saved. All through the autumn their obstinate\r\nstand baffled the Emperor's half-hearted veto, and pushed on the\r\nfeeble men, who now held office at Turin. The key of the position was\r\nat Florence, and Ricasoli, the stark Tuscan baron, who was practically\r\ndictator there, believed with a faith as fearless as Mazzini's own\r\nthat Italian Unity, pregnant with mighty issues for the world, was\r\nwritten in the decrees of God. He too detested Napoleon, and was\r\ndetermined not to flinch for all his threats.\r\n\r\nMazzini hurried to Florence, and arrived there early in August. The\r\nPiedmontese government, to its shame, had excluded the greatest of\r\nliving Italians from the amnesty, which it granted at the beginning of\r\nthe war; but Ricasoli allowed Mazzini to remain unmolested, on his\r\nparole that his presence at Florence should not be publicly known.\r\nThere was not a little in common between the two men,--both stainless\r\nin their private lives, brave, honest, single-minded patriots. They\r\nwere, indeed, too uncompromising to work together; but they sincerely\r\nrespected each other, and Ricasoli had none of the narrowness, that\r\nmade the Turin statesmen shrink from contact with a democrat.\r\nMazzini's policy was the same as it had been during the war. The\r\npeople must make the movement as far as possible their own. He\r\naddressed to them a rhapsodical appeal to nerve themselves for the\r\ngreat work. \"You are called,\" he said, \"to a task like the tasks of\r\nGod, the creation of a people.\" The free provinces of the Centre must\r\nhold fast to their freedom. Louis Napoleon, he knew, could not enforce\r\nhis veto; the Powers would accept accomplished facts; the danger of an\r\nAustrian attack he said little of. At heart, though, he knew that the\r\nperils were thicker than he publicly owned, and he confessed in\r\nprivate letters that \"the position was more than difficult,\" that, if\r\nthe suggested Congress of the Powers met and declared in favour of the\r\nexiled princes, Italy could only make an ineffectual \"protest in\r\naction.\" He almost hoped that Napoleon would use force after all, and\r\nthat a war with France would come to simplify the situation.\r\n\r\nWith a good deal of hesitation, he was prepared to support annexation\r\nto Piedmont. He promised to foment no republican agitation, so long as\r\nthe royalists marched towards Unity; and he wrote the King an\r\nirritating but dignified appeal to have done with the subserviency to\r\nFrance and bid openly for the crown of Italy. \"The day you speak this\r\nlanguage,\" he said, \"parties will disappear; there will be only two\r\nliving forces in Italy,--the People and yourself.\" He does not seem\r\nhowever to have really expected to win him. \"The King,\" he wrote\r\nprivately in reference to the letter, \"is wavering and weak, but on\r\nhim I did not reckon.\" Victor Emmanuel appears, though, to have read\r\nthe appeal and taken it to heart, and perhaps it had its influence on\r\nthe events that followed. Mazzini's supreme aim was to spread the\r\nmovement for Unity. If the government would not act, the people must\r\ndo the work themselves. He wanted to make Tuscany and Romagna the base\r\nfor an invasion of the Pope's remaining territory; and then--onward to\r\nNaples and the South. The hope was shared by all the democrats and\r\nmany of the moderates; but with Mazzini it meant something even more\r\nthan Unity. It meant the triumph of religious liberty at Rome, the\r\ndownfall of \"the Vicar of the Genius of Evil,\" the chance that on the\r\nwreck of the Papacy Rome would send forth the gospel of the new\r\nreligion. \"The liberty of Rome,\" he wrote, \"is the liberty of the\r\nworld. If Rome revolts, she must proclaim the victory of God over\r\nIdols, of eternal Truth over Falsehood, the inviolability of the human\r\nconscience.\" He urged his English and German friends to stir public\r\nopinion against the French occupation of Rome, and put pressure on\r\nNapoleon in the name of the principle of non-intervention.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he sent his agents to prepare a Sicilian rising, and\r\nagitated feverishly for an advance of Garibaldi and the troops of the\r\nCentral States into Umbria, which the Papal volunteers had recovered\r\nfrom the nationalists. He had thoughts of leading the invasion\r\nhimself, but he feared that his name \"would frighten the mass of the\r\npeople,\" and he humoured Garibaldi by promising to make him the hero\r\nof the movement and \"abdicating my own individuality, which is the\r\neasiest part.\" He won Farini, the dictator of Modena, once a member of\r\nYoung Italy, to countenance the raid. He tried to win Ricasoli, but\r\nRicasoli, though he had threatened to join hands with Mazzini rather\r\nthan let Tuscany lose its freedom, knew that the dangers of a forward\r\nmovement were too great at present, that if the Pope were attacked,\r\nthe outcry of Catholic Europe would compel Napoleon to withdraw his\r\nindispensable, however irritating, patronage, and that Italy would\r\nfind herself caught in a hopeless single-handed fight with Austria.\r\nHis own strong will and the King's common-sense stopped Garibaldi's\r\nprojects. Mazzini, ignorant of the real position, underrated the\r\ndifficulties in the way; he never realised the strength of Catholic\r\nopinion, he thought that Austria was not in a position to fight, or\r\nthat, if she did, it meant an uprising of all Italy and her eventual\r\ndefeat. He charged the King's veto to mere truckling to Napoleon. But\r\nhe felt his own powerlessness. He was incensed by the harshness, with\r\nwhich the government had treated some of his friends, by the\r\nintolerance that drove himself to live in hiding. \"To be a prisoner\r\namong our own people is too much to bear.\" \"I have never,\" he wrote,\r\n\"felt so wretched and worn out in mind and soul as at certain moments\r\nnow.\" Ricasoli intimated that he must leave Tuscany, and hopeless of\r\ndoing any good there, he left for Lugano and returned to England at\r\nthe end of the year.\r\n\r\nHis ideas had passed to men more competent to execute them. In January\r\nCavour was again prime minister, resolute to have Unity with Rome for\r\nthe capital, prepared, if the Emperor deserted him, to attack Austria,\r\nrouse Hungary in her rear, and, so he hoped in sanguine moments, \"go\r\nto Vienna.\" But he knew how heavy was the stake, and he would keep the\r\nEmperor's protection if he could. When he found that Napoleon would\r\nguarantee the annexation of the free provinces at the price of Nice\r\nand Savoy, he sadly and reluctantly consented to the humiliating\r\nbargain. Mazzini read him by his despatches, and knew nothing of his\r\nreal ambitions. He thought that the premier was opposed to Unity, even\r\nto the annexation of Tuscany, that he clung to the French alliance to\r\nsafeguard himself from democracy at home. He was indignant at the\r\ncession of Savoy, bartered without reference to the wishes of its\r\npeople, still more at the desertion of Italian Nice. He was eager to\r\ndrive from office the man, on whom depended the attainment of his\r\nhopes. He was right, however, in thinking that Cavour could not\r\ninitiate the revolution in the South, that the government would only\r\nfollow up what the free lances began; and he was willing to make the\r\nroad easier for it, by promising, when revolution broke out in the\r\nSouth, to support annexation to Piedmont and leave Rome alone for the\r\npresent. He was persuaded that Austria would not attack, and that the\r\nBourbon army would dissolve or join the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe programme seemed so simple, that he hoped to unite all the\r\ndemocrats upon it. But the saner men among them saw that, as usual,\r\nMazzini had underrated the danger. They knew that it meant harder\r\nfighting than he supposed, and they dreaded a repetition of his\r\nearlier ill-starred risings. They insisted that, if the volunteers\r\nwent to Sicily, Garibaldi must lead them and Cavour's moral support\r\nmust be secured. Mazzini was ready to welcome Garibaldi's leadership,\r\nthough there was no very cordial feeling between them; but he knew how\r\nreluctant Garibaldi was to go, and he refused to let the movement hang\r\non any one man's action. Early in March, while Garibaldi was still\r\nhesitating,[26] he sent Rosalino Pilo, a young Sicilian noble, to lead\r\nthe insurgents in the island, spending every available shilling of his\r\nown in the preparations. He was terribly overwrought and excited, for\r\nhe must have realised something of the tremendous danger and\r\nresponsibility; and he travelled to Lugano to be nearer the scene of\r\naction. There he learnt that his long efforts had had their fruit,\r\nthat the impatience he had done so much to rouse had borne down\r\nGaribaldi's doubts, and that he and his Thousand had started for\r\nSicily. \"God be praised,\" he wrote, \"Italy is not dead.\" When the news\r\ncame of Garibaldi's victory at Calatafimi, \"Sicily saves us,\" he said,\r\n\"Italy will be.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 7, two days after Garibaldi started, he arrived at Genoa, still\r\ncompelled to live in hiding, and able to see his friends only by\r\nnight. Characteristically, he amused himself in leisure moments by\r\ntaming sparrows, which came to him at meal-times, followed by two hens\r\n(\"I have always been fond of hens,\" he writes), \"whom I feed after\r\ndinner, sometimes with bread and wine to strengthen their\r\nconstitutions against shocks and adversities.\" He was not welcomed by\r\nthe men who had organised the expedition, and he found himself\r\nregarded as \"a self-intruding man,\" he who was ever ready to take the\r\nrisk and give others the honour, who was bracing his frail body only\r\nby sheer sense of duty. \"God knows,\" he wrote, \"that morally and\r\nphysically exhausted as I am, everything I do is a real effort.\" But\r\nthe suspicion of his motives was inevitable. Absolutely disinterested\r\nas he was, ever ready to spend and be spent, he was again playing an\r\nill-informed and equivocal part, thrusting in his unwise projects\r\namong the well-laid schemes of shrewder men; and those who had\r\norganised Garibaldi's movement with consummate skill--Bertani and\r\nMedici and Bixio--felt that his independent action might spoil the\r\ngame.[27] He clung to his insensate prejudice against Cavour, at a\r\ntime when Cavour,--with whatever lapse of political morality,--was\r\nstraining every nerve to back Garibaldi and win all Italy. In his\r\npersistent distrust of the government and its connections with the\r\nEmperor, he wanted to act independently of though not in hostility to\r\nthe monarchy, and while he urged annexation in Sicily to checkmate the\r\nseparatists in the island, he was eager to prevent it on the mainland,\r\nand reserved his freedom to preach his own doctrines there. While\r\nGaribaldi snatched victory after victory against tremendous odds in\r\nSicily, he was planning a raid into Papal territory, more or less\r\nunder his own direction; his volunteers, he hoped, would not only free\r\nthe rest of Central Italy and attack the Bourbons from the North, but\r\nwould create an influence, independent alike of Cavour and Garibaldi,\r\nwhich might perhaps in the chapter of accidents upset the monarchy, or\r\nat least compel it to break with France. He did not suspect how\r\nperilous the situation was, that it was still only Louis Napoleon's\r\nprotection, that stood between Italy and a terrible conflict with\r\nAustria in the North and Bourbons in the South, with utter disaster as\r\nits almost certain sequel. Ricasoli and, it seems, the King[28] gave\r\nsome countenance to the raid, for which Mazzini and Bertani were, with\r\nGaribaldi's approval, completing the preparations. But Cavour knew\r\nthat it meant the forfeiture of the Emperor's friendship, and arranged\r\nwith Bertani, who was throughout lukewarm for the scheme, terms which\r\nwould at all events save his own credit with the Emperor. The force,\r\nwhich had been destined for the Papal coast, sailed to join Garibaldi\r\nin Sicily. Mazzini either did not know of the agreement or refused to\r\nbe bound by it; he went to Florence, where another body of volunteers\r\nwas waiting in the neighbourhood ready to cross the frontier, and\r\nintended to lead them to a desperate attack on Perugia. Cavour\r\ninsisted that the men should be disbanded, and Ricasoli, tempering\r\nthe premier's orders, persuaded them to go to Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nLess than a month after, the Piedmontese declared war against the\r\nPope, and Fanti,--Mazzini's follower once in the days of the Savoy\r\nraid,--overran such of the Pope's remaining territory as was not\r\noccupied by the French. Garibaldi, victoriously advancing from the\r\nSouth, had entered Naples, and save for Rome and its neighbourhood and\r\na small district held by the remnants of the Bourbon army, all the\r\nCentre and the South were free. Austria, frightened by Napoleon's\r\nthreats, had been a passive spectator, while her allies were crushed.\r\nItalian Unity was nearly won, but the splendid consummation was dashed\r\nby the dread of civil strife. Garibaldi, careless of obstacles, was\r\nimpatient to march on to Rome; Cavour knew that that meant war with\r\nFrance and would have it at no cost. Crispi and Bertani were trying to\r\norganise the South in an opposition to Cavour and his party, that\r\nmight easily take a republican colour. Mazzini went to Naples, and\r\nwarmly backed them. He urged Garibaldi to go on, though by preference\r\nto Venice rather than to Rome, for he saw now almost as acutely as\r\nCavour did the danger of a conflict with France. If Garibaldi\r\nadvances, he wrote to England, \"we shall have Unity within five\r\nmonths; if he does not, we shall have slumber, then anarchy, then--a\r\nlittle later--Unity.\" He appealed to the Neapolitans to save the\r\nprinciple of popular sovereignty by conditioning their annexation to\r\nVictor Emmanuel's crown with the stipulation that an Italian National\r\nAssembly should meet to draw up a new constitution. The cry was a\r\nfutile and dangerous one, for the mass of the people were impatient\r\nfor annexation on any terms; and with trouble threatening the young\r\ncountry on every side, it were madness to throw its future into the\r\nmelting-pot of the constitution-mongers. It was easy to paint Mazzini\r\nas an enemy of Unity; and a Neapolitan mob shouted 'death' under the\r\nwindows of the man, who had given everything for them. Pallavicino,\r\nthe pro-dictator, Manin's old co-worker and Garibaldi's friend,\r\ncourteously appealed to him to leave. \"Even against your wish,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you divide us.\" Mazzini refused to waive an Italian's right to\r\nlive on Italian soil; and he was molested no more. Garibaldi\r\nindignantly intervened on his behalf; the King probably protected him.\r\n\"Leave Mazzini alone,\" he had said, \"if we make Italy, he is\r\npowerless; if we cannot, let him do it, and I will be _Monsù Savoia_\r\nand clap my hands for him.\" But Mazzini was bitterly pained and weary\r\nof it all. \"I am worn out morally and physically,\" he wrote; \"for\r\nmyself the only really good thing would be to have unity achieved\r\nquickly through Garibaldi, and one year before dying of Walham\r\nGreen[29] or Eastbourne, long silences, a few affectionate words to\r\nsmooth the ways, plenty of sea-gulls, and sad dozing.\" Early in\r\nNovember, after a friendly interview with Garibaldi, at which they\r\nlaid their schemes for winning Rome and Venice, he left Naples.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The following letter from Garibaldi has, I believe, not been\r\npublished: I have translated it.\r\n\r\n     CAPRERA, _March 27, '60_.\r\n\r\nDEAR MAZZINI,--I am thinking of leaving for Genoa on April 1, from\r\nthere I shall go to Nice, where I am summoned by my fellow-citizens,\r\nwho are afraid of falling into the wolf's mouth. I enclose two lines\r\nfor McAdam [Mr John McAdam of Glasgow]. If you come, let me\r\nknow.--Your brother, GIUSEPPE.\r\n\r\n_P.S._--Mr Adam of Glasgow will send Mr William Ashurst a sum for the\r\nMillion Rifles Fund; please spend it in the purchase of the rifles in\r\nquestion.--G. GARIBALDI.\r\n\r\n[27] Rival funds for Mazzini and Garibaldi were collected in England\r\nand there was some strong feeling between their respective backers.\r\n\r\n[28] According to a letter from Mazzini to Brofferio, published in\r\n_Roma e Venezia_, January 15, 1861, (the full text of which I have not\r\nseen), the King seems to have asked for an interview with him, and he\r\nhad \"no shadow of difficulty in principle\" to it.\r\n\r\n[29] Where Mr Stansfeld had his brewery and sometimes lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nFor Venice\r\n\r\n1861-1866. AETAT 56-61.\r\n\r\n     Policy after 1860--Disappointment in Italy--Rome and\r\n     Venice--Attitude towards the monarchy--Life in England--the\r\n     Greco plot--American and Irish politics--Mazzini and\r\n     Garibaldi--Overtures from Victor Emmanuel--The war of 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nMazzini's remaining life is one of melancholy pathos. He could not\r\nrest, till Unity was accomplished. Aged and often very ill and\r\nsuffering, longing for quiet and literature, he braced his frail body\r\nand unhappy soul to the fret and weariness and disillusioning of\r\npolitics. Could one be sure that it profited country or mankind, one\r\nwould rest content, knowing that he had chosen the hard path and never\r\nflinched. But it was--at all events in the near results--a grievous\r\nwaste. Those splendid faculties were worn, as he would sometimes own\r\nhimself, in rolling the stone of Sisyphus. Had he given these years to\r\nthe book on religion, that he ever kept in mind, to building up \"the\r\nchurch of the precursors,\" he might perhaps have done a thing yet\r\ngreater than the making of Italy. His political work henceforth was\r\nmostly thrown away; for, as he said, his star was the Dog, and his\r\nbusiness \"to bark, generally without being heard.\" Gloriously right in\r\nhis ideals, he marred it all by ignorance of facts. His nearer vision\r\nfailed in blinding partisanship, in his obdurate hatred of Louis\r\nNapoleon and suspicion of the Italian statesmen. He could not see that\r\nthe royalists were aiming at Unity almost as seriously and more wisely\r\nthan himself, that Louis Napoleon wished to be his country's friend,\r\nand that the Emperor's hesitations and backslidings were concessions\r\nto the relentless pressure of Catholic opinion. He could not escape\r\nfrom his own past, he had a feverish, unreasoned craving for a single\r\nform of action, he could not see that conspiracy and insurrection,\r\nwhich had their justification and chance of success twenty years ago,\r\nhad neither now. It is perhaps never easy for one man to be both\r\nidealist and statesman,--for Mazzini, with his passion and\r\ninflexibility, least of all. He could not leave it to other men to\r\nachieve his ideals in their own way. He had a dangerous belief that he\r\nhad \"the instinct of the situation,\" and would never own in politics\r\nthat others might have their fragment of the truth. This obstinate\r\nrebellion--covert or open--against the verdict of his countrymen,--was\r\nit the heroism of the one righteous man, or was it, as one of his old\r\nfriends called it, \"a huge egotistical presumption?\" Or was it rather\r\nthe noble error of one, who, with his mind fixed on the highest,\r\nscorns the high? Who shall say, who does best service for humanity, he\r\nwho seeks the small attainable, or he who 'heaven's success finds or\r\nearth's failure?'\r\n\r\nMazzini knew that he had failed in the near results. He was a\r\ndisappointed man. He had indeed the pride that his utopia had come so\r\nnear accomplishment. But it had come by another way than that which\r\nhe had marked for it, it had fallen very short of what he looked for.\r\nHe had idealised his country in his mighty love, till disillusion was\r\ninevitable. \"I saw,\" he wrote, \"a great void in Europe, a void of any\r\ncommunity of belief or of faith, and therefore of initiative and\r\nworship of duty and solemn moral principles, of great ideas and potent\r\naction for the classes which produce most and yet which are most\r\nwretched; and I thought that Italy would rise and save Europe, and,\r\nsoon as it breathed its own new life, would say to itself and others,\r\n'I will fill that void.'\" \"Little it matters to me,\" he wrote to\r\n\"Daniel Stern,\" \"that Italy, a territory of so many square leagues,\r\neats its corn and cabbages cheaper; little I care for Rome, if a great\r\nEuropean initiative is not to issue from it. What I do care for is\r\nthat Italy shall be great and good, moral and virtuous, that she comes\r\nto fulfil a mission in the world.\" So he had dreamed, and woke to find\r\nit but a dream. In bitter exaggeration he reproached his countrymen\r\nfor being \"less than their fathers and their destinies.\" In his\r\nfavourite phrase, new Italy had found its inspiration not in Dante but\r\nin Macchiavelli. There was no high principle, no true religion, no\r\nsense of freedom's dignity. His criticism was partly a true one. The\r\nfeeble statesmen, who succeeded Cavour and Ricasoli, opportunists\r\nalmost all, some of them mere tricksters, may well have roused his\r\nanger and contempt. The country had become the hunting-ground of\r\noffice-hunters and speculators, who, as Giuditta Sidoli said, \"have\r\nmade Italy and now are eating it.\" The antagonism of North and South,\r\nthe jealousy of Piedmont, the brigandage, the financial chaos were\r\nsymptoms of a dangerous discontent. Few cared for the great moral\r\nhopes, the \"living apostolate\" of Italy. But Mazzini did not\r\nunderstand the value of the sane, wholesome patriotism, that had made\r\nItaly in its own way, or see how great the step had been, that had\r\nbrought the country political and social freedom. In his absorption in\r\nthe political question, he paid at this time small attention to the\r\nsocial changes that were going on; he never alludes to the great\r\ncooperative movement, that was beginning in Italy in these years.\r\n\r\nBut beyond all this, Unity was not complete, and its completion was\r\nthe one thing necessary. The triumph of nationality, the cause of\r\nmorality and religion, alike in Italy and Europe, depended, he\r\nbelieved, on the winning of Rome and Venice. \"I have to kill myself\r\nwith work,\" he wrote, \"for Venice, for Rome, for the republic, in\r\norder to make the instrument.\" The winning of Rome meant the downfall\r\nof the Papacy, the triumph of liberty of conscience, the dawn of a new\r\nreligion. The winning of Venetia meant the break-up of the Austrian\r\nEmpire, and a great reconstruction of Central and Eastern Europe, in\r\nwhich Italy would prove her mission as the \"guide of oppressed\r\nnationalities.\" \"Providence,\" he said, \"has written that the function\r\nof initiative is a necessary condition of the life of Italy. We cannot\r\nlive without a European life; if we free ourselves, we must free\r\nothers. We must be great or perish.\" For Rome he was willing to wait.\r\nWiser than Garibaldi, he saw that any attempt to win it by force meant\r\nwar at once with France and Austria, and he knew that that meant ruin.\r\nHis Roman policy was at bottom that of the Piedmontese statesmen,--to\r\nsecure the withdrawal of the French by the force of public opinion.\r\nHe urged that there should be \"a temperate but weighty remonstrance\"\r\nfrom parliament, backed by half a million Italian signatures. He\r\nprompted petitions in England to ask the government to use its\r\ninfluence in the same direction,--a spur that Lord John Russell hardly\r\nneeded. But he rightly saw that Venice must take precedence. Italy, he\r\nthought, was strong enough to fight Austria alone, and he made\r\nextravagant calculations as to their relative military strength. Only\r\nthere must be no French alliance, no more paltering with the false\r\nprophet of nationality. Cavour and his successors, except for brief\r\nbackslidings, were at one with him in the resolve never to call in\r\nagain the dangerous help of France. But he would not believe this, and\r\nhe hoped both to make the French alliance impossible and force the\r\ngovernment into war with Austria, by fomenting a rising in Venetia or\r\nencouraging volunteers under Garibaldi to attack it. Italy's allies\r\nmust be the nationalities of the East, which had a common interest\r\nwith her in breaking up the Austrian Empire,--an idea which he shared\r\nwith the King and Cavour and others of the Italian statesmen. If\r\nVenetia and the Balkan countries rose, Hungary would follow, and \"war\r\nwith Austria would dissolve the Empire in twenty days.\" With Austria,\r\nTurkey would go too, for the two despotisms, he held, must stand or\r\nfall together. The Polish rising of 1863 made him still more\r\nimpatient. His love of \"poor, sacred Poland\" was strong as in the days\r\nof Young Europe. Forgetting that a resuscitated Poland was bound to\r\nadd its weight to the Catholic and anti-Italian coalition, he\r\nreproached his countrymen for their indifference to the people, which\r\nhad sent its sons to fight for Italy; and he tried to charter a\r\nsteamer to take a cargo of arms to a Lithuanian port. He industriously\r\nencouraged the pro-Polish movement in England, and talked of\r\norganising a Hyde Park meeting.\r\n\r\nAt home, he was still for some years yet willing to suspend any open\r\nrepublican agitation. He indeed attacked the government with\r\nincreasing acerbity; he fretted at its delays, he was irritated by the\r\nlibels of the royalist press. But though he held the monarchy to be\r\nthe source of all the trouble, he would not openly declare against it.\r\nHe kept up a secret republican propagandism in view of future\r\npossibilities, but so long as there was any hope that the monarchy\r\nwould go to Venice and Rome, he would not harass it by a barren\r\nagitation. He knew in fact, that, so long as that hope remained, the\r\n\"ice-wall\" of popular timidity made the republic impossible, and he\r\nwas angrily attacked by the intransigents for his saner view. He was\r\nanxious for the present even to postpone any agitation for reform,\r\nthough he pleaded insistently that, when the work of unity was done, a\r\nConstituent Parliament should meet to draw up a \"national pact,\" which\r\nwas apparently to be an ill-defined constitution, temporarily\r\nadmitting a democratic monarchy, and defining the social duties of the\r\ncountry and the respective functions of state and local bodies. He had\r\na bold domestic programme, whose chief articles were a universal\r\nvolunteer system, the nationalisation of railways, mines, church\r\nlands, and \"some great industrial undertakings,\" state encouragement\r\nfor productive cooperative societies, and a reorganisation of local\r\ngovernment on a basis of some twelve large \"regions\" and big,\r\namalgamated communes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, save for an occasional visit to Switzerland, he was living\r\nin England, where he returned after leaving Naples at the end of 1860.\r\nHere in new lodgings at 2 Onslow Terrace, Brompton, he returned to the\r\nold life of the fifties. The days were spent in the weary round of\r\nletter-writing, but it was often a physical torture now, and failing\r\neyesight made it impossible to go on after dark. In the evening he had\r\ntwo hours' reading, then went to the Stansfelds' neighbouring house in\r\nThurlow Square, to return home at eleven and read his letters and the\r\nItalian papers. His personal life was more and more a struggle with\r\nfailing health. Earlier attacks he had conquered by force of will.\r\n\"Make an effort of will and be well; I have often successfully done\r\nso,\" he wrote once to a friend; and again, \"I hear that you are rather\r\nunwell. Don't. It is absurd to be ill, while nations are struggling\r\nfor liberty.\" He had always scorned medicine and doctors, and had an\r\nespecial detestation for \"that infernal irony of homæopathy, for which\r\nHahnemann must atone somehow, somewhere.\" But now he had often to\r\nsuccumb to an internal trouble, which brought acute pain and sometimes\r\nprostrated him. He no doubt smoked too much, and a few years after\r\nthis Lloyd Garrison tried in vain to break him off the habit.\r\nRheumatism made him \"stiff like an English statesman.\" He could not\r\neat his landlady's ill-cooked dinners, and hid the untouched food\r\nrather than hurt her feelings. Now and again he would feel he had\r\n\"more than ever the ardour of a young man with all the obstinacy of an\r\nold one\"; more often he knew that work was killing him, and he had a\r\nrecurring presentiment that he would not live through each new year.\r\nHe had financial troubles again to worry him. His small annuity was\r\nnot enough to meet his heavy doctor's bills, and a royalty, which he\r\nhad been receiving for the collected edition of his writings, failed\r\nthrough the unwillingness or inability to pay of his Milanese\r\npublisher. A subscription was raised for him in Italy, but it was\r\npassed on to his Venetian fund, and probably most of the £500, that\r\nwere collected for him in England in 1866, went to public purposes.\r\nSerene and cheerful as ever on the outside, he had moods of great\r\ndepression. \"I am sick of men and things,\" he wrote, \"and long for a\r\ndesperate peace.\" \"Morally,\" he writes to \"Daniel Stern,\" with whom he\r\nbegan a steady correspondence at this time, \"I am always the same,\r\ngiven up to work without enthusiasm, from a sense of duty; expecting\r\nnothing, hoping for nothing in the scrap of individual life left me;\r\nloving and recognising those I love,[30] not for the joy but for the\r\nsorrow they can give me; believing, as in early youth, in the future I\r\nhave dreamed of for Italy and the world; sick at the present, but\r\nresigned and calm, if people don't talk too much of materialist\r\npantheism or tactics or happiness or French music.\" When Lincoln was\r\nassassinated, he contrasted sadly with himself the man who died in the\r\nknowledge that his cause had triumphed.\r\n\r\nHis literary work at this time was unimportant, for politics and\r\nsickness used up his strength; but his longings went, as ever, to a\r\nlife of study. \"I should like,\" he wrote, \"to drag myself from library\r\nto library, from one monastic archives to another, to unearth some\r\nlines of a great forgotten thinker, Joachim for instance.\" Mystical\r\nwriters, like Joachim and Eckhart, attracted him more strongly than\r\never; and he seems to have joined an esoteric society in Italy, which\r\nhad Dante for its spiritual chief. Modern spiritualism, however, only\r\nirritated him; \"when men have ceased to believe in God,\" he said, \"God\r\npays them out by making them believe in Cagliostro or table-turning.\"\r\n\r\nHis admiration of English life was stronger than ever. He held up for\r\nItalian imitation its freedom of life and thought, notwithstanding his\r\nsuspicions that his letters still ran the risk of being tampered with\r\nin the English Post-Office. He had words of praise even for the\r\nmonarchy and aristocracy, but predicted that the growing power of\r\nfinancial magnates would prove the death of both. It was about this\r\ntime that he became again a prominent figure in English politics. A\r\nCalabrian, named Greco, attempted to assassinate Louis Napoleon.\r\nMazzini had had no part in or knowledge of the plot; but he had known\r\nGreco in the past, and letters from him were found on the assassin.\r\nThe French police caught at the opportunity to bring odium on him and\r\ninculpate Stansfeld, whose name and address were found in one of his\r\nletters. Without any particle of evidence to connect the letters with\r\nthe plot, the French court condemned Mazzini; and the Tories and Irish\r\nin the House of Commons gleefully used the handle given them to\r\ndiscredit his English friend. Stansfeld, who was a member of the\r\ngovernment, resigned office rather than embarrass his colleagues, but\r\nthe insincerity of the attack was as clear as its audacious\r\nshamelessness. The incident had its sequel of comedy, when Disraeli,\r\nwho had been foremost in denouncing the imagined sympathy with\r\nassassination, was confronted with a _Revolutionary Epick_ of his own\r\nyouthful days, in which he had blessed \"the regicidal steel.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini keenly watched the American Civil War. He had for many years\r\nfelt intensely about slavery, and he now gave his sympathy and\r\nsubscription to the London Emancipation Society, which was enlisting\r\nEnglish sympathy for the North. \"I believe,\" he wrote to his friend,\r\nMr W. Malleson, who was its Secretary, \"that in these times of ours\r\nthere are three things, against which a man ought to protest before\r\ndying, if he wants to die in peace with his own conscience:\r\nslavery--capital punishment--and the actual either narrow or\r\nhypocritical condition of the religious question.\" \"Abolition,\" he\r\nwrote to Mr Moncure Conway, \"is the religious consecration of your\r\nbattles.\" But he was not equally enthusiastic for the Union. In\r\ncurious inconsistency with his usual preference for big nations, he\r\nthought that America was \"wide enough for two or three eventual\r\nsisterly confederations.\" When the war was over, he implored the\r\nAmericans not to impair their victory by refusing the vote to the\r\nnegroes, though they should see that education went hand in hand with\r\nit. Again, as in 1854, he was eager that America should come into\r\nworld politics, and help to build up the future Europe of nationality\r\nand the republic. \"You,\" he said, \"have become a leading nation. You\r\nmay act as such. In the great battle which is fought throughout the\r\nworld between right and wrong, justice and arbitrary rule, equality\r\nand privilege, duty and egotism, republic and monarchy, truth and\r\nlies, God and idols, your part is marked; you must accept it.\" He\r\nhoped that they would upset Napoleon's Mexican scheme, which meant\r\n\"Imperialism at their own door\"; at the time of the suggested\r\nAnglo-French intervention, when American feeling was bitter against\r\nEngland, he wrote, \"war with England would be a crime and a fault; war\r\nfor Mexico a holy thing.\" Shortly before Lincoln's assassination, he\r\nand Ledru Rollin and Karl Blind wrote to the President, urging the\r\ndanger to the Union that threatened from Mexico, and suggesting a\r\ncooperation with the democrats of Europe, that would weaken or upset\r\nNapoleon. Apparently the plan was that the Americans should invade\r\nMexico, while their unofficial allies stirred a republican movement in\r\nFrance or organised an attack on Rome. Lincoln seems to have listened\r\nto the suggestion not unfavourably. When the Northern army disbanded\r\nafter the war, Mazzini would have liked to see the men go as\r\nvolunteers to aid the Mexicans, and the government \"whisper\" that it\r\nwould follow. \"It would have done more than anything towards the\r\nfraternisation of North and South, and the negroes would have won\r\nthen, undisputed, the right to the suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nA few years later, he was much concerned in the fate of the Fenian\r\nprisoners. \"I am feeling,\" he writes, \"between the unhappy and the\r\nfurious about the Fenians condemned. To-day, I think, is the Queen's\r\nbirthday. Does she read a newspaper? Cannot she find a womanly feeling\r\nin her heart and ask the Cabinet to commute the punishment? In point\r\nof fact, the killing of these men will prove an absolute fault\r\n[mistake]. Burke will be the Robert Emmet of 1867. A feeling of\r\nrevenge will rekindle the energy of the discouraged Fenians. The\r\ndream will become, through martyrdom, a sort of religion. But that is\r\nnot my ground. It is the legal murder reenacted against a _thought_, a\r\nthought which ought to be refuted, destroyed by thought only. Burke\r\nand others are genuine believers in Irish nationality. I think they\r\nare philosophically and politically wrong; but are we to refute a\r\nphilosophical error with hanging?\" After their reprieve he wrote, \"You\r\nhave been spared the infamy of Burke's execution. I am glad of it; I\r\nhave a weakness for England, and did not like the shame for her.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMazzini's active political work in these years was given almost wholly\r\nto the winning of Venetia. Before he left Naples in 1860, he and\r\nGaribaldi had agreed to agitate for an attack on either Venetia or\r\nRome in the following year. But the jealousy, that was always latent\r\nbetween the two, prevented any cordial cooperation. The fault was very\r\nlittle on Mazzini's side. He must have felt it, that Garibaldi, whose\r\nwork for the country was so small beside his own, had eclipsed himself\r\nin the nation's imagination; but he was ever ready to let him take the\r\nhonour and keep himself in the background. Once get Garibaldi with the\r\nvolunteers, he said, \"and he may send me to the devil the day after.\"\r\nBut Garibaldi had always some grievance to nurse, and he had not\r\nforgotten the friction at Rome in 1849. Mazzini's theories irritated\r\nhim, and he dubbed him \"the great doctrinaire.\" The most easily led of\r\nmen, \"weak beyond expression,\" as Mazzini truly said of him, he hated\r\nit to be thought that he was under anybody's influence; and Mazzini\r\ncomplained with cause that \"if Garibaldi has to choose between two\r\nproposals, he is sure to accept the one that isn't mine.\" The\r\nmischief-makers, who always clustered round the hermit of Caprera, did\r\ntheir best to feed his prejudices. And though the two men were both\r\nburning to free Venice and Rome, they had radical differences as to\r\nthe means. Garibaldi believed in the King; Mazzini's faith in him was\r\nvery limited. Garibaldi wanted to have an understanding with the\r\ngovernment; Mazzini generally wished to act independently. He saw that\r\nthe patriots must concentrate on the freeing of Venice; Garibaldi was\r\never running back to his cherished design of marching to Rome, or, if\r\nhe temporarily abandoned it, he leaned to some knight-errant\r\nenterprise in Eastern Europe, where he could attack Austria from the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Minghetti and the less statesmanlike section of the\r\nModerates,--a tepid, craven, weak-principled crew,--wanted to stamp\r\nout the democratic agitation; and it was left comparatively\r\nunmolested, thanks only to the bigger outlook of Ricasoli, who had\r\nbecome premier after Cavour's death. Had Ricasoli remained in office,\r\nhe would have amnestied Mazzini from the sentence of 1857; and the\r\ngreatest of living Italians would have been no longer a felon in his\r\nown country. But Ricasoli was driven from office by a cabal; and\r\nRattazzi, who succeeded him, was too much under bond to Louis Napoleon\r\nto pardon the Emperor's enemy. Rattazzi began a double game with\r\nGaribaldi, which ended, as Mazzini had predicted, in \"a solemn\r\nmystification\" and the catastrophe of Aspromonte. Mazzini was opposed\r\nto the whole foolhardy business, and among his English friends\r\ncondemned it in strong language; but apparently he helped to collect\r\nfunds for Garibaldi, and when once Garibaldi took up the cry of \"Rome\r\nor Death,\" he thought it his duty to help. The day after the\r\nvolunteers crossed from Sicily on the tragi-comic march for Rome, he\r\nleft London to join them. He had got as far as Lugano, when he heard\r\nthat Italian soldiers had fired on them, and that Garibaldi lay\r\nstricken by an Italian bullet. His anguish at the pity of it all\r\nbrought on delirium. The ghosts of martyr-patriots reproached him, as\r\nthey had done in 1836; he cried that Garibaldi was dead, and his\r\nfriends could not quiet his ravings. He recovered quickly, but broke\r\ninto passionate denunciation of the government, scourging the monarchy\r\nas impotent and unwilling to make Italy, and threatening to raise the\r\nrepublican flag again.\r\n\r\nThe threat was forgotten, as he regained his calmness, and he returned\r\nto his old plan of a volunteer movement on Venetia, which the\r\ngovernment would be compelled to follow. He was \"silently raging at\r\npoor, brave Poland being left alone in the field,\" and hoped that an\r\nattack on Austria would save her. It was at this juncture,--in the\r\nspring of 1863,--that he received strange overtures for alliance from\r\nthe King. The two men had always had a certain fascination for each\r\nother. Victor Emmanuel shared Mazzini's impatience to win Venetia, his\r\nhatred of Austria; he had something of the great agitator's wish to\r\nsee the nationalities of Eastern Europe free. Both were irritated by\r\nthe feeble Minghetti ministry, which had come into office after\r\nAspromonte, half-hearted in its nationalist aspirations, dreading the\r\ndemocratic forces, which Cavour would have taken in hand and guided.\r\nThe fellow-conspirators bargained hard, but, after months of tedious\r\nnegotiation, they seem to have agreed that Mazzini should foment a\r\nrising in Venetia and waive meanwhile any republican movement, that\r\nthe King should make his government supply arms to the insurgents and\r\neventually declare war, while both would encourage a rising in Hungary\r\nor Galicia. It was impossible, however, to give effect to the\r\nalliance. The fact of the negotiations leaked out more or less. The\r\nGreco plot, though probably few believed that Mazzini was an\r\naccomplice, made it difficult for the King to treat with him. The\r\nministers, morbidly afraid of any contact with the revolutionaries,\r\nand possibly aware that Mazzini had made their dismissal a condition\r\nof his cooperation, remonstrated; and indeed it shows the King's and\r\nMazzini's small respect for parliamentary government that the personal\r\ntreaty was attempted at all. The King was irritated at Mazzini's\r\nexigencies, and began to transfer his attentions to Garibaldi.\r\nGaribaldi at this moment (April 1864) was paying a long promised visit\r\nto England, where he had a mythical prestige almost as great as in his\r\nown country. As usual he was buffeted by the various influences that\r\nsought to capture him. The English Radicals wanted to use him for a\r\nseries of popular demonstrations; Palmerston laid his schemes to keep\r\nhim quiet in the hands of hosts, like the Duke of Sutherland and\r\nCharles Seely, the member for Lincoln, who would be responsible for\r\nhis discreet behaviour. Victor Emmanuel, while still negotiating\r\nfitfully with Mazzini, sent his agents to persuade him to head a\r\nrising in Galicia; Mazzini wanted him for the Venetian movement. The\r\nworthy, puzzled man tried to please everybody, provided that he\r\nappeared to be managed by nobody. Mazzini wrote to him to begin his\r\ntour in the provinces at once, before he went to London; and met him,\r\nsoon after he arrived, at Mr Seely's house in the Isle of Wight. There\r\nwas a cordial reconciliation, and Mazzini thought he had won Garibaldi\r\nto his own scheme. At a breakfast given by Alexander Herzen, the one\r\nrich man among the exiles, at his house at Teddington, Garibaldi spoke\r\nof Mazzini as the counsellor of his youth and constant friend. The\r\nincident alarmed the English government, and their contemptible and\r\ndishonorable manoeuvres secured Garibaldi's departure. Mazzini still\r\nsupposed that Garibaldi was faithful to his scheme, and went to Lugano\r\nto forward the preparations for the Venetian insurrection.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi, however, though he had given Mazzini no hint of his change\r\nof mind, had accepted the King's plan. The Duke of Sutherland's yacht\r\ntook him to Ischia, where he was preparing to sail to the East, when\r\nthe secret was given to the world; and the King, frightened by the\r\npublicity, hastily broke from the plot. Mazzini, though he tried to\r\npersuade Garibaldi to visit England again and make his abandoned\r\nprovincial tour (\"Newcastle is the best place\"), was justly incensed\r\nat him and the King for their want of candour. He suspected, with good\r\nreason, that the ministry had fallen in with the Galician scheme, for\r\nthe sake of getting Garibaldi out of the country and perhaps sending\r\nhim to his death. He was \"sick at heart of the equivocal position,\"\r\nand determined to \"go on in a clearer path.\" Events helped to bring\r\nhim back to frank hostility towards the government. The September\r\nConvention, most dishonouring and impolitic of treaties, was\r\nconcluded, and it seemed to mark, as in the letter it did, a\r\nrenunciation of the claims to Rome. He passionately denounced the\r\nsurrender, the \"policy of subterfuge and crooked ways,\" which\r\nthreatened to founder Italy. \"I prefer half a century of slavery to a\r\nnational lie,\" he wrote. He was hoaxed into believing that the\r\ngovernment had offered France a large slice of Piedmont to buy her\r\nacquiescence in any winning of Venice or Rome. He had a bitter quarrel\r\nwith Crispi, who was fast sliding down the decline of respectability.\r\nCrispi had attacked him in the Chamber, as dividing the country by his\r\nrepublicanism. Mazzini wasted words in retorting on the opportunist,\r\nwho yesterday had been most intransigent of republicans, and was now\r\nparading his new-found faith in the monarchy. He was inclined to break\r\nthe slender threads, that connected him with the parliamentary Left,\r\n\"who had laid aside their old democratic ardour to assume the icy\r\ndemeanour of English members of parliament.\" But he still hesitated at\r\nany complete rupture with the monarchy, so long as any hope remained\r\nthat the government would attack Austria.\r\n\r\nIt was doing better than he knew. The outcry at the September\r\nConvention had wrecked Minghetti's ministry, and under the brave and\r\nhonest La Marmora there was some chance of going forward. The\r\nnegotiations for the Prussian alliance were pushed on, and early in\r\nApril 1866 the treaty was signed. Mazzini had preached co-operation\r\nwith Germany in 1851 and 1861, but now he denounced the alliance with\r\n\"men who represented despotism,\" an alliance which, he imagined,\r\nimplied the abandonment of the claims to the Tyrol. He had\r\ninformation, which again was almost certainly inaccurate, as to the\r\narrangement of Biarritz, and \"knew from positive information\" that\r\nItaly had promised to cede Sardinia and part of Piedmont to France, as\r\nthe price of Napoleon's help. Much, however, as he disliked the\r\ndiplomacy, still it was a war for Venice, and he urged his followers\r\nto join the volunteers. If the war ended in victory, they could then\r\nmarch on to Rome. He had his plan of operations for the war,--to mask\r\nthe Quadrilateral, and push on with the main body of the army to\r\nVienna, while the volunteers landed in Istria and tried to rouse the\r\nSlavs. Whether the plan was original or not, it was almost identical\r\nwith one, which had been favoured by Ricasoli, now again premier, by\r\nCialdini, one of the two Italian commanders, and probably by Bismarck,\r\nand which was rejected, or at least mutilated, only by La Marmora's\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAll the world had expected to see the Italians easily victorious. But\r\nagain, as in 1848, their chance was spoilt by incompetent generalship.\r\nThe army was defeated at Custozza, the fleet at Lissa; Garibaldi and\r\nthe volunteers had little of the spirit of 1860, and were paralysed in\r\nthe Tyrol. Equally unexpectedly, the Prussians on their side had\r\ntriumphed swiftly and conclusively; and Napoleon, afraid that the\r\nunforeseen events would nip his schemes, stepped in with a message\r\nthat Austria had offered to cede Venetia to himself and that he would\r\nhand it over to Italy, if peace were made. It was a bitter and\r\nhumiliating end,--to lay down arms under the shadow of defeat, to\r\nabandon the Tyrol and Istria, to have Venetia not by right of conquest\r\nbut by the condescension of a detested patron. Mazzini did not know\r\nhow unwillingly the government had bowed to a fate, which the military\r\nposition made inevitable. To him it seemed mere pusillanimity,\r\npregnant with \"dishonour and ruin.\" \"It is my lot,\" he sadly wrote,\r\n\"to consume my last days in the grief, supreme to one who really\r\nloves, of seeing the thing, one loves most, inferior to its mission.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[30] _Reconnaissant ceux que j'aime_; one suspects an omission of _à_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nThe Last Years\r\n\r\n1866-1872. AETAT 61-66\r\n\r\n     The Republican Alliance--Life at Lugano--Mentana--Republican\r\n     movement in 1868-70--Intrigue with Bismarck--Imprisonment at\r\n     Gaeta, and release--Attack on the International--Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his ignorance of the facts, he charged it all to the monarchy. The\r\nnation had been sacrificed to the interests of a dynasty. Defeat and\r\ndishonour came of the equivocations, that sprang from the \"primal\r\nfalsehood\" of royalty. The bad government and coercion (which, in\r\nfact, was mild enough), the huge army and civil service and police,\r\nthe consequent financial chaos--all were its fruit. He disclaimed that\r\nit was the republic for its own sake that he wanted now, for its\r\nadvent was only the question of a few years more or less, and its\r\ntriumph might be left to time. But dishonour was the \"gangrene of a\r\nnation,\" and only the republic could cure that. Only the republic\r\ncould win Rome, gather Istria and the Tyrol to the fold, and stretch a\r\nhand to the struggling nationalities of the East. But, if the republic\r\ncame, it must be as a great \"moralising education, to change men from\r\nserfs to citizens, and make them conscious of their mission, their\r\nstrength and dignity.\" The republic must not mean revenge, or\r\nspoliation, or repudiation of debt, or violent anti-clericalism; and\r\nhe was already beginning his crusade against Bakounine and the rough\r\nsocialism, which was making some headway in the country.\r\n\r\nHe had promised that if he resumed his republican agitation, he would\r\nannounce it frankly beforehand, and he did so now. Henceforth he gave\r\nit all his failing strength. Hopeless as their cause probably was at\r\nthe best, the republicans had a strength now, which they had not had\r\nfor fifteen years. The shame of Custozza and Lissa lay heavy on the\r\nnation, and the disillusioning had shaken faith in men and\r\ninstitutions. The sense of national dishonour maddened; civil war was\r\noften on men's lips; the King's prestige was foundering under the load\r\nof private vice and military failure. There was a mass of sullen,\r\nunformulated discontent, ready to find its way into socialist or\r\nrepublican channels. And though men were slow to follow Mazzini into\r\nhis conspiracies, his long years of self-sacrificing labour, the\r\nmystery that wrapped the exile and conspirator, had given him a vast,\r\nalmost mythical fascination for his countrymen. Forty thousand persons\r\nhad signed the petition for his amnesty. Messina elected him time\r\nafter time for its deputy, to have the election quashed as often by\r\nthe Moderates in the Chamber. There was an angry feeling everywhere at\r\nthe senseless intolerance, and the deputies of the Left did their best\r\nto bring the majority to reason. \"While you are still in time,\" said a\r\nrecent premier of Italy, \"prevent Mazzini from having to close his\r\neyes in a foreign land.\"\r\n\r\nWhen at last he was amnestied at the beginning of the war, he refused\r\nto accept it as an act of grace or take his seat as deputy, and\r\nreturned to Lugano. Much of his time henceforth was spent there with\r\nhis friends, Giuseppe Nathan and his wife Sarah, \"the best Italian\r\nfriend I have, one of the best women I know,\" who nursed him in the\r\nattacks of illness, which came with ever greater frequency. Here he\r\nwould watch \"the beautiful calm-lulling lake, the beautiful, solemn,\r\nhopeful-death-teaching sunsets.\" When he was well, he kept to the\r\nhabits of his English life, writing all day, delighting his friends in\r\nthe evening with his brilliant talk. His conspiracies often took him\r\nto Genoa, where he lived in hiding in the house of a working family,\r\nfrom whose windows in the Salita di Oregina he had a superb view of\r\nthe city and the Riviera. He nearly betrayed himself once by shouting\r\nfrom his window at a boy who was torturing a grasshopper. He kept in\r\nclose touch with his English friends and English life. At Lugano he\r\nregularly read \"the good, dry Spectator and the would-be wicked, never\r\nconcluding Saturday Review.\" He made a custom of always returning to\r\nEngland to spend New Year's Day with the Stansfelds or others of their\r\nfamily, crossing the Alps in mid-winter at the peril of his health. He\r\nhad painfully aged. His face had sunk and wore a deathly pallor; the\r\nthick, black hair was thin and grey. William Lloyd Garrison, seeing\r\nhim after an interval of twenty-one years, sadly noted the change,\r\nthough \"the same dark, lustrous eyes\" remained, \"the same classical\r\nfeatures, the same grand intellect, the same lofty and indomitable\r\nspirit, the same combination of true modesty and heroic assertion, of\r\nexceeding benignity and inspirational power.\" Work told heavily upon\r\nhim now. Writing made him giddy, and his characters begin to lose\r\ntheir firmness. He was \"living as if in a whirlwind, something like\r\nPaolo without Francesca, tired, worn out, longing for rest.\" But he\r\nwould not slacken. \"I am bound to those, whom I have organised for a\r\npurpose. I must, before I die, proclaim the republic in Italy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was organising his \"Republican Alliance,\" losing himself in\r\nthe huge work of detail which all came to so little, the impatience in\r\nItaly was breaking down the precautions of the government. Ricasoli\r\nhad been driven from office by his own maladroitness and Garibaldi's\r\nwild, aimless opposition. Rattazzi, the intriguer of 1862, came back\r\nto power, and began the double play, that was only too likely to lead\r\nto another Aspromonte. There is no need here to analyse the obscure\r\nand sordid story of his balancings between the Italian democrats and\r\nFrance. Garibaldi was impatient to win Rome, and cared comparatively\r\nlittle now whether it were in the name of monarchy or republic. His\r\nplan was to lead a raid, with or without the connivance of the\r\ngovernment, into the small territory that still belonged to the Pope,\r\nmeet and defeat the Papal mercenaries, and enter Rome. With Mazzini\r\nthe republic was now a more vital thing than Unity. Only from a\r\nrepublican Rome could Italy perform her civilising mission to the\r\nworld. \"If Rome is to be annexed like the rest,\" he wrote, \"I would\r\nrather it belonged to the Pope another three years.\" He disliked\r\nGaribaldi's scheme; he was not sanguine of its success; if it did\r\nsucceed, it meant that the monarchy would go to Rome and the Pope stay\r\nthere. He wished to see the Romans rise themselves and pronounce for a\r\nrepublic, confident that, if they did so, Italy would echo the\r\nrepublican cry, and the Pope would have to go. Sometimes, however,\r\ndespairing of his own party, he was willing to compromise; and when at\r\nlast Garibaldi started on his raid, and the government backed him,\r\nrisking hostilities with France rather than have civil war, he forgot\r\neverything else in the hope of winning Rome, and urged his followers\r\nto join the raiders. Probably, if he had not been prostrated by\r\nillness, he would have gone himself. When Garibaldi's incapacity was\r\nonly too apparent, and the French troops landed again for the defence\r\nof Rome, he saw that the volunteers were advancing into a trap, and\r\nimplored Garibaldi to retire to Naples, raise the flag of revolution,\r\nand collect forces for another and more hopeful attack. Garibaldi,\r\nmarching obstinately to defeat, was in no temper to listen to anybody,\r\nto Mazzini least of all. The mischief-makers had persuaded him that\r\nMazzini was tampering with his men. There was no particle of truth in\r\nit, but the conviction entered Garibaldi's mind and never left it,\r\nwhile Mazzini lived.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers went to their doom at Mentana. Rattazzi, who at the\r\nlast rose above himself and would have marched to Rome but for the\r\nKing's veto, had resigned some weeks before. Menabrea, who succeeded\r\nhim, had been compelled by public opinion to occupy a part of the\r\nPope's territory; but when the French landed, he withdrew the troops,\r\nrather than face war with France. The country writhed in its rage at\r\nthe French insult, and naturally turned its resentment against the\r\ncrown. Juries acquitted republican papers; the press lampooned the\r\nKing. Some of the deputies gave a secret backing to the republican\r\nmovement; the Friendly Societies, which had always kept more or less\r\nin touch with Mazzini, threw themselves into it. Mazzini had a\r\nfollowing among the Freemasons, though not one himself, and among the\r\nex-volunteers. Most ominous feature of it all, republicanism gained a\r\nlarge footing in the rank-and-file of the army. Mazzini pushed on\r\nimpatiently for Rome and the republic. He knew that the Romans\r\nthemselves were powerless to rise, now that the French were there, and\r\nthat a volunteer movement had no better chance. The only plan, that\r\ncould successfully defy the French and capture Rome, was to seize the\r\ngovernment,--its army and navy and arsenals,--and make a national\r\ncrusade with all the resources of the country. The royalists, he\r\nthought, would never break with France or attack the Papacy; and\r\nindeed the criticism was true of the conservative ministry, which now\r\nheld office. He was equally hopeless of the middle classes, but he was\r\nconfident that the people would respond. Especially he trusted to the\r\nyounger generation and the women of Italy; they alone, he thought,\r\nwere free from the timid opportunism, which had eaten deep into the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAfter Mentana he left London again for Lugano to be nearer his work,\r\nand was constantly passing backwards and forwards between there and\r\nGenoa, finding time among it all to write his great religious apology,\r\nthe sum of all his teaching, _From the Council to God_.[31] His\r\nfollowing at Genoa was considerable now. When he came there secretly,\r\nlittle patrols of working men with concealed arms would watch along\r\nthe streets between the station and his lodgings to guard his person\r\nfrom seizure by the police. The Committee sat waiting for him, each\r\nman armed with his revolver. One of them has described the meeting.\r\n\"A low knock was heard at the door, and there he was in body and soul,\r\nthe great magician, who struck the fancy of the people like a mythical\r\nhero. Our hearts leaped, and we went reverently to meet that great\r\nsoul. He advanced with a child's frank courtesy and a divine smile,\r\nshaking hands like an Englishman, and addressing each of us by name,\r\nas if our names were written on our foreheads. He was not disguised;\r\nhe wore cloth shoes, and a capote, and with his middle, upright\r\nstature, he looked like a philosopher, straight from his study, who\r\nnever dreamed of troubling any police in the world.\" In the spring of\r\n1869 he was eager for action, despite the failure of a plot,\r\ndiscouraged by himself, among the garrison at Milan. The remonstrances\r\nof the government procured his banishment from Switzerland, but he was\r\nback again in August, going \"more sadly than usual, feeling physically\r\nand intellectually weaker and unequal to the task.\" He was suffering\r\ncontinuously, and confessed to his friends that he shrank from the\r\neffort. He was obviously going on from sheer inability to stop more\r\nthan from any hope of success. \"My new plan,\" he wrote gloomily, \"may\r\nprove a dream like many others.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1870 he came again to Genoa to arrange the details.\r\nThe plot broke down like the rest, and at the moment everything was\r\novershadowed by the coming Franco-German war. In common with the great\r\nmajority of his countrymen, outside the court and government, his\r\nsympathies were with Germany. A German victory would avenge Mentana\r\nand compel the French to withdraw from Rome. In spite of his\r\ndenunciation of the Prussian alliance in 1866, he had been for three\r\nyears past carrying on a desultory intrigue with Bismarck. About the\r\ntime of Mentana he had sent a note to Bismarck through their\r\ngo-between. \"I do not in the least,\" it said, \"share Count Bismarck's\r\npolitical views; his method of unification does not command my\r\nsympathy; but I admire his tenacity and energy and independence\r\ntowards the foreigner. I believe in German unity and desire it as much\r\nas that of my own country. I abhor the Empire and the supremacy it\r\narrogates over Europe.\" He saw in the intrigue a chance of pushing his\r\nown schemes, and at the same time of preventing a Franco-Italian\r\nalliance against Germany. He asked Bismarck to send him arms and\r\nmoney, and promised, if he had them, to guarantee him against the\r\nhostile combination. Bismarck parleyed with him for a time, as he had\r\nparleyed with Garibaldi; and when war was imminent, and he knew that\r\nVictor Emmanuel and many of the Italian conservatives were trying\r\nagain to commit the country to a French alliance, he promised that the\r\narms and money should be sent. Mazzini hastened to accept, promising\r\nto attack Rome with the revolutionary forces, and undertaking to\r\nrespect the wish of the country, should a future Constituent Assembly\r\ndeclare for the monarchy. But Bismarck had learnt now that the danger\r\nof the hostile alliance had passed, and the promised help never came.\r\nThe intrigue marks the last stage in Mazzini's political decline. That\r\nhe had asked a foreign government to assist in what meant civil war,\r\nshows how the long years of conspiracy had distorted his moral\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nHe had intended to use Bismarck's money for a new plot, this time in\r\nSicily. It was a fool's errand, and his friends tried in vain to\r\ndissuade him. But the monomania was on him, and he started for the\r\nisland in disguise. As so often before, he had a traitor in his\r\nsecrets, a man who with strange inconsistency had nursed him tenderly\r\nthrough an illness, while he was making a living by betraying his\r\nplans to the French police.[32] When Mazzini arrived by the Naples\r\nsteamer at Palermo, he was arrested. He was taken to Gaeta and treated\r\nwith all possible consideration. The very gaoler took three minutes to\r\nturn the noisy keys silently, that he might soften the sense of\r\nimprisonment. Here through the loopholes of the massive fortress,\r\nwhere the Bourbons had made their last stand nine years before, he\r\nwould watch the sea and sky, as he had done at Savona thirty-nine\r\nyears ago. \"The nights,\" he writes, \"are very beautiful; the stars\r\nshine with a lustre one only sees in Italy. I love them like sisters,\r\nand link them to the future in a thousand ways. If I could choose, I\r\nshould like to live in absolute solitude, working at my historical\r\nbook or at some other, just from a feeling of duty, and only wishing\r\nto see--for a moment, now and then,--some one I did not know, some\r\npoor woman that I could help, some working men I could advise, the\r\ndoves of Zürich, and nothing else.\" He smoked indifferent cigars; he\r\nread bad translations of Shakespeare and Byron from the prison\r\nlibrary, and, for want of better, Tasso's _Gerusalemme_. He was\r\nplanning again a book on Byron, and asks for Taine's critique of him\r\nin his _Littérature anglaise_. \"Taine is a materialist writer, and\r\ncertainly won't have an idea that squares with mine; but I am\r\nintellectually half-asleep and I reckon on the stimulus of\r\ncontradiction and the irritation which I shall get out of his book. He\r\nhas enough perverted intellectual power to wake me up.\"\r\n\r\nHe was released a few weeks later, after the capture of Rome, but he\r\nstill refused to accept the amnesty, that he might keep his hands\r\nfree, \"without even the shadow of ungratefulness to anybody--even to a\r\nking.\" His one anxiety for the moment was to escape the popular\r\ndemonstrations of sympathy, and get to a quiet life among his friends.\r\nHe passed a restless night at Rome; it was twenty-one years since\r\nMargaret Fuller and Giulia Modena had persuaded the ex-Triumvir to\r\nsave himself and fly. He went to Leghorn to his friends the Rossellis;\r\nthence to Genoa, to see his mother's tomb, and fled to escape the\r\novations, with his old sickness on him. \"The only thing really\r\ntouching to me,\" he wrote to England, \"was in the churchyard--it was\r\nlate--and the place was quite empty, but a keeper had, it seems,\r\nrecognised me, and coming out of the gate, some poor people, a priest\r\namong them, were drawn up in a line, bowing and almost touching the\r\nearth. Not a smile, no attempt at absurd applause, they felt my\r\nsadness, and contrived to show they were sharing it.\"[33] The popular\r\nwelcome had been dust and ashes to him; \"even Swinburne's praise,\" he\r\nwrote from Gaeta, \"makes me sad. Who am I, whom he praises?\" His ideal\r\nwas shattered. Rome had \"the profanation of a corrupt and dishonoured\r\nmonarchy,\" and he knew that the monarchy's winning of the capital\r\nmeant that the republic would not come in his day. France, not Italy,\r\nhad proclaimed the republic, and in a spirit that he hated. His own\r\nparty had failed him. \"Italy, my Italy,\" he said, \"the Italy that I\r\nhave preached, the Italy of our dreams? Italy, the great, the\r\nbeautiful, the moral Italy of my heart? This medley of opportunists\r\nand cowards and little Macchiavellis, that let themselves be dragged\r\nbehind the suggestion of the foreigner,--I thought to call up the soul\r\nof Italy, and I only see its corpse.\" \"Yes, dear,\" he writes to Mrs\r\nStansfeld, \"I love more deeply than I thought my poor dreamt-of Italy,\r\nmy old vision of Savona. I want to see, before dying, another Italy,\r\nthe ideal of my soul and life, start up from her three hundred years'\r\ngrave: this is only the phantom, the mockery of Italy. And the thought\r\nhaunts me, like the incomplete man in Frankenstein, seeking for a soul\r\nfrom its maker.\"\r\n\r\nBut henceforth he resigns conspiracy. Sometimes he still hoped for\r\ninsurrection, still believed that \"a month of action transforms a\r\npeople more than ten years of being preached to\"; but he knew that the\r\nrepublic was afar off, that all he could do now was quietly to educate\r\nhis countrymen, especially the working classes. \"Tell the working-men\r\nof Genoa,\" so he sent his message, \"that this is not a time for\r\ndemonstrations but self-education. Germany is the only country that\r\ndeserves a republic.\" He helped to organise the Friendly Societies; he\r\nadvocated evening classes for workmen, circulating popular libraries,\r\nthe collection of a fund to assist societies for co-operative\r\nproduction; he founded a paper, _Roma del Popolo_, to spread his\r\nideas. He still hoped to write his popular history on Italy and a book\r\non national education,--hopes, alas, never fulfilled. He published\r\n_From the Council to God_, and was delighted at the success it met\r\nwith in its English translation in the Fortnightly. He was keenly\r\ninterested in the English movements for women's suffrage and against\r\nstate regulation of vice. But his chief work in these last years was\r\nto fight the immature socialism of the time. He was bitterly chagrined\r\nby the \"invasion of barbarians,\" which was threatening to conquer the\r\nItalian working-classes to socialism or anarchism. The International\r\nhad passed out of its first stage as an organiser of trade-unionism,\r\nand was now the battle-ground between the anarchists under Bakounine\r\nand the collectivists, who followed Karl Marx. In its earlier days\r\nMazzini had had some relations with it and Bakounine; he had advised\r\nhis followers to join it, and had a high opinion of its English\r\nleaders, Odger and Cremer, \"for their power of intellect and heart and\r\ntheir sincere devotion to the cause.\" He had tried to make it a\r\npolitical, revolutionary society; and when he found himself defeated\r\nby Marx' opposition, he retired. Since then, the International had\r\nturned to far other roads of revolution. Mazzini hardly distinguished\r\nbetween the two sections that were fighting for mastery in it, and\r\nbanned indiscriminately the atheism and anarchism of the one and the\r\nsocialism of the other. And in fact both were equally alien from his\r\nspiritual basis of life, his fervid faith in nationality, his more\r\nmodest economic programme.[34] But he was careful to show that his\r\ncriticism came from no lack of social aspiration. \"Those, whom you\r\ncall barbarians,\" he retorted on the Italian conservatives, who had\r\nused the word in a far other sense, \"represent an idea,--the\r\ninevitable, destined rise of the men of Labour.\" The International,\r\nhe argued, was the necessary fruit of middle-class indifference to\r\nsocial reform; and the Assembly at Versailles was more guilty than the\r\nCommune. He had, in fact, small liking for the Third Republic. A\r\nrepublic, which had only come for lack of an alternative, which had\r\nThiers for its chief, and made no sign of restoring Nice, was a\r\nrepublic only in form. When he read Renan's _Réforme intellectuelle et\r\nmorale_, it confirmed him in his distrust of France; and, almost on\r\nhis death-bed, he reviewed the book in words of acute disappointment\r\nat its spirit.\r\n\r\nThe long life of fighting was fast closing in weariness and sense of\r\nfailure. \"This life of a machine, that writes and writes and writes\r\nfor thirty-five years, begins to weigh upon me strangely.\" He had\r\nbitter personal chagrins; his one surviving sister refused to see him,\r\nfrom religious differences; Garibaldi would not be reconciled. All\r\nthrough the end of 1871 he was kept alive only by the devoted\r\nattention of Bertani, who looked after his patient as well as he had\r\norganised the Expedition of the Thousand. He still refused to accept\r\nthe amnesty, and travelled under an assumed name to Pisa and Genoa and\r\nFlorence, where he laid a wreath on Ugo Foscolo's tomb, for the bones\r\nof his hero had been lately brought from Chiswick to rest in Santa\r\nCroce. Giuditta Sidoli, \"good, holy, constant Giuditta,\" died. \"Did\r\nshe die a Christian?\" he enquires; \"any faith, even though imperfect\r\nand spoilt by false doctrine, comforts the pillow of the dying better\r\nthan the dry, thin, gloomy travesty of Science, which is called\r\nnow-a-days Free Thought or Rationalism.\" He knew his own end was not\r\nfar, and he was willing it should come. \"Strange,\" he said, \"that I\r\nsee all those I loved go one by one, while I remain, I know not why.\"\r\nHis one care was that the work should still go on. \"What matter,\" he\r\nwrote, \"how many years or months I still live down here? Shall I love\r\nyou less because I go elsewhere to work? Will you love me less, when\r\nyou can only love me by working? I often think, that when at last I\r\nleave you, you will all work with more faith and ardour, to prevent my\r\nhaving lived in vain.\" In his last words to the working men of Italy\r\nhe says, \"love and work for this great, unhappy country of ours,\r\ncalled to high destinies, but stayed upon the road by those who\r\ncannot, will not know the road. This is the best way that you can have\r\nof loving me.\" One of his last acts was to repay an old loan of half a\r\nlifetime's standing. In the mild spring of 1872 he was living at a\r\nhouse that belonged to Pellegrino Rosselli, son-in-law of his old\r\nfriends, the Nathans of Lugano, in the Via Maddalena at Pisa. People\r\nwould watch the white-haired stranger, who went by the name of Brown,\r\ntaking his daily walk, with the affectionate eyes and a kind word for\r\nevery child. Early in March he was taken very ill and sank rapidly. On\r\nthe 10th he died. His last conscious words were--\"Believe in God? Yes,\r\nI do believe in God.\" He was buried, where he had always wished to\r\nlie, beside his mother, in the cemetery of Staglieno outside Genoa.\r\nThere, in the words of Carducci's epitaph, rests\r\n\r\n     L'UOMO\r\n     CHE TUTTO SACRIFICÒ\r\n     CHE AMÒ TANTO\r\n     E MOLTO COMPATÌ E NON ODIÒ MAI.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Otherwise entitled _A Letter to the Oecumenical Council_.\r\n\r\n[32] I have some doubts, though, whether this Wolff is identical with\r\nthe Wolff of the journey to Sicily. See _Lettere ad A. Giannelli_,\r\n503.\r\n\r\n[33] Will not some Italian artist paint the scene?\r\n\r\n[34] See below, pp. 288, 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nReligion\r\n\r\n     Religion essential to society--Paramouncy of the\r\n     spiritual--Criticism of Christianity; Catholicism;\r\n     Protestantism--Christ's teaching: its truths and\r\n     imperfections--The doctrines of the new faith: God;\r\n     Progress; Immortality--The criteria of Truth: the\r\n     conscience; tradition--Humanity--The need of unity;\r\n     authority; church and state; the new church.\r\n\r\n\r\nMazzini's life was one piece of almost perfect consistency and\r\ncontinuity. Save in minor points of policy, it had no turnings, no\r\nconversions, no recantations. Alike in theory and practice, it goes on\r\nits straight, undeviating course from his youthful literary essays to\r\nthe full-bodied doctrine of _The Duties of Man_ and _From the Council\r\nto God_, from the first days of Young Italy to those of the Republican\r\nAlliance. And its magnificent unity comes of this, that all was\r\ndominated by a scheme of thought, that controlled and correlated each\r\nsphere of human action. Supremely he achieved the harmony of life,\r\nwhich he never wearied of extolling. He was politician, philosopher,\r\nreligious reformer, literary critic; and every side of life completes\r\nthe others in a perfect synthesis. At the centre of it all,\r\ncontrolling, illuminating, energizing, stands his religious faith. To\r\nhim religion was \"the eternal, essential, indwelling element of life,\"\r\n\"the breath of humanity, its soul and life and consciousness and\r\noutward symbol,\" hallowing men's thoughts and actions, ennobling,\r\nconsoling, fortifying, the inspiring principle of brotherhood and\r\nsocial service. Deep in the conscience of each man, inseparable from\r\nlife, lies the religious sense,--the sense of the Infinite and\r\nImperishable, the aspiration to the Unknown and Invisible, the innate\r\ndesire to apprehend God in his intellect and love. \"If ever you have,\"\r\nhe once said, \"a strange moment of religious feeling, of supreme\r\nresignation, of quiet love of humanity, of a calm insight of duty,\r\nkneel down thankful, and treasure within yourself the feeling suddenly\r\narisen. It is the feeling of life.\" And with the sense of the Divine,\r\nthere comes to man the yearning to reach after the divine perfection\r\nand the importunate searching for the way. In every age, men have\r\nasked \"to know, or at least to surmise, something of the starting-point\r\nand goal of mundane existence\"; and religion comes to teach \"the\r\ngeneral principles that rule humanity, to sanction the link that makes\r\nmen brothers in the consciousness of that one origin, one mission, one\r\ncommon aim.\" Man makes that mission and that aim his guiding star in\r\nall his strivings for the good; and in every branch of his activity he\r\nsteers his course by his knowledge of God. \"From the general formula,\r\nthat men call religion, issues a rule of education, a basis of human\r\nbrotherhood, a policy, a social economy, an art.\" It is impossible to\r\nkeep it out of politics. It is there \"in all questions of the\r\nfranchise, of the condition of the masses, of nationality,\"--all\r\nintimately linked with the religious thought of the time, all part of\r\nGod's providential scheme for man. \"I do not know,\" he says,\r\n\"speaking historically, a single great conquest of the human spirit, a\r\nsingle important step for the perfecting of human society, which has\r\nnot had its roots in a strong religious faith.\" \"No true society\r\nexists without a common faith and common purpose; politics are the\r\napplication, religion gives the principle.\" Where this common faith is\r\nnot, the mere will of the majority means permanent instability and the\r\noppression of the rest; \"without God, you can coerce, but you cannot\r\npersuade; you may be tyrants in your turn, but you cannot be educators\r\nor apostles.\"\r\n\r\nWithout religion, then,--deep, heartfelt, vitalising religion,--there\r\ncan be no true community. Materialism had been tried, and had\r\nfailed;--failed because it was \"an individualist, cold, calculating\r\ndoctrine, that slowly, infallibly extinguished every spark of high\r\nthinking or free life, that first plunged men into the worship of\r\nsuccess, then made them slaves of triumphant violence and the\r\naccomplished fact.\" It killed enthusiasm in the individual; it killed\r\ntrue greatness in a nation. Bare ethics had been tried, \"but no\r\nmorality can endure or bring forth life, without a heaven and a dogma\r\nto support it.\" \"No, man needs more than simple ethics; he craves to\r\nsolve his doubts, to slake his thirsting for a future; he wants to\r\nknow whence he comes and whither he goes.\" Men had tried philosophy,\r\nand indeed philosophy, that took humanity and not the individual for\r\nits study, was \"the science of the law of life\"; but by itself it was\r\na barren rock, where life could find no resting-place. \"Heresy is\r\nsacred,\" but only as the transient stage between a lower and a higher\r\nfaith. Philosophy can \"analyse and anatomise and dissect,\" but it has\r\nno breath of life to \"decree duty or push men to deeds by giving\r\nethics a new strength and grandeur.\" The needs of the age are less\r\nintellectual than spiritual. \"What we want, what the people want, what\r\nthe age is crying for, that it may find an issue from this slough of\r\nselfishness and doubt and negation, is a faith, a faith in which our\r\nsouls may cease to err in search of individual ends, may march\r\ntogether in the knowledge of one origin, one law, one goal.\" And such\r\na faith, and only such a faith, will give the solid, strong\r\nconvictions and the energy and unity, by which alone society can be\r\nhealed. \"Any strong faith, that rises on the wreck of the old,\r\nexhausted creeds, will transform the existing social order, since\r\nevery strong belief must needs apply itself to every branch of human\r\nactivity; because always, in every age, earth has sought conformity\r\nwith the heaven in which it believed; because all Humanity repeats\r\nunder different formulas and in different degrees the words of the\r\nLord's Prayer of Christendom: Thy kingdom come on earth as it is in\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nWhere shall this faith be found,--this living, vitalising faith, for\r\nwhich the age is groping, for want of which its aspiration and its\r\nefforts are in vain? Does Christianity supply it? Mazzini asked the\r\nquestion reverently and tenderly. Religion, he says, is above and\r\nindependent of creeds, but every creed is sacred, for each has added\r\nto man's knowledge of God and of himself. However incomplete a faith,\r\nso it be a faith indeed, it helps to hallow life. He felt his a\r\nspiritual kinship more with Catholic priest and Protestant pastor, who\r\nlighted earth with broken rays of the divine, than with the sceptic,\r\nwho would shut out God and immortality, enthusiasm and love.\r\nReverently, then, he tested Christianity. For the superstructures,\r\nindeed, that Catholics and Protestants had built upon the Christianity\r\nof Christ, he felt respect and sympathy, but little love. He had his\r\nspecial grievances against the Papacy for the evil work it had done in\r\nhis own country, and he hated it, as only an Italian of his day could\r\nhate it. He held it to be irrevocably doomed: doomed, since the\r\nReformation took the North from it;--doomed, \"because it has betrayed\r\nits mission to protect the weak, because for three centuries and a\r\nhalf it has committed fornication with the princes of this world,\r\nbecause at the bidding of every evil and unbelieving government it has\r\ncrucified Jesus afresh in the name of egoism,\"--doomed, because it\r\nstood apart from the great humanitarian movements of the century, the\r\nfreeing of Greece and Italy, the emancipation of the blacks;--doomed\r\nfor the root sin, of which these were but consequences, that it had\r\nbecome \"a phantasm of religion,\" \"without faith or power or mission.\"\r\nIt had missed the meaning of Christ's teaching; it had sinned against\r\nthe Holy Spirit, and there was no forgiveness for it. \"God will\r\nprovide for the abominated idolatry, God, who breaks all idols that\r\nwere and are and shall be.\" Sometimes he was confident, that, before\r\nthe century was out, the Papacy would be extinct. And yet, in spite of\r\nall, he respected what had been a great fact in the history of\r\nreligion. Like every strong belief, it had in its time done high\r\nservice for humanity, it had had its share of the noble and sublime\r\nand potent. \"I remember it all and bow myself before your past.\" And\r\ndie though it must, he would it should die nobly, \"like the sun in\r\nthe great ocean,\" rejoicing that God's great design bade it make place\r\nfor a more perfect faith.\r\n\r\nFor Protestantism his feeling was colder both in its sympathies and\r\nantipathies. His Catholic training, his craving for formal unity, made\r\nit difficult for him to read it sympathetically; and he saw it chiefly\r\nin its defects,--its exaggeration of the individual, its rejection of\r\ntradition, its sectarianism, its \"indefinite dismembering of the\r\ncommon thought.\" He recognised somewhat, though imperfectly, the\r\npolitical and social work, which was indissolubly bound up with\r\nPuritanism; \"'God and the People,'\" he said in one of his letters to\r\nEnglish working men, \"were the inspirers of your Cromwell.\" As\r\nCatholicism had one side of the truth in its respect for tradition, so\r\nProtestantism had the other in its assertion of individual\r\ninterpretation, and in this it had apprehended the essence of\r\nChristianity more truly than Catholicism had done. But though\r\nProtestants were slowly learning the value of tradition, the\r\npreeminence of Humanity over man, they still magnified the individual,\r\ntill their creed had become a doctrine of material and spiritual\r\nselfishness, which must logically develop into pure materialism. He\r\ncharged it with inspiring the inhumanity and anarchy of the\r\n_laissez-faire_ economy. It had made the salvation of the individual\r\nsoul the end of life; and thus it had sundered religion from society,\r\nand dwarfed the all-embracing plan of God to the puny borders of a\r\nloveless pietism.\r\n\r\nBut when Mazzini passes from Catholicism and Protestantism to Christ,\r\nhis attitude is one of infinite reverence and love. His close\r\nknowledge of the Gospels, his native kinship with their spirit, had\r\nbrought him very near the mind of Christ, and he spoke of Him in\r\nbeautiful and tender words. Christ's \"was the soul most full of love,\r\nof holiest virtue, most inspired by God and by the Future, that men\r\nhave ever hailed upon this earth.\" He \"came for all; he spoke to all\r\nand for all. He lifted up the People and died for it.\" \"I love Jesus,\"\r\nhe once wrote in a private letter, \"as the man who has loved the most\r\nall mankind, servants and masters, rich and poor, Brahmins and Helots\r\nor Parias.\" \"In Jesus,\" so he wrote to the Oecumenical Council, \"we\r\nworship the Founder of an age that freed the individual, the Apostle\r\nof the unity of law,--that law which he understood more fully than did\r\nany of the generations before him,--the Prophet of the equality of\r\nsouls: and we bow ourselves before him, as the man who among all we\r\nknow of loved the most, whose life, an unexampled harmony between\r\nthought and practice, proclaimed the holy doctrine of sacrifice,\r\nhenceforth to be the everlasting foundation of all religion and all\r\nvirtue; but we do not cancel the woman-born in God, we do not raise\r\nhim where we cannot hope to join him; we would love him as the brother\r\nwho was better than us all, not worship him and fear him as pitiless\r\njudge and intolerant tyrant of the future.\" In Christ's teaching he\r\nfound many of the moral and social truths that were dearest to him.\r\n\"Does not every word of the Gospel breathe the spirit of liberty and\r\nequality, of that war with evil and injustice and falsehood, that\r\ninspires our work?\" The cross was the symbol of \"the one true immortal\r\nvirtue, the sacrifice of self for others.\" \"Unity of faith, love for\r\none another, human brotherhood, activity in well-doing, the doctrine\r\nof sacrifice, the doctrine of equality, the abolition of aristocracy,\r\nthe perfecting of the individual, liberty,--all are summed up in\r\nChrist's words, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour as\r\nthyself,' and 'Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your\r\nservant.'\" Christ's teaching had inspired each struggle for truth from\r\nthe Crusades to Lepanto, had destroyed feudalism, was destroying now\r\nthe aristocracy of blood; Poles and Greeks had marched to freedom's\r\nbattles under the flag of Jesus and His mother. And, above all, Christ\r\ngave the promise of indefinite religious progress,--a promise, which\r\nclosed the mouths of those who would arbitrarily pin men to a fixed\r\ndoctrine. 'The Spirit of truth shall abide with you for ever, ... and\r\nshall teach you all things.' \"On the eve of his accepted sacrifice,\r\nwhen his mighty love for his brethren lit up the darkness of the\r\nfuture, he had sight of the continuous revelation of the Spirit\r\nthrough humanity.\" This was the 'eternal gospel' of the mystics of the\r\nmiddle ages; and Christ's promise stood true to-day. \"God forgive\r\nyou,\" he wrote to a Catholic friend, \"you do not understand\r\nChrist,--Christ who died that humanity may some day free itself to\r\nrise to God by its own strength.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused anxiously before he declared himself no Christian. His\r\ntemperament and outlook on life were essentially Christian; he tried\r\nto read new meanings into Christian doctrines; words of Christian\r\nprayer came naturally to his lips; Christmas Day was \"sacred\" to him.\r\nSeveral times in early life he cherished schemes of reform within the\r\nchurch; for some years he doubted how far religious development could\r\nbe built on Christian foundations, whether the new church would be \"an\r\napplication of Christianity\" or \"a religion to succeed\" it. At all\r\nevents Christian ethics would remain. \"The morality of Christ is\r\neternal; humanity will add to it, but will not take from it one word.\"\r\nAnd for long yet Christianity would abide, the greatest of the creeds.\r\n\"This will reach you on Christmas Day,\" he wrote to an English friend.\r\n\"I am not a Christian, I belong to what I believe to be a still purer\r\nand higher Faith; but its time has not yet come; and until that day\r\nthe Christian manifestation remains the most sacred revelation of the\r\never-onward progressing spirit of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBut that its doctrine and its cult must some day pass, that its ethics\r\nneeded supplementing, he had convinced himself, at all events as early\r\nas his Swiss days. He wasted little time in attacking particular\r\narticles of the Christian faith, for analytical criticism was always\r\nhateful to him. But he thought it had certain essential imperfections,\r\nbecause of which it failed, and was bound to fail to content the\r\npresent reach of human knowledge or inspire men's activities. He\r\ncharged it, firstly, with not sanctifying the things of earth. The\r\nchurch taught that the world was evil, life here an expiation, heaven\r\nthe soul's true home. At one time he appealed against the church to\r\nChrist's own teaching, to texts that spoke of God's will being done on\r\nearth, of power given to Christ in earth, of the promise that the meek\r\nshould inherit the earth. In later life he qualified this reading of\r\nthe gospel. Jesus, \"a soul blessed with such mighty love and perfect\r\nharmony between thought and action,\" could not fail to realise the\r\nharmony of earth and heaven. But \"while he stood and stands alone,\r\nsupreme over all other great religious reformers in everything that\r\nconcerns the heart and affections, his intellectual grasp did not\r\nextend beyond the requirements of a single epoch.\" At the time in\r\nwhich he lived, he \"saw no possible mission for the sake of the\r\nbrethren whom he loved, save by moral regeneration, by creating a\r\ncountry of freemen and equals in heaven. He wished to show mankind how\r\nit could find salvation and redemption in spite of and in opposition\r\nto the world.\" Great Christian statesmen and thinkers of a later\r\ntime,--Gregory VII. and Thomas Aquinas,--had tried to bring the\r\ntemporal under the spiritual law. But they had failed, and the normal\r\nChristianity of the day was fatally divorced from religion and\r\npolitics and art and science. It left the bigger part of life without\r\nGod's law to guide it. It told men to renounce the world, when their\r\nduty was to live in it and battle in it and better it.\r\n\r\nChristianity again came short, because it left out of ken the\r\ncollective life of the race. The conception was an impossible one at\r\nthe time in which Christ lived; and its absence maimed men's knowledge\r\nof God, and shortened their power to attain to the Divine Ideal.\r\nChristianity pointed, indeed, to \"salvation, that is perfection\"; but\r\nit recognised no instrument beyond \"the weak, unequal, isolated,\r\nineffective strength of the individual.\" Mazzini's criticism came to\r\nthis: Christianity tells each man to perfect himself by his own\r\nstrength and God's; but his spiritual growth is conditioned by the\r\ngrowth of the men around him, and therefore his own perfecting\r\ndepends on the progress of the race, the common search for good, that\r\nlinks all men together and the generations to one another. Mazzini\r\nalways regarded the French Revolution as the political expression, the\r\n\"daughter\" of Christianity, and there the depreciation of the race,\r\nthe exaggeration of the individual had borne their necessary fruit of\r\nmoral selfishness and social anarchy. Yet again, though Christ had\r\npromised the continuous teaching of his Spirit, ever leading to new\r\ntruth, the doctrine of redemption was inconsistent with any theory of\r\nprogress. There was no Fall; man had begun at the bottom and had been\r\ntending upwards ever since. Salvation was for men, not from a single,\r\nisolated act, but from the slow, unceasing, inevitable working of the\r\nprovidential scheme. The individual came nearer the divine, not by\r\nfaith in Christ's sacrifice, but by his own works, by sacrifice of\r\nself, by faith in the \"ideal that every man is called to incarnate in\r\nhimself.\" And because of these imperfections in its theory of life,\r\nChristianity had ceased to be a vitalising force. For some it had\r\nbecome an ethical system, for others a philosophy, while men needed a\r\nreligion. Politics and art and science had gone their own ways.\r\nChristian morality knew not patriotism. Charity was its only remedy\r\nfor social wrongs, and charity was impotent to stop the springs of\r\npoverty. Men gave lip-service to Christ's teaching, but it had no\r\nbinding influence on their lives. It offered no solution for their\r\nperplexities; it was no longer a faith that could move mountains or\r\nremould the modern world. Its day had gone, and all the efforts of\r\nneo-Christians or Christian Socialists or Old Catholics to make it\r\nanswer to modern needs were bound to fail, as the neo-Platonists had\r\nfailed in their day to galvanise paganism. \"Jesus warned you, when on\r\nearth,\" he said to \"the Anglo-Saxon Christian Socialists,\" \"that you\r\ncannot put new wine into old bottles.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Mazzini's criticism of Christianity, not always consistent\r\nwith itself, sometimes confounding Christ's thought with others'\r\nperversions of it, sometimes failing to recognise how many-sided a\r\nphenomenon is Christianity, sometimes inaccurately tracing its actual\r\nresults in history and modern life. His attitude towards it may be\r\nsummed up thus. He retained its belief in the omnipotence of the\r\nspiritual; its faith in God and in His providential working; its\r\nsupreme veneration for the character and moral teaching of Jesus; its\r\ninsistence on moral perfection and not material interest as the end of\r\nlife; its call to love and sacrifice of self; its belief in\r\nimmortality; its aspiration to the Church Universal. He rejected the\r\ndivinity of Christ, the doctrine of a mediator, the antagonism between\r\nmatter and spirit and the consequent neglect of the things of earth;\r\nits inability to grasp God's law of progress; its non-acceptance\r\n(though the Church had partially recognised it) of Humanity as the\r\ninterpreter of that law.\r\n\r\nBut the new faith, which was to grow out of and supplement\r\nChristianity, must have its doctrines too, its positive basis of\r\nbelief. \"There is no life in the void. Life is faith in something, a\r\nsystem of secure beliefs, grounded on an immutable foundation, which\r\ndefines the end, the destiny of man, and embraces all his faculties to\r\npoint them to that end.\" Mankind, he said, is weary of negations, of\r\nthe hustling conflict of opinions. \"We must prepare for it an abode\r\nfor the day of rest,--something on earth, where it may lay its weary\r\nhead,--something in heaven on which its eyes may stay,--a tent to\r\nshield it from the storm, a spring to quench its thirst in the vast\r\nunbounded desert where it travels.\" Dogma is essential; it is ever\r\n\"sovereign over practical morality,\" for \"morality is only its\r\nconsequence, its application, its translation into practice.\" By dogma\r\nhe meant \"a body of ideas, which, starting from a fixed point,\r\nembraces all human faculties and employs them for the conquest of a\r\npositive, practical end, which is for the good of the majority; the\r\nexposition of a principle and its consequences in relation to life's\r\nmanifestation and operations in the moral and the industrial world,\r\nboth for the individual and for society.\" The thinker apprehends it,\r\nscience and society prepare the medium for its adoption, the best and\r\nwisest incarnate it in their lives, then it \"enters the soul of the\r\nmany and becomes a religious axiom.\" In other words it is an ethical\r\nand political system, so based on the eternal verities of life, so\r\npenetrated by the spiritual sense of the race, that it ceases to be a\r\ncold and abstract code, and takes the warmth and colour of religion,\r\ncompelling men's souls and pushing them irresistibly to social duty.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the body of doctrine for the Church of the future, as\r\nMazzini conceived it? First, as the root of all, belief in God, \"the\r\nauthor of all existence, the living, absolute thought, of which our\r\nworld is a ray and the universe an incarnation\"; \"a sphere inviolable,\r\neternal, supreme over all humanity, independent of chance or error or\r\nblind and interrupted operation.\" God, then, exists objectively, as\r\nmaker and ruler of the universe. Man discovers God; he does not\r\ncreate Him. In his criticism of Renan, Mazzini attacks any theory of\r\nthe subjectivity of the Divine. Pantheism (that is, the \"materialist\r\npantheism\" of Spinoza, not the \"spiritual pantheism\" of St Paul and\r\nWordsworth and Shelley) confounds subject and object, good and evil,\r\nand leaves no place for Providence or human liberty; it is a\r\n\"philosophy of the squirrel in the cage,\" condemning mankind to go for\r\never rotating in a circle. Deism is a \"sordid\" creed, which relegates\r\nGod to heaven and ignores his ever-operating life in creation. Mazzini\r\ngives no clue how he would have reconciled an all-creating\r\nDeity,--author therefore of good and evil,--with a beneficent and\r\nloving Providence.\r\n\r\nHe finds the proofs of an actual, objective God, first, in man\r\nhimself, in the universal intuition of the Divine. \"God exists. God\r\nlives in our conscience, in the conscience of Humanity, in the\r\nUniverse around us. Our conscience calls to him in our most solemn\r\nmoments of sorrow and joy. He who would deny God before a starry\r\nnight, before the graves of his dearest ones, before the martyr's\r\nscaffold, is a very wretched or a very guilty man.\" The fact that we\r\naspire to the best and infinite proves that there is a best and\r\ninfinite, that is God. And, next, the fact of existence bears witness\r\nto an intelligent creator. \"God exists because we exist.\" \"Call it God\r\nor what you like,\" he once said, \"there is life which we have not\r\ncreated, but which is given.\" \"The Universe displays him in its order\r\nand harmony, in the intelligent design shown in its working and its\r\nlaw.\" And this law is \"one and immutable.\" \"Everything is\r\npreordained\"; \"God and law are identical terms\"; \"'chance' has no\r\nmeaning, and was only invented to express man's ignorance.\" \"There can\r\nbe no miracle, nothing supernatural, no possible violation of the laws\r\nthat rule the Universe\"; though he realised how big is the unknown of\r\nnature, and his rejection of the supernatural did not prevent him from\r\nbeing a mystic. But God is not only intellect but love, not only Lord\r\nbut Educator. His law embraces Humanity as well as nature, the moral\r\nas well as the physical world. He manifests himself \"in the\r\nintelligent design, that regulates the life of Humanity\" and leads man\r\never upwards towards perfection. \"Everything, from the grain of sand\r\nto the plant, from the plant to Man, has its own law; how then can\r\nHumanity be without its law?\"\r\n\r\nMazzini seems to have recognised the difficulty of reconciling the\r\noneness and eternity of law with an ever-active Providence, which\r\nconcerned itself, for instance, with present-day problems of democracy\r\nand nationality. He found a solution in making the law consist in an\r\ninevitable tendency to progress, both in the material and, still more,\r\nin the spiritual world. The law of Progress, which perhaps he\r\ndeveloped from Lessing, is \"a supreme formula of the creative\r\nactivity, eternal, omnipotent, universal as itself.\" His 'Progress' is\r\nnot equivalent to 'evolution.' He formulated it, of course, before\r\nDarwin's day; so far as I know, he never refers to Darwinism, and\r\nprobably never studied it. If he had, it would certainly have been to\r\ncondemn it. But he would have attacked it, not from the scientific\r\nside, but on _à priori_ grounds. Progress, he would have said, rules\r\nthe material world, but it rules it through the spiritual, by virtue\r\nof an inherent God-implanted tendency and the operation of the human\r\nwill. He would have rejected as derogatory to the divine idea an\r\nevolution, which results from the struggle of unthinking and non-moral\r\nforces. He condemned unsparingly, as we shall see, the explanation of\r\nsocial facts by the bare brute struggle of individuals or the\r\ndevelopment of material phenomena. Progress is essentially a moral\r\nphenomenon, and postulates the search, not for self, but for\r\nself-sacrifice. It is \"the slow, but necessary, inevitable development\r\nof every germ of good, of every holy idea.\" Sometimes, indeed, he is\r\ntrapped by the ambiguity of 'self-realisation,' and speaks of \"the\r\ninstinct and necessity, which urges every living being to the fuller\r\ndevelopment of all the germs, the faculties, the forces, the life\r\nwithin it.\" But it is clear that he is always really thinking of the\r\ndevelopment of good alone. God's plan \"slowly, progressively makes man\r\ndivine.\" Whither Humanity ultimately goes, we know not; but we know\r\nthere is no limit to the march; and every age, every religion, each\r\nnew philosophy enlarges its apprehension of the end.\r\n\r\nHe curiously dovetails personal immortality into the doctrine. For the\r\nindividual soul the process of perfecting goes on beyond the limits of\r\nthis world. Life \"here-down\" (as he called it in English) is so short,\r\nso full of imperfection, that the soul cannot in its earthly\r\npilgrimage climb the ladder that leads to God. And yet intuition and\r\ntradition tell us that the ideal will be reached some day, somewhere;\r\nin words, that almost suggest that he had read the parallel passage in\r\nWordsworth, he speaks of memory as the consciousness of the soul's\r\nprogress up from earlier existences; love would be a mockery, if it\r\ndid not last beyond the grave; the unity of the race implies a link\r\nbetween the living and the dead; science teaches there is no death but\r\nonly transformation. He held passionately to his faith in immortality,\r\nand he believed that the dear ones he had lost were watching over him\r\nand bringing his best aspirations. The individual soul, he thought,\r\nprogresses through a series of re-incarnations, each leading it to a\r\nmore perfect development, and the rapidity of its advance depends on\r\nits own purification. And as the individual has his progress through a\r\nseries of existences, so collective man progresses ever through the\r\nhuman generations. \"No, God eternal, thy word is not all spoken, thy\r\nthought not yet revealed in all its fulness. It still creates, and\r\nwill create through long ages beyond the grasp of human reckoning. The\r\nages, that are past, have revealed but fragments to us. Our mission is\r\nnot finished. We hardly know its source, we do not know its final end;\r\ntime and our discoveries only extend its borders. From age to age it\r\nascends to destinies unknown to us, seeking its own law, of which we\r\nread but a few lines. From initiative to initiative, through the\r\nseries of thy progressive incarnations, it purifies and extends the\r\nformula of Sacrifice; it feels for its own way; it learns thy faith,\r\neternally progressive.\" If once we recognised this progressive\r\nevolution of religion and morals, there would be no room for pure\r\nscepticism; we should see that an expired form of faith is not wrong\r\nbut imperfect, that it needs not destroying but supplementing. \"Every\r\nreligion instils into the human soul one more drop of the universal\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nBut does not this mean fatalism,--the same fatalism, with which he\r\ncharged the Christian doctrine of redemption, the fatalism, with which\r\nhe would have charged the evolutionists, had he known them? If the\r\nprogress of humanity is preordained, what need for man to use his puny\r\npowers? Mazzini met the difficulty thus. True, evil cannot permanently\r\ntriumph, God's progress must go on; but its quicker or slower\r\nrealisation is in our hands. \"The slow unfolding of history proceeds\r\nunder the continuous action of two factors, the work of individuals\r\nand the providential scheme. Time and space are ours; we can quicken\r\nprogress or retard it, we cannot stop it.\" And this, because progress,\r\nbeing essentially a moral phenomenon, must be realised in the world of\r\nthought and will, before it can be translated into practice. Mazzini\r\ndid not seriously concern himself with the metaphysics of determinism;\r\nhe took the common-sense position that the will is free; \"no\r\nphilosophic sophisms,\" he said, \"can cancel the testimony of remorse\r\nand martyrdom.\" It depends on a man's choice of good or evil, whether\r\nhe approaches nearer the ideal in himself, and therefore whether, so\r\nfar as his influence lies, progress is realised in society. Thus, in\r\nhis strained and inconclusive argument, God's providential working is\r\nreconciled both with human free will and the oneness of law.\r\n\r\nProgress, then!--onwards to the great Ideal, the ideal which \"stands\r\nin God, outside and independent of ourselves,\" which as yet we know\r\nbut darkly, but which every generation sees more clearly; fixed,\r\ntherefore, and \"absolute in the Divine Idea,\" but gradually revealed\r\nto man, \"approached\" but never \"reached\" in this life, ever\r\nprovisional and shifting for us as knowledge grows. The world is no\r\nmere necessary sequence of material phenomena, but a spiritual stream,\r\nthat, swift or sluggish be its course, flows irresistibly to God. The\r\nexisting fact is not the law; choice between good and evil, heroism,\r\nsacrifice are not illusions; conscience, the intuition of the ideal,\r\nthe power of will, and moral force are ultimate and mastering\r\nspiritual facts. The divine design controls it all, and man has\r\nliberty to help God's plan. And he who knows this, knows that \"a\r\nsupreme power guards the road, by which believers journey towards\r\ntheir goal,\" and he will be \"bold with God through God.\" The\r\ncrusaders' cry 'God wills it' is for him, and his are the courage and\r\nconsistency and power of sacrifice, that come to those who know they\r\nbattle on the side of God. It was this conviction that Mazzini wished\r\nhis followers to have, when he pleaded that Young Italy should be as a\r\nreligion. For \"political parties fall and die; religious parties never\r\ndie till they have conquered.\"\r\n\r\nBut how shall man search for the ideal, how learn the providential\r\ndesign? Mazzini has his answer clear: \"tradition and conscience,\"[35]\r\nor, as we may translate them, experience and intuition, \"are the two\r\nwings given to the human soul to reach to truth.\" First, then, the\r\nindividual consciousness and that in a two-fold sense. Truth is truth\r\nonly to the individual, when he apprehends it for himself. Sometimes\r\nMazzini speaks as if he accepted the whole Protestant doctrine of\r\nindividual judgment, and in a sense he does. Each man must prove by\r\nhis own consciousness every interpretation of God's law, whether it be\r\ntrue or not. But this gift of judgment only comes by righteousness.\r\n\"In moments of holy thought something of the great flood of man's\r\nknowledge of God's law may come to every man.\" To learn it, he must\r\n\"purify himself from low passion, from every guilty inclination, from\r\nevery idolatrous superstition\"; and truth will come \"in the most\r\nsecret aspirations of the soul, in the instincts of itself, that hover\r\nround in supreme hours of affection and devotion.\" But, though Mazzini\r\ndoes not very clearly distinguish, he seems generally to be thinking\r\nof something more. It is for the consciousness not only to apprehend\r\nand appropriate for the individual truths already known to the race,\r\nbut sometimes it is its privilege to spell a new line of God's law.\r\nGlimpses of new truth may come to the collective intuition of a\r\npeople. There are times, when \"the spirit of God descends upon the\r\ngathered multitudes,\" and _vox populi_ is _vox Dei_. He would deny the\r\nright of spiritual discovery to a people enslaved by low, material\r\nimpulses; but in a nation moved by some great aspiration, when thought\r\nstrikes thought, and enthusiasm kindles enthusiasm, there truth will\r\nprobably be found. But though in such times of faith and struggle the\r\npeople has its \"great collective intuitions,\" though sometimes \"the\r\npale, modest star that God has placed in simple bosoms\" comes nearer\r\ntruth than genius comes, it is normally for the best and wisest to\r\ndiscover truth. Only men of holy lives and genius are God's \"born\r\ninterpreters\"; his apostles, those \"who love their brethren most and\r\nare ready to suffer for their love, and those on whom God has\r\nbestowed surpassing gifts of intellect, provided that their intellect\r\nis virtuous and desires the good.\" But even such as these can find\r\ntruth only by interrogating the dim silent workings of the people's\r\nmind. Light comes to no man by his own unaided effort; and the\r\nsolitary thinker may mistake his own conceit for truth. \"Great men can\r\nonly spring from a great people, just as an oak, however high it may\r\ntower above every other tree in the forest, depends on the soil whence\r\nit derives its nourishment. The soil must be enriched by countless\r\ndecaying leaves.\"\r\n\r\nBut the untested intuition, whether of man of genius or people, is by\r\nitself no sufficient criterion of truth. Every heresy has its martyrs.\r\nThere is a more unerring interpreter of God's law, known imperfectly\r\nto Catholicism, but neglected by Protestantism and the individualist\r\nschools of the day,--the consciousness of the race, checked and\r\ncorrected and perfected by each succeeding generation, the \"common\r\nconsensus of humanity,\" \"the tradition, not of one school or one\r\nreligion or one age, but of all the schools and all religions and all\r\nthe ages in their succession,\" for \"no one man or people or school can\r\npresume to discover all the law of God.\" The seeker after truth will\r\nfind it most surely in \"the severe study of the universal tradition,\r\nwhich is life's manifestation in Humanity.\" Humanity (the conception\r\nof which he seems to have derived from Vico and Herder), \"the living\r\nword of God,\" \"the collective and continuous being,\" is \"the only\r\ninterpreter of God's law.\" \"Humanity,\" said a thinker of the last\r\ncentury,[36] \"is a man who is ever learning. Individuals die; but the\r\ntruth they thought, the good they wrought, is not lost with them;\r\nHumanity garners it, and the men who walk over their graves, have\r\ntheir profit from it. Each of us is born to-day in an atmosphere of\r\nideas and beliefs, that are the work of all Humanity before us; each\r\nof us brings unconsciously some element, more or less valuable, for\r\nthe life of Humanity that comes after. The education of Humanity grows\r\nlike those Eastern pyramids, to which each passer-by adds his stone.\r\nWe pass, the travellers of a day, called away to complete our\r\nindividual education elsewhere; the education of Humanity shines by\r\nflashes in each one of us, but unveils its full radiance slowly,\r\nprogressively, continuously in Humanity. From one task to another,\r\nfrom one faith to another, step by step Humanity conquers a clearer\r\nvision of its life, its mission, of God and of his law.\" And here\r\nagain comes strength. \"It matters little,\" he replied to Carlyle,\r\n\"that _our_ individual powers be of the smallest amount in relation to\r\nthe object to be attained; we know that the powers of millions of men,\r\nour brethren, will succeed to the work after us, in the same\r\ntrack,--we know that the object attained, be it when it may, will be\r\nthe result of _all_ our efforts combined.\" But he who would have this\r\nstrength, must needs respect Humanity's tradition, must recognise that\r\nthe race is more likely to be right than his own poor intellect. He\r\nturned angrily on the \"barbarian\" schools, that would sweep away the\r\npast, and create Humanity anew on some arbitrary plan. Humanity spurns\r\nbuilders of utopias; and preachers of new principles, the masses\r\nfervent for some new idea, must prove their beliefs by the infallible\r\ntest of tradition. Mazzini hardly recognised how difficult and vague\r\nand diverse might be the detailed interpretation of tradition, and he\r\nwas never very modest in making his own inductions. He believed that\r\nhistory proves that there are certain \"immortal elements of human\r\nnature,\"--education, fatherland, liberty, association, family,\r\nproperty, religion; and the theorist, who offends any one of these, is\r\nin conflict with God's law. In the conjunction, then, of these two\r\ncriteria and no otherwise stands the discovery of the truth. Neither\r\nsuffices without the other; and therefore Catholicism and\r\nProtestantism, each of which had apprehended one alone, are\r\nincomplete. Tradition by itself leads to stagnation; intuition alone\r\nto chance and anarchy. But \"where you find the general permanent voice\r\nof humanity agreeing with the voice of your conscience, be sure that\r\nyou hold in your grasp something with absolute truth,--gained and for\r\never yours.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that Mazzini parts himself from the intuitive school,\r\nwhen he admits experience as the surer criterion of truth, when,\r\nagain, he says that the intellect is necessary to verify the instincts\r\nof consciousness. On the other hand he is a pure intuitionist in his\r\nconception of the function of genius, for genius meant with him\r\nsomething other far than 'the infinite capacity of taking pains'; it\r\nwas a God-given, almost mystical faculty, that saw truth by its own\r\nnatural, unaided light, that possessed her forcibly, not wooed her\r\ntimidly. He is an intuitionist again when he holds, as obviously he\r\ndoes hold, that it is for the pure in heart to see God, that religious\r\nand ethical enquiry depends for its results on the cultivation of the\r\nmoral sense, and therefore more on the moral than on the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the enquirer. And, even when he sides with the opposite\r\nschool, it does not mean that he trusts to any scientific process of\r\nratiocination. He has more confidence in the unconscious reasoning, by\r\nwhich the race has gathered its experience, and which allows no room\r\nfor the errors of the solitary thinker. He did not neglect\r\nmetaphysics, but he was little influenced by them, and he would have\r\nsided with 'the vulgar' against 'the philosophers.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMazzini's conception of Humanity was essentially related to his\r\ncraving for religious and moral unity. Fighter though he was ever, and\r\nrecognising somewhat the value of \"the holy conflict of ideas,\" he did\r\nnot see how much in an imperfect age progress depends upon the clash\r\nof creeds and conflict of opinions. He was so weary of debate, so\r\nconfident that others must come to the same truth that he had. As far\r\nas humanity had learnt God's law, all should bow to it; and he looked\r\nto a true national education to generate this unity of faith. As unity\r\nwas the law of God's universe, so unity was the condition of\r\nhumanity's advance. Without it \"there may be movement, but it is not\r\nuniform or concentrated.\" Therefore \"the world thirsts for unity,\"\r\n\"democracy tends to unity,\" and every great religion must of necessity\r\nstrive to be catholic. But now \"discord is everywhere,\"--creeds that\r\ncurse one another, warring states, class hatreds, party bitterness,\r\nthe search for truth itself a source of conflict. It is time to end\r\nthis wasteful strife, and march together, \"reverently seeking the\r\nfuture city, a new heaven and a new earth, which may unite in one, in\r\nlove of God and man, in faith in a common aim, all those, who tossed\r\nbetween fears of the present and doubtings of the future, now stray in\r\nintellectual and moral anarchy.\" \"We must found moral unity, the\r\nCatholicism of humanity,\" \"the unity of belief that Christ promised\r\nfor all peoples,\" \"a unity which binds the sects in one sole people of\r\nbelievers, and on the churches and conventicles and chapels raises the\r\ngreat temple, Humanity's Pantheon to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe new faith, like the old, must have its visible embodiment.\r\n\"Sacred,\" he said, \"is the church, but not a false church.\" At the\r\ntime of the Roman Republic, a liberal cleric warned the Catholics that\r\n\"if the church did not march with the people, the people would march\r\nwithout the church, aye, outside it and against it.\" \"Against the\r\nchurch, no!\" Mazzini replied; \"we will march from the church of the\r\npast to the church of the future, from the dead church to the living,\r\nto the church of freemen and equals. There is room enough for such a\r\nchurch betwixt the Vatican and Capitol.\" Sometimes he thought that the\r\nnew church would have its cult, a cult \"which would gather believers\r\ntogether in feasts of equality and love,\" where men of saintly lives\r\nwould preach plain truths of duty and inspire enthusiasm. And in some\r\nundefined way the authority of the church was to be supreme in the\r\nstate. Gregory VII.'s principles, he says, were right, but erred in\r\nthe application.[37] \"Religion will be the soul, the thought of the\r\nnew state.\" \"Power is one; religion, the law of the spirit, sits in\r\nthe seat of government; its interpreters, the temporal power, reduce\r\nit to practice.\" It is true that till men find a common faith, while\r\nthe existing church is a church only in name, the state must protect\r\nitself by the separation of the two. But the Cavourian 'free church in\r\na free state' means religious indifference and \"an atheist law\"; and a\r\nhigher order will terminate \"the absurd divorce between the temporal\r\nand spiritual.\" In his later years it seems to have been a fixed idea\r\nwith him to get some kind of state creed recognised by the Italian\r\nparliament. Some day \"a few men, reverenced for their doctrine and\r\nvirtue, their intellect and love and sacrifice of self,\" would form a\r\n\"supreme Council\" for Europe and America, proclaiming new truths and\r\nthe common duties of the nations; while under them would sit national\r\ncouncils to define the several duties of each people. He seems to have\r\nexpected that at first these councils would have a voluntary basis\r\noutside the state, but that eventually they would be recognised by law\r\nas the supreme international and national authorities, and, as such\r\nwould be the authoritative exponents of tradition and control\r\neducation. And with this reconciliation of the spiritual and temporal\r\nthe world would find that real authority, of which it stood in need.\r\nFor authority in itself was a good and not an evil thing; and on the\r\nwreck of the existing phantasms of authority, another would arise,\r\ndemocratic, based on the common will, loving liberty and progress,\r\nwith virtue to initiate and inspire, the unexhausted fountain of\r\nreform, correlating and organising men's various labours for the\r\ncommonwealth. For such an authority \"the world is ever searching, and\r\nsave in it and through it, it has no life or progress.\"\r\n\r\nThat the new religion,--one which in its time must pass too,--would\r\ncome, he had no doubt. He looked for the day when a Council of the\r\nbest and wisest (whether or not identical with the supreme European\r\ncouncil) would define the articles of the new faith. It might be \"a\r\ntruly Oecumenical Council of virtuous intellects,\" or it might spring\r\nfrom one \"free people, which had found brotherhood in the worship of\r\nduty and the ideal.\" It was the dream of his life that this faith\r\nwould issue forth from Rome,--Rome, the only city to whose authority\r\nEurope had bowed, Rome, the seat of the old false religion, whose fall\r\nmust come ere the new one could arise. But, whatever were the more\r\nimpatient hopes of earlier years, he came to see that the dawn was yet\r\nafar. Long missionary labours must come first. Still, the time, he\r\nthought, was ripe at all events for a \"church of the precursors,\" and\r\ngladly he would have led its builders. In younger days, when the\r\ndeliverance of Italy seemed near, he prayed that God would let him\r\ngive the rest of life to the greater work. Afterwards, when the new\r\nItaly delayed its coming, and age and weakness came ere the first task\r\nwas done, the dream of a missionary call faded slowly away, to be\r\ncherished to the end as the great unfulfilled ambition of his life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] _Conscienza_; in Mazzini's use of the word, it covers both\r\n'consciousness' and 'conscience.' Mazzini himself translated it by\r\n'conscience' (see below, p. 362), where 'consciousness' would be more\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\n[36] Pascal.\r\n\r\n[37] In the undated letter, quoted by Signor Donaver in the _Rassegna\r\nNazionale_, Oct. 1, 1890, he speaks of a reformed Catholic church\r\nbecoming \"the guide of the State and not its servant\"; but I think he\r\nsays rather more than he really felt in order to conciliate an old\r\nclerical friend, to whom the letter seems to be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nDuty\r\n\r\n     Morality depends on an Ideal--Criticism of the theory of\r\n     Rights and Utilitarianism--Happiness not the end of\r\n     life--Life is a mission--Work for the sake of Duty--Thought\r\n     useless without action--Power of the principle of\r\n     Duty--Duties to self; family; country.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this religious foundation Mazzini constructed his code of\r\nethics,--Christian, very Christian in its spirit, essentially modern\r\nin its application; the noblest morality that has sought to answer to\r\nthe needs of a democratic society. The law of Progress judges all\r\naction by the Ideal, and the sole standard of conduct lies in what a\r\nman does that the Ideal may be better realised in himself and others.\r\nWithout the recognition of such a universal law, demanding their\r\ncooperation and conformity, there can be no common rule for men; life\r\nbecomes the resultant of clashing interests; its line of advance, if\r\nadvance there be, depends upon mere chance. True education is\r\nimpossible, because there is no consensus on its aim; we come to value\r\ncharacter, as he complained that Carlyle did, not by its goodness, but\r\nby its energy and persistence, whether it be to good or evil ends.\r\nEverywhere in actual life, the neglect of the Ideal means worship of\r\nbrute force, cowardly acquiescence in the existing fact, the absence\r\nof all striving for a better state. But with the apprehension of the\r\nIdeal and of the Divine law, three things follow, incentive to\r\nprogress. Every man has a rule to guide his individual actions; men of\r\ngood will will associate their efforts for a common end; and they can\r\nappeal to a supreme, positive law against those who break it. \"In the\r\nconsciousness of your law of life, which is the law of God, stands the\r\nfoundation of your morality, the rule of your actions and your duties,\r\nthe measure of your responsibility.\" \"If there be no Mind supreme over\r\nall human minds, who can save us from the caprice of our fellows,\r\nshould they chance to be stronger than ourselves? If there be no law,\r\nsacred and inviolable, not created by man, what standard can we find\r\nto judge whether an act be just or not? In the name of whom or what\r\ncan we protest against oppression and inequality? Without God, we have\r\nno other law but Fact.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini lived too soon to have to meet a school that denied morality,\r\nas that school is developed to-day. But he found a numerous and\r\npowerful school, that built morality on what he believed to be\r\nradically wrong foundations. The theory of Rights, since the\r\nprecursors of the French Revolution popularized it, had dominated\r\nLiberal thought, except for a handful of thinkers,--Lamennais,\r\nCarlyle, Emerson. It had had, he owned, its temporary value, as the\r\nnecessary rebellion against fatalism and immobility and privilege. \"It\r\ndestroyed the empire of necessity\"; it finally asserted the dignity of\r\nthe individual, so that \"God's creature might appear, ready to work,\r\nradiant with power and will.\" \"Only, it stopped short of God,\" for the\r\nideal was hidden from it. Its work was to destroy, and it was unfitted\r\nfor an age that needed a constructive code of ethics. Mazzini included\r\nUtilitarianism in his condemnation, as a mere variant of the principle.\r\nHe knew that Bentham repudiated the connection; but Bentham's\r\ncriticism, he thought, was aimed at Blackstone and the theorists of an\r\nimaginary compact, not at a system, which based itself on the _à\r\npriori_ claims of the individual. The spirit and the consequences were\r\nthe same in both schools. Bentham and the French alike appealed to the\r\ngetting side of man and not the giving; both thought of the individual\r\nin his self-regarding rather than in his social aspect; neither had an\r\nideal or any imperative binding law for men; both neglected the\r\nstrongest impulses to right action,--enthusiasm and love and sense of\r\nduty. They supplied no guide for conduct; they gave no definition of\r\nhappiness, nor therefore of what men's rights should be, and left each\r\nindividual to interpret them by his own fancy. They gave no answer to\r\nthe question, For what are men to use their liberty? though on the\r\nanswer depended the whole value of rights. Thus happiness, left\r\nwithout a theory of life's purpose to define it, slided easily into\r\nthe satisfaction of man's lower part. \"Any theory of happiness will\r\nmake men fall, soon or late, into the suicide of the noblest elements\r\nof human nature, will make them go, like Faust, to seek life's elixir\r\nin the witch's kitchen.\" Man's material interests must indeed be cared\r\nfor, but not for their own sake; they were only instruments to higher\r\nends; they must be satisfied because, only when men have leisure and\r\neducation and a decent home, the moral life has room to grow. If they\r\nbecame the end and not the means, they led to torpor of the nation's\r\nsoul, to the paralysis that comes, when men care for power and money\r\nonly, and a country measures its greatness by its riches and brute\r\nstrength. The whole position was a false one. No moral theory could\r\nwork, that made happiness the end of life. The Utilitarians mistook\r\nthe incident of the journey for the end. The spiritual side of\r\nman,--his social instincts, his yearnings after righteousness, the\r\npure uncalculating love that gives up life for duty,--all were outside\r\ntheir scheme. \"Martyrdom! Your theory has no inheritance in it. Jesus\r\nescapes your logic; Socrates, if you are consistent, must seem to you,\r\nas Plato did to Bentham, a sublime fool.\" Why should men die for their\r\nfellows, why suffer prison, exile, poverty, if happiness be the end of\r\nlife? Why should they toil on, knowing they would not see their\r\nlabour's fruits, to make life better for a future generation?\r\n\r\nThus the theory supplied no principle of moral action. You cannot, he\r\nwould say, by any theory of rights make men unselfish. He knew that\r\nwhen a man thinks of happiness, he will not be impartial between his\r\nown happiness and other men's, that directly he balances his rights\r\nagainst those of his fellows, he will, however unconsciously, weight\r\nthe scales in his own favour. It was impossible, he thought, on\r\nutilitarian principles to make men work for the happiness of the many.\r\nThe principle at once sets men thinking on the selfish side, and makes\r\nthem dole their good deeds with a thrifty hand. \"You have taught the\r\nrich man,\" he said, \"that society was constituted only to assure his\r\nrights, and you ask him then to sacrifice them all for the advancement\r\nof a class, with which he has no ties either of affection or custom.\r\nHe refuses. Will you call him bad? Why should he consent? He is only\r\nlogical.\" Mazzini often quoted the fate of fellow-revolutionists, who\r\nbegan life with generous impatience to fight the wrong, but when\r\nfailure came and disillusion, could not say farewell to joy, and\r\nbalanced self and duty, till \"scepticism twined its serpent coils\r\naround them,\" and he \"saw that saddest of all things, the slow death\r\nof a soul.\" \"For God's sake,\" he wrote to an English friend on the\r\neducation of his son, \"do not teach him any Benthamite theory about\r\nhappiness either individual or collective. A creed of individual\r\nhappiness would make him an egotist: a creed of collective happiness\r\nwill reach the same result soon or late. He will perhaps dream\r\nUtopias, fight for them, whilst young; then, when he will find that he\r\ncannot realise rapidly the dream of his soul, he will turn back to\r\nhimself and try to conquer his own happiness: sink into egotism.\"\r\nChrist taught another way. \"When he came and changed the face of the\r\nworld, he did not speak of rights to the rich, who had no need to win\r\nthem, nor to the poor, who would perhaps have imitated the rich and\r\nabused them. He did not speak of utility or self-interest to a race\r\ncorrupted by self-interest and utility. He spoke of Duty; he spoke of\r\nLove and Sacrifice and Faith; he said that he only should be first,\r\nwho had helped all men by his works. And when these words were\r\nwhispered in the ear of a dead society, they gave it life, they won\r\nthe millions, they won the world, and advanced the education of\r\nmankind one step onward.\"\r\n\r\nAnd,--as a final criticism,--the theory of rights solved nothing.\r\nMazzini did not waste argument on the automatic identity of public\r\nand private interests. Rights jostled against rights, the happiness of\r\none man or one class against another's. The theory could not reconcile\r\nthem or make peace between the jarring interests; rather, it made\r\nwar,--\"war not of blood but of gold and trickery; less manly than the\r\nother kind of war but equally destructive; a ruthless war, in which\r\nthe strong inevitably crush the weak and inexperienced.\" He attacked\r\nthe whole economy of free contract, which made the workman's condition\r\ndepend not on equity, but on the mere brute conflict of opposing\r\nrights, and resulted, he believed, of necessity in the workman's\r\ndefeat. What good were rights to men, who were too poor or ignorant to\r\nuse them? \"Why do I speak to you of your duties before I speak to you\r\nof your rights?\" he said to Italian working men in 1847. Because, he\r\nanswered, the theory of rights has triumphed for half a century,\r\nliberty has increased, wealth has multiplied, but the condition of the\r\npeople grows steadily worse in almost every country.\r\n\r\nMazzini's criticism was aimed at Bentham; had he read the later\r\nUtilitarians, as apparently he never did, he would no doubt have owned\r\nthat some of his arguments had no application to them. Happiness\r\nimplies a definition of happiness, and therefore an ideal; and that\r\nideal may be as high as was Mazzini's own. He made a theoretical\r\nmistake in not distinguishing between the object and the motive of\r\nlife; though, apart from this, he would have said that the desire of\r\nothers' good must be, not, as in the Utilitarian theory, one of life's\r\nmotives, but _the_ motive. But he was always essentially a moralist,\r\nwhose business was to find a practical, popular, effective rule of\r\nconduct. He knew that the search for happiness meant the search for\r\npleasure, and that the search for pleasure ends in \"impotence and\r\nnothingness\"; that the difficulty is not so much to make men know the\r\ngood, as to make them in actual conduct rate the higher good above the\r\nlower; and that they will not do this if happiness is their object,\r\nsince the average man will then prefer the immediate and easy\r\nhappiness to the remoter and more difficult, still less will sacrifice\r\nhis own happiness for that of others. \"I should like,\" he says, \"to\r\nlook for the answer to the problem in a good mother's advice to her\r\nchild. There you would certainly find utility condemned as a basis of\r\neducation. Mothers know that, if happiness were made the object of\r\nlife down here, life almost always would be only too much a bitter\r\nirony.\" As for the individual, so for the many; and to bid the masses\r\nseek for pleasure without reference to the higher ends of life, was to\r\nlay up bitterness and vanity for them and evil for the nation. And no\r\nhedonism, no theory of rights, could supply an operating rule for\r\nconduct. Perhaps he underrated the value of the sense of individual\r\nrights, and did not see how in an imperfect society, where nobler\r\nrules are faint or wanting, it may give strength to human dignity and\r\nkill the slave and coward in men. But he knew that it could not make\r\nthem live and work for others. He had gone through it all in his own\r\nexperience; he had had unsurpassed opportunities for judging the\r\nsprings of action in other men, and he knew that there was nothing\r\nhere to inspire to steady, strenuous social service.\r\n\r\nAnd so he met the theory with an uncompromising repudiation of it\r\nall. \"Man has one right only, to be free from obstacles that prevent\r\nthe unimpeded fulfilment of his duties.\" Life is no search for\r\nhappiness, whether \"by railway shares, selfishness, contemplation,\" or\r\notherwise. \"Our aim is not the greatest possible happiness, but, as\r\nCarlyle said, the greatest possible nobleness.\" \"Pain and happiness,\r\nill fortune and good are incidents of the journey. When the wind blows\r\nand the rain falls, the traveller draws his cloak closer round,\r\npresses his hat on his head, and prepares to fight the storm. Anon the\r\nstorm leaves him, the sunshine breaks the clouds, and warms his frozen\r\nlimbs; the traveller smiles and blesses God. But do rain or sunshine\r\nchange his journey's end?\" The end was something other far than\r\nhappiness. Mazzini looked for a principle that would rate the moral\r\nabove the material, altruism above selfishness, humanity above the\r\nindividual; something that would reconcile where Rights divided, that\r\nwould make men reach to an ideal, and by it live and die for others.\r\n\"We must find an educative principle, to guide men to better things,\r\nto teach them constancy in sacrifice, to bind them to their brothers\r\nwithout making them dependant on any one man's theory or on the brute\r\nforce of the community. This principle is Duty. We must convince men\r\nthat they, sons of one God, have here on earth to carry out one\r\nlaw,--that each of us must live not to himself but others,--that the\r\nend of life is not to have more or less of happiness but to make\r\nourselves and others better,--that to fight injustice and error,\r\neverywhere, for our brothers' good, is not a right only but a\r\nduty,--duty we may not without sin neglect, duty that lasts long as\r\nlife.\" \"Life is a mission,\" the call that comes to every man to make\r\nthe ideal real. \"Life was given you by God, that you might use it for\r\nthe profit of Humanity; that you might so direct your individual\r\nfaculties, that they will develop your brothers' faculties, that by\r\nyour work you might add something to the collective work of bettering\r\nmen and finding Truth.\" Life is a war with evil; \"we cannot root it\r\nout down here, but we can wage undying battle with it, and\r\neverlastingly weaken its dominion.\" To such God's Providence has\r\ncalled us. The divine plan needs our conscious efforts to assist it,\r\nand the law, that rules the Universe, becomes a positive binding law\r\nof conduct. Man's bounden duty is everywhere and in all things to\r\nforward the progress of humanity, which is written in God's law. \"The\r\nsupreme virtue is sacrifice,--to think, work, fight, suffer, where our\r\nlot lies, not for ourselves but others, for the victory of good over\r\nevil.\"\r\n\r\nGod demands the whole of man. Negative, inactive goodness is nothing\r\nby itself. Our duty lies on earth, among our fellow-men, in the busy,\r\nthrobbing life around us, not in some vain selfish search for\r\nspiritual satisfaction. \"Rest is immoral. There is here-down and there\r\nought to be no rest.\" Our business is to make men and their\r\nsurroundings better, not live for ourselves in self-absorption or\r\næsthetic ecstasy or solitary thought and prayer. That is none other\r\nthan the search for happiness in subtle shape. \"The earth is our\r\nworkshop; we may not curse it, we must hallow it.\" \"God has placed you\r\nhere on earth; he has set around you millions of beings like\r\nyourselves, whose march keeps pace with yours, whose life finds\r\nsustenance in your life. He willed to save you from the perils of\r\nsolitary existence, and therefore gave you needs, which by yourselves\r\nyou cannot satisfy,--mastering social instincts, which are only latent\r\nin the brute creation and which distinguish you from it. He has placed\r\nthis world around you,--this world, that you call Matter, glorious in\r\nits beauty, teeming with life, life, which, remember, everywhere\r\ndisplays God's finger, but expects your work upon it and multiplies\r\nits powers according as your activities are multiplied. He has planted\r\nin you inextinguishable sympathies, pity for them that mourn, joy for\r\nthem that laugh, wrath against the oppressors of God's creatures, the\r\nimportunate searching for the truth. And you,\" he is addressing the\r\npietists, \"deny and despise those marks of your mission that God has\r\nlavished round you, you lay a curse upon his manifestations, when you\r\nbid us concentrate our strength in a work of inward purification,--a\r\nwork imperfect and impossible to the man who is alone.\" There is no\r\nvirtue in the cloistered life. There is \"nothing worse than\r\ndepression, nothing more enervating than self-contemplation.\" \"We are\r\nhere not to contemplate but to transform nature; and self almost\r\nalways lies at the bottom of contemplation. The world is not a\r\nspectacle, it is a field of battle, where all, who love the Just, the\r\nHoly, the Beautiful, must bear their part, be they soldiers or\r\ngenerals, conquerors or martyrs.\" \"Do not analyse,\" he once wrote; \"do\r\nnot light Psyche's lamp to examine and anatomise life. Do good around\r\nyou: preach what you believe to be the truth and act accordingly; then\r\ngo through life, looking forward.\"\r\n\r\nNor will God's servants take thought for their own salvation. \"God\r\nwill not ask us, 'What hast thou done for thy own soul?' but 'What\r\nhast thou done for the souls of others, the sister-souls I gave\r\nthee?'\" \"We cannot rise to God save by our brothers' souls, and we\r\nmust make them better and more pure, even though they ask us not.\"\r\n\"When I hear men say, 'There is a just man,' I ask, 'How many souls\r\nare saved by him?'\" And again, the mere passive love and apprehension\r\nof the truth are no fulfilling of God's law. Even the preaching of\r\ntruth avails not, unless the preacher strive for it in his daily life.\r\n\"Thought and action,\" so he never wearied of insisting, must go hand\r\nin hand. \"What good are ideas,\" he asked, \"unless you incarnate them\r\nin deeds?\" \"It is not enough that thought be grounded on truth; the\r\nthinker's life must visibly express it in his acts; there must be an\r\never living harmony between mind and morals, between the idea and its\r\napplication.\" \"Every thought, every desire of good, which we do not,\r\ncome what may, seek to translate into action, is a sin. God thinks in\r\nworking, and we must, at a distance, copy him.\" The great men of\r\nearth, of whom Jesus was the prototype, were those who wrought as well\r\nas thought,--missionaries, politicians, martyrs, as well as poets and\r\nphilosophers;--such men as Aeschylus and Dante, Pythagoras and\r\nSavonarola and Michelangelo,--most of them, he loved to think,\r\nItalians. The great nation was that, whose thought was fruitful in\r\ngreat action, which to high ideals linked noble deeds and taught its\r\nsons to work and die. \"He who sunders faith from works, thought from\r\naction, the moral man from the practical or political man, is not in\r\ntruth religious. He breaks the chain that binds earth and heaven.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore are we called to work, work without ceasing and with all our\r\npower, putting behind us fear and thought of self and looking for\r\nresults or praise of men; work all the more, when evil is strong\r\naround us and the way of truth is dark; work, if need be, even unto\r\ndeath. The law of sacrifice, which Christ left us for our heritage,\r\nfinds its highest, best expression in martyrdom. \"Life and death,\" he\r\nreplied, when attacked for sending young Italians to their doom in\r\ninsurrection, \"are both sacred: two angels of God, ministering alike\r\nto a higher end, the victory of truth and justice.\" Men may do more by\r\ntheir deaths than by their lives, and the memory of those, who die in\r\nthe service of their fellows, may inspire generations and win a\r\ncountry's freedom. \"It is not enough to follow the instincts of the\r\nheart,\" he wrote to an impulsive youth, \"not enough to let the\r\nenthusiasm of a good nature impel you to a good deed now and again.\r\nThis is the career of 'men of an impulse,' who are one degree lower\r\nthan 'men.' The admiration of the Beautiful, the Great, the Divine,\r\nthat I ask of you, must be constant in every hour, in every act.\" We\r\nmay work from love, while it is given us; but when love grows cold and\r\nenthusiasm fails and the damp night of doubt and disappointment\r\nsettles down, \"the simple knowledge of duty\" must be there, to bid us\r\nwork and for ever work. \"You must do good,\" he told another, \"for the\r\nsake of goodness only.\" Nor may we ask to see our work's results.\r\nResults will come to the race, if not to the individual. Men may see\r\nlittle fruit of their labours; the individual's struggles may end in\r\nvanity and disappointment. But the race profits from the seeming\r\nwaste. The individual, who is left by himself \"face to face with\r\ninfinity,\" loses courage, as he complained that Carlyle did, and\r\nslides into \"scepticism and misanthropy.\" But he will not faint, if he\r\nremembers that all Humanity is working to one end; he will know that\r\nit is not success that matters, but effort in the right direction.\r\n\"God measures not our strength but our intentions.\" \"Where you cannot\r\nhave victory, salute and bless martyrdom. The angels of Martyrdom and\r\nVictory are brothers, and both spread their wings above the cradle of\r\nyour future life.\" \"You may succeed or not,\" he wrote to a\r\nparliamentary candidate;[38] \"that is not the vital question. The\r\nquestion is to work manfully; to stand on the ground of a principle,\r\nwhilst almost everybody makes life a thing of tactics and\r\ncompromises.\"\r\n\r\nBut, when a man has listened to the call of God, and purged his soul\r\nof self, and given himself to duty,--sober, persistent, fearless\r\nduty,--his is the power that nothing else can give. For duty \"borrows\r\nfrom the Divine nature a spark of its omnipotence.\" Men will not die\r\nfor rights; they will for duty. They will not give up all that makes\r\nlife pleasant, brave toil and danger and opprobrium, for\r\nself-interest; they will do it for a principle. Only a sense of duty\r\nmakes a people fight through all a generation for a freedom, that only\r\ntheir children can enjoy. Therefore he, who would rouse men to noble\r\ndeeds, and lift them to sacrifice and heroism, whether it be in the\r\nsmall things of commonplace citizenship or in the fiery trial of a\r\nrevolution, must call them in the name of duty. Again he appealed to\r\nthe great example. \"Jesus sought not to save a dying world by\r\ncriticism. He did not speak of interests to men whom the worship of\r\ninterests had poisoned with selfishness. He asserted in God's holy\r\nname principles unknown before; and those few principles, which we,\r\neighteen centuries after, are still seeking to translate into facts,\r\nchanged the face of the world. One spark of faith accomplished what\r\nall the sophisms of philosophers had had no glimpse of,--a step\r\nforward in the education of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini probably never asked himself what was the ultimate sanction of\r\nhis code; and, if he had been pushed to it, it is not easy to surmise\r\nwhat answer he would have given. He could hardly have found the\r\nsanction in the positive commandment of the Deity, for he held that\r\nthe will of God was revealed only through humanity, and this transfers\r\nthe sanction to another ground. Nor, even had he been familiar with\r\nthem, would he have based the principle on evolutionary\r\narguments,--that altruism is necessary to the race, that that\r\ncommunity will survive, which contains the greatest number of\r\nself-sacrificing individuals. He would have assented to the facts, but\r\nhe would probably have said that no theory of heredity or race\r\nselection can explain the origin of altruism, which is a personal,\r\nconscious, self-generated sense, which therefore cannot come from any\r\n'natural,' unconscious source. Nor, again, would he have said, as a\r\nUtilitarian might say, that the life of duty is the highest form of\r\nhappiness, that there is a sense in which altruism and egoism are\r\nidentical, because he most tastes fruition, who loses himself in love\r\nand work for other men. There is a truth in this, that Mazzini\r\nneglected; he sometimes forgot that Christianity was an Evangel, good\r\ntidings of great joy,--that, so long as love and enthusiasm and the\r\nmartyr's passion possess a man, so far as he has attained to the\r\nglorious liberty of the children of God, the life of duty is the\r\nhighest happiness. But he knew only too well that gloom and depression\r\nwill come, that, when the light fails, duty becomes a stern\r\ntaskmaster, and that no principle of happiness (in any acceptation of\r\nthe word) will keep a man always faithful to his mission. And so he\r\nwould almost certainly have fallen back on the conscience, as the\r\nultimate moral sanction. \"Life,\" he says, \"is a march onwards to Self,\r\nthrough collective Perfecting to the progressive realisation of an\r\nIdeal.\" Whether he had called it 'self-realisation' or any less\r\nambiguous name, he would have come to the position that a man feels\r\nthat he owes it to himself to strive for the best he knows, to 'do his\r\nduty for duty's sake,' that he must justify his thoughts and actions\r\nto himself--his unsophisticated self,--that, if not, he will feel\r\nremorse and guilt. The practical value of any system of ethics depends\r\non whether it appeals to 'the sanction in the mind itself,' to\r\nfeelings familiar to the mass of would-be moral men. To such the\r\ndirect appeal to conscience has more weight than all the arguments of\r\ntheologians or utilitarians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his essay on _The Duties of Man_ and elsewhere Mazzini enumerates\r\nthe various spheres of duty. A man's duties begin with himself, not\r\nfrom any self-regarding motive, but because as is a man's own\r\nworthiness, so is his power to help his country or mankind. Never was\r\none more passionate for personal holiness. 'Be good, be good,' is the\r\nrecurring theme that runs through all his writings and political\r\naspirations. \"There is only one end, the _moral_ progress of man and\r\nhumanity.\" \"You must labour all your life,\" he wrote to a young\r\nItalian, \"to make your own self a temple to the Ideal, to God.\" \"To\r\ndraw near to God, purifying our conscience as a temple, sacrificing\r\nself for love,--this is our mission. To make ourselves better,--this\r\nis the order of the day, which must be the rule and consecration of\r\nour work.\" All his labours for his country had the supreme end in\r\nview, that Italian men and women should lead godly lives. \"Make\r\nyourselves better,\" he said to Italian working men in words, that show\r\nhow little of the demagogue there was in him, \"this must be the object\r\nof your life. Preach virtue, sacrifice, and love to the classes above\r\nyou; and be yourselves virtuous and prepared for sacrifice and love.\r\nYou must educate and perfect yourselves as well as educate and perfect\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nA man's next duties are to his family. Dear, very dear, to him was the\r\nlife of family, which he in his self-forgetfulness had put aside. \"The\r\nonly pure joys, unmixed with sadness, that it is given men to enjoy on\r\nearth, are the joys of Family.\" Outside it \"men may find brief joys\r\nand comforts, but not the supreme comfort, the calm as of a peaceful\r\nlake, the calm of trustful sleep, the child's sleep on its mother's\r\nbreast.\" The family is an eternal element of human life, more durable\r\neven than country; and the true man will make his family the centre of\r\nhis life, never wandering from it, never neglecting it. True love is\r\n\"tranquil, resigned, humble,\" as Dante's love for Beatrice. The wife\r\nwill be the equal of her husband, she who is \"the reflex for the\r\nindividual of the loving Providence that watches over humanity.\"\r\nMazzini repudiated any artificial assimilating of the sexes; but their\r\ndiffering functions were equally sacred and necessary. There must be\r\ntherefore no superiority of man over woman, no inequality, domestic or\r\npolitical. A man must make his wife his comrade, not only in his joys\r\nand sorrows, but in his thoughts and work. He must love his children\r\nwith \"a true, deep, severe love.\" \"Before Humanity and God children\r\nare the most awful responsibility that a human being can have.\" \"It\r\ndepends on us,\" so he quoted from Lamennais, \"whether our children\r\nturn out men or brutes.\"\r\n\r\nBut the family, that shuts itself within its own small circle, betrays\r\nits God-appointed function. It was made to be a school of service for\r\nhumanity, and teach men to be citizens. The _égoisme à deux_, that\r\nforgets country and mankind, the \"blind, nerveless, unreasoning love\r\nof children, that is selfishness in the parents and destruction for\r\nthem,\" betray the family's glorious prerogative. \"Few mothers or\r\nfathers, in this irreligious age of ours, and especially among the\r\nwell-to-do classes, understand the gravity and sacredness of their\r\neducational duties.\" Terrible to their country are the fruits of \"the\r\nselfishness taught by weak mothers and careless fathers, who let their\r\nchildren regard life not as a duty and mission, but as a search for\r\npleasure and a study of their own well-being.\" The true parent will\r\nteach his children not only to be good, but to be patriots, loving\r\ntheir country, honouring its great men; will teach them \"not hatred of\r\noppressors but an earnest looking forward to fight oppression,\" will\r\nmake them reverent to true authority, but rebels against false. There\r\nis danger, he says, in Goethe's maxim: 'do the duty that lies nearest\r\nthee.' As him, so it may lead others into a moral solitude, where the\r\ncry of humanity comes not. It is so easy in happy life of family, in\r\nabsorption in one's special work, to forget the duties of a citizen,\r\nto avoid the fret and stress, may-be the hardships and the danger, of\r\npolitics and social duty. But it is not enough for men to be \"kind\r\ntowards their friends, affectionate in their families, inoffensive\r\ntowards the rest of the world.\" The true man knows that he may not\r\ndecline responsibility for those, whom God has made his\r\nfellow-citizens. And higher still, higher than family or country,\r\nstands Humanity; and no man may do or sanction aught for either, which\r\nwill hurt the race. Ever before Mazzini stood the vision of the cross,\r\nChrist dying for all men, not from utilitarian calculation of the\r\ngreatest number, but because love embraces all.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[38] Mr Peter Taylor in the Newcastle election, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nThe State\r\n\r\n     The moral law and the state--Duties of the state: liberty,\r\n     association, education--Sovereignty is in\r\n     God--Democracy--The ideal government--The republic--The\r\n     ideal state.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn politics, as for the individual, the moral law, so Mazzini taught,\r\nmust reign supreme. \"The end of politics is to apply the moral law to\r\nthe civil organisation of a country.\" The state exists for the sake of\r\nmorality; its one and only final object is to help the moral growth of\r\nthe men and women within its borders, help it through all the\r\ncountless influences that society exercises on the individual.\r\nMorality is largely determined by environment; and the state must so\r\nfashion the environment, that the moral life may ever flourish more\r\nabundantly in it. \"You cannot found the brotherhood of Christ, where\r\nignorance and misery, servility and corruption on the one side and\r\nculture, riches, power on the other prevent any mutual esteem and\r\nlove. Men will not understand the virtue of sacrifice, where money is\r\nthe sole foundation of individual security and independence.\" How can\r\nthey train their children to true patriotism, when a debased\r\nconception of it rules, and all around them men and women are thinking\r\nof their private gain and pleasure? How train them to perfect honesty,\r\n\"when tyranny and espionage compel men to be false or silent on\r\ntwo-thirds of their opinions?\" How to despise money, \"where gold alone\r\nbuys honours, influence, respect, nay, is all that stands between them\r\nand the caprice and insults of their masters?\" \"Take a man, for\r\ninstance,\" he says, writing in the worst days of working-class\r\ndepression, \"who labours hard from fourteen to sixteen hours a day to\r\nobtain the bare necessities of existence; he eats his bacon and\r\npotatoes (when indeed he can get them) in a place which might rather\r\nbe called a den than a house; and then, worn out, lies down and\r\nsleeps; he is brutalised in a moral and physical point of view; he has\r\nnot ideas but propensities,--not beliefs but instincts; he does not\r\nread, he cannot read. How can you come at him, how kindle the divine\r\nspark that is torpid in his soul, how give the notion of life, of\r\nsacred life, to him, who knows it only by the material labour that\r\ncrushes him and by the wages that abase him? How will you give him\r\nmore time and more energy to develop his faculties except by lessening\r\nthe number of hours of labour and increasing his profits? How, above\r\nall, will you raise his fallen soul and give him the consciousness of\r\nhis duties and his rights, except by his initiation into\r\ncitizenship--in other words, the suffrage?\" Some day it will be\r\notherwise. \"When there is family life and property, education and\r\npolitical function for all, when through them men have closer\r\ncommunion with one another, then family and property and country and\r\nhumanity will become more sacred to them all. When Christ's arms,\r\nstill stretched upon the martyr's cross, are freed to clasp humanity\r\nin one embrace, when earth has no more brahmins and pariahs, masters\r\nand servants, but only _men_, then shall we worship with far other\r\nfaith and other love God's holy name.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, in the main, three ways, by which the state can foster the\r\nmoral life of the citizens. First of all it must secure liberty; not\r\nthat liberty is an end in itself, but because it is the necessary\r\ncondition of morality. There can be no morality without\r\nresponsibility, no responsibility without liberty to choose between\r\ngood and evil, between social service and self-interest. Liberty is\r\nnecessary to true progress, for a progress that is imposed from above\r\nand not freely accepted by the people,--the whole programme of\r\npaternal despotism,--works no change in character, and therefore is \"a\r\nsoulless form,\" which cannot live. Only the freeman, who owns no lord\r\nbut God, can attain to his full spiritual stature. \"Where liberty is\r\nnot, life is reduced to a simple organic function. The man, who allows\r\nhis liberty to be violated, betrays his own nature, and rebels against\r\nGod's decrees.\" Thus there are certain fundamental liberties, which\r\nnot even a democracy may legitimately infringe. \"No majority, no force\r\nof the community may take from you what makes you men.\" These\r\nliberties include, save in rare exceptions, \"all that is indispensable\r\nto feed life morally and materially,\"--personal liberty, religious\r\nliberty, unqualified liberty of speech and press, liberty of\r\nassociation, liberty of trade,--all of them liberties, without which\r\nmen cannot choose their sphere of duty, without which society is\r\ndestined to waste or stagnation.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Mazzini omits not only liberty of immoral\r\naction, however 'self-regarding,' but any liberty that has an\r\nanti-social tendency. He did not admit, for instance, any absolute\r\nright of property, and, as we shall see, limited the right of bequest,\r\nand advocated severe taxation to check great inequalities of fortune.\r\nTheoretically he believed that government should possess very wide\r\npowers. But on the whole, when we come to the details of his social\r\nprogramme,[39] his position is the Liberal one; and (always excepting\r\neducation) he stood against any great extension of state interference.\r\nIt was not from any love of individualism and free competition; he\r\nhated them as anarchical,--fatal to spiritual unity and true\r\ncitizenship, fatal to the welfare of the masses. But he wished the\r\nhigher order to evolve, not from compulsion, which left the moral\r\nsense untouched, not by the force of the majority or of a despotism,\r\nbut through a moral growth, which carried the community willingly and\r\nconsciously towards a better state. The liberty to do good would\r\nbecome through education the liberty of doing good. This meant, as we\r\nshall see, that he allowed no liberty in education, for moral\r\neducation must be uniform and therefore removed from individual\r\nchoice. But this encroachment on liberty once made for the sake of a\r\ncommon morality, for the sake of that same morality he desired liberty\r\nin most other spheres of civil life.\r\n\r\nBut liberty is not enough. By itself, it is a mirage for the masses of\r\nmankind. \"What is liberty of trade for the man without capital or\r\ncredit? What are free opportunities of education for him who has no\r\ntime for study?\" Only Association can make liberty a reality for the\r\nmasses, or allow new elements of progress to assert themselves, or\r\nsave the waste that comes of isolated or conflicting labours. Nay\r\nmore, association gives the sense of brotherhood, the spiritual\r\nstrength, that comes from sharing others' work, from merging\r\nindividual action in a bigger cause. \"Association multiplies your\r\nstrength a hundred fold; it makes the ideas and progress of other men\r\nyour own; it raises, betters, hallows your nature with the affections\r\nof the human family and its growing sense of unity.\" As Progress is\r\nthe great intellectual discovery of the modern world, so Association\r\nis its new-found instrument. Thus association must be dear to the\r\nstate as individual liberty; and provided that any particular\r\nassociation is peaceful and public, and respects elementary liberties,\r\nand has no immoral end in view, the state must allow it perfect\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThus the second duty of the state is to encourage association and\r\nharmonise it with liberty; to give society the originating power of\r\nthe latter, the effective strength of the former. Both are \"equally\r\nnecessary to the end, which is progress,\" both \"essential to the\r\norderly development of society.\" On any sound theory, the two\r\nprinciples postulate one another. There can be no association except\r\namong free men, since true association implies a conscious recognition\r\nand acceptance of the object. Liberty is meaningless without\r\nassociation, because the individual, for all his freedom, is powerless\r\nunless he combine with others. Mazzini carefully dissociated himself\r\nalike from the _laissez-faire_ school and a despotic state socialism.\r\nThe state must encourage combination, but may do nothing to compel it.\r\nThe members of an association must be unfettered as to its nature and\r\nobject and methods (always provided that they are legitimate), must\r\nbe free to take up or resign their membership. \"Sacred to us is the\r\nindividual; sacred is society. We do not mean to destroy the former\r\nfor the latter and found a collective tyranny; nor do we mean to admit\r\nthe rights of the individual independently of society, and consign\r\nourselves to perpetual anarchy. We want to balance the operations of\r\nliberty and association in a noble harmony.\" \"The republican formula\r\nis 'everything in liberty through association.'\"\r\n\r\nMazzini did not seriously concern himself with the abstract relations\r\nof the individual and society; probably it seemed to him a meaningless\r\ndispute. His theory admitted no real antagonism between them. A man's\r\ntrue individuality lies not in self-assertion but in the recognition\r\nof his duty to his fellows. This recognition necessarily makes\r\nfriction impossible between himself and them, and reconciles the\r\nindividual and society, liberty and association, in a common national\r\naim. Liberty then becomes the higher liberty, not the mere power of\r\nrefusing evil, but \"the power of choosing between the different ways\r\nthat lead to good.\" Association becomes the economical direction of\r\nthe country's forces to a known and common end. It is the function of\r\nthe state,--a function it alone can execute,--to instil the sense of\r\nduty into all its members and make that sense of duty work towards a\r\ncommon ideal. This it must do through national education, and\r\neducation thus becomes the state's third and weightiest task. In\r\nMazzini's conception education goes far beyond the imparting of\r\nknowledge or even the drawing out of character. It is the inspiration\r\nof a national faith, the moulding of the soul to great principles of\r\nlife and duty. It is, next to religion from which it derives, the\r\ngreat binding and harmonising element in a nation, merging individual\r\nwills in a common consensus, destroying party friction and class\r\nstruggle and sectarian faction, and sweeping a united country onward\r\nto the fulfilment of its destinies. If it had been objected that the\r\nresult would be destructive of independence and originality of\r\nthought, he would probably have answered that the same spirit does not\r\nprevent diversities of operations, and that true originality is better\r\npromoted by discipline than by license. Certainly, as his theory of\r\ngenius shows, he set a very high value on originality. Let thought, he\r\nwould have said, be free and wide as air, but without community of aim\r\nit wastes itself, and the state must prevent that waste. Thus there is\r\nno true country without a national education, compulsory and free.\r\nVoluntary education has its necessity under a political or spiritual\r\ndespotism, but it leads to moral anarchy, and religious democracy\r\ncannot tolerate false teaching of its children. The country must have\r\n\"the moral direction of the young.\" \"It is ridiculous to allow every\r\ncitizen the right to teach his own programme, and refuse the nation\r\nthe right to transmit its.\" Once, when discussing the matter with a\r\nfriend, the question was put to him, \"If two states had arrived at an\r\nequal stage of education, the one by national and the other by\r\nvoluntary schools, which would be the finer nation?\" \"But, my dear,\"\r\nhe answered, \"that is to be an atheist.\" The national education must\r\ntherefore express the national faith and aim, and give \"the moral\r\nunity, which is far more important than material unity.\" It is not at\r\nall clear how he proposed to ascertain this national faith. For\r\nEngland, he had a curious proposal; \"you ought,\" he said to Jowett,\r\n\"to ascertain the mind of the people by making enquiries of the\r\nclergy and others what they believed, and when you have ascertained\r\nthe national mind, you should express it in education.\" In the future\r\nItaly he sometimes thought that it would be embodied in a national\r\ndeclaration of principles, drafted by a Constituent Assembly. But more\r\ngenerally he seems to have distrusted the capacity of the democracy to\r\nvoice the full faith, and he probably reserved it to the spiritual\r\npower under the new religion to enunciate its articles.\r\n\r\nAt all events national education implied above all else moral\r\neducation, the moral education which is as \"a holy communion with all\r\nour brothers, with all the generations that lived, and therefore\r\nthought and wrought before us.\"[40] This, he laments, \"is anarchy\r\nnow.\" If it is left to the parents, it is often neglected or bad; if\r\nto the teachers, clerical or lay, it too frequently instils either\r\nsuperstition or materialism, or at all events it has no uniformity.\r\nMazzini intended to write a book on education; if he had done so, we\r\nshould know more of the agencies, through which he proposed to give\r\nmoral teaching. Bakounine once asked him, what, if he had got his\r\nrepublic, he would do to make the people really free. Mazzini replied,\r\n\"Establish schools, in which the duties of man, sacrifice, and\r\ndevotion would be taught.\" He had a skeleton programme as a basis of\r\ncitizen training,--\"a course of nationality, including a summary\r\npicture of the progress of humanity, national history, and a popular\r\nstatement of the principles which rule the country's legislation\";\r\nbut one cannot think that this gave all he wanted. He probably counted\r\nmore on the universities, and especially on the courses of philosophy;\r\nand this no doubt explains his strong dislike of professors, whose\r\nteaching seemed to smack of materialism, his indictment of the\r\neclecticism, which allowed different schools to be represented in the\r\nchairs. He had a particular animus against German professors and\r\nGerman philosophy. He blamed the appointment of Germans at Oxford; he\r\nwas very angry that Hegel was taught at the university of Naples. \"One\r\nfine day,\" he wrote, \"we will sweep out all that stuff.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat form of government was best calculated to attain these ends,--to\r\ngive full play to liberty, to harmonise it with association, to supply\r\na true national education? No form, Mazzini replied, is right _per\r\nse_. He held to the full, though probably not recognising it, the\r\nscholastic doctrine of government by grace. \"Sovereignty is not in I\r\nnor we but God.\" \"There is no sovereignty of right in any one;\r\nsovereignty is in the aim.\" A government was legitimate in proportion\r\nas it stood for righteousness. \"There is no sovereignty in the\r\nindividual or society, except in so far as either conforms itself to\r\nthe divine plan and law. An individual is either the best interpreter\r\nof God's law and governs in his name, or he is a usurper to be\r\noverthrown. The simple vote of a majority does not constitute\r\nsovereignty, if it evidently contradicts the supreme moral precepts or\r\ndeliberately shuts the road to progress.\" \"The will of the people is\r\nsacred, when it interprets and applies the moral law; null and\r\nimpotent, when it dissociates itself from the law, and only represents\r\ncaprice.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory is of course, as in the days of the schoolmen, a tremendous\r\ninstrument for reform. No institution, no branch of legislature, no\r\nchurch, no prerogative or prescriptive claim has any rights against\r\nthe Right. Do they or not make for the country's good? By the answer\r\nthey must stand or fall. The theory is supremely true, and on occasion\r\nof highest social value. Its dangers lie in the possibility of\r\nmistaken application, and in its tendency to regard the form rather\r\nthan the spirit of an institution,--a danger especially present to\r\nminds like Mazzini's, which are deficient in powers of accurate\r\nanalysis. An institution, so runs their reasoning, has failed;\r\ntherefore it is wrong; therefore it must be swept away. Reform is\r\nimpossible; therefore let there be root-and-branch revolution. It is\r\nstrange that Mazzini, with his admiration of English habits and\r\ndislike of French, did not see how here his logic approximated to the\r\nlatter. He did not see how plastic institutions are, how it is often\r\nbetter to save the great expenditure of force, that must go to destroy\r\na rooted institution, how it is sometimes easier to change the spirit\r\nthan the form. In this his political wisdom went astray, and his long\r\nprofitless crusade against the monarchy is a melancholy illustration\r\nof the error.\r\n\r\nThus, then, there is no essential sovereignty in any form of\r\ngovernment. But democracy is the form most likely to interpret God's\r\nlaw aright. We must \"reverence the people,\" not because they are the\r\nmajority, \"but because they concentrate in themselves all the\r\nfaculties of human nature distributed among the several\r\nindividuals,--faculties of religion and politics, industry and art.\"\r\nIn other words, the collective wisdom of the many is likely to excel\r\nthe wisdom of the few; a democratic state can use the special\r\nknowledge of every citizen, and choose the most capable for its\r\nadministrators; and its judgment is likely to be more four-sided and\r\nbetter informed than that of a state with restricted citizenship. And\r\njust as Humanity is the interpreter of God's law, so a people often\r\nhas an inspiration that seldom comes to individuals, glimpses of the\r\ntruth that are granted to the multitude in moments of enthusiasm, an\r\ninstinct that impels it to give power to its best men. He even,\r\ninconsistently with his general position, justifies democracy on _à\r\npriori_ grounds; it is \"a potent, undeniable, European fact,\" and\r\ntherefore must be a part of God's providential design.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible not to feel that all through Mazzini's thought\r\nthere runs a certain uneasiness about democracy. He accepted it as an\r\ninevitable fact; he recognised that at all events it was superior to\r\nany government based on privilege; it fitted in with his theory of\r\nHumanity and his own passionate sympathies. But he had an intermittent\r\ndread that democracy, like theocracy and monarchy, might forget the\r\nlaw of God. He feared that the French Revolution had started it on the\r\nwrong road; he had had his disappointments in Italy; in later life he\r\nfelt the peril that materialist socialism might deflect it from\r\nspiritual ends. He advocated universal suffrage, not because of any\r\nabsolute virtue in it, but as \"the starting-point of political\r\neducation,\" and he gravely feared that, till national education had\r\ncreated a national consensus, it might easily become a tyranny of the\r\nmajority. He preferred a system of indirect election. Towards the end\r\nof his life he was a keen advocate of women's suffrage, but he was\r\nanxious that the agitation for it should be equally an agitation for\r\ntheir own moral growth, a crusade against \"their perennial vanity,\r\ntheir worship of ridiculous fashions, their lightness of parties and\r\nconversation,\" their husband-hunting. And this mistrust made him turn\r\nto a strong authority, elected and deposable by the people, but with\r\nvery extended powers, and charged not only to execute the popular\r\nmandate, but go in advance of it. \"The supreme power in a state must\r\nnot drag behind the stage of civilisation that informs it; it must\r\nrather take the lead in carrying it higher, and, by anticipating the\r\nsocial thought, bring the country up to its own level.\" It is for\r\nrepublics to make republicans, not republicans republics. He earnestly\r\nrepudiated the Whig-American theory of government. Anxiously as he\r\nguarded personal and religious and commercial liberty, he wished to\r\nsee the functions of government, at all events in education and as a\r\nstimulating and suggestive influence, as wide and not as narrow as\r\npossible. Distrust of government in itself, the whole system of checks\r\nand balances, he condemned as weakening the power of the state to\r\npromote progress. It is extremely difficult to disentangle with\r\nprecision what was his ideal constitution, and it may be doubted\r\nwhether he had worked it out himself. Though he probably had no very\r\nstrong liking for parliamentary government, he seems to have accepted\r\nit, and to have wished to give it large executive powers. But above\r\nit, and apparently distinct from the executive, was to be the real\r\n\"government,\" the spiritual authority, whose duty it would be to\r\n\"point to the national ideal,\" while parliament and the executive\r\n\"directed the forces of the country\" in the road it indicated. But\r\nthere must be no suspicion of dictatorship, and perfect trust and\r\nmutual inspiration must unite the spiritual and temporal\r\nauthorities.[41]\r\n\r\nAt all events the ideal government, whatever its precise form, could,\r\nhe believed, exist only under a republic. The story of his life has\r\nshown how passionately he clung to his republican faith; how for it he\r\ngave or wasted his best days, how his untamable desire for it tangled\r\nhis work for Italian Unity. His condemnation of monarchy was partly a\r\ntheoretical one. The republic was \"the most logical form of\r\ndemocracy,\" the only corollary of liberty and equality; monarchy was\r\nfounded on inequality, its dynastic interests were not the nation's,\r\nand therefore it could never give a country moral unity. Whether\r\nabsolutist or constitutional, it was a sham, because in modern life it\r\ncorresponded to no real belief, no essential principle; and because it\r\nwas a sham, it was the fruitful parent of dishonesty. Quite late in\r\nlife he somewhat changed his point of attack, and condemned it as\r\npossessing no vitality to lead, and therefore impotent to found a\r\nstrong government. But his indictment, at least in his early years,\r\nwas drawn mainly from the actual evidence of corruption and misrule in\r\nthe monarchies of the first half of the century. It may well have\r\nseemed impossible then to reconcile monarchy with any national\r\nwell-being. He made little or no exception for constitutional\r\nmonarchies. Louis Philippe's rule was small argument for the\r\nprinciple; and as late as 1862 he condemned constitutional monarchy as\r\n\"incompatible with progress,\" everywhere outside England. For England,\r\nin later years, he made an exception; and his judgment here shows that\r\nhe could view the issue more serenely, when he escaped from his\r\nprejudices. \"The struggle, which occupies English life,\" he said in\r\n1870, \"is not between the nation and the monarchy, but between the\r\npeople and the aristocracy, the latter being the one element of the\r\npast, that retains and communicates its vitality.\" In Italy the facts\r\nwere after 1848 much the same as in England; but here he was blinded\r\nby party feeling, and he could never see that what was the real issue\r\nin the thirties had gone into the background. His fallacy was a\r\nnominalist one. In his early days there had been a vital difference\r\nbetween monarchy and republic. Afterwards the classification became\r\nunreal; and the true differentiation lay in various species of\r\nparliamentary government, in various relations between parliament and\r\nthe executive. In his own Italy to-day the republic becomes\r\nincreasingly a factitious and academic issue, as more vital questions\r\nmake the true dividing lines in politics.\r\n\r\nHowever mistaken his distinction between republic and monarchy, the\r\nrepublic, as he conceived it, was no mere form of government. \"God is\r\nmy witness,\" he said, \"that I pay no tribute to forms.\" He had little\r\nliking for the republic in the United States, with its weak bond of\r\nunion, and its system of checks and balances. He refused his blessing\r\nto the Third Republic in France. \"By the Republic,\" he told the Roman\r\nAssembly in 1849, \"we do not mean a mere form of government, a name,\r\na system imposed by a victorious party on its rivals. We mean a\r\nprinciple, a new step forward in education taken by the people, a\r\nprogramme of education to be carried out, a political institution\r\ncalculated to produce a moral advance; we mean the system which must\r\ndevelop liberty, equality, association;--liberty, and consequently\r\nevery peaceful development of ideas, even when they differ in part\r\nfrom our own;--equality, and therefore we cannot allow political\r\ncastes to be substituted for the old castes that have passed away;\r\nassociation, that is a complete consensus of all the vital forces of\r\nthe nation, a complete consensus, so far as is possible, of the entire\r\npeople.\" For him the republic meant absolute trust between people and\r\ngovernment, choice of the most capable and best for office, a\r\nveritable national unity, that destroyed party friction and impelled\r\nthe undivided forces of the country to social legislation. The\r\nrepublic, and it alone, will be the ideal state, God's kingdom\r\nrealised on earth, \"where institutions tend primarily to the bettering\r\nof the most numerous and poorest class, where the principle of\r\nassociation is best developed, where the road of progress has no end,\r\nas education gradually develops and all elements that make for\r\nstagnation and immobility disappear, where, in fine, the whole\r\ncommunity, strong, tranquil, happy, peaceful, bound in a solemn\r\nconcord, stands on earth as in a temple built to virtue and liberty,\r\nto progressive civilisation, to the laws that govern the moral world.\"\r\nThere, in the people \"that knows no caste or privilege, save of genius\r\nand virtue, no proletariat or aristocracy of land or finance,\" in the\r\npeople \"united by the brotherhood of one sole faith, one sole\r\ntradition, one sole thought of love,\" the people that worships\r\nprinciples more than men, that cherishes its past but looks ever\r\nforward to its future, resolute to unlock its destinies,--there stands\r\nthe city of God, \"the similitude of that divine society, where all are\r\nequal, and there is one love, one happiness for all.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] See below, pp. 292-294.\r\n\r\n[40] In the letter referred to on p. 246 note, he calls it \"religious\r\neducation,\" but it is clear that he did not intend the expression in\r\nits usual sense.\r\n\r\n[41] Mazzini's views are perhaps most clearly stated in his speech to\r\nthe Roman Assembly of March 9, 1849 (before he became Triumvir). See\r\nalso _Scritti editi e inediti_, XVI. 14. In the second and perhaps the\r\nfirst of these passages _popolo_ seems used as equivalent to\r\nparliament. In the second, _governo_ is obviously not the executive.\r\nSee also above, p. 247.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nSocial Theories\r\n\r\n     Importance of social questions--Their moral basis--Attack on\r\n     socialism--Contrast between Mazzini's and its theories and\r\n     work--Social programme--Cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMazzini's faith in the republic came largely of his conviction that it\r\nwas the only effective instrument for social legislation. He was\r\nsometimes charged with neglecting social for political reform, with\r\npreaching, as Bakounine put it, a \"detestable bourgeois patriotism.\"\r\nThe charge was true for no time of his life, least for his later\r\nyears. To him the social question was \"the most sacred\" as it was \"the\r\nmost hazardous\" problem of the age. He was one of the first to insist\r\nthat the rise of the working classes was the great social phenomenon\r\nof the century. Political reform, so he told the Carbonari and the\r\nChartists, had its only sufficiency and justification, when it was the\r\ninstrument of social reform. This did not quite represent his thought,\r\nfor he was insistent that questions of political liberty and justice\r\nintimately touched man's moral development; but he held with equal\r\nearnestness that the social question had its independent and undying\r\nimportance. \"There is no such thing,\" he wrote, \"as a purely political\r\nor purely social revolution; every true revolution has its political\r\nand social character alike.\"\r\n\r\nAll his passionate sympathy went out to the disinherited. Compassion,\r\nsays one who knew him, shone in his face and vibrated in his voice,\r\nwhen he spoke of the masses and their hardships. He felt intensely for\r\na lot, which in the '40s and '50s he believed was growing steadily\r\nworse. Indignantly he spoke of the workman's \"poverty-stricken,\r\ncribbed, precarious life, closing in infirm and squalid and unassisted\r\nold age.\" \"The workman has no freedom of contract,\" he replied to the\r\nold economists, \"he is a slave; he has no alternative but hunger or\r\nthe pay, however small it be, that his employer offers him. And his\r\npay is a _wage_; a wage often insufficient for his daily needs, almost\r\nalways unequal to the value of his work. His hands can multiply the\r\nemployer's capital three fold, four fold, but not so his own pay.\r\nHence his incapacity to save; hence the unrelieved, irreparable misery\r\nof commercial crises.\" And even without crises, \"his life is poisoned\r\nby a sense of uncertainty and constant dread; and old age,--brought on\r\nprematurely by heavy and often unhealthy work,--awaits him,\r\nthreatening, implacable.\" His \"destiny is that of accursed races,--to\r\nlive and suffer, curse and die.\" \"A life of poverty and a death-bed in\r\na hospital,--that is what society in this nineteenth century provides\r\nfor two-thirds of its members in almost every country, eighteen\r\nhundred years and more since a Holy One, that men hail as divine,\r\nproclaimed that all are equals and brothers and sons of God.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was no pessimist, at all events in later years, when he knew\r\nthe workman better, and saw that, in spite of all, he was advancing\r\nand gave promise of infinite further advance. The day of deliverance\r\nwas near. The workman's emancipation was inevitable, written in the\r\ndecrees of Providence. The labour question was the acknowledged\r\nproblem of the time, its solution \"the social faith of all men now who\r\nlove and know.\" \"The upward movement of the artisan classes in our\r\ntowns,\" he wrote towards the end of life, \"dates back now for more\r\nthan a century; slow but tenacious in its progress, advancing from\r\ndecade to decade by a law of increasing momentum, and in these last\r\ntwenty years growing, visibly for all, in intensity and expansion, and\r\nacquiring, as it goes, real power and self-consciousness.\" It all was\r\n\"leading up to a great revolution, an impulse given by Providence,\r\nnevermore to recede, till it has reached its end.\" And he gloried in\r\nit. Whatever fears he may have had for the working of democracy, he\r\nhad none for the labour movement. The rise of the working classes was\r\n\"as a flowing tide, that the divine breath has stirred\"; and he\r\nwatched it \"not with fear, but with the loving reverence, with which\r\none watches a great providential fact.\"\r\n\r\nBut just because his faith and love were great, he was not afraid to\r\npoint \"the men of labour\" to the heights. It was his familiar precept\r\nof the moral aim. \"Material improvements,\" he told them, \"are\r\nessential, and we will fight to win them; not because men have no\r\nother interest than to be well housed and clothed, but because your\r\nmoral development is stopped, while you are, as you are to-day,\r\nengaged in a continual fight with poverty.\" So too in his rather\r\nscanty references to political economy, he insists that its teaching\r\nmust always have reference to a moral ideal. Economics must be \"the\r\nexpression not of the human appetite but of man's industrial mission.\"\r\nOtherwise, they \"substitute the problem of humanity's kitchen for the\r\nproblem of humanity,\" and teach selfishness for individuals and\r\nclasses and industrial warfare. It was not only that economic progress\r\nmust aim consistently at personal morality, at making better husbands,\r\nfathers, neighbours, that it must be pure of any spirit of bitterness\r\nor revenge or aught that sins against the brotherhood of man. Besides\r\nall this, it must not be allowed to maim the working man's powers and\r\nduties as a citizen, must never be purchased by the sacrifice of\r\npolitical liberty or manliness. He pointed for his moral to France in\r\n1849 and 1850, when the French artisans sold their political rights to\r\nLouis Napoleon for the promise of a labour policy. 'Bread and\r\namusements,' he reminded them, were ever the offer of despots. Outside\r\nliberty and strenuous political interest there was no salvation,\r\neconomic or other. The true man will think not only of his class but\r\nof his country, and not of his own country only, but of the sufferings\r\nand rights of men the whole world over. If the working classes forgot\r\ntheir political duties, thought lightly of political reform, connived\r\nat an unjust foreign policy, they sacrificed one of their nature's\r\nnoblest functions, and built their own economic progress on the sand.\r\nAnd he believed that, France notwithstanding, the people always knew\r\nthis in their hearts. The Chartists, he pointed out, with their bare,\r\nimperfect political programme, had more followers than all the French\r\nSocialists. \"The last of those you call political agitators,\" he told\r\nthe latter, \"will always have more influence with the people than all\r\nyour utopias; because at the root of every political question the\r\npeople has at least a glimpse of something that appeals to its soul,\r\nsomething that gives it self-consciousness and raises its trampled\r\ndignity.\" \"The working men of Italy fought like heroes at Milan and\r\nBrescia, in Sicily and at Rome, not for a rise of wages, but for the\r\nhonour of the Italian name, for the free life of their nation. The\r\nworking men of Paris fought and won in 1848, not because of a\r\nfinancial crisis or their own poverty, but because the monarchy\r\ndragged France's glory and duty in the mud, because it refused French\r\ncitizens a free press, and free right of meeting and association.\"\r\n\r\nIt was from this standpoint that he attacked Socialism. We need not\r\nconcern ourselves with his strictures on the expired schools of the\r\nearly French Socialists, or with his very crude criticism of Louis\r\nBlanc,--criticism, which he would hardly have made in later life, and\r\nwhich is certainly inconsistent with his own social schemes. We can\r\nneglect, too, much of his attack on the economic side of collectivism,\r\nwhich he never really understood. It is more to the point to assume a\r\ngreater knowledge of modern Socialism than he possessed, and see what\r\nis his essential relationship to it. He had not a few ideas in common\r\nwith the Marxite school. His own industrial ideal contained, though he\r\nknew it not, the germs of the socialist community. He looked as\r\nearnestly and confidently as they do to the death of capitalism, and\r\nbuilt his hopes on the development of association; he recognised with\r\nthem the inevitable historic evolution of the workers, and that it is\r\nthe march of the humble, unknown multitude, and not the hero, which\r\ndetermines the world's progress; he hailed the time, when classes\r\nwould be no more, and all be equals in rights and opportunities, and\r\nhe believed that this equality could never be reached under a\r\ncapitalist system.\r\n\r\nBut in root principles he differed from the strict Marxites almost as\r\nessentially as he himself supposed. While with him moral and spiritual\r\nphenomena are the fundamental facts, Marx builds his system on\r\nmaterial phenomena. For the collectivist, man is chiefly the product\r\nof his economic surroundings; for Mazzini, the social and industrial\r\nenvironment is only \"the manifestation of the moral and intellectual\r\ncondition of humanity at a given period, and above all of its faith.\"\r\nFor the one, history is the sequence of economic cause and effect, and\r\nthe growth of mind and morals is the secondary consequence of economic\r\nfacts; with the other, the economic facts, though not neglected, are\r\nsubordinated, religion is the master principle of human progress, and\r\nreligious systems are the milestones that mark the road. The two\r\nschools are absolutely antagonistic in their conception of the ideal.\r\nMarx and his followers would discover it by the right interpretation\r\nof the drift of facts; if indeed we can call it an ideal, what is\r\naccepted merely as a necessary tendency, and when right and wrong are\r\njudged by the fact, not the fact by right and wrong. Mazzini\r\nunderstood to the full the value of facts as conditioning the ideal,\r\nas pointing out how far it was attainable at the moment, nay, as in\r\nsome degree indicating the ideal itself. But to him right and wrong\r\nhad no dependance on the existing fact; facts tended to approximate to\r\nthe ideal, because the ideal was sovereign, and Providence guided them\r\ntowards it; and it was man's free privilege and bounden duty to help\r\nthe work of Providence, and be lord of facts. Mazzini did not kick\r\nagainst the pricks of economic evolution; he took modern\r\nindustrialism as it is, and never wished to thwart the natural\r\ntendencies of industrial discovery. But he claimed that man has power\r\nto turn them to good or evil,--a good or evil that has reference not\r\nto them but to a moral end.\r\n\r\nHence their teaching has differed widely in its practical\r\nconsequences. Marx deduced from his economic studies a confident and\r\ndetailed prophecy of economic development. It was a faith, whose\r\nassurance and optimism gives it a mighty power to sway men, so long as\r\nfaith stays unquestioned. But economic dogmas, especially of the\r\nprophetic kind, are apt to be shaken by the rough wind of facts; and\r\nit has been the fate of Marx' system to be line by line explained away\r\nby its commentators. If it still retains its influence,--and, indeed,\r\nit is a potent influence,--it is because it has quieted scepticism by\r\nshedding much of its founder's doctrine, and because it finds and has\r\nmore or less always found expression in a political programme, such as\r\nMazzini preached, aiming at high ends of liberty and justice. Mazzini,\r\nso confident often in his religious and political horoscopes, here\r\nchose a humbler part. He insisted indeed on one broad economic\r\nprinciple,--association, and he pointed to certain reforms of\r\nimmediate practicability. But he resolutely refused to forecast the\r\neconomic future. Humanity, he would repeat, goes on its own way, and\r\nlaughs at the man, who finds \"the secret of the world under his\r\npillow.\" \"I think,\" he wrote, \"that our problem is not so much to\r\ndefine the forms of future progress, as to place the individual under\r\nsuch conditions as make it easy for him to understand and fulfil it.\"\r\nHe created no great party of the proletariat; it was his as useful\r\nfunction to fertilise the moral soil, to inspire all classes with a\r\ndeeper sense of social obligation, and thus to ease the road for\r\nsocial progress, whatever particular shape the circumstances of the\r\ntime might counsel it to take.\r\n\r\nThe two men differ again radically in their influence on class\r\nrelations. To Mazzini 'the struggle of classes,' however peaceful and\r\nlegal in its form, would have been a hateful idea. It is true he\r\nsternly rebuked the short-sighted folly of the richer classes, and he\r\nwould find excuses for wild acts or theories of proletariat protest.\r\nBut he set his face resolutely against class hatred, against dreams of\r\nviolence and revenge, against social revolutions which worked hardship\r\nto the individual. Hopeless as he was of enlisting the upper classes,\r\nat least in Italy, on the side of social reform, he set his hopes on\r\nthe middle classes; and from the days of the _Apostolato Popolare_\r\ndown to the last years of life, he preached insistently that middle\r\nand working classes must stand together in the social movement. The\r\nwhole theory of Duty looked to the harmonising of motives, not to the\r\nbrute struggle of opposing social forces. The collectivist takes the\r\nsocial discord for granted, and bids the workers trust to themselves\r\nalone and win their ends by force, however much force may be disguised\r\nbehind the vote. Each principle has its time; the socialist mistake\r\nhas been to elevate to a principle, what is the sad necessity of an\r\nuninspired age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt remains to examine Mazzini's own programme of social\r\nreconstruction. He lays down certain economic axioms. First, private\r\nproperty must remain, however much the State should try to equalise\r\nfortunes through taxation. Mazzini endorses the familiar argument from\r\nexpediency,--the necessity of property to stimulate labour and\r\nencourage invention. But his apology for it is in the main an _à\r\npriori_ one. \"Property,\" he says, \"when it is the result of labour,\r\nrepresents the activity of the body, as thought represents the\r\nactivity of the soul; it is the visible sign of our part in the\r\ntransformation of the material world, as our ideas and our rights to\r\nliberty and inviolability of conscience are the signs of our part in\r\nthe transformation of the moral world. The man who works and produces\r\nhas a right to the fruits of his own labour; in this resides the right\r\nof property.\"[42] There is a flavour of Ricardo and Marx in this, and\r\nit is easy to see a socialist application, unintended by the writer.\r\nNext, the new social organisation must not be the work of compulsion.\r\nHe saw that voluntary working-class organisation was an essential\r\npreliminary to any lasting social advance; and, as we shall see, his\r\nown schemes pivot on voluntary societies for cooperative production.\r\nAnd lastly, schemes of economic change must always aim at increasing\r\nproductiveness. He knew that there could be no serious improvement in\r\nthe workman's condition, unless the national production were\r\nincreased; and he seems to have dimly realised that the two things\r\nmust mutually react, any rise in the workman's income increasing the\r\ndemand for commodities and thereby stimulating production, and this\r\nincrease of production in its turn encouraging a further increase of\r\nthe workman's pay.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the particulars of his economic programme, we find\r\nfertility and boldness of suggestion, but small attempt to work out\r\nthe details. He was constitutionally unfitted to be an economist; he\r\nlacked the necessary precision of thought and accuracy of analysis. He\r\nrather despised economic study, at all events when it came from books.\r\nA real knowledge of the economic question is to be found, he says, \"in\r\nthe workshops and the homes of the artisans,\" rather than in\r\n\"statistics and documents, which are sometimes erroneous, always\r\nincomplete, compiled as they are either by officials, whose tendency\r\nis to conceal the evil, or by private individuals, whose tendency is\r\nto exaggerate it.\" He trusted to a knowledge of the workman's thoughts\r\nand aspirations, gleaned from close and affectionate intercourse, more\r\nthan to any inquiry into the outside facts of his life.\r\n\r\nHis suggestions were many. Among the more commonplace were free trade\r\nin land, legislation to protect tenants, arbitration between capital\r\nand labour, national insurance (apparently to be compulsory), the\r\nregulation by the state of \"that den of robbers,\" the Stock Exchange.\r\nAt one time he wished the state to guarantee work for everybody, but\r\nas he does not mention the proposal later than 1849, it may be assumed\r\nthat he relinquished it. For Italy, he suggested a great scheme of\r\nhome colonisation on her unreclaimed lands; and it is a curious\r\ninstance of his want of accurate enquiry, that in his advocacy of it\r\nhe took no account of the all-important factor of malaria. It is\r\ncurious, too, that, like many Italians at the opposite pole of\r\nthought, he disliked emigration, and would gladly have checked what\r\nhas proved to be one of the chief sources of Italian development. All\r\nthese, however, were minor suggestions. His programme rested mainly on\r\ntwo proposals,--a radical reform of taxation, and the gradual\r\nsupersession of capitalism by voluntary cooperative societies of\r\nworkmen. His canons of taxation are shortly stated and may be shortly\r\nsummarised. Economy in collection, free trade, no taxes on food, the\r\nsmallest possible incidence on industry were his fiscal maxims; and he\r\nwished to carry them out by abolishing all indirect taxation and,\r\napparently too, all special taxes on land, and substituting a single\r\ntax on income, to be graduated and, it would seem, severely graduated.\r\nHe also proposed that in all cases of persons dying without heirs\r\nwithin the fourth degree, estates should lapse to the state.\r\n\r\nHe looked for more radical change to his scheme of cooperative\r\nproduction, a scheme which appears in its main outlines as early as\r\n1833, but which he worked out in more detail in the last ten years of\r\nhis life. It was a special application of the same principle of\r\nAssociation, which he had carried into other branches of social and\r\npolitical activity. He proposed that a great national capital should\r\nbe accumulated for the purpose. Church lands, railways, mines, and\r\n\"some great industrial enterprises,\" which he never specified, were to\r\nbe nationalised, whether or not with compensation does not appear. At\r\none time he wished to confiscate in Italy the estates of those, who\r\nfought against the nationalist cause,--a proposal strangely out of\r\nharmony with his usual tolerance. The income from these sources, from\r\nthe rents of reclaimed lands and existing national and communal\r\nestates, and from properties which lapsed to the state, would form the\r\n\"National Fund\" or \"tax of democracy.\" At one time he destined part of\r\nthe fund to education, another part to assist any European democracy\r\nstruggling for its rights. But its main, and perhaps in his later idea\r\nits only purpose was to assist the spread of voluntary societies for\r\ncooperative production, industrial and agricultural. Any such society,\r\nthat could prove its members' honesty and capacity, might claim to\r\nhave its capital advanced from the Fund. The loans were to be at 1 or\r\n1½ per cent., and were to be made through special banks administered\r\nby the Communal Councils. Nothing is said as to the repayment of the\r\nloans, but as he contemplated the extension of the societies, till\r\nthey ultimately covered the whole field of industry, we may assume\r\nthat the loans were to be repaid and passed on to new societies. The\r\nsocieties were apparently to be left absolutely free as to the\r\nmanagement of their business, the sale of produce, and the disposal of\r\ntheir net income. To assist their credit, they were to have the right\r\nto deposit any unsold produce in national magazines, and receive in\r\nexchange negotiable notes, which, it seems to follow, would have been\r\nlegal tender. The societies were also to be admitted on equal terms\r\nwith private firms to contract for government work; this latter was\r\nperhaps the first suggestion of a system, which is now working in\r\nItaly with some success.\r\n\r\nSuch were Mazzini's sketchy but suggestive economic schemes,--schemes\r\nwhich, he believed, would ultimately destroy both poverty and\r\ncapitalism, without hardship to individuals or danger to liberty,\r\nleavening the social morality with the God-given principle of\r\nassociation. He seems to have never asked himself what would be the\r\nultimate destiny of his co-operative scheme; had he done so, he must\r\nhave seen that, by however different a road, it was bound to end in\r\ncollectivism. It will be recognized now that his plan was in all\r\nessentials identical with latter-day socialism, as put out by its best\r\nexponents, and it may be claimed that in the world of ideas Mazzini\r\nmore than Marx is its father. That his scheme would soon come into\r\nworking, he had little doubt, at all events in Italy. For in his\r\nsocial plans, as in all else, his own Italy was ever uppermost in\r\nmind. He knew, when few others knew it, the patience and common-sense\r\nand idealism of the Italian artisan, and he proudly counted on him to\r\nlet Italy lead the nations in the solution of the labour question.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[42] He was once arguing with Sir James Stansfeld as to the\r\npossibility of communism. Stansfeld said, \"Why should not all property\r\nbe vested in society?\" Mazzini replied, \"Because that is nonsense.\r\nSociety abstractedly is nothing, really a collection of individuals.\r\nIndividuals do the work, therefore individuals get the property; they\r\nmay give it away if they like, but the right to it is in themselves.\"\r\nThe spirit of the argument is curiously inconsistent with his usual\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nNationality\r\n\r\n     Country and humanity--The marks of nationality: the will of\r\n     the people; the sense of national mission--Patriotism--\r\n     International solidarity--Ethics of foreign policy:\r\n     non-intervention; war; the special missions of each\r\n     country--The future of Europe--The Slavs--The United\r\n     States of Europe--Italy's international function.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law of Duty, man's bounden service to humanity, goes on beyond the\r\nindividual and the state to be the rule of international relations.\r\nMan's end, so runs Mazzini's argument, is to serve the progress of\r\nhumanity. But the individual, in his isolated impotence, would shrink\r\nfrom the immensity of the burden. And for most men, humanity excites\r\nno effective sense of obligation; they will give for country what they\r\nwill not give for the wider and remoter circle of mankind. The\r\ncosmopolitan, who talks of duty to humanity and neglects the nation,\r\nis as one who bids men climb a ladder and takes away the rungs.\r\nTherefore Providence, once again applying the law of association, has\r\nplaced the individual among men of like feelings and aspirations, that\r\nserving his country he may serve humanity, that through the nation and\r\nits common strength he may have power to help the progress of the\r\nworld. Thus a nation is a God-appointed instrument for the welfare of\r\nthe race, and in this alone its moral essence lies. \"Nationality is\r\nsacred to me,\" he says, \"because I see in it the instrument of labour\r\nfor the good and progress of all men.\" \"Countries are the workshops of\r\nhumanity\"; \"a nation is a living task, her life is not her own, but a\r\nforce and a function in the universal Providential scheme.\" \"Humanity\r\nis a great army, marching to the conquest of unknown lands, against\r\nenemies both strong and cunning. The peoples are its corps, each with\r\nits special operation to carry out, and the common victory depends on\r\nthe exactness, with which they execute the different operations.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"division of European labour\" is essential to the progress of\r\nEurope, and, through it, of the world. But each group of humanity's\r\nworkmen, if it is to be efficient, must be organised, not by coercion,\r\nbut by free acceptance of their obligations; they must be impelled by\r\nduty and the sense of a great common work to do. Each nation must be a\r\nliving, homogeneous entity, with its own faith and consciousness of\r\nself. Europe, in Mazzini's lifetime, had little of this. He condemned\r\nits existing divisions as answering to no principle, since for the\r\nmost part they were agglomerations of territory, made in the interests\r\nof a royal dynasty or in the name of some artificial principle, as the\r\nbalance of power; and therefore they were powerless to inspire a\r\ncommon national effort for an intelligent and useful end. Factitious\r\nand immoral ends filled up the void; unsatisfied national yearnings\r\nburst imperiously through diplomatic schemes of peace; there was\r\nlittle of the burning love of independence, that alone safeguarded\r\nfrom designs of aggressive empire, from France in the past, from\r\nRussia in the present. The map of Europe must be drawn afresh, and\r\nstates be made conterminous with nationalities.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the inherent, essential marks of nationality? Are race\r\nand geographical features, language and literature, customs and\r\ntraditions? None of these, Mazzini replied, are more than secondary\r\nelements, race least of all. Wiser and juster than Bismarck and his\r\nschool, he saw that race, even if it were discoverable, has small\r\nconnection with the facts of to-day. He did not investigate the dark\r\nproblem of race characteristics, he did not even ask whether race\r\naffinities are among the physical causes that create a national\r\nfeeling. But, none the less, his argument is indestructible against\r\nthe theory that makes race the chief base of nationality. He was saved\r\nfrom ethnological fancies by his sensible conclusion, that races are\r\ntoo intimately compounded to be a cause of national character. \"There\r\nis not a single spot in Europe,\" he declared, \"where an unmixed race\r\ncan be detected.\" \"France, the most powerful nationality of the modern\r\nworld, is a mixture of Germans, Celts, and Romans.\" There is one\r\naspect however of the race question, that he did not sufficiently\r\nrecognise. However imaginary the original ethnological basis of a\r\ncountry may be and generally is, yet some races have been fixed for\r\nseveral centuries; and this has generated a belief in a common racial\r\norigin, which, however false historically, may none the less, when\r\nsupported by a common language, become an important and sometimes a\r\ndominant factor in creating a sense of nationality.\r\n\r\nHe gave his fancy play in determining the influence of geography. He\r\nloved geographical study, and as usual sought for a spiritual purpose\r\nunderlying the physical facts. \"By the courses of the great rivers, by\r\nthe lines of the high mountains, and other geographical features God\r\nhas marked the natural borders of the nations.\" \"Nationalities,\" he\r\nsaid, \"appear to me to have been traced long ago by the finger of\r\nProvidence on the map of Europe\"; and Italy, for instance, had her\r\n\"sublime, irrefutable boundary marks.\" He left this transcendentalism\r\nfor safer ground, when he came to language and literature, and\r\nrecognised what potent factors they had been in the making of nations.\r\nThe importance of language was sufficiently obvious. Literature had\r\nsometimes, as in the case of his own Italy, remained the one surviving\r\nsign of nationality, when all else was lost. He knew how great had\r\nbeen the influence of Dante in forming the national sense of his own\r\ncountry; how much the Polish poets of the century had done to feed the\r\nSlav national spirit; how intimate is the power of national melodies;\r\nwhat the common possession of a great poet may do to knit a people. He\r\nrealised too, though perhaps insufficiently, how history has helped to\r\nform nations; how a common government draws a people together in\r\ncommon loyalty or common revolt; how war may be a welding influence;\r\nhow men, living for generations under the same law, acquire from it\r\ncommon habits and customs and traditions.\r\n\r\nAll these, however, are but the formative elements of nationality;\r\nthey are not its essence. Mazzini's clear democratic faith kept him\r\nfrom confusing the justification of the fact with its causes.\r\nNationality was independent of any of them. Centuries of divided\r\ngovernment had not destroyed the national sense of Italy; Switzerland\r\nwas a nation for all its diversity of languages; difference of tongues\r\ndid not prevent Poland and Lithuania from sharing the same national\r\naspirations; Alsace belonged to France, however German it might be by\r\nrace and history. Nationality is a sentiment, a moral phenomenon,\r\nwhich may be generated by material causes, but exists by virtue of\r\nmoral facts. On any theory of freedom or democracy it can have no\r\npositive, meaning basis but the popular will; and it is a parody of\r\nnationality that unites by coercion. \"Nationalities can be founded\r\nonly for and upon and by the people\"; and it follows that when the\r\ninhabitants of a territory desire to be a nation, provided that behind\r\ntheir desire there lies a moral purpose, they have the right to be\r\none. This, despite slight and rare inconsistencies, he made the broad\r\nclear principle of modern, democratic nationality, a principle\r\n\"invincible as conscience,\" whose triumph no hostility of kings or\r\nstatesmen, no artificial counterfeits can permanently hinder.\r\n\r\nStill, he held, the mere fact of the popular will is not enough.\r\nNationality, like every political phenomenon, must have a moral aim to\r\njustify it. A mere momentary reaction against misgovernment, for\r\ninstance, gave no sufficient claim to independence. \"In questions of\r\nnationality, as in every other question, the end alone is sovereign\";\r\nand a true nation must have its moral intention, its clear and\r\nunderstood mission to accomplish for itself and for humanity, its\r\nconscious part in realising the divine idea on earth. It is only in\r\nits homage to the moral law, that a nation finds its \"baptism and\r\nconsecration.\" \"A community of men drawn together by a selfish\r\nprinciple for a purely material purpose is not thereby a nation. To\r\nconstitute a nation, its informing principle and purpose and right\r\nmust be grounded on eternal bases. The purpose must be essentially a\r\nmoral one, since a material interest by itself is by its nature\r\nfinite, and can therefore form no basis of perpetual union.\" \"Country\r\nis not a territory; territory is only its base; country is the idea\r\nthat rises on that base, the thought of love that draws together all\r\nthe sons of that territory.\"\r\n\r\nThis love is patriotism. \"O my brothers,\" he says, \"love your country.\r\nCountry is our house, the house that God has given us, setting therein\r\na populous family, to love us and be loved by us, to understand us and\r\nbe understood by us better and more readily than others are.\" It was\r\nby such burning patriotism he saved his country and was first to\r\npractise it himself. But he detested the sentimental and emotional\r\npatriot. His patriotism was a silent, manly thing, that hated display\r\nand braggart talk; it was as a steady spiritual flame, that never\r\nroared to heaven and never sank to ashes. He tested it by its fruit in\r\nthe individual life. No ill-living man was true patriot. \"Let\r\ncountry,\" he said, \"be incarnated in each one of you; each one of you\r\nfeel and make himself responsible for his brothers; each of you so act\r\nthat in yourselves men may respect and love your country.\" \"Where the\r\ncitizen does not know that he must give lustre to his country, not\r\nborrow lustre from it, that country may be strong but never happy.\"\r\nReal patriotism will not fear to speak the truth. \"Flattery will never\r\nsave a country, nor proud words make us less abject.\" \"The honour of\r\na country depends much more on removing its faults than on boasting of\r\nits qualities.\" One can imagine what would have been his scorn for the\r\ndegenerate imperialism of latter days. The patriot's supreme desire is\r\nthat his country's true honour may be untarnished; he thinks more of\r\nduty than of victory. His own Roman Republic, that glorious and\r\nilluminating example of patriotism, had small hope of success, but its\r\nhonour stood entire, and therefore morally it triumphed. Success,\r\nempire, military glory may be a country's lot; so may failure and\r\ndefeat and poverty; neither this nor that fate touches its real being.\r\nTrue national dignity and glory lie in right doing, and humiliation\r\ncomes only from public dishonour and a mendacious diplomacy. \"You must\r\nkeep your country pure of selfishness,\" was his maxim of patriotism\r\nfor Italian working men.\r\n\r\nPatriotism, then, is intense regard for a country's moral greatness;\r\nand it expresses itself in that sense of national duty, which he held\r\nto be the only justification of a country's national existence. This\r\nduty has two objects, the community itself and all humanity. We have\r\nseen what he conceived to be a nation's duty to its members; there is\r\nno true country, he said, without a national education, or where men\r\nstarve for want of work. Here we are more concerned with that\r\nforwardness to serve humanity, which he made the other mark of the\r\ntrue nation. \"National life and international life should be two\r\nmanifestations of the same principle, the love of good.\" Above the\r\nseparate nations stands the European brotherhood, the late-born child\r\nof Christianity. Sir Thomas More, he says, first formulated the new\r\nlaw of peace; literature and trade and travel are ever drawing the\r\nnations together by \"a law of moral gravitation\"[43]; the French\r\nRevolution echoed through the democracies of Europe; the struggle with\r\nNapoleon renewed the common understanding of the nations. The cause of\r\nthe people is the same the whole world over, and the democracies must\r\njoin hands to fight the battle of them all, as he had tried to make\r\nthem do, when he founded Young Europe. Humanitarian movements,--the\r\nabolition of the slave trade, the cause of Greece and Italy,--were\r\nEuropean. \"There exists then in Europe a harmony of needs and wishes,\r\na common thought, a universal mind, which directs the nations by\r\nconvergent paths to the same goal.\" No country may be isolated,\r\neconomically or intellectually; and it is a poor and counterfeit\r\npatriotism, that despises other countries. That way lies destruction.\r\n\"A nation's growth depends on the trust that other peoples place in\r\nit\"; a country guided by a moral principle \"finds everything open\r\nreadily to it from markets to political alliances,\" but one that\r\nstands for an unjust policy has mistrust and jealousy for its portion.\r\n\r\nHence the country, that does injury to another, sins against itself.\r\n\"I hate,\" he said, \"the monopolist, usurping nation, that sees its own\r\nstrength and greatness only in the weakness and poverty of others.\"\r\nThat is a poor and stunted people, whose foreign policy is \"one of\r\naggrandisement and selfishness, whether it seeks them basely or buys\r\nglory at other men's expense.\" Countries, that cherish liberty at\r\nhome and outrage it abroad, \"are fated to expiate their error through\r\nlong years of isolation and oppression and anarchy.\" So far he\r\npreached familiar doctrine, but he carried it into regions of his own.\r\nInternational duty does not stop at non-aggression. Every country has\r\nits positive duty to humanity; and while evil is enthroned, and right\r\ncan hardly hold its own, and the eternal battle rages round, it may\r\nnot stand aside in cowardly forgetfulness. Mazzini abhorred the\r\ndoctrine of non-intervention--the principle that no country may\r\ninterfere in the domestic matters of another,--a doctrine which the\r\nAmericans and Canning introduced for the protection of freedom, but\r\nwhich less hardy statesmen in France and England had perverted to\r\nexcuse their own faint-heartedness. If the principle had been\r\ngenerally accepted, if it had meant for instance that France could not\r\nintervene at Rome or Russia restore despotism in Hungary, it might\r\nhave worked successfully. But practically it meant that \"intervention\r\nwas all on the wrong side,\" that only England observed the principle,\r\nand therefore the one Great Power, which in some degree stood for\r\nliberty, tied its own hands, while the Powers that stood for despotism\r\nworked \"their unhallowed ends when, where, and how they thought fit\"\r\nover three-fourths of Europe. As Mazzini pointed out, the theory took\r\nfor granted a system based on nationality; and where nationality was\r\nnon-existent, as in Italy and South-Eastern Europe, it had no rightful\r\napplication. At the best it was a \"poor and incomplete\" doctrine. A\r\ncountry has its \"bonds of international duty,\" obligatory in proportion\r\nto its strength. \"The absolute doctrine of non-intervention in\r\npolitics corresponds to indifference in religion; it is a masked\r\natheism, a negation of all belief, of every general principle, of any\r\nmission of a nation in humanity's behalf.\" \"Neutrality in a war of\r\nprinciples is mere passive existence, forgetfulness of all that makes\r\na people sacred, the negation of the common law of nations, political\r\natheism. On one side,\" he was speaking to Englishmen in 1859, \"stands\r\nthe flag of liberty and right, of the true and good; on the other the\r\nflag of tyranny and ambition, of the false and evil. And you, a free\r\nnation and strong, you who profess belief in truth and justice, would\r\nyou say, 'Between evil and good we will remain neutral, impassive\r\nspectators'? It is the word of Cain. No people, that chooses to teach\r\nthat policy, may dare to call itself Christian, for it is practically\r\na people of atheists or cowards. Sooner or later a tremendous\r\nexpiation will visit the cowardly desertion of the duty which God lays\r\non peoples as on individuals.\" \"Can it be that England,\" he wrote\r\ntwelve years earlier, \"the England of the Reformation, the England of\r\nElizabeth and of Cromwell, self-centred in immoral indifference, gives\r\nup Europe to the dictatorship of force?\"\r\n\r\nHence he was no believer in peace at any price. Sternly, indeed, he\r\ncondemned war, when it was not fought for a right principle; it was\r\n\"fratricide,\" if not imperative in the interests of the race. But it\r\nwas \"sacred as peace, when the triumph of good is to be its issue.\" He\r\nattacked the Manchester School for perverting the sense of human\r\nsolidarity. \"Peace,\" he wrote to the Geneva Congress of 1867, \"cannot\r\nbecome a law of human society, except by passing through the\r\nstruggle, which will ground life and association on foundations of\r\njustice and liberty, on the wreck of every power which exists not for\r\na principle but for a dynastic interest.\" Europe, he held, could not\r\nhave lasting peace, till Austria and Turkey made way for the\r\nnationalities, which they held down; it would ever be perturbed by\r\nfears of Russian aggression, till Poland was restored to be its\r\nbulwark; and only war could free the Poles and Southern Slavs. \"When\r\nyou have substituted justice for tyranny, truth for falsehood, duty\r\nfor selfish interests, the republic for monarchy, then you will have\r\npeace, but not till then.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini, unluckily, was not content with the broad human principle\r\nthat a country must use its strength for right and freedom everywhere.\r\nHe appended a theory, which has its germ of truth, but defies\r\ndefinition, and is easily twisted to save a special argument. Each\r\nnation had, he thought, some distinct and specialised service to\r\nrender to humanity. \"God has written one line of his thought on the\r\ncradle of each people.\" \"Special interests, special aptitudes, and\r\nbefore all special functions, a special mission to fulfil, a special\r\nwork to be done in the cause of the advancement of humanity, seem to\r\nme the true, infallible characteristics of nationalities.\" The theory\r\nescapes any exact precision; but it offers a rich field for poetry,\r\nand Mazzini's imagination was at home in it. England's function was\r\n\"industry and colonies,\" Russia's was the civilisation of Asia,\r\nPoland's \"the Slav initiative.\" Germany's mark was thought, France's\r\nwas action, Italy's thought in unison with action. \"While the German\r\nwalks earth with his sight lost in the depths of heaven, and the\r\nFrenchman's eye rarely looks aloft but scours earth's surface with its\r\nrestless penetrating glance, the Genius, that guards the destinies of\r\nItaly, has been ever wont to pass swiftly from the ideal to the real,\r\nseeking from of old how earth and heaven may be joined together.\" We\r\nhave seen what curious use he made of this theory of special missions\r\nto rebut Irish claims.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principles of nationality, and nations built on them\r\nwould make the Europe of the future. Mazzini believed that democracy\r\nwould tend towards large nations. He repudiated any love of\r\nadministrative centralisation and urged the widest local government;\r\nbut the bigger the nation, the more perfect, he thought, would be the\r\ndevelopment of association within it, and the greater therefore its\r\nmomentum on the road of progress. And, as the larger nations would be\r\napproximately equal in territory or population, a new and natural\r\nbalance of power would arise to safeguard peace. This liking for large\r\ncountries sometimes nearly led him into inconsistencies with his own\r\nprinciples, and made him question the national basis of most small\r\nstates. He made a confident forecast of the future European\r\nsettlement. (He was writing, of course, prior to 1870.) England and\r\nFrance (apart from Savoy and Nice) were the only countries, whose\r\nterritory marched with their natural borders, and they alone would\r\nremain unchanged. Italy would be united, and include the border\r\ndistricts and islands that spoke the Italian tongue, except,\r\napparently, the Canton of the Ticino. Germany, including the\r\nGerman-speaking provinces of Austria, would also achieve its unity,\r\nbut be divided into two or three \"great administrative sections.\"\r\nSpain and Portugal would form a single country. Greece would expand\r\nover all territories with a Greek-speaking population. Switzerland\r\nwould be the nucleus of an Alpine Federation, embracing Savoy and the\r\nTyrol. Holland was, apparently, to keep its independence; Belgium, on\r\nthe other hand, had no future as a nation, though he does not indicate\r\nits destiny. In early life he seems to have thought that Denmark would\r\nremain a separate state; afterwards he believed that the three\r\nScandinavian states were inevitably destined to unity.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult problem, of course, was that of Eastern Europe.\r\nMazzini evidently thought that, next to the unity of his own country,\r\nthe Slav movement was the most important question in European\r\npolitics. Here was a mighty people, awakening to life, proving its\r\npower by its literature,--for it, he believed, had produced the only\r\nliving poetry since Goethe and Byron,--claiming its rightful place in\r\nthe European commonwealth. Nothing could arrest the self-assertion of\r\nthe Slavs, but the future of Europe largely depended on the direction\r\nwhich it took. If the other nations hailed it and guided it, it would\r\nenrich the life of Europe by the new elements it brought into it; if\r\nit went unfriended and undirected, it would be perverted into\r\n\"Czarism,\" and cost Europe twenty years of bloodshed to check\r\nMuscovite ambitions. Two things Europe would do well to keep in mind.\r\nIt was as useless as it was immoral to bolster up Austria and Turkey,\r\nfor the Slav movement would be inevitably fatal to them both. And\r\nEurope must see that the Slavs became a barrier and not a help to\r\nRussian designs of domination. This could be done, and done only, by\r\nhelping the non-Russian Slavs to organise themselves into powerful and\r\nindependent nations. Czarism owed its strength not to Panslavist\r\naspirations, but to the fact that the Czar was the only hope of the\r\nChristian populations of the Balkans. Mazzini's detailed forecast of\r\nthe Slav national settlement varied from time to time; but his\r\nfavourite plan was that Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Serbs should form\r\nfour separate nationalities. In curious and impossible inconsistency\r\nwith his own principles, he seems to have thought that Hungary and\r\nRoumania would be annexed to or federated with one or other of these\r\nstates; and he looked to a federal union of Serbs and Greeks, with\r\nConstantinople, as a free city, for the centre of the federation.\r\n\r\nOut of the nationalities would grow \"the United States of Europe, the\r\nrepublican alliance of the peoples,\" \"that great European federation,\r\nwhose task it is to unite in one association all the political\r\nfamilies of the old world, destroy the partitions that dynastic\r\nrivalries have made, and consolidate and respect nationalities.\"\r\nMazzini's ken, strange to say, was almost restricted to Europe. He\r\nscarcely mentions in this connection the American United States,\r\nthough sometimes he seems perhaps to imply that they would enter the\r\nEuropean commonwealth. He had no inkling that Eastern races might\r\nclaim their own independent development. His forecast of European\r\ncolonisation hardly extended beyond Asia and North Africa; he believed\r\nthat Asia was destined to be \"an appendix of Europe,\" and that the\r\ngreat stream of European colonisation would set towards it, chiefly\r\nthrough the agency of Russia and England. Thus he was concerned with\r\nEurope only; and for the Europe of the future, a federation of\r\nharmonious nationalities, he had a splendid prophecy. When nationality\r\nhad triumphed, \"all cause of war would disappear, and in its place\r\narise a spirit of brotherhood and peaceful emulation on the road of\r\nprogress.\" Revolutions would be no more, and \"the slow, continuous,\r\nnormal unfolding of activities and powers\" would lead the nations ever\r\nonwards. We come again to his vision of a European authority, sitting\r\nat Rome to give guidance and harmony to the peoples. When the great\r\nday arrived, that brought the victory of liberty and nationality, the\r\npeoples would assemble their \"true General Council.\" No doubt the\r\nCouncil was the same as that which would define the new religious\r\nfaith. It would formulate the common national duties of the peoples,\r\nand secure their freedom to perform those duties, while the separate\r\nnational councils defined the special duty of each country.\r\n\r\nIt would be Italy's glorious function to lead the nations to this\r\nunity. France had lost the opportunity in 1815; England, when she\r\nisolated herself from the life of Europe by her enslavement to\r\nnon-intervention; the Slav countries were disqualified by their\r\nrivalries or obsequiousness to Russia. Italy had her unquestioned\r\ntitles to the proud hegemony,--her geographical position, her\r\ncharacter, her traditions, the universal looking for some great thing\r\nto come out of her new life. She was \"the land destined by God to the\r\ngreat mission of giving moral unity to Europe, and through Europe to\r\nHumanity.\" She would be the armed apostle of nationality, the\r\nprotectress of oppressed peoples, the instrument to destroy Austria\r\nand Turkey and give freedom to the Slavs. And when this part of her\r\nmission was fulfilled, and through her nationality was victorious,\r\nthen the gratitude of the peoples, and the divine appointment of\r\nProvidence, and her own essential fitness for the task, would make\r\nRome the centre of the cause of peace, the seat of the Diet of the\r\nnations, fulfilling Dante's vision, that saw her \"helmsman\" of\r\nhumanity, to steer it to its peace. It was a noble dream, much of it,\r\nit may be, fantastic and impossible, and yet, perhaps, with its seed\r\nof truth. The European Federation tarries behind Mazzini's eager\r\nprophecy, but its coming cannot be delayed for ever. The triumph of\r\nnationality, despite the evil deed of 1870, has advanced with mighty\r\nstrides since his day. And though patriotism has often erred into\r\nignoble paths, and international fraternity gone backward, yet the\r\nevil creates its own remedy, and disarmament becomes an ever more\r\nimportunate desire. When the nations learn that arbitration and\r\ndisarmament are necessary for their own self-preservation, when the\r\nEuropean federation gradually evolves itself, Rome will be the natural\r\nseat of the High Court of Europe. Italy, which by her plebiscitary\r\norigin has given a rule to the nationalities,--a country practically\r\nwithout territorial ambitions or colonial empire, the natural mediator\r\nbetween the two great European alliances, with her ancient prestige\r\nand service to humanity to give her lustre, has paramount claims to\r\nthe high prerogative.[44]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] The first address of the People's International League, from\r\nwhich these words are quoted, was written by W. J. Linton, but was\r\nbased on Mazzini's rough draft.\r\n\r\n[44] M. Novicow in his _Missione d'Italia_ has recently expressed the\r\nsame belief, almost in Mazzini's words. [But the Tripoli business has\r\nchanged all this.--1911.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nLiterary Criticism\r\n\r\n     The function of the critic--The function of the poet--Art\r\n     must avoid 'art for the sake of art' and realism--It must be\r\n     human, social, didactic--Poetry of modern life--The\r\n     historical drama--Music--'Objective' and 'subjective'\r\n     poets--Dante--Shakespeare--Goethe--Byron.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Mazzini's busy life could have spared more time for literary study,\r\nhe would probably have been among the greatest critics of the century;\r\nperhaps, even as it is, he may rank among them. He misses in his lack\r\nof accurate and detailed study; but he has a rare penetration and\r\noriginality and gift of embracing synthesis. It was his ambition at\r\none time to found an Italian school of criticism, whose mark should be\r\nconstructive and sympathetic interpretation. Keenly sensitive though\r\nhe was to beauty of expression, he detested mere criticism of form and\r\nthe profitless microscopy, that pries for specks in a writer's life or\r\nwork. He loved to read a great author reverently, hiding rather than\r\nexposing his blemishes, penetrating below uncouthnesses of form and\r\ncasual lapses to the great informing thoughts, that had their lesson\r\nfor the world. \"At the present day,\" he wrote in an optimistic moment,\r\n\"we neither worship a genius blindly, nor outrage him barbarously; we\r\nset ourselves to understand him, and we learn to love him. We regard\r\nforms as secondary and perishable phenomena; the idea alone is sacred,\r\nas a thing baptised to everlasting life, and we try how we may lift\r\nthe veil that hides it.\" He compared genius to the fabled tree of\r\nTeneriffe, whose branches discharged showers of refreshing water.\r\n\"Genius is like this tree, and the mission of criticism should be to\r\nshake the branches. At the present day it more resembles a savage\r\nstriving to hew down the noble tree to the roots.\"\r\n\r\nIn his scheme of life the poet had a part of supreme importance. He\r\nregarded literature as a \"moral priesthood.\" Poetry would \"save the\r\nworld in its despite,\" for it was the poet's prerogative to redeem it\r\nfrom doubt and base ideals, to \"reveal duties and create affections,\"\r\nto lift men up above the trivial things of life to the eternal\r\nverities. \"We have,\" he cries in the forties, \"exiled poetry from\r\nlife, and enthusiasm and faith have gone with it, and love, as I\r\nunderstand love, and constancy in sacrifice, and the worship of great\r\ndeeds and great men.\" His own Italy had little of the throbbing\r\nnational life, in which alone true poetry could flourish; and\r\neverywhere an age of faithlessness robbed the poet of his aliment. The\r\ntime was for the critic,--the constructive, \"philosophic\" critic; he\r\nwas the \"literary educator,\" and he could at all events be precursor\r\nof the poet of the future, marking the lines on which a modern\r\ndemocratic poetry should travel, and preparing a public to understand\r\nhim. \"The critic,\" he says, \"is unrelated to genius; but he stands as\r\na link between great writers and the masses; he explores the\r\nconditions and literary needs of the time, and preaches them to the\r\nnations, that they may learn to feel them, and desire and demand them;\r\nin fine, his prophecies prepare a public for the writer:--a more\r\nimportant matter than some think, for very rarely do writers appear\r\nbefore their time.\"\r\n\r\nAs critic, then, Mazzini points out the deficiencies of contemporary\r\nliterature, and the principles which must take it to a higher stage.\r\nTrue art, he lays down, has two great perils to avoid. First, there is\r\nthe \"atheist formula\" of 'art for the sake of art';--a heresy he\r\nscourged with pontifical anathemas. His attack was not aimed at\r\nperfection of literary form. He loved a correct and classic diction,\r\nand never underrated style, so long as style was not an excuse for\r\npoverty of thought. His criticism went deeper. The artist may not live\r\nhis own art-life, divorced from the moving world around and all its\r\nmanifold activities, \"floating bubble-like without support,\" finding\r\nhis poor inspiration in his own fancies and caprices. There was no\r\ntrue individuality in that; invented though it was to guard the poet's\r\nindependence, in reality it made him but a passive mirror of each\r\npassing impression. Instead of liberty, it brought anarchy and \"wild,\r\narbitrary intellectual display.\" It robbed art of touch with the great\r\nfacts of life, all fruitful relationship to the struggling, ever\r\nlearning, ever advancing race. It sent it wandering lawless,\r\npurposeless, like a sick man's dreams. The poet ceased to be a thinker\r\nand a teacher, and sank to a mere empty singer. \"What I want,\" he\r\nsaid, \"is not the Artist but the man-Artist; the High-Priest of the\r\nIdeal, not the worshipper of his own Fetishes.\" Literature must be\r\n\"the minister of something greater and more valuable than itself.\"\r\n\r\nHe was almost equally condemnatory of realism, especially of realistic\r\npresentation of nature. It was a criticism that he brought alike\r\nagainst Monti and Victor Hugo and Wordsworth, that they \"depicted but\r\nnever transfigured nature,\" and thus their art was \"useless.\" The real\r\nis the mantle of the true, but not the true; \"high poetry is truth,\r\nbecause you cannot trace out or analyse its source.\" The poet is a\r\n\"miner in the moral world\"; his function is to hew beneath the symbol,\r\nbeneath the real, to the idea shut in within; questioning nature alike\r\nin her beauties and deformities, to find and teach to men \"that\r\nfragment of God's truth that must exist there.\" \"One thing I know,\" he\r\nsays, \"that the phenomena of nature on their moral side and the inner\r\nlife of man must be the field of modern literature, that physical\r\nnature and man's outer life will have their place only as symbols of\r\nthe first.\" And nature's lessons must have a practical reference to\r\nman's lot and destiny. Even when nature was rightly used and\r\ninterpreted, there might be too much of it, and he seems to have\r\nalways given natural poetry a secondary place. \"Poetry,\" he says, \"is\r\nnot in nature but in man.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings us to his conception of true art. It must be essentially\r\nhuman, not realistically so, but usefully, practically, didactically.\r\nHe did not mean by this that it must confine itself to the obvious,\r\noutside facts of life. \"In every powerful poetic impression the\r\n_vague_ claims a full quarter, and the vague, which must not be\r\nconfounded with the obscure, is the soul's own field.\" But poetry,\r\nhowever much it may concern itself with the spiritual and unseen, must\r\nhave direct application to the problems of life. \"Art lives of the\r\nworld's life; the world's law is art's law.\" The poet must gather \"the\r\ngreat voice of the world and God,\" and so interpret it, that men may\r\nlisten and profit. He must contemplate man both in his individuality\r\nand as a social creature, \"in his internal and external life, in his\r\nplace and with his mission in creation.\" \"Poetry,--great, ceaseless,\r\neternal poetry,--exists only in the development, the evolution of\r\nlife: only there, in life, understood and felt in its universality,\r\ncan inexhaustible variety be found.\"\r\n\r\nThus the poet must find his inspiration, not in his own \"incomplete,\r\nmutilated conceptions,\" not in the isolated individual, but in the\r\ngreat collective, democratic movements of the people, voicing their\r\ndim thoughts and aspirations, \"their latent, slumbering, unconscious\r\nlife.\" There can be no great poetry to-day, unless the poet identify\r\nhimself with \"the thought fermenting in the breast of the masses and\r\nimpelling them to action.\" Poets are the priesthood of the social and\r\npolitical movement, which is the very blood of a modern people; and\r\nthere is no place for individualist poetry in a social age. \"True and\r\nsacred art aims at the perfection of society,\" and the art of the\r\nfuture will be \"principally religious and political.\" He hated the\r\naimless art, that busies itself with the mere picturesque and\r\nsentimental, which idealises ages, whose meaning and moral standard\r\nhave passed. He applauded Schlegel's thesis that poetry must be\r\n\"national, that is useful and related to the civil and political\r\nsituation,\" no longer heedless of the great movements of to-day, but\r\n\"standing in the centre and swaying the heart of the social impulse.\"\r\nThe poet, who went to fight for Greece and died there, typified \"the\r\nholy alliance of poetry with the cause of the peoples.\"\r\n\r\nThis democratic art must have a practical use by being didactic and\r\nprophetic. It is not enough that its heart should beat with the\r\npeople's life; it must help the progress of the race by pointing to\r\nthe future. Though it may \"grow among the ruins, art is ever coloured\r\nby the rising sun.\" \"There can be no true poetry without a\r\npresentiment of the future\"; it is, as said \"the extraordinary man,\"\r\nwho is the poet of all time,\r\n\r\n                   The prophetic soul\r\n     Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come.\r\n\r\n\"Art either sums up the life of a dying age or heralds one about to\r\ndawn; it is no caprice of this or that individual, but a solemn page\r\nof history or a prophecy; most powerful, when as in Dante, and\r\noccasionally in Byron, it is both.\" But there is no gift of prophecy\r\nwithout an ideal, and \"literature, like politics, has no secure\r\nfoundation without its fixed beliefs and principles,\"--those beliefs\r\nwhich make the future and to which facts must bow. \"The true European\r\nwriter will be a philosopher, but with the poet's lyre in his hands.\"\r\n\"Nature with her thousand voices cries to the poet, 'Soar, thou art\r\nKing of earth.' And if we try to pen him down to realism, and rob him\r\nof his independent lordship over facts, the poets of the past will\r\nanswer from their graves, 'We were great, because we created.' It is\r\nfor poetry to take the creations of the philosopher and give them life\r\nand colour, to explore the truth that lies below the real and illumine\r\nit with the light of genius, to interpret the universal laws that rule\r\nover human history.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the poet must not only lift men to his vision, but send them forth\r\nin quest of it. He is not only prophet but apostle. It is not enough\r\nthat he should stimulate thought; he must \"spur men to translate\r\nthought into action.\" \"Contemplative\" poets, Wordsworth and Coleridge\r\nfor instance, are \"incomplete.\" \"The element of Action is inseparable\r\nfrom poetry. Poetry,\" he says, \"is for me something like the third\r\nperson of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, which is action.\" \"In order to\r\nbe a religious poet,\" he writes in criticism of Lamartine, \"it is not\r\nenough, in my eyes at least to say 'Lord, Lord'; it is necessary to\r\n_feel_ his holy law, and to make others feel it in such sort, as that\r\nthey shall constantly and calmly act in obedience to its precepts.\"\r\nJust as religion gives life and power to philosophy, so it is for art\r\nto grasp ideas, translate them by images and symbols, and make them\r\npassionate beliefs. \"Poetry is enthusiasm with wings of fire, the\r\nangel of strong thoughts, the power that raises men to sacrifice,\r\nconsumes them, stirs a tumult of ideas within them, puts in their\r\nhands a sword, a pen, a dagger.\" \"Written poetry, like music\r\nperformed, should be in some sense a prelude to other poetry, which\r\nthe excited soul of the reader composes silently within itself.\" It\r\nwill \"teach the young all that is greatest in self-sacrifice,\r\nconstancy, silence, the sense of solitude without despair, long years\r\nof torture or delusion unrevealed and dumb, faith in the things that\r\nare to be, the hourly struggle for that faith, though hope of victory\r\nthere be none in this life.\" And therefore art must be ever brave and\r\nfull of hope, \"teaching man not his weakness but his strength,\r\ninspiring him not with faintheartedness but with energy and vigorous\r\nwill.\" Its song must be always of steadiness and constancy, and\r\n\"calmness radiate from the poet's brow, as the spirit of God radiated\r\nfrom the brow of Moses on the wandering Israelites.\" \"The artist is\r\neither a priest or a more or less practised mountebank.\" Woe to him,\r\nif he teach spasmodic, evanescent effort, or \"revolt and impotent\r\ndespair, that dies cursing, ere it tries to fight, that says 'All\r\nthings are evil,' because it finds itself unable to create good.\"\r\nMazzini has no pity for the poet of pessimism, \"whose sense of moral\r\ndepression and languor\" will, if he pose as a religious poet, make his\r\nreaders \"reject religion and him together.\"\r\n\r\nPoetry, then, the modern poetry of action, being essentially related\r\nto politics and social life, the poet's themes are in the stir and\r\npassion of contemporary events or in national history. What field for\r\nliterature like the mighty, moving pageant of the democratic world? To\r\nwatch God's hand guiding the nations to their destinies, to probe the\r\neager ferment of a modern society, to interpret all the dim,\r\nhalf-conscious yearning of the masses,--what inspiration for the poet\r\nhere! \"Popular poetry has invaded everything, the poetry whose epic is\r\nrevolution, whose satire is revolt.\" How strong and living are the\r\ngiants of the Revolution beside the nerveless men and women of the\r\nquietist novel. \"Poetry has fled from old Europe to give life to the\r\nyoung, new, beautiful Europe of the peoples. Like the swallow, it has\r\nleft a crumbling ruin to seek a purer air and a more verdant world. It\r\nhas fled from the King's solitary throne to find its abode in the\r\ngreat arena of the peoples, in the ranks of martyrs for the\r\nfatherland, on the patriot's scaffold, in the prison of the brave\r\nbetrayed.\" The armies of the Convention, the guerilla-bands of Spain,\r\nthe German students chanting the songs of Körner on the march to\r\nbattle, the patriot's anguished passion, the dreams of a liberty to\r\nbe, the world-mission of European civilisation,--these are the modern\r\npoet's themes. \"Think you that poetry, whose birth was ushered by such\r\ndeeds as these, can die ere it has lived? Would you set up the poor,\r\npale, narrow poetry of individuals, a poetry of forms, a poetry that\r\nlives and dies in the small circle of a palace or a chapel or a\r\ncastle,--would you set up this against the grand _social_ poetry,\r\nsolemn and tranquil and full of hope, which knows none but God in\r\nheaven and the people upon earth?\" An age of science and industry is\r\nno enemy to poetry, for the elements of poetry are eternal. \"I tell\r\nyou, in this Europe there is such life, such poetry in germ, the\r\npoetry of ages, of all the generations, that genius itself has not yet\r\ndared to attempt to develop it.\" \"Here round you,\" so he speaks to the\r\npoet of the future, \"here, before your eyes, there is poetry and\r\nmovement and a European people waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet has another field in history. Mazzini prophesied a great\r\nfuture for the historical drama. He was inclined to think that drama\r\nwould be the accepted form of modern poetry, seeing doubtless that\r\ndrama is the true communion between poet and people, the natural\r\nvehicle of the artist, who has a message to deliver. It would be \"a\r\nkind of popular pulpit, a chair of the philosophy of humanity\"; and he\r\nlooked forward to the day when the great dramas, such as those of\r\n\"divine Schiller,\" would be produced on the stage without mutilations\r\nor curtailments to a reverent and patient audience. The function of\r\nthe historical dramatist, as indeed he thought it was the function of\r\nthe prose historian, was not so much to make minute research of facts,\r\nas to disentangle the lessons hidden under every page of history, to\r\ninterpret the law of human duty and the mystery of existence. Like\r\nevery other poet, he must start with a philosophy of life, judging all\r\nthings by his own law, meting out praise and blame, drawing guidance\r\nfor the future from the past. The dramatist \"may call up the shadows\r\nof the past, but like the Witch of Endor, in order to constrain them\r\nto reveal the future.\" His personages must be types, each with its\r\nsocial significance; he must not, as Victor Hugo did, overload them\r\nwith individual traits, till they lose their message for society, but\r\nrather, as Schiller with his Marquis di Posa, so \"re-create\" them,\r\nthat they may illustrate some general law of life. Mazzini did not see\r\nhow pale such characters would be; how difficult it was to reconcile\r\nthem with biographical accuracy, how likely therefore they were to\r\nfalsify any induction of historical laws.\r\n\r\nHis theory of music was a very similar one. Music, like poetry, he\r\nthought, was nought without a moral intention, without practical\r\nteaching and power to inspire. It should be \"the purest and most\r\ngeneral and most sympathetic expression of a social faith.\" He\r\npitilessly criticised the music of the thirties, imitative, exhausted,\r\nartificial, clever but without creative power. A faithless and corrupt\r\ngeneration asked for music to amuse it; and music had listened and\r\nforgotten its mission. There was melody and good instrumentation, but\r\nno soul or thought in it. It was \"laughter without peace, weeping\r\nwithout virtue.\" Operas had no unity, no great passionate note; they\r\nwere ingenious mosaics, much of them mere noise and extravagance,\r\ninferior for all their technique to the chants of the medieval Church,\r\nwhen music had a religious work to do. Rossini had done something; he\r\nhad broken from the old canons and given liberty to music; but he had\r\nthe defects of the Romanticist school, he had freed but could not\r\ncreate; he had prepared the way for the music of the future, but it\r\nwas not his to write it. Mazzini however saw indications that the new\r\nmusic was not far off, and its dawn, he believed, would be in Italy.\r\nBut Italian melody must wed itself to German harmony. Italian music\r\nwas \"lyrical, impassioned, volcanic, artistic,\" but without unity or\r\nsoul. German music knew God, but it was mystical and impersonal, out\r\nof touch with everyday human life. It dulled men's impulses to action;\r\nit stirred them, but to no useful end, left the soul full of great\r\nemotion, but uninspired to perform plain duties.[45] Mazzini was\r\nassured that Italy would produce the master, who would unite the\r\nstrength of both schools, keep the religion of the German school, but\r\npoint it to practical, human ends. At one time he hoped that perhaps\r\nDonizetti might live to do this; afterwards he thought that Meyerbeer\r\nwas \"the precursor spirit of the music of the future.\" He was always\r\nthinking of Opera. When he insists that the music should be in keeping\r\nwith the subject and its period, when he pleads for the symbolic use\r\nof the orchestra, for the wider employment of motives, for the\r\ndevelopment of the chorus on the model of Greek tragedy, for the large\r\nuse of recitative, for the entire disuse of cadences and flourishes,\r\nhe is looking to Opera to be the highest form of music, as he looked\r\nto the historical drama to be the highest form of poetry. Apparently\r\nhe wished to wed them, and looked for the day, when great poets would\r\nwrite librettos for great composers.\r\n\r\nMazzini's criticism of music is for its time so fresh, so full of\r\nsuggestion and prophecy, that it is matter for regret that his\r\nknowledge of it was not more extensive. He knew opera and little\r\nbeyond it; he had some acquaintance with Beethoven, but he does not\r\nseem to have been very strongly attracted by him, or to have made much\r\nstudy of him. He wasted on Donizetti and Meyerbeer the enthusiasm,\r\nwhich should have been reserved for greater men. It is unfortunate\r\nthat he lived before Wagnerian opera appeared in London. It would be\r\npossible to show in detail to what a remarkable extent he anticipated\r\nWagner's theories.[46] Wagner, it is true, rejected the historical\r\ndrama, because he believed the requirements of art to be incompatible\r\nwith historical accuracy. But his main doctrines are the same as\r\nMazzini's,--the ethical intention of music, the intimate relationship\r\nof art to public life, the belief in the people as the fountain of\r\ntrue art, the value of the folk-song, the reconciliation of harmony\r\nand melody, the poet and musician stretching hands to one another and\r\ngiving 'moral will' to music, by uniting 'word' to 'tone' in Opera. It\r\nis permitted to think that, Wagner's nationality notwithstanding,\r\nMazzini would have recognised in him the master of the new music,\r\nwhose dawn he heralded.\r\n\r\nMazzini had a favourite classification of poets into \"objective\" and\r\n\"subjective.\" The objective artist sinks his own beliefs, and merely\r\nreflects and transmits external impressions, neither judging them by\r\nhis own conception of right and wrong, nor supplying any inspiration\r\nor rule of action for mankind. The subjective artist stamps his themes\r\nwith the imprint of his own individuality; he sits in the seat of\r\njudgment and measures out praise and blame; and thus he helps others\r\nto form a moral law, and creates the future. The former series, men\r\nwho excite our admiration but not our love, passes from the Greek\r\npoets, all save one, through Shakespeare to Goethe; the latter from\r\nAeschylus through Dante and Michelangelo to Byron and, apparently,\r\nSchiller. Dante was Mazzini's highest type of the subjective poet.\r\nSomething has already been said of his influence on Mazzini's\r\nthought,--an influence far greater than that of any other writer.\r\nThere are few, indeed, of Mazzini's doctrines, which are not found in\r\ngerm in the _Convito_ or the _De Monarchiâ_. Mazzini revered him as\r\nthe strong intellect, which took so little from other men and gave so\r\nmuch; the hero, whose life was one long fight, who \"wrote for country,\r\nconspired for country, held the pen and sword\"; the patriot, \"neither\r\nCatholic nor Ghibelline nor Guelf, but Christian and Italian,\" who\r\nbelieved in 'the holy Roman people,' and foretold for Italy the\r\nspiritual mastery of the world; the thinker who taught the unity and\r\ncommon task of all mankind; the one true poet of love, to whom the\r\nlove of man and woman was a spiritual thing, wherein self entered not.\r\nHe contrasted him with Shakespeare \"the lord of individuality,\" the\r\nsupreme dramatist who created individuals as no man else has created\r\nthem, giving his creatures choice of good and evil, and pursuing the\r\nlesson of their fates, the choice once made, to the end; who in Hamlet\r\nhad of pure creative genius made a prophetic type, that belonged to\r\ntwo centuries after him, and had no contemporary original. But\r\nShakespeare was a man who took life as he found it, untouched by\r\nstrong moral sympathies, without sense of the race or glimpse of duty\r\nor looking to the future; therefore a cynic and a \"sceptic,\" obsessed\r\nby the feeling of life's nothingness, with no illuminating faith in\r\nman's predestined glory.\r\n\r\nMazzini's favourite contrast was between Goethe and Byron. For\r\nGoethe's intellect he had the profoundest admiration; he seems to have\r\nstudied Faust carefully, and had some acquaintance at all events with\r\nhis other works. \"Goethe,\" he says, \"is an intellect, that receives,\r\nelaborates, and reproduces every possible form of human emotion and\r\naspiration. He dwells aloft, alone, a mighty Watcher in the midst of\r\ncreation, scrutinizing with equal penetration and interest the depths\r\nof ocean and the calyx of the flower, ... laying bare in Faust the\r\nproblem of the age in all its terrible nakedness, ... the most\r\nrepresentative poet that Europe has produced since Shakespeare.\" But\r\ngreat intellect as he is, he misses the highest; for he loses the man\r\nin the artist, he has no moral standard of his own, no sense of the\r\nunity of life; he is the poet of detail and analysis, \"feeling\r\neverything but never feeling the whole,\" living aloof from religion\r\nand politics, a cold spectator of the world-moving deeds around him,\r\n\"learning neither to esteem men nor to better them, nor even to suffer\r\nwith them,\" \"without need of doing or sacred sorrow or any deep and\r\nardent love.\" \"The poet of the bourgeoisie, he counsels calm and\r\ncontemplation, order and resignation, tells men to fit themselves to\r\ntheir environment, fulfil their little duties, plant themselves\r\ncomfortably, do good around them, always provided that the risks are\r\nnot too great, and that they do not disturb the harmony and balance of\r\nthe faculties of _sight_.\"\r\n\r\nTurn from Goethe, he says, to Byron; \"there is the man himself, who\r\nhopes and strives and suffers for the race, as Dante did, and as\r\nAeschylus did before Dante.\" Like Goethe, he too is \"a poet of\r\nindividuality,\" \"a type of power without an aim\"; but, unlike\r\nGoethe's, his verse is no mere reflection of other men's thoughts and\r\nactions. He stamps his portraitures with his own personality,\r\nsurveying the world \"from a single, comprehensive point of view,\" and\r\ninterpreting and judging it by his own inner light; more deep, as\r\nGoethe is more vast, seeking the sublime rather than the beautiful,\r\never a worshipper of force and action. \"In Byron the _ego_ is revealed\r\nin all its pride of power, freedom, and desire, in the uncontrolled\r\nplenitude of all its faculties, aspiring to rule the world around him\r\nsolely for dominion's sake, to exercise upon it the Titanic force of\r\nhis will.\" It is this power of will, necessarily propelled to seek an\r\noutlet in action, that appealed so strongly to Mazzini. Byron bears\r\nhis part in the political and social conflicts round him, \"wandering\r\nthrough the world, sad, gloomy, and unquiet, wounded and bearing the\r\narrow in his wound\"; loving and understanding Italy and Rome, dying\r\nfor a nation's cause in Greece. And Mazzini found in his verse a great\r\nsocial lesson, such as Goethe never tried to teach. Consciously or\r\nunconsciously Byron foretold the doom of individualism and\r\naristocracy. His characters are moulded on \"a single type--the\r\nindividual; free, but nothing more than free; iron souls in iron\r\nframes, who climb the alps of the physical world as well as the alps\r\nof thought\"; but all bearing in their faces the stamp of failure, \"a\r\ngloomy and ineffaceable sadness.\" \"Gifted with a liberty they knew not\r\nhow to use; with a power and energy they knew not how to apply; with a\r\nlife, whose purpose and aim they comprehend not;--they drag through\r\ntheir useless and convulsed existences. Byron destroys them one after\r\nthe other. The emptiness of the life and death of solitary\r\nindividuality has never been summed up so powerfully as in his pages.\"\r\n\r\nBut Byron, no more than Goethe, wrote the poetry of Mazzini's ideal.\r\nIn a generation without religion or pity or enthusiasm, amid \"English\r\ncant and French levity and Italian stagnation,\" Byron was driven to\r\npassionate, tumultuous cursings of a false society. But it was a note\r\nof rebellion and despair. Neither poet had the sense of the race, of\r\nman redeemed by love and social service, of the new hope and power\r\nthat would come, as men learned to work together for the common end.\r\nMazzini gives no indication that he ever found the art that he looked\r\nfor. He seems to have thought that some of the modern Slav poetry came\r\nnearest to it. The new English literature does not appear to have\r\nattracted him; there is no evidence that he read Browning, and if he\r\nhad, he would probably have condemned him as \"objective.\" Historical\r\ndrama has conspicuously failed to do what he expected of it. The\r\npoetry of social problems is still for the most part analytic and\r\ndestructive. The poet of his vision, the constructive, prophetic,\r\napostolic poet, with his message for humanity, whose songs will reach\r\nthe workshop and the cottage and inspire a nation's policy, is yet to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] _Cf._ Richard Wagner's Prose Works (Eng. trans.), pp. 122-123.\r\n\r\n[46] Mazzini's _Philosophy of Music_ was written in 1836; Wagner's\r\n_Artwork of the Future_ in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nThe Man\r\n\r\n     Poetic temperament--Defects as a thinker--Greatness as a\r\n     moral teacher--Strength and weakness as a politician--The\r\n     man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlyle said that Mazzini was \"by nature a little lyrical poet.\" The\r\nimplication was contemptuous, but it had a bottom of truth. Mazzini,\r\nindeed, save for his early aspirations to the drama, never dreamed of\r\nbeing a poet. His conception of the poet's function was so high, the\r\nqualities he demanded of him so exacting, that, if he ever felt the\r\ncall, he put it away, no doubt, as something to which he could not\r\nreach. It is doubtful even whether he wrote more than one poem when a\r\nyouth. He aspired only to be critic, to do something to prepare the\r\nway for the poet of the future. But he had qualities, that would have\r\nmade of him a poet of no mean order. There are many passages in his\r\nwritings, which show his deep communion with nature. When he writes of\r\n\"the vast ocean, dashing, like a wave of eternal poetry, against the\r\nbarren rocks of Brittany,\" or describes a sunrise from the Alps,--\"the\r\nfirst ray of light trembling on the horizon, vague and pale, like a\r\ntimid, uncertain hope; then the long line of fire cutting the blue\r\nheaven, firm and decided as a promise,\"--truly the consecration and\r\nthe poet's dream are his. His critical essays prove with what\r\nspiritual insight he would have touched the poetry of man and society.\r\nWe have seen how marvellous for an outsider was his presentiment of\r\nthe future of music. And his whole intellectual make, alike in\r\nstrength and weakness, is that of the artist,--of the artist, that is,\r\nas he conceived him, God's messenger to the heart of man. He had\r\nlittle power of scientific thought, of accurate reasoning or careful\r\narrangement and analysis of facts. It led to a curious misconception\r\nof scientific method. \"Science,\" he says,--\"the true, great, fruitful\r\nscience,--is as much intuition as experiment.\" He generalises with a\r\nhazardous confidence. Sometimes he uses words, that are no more than\r\nwords, to push difficulties into a corner and stand in front of them.\r\nIn spite of his allegiance to \"tradition,\" he generally prefers\r\ndeductive to inductive reasoning. \"Principles prevail over facts,\" as\r\nhe says; but he often does not see, in spite of his own cautions, how,\r\nwithout a supreme respect for facts, a principle may hang not on the\r\neternal truths, but on the fancy of a solitary brain. His own\r\nscientific studies were small; save for some acquaintance with\r\nastronomy and geography,--the former to feed his sense of the\r\ninfinite, the latter for its relationship to nationality,--he seems to\r\nhave given no attention to any branch of science. He accepted without\r\nquestion the Genesis story of the creation of man. At a time when\r\nDarwinism was bringing a sword into the intellectual world, he lived\r\napparently uninterested and untouched by it.\r\n\r\nThe same defect of method appears in his other studies. Keen as was\r\nhis interest in social questions, he evidently had no grasp of\r\neconomic science; beyond Adam Smith, it is doubtful whether he read\r\nany of the great economists, and at a later date he entirely failed\r\nto understand the economic side of Karl Marx. His theories of history,\r\nagain, so subordinate everything to his desire to make it didactic,\r\nthat he regarded research and accuracy as comparatively unimportant.\r\nHe thought,--rash man,--that facts had already been accumulated in\r\nsufficient abundance and certainty. Greatly indeed he conceived the\r\nhistorian's ultimate function--to discover the laws of human progress,\r\nand be \"prophet of a higher social end\"; but he slurred over the\r\ndifficulty of reading facts aright, and was ever prone to let fancy\r\ntake their place. He would have made the historian's method deductive\r\nto a dangerous degree, and had him fill the gaps of history from an\r\nabstract study of human nature; he apparently approved the Thucydidean\r\nmethod of invented speeches.\r\n\r\nHere and everywhere he was apt to look down on erudition. He believed\r\nthat Genius,--a kind of mystic, God-inspired faculty, that lived on\r\nintuition and not on painfully acquired knowledge,--discovers at a\r\nglance the secrets of nature and ethics and history. \"Where we see\r\nonly the confused light of the Milky Way, they see stars.\" Though he\r\nwould have himself disclaimed the title to genius, he had a supreme\r\nconfidence in his own thought. It was difficult for him to own an\r\nerror, and hence he never learnt from his mistakes. It was true of\r\nhim, as Renan said of Lamennais, that \"when a man believes that he\r\npossesses all truth, he naturally disdains the painful, humble path of\r\nresearch, and regards the investigation of details as a pure\r\ndilettante fancy.\" This was no doubt the chief cause why his mind so\r\nsoon stopped growing. We find in his early writings, when he was\r\ntwenty-seven or twenty-eight, the germ, and generally the developed\r\nform of every doctrine that he preached. His character developed\r\nnormally, but not his intellect. Religion, ethics, politics, social\r\ntheories, literary canons,--all issued forth at once from his\r\nearly-ripened brain, and fixed themselves once for all. He was always\r\nreluctant to enquire for or admit new knowledge. It is strange, lover\r\nof books though he was, how restricted sometimes was his range of\r\nreading. His poets were the poets of his youth and early manhood, and\r\nhe read few that wrote after 1840. Closely as he studied the Gospels,\r\nhe seems to have given little or no attention to exegesis. In spite of\r\nhis keen interest in Utilitarianism, there is no trace that he read\r\nthe later writers of the school. Though so long in intimate touch with\r\nEnglish political thought, he does not seem to have known Burke or\r\nRicardo or the Mills or Herbert Spencer.\r\n\r\nAs a thinker, therefore, his defects are great. His thought, indeed,\r\nalways has its value, coming as it does from a man of very great\r\nintellectual power and large experience of life, one who fearlessly\r\npenetrated to the heart of things, and was therefore in the true sense\r\noriginal. Its range is wonderful for one who led so strenuous a life\r\nof action. Faulty as his argument often is, obvious as are the gaps,\r\nhe wrote comparatively few pages, that are not stamped with great and\r\nstimulating thought. But his mind was too loosely organised, too often\r\nout of touch with contemporary knowledge. He has left an imposing and\r\nsuggestive system, and yet perhaps it somehow fails to add greatly to\r\nthe sum of human knowledge. But it is just the qualities, that\r\ndepreciate him as a thinker, which make him great as a moral teacher.\r\nHis want of logic, his loose use of words hurt not here. The involved\r\nand rushing language, like a tumbling mountain stream, becomes a\r\nstrength. That very rigidity, that lifelong iteration of a few\r\ndominant ideas, carry force and conviction, that a more agile\r\nintellect were powerless to give. His warm and palpitating\r\ngeneralisations, for all the flaws in their reasoning, bear the\r\nirrefutable mark of moral reality. He had that union of real\r\nintellectual force and spiritual fervour, that gives the insight into\r\nmoral truth, and learns the secrets of heaven and hell. He was able to\r\nbe a great moralist, because in a rare degree he had himself the moral\r\nsense, because the passion for righteousness had so penetrated all his\r\nbeing, that he could speak and be understood on the deep things of\r\nGod, had something in his own soul that found its way to other souls.\r\nAnd, above all, he spoke with authority. Absolute confidence in his\r\nown beliefs was joined to truest personal humility, and made the\r\nprophet. Humblest and least ambitious of men, he felt his call from\r\nGod; and in God's name he was assertive, dogmatic, sometimes seemingly\r\negotistic. If he spoke authoritatively and intolerantly, it was that a\r\nduty was laid upon him, and woe to him if he preached it not. His\r\nprinciples were living and victorious certainties to him. \"If a\r\nprinciple is true,\" he said, \"its applications are not only possible\r\nbut inevitable.\" And this unquestioning conviction made him as\r\nfearless morally as he was intellectually,--fearless with the supreme\r\nbravery of one who never shrinks from duty,--fearless not only for\r\nhimself but others, bridling all the impulsive tenderness within him,\r\nand requiring of his fellow-workers the same readiness for sacrifice,\r\nwhich he exacted of himself. And so his words, aflame from a pure and\r\npassionate heart, come with the intensity of prophetic power. Beyond\r\nthe words of any other man of modern times, they bring counsel and\r\ncomfort to those who have drunk of the misery and stir and hope of the\r\nage. They have the greater virtue, that impels their hearers to do\r\nlikewise. Mazzini is one of the small band, who have the strength as\r\nwell as the love of Christ, not only the unselfishness that draws, but\r\nthe conviction and the power that command, who impose their own\r\nbeliefs and make disciples.\r\n\r\nWould he, had he had the opportunity, have done what he held higher\r\nthan to teach through books, and been the missionary of a religion?\r\nHad Italy been freed in 1848, we may be sure he would have left his\r\ndesk, forsaken politics, and gone about the land, preaching faith in\r\nGod and Progress and Humanity. Probably no other man, since the\r\nReformation, has had such apostolic power. Would his mission have\r\nfound an answer or ended in pitiable collapse? He would probably have\r\nhad no better fate than others, who have tried to found new churches.\r\nThere may be room for new faiths, but there is little for new churches\r\nin the world to-day. But this does not necessarily mean failure. His\r\nchurch might have been empty, his state religion proved a soulless\r\nhusk; but in the communion of scattered men and women, who are groping\r\nfor the truth, he might have laid a cornerstone of that church, which\r\nis neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem, which without forms\r\nor unity of doctrine, spreads the unity of spiritual truth.\r\nSomething, even as it is, he has done for this. His creed may fail to\r\ncontent the knowledge of to-day, but he stands a convincing witness to\r\nthe spiritual, to the eternal needs of the soul, to religion as the\r\nmaster fact of life, though creeds may fail and systems perish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow does he rank as a politician? Our estimate must be a mixed one. As\r\na political thinker he stands high. He has left a theory of the state,\r\nthat is priceless because informed by a great moral ideal. And apart\r\nfrom this, it has its value from his wide and profound knowledge of\r\nmodern politics and the practical sense that almost always keeps his\r\nidealism in touch with facts. His faith in democracy, the optimism\r\nwhich came of his trust in Providence, his cautious handling of\r\neconomic tendencies saved him from the mistakes of Carlyle and Ruskin.\r\nHis conviction that the common-sense of the people was feeling out its\r\nway independently of any theory or school, kept him from the\r\nshort-lived formulas of the individualists. His deeper knowledge of\r\nmen and deeper reading of history gave him a saner and completer view\r\nthan that of the collectivists. None of them, not even Ruskin, can\r\nmatch the warmth and inspiration of a conception, that raises politics\r\nto be the instrument of the divine plan,--an instrument not only to\r\ndestroy injustice and poverty, but to redeem the highest part of man\r\nand bring the rule of brotherhood and unity and social peace. In the\r\ndetailed application of his political doctrines he often failed from\r\nthat same inaccessibility to facts, which marred him otherwise. His\r\nrepublic missed the essential; his theories of democratic government\r\nare vague and hardly satisfy. But even here he is the prophet of one\r\ngreat enduring principle. Among the statesmen of the century, he is\r\nalmost the only one, who understood what nationality meant, saw its\r\nessential relationship to democracy, and put it on an unassailable\r\nfoundation. It was this that made him teacher of Italian Unity, and\r\ntherefore maker of modern Italy. Whether without him Italy would be\r\nunited to-day, we cannot tell; but at all events it was he who gave\r\nthe impulse, his bold vision that saw that the hard consummation was\r\nattainable, and gave others too the faith to see it.\r\n\r\nAs a political thinker, then, he is great; as a practical political\r\nworker, he largely failed. True, he had many of a statesman's\r\nqualities. He often read character acutely, though his confidence in\r\nmen sometimes deceived him, and again and again he was the victim of\r\ninformers. He had rare industry and considerable organising power;\r\nthough, owing to his solitary work, he had learned to bury himself too\r\nmuch in details,--in the mass of correspondence and the immense labour\r\nhe put out to scrape together little funds,--and in them he sometimes\r\nneglected the survey of the whole. Above all, as he proved at Rome, he\r\nhad the true statesman's gift of leadership and inspiration. But it is\r\nmore than doubtful whether, even under happier circumstances, he would\r\nhave been an effective politician. His knowledge of human nature was\r\nmore subtle in the abstract than in the concrete; individuals were to\r\nhim too much wholly good or wholly bad, and he did not recognise how\r\ncomplex are the motives that sway puzzled humanity. He could rarely\r\ntake a sane, unprejudiced view of a situation. It amazes us that he\r\nexpected Pio Nono to respond to his appeal in 1847, and thought that,\r\nif the republic came at Rome in 1870, it would found a state religion.\r\nHis misconception of Piedmontese policy throughout the fifties is a\r\nyet stronger illustration of distorted vision. This was one of the\r\nreasons why he found it so difficult to compromise. He could not\r\ndistinguish non-essentials from essentials, and it was nearly as hard\r\nfor him to give way on the one as on the other. Compromise in small or\r\ngreat seemed cowardice, and there was no doubt a strain of egotism in\r\nhis obstinacy. It humiliated him to surrender any detail of the\r\ntheories, which he preached with such undiscriminating confidence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut one would fain close not with the thinker or the moral teacher or\r\nthe politician, but the man. Mazzini's personal life was one of a very\r\nrare purity and beauty, that stands out in his generation noblest and\r\nfaithfullest and most inspired. Its only serious flaw lies in those\r\nfew lapses from public candour, which have been noted in these pages.\r\nSometimes he was bitter and intolerant, but the provocation was great.\r\nIn earlier life he was often querulous and self-absorbed, but it may\r\nbe counted to him, that, with his sensitive nature, he came through\r\nloneliness and poverty with his moral strength unbroken. Except for\r\nthese, the critic's microscope can find no specks. Brave, earnest,\r\ntrue, without trace of affectation, he bore the stamp of whitest\r\nsincerity. Gentle, affectionate, pure as few are pure, he was friend\r\nand counsellor and inspirer to those who knew him, gripping and\r\nsubduing them with that wondrous sympathy of his, that came of\r\nburning love of goodness and made the saving of a soul the highest\r\nthing in life. That generosity, which made him share purse and clothes\r\nwith others perhaps less destitute than himself, and give half his\r\nscanty income to help a woman and children that he hardly knew, made\r\nhim lavish out of his busy days time and thought to help struggling\r\nsouls. Ever intense in his affections, grateful for any act of\r\nkindness, yearning for friendship with the yearning of the homeless\r\nman, he was one to draw others with bonds of love.\r\n\r\nHe had a large and loving view of life. Pettiness and malice and\r\njealousy had very little place in it. Passionate though he was for\r\nmorality, he was, outside his political work and controversies and an\r\noccasional touch of cynicism in his talk, a very tolerant man. No\r\nperson has, he said, \"a right to judge a special case without positive\r\ndata on the nature of the fact.\" He was angry and impatient with the\r\n\"cavilling spirit of mediocrity,\" that takes pleasure in the lapses of\r\n\"the mighty-souled.\" Among his friends he never sermonised, and he had\r\nno desire to bend their private life to his own pattern. Ever more or\r\nless sad himself, he rejoiced in their happiness. \"You are a happy\r\nmortal,\" he writes to one of them on his marriage. \"I am,\r\nnotwithstanding my dislike for _happiness_, truly glad that you are\r\nso.\" Never man had more joy in others' home felicity. It was only\r\namong his fellow-revolutionists, whom he thought of as partners in his\r\nown high call, that he was exacting and sometimes ungenerous, though\r\nhe pleaded earnestly with them that public work should leave room for\r\nthe inner life of love and friendship. In his political controversies,\r\nit must be confessed, his equanimity deserted him, and he is often\r\nintolerant and unfair. He was too ready to think that bad politics\r\nimplied bad morals, and his hatred of Louis Napoleon and Cavour made\r\nhim pen pages, that one would gladly not remember. But even in\r\npolitics he could sometimes do justice to an opponent, who obviously\r\nacted from high convictions; and he was one of the few Italian\r\nnationalists, who could appreciate the motives of the Catholic\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nBut his essential greatness lies on the active side. Above all else he\r\nshines out white in that consuming love of humanity, that accepted\r\npoverty and weariness and danger, that made him forego home and love,\r\ncomfort and congenial work, and give himself to one long,\r\nself-forgetting service for the good of men. Duty was no abstract\r\nprecept with him, but part of his very being. In adversity and trial\r\nhe had schooled himself to follow her, till disobedience to her call\r\nbecame almost impossible, and he did not wait for her to speak but\r\nsought her out. It was nearly allied to his almost superstitious fear\r\nof personal happiness. Those miserable years in Switzerland and London\r\nwrought on him, till melancholy grew to a habit. He lost something of\r\nit afterwards in the society of his English friends, but it never left\r\nhim; and it tinted all his life with the gentle sadness, which is near\r\nakin to spiritual yearnings and large-hearted love. Sunless and\r\nunwholesome as it seems at times, after all, as with the Man of\r\nsorrows, it purged him to the same forgetfulness of self. It was no\r\nenervating grief; \"do not allow yourself to be weakened and\r\nself-absorbed by your trouble\" was his perennial lesson to friends,\r\nwho had lost dear ones. His was the \"other part of grief, the noble\r\npart, which makes the soul great and lifts it up.\" \"By dint of\r\nrepeating to myself,\" he once wrote to Mrs Carlyle, \"that there is no\r\nhappiness under the moon, that life is a self-sacrifice meant for\r\nsome higher and happier thing; that to have a few loving beings, or if\r\nnone, to have a mother watching you from Italy or from Heaven (it is\r\nall the same) ought to be quite enough to preserve us from falling.\"\r\nHe, to a degree that few have done, trod self victoriously under;\r\nhabitually and systematically year by year, untempted by failure or\r\nsuccess, by misery or comparative happiness, he denied himself even\r\nthe little indulgences and relaxations and declensions from the strait\r\nhard path, by which most good men make their compromise with the world\r\nand flesh. So remorselessly was duty law to him, that sometimes work\r\nand sacrifice became ends in themselves; and he laboured painfully on\r\nin the path which he had chosen, when it would have served his cause\r\nbetter to have rested or turned to other activities. And the unbending\r\nlabour had its fruit in that wonderful sum of his life's work, that,\r\nbeyond all the exacting details of his political organisation, has\r\nleft its stamp on modern Europe, has left so vast a body of thought in\r\nhalf the provinces of the human mind, has its yet richer legacy in the\r\nexample of a life given perfectly and wholly to the cause of men.\r\n\r\nHe was not the mere conscientious worker only; he lived in the light\r\nof a spiritual vision, and that light radiated in almost every page he\r\nwrote, on every man and woman whom he touched. Besides the sense of\r\nduty he had faith. \"He was,\" writes a living English statesman,\r\n\"perhaps the most impressive person I have ever seen, with a fiery\r\nintensity of faith in his own principles and in their ultimate\r\ntriumph, which made him seem inspired; a man to waken sleeping souls,\r\nand fill them with his own fervour.\" He loved to commune with those of\r\nhis own spiritual kin,--Dante, Savonarola, Cromwell,--men who had the\r\nsame undoubting faith in the righteousness of their cause and their\r\nfellow-work with God,--men, it may be, one-sided and intellectually\r\nincomplete, but gifted with the power to do great things and lift up\r\nlife. And so great principles and nobleness of aim carried him through\r\na series of practical mistakes, and left his life to be a permanent\r\nenriching of the race. What if he dreamed dreams, that for generations\r\nyet may be no more than dreams? What if his mental ken reached not to\r\nall the knowledge of the age? What if he marred his work by mistakes\r\nand miscalculations? His errors have passed; his intellectual\r\nlimitations can be supplied. His was the rarer and the greater part,\r\nto lift men out of the low air of common life up to the heights, where\r\nthought is larger, and life runs richer, and the great verities are\r\nseen, undimmed by self and sophistry. The idealist is still mankind's\r\nbest friend; and he does most for the race, who purges its spiritual\r\nvision, and breathes into cold duty, till it becomes a thing of life\r\nand passion and power. Greater still is he, who is not idealist only,\r\nbut saint and hero, and in his life bears witness to the truth he\r\nteaches. Such saint and hero and idealist Mazzini was; and while men\r\nand women live, who would be true to themselves and to their call, who\r\nvalue sacrifice and duty above power and success, so long will there\r\nbe those, who will love him and be taught by him.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FACSIMILE OF MAZZINI'S HANDWRITING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix A\r\n\r\n     SOME UNPUBLISHED (IN ONE CASE PRIVATELY PUBLISHED) LETTERS\r\n     AND PAPERS, WRITTEN BY MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. _Letter to Mr W.

HICKSON, EDITOR OF THE _Westminster Review_\r\n(probably in 1844).\r\n\r\n     [This letter gives some details concerning his early life,\r\n     which are not mentioned in his works or in any of the\r\n     biographies.]\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I began to attract the attention of the Government in Italy\r\nby my literary writings. I had been pleading warmly the cause of what\r\nwas then called Romanticism, and was the right of progressive life in\r\nLiterature. Then, as now, all pleading for literary liberty,\r\nindependence, progression, were suspected in Italy as educating the\r\nmind to forbidden tendencies. I published in 1828 a weekly literary\r\npaper the \"Indicatore Genovese\": it was, at the end of the year, and\r\nthough published under the double ecclesiastical and temporal\r\ncensorship, suppressed. I caused the paper to be continued at Leghorn\r\nunder the title of \"Indicatore Livornese\";[47] it was, at the end of\r\nthe year, suppressed again. I wrote one long article on \"a European\r\nLiterature\" in the best of our reviews, the \"Antologia\" of Florence.\r\nThe review was persecuted and after some time suppressed. In 1830,\r\nafter the Revolution of July I was arrested. The accusation was the\r\nspreading of a secret association tending to the overthrow of the\r\nItalian Government. I recollect a fact, well apt to give a summary of\r\nour condition in Italy. My father, Professor of Anatomy in the Genoese\r\nUniversity, went to the Governor of the town, Venanson, enquiring at\r\nthe cause of my imprisonment. \"Your son,\" he was told amongst other\r\nthings, \"is fond of walking every night, alone, sadly pensive, on the\r\noutskirts of the town. What on earth has he at his age to think about?\r\nWe don't like young people thinking, without our knowing the subject\r\nof their thoughts.\" A committee of Senators was appointed, in Turin,\r\nto try me. They found no proofs, and acquitted both me and some\r\nfriends who had been arrested with me. Nevertheless I was sent, in\r\nsolitary confinement, at Savona, in the fortress for five months: and\r\nafterwards, sent in exile, without leave of seeing anybody, except my\r\nparents. There was no duration determined; but I was told that my\r\nsubsequent conduct would shorten or prolong the time of my being an\r\nexile. I came through Savoy and Switzerland to France, at a time in\r\nwhich the Government of Louis Philippe, not yet acknowledged by the\r\nabsolutist Governments, was active in exciting all insurrectional\r\nschemes, both in Spain and Italy. I merged, of course into them.\r\n\r\nWhen the insurrection of 1831 was quenched in the Estates of the Pope,\r\nI established myself at Marseilles, and founded from there the new\r\nassociation \"la giovine Italia.\" Of the distinctions to be made\r\nbetween this and the old Carbonari associations, I have spoken in four\r\nletters that have been printed in the \"Monthly Chronicle.\" They--the\r\nfourth especially--I would advise you to peruse: I have not a single\r\ncopy in my possession and cannot even remember the number; but they\r\nmust have appeared between 1838 and 1839. The rapidity with which the\r\nAssociation spread evinced the justice of the fundamental views. At\r\nthe beginning of 1832, the organisation was powerful throughout all\r\nItaly. As one of the main features of La Giovine Italia was to not\r\ncontent itself as Carbonarism did, with a secret war, but to reach\r\ninsurrection through the open preaching of its belief, an organ was\r\nestablished at Marseilles expounding all the principles of the\r\nAssociation. La Giovine Italia, a review, or rather a collection of\r\npolitical pamphlets springing from the Association, was under my\r\ndirection; and, in fact, the two-thirds of each volume were my own.\r\nThe effect was really electric among our youth. From Marseilles,\r\nthrough the merchant-ships of our country, the captains of which were\r\nalmost generally volunteering their efforts, the volumes were smuggled\r\ninto Italy, where they raised the enthusiasm of the patriots to such a\r\npitch that it was evident a general outbreak would ensue. Then, the\r\npersecutions began. Applications were made by all the Italian\r\nGovernments to the French: the policy of Louis Philippe had already\r\nchanged, and the most active co-operation against the Association and\r\nme was promised. Measures were taken at Marseilles against such of our\r\nexiles as were living upon the _subsidies_. They were sent away to the\r\ninterior. But few as we were, we could, by multiplying our activity,\r\nfront the task. At last, under the pretence of my being likely to be\r\nconnected with the republican agitation in France, I was ordered to\r\nleave France. I protested, and claimed the common justice of a trial;\r\nbut unsuccessfully. My presence at Marseilles was imperiously required\r\nby the interests of the Association; the writing, publishing, and\r\nsending to Italy the correspondencies with the country, for which\r\nMarseilles was offering every facility, the interviews with Italian\r\npatriots who flocked to Marseilles for instructions and\r\ncommunications, were all resting on me. I decided to stop; and\r\nconcealed myself. During one year I succeeded in baffling all the\r\nactivity of the French police, and of our own spies. But it was\r\nthrough the most rigorous seclusion you can imagine. During one year,\r\nI remember having had only twice, a breath of fresh air in the night,\r\nonce dressed in woman's garb, the other as a Garde-National. At last\r\nthings had reached such a point that a general rising was thought of.\r\nI left France and went to Geneva: there to await for the event, and\r\nprepare an expedition into Savoy, so as to divide the forces of the\r\nenemy and establish co-operation between the patriots in Italy and\r\ntheir exiles. How the hopes of an insurrection failed in Italy, the\r\nfourth of my letters in the \"Monthly Chronicle\" will tell you. How we\r\ntoo failed, through our military leader, General Ramorino, in the\r\nattempt on Savoy--an attempt I thought it our duty to realise, as a\r\npractical teaching to our countrymen, that promises, once given, are\r\nto be kept,--would now be too long to say. But a tolerably true\r\naccount of the enterprise is to be found in one of the volumes of\r\n\"Histoire de Dix Ans\" _par_ Louis Blanc. Meanwhile the attempt, once\r\nunsuccessful, drew upon Switzerland and _à fortiori_ upon me, the\r\nanger of all Governments. Notes were literally showering upon the poor\r\nSwiss Cantons, where we sojourned. The most of us left Switzerland for\r\nFrance or England. I with few others remained. Driven away from\r\nGeneva, I went to the Canton de Vaud: driven away from there, to\r\nBerne. There, owing to the friendship of some of the members of the\r\nGovernment, I stopped for some time, keeping a very secluded life. At\r\nlast the insistence of the foreign Embassies prevailed upon the\r\nweakness of the Bernese Government, and I was obliged to go to\r\nSolothurn. Meanwhile the principles, embodied in our writings and in\r\nour associations had awakened the sympathies of the Swiss patriots. A\r\nNational Association was founded on a ground of brotherhood with our\r\nown. The persecutions with which the unwilling but weak Swiss\r\nGovernments were hunting me, excited almost as much indignation as the\r\nopening of the letters here. The weakness of the Cantons had its\r\nsource in the deficiency of national unity, in the detestable\r\norganisation of the Central Power, on the old _Pacte Federal_, forced\r\nby the Allies on Switzerland at the overthrow of Napoleon. I was\r\nrequested to write a periodical advocating and unifying under our\r\npolitical belief, the national feelings. Funds were given. The \"Jeune\r\nSuisse\" was established. It appeared twice a week in French and in\r\nGerman, for the course of one year. Through the German exiles, and\r\nworking-men, through the Tyrolese working-men, rather numerous in the\r\nCanton of Zürich, through the Italian Tessin, and the frequent contact\r\nwith Italian people travelling to the frontier, the spirit of liberty\r\nbegan to spread again in the countries approaching Switzerland. The\r\nterrors of the Governments re-excited the persecution. They threatened\r\nSwitzerland with war. German troops came to the frontier, M. Thiers\r\nwas menacing to ruin Swiss commercial resources with a \"blocus\r\nhermetique.\" We were sent away. The paper suppressed; the most\r\nhorrible calumnies spread against us: all exiles left with or without\r\ncompulsion. I decided to remain as long as necessary to prove to the\r\nSwiss people, that they were the slaves of the Foreign Powers, and\r\ndevoid of all real liberty, of all independence. During seven months,\r\nI went from place to place, from house to house, living in places\r\napparently empty, with mats at the windows, without even going beyond\r\nthe room, except when receiving advices of the house being suspected:\r\nthen with a guide, I was crossing the mountains in the night, and\r\ngoing to another shelter. While the Governments were raging, I\r\nreceived from all classes of population marks of sympathy that made\r\nand still make me consider Switzerland as a second Fatherland.\r\nMinisters [of religion] were inviting me to their houses as one of\r\ntheir family. [At] Grenchen, a village of a thousand inhabitants, near\r\nSolothurn, when I had spent one year, in an establishment of baths, I\r\nwas, during the storm, made citizen spontaneously and without expense.\r\nThe poor people, good souls of the village, believed that as a Swiss\r\ncitizen, I would be respected; the grant of course, was not admitted.\r\nStill had I been alone, I would have, hardened as I was to all\r\nprivations, kept on resisting; [but I was not alone] so I decided to\r\nleave and come to England. It was then that I had a correspondence\r\nwith the Duke of Montebello, which ended in his sending three\r\npassports for us to a place I named; and in January or February 1837 I\r\nlanded in England.\r\n\r\nThe \"Giovine Italia\" had six volumes published at different times. All\r\nthat I have ever written concerning politics bears my name. Before I\r\nestablished the Association I wrote a long letter to Charles Albert,\r\nwho had just then come to reign over Piedmont, remembering him of what\r\nhe had promised and done, when not a king, pointing to him all the\r\ndangers of his position, the impossibility of keeping down long the\r\nspirit of the nation, the system of blood-shedding reaction to which\r\nhe would soon be bound, and on the other side, the Possible, the\r\nBeautiful, the Grand, the Godlike that there would be in his putting\r\nhimself at the head of the National party; the letter was printed, and\r\nsigned only \"An Italian.\" My name was then quite unknown, and would\r\nnot have added the least weight to the considerations; besides, I did\r\nnot believe that the \"Italian People\" would ever spring from under a\r\nroyal cloak; and I was writing, not my own opinion, but that of many\r\nof my countrymen still fond of such a hope. I wanted to have the true\r\nintentions of the man on whom they relied, as much as possible\r\nunveiled. As soon as the letter reached him, my \"signalement\" was\r\ngiven to all the authorities of the coast, so as to have me arrested\r\nif ever I attempted to cross the frontier again.... I have been in\r\n1833 condemned to be shot _in the back_ by a military commission\r\nsitting in Alessandria, as having led from without the agitation. Here\r\nin London I have exerted, as I will exert, what influence I possess\r\nwith my countrymen to endeavour to raise them from the nothingness and\r\nworse than nothingness in which now they are; from English affairs I\r\nhave kept myself entirely separated; nor sought the help of English\r\npeople even for our Italian affairs. As to all the present agitation,\r\nI had nothing to do with it, on the beginning. I did not think that\r\nthe time was properly chosen. But, when the patriots of the interior\r\n_decided_ that they _would_ attempt, nothing of course, was left to me\r\nthan helping them; and so I did, or rather prepared me to do so,\r\nshould a rising take place.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the right of an Italian to work out from whatever\r\nplace he finds himself in, the welfare of his country, ought to be\r\nclearly and boldly asserted by an English writer.\r\n\r\nOf the hopes I have of the Italian patriots succeeding at a not very\r\nremote period, in what they are now struggling for, I cannot now speak\r\nhere. It would prove too long a subject for a letter; but I am in\r\nintention, if I find time for it, of publishing very soon, a Pamphlet\r\non the question, showing how, all weary of slow, legal, national\r\nprogress being interdicted to us, our only hope must lie in\r\ninsurrection as the starting-point for a national education. If there\r\nare points upon which you want more notions, be so kind as to write,\r\nand meanwhile, with sincere thanks for the interest you take in my\r\ncase, believe me now dear Sir,--\r\n\r\n     Truly yours,\r\n     JOSEPH MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n     47 Devonshire Street,\r\n     Queen Square.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA PRAYER TO GOD FOR THE PLANTERS, BY AN EXILE.\r\n\r\n     [The original is in French. It has probably not been\r\n     published before. It was sent in 1846 to Mr William Shaen in\r\n     response to a request for a paper on the abolition of\r\n     slavery. It was to have appeared in Lady Blessington's\r\n     _Keepsake_, presumably in a translation, but was not\r\n     published in it. In sending it Mazzini writes: \"To write one\r\n     or two pages on abolitionism is just the same to me as to\r\n     prove that the sun gives light and warmth; or to prove an\r\n     axiom. So that I was during one full hour at a loss what to\r\n     write, till my soul melted away in prayer.\"]\r\n\r\nGod of pity, God of peace and love, forgive, oh forgive the planters.\r\nTheir sin is great; but thy mercy is infinite. As of old thou didst\r\nmake refreshing waters gush from the desert rock for the multitude of\r\nthy servants, so now make the living spring of charity gush out in the\r\ndesert of their souls. Let the angel of repentance descend and settle\r\non their dying pillow. And between them and thy justice, at their last\r\nhour,--for them and for their country, which they dishonour,--may the\r\nprayer rise up of all who suffer for thy holy cause, for thy holy\r\ntruth, for the freedom of the peoples and of the Soul of man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir sin is great. They have sinned, they are sinning still against\r\nthee and against Humanity, which is the interpreter of thy law on\r\nearth. The Spirit of Evil, which tempted Jesus, thy son so dear to\r\nGenius and to Love, by offering him, when he began his divine career,\r\nthe riches and the thrones of earth, has also tempted them, men bereft\r\nof Genius and of Love, by taking the semblance of the idol, which is\r\nself-interest. They have yielded. They are the bondsmen of the senses,\r\nand have forsworn knowledge and feeling. They have set the slave in\r\nthe place of man, the fetish of the sugar-cane in the place of thy\r\nholy image. But thou, didst thou not hear thy son, so dear to Genius\r\nand to Love, when he prayed for those who slew him? Forgive them,\r\nFather, forgive the planters too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThou hast placed, as symbol of the eye of thy Providence, one sun in\r\nheaven for the earth. Thou hast interwoven in one mighty harmony, of\r\nwhich human Music, Religion's eldest child, is but a faint and\r\nstammering echo, the worlds, those finite rays of thy infinite\r\nThought, that move around us, like the scattered letters of a heavenly\r\nalphabet, which we shall know one day. In this fair physical Universe,\r\nwhich is the garment of the Idea, thou hast everywhere taught Unity,\r\nand the bright light of thy teaching shines upon their souls; but they\r\nhave veiled the eyes of their souls, they have broken in pieces that\r\nwhich is so fair, and on the wreck of thy Unity they have built a\r\nwarring Dualism: two natures, two laws, two ways of life. Have pity,\r\nLord, forgive, oh forgive the planters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn History, which is thy life, manifesting itself progressively in\r\ntime and space, thou hast set in their sight another fount of truth,\r\nwhence in great waves flows the great thought of Unity, which is thy\r\nwhole Law. Thou madest all mankind spring from one Adam; at the\r\nteaching of thy providence, more clearly seen from day to day, thou\r\nhast led man, collective, social man, from slavery to serfdom, from\r\nserfdom to wage-earning; and that nought may be wanting to make the\r\nprogression clear, thou makest now the nations to desire impatiently\r\nthat to wage-earning association may succeed. And over these three\r\nstages, which are the image of thy triune working, hovers the holy\r\nvoice of Golgotha, _All ye are brothers, for ye are all one in God_.\r\nAnd they have stopped their ears to the holy voice of Golgotha, they\r\nhave shut their eyes to the evolution of Thought in History: they have\r\nsaid: _we are not brothers, we are masters and slaves_. They have\r\nkept one page alone of the Great Book, the page that tells of Cain and\r\nAbel, of Violence and Right; and they have said to themselves: _there\r\nare then two races of men, the race that is accursed, and the race\r\nthat is privileged, and of this last race are we_; they know not that\r\nthe sign of thy curse is on their own forehead, since it is by\r\nViolence alone that they make slaves of men. Have pity, Lord, forgive,\r\noh forgive the planters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd for the third witness of thy Truth, thou hast put a voice in each\r\nman's heart, an impulse in each man's conscience, which says: _I am\r\nfree; free because I am responsible, free because I am a man, made in\r\nGod's image, inherently possessing in myself the powers and\r\naspirations and destinies of all Humanity_. And they have denied that\r\nthis is the voice of all men. They have shut themselves up in their\r\nselfish _Ego_, and have said: _this voice is ours alone_, and they see\r\nnot, wretched men that they are, that if they put a bound to it, they\r\nblot it out from all creation, since God did not create the _planter_\r\nbut the _man_. They have sown hate, and they will reap revolt: they\r\nhave denied the God of love, and they have provoked the God of\r\nvengeance. Listen not to their blasphemy, O Lord. Forgive, oh forgive\r\nthe planters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO Lord, open their understandings and soften their hearts. Let the\r\nangel, that inspires good thoughts, descend upon them in their dreams\r\nby night. Let them hear through him the cry of horror that ascends\r\nfrom all Humanity that believes and loves;--the sorrowing cry of all\r\nwho endure and fight for the Good in Europe, and whose confidence and\r\nfaith is shaken by their stubborn crime;--the mocking cry of the\r\nprinces and kings of the earth, who, when their subjects are full of\r\nturmoil, point to the proud republicans of America, who alone of men\r\nmaintain the helotism of pagan ages;--the long anguish of Jesus, who,\r\nbecause of them, still suffers on his cross to-day! And when in the\r\nmorning they awake, let their children lay their innocent curly heads\r\nbeside their lips, and whisper, inspired by thee: \"Father, father,\r\nfree our brother, the black man; buy and sell no more the son of man\r\nfor thirty pennies; see, this black man too has a mother and little\r\nchildren like us; Oh that his old mother could rejoice to see him\r\nproud and free! that his children could smile on him, fresh and happy,\r\nin the morning, as we smile now on you, father.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGod of pity, God of peace and love, forgive, oh forgive the planters.\r\nTheir sin is great, but thy mercy is infinite. Open in the desert of\r\ntheir souls the living spring of charity. Let the angel of repentance\r\ndescend and settle on their dying pillow. And between them and thy\r\njustice, at their last hour,--for them and for their country, which\r\nthey dishonour,--may the prayer rise up of all, who, like myself,\r\nsuffer for thy holy cause, for thy holy truth, for the freedom of the\r\npeoples and of the Soul of man.\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MRS PETER TAYLOR [May 15, 1847].\r\n\r\nDEAR MRS TAYLOR,--First of all let me tell you that my silence before\r\nyour note has been owing to my having been most unpoetically ill, with\r\nhead-ache, sore throat, prostration of forces, fever and other things,\r\ntill I was thinking that Mr Taylor would perhaps get rid all at once\r\nof me and of the League: however Homoeopathy--that is taking\r\nnothing--has cured me: then that my silence after the note has been\r\nowing to a hope in which I have been indulging both on Friday evening,\r\nand on Saturday, to call on you unexpectedly and talk instead of\r\nwriting. However that hope too--the other is Mr Taylor's hope--has\r\nvanished: and I find myself having so much to do that I doubt whether\r\nI will find a moment of freedom this week. So, I write, and hope to be\r\nforgiven for the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now to Poetry. Alas! After mature consideration, I find no\r\n_definition_ at all; by _you_ it is not needed; I am sure you have the\r\n_thing_ in your own Soul, and that is better than all definitions one\r\ncould supply; for Mr Taylor I fear no definition of mine would do.\r\nSuppose I gave a definition that seems to me very true, but that I\r\nought to explain in ten pages at least. \"Poetry is the feeling of a\r\nformer and of a future world\"[48]: he would find out that it belongs\r\nto Byron, and would find himself pledged to refuse it. Suppose that I\r\ngave one of mine:\r\n\r\n     \"Poetry is the Religion of the individual Soul.\"\r\n     \"Religion is the Poetry of the collective Soul.\"\r\n\r\nI fear that not only he, but perhaps you too, would ask for\r\nexplanations which would fill up a lecture, not a note. Suppose that I\r\nquoted lines like these:\r\n\r\n                         \"A Poet's art\r\n     Lies in tolerating wholly, and accounting for in part\r\n     By his own heart's subtle working, those of every other heart\"\r\n\r\nhe would say that that is charity, and nothing else; _we_ would say\r\nthat it is incomplete. Suppose that I adopted yours--which, with due\r\ncomments and interpretations, I am not far from--that \"Poetry is the\r\nsoul of the Universe,\" it would not avail. You gave it already, I am\r\nsure, and it was declared unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nWe must one day or other _talk_ about this. I fear vaguely that even\r\n_we_ do differ in some way respecting the essence of Poetry. I suspect\r\nthat you leave out in your own definition the element of _Action_,\r\nwhich seems to me inseparable from it. Poetry is for me something like\r\nthe third person of Trinity, the Holy Spirit, which _is_ Action. But\r\nthis amounts to declare incomplete, the poetry, for instance, of\r\nWordsworth, Coleridge, etc. Is that a heresy for you? If so, our\r\ndefinitions will not agree.--ever faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n     JOS. MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR PETER TAYLOR [February 16, 1854].\r\n\r\n     [This letter is inserted, because of its historical importance.\r\n     It is, I believe, the earliest existing mention of any scheme\r\n     for a French protectorate in Tuscany. It also antedates by a\r\n     few weeks the earliest known mention of Garibaldi's scheme for\r\n     an expedition to Sicily. Mazzini's information respecting Louis\r\n     Napoleon's plans was probably derived from Dr Conneau, but it\r\n     was generally inaccurate.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I write because I have no time for coming, and I\r\nwrite, I must avow, to silence conscience, with very little hope.\r\n\r\nDo not smile, and say \"the man is mad\"; but put your head in your two\r\nhands and try to solve this question: \"is there any earthly way of\r\ngetting one thousand pounds in a very short time, ten days, a\r\nfortnight at the most?\"\r\n\r\nWith you I have no secrets, and I shall state to you summarily the\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nWe _must_ act: as early as possible in March: in fact as soon as the\r\ndeclaration of war or an action amounting to the same takes place, we\r\nmust _act_, because the initiative is everything for us.\r\n\r\nThe actual schemes of the French Emperor, assented to by your cabinet,\r\nare these:\r\n\r\nA Muratist movement in Naples: reinforcements in Rome ready to help,\r\nas Piedmont would object to the establishment of a French dynasty in\r\nthe South. France offers to patronise the King of Piedmont to the\r\nNorth of Italy. Lombardy will be Piedmontese. But Lombardy and the\r\nVenetian territory would together with Piedmont form too large, too\r\nthreatening a state. Lombardy and Venice shall therefore be divided.\r\nVenice like Greece will be given up to some foreign prince, or to\r\nAustria again if Austria yields and submits in other respects. Rome\r\nwill remain to the Pope. Only as there are provinces so disaffected\r\nthat the case is hopeless, from them and Tuscany a central Dukedom or\r\nPrincedom will be formed under French patronage. Sicily will be\r\ngiven--the old scheme of 1848--to the Duke of Genoa, son of the\r\nPiedmontese king.\r\n\r\nThus Italy will have two more divisions, Sicily and Venice; new\r\nforeign dynasties would be settled there, new interests would group\r\nthemselves around them: a new partition would begin, with high\r\nsanction, a new phasis, and we should have to begin anew our secret\r\nwork, our clandestine printing, our series of martyrdoms, as if\r\nnothing had been done.\r\n\r\nTo all this I know only of a [one] remedy: to initiate: to give the\r\nleadership to the national party. The multitude will follow the first\r\nwho acts; the very elements prepared by all these intrigues will\r\naccrue to us if we move first.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond all, to move in the South. We would thus check the French\r\nscheme before its realisation. As we would, for the present, leave\r\nRome aside and untouched, we do not damage in the least the actual\r\nposition of England with France.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi is here: ready to act. Garibaldi's name is all powerful\r\namong the Neapolitans, since the Roman affair of Velletri. I want to\r\nsend him to Sicily, where they are ripe for insurrection and wishing\r\nfor him as a leader.\r\n\r\nOf course another action would simultaneously take place in a point of\r\nthe centre, and I would lead a third operation in the North.\r\n\r\nFor these two, I have, though very little, still enough of money. For\r\nthe first, that is for Garibaldi, I have none, and claiming it from\r\nItaly would imply expenses for travellers, risks, the unveiling of the\r\nsecret, and _uncertain indefinite_ time.\r\n\r\nAre there not to be found in England ten persons willing for the sake\r\nof Italy and for the sake of baffling schemes of French domination\r\nabsolutely antagonistic to English interests, to take each £100 of our\r\nNational Loan notes?[49]--or twenty ready to take £50 each?\r\n\r\nThis is the problem.\r\n\r\nI know nobody almost. It must be the work of some Englishman. If any\r\nplan could be devised of certain fulfilment, but requiring longer\r\ntime, the sum could be perhaps advanced by some person who would keep\r\nall that would come in by degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n--ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH MAZZINI.\r\n\r\nTo friends whom you can trust, you may, under pledge of honour,\r\ncommunicate what you think proper.\r\n\r\n     Feb. 16. 15 Radnor St.\r\n     King's Road, Chelsea.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR PETER TAYLOR [October 26, 1854].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Are you astonished at our inertness? at our talking\r\nso much and doing so little? I often think that you feel so. I could\r\nexplain everything in two hours of conversation; but take my word in\r\nspite of all, we are ripe for the aim, and that ere long we shall\r\nreach it. In fact, had I not been exceptionally prudent and calm,\r\naction would have been already initiated. It would be any day, were it\r\nnot for Piedmont and the \"Western Powers.\" Piedmont is our curse.\r\n\r\nFirst, on account of its enjoying liberty, it is so much withdrawn\r\nfrom the field of action; then we have, just as in 1848, a whole world\r\nof courtiers, of ministerial agents, of journalists, and even of\r\nclandestine-press-writers, spreading everywhere that the King will\r\ndraw the sword one of these days, that France and England will cause\r\nthe revolution to spring up in Naples, that you will quarrel with\r\nAustria about the Principalities, that a better opportunity will come,\r\nmust come, if only we have patience for one month, for two months, for\r\ntwo weeks. There was a whole dream-dispelling work to be done before\r\nthinking of immediate action. This work is, for the two-thirds, done,\r\nthe other third will take, perhaps some two months. The field will be\r\nmine then. The people, the working-classes, are admirable: they are\r\nmine, mine devotedly to blindness.\r\n\r\nOne thing is out of doubt: any _initiative_ will be an Italian one:\r\none spark will settle the whole on fire, only, the _initiative_ MUST\r\nbe a successful one. This is the source of all my delays. I feel too\r\ncertain of success after the first blow being struck for my risking\r\nuncautiously the first blow.\r\n\r\nThe English agitation I am trying to spread would be of real\r\nimportance to me, if taking a certain degree of _consistence_, both\r\nfrom the financial point of view and from the moral one. You have not\r\nan idea of how proud and stronger my working men do feel here, when\r\nthey find themselves noticed, encouraged and helped in England. I\r\ntrust you will do what is in your power to promote and help.\r\n\r\nHow are you? How is your wife? Are you ever talking about me? against\r\nme? I am well in health, spite of the forcedly sedentary life I lead.\r\nI think very often, under these radiant skies, of the London fogs, and\r\nalways regretfully. Individually speaking, I was evidently intended\r\nfor an Englishman.\r\n\r\nWhat are you doing at Pinner? What little dogs have you caused to\r\ndisappear? How many poor hens kept in a state of bondage, and tied by\r\nthe leg somewhere, are awaiting for a revolutionist to untie them?...\r\nWhat do you read? What do you anticipate for England's politics? Do\r\nyou smoke much?... I wish we could have a talk of one hour all\r\ntogether, with cigars and sherry, and then be back where I am\r\nwanted.... Ever your friend,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MRS PETER TAYLOR [March 19, 1857].\r\n\r\nThanks, my dear Friend, for your having remembered my name's day [St\r\nJoseph's Day]. I don't know why, but every anniversary concerning\r\nmyself finds me very sad: those friendly whisperings are checking the\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nThe box has arrived. You have made out the _only_ point of contact\r\nbetween Shakespeare and myself, on all the rest we deeply differ. He\r\nwas an extraordinary poet: I am not. He was--spite of your\r\ninterpretations--calm:[50] I am not. He looked on the world from\r\nabove: I look at it from within and want to make a revolution. He\r\nwas--if reports are correct--merrily poaching: I have always before my\r\neyes, like a remorse, the large convulsion with which a poor thrush,\r\nshot by me at the age of sixteen, was twisting with her beak a bit of\r\ngrass. He was the Lord of Individuality: all my tendency, if\r\ndeveloped, would have been a generalising one. He was powerful: I am\r\npowerless--and so on, to the end of the chapter.--your friend,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTWO LETTERS TO MRS MILNER-GIBSON\r\n\r\n(Translated from the French)\r\n\r\n     [Mrs Milner-Gibson had just lost a little boy. Mazzini was\r\n     godfather to a younger brother.]\r\n\r\n     [April 15, 1859.]\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND,--What can I say? You believe, as I do, in God and\r\nimmortality. It is there that you must find your comfort and strength.\r\nLove your boy as if he were alive, for in that you will have what will\r\nrestore him to you in the series of existences, which follows this\r\none. Become even better than you are by thinking of him, for this\r\nwill make a bond of love and mutual influence between you and him.\r\nThink of him when you are doing good. Think of him, when impulses of\r\nselfishness or human frailty assail you. Be good and strong. Give your\r\nother children the love he gave them himself. And count on God. There\r\nis immortality to link the mother and the child, and only\r\nforgetfulness can break it. I have heard of his last words and kisses:\r\nhe loved you to his last moment, love him to yours, and believe it,\r\nthis will have been but the parting for a journey.\r\n\r\nThis is all I can say. From me to you such commonplace words of\r\ncomfort as the world generally gives would be a kind of sin. I suffer\r\nwith your grief. I, who have no home now, know what the sorrows of\r\nhome are,--they leave a scar in the heart, which never goes, and that\r\nis sad, but it is well. Cherish this scar, it is a pledge of the\r\nfuture. Do not give yourself up to the barren, cowardly sorrow, called\r\ndespair. There is no death in the world except forgetfulness.\r\nEverything that loves and has loved to death meets again. Good-bye, my\r\nfriend. Think of your health for the sake of your other children. God\r\nbless you in them,--your friend,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[This letter was succeeded by the following.]\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND,--I have received your letters, they are more and more\r\nsad. You have been ill and you are unhappy. Your visit to the\r\nContinent will do you good physically, I hope, but as to your moral\r\nhealth, you must cure that yourself. Rouse your soul, which is in\r\ndanger of being benumbed by sorrow; you will find at the bottom of it,\r\nI don't say happiness, I don't say even hope, but duty and faith in\r\nsome affections which do count. For God's sake, do not despair: you\r\nhave dear children to bring up; you can still do good, and you have\r\nfriends who esteem and love you and suffer with your sufferings and\r\nfind strength in your own. Ah me, what the devil should I do myself,\r\nif I allowed the little strength, which God has left me, to desert me,\r\nas it often threatens to do.... Good-bye. Yours with all my heart,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR PETER TAYLOR [September 11, 1860].\r\n\r\nDEAR PETER,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have yours of the 29th of Aug. written with an improved handwriting,\r\nand the article on Lady Byron. It is according to me, unwise and\r\nunjust: unwise, because to praise Lady Byron for her life's silence\r\nand to abuse the very man about whom she has chosen to be silent, is\r\ninconsistent: unjust, because it grounds a verdict on the wrongs of\r\none party, without taking into account those of the other. Everybody\r\nseems to forget that Lady Byron did not only leave her husband for\r\never, going \"à la promenade,\" but that she did set at him before,\r\nlawyers and doctors to try if she could make him be proved _mad_! I\r\nwish--no, I don't--that your wife should set at you Dr E-- and Mr S--\r\nfor such a purpose, only to see what you would do when discovering it,\r\nand I wish I had time to write, before dying, a book on Byron and\r\nabuse all England, a few women excepted, for the way she treats one of\r\nher greatest souls and minds: I shall never write the book nor--it\r\nbegins to be clear--any other.\r\n\r\nWell, I do not go into particulars about our condition here [at\r\nNaples]. As a party we are going through that sort of method which you\r\ncalled one day a _suicide_, preparing and attempting things which are\r\ncalling on us calumnies, abuse and persecution, but which are taken up\r\nby the other Party as soon as we are put out of the field. After\r\nhaving been baffled and most shamefully so, in an attempt against the\r\nPope's dominions,[51] they are now, at a few days' distance, taking up\r\nour plan. We shall have to do the same, soon or late, concerning Rome,\r\nand then Venice. And we _shall_, if life endures. Only, I am worn out,\r\nmorally and physically.\r\n\r\nEverything is now resting on Garibaldi: will he go on, without\r\n_interruption_, in his invading career, or will he not? That is the\r\nquestion. If he does, we shall have unity within five months: Austria,\r\nspite of the boasted position, will not hold up, if the proper\r\nmeans--a coup de main in the Tyrol, an insurrection in the Venetian\r\nmountainous districts, an attack by land, and a landing near\r\nTrieste--are adopted. If he does not, we shall have slumber, then\r\nanarchy--then--a little later--unity. _That_ you may consider as\r\nsettled, and so far so good. The rest is all wrong. And as for myself\r\ndon't talk of either prosperity or consciousness of having done, etc.\r\nAll that is chaff. The only real good thing would be to have unity\r\natchieved [sic] quickly through Garibaldi, and one year, before dying,\r\nof Walham Green or Eastbourne, long silences, a few affectionate words\r\nto smooth the ways, plenty of sea-gulls, and sad dozing.\r\n\r\nAh! if you had, in England, condescended to see that the _glorious_\r\ndeclaration of non-interference ought to have begun by taking away the\r\nFrench interference in Rome! How many troubles and sacrifices you\r\nwould have saved us!--ever your truly affectionate and grateful\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n     [In another letter to Mr Taylor, dated June 5, 1860, he\r\n     says:]\r\n\r\nYes, I heard of Lady Byron's death and her last gift. I wish something\r\ncame out, now that she is dead, to explain the separation mystery. I\r\nshall ever regret the burning of the memoirs, which was a crime\r\ntowards Byron; and I have ever indulged in the dream that a copy\r\nshould be extant in somebody's hands to come out after the\r\ndisappearing of the principal actors. I saw Lady Byron twice, and she\r\nlooked to me a good sharp positive somewhat dry puritanical woman, sad\r\nfrom the past, conscious of not having been altogether right and doing\r\ngood half for good-doing's sake, half for forgetfulness' sake. But I\r\nam so thoroughly Byronian, so deeply convinced that he has been\r\nwronged by everybody, that my impression cannot be trusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MRS PETER TAYLOR [February 9, 1865]\r\n\r\nDEAR CLEMENTIA,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall send back the magazine: read the article again: take away all\r\nphrases and periphrases: _squeeze_ every period; and then send to me\r\nthe first idea or view which strikes you as new to yourself. I shall\r\nretract.\r\n\r\nThe whole article amounts to this: repeating fifty times in rather\r\nharmonious words that Art is the reproduction of Beauty, etc., etc.\r\nMany thanks. Only, what is Beauty? How to discern it? Why is Nature\r\nbeautiful? Are we to copy, to reproduce Nature? or to add a work of\r\nour own, finding out the idea shut in within every symbol? Is Nature\r\nanything but the symbolic representation of some truth, which we are\r\nto evolve? Or is the drapery of Nature, Nature? Miss C---- says that\r\nthe Artist must choose the object which is Beautiful. Is not _every_\r\nobject more or less so? Is not the grotesque causing the beautiful to\r\nshine by contrast? Are the grave-diggers to be suppressed in Hamlet?\r\n\r\nWithout sifting the nature of Beauty, without giving some definition\r\nof it, nobody can attempt to construct a Hierarchy of Art. Miss C. has\r\nnot even attempted to do so. Still you have been in raptures.\r\nSomething, therefore, must be in the article. I have not been able to\r\nmake it out. I beg pardon humbly. That is all I can say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     --ever affectionately yours,\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n     Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR WILLIAM MALLESON [Nov. 11, 1865].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I feel ashamed, but I have been overwhelmed by work,\r\nnot flourishing in health, although better now, and altogether unable\r\nto fulfil what I had promised. Then, and after all, I write to say\r\nthat I cannot fulfil it. I said that I would write about the education\r\nof your son. I find that I cannot. I ought to know him, his\r\ntendencies, his capabilities, what he has already learned. To give\r\ngeneral rules is nothing. He _may_ require special ones.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned his tendencies. _That_ must be your special object.\r\nEvery man is a _speciality_, is capable of some definite thing. You\r\nmust try to discover that _special_ tendency, and then frame his\r\neducation accordingly. After a general teaching of those branches\r\nwhich are good for _any_ man, direct his studies towards the\r\ndevelopment of that special tendency which you will have discovered.\r\nEducation means _drawing out, educere_, what is in the boy: not\r\ncreating in him what is not. You cannot create.\r\n\r\nBut one thing is, must be common to all. You must give him a proper\r\nnotion of what Life is, and of what the world in which he has been put\r\nfor the fulfilment of a task is.\r\n\r\nLife is a duty, a function, a mission. For God's sake, do not teach\r\nhim any Benthamite theory about happiness either individual or\r\ncollective. A creed of _individual_ happiness would make him an\r\negotist: a creed of collective happiness will reach the same result\r\nsoon or late. He will perhaps dream Utopias, fight for them, whilst\r\nyoung; then, when he will find that he cannot realise rapidly the\r\ndream of his soul, he will turn back to himself and try to conquer\r\n_his_ own happiness: sink into egotism.\r\n\r\nTeach him that Life has no sense unless being a task:--that happiness\r\nmay, like sunshine on a traveller, come to him, and he must welcome it\r\nand bless God for it; but that to _look_ for it is destroying both the\r\nmoral man and his duty and most likely the possibility of ever\r\nenjoying it:--that to improve himself, morally and intellectually, for\r\nthe sake of improving his fellow-creatures, is his task:--that he must\r\ntry to get at Truth and then represent it, in words and deeds,\r\nfearlessly and perennially:--that to get at Truth, two _criteria_ have\r\nbeen given to him, his own conscience and tradition, the conscience of\r\nmankind:--that whenever he will find the inspiration of his own\r\nconscience harmonising with that of mankind, sought for not in the\r\nhistory of a single period or of a single people, but of all periods\r\nand peoples, then he is sure of having Truth within his grasp:--that\r\nthe basis of all Truth is the knowledge of the Law of Life, which is\r\nindefinite Progression:--that to this Law he must be a servant.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge of the Law of Progression must be your aim in all your\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nElementary Astronomy, elementary Geology, ought to be taught as soon\r\nas possible. Then, universal History, then Languages.\r\n\r\nThe difficult thing is to get the proper teaching. When I speak, for\r\ninstance, of Astronomy, I mean a survey of the Universe, of which the\r\nEarth is part, grounded on Herschel's theory and tending to prove how\r\neverything is the exponent of a Law of Progression, how the Law is\r\none, how every part of the Universe accomplishes a function in the\r\nwhole. Herschel, Nichol, Guillemin's recently translated \"Heavens\" are\r\nthe guides to be chosen.\r\n\r\nLanguages are easily learned in boyhood. French, German, and Italian\r\nought to be taught. Two years of study may put the boy in\r\ncommunication with three worlds.\r\n\r\nI would not teach any _positive_ Religion; but the great fundamental\r\nTrinity, God, the immortality of the soul, the necessity of a religion\r\nas a common link of brotherhood for mankind, grounded on the\r\nacknowledgment of the Law of Progression. At a later period he will\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nGeography of course will be taught. But everything taught in a\r\n_general_ way and not applied is easily forgot. The best way is to\r\nhave a collection of good maps and to give him the habit of never\r\nreading a historical book or even a tale without following it up on\r\nthe map. It is the best and most lasting way.\r\n\r\nAvoid novels and tales. Give him a taste for historical books and\r\nscientific descriptive _illustrated_ books of natural history travels,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn one word, a religious conception of life--then a full notion of the\r\nworld he lives in--then the special branch of activity to which he\r\nseems inclined: that is the whole of education for your boy.\r\n\r\nForgive these hurried notes. Apply to me freely for any detail or\r\nspecial suggestion. I shall be most happy to answer. Give my love to\r\nMrs Malleson and to Miss K. M. How are they? How is your father? Where\r\nare you all now?--Ever affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n     Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nREST.\r\n\r\n     [Written for the Pen and Pencil Club in April 1867, and\r\n     privately published in 1877, with other papers written by\r\n     its members.]\r\n\r\nDEAREST FRIEND,--The subject of your meeting of to-morrow is so\r\nsuggestive that I would gladly join you all, and write an essay on it,\r\nif I had health and time. I have neither, and, perhaps, better so. My\r\nessay, I candidly avow, would tend to prove that no essay ought to be\r\nwritten on the subject. It has no reality. A sort of intuitive\r\ninstinct led you to couple \"Ghosts and Rest\" together.\r\n\r\nThere is, here down,[52] and there ought to be, no Rest. Life is an\r\n_aim_; an aim which can be _approached_, not _reached_, here down.\r\nThere is, therefore, no rest. Rest is immoral.\r\n\r\nIt is not mine now to give a definition of the _aim_; whatever it is,\r\nthere is one, there _must_ be one. Without it, Life has no sense. It\r\nis atheistical; and moreover an irony and a deception.\r\n\r\nI entertain all possible respect for the members of your Club; but I\r\nventure to say that any contribution on Rest which will not exhibit at\r\nthe top a definition of Life will wander sadly between wild arbitrary\r\nintellectual display and commonplaces.\r\n\r\nLife is no sinecure, no \"_recherche du bonheur_\" to be secured, as the\r\npromulgators of the theory had it, by guillotine, or, as their less\r\nenergetic followers have it, by railway shares, selfishness, or\r\ncontemplation. Life is, as Schiller said, \"a battle and a march\"; a\r\nbattle for Good against Evil, for Justice against arbitrary\r\nprivileges, for Liberty against Oppression, for associated Love\r\nagainst Individualism; a march onwards to Self, through collective\r\nPerfecting to the progressive realisation of an Ideal, which is only\r\ndawning to our mind and soul. Shall the battle be finally won during\r\nlife-time? Shall it on Earth? Are we believing in a millennium? Don't\r\nwe feel that the spiral curve through which we ascend had its\r\nbeginning elsewhere, and has its end, if any, beyond this terrestrial\r\nworld of ours. Where is then a possible foundation for your essays and\r\nsketches?\r\n\r\nGoethe's \"Contemplation\" has created a multitude of little sects\r\naiming at Rest, where is no rest, falsifying art, the element of which\r\nis evolution, not reproduction, transformation, not contemplation, and\r\nenervating the soul in self-abdicating Brahmanic attempts. For God's\r\nsake let not your Club add one little sect to the fatally existing\r\nhundreds!\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to be looked for in life except the uninterrupted\r\nfulfilment of Duty, and, not Rest, but consolation and strengthening\r\nfrom Love. There is, not Rest, but a promise, a shadowing forth of\r\nRest in Love. Only there must be in Love absolute _trust_; and it is\r\nvery seldom that this blessing depends [? descends] on us. The child\r\ngoes to sleep, a dreamless sleep, with unbounded _trust_, on the\r\nmother's bosom; but _our_ sleep is a restless one, agitated by sad\r\ndreams and alarms.\r\n\r\nYou will smile at my lugubrious turn of mind; but if I was one of\r\n_your_ Artists, I would sketch a man on the scaffold going to die for\r\na great Idea, for the cause of Truth, with his eye looking trustfully\r\non a loving woman, whose finger would trustfully and smilingly point\r\nout to him the unbounded. Under the sketch I would write, not Rest,\r\nbut \"a Promise of Rest.\" Addio: tell me one word about the point of\r\nview of your contributors.--Ever affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MRS PETER TAYLOR [From Lugano, December 12, 1868.]\r\n\r\nDEAR CLEMENTIA,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am better, although not so much as my friends here suppose. I feel,\r\nfrom various little symptoms, as if I could any week have the\r\ncomplaint back. I may, and hope to be mistaken, however. So, let us\r\naccept what instalment is granted, and not think of the future. I\r\nmight give myself an additional chance, if I could keep absolutely\r\nsilent and motionless during one month. But I cannot. There is--at\r\nleast--a possibility of the Republic being proclaimed in Spain; and if\r\nso, we must try to follow, a preparatory very complex work is\r\ntherefore unavoidable. It is useless to tell me: \"if you keep quiet\r\nnow, you will be able to work better henceforward.\" The important\r\nthing is to work now.\r\n\r\nYour cabinet[53] is a shameful contrivance.... It is an implement good\r\nfor the conquest of the Irish measure, and soon after, I think, the\r\nmajority will split into two or three fractions. As to your--quite\r\nforgotten--international life, the main thing about which, according\r\nto me, you ought to care, Lord Clarendon's policy will be a French and\r\nAustrian policy. What does Peter say? Is he still enthusiastic about\r\nGladstone?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYour women-emancipating movement is fairly imitated in Italy. We have\r\na central committee of ladies in Naples, and sub-committees here and\r\nthere, and one or two members of our House pleading for them. All\r\nthis is very right, and I hope that next year, European events will\r\nhelp this movement; but meanwhile, I should wish very much that,\r\nwhilst you attack men with their gross injustice, you should teach\r\nwomen to _deserve_ their emancipation: nothing is conquered unless\r\n_deserved_. The poor working men _have_ deserved; they have for one\r\ncentury fought, bled, acted for _all_ the good causes in Europe: the\r\nmajority of your women still fight almost entirely for a husband to be\r\nwon by their personal genuine or artificial appearance; they worship\r\n_fashion_ more than the Ideal. You ought to write one tract to men and\r\none to them.\r\n\r\nTry to be well: give my love to Peter and believe in the deep and\r\nlasting affection of\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR WILLIAM SHAEN [From Gaeta, Oct. 12, 1870].\r\n\r\nDEAR SHAEN,--I know that a few words from me and from here will please\r\nyou. You do not forget me, and you have never been forgotten: none is\r\nof those whom I loved in England. For many reasons, I cannot write to\r\nall my friends, and they know the general state of things concerning\r\nme from good, faithful, dear Caroline.[54] I am, physically, tolerably\r\nwell; for the rest \"fata viam invenient.\"\r\n\r\nI know that you have been and are very active in the \"Woman's\r\nEmancipation Movement.\" Every good cause has ever found you ready to\r\nhelp; and I had no doubt of your coming forward in one which ought to\r\nbe a matter of simple duty for anyone believing that there is but one\r\nGod--one Life--one Law of progress through Love, Equality and\r\nAssociation for it. Still, it is comforting to hear of it. The\r\nmovement has begun and with some degree of power in Italy too: it\r\nwould rapidly and successfully increase had we not to complete, before\r\nall other things, our national edifice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEver and most affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n     JOS. MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n     28/9/70, GAETA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis note was written, as you see, long ago: and through some reason\r\nor other, it did not go; and I am able now to add that to-morrow I\r\nshall be free, and the day after I shall leave Gaeta. The _amnesty_,\r\nof course, I shall refuse to avail myself of! I must be free of doing\r\nwhatever I think right and without even the shadow of ungratefulness\r\nto any body--even to a King. After a few days I shall therefore leave\r\nItaly again. It may be that during next month I come--for one\r\nmonth--to see my English friends: I wish and hope so. Meanwhile: live\r\nand prosper.--Yours ever,\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n     12/10/70.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] This is inaccurate.

It is, I believe, a complete\r\nlist of writings of any importance by or concerning Mazzini, except\r\nsome, which contain purely political references. For some of the minor\r\nreferences I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Signor\r\nCanestrelli's bibliography, published with his translation of von\r\nSchack's _Giuseppe Mazzini e l'unità italiana_ (Rome, 1892).]\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITINGS.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of Mazzini's writings have been collected in _Scritti editi e\r\ninediti di Giuseppe Mazzini_, 18 vols. (Milan and Rome, 1861-1891).\r\nThere is an excellent selection, edited by Madame Mario, as _Scritti\r\nscelti di Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Florence, 1901).\r\n\r\nA good many of Mazzini's less important journalistic articles have not\r\nbeen included in the _Scritti editi e inediti_. There are several more\r\nnotable omissions:--\r\n\r\n_Una notte di Rimini_, said to be Mazzini's first strictly political\r\nwriting, republished in Madame Mario's life.\r\n\r\n_Due adunanze degli accademici pitagorici_, and _Di Vittor Hugo e\r\ndell'Angelo tiranno_, published in _Il Subalpino_, 1839, and reprinted\r\nin Donaver, _Vita di G. Mazzini_.\r\n\r\n_Byron e Goethe_ (very important for Mazzini's literary views),\r\npublished in _Scritti letterari d'un italiano vivente_ (Lugano, 1847),\r\nrepublished in Madame Mario's _Scritti scelti_, and badly translated\r\nin the _Life and Writings_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n_Sulla pittura in Italia_, published in _Scritti letterari_.\r\n\r\n_Macchiavelli_, published in ditto.\r\n\r\n_Victor Hugo_, published in _British and Foreign Review_, 1838, and\r\nrepublished in _Life and Writings_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n_Lamartine_, published in _British and Foreign Review_, 1839, and\r\nrepublished in _Life and Writings_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n_Letters on the state and prospects of Italy_, published in _Monthly\r\nChronicle_, May-Sept. 1839.\r\n\r\n_George Sand_, published in _Monthly Chronicle_, July 1839; extracts\r\nrepublished in _Life and Writings_, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n_Thiers_, published in _Monthly Chronicle_, July 1839.\r\n\r\nReview of C. Balbo's _Vita di Dante_, published in _The European_,\r\nJan. 1840, and translated in A. von Schack, Joseph Mazzini und die\r\nitalienische Einheit.\r\n\r\n_Italian Art_, published in _Westminster Review_, April 1841. [There\r\nis no direct evidence that this was written by Mazzini, but the\r\ninternal evidence is rather strong. I believe that it was translated\r\ninto or from the _Révue républicaine_.]\r\n\r\nIntroduction and notes to Foscolo's edition of the _Divina Commedia_\r\n(see above, p. 94).\r\n\r\n_Pensieri sulla storia d'Italia_, published in _l'Educatore_ (London,\r\n1843).\r\n\r\n_Sull'educazione_, published in ditto, and republished in\r\n_l'Emancipazione_ (Rome), Oct. 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n_A prayer for the planters_, published for the first time in this\r\nvolume, pp. 349-352.\r\n\r\n_Address of the People's International League_, republished in _Life\r\nand Writings_, vol. vi. (see above, note to p. 303).\r\n\r\nNotes for an answer to the Irish Repealers, published in _Scottish\r\nLeader_, July, 1888 (see above, p. 107).\r\n\r\n_George Sand_, published in _People's Journal_; extracts republished\r\nin _Life and Writings_, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n_Non-intervention_, published as a tract by the \"Friends of Italy,\"\r\nand republished in _Life and Writings_, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n_Rest_, published privately by the Pen and Pencil Club, and\r\nrepublished in this volume, pp. 363-365.\r\n\r\n_Italy and the Republic_, published in _Fortnightly Review_, March 1,\r\n1871.\r\n\r\n_The Franco-German War and the Commune_, published in _Contemporary\r\nReview_, April and June, 1871.\r\n\r\n[Signor Cagnacci in his _Giuseppe Mazzini e i fratelli Ruffini_\r\npublishes a rhapsodical _Aux jeunes italiens_ and a short poem _Addio\r\ndalle Alpi_, which he believes to be from Mazzini's pen; he gives,\r\nhowever, no evidence whatever in support of his theory. For Mazzini's\r\nsupposed youthful poetry see Donaver, _Uomini e libri_, 77, 119, and\r\n_Vita di G. Mazzini_, 29 n., 431, and Canestrelli's bibliography, pp.\r\n290, 291, 305, 308-9, 311.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the first seven volumes of the _Scritti editi e\r\ninediti_, with some additional matter, was translated into English as\r\n_Life and Writings of Joseph Mazzini_, 6 vols. (London, 1870). The\r\n_Duties of Man_ and _Democracy in Europe_ (_alias The Systems and the\r\nDemocracy_, the early chapters of which were written originally in\r\nEnglish) have been translated by Madame Venturi and were published by\r\nH. S. King in 1877 and later by Alexander and Shepherd. FROM THE POPE\r\nTO THE COUNCIL (_alias Letter to the Oecumenical Council_) and\r\n_Lamennais_ have been translated by Mme. Venturi. _Faith and the\r\nFuture_ and other essays have been translated by Mr T. Okey and\r\npublished by Dent. Together with _From the Council to God_, _The\r\nDuties of Man_, and _To the Italian Working-man_, they have been\r\npublished by Dent in \"Everyman's Library.\" Various extracts have been\r\ncollected by the Bishop of Truro and published by Fisher Unwin. There\r\nis a volume of translations in the Camelot Classics. Several earlier\r\ntranslations of separate essays have been published.\r\n\r\nThere are two volumes of a German translation, published by Hoffmann\r\nu. Campe (Hamburg, 1868). _The Duties of Man_ and _Democracy in Europe_\r\nare published in French by Charpentier (Paris, 1881).\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNALISM.\r\n\r\nMazzini's papers were--\r\n\r\n_La Giovine Italia._ Marseilles and Switzerland. 1832-1836.

Cagnacci (Porto\r\nMaurizio, 1893). Contains his letters to Madame Ruffini (1837-1841), a\r\nfew letters to A. and G. Ruffini, and extracts from his letters to\r\nElia Benza.\r\n\r\n_Lettres intimes de Joseph Mazzini, publiées par D. Melegari_ (Paris,\r\n1895). Contains letters to L. A. Melegari and Madame de Mandrot\r\n(mostly 1836-1843).\r\n\r\n_La Giovine Italia e la giovine Europa_ (Milan, 1906). Contains\r\nletters to L. A. Melegari (chiefly 1833).\r\n\r\n_Lettere inedite di Giuseppe Mazzini, pubblicate da L. Ordoño de\r\nRosales_ (Turin, 1898). Contains letters to Gaspare de Rosales (mostly\r\n1834-1836).\r\n\r\n_Duecento lettere inedite di Giuseppe Mazzini con proemio e note di D.\r\nGiuriati_ (Turin, 1887). Contains letters to G.

It has\r\nbeen republished in _Politica segreta italiana_ (Turin, 1880).]\r\n\r\nA very imperfect collection of Mazzini's correspondence is now being\r\npublished under the editorship of Signor Ernesto Nathan, as\r\n_Epistolario di Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Florence, 1902). Two volumes only\r\nhave as yet appeared; their most important feature is Mazzini's\r\ncorrespondence with his mother.\r\n\r\nMany letters are also published in the introductions to Mazzini's\r\n_Scritti editi e inediti_ and in Madame Mario's _Della Vito di G.\r\nMazzini_ and _Scritti scelti_; also in Linaker, _La vita e i tempi di\r\nE. Mayer_ (Florence, 1898) [letters to E. Mayer]; _Nuova Antologia_,\r\nDec. 1, 1884 [letters to Madame Magiotti and E. Mayer]; _Ib._, May 1\r\nand 16, 1890 [letters to F. Le Monnier]; _Ib._, May 1, 1907; Del Cerro\r\n(_pseud._), _Un amore di G.

Okey; Parliamentary Papers, Correspondence affecting\r\naffairs of Italy, 1846-1849, i. 223 (probably genuine).\r\n\r\nI have also been able to see some 350 unpublished letters,--to Mr and\r\nMrs Peter Taylor (of the greatest value for Mazzini's public and\r\nprivate life); Mr William Shaen (a large and important collection);\r\nMrs Milner-Gibson; Mr W. Malleson; Mr W. E. Hickson (when editor of\r\nthe _Westminster Review_); Mr Peter Stuart; and Miss Galeer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES.\r\n\r\nMazzini's autobiographical notes in the earlier volumes of the\r\n_Scritti editi e inediti_ are of course of the highest value. The\r\ncompletest life is Mario, _Della vita di Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Milan,\r\n1886), containing a mass of valuable material, but partial and\r\nincluding much extraneous matter. There is a much better study of\r\nMazzini's early life, prefixed to the same authoress' _Scritti\r\nscelti_. Saffi's introductions to several volumes of the _Scritti\r\neditie e inediti_ are most valuable. Donaver's _Vita di G. Mazzini_ is\r\nuseful, especially for the earlier period. There is a short memoir by\r\nMadame Venturi (_née_ Miss Ashurst) prefixed to the English\r\ntranslation of the Duties of Man. I have seen no other biographies of\r\nany value.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICES AND STUDIES.\r\n\r\nThere is a life-like portrait of Mazzini and much information about\r\nhis early life in G. Ruffini, _Lorenzo Benoni_ (Edinburgh, 1853); a\r\nvaluable sketch, largely based on conversations with Madame Mazzini,\r\nby Mr William Shaen in _The Public Good_, 1851; and some useful\r\ninformation in Donaver, _Uomini e libri_. There are studies of more or\r\nless value in Cantimori, _Saggio sull'idealismo di G. Mazzini_\r\n(Faenza, 1904); Linaker, _La Vita italiana nel risorgimento_\r\n(Florence, 1899); Nencioni, _Saggi critici di letteratura italiana_\r\n(Florence, 1898); Oxilia, _Giuseppe Mazzini, uomo e letterato_\r\n(Florence, 1902); F. Myers in _Fortnightly Review_, 1878; De Sanctis,\r\n_La letteratura italiana nel secola XIX._ (Naples, 1902); D'Ancona e\r\nBacci, _Manuale della lettaratura italiana_, vol. v. (Florence,\r\n1901); _Mazzini: Conferenze tenute in Genova_ (Genova, 1906). There are\r\nvaluable analyses of Mazzini's economic position in Bozzino, _Il\r\nsocialismo e la dottrina sociale di Mazzini_ (Genoa, 1895), and\r\nBertacchi, _Il pensiero sociale di Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Milan, 1900).\r\nHostile studies in Bianchi, _Vicende del Mazzinianismo_ (Savona, 1854)\r\nand Grüber, _Massoneria e Rivoluzione_ (Rome, 1901), the latter of\r\nsmall value.\r\n\r\nThere are notices in Mrs Carlyle's _Letters and Memorials_; Carlyle's\r\n_Reminiscences_; Froude, _Carlyle's Life in London_; _Correspondence\r\nof Carlyle and Emerson_; Mrs Fletcher's _Autobiography_; W. J. Linton,\r\n_European Republicans_ and _Memories_; T. S.
