The painstaking and candid\r\nlabors of Mr. Fiske, Mr. Adams, Mr. Rhodes, and others have gone far to\r\nrender unnecessary the _caveat_ I then entered against the unfairness,\r\nor at least the narrowness, of the temper with which Van Buren, or the\r\nschool to which he belonged, had thus far been treated in American\r\nliterature, and which had prejudicially misled me before I began my\r\nwork. Such a _caveat_ is no longer necessary. Even now, when the\r\npolitical creed of which Jefferson, Van Buren, and Tilden have been\r\nchief apostles in our land, seems to suffer some degree of\r\neclipse,--only temporary, it may well be believed, but nevertheless\r\nreal,--those who, like myself, have undertaken to present the careers of\r\ngreat Americans who held this faith need not fear injustice or prejudice\r\nin the field of American literature.\r\n\r\nIn this revised edition I have made a few corrections and added a few\r\nnotes; but the generous treatment which has been given to the book has\r\nconfirmed my belief that historic truth requires no material change.\r\n\r\nA passage from the diary of Charles Jared Ingersoll (Life by William M.\r\nMeigs, 1897) tempts me, in this most conspicuous place of the book, to\r\nemphasize my observation upon one injustice often done to Van Buren.\r\nReferring, on May 6, 1844, to his letter, then just published, against\r\nthe annexation of Texas, Mr. Ingersoll declared that, in view of the\r\nfact that nearly all of Van Buren's admirers and most of the Democratic\r\npress were committed to the annexation, Van Buren had committed a great\r\nblunder and become _felo de se_. The assumption here is that Van Buren\r\nwas a politician of the type so painfully familiar to us, whose sole and\r\nconscienceless effort is to find out what is to be popular for the time,\r\nin order, for their own profit, to take that side. That Van Buren was\r\npolitic there can be no doubt. But he was politic after the fashion of a\r\nstatesman and not of a demagogue. He disliked to commit himself upon\r\nissues which had not been fully discussed, which were not ripe for\r\npractical solution by popular vote, and which did not yet need to be\r\ndecided. Mr. Ingersoll should have known that the direct and simple\r\nexplanation was the true one,--that Van Buren knew the risk and meant to\r\ntake it. His letter against the annexation of Texas, written when he\r\nknew that it would probably defeat him for the presidency, was but one\r\nof several acts performed by him at critical periods, wherein he\r\ndeliberately took what seemed the unpopular side in order to be true to\r\nhis sense of political and patriotic duty. The crucial tests of this\r\nkind through which he successfully passed must, beyond any doubt, put\r\nhim in the very first rank of those American statesmen who have had the\r\nrare union of political foresight and moral courage.\r\n\r\n                                                    EDWARD M.

His father was a\r\nwhite-haired, bright-eyed old man, erect but short in figure, of precise\r\nthough easy and kindly politeness, and with a touch of deference in his\r\nmanner. His presence did not peremptorily command the attention of\r\nstrangers; but to those who looked attentively there was plain\r\ndistinction in the refined and venerable face. Passers-by might well\r\nturn back to see more of the two men thus affectionately and\r\npicturesquely together. For they were famous characters,--the one in\r\nthe newer, the other in the older politics of America. John Van Buren,\r\nfresh from his Free Soil battle and the tussles of the Hards and Softs,\r\nwas striving, as a Democrat, to serve the cause of the Union, though\r\nconscious that he rested under the suspicion of the party to whose\r\nservice, its divisions in New York now seemingly ended, he had\r\nreluctantly returned. But he still faced the slave power with an\r\nindependence only partially abated before the exigencies of party\r\nloyalty. The ex-President, definitely withdrawn from the same Free Soil\r\nbattle, a struggle into which he had entered when the years were already\r\nheavy upon him, had survived to be once more a worthy in the Democratic\r\nparty, again to receive its formal veneration, but never again its old\r\naffection. In their timid manoeuvres with slavery it was perhaps with\r\nthe least possible awkwardness that the northern Democrats sought to\r\ntreat him as a great Democratic leader; but they did not let it be\r\nforgotten that the leader was forever retired from leadership. While the\r\nyounger man was in the thick of political encounters which the party\r\ncarried on in blind futility, the older man was hardly more than an\r\nhistorical personage. He was no longer, his friends strove to think, the\r\nschismatic candidate of 1848, but rather the ally and friend of Jackson,\r\nor, better still and further away, the disciple of Jefferson.\r\n\r\nFor, more than any other American, Martin Van Buren had succeeded to the\r\npreaching of Jefferson's political doctrines, and to his political\r\npower as well, that curious and potent mingling of philosophy,\r\nstatesmanship, and electioneering. The Whigs' distrust towards Van Buren\r\nwas still bitter; the hot anger of his own party over the blow he had\r\ndealt in 1848 was still far from subsided; the gratitude of most Free\r\nSoil men had completely disappeared with his apparent acquiescence in\r\nthe politics of Pierce and Buchanan. Save in a narrow circle of\r\nanti-slavery Democrats, Van Buren, in these last days of his, was judged\r\nat best with coldness, and most commonly with dislike or even contempt.\r\nNot much of any other temper has yet gone into political history; its\r\nwriters have frequently been content to accept the harshness of partisan\r\nopinion, or even the scurrility and mendacity visited upon him during\r\nhis many political campaigns, and to ignore the positive records of his\r\ncareer and public service. The present writer confesses to have begun\r\nthis Life, not indeed sharing any of the hatred or contempt so commonly\r\nfelt towards Van Buren, but still given to many serious depreciations of\r\nhim, which a better examination has shown to have had their ultimate\r\nsource in the mere dislike of personal or political enemies,--a dislike\r\nto whose expression, often powerful and vivid, many writers have\r\nextended a welcome seriously inconsistent with the fairness of history.\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham Lincoln was chosen president in 1860, this predecessor of\r\nhis by a quarter century was a true historical figure. The bright,\r\ngenial old man connected, visibly and really, those stirring and\r\ndangerous modern days with the first political struggles under the\r\nAmerican Constitution, struggles then long passed into the quiet of\r\nhistory, to leave him almost their only living reminiscence. Martin Van\r\nBuren was a man fully grown and already a politician when in 1801 the\r\ntriumph of Thomas Jefferson completed the political foundation of the\r\nUnited States. Its profound inspiration still remained with him on this\r\neve of Lincoln's election. Under its influence his political career had\r\nbegun and had ended.\r\n\r\nAt Jefferson's election the aspiration and fervor which attended the\r\nfirst, the new-born sense of American national life, had largely worn\r\naway. The ideal visions of human liberty had long before grown dim\r\nduring seven years of revolutionary war, with its practical hardships,\r\nits vicissitudes of meanness and glory, and during the four years of\r\nlanguor and political incompetence which followed. In the agitation for\r\nbetter union, political theories filled the minds of our forefathers.\r\nLessons were learned from the Achæan League, as well as from the Swiss\r\nConfederation, the German Empire, and the British Constitution. Both\r\nhistory and speculation, however, were firmly subordinated to an\r\nextraordinary common sense, in part flowing from, as it was most finely\r\nexhibited in, the luminous and powerful, if unexalted, genius of\r\nFranklin. From the open beginning of constitution-making at Annapolis in\r\n1786 until the inauguration of John Adams, the American people, under\r\nthe masterful governing of Washington, were concerned with the framework\r\nupon which the fabric of their political life was to be wrought. The\r\nframework was doubtless in itself of a vast and enduring importance. If\r\nthe consolidating and aristocratic schemes of Hamilton had not met\r\ndefeat in the federal convention, or if the separatist jealousies of\r\nPatrick Henry and George Clinton had not met defeat in Virginia and New\r\nYork after the work of the convention was done, there would to-day be a\r\ndifferent American people. Nor would our history be the amazing story of\r\nthe hundred years past. But upon the governmental framework thus set up\r\ncould be woven political fabrics widely and essentially different in\r\ntheir material, their use, and their enduring virtue. For quite apart\r\nfrom the framework of government were the temper and traditions of\r\npopular politics out of which comes, and must always come, the essential\r\nand dominant nature of public institutions. In this creative and deeper\r\nwork Jefferson was engaged during his struggle for political power after\r\nreturning from France in 1789, during his presidential career from 1801\r\nto 1809, and during the more extraordinary, and in American history the\r\nunparalleled, supremacy of his political genius after he had left\r\noffice. In the circumstances of our colonial life, in our race\r\nextractions, in our race fusion upon the Atlantic seaboard, and in the\r\nmoral effect of forcible and embittered separation from the parent\r\ncountry, arose indeed, to go no further back, the political instincts of\r\nAmerican men. It is, however, fatal to adequate conception of our\r\npolitical development to ignore the enormous formative influence which\r\nthe twenty years of Jefferson's rule had upon American political\r\ncharacter. But so partial and sometimes so partisan have been the\r\nhistorians of our early national politics in their treatment of that\r\ngreat man, that a just appreciation of the political atmosphere in which\r\nVan Buren began his career is exceedingly difficult.\r\n\r\nThere was an American government, an American nation, when Washington\r\ngladly escaped to Mt. Vernon from the bitterly factional quarrels of the\r\npoliticians at Philadelphia. The government was well ordered; the nation\r\nwas respectable and dignified. But most of the people were either still\r\ncolonial and provincial, or were rushing, in turbulence and bad temper,\r\nto crude speculations and theories. Twenty-five years later, Jefferson\r\nhad become the political idol of the American people, a people\r\ncompletely and forever saturated with democratic aspirations, democratic\r\nideals, what John Marshall called \"political metaphysics,\" a people with\r\nstrong and lasting characteristics, no longer either colonial or\r\nprovincial, but profoundly national. The skill, the industry, the arts\r\nof the politician, had been used by a man gifted with the genius and not\r\nfree from the faults of a philosopher, to plant in American usages,\r\nprejudices, and traditions,--in the very fibre of American political\r\nlife, a cardinal and fruitful idea. The work was done for all time. For\r\nAmericans, government was thenceforth to be a mere instrument. No longer\r\na symbol, or an ornament or crown of national life, however noble and\r\naugust, it was a simple means to a plain end; to be always, and if need\r\nbe rudely, tested and measured by its practical working, by its service\r\nto popular rights and needs. In those earlier days, too, there had been\r\n\"classes and masses,\" the former of whom held public service and public\r\npolicy as matters of dignity and order and high assertion of national\r\nright and power, requiring in their ministers peculiar and esoteric\r\nlight, and an equipment of which common men ought not to judge, because\r\nthey could not judge aright. Afterward, in Monroe's era of good feeling,\r\nthe personal rivalries of presidential candidates were in bad temper\r\nenough; but Americans were at last all democrats. Whether for better or\r\nworse, the nation had ceased to be either British or colonial, or\r\nprovincial, in its character. In the delightful Rip Van Winkle of a\r\nlater Jefferson, during the twenty years' sleep, the old Dutch house has\r\ngone, the peasant's dress, the quaint inn with its village tapster, all\r\nthe old scene of loyal provincial life. Rip returns to a noisy,\r\nboastful, self-assertive town full of American \"push\" and \"drive,\" and\r\nprofane disregard of superiors and everything ancient. It was hardly a\r\nless change which spread through the United States in the twenty years\r\nof Jefferson's unrivaled and fruitful leadership. Superstitious regard\r\nfor the \"well-born,\" for institutions of government as images of\r\nveneration apart from their immediate and practical use; the faith in\r\ngovernment as essentially a financial establishment which ought to be on\r\npeculiarly friendly relations with banks and bankers; the treatment and\r\nconsideration of our democratic organization as an experiment to be\r\nadministered with deprecatory deference to European opinion; the idea\r\nthat upon the great, simple elements of political belief and practice,\r\nthe mass of men could not judge as wisely and safely as the opulent, the\r\ncultivated, the educated; the idea that it was a capital feature of\r\npolitical art to thwart the rashness and incompetence of the lower\r\npeople,--all these theories and traditions, which had firmly held most\r\nof the disciplined thought of Europe and America, and to which the lurid\r\nhorrors of the French Revolution had brought apparent consecration,--all\r\nthese had now gone; all had been fatally wounded, or were sullenly and\r\napologetically cherished in the aging bitterness of the Federalists.\r\nThere was an American people with as distinct, as powerful, as\r\ncharacteristic a polity as belonged to the British islanders. In 1776 a\r\nyouthful genius had seized upon a colonial revolt against taxation as\r\nthe occasion to make solemn declaration of a seeming abstraction about\r\nhuman rights. He had submitted, however, to subordinate his theory\r\nduring the organization of national defense and the strengthening of\r\nthe framework of government. Nor did he shine in either of those works.\r\nBut with the nation established, with a union secured so that its people\r\ncould safely attend to the simpler elements of human rights, Jefferson\r\nand his disciples were able to lead Americans to the temper, the\r\naspirations, and the very prejudices of essential democracy. The\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the ten amendments to the Constitution\r\ntheoretically formulating the rights of men or of the States, sank deep\r\ninto the sources of American political life. So completely indeed was\r\nthe work done, that in 1820 there was but one political party in\r\nAmerica; all were Jeffersonian Republicans; and when the Republican\r\nparty was broken up in 1824, the only dispute was whether Adams or\r\nJackson or Crawford or Clay or Calhoun best represented the political\r\nbeliefs now almost universal. It seemed to Americans as if they had\r\nnever known any other beliefs, as if these doctrines of their democracy\r\nwere truisms to which the rest of the world was marvelously blind.\r\n\r\nNothing in American public life has, in prolonged anger and even savage\r\ndesperation, equaled the attacks upon Jefferson during the steady growth\r\nof his stupendous influence. The hatred of him personally, and the\r\nbelief in the wickedness of his private and public life, survive in our\r\ntime. Nine tenths of the Americans who then read books sincerely thought\r\nhim an enemy of mankind and of all that was sacred. Nine tenths of the\r\nauthors of American books on history or politics have to this day\r\nwritten under the influence which ninety years ago controlled their\r\npredecessors. And for this there is no little reason. As the American\r\npeople grew conscious of their own peculiar and intensely active\r\npolitical force, there came to them a period of national and popular\r\nlife in which much was unlovely, much was crude, much was disagreeably\r\nvulgar. Books upon America written by foreign travelers, from the days\r\nof Jefferson down to our civil war, superficial and offensive as they\r\noften were, told a great deal of truth. We do not now need to wince at\r\ncriticisms upon a rawness, an insolent condescension towards the\r\npolitical ignorance of foreigners and the unhappy subjects of kings, a\r\nharshness in the assertion of the equality of Caucasian men, and a\r\nrestless, boastful manner. The criticisms were in great measure just.\r\nBut the critics were stupid and blind not to see the vast and vital work\r\nand change going on before their eyes, to chiefly regard the trifling\r\nand incidental things which disgusted them. Their eyes were open to all\r\nour faults of taste and manner, but closed to the self-dependent and\r\nself-assertive energy the disorder of whose exhibition would surely pass\r\naway. In every democratic experiment, in every experiment of popular or\r\nnational freedom, there is almost inevitable a vulgarizing of public\r\nmanners, a lack of dignity in details, which disturbs men who find\r\nrestful delight in orderly and decorous public life; and their disgust\r\nis too often directed against beneficent political changes or reforms.\r\nIf one were to judge the political temper of the American people from\r\nmany of our own writers, and still more if he were to judge it from the\r\nobservations even of intelligent and friendly foreigners prior to 1861,\r\nhe would believe that temper to be sordid, mean, noisy, boastful, and\r\neven cruel. But from the war of 1812 with England to the election of\r\nBuchanan in 1856, the American people had been doing a profound,\r\norganic, democratic work. Meantime many had seen no more than the\r\nunsightly, the mean and trivial, the malodorous details, which were mere\r\nincidents and blemishes of hidden and dynamic operations. Unimaginative\r\nminds usually fail to see the greater and deeper movements of politics\r\nas well as those of science. In the public virtues then maturing there\r\nlay the ability long and strenuously to conduct an enterprise the\r\ngreatest which modern times have known, and an extraordinary popular\r\ncapacity for restraint and discipline. In those virtues was sleeping a\r\ntremendously national spirit which, with cost and sacrifice not to be\r\nmeasured by the vast figures of the statistician, on one side sought\r\nindependence, and on the other saved the Union,--an exalted love of men\r\nand truth and liberty, which, after all the enervations of pecuniary\r\nprosperity, endured with patience hardships and losses, and the less\r\nheroic but often more dangerous distresses of taxation,--at the North a\r\nmagnanimity in victory unequaled in the traditions of men, and at the\r\nSouth a composure and dignity and absence of either bitterness or\r\nmeanness which brought out of defeat far larger treasures than could\r\nhave come with victory. But these were not effects without a cause. In\r\nthem all was only the fruit, the normal fruit, of the political habits,\r\nideals, traditions, whose early and unattractive disorders had chagrined\r\nmany of the best of Americans, and had seemed so natural to foreigners\r\nwho feared or distrusted a democracy. There had been forming, during\r\nforty or fifty years of a certain raw unloveliness, the peculiar and\r\npowerful self-reliance of a people whose political independence meant\r\nfar more than a mere separate government.\r\n\r\nIn these years Van Buren was one of the chief men in American public\r\nlife. He and his political associates had been profoundly affected by\r\nthe Jeffersonian philosophy of government. They robustly held its tenets\r\nuntil the flame and vengeance of the slavery conflict drove them from\r\npolitical power. In our own day we have, in the able speeches with which\r\nSamuel J. Tilden fatigued respectful though often unsympathetic hearers\r\nat Democratic meetings, heard something of the same robust political\r\nphilosophy, brought directly from intercourse with his famous neighbor\r\nand political master. Van Buren himself breathed it as the very\r\natmosphere of American public life, during his early career which had\r\njust begun when Jefferson, his robes of office dropped and his faults of\r\nadministration forgotten, seemed the serene, wise old man presiding\r\nover a land completely won to his ideals of democracy. Under this\r\nextraordinary influence and in this political light, there opened with\r\nthe first years of the century the public life to be narrated in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS.--PROFESSIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the American Revolution, Abraham Van Buren was a farmer\r\non the east bank of the Hudson River, New York. He was of Dutch descent,\r\nas was his wife, whose maiden name Hoes, corrupted from Goes, is said to\r\nhave had distinction in Holland. But it would be mere fancy to find in\r\nthe statesman particular traits brought from the dyked swamp lands\r\nwhence some of his ancestors came. Those who farmed the rich fields of\r\nColumbia county were pretty thorough Americans; their characteristics\r\nwere more immediately drawn from the soil they cultivated and from the\r\nnecessary habits of their life than from the lands, Dutch or English,\r\nfrom which their forefathers had emigrated. Late in the eighteenth\r\ncentury they were no longer frontiersmen. For a century and more this\r\neastern Hudson River country had been peacefully and prosperously\r\ncultivated. There was no lack of high spirit; but it was shown in\r\nlawsuits and political feuds rather than in skirmishes with red men. It\r\nwas close to the old town of Albany with its official and not\r\nundignified life, and had comparatively easy access to New York by sloop\r\nor the post-road. It had been an early settlement of the colony. Within\r\nits borders were now the estates and mansions of large landed\r\nproprietors, who inherited or acquired from a more varied and affluent\r\nlife some of the qualities, good and bad, of a country gentry. It was a\r\nregion of easy, orderly comfort, sound and robust enough, but not\r\nsharing the straight and precise, though meddling, puritanical habits\r\nwhich a few miles away, over the high Berkshire hills, had come from the\r\nshores of New England.\r\n\r\nThe elder Van Buren was said by his son's enemies to have kept a tavern;\r\nand he probably did. Farming and tavern-keeping then were fairly\r\ninterchangeable; and the gracious manner, the tact with men, which the\r\nyounger Van Buren developed to a marked degree, it is easy to believe\r\ncame rather from the social and varied life of an inn than from the\r\nharsher isolation of a farm. The statesman's boyish days were at any\r\nrate spent among poor neighbors. He was born at Kinderhook, an old\r\nvillage of New York, on the 5th of December, 1782. The usual years of\r\nschooling were probably passed in one of the dilapidated, weather-beaten\r\nschoolhouses from which has come so much of what is best in American\r\nlife. He studied later in the Kinderhook Academy, one of the higher\r\nschools which in New York have done good work, though not equaling the\r\nlike schools in Massachusetts. Here he learned a little Latin. But when\r\nat fourteen years of age he entered a law office, he had of course the\r\nchief discipline of book-learning still to acquire. In 1835 his campaign\r\nbiographer rather rejoiced that he had so little systematic education,\r\nfearing that \"from the eloquent pages of Livy, or the honeyed eulogiums\r\nof Virgil, or the servile adulation of Horace, he might have been\r\ninspired with an admiration for regal pomp and aristocratic dignity\r\nuncongenial to the native independence of his mind,\" and have imbibed a\r\n\"contempt for plebeians and common people,\" unless, perhaps, the\r\nspeeches of popular leaders in Livy \"had kindled his instinctive love of\r\njustice and freedom,\" or the sarcastic vigor of Tacitus \"had created in\r\nhis bosom a fixed hatred of tyranny in every shape.\" At an early age,\r\nhowever, it is certain that Van Buren, like many other Americans of\r\noriginal force and with instinctive fondness for written pictures of\r\nhuman history and conduct, acquired an education which, though not that\r\nof a professional scholar, was entirely appropriate to the skillful man\r\nof affairs or the statesman to be set in conspicuous places. This work\r\nmust have been largely done during the comparative leisure of his legal\r\napprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1796 that he entered the law office of Francis Sylvester at\r\nKinderhook, where he remained until his twentieth year. He there read\r\nlaw. It is safe to say besides that he swept the office, lighted the\r\nfires in winter, and, like other law students in earlier and simpler\r\ndays, had to do the work of an office janitor and errand boy, as well\r\nas to serve papers and copy the technical forms of the common law, and\r\nthe tedious but often masterly pleadings of chancery. That his work as a\r\nstudent was done with great industry and thoroughness is demonstrated by\r\nthe fact that at an early age he became a successful and skillful\r\nadvocate in arguments addressed to courts as distinguished from juries,\r\na division of professional work in which no skill and readiness will\r\nsupply deficiencies in professional equipment. His early reputation for\r\ncleverness is illustrated by the story that when only a boy he\r\nsuccessfully summed up a case before a jury against his preceptor\r\nSylvester, being made by the justice to stand upon a bench because he\r\nwas so small, with the exhortation, \"There, Mat, beat your master.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1802 Van Buren entered the office of William P. Van Ness, in the city\r\nof New York, to complete his seventh and final year of legal study. Van\r\nNess was himself from Columbia county and an eminent lawyer. He was\r\nafterwards appointed United States district judge by Madison; and was\r\nthen an influential Republican and a close friend and defender of Aaron\r\nBurr, then the vice-president. The native powers and fascination of Burr\r\nwere at their zenith, though his political character was blasted. Van\r\nBuren made his acquaintance, and was treated with the distinguished and\r\nflattering attention which the wisest of public men often show to young\r\nmen of promise. Van Buren's enemies were absurdly fond of the fancy that\r\nin this slight intercourse he had acquired the skill and grace of his\r\nmanner, and the easy principles and love of intrigue which they ascribe\r\nto him. Burr, for years after he was utterly disabled, inspired a\r\nchildish terror in American politics. The mystery and dread about him\r\nwere used by the opponents of Jackson because Burr had early pointed him\r\nout for the presidency, and by the opponents of Clay because in early\r\nlife he had given Burr professional assistance. But upon Burr's\r\ncandidacy for governor in 1804 Van Buren's freedom from his influence\r\nwas clearly enough exhibited.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 Van Buren, being now of age and admitted as an attorney,\r\nreturned to Kinderhook and there began the practice of his profession.\r\nThe rank of counsellor-at-law was still distinct and superior to that of\r\nattorney. His half-brother on his mother's side, James J. Van Alen, at\r\nonce admitted the young attorney to a law partnership. Van Alen was\r\nconsiderably older and had a practice already established. Van Buren's\r\ncareer as a lawyer was not a long one, but it was brilliant and highly\r\nsuccessful. After his election to the United States Senate in 1821 his\r\npractice ceased to be very active. He left his profession with a fortune\r\nwhich secured him the ease in money matters so helpful and almost\r\nnecessary to a man in public life. Merely professional reputations\r\ndisappear with curious and rather saddening promptness and completeness.\r\nOf the practice and distinction reached by Van Buren before he withdrew\r\nfrom the bar, although they were unsurpassed in the State, no vestige\r\nand few traditions remain beyond technical synopses of his arguments in\r\nthe instructive but hardly succulent pages of Johnson's, Wendell's, and\r\nCowen's reports.\r\n\r\nAt an early day the legal profession reached in our country a consummate\r\nvigor. Far behind as Americans were in other learning and arts, they\r\nhad, within a few years after they escaped colonial dependence, judges,\r\nadvocates, and commentators of the first rank. Marshall, Kent, and Story\r\nwere securely famous when hardly another American of their time not in\r\npublic and political life was known. In the legal art Americans were\r\neven more accomplished than in its science; and Columbia county and the\r\nvalley of the Hudson were fine fields for legal practice. Many\r\nanimosities survived from revolutionary days. The landed families, long\r\nused to administer the affairs of others as well as their own, saw with\r\njealousy and fear the rapid spread of democratic doctrines and of\r\nleveling and often insolent manners. Political feuds were rife, and\r\nfrequently appeared in the professionally profitable collisions of\r\nneighbors with vagrant cows, or on watercourses insufficient for the\r\nneeds of the up-stream and the down-stream proprietors. There were\r\nslander suits and libel suits, and suits for malicious prosecution. Into\r\nthe most legitimate controversies over doubts about property there was\r\ndriven the bitterness which turns a lawsuit from a process to ascertain\r\na right into a weapon of revenge.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's political opinions were strong and clear from the beginning\r\nof his law practice; but he was in a professional minority among the\r\nrich Federalists of the county. The adverse discipline was invaluable.\r\nThrough zeal and skill and large industry, he soon led the Republicans\r\nas their ablest lawyer, and the lawyers of Columbia county were famous.\r\nWilliam W. Van Ness, afterwards a judge of the supreme court of the\r\nState, Grosvenor, Elisha Williams, and Jacob R. Van Rensselaer were\r\nactive at the bar. Williams, although his very name is nowadays hardly\r\nknown, we cannot doubt from the universal testimony of contemporaries,\r\nhad extraordinary forensic talents. He was a Federalist; and the most\r\ndecisive proof of Van Buren's rapid professional growth was his\r\npromotion to be Williams's chief competitor and adversary. Van Buren's\r\nextraordinary application and intellectual clearness soon established\r\nhim as the better and the more successful lawyer, though not the more\r\npowerful advocate. Williams at last said to his rival, \"I get all the\r\nverdicts, and you get all the judgments.\" A famous pupil of Van Buren\r\nboth in law and in politics, Benjamin F. Butler, afterwards\r\nattorney-general in his cabinet, finely contrasted them from his own\r\nrecollection of their conflicts when he was a law student. \"Never,\" he\r\nsaid, \"were two men more dissimilar. Both were eloquent; but the\r\neloquence of Williams was declamatory and exciting, that of Van Buren\r\ninsinuating and delightful. Williams had the livelier imagination, Van\r\nBuren the sounder judgment. The former presented the strong points of\r\nhis case in bolder relief, invested them in a more brilliant coloring,\r\nindulged a more unlicensed and magnificent invective, and gave more life\r\nand variety to his arguments by his peculiar wit and inimitable humor.\r\nBut Van Buren was his superior in analyzing, arranging, and combining\r\nthe insulated materials, in comparing and weighing testimony, in\r\nunraveling the web of intricate affairs, in eviscerating truth from the\r\nmass of diversified and conflicting evidence, in softening the heart and\r\nmoulding it to his purpose, and in working into the judgments of his\r\nhearers the conclusions of his own perspicuous and persuasive\r\nreasonings.\" Most of this is applicable to Van Buren's career on the\r\nwider field of politics; and much here said of his early adversary on\r\nthe tobacco-stained floors of country court-houses might have been as\r\ntruly said of a later adversary of his, the splendid leader who, rather\r\nthan Harrison, ought to have been victor over Van Buren in 1840, and\r\nover whom Van Buren rather than Polk ought to have been victor in 1844.\r\n\r\nIn a few years Van Buren outgrew the professional limitations of\r\nKinderhook. In February, 1807, he had been admitted as a counsellor of\r\nthe supreme court; and this promotion he most happily celebrated by\r\nmarrying Hannah Hoes, a young lady of his own age, and also of Dutch\r\ndescent, a kinswoman of his mother, and with whom he had been intimate\r\nfrom his childhood. In 1808, the council of appointment becoming\r\nRepublican, he was made surrogate of Columbia county, succeeding his\r\npartner and half-brother Van Alen, a Federalist in politics, who was,\r\nhowever, returned to the place in 1815, when the Federalists regained\r\nthe council. The office was a respectable one, concerned with the\r\nprobate of wills, and the ordering of estates of deceased persons.\r\nWithin a year after this appointment, Van Buren removed to the new and\r\nbustling little city of Hudson, directly on the river banks. Here he\r\npracticed law with rapidly increasing success for seven years. His\r\npecuniary thrift now enabled him to purchase what was called \"a very\r\nextensive and well-selected library.\" With this advantage he applied\r\nhimself to \"a systematic and extended course of reading,\" which left him\r\na well, even an amply, educated man. His severity in study did not,\r\nhowever, exclude him from the social pleasures of which he was fond, and\r\nfor which he was perfectly fitted. He learned men quite as fast as he\r\nlearned books. A country surrogate, though then enjoying fees, since\r\ncommuted to a salary, had only a meagre compensation. But the duties of\r\nVan Buren's office did not interfere with his activity in the private\r\npractice of the law. On the contrary, the office enabled him to make\r\nacquaintances, a process which, even without adventitious aid, he always\r\nfound easy and delightful.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, having been elected a member of the Senate of the State, he\r\nbecame as such a member of the court for the correction of errors. This\r\nwas the court of last resort, composed, until 1847, of the chancellor,\r\nthe judges of the supreme court, the lieutenant-governor, and the\r\nthirty-two senators. The latter, though often laymen, were members of\r\nthe court, partly through a curious imitation of the theoretical\r\nfunction of the British House of Lords, and partly under the idea, even\r\nnow feebly surviving in some States, that some besides lawyers ought to\r\nsit upon the bench in law courts to contribute the common sense which it\r\nwas fancied might be absent from their more learned associates. It was\r\nnot found unsuitable for members of this, the highest court, to be\r\nactive legal practitioners. While Van Buren held his place as a member\r\nhe was, in February, 1815, made attorney-general, succeeding Abraham Van\r\nVechten, one of the famous lawyers of the State. Van Buren was then but\r\nthirty-two years old, and the professional eminence accorded to the\r\nstation was greater than now. Among near predecessors in it had been\r\nAaron Burr, Ambrose Spencer and Thomas Addis Emmett; among his near\r\nsuccessors were Thomas J. Oakley, Samuel A. Talcott, Greene C. Bronson\r\nand Samuel Beardsley,--all names of the first distinction in the\r\nprofessional life of New York. The office was of course political, as it\r\nhas always been, both in the United States and the mother country. But\r\nVan Buren's appointment, if it were made because he was an active and\r\ninfluential Republican in politics, would still not have been made\r\nunless his professional reputation had been high. The salary was $5.50 a\r\nday, with some costs,--not an unsuitable salary in days when the\r\nchancellor was paid but $3000 a year. He held the office until July,\r\n1819, when, upon the capture of the council of appointment by a\r\ncoalition of Clintonian Republicans and Federalists, he was removed to\r\ngive place to Oakley, the Federalist leader in the State Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 Van Buren, now rapidly reaching professional eminence, removed\r\nto Albany, the capital of New York. Though then a petty city of mean\r\nbuildings and about 10,000 inhabitants, it had a far larger relative\r\nimportance in the professional and social life of the State than has the\r\nlater city of ten times the population, with its costly and enormous\r\nstate-house, its beautiful public buildings, and its steep and numerous\r\nstreets of fine residences. In 1820 he purposed removing to New York;\r\nbut, for some reason altering his plans, continued to reside at Albany\r\nuntil appointed secretary of state in 1829. His professional career was\r\nthere crowned with most important and lucrative work. Soon after moving\r\nto Albany, he took into partnership Butler, just admitted to the bar.\r\nBetween the two men there were close and life-long relations. The\r\nyounger of them, also a son of Columbia county, reached great\r\nprofessional distinction, became a politician of the highest type, and\r\nremained steadfast in his attachment to Van Buren's political fortunes,\r\nand to the robust and distinctly marked political doctrines and\r\npractices of the Albany Regency.\r\n\r\nThe law reports give illustrations of Van Buren's precision, his clear\r\nand forcible common-sense, and his aptitude for that learning of the law\r\nin which the great counsel of the time excelled. In 1813, soon after his\r\nservice began as state senator, he delivered an opinion in a case of\r\n\"escape;\" and in very courteous words exhibited a bit of his dislike for\r\nKent, then chief justice of the supreme court, whose judgment he helped\r\nto reverse, as well as his antipathy to imprisonment for debt, which he\r\nafterwards helped to abolish. It was a petty suit against the sureties\r\nupon the bond given by a debtor. Under a relaxation of the imprisonment\r\nfor debt recently permitted, the debtor was, on giving the bond,\r\nreleased from jail, but upon the condition that he should keep within\r\nthe \"jail liberties,\" which in the country counties was a prescribed\r\narea around the jail. His bond was to be forfeit if he passed the\r\n\"liberties.\" While the debtor was driving a cow to or from pasture, the\r\nlatter contemptuously deviated \"four, six, or ten feet\" from the\r\nliberties. The driver, yielding to inevitable bucolic impulse and\r\nforgetting his bond, leaped over the imaginary line to bring back the\r\ncow. He was without the liberties but a moment, and afterwards duly kept\r\nwithin them. But the creditor was watchful, and for the technical\r\n\"escape\" sued the sureties. Although the debtor was within the limits\r\nwhen suit was brought, the lower court refused to pardon the debtor's\r\ntechnical and unintentional fault. At common law the creditor was\r\nentitled to satisfaction of the debtor's body; and the milder statute\r\nestablishing jail liberties was, the court said, to be strictly\r\nconstrued against the debtor; it was not enough that the creditor had\r\nthe debtor's body when he called for it. The supreme court, headed by\r\nKent, affirmed this curiously harsh decision. In the court of errors,\r\nVan Buren joined Chancellor Lansing in reversing the rule upon an\r\nelaborate review of the law, which to this day is important authority,\r\nand which could not have been more carefully done had something greater\r\nseemed at stake than a bovine vagary and a few dollars. The young\r\nlawyer, wearing for a time the judicial robes, now sat in a review, by\r\nno means unpleasant, of the utterances of magistrates before whom he had\r\nuntil then stood in considerable awe; and seized the opportunity,\r\ndoubtless with a keen perception of the drift of popular sentiment on\r\nmatters of personal liberty, to enlarge the mild policy of the later\r\nlaw. When it was urged that, if the law were not technically\r\nadministered, imprisoned debtors would of a Sunday wander beyond the\r\n\"limits,\" securely able to return before Monday, when the creditor could\r\nsue,--Van Buren, with a contemptuous fling at the supreme court,\r\nconfessed in Johnsonian sentences his lenient temper towards these\r\n\"stolen pleasures,\"--his willingness that debtors should snatch the \"few\r\nmoments of liberty which, although soured by constant perturbation and\r\nalarm, are, notwithstanding, deemed fit subjects for judicial\r\nanimadversion.\" His rhetoric was rather agreeably florid when he\r\ndeclared the law establishing \"jail liberties\" to be a concession for\r\nhumane purposes made by the inflexible spirit which authorized\r\nimprisonment for debt. He strongly intimated his sympathy to be with\r\n\"the exertions of men of intelligence, reflection, and philanthropy to\r\nmitigate its rigor; of men who viewed it as a practice fundamentally\r\nwrong, a practice which forces their fellow-creatures from society, from\r\ntheir friends, and their agonized families into the dreary walls of a\r\nprison; which compels them to leave all those fascinating endearments to\r\nbecome an inmate with vermin;\" and all this, not for crime or frauds,\r\n\"but for the misfortune of being poor, of being unable to satisfy the\r\nall-digesting stomach of some ravenous creditor.\" The practice was one\r\n\"confounding virtue and vice, and destroying the distinction between\r\nguilt and innocence which should unceasingly be cherished in every\r\nwell-regulated government.\" Democrats rejoiced over this passage when\r\nVan Buren was a candidate for the presidency. Richard M. Johnson, then\r\nhis associate upon the Democratic ticket, had successfully led an\r\nagitation for the abolition of such imprisonment upon judgments rendered\r\nin the federal courts.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's professional life terminated with his election as governor\r\nin 1828. In 1830, while secretary of state at Washington, he is said to\r\nhave appeared before the federal supreme court in the great litigation\r\nbetween Astor and the Sailors' Snug Harbor, in which he had been counsel\r\nbelow; but no record is preserved of his argument there. His last\r\nwell-known argument was before the court of errors at Albany in Varick\r\nv. Jackson, a branch of the famous Medcef Eden litigation. This long and\r\nhighly technical battle was lighted up by the fame and competitions of\r\nthe counsel. It arose upon the question whether a will of Eden which\r\ngave a landed estate to his son Joseph, but if Joseph died without\r\nchildren, then to his surviving brother, Medcef Eden the younger,\r\ncreated for Joseph the old lawyers' delight of an \"estate tail.\" If it\r\nwere an \"estate tail,\" then the law of 1782, which, in the general\r\ntendency of American legislation after the Revolution, was directed\r\nagainst the entailing of property, would have made the first brother,\r\nJoseph, the absolute owner, and have defeated the later claim of Medcef.\r\nJoseph had failed while in possession of the property. His creditors,\r\naccepting the opinion of Alexander Hamilton, then the head of the bar,\r\ninsisted that he had been the absolute owner, that the provision for his\r\nbrother Medcef's accession to the property was nugatory as an attempt to\r\nentail the estate; and upon this view the creditors sold the lands,\r\nwhich by the rapid growth of the city soon became of large value.\r\nHamilton's opinion for years daunted the younger Medcef and his children\r\nfrom asserting the right which it was morally plain his father had\r\nintended for him. Aaron Burr, not less Hamilton's rival at the bar than\r\nin the politics of New York, gave a contrary opinion; but after killing\r\nHamilton in 1804 and yielding up the vice-presidency in 1805, his\r\nbrilliant professional gifts were exiled from New York. On his return in\r\n1812 from years of conspiracy, adventure, and romance, he took up the\r\ndiscredited Medcef Eden claim; and in the judicial test of the question\r\nhe, and not Hamilton, proved to have been correct. The struggle went on\r\nin a number of suits; and when in 1823 the question was to be finally\r\nsettled in the court of last resort, Burr, fearing, as he himself\r\nintimated to the court, lest the profound suspicion under which he\r\nrested might obscure and break the force of his legal arguments, or\r\nconscious that his past twenty years had dimmed his faculties, called to\r\nhis aid Van Buren, then United States senator and a chief of the\r\nprofession. As Van Buren and Burr attended together before the court of\r\nerrors, they doubtless recalled their meetings in Van Ness's office\r\ntwenty years before, when Burr, still a splendid though clouded figure\r\nin American life, hoped, by Federalist votes added to the Republican\r\nsecession which he led, to reach the governorship and recover his\r\nprestige; those days in which the unknown but promising young countryman\r\nhad interested a vice-president and enjoyed the latter's skillful and\r\nnot always insincere flattery. The firm and orderly procedure of Van\r\nBuren's life was now well contrasted with the discredited and profligate\r\nability of the returned wanderer. Against this earlier but long\r\ndeposed, and against this later and regnant chief in the Republican\r\npolitics of New York, were ranged in these cases David B. Ogden, the\r\nfamous lawyer of the Federalist ranks, Samuel A. Talcott, and Samuel\r\nJones. In Van Buren's long, masterly, and successful argument there was\r\nagain an edge to the zeal with which he attacked the opinion of Kent,\r\nthe Federalist chancellor, who asked the court of errors to overrule its\r\nearlier decisions, and the chancellor's own decision as well, and defeat\r\nthe intention of the elder Medcef Eden.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's professional career was most enviable. It lasted twenty-five\r\nyears. It ended before he was forty-six, when he was in the early\r\nripeness of his powers, but not until a larger and more shining career\r\nseemed surely opened before him. He left the bar with a competence\r\nfairly earned, which his prudence and skill made grow into an ample\r\nfortune, without even malicious suggestion in the scurrility of politics\r\nthat he had profited out of public offices. In money matters he was more\r\nthrifty and cautious than most Americans in public places. His enemies\r\naccused him of meanness and parsimony, but apparently without other\r\nreason than that he did not practice the careless and useless profusion\r\nand luxury which many of his countrymen in political life have thought\r\nnecessary to indulge even when their own tastes were far simpler. In the\r\ncourse of professional employment he acquired an important estate near\r\nOswego, whose value rapidly enhanced with the rapid growth of western\r\nNew York and the development of the lake commerce from that port.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest now found in Van Buren's professional career lies in\r\nits relation to his political life. He was the only lawyer of\r\nconspicuous and practical and really great professional success who has\r\nreached the White House. In the long preparation for the bar, in the\r\nmany hours of leisure at Kinderhook and Hudson and even Albany permitted\r\nby the methods of practice in vogue before there were railways or\r\ntelegraphs, and when travel was costly and slow and postage a shilling\r\nor more, he gained the liberal education more difficult of access to the\r\nbusier young attorney and counsel of these crowded days. Great lawyers\r\nwere then fond of illustrations from polite literature; they loved to\r\nset off their speeches with quotations from the classics, and to give\r\ntheir style finish and ornament not practicable to the precise, prompt\r\nmethods which their successors learn in the driving routine of modern\r\nAmerican cities. Van Buren did not, however, become a great orator at\r\nthe bar. His admirer, Butler, upon returning to partnership with him in\r\n1820, wrote indeed to an intimate friend, Jesse Hoyt (destined\r\nafterwards to bring grief and scandal upon both the partners), that if\r\nhe were Van Buren he \"would let politics alone,\" and become, as Van\r\nBuren might, the \"Erskine of the State.\" But though his success, had he\r\ncontinued in the profession, would doubtless have been of the very first\r\norder, his oratory would never have reached the warm and virile\r\nsplendor of Erskine, or the weighty magnificence of Webster. Van Buren's\r\nwork as a lawyer brought him, however, something besides wealth and the\r\neducation and refinement of books, and something which neither Erskine\r\nnor Webster gained. The profession afforded him an admirable discipline\r\nin the conduct of affairs; and affairs, in the law as out of it, are\r\nlargely decided by human nature and its varying peculiarities. The\r\npreparation of details; the keen and far-sighted arrangement of the\r\nbest, because the most practicable, plan; the refusal to fire off\r\nammunition for the popular applause to be roused by its noise and flame;\r\nthe clear, steady bearing in mind of the end to be accomplished, rather\r\nthan the prolonged enjoyment or systematic working out of intermediate\r\nprocesses beyond a utilitarian necessity,--all these elements Van Buren\r\nmastered in a signal degree, and made invaluable in legal practice. To\r\nmen more superbly equipped for _tours de force_, who ignored the uses of\r\nlong, attentive, varied, painstaking work, there was nothing admirable\r\nin the methods which Van Buren brought into political life out of his\r\nexperience in the law. He was, to undisciplined or envious opponents, a\r\n\"little magician,\" a trickster. The same thing appears, in every\r\ndepartment of human activity, in the anger which failure often flings at\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe predominance of lawyers in our politics was very early established,\r\nand has been a characteristic distinction between politics in England\r\nand politics in America. Conspicuous as lawyers have been in the\r\npolitics of the older country, they have rarely been figures of the\r\nfirst rank. They have served in all its modern ministries, and sometimes\r\nin other than professional stations; but, with the unimportant exception\r\nof Perceval, not as the chief. English opinion has not unjustly believed\r\nits greater landed proprietors to be animated with a strong and peculiar\r\ndesire for English greatness and renown; nor has the belief been\r\ndestroyed by their frequent opposition to the most beneficent popular\r\nmovements. Among these proprietors and those allied with them, even when\r\nnot strictly in their ranks, England has found her statesmen. To this\r\nday, the speech of a lawyer in the British House of Commons is fancied\r\nto show the narrowness of technical training, or is treated as a bid for\r\npromotion to some of the splendid seats open to the English bar. In\r\nAmerica, the great landed proprietor very early lost the direction of\r\npublic affairs. All the members of the \"Virginian dynasty\" were, it is\r\ntrue, large land-owners, and in the politics of New York there were\r\nseveral of them. But land-ownership was to Jefferson, Madison, and\r\nMonroe simply a means of support while they attended to public affairs;\r\nit was not one of their chief recommendations to the landed interest\r\nthroughout the country. For a time in the early politics of New York the\r\nlanded wealth of the Schuylers, Van Rensselaers, and Livingstons was of\r\nitself a source of strength; but in the spread of democratic sentiment\r\nit was found that to be a great landlord was entirely consistent with\r\ndullness, narrowness, and timid selfishness. Among the landlords there\r\nsoon and inevitably decayed that sense of public obligation belonging to\r\nexalted position and leadership which sometimes brings courage, high\r\npublic spirit, and even a sound and active political imagination, to\r\nthose who preside over bodies of tenants. The laws were changed which\r\nfacilitated family accumulations of land. Since these early years of the\r\ncentury a great land-owner has been in politics little more than any\r\nother rich man. Both have had advantages in that as in any other field\r\nof activity. Certain easy graces not uncommon to inherited wealth have\r\noften been popular,--not, however, for the wealth, but for themselves.\r\nWhere these graces have existed in America without such wealth, they\r\nhave been none the less popular; but in England a lifetime of vast\r\npublic service and the finest personal attainments have failed to\r\novercome the distrust of a landless man as a sort of adventurer.\r\n\r\nWhen Van Buren's career began, the men who were making money in trade or\r\nmanufactures were generally too busy for the anxious and busy cares of\r\npublic life; the tradesmen and manufacturers who had already made money\r\nwere past the time of life when men can vigorously and skillfully turn\r\nto a new and strange calling. There was no leisure class except\r\nland-owners or retired men of business. Lawyers, far more than those of\r\nany other calling, became public men, and naturally enough. Their\r\nexperience of life and their knowledge of men were large. The popular\r\ninterest in their art of advocacy; their travels from county seat to\r\ncounty seat; their speeches to juries in towns where no other secular\r\npublic speaking was to be heard; the varieties of human life which\r\nlawyers came to know,--varieties far greater where the same men acted as\r\nattorneys and advocates than in England where they acted in only one of\r\nthese fields,--these and the like, combined with the equipment for the\r\nforms of political and governmental work which was naturally gained in\r\nlegal practice and the systematic study of law, gave to distinguished\r\nlawyers in America their large place in its political life. For this\r\nplace the liberality of their lives helped, besides, to fit them. They\r\nhad ceased to be disqualified for it by their former close alliance, as\r\nin England, with the landed aristocracy; and they had not yet begun to\r\nsuffer a disqualification, frequently unjust, for their close relations\r\nwith corporate interests, between which and the public there often\r\narises an antagonism of interests. De Tocqueville, after his visit in\r\n1832, said that lawyers formed in America its highest political class\r\nand the most cultivated circle of society; that the American aristocracy\r\nwas not composed of the rich, but that it occupied the judicial bench\r\nand the bar. And the descriptions of the liberal and acute though\r\ntheoretical Frenchman are generally trustworthy, however often his\r\nstriking generalizations are at fault. Such, then, was the intimacy of\r\nrelations between the professions of law and politics when Van Buren\r\nshone in both. And when, in his early prime, he gave up the law, neither\r\nforensic habits nor those of the attorney were yet too strongly set to\r\npermit the easy and complete diversion of his powers to the more\r\ngenerous and exalted activity of public life.\r\n\r\nIt is simpler thus separately to treat Van Buren's life as a lawyer,\r\nbecause in a just view of the man it must be subordinate to his life as\r\na politician. It is to be remembered, however, that in his earlier years\r\nhis progress in politics closely attended in time, and in much more than\r\ntime, his professional progress. When, at thirty, he sat as an appellate\r\njudge in the court of errors, he was already powerful in politics; when,\r\nat thirty-two, he was attorney-general, he was the leader of his party\r\nin the state senate; when, at forty-five, he had perhaps the most\r\nlucrative professional practice in New York, he was the leader of his\r\nparty in the United States Senate. But it will be easier to follow his\r\npolitical career without interruption from his work as a lawyer,\r\nhonorable and distinguished as it was, and much of his political ability\r\nas he owed to its fine discipline.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's domestic life was broken up by the death of his wife at\r\nAlbany, in February, 1819, leaving him four sons. To her memory Van\r\nBuren remained scrupulously loyal until his own death forty-three years\r\nafterwards. We may safely believe political enemies when, after saying\r\nof him many dastardly things, they admitted that he had been an\r\naffectionate husband. Nor were accusations ever made against the\r\nuprightness and purity of his private life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSTATE SENATOR.--ATTORNEY-GENERAL.--MEMBER OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL\r\nCONVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe politics of New York State were never more bitter, never more\r\npersonal, than when Van Buren entered the field in 1803. The Federalists\r\nwere sheltered by the unique and noble prestige of Washington's name;\r\nand were conscious that in wealth, education, refinement, they far\r\nexcelled the Republicans. They were contemptuously suspicious of the\r\nunlettered ignorance, the intense and exuberant vanity, of the masses of\r\nAmerican men. It was by that contempt and suspicion that they invited\r\nthe defeat which, protected though they were by the property\r\nqualifications required of voters in New York, they met in 1800 at the\r\nhands of a people in whom the instincts of democracy were strong and\r\nunsubmissive. This was in our history the one complete and final defeat\r\nof a great national party while in power. The Federalists themselves\r\nmade it final,--by their silly and unworthy anger at a political\r\nreverse; by their profoundly immoral efforts to thwart the popular will\r\nand make Burr president; by their fatal and ingrained disbelief in\r\ncommon men, who, they thought, foolishly and impiously refused to\r\naccept wisdom and guidance from the possessors of learning and great\r\nestates; and finally by their unpatriotic opposition to Jefferson and\r\nMadison in the assertion of American rights on the seas during the\r\nNapoleonic wars. All these drove the party, in spite of its large\r\nservices in the past and its eminent capacity for service in the future,\r\nforever from the confidence of the American people. The Federalists\r\nmaintained, it is true, a party organization in New York until after the\r\nsecond war with England; but their efforts were rather directed to the\r\ndivision and embarrassment of their adversaries than to victories of\r\ntheir own strength or upon their own policy. They carried the lower\r\nhouse of the legislature in 1809, 1812, and 1813. There were among them\r\nmen of the first rank, who retained a strong hold on popular respect,\r\namong whom John Jay and Rufus King were deservedly shining figures. But\r\nnever after 1799 did the Federalists elect in New York a governor, or\r\ncontrol both legislative houses, or secure any solid power, except by\r\ncoalition with one branch or another of the Republicans.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's fondness for politics was soon developed. His father was\r\nfirmly attached to the Jeffersonians or Republicans,--a rather\r\ndiscredited minority among the Federalists of Columbia county and the\r\nestates of the Hudson River aristocracy. Inheriting his political\r\npreferences, Van Buren, with a great body of other young Americans,\r\ncaught the half-doctrinaire enthusiasm which Jefferson then inspired, an\r\nenthusiasm which in Van Buren was to be so enduring a force, and to\r\nwhich sixty years later he was still as loyal as he had been in the hot\r\ndisputes on the sanded floors of the village store or tavern. During\r\nthese boyish years he wrote and spoke for his party; and before he was\r\neighteen he was formally appointed a delegate to a Republican convention\r\nfor Columbia and Rensselaer counties.\r\n\r\nVan Buren returned from New York to Columbia county late in 1803, just\r\ntwenty-one years old. At once he became active in politics. The\r\nRepublican party, though not strong in his county, was dominant in the\r\nState; and the game of politics was played between its different\r\nfactions, the Federalists aiding one or the other as they saw their\r\nadvantage. The Republicans were Clintonians, Livingstonians, or\r\nBurrites. George Clinton, in whose career lay the great origin of party\r\npolitics of New York, was the Republican leader. The son of an Irish\r\nimmigrant, he had, without the aid of wealth or influential connections,\r\nmade himself the most popular man in the State. He was the first\r\ngovernor after colonial days were over, and was repeatedly reëlected. It\r\nwas his opposition which most seriously endangered New York's adoption\r\nof the Federal Constitution. But in spite of the wide enthusiasm which\r\nthe completed Union promptly aroused, this opposition did not prevent\r\nhis reëlection in 1789 and 1792. The majorities were small, however, it\r\nbeing even doubtful whether in the latter year the majority were fairly\r\ngiven him. In 1795 he declined to be a candidate, and Robert R.\r\nLivingston, the Republican in his place, was defeated. In 1801 Clinton\r\nwas again elected. Later he was vice-president in Jefferson's second\r\nterm and Madison's first term; and his aspiration to the presidency in\r\n1808 was by no means unreasonable. He was a strong party leader and a\r\nsincerely patriotic man. The Livingston family interest in New York was\r\nvery great. The chancellor, Robert R. Livingston, who nowadays is\r\npopularly associated with the ceremony of Washington's inauguration, had\r\nbeen secretary for foreign affairs under the Articles of Confederation,\r\nand had left the Federalists in 1790. After his sixty years had under\r\nthe law disqualified him for judicial office, he became Jefferson's\r\nminister to France and negotiated with Bonaparte the Louisiana treaty.\r\nBrockholst Livingston was a judge of the Supreme Court of New York in\r\n1801. In 1807 Jefferson promoted him to the federal Supreme Court.\r\nEdward Livingston, younger than his brother, the chancellor, by\r\nseventeen years, was long after to be one of the finest characters in\r\nour politics. Early in Washington's administration he had become a\r\nstrong pro-French Republican, and had opposed Jay's treaty with Great\r\nBritain; though forty years later, when Jackson brought him from\r\nLouisiana to be secretary of state, he was sometimes reminded of his\r\nstill earlier Federalism. Morgan Lewis, judge of the Supreme Court and\r\nafterwards chief justice, and still later governor, was a brother-in-law\r\nof the chancellor. Smith Thompson, also a judge and chief justice, and\r\nlater secretary of the navy under Monroe and a judge of the federal\r\nSupreme Court, and Van Buren's competitor for governor in 1828, was a\r\nconnection of the family. There were sneers at the Livingston conversion\r\nto Democracy as there always are at political conversions. But whether\r\nor not Chancellor Livingston's Democracy came from jealousy of Hamilton\r\nin 1790, it is at least certain that he and his family connections\r\nrendered political services of the first importance during a half\r\ncentury. The drafting of Jackson's nullification proclamation in 1833 by\r\nEdward Livingston was one of the noblest and most signal services which\r\nAmericans have had the fortune to render to their country.\r\n\r\nThe best offices were largely held by the Clinton and Livingston\r\nfamilies and their connections, an arrangement very aristocratic indeed,\r\nbut which did not then seem inconsistent with efficient and decorous\r\nperformance of the public business. Burr naturally gathered around him\r\nthose restless, speculative men who are as immoral in their aspirations\r\nas in their conduct, and whose adherence has disgraced and weakened\r\nalmost every democratic movement known to history. Burr had been\r\nattorney-general; he had refused a seat in the Supreme Court; he had\r\nbeen United States senator; and now in the second office of the nation\r\nhe presided with distinguished grace over the Federal Senate. His hands\r\nwere not yet red with Hamilton's blood when Van Buren met him at New\r\nYork in 1803; but Democratic faces were averted from the man who, loaded\r\nwith its honors and enjoying its confidence, had intrigued with its\r\nenemies to cheat his exultant party out of their choice for president.\r\nIn tribute to the Republicans of New York, George Clinton had already\r\nbeen selected in his place to be the next vice-president. While Van\r\nBuren was near the close of his law studies at New York, Burr was\r\npreparing to restore his fortunes by a popular election, for which he\r\nhad some Republican support, and to which the fatuity of the defeated\r\nparty, again rejecting Hamilton's advice, added a considerable\r\nFederalist support. William P. Van Ness, as \"Aristides,\" one of the\r\nclassical names under which our ancestors were fond of addressing the\r\npublic, had in the Burr interest written a bitter attack on the Clintons\r\nand Livingstons, accusing them, and with reason, of dividing the offices\r\nbetween themselves.\r\n\r\nVan Buren was easily proof against the allurements of Burr, and even the\r\nnatural influence of so distinguished a man as Van Ness, with whom he\r\nhad been studying a year. Sylvester, his first preceptor, was a\r\nFederalist. So was Van Alen, his half-brother, soon to be his partner,\r\nwho in May, 1806, was elected to Congress. But Van Buren was firm and\r\nresolute in party allegiance. In the election for governor in April,\r\n1804, Burr was badly beaten by Morgan Lewis, the Clinton-Livingston\r\ncandidate, whom Van Buren warmly supported, and Burr's political career\r\nwas closed. The successful majority of the Republicans was soon resolved\r\ninto the Clintonians, led by Clinton and Judge Ambrose Spencer, and the\r\nLivingstonians, led by Governor Lewis. The active participation of\r\njudges in the bitter politics of the time illustrates the universal\r\nintensity of political feeling, and goes very far to justify Jefferson's\r\nand Van Buren's distrust of judicial opinions on political questions.\r\nBrockholst Livingston, Smith Thompson, Ambrose Spencer, Daniel D.\r\nTompkins,--all judges of the State Supreme Court,--did not cease when\r\nthey donned the ermine to be party politicians; neither did the\r\nchancellors Robert R. Livingston and Lansing. Even Kent, it is pretty\r\nobvious, was a man of far stronger and more openly partisan feelings\r\nthan we should to-day think fitting so great a judicial station as he\r\nheld. The quarrels over offices were strenuous and increasing from the\r\nvery top to the bottom of the community.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists in 1807 generally joined the Lewisites, or \"Quids.\"\r\nGovernor Lewis, finding that the jealousy of the Livingston interests\r\nwould defeat his renomination by the usual caucus of Republican members\r\nof the legislature, became the candidate of a public meeting at New\r\nYork, and of a minority caucus, and asked help from the Federalists.\r\nSuch an alliance always seemed monstrous only to the Republican faction\r\nthat felt strong enough without it. The regular legislative caucus,\r\ncontrolled by the Clintonians, nominated Daniel D. Tompkins, then a\r\njudge of the Supreme Court, and for years after the Republican\r\n\"war-horse.\" Van Buren adhered to the purer, older, and less patrician\r\nDemocracy of the Clintonians. Tompkins was elected, with a Clintonian\r\nlegislature; and the result secured Van Buren's first appointment to\r\npublic office. A Clintonian council of appointment was chosen. The\r\ncouncil, a complex monument of the distrust of executive power with\r\nwhich George III. had filled his revolted subjects, was composed of five\r\nmembers, being the governor and one member from each of the four\r\nsenatorial districts, who were chosen by the Assembly from among the six\r\nsenators of the district. The four senatorial members of the council\r\nwere always, therefore, of the political faith of the Assembly, except\r\nin cases where all the senators from a district belonged to the minority\r\nparty in the Assembly. To this council belonged nearly every appointment\r\nin the State, even of local officers. Prior to 1801 the governor\r\nappointed, with the advice and consent of the council. After the\r\nconstitutional amendment of that year, either member of the council\r\ncould nominate, the appointment being made by the majority. Van Buren\r\nbecame surrogate of Columbia county on February 20, 1808. There was no\r\nprescribed term of office, the commission really running until the\r\nopposition party secured the council of appointment. Van Buren held the\r\noffice about five years and until his removal on March 19, 1813, when\r\nhis adversaries had secured control of the council.\r\n\r\nAt this time the system of removing the lesser as well as the greater\r\nofficers of government for political reasons was well established in New\r\nYork. It is impossible to realize the nature of Van Buren's political\r\neducation without understanding this old system of proscription, whose\r\ninfluence upon American public life has been so prodigious. The strife\r\nover the Federal Constitution had been fierce. Its friends, after their\r\nvictory, sought, neither unjustly nor unnaturally, to punish Governor\r\nClinton for his opposition. Although Washington wished to stand neutral\r\nbetween parties, he still believed it politically suicidal to appoint\r\nofficers not in sympathy with his administration.[1] Hamilton\r\nundoubtedly determined the New York appointments when the new government\r\nwas launched, and they were made from the political enemies of Governor\r\nClinton,--a course provoking an animosity which not improbably appeared\r\nin the more numerous state appointments controlled by Clinton and the\r\nRepublican council. After the excesses of the French Revolution the\r\nRepublicans were denounced as Jacobins and radicals, dangerous in\r\npolitics and corrupt in morals. The family feuds aided and exaggerated\r\nthe divisions in this small community of freehold voters. Appointments\r\nwere made in the federal and state services for political reasons and\r\nfor family reasons, precisely as they had long been made in England.\r\nEspecially along the rich river counties from New York to the upper\r\nHudson were so distributed the lucrative offices, which were eagerly\r\nsought for their profit as well as for their honor.\r\n\r\nThe contests were at first for places naturally vacated by death or\r\nresignation; the idea of the property right of an incumbent actually in\r\noffice lingered until after the last century was out. It is not clear\r\nwhen the first removals of subordinate officers took place for political\r\nreasons. Some were made by the Federalists during Governor Jay's\r\nadministration; but the first extensive removals seem to have occurred\r\nafter the elections of 1801. For this there were two immediate causes.\r\nIn that year the exclusive nominating power of the governor was taken\r\nfrom him. Each of the other four members of the council of appointment\r\ncould now nominate as well as confirm. Appointments and removals were\r\nmade, therefore, from that year until the new Constitution of 1821, by\r\none of the worst of appointing bodies, a commission of several men\r\nwhose consultations were secret and whose responsibility was divided.\r\nSystematic abuse of the power of appointment became inevitable. There\r\nwas, besides, a second reason in the anger against Federalists, which\r\nthey had gone far to provoke, and against their long and by no means\r\ngentle domination. This anger induced the Republicans to seek out every\r\nmethod of punishment. But for this, the abuse might have been long\r\ndeferred. Nor is it unlikely that the refusal of Jefferson, inaugurated\r\nin March of that year, to make a \"clean sweep\" of his enemies, turned\r\nthe longing eyes of embittered Republicans in New York more eagerly to\r\nthe fat state offices enjoyed by their insolent adversaries of the past\r\ntwelve years.\r\n\r\nThe Clintons and Livingstons had led the Republicans to a victory at the\r\nstate election in April, 1801. Later in that year George Clinton, now\r\nagain governor, called together the new council with the nominating\r\npower vested in every one of its five members. This council acted under\r\ndistinguished auspices, and it deserves to be long remembered. Governor\r\nClinton presided, and his famous nephew, De Witt Clinton, was below him\r\nin the board. The latter represented the Clintonian Republicans.[2]\r\nAmbrose Spencer, a man of great parts and destined to a notable career,\r\nrepresented the Livingstons, of whom he was a family connection.\r\nRoseboom, the other Republican, was easily led by his two abler party\r\nassociates. The fifth member did not count, for he was a Federalist. Two\r\nof the three really distinguished men of this council, De Witt Clinton\r\nand Ambrose Spencer, it is not unjust to say, first openly and\r\nresponsibly established in New York the \"spoils system\" by removals, for\r\npolitical reasons, of officers not political. The term of office of the\r\nfour senatorial members of this council had commenced while the\r\nillustrious Federalist John Jay was governor; but they rejected his\r\nnominations until he was tired of making them, and refused to call them\r\ntogether. When Clinton took the governor's seat, he promptly summoned\r\nthe board, and in August, 1801, the work began. De Witt Clinton publicly\r\nformulated the doctrine, but it did not yet reach its extreme form. He\r\nsaid that the principal executive offices in the State ought to be\r\nfilled by the friends of the administration, and the more unimportant\r\noffices ought to be proportionately distributed between the two parties.\r\nThe council rapidly divided the chief appointments among the Clintons\r\nand Livingstons and their personal supporters. Officers were selected\r\nwhom Jay had refused to appoint. Edward Livingston, the chancellor's\r\nbrother, was given the mayoralty of New York, a very profitable as well\r\nas important station; Thomas Tillotson, a brother-in-law of Chancellor\r\nLivingston, was made secretary of state, in place of Daniel Hale,\r\nremoved; John V. Henry, a distinguished Federalist lawyer, was removed\r\nfrom the comptrollership; the district attorney, the clerk and the\r\nrecorder of New York were removed; William Coleman, the founder of the\r\n\"Evening Post,\" and a strong adherent of Hamilton, was turned out of the\r\nclerkship of the Circuit Court. And so the work went on through minor\r\noffices. New commissions were required by the Constitution to be issued\r\nto the puisne judges of the county courts and to justices of the peace\r\nthroughout the State once in three years. Instead of renewing the\r\ncommissions and preserving continuity in the administration of justice,\r\nthe council struck out the names of Federalists and inserted those of\r\nRepublicans. The proceedings of this council of 1801 have profoundly\r\naffected the politics of New York to this day. Few political bodies in\r\nAmerica have exercised as serious and lasting an influence upon the\r\npolitical habits of the nation. The tradition that Van Buren and the\r\nAlbany Regency began political proscription is untrue. The system of\r\nremovals was thus established several years before Van Buren held his\r\nfirst office. Its founders, De Witt Clinton and Ambrose Spencer, were\r\nlong his political enemies. Governor Clinton, whose honorable record it\r\nwas that during the eighteen years of his governorship he had never\r\nconsented to a political removal, entered his protest--not a very hearty\r\none, it is to be feared--in the journal of the council; but in vain. In\r\nthe next year the two chief offenders were promoted,--De Witt Clinton\r\nto be United States senator in the place of General Armstrong, a\r\nbrother-in-law of Chancellor Livingston, and Ambrose Spencer to be\r\nattorney-general; and two years later Spencer became a judge of the\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\nAfter the removals there began a disintegration of the party hitherto\r\nsuccessfully led by Burr, the Clintons, and the Livingstons. Colonel\r\nSwartwout, Burr's friend, was called by De Witt Clinton a liar,\r\nscoundrel and villain; although, after receiving two bullets from\r\nClinton's pistol in a duel, he was assured by the latter, with the\r\ncourtesy of our grandfathers, that there was no personal animosity.\r\nBurr's friends had of course to be removed. But in 1805, after the\r\nClintons and the Livingstons had united in the election of Lewis as\r\ngovernor over Burr, they too quarreled,--and naturally enough, for the\r\noffices would not go around. So, after the Clintonians on the meeting of\r\nthe legislature early in 1806 had captured the council, they turned upon\r\ntheir recent allies. Maturin Livingston was removed from the New York\r\nrecordership, and Tillotson from his place as secretary of state. The\r\nwork was now done most thoroughly. Sheriffs, clerks, surrogates, county\r\njudges, justices of the peace, had to go. But at the corporation\r\nelection in New York in the same year, the Livingstonians and\r\nFederalists, with a majority of the common council, in their fashion\r\nrighted the wrong, and, with a vigor not excelled by their successors a\r\nhalf century later, removed at once all the subordinate municipal\r\nofficers subject to their control who were Clintonians. In 1807 the\r\nLivingstonian Republicans, or, as they were now called from the\r\ngovernor, the Lewisites, with the Federalists and Burrites, secured\r\ncontrol of the state council; and proceeded promptly to the work of\r\nremovals, defending it as a legitimate return for the proscriptive\r\ncourse of their predecessors. In 1808 the Clintonians returned to the\r\ncouncil, and, through its now familiar labors, to the offices from which\r\nthe Lewisites were in their turn driven. In 1810 the Federalists\r\ncontrolled the Assembly which chose the council; and they enjoyed a\r\n\"clean sweep\" as keenly as had the contending Republican factions. But\r\nthe election of this year, the political record tells us, taught a\r\nlesson which politicians have ever since refused to learn, perhaps\r\nbecause it has not always been taught. The removal of the Republicans\r\nfrom office \"had the natural tendency to call out all their forces.\" The\r\nClintonians in 1811, therefore, were enabled by the people to reverse\r\nthe Federalist proscription of 1810. The Federalists, again in power in\r\n1813, again followed the uniform usage then twelve years old. Political\r\nremovals had become part of the unwritten law.\r\n\r\nAt this time Van Buren suffered the loss of his office as surrogate, but\r\ndoubtless without any sense of private or public wrong. It was the\r\ncustomary fate of war. In 1812 he was nominated for state senator from\r\nthe middle district, composed of Columbia, Dutchess, Orange, Ulster,\r\nDelaware, Chenango, Greene, and Sullivan counties, as the candidate of\r\nthe Clintonian Republicans against Edward P. Livingston, the candidate\r\nof the Lewisites or Livingstonians and Burrites as well as the\r\nFederalists. Livingston was the sitting member, and a Republican of\r\npowerful family and political connections. Van Buren, not yet thirty,\r\ndefeated him by a majority of less than two hundred out of twenty\r\nthousand votes. In November, 1812, he took his seat at Albany, and\r\neasily and within a few months reached a conspicuous and powerful place\r\nin state politics.\r\n\r\nThese details of the establishment of the \"spoils system\" in New York\r\npolitics seem necessary to be told, that Van Buren's own participation\r\nin the wrong may be fairly judged. It is a common historical vice to\r\njudge the conduct of men of earlier times by standards which they did\r\nnot know. Van Buren found thoroughly and universally established at\r\nAlbany, when he entered its life, the rule that, upon a change in the\r\nexecutive, there should be a change in the offices, without reference to\r\ntheir political functions. He had in his own person experienced its\r\noperation both to his advantage and to his disadvantage. Federalists and\r\nRepublicans were alike committed to the rule. The most distinguished and\r\nthe most useful men in active public life, whatever their earlier\r\nopinion might have been, had acquiesced and joined in the practice. Nor\r\nwas the practice changed or extended after Van Buren came into state\r\npolitics. It continued as it had thus begun, until he became a national\r\nfigure. Success in it required an ability and skill of which he was an\r\neasy master; nor does he seem to have shrunk from it. But he was neither\r\nmore nor less reprehensible than the universal public sense about him.\r\nFor it must be remembered that the \"spoils system\" was not then\r\noffensive to the more enlightened citizens of New York. The system was\r\nno excess of democracy or universal suffrage. It had arisen amidst a\r\nsuffrage for governor and senators limited to those who held in freehold\r\nland worth at least £100, and for assemblymen limited to those who held\r\nin freehold land worth £20, or paid a yearly rent of forty shillings,\r\nand who were rated and actually paid taxes. It was practiced by men of\r\naristocratic habits chosen by the well-to-do classes. It grew in the\r\ndisputes of great family interests, and in the bitterness of popular\r\nelements met in a new country, still strange or even foreign to one\r\nanother, and permitted by their release from the dangers of war and the\r\nfear of British oppression to indulge their mutual dislikes.\r\n\r\nThe frequent \"rotation\" in office which was soon to be pronounced a\r\nsafeguard of republican institutions, and which Jackson in December,\r\n1829, told Congress was a \"leading principle in the Republicans' creed,\"\r\nwas by no means an unnatural step towards an improvement of the civil\r\nservice of the State. Reformers of our day lay great stress upon the\r\nfundamental rule of democratic government, that a public office is\r\nsimply a trust for the people; and they justly find the chief argument\r\nagainst the abuses of patronage in the notorious use of office for the\r\nbenefit of small portions of the people, to the detriment of the rest.\r\nIn England, however, for centuries (and to some extent the idea survives\r\nthere in our own time), there was in an office a quality of property\r\nhaving about it the same kind of sacred immunity which belongs to real\r\nor personal estate. There were reversions to offices after the deaths of\r\ntheir occupants, like vested remainders in lands. It was offensive to\r\nthe ordinary sense of decency and justice that the right of a public\r\nofficer to appropriate so much of the public revenue should be attacked.\r\nIt did not offend the public conscience that great perquisites should\r\nbelong to officers performing work of the most trifling value or none at\r\nall. The same practices and traditions, weakened by distance from\r\nEngland and by the simpler life and smaller wealth of the colonists,\r\ncame to our forefathers. They existed when the democratic movement,\r\nstayed during the necessities of war and civil reconstruction, returned\r\nat the end of the last century and became all-powerful in 1801. To break\r\nthis idea of property and right in office, to make it clear that every\r\noffice was a mere means of service of the people at the wish of the\r\npeople, there seemed, to very patriotic and generally very wise men, no\r\nsimpler way than that the people by their elections should take away and\r\ndistribute offices in utter disregard of the interests of those who\r\nheld them. The odious result to which this afterwards led, of making\r\noffices the mere property of influential politicians, was but\r\nimperfectly foreseen. Nor did that result, inevitable as it was, follow\r\nfor many years. There seems no reason to believe that the incessant and\r\nextensive changes in office which began in 1801, seriously lowered the\r\nstandard of actual public service until years after Van Buren was a\r\npowerful and conspicuous politician. Political parties were pretty\r\ngenerally in the hands of honest men. The prostituted and venal\r\ndisposition of \"spoils,\" though a natural sequence, was to come long\r\nafter. Rotation was practiced, or its fruits were accepted and enjoyed\r\nwith satisfaction, by public men of the State who were really statesmen,\r\nwho had high standards of public honor and duty, whose minds were\r\ndirected towards great and exalted public ends. If it seemed right to De\r\nWitt Clinton, Edward Livingston, Robert R. Livingston, and Ambrose\r\nSpencer, surely lesser gods of our early political Olympus could not be\r\nexpected to refuse its advantages or murmur at its hardships. Nor was\r\nthe change distasteful to the people, if we may judge by their political\r\nbehavior. No faction or party seems to have been punished by public\r\nsentiment for the practice except in conspicuous cases like those of De\r\nWitt Clinton and Van Buren, where sometimes blows aimed at single men\r\nroused popular and often an undeserved sympathy. The idea that a public\r\nofficer should easily and naturally go from the ranks of the people\r\nwithout special equipment, and as easily return to those ranks, has been\r\npopularly agreeable wherever the story of Cincinnatus has been told.\r\nEarly in this century the closeness of offices to ordinary life, and the\r\nabsence of an organized bureaucracy controlling or patronizing the\r\nmasses of men, seemed proper elements of the great democratic reform.\r\nThere had not yet arisen the very modern and utilitarian and the vastly\r\nbetter conception of a service, the responsible directors of whose\r\npolicy should be changed with popular sentiment, but whose subordinates\r\nshould be treated by the public as any other employer would treat them,\r\nupon simple and unsentimental rules of business. Another practical\r\nconsideration makes more intelligible the failure of our ancestors to\r\nperceive the dangers of the great change they permitted. Offices were\r\nnot nearly as technical, their duties not nearly as uniform, as they\r\nhave grown to be in the more complex procedures of our enormously richer\r\nand more populous time. Every officer did a multitude of things.\r\nIntelligent and active men in unofficial life shifted with amazing\r\nreadiness and success from one calling to another. A general became a\r\njudge, or a judge became a general,--as, indeed, we have seen in later\r\ndays. A merchant could learn to survey; a farmer could keep or could\r\nlearn to keep fair records.\r\n\r\nIn the art of making of the lesser offices ammunition with which to\r\nfight great battles over great questions, Van Buren became a master. His\r\nimperturbable temper and patience, his keen reading of the motives and\r\nuses of men, gave him so firm a hold upon politicians that it has been\r\ncommon to forget the undoubted hold he long had upon the people. In\r\nApril, 1816, he was reëlected senator for a second term of four years.\r\nHis eight years of service in the senate expired in 1820.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1812, the first session of the new legislature was held to\r\nchoose presidential electors. Not until sixteen years later were\r\nelectors chosen directly by the people. Van Buren voted for the\r\ncandidates favorable to De Witt Clinton for president as against\r\nMadison. In the successful struggle of the Clintonians for these\r\nelectors, he is said in this, his first session, to have shown the\r\naddress and activity which at once made him a Republican leader. For his\r\nvote against Madison Van Buren's friends afterwards made many apologies;\r\nhis adversaries declared it unpardonable treachery to one of the revered\r\nDemocratic fathers. But the young politician was not open to much\r\ncondemnation. De Witt Clinton, though he had but just reached the\r\nbeginning of middle life, was a very able and even an illustrious man.\r\nHe had been unanimously nominated in an orderly way by a caucus of the\r\nRepublican members of the legislature of 1811 and 1812 of which Van\r\nBuren was not a member. He had accepted the nomination and had declined\r\nto withdraw from it. There was a strong Republican opposition to the\r\ndeclaration of war at that time, because preparation for it had not\r\nbeen adequately made. Most of the Republican members of Congress from\r\nNew York had voted against the declaration. The virtues and abilities of\r\nMadison were not those likely to make a successful war, as the event\r\namply proved. There was natural and deserved discontent with the\r\ntreatment by Jefferson's administration, in which Madison had charge of\r\nforeign relations, and by Madison's own administration, of the\r\ndifficulties caused by the British Orders in Council, the Berlin and\r\nMilan decrees of Napoleon, and the unprincipled depredations of both the\r\ngreat belligerents. Van Buren is said by Butler, then an inmate of his\r\nfamily, to have been an open and decided advocate of the embargo, and of\r\nall the strong measures proposed against Great Britain and of the war\r\nitself. Nor was this very inconsistent with his vote for Clinton. He had\r\na stronger sense of allegiance to his party in the State than to his\r\nparty at Washington; and the Republican party of New York had regularly\r\ndeclared for Clinton. For once at least Van Buren found himself voting\r\nwith the great body of the Federalists, men who had not, like John\r\nQuincy Adams, become reconciled to the strong and obvious, though\r\nsometimes ineffective, patriotism of Jefferson's and Madison's\r\nadministrations. But whatever had been the motives which induced Van\r\nBuren to support Clinton, they soon ceased to operate. Within a few\r\nmonths after this the political relations between the two men were\r\ndissolved; and they were politically hostile, until Clinton's death\r\nfourteen years afterwards called from Van Buren a pathetic tribute.\r\n\r\nAlthough the youngest man but one, it was said, until that time elected\r\nto the state senate, Van Buren was in January, 1814, chosen to prepare\r\nthe answer then customarily made to the speech of the governor. In it he\r\ndefended the war, which had been bitterly assailed in the address to the\r\ngovernor made by the Federalist Assembly. Political divisions even when\r\ncarried to excess were, he said, inseparable from the blessings of\r\nfreedom; but such divisions were unfit in their resistance of a foreign\r\nenemy. The great body of the New York Republicans, with Governor\r\nTompkins at their head, now gave Madison vigorous support; although\r\ntheir defection in 1812 had probably made possible the Federalist\r\nsuccess at the election for the Assembly in 1813, which embarrassed the\r\nnational administration. Van Buren warmly supported Tompkins for his\r\nreëlection in April, 1813, and prepared for the legislative caucus a\r\nhighly declamatory, but clear and forcible, address to Republican\r\nelectors in his behalf. The provocations to war were strongly set out.\r\nIt was declared that \"war and war alone was our only refuge from\r\nnational degradation;\" the \"two great and crying grievances\" were \"the\r\ndestruction of our commerce, and the impressment of our seamen;\" for\r\nAmericans did not anticipate the surrender at Ghent two years later to\r\nthe second wrong. While American sailors' \"deeds of heroic valor make\r\nold Ocean smile at the humiliations of her ancient tyrant,\" the address\r\nurged Americans to mark the man, meaning the trading Federalist, who\r\nbelieved \"in commuting our sailors' rights for the safety of our\r\nmerchants' goods.\" In the sophomoric and solemn rhetoric of which\r\nAmericans, and Englishmen too, were then fond, it pointed out that the\r\nfavor of citizens was not sought \"by the seductive wiles and artful\r\nblandishments of the corrupt minions of aristocracy,\" who of course were\r\nFederalists, but that citizens were now addressed \"in the language which\r\nalone becomes freemen to use,--the language to which alone it becomes\r\nfreemen to listen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the legislative sessions of 1813 and 1814 Van Buren gave a practical\r\nand skillful support to administration measures. But many of them were\r\nbalked by the Federalists, until in the election of April, 1814, the\r\nrising patriotism of the country, undaunted by the unskillful and\r\nunfortunate conduct of the war, pronounced definitely in favor of a\r\nstrong war policy. The Republicans recovered control of the Assembly;\r\nand there were already a Republican governor and Senate. An extra\r\nsession was summoned in September, 1814, through which exceedingly\r\nvigorous measures were carried against Federalist opposition. Van Buren\r\nnow definitely led. Appropriations were made from the state treasury for\r\nthe pay of militia in the national service. The State undertook to\r\nenlist twelve thousand men for two years, a corps of sea fencibles\r\nconsisting of twenty companies, and two regiments of colored men; slaves\r\nenlisting with the consent of their masters to be freed. Van Buren's\r\n\"classification act\" Benton afterwards declared to be the \"most\r\nenergetic war measure ever adopted in this country.\" By it the whole\r\nmilitary population was divided into 12,000 classes, each class to\r\nfurnish one able-bodied man, making the force of 12,000 to be raised. If\r\nno one volunteered from a class, then any member of the class was\r\nauthorized to procure a soldier by a bounty, the amount of which should\r\nbe paid by the members of the class according to their ability, to be\r\ndetermined by assessors. If no soldier from the class were thus\r\nprocured, then a soldier was to be peremptorily drafted from each class.\r\nVan Buren was proud enough of this act to file the draft of it in his\r\nown handwriting with the clerk of the Senate, indorsed by himself: \"The\r\noriginal Classification Bill, to be preserved as a memento of the\r\npatriotism, intelligence, and firmness of the legislature of 1814-15. M.\r\nV. B. Albany, Feb. 15, 1815.\"\r\n\r\nCheered, after many disasters, by the victory at Plattsburg and the\r\ncreditable battle of Lundy's Lane, the Senate, in Van Buren's words,\r\ncongratulated Governor Tompkins upon \"the brilliant achievements of our\r\narmy and navy during the present campaign, which have pierced the gloom\r\nthat for a time obscured our political horizon.\" The end of the war left\r\nin high favor the Republicans who had supported it. The people were\r\ngood-humoredly willing to forget its many inefficiencies, to recall\r\ncomplacently its few glories, and to find little fault with a treaty\r\nwhich, if it established no disputed right, at least brought peace\r\nwithout surrender and without dishonor. Jackson's fine victory at New\r\nOrleans after the treaty was signed, though it came too late to\r\nstrengthen John Quincy Adams's dauntless front in the peace conference,\r\nwas quickly seized by the people as the summing up of American and\r\nBritish prowess. The Republicans now had a hero in the West, as well as\r\na philosopher at Monticello. Van Buren drafted the resolution giving the\r\nthanks of New York \"to Major-General Jackson, his gallant officers and\r\ntroops, for their wonderful and heroic victory.\"\r\n\r\nIn the method then well established the Republicans celebrated their\r\npolitical success in 1814. Among the removals, Abraham Van Vechten lost\r\nthe post of attorney-general, which on February 17, 1815, was conferred\r\nupon Van Buren for his brilliant and successful leadership in the\r\nSenate. He remained, however, a senator of the State. At thirty-two,\r\ntherefore, he was, next to the governor, the leader of the Tompkins\r\nRepublicans, now so completely dominant; he held two political offices\r\nof dignity and importance; and he was conducting besides an active law\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton, after his defeat for the presidency, suffered other\r\ndisasters. It was in January, 1813, that he and Van Buren broke their\r\npolitical relations; and the Republicans very largely fell off from him.\r\nThe reasons for this do not clearly appear; but were probably Clinton's\r\ncontinuance of hostility to the national administration, which seemed\r\nunpatriotic to the Republicans, and some of the mysterious matters of\r\npatronage in which Clinton had been long and highly proscriptive. In\r\n1815 the latter was removed from the mayoralty of New York by the\r\ninfluence of Governor Tompkins in the council. He had been both mayor\r\nand senator for several years prior to 1812. He was mayor and\r\nlieutenant-governor when he was a candidate for the presidency.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 the Republicans in the Assembly, then closely divided between\r\nthem and the Federalists (who seemed to be favored by the\r\napportionment), sought one of those immoral advantages whose wrong in\r\ntimes of high party feeling seems invisible to men otherwise honorable.\r\nIn the town of Pennington a Federalist, Henry Fellows, had been fairly\r\nelected to the Assembly by a majority of 30; but 49 of his ballots were\r\nreturned as reading \"Hen. Fellows;\" and his Republican competitor, Peter\r\nAllen, got the certificate of appointment. The Republicans, acting, it\r\nseems, in open conference with Van Buren, insisted not only upon\r\norganizing the house, which was perhaps right, but upon what was wrong\r\nand far more important. They elected the council of appointment before\r\nFellows was seated, as he afterwards was by an almost unanimous vote.\r\nThe \"Peter Allen legislature\" is said to have become a term of reproach.\r\nBut, as with electoral abuses in later days, the Federalists were not as\r\nmuch aided as they ought to have been by this sharp practice of their\r\nrivals; the people perhaps thought that, as they were in the minority\r\neverywhere but in the Assembly, they ought not to have been permitted,\r\nby a capture of the council, to remove the Republicans in office.\r\n\r\nAt any rate the election in April, 1816, while the \"Peter Allen\r\nlegislature\" was still in office, went heavily in favor of the\r\nRepublicans, Van Buren receiving his second election to the Senate. On\r\nMarch 4, 1816, he was chosen by the legislature a regent of the\r\nUniversity of the State of New York, an office which he held until 1829.\r\nThe University was then, as now, almost a myth, being supposed to be the\r\nassociated colleges and academies of the State. But the regents have had\r\na varying charge of educational matters.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the agitation, so superbly and with such foresight conducted by\r\nDe Witt Clinton, resulted in the passage of the law under which the\r\nconstruction of the Erie Canal began. Van Buren's enmity to Clinton did\r\nnot cause him to oppose the measure, of which Hammond says he was an\r\n\"early friend.\" With a few others he left his party ranks to vote with\r\nClinton's friends; and this necessary accession from the \"Bucktails\" is\r\nsaid by the same fair historian to have been produced by Van Buren's\r\n\"efficient and able efforts.\" In his speech favoring it he declared\r\nthat his vote for the law would be \"the most important vote he ever gave\r\nin his life;\" that \"the project, if executed, would raise the State to\r\nthe highest possible pitch of fame and grandeur,\" an expression not\r\ndiscredited by the splendid and fruitful result of the enterprise.\r\nClinton, after hearing the speech, forgot for a moment their political\r\ncollisions, and personally thanked Van Buren.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1817, Clinton was elected governor by a practically unanimous\r\nvote. His resolute courage and the prestige of the canal policy\r\ncompelled this tribute from the Republicans, in spite of his\r\nsacrilegious presidential aspiration in 1812, and his dismissal from the\r\nmayoralty of New York in 1815. Governor Tompkins, now vice-president,\r\nwas Clinton's only peer in New York politics. The popular tide was too\r\nstrong for the efforts of Tompkins, Van Buren, and their associates. In\r\nthe eagerness to defeat Clinton, it was even suggested that Tompkins\r\nshould serve both as governor and vice-president; should be at once\r\nruler at Albany and vice-ruler at Washington. Van Buren did not,\r\nhowever, go with the hot-heads of the legislature in opposing a bill for\r\nan election to fill the vacancy left by the resignation, which it was at\r\nlast thought necessary for Tompkins to make, of the governorship. No one\r\ndared run against Clinton; and he triumphantly returned to political\r\npower. Under this administration of his, the party feud took definite\r\nform. Clinton's Republican adversaries were dubbed \"Bucktails\" from the\r\nornaments worn on ceremonial occasions by the Tammany men who had long\r\nbeen Clinton's enemies. The Bucktails and their successors were the\r\n\"regular\" Republicans, or the Democrats as they were later called; and\r\nthey kept their regularity until, long afterwards, the younger and\r\ngreater Bucktail leader, when venerable and laden with honors, became\r\nthe titular head of the Barnburner defection. The merits of the feud\r\nbetween Bucktails and Clintonians it is now difficult to find. Each\r\naccused the other of coquetting with the Federalists; and the accusation\r\nwas nearly always true of one or the other of them. Politics was a\r\nhighly developed and extremely interesting game, whose players, though\r\nreally able and patriotic men, were apparently careless of the\r\nundignified parts they were playing. Nor are Clintonians and Bucktails\r\nalone in political history. Cabinets of the greatest nations have, in\r\nmore modern times, broken on grounds as sheerly personal as those which\r\ndivided Clinton and Van Buren in 1818. British and French ministries, as\r\nrecent memoirs and even recent events have shown, have fallen to pieces\r\nin feuds of as little essential dignity as belonged to those of New York\r\nseventy years ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the Bucktails suffered the fate of war; and Van Buren, their\r\nefficient head, was removed from the attorney-general's office. Thurlow\r\nWeed, then a country editor, grotesquely wrote at the time that\r\n\"rotation in office is the most striking and brilliant feature of\r\nexcellence in our benign form of government; and that by this doctrine,\r\nbottomed, as it is, upon the Magna Charta of our liberties, Van Buren's\r\nremoval was not only sanctioned, but was absolutely required.\" The\r\nlatter still remained state senator, and soon waged a short and decisive\r\ncampaign to recover political mastery. He now came to the aid of\r\nGovernor Tompkins, who during the war with England had borrowed money\r\nfor public use upon his personal responsibility, and in the disbursement\r\nof several millions of dollars for war purposes had, through\r\ncarelessness in bookkeeping or clerical detail, apparently become a\r\ndebtor of the State. The comptroller, in spite of a law passed in 1819\r\nto indemnify Tompkins for his patriotic services, took a hostile\r\nattitude which threatened the latter with pecuniary destruction. In\r\nMarch, 1820, Van Buren threw himself into the contest with a skill and\r\ngenerous fervor which saved the ex-governor. Van Buren's speech of two\r\ndays for the old chief of the Bucktails, is described by Hammond, a\r\npolitical historian of New York not unduly friendly to Van Buren, to\r\nhave been \"ingenious, able, and eloquent.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also in 1820 that Van Buren promoted the reëlection of Rufus\r\nKing, the distinguished Federalist, to the United States Senate. His\r\nmotives in doing this were long bitterly assailed; but as the choice was\r\nintrinsically admirable, Van Buren was probably glad to gratify a\r\npatriotic impulse which was not very inconsistent with party advantage.\r\nIn 1819 the Republican caucus, the last at which the Bucktails and\r\nClintonians both attended, was broken up amid mutual recriminations.\r\nJohn C. Spencer, the son of Ambrose Spencer, and afterwards a\r\ndistinguished Whig, was the Clintonian candidate, and had the greater\r\nnumber of Republican votes. In the legislature there was no choice,\r\nRufus King having fewer votes than either of the Republicans. When the\r\nlegislature of 1820 met, there appeared a pamphlet skillfully written in\r\na tone of exalted patriotism. This decided the election for King. Van\r\nBuren was its author, and was said to have been aided by William L.\r\nMarcy. Both had suffered at the hands of Clinton. However much they may\r\nhave been so influenced in secret, they gave in public perfectly sound\r\nand weighty reasons for returning this old and distinguished statesman\r\nto the place he had honored for many years. In 1813 King had received\r\nthe votes of a few Republicans, without whom he would have been defeated\r\nby a Republican competitor. The Clintonians and their adversaries had\r\nsince disputed which of them had then been guilty of party disloyalty.\r\nBut it can hardly be doubted that King's high character and great\r\nability, with the revolutionary glamour about him, made his choice seem\r\npatriotic and popular, and therefore politically prudent.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's pamphlet of 1820 was addressed to the Republican members of\r\nthe legislature by a \"fellow-member\" who told them that he knew and was\r\npersonally known to most of them, and that he had, \"from his infancy,\r\ntaken a deep interest in the honor and prosperity of the party.\" This\r\nanonymous \"fellow-member\" pronounced the support of King by Republicans\r\nto \"be an act honorable to themselves, advantageous to the country, and\r\njust to him.\" He declared that the only reluctance Republicans had to a\r\npublic avowal of their sentiments arose from a \"commendable apprehension\r\nthat their determination to support him under existing circumstances\r\nmight subject them to the suspicion of having become a party to a\r\npolitical bargain, to one of those sinister commutations of principle\r\nfor power, which they think common with their adversaries, and against\r\nwhich they have remonstrated with becoming spirit.\" He showed that there\r\nwere degrees even among Federalists; that some in the war had been\r\ninfluenced by \"most envenomed malignity against the administration of\r\ntheir own government;\" that a second and \"very numerous and respectable\r\nportion\" had been those \"who, inured to opposition and heated by\r\ncollision, were poorly qualified to judge dispassionately of the\r\nmeasures of government,\" who thought the war impolitic at the time, but\r\nwho were ignorantly but honestly mistaken; but that a third class of\r\nthem had risen \"superior to the prejudices and passions of those with\r\nwhom they once acted.\" In the last class had been Rufus King; at home\r\nand in the Senate he had supported the administration; he had helped\r\nprocure loans to the State for war purposes. The address skillfully\r\nrecalled his Revolutionary services, his membership in the convention\r\nwhich framed the Federal Constitution, his appointment by Washington as\r\nminister to the English court, and his continuance there under\r\nJefferson. He was declared to be opposed to Clinton. The address\r\nconcluded by reciting that there had been in New York \"exceptionable and\r\nunprincipled political bargains and coalitions,\" which with darker\r\noffenses ought to be proved, to vindicate the great body of citizens\r\n\"from the charge of participating in the profligacy of the few, and to\r\ngive rest to that perturbed spirit which now haunts the scenes of former\r\nmoral and political debaucheries;\" but added that the nature of a vote\r\nfor King precluded such suspicions.\r\n\r\nThe last statement was just. King's return was free from other suspicion\r\nthan that he probably preferred the Van Buren to the Clinton\r\nRepublicans. Van Buren, seeing that the Federalist party was at an end,\r\nwas glad both to do a public service and to ally with his party, in the\r\ndivisions of the future, some part of the element so finely represented\r\nby Rufus King. In private Van Buren urged the support of King even more\r\nemphatically. \"We are committed,\" he wrote, \"to his support. It is both\r\nwise and honest, and we must have no fluttering in our course. Mr.\r\nKing's views towards us are honorable and correct.... Let us not, then,\r\nhave any halting. I will put my head on its propriety.\" Van Buren's\r\npartisanship always had a mellow character. He practiced the golden rule\r\nof successful politics, to foresee future benefits rather than remember\r\npast injuries. Indeed, it is just to say more. In sending King to the\r\nSenate he doubtless experienced the lofty pleasure which a politician of\r\npublic spirit feels in his occasional ability to use his power to reach\r\na beneficent end, which without the power he could not have reached,--a\r\nstroke which to a petty politician would seem dangerous, but which the\r\ngreater man accomplishes without injury to his party standing. A year or\r\ntwo after King's election, when Van Buren joined him at Washington,\r\nthere were established the most agreeable relations between them. The\r\nrefinement and natural decorum of the younger man easily fell in with\r\nthe polished and courtly manner of the old Federalist. Benton, who had\r\nthen just entered the Senate, said it was delightful to behold the\r\ndeferential regard which Van Buren paid to his venerable colleague, a\r\nregard always returned by King with marked kindness and respect.\r\n\r\nIn this year the era of good feeling was at its height. Monroe was\r\nreëlected president by an almost unanimous vote, with Tompkins again as\r\nvice-president. The good feeling, however, was among the people, and not\r\namong the politicians. The Republican party was about to divide by\r\nreason of the very completeness of its supremacy. The Federalist party\r\nwas extinguished and its members scattered. The greater number of them\r\nin New York went with the Clintonian Republicans, with whom they\r\nafterwards formed the chief body of the Whig party. A smaller number of\r\nthem, among whom were James A. Hamilton and John C. Hamilton, the sons\r\nof the great founder of the Federalist party, William A. Duer, John A.\r\nKing (the son of the reëlected senator), and many others of wealth and\r\nhigh social position, ranged themselves for a time in the Bucktail ranks\r\nunder Van Buren's leadership. In the slang of the day, they were the\r\n\"high-minded Federalists,\" because they had declared that Clinton's\r\nsupporters practiced a personal subserviency \"disgusting to high-minded\r\nand honorable men.\" With this addition, the Bucktails became the\r\nDemocratic party in New York. In April, 1820, the gubernatorial election\r\nwas between the Clintonians supporting Clinton, and the Bucktails\r\nsupporting Tompkins, the Vice-President. Clinton's recent and really\r\nmagnificent public service made him successful at the polls, but his\r\nparty was beaten at other points.\r\n\r\nRufus King's reëlection to the Senate was believed to have some relation\r\nto the Missouri question, then agitating the nation. In one of his\r\nletters urging his Republican associates to support King, Van Buren\r\ndeclared that the Missouri question concealed no plot so far as King was\r\nconcerned, but that he, Van Buren, and his friends, would \"give it a\r\ntrue direction.\" King's strong opposition to the admission of Missouri\r\nas a slave State was, however, perfectly open. If he returned to the\r\nSenate, it was certain he would steadily vote against any extension of\r\nslavery. Van Buren knew all this, and doubtless meant that King was\r\nbargaining away none of his convictions for the senatorship. But what\r\nthe \"true direction\" was which was to be given the Missouri question, is\r\nnot clear. About the time of King's reëlection Van Buren joined in\r\ncalling a public meeting at Albany to protest against extending slavery\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. He was absent at the time of the meeting, and\r\nrefused the use of his name upon the committee to send the anti-slavery\r\nresolutions to Washington. Nor is it clear whether his absence and\r\nrefusal were significant. He certainly did not condemn the resolutions;\r\nand in January, 1820, he voted in the state Senate for an instruction to\r\nthe senators and representatives in Congress \"to oppose the admission,\r\nas a State in the Union, of any territory not comprised within the\r\noriginal boundary of the United States, without making the prohibition\r\nof slavery therein an indispensable condition of admission.\" This\r\nresolution undoubtedly expressed the clear convictions of the\r\nRepublicans in New York, whether on Van Buren's or Clinton's side, as\r\nwell as of the remaining Federalists.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's direct interest in national politics had already begun. In\r\n1816 he was present in Washington (then a pretty serious journey from\r\nAlbany) when the Republican congressional caucus was held to nominate a\r\npresident. Governor Tompkins, after a brief canvass, retired; and\r\nCrawford, then secretary of war, became the candidate against Monroe,\r\nand was supported by most of the Republicans from New York. Van Buren's\r\npreference was not certainly known, though it is supposed he preferred\r\nMonroe. In 1820 he was chosen a presidential elector in place of an\r\nabsentee from the electoral college, and participated in the all but\r\nunanimous vote for Monroe. He voted with the other New York electors for\r\nTompkins for the vice-presidency. In April, 1820, he wrote to Henry\r\nMeigs, a Bucktail congressman then at Washington, that the rascality of\r\nsome of the deputy postmasters in the State was intolerable, and cried\r\naloud for relief; that it was impossible to penetrate the interior of\r\nthe State with friendly papers; and that two or three prompt removals\r\nwere necessary. The postmaster-general was to be asked \"to do an act of\r\njustice and render us a partial service\" by the removal of the\r\npostmasters at Bath, Little Falls, and Oxford, and to appoint successors\r\nwhom Van Buren named. In January, 1821, Governor Clinton sent this\r\nletter to the legislature, with a message and other papers so numerous\r\nas to be carried in a green bag, which gave the name to the message, in\r\nsupport of a charge that the national administration had interfered in\r\nthe state election. But the \"green-bag message\" did Van Buren little\r\nharm, for Clinton's own proscriptive rigor had been great, and it was\r\nonly two years before that Van Buren himself had been removed from the\r\nattorney-generalship. In 1821 the political division of the New York\r\nRepublicans was carried to national politics. When a speaker was to be\r\nchosen in place of Clay, Taylor of New York, the Republican candidate,\r\nwas opposed by the Bucktail congressmen, because he had supported\r\nClinton.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1821, Van Buren gained the then dignified promotion to the\r\nfederal Senate. He was elected by the Bucktails against Nathan Sanford,\r\nthe sitting senator, who was supported by the Clintonians and\r\nFederalists. Van Buren was now thirty-eight years old, and in the early\r\nprime of his powers. He had run the gauntlet of two popular elections;\r\nhe had been easily first among the Republicans of the state Senate; he\r\nhad there shown extraordinary political skill and an intelligent and\r\npublic spirit; he had ably administered the chief law office of the\r\nState which was not judicial. Though not yet keenly interested in any\r\nfederal question,--for his activity and thought had been sufficiently\r\nengaged in affairs of his own State,--he turned to the new field with an\r\neasy confidence, amply justified by his mastery of the problems with\r\nwhich he had so far grappled. He reached Washington the undoubted leader\r\nof his party in the State. The prestige of Governor Tompkins, although\r\njust reëlected vice-president, had suffered from his recent defeat for\r\nthe governorship, and from his pecuniary and other difficulties; and\r\nbesides, he obviously had not Van Buren's unrivaled equipment for\r\npolitical leadership.\r\n\r\nBefore Van Buren attended his first session in the federal capital he\r\nperformed for the public most honorable service in the state\r\nconstitutional convention which sat in the autumn of 1821. This body\r\nillustrated the earnest and wholesome temper in which the most powerful\r\npublic men of the State, after many exhibitions of partisan, personal,\r\nand even petty animosities, could treat so serious and abiding a matter\r\nas its fundamental law. The Democrats sent Vice-President Tompkins, both\r\nthe United States senators, King and Van Buren, the late senator,\r\nSanford, and Samuel Nelson, then beginning a long and honorable career.\r\nThe Clintonians and Federalists sent Chancellor Kent and Ambrose\r\nSpencer, the chief justice. Van Buren was chosen from Otsego, and not\r\nfrom his own county, probably because the latter was politically\r\nunfavorable to him.\r\n\r\nThis convention was one of the steps in the democratic march. It was\r\ncalled to broaden the suffrage, to break up the central source of\r\npatronage at Albany, and to enlarge local self-administration. The\r\ngovernment of New York had so far been a freeholders' government, with\r\nthose great virtues, and those greater and more enduring vices, which\r\nwere characteristic of a government controlled exclusively by the owners\r\nof land. The painful apprehension aroused by the democratic resolution\r\nto reduce, if not altogether to destroy, the exclusive privileges of\r\nland-owners, was expressed in the convention by Chancellor Kent. He\r\nwould not \"bow before the idol of universal suffrage;\" this extreme\r\ndemocratic principle, he said, had \"been regarded with terror by the\r\nwise men of every age;\" wherever tried, it had brought \"corruption,\r\ninjustice, violence, and tyranny;\" if adopted, posterity would \"deplore\r\nin sackcloth and ashes the delusion of the day.\" He wished no laws to\r\npass without the free consent of the owners of the soil. He did not\r\nforesee English parliaments elected in 1885 and 1886 by a suffrage not\r\nvery far from universal, or a royal jubilee celebrated by democratic\r\nmasses, or the prudent conservatism in matters of property of the\r\nenfranchised French democracy,--he foresaw none of these when he\r\ndeclared that England and France could not sustain the weight of\r\nuniversal suffrage; that \"the radicals of England, with the force of\r\nthat mighty engine, would at once sweep away the property, the laws, and\r\nthe liberty of that island like a deluge.\" Van Buren distinguished\r\nhimself in the debate. Upon this exciting and paramount topic he did not\r\nshare the temper which possessed most of his party. His speech was\r\nclear, explicit, philosophical, and really statesmanlike. It so\r\nimpressed even his adversaries; and Hammond, one of them, declared that\r\nhe ought for it to be ranked \"among the most shining orators and able\r\nstatesmen of the age.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading this, or indeed any of the utterances of Van Buren where the\r\noccasion required distinctness, it is difficult to find the ground of\r\nthe charge of \"noncommittalism\" so incessantly made against him. He\r\ndoubtless refrained from taking sides on questions not yet ripe for\r\ndecision, however clear, and whatever may have been his speculative\r\nopinions. But this is the duty of every statesman; it has been the\r\npractice of every politician who has promoted reform. Van Buren now\r\npointed out how completely the events of the forty years past had\r\ndiscredited the grave speculative fears of Franklin, Hamilton, and\r\nMadison as to the result of some provisions of the Federal Constitution.\r\nWith Burke he believed experience to be the only unerring touchstone. He\r\nconclusively showed that property had been as safe in those American\r\ncommunities which had universal suffrage as in the few which retained a\r\nproperty qualification; that venality in voting, apprehended from the\r\nchange, already existed in the grossest forms at the parliamentary\r\nelections of England. Going to the truth which is at the dynamic source\r\nof democratic institutions, he told the chancellor that when among the\r\nmasses of America the principles of order and good government should\r\nyield to principles of anarchy and violence and permit attacks on\r\nprivate property or an agrarian law, all constitutional provisions would\r\nbe idle and unavailing, because they would have lost all their force and\r\ninfluence. With a true instinct, however, Van Buren wished the steps to\r\nbe taken gradually. He was not yet ready, he said, to admit to the\r\nsuffrage the shifting population of cities, held to the government by\r\nno other ties than the mere right to vote. He was not ready for a\r\nreally universal suffrage. The voter ought, if he did not participate in\r\nthe government by paying taxes or performing militia duty, to be a man\r\nwho was a householder with some of the elements of stability, with\r\nsomething at stake in the community. Although they had reached \"the\r\nverge of universal suffrage,\" he could not with his Democratic friends\r\ntake the \"one step beyond;\" he would not cheapen the invaluable right by\r\nconferring it with indiscriminating hand \"on every one, black or white,\r\nwho would be kind enough to condescend to accept it.\" Though a Democrat\r\nhe was opposed, he said, to a \"precipitate and unexpected prostration of\r\nall qualifications;\" he looked with dread upon increasing the voters in\r\nNew York city from thirteen or fourteen thousand to twenty-five\r\nthousand, believing (curious prediction for a father of the Democratic\r\nparty!) that the increase \"would render their elections rather a curse\r\nthan a blessing,\" and \"would drive from the polls all sober-minded\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe universal suffrage then postponed was wisely adopted a few years\r\nlater. Democracy marched steadily on; and Van Buren was willing,\r\nprobably very willing, to be guided by experience. He opposed in the\r\nconvention a proposal supported by most of his party to restrict\r\nsuffrage to white citizens, but favored a property qualification for\r\nblack men, the $250 freehold ownership until then required of white\r\nvoters. He would not, he said, draw from them a revenue and yet deny\r\nthem the right of suffrage. Twenty-five years later, in 1846, nearly\r\nthree-fourths of the voters of the State refused equal suffrage to the\r\nblacks; and even in 1869, six years after the emancipation proclamation,\r\na majority still refused to give them the same rights as white men.\r\n\r\nThe question of appointments to office was the chief topic in the\r\nconvention. Van Buren, as chairman of the committee on this subject,\r\nmade an interesting and able report. It was unanimously agreed that the\r\nuse of patronage by the council of appointment had been a scandal. Only\r\na few members voted to retain the council, even if it were to be elected\r\nby the people. He recommended that military officers, except the\r\nhighest, be elected by the privates and officers of militia. Of the 6663\r\ncivil officers whose appointment and removal by the council had for\r\ntwenty years kept the State in turmoil, he recommended that 3643, being\r\nnotaries, commissioners, masters and examiners in chancery, and other\r\nlesser officers, should be appointed under general laws to be enacted by\r\nthe legislature; the clerks of courts and district attorneys should be\r\nappointed by the common pleas courts; mayors and clerks of cities should\r\nbe appointed by their common councils, except in New York, where for\r\nyears afterwards the mayors were appointed; the heads of the state\r\ndepartments should be appointed by the legislature; and all other\r\nofficers, including surrogates and justices of the peace as well as the\r\ngreater judicial officers, should be appointed by the governor upon the\r\nconfirmation of the Senate. Van Buren declared himself opposed, here\r\nagain separating himself from many of his party associates, to the\r\npopular election of any judicial officers, even the justices of the\r\npeace. Of all this he was long after to be reminded as proof of his\r\naristocratic contempt for democracy. His recommendations were adopted in\r\nthe main; although county clerks and sheriffs, whom he would have kept\r\nappointive, were made elective. Upon this question he was in a small\r\nminority with Chancellor Kent and Rufus King, having most of his party\r\nfriends against him. Thus was broken up the enormous political power so\r\nlong wielded at Albany, and the patronage distributed through the\r\ncounties. The change, it was supposed, would end a great abuse. It did\r\nend the concentration of patronage at the capital; but the partisan\r\nabuses of patronage were simply transferred to the various county seats,\r\nto exercise a different and wider, though probably a less dangerous,\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nThe council of revision fell with hardly a friend to speak for it. It\r\nwas one of those checks upon popular power of which Federalists had been\r\nfond. It consisted of the governor with the chancellor and the judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and had a veto power upon bills passed by the\r\nlegislature. As the chancellor and judges held office during good\r\nbehavior until they had reached the limit of age, the council was almost\r\na chamber of life peers. The exercise of its power had provoked great\r\nanimosity. The chief judicial officers of the State, judges, and\r\nchancellors, to whom men of our day look back with a real veneration,\r\nhad been drawn by it into a kind of political warfare, in which few of\r\nour higher magistrates, though popularly elected and for terms, would\r\ndare to engage. An act had been passed by the legislature in 1814 to\r\npromote privateering; but Chancellor Kent as a member of the council\r\nobjected to it. Van Buren maintained with him an open and heated\r\ndiscussion upon the propriety of the objections,--a discussion in which\r\nthe judicial character justly enough afforded no protection. Van Buren's\r\nfeeling against the judges who were his political adversaries was often\r\nexhibited. He said in the convention: \"I object to the council, as being\r\ncomposed of the judiciary, who are not directly responsible to the\r\npeople. I object to it because it inevitably connects the\r\njudiciary--those who, with pure hearts and sound heads, should preside\r\nin the sanctuaries of justice--with the intrigues and collisions of\r\nparty strife; because it tends to make our judges politicians, and\r\nbecause such has been its practical effect.\" He further said that he\r\nwould not join in the rather courtly observation that the council was\r\nabolished because of a personal regard for the peace of its members. He\r\nwould have it expressly remembered that the council had served the ends\r\nof faction; though he added that he should regard the loss of Chancellor\r\nKent from his judicial station as a public calamity. In his general\r\nposition Van Buren was clearly right. Again and again have theorists,\r\nsupposing judges to be sanctified and illumined by their offices, placed\r\nin their hands political power, which had been abused, or it was feared\r\nwould be abused, by men fancied to occupy less exalted stations. Again\r\nand again has the result shown that judges are only men, with human\r\npassions, prejudices, and ignorance; men who, if vested with functions\r\nnot judicial, if freed from the checks of precedents and law and public\r\nhearings and appellate review, fall into the same abuses and act on the\r\nsame motives, political and personal, which belong to other men. In the\r\ncouncil of revision before 1821 and the electoral commission of 1877\r\nwere signally proved the wisdom of restricting judges to the work of\r\ndeciding rights between parties judicially brought before them.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's far from \"non-committal\" talk about the judges was not\r\nfollowed by any support of the proposal to \"constitutionize\" them out of\r\noffice. The animosity of a majority of the members against the judges\r\nthen in office was intense; and they were not willing to accept the life\r\nof the council of revision as a sufficient sacrifice. Nor was the\r\nanimosity entirely unreasonable. Butler, in one of his early letters to\r\nJesse Hoyt, described the austerity with which Ambrose Spencer, the\r\nchief justice, when the young lawyer sought to address him, told him to\r\nwait until his seniors had been heard. In the convention there were\r\ndoubtless many who had been offended with a certain insolence of place\r\nwhich to this day characterizes the bearing of many judges of real\r\nability; and the opportunity of making repayment was eagerly seized. Nor\r\nwas it unreasonable that laymen should, from the proceedings of judges\r\nwhen acting upon political matters which laymen understood as well as\r\nthey, make inferences about the fairness of their proceedings on the\r\nbench upon which laymen could not always safely speak. By a vote of 66\r\nto 39, the convention refused to retain the judges then in office,--a\r\nproceeding which, with all the faults justly or even naturally found\r\nwith them, was a gross violation of the fundamental rule which ought to\r\nguide civilized lands in changing their laws. For the retention of the\r\njudges was perfectly consistent with the judicial scheme adopted. Van\r\nBuren put all this most admirably before voting with the minority. He\r\ntold the convention, and doubtless truly, that from the bench of judges,\r\nwhose official fate was then at their mercy, he had been assailed \"with\r\nhostility, political, professional, and personal,--hostility which had\r\nbeen the most keen, active, and unyielding;\" but that he would not\r\nindulge individual resentment in the prostration of his private and\r\npolitical adversary. The judicial officer, who could not be reached by\r\nimpeachment or the proceeding for removal by a two-thirds vote, ought\r\nnot to be disturbed. They should amend the constitution, he told the\r\nconvention, upon general principles, and not descend to pull down\r\nobnoxious officers. He begged it not to ruin its character and credit by\r\nproceeding to such extremities. But the removal of the judges did not\r\nprove unpopular. Only eight members of the convention voted against the\r\nConstitution; only fifteen others did not sign it. And the freeholders\r\nof the State, while deliberately surrendering some of their exclusive\r\nprivileges, adopted it by a vote of 75,422 to 41,497.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's service in this convention was that of a firm, sensible,\r\nfar-seeing man, resolute to make democratic progress, but unwilling,\r\nwithout further light from experience, to take extreme steps difficult\r\nto retrace. With a strong inclination towards great enlargement of the\r\nsuffrage, he pointed out that a mistake in going too far could never be\r\nrighted \"except by the sword.\" The wisdom of enduring temporary\r\ndifficulties, rather than to make theoretical changes greater than were\r\nnecessary to obviate serious and great wrongs, was common to him with\r\nthe highest and most influential type of modern law-makers. With some\r\nmen of the first rank, the convention had in it very many others crudely\r\nequipped for its work; and it met in an atmosphere of personal and\r\npolitical asperity unfavorable to deliberations over organic law. Van\r\nBuren was politically its most powerful member. It is clear that his\r\nalways conservative temper, aided by his tact and by his temperate and\r\npersuasive eloquence, held back his Democratic associates, headed by the\r\nimpetuous and angered General Root, from changes far more radical than\r\nthose which were made. Though eminent as a party man, he showed on this\r\nconspicuous field undoubted courage and independence and high sense of\r\nduty. Entering national politics he was fortunate therefore to be known,\r\nnot only as a skillful and adroit and even managing politician, as a\r\nvigorous and clear debater, as a successful leader in popular movements,\r\nbut also as a man of firm and upright patriotism, with a ripe and\r\neducated sense of the complexity of popular government, and a sober\r\nappreciation of the kind of dangers so subtly mingled with the blessings\r\nof democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES SENATOR.--REËSTABLISHMENT OF PARTIES.--PARTY LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December, 1821, Van Buren took his seat in the United States Senate.\r\nThe \"era of good feeling\" was then at its height. It was with perfect\r\nsincerity that Monroe in his message of the preceding year had said: \"I\r\nsee much cause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation.\" He had just\r\nbeen reëlected president with but a single vote against him. The country\r\nwas in profound peace. The burdens of the war with England were no\r\nlonger felt; and its few victories were remembered with exuberant\r\ngood-nature. Two years before, Florida had been acquired by the strong\r\nand persisting hand of the younger Adams. Wealth and comfort were in\r\nrapid increase. The moans and rage of the defeated and disgraced\r\nFederalists were suppressed, or, if now and then feebly heard, were\r\ncomplacently treated as outbursts of senility and impotence. People were\r\nnot only well-to-do in fact, but, what was far more extraordinary, they\r\nbelieved themselves to be so. In his great tariff speech but three or\r\nfour years later, Hayne called it the \"period of general jubilee.\" Every\r\ngreat public paper and speech, described the \"felicity\" of America. The\r\npresident pointed out to his fellow-citizens \"the prosperous and happy\r\ncondition of our country in all the great circumstances which constitute\r\nthe felicity of a nation;\" he told them that they were \"a free,\r\nvirtuous, and enlightened people;\" the unanimity of public sentiment in\r\nfavor of his \"humble pretensions\" indicated, he thought, \"the great\r\nstrength and stability of our Union.\" And all was reciprocated by the\r\npeople. This modest, gentle ruler was in his very mediocrity agreeable\r\nto them. He symbolized the comfort and order, the supreme respectability\r\nof which they were proud. When in 1817 he made a tour through New\r\nEngland, which had seen neither Jefferson nor Madison as visitors during\r\ntheir terms of office, and in his military coat of domestic manufacture,\r\nhis light small-clothes and cocked hat, met processions and orators\r\nwithout end, it was obvious that this was not the radical minister whom\r\nWashington had recalled from Jacobin Paris for effusively pledging\r\neternal friendship and submitting to fraternal embraces in the National\r\nConvention. Such youthful frenzy was now long past. America was enjoying\r\na great national idyl. Even the Federalists, except of course those who\r\nhad been too violent or who were still unrepentant, were not utterly\r\nshut out from the light of the placid high noon. Jackson had urged\r\nMonroe in 1816 \"to exterminate that monster called party spirit,\" and to\r\nlet some Federalists come to the board. Monroe thought, however, \"that\r\nthe administration should rest strongly on the Republican party,\" though\r\nmeaning to bring all citizens \"into the Republican fold as quietly as\r\npossible.\" Party, he declared, was unnecessary to free government; all\r\nshould be Republicans. And when Van Buren reached the sprawling,\r\nslatternly American capital in 1821, all were Republicans.\r\n\r\nThere were of course personal feuds in this great political family.\r\nThose of New York were the most notorious; but there were many others.\r\nBut such rivalries and quarrels were only a proof of the political calm.\r\nWhen families are smugly prosperous they indulge petty dislikes, which\r\ndisappear before storm or tragedy. The halcyon days could not last.\r\nMonroe's dream of a country with but one party, and that basking in\r\nperpetual \"felicity,\" was, in spite of what seemed for the moment a\r\nclose realization, as far from the truth as the dreams of later\r\nreformers who would in politics organize all the honest, respectable\r\nfolk together against all the dishonest.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the Missouri question was ended at the session before Van\r\nBuren's senatorial term began. It seemed only a thunder-storm passing\r\nacross a rich, warm day in harvest time, angry and agitating for the\r\nmoment, but quickly forgotten by dwellers in the pastoral scene when the\r\nrainbow of compromise appeared in the delightful hues of Henry Clay's\r\neloquence. The elements of the tremendous struggle yet to come were in\r\nthe atmosphere, but they were not visible. The slavery question had no\r\npolitical importance to Van Buren until fourteen years afterwards. In\r\njudging the men of that day we shall seriously mistake if we set up our\r\nown standards among their ideas. The moral growth in the twenty-five\r\nyears since the emancipation makes it irksome to be fair to the views of\r\nthe past generation, or indeed to the former views of half of our\r\npresent generation. Slavery has come to seem intrinsically wicked,\r\nhideous, to be hated everywhere. But sixty-five years ago it still\r\nlingered in several of the Northern States. It was wrong indeed; but the\r\ntemper of condemnation towards it was Platonic, full of the unavailing\r\nand unpoignant regret with which men hear of poverty and starvation and\r\ndisease and crime which they do not see and which they cannot help. Nor\r\ndid slavery then seem to the best of men so very great a wrong even to\r\nthe blacks; there were, it was thought, many ameliorations and\r\ncompensations. Men were glad to believe and did believe that the human\r\nchattels were better and happier than they would have been in Africa.\r\nThe economic waste of slavery, its corrupting and enervating effect upon\r\nthe whites, were thought to be objections quite as serious. Besides, it\r\nwas widely fancied to be at worst but a temporary evil. Jefferson's\r\ndislike of it was shared by many throughout the South as well as the\r\nNorth. The advantages of a free soil were becoming so apparent in the\r\nstrides by which the North was passing the South in every material\r\nadvantage, that the latter, it seemed, must surely learn the lesson.\r\nFor the institution within States already admitted to the Union,\r\nanti-slavery men felt no responsibility. Forty years later the great\r\nleader of the modern Republican party would not, he solemnly declared in\r\nthe very midst of a pro-slavery rebellion, interfere with slavery in the\r\nStates if the Union could be saved without disturbing it. If men in\r\nSouth Carolina cared to maintain a ruinous and corrupting domestic\r\ninstitution, even if it were a greater wrong against the slaves than it\r\nwas believed to be, or even if it were an injury to the whites\r\nthemselves, still men of Massachusetts and New York ought, it seemed to\r\nthem, to be no more disturbed over it than we feel bound to be over\r\npolygamy in Turkey.\r\n\r\nBut as to the territory west of the Mississippi not yet formed into\r\nStates, there was a different sentiment held by a great majority at the\r\nNorth and by many at the South. Slavery was not established there. The\r\nland was national domain, whose forms of political and social life were\r\nyet to be set up. Why not, before the embarrassments of slave settlement\r\narose, devote this new land to freedom,--not so much to freedom as that\r\nshining goddess of mercy and right and justice who rose clear and\r\nobvious to our purged vision out of the civil war, as to the less noble\r\ndeities of economic well-being, thrift, and industrial comfort?\r\nDemocrats at the North, therefore, were almost unanimous that Missouri\r\nshould come in free or not at all; and so with the rest of the territory\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, except the old slave settlement of Louisiana,\r\nalready admitted as a State. The resolution in the legislature of New\r\nYork in January, 1820, supported by Van Buren, that freedom be \"an\r\nindispensable condition of admission\" of new States, was but one of many\r\nexhibitions of feeling at the North. Monroe and the very best of\r\nAmericans did not, however, think the principle so sacred or necessary\r\nas to justify a struggle. John Quincy Adams, hating slavery as did but\r\nfew Americans, distinctly favored the compromise by which Missouri came\r\nin with slavery, and by which the other new territory north of the\r\npresent southern line of Missouri extended westward was to be free, and\r\nthe territory south of it slave. With no shame he acquiesced in the very\r\nthing about which forty years later the nation plunged into war. \"For\r\nthe present,\" he wrote, \"this contest is laid asleep.\" So the stream of\r\npeaceful sunshine and prosperity returned over the land.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's views at this time were doubtless clear against the\r\nextension of slavery. He disliked the institution; and in part saw how\r\ninconsistent were its odious practices with the best civic growth, how\r\ndebasing to whites and blacks alike. In March, 1822, he voted in the\r\nSenate, with Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts and Rufus King, for a\r\nproviso in the bill creating the new Territory of Florida by which the\r\nintroduction of slaves was forbidden except by citizens removing there\r\nfor actual settlement, and by which slaves introduced in violation of\r\nthe law were to be freed. But he was in a minority. Northern senators\r\nfrom Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Indiana refused to interfere with\r\nfree trade in slaves between the Southern States and this southernmost\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nAmong the forty-eight members of the Senate which met in December, 1821,\r\nneither Clay nor Calhoun nor Webster had a seat. The first was restless\r\nin one of his brief absences from official life; the second was\r\nsecretary of war; and Webster, out of Congress, was making great law\r\narguments and greater orations. Benton was there from the new State of\r\nMissouri, just beginning his thirty years. The warm friendship and\r\npolitical alliance between him and Van Buren must have soon begun.\r\nDuring all or nearly all Van Buren's senatorship the two occupied\r\nadjoining seats. Two years later Andrew Jackson was sent to the Senate\r\nby Tennessee, as a suitable preliminary to his presidential canvass.\r\nDuring the next two sessions Van Buren, Benton, and Jackson were thrown\r\ntogether; and without doubt the foundations were laid of their lifelong\r\nintimacy and political affection. Benton and Jackson, personal enemies\r\nyears before, had become reconciled. Among these associates Van Buren\r\nadhered firmly enough to his own clear views; he did not turn\r\nobsequiously to the rising sun of Tennessee. William H. Crawford, the\r\nsecretary of the treasury, had, in the Republican congressional caucus\r\nof 1816, stood next Monroe for the presidential nomination. For reasons\r\nwhich neither history nor tradition seems sufficiently to have brought\r\nus, he inspired a strong and even enthusiastic loyalty among many of his\r\nparty. His candidacy in 1824 was more \"regular\" than that of either\r\nAdams, Jackson, or Clay, whose friends combined against him as the\r\nstrongest of them all. Though Crawford had been prostrated by serious\r\ndisease in 1823, Van Buren remained faithful to him until, in 1825,\r\nafter refusing a seat in Adams's cabinet, he retired from national\r\npublic life a thoroughly broken man.\r\n\r\nThe first two sessions of Congress, after Van Buren's service began,\r\nseemed drowsy enough. French land-titles in Louisiana, the settlement of\r\nthe accounts of public officers, the attempt to abolish imprisonment for\r\ndebt, the appropriation for money for diplomatic representatives to the\r\nnew South American states and their recognition,--nothing more exciting\r\nthan these arose, except Monroe's veto, in May, 1822, of the bill\r\nauthorizing the erection of toll-gates upon the Cumberland road and\r\nappropriating $9000 for them. This brought distinctly before the public\r\nthe great question of internal improvements by the federal government,\r\nwhich Van Buren, Benton, and Jackson afterwards chose as one of the\r\nchief battle-grounds for their party. For this bill Van Buren indeed\r\nvoted, while Benton afterwards boasted that he was one of the small\r\nminority of seven who discerned its true character. But this trifling\r\nappropriation was declared by Barbour, who was in charge of the\r\nmeasure, not to involve the general question; it was said to be a mere\r\nincident necessary to save from destruction a work for which earlier\r\nstatesmen were responsible. Monroe, though declaring in his veto that\r\nthe power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvements\r\nnational in their character would have the happiest effect on all the\r\ngreat interests of the Union, decided that the Constitution gave no such\r\npower. Six years later, in a note to his speech upon the power of the\r\nVice-President to call to order for words spoken in debate in the\r\nSenate, Van Buren apologized for his vote on the bill, because it was\r\nhis first session, and because he was sincerely desirous to aid the\r\nWestern country and had voted without full examination. He added that if\r\nthe question were again presented to him, he should vote in the\r\nnegative; and that it had been his only vote in seven years of service\r\nwhich the most fastidious critic could torture into an inconsistency\r\nwith his principles upon internal improvements. In January, 1823, during\r\nhis second session, Van Buren spoke and voted in favor of the bill to\r\nrepair the road, but still took no decided ground upon the general\r\nquestion. He said that the large expenditure already made on the road\r\nwould have been worse than useless if it were now suffered to decay;\r\nthat the road, being already constructed, ought to be preserved; but\r\nwhether he would vote for a new construction he did not disclose. Even\r\nBenton, who was proud to have been one of the small minority against\r\nthe bill of the year before for toll-gates upon the road, was now with\r\nVan Buren, constitutional scruples yielding to the statesmanlike\r\nreluctance to waste an investment of millions of dollars rather than\r\nspend a few thousands to save it.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1824, Van Buren proposed to solve these difficulties by a\r\nconstitutional amendment. Congress was to have power to make roads and\r\ncanals, but the money appropriated was to be apportioned among the\r\nStates according to population. No road or canal was to be made within\r\nany State without the consent of its legislature; and the money was to\r\nbe expended in each State under the direction of its legislature. This\r\nproposal seems to have fallen still-born and deservedly. It illustrated\r\nVan Buren's jealousy of interference with the rights of States. But the\r\nright of each State to be protected, he seemed to forget, involved its\r\nright not to be taxed for improvements in other States which it neither\r\ncontrolled nor promoted. Van Buren's speech in support of the proposal\r\nwould to-day seem very heretical to his party. A dozen years later he\r\nhimself would probably have admitted it to be so. He then believed in\r\nthe abstract proposition that such funds of the nation as could be\r\nraised without oppression, and as were not necessary to the discharge of\r\nindispensable demands upon the government, should be expended upon\r\ninternal improvements under restrictions guarding the sovereignty and\r\nequal interests of the States. Henry Clay would not in theory have gone\r\nmuch further. But to this subject in its national aspect Van Buren had\r\nprobably given but slight attention. The success of the Erie Canal, with\r\nhim doubtless as with others, made adverse theories of government seem\r\nless impressive. But Van Buren and his school quickly became doubtful\r\nand soon hostile to the federal promotion of internal improvements. The\r\nopposition became popular on the broader reasoning that great\r\nexpenditures for internal improvements within the States were not only,\r\nas the statesmen at first argued, violations of the letter of the\r\nConstitution, whose sanctity could, however, be saved by proper\r\namendment, but were intrinsically dangerous, and an unwholesome\r\nextension of the federal power which ought not to take place whether\r\nwithin the Constitution or by amending it. Aided by Jackson's powerful\r\nvetoes, this sentiment gained a strength with the people which has come\r\ndown to our day. We have river and harbor bills, but they are supposed\r\nto touch directly or indirectly our foreign commerce, which, under the\r\nConstitution and upon the essential theory of our confederation, is a\r\nsubject proper to the care of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the same session Van Buren spoke at length in favor of the bill to\r\nabolish imprisonment for debt, and drew with precision the distinction\r\nwisely established by modern jurisprudence, that the property only, and\r\nnot the body of the debtor, should be at the mercy of his creditor,\r\nwhere the debt involved no fraud or breach of trust.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1823-1824 was seriously influenced by the coming\r\npresidential election. The protective tariff of 1824 was christened with\r\nthe absurd name of the \"American system,\" though it was American in no\r\nother or better sense than foreign war to protect fancied national\r\nrights is an American system, and though the system had come from the\r\nmiddle ages in the company of other restrictions upon the intercourse of\r\nnations. It was carried by the factitious help of this designation and\r\nthe fine leadership of Clay. With Jackson and Benton, Van Buren voted\r\nfor it, against men differing as widely from each other as his\r\nassociate, the venerable Federalist Rufus King, differed from Hayne, the\r\nbrilliant orator of South Carolina. Upon the tariff Van Buren then had\r\nviews clearer, at least, than upon internal improvements. In 1824 he was\r\nunmistakably a protectionist. The moderation of his views and the\r\npressure from his own State were afterwards set up as defenses for this\r\nearly attitude of his. But he declared himself with sufficient plainness\r\nnot only to believe in the constitutionality of a protective tariff, but\r\nthat 1824 was a fit year in which to extend its protective features. He\r\nacted, too, with the amplest light upon the subject. The dislike of the\r\nHoly Alliance, the hated recollections of the Orders in Council and the\r\nNapoleonic decrees, the idea that, for self-defense in times of war, the\r\ncountry must be forced to produce many goods not already\r\nproduced,--these considerations had great weight, as very well appears\r\nin the speech for the bill delivered by Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky,\r\nafterwards Van Buren's associate on the presidential ticket. \"When the\r\nmonarchs of Europe are assembled together, do you think,\" he asked,\r\n\"that we are not a subject of their holy consultations?\" But the support\r\nof the bill was upon broader considerations. The debates upon the tariff\r\nin the House of Representatives in February, March, and April, and in\r\nthe Senate in April, 1824, were admirable presentations of the subject.\r\nWebster in the House and Hayne in the Senate put the free trade side.\r\nThe former, still speaking his own sentiments, declared that \"the best\r\napology for laws of prohibition and laws of monopoly will be found in\r\nthat state of society, not only unenlightened but sluggish, in which\r\nthey are most generally established.\" But now, he said, \"competition\r\ncomes in place of monopoly, and intelligence and industry ask only for\r\nfair play and an open field.\" He repudiated the principle of protection.\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said he, \"I think freedom of trade to be the general\r\nprinciple, and restriction the exception.\"\r\n\r\nNor was Van Buren then left without the light which afterwards reached\r\nhim on the constitutional question. Rufus King said that, if gentlemen\r\nwished to encourage the production of hemp and iron, they ought to bring\r\nin a bill to give bounties on those articles; for there was the same\r\nconstitutional right to grant bounties as to levy restrictive duties\r\nupon foreign products. Hayne made the really eloquent and masterly\r\nspeech for which he ought to stand in the first rank of orators, and\r\nwhich summed up as well for free-traders now as then the most telling\r\narguments against artificial restrictions. He skillfully closed with\r\nWashington's words: \"Our commercial policy should hold an equal and\r\nimpartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or\r\npreferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and\r\ndiversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce, but forcing\r\nnothing.\" Hayne did not confine himself to the doctrines of Adam Smith,\r\nor the hardships which protection meant to a planting region like his\r\nown. For the chief interest of the South was in cotton; and the price of\r\ncotton was largely determined by the ability of foreigners to import it\r\nfrom America,--an ability in its turn dependent upon the willingness of\r\nAmerica to take her pay, directly or indirectly, in foreign commodities.\r\nHayne, however, went further. He clearly raised the question, whether\r\nthe encouragement of manufactures could constitutionally be made a\r\nFederal object.\r\n\r\nSitting day after day under this long debate in the little senate\r\nchamber then in use, where men listened to speeches, if for no other\r\nreason, because they were easily heard, Van Buren could not, with his\r\nability and readiness, have misunderstood the general principles\r\ninvolved. Early in the debate, upon a motion to strike out the duty on\r\nhemp, he briefly but explicitly said that \"he was in favor of\r\nincreasing the duty on hemp, with a view of affording protection to its\r\ncultivation in this country.\" He voted against limiting the duty on wool\r\nto twenty-five per cent., but voted against a duty of twenty-five per\r\ncent. on India silks,--a revenue rather than a protective duty. He voted\r\nfor duties on wheat and wheat flour and potatoes. He voted against\r\nstriking out the duty on books, in spite of Hayne's grotesque but\r\nforcible argument that they were to be considered \"a raw material,\r\nessential to the formation of the mind, the morals, and the character of\r\nthe people.\" It is difficult to understand the significance of all Van\r\nBuren's votes on the items of the bill; but the record shows them to\r\nhave been, on the whole, protectionist, with a preference for moderate\r\nrates, but a firm assertion of the wool interests of New York. Benton\r\ntells us that Van Buren was one of the main speakers for the bill; but\r\nthe assertion is not borne out by the record. He delivered no general\r\nspeech upon the subject, as did most of the senators, but seems to have\r\nspoken only upon some of the details as they were considered in\r\ncommittee of the whole. The best to be said in Van Buren's behalf is,\r\nthat his judgment was not yet so ripe upon the matter as not to be still\r\nopen to great change. He was in his third session, and still new to\r\nnational politics, and there was before him the plain and strong\r\nargument that his State wanted protection. In 1835 Butler, speaking for\r\nhim as a presidential candidate, said that his personal feelings had\r\nbeen \"at all times adverse to the high tariff policy.\" But \"high tariff\"\r\nwas then, as now, a merely relative term. His votes placed him in that\r\nyear very near Henry Clay. That from 1824 he grew more and more averse\r\nto the necessary details and results of a protective policy is probably\r\ntrue. Nor ought it to be, even from the standpoint of free-traders,\r\nserious accusation that a public man varies his political utterances\r\nupon the tariff question, if the variation be progressive and steadily\r\ntowards what they deem a greater liberality. To Van Buren, however, the\r\ntariff question never had a capital importance. Even thirty-two years\r\nlater, while rehearsing from his retirement the achievements of his\r\nparty in excuse of the support he reluctantly gave Buchanan, he did not\r\nname among its services its insistence upon merely revenue duties,\r\nalthough he had then for years been himself committed to that doctrine.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's vote for the tariff of 1824 had no very direct relation to\r\nhis political situation. His own successor was not to be chosen for\r\nnearly three years. Crawford, whom he supported for the presidency, was\r\nthe only one of the four candidates opposed to the bill. Adams was\r\nconsistently a protectionist; he believed in actively promoting the\r\nwelfare of men, though chiefly if not exclusively American men, even\r\nwhen they resisted their own welfare. He, like his father, was perfectly\r\nready to use the power of government where it seemingly promised to be\r\neffective, without caring much for economical theories or constitutional\r\nrestrictions. Jackson himself was far enough away from the ranks of\r\nstrict constructionists on the tariff. In April, 1824, in the midst of\r\nthe debate, and while a presidential candidate, he wrote from the Senate\r\nwhat free-traders, who afterwards supported him, would have deemed the\r\nworst of heresies. Like most candidates, ancient and modern, he was \"in\r\nfavor of a judicious examination and revision of\" the tariff. He would\r\nadvocate a tariff so far as it enabled the country to provide itself\r\nwith the means of defense in war. But he would go further. The tariff\r\nought to \"draw from agriculture the superabundant labor, and employ it\r\nin mechanism and manufactures;\" it ought to \"give a proper distribution\r\nto our labor, to take from agriculture in the United States 600,000 men,\r\nwomen, and children.\" It is time, he cried, and quite as extravagantly\r\nas Clay, that \"we should become a little more Americanized.\" How slight\r\na connection the tariff had with the election of 1824 is further seen in\r\nthe fact that Jackson, who thus supported the bill, received the vote of\r\nseveral of the States which strongly opposed the tariff.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1824, Van Buren urged the Senate to act upon a constitutional\r\namendment touching the election of president. As the amendment could not\r\nbe adopted in time to affect the pending canvass, there was, he said, no\r\nroom for partisan feeling. He insisted that if there were no majority\r\nchoice by the electors, the choice should not rest with the house of\r\nrepresentatives voting by States, but that the electors should be\r\nreconvened, and themselves choose between the highest two candidates.\r\nThe debate soon became thoroughly partisan. Rufus King, with but thinly\r\nveiled reference to Crawford's nomination, denounced the practice by\r\nwhich a caucus at Washington deprived the constitutional electors of any\r\nfree choice; members of Congress were attending to president-making\r\nrather than to their duties. He thought that the course of events had\r\n\"led near observers to suspect a connection existing between a central\r\npower of this description at the seat of the general government and the\r\nlegislatures of Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and New York, and\r\nperhaps of other States.\" To this it was pointed out with much force\r\nthat such a caucus had chosen Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe without\r\nscandal or injury; that members of Congress were distinguished and\r\nrepresentative persons familiar with national affairs, who might with\r\ngreat advantage respectfully suggest a course of action to their\r\nfellow-citizens. Van Buren went keenly to the real point of the belated\r\nobjection to the system; it lay in the particular action of the recent\r\ncaucus. He did not think it worth while to consider \"those nice\r\ndistinctions which challenged respect for the proceedings of conventions\r\nof one description and denied it to others; or to detect those still\r\nmore subtle refinements which regarded meetings of the same character\r\nas sometimes proper, and at others destructive of the purity of\r\nelections and dangerous to the liberties of the people.\" After much talk\r\nabout the will of the people, the Senate by a vote of 30 to 13 postponed\r\nthe consideration of the amendments until after the election. Benton\r\njoined Van Buren in the minority, although they did not agree upon the\r\nform of amendment; but Jackson, perhaps because he was a candidate, did\r\nnot vote.\r\n\r\nIt was highly probable that there would be embarrassment in choosing the\r\nnext president. It was already nearly certain that neither candidate\r\nwould have a majority of the electoral votes. The decision was then, as\r\nin our own time, supposed to rest with New York; and naturally therefore\r\nVan Buren's prestige was great, gained, as it had been, in that\r\ndifficult and opulent political field. His attachment to Crawford was\r\nproof against the signs of the latter's decaying strength. Crawford was\r\nto him the Republican candidate regularly chosen, and one agreeable to\r\nhis party by the vigorous democracy of his sentiments. His opposition to\r\nJefferson's embargo, and his vote for a renewal of the charter of the\r\nBank of the United States, had been forgotten since his warm advocacy of\r\nthe late war with England. His formal claims to the nomination were\r\ngreat. For he had been in the Senate as early as 1807, and its president\r\nupon the death of Vice-President Clinton in 1812; afterwards he had been\r\nminister to France, and was now secretary of the treasury. In the\r\ncaucus of 1816 he had nearly as many votes as Monroe; and those votes\r\nwere cast for him, it was said, though without much probability, in\r\nspite of his peremptory refusal to compete with Monroe. Moreover,\r\nCrawford had a majesty and grace of personal appearance which, with\r\nundoubtedly good though not great abilities, had, apart from these\r\ndetails of his career, made him conspicuous in the Republican ranks; and\r\nin its chief service he was, after the retirement of Monroe, the senior,\r\nexcept Adams, whose candidacy was far more recent. Crawford's claim to\r\nthe succession was therefore very justifiable; he was the most obvious,\r\nthe most \"regular,\" of the candidates.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Van Buren was at first inclined to Adams. The\r\nlatter's unequaled public experience and discipline of intellect\r\ndoubtless seemed, to Van Buren's precise and orderly mind, eminent\r\nqualifications for the first office in the land. Adams at this time, by\r\na coincidence not inexplicable, thought highly of Van Buren. He entered\r\nin his diary a remark of his own, in February, 1825, that Van Buren was\r\n\"a man of great talents and of good principles; but he had suffered them\r\nto be too much warped by party spirit.\" This from an Adams may be taken\r\nas extreme praise. It is pretty certain that if Van Buren had\r\nreprehensibly shifted his position from Adams to Crawford, we should\r\nfind a record of it in the vast treasure-house of damnations which Adams\r\nleft. Nor is there good reason to suppose that Van Buren was influenced\r\nby the nomination which Crawford's friends in Georgia gave him in 1824\r\nfor the vice-presidency. This showed that New York had already\r\nsurrendered her favorite \"son to the nation;\" he was now definitely to\r\nbe counted a power in national politics, where he was known as the\r\n\"Albany director.\" Crawford's enemies in Georgia, the Clarkites,\r\nridiculed this nomination with the coarse and silly abuse which active\r\npoliticians to this day are always ready to use in their cynical\r\nunder-estimate of popular intelligence,--abuse which they are by and by\r\npretty sure to be glad to forget. Van Buren was pictured as half man and\r\nhalf cat, half fox and half monkey, half snake and half mink. He was\r\ndubbed \"Blue Whiskey Van\" and \"Little Van.\" The Clarkites, being only a\r\nminority in the Georgia Assembly, delighted to vote for him as their\r\nstanding candidate for doorkeeper and the like humbler positions.\r\n\r\nNew York was greatly disturbed through 1824 over the presidency. Its\r\npolitics were in the position described by Senator Cobb, one of\r\nCrawford's Georgia supporters. \"Could we hit upon a few great\r\nprinciples,\" he wrote home from Washington in January, 1825, \"and unite\r\ntheir support with that of Crawford, we should succeed beyond doubt.\"\r\nBut the great principles were hard to find. The people and the greater\r\npoliticians were therefore swayed by personal preferences, without\r\nstrong reason for either choice; and the lesser politicians were simply\r\nwatching to see how the tide ran. Adams was the most natural choice of\r\nthe New York Republicans. The South had had the presidency for six\r\nterms. His early secession from the Federalists; his aid in solidifying\r\nthe Republican sentiment at the North; his support of Jefferson in the\r\npatriotic embargo struggle; his long, eminent, and fruitful services;\r\nand his place of secretary of state, from which Madison and Monroe had\r\nin turn been promoted to the presidency,--all these commended him to\r\nNorthern Republicans as a proper candidate.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton admired and supported General Jackson. In 1819 the\r\nlatter had at a dinner in Tammany Hall amazed and affronted the former's\r\nBucktail enemies by giving as his toast, \"De Witt Clinton, the\r\nenlightened statesman and governor of the great and patriotic State of\r\nNew York.\" In January, 1824, Clinton was the victim of a political\r\noutrage which illustrated the harsh partisanship then ruling in New York\r\npolitics, and may well have determined the choice of president. Clinton\r\nhad retired from the governor's chair; but he still held the honorary\r\nand unpaid office of canal commissioner, to which he brought\r\ndistinguished honor but which brought none to him, and whose importance\r\nhe more than any other man had created. The Crawford men in the\r\nlegislature feared a combination of the men of the new People's party\r\nwith the Clintonians on the presidential question. Clinton seemed at the\r\ntime an unpopular character. To embarrass the People's party, Clinton's\r\nenemies suddenly, and just before the rising of the legislature, offered\r\na resolution removing him from the canal commissionership. The People's\r\nparty, it was thought, by opposing the resolution, would incur popular\r\ndislike through their alliance with the few and unpopular Clintonians;\r\nwhile by supporting the resolution they would forfeit the support of the\r\nlatter upon which they relied. In either case the Crawford men would\r\napparently profit by the trick. The People's party men, including those\r\nfavoring Adams for president, at once seized the wrong horn of the\r\ndilemma, and voted for Clinton's removal, which was thus carried by an\r\nalmost unanimous vote. But the people themselves were underrated; the\r\noutrage promptly restored Clinton to popular favor. In spite of the\r\nresistance of the politicians, he was, in the fall of 1824, elected by a\r\nlarge majority to the governor's seat, to which, or to any great office,\r\nit had been supposed he could never return; and this, although at the\r\nsame time and upon the same ticket one of those who had voted for his\r\nremoval was chosen lieutenant-governor. Van Buren was no party to this\r\nremoval, although his political friends at Albany were the first movers\r\nin the scheme. He himself was far-sighted enough to see the probable\r\neffect of so gross and indecent a use of political power. Nor was he so\r\nrelentless a partisan as to remember in unfruitful vengeance Clinton's\r\nown prescriptive conduct, or to remove the latter from an honorary\r\nseat which belonged to him above all other men. By this silly blunder\r\nClinton was again raised to deserved power, which he held until his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: De Witt Clinton]\r\n\r\nThe popular outburst consequent upon Clinton's removal in January, 1824,\r\nmade it very dangerous for the Bucktails to leave to the people in the\r\nfall the choice of presidential electors. The rise of the People's party\r\nfor a time seriously threatened Van Buren's influence. Until 1824 the\r\npresidential electors of New York had been chosen by its legislature.\r\nThe opponents of Crawford and Van Buren, fearing that the latter's\r\nsuperior political skill would more easily capture the legislature in\r\nNovember, 1824, raised at the legislative elections of 1823 a cry\r\nagainst the Albany Regency, and demanded that presidential electors\r\nshould be chosen directly by the people. The Regency, popularly believed\r\nto have been founded by Van Buren, consisted of a few able followers of\r\nhis, residing or in office at Albany. They were also called the\r\n\"conspirators.\" Chief among them were William L. Marcy, the comptroller;\r\nSamuel A. Talcott, the attorney-general; Benjamin F. Butler, then\r\ndistrict attorney of Albany county; Edwin Croswell, the state printer;\r\nRoger Skinner, the United States district judge; and Benjamin Knower,\r\nthe state treasurer. Later there joined the Regency, Silas Wright,\r\nAzariah C. Flagg, Thomas W. Olcott, and Charles E. Dudley. Its members\r\nwere active, skillful, shrewd politicians; and they were much more. They\r\nwere men of strong political convictions, holding and observing a high\r\nstandard for the public service, and of undoubted personal integrity. In\r\n1830 John A. Dix gave as a chief reason for accepting office at Albany\r\nthat he should there be \"one of the Regency.\" His son, Dr. Morgan Dix,\r\ndescribes their aggressive honesty, their refusal \"to tolerate in those\r\nwhom they could control what their own fine sense of honor did not\r\napprove;\" and he quotes a remark made to him by Thurlow Weed, their long\r\nand most formidable enemy, \"that he had never known a body of men who\r\npossessed so much power and used it so well.\" In his Memoirs, Weed\r\ndescribes their \"great ability, great industry, indomitable courage.\"\r\nTwo at least of the original members, Marcy and Butler, afterwards\r\njustly rose to national distinction. Even to our own day, the Albany\r\nRegency has been a strong and generally a sagacious influence in its\r\nparty. John A. Dix, Horatio Seymour, Dean Richmond, and Samuel J. Tilden\r\nlong directed its policy; and from the chief seat in its councils the\r\nlate secretary of the treasury, Daniel Manning, was chosen in 1885.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1823, the People's party elected only a minority of the\r\nlegislature; but many of the Democrats were committed to the support of\r\nan electoral law, and the movement was clearly popular. A just, though\r\npossibly an insufficient objection to the law was its proposal of a\r\ngreat change in anticipation of a particular election whose candidates\r\nwere already before the public. But there was no resort to frank\r\nargument. Its indirect defeat was proposed by the Democratic managers,\r\nand accomplished with the coöperation of many supporters of Adams and\r\nClay. A bill was reported in the Assembly, where the Regency was in a\r\nminority, giving the choice of the electors to the people directly, but\r\ncunningly requiring a majority instead of a plurality vote to elect. If\r\nthere were no majority, then the choice was to be left to the\r\nlegislature. The Adams and Clay men were unwilling to let a plurality\r\nelect, lest in the uncertain state of public feeling some other\r\ncandidate might be at the head of the poll; and they were probably now\r\nquite as confident as the Bucktails, and with more reason, of their\r\nstrength upon joint ballot in the legislature. Divided as the people of\r\nNew York were between the four presidential candidates, it was well\r\nknown that this device would really give them no choice. The\r\nconsideration of the electoral law was postponed in the Senate upon a\r\npretense of objection to the form of the bill, and with insincere\r\nprotestations of a desire to pass it. The outcome of all this was that\r\nin the election of November, 1824, the Democrats were punished at the\r\npolls both for the wanton attack on Clinton and for their unprincipled\r\ntreatment of the electoral bill. The Regency got no more than a small\r\nminority in the legislature; and De Witt Clinton, as has been said, was\r\nchosen governor by a great majority.\r\n\r\nCrawford's supporters at Washington believed that in a congressional\r\ncaucus he would have a larger vote than any other candidate. His\r\nopponents, in the same belief, refused to join in a caucus, in spite of\r\nthe cry that their refusal was a treason to old party usage. The\r\nRepublicans at Albany, probably upon Van Buren's advice, had in April,\r\n1823, declared in favor of a caucus, but without effect. Two thirds of\r\nCongress would not assent. At last, in February, 1824, a caucus was\r\ncalled, doubtless in the hope that many who had refused their assent\r\nwould, finding the caucus inevitable, attend through force of party\r\nhabit. But of the 261 members of Congress, only 66 attended; and they\r\nwere chiefly from New York, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia. In the\r\ncaucus 62 voted for Crawford for president and 57 for Albert Gallatin\r\nfor vice-president. A cry was soon raised against the latter as a\r\nforeigner; so that in spite of his American residence of forty-five\r\nyears, and his invaluable services to the country and to the Republican\r\nparty through nearly all this period, he felt compelled to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the caucus almost destroyed Crawford's chances, though\r\nVan Buren steadily kept up courage. A few days later he wrote a\r\nconfidential letter complaining of the subserviency and ingratitude of\r\nthe non-attendants, who had \"partaken largely of the favor of the\r\nparty;\" but despondency, he said, was a weakness with which he was but\r\nlittle annoyed, and if New York should be firm and promptly explicit,\r\nthe election would be substantially settled. But New York was neither\r\nfirm nor promptly explicit. Its electoral vote was in doubt until the\r\nmeeting of the legislature in November. The Adams and Clay forces then\r\nunited, securing 31 out of the 36 electors, although one of the 31 seems\r\nfinally to have voted for Jackson. Five Crawford electors were chosen\r\nwith the help of the Adams men, who wished to keep Clay at the foot of\r\nthe poll of presidential electors, and thus prevent his eligibility as\r\none of the highest three in the House of Representatives. This device of\r\nthe Adams men may have deprived Clay of the presidency. Thus Van Buren's\r\nNew York campaign met defeat even in the legislature, where his friends\r\nhad incurred odium rather than surrender the choice of electors to the\r\npeople, while his forces were being thoroughly beaten by the people at\r\nthe polls. In the electoral college Crawford received only 41 votes;\r\nAdams had 84 and Jackson 99; while Clay with only 37 was fourth in the\r\nrace, and could not therefore enter the contest in the House. Georgia\r\ncast 9 electoral votes for Van Buren as vice-president.\r\n\r\nVan Buren did not figure in the choice of Adams in the House by the\r\ncoalition of Adams and Clay forces. Nor does his name appear in the\r\ntraditions of the manoeuvering at Washington in the winter of 1824-25,\r\nexcept in a vague and improbable story that he wished, by dividing the\r\nNew York delegation in the House on the first vote by States, to prevent\r\na choice, and then to throw the votes of the Crawford members for\r\nAdams, and thus secure the glory and political profit of apparently\r\nelecting him. He did not join in the cry that Adams's election over\r\nJackson was a violation of the democratic principle. Nor was it a\r\nviolation of that principle. Jackson had but a minority of the popular\r\nvote. Clay was in political principles and habits nearer to Adams than\r\nJackson. It was clearly Clay's duty to take his strength to the\r\ncandidate whose administration was most likely to be agreeable to those\r\nopinions of his own which had made him a candidate. The coalition was\r\nperfectly natural and legitimate; and it was wholesome in its\r\nconsequences. It established the Whig party; it at least helped to\r\nestablish the modern Democratic party. That the acceptance of office by\r\nClay would injure him was probable enough. Coalitions have always been\r\nunpopular in America and England, when there has seemed to follow a\r\ndivision of offices. They offend the strong belief in party government\r\nwhich lies deep in the political conscience of the two countries.\r\n\r\nIn the congressional session of 1824-25 president-making in the House\r\nstood in the way of everything else of importance. Van Buren, with\r\nincreasing experience, was taking a greater and greater part in\r\ncongressional work. He joined far more frequently in the debates. Again\r\nhe spoke for the abolition of imprisonment for debt, his colleague,\r\nRufus King, differing from him on this as he now seemed to differ from\r\nhim on most disputed questions. King had not been reëlected senator,\r\nhaving declined to be a candidate, because, as he said, of his advancing\r\nyears. But doubtless Van Buren was correct in telling John Quincy Adams,\r\nand the latter was correct in believing, as his diary records, that King\r\ncould not have been re-chosen.\r\n\r\nAt this session Van Buren took definite stand against the schemes of\r\ninternal improvement. On February 11, 1825, differing even from Benton,\r\nhe voted against topographical surveys in anticipation of public works\r\nby the Federal government. On February 23 he voted against an\r\nappropriation of $150,000 to extend the Cumberland road, while Jackson\r\nand Benton both voted for it. So, also, the next day, when Jackson voted\r\nfor federal subscriptions to help construct the Delaware and Chesapeake\r\nCanal and the Dismal Swamp Canal, Van Buren was against him. Two days\r\nbefore the session closed he voted against the bill for the occupation\r\nof Oregon, Benton and Jackson voting in the affirmative. Van Buren was\r\none of the senatorial committee to receive the new president upon his\r\ninauguration. It was doubtless with the easy courtesy which was genuine\r\nwith him that he welcomed John Quincy Adams to the political battle so\r\ndisastrous to the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met again, in December, 1825, Van Buren took a more\r\nimportant place than ever before in national politics. He now became a\r\ntrue parliamentary leader; for he, like Clay, had the really\r\nparliamentary career which has rarely been seen in this country.\r\nDealing with amorphous political elements, Van Buren created out of them\r\na party to promote his policy, and seized upon the vigor and popular\r\nstrength of Jackson to lead both party and policy to supreme power.\r\nWhile, before 1825, Van Buren had not represented in the Senate a party\r\ndistinctly constituted, from 1825 to 1828 he definitely led the\r\nformation of the modern Democratic party. In this work he was clearly\r\nchief. From the floor of the Senate he addressed those of its members\r\ninclined to his creed, and the sympathetic elements throughout the\r\ncountry, and firmly guided and disciplined them after that fashion which\r\nin very modern days is best familiar to us in the parliamentary\r\nconflicts of Great Britain. Since Van Buren wielded this organizing\r\npower, there has been in America no equally authoritative and decisive\r\nleadership from the Senate; although he has since been surpassed there,\r\nnot only as an orator, but in other kinds of senatorial work. Seward\r\nseemed to exercise a like leadership in the six years or more preceding\r\nLincoln's election; but he was far more the creature of the stupendous\r\nmovement of the time than he was its creator. So, in the two years\r\nbefore General Grant's renomination in 1872, Charles Sumner and Carl\r\nSchurz, speaking from the Senate, created a new party sentiment; but the\r\nsentiment died in a \"midsummer madness\" but for which our later\r\npolitical history might have been materially different. In the\r\ninteresting and fruitful three years of Van Buren's senatorial\r\nopposition, he showed the same qualities of firmness, supple tact, and\r\ndistinct political aims which had given him his power in New York; but\r\nall now upon a higher plane.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1825, Jackson was no longer in the Senate. His Tennessee\r\nfriends had placed him there as in a fitting vestibule to the White\r\nHouse; but it seemed as hard then as it has been since, to go from the\r\nSenate over the apparently broad and easy mile to the west on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue. So Jackson returned to the Hermitage, to await, in\r\nthe favorite American character of Cincinnatus, the popular summons\r\nwhich he believed to be only delayed. Van Buren, now thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the general, saw in him the strongest titular leader of\r\nthe opposition. It is pretty certain, however, that Van Buren's\r\npreference was recent. The \"Albany Argus,\" a Van Buren paper, had but\r\nlately declared that \"Jackson has not a single feeling in common with\r\nthe Republican party, and makes the merit of desiring the total\r\nextinction of it;\" while Jackson papers had ridiculed Crawford's\r\n\r\n  \"Shallow knaves with forms to mock us,\r\n  Straggling, one by one, to caucus.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the tradition, carefully and doubtless sincerely begun by\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, and adopted by most writers dealing with this period,\r\nthat Adams met his first Congress in a spirit which should have\r\ncommanded universal support; and that it was a factious opposition,\r\ncunningly led by Van Buren, which thwarted his patriotic purposes. But\r\nthis is an untrue account of the second great party division in the\r\nUnited States. The younger Adams succeeded to an administration which\r\nhad represented no party, or rather which had represented a party now\r\nbecome so dominant as to practically include the whole country. As\r\npresident he found himself able to promote opinions with a weighty\r\nauthority which he had not enjoyed while secretary of state in an era of\r\ngood feeling, and under a president who was firm, even if gentle. Nor\r\nwas it likely that Adams, with his unrivaled experience, his resolute\r\nself-reliance, and his aggressively patriotic feeling, would fail to\r\nimpress his own views upon the public service, lest he might disturb a\r\nsupposititious unanimity of sentiment. His first message boldly sounded\r\nthe notes of party division. The second war with England was well out of\r\nthe public mind; and his old Federalist associations, his belief in a\r\nstrong, active, beneficent federal government, his traditional dislike\r\nof what seemed to him extreme democratic tendencies and constitutional\r\nrefinings away of necessary federal power,--all these made him promptly\r\nand ably take an attitude very different from that of his predecessors.\r\nThe compliment was perfectly sincere which, in his inaugural address, he\r\nhad paid the Republican and Federalist parties, saying of them that both\r\nhad \"contributed splendid talents, spotless integrity, ardent\r\npatriotism, and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and\r\nadministration\" of the government. But it was idle for him to suppose\r\nthat the successors of these parties, although from both had come his\r\nown supporters, and although, as in his offer of the treasury to\r\nCrawford, he showed his desire, even in the chief offices, to ignore\r\npolitical differences, would remain united under him, if he espoused\r\ncauses upon which they widely differed. After recapitulating the tenets\r\nof American political faith, and showing that most discordant elements\r\nof public opinion were now blended into harmony, he was again perfectly\r\nsincere in saying that only an effort of magnanimity needed to be made,\r\nthat individuals should discard every remnant of rancor against each\r\nother. This advice he was himself unable to follow; and so were other\r\nmen. In his inaugural he distinctly adopted as his own the policy of\r\ninternal improvements by the federal government, although he knew how\r\nwide and determined had been the opposition to it. His own late chief,\r\nMonroe, had pronounced the policy unconstitutional. But he now told the\r\npeople that the magnificence and splendor of the public works, the roads\r\nand aqueducts, of Rome, were among the imperishable splendors of the\r\nancient republic. He asked to what single individual our first national\r\nroad had proved an injury. Of the constitutional doubts which were\r\nraised, he said, with a touch of the contempt of a practical\r\nadministrator: \"Every speculative scruple will be solved by a practical\r\nblessing.\" To the self-consecrated guardians of the Constitution this\r\nwas as corrupt as offers of largesses to plebeians at Rome. In his first\r\nmessage he recommended again the policy of internal improvements, and\r\nproposed the establishment of a national university. Although he\r\nadmitted the Constitution to be \"a charter of limited powers,\" he still\r\nintimated his opinion that its powers might \"be effectually brought into\r\naction by laws promoting the improvement of agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures, the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic and of\r\nthe elegant arts, the advancement of literature, and the progress of the\r\nsciences, ornamental and profound;\" and that to refrain from exercising\r\nthese powers for the benefit of the people themselves, would be to hide\r\nthe talent in the earth, and a \"treachery to the most sacred of trusts.\"\r\nFurther, he now broached the novel project of the congress at Panama,--a\r\nproject surely doubtful enough to permit conscientious opposition.\r\n\r\nAll this was widely different from the messages of content from\r\nPresident Monroe. There was in these new utterances a clear political\r\ndiversion, marked not less by the brilliant and restless genius of Henry\r\nClay, now the secretary of state, than by the President's consciousness\r\nof his own strong and disciplined ability. Here was a new policy\r\nformally presented by a new administration; and a formal and organized\r\nresistance was as sure to follow as effect to follow cause. Van Buren\r\nwas soon at the head of this inevitable opposition. It is difficult, at\r\nleast in the records of Congress, to find any evidence justifying the\r\nlong tradition that the opposition was factious or unworthy. It was\r\ndoubtless a warfare, with its surprises, its skirmishes, and its pitched\r\nbattles. Mistakes of the adversary were promptly used. Debates were not\r\nhad simply to promote the formal business before the House, but rather\r\nto reach the listening voters. But all this belongs to parliamentary\r\nwarfare. Nor is it inconsistent with most exalted aims and an admirable\r\nperformance of public business in a free country. Gladstone, the\r\ngreatest living master in the work of political reform, has described\r\nhimself as an \"old parliamentary hand.\" Nor in the motions, the\r\nresolutions, the debates, led by Van Buren during his three years of\r\nopposition, can one find any device which Palmerston or Derby or\r\nGladstone in one forum, and Seward and even Adams himself in his last\r\nand best years in another, have not used with little punishment from\r\ndisinterested and enduring criticism.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Adams's inauguration Van Buren voted for Clay's\r\nconfirmation as secretary of state, while Jackson and fourteen other\r\nsenators, including Hayne, voted to reject him, upon the unfounded story\r\nof Clay's sale of the presidency to Adams for the office to which he was\r\nnow nominated. Van Buren's language and demeanor towards the new\r\nadministration were uniformly becoming. He charged political but not\r\npersonal wrong-doing; he made no insinuation of base motives; and his\r\nopposition throughout was the more forcible for its very decorum.\r\n\r\nThe first great battle between the rapidly dividing forces was over the\r\nPanama mission, a creation of Clay's exuberant imagination. The\r\npresident nominated to the Senate two envoys to an American congress\r\ncalled by the new South American republics of Columbia, Mexico, and\r\nCentral America, and in which it was proposed that Peru and Chile also\r\nshould participate. The congress was to be held at Panama, which, in the\r\nextravagant rhetoric of some of the Republicans of the South, would, if\r\nthe world had to elect a capital, be pointed out for that august\r\ndestiny, placed as it was \"in the centre of the globe.\" Spain had not\r\nyet acknowledged the independence of her revolted colonies; and it was\r\nclear that the discussions of the congress must be largely concerned\r\nwith a mutual protection of American nations which implied an attitude\r\nhostile to Spain. Adams, in his message nominating the envoys, declared\r\nthat they were not to take part in deliberations of belligerent\r\ncharacter, or to contract alliances or to engage in any project\r\nimporting hostility to any other nation. But referring to the Monroe\r\ndoctrine, Adams said that the mission looked to an agreement between the\r\nnations represented, that each would guard by its own means against the\r\nestablishment of any future European colony within its borders; and it\r\nlooked also to an effort on the part of the United States to promote\r\nreligious liberty among those intolerant republics. The decisive\r\ninducement, he added, to join in the congress was to lay the foundation\r\nof future intercourse with those states \"in the broadest principles of\r\nreciprocity and the most cordial feelings of fraternal friendship.\"\r\n\r\nThis was vague enough. But when the diplomatic papers were exhibited, it\r\nwas plain that the southern republics proposed a congress looking to a\r\nclose defensive alliance, a sort of confederacy or Amphictyonic council\r\nas Benton described it; and that it was highly improbable that the\r\nrepresentatives from one country could responsibly participate in the\r\ncongress without most serious danger of incurring obligations, or\r\nfalling into precisely the embarrassments which the well settled policy\r\nof the United States had avoided. It was perfectly agreeable to Adams,\r\nresolute and aggressive American that he was, that his country should\r\nlook indulgently upon the smaller American powers, should stand at their\r\nhead, should counsel them in their difficulties with European nations,\r\nand jealously take their side in those difficulties. Clay's eager,\r\nenthusiastic mind delighted in the picture of a great leadership of\r\nAmerica by the United States, an American system of nations, breathing\r\nthe air of republicanism, asserting a young and haughty independence of\r\nmonarchical Europe, and ready for opposition to its schemes. In all this\r\nthere has been fascination to many American minds, which even in our own\r\nday we have seen influence American diplomacy. But it was a step into\r\nthe entangling alliances against which American public opinion had from\r\nWashington's day been set. When Adams asked an appropriation for the\r\nexpenses of the mission, he told the House of Representatives that he\r\nwas hardly sanguine enough to promise \"all or even any of the\r\ntranscendent benefits to the human race which warmed the conceptions of\r\nits first proposer,\" but that it looked \"to the melioration of the\r\ncondition of man;\" that it was congenial with the spirit which prompted\r\nour own declaration of independence, which dictated our first treaty\r\nwith Prussia, and \"which filled the hearts and fired the souls of the\r\nimmortal founders of our revolution.\"\r\n\r\nSuch fanciful speculation the Republicans, led by Van Buren, opposed\r\nwith strong and heated protests, in tone not unlike the Liberal protests\r\nof 1878 in England against Disraeli's Jingo policy. In the secret\r\nsession of the Senate Van Buren proposed resolutions against the\r\nconstitutionality of the mission, reciting that it was a departure from\r\nour wise and settled policy; that, for the conference and discussion\r\ncontemplated, our envoys already accredited to the new republics were\r\ncompetent, without becoming involved as members of the congress. These\r\nresolutions, so the President at once wrote in his opulent and\r\ninvaluable diary, \"are the fruit of the ingenuity of Martin Van Buren\r\nand bear the impress of his character.\" The mission was, the opposition\r\nthus insisted, unconstitutional; a step enlarging the sphere of the\r\nfederal government; a meddlesome and dangerous interference with foreign\r\nnations; and if it lay in the course of a strong and splendid policy,\r\nit was also part of a policy full of warlike possibilities almost sure\r\nto drag us into old-world quarrels. Clay's \"American system,\" Hayne said\r\nin the senatorial debate, meant restriction and monopoly when applied to\r\nour domestic policy, and \"entangling alliances\" when applied to our\r\nforeign policy.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's speech was very able. He did not touch upon the liberality\r\nof the Spanish Americans towards races other than the Caucasian, which\r\npeered out of Hayne's speech as one of the Southern objections. After\r\nusing the wise and seemingly pertinent language of Washington against\r\nsuch foreign involvements, Van Buren skillfully referred to the very\r\nPrussian treaty which the President had cited in his message to the\r\nHouse. The elder Adams, the Senate was reminded, had departed from the\r\nrule commended by his great predecessor. He had told his first Congress\r\nthat we were indeed to keep ourselves distinct and separate from the\r\npolitical system of Europe \"if we can,\" but that we needed early and\r\ncontinual information of political projects in contemplation; that\r\nhowever we might consider ourselves, others would consider us a weight\r\nin the balance of power in Europe, which never could be forgotten or\r\nneglected; and that it was natural for us, studying to be neutral, to\r\nconsult with other nations engaged in the same study. The younger Adams\r\nhad been, Van Buren pointed out, appointed upon the Berlin mission to\r\ncarry out these heretical suggestions of his father. The Republicans of\r\nthat day had vigorously opposed the mission; and for their opposition\r\nwere denounced as a faction, and lampooned and vilified \"by all the\r\npresses supporting and supported by the government, and a host of\r\nmalicious parasites generaled by its patronage.\" But, covered with\r\nWashington's mantle, the Republicans of '98 had sought to strangle at\r\nits birth this political hydra, this first attempt since the\r\nestablishment of the government to subject our political affairs to the\r\nterms and conditions of political connection with a foreign nation.\r\nProbably anticipating the success of the administration senators by a\r\nmajority of five, Van Buren ingeniously reminded the Senate that those\r\nearly Republicans had failed with a majority of four against them. But\r\nit was to be remembered, he continued, that after a few more such\r\nFederalist victories the ruin of Federalism had been complete. Its\r\ndoctrines had speedily received popular condemnation. The new\r\nadministration under the presidency of that early minister to Prussia\r\nhad returned to the practices of the Federalist party, to which Van\r\nBuren with courteous indirection let it be remembered that the president\r\nhad originally belonged. Except a guaranty to Spain of its dominions\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, which Jefferson had offered as part of the price\r\nof a cession of the territory between that river and the Mobile, the\r\nadministrations of Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe had strictly followed\r\nthe admonition of Washington: \"Peace, commerce, and honest friendship\r\nwith all nations, entangling alliances with none.\" If we were asked to\r\nform a connection with European states, such as was proposed with the\r\nsouthern republics, Van Buren argued, no American would approve it; and\r\nthere was no sound reason, there was nothing but fanciful sentiment, to\r\ninduce us to distinguish between the states of Europe and those of South\r\nAmerica. Grant that there was a Holy Alliance in monarchical Europe, was\r\nit not a hollow glory, inconsistent with a sober view of American\r\ninterests, to create a holy alliance in republican America? It might\r\nindeed be easy to agree upon speculative opinions with our younger\r\nneighbors at the south; but we should be humiliated in their eyes, and\r\ndifficulties would at once arise, when means of promoting those opinions\r\nwere proposed, and we were then to say we could talk but not fight. The\r\nMonroe doctrine was not to be withdrawn; but we ought to be left free to\r\nact upon it without the burden of promises, express or implied. The\r\nproposed congress was a specious and disguised step towards an American\r\nconfederacy, full of embarrassment, full of danger; and the first step\r\nshould be firmly resisted. Such was the outline of Van Buren's argument;\r\nand its wisdom has commanded a general assent from that day.\r\n\r\nDickerson of New Jersey very well phrased sound American sentiment when\r\nhe said in the debate that, next to a passion for war, he dreaded a\r\npassion for diplomacy. The majestic declamation of Webster, his\r\npathetic picture of a South America once oppressed but now emancipated,\r\nhis eloquent cry that if it were weak to feel that he was an American it\r\nwas a weakness from which he claimed no exemption,--all this met a good\r\ndeal of exuberant response through the country. But it failed, as in our\r\nhistory most such efforts have failed, to convince the practical\r\njudgment of Americans, a judgment never long dazzled or inspired by the\r\npicture of an America wielding enormous or dominant international power.\r\nThe Panama congress met in the absence of the American representatives,\r\nwho had been delayed. It made a treaty of friendship and perpetual\r\nconfederation to which all other American powers might accede within a\r\nyear. The congress was to meet annually in time of common war, and\r\nbiennially in times of peace. But it never met again. The \"centre of the\r\nworld\" was too far away from its very neighbors. Even South American\r\nrepublics could not be kept together by effusions of republican glory\r\nand international love.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its victory in Congress, Adams's administration had plainly\r\nopened with a serious mistake. The opposition was perfectly legitimate;\r\nand although in the debate it was spoken of as unorganized, it certainly\r\ncame out of the debate a pretty definite party. Before the debate Adams\r\nhad written in his diary, and truly, that it was the first subject upon\r\nwhich a great effort had been made \"to combine the discordant elements\r\nof the Crawford and Jackson and Calhoun men into a united opposition\r\nagainst the administration.\" Although some of the Southern opposition\r\nwas heated by a dislike of States in which negroes were to be\r\nadministrators, the division was not at all upon a North and South line.\r\nWith Van Buren voted Findlay of Pennsylvania, Chandler and Holmes of\r\nMaine, Woodbury of New Hampshire, Dickerson of New Jersey, Kane of\r\nIllinois, making seven Northern with twelve Southern senators. Against\r\nVan Buren were eight senators from slave States, Barton of Missouri,\r\nBouligny and Johnston of Louisiana, Chambers of Alabama, Clayton and Van\r\nDyke of Delaware, Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky, and Smith of Maryland.\r\nIt was an incipient but a true party division.\r\n\r\nThroughout this session of 1824-25 Van Buren was very industrious in the\r\nSenate, and nearly, if not quite, its most conspicuous member, if\r\naccount be not taken of Randolph's furious and blazing talents. Calhoun\r\nwas only in the chair as vice-president; the great duel between him and\r\nVan Buren not yet begun. Clay was at the head of the cabinet, and\r\nWebster in the lower House. Jackson was in Tennessee, watching with\r\nangry confidence, and aiding, the rising tide with the political\r\ndexterity in which he was by no means a novice. Having only a minority\r\nwith him, and with Benton frequently against him, Van Buren gradually\r\ndrilled his party into opposition on internal improvements,--a most\r\nlegitimate and important issue. In December, 1825, he threw down the\r\ngauntlet to the administration, or rather took up its gauntlet. He\r\nproposed a resolution \"that Congress does not possess the power to make\r\nroads and canals within the respective States.\" At the same time he\r\nasked for a committee to prepare a constitutional amendment on the\r\nsubject like his earlier proposal, saying with a touch of very polite\r\npartisanship that though the President's recent declaration, that the\r\npower clearly existed in the Constitution, might diminish, it did not\r\nobviate the necessity of an amendment. In March, April, and May, 1826,\r\nhe opposed appropriations of $110,000 to continue the Cumberland road,\r\nand of $50,000 for surveys preparatory to roads and canals, and\r\nsubscriptions to stock of the Louisville and Portland Canal Company and\r\nof the Dismal Swamp Canal Company. All these were distinctly\r\nadministration measures.\r\n\r\nAlthough the principles advanced by Van Buren in this part of his\r\nopposition have not since obtained complete and unanimous affirmance,\r\nthey have at least commanded so large, honorable, and prolonged support,\r\nthat his attitude can with little good sense be considered one of\r\nfactious difference. Especially wise was he on the question of\r\ngovernment subscriptions to private canal companies. Upon one of these\r\nbills he said, in May, 1826, that he did not believe that the government\r\nhad the constitutional power to make canals or to grant money for them;\r\nbut he added that, if he believed otherwise, the grant of money should,\r\nhe thought, be made directly, and not by forming a partnership between\r\nthe government and a private corporation. In 1824 he had voted for the\r\nroad from Missouri to New Mexico; but this stood, as the Pacific railway\r\nlater stood, upon a different principle, the former as a road entirely\r\nwithout state limits and a means of international commerce, and the\r\nlatter a road chiefly through federal territories, and of obvious\r\nnational importance in the war between the North and the South.\r\n\r\nThe proposed amendment of the Constitution to prevent the election of\r\npresident by a vote of States in the House of Representatives, upon\r\nwhich Van Buren had spoken in 1824, had now acquired new interest. Van\r\nBuren seized Adams's election in the House as a good subject for\r\npolitical warfare; and it was clearly a legitimate topic for party\r\ndiscussion and division. Van Buren would have been far more exalted in\r\nhis notions of political agitation than the greatest of political\r\nleaders, had he not sought to use the popular feeling, that the American\r\nwill had been subverted by the decision of the House, to promote his\r\nplan of constitutional reform. He told the Senate in May, 1826, that he\r\nwas satisfied that there was no one point on which the people of the\r\nUnited States were more perfectly united than upon the propriety of\r\ntaking the choice of president from the House. But Congress was not\r\nready for the change; however much in theory was to be said against the\r\nclumsy system which nearly made Burr president in 1801,[3] and which\r\nproduced in 1825 a choice which Adams himself declared that he would\r\nvacate if the Constitution provided a mode of doing it.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the judiciary committee, Van Buren participated in a most\r\nlaborious effort to enlarge the federal judiciary. Upon the question\r\nwhether the judges of the Supreme Court should be relieved from circuit\r\nduty, he made an elaborate and very able speech upon the negative side.\r\nThe opportunity arose for a disquisition on the danger of centralized\r\ngovernment, and for a renewal of the criticisms he had made in the New\r\nYork Constitutional Convention upon the common and absurd picture of\r\njudges as dwellers in an atmosphere above all human infirmity, and\r\nbeyond the reach of popular impression. Van Buren said, what all\r\nsensible men know, that in spite of every effort, incompetent men will\r\nsometimes reach the judicial bench. If always sitting among associates\r\n_in banc_, their incompetence would be shielded, he said, by their abler\r\nbrethren. But if regularly compelled to perform their great duties alone\r\nand in the direct face of the people, and not in the isolation of\r\nWashington, there was another constraint, Van Buren said very\r\ndemocratically and with substantial truth. \"There is a power in public\r\nopinion in this country,\" he declared, \"and I thank God for it, for it\r\nis the most honest and best of all powers, which will not tolerate an\r\nincompetent or unworthy man to hold in his weak or wicked hands the\r\nlives and fortunes of his fellow citizens.\" He added an expression to\r\nwhich he would afterwards have given most narrow interpretation. The\r\nSupreme Court stood, he said, \"as the umpire between the conflicting\r\npowers of the general and state governments.\" There was in the speech\r\nvery plain though courteous intimation of that jealousy with which Van\r\nBuren's party examined the political utterances of the court from\r\nJefferson's time until, years after Van Buren's retirement, the party\r\nfound it convenient to receive from the court, with a sanctimonious air\r\nof veneration, the most odious and demoralizing of all its expressions\r\nof political opinion. In arguing for a close and democratic relation\r\nbetween the judges and the different parts of the country, and against\r\ntheir dignified and exalted seclusion at Washington which was so\r\nagreeable to many patriotic Americans, Van Buren said, in a passage\r\nwhich is fairly characteristic of his oratorical manner:--\r\n\r\n    \"A sentiment I had almost said of idolatry for the Supreme Court\r\n    has grown up, which claims for its members an almost entire\r\n    exemption from the fallibilities of our nature, and arraigns with\r\n    unsparing bitterness the motives of all who have the temerity to\r\n    look with inquisitive eyes into this consecrated sanctuary of the\r\n    law. So powerful has this sentiment become, such strong hold has\r\n    it taken upon the press of this country, that it requires not a\r\n    little share of firmness in a public man, however imperious may be\r\n    his duty, to express sentiments that conflict with it. It is\r\n    nevertheless correct, sir, that in this, as in almost every other\r\n    case, the truth is to be found in a just medium of the subject. To\r\n    so much of the high-wrought eulogies (which the fashion of the\r\n    times has recently produced in such great abundance) as allows to\r\n    the distinguished men who now hold in their hands that portion of\r\n    the administration of public affairs, talents of the highest order,\r\n    and spotless integrity, I cheerfully add the very humble testimony\r\n    of my unqualified assent. That the uncommon man who now presides\r\n    over the court, and who I hope may long continue to do so, is, in\r\n    all human probability, the ablest judge now sitting upon any\r\n    judicial bench in the world, I sincerely believe. But to the\r\n    sentiment which claims for the judges so great a share of exemption\r\n    from the feelings that govern the conduct of other men, and for the\r\n    court the character of being the safest depository of political\r\n    power, I do not subscribe. I have been brought up in an opposite\r\n    faith, and all my experience has confirmed me in its correctness.\r\n    In my legislation upon this subject I will act in conformity to\r\n    those opinions. I believe the judges of the Supreme Court (great\r\n    and good men as I cheerfully concede them to be) are subject to the\r\n    same infirmities, influenced by the same passions, and operated\r\n    upon by the same causes, that good and great men are in other\r\n    situations. I believe they have as much of the _esprit de corps_ as\r\n    other men. Those who think[4] otherwise form an erroneous estimate\r\n    of human nature; and if they act upon that estimate, will, soon or\r\n    late, become sensible of their delusion.\"\r\n\r\nAt this session, upon the election by the Senate of their temporary\r\npresident, Van Buren received the compliment of four votes. In May,\r\n1826, he participated in Benton's report on the reduction of executive\r\npatronage, a subject important enough, but there crudely treated. The\r\nreport strongly exhibited the jealousy of executive power which had long\r\nbeen characteristic of American political thought. By describing the\r\noffices within the president's appointment, their numbers and salaries,\r\nand the expense of the civil list, a striking picture was drawn--and in\r\nthat way a striking picture can always be drawn--of the power of any\r\ngreat executive. By imagining serious abuses of power, the picture was\r\ndarkened with the dangers of patronage, as it could be darkened to-day.\r\nThe country was urged to look forward to the time when public revenue\r\nwould be doubled, when the number of public officers would be\r\nquadrupled, when the president's nomination would carry any man through\r\nthe Senate, and his recommendation any measure through Congress. Names,\r\nthe report said, were nothing. The first Roman emperor was styled\r\nEmperor of the Republic; and the late French emperor had taken a like\r\ntitle. The American president, it was hinted, might by his enormous\r\npatronage and by subsidies to the press, nominally for official\r\nadvertisements, subject us to a like danger. But the usefulness of such\r\npictures as these of Benton and Van Buren depends upon the practical\r\nlesson taught by the artists. If there were disadvantages and dangers\r\nwhich our ancestors rightly feared, in placing the federal patronage\r\nunder the sole control of the president, so there are disadvantages and\r\ndangers in scattering it by laws into various hands, or in its\r\nsubjection to the traditions of \"senatorial courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nSix bills accompanied the report. Two of them proposed the appointment\r\nof military cadets and midshipmen, one of each from every congressional\r\ndistrict; and this was afterwards done, giving a petty patronage to\r\nnational legislators which public sentiment has but recently begun to\r\ncompel them to use upon ascertained merit rather than in sheer\r\nfavoritism. A third bill proposed that military and naval commissions\r\nshould run \"during good behavior\" and not \"during the pleasure of the\r\npresident.\" A fourth sought with extraordinary unwisdom to correct the\r\nold but ever new abuse of government advertising, by depriving the\r\nresponsible executive of its distribution and by placing it in the hands\r\nof congressmen, perhaps the very worst to hold it. Another required\r\nsenatorial confirmation for postmasters whose emoluments exceeded an\r\namount to be fixed. The remaining bill was very wise, and a natural\r\nsequence of Benton's not untruthful though too highly colored picture.\r\nThe law of 1820, which fixed at four years the terms of many subordinate\r\nofficers, was to be modified so as to limit the terms only for officers\r\nwho had not satisfactorily accounted for public moneys. It has been\r\ncommonly said that this act was a device of Crawford, when secretary of\r\nthe treasury, more easily to use federal patronage for his presidential\r\ncanvass. But there seems to be no sufficient reason to doubt that\r\nBenton's and Van Buren's committee correctly stated the intent of the\r\nauthors of the law to have been no more than that the officer should be\r\ndefinitely compelled by the expiration of his term to render his\r\naccounts and have them completely audited; that it was not intended that\r\nsome other person should succeed an officer not found in fault; and that\r\nthe practice of refusing re-commissions to deserving officers was an\r\nunexpected perversion of the law. The committee simply proposed to\r\naccomplish the true intent of the law. The same bill required the\r\npresident to state his reasons for removals of officers when he\r\nnominated their successors. The proposals in the last two bills were\r\nvery creditable to Benton and Van Buren and their coadjutors. It is\r\ngreatly to be lamented that they were not safely made laws while\r\npatronage was dispensed conscientiously and with sincere public spirit\r\nby the younger Adams, so far as he could control it. The biographer has\r\nmore particularly to lament that during the twelve years of Van Buren's\r\nexecutive influence he seemed daunted by the difficulties of voluntarily\r\nputting in practice the admirable rules which as a senator he would have\r\nimposed by law upon those in executive stations. It was only three\r\nyears after this report, that the great chieftain, whom Benton and Van\r\nBuren helped to the presidency, discredited all its reasoning by\r\nproposing \"a general extension\" of the law whose operation they would\r\nhave thus limited. The committee also proposed by constitutional\r\namendment to forbid the appointment to office of any senator or\r\nrepresentative until the end of the presidential term in which he had\r\nheld his seat. This was also one of the reforms whose necessity seems\r\nplain enough to the reformer, until in office he discovers the\r\nconveniences and perhaps the public uses of the practice he has wished\r\nto abolish.\r\n\r\nIn the short session of 1826-1827, little of any importance was done.\r\nVan Buren refused to vote with Benton to abolish the duty on salt, a\r\nvote doubtless influenced by the apparent interest of New York, which\r\nitself taxed the production of salt to aid the State in its internal\r\nimprovements, and which probably could not maintain the tax if foreign\r\nsalt were admitted free. Van Buren did not, indeed, avow, nor did he\r\ndisavow this reason. He was content to point out that the great canals\r\nof New York were of national use, though their expense was borne by his\r\nState alone. He voted at this session for lower duties on teas, coffees,\r\nand wines. He did not join Benton and others in their narrow\r\nunwillingness to establish a naval academy. Van Buren's temper was\r\neminently free from raw prejudices against disciplined education. The\r\ndeath of one of the envoys to the Panama congress enabled him again at\r\nthis session to renew his opposition by a vote against filling the\r\nvacancy. Another attempt was made to pass a bankruptcy bill; but again\r\nit failed through the natural and wholesome dislike of increasing the\r\npowers of the federal judiciary, and the preference that state courts\r\nand laws should perform all the work to which they were reasonably\r\ncompetent. The bill did not even pass the Senate, until by Van Buren's\r\nopposition it had been reduced to a bill establishing a summary and\r\nspeedy remedy for creditors against fraudulent or failing traders,\r\ninstead of a general system of bankruptcy, voluntary and involuntary,\r\nfor all persons. Van Buren's speech against the insolvency features of\r\nthe bill was made on January 23, 1827, only a few days before his\r\nsuccessor as senator was to be chosen. But the thoughtless popularity\r\nwhich often accompanies sweeping propositions of relief to insolvents\r\ndid not move him from resolute and successful opposition to what he\r\ncalled (and later experience has most abundantly justified him) \"an\r\ninjurious extension of the patronage of the federal government, and an\r\ninsupportable enlargement of the range of its judicial power.\" On\r\nFebruary 24, 1827, a few days after his reëlection, he delivered a lucid\r\nand elaborate speech on the long-perplexing topic of the restrictions\r\nupon American trade with the British colonies, a subject to be\r\nafterwards closely connected with his political fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of the coming presidential election left little of its\r\nturbulence upon the records of the long session from December, 1827, to\r\nMay, 1828. Van Buren was doubtless busy enough out of the senate\r\nchamber. But he was still a very busy legislator. He spoke at least\r\ntwice in favor of the bill to abolish imprisonment under judgments\r\nrendered by federal courts for debts not fraudulently incurred, the bill\r\nwhich Richard M. Johnson had pressed so long and so honorably; and at\r\nlast he saw the bill pass in January, 1828. He spoke often upon the\r\ntechnical bill to regulate federal judicial process. Again he voted, and\r\nagain in a minority and in opposition to Benton and other political\r\nfriends, against bills to extend the Cumberland road and for other\r\ninternal improvements. Besides the usual bills to appropriate lands for\r\nroads and canals, and to subscribe to the stock of private canal\r\ncompanies, a step further was now taken in the constitutional change led\r\nby Adams and Clay. Public land was voted for the benefit of Kenyon\r\nCollege, in the State of Ohio. There was plainly intended to be no limit\r\nto federal beneficence. In this session Van Buren again rushed to defend\r\nthe salt duty so dear to New York.\r\n\r\nAt the same session was passed the \"tariff of abominations,\" a measure\r\nso called from the oppressive provisions loaded on it by its enemies,\r\nbut in spite of which it passed. Van Buren, though he sat still during\r\nthe debate, cast for the bill a protectionist vote, with Benton and\r\nseveral others whose convictions were against it, but who yielded to\r\nthe supposed public sentiment or the peremptory instructions of their\r\nStates, or who did not yet dare to make upon the tariff a presidential\r\nissue. The votes of the senators were sectionally thus distributed: For\r\nthe tariff,--New England, 6; Middle States, 8; Louisiana, 1; and the\r\nWestern States, 11; in all 26. Against it,--New England, 5; Maryland, 2;\r\nSouthern States, 13; and Tennessee, 1. It was a victory of neither\r\npolitical party, but of the Middle and Western over the Southern States.\r\nOnly three negative votes were cast by senators who had voted against\r\nthe administration on the Panama question in 1826; while of the votes\r\nfor the tariff, fourteen were cast by senators who had then opposed the\r\nadministration. Of the senators in favor of the tariff, six, Van Buren,\r\nBenton, Dickerson of New Jersey, Eaton of Tennessee (Jackson's close\r\nfriend), Kane of Illinois, and Rowan of Kentucky, had in 1826 been in\r\nopposition, while ten of those voting against the tariff had then been\r\nwith them.[5] The greater number of the opposition senators were\r\ntherefore against the tariff, though very certainly the votes of Van\r\nBuren, Benton, and Eaton prevented the opposition from taking strong\r\nground or suffering injury on the tariff in the election. Van Buren's\r\nsilence in this debate of 1828 indicated at least a temper now hesitant.\r\nBut he and his colleague, Sanford, according to the theory then popular\r\nthat senators were simply delegated agents of their States, were\r\nconstrained, whatever were their opinions, by a resolution of the\r\nlegislature of New York passed almost unanimously in January, 1828. It\r\nstated a sort of _ultima ratio_ of protection, commanding the senators\r\n\"to make every proper exertion to effect such a revision of the tariff\r\nas will afford a sufficient protection to the growers of wool, hemp, and\r\nflax, and the manufacturers of iron, woolens, and every other article,\r\nso far as the same may be connected with the interest of manufactures,\r\nagriculture, and commerce.\" The senators might perhaps have said to this\r\nthat, if they were to protect not only iron and woolens but also every\r\nother article, they ought not to levy prohibitory duties on some and not\r\non other articles; that if they were equally to protect manufactures,\r\nagriculture, and commerce, they could do no better than to let natural\r\nlaws alone. But the silly instruction said what no intelligent\r\nprotectionist means; his system disappears with an equality of\r\nprivilege; that equality must, he argues, at some point yield to\r\npractical necessities. Van Buren took the resolution, however, in its\r\nintended meaning, and not literally. Hayne concluded his fine struggle\r\nagainst the bill by a solemn protest upon its passage that it was a\r\npartial, unjust, and unconstitutional measure.\r\n\r\nAt this session Van Buren, upon the consideration of a rule giving the\r\nVice-President power to call to order for words spoken in debate, made\r\nperhaps the most elaborate of his purely political speeches. It was a\r\nskillful and not unsuccessful effort to give philosophical significance\r\nto the coming struggle at the polls. He spoke of \"that collision, which\r\nseems to be inseparable from the nature of man, between the rights of\r\nthe few and the many,\" of \"those never-ceasing conflicts between the\r\nadvocates of the enlargement and concentration of power on the one hand,\r\nand its limitation and distribution on the other.\" The one party, he\r\nsaid, had \"grown out of a deep and settled distrust of the people and of\r\nthe States:\" the other, out of \"a jealousy of power justified by all\r\nhuman experience.\" The advocates of \"a strong government,\" having been\r\ndefeated in much that they sought in the federal convention, had since,\r\nhe said, \"been at work to obtain by construction what was not included\r\nor intended to be included in the grant.\" He declared the incorporation\r\nof the United States Bank to be the \"great pioneer of constitutional\r\nencroachments.\" Thence had followed those famous usurpations, the alien\r\nand sedition laws of the older Adams's administration. Then came the\r\ndoctrine that the House of Representatives was bound to make all\r\nappropriations necessary to carry out a treaty made by the President and\r\nSenate; and then \"the bold avowal that it belonged to the President\r\nalone to decide upon the propriety\" of a foreign mission, and that it\r\nwas for the Senate only \"to pass on the fitness of the individuals\r\nselected as ministers.\" He lamented the single lapse of Madison, \"one\r\nof the most, if not the most, accomplished statesman that our country\r\nhas produced,\" in signing the bill to incorporate the new bank. The\r\nyounger Adams, Van Buren declared, had \"gone far beyond the utmost\r\nlatitude of construction\" therefore claimed; and he added a reference,\r\ndecorous enough but neither fair nor gracious, to Adams's own early\r\nentrance in the public service upon a mission unauthorized by Congress.\r\nIt was now demonstrated, he said, that the result of the presidential\r\nchoice of 1825 \"was not only the restoration of the men of 1798, but of\r\nthe principles of that day.\" The spirit of encroachment had, it was\r\ntrue, become more wary; but it was no more honest. The system had then\r\nbeen coercion; now it was seduction. Then unconstitutional powers had\r\nbeen exercised to force submission; now they were assumed to purchase\r\ngolden opinions from the people with their own means. Isolated acts of\r\nthe Federalists had not produced an unyielding exclusion from the\r\nconfidence of a majority of the people, for more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury, of large masses of men distinguished for talent and private\r\nworth. The great and glorious struggle had proceeded from something\r\ndeeper, an opposition to the principle of an extension of the\r\nconstructive powers of the government. Without harsh denunciation, and\r\nby suggestion rather than assertion, the administration of John Quincy\r\nAdams was grouped with the administration of his father. The earlier\r\nadministration had deserved and met the retribution of a Republican\r\nvictory. The later one now deserved and ought soon to meet a like fate.\r\n\r\nThe issue was clearly made. The parties were formed. The result rested\r\nwith the people. On February 6, 1827, Van Buren had been reëlected\r\nsenator by a large majority in both houses of the New York legislature.\r\nIn his brief letter of acceptance he said no more on public questions\r\nthan that it should be his \"constant and zealous endeavor to protect the\r\nremaining rights reserved to the States by the federal Constitution,\"\r\nand \"to restore those of which they have been divested by construction.\"\r\nThis had been the main burden of his political oratory from the\r\ninauguration of Adams. There are many references in books to doubts of\r\nVan Buren's position until 1827; but such doubts are not justified in\r\nthe face of his prompt and perfectly explicit utterances in the session\r\nof 1825-1826, and from that time steadily on.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton's death on February 11, 1828, removed from the politics\r\nof New York one of its most illustrious men, a statesman of the first\r\nrank, able and passionate, and of the noblest aspirations. The\r\nunderstanding reached between him and Van Buren in 1826, for the support\r\nof Jackson, had not produced a complete coalition. In spite of the union\r\non Jackson, the Bucktails nominated and Van Buren loyally supported for\r\ngovernor against Clinton in 1826, William B. Rochester, a warm friend\r\nand supporter of Adams and Clay, and one of the members of the very\r\nPanama mission against which so strenuous a fight had been made. Clinton\r\nwas reëlected by a small majority. In a meeting at Washington after his\r\ndeath, Van Buren declared the triumph of his talents and patriotism to\r\nbe monuments of high and enduring fame. He was glad that, though in\r\ntheir public careers there had been \"collisions of opinions and action\r\nat once extensive, earnest, and enduring,\" they had still been \"wholly\r\nfree from that most venomous and corroding of all poisons, personal\r\nhatred.\" These collisions were now \"turned to nothing and less than\r\nnothing.\" Speaking of his respect for Clinton's name and gratitude for\r\nhis signal services, Van Buren concluded with this striking tribute:\r\n\"For myself, so strong, so sincere, and so engrossing is that feeling,\r\nthat I, who whilst living, never--no, never, envied him anything, now\r\nthat he has fallen, am greatly tempted to envy him his grave with its\r\nhonors.\"\r\n\r\nWith this session of 1827-1828 ended Van Buren's senatorial career and\r\nhis parliamentary leadership. From 1821 to 1828 the Senate was not\r\nindeed at its greatest glory. Webster entered it only in December, 1827.\r\nHayne and Benton with Van Buren are to us its most distinguished\r\nmembers, if Randolph's rather indescribable and useless personality may\r\nbe excepted. But to neither of them has the opinion of later times\r\nassigned a place in the first rank of orators, although Hayne's tariff\r\nspeech in 1824 deserves to be set with the greatest of American\r\npolitical orations. The records and speeches of the Senate in which Van\r\nBuren sat have come to us with fine print and narrow margins; they have\r\nnot contributed to the collected works of great men. But the Senate was\r\nthen an able body. The principles of American politics were never more\r\nclearly stated. When the books are well dusted, and one has broken\r\nthrough the starched formality in which the speakers' phrases were set,\r\nhe finds a copious fund of political instruction. The federal Senate was\r\nmore truly a parliamentary body in those formative days than perhaps at\r\nany other period. Several at least of its members were in doubt as to\r\nthe political course they should follow; they were in doubt where they\r\nshould find their party associations. To them, debates had therefore a\r\nreal and present significance. There were some votes to be affected,\r\nthere were converts to be gained, by speeches even on purely political\r\nquestions; there were some senators whose votes were not inexorably\r\ndetermined for them by the will of their parties or their constituents.\r\nMuch that was said had therefore a genuine parliamentary ring. The\r\norators really sought to convince and persuade those who heard them\r\nwithin the easy and almost conversational limits of the old senate\r\nchamber. There was little of the mere pronouncing of essays or\r\ndeclamations intended to have their real and only effect elsewhere. In\r\nthis art of true parliamentary speaking rather than oratory, Van Buren\r\nwas a master such as Lord Palmerston afterwards became. He was not\r\neloquent. His speeches, so far as they are preserved, interest the\r\nstudent of political history and not of literature. They are sensible,\r\nclear, practical arguments made in rather finished sentences. One does\r\nnot find quotations from them in books of school declamation. But they\r\nserved far more effectively the primary end of parliamentary speaking\r\nthan did the elaborate and powerful disquisitions of Calhoun, or the\r\nmore splendid flood of Webster's eloquence. Van Buren's speeches were\r\nintended to convince, and they did convince some of the men in the seats\r\nabout him. They were meant to persuade, and they did persuade. They were\r\nlucid exhibitions of political principles, generally practical, and\r\ntouched sufficiently but not morbidly with the theoretical fears so\r\ncommon to our earlier politics. Some of those fears have since been\r\nshown to be groundless; but out of many of them has come much that is\r\nbest in the modern temper of American political institutions. Van\r\nBuren's speeches did not rise beyond the reach of popular understanding,\r\nalthough they never warmly touched popular sympathy. They were intended\r\nto formulate and spread a political faith in which he plainly saw that\r\nthere was the material of a party,--a faith founded upon the jealousy of\r\nfederal activity, however beneficent, which sought to avoid state\r\ncontrol or encourage state dependence. The prolixity which was a grave\r\nfault of his state papers and political letters was far less exhibited\r\nin his oratorical efforts. His style was generally easy and vigorous,\r\nwith little of the turgid learning which loaded down many sensible\r\nspeeches of the time. Now and then, however, he resorted to the\r\nsentences of stilted formality which sometimes overtake a good public\r\nspeaker, as a good actor sometimes lapses into the stage strut.\r\n\r\nIn Van Buren's senatorial speeches there is nothing to justify the\r\ncharge of \"non-committalism\" so much made against him. When he spoke at\r\nall he spoke explicitly; and he plainly, though without acerbity,\r\nexhibited his likes and dislikes. Jackson was struck with this when he\r\nsat in the Senate with him. \"I had heard a great deal about Mr. Van\r\nBuren,\" he said, \"especially about his non-committalism. I made up my\r\nmind that I would take an early opportunity to hear him and judge for\r\nmyself. One day an important subject was under debate in the Senate. I\r\nnoticed that Mr. Van Buren was taking notes while one of the senators\r\nwas speaking. I judged from this that he intended to reply, and I\r\ndetermined to be in my seat when he spoke. His turn came; and he rose\r\nand made a clear, straightforward argument, which, to my mind, disposed\r\nof the whole subject. I turned to my colleague, Major Eaton, who sat\r\nnext to me. 'Major,' said I, 'is there anything non-committal about\r\nthat?' 'No, sir,' said the major.\" Van Buren scrupulously observed the\r\namenities of debate. He was uniformly courteous towards adversaries; and\r\nthe calm self-control saved him, as some greater orators were not\r\nsaved, from a descent to the aspersion of motive so common and so futile\r\nin political debate. He could not, indeed, help now and then an allusion\r\nto the venality and monarchical tendency of the Federalists and their\r\nsuccessors; but this was an old formula which strong haters had years\r\nbefore made very popular in the Republican phrase-book, and which, as to\r\nthe venality, meant nobody in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC VICTORY IN 1828.--GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in May, 1828, Van Buren left Washington, the country universally\r\nrecognized him as the chief organizer of the new party and its\r\ncongressional leader. As such he turned all his skill and industry to\r\nwin a victory for Jackson and Calhoun. There was never in the history of\r\nthe United States a more legitimate presidential canvass than that of\r\n1828. The rival candidates distinctly stood for conflicting principles\r\nof federal administration. On the one side, under Van Buren's shrewd\r\nmanagement, with the theoretical coöperation of Calhoun,--the natural\r\nbent of whose mind was now aided and not thwarted by the exigencies of\r\nhis personal career,--was the party inclined to strict limitation of\r\nfederal powers, jealous for local powers, hostile to internal\r\nimprovements by the federal government, inclined to a lower rather than\r\na higher tariff. On the other side was the party strongly national in\r\ntemper, with splendid conceptions of a powerful and multifariously\r\nuseful central administration, impatient of the poverties and meannesses\r\nof many of the States. The latter party was led by a president with\r\nampler training in public life than any American of his time, who\r\nsincerely and intelligently believed the principles of his party; and\r\nhis party held those principles firmly, explicitly, and with practical\r\nunanimity. Jefferson, in almost his last letter, written in December,\r\n1825, to William B. Giles, a venerable leader of the Democracy, the\r\n\"Charles James Fox of Congress,\" Benton's \"statesman of head and\r\ntongue,\" recalled indeed Adams's superiority over all ordinary\r\nconsiderations when the safety of his country had been questioned; but\r\nJefferson declared himself in \"the deepest affliction\" at the\r\nusurpations by which the federal branch, through the decisions of the\r\nfederal court, the doctrines of the President, and the misconstructions\r\nof Congress, was stripping its \"colleagues, the state authorities, of\r\nthe powers reserved to them.\" The voice from Monticello, feeble with its\r\neighty-three years, and secretly uttered though it was, sounded the\r\nsummons to a new Democratic battle.\r\n\r\nVan Buren and his coadjutors, however, led a party as yet of inclination\r\nto principles rather than of principles. It was out of power. There was\r\nneither warmth nor striking exaltation in its programme. Its\r\nphilosophical and political wisdom needed the aid of one of those simple\r\ncries for justice which are so potent in political warfare, and a leader\r\nto interest and fire the popular temper. Both were at hand. The late\r\ndefeat of the popular will by the Adams-Clay coalition was the cry; the\r\nhero of the military victory most grateful to Americans was the leader.\r\nTo this cry and this leader Van Buren skillfully harnessed an\r\nintelligible, and at the least a reasonable, political creed. There were\r\nthus united nearly all the elements of political strength. Not indeed\r\nall, for the record of the leader was weak upon several articles of\r\nfaith. Jackson had voted in the Senate for internal improvement bills,\r\nand among them bills of the most obnoxious character, those authorizing\r\nsubscriptions to the stocks of private corporations. He had voted\r\nagainst reductions of the tariff. But the votes, it was hoped, exhibited\r\nonly his inexpertness in applying general principles to actual\r\nlegislation, or a good-natured willingness to please his constituents by\r\nsingle votes comparatively unimportant. In truth these mistakes were\r\nreally inconsistencies of the politician, and no more. There had been a\r\nlong inclination on Jackson's part to the Jeffersonian policy. Over\r\nthirty years before, he had in Congress been a strict constructionist\r\nand an anti-federalist. In 1801 he had required a candidate desiring his\r\nsupport to be \"an admirer of state authority, agreeable to the true\r\nliteral meaning\" of the Constitution, and \"banishing the dangerous\r\ndoctrine of implication.\" If he were now to have undivided\r\nresponsibility, this old Democratic trend of his would, it was hoped, be\r\nstrong enough under Democratic advice. As a candidate, the\r\ninconsistencies of a soldier politician were far outweighed by his\r\npicturesque and powerful personality. It is commonly thought of Jackson\r\nthat he was a headstrong, passionate, illiterate man, used and pulled\r\nabout by a few intriguers. Nothing could be further from the truth. He\r\nwas himself a politician of a high order. His letters are full of\r\nshrewd, vigorous, and even managing suggestions of partisan\r\nmanoeuvres. Their political utterances show a highly active and\r\ngenerally sensible though not disciplined mind. He had had long and\r\nimportant experience of civil affairs, in the lower house of Congress,\r\nin the federal Senate when he was only thirty years old, in the\r\nconstitutional convention of his State, in its Supreme Court, later\r\nagain in the Senate; he had been for eight years before the country as a\r\ncandidate for its first office, and for many years in public business of\r\nlarge importance. There were two of the most distinguished Americans,\r\nmen of the ripest abilities and amplest experience, and far removed from\r\nrashness, who from 1824 or before had steadily preferred Jackson for the\r\npresidency. These were Edward Livingston of Louisiana and De Witt\r\nClinton of New York. Daniel Webster described his manners as \"more\r\npresidential than those of any of the candidates.\" Jackson was, he\r\nwrote, \"grave, mild, and reserved.\" Unless in Jackson's case there were\r\neffects without adequate causes, it is very certain that, with faults of\r\nmost serious character, he still had the ability, the dignity, and the\r\nwisdom of a ruler of a high rank. He was, as very few men are, born to\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nAfter Crawford's defeat, Van Buren is credited with a skillful\r\nmanagement of the alliance of his forces with those of Jackson. There is\r\nnot yet public, if it exist, any original evidence as to the details of\r\nthis work. Van Buren's enemies were fond of describing it as full of\r\ncunning and trickery, the work of \"the little magician;\" and later and\r\nfairer writers have adopted from these enemies this characterization.\r\nBut all this seems entirely without proof. Nor is the story probable.\r\nThe union of the Crawford and Jackson men was perfectly natural.\r\nCrawford was a physical wreck, out of public life. Numerous as were the\r\nexceptions, his followers and Jackson's included the great majority of\r\nthe strict constructionists; and but a minority of either of the two\r\nbodies held the opposite views. Neither of the two men had, at the last\r\nelection, been defeated by the other. That Van Buren used at Washington\r\nhis unrivaled skill in assuaging animosities and composing differences\r\nthere can be no doubt. After the end of the session in March, 1827,\r\ntogether with Churchill C. Cambreleng, a member of Congress from New\r\nYork and a close political friend of his, he made upon this mission a\r\ntour through Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. They visited\r\nCrawford, and were authorized to declare that he should support Jackson,\r\nbut did not wish to aid Calhoun. At Raleigh Van Buren told the citizens\r\nthat the spirit of encroachment had assumed a new and far more seductive\r\naspect, and could only be resisted by the exercise of uncommon virtues.\r\nPassing through Washington on his way north, he paid a polite visit to\r\nAdams, talking with him placidly about Rufus King, Monroe, and the\r\nPetersburg horse-races. The President, regarding him as \"the great\r\nelectioneering manager for General Jackson,\" promptly noted in his\r\ndiary, when the interview was over, that Van Buren was now acting the\r\npart Burr had performed in 1799 and 1800; and he found \"much resemblance\r\nof character, manners, and even person, between the two men.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 1826 the Van Buren Republicans of New York, and an important\r\npart of the Clintonians with the great governor at their head, had\r\ndetermined to support Jackson. Van Buren is said to have concealed his\r\nattitude until after his reëlection to the Senate in 1827. But this is a\r\ncomplete error, except as to his public choice of a candidate. His\r\nopposition to the Adams-Clay administration, it has already appeared,\r\nhad been outspoken from 1825. The Jackson candidacy was not indeed\r\ndefinitely announced in New York until 1827. The cry for \"Old Hickory\"\r\nthen went up with a sudden unanimity which seemed to the Adams men a bit\r\nof devilish magic, but which was the patient prearrangement of a\r\nskillful politician appreciating his responsibility, and waiting, as the\r\ngreatest of living politicians[6] recently told England a statesman\r\nought to wait, until the time was really ripe, until the popular\r\ninclination was sufficiently formed to justify action by men in\r\nresponsible public station.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the reëlection of John Quincy Adams in 1828 was\r\nsincerely considered by him, and has been often described by others, as\r\nsingularly causeless, unworthy, and even monstrous. But in truth it led\r\nto one of the most necessary, one of the truest, political revolutions\r\nwhich our country has known. Both Adams and Clay were positive and able\r\nmen. They were resolute that the rather tepid democracy of Monroe should\r\nbe succeeded by a highly national, a federally active administration.\r\nPrior to the election of 1824 Clay had been as nearly in opposition as\r\nthe era of good feeling permitted. Early in Monroe's administration he\r\nhad attacked the President's declaration that Congress had no right to\r\nconstruct roads and canals. His criticism, Mr. Schurz tells us in his\r\nbrilliant and impartial account of the time, \"had a strong flavor of\r\nbitterness in it;\" it was in part made up of \"oratorical flings,\" by\r\nwhich Clay unnecessarily sought to attack and humiliate Monroe. Adams's\r\ndiary states Clay's opposition to have been \"violent, systematic,\" his\r\ncourse to have been \"angry, acrimonious.\" Late in 1819 Monroe's friends\r\nhad even consulted over the wisdom of defeating Clay's reëlection to the\r\nspeakership; and still later Clay had, as Mr. Schurz says, fiercely\r\ncastigated the administration for truckling to foreigners. When Clay\r\ncame into power, it would have been unreasonable for him to suppose that\r\nthere must not arise vigorous parliamentary opposition on the part of\r\nthose who consider themselves the true Republican successors of Monroe,\r\nseeking to stop the diversion into strange ways which Clay and Adams had\r\nnow begun. Richard Rush of Pennsylvania, Adams's secretary of the\r\ntreasury, and now the Adams candidate for vice-president, had, in one of\r\nhis annual reports, declared it to be the duty of government \"to augment\r\nthe number and variety of occupations for its inhabitants; to hold out\r\nto every degree of labor, and to every modification of skill, its\r\nappropriate object and inducement; to organize the whole labor of a\r\ncountry; to entice into the widest ranges its mechanical and\r\nintellectual capacities, instead of suffering them to slumber; to call\r\nforth, wherever hidden, latent ingenuity, giving to effort activity and\r\nto emulation ardor; to create employment for the greater amount of\r\nnumbers by adapting it to the diversified faculties, propensities, and\r\nsituations of men, so that every particle of ability, every shade of\r\ngenius, may come into requisition.\" Nor did this glowing picture of a\r\nuseful and beneficent government go far beyond the utterances of Rush's\r\nsenior associate on the presidential ticket. It is certain that it was\r\nhighly agreeable to Clay.\r\n\r\nSurely there could be no clearer political issue presented, on the one\r\nside by Van Buren's speeches in the Senate, and on the other by\r\nauthoritative and solemn declarations of the three chief persons of the\r\nadministration. Whatever the better side of the issue may have been, no\r\nissue was ever a more legitimate subject of a political campaign. It is\r\ntrue that the accusations were unfounded, which were directed against\r\nAdams for treachery to the Republican principles he professed after, on\r\nadhering to Jefferson, he had resigned his seat in the Senate. He had\r\njoined Jefferson on questions of foreign policy and domestic defense,\r\nand had, until his election to the presidency, been chiefly concerned\r\nwith diplomacy. But though the accusations were false, it is true enough\r\nthat Adams himself had made the issue of the campaign. Nor was it\r\ncreditable to him that he saw in the opposition something merely\r\npersonal to himself. If he were wrong upon the issue, as Van Buren and a\r\nmajority of the people thought, his long public service, his utter\r\nintegrity, his exalted sense of the obligations of office, ought not to\r\nhave saved him from the battle or from defeat. How true and deep was\r\nthis political contest of 1828 one sees in the fact that from it, almost\r\nas much as from the triumph of Jefferson, flow the traditions of one of\r\nthe great American parties, traditions which survived the corruptions of\r\nslavery, and are still powerful in party administration.[7] If John\r\nQuincy Adams had been elected, and if, as might naturally have been the\r\ncase, there had followed, at this commencement of railway building, a\r\nfirm establishment of the doctrine that the national government could\r\nproperly build roads within the States, it is more than mere speculation\r\nto say that the later history of the United States would, whether for\r\nthe better or the worse, have been very different from what it has been.\r\nThe dangers to which American institutions would be exposed, if the\r\nfederal government had become a great power levying taxes upon the whole\r\ncountry to be used in constructing railways, or, what was worse,\r\npurchasing stock in railway corporations, and doing this, as it would\r\ninevitably have done, according to the amount of pressure here or\r\nthere,--such dangers, it is easy to understand, seem, whether rightly or\r\nwrongly, appalling to a large class of political thinkers. To realize\r\nthis sense of danger dissipates the aspect of _doctrinaire_ extravagance\r\nin the speeches of Adams's opponents against latitudinarian\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn the canvass of 1828 there was on both sides more wicked and\r\ndespicable exhibition of slander than had been known since Jefferson and\r\nJohn Adams were pitted against each other. Jackson was a military\r\nbutcher and utterly illiterate; the chastity of his wife was doubtful.\r\nAdams had corruptly bargained away offices; his accounts of public\r\nmoneys received by him needed serious scrutiny; and, that the charges\r\nmight be precisely balanced, he had when minister at St. Petersburg\r\nacted as procurer to the Czar of Russia. These lies doubtless defeated\r\nthemselves; but in each election since 1828 there have been politicians\r\nlow enough and silly enough to imitate them. To nothing of this kind did\r\nVan Buren descend. Nor does it seem that even then he used the cry of a\r\ncorrupt bargain between Adams and Clay, in which Jackson believed as\r\nlong as he lived. The coalition of 1825, defeating, as it had, a\r\ncandidate chosen by a larger number of voters than any other, was the\r\nmost used, and probably the most successfully used, of any of the\r\ncampaign issues. Nor was this clearly illegitimate, although Adams and\r\nmany for him have hotly condemned its immorality. Every political\r\ncoalition between men lately in opposition political and personal, by\r\nwhich both get office, is fairly open to criticism. In experience it has\r\nalways been full of political danger, although since the prejudice of\r\nthe times has worn away, the defense of Adams and Clay is seen to be\r\namply sufficient. Whatever had been their mutual dislikes political or\r\npersonal, each of them was politically and in his practical\r\nstatesmanship far nearer to the other than to any other of the\r\ncompetitors. But we have yet to see a political campaign against a\r\ncoalition whose members have been rewarded with office, in which this\r\nform of attack is not made by men very intelligent and most honest. Nor\r\nis there any reason to hold the followers of Jackson to a higher\r\nstandard. In our own time we have seen two coalitions whose parties\r\nwisely recognized this danger. The chief leaders of the Republican\r\nrevolt in 1884 neither sought nor took office from the former\r\nadversaries with whom for once they then acted. The Dissenting Liberals\r\nin England did not take office in the Conservative ministry formed in\r\n1886; and the odium which, in the change later made in it, followed Mr.\r\nGoschen into its second place, illustrated very well the truth that,\r\nhowever honorable the course may be, it is inevitably dangerous.[8]\r\n\r\nNor can moral condemnation be passed upon the use in 1828 of the defeat\r\nin 1824, of the candidate having the largest popular vote. We see pretty\r\nclearly in a constitutionally governed country that when power is\r\nlawfully lodged with a public man, he must act upon his own judgment;\r\nand that, if he be influenced by others, then he ought to be influenced\r\nby the wishes and interests of those who supported him, and not of\r\nthose who opposed him, even though far more numerous than his\r\nsupporters. Repeatedly have we seen a state legislature, which the\r\narrangement of districts has caused to be elected from a party in\r\nminority in the whole State, choose a federal senator who it was known\r\nwould have been defeated upon a popular vote; and this without criticism\r\nof the conduct of the legislators, but only of the defective district\r\ndivision. In Connecticut it has happened more than once that, neither\r\ncandidate for governor having a majority vote, the legislature has\r\nchosen a candidate having one of the smaller minorities; and here again\r\nwithout criticism of the legislature's morality. But still the general\r\nrule of American elections is, that the candidate shall be chosen who is\r\npreferred by more votes than any other. To assent to a constitutional\r\ndefeat of such a preference, but afterwards and under the law to make\r\nstrong appeal to right the wrong which the law has wrought, seems a\r\nhighly defensible course, and to deserve little of the criticism visited\r\nupon the Jackson canvass of 1828. If party divisions be justifiable, if\r\nchief public officers are to be chosen for their views on great\r\nquestions of state, if the cold appeals of political reasoning are ever\r\nrightly strengthened by appeals to popular feelings, the campaign which\r\nVan Buren and his associates began in 1825 or 1826 was perfectly\r\njustifiable. Nor in its result can any one deny, whether it were for\r\nbetter or worse, that their success in the battle worked a change in the\r\nprinciples of administration, and not a mere vulgar driving from office\r\nof one body of men that another might take their places.\r\n\r\nThe death of De Witt Clinton left Van Buren easily the largest figure in\r\npublic life, as he had for several years been the most powerful\r\npolitician, in New York State. The gossip that the most important place\r\nin Jackson's cabinet was really allotted to him before the election of\r\n1828 is probably true. But, whether true or not, there was, apart from a\r\nnatural desire to administer the first office in his State, obvious\r\nadvantage to his political prestige in passing successfully through a\r\npopular election. The most cynical of managing politicians recognize the\r\nenormous strength of a man for whom the people have actually shown that\r\nthey like to vote. Van Buren may have counted besides upon the advantage\r\nwhich Jackson's personal popularity brought to those in his open\r\nalliance, although Adams was known still to have, as the election showed\r\nhe had, considerable Democratic strength. Van Buren took therefore the\r\nBucktail nomination for governor of New York. The National Republicans,\r\nas the Adams men were called, nominated Smith Thompson, a judge of the\r\nfederal Supreme Court. Van Buren got 136,794 and Thompson 106,444 votes.\r\nBut in spite of so large a plurality Van Buren did not quite have a\r\nmajority of the popular vote. Solomon Southwick, the anti-Masonic\r\ncandidate, received 33,345 votes. It was the first election after this\r\nextraordinary movement. The abduction of Morgan and his probable murder\r\nto prevent his revelation of Masonic secrets had occurred in the fall of\r\n1826. The criminal trials consequent upon it had caused intense\r\nexcitement; and a political issue was easily made, for many\r\ndistinguished men of both parties were members of that secret order. How\r\npowerful for a time may be a popular cry, though based upon an utterly\r\nabsurd issue, became more obvious still later when electoral votes for\r\npresident were cast for William Wirt, the anti-Masonic candidate; and\r\nwhen John Quincy Adams, after graduating from the widest experience in\r\npublic affairs of any American of his generation, was, as he himself\r\nrecords, willing to accept, and when William H. Seward was willing to\r\ntender him, a presidential nomination of the anti-Masonic party. As\r\nSouthwick's preposterous vote was in 1828 drawn from both parties, Van\r\nBuren's prestige, although he had but a plurality vote, was increased by\r\nhis victory at the polls. Jackson very truly said in February, 1832,\r\nthat it was now \"the general wish and expectation of the Republican\r\nparty throughout the Union\" that Van Buren should take the place next to\r\nthe President in the national administration. Jackson was himself\r\nelected by a very great popular and electoral majority. In New York,\r\nwhere on this single occasion the electors were chosen in districts, and\r\nwhere the anti-Masonic vote was cast against Jackson who held high rank\r\nin the Masonic order, Adams secured 16 votes to Jackson's 18; but to\r\nthe latter were added the two electors chosen by the thirty-four\r\ndistrict electors.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's career as governor was very brief. He was inaugurated on\r\nJanuary 1, 1829, and at once resigned his seat in the federal Senate. On\r\nMarch 12th of the same year he resigned the governor's seat. His\r\ninaugural message is said by Hammond, the political historian of New\r\nYork, by no means too friendly to Van Buren, to have been \"the best\r\nexecutive message ever communicated to the legislature;\" and after\r\nnearly sixty years, it seems, in the leather-covered tome containing it,\r\na remarkably clear, wise, and courageous paper. The excitement over\r\ninternal improvements in communication was then at its height. He\r\ndeclared that, whatever difference there might be as to whether such\r\nimprovements ought to be undertaken by the federal government or by the\r\nStates, none seriously doubted that it was wise to apply portions of the\r\nmeans of New York to such improvements. The investment of the State in\r\nthe Delaware and Hudson canal, then just completed, had, he thought,\r\nbeen \"crowned with the most cheering success.\" Splendid, too, as had\r\nbeen the success of the Erie and Champlain canals, it was still clear\r\nthat all had not been equally benefited. The friends of the state road\r\nand of the Chemung and Chenango canals had urged him to recommend for\r\nthem a legislative support. But it was a time, he said, for \"the utmost\r\nprudence and circumspection\" upon that \"delicate and vitally interesting\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nThe banking question, he told the legislature, would make the important\r\nbusiness of its session. It turned out besides to be one of the\r\nimportant businesses of Van Buren's career. To meet the attacks upon him\r\nfor having once been interested in a bank, he dexterously recited that,\r\n\"having for many years ceased to have an interest in those institutions\r\nand declined any agency in their management,\" he was conscious of his\r\nimperfect information. But he could not ignore a matter of such\r\nmagnitude to their constituents. The whole bank agitation at this time\r\nshowed the difficulties and scandals caused by the absence of a free\r\nbanking system, and by the long accustomed grants of exclusive banking\r\ncharters. Of the forty banks in the State, all specially incorporated,\r\nthe charters of thirty-one would expire within one, two, three, or four\r\nyears. Their actual capital was $15,000,000; their outstanding loans,\r\nmore than $30,000,000. Van Buren urged, therefore, the legislature now\r\nto make by general law final disposition of the whole subject. The\r\nabolition of banks had, he said, no advocate, and a dependence solely\r\nupon those established by federal authority deserved none; but he\r\nrejected the idea of a state bank. \"Experience,\" he declared, \"has shown\r\nthat banking operations, to be successful, and consequently beneficial\r\nto the community, must be conducted by private men upon their own\r\naccount.\" He condemned the practice by which the State accepted a money\r\nbonus for granting a bank charter, necessarily involving some monopoly.\r\nThe concern of the State, he pointed out, should be to make its banks\r\nand their circulation secure; and such security was impaired, not\r\nincreased, by encouraging banks in competition with one another, and\r\n\"stimulated by the golden harvest in view,\" to make large payments for\r\ntheir charters. He submitted for legislative consideration the idea of\r\nthe \"safety fund\" communicated to him in an interesting and intelligent\r\npaper by Joshua Forman. Under this system all the banks of the State,\r\nwhatever their condition, were to contribute to a fund to be\r\nadministered under state supervision, the fund to be a security for all\r\ndishonored bank-notes. To this extent all the banks were to insure or\r\nindorse the circulation of each bank, thus saving the scandal and loss\r\narising from the occasional failure of banks to redeem their notes, and\r\nmaking every bank watchful of all its associates. In compelling the\r\nbanks to submit to some general scheme, the representative of the people\r\nwould indeed, he said, enter into \"conflict with the claims of the great\r\nmoneyed interest of the country; but what political exhibition so truly\r\ngratifying as the return to his constituents of the faithful public\r\nservant after having turned away every approach and put far from him\r\nevery sinister consideration!\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren proposed a separation of state from national elections; a\r\nquestion still discussed, and upon each side of which much is to be\r\nsaid. He attacked the use of money in elections, \"the practice of\r\nemploying persons to attend the polls for compensation, of placing large\r\nsums in the hands of others to entertain the electors,\" and other\r\ndevices by which the most valuable of all our temporal privileges \"was\r\nbrought into disrepute.\" If the expenses of elections should increase as\r\nthey had lately done, the time would soon arrive \"when a man in middling\r\ncircumstances, however virtuous, will not be able to compete upon\r\nanything like equal terms with a wealthy opponent.\" In long advance of a\r\nmodern agitation for reform which, lately beginning with us, will, it is\r\nto be hoped, not cease until the abuses are removed, he proposed a law\r\nimposing \"severe and enforcible penalties upon the advance of money by\r\nindividuals for any purposes connected with the election except the\r\nsingle one of printing.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to the field of general politics, he again declared the\r\npolitical faith to whose support he wished to rally his party. That \"a\r\njealousy of the exercise of delegated political power, a solicitude to\r\nkeep public agents within the precise limits of their authority, and an\r\nassiduous adherence to a rigid and scrupulous economy, were indications\r\nof a contracted spirit unbecoming the character of a statesman,\" he\r\npronounced to be a political heresy, from which he himself had not been\r\nentirely free, but which ought at once to be exploded. Official\r\ndiscretion, as a general rule, could not be confided to any one without\r\ndanger of abuse. But he reproved the parsimony which disagreeably\r\ncharacterized the democracy of the time, and which inadequately paid\r\ngreat public servants like the chancellor and judges. In the tendency of\r\nthe federal government to encroach upon the States lay, he thought, the\r\ndanger of the federal Constitution. But of the disposition and capacity\r\nof the American people to resist such encroachments as our political\r\nhistory recorded, there were, he said, without naming either Adams, \"two\r\nprominent and illustrious instances.\" As long as that good spirit was\r\npreserved, the republic would be safe; and for that preservation every\r\npatriot ought to pray.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the country had in some degree suffered, he said, from\r\n\"the uncharitable and unrelenting scrutiny to which private as well as\r\npublic character\" had been subjected in the late election. But this\r\ninjury had been \"relieved, if not removed, by seeing how soon the\r\noverflowing waters of bitterness\" had spent themselves, and \"that\r\nalready the current of public feeling had resumed its accustomed\r\nchannels.\" These excesses were the price paid for the full enjoyment of\r\nthe right of opinion. With an assertion of \"perfect deference to that\r\nsacred privilege, and in the humble exercise of that portion of it\"\r\nwhich belonged to him, and of a sincere desire not to offend the\r\nfeelings of those who differed from him, he ended his message by\r\ncongratulating the legislature upon the election of Jackson and Calhoun.\r\nThis result, he said in words not altogether insincere or untrue, but\r\nfull of the unfairness of partisan dispute, infused fresh vigor into the\r\nAmerican political system, refuted the odious imputation that republics\r\nare ungrateful, dissipated the vain hope that our citizens could be\r\ninfluenced by aught save appeals to their understanding and love of\r\ncountry, and finally exhibited in \"bold relief the omnipotence of public\r\nopinion, and the futility of all attempts to overawe it by the\r\ndenunciation of power, or to reduce it by the allurements of patronage.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Hoyt letters, afterwards published by Van Buren's rancorous\r\nenemy, Mackenzie, are two letters of his upon his patronage as governor.\r\nIt is not unfair to suppose that he wrote many other letters like them,\r\nand they give a useful glimpse of the distribution of offices at Albany\r\nsixty years ago. These letters to Hoyt were of the most confidential\r\ncharacter, and showed a strong but not uncontrolled desire to please\r\nparty friends and to meet party expectations. But in none of them is\r\nthere a suggestion of anything dishonorable. He asked, \"When will the\r\nRepublican party be made sensible of the indispensable necessity of\r\nnominating none but true and tried men, so that when they succeed they\r\ngain something?\" He was unable to oblige his \"good friend Coddington ...\r\nin relation to the health appointments.\" Dr. Westervelt's claims were\r\n\"decidedly the strongest; and much was due to the relations in which he\r\nstood to Governor Tompkins, especially from one who knew so well what\r\nthe latter has done and suffered for this State.\" He wrote of Marcy,\r\nwhom he appointed a judge of the supreme court, that he \"was so situated\r\nthat I must make him a judge or ruin him.\" All this is doubtless not\r\nunlike what the best of public officers have sometimes said and thought,\r\nthough rarely written; and, like most talk over patronage, it is not in\r\nvery exalted tone. But if Van Buren admitted as one of Westervelt's\r\nclaims to public office that he was of a Whig family and a Democrat\r\n\"from his cradle,\" he found among his other claims that he was \"a\r\ngentleman and a man of talent,\" and had been \"three years in the\r\nhospital and five years deputy health officer, until he was cruelly\r\nremoved.\" Dr. Manley he refused to remove from the health office,\r\nbecause \"his extraordinary capacity is universally admitted;\" and\r\npointed out that the removal \"could only be placed on political grounds,\r\nand as he was a zealous Jackson man at the last election, that could not\r\nhave been done without danger.\" \"I should not,\" he said, however, \"have\r\ngiven Manley the office originally, if I could have found a competent\r\nRepublican to take it.\" William L. Marcy, whom he made judge, was\r\nalready known as one of the ablest men in the State, and his appointment\r\nwas admirable, though his salvation from ruin, if Van Buren was speaking\r\nseriously, was not a public end fit to be served by high judicial\r\nappointment. John C. Spencer, one of the best lawyers of New York, was\r\nappointed by Van Buren special counsel for the prosecution of Morgan's\r\nmurderers. Hammond wondered \"how so rigid a party man as Mr. Van Buren\r\nwas, came to appoint a political opponent to so important an office,\"\r\nbut concluded that it was a fine specimen of his peculiar tact, because\r\nSpencer, though a man of talents and great moral courage, might be\r\ndefeated in the prosecution, and thus be injured with the anti-Masons;\r\nwhile if he succeeded, his vigor and fidelity would draw upon him\r\nMasonic hostility. But the simpler explanation is the more probable. Van\r\nBuren desired to adhere in this, as he did in most of his appointments,\r\nto a high standard. Upon this particular appointment his own motives\r\nmight be distrusted; and he therefore went to the ranks of his\r\nadversaries for one of their most distinguished and invulnerable\r\nleaders. Van Buren was long condemned as a \"spoils\" politician; but he\r\nwas not accused of appointing either incompetent or dishonest men to\r\noffice. In the great place of governor he must have already begun to see\r\nhow difficult and dangerous was this power of patronage. It must be\r\nfairly admitted that he pretty carefully limited, by the integrity and\r\nefficiency of the public service, the political use which he made of his\r\nappointments,--a use made in varying degrees by every American holding\r\nimportant executive power from the first Adams to our own time.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1829, Governor Van Buren resigned his office with the\r\nhearty and unanimous approval of his party friends, whom he gathered\r\ntogether on receiving Jackson's invitation to Washington. He was in\r\ntheir hands, he said, and should abide by their decision. Both houses of\r\nthe legislature passed congratulatory and even affectionate resolutions;\r\nand his brief and brilliant career in the executive chamber of the State\r\nended happily, as does any career which ends that a seemingly greater\r\none may begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF STATE.--DEFINITE FORMATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC CREED\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Buren was appointed secretary of state on March 5, 1829; but did not\r\nreach Washington until the 22d, and did not act as secretary until April\r\n4. James A. Hamilton, a son of Alexander Hamilton, but then an\r\ninfluential Jackson man, was acting secretary in the meantime. The two\r\nyears of Van Buren's administration of this office are perhaps the most\r\npicturesque years of American political history. The Eaton scandal; the\r\ndownfall of Calhoun's political power; the magical success of Van Buren;\r\nthe \"kitchen cabinet;\" the odious removals from office, and the outcries\r\nof the removed; the fiery passion of Jackson; the horror both real and\r\naffected of the opposition,--all these have been an inexhaustible quarry\r\nto historical writers. Until very recently the larger use has been made\r\nof the material derived from hostile sources; and it has seemed easy to\r\npaint pictures of this really important time in the crudest and highest\r\ncolors of dislike. The American democracy, at last let loose, driven by\r\nJackson with a sort of demoniac energy and cunningly used by Van Buren\r\nfor his own selfish and even Mephistophelian ends, is supposed to have\r\nbroken from every sound and conservative principle. Perhaps for no other\r\nperiod in our history has irresponsible and unverified campaign\r\nliterature of the time so largely become authority to serious writers;\r\nand for no other period does truth more strongly require a judgment upon\r\nwell established results rather than upon partisan rumor and gossip.\r\nDuring these years there was definitely and practically formed, under\r\nthe auspices of Jackson's administration, a political creed, a body of\r\nprinciples or tendencies in politics which have ever since strongly held\r\nthe American people. Some of them have become established by a universal\r\nacquiescence. During the same years there began an extension into\r\nfederal politics of the \"spoils system,\" which has been an evil second\r\nonly to slavery, and from which we are only now recovering. To Van Buren\r\nmore than to any man of his time must be awarded the credit of forming\r\nthe creed of the Jacksonian Democracy. And in the shame of the abuse,\r\nwhich has so greatly tended to neutralize the soundest articles of\r\npolitical faith, Van Buren must participate with other and inferior men\r\nof his own time, and with the very greatest of the men who followed him.\r\nIn this narrative it is impossible to ignore some of the petty and\r\nundignified details which characterized the time,--details from part of\r\nthe discredit of which Van Buren cannot escape. But it would lead to\r\ngross error to let such details obscure the vital and lasting political\r\nwork of the highest order in which Van Buren was a central and\r\ncontrolling power.\r\n\r\nBesides Van Buren, Jackson's cabinet included Ingham of Pennsylvania in\r\nthe Treasury, Eaton in the War Department, Branch in the Navy, Berrien\r\nof Georgia attorney-general, and Barry of Kentucky in the Post-Office,\r\nsucceeding McLean, who after a short service was appointed to the\r\nSupreme Court. Eaton, Branch, and Berrien had been federal senators, the\r\nfirst chiefly commended by Jackson's strong personal liking for him.\r\nIngham, Branch, and Berrien represented, or were supposed to represent,\r\nthe Calhoun influence. Van Buren in ability and reputation easily stood\r\nhead and shoulders above his associates. When he left Albany for\r\nWashington he was believed to have done more than any one else to secure\r\nthe Republican triumph; and if Webster's recollections twenty years\r\nlater were correct, he did more to prevent \"Mr. Adams's reëlection in\r\n1828, and to obtain General Jackson's election, than any other man--yes,\r\nthan any ten other men--in the country.\" He was the first politician in\r\nthe party; Calhoun and he were its most distinguished statesmen. Already\r\nthe succession after Jackson belonged to one of them, the only doubt\r\nbeing to which; and in that doubt was stored up a long and complicated\r\nfeud. The rivalry between these two great men was inevitable; it was not\r\ndishonorable to either. Calhoun's fame was the older; he was already one\r\nof the junior candidates for the presidency, popular in Pennsylvania\r\nand even in New England, when Van Buren was hardly known out of New\r\nYork. In 1829 he had been chosen vice-president for the second time. He\r\nhad shown talents of a very high order. But he had now suffered some\r\nyears from the presidential fever which distorts the vision, and which,\r\nwhen popularity wanes, becomes heavy with enervating melancholy. He was\r\nan able doctrinaire, but narrow and dogmatic. The jealous and ravenous\r\ntemper of the rich slaveholders of South Carolina already possessed him.\r\nHe was a Southern man; and all the presidents thus far, except the elder\r\nand younger Adams, had been Southerners. In 1824 he had stood\r\nindifferent between Jackson and Adams, and in Jackson's final triumph\r\nhad borne no decisive part. Van Buren's wider, richer, and more\r\nconstructive mind, his superior political judgment, his mellower\r\npersonality, his practical skill in affairs, sufficiently explain his\r\nvictory over Calhoun, without resort to the bitter rumors of tricks and\r\nmagical manoeuvres spread by Calhoun's and Clay's friends, and which,\r\nthough without authentic corroboration, have to our own day been widely\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nBefore Jackson's inauguration, Calhoun sought to prevent Van Buren's\r\nselection for the State Department. He told the general that Tazewell of\r\nVirginia ought to be appointed. New York, he said, would have been\r\nsecured by Clinton if he had lived; but now New York needed no\r\nappointment. Jackson listened coldly to the plainly jealous appeal; and\r\nJames A. Hamilton, who was at the time on intimate terms with Jackson,\r\nsupposed it to be Calhoun's last interview with Jackson about the\r\ncabinet. Van Buren had been Jackson's choice a year ago; and to all the\r\nreasons which had then existed were now added his great services in the\r\ncanvass, and the prestige of his popular election as governor.\r\n\r\nThe episode of Mrs. Eaton, the wife of the new secretary of war, was\r\nabsurd enough in a constitutionally governed country; but this silly\r\n\"court scandal,\" which might very well have enlivened the pages of a\r\nsecretary of a privy council or an ambassador from a petty German\r\nprince, did no more than hasten the inevitable division. In the\r\nhastening, however, Van Buren doubtless reaped some profit in Jackson's\r\ngreater friendship. Many respectable people in Washington believed that\r\nunchastity on the part of this lady had induced her former husband,\r\nTimberlake, to cut his throat. Her second marriage to Eaton had just\r\ntaken place in January, 1829, after Jackson, learning of the scandal but\r\ndisbelieving it, had said to Eaton, \"Your marrying her will disprove\r\nthese charges, and restore Peg's good name.\" The general treated with\r\nviolent contempt the persons, some of them clergymen, \"whose morbid\r\nappetite,\" he wrote the Rev. Dr. Ely on March 23, 1829, \"delights in\r\ndefamation and slander.\" Burning with anger at those who had dared in\r\nthe recent canvass to malign his own wife now dead, he defended with\r\nchivalrous resolution the lady whom his own wife \"to the last moment of\r\nher life believed ... to be an innocent and much-injured woman.\" Even\r\nMrs. Madison, he said, \"was assailed by these fiends in human shape.\"\r\nWhen protests were made against Eaton's appointment to the cabinet,\r\nJackson savagely cried, \"I will sink or swim with him, by God!\" All this\r\nhad happened before Van Buren reached Washington. There then followed\r\nthe grave question, whether Mrs. Eaton should be adjudged guilty by\r\nsociety and sentenced to exclusion from its ceremonious enjoyments. The\r\nladies generally were determined against her, even the ladies of\r\nJackson's own household. Jackson proposed the task, impossible even to\r\nan emperor, of compelling recognition of this distressed and persecuted\r\nconsort of a minister of state. The unfortunate married men in the\r\ncabinet were in embarrassment indeed. They would not if they could, so\r\nthey said,--or at least they could not if they would,--induce their\r\nwives to visit or receive visits from the wife of their colleague.\r\nJackson showed them very clearly that no other course would satisfy him.\r\nCalhoun in his matrimonial state was at the same disadvantage. Even\r\nforeign ministers and their wives met the President's displeasure for\r\nnot properly treating the wife of the American secretary of war.\r\n\r\nWhen Van Buren entered this farcical scene, his widowed condition, and\r\nthe fortune of having sons rather than daughters, left him quite\r\nunembarrassed. He politely called upon his associate's wife, as he\r\ncalled upon the others; he treated her with entire deference of manner.\r\nIt is probable, though by no means clear, for popular feeling was\r\nsupposed to run high in sacred defense of the American home, that this\r\nwas the more politic course. It is now, however, certain that by doing\r\nso he gave to Jackson, and some who were personally very close to\r\nJackson, more gratification than he gave offense elsewhere; and this has\r\nbeen the occasion of much aspersion of Van Buren's motives. But whether\r\nhis course were politic or not, it is easy enough to see that any other\r\ncourse would have been inexcusable. It would have been dastardly in the\r\nextreme for Van Buren, reaching Washington and finding a controversy\r\nraging whether or not the wife of one of his associates were virtuous,\r\nto pronounce her guilty, as he most unmistakably would have done had he\r\nrefused her the attention which etiquette required him to pay all ladies\r\nin her position. Parton in his Life of Jackson quotes from an anonymous\r\nWashington correspondent, whose account he says was \"exaggerated and\r\nprejudiced but not wholly incorrect,\" the story that Van Buren induced\r\nthe British and Russian ministers, both of whom to their immediate peace\r\nof mind happened to be bachelors, to treat Mrs. Eaton with distinction\r\nat their entertainments. But the supposition seems quite gratuitous.\r\nNeither of those unmarried diplomats was likely to do so absurdly\r\nindefensible a thing as to insult by marked exclusion a cabinet\r\nminister's wife, whom the President for any reason, good or bad, treated\r\nwith special distinction and respect. Van Buren's common sense was a\r\nstrong characteristic; and he doubtless looked upon the whole affair\r\nwith amused contempt. As the cabinet officer who had most to do with\r\nsocial ceremonies, he may well have sought to calm the irritation and\r\nestablish for Mrs. Eaton, where he could, the usual forms of civility.\r\nLike many other blessings of etiquette, these forms permit one to hold\r\nunoffending neutrality upon the moral deserts of persons whom he meets.\r\nIt happened that Calhoun's friends had tried to prevent Eaton's\r\nappointment to the War Department, and afterwards sought to remove him\r\nfrom the cabinet. The episode added, therefore, keen edge to the growing\r\nhostility of Jackson and his near friends to Calhoun, and thus tended to\r\nstrengthen his rival. But all this would have signified little but for\r\nsomething deeper and broader. The preference of Van Buren had been\r\ndictated by powerful causes long before Mrs. Timberlake became Mrs.\r\nEaton. These causes now grew more and more powerful.\r\n\r\nCalhoun was serving his second term as Vice-President. A third term for\r\nthat office was obnoxious to the rule already established for the\r\npresidency. Calhoun therefore desired Jackson to be content with one\r\nterm; for if he took a second, Calhoun feared, and with good reason,\r\nthat he himself, being then out of the vice-presidency, and so no longer\r\nin sight on that conspicuous seat of preparation, might fall\r\ndangerously out of mind. So it was soon known that Calhoun's friends\r\nwere opposed to a second term for Jackson. At a Pennsylvania meeting on\r\nMarch 31, 1830, the opposition was openly made. Before this, and quite\r\napart from Jackson's natural hostility to the nullification theory which\r\nhad arisen in Calhoun's State, he had conceived a strong dislike for\r\nCalhoun for a personal reason. With this Van Buren had nothing whatever\r\nto do, so far as appears from any evidence better than the\r\nuncorroborated rumors which ascribe to Van Buren's magic every incident\r\nwhich injured Calhoun's standing with Jackson. Years before, Monroe's\r\ncabinet had discussed the treatment due Jackson for his extreme measures\r\nin the Seminole war. Calhoun, then secretary of war, had favored a\r\nmilitary trial of the victorious general; but John Quincy Adams and\r\nMonroe had defended him, as did also Crawford, the secretary of the\r\ntreasury. For a long while Jackson had erroneously supposed that Calhoun\r\nwas the only member of the cabinet in his favor; and Calhoun had not\r\nundeceived him. Some time before Jackson's election, Hamilton had\r\nvisited Crawford to promote the desired reconciliation between him and\r\nthe general; and a letter was written by Governor Forsyth of Georgia to\r\nHamilton, quoting Crawford's explanation of the real transactions in\r\nMonroe's cabinet. Jackson was ignorant of all this until a dinner given\r\nby him in honor of Monroe in November, 1829. Ringold, a personal friend\r\nof Monroe's, in a complimentary speech at seeing Jackson and Monroe\r\nseated together, said to William B. Lewis that Monroe had been \"the only\r\none of his cabinet\" friendly to Jackson in the Seminole controversy; and\r\nafter dinner the remark, after being discussed between Lewis and Eaton\r\nthe secretary of war, was repeated by the latter to Jackson, who said he\r\nmust be mistaken. Lewis then told Jackson of Forsyth's letter, which\r\ngreatly excited him, already disliking Calhoun as he did, and not\r\nunnaturally susceptible about his reputation in a war which had been the\r\nsubject of violent and even savage attacks upon him in the recent\r\ncanvass. Jackson sent at once to New York for the letter. But Hamilton\r\nwas unwilling to give it without Forsyth's permission; and when Forsyth,\r\non the assembling of Congress, was consulted, he preferred that Crawford\r\nshould be directly asked for the information. This was done, and\r\nCrawford wrote an account which in May, 1830, Jackson sent to Calhoun\r\nwith a demand for an explanation. Calhoun admitted that he had, after\r\nhearing of the seizure of the Spanish forts in Florida and Jackson's\r\nexecution of the Englishmen Arbuthnot and Ambrister, expressed an\r\nopinion against him, and proposed an investigation of his conduct by a\r\ncourt of inquiry. He further told Jackson, with much dignity of manner,\r\nthat the latter was being used in a plot to effect Calhoun's political\r\nextinction and the exaltation of his enemies. The President received\r\nCalhoun's letter on his way to church, and upon his return from\r\nreligious meditation wrote to the Vice-President that \"motives are to be\r\ninferred from actions and judged by our God;\" that he had long repelled\r\nthe insinuations that it was Calhoun, and not Crawford, who had secretly\r\nendeavored to destroy his reputation; that he had never expected to say\r\nto Calhoun, \"_Et tu, Brute!_\" and that there need be no further\r\ncommunication on the subject. Thus was finally established the breach\r\nbetween Calhoun and Jackson, which this personal matter had widened but\r\nhad by no means begun. In none of it did Van Buren have any part. When\r\nJackson sent Lewis to him with Calhoun's letter and asked his opinion,\r\nhe refused to read it, saying that an attempt would undoubtedly be made\r\nto hold him responsible for the rupture, and he wished to be able to say\r\nthat he knew nothing of it. This course was doubtless politic, and\r\ndeserves no applause; but it was also simply right. On getting this\r\nmessage Jackson said, \"I reckon Van is right; I dare say they will\r\nattempt to throw the whole blame on him.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks before, on April 13, 1830, the dinner to celebrate\r\nJefferson's birthday was held at Washington. It was attended by the\r\nPresident and Vice-President, the cabinet officers, and many other\r\ndistinguished persons. There were reports at the time that it was\r\nintended to use Jefferson's name in support of the state-rights\r\ndoctrines, and against internal improvements and a protective tariff.\r\nThis shows how clearly were already recognized some of the great causes\r\nunderlying the political movements and personal differences of the time.\r\nThe splendid parliamentary encounter between Hayne and Webster had taken\r\nplace but two or three months before. In his speech Hayne, who was\r\nunderstood, as Benton tells us, to give voice to the sentiments of\r\nCalhoun, had plainly enough stated the doctrine of nullification.\r\nJackson at the dinner robustly confronted the extremists with his famous\r\ntoast, \"Our federal Union: it must be preserved.\" Calhoun, already\r\nconscious of his leadership in a sectional controversy, followed with\r\nthe sentiment, true indeed, but said in words very sinister at that\r\ntime: \"The Union: next to our liberty the most dear. May we all remember\r\nthat it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the States,\r\nand distributing equally the benefit and burden of the Union.\" The\r\nsecretary of state next rose with a toast with little ring or\r\ninspiration in it, but plainly, though in conciliatory phrase, declaring\r\nfor the Union. He asked the company to drink, \"Mutual forbearance and\r\nreciprocal concessions: through their agency the Union was established.\r\nThe patriotic spirit from which they emanated will forever sustain it.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren was now definitely a candidate for the succession. His\r\nNorthern birth and residence, his able leadership in Congress of the\r\nopposition to the Adams administration, his almost supreme political\r\npower in the first State of the Union, his clear and systematic\r\nexposition of an intelligible and timely political creed, the support\r\nhis friends gave to Jackson's reëlection,--all these advantages were now\r\nreënforced by the tendency to disunion clear in the utterances from\r\nSouth Carolina, by Calhoun's efforts to exclude Van Buren and Eaton from\r\nthe cabinet, by the hostility to Mrs. Eaton of the ladies in the\r\nhouseholds of Calhoun and of his friends in the cabinet, and now by\r\nJackson's discovery that, at a critical moment of his career ten years\r\nbefore, Calhoun had sought his destruction. Here was a singular union of\r\nreally sound reasons why Van Buren should be preferred by his party and\r\nby the country for the succession over Calhoun, with the strongest\r\nreasons why Jackson, and those close to him, should be in most eager\r\npersonal sympathy with the preference. In December, 1829, Jackson had\r\nexplicitly pronounced in favor of Van Buren. This was in the letter to\r\nJudge Overton of Tennessee, which Lewis is doubtless correct in saying\r\nhe asked Jackson to write lest the latter should die before his\r\nsuccessor was chosen. Jackson himself drafted the letter, which Lewis\r\ncopied with some verbal alteration; and the letter sincerely expressed\r\nhis own strong opinions. After alluding to the harmony between Van Buren\r\nand his associates in the War and Post-Office Departments, he said: \"I\r\nhave found him everything that I could desire him to be, and believe him\r\nnot only deserving my confidence, but the confidence of the nation.\r\nInstead of his being selfish and intriguing, as has been represented by\r\nsome of his opponents, I have ever found him frank, open, candid, and\r\nmanly. As a counselor, he is able and prudent, republican in his\r\nprinciples, and one of the most pleasant men to do business with I ever\r\nknew. He, my dear friend, is well qualified to fill the highest office\r\nin the gift of the people, who in him will find a true friend and safe\r\ndepositary of their rights and liberty. I wish I could say as much for\r\nMr. Calhoun and some of his friends.\" He criticised Calhoun for his\r\nsilence on the bank question, for his encouragement of the resolution in\r\nthe South Carolina legislature relative to the tariff, and for his\r\nobjection to the apportionment of the surplus revenues after the\r\nnational debt should be paid. Jackson had not yet definitely learned\r\nfrom Forsyth's letter about Calhoun's attitude in Monroe's cabinet; but\r\nhis well-aroused suspicion doubtless influenced his expression. His\r\nstrong personal liking for the secretary of state had been evident from\r\nthe beginning of the administration. In a letter to Jesse Hoyt of April\r\n13, 1829, the latter wrote that he had found the President affectionate,\r\nconfidential, and kind to the last degree, and that he believed there\r\nwas no degree of good feeling or confidence which the president did not\r\nentertain for him. In July he wrote to Hamilton: \"The general grows upon\r\nme every day. I can fairly say that I have become quite enamored with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe break between Calhoun and Jackson was kept from the public until\r\nearly in 1831. In the preceding winter, Duff Green, the editor of the\r\n\"Telegraph,\" until then the administration newspaper, but still entirely\r\ncommitted to Calhoun, sought to have the publication of the\r\nCalhoun-Jackson correspondence accompanied by a general outburst from\r\nRepublican newspapers against Jackson. The storm, Benton tells us, was\r\nto seem so universal, and the indignation against Van Buren so great,\r\nthat even Jackson's popularity would not save the prime minister.\r\nJackson's friends, Barry and Kendall, learning of this, called to\r\nWashington an unknown Kentuckian to be editor of a new and loyal\r\nadministration paper. Francis P. Blair was a singularly astute man,\r\nwhose name, and the name of whose family, afterwards became famous in\r\nAmerican politics. He belonged to the race of advisers of great men,\r\nfound by experience to be almost as important in a democracy as in a\r\nmonarchy. In February, 1831, Calhoun openly declared war on Jackson by\r\npublishing the Seminole correspondence. Green having now been safely\r\nreëlected printer to Congress, the \"Telegraph,\" according to the plan,\r\nstrongly supported Calhoun. The \"Globe,\" Blair's paper, attacked Calhoun\r\nand upheld the President. The importance in that day ascribed by\r\npoliticians to the control of a single newspaper seems curious. In 1823,\r\nVan Buren, while a federal senator, was interested in the \"Albany\r\nArgus,\" almost steadily from that time until the present the ably\r\nmanaged organ of the Albany Regency;[9] and he then confidentially\r\nwrote to Hoyt: \"Without a paper thus edited at Albany we may hang our\r\nharps on the willows. With it, the party can survive a thousand such\r\nconvulsions as those which now agitate and probably alarm most of those\r\naround you.\" This seems an astonishingly high estimate of the power of a\r\npaper which, though relatively conspicuous in the State, could have then\r\nhad but a small circulation. It was, however, the judgment of a most\r\nsagacious politician. In 1822 he complained to Hoyt that his expenses of\r\nthis description were too heavy. In 1833 James Gordon Bennett, then a\r\nyoung journalist of Philadelphia, wrote Hoyt a plain intimation that\r\nmoney was necessary to enable him to continue his journalistic warfare\r\nin Van Buren's behalf. Anguish, disappointment, despair, he said,\r\nbrooded over him, while Van Buren chose to sit still and sacrifice those\r\nwho had supported him in every weather. Van Buren replied that he could\r\nnot directly or indirectly afford pecuniary aid to Bennett's press, and\r\nmore particularly as he was then situated; that if Bennett could not\r\ncontinue friendly to him on public grounds and with perfect\r\nindependence, he could only regret it, but he desired no other support.\r\nHe added, however, not to burn his ships behind him, that he had\r\nsupposed there would be no difficulty in obtaining money in New York, if\r\ntheir \"friends in Philadelphia could not all together make out to\r\nsustain one press.\" Thus was invited a powerful animosity, vindictively\r\nshown even when Van Buren was within three years of his death.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival Blair entered the famous Kitchen Cabinet, a\r\nsingularly talented body, fond enough indeed of \"wire-pulling,\" but with\r\nclear and steady political convictions. William B. Lewis had long been a\r\nclose personal friend of Jackson and manager of his political interests,\r\nand had but recently earned his gratitude by rushing successfully to the\r\ndefense of Mrs. Jackson's reputation. Kendall and Hill were adroit,\r\nindustrious, skillful men; the former afterwards postmaster-general, and\r\nthe latter to become a senator from New Hampshire. Blair entered this\r\ncompany full of zeal against nullification and the United States Bank.\r\nJackson himself was so strong-willed a man, so shrewd in management, so\r\nskillful in reading the public temper, that the story of the complete\r\ndomination of this junto over him is quite absurd. The really great\r\nabilities of these men and their entire devotion to his interests gained\r\na profound and justifiable influence with him, which occasional petty or\r\nunworthy uses made of it did not destroy. No one can doubt that Jackson\r\nwas confirmed by them in the judgment to which Van Buren urged him upon\r\ngreat political issues. The secretary of state refused to give the new\r\npaper of Blair any of the printing of his department, lest its origin\r\nshould be attributed to him, and because he wished to be able to say\r\ntruly that he had nothing to do with it. Kendall, who lived through the\r\ncivil war, strongly loyal to the Union and to Jackson's memory, to die a\r\nwealthy philanthropist, declared in his autobiography, and doubtless\r\ncorrectly, that the \"Globe\" was not established by Van Buren or his\r\nfriends, but by friends of Jackson who desired his reëlection for\r\nanother four years. Nevertheless Van Buren was held responsible for the\r\npaper; and its establishment was soon followed by the dissolution of the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nThis explosion, it is now clear, was of vast advantage to the cause of\r\nthe Union. It took place in April, 1831, and in part at least was Van\r\nBuren's work. On the 9th of that month he wrote to Edward Livingston,\r\nthen a senator from Louisiana spending the summer at his seat on the\r\nHudson River, asking him to start for Washington the day after he\r\nreceived the letter, and to avoid speculation \"by giving out that\" he\r\nwas \"going to Philadelphia.\" Livingston wrote back from Washington to\r\nhis wife that Van Buren had taken the high and popular ground that, as a\r\ncandidate for the presidency, he ought not to remain in the cabinet when\r\nits public measures would be attributed to his intrigue, and thus made\r\nto injure the President; and that Van Buren's place was pressed upon him\r\n\"with all the warmth of friendship and every appeal to my love of\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren, with courageous skill, put his resignation to the public\r\ndistinctly on the ground of his own political aspiration. On April 11,\r\n1831, he wrote to the President a letter for publication, saying that\r\nfrom the moment he had entered the cabinet it had been his \"anxious wish\r\nand zealous endeavor to prevent a premature agitation of the question\"\r\nof the succession, \"and at all events to discountenance, and if possible\r\nrepress, the disposition, at an early day manifested,\" to connect his\r\nname \"with that disturbing topic.\" Of \"the sincerity and constancy\r\nof his disposition\" he appealed to the President to judge. But he\r\nhad not succeeded, and circumstances beyond his control had given\r\nthe subject a turn which could not then \"be remedied except by a\r\nself-disfranchisement, which, even if dictated by\" his \"individual\r\nwishes, could hardly be reconcilable with propriety or self-respect.\" In\r\nthe situation existing at the time, \"diversities of ulterior preference\r\namong the friends of the administration\" were unavoidable, and he added:\r\n\"Even if the respective advocates of those thus placed in rivalship be\r\npatriotic enough to resist the temptation of creating obstacles to the\r\nadvancement of him to whose elevation they are opposed, by embarrassing\r\nthe branch of public service committed to his charge, they are\r\nnevertheless, by their position, exposed to the suspicion of\r\nentertaining and encouraging such views,--a suspicion which can seldom\r\nfail, in the end, to aggravate into present alienation and hostility\r\nthe prospective differences which first gave rise to it.\" The public\r\nservice, he said, required him to remove such \"obstructions\" from \"the\r\nsuccessful prosecution of public affairs;\" and he intimated, with the\r\naffectation of self-depreciation which was disagreeably fashionable\r\namong great men of the day, that the example he set would,\r\n\"notwithstanding the humility of its origin,\" be found worthy of respect\r\nand observance. When four years later he accepted the presidential\r\nnomination he repeated the sentiment of this letter, but more\r\nexplicitly, saying that his \"name was first associated with the question\r\nof General Jackson's successor more through the ill-will of opponents\r\nthan the partiality of friends.\" This seemed very true. For every\r\nmovement which had tended to commit the administration or its chief\r\nagainst Calhoun or his doctrines, he had been held responsible as a\r\ndevice to advance himself. His adversaries had proclaimed him not so\r\nmuch a public officer as a self-seeking candidate. It was a rare and\r\ntrue stroke of political genius to admit his aspiration to the\r\npresidency; to deny his present candidacy and his self-seeking; but,\r\nlest the clamor of his enemies should, if he longer held his office,\r\nthrow doubt upon his sincerity, to withdraw from that station, and to\r\nprevent the continued pretense that he was using official opportunities,\r\nhowever legitimately, to increase his public reputation or his political\r\npower. Thus would the candidacy be thrust on him by his enemies. In his\r\nletter he announced that Jackson had consented to stand for reëlection;\r\nand that, \"without a total disregard of the lights of experience,\" he\r\ncould not shut his eyes to the unfavorable influence which his\r\ncontinuance in the cabinet might have upon Jackson's own canvass in\r\n1832.\r\n\r\nIn accepting the resignation Jackson declared the reasons which the\r\nletter had presented too strong to be disregarded, thus practically\r\nassenting to Van Buren's candidacy to succeed him. Jackson looked with\r\nsorrow, he said, upon the state of things Van Buren had described. But\r\nit was \"but an instance of one of the evils to which free governments\r\nmust ever be liable,\" an evil whose remedy lay \"in the intelligence and\r\npublic spirit of\" their \"common constituents,\" who would correct it; and\r\nin that belief he found \"abundant consolation.\" He added that, with the\r\nbest opportunities for observing and judging, he had seen in Van Buren\r\nno other desire than \"to move quietly on in the path of\" his duties, and\r\n\"to promote the harmonious conduct of public affairs.\" \"If on this\r\npoint,\" he apostrophized the departing premier, \"you have had to\r\nencounter detraction, it is but another proof of the utter insufficiency\r\nof innocence and worth to shield from such assaults.\"\r\n\r\nNever was a presidential candidate more adroitly or less dishonorably\r\npresented to his party and to the country. For the adroitness lay in the\r\nfrank avowal of a willingness or desire to be president and a resolution\r\nto be a candidate,--for which, so far as their conduct went, his\r\nadversaries were really responsible,--and in seizing an undoubted\r\nopportunity to serve the public. Quite apart from the sound reason that\r\nthe secretary of state should not, if possible, be exposed in dealing\r\nwith public questions to aspersions upon his motives, as Van Buren was\r\nquite right in saying that he would be, it was also clear that the\r\ncabinet was inharmonious; and that its lack of harmony, whatever the\r\nfacts or wherever the fault, seriously interfered with the public\r\nbusiness. The administration and the country, it was obvious, were now\r\napproaching the question of nullification, and upon that question it was\r\nbut patriotic to desire that its members should firmly share the union\r\nprinciples of their chief. Within a few weeks after the dissolution of\r\nthe cabinet, Jackson seized the opportunity afforded him by an\r\ninvitation from the city of Charleston to visit it on the 4th of July,\r\nto sound in the ears of nullification a ringing blast for the Union.\r\nIf he could go, he said, he trusted to find in South Carolina \"all\r\nthe men of talent, exalted patriotism, and private worth,\" however\r\ndivided they might have been before, \"united before the altar of\r\ntheir country on the day set apart for the solemn celebration of its\r\nindependence,--independence which cannot exist without union, and with\r\nit is eternal.\" The disunion sentiments ascribed to distinguished\r\ncitizens of the State were, he hoped, if indeed they were accurately\r\nreported, \"the effect of momentary excitement, not deliberate design.\"\r\nFor all the work then performed in defense of the Union, Jackson and\r\nhis advisers of the time must share with Webster and Clay the gratitude\r\nof our own and all later generations. The burst of loyalty in April,\r\n1861, had no less of its genesis in the intrepid front and the political\r\nsuccess of the national administration from 1831 to 1833, than in the\r\npathetic and glorious appeals and aspirations of the great orators.\r\n\r\nJackson now called to the work Edward Livingston, privileged to perform\r\nin it that service of his which deserves a splendid immortality. He\r\nbecame secretary of state on May 24, 1831. Eaton, the secretary of war,\r\nvoluntarily resigned to become governor of Florida; and Barry, the\r\npostmaster-general, who was friendly to the reorganization, was soon\r\nappointed minister to Spain, in which post Eaton later succeeded him.\r\nIngham, Branch, and Berrien, the Calhoun members, were required to\r\nresign. The new cabinet, apart from the state department, was on the\r\nwhole far abler than the old; indeed, it was one of the ablest of\r\nAmerican cabinets. Below Livingston at the council table sat McLane of\r\nDelaware, recalled from the British mission to take the treasury,\r\nGovernor Cass of Michigan, and Senator Woodbury of New Hampshire,\r\nsecretaries of war and navy. Amos Kendall brought to the post-office his\r\nextraordinary astuteness and diligence in administration; and Taney,\r\nlater the chief justice, was attorney-general. The executive talents of\r\nthis body of men, loyal as they were to the plans of Jackson and Van\r\nBuren, promised, and they afterwards brought, success in the struggle\r\nfor the principles now adopted by the party, as well as for the control\r\nof the government. Van Buren stood as truly for a policy of state as\r\never stood any candidate before the American people. One finds it\r\nagreeable now to escape for a moment from the Washington atmosphere of\r\npersonal controversy and ambition. It is not to be forgotten, however,\r\nthat a like atmosphere has surrounded even those political struggles in\r\nAmerica, only three or four in number, which have been greater and\r\ndeeper than that in which Jackson and Van Buren were the chief figures.\r\nFrom this temper of personal controversy and ambition the greatest\r\npolitical benefactors of history have not been free, so inevitable is\r\nthe mingling with large affairs of the varied personal motives,\r\nconscious and unconscious, of those who transact them.\r\n\r\nWhen Van Buren left the first place in Jackson's cabinet, the latter,\r\ntoo, at last stood for the definite policy which he had but imperfectly\r\nadopted when he was elected, and which, as a practical and immediate\r\npolitical plan, it is reasonably safe to assert, was most largely the\r\ncreation of the sagacious mind of his chief associate. Before Van Buren\r\nleft Albany he had written to Hamilton on February 21, 1829, with\r\nreference to Jackson's inaugural: \"I hope the general will not find it\r\nnecessary to avow any opinion upon constitutional questions at war with\r\nthe doctrines of the Jefferson school. Whatever his views may be, there\r\ncan be no necessity of doing so in an inaugural address.\" This shows the\r\ndoubt, which had been caused by some of Jackson's utterances and votes,\r\nof his intelligent and systematic adherence to the political creed\r\npreached by Van Buren. Jackson's inaugural was colorless and safe\r\nenough. Upon strict construction he said that he should \"keep steadily\r\nin view the limitations as well as the extent of the executive power;\"\r\nthat he would be \"animated by a proper respect for those sovereign\r\nmembers of our Union, taking care not to confound the powers they have\r\nreserved to themselves with those they have granted to the confederacy.\"\r\nThe bank he did not mention. And upon the living and really great\r\nquestion, to which Van Buren had given so much study, Jackson said,\r\nhimself probably having a grim sense of humor at the absurd emptiness of\r\nthe sentence: \"Internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge, so\r\nfar as they can be promoted by the constitutional acts of the federal\r\ngovernment, are of high importance.\"\r\n\r\nVery different was the situation when two years later Van Buren left the\r\ncabinet. In several state papers of great dignity and ability and yet\r\npopular and interesting in style, Jackson had formulated a political\r\ncreed closely consistent with that advocated by Van Buren in the Senate.\r\nUpon internal improvements, Jackson, on May 27, 1830, sent to the House\r\nhis famous Maysville Road veto. That road was exclusively within the\r\nState of Ohio, and not connected with any existing system of\r\nimprovements. Jackson very well said that if it could be considered\r\nnational, no further distinction between the appropriate duties of the\r\ngeneral and state governments need be attempted. He pointed out the\r\ntendency of such appropriations, little by little, to distort the\r\nmeaning of the Constitution; and found in former legislation \"an\r\nadmonitory proof of the force of implication, and that necessity of\r\nguarding the Constitution with sleepless vigilance against the authority\r\nof precedents which have not the sanction of its most plainly defined\r\npowers.\" In his annual message of December, 1830, he referred to the\r\nsystem of federal subscriptions to private corporate enterprises,\r\nsaying: \"The power which the general government would acquire within the\r\nseveral States by becoming the principal stockholder in corporations,\r\ncontrolling every canal and each sixty or hundred miles of every\r\nimportant road, and giving a proportionate vote to all their elections,\r\nis almost inconceivable, and in my view dangerous to the liberties of\r\nthe people.\" With these utterances ended the very critical struggle to\r\ngive the federal government a power which even in those days would have\r\nbeen great, and which, as has already been said, had it continued with\r\nthe growth of railways, would have enormously and radically changed our\r\nsystem of government.\r\n\r\nBefore he left the Senate Van Buren had pronounced against the Bank of\r\nthe United States; but Jackson did not mention it in his inaugural. In\r\nhis first annual message, however, Jackson warned Congress that the\r\ncharter of the bank would expire in 1836, and that deliberation upon\r\nits renewal ought to commence at once. \"Both the constitutionality\r\nand the expediency of the law creating this bank,\" he said, \"are well\r\nquestioned ...; and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in the\r\ngreat end of establishing a uniform and sound currency.\" This was plain\r\nenough for a first utterance. A year later he told Congress that nothing\r\nhad occurred to lessen in any degree the dangers which many citizens\r\napprehended from that institution as then organized, though he outlined\r\nan institution which should be not a corporation, but a branch of the\r\nTreasury Department, and not, as he thought, obnoxious to constitutional\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the Cherokee Indians from within the State of Georgia he\r\ndefended by considerations which were practically unanswerable. It was\r\ndangerously inconsistent with our political system to maintain within\r\nthe limits of a State Indian tribes, free from the obligations of state\r\nlaws, having a tribal independence, and bound only by treaty relations\r\nwith the United States. It was harsh to remove the Indians; but it would\r\nhave been harsher to them and to the white people of the State to have\r\nsupported by federal arms an Indian sovereignty within its limits.\r\nJackson, with true Democratic jealousy, refused in his political and\r\nexecutive policy to defer to the merely moral weight of the opinion of\r\nthe Supreme Court. For in that tribunal political and social exigencies\r\ncould have but limited force in answering a question which, as the court\r\nitself decided, called for a political remedy, which the President and\r\nnot the court could apply.\r\n\r\nThe tariff might, Jackson declared, be constitutionally used for\r\nprotective purposes; but the deliberate policy of his party was now\r\nplainly intimated. In his first message he \"regretted that the\r\ncomplicated restrictions which now embarrass the intercourse of nations\r\ncould not by common consent be abolished.\" In the Maysville veto he said\r\nthat, \"as long as the encouragement of domestic manufactures\" was\r\n\"directed to national ends,\" ... it should receive from him \"a temperate\r\nbut steady support.\" But this is to be read with the expression in the\r\nsame paper that the people had a right to demand \"the reduction of every\r\ntax to as low a point as the wise observance of the necessity to protect\r\nthat portion of our manufactures and labor, whose prosperity is\r\nessential to our national safety and independence, will allow.\" This\r\nencouragement was, he said in his inaugural, to be given to those\r\nproducts which might be found \"essential to our national independence.\"\r\nIn his second message he declared \"the obligations upon all the trustees\r\nof political power to exempt those for whom they act from all\r\nunnecessary burdens;\" that \"the resources of the nation beyond those\r\nrequired for the immediate and necessary purposes of government can\r\nnowhere be so well deposited as in the pockets of the people;\" that\r\n\"objects of national importance alone ought to be protected;\" and that\r\n\"of those the productions of our soil, our mines, and our workshops,\r\nessential to national defense, occupy the first rank.\" Other domestic\r\nindustries, having a national importance, and which might, after\r\ntemporary protection, compete with foreign labor on equal terms,\r\nmerited, he said, the same attention in a subordinate degree. The\r\neconomic light here was not very clear or strong, but perhaps as strong\r\nas it often is in a political paper. Jackson's conclusion was that the\r\ntariff then existing taxed some of the comforts of life too highly;\r\nprotected interests too local and minute to justify a general exaction;\r\nand forced some manufactures for which the country was not ripe.\r\n\r\nAll this practical and striking growth in political science had taken\r\nplace during the two years of Jackson's and Van Buren's almost daily\r\nintercourse at Washington. It is impossible from materials yet made\r\npublic to point out with precision the latter's handiwork in each of\r\nthese papers. James A. Hamilton describes his own long nights at the\r\nWhite House on the messages of 1829 and 1830; and his were not the only\r\nnights of the kind spent by Jackson's friends. Jackson, like other\r\nstrong men, and like some whose opportunities of education had been far\r\nampler than his, freely used literary assistance, although, with all his\r\ninaccuracies, he himself wrote in a vigorous, lucid, and interesting\r\nstyle. But with little doubt the political positions taken in these\r\npapers, and which made a definite and lasting creed, were more\r\nimmediately the work of the secretary of state. The consultations with\r\nVan Buren, of which Hamilton tells, are only glimpses of what must\r\ncontinually have gone on. At the time of Jackson's inauguration Hamilton\r\nwrote that the latter's confidence was reposed in men in no way equal to\r\nhim in natural parts, but who had been useful to him in covering \"his\r\nvery lamentable defects of education,\" and whom, through his reluctance\r\nto expose these defects to others, he was compelled to keep about him.\r\nHe added that Van Buren could never reach the same relation which Lewis\r\nheld with the general, because the latter would \"not yield himself so\r\nreadily to superior as to inferior minds.\" This was a mistake. Van\r\nBuren's personal loyalty to Jackson, his remarkable tact and delicacy,\r\nhad promptly aroused in Jackson that extraordinary liking for him which\r\nlasted until Jackson died. With this advantage, Van Buren's clear-cut\r\ntheories of political conduct were easily lodged in Jackson's naturally\r\nwise mind, to whose prepossessions and prejudices they were agreeable,\r\nand received there the deference due to the practical sagacity in which\r\nVan Buren's obvious political success had proved him to be a master. Van\r\nBuren was doubtless greatly aided by the kitchen cabinet. He was careful\r\nto keep on good terms with those who had so familiar an access to\r\nJackson. Kendall's singular and useful ability he soon discovered. It\r\nwas at the latter's instance that Kendall was invited to dinner at the\r\nWhite House, where Van Buren paid him special attention. The influence\r\nof the members of the kitchen cabinet with their master has been much\r\nexaggerated. Soon after Lewis was appointed, and in spite of his\r\npersonal intimacy and of his rumored influence with the President, he\r\nwas, as he wrote to Hamilton, in some anxiety whether he might not be\r\nremoved; the President had at least, he said, entertained a proposition\r\nto remove him, and was therefore, in view of Jackson's great debt to\r\nhim, no longer entitled to his \"friendship or future support.\"\r\n\r\nVery soon after Van Buren's withdrawal from the cabinet, he was accused\r\nof primarily and chiefly causing the official proscription of men for\r\npolitical opinions which began in the federal service under Jackson.\r\nFrom that time to the present the accusation has been carelessly\r\nrepeated from one writer to another, with little original examination of\r\nthe facts. It is clear that Van Buren neither began nor caused this\r\ndemoralizing and disastrous abuse. When he reached Washington in 1829,\r\nthe removals were in full and lamentable progress. In the very first\r\ndays of the administration, McLean was removed from the office of\r\npostmaster-general to a seat in the Supreme Court, because, so Adams\r\nafter an interview with him wrote in his diary on March 14,1829, \"he\r\nrefused to be made the instrument of the sweeping proscription of\r\npostmasters which is to be one of the samples of the promised reform.\"\r\nThis was a week or two before Van Buren reached Washington. On the same\r\nday Samuel Swartwout wrote to Hoyt from Washington: \"No damned rascal\r\nwho made use of his office or its profits for the purpose of keeping Mr.\r\nAdams in, and General Jackson out of power, is entitled to the least\r\nlenity or mercy, save that of hanging.... Whether or not I shall get\r\nanything in the general scramble for plunder remains to be proven; but I\r\nrather guess I shall.... I know Mr. Ingham slightly, and would recommend\r\nyou to push like a devil, if you expect anything from that quarter....\r\nIf I can only keep my own legs, I shall do well; but I'm darned if I can\r\ncarry any weight with me.\" This man, against Van Buren's earnest protest\r\nand to his great disturbance, had some of the devil's luck in pushing.\r\nHe was appointed collector of customs at New York,--one of the principal\r\nfinancial officers in the country. It is not altogether unsatisfactory\r\nto read of the scandalous defalcation of which he was afterwards guilty,\r\nand of the serious injury it dealt his party. The temper which he\r\nexposed so ingenuously, filled Washington at the time. Nor did it come\r\nonly or chiefly from one quarter of the country. Kendall, then fresh\r\nfrom Kentucky, who had been appointed fourth auditor, wrote to his wife,\r\nwith interestingly mingled sentiments: \"I turned out six clerks on\r\nSaturday. Several of them have families and are poor. It was the most\r\npainful thing I ever did; but I could not well get along without it.\r\nAmong them is a poor old man with a young wife and several children. I\r\nshall help to raise a contribution to get him back to Ohio.... I shall\r\nhave a private carriage to go out with me and bring my whole brood of\r\nlittle ones. Bless their sweet faces.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren confidentially wrote to Hamilton from Albany in March, 1829:\r\n\"If the general makes one removal at this moment he must go on. Would it\r\nnot be better to get the streets of Washington clear of office-seekers\r\nfirst in the way I proposed?... As to the publication in the newspapers\r\nI have more to say. So far as depends on me, my course will be to\r\nrestore by a single order every one who has been turned out by Mr. Clay\r\nfor political reasons, unless circumstances of a personal character have\r\nsince arisen which would make the reappointment in any case improper. To\r\nascertain that will take a little time. There I would pause.\" Among the\r\nMackenzie letters is one from Lorenzo Hoyt, describing an interview with\r\nVan Buren while governor, and then complaining that the latter would\r\n\"not lend the utmost weight of his influence to displace from office\r\nsuch men as John Duer,\" Adams's appointee as United States attorney at\r\nNew York. If they had been struggling for political success for the\r\nbenefit of their opponents, he angrily wrote, he wished to know it. He\r\nadded, however, that, from the behavior of the President thus far, he\r\nthought Jackson would \"go the whole hog.\" This was before Van Buren\r\nreached Washington. In answer to an insolent letter of Jesse Hoyt urging\r\na removal, and telling the secretary of state that there was a \"charm\r\nattending bold measures extremely fascinating\" which had given Jackson\r\nall his glory, Van Buren wrote back: \"Here I am engaged in the most\r\nintricate and important affairs, which are new to me, and upon the\r\nsuccessful conduct of which my reputation as well as the interests of\r\nthe country depend, and which keep me occupied from early in the morning\r\nuntil late at night. And can you think it kind or just to harass me\r\nunder such circumstances with letters which no man of common sensibility\r\ncan read without pain?... I must be plain with you.... The terms upon\r\nwhich you have seen fit to place our intercourse are inadmissible.\"\r\nIngham, Jackson's secretary of the treasury, the next day wrote to this\r\ntypical office-seeker that the rage for office in New York was such that\r\nan enemy menacing the city with desolation would not cause more\r\nexcitement. He added, speaking of his own legitimate work: \"These duties\r\ncannot be postponed; and I do assure you that I am compelled daily to\r\nfile away long lists of recommendations, etc., without reading them,\r\nalthough I work 18 hours out of the 24 with all diligence. The\r\nappointments can be postponed; other matters cannot; and it was one of\r\nthe prominent errors of the late administration that they suffered many\r\nimportant public interests to be neglected, while they were cruising\r\nabout to secure or buy up partisans. This we must not do.\"\r\n\r\nBenton, friendly as he was to Jackson, condemned the system of removals;\r\nand his fairness may well be trusted. He said that in Jackson's first\r\nyear (in which De Tocqueville, whom he was answering, said that Jackson\r\nhad removed every removable functionary) there were removed but 690\r\nofficers through the whole United States for all causes, of whom 491\r\nwere postmasters: the entire number of postmasters being at the time\r\nnearly 8000. Kendall, reviewing the first three years of Jackson's\r\nadministration near their expiration, said that in the city of\r\nWashington there had been removed but one officer out of seven, and\r\n\"most of them for bad conduct and character,\" a statement some of the\r\nsignificance of which doubtless depends upon what was \"bad character,\"\r\nbut which still fairly limits the epithet \"wholesale\" customarily\r\napplied to these removals. In the Post-Office Department, he said, the\r\nremovals had been only one out of sixteen, and in the whole government\r\nbut one out of eleven. Kendall was speaking for party purposes; but he\r\nwas cautious and precise; and his statements, made near the time, show\r\nhow far behind the sudden \"clean sweep\" of 1861 was this earlier essay\r\nin \"spoils,\" and how much exaggeration there has been on the subject.\r\nBenton says that in the departments at Washington a majority of the\r\nemployees were opposed to Jackson throughout his administration. Of the\r\nofficers having a judicial function, such as land and claims\r\ncommissioners, territorial judges, justices in the District of Columbia,\r\nnone were removed. The readiness to remove was stimulated by the\r\ndiscovery of the frauds of Tobias Watkins, made just after his removal\r\nfrom the fourth auditor's place, to which Kendall was appointed. Watkins\r\nhad been Adams's warm personal friend, so the latter states in his\r\ndiary, and \"an over active partisan against Jackson at the last\r\npresidential election.\" Unreasonable as was a general inference from one\r\nof the instances of dishonesty which occur under the best\r\nadministrations, and a flagrant instance of which was soon to occur\r\nunder his own administration, it justified Jackson in his own eyes for\r\nmany really shameful removals. There had doubtless been among\r\noffice-holders under Adams a good deal of the \"offensive partisanship\"\r\nof our day, many expressions of horror by subordinate officers at the\r\npicture of Jackson as president. All this had angered Jackson, whose\r\nimperial temper readily classed his subordinates as servants of Andrew\r\nJackson, rather than as ministers of the public service. Moreover, his\r\naccession, as Benton not unfairly pointed out, was the first great party\r\nchange since Jefferson had succeeded the elder Adams. Offices had\r\ngreatly increased in number. In the profound democratic change that had\r\nbeen actively operating for a quarter of a century, the force of old\r\ntraditions had been broken in many useful as in many useless things.\r\nGreat numbers of inferior offices had now become political, not only in\r\nNew York, but in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and other States. Adams's\r\nadministration, except in the change of policy upon large questions, had\r\nbeen a continuation of Monroe's. He went from the first place in\r\nMonroe's cabinet to the presidency. His secretaries of the treasury and\r\nthe navy and his postmaster-general and attorney-general had held office\r\nunder Monroe, the latter three in the very same places. But Jackson\r\nthrust out of the presidency his rival, who had naturally enough been\r\nearnestly sustained by large numbers of his subordinates; and Adams's\r\nappointees were doubtless in general followers of himself and of Clay.\r\n\r\nJackson's first message contained a serious defense of the removals. Men\r\nlong in office, he said, acquired the \"habit of looking with\r\nindifference upon the public interests,\" and office became considered \"a\r\nspecies of property.\" \"The duties of all public officers,\" he declared,\r\nwith an ignorance then very common among Americans, could be \"made so\r\nplain and simple that men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves\r\nfor their performance.\" Further, he pointed out that no one man had \"any\r\nmore intrinsic right\" to office than another; and therefore \"no\r\nindividual wrong\" was done by removal. The officer removed, he\r\nconcluded, with almost a demagogic touch, had the same means of earning\r\na living as \"the millions who never held office.\" In spite of individual\r\ndistress he wished \"rotation in office\" to become \"a leading principle\r\nin the Republican creed.\" Unfounded as most of this is now clearly seen\r\nto be, it is certain that the reasoning was convincing to a very large\r\npart of the American people.\r\n\r\nIn his own department Van Buren practiced little of the proscription\r\nwhich was active elsewhere. Of seventeen foreign representatives, but\r\nfour were removed in the first year. Doubtless he was fortunate in\r\nhaving an office without the amount of patronage of the Post-Office or\r\nthe Treasury. Nothing in his career, however, showed a personal liking\r\nfor removals. The distribution of offices was not distasteful to him;\r\nbut his temper was neither prescriptive nor unfriendly. At times even\r\nhis partisan loyalty was doubted for his reluctance in this, which was\r\nsoon deemed an appropriate and even necessary party work.\r\n\r\nBut Van Buren did not oppose the ruinous and demoralizing system.\r\nPowerful as he was with Jackson, wise and far-seeing as he was, he must\r\nreceive for his acquiescence, or even for his silence, a part of the\r\ncondemnation which the American people, as time goes on, will more and\r\nmore visit upon one of the great political offenses committed against\r\ntheir political integrity and welfare. But it must in justice be\r\nremembered, not only that Van Buren did not begin or actively conduct\r\nthe distribution of spoils; not only that his acquiescence was in a\r\npractice which in his own State he had found well established; but that\r\nthe practice in which he thus joined was one which it is probable he\r\ncould not have fully resisted without his own political destruction, and\r\nperhaps the temporary prostration of the political causes to which he\r\nwas devoted. Though these be palliations and not defenses, the\r\nbiographer ought not to apply to human nature a rule of unprecedented\r\nausterity. In Van Buren's politic yielding there was little, if any,\r\nmore timidity or time-serving than in the like yielding by every man\r\nholding great office in the United States since Jackson's inauguration;\r\nand the worst, the most corrupting, and the most demoralizing official\r\nproscription in America took place thirty-two years afterwards, and\r\nunder a president who, in wise and exalted patriotism, was one of the\r\ngreatest statesmen, as he has been perhaps the best loved, of Americans,\r\nand to whom blame ought to be assigned all the larger by reason of the\r\nextraordinary power and prestige he enjoyed, and the moral fervor of the\r\nnation behind him, which rendered less necessary this unworthy aid of\r\ninferior patronage.\r\n\r\nSo crowded and interesting were the two years of Van Buren's life in the\r\ncabinet with matters apart from the special duties of his office, that\r\nit is only at the last, and briefly, that an account can be given of his\r\ncareer as secretary of state. His conduct of foreign affairs was firm,\r\nadroit, dignified, and highly successful. It utterly broke the ideal of\r\nturbulent and menacing incompetence which the Whigs set up for Jackson's\r\npresidency. He had to solve no difficulty of the very first order; for\r\nthe United States were in profound peace with the whole world. He\r\nperformed, however, with skill and success two diplomatic services of\r\nreal importance, services which brought deserved and most valuable\r\nstrength to Jackson's administration. The American claims for French\r\nspoliations upon American ships during the operation of Napoleon's\r\nBerlin and Milan decrees had been under discussion for many years. They\r\nwere now resolutely pressed. In his message of December, 1829, Jackson,\r\ndoubtless under Van Buren's advice, paid some compliments to \"France,\r\nour ancient ally;\" but then said very plainly that these claims, unless\r\nsatisfied, would continue \"a subject of unpleasant discussion and\r\npossible collision between the two governments.\" He politely referred to\r\n\"the known integrity of the French monarch,\" Charles X., as an assurance\r\nthat the claims would be paid. A few months afterwards this Bourbon was\r\ntumbled off the French throne; and in December, 1830, Jackson with\r\nincreased courtliness, and with a flattering allusion to Lafayette,\r\nconspicuous in this milder revolution as he had been in 1789, rejoiced\r\nin \"the high voucher we possess for the enlarged views and pure\r\nintegrity\" of Louis Philippe. The new American vigor, doubtless aided by\r\nthe liberal change in France, brought a treaty on July 4, 1831, under\r\nwhich $5,000,000 was to be paid by France, a result which Jackson, with\r\npardonable boasting, said in his message of December, 1831, was an\r\nencouragement \"for perseverance in the demands of justice,\" and would\r\nadmonish other powers, if any, inclined to evade those demands, that\r\nthey would never be abandoned. The French treaty came so soon after Van\r\nBuren's retirement from the state department, and followed so naturally\r\nupon the methods of his negotiation, and his instructions to William C.\r\nRives, our minister at Paris, that much of its credit belonged to him.\r\nIn March, 1830, a treaty was made with Denmark requiring the payment of\r\n$650,000 for Danish spoliations on American commerce. The effective\r\npressing of these claims was justly one of the most popular performances\r\nof the administration. Commercial treaties were concluded with Austria\r\nin August, 1829; with Turkey in May, 1830; and with Mexico in April,\r\n1831.\r\n\r\nBut the chief transaction of Van Buren's foreign administration was the\r\nopening of trade in American vessels between the United States and the\r\nBritish West Indian colonies. This commerce was then relatively much\r\nmore important to the United States than in later times; and it was\r\nchiefly by American shipping that American commerce was carried on with\r\nforeign countries. The absurd and odious restrictions upon intercourse\r\nso highly natural and advantageous to the people of our seaboard and of\r\nthe British West Indian islands had led to smuggling on a large scale,\r\nand were fruitful of international irritations. Retaliatory acts of\r\nCongress and Parliament, prohibitive proclamations of our presidents,\r\nand British orders in council, had at different times, since the close\r\nof the second British war in 1815, oppressed or prevented honest and\r\nprofitable trade between neighbors who ought to have been friendly\r\ntraders. Van Buren found the immediate position to be as follows. In\r\nJuly, 1825, an act of Parliament had allowed foreign vessels to trade to\r\nthe British colonies upon conditions. To secure for American vessels the\r\nbenefit of this act, it was necessary that within one year American\r\nports should be open to British vessels bringing the same kind of\r\nBritish or colonial produce as could be imported in American vessels;\r\nthat British and American vessels in the trade should pay the same\r\ngovernment charges; that alien duties on British vessels and cargoes,\r\nthat is, duties not imposed on the like vessels and cargoes owned by\r\nAmericans, should be suspended; and that the provision of an American\r\nlaw of 1823 limiting the privileges of the colonial trade to British\r\nvessels carrying colonial produce to American ports directly from the\r\ncolonies exporting it, and without stopping at intermediate ports,\r\nshould be repealed. John Quincy Adams's administration had failed within\r\nthe year to comply with the conditions imposed by the British law of\r\n1825. In 1826, therefore, Great Britain forbade this trade and\r\nintercourse in American vessels. Adams retorted with a counter\r\nprohibition in March, 1827. And in this unfortunate position Van Buren\r\nfound our commercial relations with the West Indian, Bahama, and South\r\nAmerican colonies of England. The situation was aggravated by a claim\r\nmade by the American government in 1823 that American goods should pay\r\nin the colonial ports no higher duties than British goods, a protest\r\nagainst British protection to British industry in the British colonies\r\ncoming with little grace from a country itself maintaining the\r\nprotective system. Adams had sent Gallatin to England to remedy the\r\ndifficulty, but without success.\r\n\r\nVan Buren adopted a different method of negotiation. A more conciliatory\r\nbearing was assumed towards our traditional adversary. Jackson, in\r\nlanguage sounding strangely from his imperious mouth, was made to say in\r\nhis first message that \"with Great Britain, alike distinguished in peace\r\nand war, we may look forward to years of peaceful, honorable, and\r\nelevated competition; that it is their policy to preserve the most\r\ncordial relations.\" These, he said, were his own views; and such were\r\n\"the prevailing sentiments of our constituents.\" In his instructions to\r\nMcLane, the minister at London, Van Buren, departing widely from\r\nconventional diplomacy, expressly conceded that the American government\r\nhad been wrong in its claim that England should admit to its colonies\r\nAmerican goods on as favorable terms as British goods; that it had been\r\nwrong in requiring British ships bringing colonial produce to come and\r\ngo directly from and to the producing colonies; and that it had been\r\nwrong in refusing the privileges offered by the British law of 1825.\r\nThis frank surrender of untenable positions showed the highest skill in\r\nnegotiation, a business for which Van Buren was perhaps better equipped\r\nthan any American of his time. In these points we were \"assailable;\" we\r\nhad \"too long and too tenaciously\" resisted British rights. After these\r\nadmissions, it would, he said, be improper for Great Britain to suffer\r\n\"any feelings that find their origin in the past pretensions of this\r\ngovernment to have an adverse influence upon the present conduct of\r\nGreat Britain.\" McLane was to tell the Earl of Aberdeen that \"to set up\r\nthe act of the late administration as the cause of forfeiture of\r\nprivileges which would otherwise be extended to the people of the United\r\nStates would, under existing circumstances, be unjust in itself, and\r\ncould not fail to excite their deepest sensibility.\" McLane was also to\r\nallude to the parts taken by the members of Jackson's administration in\r\nthe former treatment of the question under discussion. And here Van\r\nBuren used the objectionable sentence which led to his subsequent\r\nrejection by the Senate as minister to England, and which through that,\r\nsuch are the curious caprices of politics, led, or at least helped to\r\nlead, him to the presidency. He said, \"Their views upon that point have\r\nbeen submitted to the people of the United States; and the counsels by\r\nwhich your conduct is now directed are the result of the judgment\r\nexpressed by the only earthly tribunal to which the late administration\r\nwas amenable for its acts.\"\r\n\r\nIn Van Buren's sagacious desire to emphasize the abandonment of claims\r\npreventing the negotiation, he here introduced to a foreign nation the\r\nAmerican people as a judge that had condemned the assertion of such\r\nclaims by Jackson's predecessor. The statement was at least an\r\nexaggeration. There was little reason to suppose that Adams's failure in\r\nthe negotiation over colonial trade had much, if at all, influenced the\r\nelection of 1828. Nor was it dignified to officially expose our party\r\ncontests to foreign eyes. But Van Buren was intent upon success in the\r\nnegotiation. He could succeed where others had failed, only by a strong\r\nassertion of a change in American policy. His fault was at most one of\r\ntaste in the manner of an assertion right enough and wise enough in\r\nitself. Nor were these celebrated instructions lacking in firmness or\r\ndignity. Great Britain was clearly warned that she must then decide for\r\nall time whether the hardships from which her West Indian planters\r\nsuffered should continue; and that the United States would not \"in\r\nexpiation of supposed past encroachments\" repeal their laws, leaving\r\nthemselves \"wholly dependent upon the indulgence of Great Britain,\" and\r\nnot knowing in advance what course she would follow. In his speech in\r\nthe Senate in February, 1827, Van Buren had clearly stated the general\r\npositions which he took in this famous dispatch. It is rather curious,\r\nhowever, that he found occasion then to say upon this very subject what\r\nhe seemed afterwards to forget, that \"in the collisions which may arise\r\nbetween the United States and a foreign power, it is our duty to present\r\nan unbroken front; domestic differences, if they tend to give\r\nencouragement to unjust pretensions, should be extinguished or deferred;\r\nand the cause of our government must be considered as the cause of our\r\ncountry.\" So easy it is to advise other men to be bold and firm.\r\n\r\nMcLane's long and very able letter to the British foreign secretary\r\nclosely followed his instructions. Lord Aberdeen was frankly told that\r\nthe United States had committed \"mistakes\" in the past; and that the\r\n\"American pretensions\" which had prevented a former arrangement would\r\nnot be revived. The negotiation was entirely successful. In October,\r\n1830, the President, with the authorization of Congress, declared\r\nAmerican ports open to British vessels and their cargoes coming from the\r\ncolonies, and that they should be subject to the same charges as\r\nAmerican vessels coming from the same colonies. In November a British\r\norder in council gave to American vessels corresponding privileges. On\r\nJanuary 3, 1831, Jackson sent to the Senate the papers, including Van\r\nBuren's letter of instructions. No criticism was made upon their tenor;\r\nand the public, heedless of the phrases used in reaching the end,\r\nrejoiced in a most beneficent opening of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMINISTER TO ENGLAND.--VICE-PRESIDENT.--ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1831 Van Buren knew very well the strong hold he had\r\nupon his party, the entire and almost affectionate confidence which he\r\nenjoyed from Jackson, and the prestige which his political and official\r\nsuccess had brought him. But to the country, as he was well aware, he\r\nseemed also to be, as he was, a politician, obviously skilled in the\r\nart, and an avowed candidate for the presidency. His conciliatory\r\nbearing, his abstinence from personal abuse, his freedom from personal\r\nanimosities, all were widely declared to be the mere incidents of\r\nconstant duplicity and intrigue. The absence of proof, and his own\r\nexplicit denial and appeal to those who knew the facts, did not protect\r\nhim from the belief of his adversaries--a belief which, without\r\nexamination, has since been widely adopted--that to prostrate a\r\ndangerous rival he had promoted the quarrel between Jackson and Calhoun.\r\nMcLane, the minister at London, wished to come home, and was to be the\r\nnew secretary of the treasury. Van Buren gladly seized the opportunity.\r\nHe would leave the field of political management. Three thousand miles\r\nin distance and a month in time away from Washington or New York, there\r\ncould, he thought, be little pretense of personal manoeuvres on his\r\npart. He would thus plainly submit his candidacy to popular judgment\r\nupon his public career, without interference from himself. He would\r\nescape the many embarrassments of every politician upon whom demands are\r\ncontinually made,--demands whose rejection or allowance alike brings\r\noffense. The English mission was prominently in the public service, but\r\nout of its difficulties; and it was made particularly grateful to him by\r\nhis success in the recent negotiation over colonial trade. He therefore\r\naccepted the post, for which in almost every respect he had\r\nextraordinary equipment. He finally left the State Department in June,\r\n1831; and on his departure from Washington Jackson conspicuously rode\r\nwith him out of the city. On August 1, he was formally appointed\r\nminister to Great Britain; and in September he arrived in London,\r\naccompanied by his son John.\r\n\r\nVan Buren found Washington Irving presiding over the London legation in\r\nMcLane's absence as _chargé d'affaires_. Irving's appointment to be\r\nsecretary of legation under McLane had been one of Van Buren's early\r\nacts,--a proof, Irving wrote, \"of the odd way in which this mad world is\r\ngoverned, when a secretary of state of a stern republic gives away\r\noffices of the kind at the recommendation of a jovial little man of the\r\nseas like Jack Nicholson.\" But this was jocose. When the appointment\r\nwas suggested, it was particularly pleasant to Van Buren that this\r\ngraceful and gentle bit of patronage should be given by so grim a figure\r\nas Jackson. Irving had come on from Spain, his \"Columbus\" just finished,\r\nand his \"Alhambra Tales\" ready for writing. His extraordinary popularity\r\nin England and his old familiarity with its life made him highly useful\r\nto the American minister, as Van Buren himself soon found. It was not\r\nthe last time that Englishmen respected the republic of the west the\r\nmore because the respect carried with it an homage to the republic of\r\nletters. Irving's was an early one of the appointments which established\r\nthe agreeable tradition of the American diplomatic and consular service,\r\nthat literary men should always hold some of its places of honor and\r\nprofit. When Van Buren arrived, Irving was already weary of his post and\r\nhad resigned. He remained, however, with the new minister until he too\r\nsurrendered his office. The two men became warm and lifelong friends.\r\nThe day after Van Buren's arrival Irving wrote: \"I have just seen Mr.\r\nVan Buren, and do not wonder you should all be so fond of him. His\r\nmanners are most amiable and ingratiating; and I have no doubt he will\r\nbecome a favorite at this court.\" After an intimacy of several months he\r\nwrote: \"The more I see of Mr. Van Buren, the more I feel confirmed in a\r\nstrong personal regard for him. He is one of the gentlest and most\r\namiable men I have ever met with; with an affectionate disposition that\r\nattaches itself to those around him, and wins their kindness in return.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few months of the charming life which an American of distinction\r\nfinds open to him in London, a life for whose duties and whose pleasures\r\nVan Buren was happily fitted,[10] there came to him an extraordinary and\r\nenviable delight. He posted through England in an open carriage with the\r\nauthor of the \"Sketch Book\" and \"Bracebridge Hall.\" From those daintiest\r\nsources he had years before got an idea of English country life, and of\r\nthe festivities of an old-fashioned English Christmas; and now in an\r\nexquisite companionship the idea became more nearly clothed with reality\r\nthan happens with most literary enchantments. After Oxford and Blenheim;\r\nafter quartering in Stratford at the little inn of the Red Horse, where\r\nthey \"found the same obliging little landlady that kept it at the time\r\nof the visit recorded in the 'Sketch Book';\" after Warwick Castle and\r\nKenilworth and Lichfield and Newstead Abbey and Hardwick Castle; after a\r\nfortnight at Christmas in Barlborough Hall,--\"a complete scene of old\r\nEnglish hospitality,\" with many of the ancient games and customs then\r\nobsolete in other parts of England; after seeing there the \"mummers and\r\nmorris dancers and glee singers;\" after \"great feasting with the\r\nboar's-head crowned with holly, the wassail bowl, the yule-log,\r\nsnapdragon, etc.;\"--after all these delights, inimitably told by his\r\ncompanion, Van Buren returned to London, but not for long. He there\r\nenjoyed the halcyon days which the brilliant society of London knew,\r\nwhen George IV. had just left the throne to his undignified but\r\ngood-hearted and jovial brother; when Louis Philippe had found a\r\nbourgeois crown in France and the condescending approval of England;\r\nwhen Wellington was the first of Englishmen; when Prince Talleyrand, his\r\nearly republicanism and sacrileges not at all forgotten, but forgiven to\r\nthe prestige of his abilities and the splendid fascinations of his\r\nsociety, was the chief person in diplomatic life; when the Wizard of the\r\nNorth, though broken, and on his last and vain trip to the Mediterranean\r\nfor health, still lingered in London, one of its grand figures, and\r\nsadly recalled to Irving the times when they \"went over the Eildon hills\r\ntogether;\" when Rogers was playing Mæcenas and Catullus at\r\nbreakfast-tables of poets and bankers and noblemen. It was amid this\r\nserene, shining, and magical translation from the politics at home that\r\nVan Buren received the rude and humiliating news of his rejection by the\r\nSenate; for his appointment had been made in recess, and he had left\r\nwithout a confirmation.\r\n\r\nOne evening in February, 1832, before attending a party at\r\nTalleyrand's, Van Buren learned of the rejection, as had all London\r\nwhich knew there was an American minister. He was half ill when the news\r\ncame; but he seemed imperturbable. Without shrinking he mixed in the\r\nsplendid throng, gracious and easy, as if he did not know that his\r\nofficial heart would soon cease to beat. Lord Auckland, then president\r\nof the board of trade and afterwards governor-general of India, said to\r\nhim very truly, and more prophetically than he fancied: \"It is an\r\nadvantage to a public man to be the subject of an outrage.\" Levees and\r\ndrawing-rooms and state dinners were being held in honor of the queen's\r\nbirthday. After a doubt as to the more decorous course, he kept the\r\ntenor of diplomatic life until he ceased to be a minister; and Irving\r\nsaid that, \"to the credit of John Bull,\" he \"was universally received\r\nwith the most marked attention,\" and \"treated with more respect and\r\nattention than before by the royal family, by the members of the present\r\nand the old cabinet, and the different persons of the diplomatic corps.\"\r\nOn March 22, 1832, he had his audience of leave; two days later he dined\r\nwith the king at Windsor; and about April 1 left for Holland and a\r\ncontinental trip, this being, so he wrote a committee appointed at an\r\nindignation meeting in Tammany Hall, \"the only opportunity\" he should\r\nprobably ever have for the visit.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's dispatches from England, now preserved in the archives of\r\nthe State Department, are not numerous. They were evidently written by\r\na minister who was not very busy in official duties apart from the\r\nsocial and ceremonial life of a diplomat. Some of them are in his own\r\nhandwriting, whose straggling carelessness is quite out of keeping with\r\nthe obvious pains which he bestowed upon every subject he touched, even\r\nthose of seemingly slight consequence. Interspersed with allusions to\r\nthe northeastern boundary question, and with accounts of his protests\r\nagainst abuses practiced upon American ships in British ports, and of\r\nthe spread of the cholera, he gave English political news and even\r\ngossip. He discussed the chances of the reform bill, rumors of what the\r\nministry would do, and whether the Duke of Wellington would yield. Van\r\nBuren participated in no important dispute, although before surrendering\r\nhis post he presented one of the hateful claims which American\r\nadministrations of both parties had to make in those days. This was the\r\ndemand for slaves who escaped from the American brig \"Comet,\" wrecked in\r\nthe Bahamas, on her way from the Potomac to New Orleans, and who were\r\ndeclared free by the colonial authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to believe that Secretary Livingston read the more\r\ninteresting of these letters at the White House. Van Buren discreetly\r\nlightened up some of the diplomatic pages with passages very agreeable\r\nto Jackson. In describing his presentation to William IV., he told\r\nLivingston that the king had formed the highest estimate of Jackson's\r\ncharacter, and repeated the royal remark \"that detraction and\r\nmisrepresentation were the common lot of all public men.\" Of the\r\nPresident's message of December, 1831, he wrote that few in England\r\nrefused to recognize its ability or the \"distinguished talents of the\r\nexecutive by whose advice and labors\" the affairs \"of our highly favored\r\ncountry\" had been \"conducted to such happy results.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 1832, Van Buren arrived at New York, having several weeks\r\nbefore been nominated for the vice-presidency. He declined a public\r\nreception, he said, because, afflicted as New York was with the cholera,\r\nfestivities would be discordant with the feelings of his friends; and a\r\nfew days later he was in Washington. Congress was in session, debating\r\nthe tariff bill; and he quickly enough found it true, as he had already\r\nbelieved, that his rejection had been a capital blunder of his enemies.\r\nThe rejection occurred on January 25, 1832. Jackson's nomination had\r\ngone to the Senate early in December, but the opposition had hesitated\r\nat the responsibility for the affront. The debate took place in secret\r\nsession, but the speeches were promptly made public for their effect on\r\nthe country. Clay and Webster, the great leaders of the Whigs, and\r\nHayne, the eloquent representative of the Calhoun Democracy, and others,\r\nspoke against Van Buren. Clay and Webster based their rejection upon his\r\nlanguage in the dispatch to McLane, already quoted. Webster said that\r\nhe would pardon almost anything where he saw true patriotism and sound\r\nAmerican feeling; but he could not forgive the sacrifice of these to\r\nparty. Van Buren, with sensible and skillful foresight, had frankly\r\nadmitted that we had been wrong in some of our claims; and Gallatin, it\r\nwas afterwards shown from his original dispatch to Clay, had expressly\r\nsaid the same thing. But in a bit of buncombe Webster insisted that no\r\nAmerican minister must ever admit that his country had been wrong. \"In\r\nthe presence of foreign courts,\" he solemnly said, \"amidst the\r\nmonarchies of Europe, he is to stand up for his country and his whole\r\ncountry; that no jot nor tittle of her honor is to suffer in his hands;\r\nthat he is not to allow others to reproach either his government or his\r\ncountry, and far less is he himself to reproach either; that he is to\r\nhave no objects in his eye but American objects, and no heart in his\r\nbosom but an American heart.\" To say all this, Webster declared, was a\r\nduty whose performance he wished might be heard \"by every independent\r\nfreeman in the United States, by the British minister and the British\r\nking, and every minister and every crowned head in Europe.\" Van Buren's\r\nlanguage, Clay said, had been that of an humble vassal to a proud and\r\nhaughty lord, prostrating and degrading the American eagle before the\r\nBritish lion. These cheap appeals fell perfectly flat. If Van Buren had\r\nbeen open to criticism for the manner in which he pointed out a party\r\nchange in American administration, the error was, at the worst,\r\ncommitted to preclude a British refusal from finding justification in\r\nthe offensive attitude previously taken by Adams. In admitting our\r\nmistaken \"pretensions,\" Van Buren had been entirely right, barring a\r\nslight fault in the word, which did not, however, then seem to import\r\nthe consciousness of wrong which it carries to later ears. Webster and\r\nClay ought to have known that Van Buren's success where all before had\r\nfailed would make the American people loath to find fault with his\r\nphrases. Nor were they at all ready to believe that Jackson's\r\nadministration toadied to foreign courts. They knew better; they were\r\nconvinced that no American president had been more resolute towards\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nIt was also said that Van Buren had introduced the system of driving men\r\nfrom office for political opinions; that he was a New York politician\r\nwho had brought his art to Washington. Marcy, one of the New York\r\nsenators, defended his State with these words, which afterwards he must\r\nhave wished to recall: \"It may be, sir, that the politicians of New York\r\nare not so fastidious as some gentlemen are as to disclosing the\r\nprinciples on which they act. They boldly preach what they practice.\r\nWhen they are contending for victory they avow their intention of\r\nenjoying the fruits of it. If they are defeated, they expect to retire\r\nfrom office; if they are successful, they claim, as a matter of right,\r\nthe advantages of success. They see nothing wrong in the rule that to\r\nthe victor belong the spoils of the enemy.\" To this celebrated and\r\nexecrable defense Van Buren owes much of the later and unjust belief\r\nthat he was an inveterate \"spoilsman.\" It has already been shown how\r\nlittle foundation there is for the charge that he introduced the system\r\nof official proscription. Benton truly said that Van Buren's temper and\r\njudgment were both against it, and that he gave ample proofs of his\r\nforbearance. Webster did not touch upon this objection. Clay made it\r\nvery subordinate to the secretary's abasement before the British lion.\r\n\r\nThe attack of the Calhoun men was based upon Van Buren's supposed\r\nintrigue against their chief, and his breaking up of the cabinet. But\r\npeople saw then, better indeed than some historians have since seen,\r\nthat between Calhoun and Van Buren there had been great and radical\r\npolitical divergence far deeper than personal jealousy. To surrender the\r\nhighest cabinet office, to leave Washington and all the places of\r\npolitical management, in order to take a lower office in remote exile\r\nfrom the sources of political power,--these were not believed to be acts\r\nof mere trickery, but rather to be parts of a courageous and\r\nself-respecting appeal for justice. It seemed a piece of political\r\nanimosity wantonly to punish a rival with such exquisite humiliation in\r\nthe eyes of foreigners.\r\n\r\nThere was a clear majority against confirming Van Buren. But to make his\r\ndestruction the more signal, and as Calhoun had no opportunity to speak,\r\nenough of the majority refrained from voting to enable the Democratic\r\nvice-president to give the casting vote for the rejection of this\r\nDemocratic nominee. Calhoun's motive was obvious enough from his boast\r\nin Benton's hearing: \"It will kill him, sir, kill him dead. He will\r\nnever kick, sir, never kick.\" This bit of unaffected nature was\r\nrefreshing after all the solemnly insincere declarations of grief which\r\nhad fallen from the opposition senators in performing their duty.\r\n\r\nThe folly of the rejection was quickly apparent. Benton very well said\r\nto Moore, a senator from Alabama who had voted against Van Buren, \"You\r\nhave broken a minister and elected a vice-president. The people will see\r\nnothing in it but a combination of rivals against a competitor.\" The\r\npopular verdict was promptly given. Van Buren had already become a\r\ncandidate to succeed Jackson five years later; he was only a possible\r\ncandidate for vice-president at the next election. When the rejection\r\nwas widely known, it was known almost equally well and soon that Van\r\nBuren would be the Jacksonian candidate for vice-president. Meetings\r\nwere held; addresses were voted; the issue was eagerly seized. The\r\nDemocratic members of the New York legislature early in February, 1832,\r\nunder an inspiration from Washington, addressed to Jackson an expression\r\nof their indignation in the stately words which our fathers loved, even\r\nwhen they went dangerously near to bathos. They had freely, they said,\r\nsurrendered to his call their most distinguished fellow-citizen; when\r\nVan Buren had withdrawn from the cabinet they had beheld in Jackson's\r\ncontinual confidence in him irrefragable proof that no combination could\r\nclose Jackson's eyes to the cause of his country; New York would indeed\r\navenge the indignity thus offered to her favorite son; but they would be\r\nunmindful of their duty if they failed to console Jackson with their\r\nsympathy in this degradation of the country he loved so well. On\r\nFebruary 28, Jackson replied with no less dignity and with skill and\r\nforce. He was, he said,--and the whole country believed him,--incapable\r\nof tarnishing the pride or dignity of that country whose glory it had\r\nbeen his object to elevate; Van Buren's instructions to McLane had been\r\nhis instructions; American pretensions which Adams's administration had\r\nadmitted to be untenable had been resigned; if just American claims were\r\nresisted upon the ground of the unjust position taken by his\r\npredecessor, then and then only was McLane to point out that there had\r\nbeen a change in the policy and counsels of the government with the\r\nchange of its officers. Jackson said that he owed it to the late\r\nsecretary of state and to the American people to declare that Van Buren\r\nhad no participation whatever in the occurrences between Calhoun and\r\nhimself; and that there was no ground for imputing to Van Buren advice\r\nto make the removals from office. He had called Van Buren to the state\r\ndepartment not more for his acknowledged talents and public services\r\nthan to meet the general wish and expectation of the Republican party;\r\nhis signal ability and success in office had fully justified the\r\nselection; his own respect for Van Buren's great public and private\r\nworth, and his full confidence in his integrity were undiminished. This\r\nblast from the unquestioned head of the party prodigiously helped the\r\ngeneral movement. The only question was how best to avenge the wrong.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested that Van Buren should return directly and take a seat\r\nin the Senate, which Dudley would willingly surrender to him, and should\r\nthere meet his slanderers face to face. Some thought that he should have\r\na triumphal entry into New York, without an idea of going into the\r\n\"senatorial cock-pit\" unless he were not to receive the vice-presidency.\r\nOthers thought that he should be made governor of New York, an idea\r\nshadowed forth in the Albany address to Jackson. As a candidate for that\r\nplace, he would escape the jealousies of Pennsylvania and perhaps\r\nVirginia, and augment the local strength of the party in New York. To\r\nthis it was replied from Washington that they might better cut his\r\nthroat at once; that if the Republican party could not, under existing\r\ncircumstances, make Van Buren vice-president, they need never look to\r\nthe presidency for him. This was declared to be the unanimous opinion of\r\nthe cabinet. New York Republicans were begged not to \"lose so glorious\r\nan opportunity of strengthening and consolidating the party.\" The people\r\nat Albany, it was said, were \"mad, ... as if New York can make amends\r\nfor an insult offered by fourteen States of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn this temper the Republican or Democratic convention met at Baltimore\r\non May 21, 1832. It was the first national gathering of the party; and\r\nwas summoned simply to nominate a vice-president. Jackson's renomination\r\nwas already made by the sovereign people, which might be justly\r\naffronted by the assembling of a body in apparent doubt whether to obey\r\nthe popular decree. National conventions were inevitable upon the\r\nfailure of the congressional caucus in 1824. The system of separate\r\nnominations in different States at irregular times was too inconvenient,\r\ntoo inconsistent with unity of action and a central survey of the whole\r\nsituation. In 1824 its inconvenience had been obvious enough. In 1828\r\ncircumstances had designated both the candidates with perfect certainty;\r\nand isolated nominations in different parts of the country were then in\r\nno danger of clashing. It has been recently said that the convention of\r\n1832 was assembled to force Van Buren's nomination for vice-president.\r\nBut it is evident from the letter which Parton prints, written by Lewis\r\nto Kendall on May 25, 1831, when the latter was visiting Isaac Hill, the\r\nJacksonian leader in New Hampshire, that the convention was even then\r\nproposed by \"the most judicious\" friends of the administration. It was\r\nsuggested as a plan \"of putting a stop to partial nominations\" and of\r\n\"harmonizing\" the party. Barbour, Dickinson, and McLane were the\r\ncandidates discussed in this letter; Van Buren was not named. He was\r\nabout sailing for England; and although an open candidate for the\r\npresidential succession after Jackson, he was not then a candidate for\r\nthe second office. The ascription of the convention to management in his\r\nbehalf seems purely gratuitous. Upon this early invitation, the New\r\nHampshire Democrats called the convention. One of them opened its\r\nsession by a brief speech alluding to the favor with which the idea of\r\nthe convention had met, \"although opposed by the enemies of the\r\nDemocratic party,\" as the Republican party headed by Jackson was now\r\nperhaps first definitely called. He said that \"the coming together of\r\nrepresentatives of the people from the extremity of the Union would have\r\na tendency to soothe, if not to unite, the jarring interests;\" and that\r\nthe people, after seeing its good effects in conciliating the different\r\nand distant sections of the country, would continue the mode of\r\nnomination. This natural and sensible motive to strengthen and solidify\r\nthe party is ample explanation of the convention, without resorting to\r\nthe rather worn charge brought against so many political movements of\r\nthe time, that they arose from Jackson's dictatorial desire to throttle\r\nthe sentiment of his party. In making nominations the convention\r\nresolved that each State should have as many votes as it would be\r\nentitled to in the electoral college. To assure what was deemed a\r\nreasonable approach to unanimity, two thirds of the whole number of\r\nvotes was required for a choice,--a precedent sad enough to Van Buren\r\ntwelve years later. On the first ballot Van Buren had 208 of the 283\r\nvotes. Virginia, South Carolina, Indiana, and Kentucky, with a few votes\r\nfrom North Carolina, Alabama, and Illinois, were for Philip P. Barbour\r\nof Virginia or Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky. The motion, nowadays\r\nimmediately made, that the nomination be unanimous was not offered; but\r\nafter an adjournment a resolution was adopted that inasmuch as Van Buren\r\nhad received the votes of two thirds of the delegates, the convention\r\nunanimously concur \"in recommending him to the people of the United\r\nStates for their support.\"\r\n\r\nNo platform was adopted. A committee was appointed after the nomination\r\nto draft an address; but after a night's work they reported that,\r\nalthough \"agreeing fully in the principles and sentiments which they\r\nbelieve ought to be embodied in an address of this description, if such\r\nan address were to be made,\" it still seemed better to them that the\r\nconvention recommend the several delegations \"to make such explanations\r\nby address, report, or otherwise to their respective constituents of the\r\nobjects, proceedings, and result of the meeting as they may deem\r\nexpedient.\" This was a franker intimation than those to which we are now\r\nused, that the battle was to be fought in each State upon the issue best\r\nsuited to its local sentiments; and was entitled to quite as much\r\nrespect as meaningless platitudes adopted lest one State or another be\r\noffended at something explicit. Jackson's firm and successful foreign\r\npolicy, his opposition to internal improvements by the federal\r\ngovernment, his strong stand against nullification, his opposition to\r\nthe United States Bank,--for from the battle over the re-charter,\r\nprecipitated by Clay early in 1832 to embarrass Jackson, the latter had\r\nnot shrunk,--and above all Jackson himself, these were the real planks\r\nof the platform. But the party wanted the votes of Pennsylvania\r\nJacksonians who believed in the Bank and of western Jacksonians who\r\nwished federal aid for roads and canals. The great tariff debate was\r\nthen going on in Congress; and the subject seemed full of danger. The\r\nelection was like the usual English canvass on a parliamentary\r\ndissolution. The country was merely asked without specifications: Do you\r\non the whole like Jackson's administration?\r\n\r\nThere is no real ground for the supposition that intrigue or coercion\r\nwas necessary to procure Van Buren's nomination. It was dictated by the\r\nsimplest and plainest political considerations. Calhoun was in\r\nopposition. After Jackson, Van Buren was clearly the most distinguished\r\nand the ablest member of the administration party; he had rendered it\r\nservices of the highest order; he was very popular in the most important\r\nState of New York; he was abroad, suffering from what Irving at the time\r\ntruly called \"a very short-sighted and mean-spirited act of hostility.\"\r\nThe affront had aroused a general feeling which would enable Van Buren\r\nto strengthen the ticket. In his department had been performed the most\r\nshining achievements of the administration. To the politicians about\r\nJackson, and very shrewd men they were, Van Buren's succession to\r\nJackson promised a firmer, abler continuance of the administration than\r\nthat of any other public man. Could he indeed have stayed minister to\r\nEngland, he would have continued a figure of the first distinction, free\r\nfrom local and temporary animosities and embarrassments. From that post\r\nhe might perhaps, as did a later Democratic statesman, most easily have\r\nascended to the presidency; the vice-presidency would have been\r\nunnecessary to the final promotion. But after the tremendous affront\r\ndealt him by Calhoun and Clay, his tame return to private life would\r\nseem fatal. He must reënter public life. And no reëntry, it was plain,\r\ncould be so striking as a popular election to the second station in the\r\nland, nominal though it was, and in taking it to displace the very enemy\r\nwho had been finally responsible for the wrong done him.\r\n\r\nA month after his return Van Buren formally accepted the nomination. The\r\ncommittee of the convention had assured him that if the great Republican\r\nparty continued faithful to its principles, there was every reason to\r\ncongratulate him and their illustrious president that there was in\r\nreserve for his wounded feelings a just and certain reparation. Van\r\nBuren said in reply that previous to his departure from the United\r\nStates his name had been frequently mentioned for the vice-presidency;\r\nbut that he had uniformly declared himself altogether unwilling to be\r\nconsidered a candidate, and that to his friends, when opportunity\r\noffered, he had given the grounds of his unwillingness. All this was\r\nstrictly true. He had become a candidate for the presidential\r\nsuccession; and honorable absence as minister to England secured a\r\nbetter preparation than presence as vice-president amidst the\r\ndifficulties and suspicions of Washington. But his position, he added,\r\nhad since that period been essentially changed by the circumstance to\r\nwhich the committee had referred, and to which, with some excess of\r\nmodesty he said, rather than to any superior fitness on his part, he was\r\nbound to ascribe his nomination. He gratefully received this spontaneous\r\nexpression of confidence and friendship from the delegated democracy of\r\nthe Union. He declared it to be fortunate for the country that its\r\npublic affairs were under the direction of one who had an early and\r\ninflexible devotion to republican principles and a moral courage which\r\ndistinguished him from all others. In the conviction, he said, that on a\r\nfaithful adherence to these principles depended the stability and value\r\nof our confederated system, he humbly hoped lay his motive, rather than\r\nany other, for accepting the nomination. This rather clumsy affectation\r\nof humility would have been more disagreeable had it not been closely\r\nassociated with firm and manly expressions, and because it was so\r\ncommon a formality in the political vernacular of the day. In treating\r\nthe people as the sovereign, there were adopted the sort of rhetorical\r\nextravagances used by attendants upon monarchs.\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 1832, Van Buren, upon an interrogation by a committee of a\r\nmeeting at Shocco Springs, North Carolina, wrote a letter upon the\r\ntariff. He said that he believed \"the establishment of commercial\r\nregulations with a view to the encouragement of domestic products to be\r\nwithin the constitutional power of Congress.\" But as to what should be\r\nthe character of the tariff he indulged in the generalities of a man who\r\nhas opinions which he does not think it wise or timely to exhibit. He\r\ndid not wish to see the power of Congress exercised with \"oppressive\r\ninequality\" or \"for the advantage of one section of the Union at the\r\nexpense of another.\" The approaching extinguishment of the national debt\r\npresented an opportunity for a \"more equitable adjustment of the\r\ntariff,\" an opportunity already embraced in the tariff of 1832, whose\r\nspirit as \"a conciliatory measure\" he trusted would be cherished by all\r\nwho preferred public to private interests. These vague expressions would\r\nhave fitted either a revenue reformer or an extreme protectionist. Both\r\ndisbelieved, or said they did, in oppression and inequality. With a bit\r\nof irony, perhaps unconscious, he added that he had been thus \"explicit\"\r\nin the statement of his sentiments that there might not be room for\r\nmisapprehension of his views. He did, however, in the letter approve \"a\r\nreduction of the revenue to the wants of the government,\" and \"a\r\npreference in encouragement given to such manufactures as are essential\r\nto the national defense, and its extension to others in proportion as\r\nthey are adapted to our country and of which the raw material is\r\nproduced by ourselves.\" The last phrase probably hinted at Van Buren's\r\nposition. He believed in strictly limiting protective duties, although\r\nhe had voted for the tariff of 1828. But he told Benton that he cast\r\nthis vote in obedience to the \"_demos krateo_\" principle, that is,\r\nbecause his State required it. He again spoke strongly against the\r\npolicy of internal improvements, and the \"scrambles and combinations in\r\nCongress\" unavoidably resulting from them. He was \"unreservedly opposed\"\r\nto a renewal of the charter of the Bank, and equally opposed to\r\nnullification, which involved, he believed, the \"certain destruction of\r\nthe confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later he wrote to a committee of \"democratic-republican young\r\nmen\" in New York of the peculiar hatred and contumely visited upon him.\r\nInvectives against other men, he said, were at times suspended; but he\r\nhad never enjoyed a moment's respite since his first entrance into\r\npublic life. Many distinguished public men had, he added, been seriously\r\ninjured by favors from the press; but there was scarcely an instance in\r\nwhich the objects of its obloquy had not been raised in public\r\nestimation in exact proportion to the intensity and duration of the\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\nBoth the letter from the Baltimore convention and Van Buren's reply\r\nalluded to \"diversity of sentiments and interests,\" disagreements \"as to\r\nmeasures and men\" among the Republicans. The secession of Calhoun and\r\nthe bitter hostility of his friends seriously weakened the party. But\r\nagainst this was to be set the Anti-Masonic movement which drew far more\r\nlargely from Jackson's opponents than from his supporters, for Jackson\r\nwas a Mason of a high degree. This strange agitation had now spread\r\nbeyond New York, and secured the support of really able men. Judge\r\nMcLean of the Supreme Court desired the Anti-Masonic nomination; William\r\nWirt, the famous and accomplished Virginian, accepted it. John Quincy\r\nAdams would probably have accepted it, had it been tendered him. He\r\nwrote in his diary: \"The dissolution of the Masonic institution in the\r\nUnited States I believe to be really more important to us and our\r\nposterity than the question whether Mr. Clay or General Jackson shall be\r\nthe president.\" In New York the National Republicans or Whigs, with the\r\neager and silly leaning of minority parties to political absurdities or\r\nvagaries, united with the Anti-Masons, among whom William H. Seward and\r\nThurlow Weed had become influential. In 1830 they had supported Francis\r\nGranger, the Anti-Masonic candidate for governor. In 1832 the\r\nAnti-Masons in New York nominated an electoral ticket headed by\r\nChancellor Kent, whose bitter, narrow, and unintelligent politics were\r\nin singular contrast with his extraordinary legal equipment and his\r\nprofessional and literary accomplishments, and by John C. Spencer,\r\nlately in charge of the prosecution of Morgan's abductors. If the ticket\r\nwere successful, its votes were to go to Wirt or Clay, whichever they\r\nmight serve to elect. Amos Ellmaker of Pennsylvania was the Anti-Masonic\r\ncandidate for vice-president. In December, 1831, Clay had been nominated\r\nfor president with the loud enthusiasm which politicians often mistake\r\nfor widespread conviction. John Sergeant of Pennsylvania was the\r\ncandidate for vice-president. The Whig Convention made the Bank\r\nre-charter the issue. The very ably conducted Young Men's National\r\nRepublican Convention, held at Washington in May, 1832, gave Clay a\r\nnoble greeting, made pilgrimage to the tomb of Washington there to seal\r\ntheir solemn promises, and adopted a clear and brief platform for\r\nprotection, for internal improvements by the federal government, for the\r\nbinding force upon the coördinate branches of the government of the\r\nSupreme Court's opinions as to constitutional questions, not only in\r\nspecial cases formally adjudged, but upon general principles, and\r\nagainst the manner in which the West Indian trade had been recovered.\r\nThey declared that \"indiscriminate removal of public officers for a mere\r\ndifference of political opinion is a gross abuse of power, corrupting\r\nthe morals and dangerous to the liberties of the people of this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nEven more clearly than in the campaign of 1828 was the campaign of 1832\r\na legitimate political battle upon plain issues. The tariff bill of\r\n1832, supported by both parties and approved by Jackson, prevented the\r\nquestion of protection from being an issue, however ready the Whigs\r\nmight be, and however unready the Democrats, to give commercial\r\nrestrictions a theoretical approval. Except on the \"spoils\" question,\r\nthe later opinion of the United States has sustained the attitude of\r\nJackson's party and the popular verdict of 1832. The verdict was clear\r\nenough. In spite of the Anti-Masonic fury, the numerous secessions from\r\nthe Jacksonian ranks, and some alarming journalistic defections,\r\nespecially of the New York \"Courier and Enquirer\" of James Watson Webb\r\nand Mordecai M. Noah, the people of the United States continued to\r\nbelieve in Jackson and the principles for which he stood. Upon the\r\npopular vote Jackson and Van Buren received 687,502 votes against\r\n530,189 votes for Clay and Wirt combined, a popular majority over both\r\nof 157,313. In 1828 Jackson had had 647,276 votes and Adams 508,064, a\r\npopular majority of 139,212. The increase in Jackson's popular majority\r\nover two candidates instead of one was particularly significant in the\r\nnorth and east. The majority in New York rose from 5350 to 13,601. In\r\nMaine a minority of 6806 became a majority of 6087. In New Hampshire a\r\nminority of 3212 became a majority of 6476. In Massachusetts a minority\r\nof 23,860 was reduced to 18,458. In Rhode Island and Connecticut the\r\nminorities were reduced. In New Jersey a minority of 1813 became a\r\nmajority of 463. The electoral vote was even more heavily against Clay.\r\nHe had but 49 votes to Jackson's 219. Wirt had the 7 votes of Vermont,\r\nwhile South Carolina, beginning to step out of the Union, gave its 11\r\nvotes to John Floyd of Virginia. Clay carried only Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, Delaware, a part of Maryland, and his own\r\naffectionate Kentucky. Van Buren received for vice-president the same\r\nelectoral vote as Jackson, except that the 30 votes of Pennsylvania went\r\nto Wilkins, a Pennsylvanian. Sergeant had the same 49 votes as Clay,\r\nEllmaker the 7 votes of Vermont, and Henry Lee of Massachusetts the 11\r\nvotes of South Carolina.[11]\r\n\r\nThis popular triumph brought great glory to Jackson's second\r\ninauguration. The glory was soon afterwards made greater and almost\r\nuniversal by his bold attack upon nullification, and by the vigorous and\r\nringing yet dignified and even pathetic proclamation of January, 1833,\r\ndrafted by Edward Livingston, in which the President commanded\r\nobedience to the law and entreated for loyalty to the Union. It could\r\nnot be overlooked that the treasonable attitude of South Carolina had\r\nbeen taken by the portion of the Democratic party hostile to Van Buren.\r\nIn a peculiar way therefore he shared in Jackson's prestige.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edward Livingston]\r\n\r\nThe election seemed to clarify some of the views of the administration.\r\nThey now dared to speak more explicitly. On his way to the inauguration,\r\nVan Buren, declining a dinner at Philadelphia, recited with approval\r\nwhat he called Jackson's repeated and earnest recommendations of \"a\r\nreduction of duties to the revenue standard.\" In his second inaugural\r\nJackson said that there should be exercised \"by the general government\r\nthose powers only that are clearly delegated.\" In his message of\r\nDecember, 1833, he again spoke of \"the importance of abstaining from all\r\nappropriations which are not absolutely required for the public\r\ninterests, and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to the United\r\nStates;\" and this he said with the more emphasis because under the\r\ncompromise tariff of 1833 a large decrease in revenue was anticipated.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1833, was announced Jackson's refusal longer to deposit\r\nthe moneys of the government with the Bank of the United States. It is\r\nplain that the dangers of the proposed deposits of the moneys in the\r\nstate banks were not appreciated. Van Buren at first opposed this\r\nso-called \"removal of the deposits.\" Kendall tells of an interview with\r\nthe Vice-President not long after his inauguration, and while he was a\r\nguest at the White House. Van Buren then warmly remonstrated against the\r\ncontinued agitation of the subject, after the resolution of the lower\r\nHouse at the last session that the government deposits were safe with\r\nthe banks. Kendall replied that so certain to his mind was the success\r\nof the Whig party at the next presidential election and the consequent\r\nre-charter of the Bank, unless it were now stripped of the power which\r\nthe charge of the public moneys gave it, that if the Bank were to retain\r\nthe deposits he should consider further opposition useless and would lay\r\ndown his pen, leaving to others this question and all other politics. \"I\r\ncan live,\" he said to the Vice-President, \"under a corrupt despotism as\r\nwell as any other man by keeping out of its way, which I shall certainly\r\ndo.\" They parted in excitement. A few weeks later Van Buren confessed to\r\nKendall, \"I had never thought seriously upon the deposit question until\r\nafter my conversation with you; I am now satisfied that you were right\r\nand I was wrong.\" Kendall was sent to ascertain whether suitable state\r\nbanks would accept the deposits, and on what terms. While in New York\r\nVan Buren, with McLane lately transferred from the Treasury to the State\r\nDepartment, called on him and proposed that the order for the change in\r\nthe government depositories should take effect on the coming first of\r\nJanuary. The date being a month after the meeting of Congress, the\r\nexecutive action would seem less defiant; and in the mean time the\r\nfriends of the administration could be more effectually united in\r\nsupport of the measure. Kendall yielded to the proposition though\r\nagainst his judgment, and wrote to the President in its favor. But\r\nJackson would not yield. Whether or not its first inspiration came from\r\nFrancis P. Blair or Kendall, the removal of the deposits was peculiarly\r\nJackson's own deed. The government moneys should not be left in the\r\nhands of the chief enemy of his administration, to be loaned in its\r\ndiscretion, that it might secure doubtful votes in Congress and the\r\nsupport of presses pecuniarily weak. As the Bank's charter would expire\r\nwithin three years, it was pointed out that the government ought to\r\nprepare for it by withholding further deposits and gradually drawing out\r\nthe moneys then on deposit. Van Buren's assent was given, but probably\r\nwith no enthusiasm. He disliked the Bank heartily enough. The corrupting\r\ndanger of intrusting government moneys to a single private corporation\r\nto loan in its discretion was clear. But a system of \"pet banks\" through\r\nthe States was too slight an improvement, if an improvement at all. And\r\nany change would at least offend and alarm the richer classes. It is\r\nimpossible to say what effect upon the re-charter of the Bank and the\r\nelection of 1836 its continued possession of the deposits would have\r\nhad. Its tremendous power over credits doubtless gave it many votes of\r\nadministration congressmen. Possibly, as Jackson and Blair feared, it\r\nmight have secured enough to pass a re-charter over a veto. If it had\r\nbeen thus re-chartered, it may be doubtful whether the blow to the\r\nprestige of the administration might not have been serious enough to\r\nelect a Whig in 1836. But it is not doubtful that Van Buren, and not\r\nJackson, was compelled to face the political results of this heroic and\r\nimperfect measure.\r\n\r\nSome financial disturbance took place in the winter of 1833-1834, which\r\nwas ascribed by the Whigs to the gradual transfer of the government\r\nmoneys from the United States Bank and its numerous branches to the\r\nstate banks. For political effect, this disturbance was greatly\r\nexaggerated. Deputations visited Washington to bait Jackson. Memorial\r\nafter memorial enabled congressmen to make friends by complimenting the\r\nenterprise and beauty of various towns, and to depict the utter misery\r\nto which all their industries had been brought, solely by a gradual\r\ntransference throughout the United States of $10,000,000, from one set\r\nof depositories to another. The removal, Webster said, had produced a\r\ndegree of evil that could not be borne. \"A tottering state of credit,\r\ncramped means, loss of property and loss of employment, doubts of the\r\ncondition of others, doubts of their own condition, constant fear of\r\nfailures and new explosions, and awful dread of the future\"--all these\r\nevils, \"without hope of improvement or change,\" had resulted from the\r\nremoval. Clay was more precise in his absurdity. The property of the\r\ncountry had been reduced, he declared, four hundred millions in value.\r\nAddressing Van Buren in the Vice-President's chair, he begged him in a\r\nburst of bathos to repair to the executive mansion and place before the\r\nchief magistrate the naked and undisguised truth. \"Go to him,\" he cried,\r\n\"and tell him without exaggeration, but in the language of truth and\r\nsincerity, the actual condition of this bleeding country, ... of the\r\ntears of helpless widows no longer able to earn their bread, and of\r\nunclad and unfed orphans.\" Van Buren, in the story often quoted from\r\nBenton, while thus apostrophized, looked respectfully and innocently at\r\nClay, as if treasuring up every word to be faithfully borne to the\r\nPresident; and when Clay had finished, he called a senator to the chair,\r\nwent up to the eloquent and languishing Kentuckian, asked him for a\r\npinch of his fine maccoboy snuff, and walked away. But this frivolity\r\nwas not fancied everywhere. At a meeting in Philadelphia it was resolved\r\n\"that Martin Van Buren deserves and will receive the execrations of all\r\ngood men, should he shrink from the responsibility of conveying to\r\nAndrew Jackson the message sent by the Honorable Henry Clay.\" The whole\r\nagitation was hollow enough. Jackson was not far wrong in saying in his\r\nletter to Hamilton of January 2, 1834: \"There is no real general\r\ndistress. It is only with those who live by borrowing, trade or loans,\r\nand the gamblers in stocks.\" The business of the country was not\r\ninjured by refusing to let Nicholas Biddle and his subordinates, rather\r\nthan other men, lend for gain ten millions of government money. But\r\nbusiness was soon to be injured by permitting the state banks to do the\r\nsame thing. The change did not, as Jackson thought, \"leave all to trade\r\non their own credit and capital without any interference by the general\r\ngovernment except using its powers by giving through its mint a specie\r\ncurrency.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren took a permanent residence in Washington after his\r\ninauguration as vice-president. He now held a rank accorded to no other\r\nvice-president before or since. He was openly adopted by the American\r\nAugustus, and seemed already to wear the title of Cæsar. As no other\r\nvice-president has been, he was the chief adviser of the President, and\r\nas much the second officer of the government in power as in the dignity\r\nof his station. His only chance of promotion did not lie in the\r\nPresident's death. That the President should live until after the\r\nelection of 1836 was safely over, Van Buren had every selfish motive as\r\nwell as many generous motives to desire. His ambition was no-wise\r\ndisagreeable to his chief. To see that ambition satisfied would gratify\r\nboth patriotic and personal wishes of the tempestuous but not erratic\r\nold man in the White House. For there was the utmost intimacy and\r\nconfidence between the two men. Van Buren had every reason, personal,\r\npolitical, and patriotic, to desire the entire success of the\r\nadministration. He was not only the second member of it; but in his\r\njealous and anxious watch over it he was preserving his own patrimony.\r\nHis ability and experience were far greater than those of any other\r\nof its members. After Taney had been transferred from the\r\nattorney-general's office to the Treasury, in September, 1833, to make\r\nthe transfer of the deposits, Jackson appointed Benjamin F. Butler, Van\r\nBuren's intimate friend, his former pupil and partner, to Taney's place.\r\nLouis McLane, Van Buren's predecessor in the mission to England, and his\r\nsuccessor, after Edward Livingston, in the State Department, resigned\r\nthe latter office in the summer of 1834. He had disapproved Jackson's\r\nremoval of the deposits; he believed it would be unpopular, and the\r\npresidential bee was buzzing in his bonnet. John Forsyth of Georgia, an\r\nadmirer of Van Buren, and one of his defenders in the senatorial debate\r\nat the time of his rejection, then took the first place in the cabinet.\r\nVan Buren accompanied Jackson during part of the latter's visit to the\r\nNortheast in the summer of 1833, when as the adversary of nullification\r\nhis popularity was at its highest, so high indeed that Harvard College,\r\nto Adams's disgust, made him a Doctor of Laws. But the exciting events\r\nof Jackson's second term hardly belong, with the information we yet\r\nhave, to Van Buren's biography. They have been often and admirably told\r\nin the lives of Jackson and Clay, the seeming chiefs on the two sides of\r\nthe long encounter.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's nomination for the presidency, bitter as the opposition to\r\nit still was, came as matter of course. The large and serious secession\r\nof Calhoun and his followers from the Jacksonian party was followed by\r\nthe later and more serious defection of the Democrats who made a rival\r\nDemocratic candidate of Hugh L. White, a senator from Tennessee, and\r\nformerly a warm friend and adherent of Jackson. It was in White's behalf\r\nthat Davy Crockett wrote, in 1835, his entertaining though scurrilous\r\nlife of Van Buren. Jackson's friendship for Van Buren, Crockett said,\r\nhad arisen from his hatred to Calhoun, of which Van Buren, who was\r\n\"secret, sly, selfish, cold, calculating, distrustful, treacherous,\" had\r\ntaken advantage. Jackson was now about to give up \"an old, long-tried,\r\nfaithful friend, Judge White, who stuck to him through all his\r\ntribulations, helped to raise his fortunes from the beginning;\r\nadventurers together in a new country, friends in youth and in old age,\r\nfought together in the same battles, risked the same dangers, starved\r\ntogether in the same deserts, merely to gratify this revengeful\r\nfeeling.\" Van Buren was \"as opposite to General Jackson as dung is to a\r\ndiamond.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find any justification for White's candidacy. He was\r\na modest, dignified senator whose popularity in the Democratic Southwest\r\nrendered him available to Van Buren's enemies. But neither his abilities\r\nnor his services to the public or his party would have suggested him\r\nfor the presidency. Doubtless in him as with other modest, dignified\r\nmen in history, there burned ambition whose fire never burst into flame,\r\nand which perhaps for its suppression was the more troublesome. He\r\nconsented, apparently only for personal reasons, to head the Southern\r\nschism from Jackson and Van Buren; and in his political destruction he\r\npaid the penalty usually and justly visited upon statesmen who, through\r\npersonal hatred or jealousy or ambition, break party ties without a real\r\ndifference of principle. Benton said that White consented to run\r\n\"because in his advanced age he did the act which, with all old men, is\r\nan experiment, and with most of them an unlucky one. He married again;\r\nand this new wife having made an immense stride from the head of a\r\nboarding-house table to the head of a senator's table, could see no\r\nreason why she should not take one step more, and that comparatively\r\nshort, and arrive at the head of the presidential table.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic-Republican Convention met at Baltimore on May 20, 1835,\r\nnearly eighteen months before the election. There were over five hundred\r\ndelegates from twenty-three States. South Carolina, Alabama, and\r\nIllinois were not represented. Party organization was still very\r\nimperfect. The modern system of precise and proportional representations\r\nwas not yet known. The States which approved the convention sent\r\ndelegates in such number as suited their convenience. Maryland, the\r\nconvention being held in its chief city, sent 183 delegates; Virginia,\r\nclose at hand, sent 102; New York, although the home of the proposed\r\ncandidate, sent but 42, the precise number of its electoral votes.\r\nTennessee sent but one; Mississippi and Missouri, only two each. In\r\nmaking the nominations, the delegates from each State, however numerous\r\nor few, cast a number of votes equal to its representation in the\r\nelectoral college. The 183 delegates from Maryland cast therefore but\r\nten votes; while the single delegate from Tennessee, much courted man\r\nthat he must have been, cast 15.\r\n\r\nIt was the second national convention of the party. The members\r\nassembled at the \"place of worship of the Fourth Presbyterian Church.\"\r\nInstead of the firm and now long-recognized opening by the chairman of\r\nthe national committee provided by the well-geared machinery of our\r\nlater politics, George Kremer of Pennsylvania first \"stated the objects\r\nof the meeting.\" Andrew Stevenson of Virginia, the president, felt it\r\nnecessary in his opening speech to defend the still novel party\r\ninstitution. Efforts, he said, would be made at the approaching election\r\nto divide the Republican party and possibly to defeat an election by the\r\npeople in their primary colleges. Their venerable president had advised,\r\nbut in vain, constitutional amendments securing this election to the\r\npeople, and preventing its falling to the House of Representatives. A\r\nnational convention was the best means of concentrating the popular\r\nwill, the only defense against a minority party. It was recommended by\r\nprudence, sanctioned by the precedent of 1832, and had proved effectual\r\nby experience. They must guard against local jealousies. \"What,\r\ngentlemen,\" he said, \"would you think of the sagacity and prudence of\r\nthat individual who would propose the expedient of cutting up the noble\r\nship that each man might seize his own plank and steer for himself?\" The\r\ninquiries must be: Who can best preserve the unity of the Democratic\r\nparty? Who best understands the principles and motives of our\r\ngovernment? Who will carry out the principles of the Jeffersonian era\r\nand General Jackson's administration? These demands clearly enough\r\npointed out Van Buren. Prayers were then offered up \"in a fervent,\r\nfeeling manner.\" The rule requiring two thirds of the whole number of\r\nvotes for a nomination was again adopted, because \"it would have a more\r\nimposing effect,\" though nearly half the convention, 210 to 231, thought\r\na majority was more \"according to Democratic principles.\" Niles records\r\nthat the formal motion to proceed to the nomination caused a smile among\r\nthe members, so well settled was it that Van Buren was to be the\r\nnominee. He received the unanimous vote of the convention. A strong\r\nfight was made for the vice-presidency between the friends of Richard M.\r\nJohnson of Kentucky and William C. Rives of Virginia. The former\r\nreceived barely the two-thirds vote. The Virginia delegation upon the\r\ndefeat of the latter did what would now be a sacrilegious laying of\r\nviolent hands on the ark. Party regularity was not yet so chief a deity\r\nin the political temple. The Virginians had, they said, an unpleasant\r\nduty to perform; but they would not shrink from it. They would not\r\nsupport Johnson for the vice-presidency; they had no confidence in his\r\nprinciples or his character; they had come to the convention to support\r\nprinciples, not men; they had already gone as far as possible in\r\nsupporting Mr. Van Buren, and they would not go further. Not long\r\nafterwards Rives left the party. No platform was adopted; but a\r\ncommittee was appointed to prepare an address to the people.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs nominated General William Henry Harrison for the presidency\r\nand Francis Granger for the vice-presidency. They had but a forlorn hope\r\nof direct success. But the secession from the Democratic party of the\r\nnullifiers, and the more serious secession in the Southwest headed by\r\nWhite, made it seem possible to throw the election into the House. John\r\nTyler of Virginia was the nominee of the bolting Democrats, for\r\nvice-president upon the ticket with White. The Whigs of Massachusetts\r\npreferred their unequaled orator; for they then and afterwards failed to\r\nsee, as the admirers of some other famous Americans have failed to see,\r\nthat other qualities make a truer equipment for the first office of the\r\nland than this noble art of oratory. South Carolina would vote against\r\nCalhoun's victorious adversary; but she would not, in the first instance\r\nat least, vote with the Whig heretics.\r\n\r\nIt was a disorderly campaign, lasting a year and a half, and never\r\nreaching the supreme excitement of 1840 or 1844. The opposition did not\r\ndeserve success. It had neither political principle nor discipline.\r\nCalhoun described the Van Buren men as \"a powerful faction (party it\r\ncannot be called) held together by the hopes of public plunder and\r\nmarching under a banner whereon is written 'to the victors belong the\r\nspoils.'\" There was in the rhetorical exaggeration enough truth perhaps\r\nto make an issue. But the political removals under Jackson were only\r\nincidentally touched in the canvass. Amos Kendall, then\r\npostmaster-general, towards the close of the canvass wrote a letter\r\nwhich, coming from perhaps the worst of Jackson's \"spoils-men,\" shows\r\nhow far public sentiment was even then from justifying the political\r\ninterference of federal officers in elections. Samuel McKean, senator\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, had written to Kendall complaining that three\r\nemployees of the post-office had used the time and influence of their\r\nofficial stations to affect elections, by written communications and\r\npersonal importunities. This, he said, was \"a loathsome public\r\nnuisance,\" though admitting that since Kendall became postmaster-general\r\nhe had given no cause of complaint. Kendall replied on September 27,\r\n1836, that though it was difficult to draw the line between the rights\r\nof the citizen and the assumptions of the officeholder, he thought it\r\ndangerous to our institutions that government employees should \"assume\r\nto direct public opinion and control the results of elections in the\r\ngeneral or state government.\" His advice to members of his department\r\nwas to keep as clear from political strife as possible, \"to shun mere\r\npolitical meetings, or, if present, to avoid taking any part in their\r\nproceedings, to decline acting as members of political committees or\r\nconventions.\" In making appointments he would prefer political friends;\r\nbut he \"would not remove a good postmaster and honest man for a mere\r\ndifference of political opinion.\" The complaints were for offenses\r\ncommitted under his predecessor; one of the three offenders had left the\r\nservice; the other two had been free from criticism for seventeen\r\nmonths. There can be little doubt that the standard thus set up in\r\npublic was higher than the general practice of Kendall or his\r\nsubordinates; but the letter showed that public sentiment had not yet\r\ngrown callous to this odious abuse.\r\n\r\nJackson did not permit the presidential office to restrain him from most\r\nvigorous and direct advocacy of Van Buren's claims. He begged Tennessee\r\nnot to throw herself \"into the embraces of the Federalists, the\r\nNullifiers, or the new-born Whigs.\" They were living, he said, in evil\r\ntimes, when political apostasy had become frequent, when public men\r\n(referring to White, John Tyler, and others who had gone with them) were\r\nabandoning principle and their party attachment for selfish ends. To\r\nthis it was replied that the president's memory was treacherous; that he\r\nhad forgotten his early friends, and listened only \"to the voice of\r\nflattery and the siren voice of sycophancy.\" The dissenting Republicans\r\naffected to support administration measures, but protested against\r\nJackson's dictating the succession. They were then, they said, \"what\r\nthey were in 1828,--Jacksonians following the creed of that apostle of\r\nliberty, Thomas Jefferson.\"\r\n\r\nWithout principle as was this formidable secession, it is impossible to\r\nfeel much more respect for the declaration of principles made for the\r\nWhig candidates. Clay, the chief spokesman, complained that Jackson had\r\nkilled with the pocket veto the land bill, which proposed to distribute\r\nthe proceeds of the sales of public lands among the States according to\r\ntheir federal population (which in the South included three fifths of\r\nthe slaves), to be used for internal improvements, education, or other\r\npurposes. He pointed out, with \"mixed feelings of pity and ridicule,\"\r\nthat the few votes in the Senate against the \"deposit bill,\" which was\r\nto distribute the surplus among the States, had been cast by\r\nadministration senators, since deserted by their numerous followers who\r\ndemanded distribution. He rejoiced that Kentucky was to get a million\r\nand a half from the federal treasury. He denounced Jackson's \"tampering\r\nwith the currency\" by the treasury order requiring public lands to be\r\npaid for in specie and not in bank-notes. Jackson's treatment of the\r\nCherokees seemed the only point of attack apart from his financial\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe real party platforms this year were curiously found in letters of\r\nthe candidates to Sherrod Williams, an individual by no means\r\ndistinguished. On April 7, 1836, he addressed a circular letter to\r\nHarrison, Van Buren, and White, asking each of them his opinions on five\r\npoints: Did he approve a distribution of the surplus revenue among the\r\nStates according to their federal population, for such uses as they\r\nmight appoint? Did he approve a like distribution of the proceeds of the\r\nsales of public lands? Did he approve federal appropriations to improve\r\nnavigable streams above ports of entry? Did he approve another bank\r\ncharter, if it should become necessary to preserve the revenue and\r\nfinances of the nation? Did he believe it constitutional to expunge from\r\nthe records of a house of Congress any of its proceedings? The last\r\nquestion referred to Benton's agitation for a resolution expunging from\r\nthe records of the Senate the resolution of 1834, condemning Jackson's\r\nremoval of the deposits as a violation of the Constitution. Harrison,\r\nfor whose benefit the questions were put, returned what was supposed to\r\nbe the popular affirmative to the first three inquiries. The fourth he\r\nanswered in the affirmative, and the fifth in the negative. Van Buren\r\npromptly pointed out to Williams that he doubted the right of an\r\nelector, who had already determined to oppose him, to put inquiries\r\n\"with the sole view of exposing, at his own time and the mode he may\r\nselect, the opinions of the candidate to unfriendly criticism,\" but\r\nnevertheless promised a reply after Congress had risen. This delay he\r\ndeemed proper, because during the session he might, as president of the\r\nSenate, have to vote upon some of the questions. Williams replied that\r\nthe excuse for delay was \"wholly and entirely unsatisfactory.\" Van Buren\r\ncurtly said that he should wait as he had stated. On August 8, not far\r\nfrom the time nowadays selected by presidential candidates for their\r\nletters of acceptance, Van Buren addressed a letter to Williams, the\r\nprolixity of which seems a fault, but which, when newspapers were fewer\r\nand shorter, and reading was less multifarious, secured perhaps, from\r\nits length, a more ample and deliberate study from the masses of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFor clearness and explicitness, and for cogency of argument, this letter\r\nhas few equals among those written by presidential candidates. This most\r\nconspicuous of Van Buren's preëlection utterances has been curiously\r\nignored by those who have accused him of \"non-committalism.\" Congress,\r\nhe said, does not possess the power under the Constitution to raise\r\nmoney for distribution among the States. If a distinction were\r\njustifiable, and of this he was not satisfied, between raising money for\r\nsuch a purpose and the distribution of an unexpected surplus, then the\r\ndistribution ought not to be attempted without previous amendment of the\r\nConstitution. Any system of distribution must introduce vices into both\r\nthe state and federal governments. It would be a great misfortune if the\r\ndistribution bill already passed should be deemed a pledge of like\r\nlegislation in the future. So much of the letter has since largely had\r\nthe approval of American sentiment, and was only too soon emphasized by\r\nthe miserable results of the bill thus condemned. The utterance was\r\nclear and wise; and it was far more. It was a singularly bold attitude\r\nto assume, not only against the views of the opposition, but against a\r\nmeasure passed by Van Buren's own party friends and signed by Jackson, a\r\nmeasure having a vast and cheap popularity throughout the States which\r\nwere supposed, and with too much truth, not to see that for what they\r\ntook out of the federal treasury they would simply have to put so much\r\nmore in. \"I hope and believe,\" said Van Buren, \"that the public voice\r\nwill demand that this species of legislation shall terminate with the\r\nemergency that produced it.\" To the inquiry whether he would approve a\r\ndistribution among the States of the proceeds of selling the public\r\nlands, Van Buren plainly said that if he were elected he would not favor\r\nthe policy. These moneys, he declared, should be applied \"to the general\r\nwants of the treasury.\" To the inquiry whether he would approve\r\nappropriations to improve rivers above ports of entry, he quoted with\r\napproval Jackson's declaration in the negative. He would not go beyond\r\nexpenditures for lighthouses, buoys, beacons, piers, and the removal of\r\nobstructions in rivers and harbors below such ports.\r\n\r\nUpon the bank question, too, he left his interrogator in no doubt. If\r\nthe people wished a national bank as a permanent branch of their\r\ninstitutions, or if they desired a chief magistrate who as to that would\r\nconsider it his duty to watch the course of events and give or withhold\r\nhis assent according to the supposed necessity, then another than\r\nhimself must be chosen. And he added: \"If, on the other hand, with this\r\nseasonable, explicit, and published avowal before them, a majority of\r\nthe people of the United States shall nevertheless bestow upon me their\r\nsuffrages for the office of president, skepticism itself must cease to\r\ndoubt, and admit their will to be that there shall not be any Bank of\r\nthe United States until the people, in the exercise of their sovereign\r\nauthority, see fit to give to Congress the right to establish one.\" It\r\nwas high time \"that the federal government confine itself to the\r\ncreation of coin, and that the States afford it a fair chance for\r\ncirculation.\" With the power of either house of Congress to expunge from\r\nits records, he pointed out that the President could have no concern.\r\nBut rather than avoid an answer, he said that he regarded the passage of\r\nColonel Benton's resolution as \"an act of justice to a faithful and\r\ngreatly injured public servant, not only constitutional in itself, but\r\nimperiously demanded by a proper respect for the well-known will of the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThis justly famous letter made up for the rather jejune and conventional\r\nletter of acceptance written a year before. Not concealing his\r\nsensitiveness to the charge of intrigue and management, Van Buren had\r\nthen appealed to the members of the Democratic convention, to the\r\n\"editors and politicians throughout the Union\" who had preferred him, to\r\nhis \"private correspondents and intimate friends,\" and to those, once\r\nhis \"friends and associates, whom the fluctuations of political life\"\r\nhad \"converted into opponents.\" No man, he declared, could truly say\r\nthat he had solicited political support, or entered or sought to enter\r\ninto any arrangement to procure him the nomination he had now received,\r\nor to elevate him to the chief magistracy. There was no public question\r\nof interest upon which his opinions had not been made known by his\r\nofficial acts, his own public avowals, and the authorized explanations\r\nof his friends. The last was a touch of the frankness which Van Buren\r\nused in vain to stop his enemies' accusations of indirectness. Instead\r\nof shielding himself, as public men usually and naturally do, behind\r\nButler, the attorney-general, and others who had spoken for him, he\r\ndirectly assumed responsibility for their \"explanations.\" He considered\r\nhimself selected to carry out the principles and policy of Jackson's\r\nadministration, \"happy,\" he said, \"if I shall be able to perfect the\r\nwork which he has so gloriously begun.\" He closed with the theoretical\r\ndeclaration which consistently ran through his chief utterances, that,\r\nthough he would \"exercise the powers which of right belong to the\r\ngeneral government in a spirit of moderation and brotherly love,\" he\r\nwould on the other hand \"religiously abstain from the assumption of such\r\nas have not been delegated by the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nUpon still another question Van Buren explicitly declared himself before\r\nthe election. In 1835, the year of his nomination, appeared the cloud\r\nlike a man's hand which was not to leave the sky until out of it had\r\ncome a terrific, complete, and beneficent convulsion. Then openly and\r\nseriously began the work of the extreme anti-slavery men. Clay pointed\r\nout in his speech on colonization in 1836 that \"this fanatical class\" of\r\nabolitionists \"were none of your old-fashioned gradual emancipationists,\r\nsuch as Franklin, Rush, and the other wise and benevolent Pennsylvanians\r\nwho framed the scheme for the gradual removal of slavery.\" He was right.\r\nMany of the new abolitionists were on the verge, or beyond it, of quiet\r\nrespectability. Educated, intelligent, and even wealthy as some of them\r\nwere, the abolitionists did not belong to the always popular class of\r\nwell-to-do folks content with the institutions of society. Most virtuous\r\nand religious people saw in them only wicked disturbers of the peace.\r\nAll the comfortable, philosophical opponents of slavery believed that\r\nsuch wild and reckless agitators would, if encouraged, prostrate the\r\npillars of civilization, and bring on anarchy, bloodshed, and servile\r\nwars worse even to the slaves than the wrongs of their slavery. But to\r\nthe members of the abolition societies which now rose, this was no\r\nabstract or economical question. They were undaunted by the examples of\r\nWashington and Jefferson and Patrick Henry, who, whatever they said or\r\nhoped against slavery, nevertheless held human beings in bondage; or of\r\nAdams and other Northern adherents of the Constitution, who for a season\r\nat least had joined in a pact to protect the infamous slave traffic. To\r\nthem, talk of the sacred Union, or of the great advance which negroes\r\nhad made in slavery and would not have made in freedom, was idle. With\r\nunquenched vision they saw the horrid picture of the individual slave\r\nlife, not the general features of slavery; they saw the chain, the lash,\r\nthe brutalizing and contrived ignorance; they saw the tearing apart of\r\nfamilies, with their love and hope, precisely like those of white men\r\nand women, crushed out by detestable cruelty; they saw the beastly\r\ndissoluteness inevitable to the plantation system. Nor would they be\r\nstill, whatever the calm preaching of political wisdom, whatever the\r\nsincere and weighty insolence of men of wisdom and uprightness and\r\nproperty. Northern men of 1888 must look with a real shame upon the\r\nbehavior of their fathers and grandfathers towards the narrow, fiery,\r\nsometimes almost hateful, apostles of human rights; and with even\r\ngreater shame upon the talk of the sacred right of white men to make\r\nbrutes of black men, a right to be treated, as the best of Americans\r\nwere so fond of saying, with a tender and affectionate regard for the\r\nfeelings of the white slave-masters. About the same time began the\r\ncontinual presentation to Congress of petitions for the abolition of\r\nslavery, and the foolish but Heaven-ordained attack of slaveholders on\r\nthe right of petition. The agitation rapidly flaming up was far\r\ndifferent from the practical and truly political discussion over the\r\nMissouri Compromise fifteen years before.\r\n\r\nAs yet, indeed, the matter was not politically important, except in the\r\nattack upon Van Buren made by the Southern members of his party. Sixteen\r\nyears before, he had voted against admitting more slave States. He had\r\naided the reëlection of Rufus King, a determined enemy of slavery. He\r\nhad strongly opposed Calhoun and the Southern nullifiers. In the\r\n\"Evening Post\" and the \"Plain-dealer\" of New York appeared from 1835 to\r\n1837 the really noble series of editorials by William Leggett, strongly\r\nproclaiming the right of free discussion and the essential wrong of\r\nslavery; although sometimes he condemned the fanaticism now aroused as\r\n\"a species of insanity.\" The \"Post\" strongly supported Van Buren, and\r\nwas declared at the South to be his chosen organ for addressing the\r\npublic. It denied, however, that Van Buren had any \"connection in any\r\nway or shape with the doctrines or movements of the abolitionists.\" But\r\nsuch denials were widely disbelieved by the slaveholders. It was\r\ndeclared that he had a deep agency in the Missouri question which fixed\r\nupon him a support of abolition; his denials were answered by the\r\nanti-slavery petitions from twenty thousand memorialists in his own\r\nState of New York, and by the support brought him by the enemies of\r\nslavery. To all this the Whig \"dough-faces\" listened with entire\r\nsatisfaction. They must succeed, if at all, through Southern distrust or\r\ndislike of Van Buren. In July, 1834, he had publicly written to Samuel\r\nGwin of Mississippi that his opinions upon the power of Congress over\r\nslave property in the Southern States were so well understood by his\r\nfriends that he was surprised that an attempt should be made to deceive\r\nthe public about them; that slavery was in his judgment \"exclusively\r\nunder the control of the state governments;\" that no \"contrary opinion\r\nto an extent deserving consideration\" was entertained in any part of the\r\nUnited States; and that, without a change of the Constitution, no\r\ninterference with it in a State could be had \"even at the instance of\r\neither or of all the slaveholding States.\" But, it was said, \"Tappan,\r\nGarrison, and every other fanatic and abolitionist in the United States\r\nnot entirely run mad, will grant that.\" And, indeed, Abraham Lincoln was\r\nnominated twenty-four years later upon a like declaration of \"the right\r\nof each State to order and control its own domestic institutions\r\naccording to its own judgment exclusively.\"\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia, however, was one bit of territory in which\r\nCongress doubtless had the power to abolish slavery. In our better days\r\nit would seem to have been a natural enough impulse to seek to make free\r\nsoil at least of the capital of the land of freedom. But the District\r\nlay between and was completely surrounded by two slave States.\r\nWashington had derived its laws and customs from Maryland. If the\r\nDistrict were free while Virginia and Maryland were slave, it was feared\r\nwith much reason that there would arise most dangerous collisions. Its\r\nperpetual slavery was an unforeseen part of the price Alexander Hamilton\r\nhad paid to procure the federal assumption of the war debts of the\r\nStates. In Van Buren's time there was almost complete acquiescence in\r\nthe proposition that, though slavery had in the District no\r\nconstitutional protection, it must still be deemed there a part of the\r\ninstitution in Virginia and Maryland. How clear was the understanding\r\nmay be seen from language of undoubted authority. John Quincy Adams had\r\nhitherto labored for causes which have but cold and formal interest to\r\nposterity. But now, leaving the field of statesmanship, where his glory\r\nhad been meagre, and, fortunately for his reputation, with the shackles\r\nof its responsibility no longer upon him, the generous and exalted love\r\nof humanity began to touch his later years with the abiding splendor of\r\nheroic and far-seeing courage. He became the first of the great\r\nanti-slavery leaders. He entered for all time the group of men,\r\nGarrison, Lovejoy, Giddings, Phillips, Sumner, and Beecher, to whom so\r\nlargely we owe the second and nobler salvation of our land. But Adams\r\nwas emphatically opposed to the abolition of slavery in the District.\r\nIn December, 1831, the first month of his service in the House, on\r\npresenting a petition for such abolition, he declared that he should not\r\nsupport it. In February, 1837, a few days before Van Buren's\r\ninauguration, there occurred the scene when Adams, with grim and\r\ndauntless irony, brought to the House the petition of some slaves\r\nagainst abolition. In his speech then he said: \"From the day I entered\r\nthis House down to the present moment, I have invariably here, and\r\ninvariably elsewhere, declared my opinions to be adverse to the prayer\r\nof petitions which call for the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a curious but inevitable impeachment of the impartiality of\r\nhistory that for a declaration precisely the same as that made by a\r\ngreat and recognized apostle of anti-slavery, and made by that apostle\r\nin a later year, Van Buren has been denounced as a truckler to the\r\nSouth, a \"Northern man with Southern principles.\" Van Buren's\r\ndeclaration was made, not like Adams's in the easy freedom of an\r\nindependent member of Congress from an anti-slavery district, but under\r\nthe constraint of a presidential nomination partially coming from the\r\nSouth. In the canvass before his election, Van Buren gave perfectly fair\r\nnotice of his intention. \"I must go,\" he said, \"into the presidential\r\nchair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the\r\npart of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia against\r\nthe wishes of the slaveholding States.\" This was the attitude, not only\r\nof Van Buren and Adams, but of every statesman North and South, and of\r\nthe entire North itself with insignificant exceptions. The former's\r\nexplicit declaration was doubtless aimed at the pro-slavery jealousy\r\nstirred up against himself in the South; it was intended to have\r\npolitical effect. But it was none the less the unambiguous expression of\r\nan opinion sincerely shared with the practically unanimous sense of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nA skillful effort was made to embarrass Van Buren with his Southern\r\nsupporters over a more difficult question. The anti-slavery societies at\r\nthe North sought to circulate their literature at the South. So strong\r\nan enemy of slavery as William Leggett condemned this as \"fanatical\r\nobstinacy,\" obviously tending to stir up at the South insurrections,\r\nwhose end no one could foresee, and as the fruit of desperation and\r\nextravagance. The Southern States by severe laws forbade the circulation\r\nof the literature. Its receipts from Southern post-offices led to great\r\nexcitement and even violence. In August, 1835, Kendall, the\r\npostmaster-general, was appealed to by the postmaster at Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, for advice whether he should distribute papers\r\n\"inflammatory, and incendiary, and insurrectionary in the highest\r\ndegree,\" papers whose very custody endangered the mail. Kendall, in an\r\nextraordinary letter, said that he had no legal authority to prohibit\r\nthe delivery of papers on account of their character, but that he was\r\nnot prepared to direct the delivery at Charleston of papers such as were\r\ndescribed. Gouverneur, the postmaster at New York, being then appealed\r\nto by his Charleston brother, declined to forward papers mailed by the\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society. This dangerous usurpation was defended\r\nupon the principle of _salus populi suprema lex_.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1835, Jackson called the attention of Congress to the\r\ncirculation of \"inflammatory appeals addressed to the passions of the\r\nslaves\" (as they used to call the desire of black men to be free),\r\n\"calculated to stimulate them to insurrection and produce all the\r\nhorrors of a servile war.\" A bill was introduced making it unlawful for\r\nany postmaster knowingly to deliver any printed or pictorial paper\r\ntouching the subject of slavery in States by whose laws their\r\ncirculation was prohibited. Webster condemned the bill as a federal\r\nviolation of the freedom of the press. Clay thought it unconstitutional,\r\nvague, indefinite, and unnecessary, as the States could lay hold of\r\ncitizens taking such publications from post-offices within their\r\nborders. Benton and other senators, several of them Democrats, and seven\r\nfrom slaveholding States, voted against the bill, because they were, so\r\nBenton said, \"tired of the eternal cry of dissolving the Union, did not\r\nbelieve in it, and would not give a repugnant vote to avoid the trial.\"\r\nThe debate did not reach a very exalted height. The question was by no\r\nmeans free from doubt. Anti-slavery papers probably were, as the\r\nSoutherners said, \"incendiary\" to their States. Slavery depended upon\r\nignorance and fear. The federal post-office no doubt was intended, as\r\nKendall argued, to be a convenience to the various States, and not an\r\noffense against their codes of morality. There has been little\r\nopposition to the present prohibition of the use of the post-office for\r\nobscene literature, or, to take a better illustration, for the circulars\r\nof lotteries which are lawful in some States but not in others.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill came to a vote in the Senate, although there was really a\r\nsubstantial majority against it, a tie was skillfully arranged to compel\r\nVan Buren, as Vice-President, to give the casting vote. White, the\r\nSouthern Democratic candidate so seriously menacing him, was in the\r\nSenate, and voted for the bill. Van Buren must, it was supposed, offend\r\nthe pro-slavery men by voting against the bill, or offend the North and\r\nperhaps bruise his conscience by voting for it. When the roll was being\r\ncalled, Van Buren, so Benton tells us, was out of the chair, walking\r\nbehind the colonnade at the rear of the vice-president's seat. Calhoun,\r\nfearful lest he might escape the ordeal, eagerly asked where he was, and\r\ntold the sergeant-at-arms to look for him. But Van Buren was ready, and\r\nat once stepped to his chair and voted for the bill. His close friend,\r\nSilas Wright of New York, also voted for it. Benton says he deemed both\r\nthe votes to be political and given from policy. So they probably were.\r\nTo Van Buren all the fire-eating measures of Calhoun and the pro-slavery\r\nmen were most distasteful. He probably thought the bill would do more to\r\nincrease than allay agitation at the North. Walter Scott, when the\r\nprince regent toasted him as the author of \"Waverley,\" feeling that even\r\nroyal highness had no right in a numerous company to tear away the long\r\nkept and valuable secrecy of \"the great Unknown,\" rose and gravely said\r\nto his host: \"Sire, I am not the author of 'Waverley.'\" There were, he\r\nthought, questions which did not entitle the questioner to be told the\r\ntruth. So Van Buren may have thought there were political interrogations\r\nwhich, being made for sheer party purposes, might rightfully be answered\r\nfor like purposes. Since the necessity for his vote was contrived to\r\ninjure him and not to help or hurt the bill, he probably felt justified\r\nso to vote as best to frustrate the design against him. This persuasive\r\ncasuistry usually overcomes a candidate for great office in the stress\r\nof conflict. But lenient as may be the judgment of party supporters, and\r\ndistressing as may seem the necessity, the untruth pretty surely returns\r\nto plague the statesman. Van Buren never deserved to be called a\r\n\"Northern man with Southern principles.\" But this vote came nearer to an\r\nexcuse for the epithet than did any other act of his career.\r\n\r\nThe election proved how large was the Southern defection. Georgia and\r\nTennessee, which had been almost unanimous for Jackson in 1836, now\r\nvoted for White. Mississippi, where in that year there had been no\r\nopposition, and Louisiana, where Jackson had eight votes to Clay's five,\r\nnow gave Van Buren majorities of but three hundred each. In North\r\nCarolina Jackson had had 24,862 votes, and Clay only 4563; White got\r\n23,626 to 26,910 for Van Buren. In Virginia Jackson had three times the\r\nvote of Clay; Van Buren had but one fourth more votes than White. In\r\nBenton's own State, so nearly unanimous for Jackson, White had over 7000\r\nto Van Buren's 11,000. But in the Northeast Van Buren was very strong.\r\nJackson's majority in Maine of 6087 became a majority of 7751 for Van\r\nBuren. New Hampshire, the home of Hill and Woodbury, had given Jackson a\r\nmajority of 6376; it gave Van Buren over 12,000. The Democratic majority\r\nin New York rose from less than 14,000 to more than 28,000, and this\r\nmajority was rural and not urban. The majority in New York city was but\r\nabout 1000. Of the fifty-six counties, Van Buren carried forty-two,\r\nwhile nowadays his political successors rarely carry more than twenty.\r\nConnecticut had given a majority of 6000 for Clay; it gave Van Buren\r\nover 500. Rhode Island had voted for Clay; it now voted for Van Buren.\r\nMassachusetts was carried for Webster by 42,247 against 34,474 for Van\r\nBuren; Clay had had 33,003 to only 14,545 for Jackson. But New Jersey\r\nshifted from Jackson to Harrison, although a very close State at both\r\nelections; and in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, Van Buren\r\nfell far behind Jackson. The popular vote, omitting South Carolina,\r\nwhere the legislature chose the electors, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                       New     Middle\r\n                     England.  States.   South.    West.      Total.\r\n  Van Buren          112,480   310,203   141,942   198,053   762,678\r\n  Harrison, White,\r\n    and Webster      106,169   282,376   138,059   209,046   735,650\r\n\r\nThe electoral votes were thus divided:\r\n\r\n              New       Middle\r\n            England     States.  South.   West.   Total.\r\n  Van Buren    29         72       57      12      170\r\n  Harrison      7         21       --      45       73\r\n  Webster      14         --       --      --       14\r\n  White        --         --       26      --       26\r\n\r\nVan Buren thus came to the presidency supported by the great Middle\r\nStates and New England against the West, with the South divided.\r\nOmitting the uncontested reëlection of Monroe in 1820, and the almost\r\nuncontested reëlection of Jefferson in 1804, Van Buren was the first\r\nDemocratic candidate for president who carried New England. He had there\r\na clear majority in both the electoral and the popular vote. Nor has any\r\nDemocrat since Van Buren obtained a majority of the popular vote in that\r\nstrongly thinking and strongly prejudiced community. Pierce, against the\r\nfeeble Whig candidacy of Scott, carried its electoral vote in 1852, but\r\nby a minority of its popular vote, and only because of the large Free\r\nSoil vote for Hale. No other Democrat since 1852 has had any electoral\r\nvote from New England outside of Connecticut. Virginia refused its vote\r\nto Johnson, who, in the failure of either candidate to receive a\r\nmajority of the electoral vote, was chosen vice-president by the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen the electoral votes were formally counted before the houses of\r\nCongress, the result, so contemporary record informs us, was \"received\r\nwith perfect decorum by the House and galleries.\" Enthusiasm was going\r\nout with Jackson, to come back again with Harrison. Van Buren's election\r\nwas the success of intellectual convictions, and not the triumph of\r\nsentiment. He had come to power, as \"the House and galleries\" well knew,\r\nin \"perfect decorum.\" Not a single one of the generous but sometimes\r\ncheap and fruitless rushes of feeling occasionally so potent in politics\r\nhad helped him to the White House. Not that he was ungenerous or lacking\r\nin feeling. Very far from it; few men have inspired so steady and deep a\r\npolitical attachment among men of strong character and patriotic\r\naspirations. But neither in his person nor in his speech or conduct was\r\nthere anything of the strong picturesqueness which impresses masses of\r\nmen, who must be touched, if at all, by momentary glimpses of great men\r\nor by vivid phrases which become current about them. His election was no\r\nmore than a triumph of disciplined good sense and political wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCRISIS OF 1837\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1837, Jackson and Van Buren rode together from the White\r\nHouse to the Capitol in a \"beautiful phaëton\" made from the timber of\r\nthe old frigate Constitution, the gift to the general from the Democrats\r\nof New York city. He was the third and last president who has, after\r\nserving through his term, left office amid the same enthusiasm which\r\nattended him when he entered it, and to whom the surrender of place has\r\nnot been full of those pangs which attend sudden loss of power, and of\r\nwhich the certain anticipation ought to moderate ambition in a country\r\nso rarely permitting a long and continuous public career. Washington,\r\namid an almost unanimous love and reverence, left a station of which he\r\nwas unaffectedly weary; and he was greater out of office than in it.\r\nJefferson and Jackson remained really powerful characters. Neither at\r\nMonticello nor at the Hermitage, after their masters had returned, was\r\nthere any lack of the incense of sincere popular flattery or of the\r\nappeals for the exercise of admitted and enormous influence, in which\r\nlies much of the unspeakable fascination of a great public station.\r\n\r\nLeaving the White House under a still and brilliant sky, the retiring\r\nand incoming rulers had such a popular and military attendance as\r\nwithout much order or splendor has usually gone up Capitol Hill with our\r\npresidents. Van Buren's inaugural speech was heard, it is said, by\r\nnearly twenty thousand persons; for he read it with remarkable\r\ndistinctness and in a quiet air, from the historic eastern portico. He\r\nreturned from the inauguration to his private residence; and with a fine\r\ndeference insisted upon Jackson remaining in the White House until his\r\ndeparture, a few days later, for Tennessee. Van Buren in his own\r\ncarriage took Jackson to the terminus of the new railway upon which the\r\njourney home was to begin. He bade the old man a most affectionate\r\nfarewell, and promised to visit him at the Hermitage in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe new cabinet, with a single exception, was the same as Jackson's:\r\nJohn Forsyth of Georgia, secretary of state; Levi Woodbury of New\r\nHampshire, secretary of the treasury; Mahlon Dickerson of New Jersey,\r\nsecretary of the navy; Kendall, postmaster-general; and Butler,\r\nattorney-general. Joel R. Poinsett, a strong union man among the\r\nnullifiers of South Carolina, became secretary of war. Cass had left\r\nthis place in 1836 to be minister to France, and Butler had since\r\ntemporarily filled it, as well as his own post of attorney-general. The\r\ncabinet had indeed been largely Van Buren's, two years and more before\r\nhe was president.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's inaugural address began again with the favorite touch of\r\nhumility, but it now had an agreeable dignity. He was, he said, the\r\nfirst president born after the Revolution; he belonged to a later age\r\nthan his illustrious predecessors. Nor ought he to expect his countrymen\r\nto weigh his actions with the same kind and partial hand which they had\r\nused towards worthies of Revolutionary times. But he piously looked for\r\nthe sustaining support of Providence, and the kindness of a people who\r\nhad never yet deserted a public servant honestly laboring in their\r\ncause. There was the usual congratulation upon American institutions and\r\nhistory. We were, he said,--and the boast though not so delightful to\r\nthe taste of a later time was perfectly true,--without a parallel\r\nthroughout the world \"in all the attributes of a great, happy, and\r\nflourishing people.\" Though we restrained government to the \"sole\r\nlegitimate end of political institutions,\" we reached the Benthamite\r\n\"greatest happiness of the greatest number,\" and presented \"an aggregate\r\nof human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be found.\" We must, by\r\nobserving the limitations of government, perpetuate a condition of\r\nthings so singularly happy. Popular government, whose failure had fifty\r\nyears ago been boldly predicted, had now been found \"wanting in no\r\nelement of endurance or strength.\" His policy should be \"a strict\r\nadherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution ... viewing it as\r\nlimited to national objects, regarding it as leaving to the people and\r\nthe States all power not explicitly parted with.\" Upon one question he\r\nspoke precisely. For the first time slavery loomed up in the inaugural\r\nof an American president. It seemed, however, at once to disappear from\r\npolitics in the practically unanimous condemnation of the abolition\r\nagitation, an agitation which, though carried on for the noblest\r\npurposes, seemed--for such is the march of human rights--insane and\r\niniquitous to most patriotic and intelligent citizens. Van Buren quoted\r\nthe explicit declaration made by him before the election against the\r\nabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia without the consent of\r\nthe slave States, and against \"the slightest interference with it in the\r\nStates where it exists.\" Not a word was said of the extension of slavery\r\nin the Territories. That question still slept under the potion of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, to wake with the acquisition of Texas. In Van\r\nBuren's declaration there was nothing in the slightest degree\r\ninconsistent even with the Republican platforms of 1856 and 1860.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural concluded with a fine tribute to Jackson. \"I know,\" Van\r\nBuren said, \"that I cannot expect to perform the arduous task with equal\r\nability and success. But united as I have been in his counsels, a daily\r\nwitness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his country's\r\nwelfare, agreeing with him in sentiments which his countrymen have\r\nwarmly supported, and permitted to partake largely of his confidence, I\r\nmay hope that somewhat of the same cheering approbation will be found to\r\nattend upon my path. For him I but express, with my own, the wishes of\r\nall, that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his\r\nwell-spent life.\"\r\n\r\nThe lucid optimism of the speech was in perfect temper with this one of\r\nthose shining and mellow days, which even March now and then brings to\r\nWashington. But there was latent in the atmosphere a storm, carrying\r\nwith it a furious and complete devastation. In the month before the\r\ninauguration, Benton, upon whom Van Buren was pressing a seat in the\r\ncabinet, told the President-elect that they were on the eve of an\r\nexplosion of the paper-money system. But the latter offended Benton by\r\nsaying: \"Your friends think you a little exalted in the head on the\r\nsubject.\" And doubtless the prophecies of the Bank opponents had been\r\nsomewhat discredited by the delay of the disaster which was to justify\r\ntheir denunciations. The profoundly thrilling and hidden delight which\r\ncomes with the first taste of supreme power, even to the experienced and\r\nbattered man of affairs, had been enjoyed by Van Buren only a few days,\r\nwhen the air grew heavy about him, and then perturbed, and then\r\nviolently agitated, until in two months broke fiercely and beyond all\r\nrestraint the most terrific of commercial convulsions in the United\r\nStates. Since Washington began the experiment of our federal government\r\namid the sullen doubts of extreme Federalists and extreme Democrats, no\r\npresident, save only Abraham Lincoln, has had to face at the outset of\r\nhis presidency so appalling a political situation.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the panic of 1837 lay far deeper than in the complex\r\nprocesses of banking or in the faults of federal administration of the\r\nfinances. But, as a man suddenly ill prefers to find for his ailment\r\nsome recent and obvious cause, and is not convinced by even a long and\r\ndangerous sickness that its origin lay in old and continued habits of\r\nlife, so the greater part of the American people and of their leaders\r\nbelieved this extraordinary crisis to be the result of financial\r\nblunders of Jackson's administration. They believed that Van Buren could\r\nwith a few strokes of his pen repair, if he pleased, those blunders, and\r\nrestore commercial confidence and prosperity. The panic of 1837 became,\r\nand has very largely remained, the subject of political and partisan\r\ndifferences, which obscure its real phenomena and causes. The far-seeing\r\nand patriotic intrepidity with which Van Buren met its almost\r\noverwhelming difficulties is really the crown of his political career.\r\nFairly to appreciate the service he then rendered his country, the\r\ncauses of this famous crisis must be attentively considered.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the United States suffered from commercial and financial\r\nderangement, which may be assumed to have been the effect of the second\r\nwar with Great Britain. The enormous waste of a great war carried on by\r\na highly organized nation is apt not to become obvious in general\r\nbusiness distress until some time after the war has ended. A buoyant\r\nextravagance in living and in commercial and manufacturing ventures will\r\ncontinue after a peace has brought its extraordinary promises, upon the\r\nfaith of which, and in joyful ignorance, the evil and inevitable day is\r\npostponed. All this was seen later and on a vaster scale from 1865 to\r\n1873. In 1821 the country had quite recovered from its depression; and\r\nfrom this time on to near the end of Jackson's administration the United\r\nStates saw a material prosperity, doubtless greater than any before\r\nknown. The exuberant outburst of John Quincy Adams's message of\r\n1827,--that the productions of our soil, the exchanges of our commerce,\r\nthe vivifying labors of human industry, had combined \"to mingle in our\r\ncup a portion of enjoyment as large and liberal as the indulgence of\r\nHeaven has perhaps ever granted to the imperfect state of man upon\r\nearth,\"--was in the usual tone of the public utterances of our\r\npresidents from 1821 to 1837. Our harvests were always great. We were a\r\nchosen people delighting in reminders from our rulers of our prosperity,\r\nand not restless under their pious urgency of perennial gratitude to\r\nProvidence. In 1821 the national debt had slightly increased, reaching\r\nupwards of $90,000,000; but from that time its steady and rapid payment\r\nwent on until it was all discharged in 1834. Our cities grew. Our\r\npopulation stretched eagerly out into the rich Mississippi valley. From\r\na population of ten millions in 1821, we reached sixteen millions in\r\n1837. New York from about 1,400,000 became 2,200,000; and Pennsylvania\r\nfrom about 1,000,000 became 1,600,000. But the amazing growth was at\r\nthe West--Illinois from 60,000 to 400,000, Indiana from 170,000 to\r\n600,000, Ohio from 600,000 to 1,400,000, Tennessee from 450,000 to\r\n800,000. Missouri had increased her 70,000 five-fold; Mississippi her\r\n80,000 four-fold; Michigan her 10,000 twenty-fold. Iowa and Wisconsin\r\nwere entirely unsettled in 1821; in 1837 the fertile lands of the former\r\nmaintained nearly forty thousand and of the latter nearly thirty\r\nthousand hardy citizens. New towns and cities rose with magical\r\nrapidity. With much that was unlovely there was also exhibited an\r\namazing energy and capacity for increase in wealth. The mountain\r\nbarriers once passed, not only by adventurous pioneers but by the\r\npressing throngs of settlers, there were few obstacles to the rapid\r\ncreation of comfort and wealth. Nor in the Mississippi valley and the\r\nlands of the Northwest were the settlers met by the harsh soil, the\r\nhostilities and reluctance of nature in whose conquest upon the Atlantic\r\nseaboard the American people had gained some of their strongest and most\r\nenduring characteristics. We hardly realize indeed how much better it\r\nwas for after times that our first settlements were difficult. In the\r\neasy opening and tillage of the rich and sometimes rank lands at the\r\nWest there was an inferior, a less arduous discipline. American temper\r\nthere rushed often to speculation, rather than to toil or venture. It\r\ndid not seem necessary to create wealth by labor; the treasures lay\r\nready for those first reaching the doors of the treasure house. To make\r\neasy the routes to El Dorado of prairies and river bottoms was the\r\nquickest way to wealth.\r\n\r\nRoads, canals, river improvements, preceded, attended, followed these\r\nsudden settlements, this vast and jubilant movement of population. There\r\nwas an extraordinary growth of \"internal improvements.\" In his message\r\nof 1831, Jackson rejoiced at the high wages earned by laborers in the\r\nconstruction of these works, which he truly said were \"extending with\r\nunprecedented rapidity.\" The constitutional power of the federal\r\ngovernment to promote the improvements within the States became a\r\nserious question, because the improvements proposed were upon so vast a\r\nscale. No single interest had for fifteen years before 1837 held so\r\nlarge a part of American attention as did the making of canals and\r\nroads. The debates of Congress and legislatures, the messages of\r\npresidents and governors, were full of it. If the Erie Canal, finished\r\nin 1825, had rendered vast natural resources available, and had made its\r\nchief builder famous, why should not like schemes prosper further west?\r\nThe success of railroads was already established; and there was\r\nindefinite promise in the extensions of them already planned. In 1830\r\ntwenty-three miles had been constructed; in 1831 ninety-four miles; and\r\nin 1836 the total construction had risen to 1273 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Americans were then a far more homogeneous people than they are\r\nto-day. The great Irish, German, and Scandinavian immigrations had not\r\ntaken place. Our race diversities were, with exceptions, unimportant in\r\nextent or lost in the lapse of time, the diversities merely of British\r\ndescendants. Nor were there the extremes of fortune or the diversities\r\nof occupation which have come with the growth of cities and\r\nmanufacturing interests. The United States were still a nation of\r\nfarmers. The compensations and balances, which in the varying habits and\r\nprejudices of a more varied population tend to restrain and neutralize\r\nvagaries, did not exist. One sentiment seized the whole nation far more\r\nreadily than could happen in the complexity of our modern population and\r\nthe diversity and rivalry of its strains. Not only did this homogeneity\r\nmake Americans open to single impulses; but there was little essential\r\ndifference of environment. They all, since the later days of Monroe's\r\npresidency, had lived in the atmosphere of official delight and\r\ncongratulation over the past, and of unrestrained promise for the\r\nfuture. All, whether in the grain fields at the North or the cotton\r\nfields at the South, had behind them the Atlantic with traditions or\r\nexperiences of poverty and oppression beyond it. Every American had, in\r\nhis own latitude, since the ampler opening of roads and waterways, and\r\nthe peaceful conquest of the Appalachian mountain ranges, seen to the\r\nwest of him fertility and promise and performance. And the fertility and\r\npromise had, since the second English war, been no longer in a land of\r\nhardship and adventure remote and almost foreign to the seaboard. Every\r\nAmerican under Jackson's administration had before him, as the one\r\nuniversal experience of those who had taken lands at the West, an\r\nenormous and certain increase of value, full of enchantment to those\r\nlately tilling the flinty soil of New England or the overused fields of\r\nthe South. If new lands at the West could be made accessible by internal\r\nimprovements, the succession of seed time and harvest had for a dozen\r\nyears seemed no more certain than that the value of those lands would at\r\nonce increase prodigiously. So the American people with one consent gave\r\nthemselves to an amazing extravagance of land speculation. The Eden\r\nwhich Martin Chuzzlewit saw in later malarial decay was to be found in\r\nthe new country on almost every stream to the east of the Mississippi\r\nand on many streams west of it, where flatboats could be floated. Frauds\r\nthere doubtless were; but they were incidental to the honest delusion of\r\nintelligent men inspired by the most extraordinary growth the world had\r\nseen. The often quoted illustration of Mobile, the valuation of whose\r\nreal estate rose from $1,294,810 in 1831 to $27,482,961 in 1837, to sink\r\nagain in 1846 to $8,638,250, not unfairly tells the story. In Pensacola,\r\nlots which to-day are worth $50 each were sold for as much as lots on\r\nFifth Avenue in New York, which to-day are worth $100,000 apiece. Real\r\nestate in the latter city was assessed in 1836 at more than it was in\r\nthe greatly larger and richer city of fifteen years later. From 1830 to\r\n1837 the steamboat tonnage on the Western rivers rose from 63,053 to\r\n253,661. From 1833 to 1837 the cotton crop of the newer slave States,\r\nTennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Florida,\r\nincreased from 536,450 to 916,960 bales, while the price with\r\nfluctuations rose from ten to twenty cents a pound. Foreign capital\r\nnaturally enough came to share in the splendid money-making. From 1821\r\nto 1833 the annual import of specie from England had averaged about\r\n$100,000, in the last year being only $31,903; but in 1834 it became\r\n$5,716,253, in 1835 $914,958, and in 1836 $2,322,920, the entire export\r\nto England of specie for all these three years being but $51,807, while\r\nthe average export from 1822 to 1830 had been about $400,000; and its\r\namount in 1831 had been $2,089,766, and in 1832 $1,730,571. From 1830 to\r\n1837, both years inclusive, although the imports from all countries of\r\ngeneral merchandise exceeded the exports by $140,700,000, there was no\r\ncounter movement of specie. The imports of specie from all countries\r\nduring these years exceeded the exports by the comparatively enormous\r\nsum of $44,700,000. The foreigners therefore took pay for their goods,\r\nnot only in our raw materials, but also in our investments or rather our\r\nspeculations, and sent these vast quantities of moneys besides. So our\r\ngood fortune fired the imaginations of even the dull Europeans. They\r\nhelped to feed and clothe us that we might experiment with Aladdin's\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\nThe price of public lands was fixed by law at $1.25 an acre; and they\r\nwere open to any purchaser, without the wholesome limits of acreage and\r\nthe restraint to actual settlers which were afterwards established. Here\r\nthen was a commodity whose price to wholesale purchasers did not rise,\r\nand the very commodity by which so many fortunes had been made. In\r\npublic lands, therefore, the fury of money-getting, the boastful\r\nconfidence in the future of the country, reached their climax. From 1820\r\nto 1829 the annual sales had averaged less than $1,300,000, in 1829\r\nbeing $1,517,175. But in 1830 they exceeded $2,300,000, in 1831\r\n$3,200,000, in 1832 $2,600,000, in 1833 $3,900,000, and in 1834\r\n$4,800,000. In 1835 they suddenly mounted to $14,757,600, and in 1836 to\r\n$24,877,179. In his messages of 1829 and 1830 Jackson not unreasonably\r\ntreated the moderate increase in the sales as a proof of increasing\r\nprosperity. In 1831 his congratulations were hushed; but in 1835 he\r\nagain fancied, even in the abnormal sales of that year, only an ampler\r\nproof of ampler prosperity. In 1836 he at last saw that tremendous\r\nspeculation was the true significance of the enormous increase. Prices\r\nof course went up. Everybody thought himself richer and his labor worth\r\nmore. A week after Van Buren's inauguration a meeting was held in the\r\nCity Hall Park in New York to protest against high rents and the high\r\nprices of provisions; and with much discernment the cry went up, \"No rag\r\nmoney; give us gold and silver!\"\r\n\r\nThere is no longer dispute that the prostration of business in 1837, and\r\nfor several years afterward, was the perfectly natural result of the\r\nspeculation which had gone before. The absurd denunciations of Van Buren\r\nby the most eminent of the Whigs for not ending the crisis by\r\ngovernmental interference are no longer respected. But it is still\r\nfancied that the speculation itself was caused by one financial blunder,\r\nand the crisis immediately occasioned by another financial blunder, of\r\nJackson. It is not improbable that the deposits of treasury moneys in\r\nfifty state banks[12] instead of in the United States Bank and its twenty\r\nand more branches, which began in the fall of 1833, aided the tendency\r\nto speculation. But this aid was at the most a slight matter. The\r\nimpression has been sedulously created that these state banks, the \"pet\r\nbanks,\" were doubtful institutions. There seems little reason to doubt\r\nthat in general they were perfectly sound and reputable institutions,\r\nwith which the government moneys would be quite as safe as with the\r\nUnited States Bank. It is clear that if the latter Bank were not to be\r\nrechartered, the deposits should, without regard to the accusations of\r\npolitical meddling brought against it, have been removed some time in\r\nadvance of its death in March, 1836. At best it is matter of doubtful\r\nspeculation whether the United States Bank under Biddle's direction\r\nwould, in 1834, 1835, and 1836, while the government deposits were\r\nenormously increasing, have behaved with much greater prudence and\r\nforesight than did the state deposit banks. So far as actual experience\r\nhelps us, the doubt might well be solved in the negative. The United\r\nStates Bank, when its federal charter lapsed, obtained a charter from\r\nPennsylvania, continuing under the same management; and is said, and\r\npossibly with truth, to have entered upon its new career with a great\r\nsurplus. But it proved no stronger than the state banks in 1837; it\r\nobstructed resumption in 1838; it suspended again in 1839, while the\r\nEastern banks stood firm; and in 1841 it went to pieces in disgraceful\r\nand complete disaster.\r\n\r\nThe enormous extension of bank credits during the three years before the\r\nbreak-down in 1837 was rather the symptom than the cause of the disease.\r\nThe fever of speculation was in the veins of the community before\r\n\"kiting\" began. Bank officers dwelt in the same atmosphere as did other\r\nAmericans, and their sanguine extravagance in turn stimulated the\r\nuniversal temper of speculation.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States Bank lost the government deposits, late in 1833,\r\nthey amounted to a little less than $10,000,000. On January 1, 1835,\r\nmore than a year after the state banks took the deposits, they had\r\nincreased to a little more than $10,000,000. But the public debt being\r\nthen paid and the outgo of money thus checked, the deposits had by\r\nJanuary 1, 1836, reached $25,000,000, and by June 1, 1836, $41,500,000.\r\nThis enormous advance represented the sudden increase in the sales of\r\npublic lands, which were paid for in bank paper, which in turn formed\r\nthe bulk of the government deposits. The deposits were with only a small\r\npart of the six hundred and more state banks then in existence. But the\r\nincrease in the sales of public lands was the result of all the organic\r\ncauses and of all the long train of events which had seated the fever of\r\nspeculation so profoundly in the American character of the day. To those\r\ncauses and events must ultimately be ascribed the extension of bank\r\ncredits so far as it immediately arose out of the increase of government\r\ndeposits. Nor is there any sufficient reason to suppose that if the\r\ndeposits, instead of being in fifty state banks, had remained in the\r\nUnited States Bank and its branches, the tendency to speculation would\r\nhave been less. The influences which surrounded that Bank were the very\r\ninfluences most completely subject to the popular mania.\r\n\r\nBut the increase of government deposits was only fuel added to the\r\nflames. The craze for banks and credits was unbounded before the removal\r\nof the deposits had taken place, and before their great increase could\r\nhave had serious effect. Between 1830 and January 1, 1834, the banking\r\ncapital of the United States had risen from $61,000,000 to about\r\n$200,000,000; the loans and discounts of the banks from $200,000,000 to\r\n$324,000,000; and their note circulation from $61,000,000 to\r\n$95,000,000. The increase from January 1, 1834, to January 1, 1836, was\r\neven more rapid, the banking capital advancing in the two years to\r\n$251,000,000, the loans and discounts to $457,000,000, and the note\r\ncirculation to $140,000,000. But there was certainty of disaster in the\r\nabnormal growth from 1830 to 1834. The insanity of speculation was in\r\nample though unobserved control of the country while Nicholas Biddle\r\nstill controlled the deposits, and was certain to reach a climax whether\r\nthey stayed with him or went elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult rightly to apportion among the statesmen and politicians\r\nof the time so much of blame for the mania of speculation as must go to\r\nthat body of men. They had all drunk in the national intoxication over\r\nAmerican success and growth. But if we pass from the greater and deeper\r\ncauses to the lesser though more obvious ones, it is impossible not to\r\nvisit the greater measure of blame upon the statesmen who resisted\r\nreduction of taxation, which would have left money in the pockets of\r\nthose who earned it, and not collected it in one great bank with many\r\nbranches or in fifty lesser banks; upon the statesmen who insisted that\r\nthe government ought to aid commercial ventures by encouraging the loans\r\nto traders of its own moneys held in the deposit banks; upon the\r\nstatesmen who promoted the dangerous scheme of distributing the surplus\r\namong the States instead of abolishing the surplus. As the condemnation\r\nof public men in the wrong must be proportioned somewhat to the\r\ndistinction of their positions and the greatness of their natural gifts,\r\nthis larger share of blame must go chiefly to Daniel Webster and Henry\r\nClay. At the head of their associates, they had resisted the reduction\r\nof taxation. In his speech on the tariff bill of 1832 Clay said, with\r\nthe exuberance so delightful to minds of easy discipline, that our\r\nresources should \"not be hoarded and hugged with a miser's embrace, but\r\nliberally used.\" They insisted upon freely lending the public moneys. In\r\nhis speech on the distribution of the surplus, Webster urged that the\r\nnumber of the deposit banks \"be so far increased that each may regard\r\nthat portion of the public treasure which it may receive as an increase\r\nof its effective deposits, to be used, like other moneys in deposit, as\r\na basis of discount, to a just and proper extent.\" The public money was\r\nlocked up, he declared, instead of aiding the general business of the\r\ncountry. Nor after this was he ashamed in 1838 to condemn Jackson's\r\nsecretary of the treasury for advising the new deposit banks, as he had\r\nhimself thus advised them, \"to afford increased facilities to commerce.\"\r\nIf, indeed, Congress would not take steps to keep a government surplus\r\nout of the banks and in the pockets of producers, the secretary ought\r\nnot to have been harshly judged for advising that the money go out into\r\ncommerce rather than lie in bank vaults.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the surplus among the States by the law of 1836 was\r\nthe last and in some respects the worst of the measures which aided and\r\nexaggerated the tendency to speculation. By this bill, all the money\r\nabove $5,000,000 in the treasury on January 1, 1837, was to be\r\n\"deposited\" with the States in four quarterly installments commencing on\r\nthat day. According to the law the \"deposit\" was but a loan to the\r\nStates; but, as Clay declared, not \"a single member of either House\r\nimagined that a dollar would ever be recalled.\" It was in truth a mere\r\ngift. Clay's triumphant ridicule of the opposition to this measure has\r\nalready been mentioned. Webster in sounding periods declared his \"deep\r\nand earnest conviction\" of the propriety of the stupendous folly. He did\r\nnot, indeed, defend the general system of making the federal government\r\na tax-gatherer for the States. But this one distribution would, he said\r\nin his speech of May 31, 1836, \"remove that severe and almost\r\nunparalleled pressure for money which is now distressing and breaking\r\ndown the industry, the enterprise, and even the courage of the\r\ncommercial community.\" The Whig press declared that a congressman who\r\ncould for mere party reasons vote against a measure which would bring so\r\nmuch money into his State, must be \"far gone in political hardihood as\r\nwell as depravity;\" and that \"to the Republican-Whig party alone are the\r\nStates indebted for the benefits arising from the distribution.\" William\r\nH. Seward, two years before and two years later the Whig candidate for\r\ngovernor of New York, said the proposal was \"noble and just.\" The\r\nmeasure passed the Senate with six Democratic votes against it, among\r\nthem the vote of Silas Wright, then probably closer than any other\r\nsenator to Van Buren. Jackson yielded to the bill what in his message in\r\nDecember of the same year he called \"a reluctant approval.\" He then gave\r\nat length very clear reasons for his reluctance, but none for his\r\napproval. He declared that \"improvident expenditure of money is the\r\nparent of profligacy,\" and that no intelligent and virtuous community\r\nwould consent to raise a surplus for the mere purpose of dividing it. In\r\nhis first message, indeed, Jackson had called the distribution among the\r\nStates \"the most safe, just, and federal disposition\" of the surplus.\r\nBut his views upon this, as upon other subjects, had changed during the\r\ncomposition of the Democratic creed which went on during the early years\r\nof his administration. His second message rehearsed at length the\r\nobjections to the distribution, though affecting to meet them. In his\r\nthird message he recommended the abolition of unnecessary taxation, not\r\nthe distribution of its proceeds; and in 1832 he made his explicit\r\ndeclaration that duties should be \"reduced to the revenue standard.\"\r\nBenton says it was understood that in 1836 some of Van Buren's friends\r\nurged Jackson to approve the bill, lest a veto of so popular a measure\r\nmight bring a Democratic defeat. There must have been some reason\r\nunrelated to the merit of the measure. But whatever the opinions of Van\r\nBuren's friends, he took care before the election to make known\r\nunequivocally, in the Sherrod Williams letter already quoted, his\r\ndislike of this piece of demagogy. From the passage of the deposit bill\r\nin June, 1836, until the crash in 1837, this superb donation of\r\nthirty-seven millions was before the enraptured and deluded vision of\r\nthe country. Over nine millions a quarter to be poured into\r\n\"improvements\" or loaned to the needy,--what a delightful prospect to\r\ncitizens harassed by the restraints of prudent, fruitful industry! The\r\nlesson is striking and wholesome, and ought not to be forgotten, that it\r\nwas when the land was in the very midst of these largesses that the\r\nuniversal bankruptcy set in.\r\n\r\nDuring 1835 and 1836 there were omens of the coming storm. Some\r\nperceived the rabid character of the speculative fever. William L.\r\nMarcy, governor of New York, in his message of January, 1836, answering\r\nthe dipsomaniac cry for more banks, declared that an unregulated spirit\r\nof speculation had taken capital out of the State; but that the amount\r\nso transferred bore no comparison to the enormous speculations in stocks\r\nand in real property within the State. Lands near the cities and\r\nvillages of the State had risen several hundred per cent. in value, and\r\nwere sold, not to be occupied by the buyers, but to be sold again at\r\nhigher prices. The passion for speculation prevailed to an extent before\r\nunknown, not only among capitalists, but among merchants, who abstracted\r\ncapital from their business for land and stock speculations and then\r\nresorted to the banks. The warning was treated contemptuously; but\r\nbefore the year was out the federal administration also became anxious,\r\nand the increase in land sales no longer signified to Jackson an\r\nincreasing prosperity. The master hand which drew the economic\r\ndisquisition in his message of 1836 pointed to these sales as the\r\neffects of the extension of bank credit and of the over-issue of bank\r\npaper. The banks, it was declared, had lent their notes as \"mere\r\ninstruments to transfer to speculators the most valuable public land,\r\nand pay the government by a credit on the books of the banks.\" Each\r\nspeculation had furnished means for another. No sooner had one purchaser\r\npaid his debt in the notes than they were lent to another for a like\r\npurpose. The banks had extended their business and their issues so\r\nlargely as to alarm considerate men. The spirit of expansion and\r\nspeculation had not been confined to deposit banks, but had pervaded the\r\nwhole multitude of banks throughout the Union, and had given rise to new\r\ninstitutions to aggravate the evil. So Jackson proceeded with his sound\r\ndefense of the famous specie circular, long and even still denounced as\r\nthe _causa causans_ of the crisis of 1837.\r\n\r\nBy this circular, issued on July 11, 1836, the secretary of the treasury\r\nhad required payment for public lands to be made in specie, with an\r\nexception until December 15, 1836, in favor of actual settlers and\r\nactual residents of the State in which the lands were sold. The enormous\r\nsales of land in this year, and the large payments required for them\r\nunder the circular, at once made the banks realize that there ought to\r\nbe an actual physical basis for their paper transactions. Gold was\r\ncalled from the East to the banks at the West to make the land payments.\r\nInto the happy exaltation of unreal transactions was now plunged that\r\nharsh demand for real value which sooner or later must always come. The\r\ndemand was passed on from one to another, and its magnitude and\r\nperemptoriness grew rapidly. The difference between paper and gold\r\nbecame plainer and plainer. Nature's vital and often hidden truth that\r\nvalue depends upon labor could no longer be kept secret by a few wise\r\nmen. The suspicion soon arose that there was not real and available\r\nvalue to meet the demands of nominal value. The suspicion was soon\r\nbruited among the less as well as the more wary. Every man rushed to his\r\nbank or his debtor, crying, \"Pay me in value, not in promises to pay;\r\nthere is, I at last see, a difference between them.\" But the banks and\r\ndebtors had no available value, but only its paper semblances. Every man\r\nfound that what he wanted, his neighbors did not have to give him, and\r\nwhat he had, his neighbors did not want.\r\n\r\nThis is hardly an appropriate place to attempt an analysis of the\r\nelements of a commercial crisis. But it is not possible rightly to\r\nestimate Van Buren's moral courage and keen-sighted wisdom in meeting\r\nthe terrible pressure of 1837 without appreciating what it was which had\r\nreally happened. The din of the disputes over the refusal to re-charter\r\nthe bank, over the removal of the deposits, over the refusal to pay the\r\nlast installment of the distribution among the States, and over the\r\nspecie circular, resounds even to our own time. To many the crisis\r\nseemed merely a financial or even a great banking episode. Many friends\r\nof the administration loudly cried that the disaster arose from the\r\ntreachery of the banks in suspending. Many of its enemies saw only the\r\nnormal fruit of administrative blunders, first in recklessness, and last\r\nin heartless indifference. To most Americans, whatever their\r\ndifferences, the explanation of this profound and lasting disturbance\r\nseemed to lie in the machinery of finance, rather than in the deeper\r\nfacts of the physical wealth and power of the trading classes.\r\n\r\nSpeculation is sometimes said to be universal; and it was never nearer\r\nuniversality than from 1830 to 1837. But speculation affects after all\r\nbut a small part of the community,--the part engaged in trade, venture,\r\nnew settlement or new manufacture; those classes of men the form of\r\nwhose work is not established by tradition, but is changing and\r\nimproving under the spur of ingenuity and invention, and with whom\r\nimagination is most powerful and fruitful. These men use the surplus\r\nresources of the vastly greater number who go on through periods of high\r\nprices and of low prices with their steady toil and unvaried production.\r\nIn our country and in all industrial communities it is to the former\r\ncomparatively small class that chiefly and characteristically belong\r\n\"good times\" and \"bad times,\" panics and crises and depressions. It is\r\nthis class which in newspapers and financial reviews becomes \"the\r\ncountry.\" It chiefly supports the more influential of the clergy, the\r\nlawyers, the editors, and others of the professional classes. It deals\r\nwith the new uses and the accumulations of wealth; it almost monopolizes\r\npublic attention; it is chiefly and conspicuously identified with\r\nindustrial and commercial changes and progress. But if great depressions\r\nwere as nearly universal as the rhetoric of economists and historians\r\nwould literally signify, our ancestors fifty years ago must have\r\nexperienced a devastation such as Alaric is said to have brought to the\r\nfields of Lombardy. But this was not so. The processes of general\r\nproduction went on; the land was tilled; the farmer's work of the year\r\nbrought about the same amount of comfort; the ordinary mechanic was not\r\nmuch worse off. If some keen observer from another planet had in 1835\r\nand again later in 1837 looked into the dining-rooms and kitchens and\r\nparlors of America, had seen its citizens with their families going to\r\nchurch of a Sunday morning, or watched the tea-parties of their wives,\r\nor if he had looked over the fields and into the shops, there would have\r\nseemed to him but slight difference between the two years in the\r\noccupations, the industry, or the comfort of the people. But if he had\r\nstopped looking and begun to listen, he would in 1837 at once have\r\nperceived a tremendous change. The great masses of producing men would\r\nhave been mute, as they usually are. But the capitalists, the traders,\r\nthe manufacturers, all whose skill, courage, imagination, and adventure\r\nmade them the leaders of progress, and whose voices were the only loud,\r\nclear, intelligible voices, until there arose the modern organizations\r\nof laboring men,--all those who in 1835 were flushed and glorious with a\r\nroyal money-getting,--he would now have heard crying in frenzy and\r\ndesperation. It is not meant to disparage the importance of this smaller\r\nbut louder body of men, or to underrate the disaster which they\r\nsuffered. In proportion to their numbers, they were vastly the most\r\nimportant part of the community. If they were prostrated, there must not\r\nonly suffer the body of clerks, operatives, and laborers immediately\r\nengaged in their enterprises, and who may for economical purposes be\r\nranked with them; but later on, the masses of the community must to a\r\nreal extent feel the interruption of progress which has overtaken that\r\nsection of the community to which are committed the characteristic\r\noperations of material progress; and whether through the fault or the\r\nmisfortune of that section, the injury is alike serious. A wise ruler,\r\nin touching the finances of his country, will forget none of this. He\r\nwill look through all the agitation of bankers and traders and\r\nmanufacturers, the well-voiced leaders of the richer classes of men, to\r\nthe far vaster processes of industry carried on by men who are silent,\r\nand whose silent industry will go on whatever devices of currency or\r\nbanking may be adopted. This wisdom Van Buren now showed in an exalted\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe disaster which in 1837 overtook so large and so important a part of\r\nthe community was, in its ultimate nature, not difficult to comprehend.\r\n\r\nThere had not been one equal and universal increase in nominal values.\r\nSuch an increase would not have produced the crisis. But while the great\r\nmass of the national industry went on in channels and with methods and\r\nrates substantially undisturbed, there took place an enormous and\r\nspeculative advance of prices in the cities where were carried on the\r\noperations of important traders and the promoters of enterprises, and in\r\nthe very new country where these enterprises found their material. When\r\na new canal or road was built, or a new line of river steamers launched\r\nand an unsettled country made accessible, several things inevitably\r\nhappened in the temper produced by the jubilant observation of the past.\r\nThere was not only drawn from the ordinary industry of the country the\r\nwealth necessary to build the canal or road or steamers; but the country\r\nthus rendered accessible seemed suddenly to gain a value measured by the\r\nbest results of former settlements, however exceptional, and by the most\r\nsanguine hopes for the future. The owners of the prairies and woods and\r\nriver bottoms became suddenly rich, as a miner in Idaho becomes rich\r\nwhen he strikes a true fissure vein. The owners of the canal or road or\r\nline of steamers found their real investment at once multiplied in\r\ndollars by the value of the country whose trade they were to enjoy; for,\r\nnew as that value was, it seemed assured. Like investments were made in\r\nbanks, and in every implement of direct or indirect use in the conduct\r\nof industries which seemed to belong as a necessity to the new value of\r\nthe land. The numerous sales of lands and of stocks in roads or canals\r\nor banks at rapidly advancing prices did not alter the nature, although\r\nthey vastly augmented the effect, of what was happening. The so-called\r\n\"business classes\" throughout the country, related as they quickly\r\nbecame, under the great impetus of the national hopefulness and vanity,\r\nto the new lands, to the new cities and towns and farms, and to the\r\nmeans of reaching them and of providing them with the necessities and\r\ncomforts of civilization, found their wealth rapidly and largely\r\nincreasing. Then naturally enough followed the spending of money in\r\npersonal luxury. This meant the withdrawal of labor in the older part of\r\nthe country from productive work, for which the country was fitted, to\r\nwork which, whether suitable or not, was unproductive. The unproductive\r\nlabor was paid, as the employers supposed, from the new value lately\r\ncreated at the West. So capital, that is, accumulated labor, was first\r\nspent in improvements in the new country, and then, and probably in a\r\nfar greater amount, spent in more costly food, clothes, equipage, and\r\nother luxuries in the older country. The successive sales at advancing\r\nprices simply increased the sense of new wealth, and augmented more and\r\nmore this destructive consumption of the products of labor, or the\r\ndestructive diversion of labor from productive to unproductive activity\r\nat the East by the well-to-do classes.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the panic the new wealth, whose seeming possession\r\napparently justified this destructive consumption or diversion to luxury\r\nof physical value, was primarily represented by titles to lands, stocks\r\nin land, canal, turnpike, railroad, transportation, or banking\r\ncompanies, and the notes issued by banks or traders or speculators. The\r\nvalue of these stocks and notes depended upon the fruitfulness of the\r\nlands or canals or roads or steamboat lines. Prices of many commodities\r\nhad, indeed, been enhanced by speculation beyond all proper relation to\r\nother commodities, measured by the ultimate standard of the quantity and\r\nquality of labor. But important as was this element, it was subordinate\r\nto the apparent creation of wealth at the West.\r\n\r\nBefore the panic broke, it began to appear that mere surveys of wild\r\ntracts into lots made neither towns nor cities; that canals and roads\r\nand steamboats did not hew down trees or drain morasses or open the\r\nglebe. The basis of the operations of capitalists and promoters and\r\nventurers in new fields, if those operations were to have real success,\r\nmust lie in the masses of strong and skillful arms of men of labor. The\r\noperations were fruitless until there came a population well sinewed and\r\ngladly ready for arduous toil. In 1836 and 1837 the operators found that\r\nthere was no longer a population to give enduring life to their new\r\noperations. They had far outstripped all the immediate or even the\r\nnearly promised movements of settlers. Men, however hardy, preferred to\r\nwork within an easier reach of the physical and social advantages of\r\nsettlements already made, until they could see the superior fruitfulness\r\nof labor further on. The new cities and towns and farms and the means of\r\nreaching them would be mere paper assets until an army of settlers was\r\nready to enter in and make them sources of actual physical wealth. But\r\nthe army stopped far short of the new Edens and metropolises. There was\r\nno creation among them of the actual wealth, the return of physical\r\nlabor, to make good and real the popular semblances of wealth, upon the\r\nfaith of which in the older part of the country had arisen new methods\r\nof business and habits of living. The withdrawal of actual wealth from\r\nthe multifarious treasuries of capital and industry, to meet the expense\r\nof the improvements at the West and the increased luxury at the East,\r\nhad reached a point where the pressure caused by the deficiency of\r\nphysical wealth was too great for the hopefulness or credulity of those\r\nwho had been surrendering that wealth upon the promises of successful\r\nand opulent settlements at the West. Nor was all this confined to\r\nventures in the new States. Almost every Eastern city had a suburb where\r\nwith slight differences all the phenomena of speculation were as real\r\nand obvious as in Illinois or Mississippi.\r\n\r\nJackson's specie circular toppled over the house of cards, which at best\r\ncould have stood but little longer. In place of bank-notes, which\r\nsymbolized the expectations and hopes of the owners of new towns and\r\nimprovements, the United States after July, 1836, required from all but\r\nactual settlers gold and silver for lands. An insignificant part of the\r\nsales had been lately made to settlers. They were chiefly made to\r\nspeculators. The public lands, which sold invariably at $1.25 an acre,\r\nwere enormously magnified in nominal value the instant the speculators\r\nowned them. Paper money was freely issued upon these estimates of value,\r\nto be again paid to the government for more lands at $1.25. But now\r\ngold and silver must be found; and nothing but actual labor could find\r\ngold and silver. A further stream of true wealth was summoned from the\r\nEast, already denuded, as it was, of all the surplus it had ready to be\r\ninvested upon mere expectation. Enormous rates were now paid for real\r\nmoney. But of the real money necessary to make good the paper bubble\r\npromises of the speculators not one-tenth part really existed. Banks\r\ncould neither make their debtors pay in gold and silver, nor pay their\r\nown notes in gold and silver. So they suspended.\r\n\r\nThe great and long concealed devastation of physical wealth and of the\r\naccumulation of legitimate labor, by premature improvements and costly\r\npersonal living, became now quickly apparent. Fancied wealth sank out of\r\nsight. Paper symbols of new cities and towns, canals and roads, were not\r\nonly without value, but they were now plainly seen to be so. Rich men\r\nbecame poor men. The prices of articles in which there had been\r\nspeculation sank in the reaction far below their true value. The\r\nindustrious and the prudent, who had given their labor and their real\r\nwealth for paper promises issued upon the credit of seemingly assured\r\nfortunes, suffered at once with men whose fortunes had never been\r\nanything better than the delusions of their hope and imagination.\r\n\r\nIt is now plain enough that to recover from this crisis was a work of\r\nphysical reparation to which must go time, industry, and frugality.\r\nThere was folly in every effort to retain and use as valuable assets\r\nthe investments in companies and banks whose usefulness, if it had ever\r\nbegun, was now ended. There was folly in every effort to conceal from\r\nthe world by words of hopefulness the fact that the imagined values in\r\nnew cities and garden lands had disappeared in a rude disenchantment as\r\ncomplete as that of Abou-Hassan in the Thousand and One Nights, or that\r\nof Sly, the tinker, left untold in the Taming of the Shrew. Their sites\r\nwere no more than wild lands, whose value must wait the march of\r\nAmerican progress, fast enough indeed to the rest of the world, but slow\r\nas the snail to the wild pacing of the speculators. Every pretense of a\r\npolitician, whether in or out of the senate chamber, that the government\r\ncould by devices of financiering avoid this necessity of long physical\r\nrepair, was either folly or wickedness. And of this folly or even\r\nwickedness there was no lack in the anxious spring and summer of 1837.\r\n\r\nThere had already occurred in many quarters that misery which is borne\r\nby the humbler producers of wealth not for their own consumption, but\r\nsimply for exchange, whose earnings are not increased to meet the\r\ninflation of prices upon which traders and speculators are accumulating\r\napparent fortunes and spending them as if they were real. On February\r\n14, 1837, several thousand people met in front of the City Hall in New\r\nYork under a call of men whom the \"Commercial Advertiser\" described as\r\n\"Jackson Jacobins.\" The call was headed: \"Bread, meat, rent, fuel!\r\nTheir prices must come down!\" It invited the presence of \"all friends of\r\nhumanity determined to resist monopolists and extortionists.\" A very\r\nrespectable meeting about high prices had been held two or three weeks\r\nbefore at the Broadway Tabernacle. The meeting in the City Hall Park,\r\nwith a mixture of wisdom and folly, urged the prohibition of bank-notes\r\nunder $100, and called for gold and silver; and then denounced landlords\r\nand dealers in provisions. The excitement of the meeting was followed by\r\na riot, in which a great flour warehouse was gutted. The rioters were\r\nchiefly foreigners and few in number; nor were the promoters of the\r\nmeeting involved in the riot. The military were called out; and Eli\r\nHart & Co., the unfortunate flour merchants, issued a card pointing out\r\nwith grim truth \"that the destruction of the article cannot have a\r\ntendency to reduce the price.\"\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the treasury surplus to the States precipitated the\r\ncrash. The first quarter's payment of $9,367,000 was made on January 1,\r\n1837. There was disturbance in taking this large sum of money from the\r\ndeposit banks. Loans had to be called in, and the accommodation to\r\nbusiness men lessened for the time. There was speculative disturbance in\r\nthe receipt of the moneys by the state depositories. There was\r\napprehension for the next payment on April 1, which was accomplished\r\nwith still greater disturbance, and after the crisis had begun. The\r\ncalls for gold and silver, begun under the specie circular, and the\r\ndisturbances caused by these distributions, were increased by financial\r\npressure in England, whose money aids to America were but partly shown\r\nby the shipments of gold and silver already mentioned. The extravagance\r\nof living had been shown in foreign importations for consumption in\r\nluxury, to meet which there had gone varied promises to pay, and\r\nsecurities whose true value depended upon the true and not the apparent\r\ncreation of wealth in America. Before the middle of March the money\r\nexcitement at Manchester was great; and to the United States alone, it\r\nwas then declared, attention was directed for larger remittances and for\r\nspecie. The merchants of Liverpool about the same time sent a memorial\r\nto the chancellor of the exchequer saying \"that the distress of the\r\nmercantile interest is intense beyond example, and that it is rapidly\r\nextending to all ranks and conditions of the community, so as to\r\nthreaten irretrievable ruin in all directions, involving the prudent\r\nwith the imprudent.\" The \"London Times\" on April 10, 1837, said that\r\ngreat distress and pressure had been produced in every branch of\r\nnational industry, and that the calamity had never been exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe cry was quickly reëchoed from America. Commercial failures began in\r\nNew York about April 1. By April 8 nearly one hundred failures had\r\noccurred in that city,--five of foreign and exchange brokers, thirty of\r\ndry-goods jobbers, sixteen of commission houses, twenty-eight of\r\nreal-estate speculators, eight of stock brokers, and several others.\r\nThree days later the failures had reached one hundred and twenty-eight.\r\nProvisions, wages, rents, everything, as the \"New York Herald\" on that\r\nday announced, were coming down. Within a few days more the failures\r\nwere too numerous to be specially noticed; and before the end of the\r\nmonth the rest of the country was in a like condition. The prostration\r\nin the newer cotton States was peculiarly complete. Their staple was now\r\ndown to ten cents a pound; within a year it had been worth twenty. All\r\nother staples fell enormously in price.\r\n\r\nLater in April the merchants of New York met. Instead of condemning\r\ntheir own folly, they resolved, in a silly fury, that the disaster was\r\ndue to government interference with the business and commercial\r\noperations of the country by requiring land to be paid for in specie\r\ninstead of paper, to its destruction of the Bank, and to its\r\nsubstitution of a metallic for a credit currency. A committee of fifty,\r\nincluding Thomas Denny, Henry Parish, Elisha Riggs, and many others\r\nwhose names are still honored in New York, was appointed to remonstrate\r\nwith the president. \"What constitutional or legal justification,\" it was\r\nseriously demanded, \"can Martin Van Buren offer to the people of the\r\nUnited States for having brought upon them all their present\r\ndifficulties?\" The continuance of the specie circular, they said, was\r\nmore high-handed tyranny than that which had cost Charles I. his crown\r\nand his head. On May 3 the committee visited Washington and told the\r\nPresident that their real estate had depreciated forty millions, their\r\nstocks twenty millions, their immense amounts of merchandise in\r\nwarehouses thirty per cent. They piteously said to him, \"The noble city\r\nwhich we represent lies prostrate in despair, its credit blighted, its\r\nindustry paralyzed, and without a hope beaming through the darkness,\r\nunless\"--and here we might suppose they would have added, \"unless\r\nAmericans at once stop spending money which has not been earned, and\r\nrepair the ruin by years of sensible industry and strict economy.\" But\r\nthe conclusion of the merchants was that the darkness must continue\r\nunless relief came from Washington. It was unjust, they said, to\r\nattribute the evils to excessive development of mercantile enterprise;\r\nthey flowed instead from \"that unwise system which aimed at the\r\nsubstitution of a metallic for a paper currency.\" The error of their\r\nrulers \"had produced a wider desolation than the pestilence which\r\ndepopulated our streets, or the conflagration which laid them in ashes.\"\r\nIn the opinion of these sapient gentlemen of business, it was the\r\nrequirement that the United States, in selling Western lands to\r\nspeculators, should be paid in real and not in nominal money, which had\r\nprostrated in despair the metropolis of the country. They asked for a\r\nwithdrawal of the specie circular, for a suspension of government suits\r\nagainst importers on bonds given for duties, for an extra session of\r\nCongress to pass Clay's bill for the distribution of the land revenue\r\namong the States, and for the re-chartering of the Bank. Never did men\r\nout of their heads with fright propose more foolish attempts at relief\r\nthan some of these. But the folly, as will be seen, seized statesmen of\r\nthe widest experience as well as frenzied merchants. The President's\r\nanswer was dignified, but \"brief and explicit.\" To the insolent\r\nsuggestion that Jackson's financial measures had been more destructive\r\nthan fire or pestilence, he calmly reminded them that he had made fully\r\nknown, before he was elected, his own approval of those measures; that\r\nknowing this the people had deliberately chosen him; and that he would\r\nstill adhere to those measures. The specie circular should be neither\r\nrepealed nor modified. Such indulgence in enforcing custom-house bonds\r\nwould be allowed as the law permitted. The emergency did not, he\r\nthought, justify an extra session. Nicholas Biddle called on Van Buren;\r\nand many were disgusted that in the presence of this arch enemy the\r\npresident remained \"profoundly silent upon the great and interesting\r\ntopics of the day.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren's resolution to face the storm without either the aid or the\r\nembarrassment of the early presence of Congress he was soon compelled to\r\nabandon. Within a few days of the return of the merchants to New York,\r\nthat city sent the President an appalling reply. On May 10 its banks\r\nsuspended payment of their notes in coin. A few days before some banks\r\nin lesser cities of the Southwest had stopped. On the day after the New\r\nYork suspension, the banks of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Albany, Hartford,\r\nNew Haven, and Providence followed. On the 12th the banks of Boston and\r\nMobile, on the 13th those of New Orleans, and on the 17th those of\r\nCharleston and Cincinnati fell in the same crash. There was now simply a\r\ngeneral bankruptcy. Men would no longer meet their promises to pay,\r\nbecause no longer could new paper promises pay off old ones. No longer\r\nwould men surrender physical wealth safely in their hands for the\r\nexpectation of wealth to be created by the future progress of the\r\ncountry. But men with perfectly real physical wealth in their\r\nstorehouses, which they could not themselves use, were also in practical\r\nbankruptcy because of their commercial debts most prudently incurred.\r\nThe natural exchange of their own goods for goods which they or their\r\ncreditors might use was obstructed by the utter discredit of paper\r\nmoney, and by the almost complete disappearance of gold and silver.\r\nExtra sessions of state legislatures were called to devise relief. The\r\nbanks' suspension of specie payment in New York was within a few days\r\nlegalized by the legislature of that State. On May 12 the secretary of\r\nthe treasury directed government collectors themselves to keep public\r\nmoneys where the deposit banks had suspended.\r\n\r\nFor banks holding the public moneys sank with the others. And it was\r\nthis which compelled Van Buren in one matter to yield to the storm. On\r\nMay 15 he issued a proclamation for an extra session of Congress to meet\r\non the first Monday of September. It would meet, the proclamation said,\r\nto consider \"great and weighty matters.\" No scheme of relief was\r\nsuggested. The locking up of public moneys in suspended banks made\r\nnecessary some relief to the government itself. It was, perhaps, well\r\nenough that excited and terrified people, casting about for a remedy,\r\nshould, until their wits were somewhat restored, be soothed by assurance\r\nthat the great council of the nation would, at any rate, discuss the\r\nsituation. Moreover, it was wise to secure time, that most potent ally\r\nof the statesman. Within the three months and a half to elapse, Van\r\nBuren, like a wise ruler, thought the true nature of the calamity would\r\nbecome more apparent; proposals of remedies might be scrutinized; and\r\nthoughtless or superficial men might weary of their own absurd\r\nproposals, or the people might fully perceive their absurdity.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer popular excitement ran very high against the\r\nadministration. The Whig papers declared it to be \"the melancholy truth,\r\nthe awful truth,\" that the administration did nothing to relieve, but\r\neverything to distress the commercial community. Abbot Lawrence, one of\r\nthe richest and most influential citizens of Boston, told a great\r\nmeeting, on May 17, that there was no other people on the face of God's\r\nearth that were so abused, cheated, plundered, and trampled on by their\r\nrulers; that the government exacted impossibilities. No overt act, he\r\nsaid, with almost a sinister suggestion, ought to be committed until the\r\nlaws of self-preservation compelled a forcible resistance; but the time\r\nmight come when the crew must seize the ship. The friends of the\r\nadministration sought, indeed, to stem the tide; and a series of\r\nskillfully devised popular gatherings was held, very probably inspired\r\nby Van Buren, who highly estimated such organized appeals to popular\r\nsentiment. In Philadelphia a great meeting denounced the bank\r\nsuspensions and the issue of small notes as devices in the interest of a\r\nforeign conspiracy to throw silver coin out of circulation and export it\r\nto Europe, to raise the prices of necessaries, and recommence a course\r\nof gambling under the name of speculation and trade, in which the people\r\nmust be the victims, and \"the foreign and home desperadoes\" the gainers.\r\nThe meeting declared for a metallic currency. \"We hereby pledge our\r\nlives, if necessary,\" they said, \"for the support of the same.\" Later,\r\non May 22, there was in the same city a large gathering at Independence\r\nSquare, which solemnly called upon the administration \"manfully,\r\nfearlessly, and at all hazards to go on collecting the public revenues\r\nand paying the public dues in gold and silver.\" Their forefathers, who\r\nfought for their liberties, the framers of our Constitution, the\r\npatriarchs whose memory they revered, were, with a funny mixture of\r\ntruth and falsehood, declared to have been hard-money men. A week later,\r\na great meeting in Baltimore approved the specie circular, and urged its\r\nfearless execution, \"notwithstanding the senseless clamors of the\r\nBritish party;\" for the crisis, they said, was \"a struggle of the\r\nvirtuous and industrious portions of the community against bank\r\nadvocates and the enemies to good morals and republicanism.\" Protests\r\nwere elsewhere made against forcing small notes into circulation. Paper\r\nhad, however, to be used, for there was nothing else. Barter must go on,\r\neven upon the most flimsy tokens. In New York one saw, as were seen\r\ntwenty-four years later, bits of paper like this: \"The bearer will be\r\nentitled to fifty cents' value in refreshments at the Auction Hotel, 123\r\nand 125 Water Street. New York, May, 1837. Charles Redabock.\" In\r\nTallahassee a committee of citizens was appointed to print bank tickets\r\nfor purposes of change. In Easton the currency had a more specific\r\nbasis. One of the tokens read: \"This ticket will hold good for a sheep's\r\ntongue, two crackers, and a glass of red-eye.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled, the country had cried itself, if not to sleep,\r\nat least to seeming quiet. The sun had not ceased to rise and set.\r\nAlthough merchants and bankers were prostrate with anxiety or even in\r\nirremediable ruin; although thousands of clerks and laborers were out of\r\nemployment or earning absurdly low wages,--for near New York hundreds\r\nof laborers were rejected who applied for work at four dollars a month\r\nand board; although honest frontiersmen found themselves hopelessly\r\nisolated in a wilderness,--for the frontier had suddenly shrunk far\r\nbehind them,--still the harvest had been good, the masses of men had\r\nbeen at work, and economy had prevailed. The desperation was over. But\r\nthere was a profound melancholy, from which a recovery was to come only\r\ntoo soon to be lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT.--SUB-TREASURY BILL\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Buren's bearing in the crisis was admirable. Even those who have\r\ntreated him with animosity or contempt do not here refuse him high\r\npraise. \"In this one question,\" says Von Holst, \"he really evinced\r\ncourage, firmness, and statesmanlike insight.... Van Buren bore the\r\nstorm bravely. He repelled all reproaches with decision, but with no\r\nbitterness.... Van Buren unquestionably merited well of the country,\r\nbecause he refused his coöperation, in accordance with the guardianship\r\nprinciple of the old absolutisms, to accustom the people of the Republic\r\nalso to see the government enter as a saving _deus ex machina_ in every\r\ncalamity brought about by their own fault and folly.... Van Buren had\r\nwon a brilliant victory and placed his countrymen under lasting\r\nobligations to him.\"[13]\r\n\r\nVan Buren met the extra session with a message which marks the zenith of\r\nhis political wisdom. It is one of the greatest of American state\r\npapers. With clear, unflinching, and unanswerable logic he faced the\r\ncrisis. There was no effort to evade the questions put to him, or to\r\ndivert public attention from the true issue. The government could not,\r\nhe showed, help people earn their living; but it could refuse to aid the\r\ndeception that paper was gold, and the delusion that value could arise\r\nwithout labor. The masterly argument seems long to a sauntering reader;\r\nbut it treated a difficult question which had to be answered by the\r\nmultitudes of a democracy many of whom were pinched and excited by\r\npersonal distresses and anxiety and who were sure to read it. Few\r\nepisodes in our political history give one more exalted appreciation of\r\nthe good sense of the American masses, than that, in this stress of\r\nnational suffering, a skillful politician should have appealed to them,\r\nnot even sweetening the truth, but resisting with direct and painful\r\nsobriety their angry and natural impulses; this, too, when most of the\r\ntalented and popular leaders were promoting, rather than reducing or\r\ndiverting the heated folly of the time.\r\n\r\nVan Buren quietly began by saying that the law required the secretary of\r\nthe treasury to deposit public moneys only in banks that paid their\r\nnotes in specie. All the banks had stopped such payment. It was obvious\r\ntherefore that some other custody of public moneys must be provided, and\r\nit was for this that he had summoned Congress. He then began what was\r\nreally an address to the people. He pointed out that the government had\r\nnot caused, and that it could not cure, the profound commercial\r\ndistemper. Antecedent causes had been stimulated by the enormous\r\ninflations of bank currency and other credits, and among them the many\r\nmillions of foreign loans, and the lavish accommodations extended \"by\r\nforeign dealers to our merchants.\" Thence had come the spirit of\r\nreckless speculation, and from that a foreign debt of more than thirty\r\nmillions; the extension to traders in the interior of credits for\r\nsupplies greatly beyond the wants of the people; the investment of\r\nthirty-nine and a half millions in unproductive public lands; the\r\ncreation of debts to an almost countless amount for real estate in\r\nexisting or anticipated cities and villages; the expenditure of immense\r\nsums in improvements ruinously improvident; the diversion to other\r\npursuits of labor that should have gone to agriculture, so that this\r\nfirst of agricultural countries had imported two millions of dollars\r\nworth of grain in the first six months of 1837; and the rapid growth of\r\nluxurious habits founded too often on merely fancied wealth. These evils\r\nhad been aggravated by the great loss of capital in the famous fire at\r\nNew York in December, 1835, a loss whose effects, though real, were not\r\nat once apparent because of the shifting and postponement of the burdens\r\nthrough facilities of credit, by the disturbance which the transfers of\r\npublic moneys in the distribution among the States caused, and by\r\nnecessities of foreign creditors which made them seek to withdraw specie\r\nfrom the United States. He pointed out the unprecedented expansion of\r\ncredit in Great Britain at the same time, and, with the redundancy of\r\npaper currency[14] there, the rise of adventurous and unwholesome\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nTo the demand for a reëstablishment of a national bank, he replied that\r\nquite a contrary thing must be done; that the fiscal concerns of the\r\ngovernment must be separated from those of individuals or corporations;\r\nthat to create such a bank would be to disregard the popular will twice\r\nsolemnly and unequivocally expressed; that the same motives would\r\noperate on the administrators of a national as on those of state banks;\r\nthat the Bank of the United States had not prevented former and similar\r\nembarrassments, and that the Bank of England had but lately failed in\r\nits own land to prevent serious abuses of credit. He knew indeed of loud\r\nand serious complaint because the government did not now aid commercial\r\nexchange. But this was no part of its duty. It was not the province of\r\ngovernment to aid individuals in the transfer of their funds otherwise\r\nthan through the facilities of the post-office. As justly might the\r\ngovernment be asked to transport merchandise. These were operations of\r\ntrade to be conducted by those who were interested in them. Throughout\r\nEurope domestic as well as foreign exchanges were carried on by private\r\nhouses, and often, if not generally, without the assistance of banks.\r\nOur own exchanges ought to be carried on by private enterprise and\r\ncompetition, without legislative assistance, free from the influence of\r\npolitical agitation, and from the neglect, partiality, injustice, and\r\noppression unavoidably attending the interference of government with the\r\nproper concerns of individuals. His own views, Van Buren declared, were\r\nunchanged. Before his election he had distinctly apprised the people\r\nthat he would not aid in the reëstablishment of a national bank. His\r\nconviction had been strengthened that such a bank meant a concentrated\r\nmoney power hostile to the spirit and permanency of our republican\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nHe then turned to those state banks which had held government deposits.\r\nAt all times they had held some of the federal moneys, and since 1833\r\nthey had held the whole. Since that year the utmost security had been\r\nrequired from them for such moneys; but when lately called upon to pay\r\nthe surplus to the States, they had, while curtailing their discounts\r\nand increasing the general distress, been with the other banks fatally\r\ninvolved in the revulsion. Under these circumstances it was a solemn\r\nduty to inquire whether the evils inherent in any connection between the\r\ngovernment and banks of issue were not such as to require a divorce.\r\nOught the moneys taken from the people for public uses longer to be\r\ndeposited in banks and thence to be loaned for the profit of private\r\npersons? Ought not the collection, safe-keeping, transfer, and\r\ndisbursement of public moneys to be managed by public officers? The\r\npublic revenues must be limited to public expenses so that there should\r\nbe no great surplus. The care of the moneys inevitably accumulated from\r\ntime to time would involve expense; but this was a trifling\r\nconsideration in so important a matter. Personally it would be agreeable\r\nto him to be free from concern in the custody and disbursement of the\r\npublic revenue. Not indeed that he would shrink from a proper official\r\nresponsibility, but because he firmly believed the capacity of the\r\nexecutive for usefulness was in no degree promoted by the possession of\r\npatronage not actually necessary. But he was clear that the connection\r\nof the executive with powerful moneyed institutions, capable of\r\nministering to the interests of men in points where they were most\r\naccessible to corruption, was more liable to abuse than his\r\nconstitutional agency in the appointment and control of the few public\r\nofficers required by the proposed plan.\r\n\r\nThus was announced the independent treasury scheme, the divorce of bank\r\nand state, the famous achievement of Van Buren's presidency. He argued\r\nbesides elaborately in favor of the specie circular. An individual\r\ncould, if he pleased, accept payment in a paper promise or in any other\r\nway as he saw fit. But a public servant should in exchange for public\r\ndomain take only what was universally deemed valuable. He ought not to\r\nhave a discretion to measure the value of mere promises. The $9,367,200\r\nin the treasury for deposit with the States in October, or rather for a\r\npermanent distribution to them, he desired to retain for federal\r\nnecessities. This would doubtless inconvenience States which had relied\r\non the federal donation; but as the United States needed the money to\r\nmeet its own obligations, there was neither justice nor expediency in\r\ngenerously giving it away. Van Buren here left the defensive with a\r\nmenace to the banks that a bankruptcy law for corporations suspending\r\nspecie payment might impose a salutary check on the issues of paper\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe President finally spoke in words which seem golden to all who share\r\nhis view of the ends of government. \"Those who look to the action of\r\nthis government,\" he said, \"for specific aid to the citizen to relieve\r\nembarrassments arising from losses by revulsions in commerce and credit,\r\nlose sight of the ends for which it was created, and the powers with\r\nwhich it is clothed. It was established to give security to us all, in\r\nour lawful and honorable pursuits, under the lasting safeguard of\r\nrepublican institutions. It was not intended to confer special favors on\r\nindividuals, or on any classes of them; to create systems of\r\nagriculture, manufactures, or trade; or to engage in them, either\r\nseparately or in connection with individual citizens or\r\norganizations.... All communities are apt to look to government for too\r\nmuch.... We are prone to do so especially at periods of sudden\r\nembarrassment and distress.... The less government interferes with\r\nprivate pursuits, the better for the general prosperity. It is not its\r\nlegitimate object to make men rich, or to repair by direct grants of\r\nmoney or legislation in favor of particular pursuits, losses not\r\nincurred in the public service.\" To avoid unnecessary interference with\r\nsuch pursuits would be far more beneficial than efforts to assist\r\nlimited interests, efforts eagerly, but perhaps naturally, sought for\r\nunder temporary pressure. Congress and himself, Van Buren closed by\r\nsaying, acted for a people to whom the truth, however unpromising, could\r\nalways be spoken with safety, and who, in the phrase of which he was\r\nfond, were sure never to desert a public functionary honestly laboring\r\nfor the public good.\r\n\r\nAn angry and almost terrible outburst received this plain, honest, and\r\nwise declaration that the people must repair their own disasters without\r\npaternal help of government; and that, rather than to promote the\r\nextension of credit with public moneys, the crisis ought to afford means\r\nof departing forever from that policy. Most of the able men who to this\r\ngeneration have seemed the larger statesmen of the day, joined with\r\npassionate declamation in the furious gust of folly. It was a favorite\r\ndelusion that government was a separate entity which could help the\r\npeople, and not a mere agency, simply using wealth and power which the\r\npeople must themselves create. Webster, in a speech at Madison, Indiana,\r\non June 1, 1837, professed his conscientious convictions that all the\r\ndisasters had proceeded from \"the measures of the general government in\r\nrelation to the currency.\" He ridiculed the idea that the people had\r\nhelped cause them. The people, he thought, had no lesson to learn.\r\n\"Over-trading, over-buying, over-selling, over-speculation,\r\nover-production,\"--these, he said, were terms he \"could not very well\r\nunderstand.\" In his speech of December, 1836, on the specie circular, he\r\nhad given a leonine laugh at the idea of there being inflation. If he\r\nwere asked, he said, what kept up the value of money \"in this vast and\r\nsudden expansion and increase of it,\" he should answer that it was kept\r\nup \"by an equally vast and sudden increase in the property of the\r\ncountry.\" That this amazing utterance upon the dynamics of national\r\neconomy might be clear, he added that the vast and sudden increase was\r\n\"in the value of that property intrinsic as well as marketable.\" No\r\nspeculator of the day said a more foolish thing than did this towering\r\nstatesman. There were, he admitted, \"other minor causes,\" but they were\r\n\"not worth enumerating.\" \"The great and immediate origin of the evil\"\r\nwas \"disturbances in the exchange ... caused by the agency of the\r\ngovernment itself.\" At the extra session Webster described the shock\r\ncaused him by the President's \"disregard for the public distress,\" by\r\nhis \"exclusive concern for the interest of government and revenue, by\r\nhis refusal to prescribe for the sickness and disease of society,\" by\r\nthe separation he would draw \"between the interests of the government\r\nand the interests of the people.\" For his part he would be warm and\r\ngenerous in his statesmanship. He resisted the bill to suspend the\r\n\"deposit\" with the States; he would in the coming October pay out the\r\nlast installment, stricken though the treasury was. He would again\r\nsweeten the popular palate with government manna, bitter as it had\r\nproved itself to the belly. It was the duty of the government, he said,\r\nto aid in exchanges by establishing a paper currency; he and those with\r\nhim preferred the long-tried, well-approved practice of the government\r\nto letting Benton, as he said, \"embrace us in his gold and silver arms\r\nand hug us to his hard money breast.\" As if this were not a time for\r\nsoberness over its shameful abuses, credit, and the banks and bank-notes\r\nwhich aided it were almost apotheosized. At St. Louis in the summer,\r\nWebster, in a speech which he did not include in his collected works,\r\nsaid that help must come \"from the government of the United States, from\r\nthence alone;\" adding, \"Upon this I risk my political reputation, my\r\nhonor, my all.... He who expects to live to see all these twenty-six\r\nStates resuming specie payments in regular succession once more, may\r\nexpect to see the restoration of the Jews. Never! He will die without\r\nthe sight.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams had told his friends at home that the distribution of\r\nthe public moneys among the state banks was the most pernicious cause of\r\nthe disaster, although, differing from Webster, he admitted that \"the\r\nabuse of credit, especially by the agency of banks,\" and the\r\nunrestrained pursuit of individual wealth, were the proximate causes of\r\nthe disaster, for history had testified\r\n\r\n  \"Peace to corrupt, no less than war to waste.\"\r\n\r\nHe would punish suspension of specie payments by a bank with a\r\nforfeiture of its charter and the imprisonment of its president and\r\nofficers. A national bank, he said, was \"the only practicable expedient\r\nfor restoring and maintaining specie payments.\" In the extra session he\r\nshowed that the deposit banks of the South already held more money of\r\nthe government than their States would receive, if the last installment\r\nof distribution should be paid, while the Northern banks held far less\r\nof that money than the Northern States were to receive. He denounced as\r\na Southern measure the proposition to postpone this piece of\r\nrecklessness. Should the Northern States hail with shouts of Hosanna\r\n\"this evanescence of their funds from their treasuries,\" or be\r\n\"humbugged out of their vested rights by a howl of frenzy against\r\nNicholas Biddle,\" or be mystified out of their money and out of their\r\nsenses by a Hark follow! against all banks, or by a summons to Doctors'\r\nCommons for a divorce of bank and state?\r\n\r\nThat skillful political weathercock, Caleb Cushing, told his\r\nconstituents at Lowell that private banking was the \"shinplaster\r\nsystem;\" and asked whether we wished to have men who, like the\r\nRothschilds, make \"peace or war as they choose, and wield at will the\r\ndestiny of empires.\" The plan of the administration was like that of \"a\r\ncowardly master of a sinking ship, to take possession of the long boat\r\nand provisions, cut off, and leave the ship's company and passengers to\r\ntheir fate.\" To the plausible cry of separating bank and state he would\r\nanswer, \"Why not separate court and state ... or law and state ... or\r\ncustom-house and state.\" It was \"the new nostrum of political quackery.\"\r\nClay delivered a famous speech in the Senate on September 25, 1837. He\r\nwas appalled at the heartlessness of the administration. \"The people,\r\nthe States, and their banks,\" he said in the favorite cant of the time,\r\n\"are left to shift for themselves,\" as if that were not the very thing\r\nfor them to do. We were all, he said,--\"people, States, Union,\r\nbanks, ... all entitled to the protecting care of a parental\r\ngovernment.\" He cried out against \"a selfish solicitude for the\r\ngovernment itself, but a cold and heartless insensibility to the\r\nsufferings of a bleeding people.\" The substitution of an exclusive\r\nmetallic currency was \"forbidden by the principles of eternal justice.\"\r\nFor his part he saw no adequate remedy which did \"not comprehend a\r\nnational bank as an essential part of it.\" In banking corporations,\r\nindeed, \"the interests of the rich and poor are happily blended;\" nor\r\nshould we encourage here private bankers, Hopes and Barings and\r\nRothschilds and Hottinguers, \"whose vast overgrown capitals, possessed\r\nby the rich exclusively of the poor, control the destiny of nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill for the independent treasury was firmly pressed by the\r\nadministration. It did not deceive the people with any pretense that\r\nbanks and paper money would stand in lieu of industry, economy, and good\r\nsense. The summer elections, then far more numerous than now, had, as\r\nClay warningly pointed out, gone heavily against Van Buren. The bill\r\npassed the Senate, 26 to 20. In the House it was defeated. Upon the\r\nelection of speaker, the administration candidate, James K. Polk, had\r\nhad 116 votes to 103 for John Bell. But this very moderate majority was\r\ninsecure. A break in the administration ranks was promptly shown by the\r\ndefeat, for printers to the House, of Francis P. Blair and his partner,\r\nwho in their paper, the \"Washington Globe,\" had firmly supported the\r\nhard money and anti-bank policy. They received only 107 votes, about\r\nfifteen Democrats uniting with the Whigs to defeat them. Van Buren was\r\nunable to educate all his party to his own firm, clear-sighted views.\r\nThere was formed a small party of \"conservatives,\" Democrats who took\r\nwhat seemed, and what for the time was, the popular course. The\r\nindependent treasury bill was defeated in the House by 120 to 106.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's proposal was carried, however, to postpone the \"deposite,\"\r\nas it was called, the gift as it was, of the fourth installment of the\r\nsurplus. On October 1, Webster and Clay led the seventeen senators who\r\ninsisted upon the folly of the national treasury in its destitution\r\nplaying the magnificent donor, and further debauching the States with\r\nstreams of pretended wealth. Twenty-eight senators voted for the bill;\r\nand in the House it was carried by 118 to 105, John Quincy Adams heading\r\nthe negative vote.\r\n\r\nThe administration further proposed the issue of $10,000,000 in treasury\r\nnotes. It was a measure strictly of temporary relief. Gold and silver\r\nhad disappeared; bank-notes were discredited. The government, whose gold\r\nand silver the banks would not pay out, was disabled from meeting its\r\ncurrent obligations; and the treasury notes were proposed to meet the\r\nnecessity. They were not to be legal tender, but interest-bearing\r\nobligations in denominations not less than $50, to be merely receivable\r\nfor all public dues, and thus to gain a credit which would secure their\r\ncirculation. This natural and moderate measure was assailed by those who\r\nwere lauding a paper currency to the skies. The radical difference was\r\nignored between a general currency of small as well as large bills,\r\nwithout intrinsic value, adopted for all time, and a limited and\r\nperfectly secure government loan, to be freely taken or rejected by the\r\npeople, in bills of large amounts, to meet a serious but brief\r\nembarrassment. \"Who expected,\" said Webster in the Senate, \"that in the\r\nfifth year of the experiment for reforming the currency, and bringing it\r\nto an absolute gold and silver circulation, the Treasury Department\r\nwould be found recommending to us a regular emission of paper money?\" He\r\nvoted, however, for the bill, the only negative votes in the Senate\r\nbeing given by Clay and four others. In the House it was carried by 127\r\nto 98.\r\n\r\nSuch was the substantial work of the extra session. To the experience of\r\nthat crisis and the wisdom with which it was met may not improbably be\r\nascribed the hard-money leaven which, thirty or forty years later,\r\nprevented the great disaster of further paper inflation, and brought the\r\ncountry to a currency which, if not the best, is a currency of coin and\r\nof redeemable paper, whose value, apart from the legal-tender notes\r\nleft us by the war and the decision of the Supreme Court, depends upon\r\nthe best of securities, coin or government bonds, deposited in the\r\ntreasury, and a currency whose amount may therefore safely be left to\r\nthe natural operations of trade.\r\n\r\nClay's appeal for a great banking institution, which should accomplish\r\nby magic the results of popular labor and saving, was met by a vote of\r\nthe House, 123 to 91, that it was inexpedient to charter a national\r\nbank, many voting against a bank who had already voted against an\r\nindependent treasury. The Senate also resolved against a national bank\r\nby 31 to 14, six senators who had voted against an independent treasury\r\nvoting also against a bank. The temporary expedient adopted by the\r\ntreasury on the suspension of the banks was therefore continued, and\r\npublic moneys were kept in the hands of public officers.\r\n\r\nCalhoun now rejoined the Democratic party. It was only the year before\r\nhe had denounced it as \"a powerful faction held together by the hopes of\r\npublic plunder;\" and early in this very year he had referred to the\r\nremoval of the deposits as an act fit for \"the days of Pompey or Cæsar,\"\r\nand had declared that even a Roman Senate would not have passed the\r\nexpunging resolution \"until the times of Caligula and Nero.\" But Van\r\nBuren, Calhoun now said, had been driven to his position; nor would he\r\nleave the position for that reason. He referred to the strict\r\nconstruction of the powers of the government involved in the divorce of\r\nbank and state. There was no suggestion that Van Buren had become a\r\nconvert to nullification. But Calhoun could with consistency support Van\r\nBuren. The independent treasury scheme was plainly far different from\r\nthe removal of the deposits from one great bank to many lesser ones. The\r\nreasons for political exasperation had besides disappeared. Van Buren\r\nwas chief among the _beati possidentes_, and could not for years be\r\ndisturbed. His tact and skill left open no personal feud; he had not yet\r\nconferred the title of Cæsar; no successor to himself was yet named by\r\nany clear designation. Calhoun joined Silas Wright and the other\r\nadministration senators; but he still maintained a grim and independent\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThe extra session ended on October 16. Besides the issuance of\r\n$10,000,000 in treasury notes and the postponement of the distribution\r\namong the States, the only measure adopted for relief was a law\r\npermitting indulgence of payment to importers upon custom-house bonds.\r\nAs those payments were to be made in specie, and as specie had left\r\ncirculation, it was proper that the United States as a creditor should\r\nexhibit the same leniency which was wise and necessary on the part of\r\nother creditors.\r\n\r\nCommercial distress had now materially abated, although many of its\r\nwounds were still deep and unhealed. Before the regular session began in\r\nDecember, substantial progress was made towards specie payments. The\r\nprice of gold in New York, which had ruled at a premium of eight and\r\nseven eighths per cent., had fallen to five. On October 20 the banks of\r\nNew York, after waiting until Congress rose, to meet the wishes of the\r\nUnited States Bank and its associates in Philadelphia, now invited\r\nrepresentatives from all the banks to meet in New York on November 27 to\r\nprepare for specie payment. At this meeting the New York banks proposed\r\nresumption on March 1, 1838, but they were defeated; and a resolution to\r\nresume on July 1 was defeated by the votes of Pennsylvania and all the\r\nNew England States except Maine (which was divided), together with New\r\nJersey, Delaware, Maryland, South Carolina, and Indiana. Virginia, Ohio,\r\nGeorgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and the District of Columbia, with\r\nNew York, made the minority. An adjournment was taken to the second\r\nWednesday in April, the banks being urged meanwhile to prepare for\r\nspecie payments.\r\n\r\nThe fall as well as the summer elections had been most disastrous for\r\nthe Democrats. New York, which the year before had given Van Buren\r\nnearly 30,000 plurality, was now overwhelmingly Whig. The Van Buren\r\nparty began to be called the Loco-focos, in derision of the fancied\r\nextravagance of their financial doctrines. The Loco-foco or Equal Rights\r\nparty proper was originally a division of the Democrats, strongly\r\nanti-monopolist in their opinions, and especially hostile to\r\nbanks,--not only government banks but all banks,--which enjoyed the\r\nprivileges then long confirmed by special and exclusive charters. In the\r\nfall of 1835 some of the Democratic candidates in New York were\r\nespecially obnoxious to the anti-monopolists of the party. When the\r\nmeeting to regularly confirm the nominations made in committee was\r\ncalled at Tammany Hall, the anti-monopolist Democrats sought to capture\r\nthe meeting by a rush up the main stairs. The regulars, however, showed\r\nthemselves worthy of their regularity by reaching the room up the back\r\nstairs. In a general scrimmage the gas was put out. The\r\nanti-monopolists, perhaps used to the devices to prevent meetings which\r\nmight be hostile, were ready with candles and loco-foco matches. The\r\nhall was quickly illuminated; and the anti-monopolists claimed that they\r\nhad defeated the nominations. The regulars were successful, however, at\r\nthe election; and they and the Whigs dubbed the anti-monopolists the\r\nLoco-foco men. The latter in 1836 organized the Equal Rights party, and\r\ndeclared it an imperative duty of the people \"to recur to first\r\nprinciples.\" Their \"declaration of rights\" might well have been drawn a\r\nfew years later by a student of Spencer's \"Social Statics.\" The law,\r\nthey said, ought to do no more than restrain each man from committing\r\naggressions on the equal rights of other men; they declared \"unqualified\r\nhostility to bank-notes and paper money as a circulating medium,\" and to\r\nall special grants by the legislature. A great cry was raised against\r\nthem as dangerous and incendiary fanatics. The Democratic press, except\r\nthe \"Evening Post,\" edited by William Cullen Bryant, turned violently\r\nupon the seceders. There was the same horror of them as the English at\r\nalmost the very time had of the Chartists, and which in our time is\r\nroused by the political movements of Henry George. But with time and\r\nfamiliarity Chartism and Loco-focoism alike lost their horrid aspect.\r\nSeveral of the cardinal propositions of the former have been adopted in\r\nacts of Parliament without a shudder. To the animosity of the Loco-focos\r\nagainst special legislation and special privileges Americans probably\r\nowe to-day some part of the beneficent movement in many of the States\r\nfor constitutional requirements that legislatures shall act by general\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights party, though casting but a few votes, managed to give\r\nthe city of New York to the Whigs, a result which convinced the\r\nDemocrats that, dangerous as they were, they were less dangerous within\r\nthan without the party. The hatred which Van Buren after his message of\r\nSeptember, 1837, received from the banks commended him to the\r\nLoco-focos; and in October, 1837, Tammany Hall witnessed their\r\nreconciliation with the regular Democrats upon the moderate declaration\r\nfor equal rights. The Whigs had, indeed, been glad enough to have\r\nLoco-foco aid and even open alliance at the polls. But none the less\r\nthey thought the Democratic welcome back of the seceders an enormity.\r\nFrom this time the Democrats were, it was clear, no better than\r\nLoco-focos, and ought to bear the name of those dangerous iconoclasts.\r\n\r\nVan Buren met Congress in December, 1837, with still undaunted front.\r\nHis first general review of the operations of the government was but\r\nlittle longer than his message to the extra session on the single topic\r\nof finance. He refused to consider the result of the elections as a\r\npopular disapproval of the divorce of bank and state. In only one State,\r\nhe pointed out, had a federal election been held; and in the other\r\nelections, which had been local, he intimated that the fear of a\r\nforfeiture of the state-bank charters for their suspension of specie\r\npayments had determined the result. He still emphatically opposed the\r\nconnection between the government and the banks which could offer such\r\nstrong inducements for political agitation. He blew another blast\r\nagainst the United States Bank, now a Pennsylvania corporation, for\r\ncontinuing to reissue its notes originally made before its federal\r\ncharter had expired and since returned. He recommended a preëmption law\r\nfor the benefit of actual settlers on public lands, and a classification\r\nof lands under different rates, to encourage the settlement of the\r\npoorer lands near the older settlements. There was a conciliatory but\r\nfirm reference to the dispute with England over the northeastern\r\nboundary. He announced his failure to adjust the dispute with Mexico\r\nover the claims which had been pressed by Jackson. The Texan cloud\r\nwhich six years later brought Van Buren's defeat was already\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\nAt this session the independent or sub-treasury bill was again\r\nintroduced, and again a titanic battle was waged in the Senate. In this\r\nencounter Clay taunted Calhoun for going over to the enemy; and Calhoun,\r\nreferring to the Adams-Clay coalition, retorted that Clay had on a\r\nmemorable occasion gone over, and had not left it to time to disclose\r\nhis motives. Here it was that, in the decorous fury of the times, both\r\nsenators stamped accusations with scorn in the dust, and hurled back\r\ndarts fallen harmless at their feet. The bill passed the Senate by 27 to\r\n25; but Calhoun finally voted against it because there had been stricken\r\nout the provision that government dues should be paid in specie. The\r\nbill was again defeated in the House by 125 to 111. The latter vote was\r\nlate in June, 1838. But while Congress refused a law for it, the\r\nindependent treasury in fact existed. Under the circular issued upon the\r\nbank suspension, the collection, keeping, and payment of federal moneys\r\ncontinued to be done by federal officers. The absurdity of the\r\ndeclamation about one's blood curdling at Van Buren's recommendations,\r\nabout this being the system in vogue where people were ground \"to the\r\nvery dust by the awful despotism of their rulers,\" was becoming apparent\r\nin the easy, natural operation of the system, dictated though it was by\r\nnecessity rather than law. The Whigs, in the sounding jeremiades of\r\nWebster and the perfervid eloquence of Clay, were joined by the\r\nConservatives, former Democrats, with Tallmadge of New York and Rives of\r\nVirginia at their head. They had retired into the cave of superior\r\nwisdom, of which many men are fond when a popular storm seems rising\r\nagainst their party; they affected oppressive grief at Van Buren's\r\nreckless hatred of the popular welfare, and accused him of designing\r\nentire destruction of credit in the ordinary transactions of business.\r\nThis silly charge was continually made, and gained color from the\r\nextreme doctrines of the Equal Rights movement and the fixing of the\r\nLoco-foco name upon the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe sub-treasury bill was again taken up at the long session of 1839-40\r\nby the Congress elected in 1838. Again the wisdom of separating bank and\r\nstate, again the wrong of using public moneys to aid private business\r\nand speculation, were stated with perfectly clear but uninspiring logic.\r\nAgain came the antiphonal cry, warm and positive, against the cruelty of\r\nwithdrawing the government from an affectionate care for the people, and\r\nfrom its duty generously to help every one to earn his living. In and\r\nout of Congress it was the debate of the time, and rightly; for it\r\ninvolved a profound and critical issue, which since the foundation of\r\nthe government has been second in importance only to the questions of\r\nslavery and national existence and reconstruction. In 1840 the bill\r\npassed the Senate by 24 to 18 and the House by 124 to 107. This chief\r\nmonument of Van Buren's administration seemed quickly demolished by the\r\ntriumphant Whigs in 1841, but was finally set up again in 1846 without\r\nthe aid of its architect. From that time to our own, in war and in\r\npeace, the independence of the federal treasury has been a cardinal\r\nfeature of American finance. Nor was its theory lost even in the system\r\nof national banks and public depositories created for the tremendous\r\nnecessities of the civil war.[15]\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1838 business had revived during the year of enforced\r\nindustry and economy among the people. In January, 1838, the premium on\r\ngold at New York sank to three per cent.; and when the bank convention\r\nmet on the adjourned day in April, the premium was less than one per\r\ncent. The United States Bank resisted resumption with great affectation\r\nof public spirit, but for selfish reasons soon to be disclosed. The New\r\nYork banks, with an apology to their associates, resolved to resume by\r\nMay 10, five days before the date to which the State had legalized the\r\nsuspension. The convention adopted a resolution for general resumption\r\non January 1, 1839, without precluding earlier resumption by any banks\r\nwhich deemed it proper. In April it was learned that the Bank of\r\nEngland was shipping a million sterling to aid resumption by the banks.\r\nOn July 10, Governor Ritner of Pennsylvania by proclamation required the\r\nbanks of his State to resume by August 1. On the 13th of that month the\r\nbanks of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois yielded to the\r\nmoral coercion of the New York banks, and to the resumption now enforced\r\non the Bank of the United States. By the fall of 1838 resumption was\r\ngeneral, although the banks at the Southwest did not follow until\r\nmidwinter. Confidence was so much restored that \"runs\" on the banks did\r\nnot occur. The crisis seemed at an end; and Van Buren not unreasonably\r\nfancied that he saw before the country two years of steady and sound\r\nreturn to prosperity. Two such years would, in November, 1840, bring the\r\nreward of his sagacity and endurance. But a far deeper draft upon the\r\nvitality of the patient had been made than was supposed; and in its last\r\nagony, eighteen months later, Biddle's bank helped to blast Van Buren's\r\npolitical ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT.--CANADIAN INSURRECTION.--TEXAS.--SEMINOLE WAR.--DEFEAT FOR\r\nREËLECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother unpopular duty fell to Van Buren during his presidency, a duty\r\nbut for which New York might have been saved to him in 1840. In the\r\nLower and Upper Canadas popular discontent and political tumult resulted\r\nlate in 1837 in violence, so often the only means by which English\r\ndependencies have brought their imperial mistress to a respect for their\r\ncomplaints.[16] The liberality of the Whigs, then lately triumphant in\r\nEngland, was not broad enough to include these distant colonists. The\r\nprovincial legislature in each of the Canadas consisted of a Lower House\r\nor assembly chosen by popular vote, and an Upper House or council\r\nappointed by the governor, who himself was appointed by and represented\r\nthe crown. Reforms after reforms, proposed by the popular houses, were\r\nrejected by the council. In Lower Canada the popular opposition was\r\namong the French, who had never been embittered towards the United\r\nStates. In Upper Canada its strength was among settlers who had come\r\nsince the war closed in 1815. Lower Canada demanded in vain that the\r\ncouncil be made elective. Its assembly, weary of the effectual\r\nopposition of the council to popular measures, began in 1832 to refuse\r\nvotes of supplies unless their grievances were redressed; and by 1837\r\ngovernment charges had accrued to the amount of £142,100. On April 14,\r\n1837, Lord John Russell, still wearing the laurel of a victor for\r\npopular rights, procured from the imperial parliament permission,\r\nwithout the assent of the colonial parliament, to apply to these charges\r\nthe money in the hands of the receiver-general of Lower Canada. This\r\nextraordinary grant passed the House of Commons by 269 to 46. A far less\r\nflagitious case of taxation without representation had begun the\r\nAmerican Revolution. The money had been raised under laws which provided\r\nfor its expenditure by vote of a local representative body. It was\r\nexpended by the vote of a body at Westminster, three thousand miles\r\naway, but few of whose members knew or cared anything for the bleak\r\nstretch of seventeenth-century France on the lower St. Lawrence, and\r\nnone of whom had contributed a penny of it. To even Gladstone, lately\r\nthe under-secretary for the colonies and then a \"rising hope of\r\nunbending Tories,\" there seemed nothing involved but the embarrassment\r\nof faithful servants of the crown. This thoroughly British disregard of\r\nsentiment among other people roused a deep opposition which was headed\r\nby Papineau, eloquent and a hero among the French. An insurrection broke\r\nout in November, 1837, and blood was shed in engagements at St. Denis\r\nand St. Charles, not far from Montreal. But the insurgents were quickly\r\ndefeated, and within three weeks the insurrection in Lower Canada was\r\nended.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Canada there was considerable Republican sentiment, and the\r\nparty of popular rights had among its leaders men of a high order of\r\nability. One of them, Marshall S. Bidwell, through the magnanimity or\r\nprocurement of the governor, escaped from Canada to become one of the\r\nmost honored and stately figures at the bar of New York. Early in 1836,\r\nSir Francis B. Head, a clever and not ill-natured man, arrived as\r\ngovernor. He himself wrote the unconscious Anglicism that \"the great\r\ndanger\" he \"had to avoid was the slightest attempt to conciliate any\r\nparty.\" It was assumed with the usual insufferable affectation of\r\nomniscience that these hardy Western settlers were merely children who\r\ndid not know what was best for them. Even the suggestions of concession\r\nsent him from England were not respected. In an election for the\r\nAssembly he had the issue announced as one of separation from England;\r\nand by the use, it was said, of his power and patronage, the colonial\r\nTories carried a majority of the House. Hopeless of any redress, and\r\nfired by the rumors of the revolt in Lower Canada, an insurrection took\r\nplace early in December near Toronto. It was speedily suppressed. One of\r\nthe leaders, Mackenzie, escaped to Buffalo. Others were captured and\r\npunished, some of them capitally.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the Canadians were doubtless opposed to the insurrection.\r\nBut there was among them a widespread and reasonable discontent, with\r\nwhich the Americans, and especially the people of northern and western\r\nNew York, warmly sympathized. It was natural and traditional to believe\r\nEngland an oppressor; and there was every reason in this case to believe\r\nthe Canadians right in their ill-feeling. The refugees who had fled to\r\nNew York met with an enthusiastic reception, and, in the security of a\r\nforeign land, prepared to advance their rebellion. On the long frontier\r\nof river, lake, and wilderness, it was difficult, with the meagre force\r\nregularly at the disposal of the United States, to prevent depredations.\r\nThis difficulty became enhanced by a culpable though not unnatural\r\ninvasion of American territory by British troops. On December 12, 1837,\r\nMackenzie, who had the day before arrived with a price of $4000 set upon\r\nhis head, addressed a large audience at Buffalo. Volunteers were called\r\nfor; and the next day, with twenty-five men, commanded by Van\r\nRensselaer, an American, he seized Navy Island in the Niagara River, but\r\na short distance above the cataract, and belonging to Canada. He there\r\nestablished a provisional government, with a flag and a great seal; and\r\nthat the new State might be complete, paper money was issued. By\r\nJanuary, 1838, there were several hundred men on the island, largely\r\nAmericans, with arms and provisions chiefly obtained from the American\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 29, 1837, a party of Canadian militia crossed\r\nthe Niagara to seize the Caroline, a steamer in the service of the\r\nrebels. It happened, however, that the steamer, instead of being at Navy\r\nIsland, was at Schlosser, on the American shore. The Canadians seized\r\nthe vessel, killing several men in the affray, and after setting her on\r\nfire, loosened her from the shore, to go blazing down the river and over\r\nthe falls. This invasion of American territory caused indignant\r\nexcitement through the United States. Van Buren had promptly sought to\r\nprevent hostility from our territory. On January 5, 1838, he had issued\r\na proclamation reciting the seizure of Navy Island by a force, partly\r\nAmericans, under the command of an American, with arms and supplies\r\nprocured in the United States, and declared that the neutrality laws\r\nwould be rigidly enforced and the offenders punished. Nor would they\r\nreceive aid or countenance from the United States, into whatever\r\ndifficulties they might be thrown by their violation of friendly\r\nterritory. On the same day Van Buren sent General Winfield Scott to the\r\nfrontier, and by special message asked from Congress power to prevent\r\nsuch offenses in advance, as well as afterwards to punish them,--a\r\nrequest to which Congress, in spite of the excitement over the invasion\r\nat Schlosser, soon acceded. The militia of New York were, on this\r\ninvasion, called out by Governor Marcy, and placed under General Scott's\r\ncommand. But there was little danger. On January 13 the insurgents\r\nabandoned Navy Island. The war, for the time, was over, although\r\nexcitement and disorder continued on the border and the lakes as far as\r\nDetroit; and in the fall of 1838 other incursions were made from\r\nAmerican territory. But they were fruitless and short-lived. Nearly nine\r\nhundred arrests were made by the Canadian authorities. Many death\r\nsentences were imposed and several executed, and many more offenders\r\nwere sentenced to transportation.\r\n\r\nEngland, in her then usual fashion, was duly waked to duty by actual\r\nbloodshed. Sir Francis B. Head left Canada, and the Melbourne ministry\r\nsent over the Earl of Durham, one of the finest characters in English\r\npublic life, to be governor-general over the five colonies; to redress\r\ntheir wrongs; to conciliate, and perhaps yield to demands for\r\nself-government: all which might far better have been done five years\r\nbefore. Lord Durham used a wise mercy towards the rebels. He made rapid\r\nprogress in the reforms, and, best and first of all, he won the\r\nconfidence and affection of the people. But England used to distrust an\r\nEnglish statesman who practiced this kind of rule towards a dependency.\r\nA malevolent attack of Lord Brougham was successful, and Lord Durham\r\nreturned to ministerial disgrace, though to a wiser popular applause,\r\nsoon to die in what ought to have been but an early year in his generous\r\nand splendid career. Although punishing her benefactor, England was\r\nshrewd enough to accept the benefit. The concessions which Lord Durham\r\nhad begun were continued, and Canada became and has remained loyal.\r\nBefore leaving Canada, Lord Durham was invited by a very complimentary\r\nletter of Van Buren to visit Washington, but the invitation was\r\ncourteously declined.\r\n\r\nMackenzie was arrested at Buffalo and indicted. After his indictment he\r\naddressed many public meetings through the United States in behalf of\r\nhis cause, one at Washington itself. In 1839, however, he was tried and\r\nconvicted. Van Buren, justly refusing to pardon him until he had served\r\nin prison two thirds of his sentence, thus made for himself a persistent\r\nand vindictive enemy.\r\n\r\nUpon renewed raids late in 1838, the President, by a proclamation,\r\ncalled upon misguided or deluded Americans to abandon projects dangerous\r\nto their own country and fatal to those whom they professed a desire to\r\nrelieve; and, after various appeals to good sense and patriotism, warned\r\nthem that, if taken in Canada, they would be left to the policy and\r\njustice of the government whose dominions they had, \"without the shadow\r\nof justification or excuse, nefariously invaded.\" This had no uncertain\r\nsound. Van Buren was promptly declared to be a British tool. The plain\r\nfacts were ignored that the great majority of the Canadians, however\r\nmuch displeased with their rulers, were hostile to Republican\r\ninstitutions and to a separation from England, and that the majority in\r\nCanada had the same right to be governed in their own fashion as the\r\nmajority here. There was seen, however, in this firm performance of\r\ninternational obligations, only additional proof of Van Buren's coldness\r\ntowards popular rights, and of his sycophancy to power.\r\n\r\nThe system of allowing to actual settlers, at the minimum price, a\r\npreëmption of public lands already occupied by them, was adopted at the\r\nlong session of 1837-38. Webster joined the Democrats in favoring the\r\nbill, against the hot opposition of Clay, who declared it \"a grant of\r\nthe property of the whole people to a small part of the people.\" The\r\ndominant party was now wisely committed to the policy of using the\r\npublic domain for settlers, and not as mere property to be turned into\r\nmoney. But a year or two before, the latter system had in practice\r\nwasted the national estate and corrupted the public with a debauchery of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThe war between Mexico and the American settlers in her revolted\r\nnortheast province began in 1835. Early in 1836 the heroic defense of\r\nthe Alamo against several thousand Mexicans by less than two hundred\r\nAmericans, and among them Davy Crockett, Van Buren's biographer, and the\r\nbutchery of all but three of the Americans, had consecrated the old\r\nbuilding, still proudly preserved by the stirring but now peaceful and\r\npleasing city of San Antonio, and had roused in Texas a fierce and\r\nresolute hatred of Mexico. In April, 1836, Houston overwhelmed the\r\nMexicans at San Jacinto, and captured their president, Santa Anna.\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 21, 1836, Jackson, although he announced\r\nthese successes of the Texans and their expulsion of Mexican civil\r\nauthority, still pointed out to Congress the disparity of physical force\r\non the side of Texas, and declared it prudent that we should stand aloof\r\nuntil either Mexico itself or one of the great powers should have\r\nrecognized Texan independence, or at least until the ability of Texas\r\nshould have been proved beyond cavil. The Senate had then passed a\r\nresolution for recognition of Texan independence. But the House had not\r\nconcurred; and before Van Buren's inauguration Congress had done no more\r\nthan authorize the appointment of a diplomatic agent to Texas whenever\r\nthe President should be satisfied of its independence. In August, 1837,\r\nthe Texan representative at Washington laid before Van Buren a plan of\r\nannexation of the revolted Mexican state. The offer was refused; and it\r\nwas declared that the United States desired to remain neutral, and\r\nperceived that annexation would necessarily lead to war with Mexico. In\r\nDecember, 1837, petitions were presented in Congress against the\r\nannexation of Texas, now much agitated at the South; and Preston,\r\nCalhoun's senatorial associate from South Carolina, offered a resolution\r\nfor annexation. Some debate on the question was had in 1838, in which\r\nboth the pro-slavery character of the movement and the anti-slavery\r\ncharacter of the opposition clearly appeared. But this danger to Van\r\nBuren was delayed several years. Nor was he yet a character in the drama\r\nof the slavery conflict which by 1837 was well opened. The agitation\r\nover abolition petitions and the murder of Lovejoy the abolitionist are\r\nnow readily enough seen to have been the most deeply significant\r\noccurrences in America between Van Buren's inauguration and his defeat;\r\nbut they were as little part of his presidency as the arrival at New\r\nYork from Liverpool on April 22 and 23, 1838, of the Sirius and the\r\nGreat Western, the first transatlantic steamships. In Washington the\r\nslavery question did not get beyond the halls of Congress. The White\r\nHouse remained for several years free from both the dangers and the\r\nduties of the question accompanying the discussion.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's administration pressed upon Mexico claims arising out of\r\nwrongs to American citizens and property which had long been a\r\ngrievance. Jackson had thought it our duty, in view of the \"embarrassed\r\ncondition\" of that republic, to \"act with both wisdom and moderation by\r\ngiving to Mexico one more opportunity to atone for the past.\" In\r\nDecember, 1837, Van Buren, tired of Mexican procrastination, referred\r\nthe matter to Congress, with some menace in his tone. In 1840 a treaty\r\nwas at last made for an arbitration of the claims, the king of Prussia\r\nbeing the umpire. John Quincy Adams vehemently assailed the American\r\nassertion of these claims, as intended to \"breed a war with Mexico,\" and\r\n\"as machinery for the annexation of Texas;\" and his violent\r\ndenunciations have obtained some credit. But Adams himself had been\r\npretty vigorous in the maintenance of American rights. And the plain and\r\nwell known facts are, that after several years of negotiation the claims\r\nwere with perfect moderation submitted for decision to a disinterested\r\ntribunal; that they were never made the occasion of war; and that Van\r\nBuren opposed annexation.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1838, James K. Paulding, long the navy agent at New York, was\r\nmade secretary of the navy in place of Mahlon Dickerson of New Jersey,\r\nwho now resigned. Paulding seems to us rather a literary than a\r\npolitical figure. Besides the authorship of part of \"Salmagundi,\" of\r\n\"The Dutchman's Fireside,\" and of other and agreeable writings grateful\r\nto Americans in the days when the sting of the question, \"Who reads an\r\nAmerican book?\" lay rather in its truth than in its ill-nature,\r\nPaulding's pen had aided the Republican party as early as Madison's\r\npresidency. Our politics have always, even at home, paid some honor to\r\nthe muses, without requiring them to descend very far into the partisan\r\narena. A curious illustration was the nomination of Edwin Forrest, the\r\nfamous tragedian, for Congress by the Democrats of New York in 1838, a\r\nnomination which was more sensibly declined than made. An almost equally\r\ncurious instance was the tender Van Buren made of the secretaryship of\r\nthe navy to Washington Irving before he offered it to Paulding, who was\r\na connection by marriage of Irving's brother. Van Buren had, it will be\r\nremembered, become intimately acquainted with Irving abroad; and others\r\nthan Van Buren strangely enough had thought of him for political\r\nservice. The Jacksonians had wanted him to run for Congress; and Tammany\r\nHall had offered him a nomination for mayor of New York. Van Buren wrote\r\nto Irving that the latter had \"in an eminent degree those peculiar\r\nqualities which should distinguish the head of the department,\" and that\r\nthis opinion of his had been confirmed by Irving's friends, Paulding and\r\nKemble, the former of whom it was intimated was \"particularly informed\r\nin regard to the services to be rendered.\" But one cannot doubt that in\r\nwriting this the President had in mind the sort of service to the\r\npublic, and the personal pleasure and rest to himself, to be brought by\r\na delightful and accomplished man of letters, who was no mere recluse,\r\nbut long practiced in polished and brilliant life abroad, rather than\r\nany business or executive or political ability. Irving wisely replied\r\nthat he should delight in full occupation, and should take peculiar\r\ninterest in the navy department; but that he shrank from the harsh\r\nturmoils of life at Washington, and the bitter personal hostility and\r\nthe slanders of the press. A short career at Washington would, he said,\r\nrender him \"mentally and physically a perfect wreck.\" Paulding's\r\nappointment to the cabinet portfolio assigned to New York was not\r\nagreeable to the politicians; and they afterwards declared that, if\r\nMarcy had been chosen instead, the result in 1840 might have been\r\ndifferent. The next Democratic president gave the same place to another\r\nfamous man of letters, George Bancroft.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1837, Louis Napoleon wrote the President from New York that\r\nthe dangerous illness of his mother recalled him to the old world; and\r\nthat he stated the reason for his departure lest the President might\r\n\"have given credence to the calumnious surmises respecting\" him. The\r\nfamous adventurer used one of those many phrases of his which, if they\r\nhad not for years imposed on the world, no wise man would believe could\r\never have obtained respect. Van Buren, as the ruler of a free people,\r\nought to be advised, the prince wrote, that, bearing the name he did, it\r\nwas impossible for him \"to depart for an instant from the path pointed\r\nout to me by my conscience, my honor, and my duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1838 showed a recovery from the defeat in 1837, a\r\nrecovery which would perhaps have been permanent if the financial crisis\r\nhad been really over. Maine wheeled back into the Van Buren ranks; and\r\nMaryland and Ohio now joined her. In New Jersey and Massachusetts the\r\nWhig majorities were reduced; and in New York, where Seward and Weed had\r\nestablished a political management quite equal to the Regency, the\r\nformer was chosen governor by a majority of over 10,000, but still less\r\nby 5000 than the Whig majority of 1837. The Democrats now reaped the\r\nunpopularity of Van Buren's upright neutrality in the Canadian troubles.\r\nNorthern and western New York gave heavy Whig majorities. Jefferson\r\ncounty on the very border, which had stood by Van Buren even in 1837,\r\nwent over to the Whigs.\r\n\r\nVan Buren met Congress in December, 1838, with more cheerful words. The\r\nharvest had been bountiful, he said, and industry again prospered. The\r\nfirst half century of our Constitution was about to expire, after\r\nproving the advantage of a government \"entirely dependent on the\r\ncontinual exercise of the popular will.\" He returned firmly to his\r\nlecture on economics and the currency, drawing happily, but too soon, a\r\nlesson from the short duration of the suspension of specie payments in\r\n1837 and the length of that in 1814. We had been saved, he said, the\r\nmortification of seeing our distresses used to fasten again upon us so\r\n\"dangerous an institution\" as a national bank. The treasury would be\r\nable in the coming year to pay off the $8,000,000 outstanding of the\r\n$10,000,000 of treasury notes authorized at the extra session. Texas\r\nhad withdrawn its application for admission to the Union. The final\r\nremoval of the Indian tribes to the west of the Mississippi in\r\naccordance with the Democratic policy was almost accomplished. There\r\nwere but two blemishes on the fair record the White House sent to the\r\nCapitol. Swartwout, Jackson's collector of New York, was found, after\r\nhis super-session by Jesse Hoyt, to be a defaulter on a vast scale. His\r\ndefalcations, the President carefully pointed out, had gone on for seven\r\nyears, as well while public moneys were kept with the United States Bank\r\nand while they were kept with state banks, as while they were kept by\r\npublic officers. It was broadly intimated that this disgrace was not\r\nunrelated to the general theory which had so long connected the\r\ncollection and custody of public moneys with the advancement of private\r\ninterests; and the President asked for a law making it a felony to apply\r\npublic moneys to private uses. Swartwout's appointment in 1829, as has\r\nbeen said, was strenuously opposed by Van Buren as unfit to be made.\r\nAfter a year or two Jackson returned to Van Buren his written protest,\r\nsaying that time had proved his belief in Swartwout's unfitness to be a\r\nmistake. Van Buren's own appointment to the place was, however, far from\r\nan ideal one. Jesse Hoyt was shown by his published correspondence--a\r\nveritable instance, by the way, of \"_stolen_ sweets\"--to have been a\r\nshrewd, able man, who enjoyed the strangely varied confidence of many\r\ndistinguished, discreet, and honorable men, and of many very different\r\npersons, ranging through a singular gamut of religion, morals,\r\nstatesmanship, economics, politics, patronage, banking, trade, stock\r\ngambling, and betting. The respectability of some of Hoyt's friends and\r\nhis possession of some ability palliate, but do not excuse, his\r\nappointment to a great post.\r\n\r\nThe second Florida war still dragged out its slow and murderous length.\r\nThe Seminoles under pressure had yielded to Jackson's firm policy of\r\nremoving all the Indian tribes to the west of the Mississippi. The\r\npolicy seemed, or rather it was, often cruel, as is so much of the\r\nprogress of civilization. But the removal was wise and necessary. Tribal\r\nand independent governments by nomadic savages could not be tolerated\r\nwithin regions devoted to the arts and the government of white men.\r\nWhatever the theoretical rights of property in land, no civilized race\r\nnear vast areas of lands fit for the tillage of a crowding population\r\nhas ever permitted them to remain mere hunting grounds for savages. The\r\nSeminoles in 1832, 1833, and 1834 agreed to go west upon terms like\r\nthose accepted by other Indians. The removal was to take place, one\r\nthird of the tribe in each of the three years 1833, 1834, and 1835; but\r\nthe dark-skinned men, as their white brothers would have done, found or\r\ninvented excuses for not keeping their promise of voluntary\r\nexpatriation. Late in 1835, when coercion, although it had not yet been\r\nemployed against the Seminoles, was still feared by them, they rose\r\nunder their famous leader, the half-breed Powell, better known as\r\nOsceola, and massacred the federal agent and Major Dade, and 107 out of\r\n111 soldiers under him. Then followed a series of butcheries and\r\noutrages upon white men of which we have heard, and doubtless of crimes\r\nenough upon Indians of which we have not heard. Among the everglades,\r\nthe swamps and lakes of Florida, its scorching sands and impenetrable\r\nthickets, a difficult, tedious, inglorious, and costly contest went on.\r\nMilitary evolutions and tactics were of little value; it was a war of\r\nambushes and assassination. Osceola, coming with a flag of truce, was\r\ntaken by General Jessup, the defense for his capture being his violation\r\nof a former parole. He was sent to Fort Moultrie, in Charleston harbor,\r\nand there died, after furnishing recitations to generations of\r\nschoolboys, and sentiment to many of their elders. Van Buren had been\r\ncompelled to ask $1,600,000 from Congress at the extra session. Before\r\nhis administration was ended nearly $14,000,000 had been spent; and not\r\nuntil 1842 did the war end. It was one of the burdens of the\r\nadministration which served to irritate a people already uneasy for\r\ndeeper and more general reasons. The prowess of the Indian chief, his\r\neloquence, his pathetic end, the miseries and wrongs of the aborigines,\r\nthe cost and delay of the war, all reënforced the denunciation of Van\r\nBuren by men who made no allowance for embarrassments which could be\r\nsurmounted by no ability, because they were inevitable to the settlement\r\nby a civilized race of lands used by savages. Time, however, has\r\nvindicated the justice and mercy, as well as the policy of the removal,\r\nand of the establishment of the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nA few days before the close of the session Van Buren asked Congress to\r\nconsider the dispute with Great Britain over the northeast boundary.\r\nBoth Maine and New Brunswick threatened, by rival military occupations\r\nof the disputed territory, to precipitate war. Van Buren permitted the\r\ncivil authorities of Maine to protect the forests from destruction; but\r\ndisapproved any military seizure, and told the state authorities that he\r\nshould propose arbitration to Great Britain. If, however, New Brunswick\r\nsought a military occupation, he should defend the territory as part of\r\nthe State. Congress at once authorized the President to call out 50,000\r\nvolunteers, and put at his disposal a credit of $10,000,000. Van Buren\r\npersisted in his great effort peacefully to adjust the claims of our\r\nchronically belligerent northeastern patriots,--in Maine as in New York\r\nfinding his fate in his duty firmly and calmly to restrain a local\r\nsentiment inspiring voters of great political importance to him. The\r\n\"news from Maine\" in 1840 told of the angry contempt the hardy lumbermen\r\nfelt for the President's perfectly statesmanlike treatment of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1839 Van Buren visited his old home at Kinderhook; and\r\non his way there and back enjoyed a burst of enthusiasm at York,\r\nHarrisburg, Lebanon, Reading, and Easton in Pennsylvania, at Newark and\r\nJersey City in New Jersey, and at New York, Hudson, and Albany in his\r\nown State. There were salutes of artillery, pealing of bells, mounted\r\nescorts in blue and white scarfs, assemblings of \"youth and beauty,\" the\r\ncomplimentary addresses, the thronging of citizens \"to grasp the hand of\r\nthe man whom they had delighted to honor,\" and all the rest that makes\r\nup the ovations of Americans to their black-coated rulers. He landed in\r\nNew York at Castle Garden, amid the salutes of the forts on Bedloe's,\r\nGovernor's, and Staten Islands, and of a \"seventy-four,\" whose yards\r\nwere covered with white uniformed sailors. After the reception in Castle\r\nGarden he mounted a spirited black horse and reviewed six thousand\r\ntroops assembled on the Battery; and then went in procession along\r\nBroadway to Chatham Street, thence to the Bowery, and through Broome\r\nStreet and Broadway back to the City Hall Park. Not since Lafayette's\r\nvisit had there been so fine a reception. At Kinderhook he was\r\noverwhelmed with the affectionate pride of his old neighbors. He\r\ndeclined public dinners, and by the simple manner of his travel offered\r\ndisproof of the stories about his \"English servants, horses and\r\ncarriages.\" The journey was not, however, like the good-natured and\r\nunpartisan presidential journeys of our time. The Whigs often churlishly\r\nrefused to help in what they said was an electioneering tour. Seward\r\npublicly refused the invitation of the common council of New York to\r\nparticipate in the President's reception, because the State had honored\r\nhim with the office of governor for his disapproval of Van Buren's\r\npolitical character and public policy, and because an acceptance of the\r\ninvitation \"would afford evidence of inconsistency and insincerity.\" Van\r\nBuren's own friends gave a party air to much of the welcome. Democratic\r\ncommittees were conspicuous in the ceremonies; and in many of the\r\naddresses much that was said of his administration was fairly in a\r\ndispute certain to last until the next year's election was over. Van\r\nBuren could hardly have objected to the coldness of the Whigs, for his\r\nown speeches, though decorous and respectful to the last degree to those\r\nwho differed from him, were undisguised appeals for popular support of\r\nhis financial policy. At New York he referred to the threatening\r\ndissatisfaction in his own State concerning his firm treatment of the\r\nCanadian troubles. But he was persuaded, he said, that good sense and\r\nultimately just feeling would give short duration to these unfavorable\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nThe President was too experienced and cool in judgment to exaggerate the\r\nsignificance of superficial demonstrations like these, which often\r\nseemed conclusive to his exuberant rival Clay. He was encouraged,\r\nhowever, by the elections of 1839. In Ohio the Whigs were \"pretty\r\nessentially used up,\" though unfortunately not to remain so a\r\ntwelve-month. In Massachusetts Morton, the Van Buren candidate for\r\ngovernor, was elected by just one vote more than a majority of the\r\n102,066 votes cast. Georgia, New Jersey, and Mississippi gave\r\nadministration majorities. In New York the adverse majority which in\r\n1837 had been over 15,000, and in 1838 over 10,000, was now less than\r\n4000, in spite of the disaffection along the border counties. It was not\r\nan unsatisfactory result, although for the first time since 1818 the\r\nlegislature was completely lost. Another year, Van Buren now hoped,\r\nwould bring a complete recovery from the blow of 1837. But the autumn of\r\n1839 had also brought a blast, to grow more and more chilling and\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nIn the early fall the Bank of the United States agreed to loan\r\nPennsylvania $2,000,000; and for the loan obtained the privilege of\r\nissuing $5 notes, having before been restricted to notes of $20 and\r\nupwards. \"Thus has the Van Buren State of Pennsylvania,\" it was boasted,\r\n\"enabled the banks to overcome the reckless system of a Van Buren\r\nnational administration.\" The price of cotton, which had risen to 16\r\ncents a pound, fell in the summer of 1839, and in 1840 touched as low a\r\npoint as 5 cents. In the Northwest many banks had not yet resumed since\r\n1837. To avoid execution sales it was said that two hundred plantations\r\nhad been abandoned and their slaves taken to Texas. The sheriff, instead\r\nof the ancient return, _nulla bona_, was said, in the grim sport of the\r\nfrontier, to indorse on the fruitless writs \"G. T.,\" meaning \"Gone to\r\nTexas.\" A money stringency again appeared in England, in 1839. Its\r\nexportation of goods and money to America had again become enormous. The\r\ncustoms duties collected in 1839 were over $23,000,000, and about the\r\nsame as they had been in 1836, having fallen in 1837 to $11,000,000, and\r\nafterwards in 1840 falling to $13,000,000. Speculation revived, the land\r\nsales exceeding $7,000,000 in 1839, while they had been $3,700,000 in\r\n1838, and afterwards fell to $3,000,000 in 1840. Under the pressure from\r\nEngland the Bank of the United States sank with a crash. The\r\n\"Philadelphia Gazette,\" complacently ignoring the plain reasons for\r\nmonths set before its eyes, said that the disaster had \"its chief cause\r\nin the revulsion of the opium trade with the Chinese;\" that upon the\r\nnews that the Orientals would no longer admit the drug the Bank of\r\nEngland had \"fairly reeled;\" and that, the balance of trade being\r\nagainst us, we had to dishonor our paper. Explanations of like frivolity\r\ngot wide credence. The Philadelphia banks suspended on October 9, 1839,\r\nthe banks of Baltimore the next day, and in a few days the banks in the\r\nNorth and West followed. The banks of New York and New England, except\r\nthose of Providence, continued firm. Although the excitement of 1839 did\r\nnot equal that of 1837, there was a duller and completer despondency. It\r\nwas at last known that the recuperative power of even our own proud and\r\nbounding country had limits. Years were yet necessary to a recovery.\r\nBut the presidential election would not, alas! wait years. With no\r\nfaltering, however, Van Buren met Congress in December, 1839. He began\r\nhis message with a regret that he could not announce a year of\r\n\"unalloyed prosperity.\" There ought never, as presidential messages had\r\nrun, to be any alloy in the prosperity of the American people. But the\r\nharvest, he said, had been exuberant, and after all (for the grapes of\r\ntrade and manufacture were a little sour), the steady devotion of the\r\nhusbandman was the surest source of national prosperity. A part of the\r\n$10,000,000 of treasury notes was still outstanding, and he hoped that\r\nthey might be paid. We must not resort to the ruinous practice of\r\nsupplying supposed necessities by new loans; a permanent debt was an\r\nevil with no equivalent. The expenditures for 1838, the first year over\r\nwhose appropriations Van Buren had had control, had been less than those\r\nof 1837. In 1839 they had been $6,000,000 less than in 1838; and for\r\n1840 they would be $5,000,000 less than in 1839. The collection and\r\ndisbursement of public moneys by public officers rather than by banks\r\nhad, since the bank suspensions in 1837, been carried on with unexpected\r\ncheapness and ease; and legislation was alone wanting to insure to the\r\nsystem the highest security and facility. Nothing daunted by the second\r\ndisaster so lately clouding his political future, Van Buren sounded\r\nanother blast against the banks. With unusual abundance of harvests,\r\nwith manufactures richly rewarded, with our granaries and storehouses\r\nfilled with surplus for export, with no foreign war, with nothing indeed\r\nto endanger well-managed banks, this banking disaster had come. The\r\ngovernment ought not to be dependent on banks as its depositories, for\r\nthe banks outside of New York and Philadelphia were dependent upon the\r\nbanks in those great cities, and the latter banks in turn upon London,\r\n\"the centre of the credit system.\" With some truth, but still with a\r\ntouch of demagogy, venial perhaps in the face of the blatant and silly\r\noutcries against him from very intelligent and respectable people, he\r\nsaid that the founding of a new bank in a distant American village\r\nplaced its business \"within the influence of the money power of\r\nEngland.\" Let us then, he argued, have gold and silver and not\r\nbank-notes, at least in our public transactions; let us keep public\r\nmoneys out of the banks. Again he attacked the national bank scheme. In\r\n1817 and 1818, in 1823, in 1831, and in 1834 the United States Bank had\r\nswelled and maddened the tides of banking, but had seldom allayed or\r\nsafely directed them. Turning with seemingly cool resolution, but with\r\nhidden anxiety, to the menacing distresses of the American voters, he\r\ndid not flinch or look for fair or flattering words. We must not turn\r\nfor relief, he said, to gigantic banks, or splendid though profitless\r\nrailroads and canals. Relief was to be sought, not by the increase, but\r\nby the diminution of debt. The faith of States already pledged was to\r\nbe punctiliously kept; but we must be chary of further pledges. The\r\nbounties of Providence had come to reduce the consequences of past\r\nerrors. \"But let it be indelibly engraved on our minds,\" he said, \"that\r\nrelief is not to be found in expedients. Indebtedness cannot be lessened\r\nby borrowing more money, or by changing the form of the debt.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was so divided that its control depended\r\nupon whether five Whig or five Democratic congressmen from New Jersey\r\nshould be admitted. They had been voted for upon a general ticket\r\nthrough the whole State; and the Whig governor and council had given the\r\ncertificate of election to the Whigs by acquiescing in the actions of\r\nthe two county clerks who had, for irregularities, thrown out the\r\nDemocratic districts of South Amboy and Millville. A collision arose\r\ncuriously like the dispute over the electoral returns from Florida and\r\nLouisiana in 1877. This exclusion of the two districts the Democrats\r\ninsisted to have been wrongful; and not improbably with reason, for at\r\nthe next election in 1839 the State, upon the popular vote, gave a\r\nsubstantial majority against the Whigs, although by the district\r\ndivision of the State a majority of the legislature were Whigs and\r\nreëlected the Whig governor. The clerk of the national House had,\r\naccording to usage, prepared a roll of members, which he proceeded to\r\ncall. He seems to have placed on the roll the names of the New Jersey\r\nrepresentatives holding the governor's certificates. But before calling\r\ntheir names, he stated to the House that there were rival credentials;\r\nthat he felt that he had no power to decide upon the contested rights;\r\nand that, if the House approved, he would pass over the names until the\r\ncall of the other States was finished. The rival credentials included a\r\nrecord of the votes upon which the governor's certificate was presumed\r\nto be based. Objection was made to passing New Jersey, and one of the\r\ngovernor's certificates was read. The New Jerseymen with certificates\r\ninsisted that their names should be called. The clerk declined to take\r\nany step without the authority of the House, holding that he was in no\r\nsense a chairman. He behaved in the case with modesty and decorum, and\r\nthe savage criticisms upon him seem to have no foundation except this\r\nrefusal of his to decide upon the _prima facie_ right to the New Jersey\r\nseats, or to act as chairman except upon unanimous consent. He was\r\nclearly right. He had no power. The very roll he prepared, and his\r\nreading it, had no force except such as the House chose to give them.\r\nUpon any other theory he would practically wield an enormous power\r\njustified neither by the Constitution nor by any law. On the fourth day\r\nof tumult a simple and lawful remedy was discovered to be at hand. Any\r\nmember could himself act as chairman to put his own motion for the\r\nappointment of a temporary speaker; and if a majority acquiesced, there\r\nwas at once an organization without the clerk's aid. This was in\r\nprecise accord with the attitude of the clerk, hotly abused as he was by\r\nAdams and others who adopted his position. So Adams proposed himself to\r\nput the question on his own motion to call the roll with the members\r\nholding certificates. Further confusion then ensued, which was\r\nterminated by Rhett of South Carolina, who moved that John Quincy Adams\r\nact as chairman until a speaker should be chosen. Rhett put his own\r\nmotion, and it was carried. Adams took the chair, rules were adopted,\r\nand order succeeded chaos. None of the New Jerseymen were permitted to\r\nvote for speaker, but a few Calhoun Democrats refused to vote for the\r\nadministration candidate. Most of the administration members offered to\r\naccept a Calhoun man; but a few of them, naturally angry at South\r\nCarolina dictation, refused, under Benton's advice, to vote for him. At\r\nlast the Whigs joined the Calhoun men, and ended this extraordinary\r\ncontest. The speaker, Robert M. T. Hunter, was a so-called states-rights\r\nman, and a supporter of the independent treasury scheme. He had the\r\nfortune, after a singularly varied and even important career in the\r\nUnited States and the Confederate States, to be appointed by President\r\nCleveland to the petty place of collector of customs at Tappahannock, in\r\nVirginia, and to live among Americans who were familiar with his\r\nprominence fifty years ago, but supposed him long since dead. The clerk,\r\nHugh A. Garland, was reëlected, in spite of what Adams in his diary,\r\nafter his picturesque but utterly unjustifiable fashion, called the\r\n\"baseness of his treachery to his trust.\" The Whig New Jerseymen were\r\nrefused seats, and the apparent perversion of the popular vote was\r\nrightly defeated by seating their rivals. The Whigs posed as defenders\r\nof the sanctity of state authority, and sought, upon that political\r\nissue, to force the Van Buren men to be the apologists for\r\ncentralization.\r\n\r\nIt was at this session that the sub-treasury bill was passed. As a sort\r\nof new declaration of independence Van Buren signed it on July 4, 1840.\r\nHis long and honorable and his greatest battle was won. It was the\r\ntriumph of a really great cause. The people, by their labor and capital,\r\nwere to support the federal government as a mere agency for limited\r\npurposes. That government was not, in this way at least, to support or\r\ndirect or control either the people or their labor or capital. But the\r\ncaptain fell at the time of his victory. The financial disaster of 1839\r\nhad exhausted the good-nature and patience of the people. Dissertations\r\non finance and economics, however wise, now served to irritate and\r\ndisgust. These cool admonitions to economy and a minding of one's\r\nbusiness were popularly believed to be heartless and repulsive.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 took place the most extraordinary of presidential campaigns.\r\nWhile Congress was wrangling over the New Jersey episode in December,\r\n1839, the Whig national convention again nominated Harrison for\r\nPresident. Tyler was taken from the ranks of seceding Democrats as the\r\ncandidate for Vice-President. The slaughter of Henry Clay, the father\r\nof the Whig party, had been effected by the now formidable Whig\r\npoliticians of New York, cunningly marshaled by Thurlow Weed.\r\nAvailability had its first complete triumph in our national politics.\r\nThey had not come, Governor Barbour of Virginia, the president of the\r\nWhig convention, said, to whine after the fleshpots of Egypt, but to\r\ngive perpetuity to Republican institutions. To reach this end (not very\r\nexplicitly or intelligibly defined), it mattered not what letters of the\r\nalphabet spelled the name of the candidate; for his part, he could sing\r\nHosanna to any alphabetical combination. No platform or declaration of\r\nprinciples was adopted, lest some of those discontented with Van Buren\r\nshould find there a counter-irritant. The candidates, in accepting their\r\nnominations, refrained from political discussion. Harrison stood for the\r\nplain, honest citizen, coming, as one of the New York conventions said,\r\n\"like another Cincinnatus from his plough,\" resolute for a generous\r\nadministration, and ready to diffuse prosperity and to end hard times.\r\nTyler, formerly a strict constructionist member of the Jackson party,\r\nwas nominated to catch votes, in spite of his perfectly well known\r\nopposition to the whole Whig theory of government.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic, or Democratic-Republican, convention met at Baltimore on\r\nMay 5, 1840. The party name was now definitely and exclusively adopted.\r\nAmong the delegates were men long afterwards famous in the later\r\nRepublican party, John A. Dix, Hannibal Hamlin, Simon Cameron. There was\r\nan air of despondency about the convention, for the enthusiasm over \"log\r\ncabin and hard cider\" was already abroad. But the convention without\r\nwavering announced its belief in a limited federal power, in the\r\nseparation of public moneys from banking institutions; and its\r\nopposition to internal improvements by the nation, to the federal\r\nassumption of state debts, to the fostering of one industry so as to\r\ninjure another, to raising more money than was required for necessary\r\nexpenses of government, and to a national bank. Slavery now took for a\r\nlong time its place in the party platform. The convention declared the\r\nconstitutional inability of Congress to interfere with slavery in the\r\nStates, and that all efforts of abolitionists to induce Congress to\r\ninterfere with slavery were alarming and dangerous to the Union. An\r\nelaborate address to the people was issued. It began with a clear, and\r\nfor a political campaign a reasonably moderate, defense of Van Buren's\r\nadministration; it renewed the well-worn arguments for the limited\r\nactivity of government; it made a silly assertion that Harrison was a\r\nFederalist, and an insinuation that the glory of his military career was\r\ndoubtful; it denounced the abolitionists, whose fanaticism it charged\r\nthe Whigs with enlisting in their cause. In closing, it recalled the\r\nDemocratic revolution of 1800 which broke the \"iron rod of Federal\r\nrule,\" and contrasted the \"costly and stately pageants addressed merely\r\nto the senses\" by the Whigs with the truth and reason of the Democracy.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass Van Buren submitted to frequent interrogation. In a\r\nfashion that would seem fatal to a modern candidate, he wrote to\r\npolitical friends and enemies alike, letter after letter, restating his\r\npolitical opinions. Especially was it sought to arouse Southern distrust\r\nof him. He was accused, with fire-eating anger, of having approved a\r\nsentence of a court-martial against a naval lieutenant which was based\r\nupon the testimony of negroes. He reiterated what he had already said\r\nupon slavery; but late in the canvass he went one step further. When\r\nasked his opinion as to the treatment by Congress of the abolition\r\npetitions, he replied, justly enough, that the President could have no\r\nconcern with that matter; but lest he should be charged with\r\n\"non-committalism,\" he declared that Congress was fully justified in\r\nadopting the \"gag\" rule. For years the petitions had been received and\r\nreferred. On one occasion in each House the subject had been considered\r\nupon a report of a committee, and decided against the petitioners with\r\nalmost entire unanimity. The rule had been adopted only after it was\r\nclear that the petitioners simply sought to make Congress an instrument\r\nof an agitation which might lead to a dissolution of the Union. It was\r\nthus that Van Buren made his extreme concession to the slavocracy. And\r\nthere was obvious a material excuse. No president while in office could\r\napprove the perversion of legislative procedure from the making of laws\r\nto be a mere stimulant of moral excitement. To encourage or justify\r\npetitions intended to inflame public sentiment against a wrong might be\r\nlegitimate for some men, however well they knew, as Adams said he knew,\r\nthat the body addressed ought not to grant the petitioners' prayers.\r\nSuch a course might be noble and praiseworthy for a private citizen, or\r\npossibly for a member of Congress representing the exalted moral\r\nsentiment of a single district. It would be highly illegitimate for a\r\nman holding a great public office, and there representing the entire\r\npeople and its established system of laws. John Quincy Adams, under his\r\nsense of duty as president, had in 1828 pressed the humiliating claim\r\nthat England should surrender American slaves escaped to English\r\nfreedom; and there is little reason to doubt that, if he had remained in\r\nthe field of responsible and executive public life, he would have agreed\r\nwith Van Buren in his treatment of the matter of the abolition\r\npetitions, or rather in his expressions from the White House about them.\r\n\r\nHarrison hastened to clear his skirts of abolitionism. Congress could\r\nnot, he declared, abolish slavery in the District of Columbia without\r\nthe consent of Virginia and Maryland and of the District itself. For, as\r\nhe argued, ignobly applying, as well as misquoting, the American words\r\nsolemnly lauded by Lord Chatham in his speech on Quartering Soldiers in\r\nBoston, \"what a man has honestly acquired is absolutely his own, which\r\nhe may freely give, but which cannot be taken from him without his\r\nconsent.\" He denounced as a slander the charge that he was an\r\nabolitionist, or that the vote he had given against anti-slavery\r\nrestriction in Missouri had violated his conscience. He declared for the\r\nright of petition, which indeed nobody disputed; but he did not say what\r\ncourse should be taken with the anti-slavery petitions, which was the\r\nreal question to be answered. The discussion by the citizens of the free\r\nStates of slavery in the slave States was not, he said, \"sanctioned by\r\nthe Constitution.\" \"Methinks,\" he said at Dayton, \"I hear a soft voice\r\nasking, Are you in favor of paper money? I am;\" and to that there were\r\n\"shouts of applause.\"\r\n\r\nIn no presidential canvass in America has there been, as Mr. Schurz well\r\nsays in his life of Henry Clay, \"more enthusiasm and less thought\" than\r\nin the Whig canvass of 1840. The people were rushing as from a long\r\nrestraint. Wise saws about the duties of government had become\r\nnauseating. A plain every-day man administering a paternal and\r\naffectionate government was the ruling text, while Tyler and his strict\r\nconstruction quietly served their turn with some of the doctrinaires at\r\nthe South. The nation, Clay said, was \"like the ocean when convulsed by\r\nsome terrible storm.\" There was what he called a \"rabid appetite for\r\npublic discussions.\"\r\n\r\nWebster's campaign speeches probably marked the height of the splendid\r\nand effectual flood of eloquence now poured over the land. The breeze of\r\npopular excitement, he said, with satisfactory magniloquence, was\r\nflowing everywhere; it fanned the air in Alabama and the Carolinas; and\r\ncrossing the Potomac and the Alleghanies, to mingle with the gales of\r\nthe Empire State and the mountain blasts of New England, would blow a\r\nperfect hurricane. \"Every breeze,\" he declared, \"says change; the cry,\r\nthe universal cry, is for a change.\" He had not, indeed, been born in a\r\nlog cabin, but his elder brothers and sisters had; he wept to think of\r\nthose who had left it; and if he failed in affectionate veneration for\r\nhim who raised it, then might his name and the name of his posterity be\r\nblotted from the memory of mankind. He touched the bank question\r\nlightly; he denounced the sub-treasury as \"the first in a new series of\r\nruthless experiments,\" and declared that Van Buren's \"abandonment of the\r\ncurrency\" was fatal. Forgetting who had supported and who had opposed\r\nthe continued distribution of surplus revenues among the States, he\r\ncondemned the President for the low state of the treasury; and\r\nnotwithstanding it declared his approval of a generous policy of\r\ninternal improvements. He would not accuse the President of seeking to\r\nplay the part of Cæsar or Cromwell because Mr. Poinsett, his secretary\r\nof war, had recommended a federal organization of militia, the necessity\r\nor convenience of which, it was supposed, had been demonstrated by the\r\nCanadian troubles; but the plan, he said, was expensive,\r\nunconstitutional, and dangerous to our liberties. He was careful to say\r\nnothing of slavery or the right of petition. Only in brief and casual\r\nsentences did he even touch the charges that Van Buren had treated\r\npolitical contests as \"rightfully struggles for office and emolument,\"\r\nand that federal officers had been assessed in proportion to their\r\nsalaries for partisan purposes. The President was pictured as full of\r\ncynical and selfish disregard of the people; he had disparaged the\r\ncredit of the States; he had accused Madison, and, monstrous sacrilege,\r\neven Washington, of corruption. \"I may forgive this,\" Webster slowly\r\nsaid to the appalled audience, \"but I shall not forget it;\" such\r\n\"abominable violations of the truth of history\" filled his bosom with\r\n\"burning scorn.\" This was a highly imaginative allusion to Van Buren's\r\nstatement that the national bank had been originally devised by the\r\nfriends of privileged orders. Nor need the South, even Webster\r\nintimated, have any fear of the Whigs about slavery. Could the South\r\nbelieve that Harrison would \"lay ruthless hands on the institutions\r\namong which he was born and educated?\" No, indeed, for Washington and\r\nHancock, Virginia and Massachusetts, had joined their thoughts, their\r\nhopes, their feelings. \"How many bones of Northern men,\" he asked with\r\nmajestic pathos, \"lie at Yorktown?\" Senator Rives, now one of the\r\nConservatives, said that Van Buren was indeed \"mild, smooth, affable,\r\nsmiling;\" but humility was \"young and old ambition's ladder.\" The\r\nmilitia project meant military usurpation. Look at Cromwell, he said;\r\nlook at Bonaparte. Were their usurpations not in the name of the people?\r\nPreston of South Carolina said that Van Buren had advocated diminished\r\nwages to others; now he should himself receive diminished wages.\r\nHarrison was, he said \"a Southern man with Southern principles.\" As for\r\nVan Buren, this \"Northern man with Southern principles,\" did he not come\r\n\"from beyond the Hudson,\" had he not been \"a friend of Rufus King, a\r\nMissouri restrictionist, a friend and advocate of free negro suffrage?\"\r\nClay said that it was no time \"to argue;\" a rule his party for the\r\nmoment well observed. The nation had already pronounced upon the ravages\r\nVan Buren had brought upon the land, the general and widespread ruin,\r\nthe broken hopes. With the mere fact of Harrison's election, \"without\r\nreference to the measures of his administration,\" he told the Virginians\r\nat Hanover, \"confidence will immediately revive, credit be restored,\r\nactive business will return, prices of products will rise; and the\r\npeople will feel and know that, instead of their servants being occupied\r\nin devising measures for their ruin and destruction, they will be\r\nassiduously employed in promoting their welfare and prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was far more glorious than the brutally true advice of the old\r\nman with a broad-axe on his shoulders, whom the Democrats quoted. When\r\nasked what was to become of everybody in the heavy distress of the\r\npanic, he answered, \"Damn the panic! If you would all work as I do, you\r\nwould have no panic.\" The people no longer cared about \"the interested\r\nfew who desire to enrich themselves by the use of public money.\" If, as\r\nthe Democrats said, the interested few had been thwarted, an almost\r\nuniversal poverty had for some reason or other come with their defeat.\r\nPerhaps the reflecting citizen thought that he might become, if he were\r\nnot already, one of the \"interested few.\" Nor was the demagogy all on\r\nthe side of the Whigs, although they enjoyed the more popular quality of\r\nthe quadrennial product. Van Buren himself, in the futile fashion of\r\naging parties which suppose that their ancient victories still stir the\r\npopular heart, recalled \"the reign of terror\" of the elder Adams, and\r\nhow the \"Samson of Democracy burst the cords which were already bound\r\naround its limbs,\" how \"a web more artfully contrived, composed of a\r\nhigh protective tariff, a system of internal improvements, and a\r\nnational bank, was then twined around the sleeping giant\" until he was\r\n\"roused by the warning voice of the honest and intrepid Jackson.\"\r\nHarrison's own numerous speeches were awkward and indefinite enough; but\r\nstill they showed an honest and sincere man, and in the enthusiasm of\r\nthe day they did him no harm.\r\n\r\nThe revolts against the severe party discipline of the Democracy, aided\r\nby the popular distress, were serious. Calhoun, indeed, had returned;\r\nbut all his supporters did not return with him. The Southern defection\r\nheaded by White in 1836 was still most formidable, and was now\r\nreënforced by the Conservative secession North and South. Even Major\r\nEaton forgot Van Buren's gallantry ten years before, and joined the\r\nenemy. The talk of \"spoils\" was amply justified; but the abuses of\r\npatronage had not prevented Jackson's popularity, and under Van Buren\r\nthey were far less serious. This cry did not yet touch the American\r\npeople. The most serious danger of \"spoils\" still lay in the future.\r\nPatronage abuses had injured the efficiency of the public service, but\r\nthey had not yet begun to defeat the popular will. Jackson came\r\nresolutely to Van Buren's aid in the fashionable letter-writing. \"The\r\nRives Conservatives, the Abolitionists and Federalists\" had combined,\r\nthe ex-President vivaciously said, to obtain power \"by falsehood and\r\nslander of the basest kind;\" but the \"virtue of the people,\" he declared\r\nin what from other lips would have seemed cant, would defeat \"the money\r\npower.\" Van Buren's firmness and ability entitled him, he thought, to a\r\nrank not inferior to Jefferson or Madison, while he rather unhandsomely\r\nadded that he had never admired Harrison as a military man.\r\n\r\nThe Whig campaign was highly picturesque. Meetings were measured by\r\n\"acres of men.\" They gathered on the field of Tippecanoe. Revolutionary\r\nsoldiers marched in venerable processions. Wives and daughters came with\r\ntheir husbands and fathers. There were the barrel of cider, the\r\ncoon-skins, and the log cabin with the live raccoon running over it and\r\nthe latch-string hung out; for Harrison had told his soldiers when he\r\nleft them, that never should his door be shut, \"or the string of the\r\nlatch pulled in.\" Van Buren meantime, with an aristocratic sneer upon\r\nhis face, was seated in an English carriage, after feeding himself from\r\nthe famous gold spoons bought for the White House. Harrison was a hunter\r\nwho had caught a fox before and would again; one of the county\r\nprocessions from Pennsylvania boasted, \"Old Mother Cumberland--she'll\r\nbag the fox.\" Illinois would \"teach the palace slaves to respect the log\r\ncabin.\" \"Down with the wages, say the administration.\" \"Matty's policy,\r\nfifty cents a day and French soup; our policy, two dollars a day and\r\nroastbeef.\" Newspapers were full of advertisements like this: \"The\r\nsubscriber will pay $5 a hundred for pork if Harrison is elected, and\r\n$2.50 if Van Buren is.\"\r\n\r\nBut the songs were most interesting. The ball, which Benton had said in\r\nhis last speech on the expunging resolution that he \"solitary and alone\"\r\nhad put in motion, was a mine of similes. They sang:\r\n\r\n        \"With heart and soul\r\n        This ball we roll.\"\r\n\r\n        \"As rolls the ball,\r\n        Van's reign does fall,\r\n        And he may look\r\n        To Kinderhook.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The gathering ball is rolling still,\r\n  And still gathering as it rolls.\"\r\n\r\nHarrison's battle with the Indians gave the effective cry of \"Tippecanoe\r\nand Tyler too.\" And so they sang:\r\n\r\n        \"Farewell, dear Van,\r\n        You're not our man;\r\n        To guard the ship,\r\n        We'll try old Tip.\"\r\n\r\n        \"With Tip and Tyler\r\n        We'll burst Van's biler.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Old Tip he wears a homespun suit,\r\n  He has no ruffled shirt--wirt--wirt;\r\n  But Mat he has the golden plate,\r\n  And he's a little squirt--wirt--wirt.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the election returns began to come from the August and September\r\nStates, the joyful excitement passed all bounds. Then the new Whigs\r\nfound a new Lilliburlero. To the tune of the \"Little Pig's Tail\" they\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n  \"What has caused this great commotion, motion, motion,\r\n            Our country through?\r\n            It is the ball a-rolling on,\r\n  For Tippecanoe and Tyler too, Tippecanoe and Tyler too!\r\n\r\n  \"And with them we'll beat little Van, Van;\r\n            Van is a used-up man.\r\n  Oh, have you heard the news from Maine, Maine, Maine,\r\n            All honest and true?\r\n  One thousand for Kent and seven thousand gain\r\n            For Tippecanoe,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnd then Joe Hoxie would close the meetings by singing \"Up Salt River.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was pretty plain before November. New Hampshire, Connecticut,\r\nRhode Island, and Virginia voted for state officers in the spring. All\r\nhad voted for Van Buren in 1836; all now gave Whig majorities, except\r\nNew Hampshire, where the Democratic majority was greatly reduced. In\r\nAugust North Carolina was added to the Whig column, though in Missouri\r\nand Illinois there was little change. But when in September Maine, which\r\nhad given Van Buren nearly eight thousand majority, and had since\r\nremained steadfast, \"went hell-bent for Governor Kent\" and gave a slight\r\nWhig majority, the administration's doom was sealed.\r\n\r\nHarrison received 234 electoral votes, and Van Buren 60. New York gave\r\nHarrison 13,300 votes more than Van Buren; but a large part of this\r\nplurality, perhaps all, came from the counties on the northern and\r\nwestern borders. Only one Northern State, Illinois, voted for Van Buren.\r\nOf the slave States, five, Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Missouri,\r\nand Arkansas, were for Van Buren; the other eight for Harrison. There\r\nwas a popular majority in the slave States of about 55,000 against Van\r\nBuren in a total vote of about 695,000, and in the free States, of about\r\n90,000 in a total vote of about 1,700,000, still showing, therefore, his\r\ngreater popular strength in the free States. The increase in the popular\r\nvote was the most extraordinary the country has ever known, proving the\r\ndepth and universality of the feeling. This vote had been about\r\n1,500,000 in 1836; it reached about 2,400,000 in 1840, an increase of\r\n900,000, while from 1840 to the Clay canvass of 1844 it increased only\r\n300,000. Van Buren, as a defeated candidate in 1840, received about\r\n350,000 votes more than elected him in 1836; and the growth of\r\npopulation in the four years was probably less, not greater, than usual.\r\nThere were cries of \"fraud and corruption\" because of this enormously\r\nincreased vote, cries which Benton long afterwards seriously heeded; but\r\nthere seems to be no good reason to treat them otherwise than as one of\r\nthe many expressions of Democratic anguish.\r\n\r\nVan Buren received the seemingly crushing defeat with dignity and\r\ncomposure. While the cries of \"Van, Van, he's a used-up man,\" were\r\ncoming with some of the sting of truth through the White House windows,\r\nhe prepared the final message with which he met Congress in December,\r\n1840. The year, he said, had been one of \"health, plenty, and peace.\"\r\nAgain he declared the dangers of a national debt, and the equal dangers\r\nof too much money in the treasury; for \"practical economy in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs,\" he said, \"can have no adverse influence\r\nto contend with more powerful than a large surplus revenue.\" Again he\r\nattacked the national bank scheme. During four years of the greatest\r\npecuniary embarrassments ever known in time of peace, with a decreasing\r\npublic revenue, with a formidable opposition, his administration had\r\nbeen able punctually to meet every obligation without a bank, without a\r\npermanent national debt, and without incurring any liability which the\r\nordinary resources of the government would not speedily discharge. If\r\nthe public service had been thus independently sustained without either\r\nof these fruitful sources of discord, had we not a right to expect that\r\nthis policy would \"receive the final sanction of a people whose unbiased\r\nand fairly elicited judgment upon public affairs is never ultimately\r\nwrong?\" Again with a clear emphasis he declared against any attempt of\r\nthe government to repair private losses sustained in private business,\r\neither by direct appropriations or by legislation designed to secure\r\nexclusive privileges to individuals or classes. In the very last words\r\nof this, his last message, he gave an account of his efforts to suppress\r\nthe slave trade, and to prevent \"the prostitution of the American flag\r\nto this inhuman purpose,\" asking Congress, by a prohibition of the\r\nAmerican trade which took supplies to the slave factories on the African\r\ncoast, to break up \"those dens of iniquity.\"\r\n\r\nThe short session of Congress was hardly more than a jubilee of the\r\nWhigs, happily ignorant of the complete chagrin and frustration of their\r\nhopes which a few months would bring. Some new bank suspensions occurred\r\nin Philadelphia, and among banks closely connected with that city. The\r\nBank of the United States, after a resumption for twenty days,\r\nsuccumbed amid its own loud protestations of solvency, its final\r\ndisgrace and ruin being, however, deferred a little longer.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's cabinet had somewhat changed since his inauguration. In 1838\r\nhis old friend and ally, and one of the chief champions of his policy,\r\nBenjamin F. Butler, resigned the office of attorney-general, but without\r\nany break political or personal, as was seen in his fine and arduous\r\nlabors in the canvass of 1840 and in the Democratic convention of 1844.\r\nFelix Grundy of Tennessee then held the place until late in 1839, when\r\nhe resigned. Van Buren offered it, though without much heartiness, to\r\nJames Buchanan, who preferred, however, to retain his seat in the\r\nSenate; and Henry D. Gilpin, another Pennsylvanian, was appointed. Amos\r\nKendall's enormous industry and singular equipment of doctrinaire\r\nconvictions, narrow prejudices, executive ability, and practical\r\npolitical skill and craft, were lost to the administration through the\r\nfailure of his health in the midst of the campaign of 1840. In an\r\naddress to the public he gave a curious proof that for him work was more\r\nwearing in public than in private service. He stated that as he was poor\r\nhe should resort to private employment suitable to his health; and that\r\nhe proposed, therefore, during the canvass to write for the \"Globe\" in\r\ndefense of the President, in whose integrity, principles, and firmness\r\nhis confidence, he said, had increased. In 1838, when his health had\r\nthreatened to be unequal to his work, Van Buren had offered him the\r\nmission to Spain, if it should become vacant. John M. Niles, formerly a\r\nDemocratic senator from Connecticut, took Kendall's place in the\r\npost-office.\r\n\r\nVan Buren welcomed Harrison to the White House, and before the\r\ninauguration entertained him there as a guest, with the easy and\r\ndignified courtesy so natural to him, and in marked contrast to the\r\nabsence of social amenities on either side at the great change twelve\r\nyears before. Under Van Buren indeed the executive mansion was\r\nadministered with elevated grace. There was about it, while he was its\r\nmaster, the unostentatious elegance suited to the dwelling of the chief\r\nmagistrate of the great republic. There were many flings at him for his\r\ngreat economy, and what was called his parsimony; but he was accused as\r\nwell of undemocratic luxury. The talk seemed never to end over the gold\r\nspoons. The contradictory charges point out the truth. Van Buren was an\r\neminently prudent man. He did not indulge in the careless and useless\r\nwaste which impoverished Jefferson and Jackson. By sensible and\r\nhonorable economy he is said to have saved one half of the salary of\r\n$25,000 a year then paid to the President.[17] Returning to private life,\r\nhe was spared the humiliation of pecuniary trouble, which had\r\ndistressed three at least of his predecessors. But with his exquisite\r\nsense of propriety, he had not failed to order the White House with\r\nfitting decorum and a modest state. His son Abraham Van Buren was his\r\nprivate secretary; and after the latter's marriage, in November, 1838,\r\nto Miss Singleton of South Carolina, a niece of Andrew Stevenson, and a\r\nrelation of Mrs. Madison, he and his wife formed the presidential\r\nfamily. In 1841 they accompanied the ex-President to his retirement at\r\nLindenwald.\r\n\r\nUnder Andrew Jackson the social air of the White House had suffered from\r\nhis ill-health and the bitterness of his partisanship; and in this\r\nrespect the change to his successor was most pleasing. Van Buren used an\r\nagreeable tact with even his strongest opponents; and about his levees\r\nand receptions there were a charm and a grace by no means usual in the\r\ndwellings of American public men. He had, we are told in the\r\nRecollections of Sargent, a political adversary of his, \"the high art of\r\nblending dignity with ease and gravity.\" He introduced the custom of\r\ndining with the heads of departments and foreign ministers, although\r\nwith that exception he observed the etiquette of never being the guest\r\nof others at Washington. Judge Story mentions the \"splendid dinner\"\r\ngiven by the President to the judges in January, 1839.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams's diary bears unintended testimony to Van Buren's\r\nadmirable personal bearing in office. From the time he reached\r\nWashington as secretary of state, he had treated Adams in his defeat\r\nwith marked distinction and deference, which Adams, as he records,\r\naccepted in his own house, in the White House, and elsewhere. At a\r\nsocial party the President, he said, \"was, as usual, courteous to all,\r\nand particularly to me.\" Van Buren had therefore every reason to suppose\r\nthat there was between himself and Adams a not unfriendly personal\r\nesteem. But Adams, in his churlish, bitter temper, apparently found in\r\nthese wise and generous civilities only evidence of a mean spirit. After\r\none visit at the White House during the height of the crisis of 1837, he\r\nrecorded that he found Van Buren looking, not wretched, as he had been\r\ntold, but composed and tranquil. Returning home from this observation of\r\nthe President's \"calmness, his gentleness of manner, his easy and\r\nconciliatory temper,\" this often unmannerly pen described besides \"his\r\nobsequiousness, his sycophancy, his profound dissimulation and\r\nduplicity, ... his fawning civility.\" In a passage which was remarkable\r\nin that time of political bitterness so largely personal, Clay said, in\r\nhis parliamentary duel with Calhoun, after the latter rejoined the\r\nDemocratic party, that he remembered Calhoun attributing to the\r\nPresident the qualities of \"the most crafty, most skulking, and the\r\nmeanest of the quadruped tribe.\" Saying that he had not shared Calhoun's\r\nopinion, he then added of Van Buren:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have always found him in his manner and deportment, civil,\r\n    courteous, and gentlemanly; and he dispenses in the noble mansion\r\n    which he now occupies, one worthy the residence of the chief\r\n    magistrate of a great people, a generous and liberal hospitality.\r\n    An acquaintance with him of more than twenty years' duration has\r\n    inspired me with a respect for the man, although I regret to be\r\n    compelled to say, I detest the magistrate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nEX-PRESIDENT.--SLAVERY.--TEXAS ANNEXATION.--DEFEAT BY THE\r\nSOUTH.--FREE-SOIL CAMPAIGN.--LAST YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Buren loitered at Washington a few days after his presidency was\r\nover, and on his way home stopped at Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New\r\nYork. At New York he was finely welcomed. Amid great crowds he was taken\r\nto the City Hall in a procession headed by Captain Brown's corps of\r\nlancers and a body of armed firemen. He reached Kinderhook on May 15,\r\n1841, there to make his home until his death. He had, after the seemly\r\nand pleasing fashion of many men in American public life, lately\r\npurchased, near this village among the hills of Columbia county, the\r\nresidence of William P. Van Ness, where Irving had thirty years before\r\nlived in seclusion after the death of his betrothed, and had put the\r\nlast touches to his Knickerbocker. It was an old estate, whose lands had\r\nbeen rented for twenty years and under cultivation for a hundred and\r\nsixty, and from which Van Buren now managed to secure a profit. To this\r\nseat he gave the name of Lindenwald, a name which in secret he probably\r\nhoped the American people would come to group with Monticello,\r\nMontpellier, and the Hermitage. But this could not be. Van Buren had\r\nserved but half the presidential term of honor. He was not a sage, but\r\nstill a candidate for the presidency. Before the electoral votes were\r\ncounted in 1841, Benton declared for his renomination in 1844; and until\r\nthe latter year he again held the interesting and powerful but critical\r\nplace of the probable candidate of his party for the presidency. He\r\nremained easily the chief figure in the Democratic ranks. His defeat had\r\nnot taken from him that honor which is the property of the statesman\r\nstanding for a cause whose righteousness and promise belong to the\r\nassured future. His defeat signified no personal, no political fault. It\r\nhad come to him from a widespread convulsion for which, perhaps less\r\nthan any great American of his time, he was responsible. His party could\r\nnot abandon its battle for a limited and non-paternal government and\r\nagainst the use of public moneys by private persons. It could not\r\ntherefore abandon him; for more than any other man who had not now\r\nfinally retired he represented these causes in his own person. But his\r\neasy composure of manner did not altogether hide that eating and\r\nrestless anxiety which so often attends the supreme ambition of the\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nTwo days after leaving the White House, Van Buren said, in reply to\r\ncomplimentary resolutions of the legislature of Missouri, that he did\r\nnot utterly lament the bitter attacks upon him; for experience had\r\ntaught him that few political men were praised by their foes until they\r\nwere about abandoning their friends. With a pleasing frankness he\r\nadmitted that to be worthy of the presidency and to reach it had been\r\nthe object of his \"most earnest desire;\" but he said that the selection\r\nof the next Democratic candidate must be decided by its probable effect\r\nupon the principles for which they had just fought, and not upon any\r\nsupposition that he had been wounded or embittered by his defeat in\r\ntheir defense. His description of a candidate meant himself, however,\r\nand rightly enough. In November, 1841, he wrote of the \"apparent success\r\nof last year's buffoonery;\" and intimated that, though he would take no\r\nstep to be a candidate, it was not true that he had said he should\r\ndecline a nomination.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1842, the ex-President made a trip through the South, in\r\ncompany with James K. Paulding, visiting on his return Clay at Ashland,\r\nand Jackson at the Hermitage. He was one of the very few men on\r\npersonally friendly terms with both those long-time enemies. At Ashland,\r\ndoubtless, Texas was talked over, even if a bargain were not made, as\r\nhas been fancied, that Clay and Van Buren should remove the troublesome\r\nquestion from politics. In a fashion very different from that of modern\r\ncandidates, he now wrote, from time to time, able, long, and explicit,\r\nbut somewhat tedious letters on political questions. In one of them he\r\ntouched protection more clearly than ever before. He favored, he said\r\nin February, 1843, a tariff for revenue only; the \"incidental\r\nprotection\" which that must give many American manufacturers was all the\r\nprotection which should be permitted; the mechanics and laborers had\r\nbeen the chief sufferers from a \"high protective tariff.\" He was at last\r\nand definitely \"a low tariff man.\" He declared that he should support\r\nthe Democratic candidate of 1844; for he believed it to be impossible\r\nthat a selection from that source should not accord with his views. He\r\ndid not perhaps realize to how extreme a test his sincerity would be\r\nput. He added words which four years later read strangely enough. \"My\r\nname and pretensions,\" he said, \"however subordinate in importance,\r\nshall never be at the disposal of any person whatever, for the purpose\r\nof creating distractions or divisions in the Democratic party.\"\r\n\r\nThe party was indeed known as the \"Van Buren party\" until 1844, so\r\nnearly universal was the supposition that he was to be renominated, and\r\nso plainly was he its leader. The disasters which had now overtaken the\r\nWhigs made his return to power seem probable enough. The utterly\r\nincongruous elements held together during the sharp discontent and\r\nwonderful but inarticulate enthusiasm of 1840 had quickly fallen apart.\r\nWhile on his way to Kinderhook Van Buren was the chief figure in the\r\nobsequies at New York of his successful competitor. This honest man, of\r\nwhom John Quincy Adams said, with his usual savage exaggeration, that\r\nhis dull sayings were repeated for wit and his grave inanity passed off\r\nfor wisdom, had already quarreled with the splendid leader whose place\r\nhe was too conscious of usurping. Tyler's accession was the first, but\r\nnot the last illustration, which American politicians have had of the\r\ndanger of securing the presidency by an award of the second place to a\r\nknown opponent of the principles whose success they seek. Tyler had not\r\nbefore his nomination concealed his narrow and Democratic views of\r\ngovernment. The Whigs had ostentatiously refused to declare any\r\nprinciples when they nominated him. In technical conscientiousness he\r\nmarched with a step by no means cowardly to unhonored political\r\nisolation, as a quarter of a century later marched another\r\nvice-president nominated by a party in whose ranks he too was a new\r\nrecruit.\r\n\r\nUpon Tyler's veto of the bill for a national bank, an outcry of agony\r\nwent up from the Whigs; the whole cabinet, except Webster, resigned; a\r\nnew cabinet was formed, partly from the Conservatives; and by 1844,\r\nTyler was a forlorn candidate for the Democratic nomination, which he\r\nclaimed for his support of the annexation of Texas.\r\n\r\nUpon this first of the great pro-slavery movements Van Buren was\r\ndefeated for the Democratic nomination in 1844, although it seemed\r\nassured to him by every consideration of party loyalty, obligation, and\r\nwise foresight. The relations of government to private business ceased\r\nto be the dominant political question a few months and only a few\r\nmonths too soon to enable Van Buren to complete his eight years. Slavery\r\narose in place of economics.\r\n\r\nNo mistake is more common in the review of American history than to\r\nsuppose that slavery was an active or definite force in organized\r\nAmerican politics after the Missouri Compromise and before the struggle\r\nfor the annexation of Texas under Tyler's administration. The appeals of\r\nthe abolitionists to the simpler and deeper feelings of humanity were\r\nindeed at work before 1835; and from that year on they were profoundly\r\nstirring the American conscience and storing up tremendous moral energy.\r\nBut slavery was not in partisan politics. In 1836 and 1840 there was\r\nupon slavery no real difference between the utterances of the candidates\r\nand other leaders, Whig and Democratic, whether North or South. Van\r\nBuren was supported by many abolitionists; the profoundest distrust of\r\nhim was at the South. Upon no question touching slavery with which the\r\npresident could have concern, did his opinions or his utterances differ\r\nfrom those of John Quincy Adams. Clay said in November, 1838, that the\r\nabolitionists denounced him as a slaveholder and the slaveholders\r\ndenounced him as an abolitionist, while both united on Van Buren. The\r\ncharge of truckling to the South, traditionally made against Van Buren,\r\nis justified by no utterance or act different from those made by all\r\nAmerican public men of distinction at the time, except perhaps in two\r\ninstances,--his vote as vice-president for Kendall's bill against\r\nsending inflammatory abolition circulars through the post-office to\r\nStates which prohibited their circulation, and his approval of the rules\r\nin the Senate and House for tabling or refusing abolition petitions\r\nwithout reading them. But neither of these, as has been shown, was a\r\ndecisive test. In the first case he met a political trick; and for his\r\nvote there was justly much to be said on the reason of the thing, apart\r\nfrom Southern wishes. As late as 1848, Webster, in criticising Van\r\nBuren's inconsistency, would say no more of the law than that it was one\r\n\"of very doubtful propriety;\" and declared that he himself should agree\r\nto legislation by Congress to protect the South \"from incitements to\r\ninsurrection.\" In the second case Van Buren's position in public life\r\nmight of itself properly restrain him from acquiescing in an agitation\r\nin Congress for measures which, with all responsible public men, Adams\r\nincluded, he believed Congress ought not to pass.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic convention was to meet in May, 1844. The delegates had\r\nbeen very generally instructed for Van Buren; and two months before it\r\nassembled his nomination seemed beyond doubt. But the slave States were\r\nnow fired with a barbarous enthusiasm to extend slavery by annexing\r\nTexas. To this Van Buren was supposed to be hostile. His Southern\r\nopponents, in February, 1843, skillfully procured from Jackson, innocent\r\nof the plan, a strong letter in favor of the annexation, to be used, it\r\nwas said, just before the convention, \"to blow Van out of water.\" The\r\nletter was first published in March, 1844. Van Buren was at once put to\r\na crucial test. His administration had been adverse to annexation; his\r\nopinion was still adverse. But a large, and not improbably a controlling\r\nsection of his party, aided by Jackson's wonderful prestige, deemed it\r\nthe most important of political causes. Van Buren was, according to the\r\nplan, explicitly asked by a Southern delegate to state, with distinct\r\nreference to the action of the convention, what were his opinions.\r\n\r\nThe ex-President deeply desired the nomination; and the nomination\r\nseemed conditioned upon his surrender. It was at least assured if he now\r\ngave no offense to the South. But he did not flinch. He resorted to no\r\nsafe generalizations. His views upon the annexation were, he admitted,\r\ndifferent from those of many friends, political and personal; but in\r\n1837 his administration after a careful consideration had decided\r\nagainst annexation of the State whose independence had lately been\r\nrecognized by the United States; the situation had not changed;\r\nimmediate annexation would place a weapon in the hands of those who\r\nlooked upon Americans and American institutions with distrustful and\r\nenvious eyes, and would do us far more real and lasting injury than the\r\nnew territory, however valuable, could repair. He intimated that there\r\nwas jobbery in some of the enthusiasm for the annexation. The argument\r\nthat England might acquire Texas was without force; when England sought\r\nin Texas more than the usual commercial favors, it would be time for the\r\nUnited States to interfere. He was aware, he said, of the hazard to\r\nwhich he exposed his standing with his Southern fellow-citizens, \"of\r\nwhom it was aptly and appropriately said by one of their own number that\r\n'they are the children of the sun and partake of its warmth.'\" But\r\nwhether we stand or fall, he said, it is always true wisdom as well as\r\ntrue morality to hold fast to the truth. If to nourish enthusiasm were\r\none of the effects of a genial climate, it seldom failed to give birth\r\nto a chivalrous spirit. To preserve our national escutcheon untarnished\r\nhad always been the unceasing solicitude of Southern statesmen. The only\r\ntempering he gave his refusal was to say that if, after the subject had\r\nbeen fully discussed, a Congress chosen with reference to the question\r\nshowed the popular will to favor it, he would yield.[18] Van Buren thus\r\nclosed his letter: \"Nor can I in any extremity be induced to cast a\r\nshade over the motives of my past life, by changes or concealments of\r\nopinions maturely formed upon a great national question, for the\r\nunworthy purpose of increasing my chances for political promotion.\"\r\n\r\nTo a presidential candidate the eve of a national convention is dim with\r\nthe self-deceiving twilight of sophistry; and the twilight deepens when\r\na question is put upon which there is a division among those who are, or\r\nwho may be, his supporters. He can keep silence, he can procure the\r\nquestioning friend to withdraw the troublesome inquiry; he can ignore\r\nthe question from an enemy; he can affect an enigmatical dignity. Van\r\nBuren did neither of these. His Texas letter was one of the finest and\r\nbravest pieces of political courage, and deserves from Americans a long\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nThe danger of Van Buren's difference with Jackson it was sought to\r\navert. Butler visited Jackson at the Hermitage, and doubtless showed him\r\nfor what a sinister end he had been used. Jackson did not withdraw his\r\napproval of annexation; but publicly declared his regard for Van Buren\r\nto be so great, his confidence in Van Buren's love of country to be so\r\nstrengthened by long intimacy, that no difference about Texas could\r\nchange his opinions. Van Buren's nomination was again widely supposed\r\nto be assured. But the work of Calhoun and Robert J. Walker had been too\r\nwell done. The convention met at Baltimore on May 27, 1844. George\r\nBancroft headed the delegation from Massachusetts. Before the Rev. Dr.\r\nJohns had \"fervently addressed the Throne of Grace\" or the Rev. Mr.\r\nMcJilton had \"read a scripture lesson,\" the real contest took place over\r\nthe adoption of the rule requiring a two thirds vote for a nomination.\r\nFor it was through this rule that enough Southern members, chosen before\r\nVan Buren's letter as they had been, were to escape obedience to their\r\ninstructions to vote for him. Robert J. Walker, then a senator from\r\nMississippi, a man of interesting history and large ability, led the\r\nSoutherners. He quoted the precedent of 1832, when Van Buren had been\r\nnominated for the vice-presidency under the two thirds rule, and that of\r\n1835, when he had been nominated for the presidency. These nominations\r\nhad led to victory. In 1840 the rule had not been adopted. Without this\r\nrule, he said amid angry excitement, the party would yield to those\r\nwhose motto seemed to be \"rule or ruin.\" Butler, Daniel S. Dickinson,\r\nand Marcus Morton led the Northern ranks. Butler regretted that any\r\nmember should condescend to the allusion to 1840. That year, he said,\r\nhad been a debauchery of the nation's reason amid log cabins, hard\r\ncider, and coon-skins; and in an ecstasy of painful excitement at the\r\nrecollection and amid a tremendous burst of applause \"he leaped from\r\nthe floor and stamped ... as if treading beneath his feet the object of\r\nhis loathing.\" The true Democratic rule, he continued, required the\r\nminority to submit to the majority. Morton said that under the majority\r\nrule Jefferson had been nominated; that rule had governed state, county,\r\nand township conventions. Butler admitted that under the rule Van Buren\r\nwould not be nominated, although a majority of the convention was known\r\nto be for him. In 1832 and 1835 the two thirds rule had prevailed\r\nbecause it was certainly known who would be nominated; and the rule\r\noperated to aid not to defeat the majority. If the rule were adopted, it\r\nwould be by the votes of States which were not Democratic, and would\r\nbring \"dismemberment and final breaking up of the party.\" Walker laughed\r\nat Butler's \"tall vaulting\" from the floor; and, refusing to shrink from\r\nthe Van Buren issue, he protested against New York dictation, and\r\nwarningly said that, if Van Buren were nominated, Clay would be elected.\r\nAfter the convention had received with enthusiasm a floral gift from a\r\nDemocratic lady whom the President declared to be fairer than the\r\nflowers, the vote was taken. The two thirds rule was adopted by 148 to\r\n118. All the negatives were Northerners, except 14 from Missouri,\r\nMaryland, and North Carolina. Fifty-eight true \"Northern men with\r\nSouthern principles\" joined ninety Southerners in the affirmative. It\r\nwas really a vote on Van Buren,--or rather upon the annexation of\r\nTexas,--or rather still upon the extension of American slave territory.\r\nIt was the first battle, a sort of Bull Run, in the last and great\r\npolitical campaign between the interests of slavery and those of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nOn the first ballot for the candidate, Van Buren had 146 votes, 13 more\r\nthan a majority. If after the vote on the two thirds rule anything more\r\nwere required to show that some of these votes were given in mere formal\r\nobedience to instructions, the second ballot brought the proof. Van\r\nBuren then sank to 127, less than a majority; and on the seventh ballot\r\nto 99. A motion was made to declare him the nominee as the choice of a\r\nmajority of the convention; and there followed a scene of fury, the\r\nPresident bawling for order amid savage taunts between North and South,\r\nand bitter denunciations of the treachery of some of those who had\r\npledged themselves for Van Buren. Samuel Young of New York declared the\r\n\"abominable Texas question\" to be the fire-brand thrown among them by\r\nthe \"mongrel administration at Washington,\" whose hero was now doubtless\r\nfiddling while Rome was burning. Nero seems to have been Calhoun, though\r\nbetween the god-like young devil of antiquity wreathed with sensual\r\nfrenzy and infamy, and the solemn, even saturnine figure of the great\r\nmodern advocate of human slavery, the likeness seemed rather slight. The\r\nmotion was declared out of order; and the name of James K. Polk was\r\npresented as that of \"a pure whole-hogged Democrat.\" On the eighth\r\nballot he had 44 votes. Then followed the magnanimous scene of \"union\r\nand harmony\" which has so often, after a conflict, charmed a political\r\nbody into unworthy surrender. The great delegation from New York retired\r\nduring the ninth balloting; and returned to a convention profoundly\r\nsilent but thrilling with that bastard sense of coming glory in which a\r\nlately tumultuous and quarreling body waits the solution of its\r\ndifficulties already known to be reached but not yet declared. Butler\r\nquoted a letter which Van Buren had given him authorizing the withdrawal\r\nof his name if it were necessary for harmony; he eulogized Polk as a\r\nstrict constructionist, and closed by reading a letter from Jackson\r\nfervently urging Van Buren's nomination. Daniel S. Dickinson said that\r\n\"he loved this convention because it had acted so like the masses,\" and\r\ncast New York's 35 votes for Polk. The latter's nomination was declared\r\nwith the utmost joy, and sent to Washington over Morse's first telegraph\r\nline, just completed. Silas Wright of New York, Van Buren's strong\r\nfriend and a known opponent of annexation, was, in the fashion since\r\nfollowed, nominated for the vice-presidency, to soothe the feelings and\r\nthe conscience of the defeated. Wright peremptorily telegraphed his\r\nrefusal. He told his friends that he did \"not choose to ride behind on\r\nthe black pony.\" George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania took his place.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party now threw away all advantage of the issue made by\r\nthe undeserved defeat four years before. Thirty-six years later it\r\nrepeated the blunder in discarding Van Buren's famous neighbor and\r\ndisciple. Polk's was the first nomination by the party of a man of the\r\nsecond or of even a lower rank. Polk was known to have ability inferior\r\nnot only to that of Van Buren and Calhoun, but to Cass, Buchanan,\r\nWright, and others. He was the first presidential \"dark horse,\" and\r\nindeed hardly that. His own State of Tennessee had, by resolution,\r\npresented him as its choice for vice-president with Van Buren in the\r\nfirst place. He had been speaker of the national House, and later,\r\ngovernor of his State; but since holding these places had been twice\r\ndefeated for governor. In accepting the nomination he declared, with an\r\napparent fling at Van Buren, that, if elected, he should not accept a\r\nrenomination, and should thus enable the party in 1848 to make \"a free\r\nselection.\"\r\n\r\nThe nomination aroused disgust enough. \"Polk! Great God, what a\r\nnomination!\" Letcher, the Whig governor of Kentucky, wrote to Buchanan.\r\nBut the experiment of 1840 with the Whigs had been disastrous; the\r\npeople had swung back to the strict doctrines of the Democracy. Van\r\nBuren faithfully kept his promise to support the nomination; under his\r\nurgency Wright finally accepted the nomination for governor of New York.\r\nAnd by the vote of New York Henry Clay was defeated by a man vastly his\r\ninferior. Polk had 5000 plurality in that State; but Wright had 10,000.\r\nHad not James G. Birney, the abolitionist candidate who polled there\r\n15,812 votes, been in the field, not even Van Buren's party loyalty\r\nwould have prevented Clay's election. Van Buren's friends saved the\r\nState; but in doing so voted for annexation. In April, 1844, Clay had\r\nwritten a letter against annexation. As it appeared within a few days of\r\nVan Buren's letter, and as the personal relations between the two great\r\nparty leaders were most friendly, some have inferred an arrangement\r\nbetween them to take the question out of politics. This would indeed\r\nhave been an extraordinary occurrence. One might well wish to have\r\noverheard a negotiation between two rivals for the presidency to exclude\r\na great question distasteful to both. After the Democratic convention,\r\nTyler's treaty of annexation was rejected in the Senate by 35 to 16, six\r\nDemocrats from the North, among them Wright of New York and Benton of\r\nMissouri, voting against it. During the campaign Clay had weakly\r\nabandoned even the mild emphasis of his first opposition, and by flings\r\nat the abolitionists had openly bid for the pro-slavery vote; thus\r\nperhaps losing enough votes in New York to Birney to defeat him. After\r\nthe election the current for annexation seemed too strong; and a\r\nresolution passed both Houses authorizing the admission of Texas as a\r\nState. The resolution provided for the formation of four additional\r\nStates out of Texas. In any such additional State formed north of the\r\nMissouri compromise line, slavery was to be prohibited; but in those\r\nsouth of it slavery was to be permitted or prohibited as the inhabitants\r\nmight choose.\r\n\r\nSlavery was now clearly before the political conscience of the nation.\r\nVan Buren was the conspicuous victim of the first encounter. The\r\nBaltimore convention had in its platform complimented \"their illustrious\r\nfellow-citizen,\" \"his inflexible fidelity to the Constitution,\" his\r\n\"ability, integrity, and firmness,\" and had tendered to him, \"in\r\nhonorable retirement,\" the assurance of the deeply-seated \"confidence,\r\naffection, and respect of the American Democracy.\" This sentence to\r\n\"honorable retirement\" Van Buren, who was only in his sixty-second year\r\nand in the amplitude of his natural powers, received with outward\r\ncomplacency. On the eve of the election he pointed out, probably\r\nreferring to Cass, that the hostility to him had not been in the\r\ninterest of Polk, and warmly said that, unless the Democratic creed were\r\na delusion, personal feelings ought to be turned to nothing. Van Buren\r\nwas, however, profoundly affected by what he deemed the undeserved\r\nSouthern hostility to himself. For he hardly yet appreciated that his\r\ndefeat was politically legitimate, and not the result of political\r\ntreachery or envy. Between him and the Southern politicians had opened a\r\ntrue and deep division over the greatest single question in American\r\npolitics since Jefferson's election.\r\n\r\nWith Polk's accession and the Mexican war, the schism in the Democratic\r\nranks over the extension of American slave territory became plainer.\r\nEven during the canvass of 1844 a circular had been issued by William\r\nCullen Bryant, David Dudley Field, John W. Edmonds, and other Van Buren\r\nmen, supporting Polk, but urging the choice of congressmen opposed to\r\nannexation. Early in the new administration the division of New York\r\nDemocrats into \"Barnburners\" and \"Old Hunkers\" appeared. The former were\r\nthe strong pro-Van Buren, anti-Texas men, or \"radical Democrats,\" who\r\nwere likened to the farmer who burned his barn to clear it of rats. The\r\nlatter were the \"Northern men with Southern principles,\" the supporters\r\nof annexation, and the respectable, dull men of easy consciences, who\r\nwere said to hanker after the offices. The Barnburners were led by men\r\nof really eminent ability and exalted character: Silas Wright, then\r\ngovernor, Benjamin F. Butler, John A. Dix, chosen in 1845 to the United\r\nStates Senate, Azariah C. Flagg, the famous comptroller, and John Van\r\nBuren, the ex-President's son, and a singularly picturesque figure in\r\npolitics, who was, in 1845, made attorney-general by the legislature. He\r\nhad been familiarly called \"Prince John\" since his travels abroad during\r\nhis father's presidency. Daniel S. Dickinson and William L. Marcy were\r\nthe chief figures in the Hunker ranks. Polk seemed inclined, at the\r\nbeginning, to favor, or at least to placate, the Barnburners. He\r\noffered the Treasury to Wright, though he is said to have known that\r\nWright could not leave the governorship. He offered Butler the War\r\nDepartment, but the latter's devotion to his profession, for which he\r\nhad resigned the attorney-general's place in Van Buren's cabinet, made\r\nhim prefer the freedom of the United States attorneyship at New York,\r\nand Marcy was finally given the New York place in the cabinet. Jackson's\r\ndeath in June, 1845, deprived the Van Buren men of the tremendous moral\r\nweight which his name carried, and which might have daunted Polk. It\r\nperhaps also helped to loosen the weight of party ties on the Van Buren\r\nmen. After this the schism rapidly grew. In the fall election of 1845\r\nthe Barnburners pretty thoroughly controlled the Democratic party of the\r\nState in hostility to the Mexican war, which the annexation of Texas had\r\nnow brought. Samuel J. Tilden of Columbia county, and a profound admirer\r\nof Van Buren, became one of their younger leaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silas Wright]\r\n\r\nNow arose the strife over the \"Wilmot Proviso,\" in which was embodied\r\nthe opposition to the extension of slavery into new Territories. Upon\r\nthis proviso the modern Republican party was formed eight years later;\r\nupon it, fourteen years later, Abraham Lincoln was chosen president; and\r\nupon it began the war for the Union, out of whose throes came the vastly\r\ngrander and unsought beneficence of complete emancipation. David Wilmot\r\nwas a Democratic member of Congress from Pennsylvania; in New York he\r\nwould have been a Barnburner. In 1846 a bill was pending to appropriate\r\n$3,000,000 for use by the President in a purchase of territory from\r\nMexico as part of a peace. Wilmot proposed an amendment that slavery\r\nshould be excluded from any territory so acquired. All the Democratic\r\nmembers, as well as the Whigs from New York, and most strongly the Van\r\nBuren or Wright men, supported the proviso. The Democratic legislature\r\napproved it by the votes of the Whigs with the Barnburners and the Soft\r\nHunkers, the latter being Hunkers less friendly to slavery. It passed\r\nthe House at Washington, but was rejected by the Senate, not so quickly\r\nopen to popular sentiment. In the Democratic convention of New York, in\r\nOctober, 1846, the \"war for the extension of slavery\" was charged by the\r\nBarnburners on the Hunkers. The former were victorious, and Silas Wright\r\nwas renominated for governor, to be defeated, however, at the election.\r\nPolk, Marcy, and Dickinson, angered at the Democratic opposition in New\r\nYork to the pro-slavery Mexican policy, now threw all the weight of\r\nfederal patronage against the Barnburners, many of whom believed the\r\nadministration to have been responsible for Wright's defeat. Van Buren\r\nand his influence were completely separated from the national\r\nadministration. Just before the adjournment of Congress in 1847, the\r\nappropriation to secure territory from Mexico was again proposed. Again\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso was added in the House; again it was rejected in the\r\nSenate, to the defeat of the appropriation; and again Barnburners and\r\nWhigs carried in the New York legislature a resolution approving it, and\r\ndirecting the New York senators to support it.\r\n\r\nThe tide was rising. It seemed that Mexican law prohibited slavery in\r\nNew Mexico and California, and that upon their cession the principles of\r\ninternational law would preserve their condition of freedom. Benton,\r\ntherefore, deemed the Wilmot Proviso unnecessary; a \"thing of nothing in\r\nitself, and seized upon to conflagrate the States and dissolve the\r\nUnion.\" For the Supreme Court had not then pronounced slavery a\r\nnecessary accompaniment of American supremacy. But the legal protection\r\nof freedom was practically unsubstantial, even if not technical; there\r\ncould be no doubt of the determination of the South to carry slavery\r\ninto these Territories, whatever might be the obligations of either\r\nmunicipal or international law; and their conquest, therefore, made\r\nimminent a decision of the vital question whether slavery should be\r\nstill further extended.\r\n\r\nAt the Democratic convention at Syracuse, in September, 1847, the\r\nHunkers, after a fierce struggle over contested seats, seized control of\r\nthe body. David Dudley Field, for the Barnburners, proposed a resolution\r\nthat, although the Democracy of New York would faithfully adhere to the\r\ncompromises of the Constitution and maintain the reserved rights of the\r\nStates, they would still declare, since the crisis had come, \"their\r\nuncompromising hostility to the extension of slavery into territory now\r\nfree.\" This was defeated. The Barnburners then seceded, and issued an\r\naddress, in which Lawrence Van Buren, the ex-President's brother,\r\njoined. They protested that the anti-slavery resolution had been\r\ndefeated by a fraudulent organization of the convention, and called a\r\nmass meeting at Herkimer, on October 26, \"to avow their principles and\r\nconsult as to future action.\" The Herkimer convention was really an\r\nimportant preliminary to the formation of the modern Republican party.\r\nIt was a gathering of the ex-President's friends. Cambreleng, his old\r\nassociate, presided; David Wilmot addressed the meeting; and John Van\r\nBuren, now very conspicuous in politics, reported the resolutions. In\r\nthese the fraud at Syracuse was again denounced; a convention was called\r\nfor Washington's birthday in 1848, to choose Barnburner delegates to\r\ncontest the seats of those chosen by the Hunkers in the national\r\nDemocratic convention. It was declared that the freemen of New York\r\nwould not submit to slavery in the conquered provinces; and that,\r\nagainst the threat of Democrats at the South that they would support no\r\ncandidate for the presidency who did not assent to the extension of\r\nslavery, the Democrats of New York would proclaim their determination to\r\nvote for no candidate who did so assent.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Van Buren sympathized with all this. Relieved from the\r\nconstraint of power, there strongly revived his old hostility to\r\nslavery; he recalled his vote twenty-eight years before against\r\nadmitting Missouri otherwise than free. He now perceived how profound\r\nhad really been the political division between him and the Southern\r\nDemocrats when, in 1844, he wrote his Texas letter. Ignoring the\r\nlegitimate character of the politics of Polk's administration in denying\r\nofficial recognition or reward to Barnburners,--legitimate if, as Van\r\nBuren had himself pretty uniformly maintained, patronage should go to\r\nfriends rather than enemies, and if, as was obvious, there had arisen a\r\ntrue political division upon principles,--Van Buren was now touched with\r\nanger at the proscription of his friends. Excluded from the power which\r\nought to have belonged to the chief of Democrats enjoying even in\r\n\"honorable retirement\" the \"confidence, affection, and respect\" of his\r\nparty, independence rapidly grew less heinous in his eyes. One can\r\nhardly doubt that there now more freely welled up in his mind, to\r\nclarify its vision, the sense of personal wrong which, since Polk's\r\nnomination, had been so long held in magnanimous and dignified\r\nrestraint,--though of this he was probably unconscious. Van Buren was\r\nnot insincere when, in October, 1847, he wrote from Lindenwald to an\r\nenthusiastic Democratic editor in Pennsylvania, who had hoisted his name\r\nto the top of his columns for 1848. Whatever, he said, had been his\r\naspirations in the past, he now had no desire to be President; every day\r\nconfirmed him in the political opinions to which he had adhered.\r\nConscious of always having done his duty to the people to the best of\r\nhis ability, he had \"no heart burnings to be allayed and no resentments\r\nto be gratified by a restoration of power.\" Life at Lindenwald was\r\nentirely adapted to his taste; and he was (so he wrote, and so doubtless\r\nhe had forced himself to think) \"sincerely and heartily desirous to wear\r\nthe honors and enjoyments of private life uninterruptedly to the end.\"\r\nIf tendered a unanimous Democratic support with the assurance of the\r\nelection it would bring, he should not \"hesitate respectfully and\r\ngratefully, but decidedly to decline it,\" adding, however, the proviso\r\nso precious to public men, \"consulting only my own feelings and wishes.\"\r\nIt was in the last degree improbable, he said,--and so it was,--that any\r\nemergency should arise in which this indulgence of his own preferences\r\nwould, in the opinion of his true and faithful friends, conflict with\r\nhis duty to the party to which his whole life had been devoted, and to\r\nwhich he owed any personal sacrifice. The Mexican war had, he said, been\r\nso completely sanctioned by the government that it must be carried\r\nthrough; and, he ominously added, the propriety of thereafter\r\ninstituting inquiries into the necessity of its occurrence, so as to fix\r\nthe just responsibility to public opinion of public servants, was then\r\nout of season. Not a word of praise did he speak of Polk's\r\nadministration; in this he was for once truly and grimly\r\n\"non-committal.\"\r\n\r\nIn the New York canvass of 1847, the Barnburners, after their secession,\r\n\"talked of indifferent matters.\" The Whigs were therefore completely\r\nsuccessful. In the legislature the Barnburners, or \"Free-soilers\" as\r\nthey began to be called, outnumbered the Hunkers. Dickinson proposed in\r\nthe Senate at Washington a resolution, the precursor of Douglas's\r\n\"squatter sovereignty,\"--that all questions concerning the domestic\r\npolicy of the Territories should be left to their legislatures to be\r\nchosen by their people. Lewis Cass, now the coming candidate of the\r\nSouth, asserted in December, 1847, the same proposition, pointing out\r\nthat, if Congress could abolish the relation of master and servant in\r\nthe Territories, it might in like manner treat the relation of husband\r\nand wife. After this \"Nicholson letter\" of his, Cass might well have\r\nbeen asked whether he would have approved the admission of a State where\r\nthe last relation was forbidden, and where concubinage existed as a\r\n\"domestic institution.\" Dickinson's proposal meant that the first\r\nsettlers of each Territory should determine it to freedom or to slavery;\r\nit meant that in admitting new States the nation ought to be indifferent\r\nto their laws on slavery. If slavery were a mere incident in the polity\r\nof the State, a matter of taste or convenience, the proposition would\r\nhave been true enough. But euphemistic talk about \"domestic\r\ninstitutions\" blinded none but theorists or lovers of slavery to the\r\ntruth that slavery was a fearful and barbarous power, and that it must\r\nbecome paramount in any new Southern State, monstrous and corrupting in\r\nits tendencies towards savagery, unyielding, wasteful, and ruinous,--a\r\npower whose corruption and savagery, whose waste and ruin, debauched and\r\nenfeebled all communities closely allied to the States which maintained\r\nit,--a power in whose rapid growth, in whose affirmative and dictatorial\r\narrogance, and in the intellectual ability and even the moral\r\nexcellences of the aristocracy which administered it at the South, there\r\nwas an appalling menace. As well might one propose the admission to\r\npolitical intimacy and national unity of a State whose laws encouraged\r\nleprosy or required the funeral oblations of the suttee. If there were\r\nalready slave States in the confederacy, it was no less true that the\r\nnation had profoundly suffered from their slavery. Nor could all the\r\nphrases of constitutional lawyers make the slave-block, the black laws,\r\nand all the practices of this barbarism mere local peculiarities,\r\ndistasteful perhaps to the North but not concerning it, peculiarities to\r\nbe ranked with laws of descent or judicial procedure. Cass and Dickinson\r\nfor their surrender to the South were now called \"dough-faces\" and\r\n\"slavocrats\" by the Democratic Free-soilers. They were the true\r\n\"Northern men with Southern principles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Barnburners met at Utica on February 16, an earlier day than that\r\nfirst appointed, John Van Buren again being the chief figure. The\r\nconvention praised John A. Dix for supporting the Wilmot Proviso; and\r\ndeclared that Benton, a senator from a slave State, but now a sturdy\r\nopponent of extending the evil, and long the warm friend and admirer of\r\nVan Buren, had \"won a proud preëminence among the statesmen of the day.\"\r\nDelegates were chosen to the national convention to oppose the Hunkers.\r\nIn April, 1848, the Barnburner members of the legislature issued an\r\naddress, the authors of which were long afterwards disclosed by Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden to be himself and Martin and John Van Buren. At great length\r\nit demonstrated the Free-soil principles of the Democratic fathers.\r\n\r\nThe national convention assembled in May, 1848. It offered to admit the\r\nBarnburner and Hunker delegations together to cast the vote of the\r\nState. The Barnburners rejected the compromise as a simple nullification\r\nof the vote of the State, and then withdrew. Lewis Cass was nominated\r\nfor president, the Wilmot Proviso being thus emphatically condemned. For\r\nCass had declared in favor of letting the new Territories themselves\r\ndecide upon slavery. The Barnburners, returning to a great meeting in\r\nthe City Hall Park at New York, cried, \"The lash has resounded through\r\nthe halls of the Capitol!\" and condemned the cowardice of Northern\r\nsenators who had voted with the South. Among the letters read was one\r\nfrom Franklin Pierce, who had in 1844 voted against annexation, a letter\r\nwhich years afterwards was, with a reference to his famous friend and\r\nbiographer, called the \"Scarlet Letter.\" The delegates issued an\r\naddress written by Tilden, fearlessly calling Democrats to independent\r\naction. In June a Barnburner convention met at Utica. Its president,\r\nSamuel Young, who had refused at the convention at Baltimore in 1844 to\r\nvote for Polk when the rest of his delegation surrendered, said that if\r\nthe convention did its duty, a clap of political thunder would in\r\nNovember \"make the propagandists of slavery shake like Belshazzar.\"\r\nButler, John Van Buren, and Preston King, afterwards a Republican\r\nsenator, were there. David Dudley Field read an explicit declaration\r\nfrom the ex-President against the action and the candidates of the\r\nnational convention. This letter, whose prolixity is an extreme\r\nillustration of Van Buren's literary fault, created a profound\r\nimpression. He declared his \"unchangeable determination never again to\r\nbe a candidate for public office.\" The requirement by the national\r\nconvention that the New York delegates should pledge themselves to vote\r\nfor any candidate who might be nominated was, he said, an indignity of\r\nthe rankest character. The Virginia delegates had been permitted,\r\nwithout incurring a threat of exclusion, to declare that they would not\r\nsupport a certain nominee. The convention had not allowed the Democrats\r\nof New York fair representation, and its acts did not therefore bind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe point of political regularity, when discussed upon a technical\r\nbasis, was, however, by no means clear. The real question was whether\r\nthe surrender of the power of Congress over the Territories, and the\r\nrefusal to use that power to exclude slavery, accorded with Democratic\r\nprinciples. On this Van Buren was most explicit. Jefferson had proposed\r\nfreedom for the Northwest Territories; and all the representatives from\r\nthe slaveholding States had voted for the ordinance. Not only Washington\r\nand the elder and younger Adams had signed bills imposing freedom as the\r\ncondition of admitting new Territories or States, but those undoubted\r\nDemocrats, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and Jackson, had signed such\r\nbills; and so had he himself in 1838 in the case of Iowa. This power of\r\nCongress was part of \"the compromises of the Constitution,\" compromises\r\nwhich, \"deeply penetrated\" as he had been \"by the convictions that\r\nslavery was the only subject that could endanger our blessed Union,\" he\r\nhad, he was aware, gone further to sustain against Northern attacks than\r\nmany of his best friends approved. He would go no further. As the\r\nnational convention had rejected this old doctrine of the Democracy, he\r\nshould not vote for its candidate, General Cass; and if there were no\r\nother candidate but General Taylor, he should not vote for president. If\r\nour ancestors, when the opinion and conduct of the world about slavery\r\nwere very different, had rescued from slavery the territory now making\r\nfive great States, should we, he asked, in these later days, after the\r\ngigantic efforts of Great Britain for freedom, and when nearly all\r\nmankind were convinced of its evils, doom to slavery a territory from\r\nwhich as many more new States might be made. He counseled moderation and\r\nforbearance, but still a firm resistance to injustice.\r\n\r\nThis powerful declaration from the old chief of the Democracy was\r\ndecisive with the convention. Van Buren was nominated for president, and\r\nHenry Dodge, a Democratic senator of Wisconsin, for vice-president.\r\nDodge, however, declined, proud though he would be, as he said, to have\r\nhis name under other circumstances associated with Van Buren's. But his\r\nState had been represented in the Baltimore convention; and as one of\r\nits citizens he cordially concurred in the nomination of Cass. A\r\nnational convention was called to meet at Buffalo on August 9, 1848.\r\n\r\nCharles Francis Adams, the son of John Quincy Adams, presided at the\r\nBuffalo convention; and in it Joshua R. Giddings, the famous\r\nabolitionist, and Salmon P. Chase were conspicuous. To the unspeakable\r\nhorror of every Hunker there participated in the deliberations a negro,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Ward. Butler reported the resolutions in words whose\r\ninspiration is still fresh and ringing. They were assembled, it was\r\nsaid, \"to secure free soil for a free people;\" the Democratic and Whig\r\norganizations had been dissolved, the one by stifling the voice of a\r\ngreat constituency, the other by abandoning its principles for mere\r\navailability. Remembering the example of their fathers in the first\r\ndeclaration of independence, they now, putting their trust in God,\r\nplanted themselves on the national platform of freedom in opposition to\r\nthe sectional platform of slavery; they proposed no interference with\r\nslavery in any State, but its prohibition in the Territories then free;\r\nfor Congress, they said, had \"no more power to make a slave than to make\r\na king.\" There must be no more compromises with slavery. They accepted\r\nthe issue forced upon them by the slave power; and to its demand for\r\nmore slave States and more slave Territories, their calm and final\r\nanswer was, \"no more slave States and no more slave territory.\" At the\r\nclose were the stirring and memorable words: \"We inscribe on our banner,\r\nFree Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men; and under it we will\r\nfight on and fight ever, until a triumphant victory shall reward our\r\nexertions.\"\r\n\r\nJoshua Leavitt of Massachusetts, one of the \"blackest\" of abolitionists,\r\nreported to the convention the name of Martin Van Buren for president.\r\nAfter the convention was over, even Gerrit Smith, the ultra-abolitionist\r\ncandidate, declared that, of all the candidates whom there was the least\r\nreason to believe the convention would nominate, Van Buren was his\r\npreference. The nomination was enthusiastically made by acclamation,\r\nafter Van Buren had on an informal ballot received 159 votes to 129 cast\r\nfor John P. Hale. A brief letter from Van Buren was read, declaring that\r\nhis nomination at Utica had been against his earnest wishes; that he had\r\nyielded because his obligation to the friends, who had now gone so far,\r\nrequired him to abide by their decision that his name was necessary to\r\nenable \"the ever faithful Democracy of New York to sustain themselves in\r\nthe extraordinary position into which they have been driven by the\r\ninjustice of others;\" but that the abandonment at Buffalo of his Utica\r\nnomination would be most satisfactory to his feelings and wishes. The\r\nexclusion of slavery from the Territories was an object, he said,\r\n\"sacred in the sight of heaven, the accomplishment of which is due to\r\nthe memories of the great and just men long since, we trust, made\r\nperfect in its courts.\" Charles Francis Adams was nominated for\r\nvice-president; and dazzled and incredulous eyes beheld on a\r\npresidential ticket with Martin Van Buren the son of one of his oldest\r\nand bitterest adversaries. That adversary had died a few months before,\r\nthe best of his honors being his latest, those won in a querulous but\r\nvaliant old age, in a fiery fight for freedom.\r\n\r\nIn September, John A. Dix, then a Democratic senator, accepted the\r\nFree-soil nomination for governor of New York. The Democratic party was\r\naghast. The schismatics had suddenly gained great dignity and\r\nimportance. Martin Van Buren, the venerable leader of the party, its\r\nmost famous and distinguished member, this courtly, cautious\r\nstatesman,--could it be he rushing from that \"honorable retirement,\" to\r\nwhose safe retreat his party had committed him with so deep an\r\naffection, to consort with long-haired and wild-eyed abolitionists! He\r\nwas the arch \"apostate,\" leading fiends of disunion who would rather\r\nrule in hell than serve in heaven. Where now was his boasted loyalty to\r\nthe party? Rage struggled with loathing. All the ancient stories told of\r\nhim by Whig enemies were revived, and believed by those who had long\r\ntreated them with contempt. It is clear, however, that Van Buren's\r\nattitude was in no wise inconsistent with his record. His party had\r\nnever pronounced for the extension of slavery; nor had he. The Buffalo\r\nconvention was silent upon abolition in the District of Columbia. There\r\nwas for the time in politics but one question, and that was born of the\r\nannexation of Texas,--Shall slavery go into free territory? As amid the\r\nclash of arms the laws are stilled, so in the great fight for human\r\nfreedom, the independent treasury, the tariff, and internal improvements\r\ncould no longer divide Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs had in June nominated Taylor, one of the two heroes of the\r\nMexican war. It is a curious fact that Taylor had been authoritatively\r\nsounded by the Free-soil leaders as to an acceptance of their\r\nnomination. Clay and Webster were now discarded by their party for this\r\nbluff soldier, a Louisiana slaveholder of unknown politics; and with\r\nentire propriety and perfect caution the Whigs made no platform. A\r\ndeclaration against the extension of slavery was voted down. Webster\r\nsaid at Marshfield, after indignation at Taylor's nomination had a\r\nlittle worn away, that for \"the leader of the Free-_spoil_ party\" to\r\n\"become the leader of the Free-soil party would be a joke to shake his\r\nsides and mine.\" The anti-slavery Whigs hesitated for a time; but Seward\r\nof New York and Horace Greeley in the New York \"Tribune\" finally led\r\nmost of them to Taylor rather than, as Seward said, engage in \"guerrilla\r\nwarfare\" under Van Buren. Whigs must not, he added, leave the ranks\r\nbecause of the Whig affront to Clay and Webster. \"Is it not,\" he finely,\r\nthough for the occasion sophistically, said, \"by popular injustice that\r\ngreatness is burnished?\" This launching of the modern Republican party\r\nwas, strangely enough, to include in New York few besides Democrats. In\r\nNovember, 1847, the Liberty or Abolition party nominated John P. Hale\r\nfor president; but upon Van Buren's nomination he was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nUpon the popular vote in November, 1848, Van Buren received 291,263\r\nvotes, while there were 1,220,544 for Cass and 1,360,099 for Taylor. Van\r\nBuren had no electoral votes. In no State did he receive as many votes\r\nas Taylor; but in New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont he had more than\r\nCass. The vote of New York was an extraordinary tribute to his personal\r\npower; he had 120,510 votes to 114,318 for Cass; and it was clear that\r\nnearly all the former came from the Democratic party. In Ohio he had\r\n35,354 votes, most of which were probably drawn from the Whig\r\nabolitionists. In Massachusetts he had 38,058 votes, in no small part\r\nowing to the early splendor, the moral austerity and elevation of\r\nCharles Sumner's eloquence. \"It is not,\" he said, \"for the Van Buren of\r\n1838 that we are to vote; but for the Van Buren of to-day,--the veteran\r\nstatesman, sagacious, determined, experienced, who, at an age when most\r\nmen are rejoicing to put off their armor, girds himself anew and enters\r\nthe lists as champion of Freedom.\" Taylor had 163 electoral votes and\r\nCass 127.\r\n\r\nThe political career of Van Buren was now ended. It is mere speculation\r\nwhether he had thought his election a possible thing. That he should\r\nthink so was very unlikely. Few men had a cooler judgment of political\r\nprobabilities; few knew better how powerful was party discipline in the\r\nDemocratic ranks, for no one had done more to create it; few could have\r\nappreciated more truly the Whig hatred of himself. Still the wakening\r\nrush of moral sentiment was so strong, the bitterness of Van Buren's\r\nOhio and New York supporters had been so great at his defeat in 1844,\r\nthat it seemed not utterly absurd that those two States might vote for\r\nhim. If they did, that dream of every third party in America might come\r\ntrue,--the failure of either of the two great parties to obtain a\r\nmajority in the electoral college, and the consequent choice of\r\npresident in the House, where each of them might prefer the third party\r\nto its greater rival. Ambition to reënter the White House could indeed\r\nhave had but the slightest influence with him when he accepted the\r\nFree-soil nomination. Nor was his acceptance an act of revenge, as has\r\nvery commonly been said. The motives of a public man in such a case are\r\nsubtle and recondite even to himself. No distinguished political leader\r\nwith strong and publicly declared opinions, however exalted his temper,\r\ncan help uniting in his mind the cause for which he has fought with his\r\nown political fortunes. If he be attacked, he is certain to honestly\r\nbelieve the attack made upon the cause as well as upon himself. When his\r\nparty drives him from a leadership already occupied by him, he may\r\nsubmit without a murmur; but he will surely harbor the belief that his\r\nparty is playing false with its principles. In 1848 there was a great\r\nand new cause for which Van Buren stood, and upon which his party took\r\nthe wrong side; but doubtless his zeal burned somewhat hotter, the edge\r\nof his temper was somewhat keener, for what he thought the indignities\r\nto himself and his immediate political friends. To say this is simply to\r\npronounce him human. His acceptance of the nomination was given largely\r\nout of loyalty to those friends whose advice was strong and urgent. It\r\nwas the mistake which any old leader of a political party, who has\r\nenjoyed its honors, makes in the seeming effort--and every such\r\npolitical candidacy at least seems to be such an effort--to gratify his\r\npersonal ambition at its expense. Van Buren and his friends should have\r\nmade another take the nomination, to which his support, however\r\nvigorous, should have gone sorrowfully and reluctantly; and the form as\r\nwell as the substance of his relations to the canvass should have been\r\nwithout personal interest.\r\n\r\nHad Van Buren died just after the election of 1848 his reputation to-day\r\nwould be far higher. He had stood firmly, he had suffered politically,\r\nfor a clear, practical, and philosophical method and limitation of\r\ngovernment; he had adhered with strict loyalty to the party committed to\r\nthis method, until there had arisen the cause of human freedom, which\r\nfar transcended any question still open upon the method or limits of\r\ngovernment. With this cause newly risen, a cause surely not to leave the\r\npolitical field except in victory, he was now closely united. He might\r\ntherefore have safely trusted to the judgment of later days and of wiser\r\nand truer-sighted men, growing in number and influence every year. His\r\noffense could never be pardoned by his former associates at the South\r\nand their allies at the North. No confession of error, though it were\r\nfull of humiliation, no new and affectionate return to party allegiance,\r\ncould make them forget what they sincerely deemed astounding treason and\r\ndisastrous sacrilege. Loyal remembrance of his incomparable party\r\nservices had irretrievably gone, to be brought back by no reasoning and\r\nby no persuasion. If he were to live, he should not have wavered from\r\nhis last position. Its righteousness was to be plainer and plainer with\r\nthe passing years.\r\n\r\nVan Buren did live, however, long after his honorable battle and defeat;\r\nand lived to dim its honor by the faltering of mistaken patriotism. In\r\n1849, John Van Buren, during the efforts to unite the Democratic party\r\nin New York, declared it his wish to make it \"the great anti-slavery\r\nparty of the Union.\" Early in 1850 and when the compromise was\r\nthreatened at Washington, he wrote to the Free-soil convention of\r\nConnecticut that there had never been a time when the opponents of\r\nslavery extension were more urgently called to act with energy and\r\ndecision or to hold their representatives to a rigid responsibility, if\r\nthey faltered or betrayed their trust. With little doubt his father\r\napproved these utterances. A year later, however, the ex-President, with\r\nnearly all Northern men, yielded to the soporific which Clay in his old\r\nage administered to the American people. In their support of the great\r\ncompromise between slavery and freedom, Webster and Clay forfeited much\r\nof their fame, and justly. For though the cause of humanity gained a\r\nvast political advantage in the admission of California as a free State,\r\nthe advantage, it was plain, could not have been long delayed had there\r\nbeen no compromise. But the rest of the new territory was thrown into a\r\nstruggle among its settlers, although the power of Congress over the\r\nTerritories was not yet denied; and a fugitive-slave law of singular\r\natrocity was passed. All the famous Northern Whigs were now true\r\n\"doughfaces.\" Fillmore, president through Taylor's death, one of the\r\nmost dignified and timid of their number, signed the compromise bills.\r\n\r\nThe compromise being passed, Van Buren with almost the entire North\r\nsubmissively sought to believe slavery at last expelled from politics.\r\nIt would have been a wise heroism, it would have given Van Buren a\r\nclearer, a far higher place with posterity, if after 1848 he had even\r\ndone no more than remain completely aloof from the timid politics of the\r\ntime, if he had at least refused acquiescence in any compromise by which\r\nconcessions were made to slavery. But he was an old man. He shared with\r\nhis ancient and famous Whig rivals that intense love and almost\r\nadoration of the Union, upon which the arrogant leaders of the South so\r\nlong and so successfully played. The compromise was accomplished. It\r\nwould perhaps be the last concession to the furious advance of the cruel\r\nbarbarism. The free settlers in the new Territories would, he hoped, by\r\ntheir number and hardihood, defeat the incoming slave-owners, and even\r\nunder \"squatter sovereignty\" save their homes from slavery. If the Union\r\nshould now stand without further disturbance, all might still come right\r\nwithout civil war. Economic laws, the inexorable and beneficent progress\r\nof civilization, would perhaps begin, slowly indeed but surely, to press\r\nto its death this remnant of ancient savagery. But if the Union were to\r\nbe broken by a violation of the compromise, a vast and irremediable\r\ncatastrophe and ruin would undo all the patriotic labors of sixty\r\nyears, would dismiss to lasting unreality the dreams of three\r\ngenerations of great men who had loved their country. It seemed too\r\nappalling a responsibility.\r\n\r\nUpon all this reasoning there is much unfair modern judgment. The small\r\nnumber of resolute abolitionists, who cared little for the Union in\r\ncomparison with the one cause of human rights, and whose moral fervor\r\nfound in the compromises of the Constitution, so dear and sacred to all\r\nAmerican statesmen, only a covenant with hell, may for the moment be\r\nignored. Among them there was not a public man occupying politically\r\nresponsible or widely influential place. The vast body of Northern\r\nsentiment was in two great classes. The one was led by men like Seward,\r\nand even Benton, who considered the South a great bully. They believed\r\nthat to a firm front against the extension of slavery the South would,\r\nafter many fire-eating words, surrender in peace. The other class\r\nincluded most of the influential men of the day, some of them greater\r\nmen, some lesser, and some little men. Webster, Clay, Cass, Buchanan,\r\nMarcy, Douglas, Fillmore, Dickinson, were now joined by Van Buren and by\r\nmany Free-soil men of 1848 daunted at the seeming slowness with which\r\nthe divine mills were grinding. They believed that the South, to assert\r\nthe fancied \"rights\" of their monstrous wrong, would accept disunion and\r\neven more, that in this cause it would fiercely accept all the terrors\r\nof a civil war and its limitless devastation. The event proved the\r\nfirst men utterly in the wrong; and it was fortunate that their mistake\r\nwas not visible until in 1861 the battle was irreversibly joined. The\r\nsecond and more numerous class were right. There had to be yielding,\r\nunless such evils were to be let loose, unless Webster's \"ideas, so full\r\nof all that is horrid and horrible,\" were to come true. The anxiety not\r\nto offend the South was perhaps most strikingly shown after the election\r\nof Lincoln. A distinguished statesman of the modern Republican party has\r\nrecently pointed out[19] that in February, 1861, the Republican members\r\nof Congress, and among them Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens,\r\nacquiesced in the organization of the new Territories of Colorado,\r\nDakota, and Nevada, without any prohibition of slavery, thus ignoring\r\nthe very principle and the only principle upon which their great battle\r\nhad been fought and their great victory won.\r\n\r\nComplete truth dwelt only with the small and hated abolitionist\r\nminority. Without honored and influential leaders in political life they\r\nalone saw that war with all these horrors was better, or even a\r\nsuccessful secession was better, than further surrender of human rights,\r\na surrender whose corruption and barbarism would cloud all the glories,\r\nand destroy all the beneficence of the Union. No historical judgment has\r\nbeen more unjust and partial than the implied condemnation of Van Buren\r\nfor his acquiescence in Clay's compromise, while only gentle words have\r\nchided the great statesmen whose eloquence was more splendid and\r\ninspiring but whose devotion to the Union was never more supreme than\r\nVan Buren's,--statesmen who had made no sacrifice like his in 1844, who\r\nin their whitening years had taken no bold step like his in 1848, and\r\nwho had in 1850 actively promoted the surrender to which Van Buren did\r\nno more than submit after it was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the overwhelming agreement to the compromise brought on a\r\ncolorless presidential campaign, fought in a sort of fool's paradise.\r\nIts character was well represented by Franklin Pierce, the second\r\nDemocratic mediocrity raised to the first place in the party and the\r\nland, and by the absurd political figure of General Scott, fitly enough\r\nthe last candidate of the decayed Whig party. Both parties heartily\r\napproved the compromise, but it mattered little which of the two\r\ncandidates were chosen. The votes cast for John P. Hale, the Free-soil\r\ncandidate, were as much more significant and honorable as they were\r\nfewer than those cast for Pierce or Scott. Van Buren, in a note to a\r\nmeeting in New York, declared that time and circumstances had issued\r\nedicts against his attendance, but that he earnestly wished for Pierce's\r\nelection. He attempted no argument in this, perhaps the shortest\r\npolitical letter he ever wrote. But John Van Buren, in a speech at\r\nAlbany, gave some reasons which prevent much condemnation of his\r\nfather's perfunctory acquiescence in the action of his party. The\r\nmovement of 1848, he said, had been intended to prevent the extension of\r\nslavery. Since then, California had come in, a Free State, and not, as\r\nthe South had desired, a slave State; and \"the abolition of the slave\r\nmarket in the District of Columbia was another great point gained.\" The\r\npoverty of reasons was shown in the eager insistence that every member\r\nof Congress from New Hampshire had voted against slavery extension, and\r\nthat the Democratic party now took its candidate from that State\r\n\"without any pledges whatever.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this election Van Buren spent two years in Europe. President\r\nPierce tendered him the position of the American arbitrator upon the\r\nBritish-American claims commission established under the treaty of\r\nFebruary 8, 1853, but he declined. During his absence the South secured\r\nthe Kansas-Nebraska bill, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and the\r\npractical opening to slavery of the new Territories north of the line of\r\n36° 30'. If the settlers of Kansas, which lay wholly on the free side of\r\nthat compromise line, desired slavery, they were to have it. But even\r\nthis was not sufficient. The hardy settlers of this frontier, separated\r\nthough they were by the slave State of Missouri from free soil and free\r\ninfluences, would, it now seemed, pretty certainly favor freedom. The\r\nermine of the Supreme Court had, therefore, to be used to sanctify with\r\nthe Dred Scott decision the last demand of slavery, inconsistent though\r\nit was with the claims of the South from the time when it secured the\r\nMissouri Compromise until Calhoun grimly advanced his monstrous\r\npropositions. Slavery was to be decreed a constitutional right in all\r\nTerritories, whose exercise in them Congress was without power to\r\nprohibit, and which could not be prevented even by the majority of their\r\nsettlers until they were admitted as States.\r\n\r\nVan Buren came back to America when there was still secret within the\r\njudicial breast the momentous decision that the American flag carried\r\nhuman slavery with it to conquered territory as a necessary incident of\r\nits stars and stripes, and that Congress could not, if it would, save\r\nthe land to freedom. Van Buren voted for Buchanan; a vote essentially\r\ninconsistent with his Free-soil position, a vote deeply to be regretted.\r\nHe still thought that free settlers would defeat the intention of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska act, and bring in, as they afterwards did, a free though\r\nbleeding Kansas. There was something crude and menacing in this new\r\nRepublican party, and in its enormous and growing enthusiasm. It was\r\nhard to believe that its candidate had been seriously selected for chief\r\nmagistrate of the United States. Fremont probably seemed to Van Buren a\r\npicturesque sentimentalist leading the way to civil war, which, if it\r\nwere to come, ought, so it seemed to this former senator and minister\r\nand president, to be led in by serious and disciplined statesmen. The\r\nnew party was repulsive to him as a body chiefly of Whigs; old and\r\nbitter adversaries whom he distrusted, with hosts of camp-followers\r\nsmelling the coming spoils. All this a young man might endure, when he\r\nsaw the clear fact that the Republican convention, ignoring for the time\r\nall former differences, had pronounced not a word inconsistent with the\r\nDemocratic platform of 1840, and had made only the one declaration\r\nessential to American freedom and right, that slavery should not go into\r\nthe Territories. Van Buren was not, however, a young man, or one of the\r\nfew old men in whom a fiery sense of morality, and an eager and buoyant\r\nresolution, are unchilled by thinner and slower blood, and indomitably\r\novercome the conservative influences of age. A bold outcry from him,\r\neven now, would have placed him for posterity in one of the few niches\r\nset apart to the very greatest Americans. But since 1848 Van Buren had\r\ncome to seventy-four years.\r\n\r\nInvited to the Tammany Hall celebration of Independence Day, he wrote,\r\non June 28, 1856, a letter in behalf of Buchanan. There was no\r\ndiminution in explicit clearness; but hope was nearly gone; the peril of\r\nthe Union obscured every other danger; the South was so threatening that\r\npatriotism seemed to him to require at the least a surrender to all that\r\nhad passed; and for the future our best reliance would be upon a fair\r\nvote in Kansas between freedom and slavery. He could not come to its\r\nmeeting, he told Tammany Hall, because of his age. He had left one\r\ninvitation unanswered; and if he were so to leave another, he might be\r\nsuspected of a desire to conceal his sentiments. But this letter should\r\nbe his last, as it was his first, appearance in the canvass. He was glad\r\nof the Democratic reunion; for although not always perfectly right, in\r\nno other party had there been \"such exclusive regard and devotion to the\r\nmaintenance of human rights and the happiness and welfare of the masses\r\nof the people.\" There was a touch of age in his fond recitals of the\r\nlong services of that party since, in Jefferson's days, it had its\r\norigin with \"the root-and-branch friends of the Republican system;\" of\r\nits support of the war of 1812; of its destruction of the national bank;\r\nof its establishment of an independent treasury. But slavery, he\r\nadmitted, was now the living issue. Upon that he had no regrets for his\r\ncourse. He had always preferred the method of dealing with that\r\ninstitution practiced by the founders of the government. He lamented the\r\nrecent departure from that method; no one was more sincerely opposed\r\nthan himself to the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. He had heard of\r\nit, and condemned it in a foreign land; he had there foreseen the\r\ndisastrous reopening of the slavery agitation. But the measure was now\r\naccomplished; there was no more left than to decide what was the best\r\nnow to do. The Kansas-Nebraska act had, he said, gradually become less\r\nobnoxious to him; though this impression, he admitted, might result from\r\nthe unanimous acquiescence in it of the party in which he had been\r\nreared. Its operation, he trusted, would be beneficial; and he had now\r\ncome to believe that the feelings and opinions of the free States would\r\nbe more respected under its provisions than by specific congressional\r\ninterference. He did not doubt the power of Congress to enable the\r\npeople of a Territory to exclude slavery. Buchanan's pledge to use the\r\npresidential power to restore harmony among the sister States could be\r\nredeemed in but one way; and that was, to secure to the actual settlers\r\nof the Territory a \"full, free, and practical enjoyment\" of the rights\r\nof suffrage on the slavery question conferred by the act. He praised\r\nBuchanan, if not exuberantly, still sufficiently. He must, Van Buren\r\nthought, be solicitous for his reputation in the near \"evening of his\r\nlife.\" He believed that Buchanan would redeem his pledge, and should\r\ntherefore cheerfully support him. If Buchanan were elected, there were\r\n\"good grounds for hope\" that the Union might be saved. Such was this\r\nsaddening and despondent letter. It was a defense of a vote which it was\r\nrather sorry work that he should have needed to make. But the tramp of\r\narmies and the conflagration of American institutions were heard and\r\nseen in the sky with terrifying vividness. The letter secured, however,\r\nno forgiveness from the angry South. The \"Richmond Whig\" said: \"If there\r\nis a man within the limits of the Republic who is cordially abhorred and\r\ndetested by intelligent and patriotic men of all parties at the South,\r\nthat man is Martin Van Buren.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the best Americans shared Van Buren's distrust of Fremont and of\r\nthose who supported Fremont; they shared his love of peace and his fear\r\nof that bloodshed, North and South, which seemed the dismal El Dorado to\r\nwhich the \"pathfinder's\" feet were surely tending. So the majority of\r\nthe Northern voters thought; for those north of Mason and Dixon's line\r\nwho divided themselves between Buchanan and Fillmore, the candidate of\r\nthe \"Silver Gray\" Whigs, considerably outnumbered the voters for\r\nFremont.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Van Buren voted for the union electoral ticket which represented\r\nin New York the combined opposition to Lincoln. Every motive which had\r\ninfluenced him in 1856 had now increased even more than his years. The\r\nRepublican party was not only now come bringing, it seemed, the torch in\r\nfull flame to light an awful conflagration; but in its second national\r\nconvention there became obvious upon the tariff question the\r\npreponderance of the Whig elements, which made up the larger though not\r\nthe more earnest or efficient body of its supporters.\r\n\r\nAfter Van Buren's return from Europe in 1855, he lived in dignified and\r\ngracious repose. This complete and final escape from the rush about him\r\nhad often seemed in his busy strenuous years full of delight. But\r\ndoubtless now in the peaceful pleasures of Lindenwald and in the\r\noccasional glimpses of the more crowded social life of New York which\r\nwas glad to honor him, there were the regrets and slowly dying\r\nimpatience, the sense of isolation, which must at the best touch with\r\nsome sadness the later and well-earned and even the best-crowned years.\r\nAt this time he began writing memoirs of his life and times, which were\r\nbrought down to the years 1833-1834; but they were never revised by him\r\nand have not been published. Out of this work grew a sketch of the early\r\ngrowth of American parties, which was edited by his sons and printed in\r\n1867. Its pages do not exhibit the firm and logical order which was so\r\ncharacteristic of Van Buren's political compositions. It was rather the\r\nreminiscence of the political philosophy which had completely governed\r\nhim. With some repetitions, but in an easy and interesting way, he\r\nrecalled the far-reaching political differences between Jefferson and\r\nHamilton. In these chapters of his old age are plain the profound and\r\nvaried influences which had been exercised over him by the great founder\r\nof his party, and his unquenchable animosity towards \"the money power\"\r\nfrom the days of the first secretary of the treasury to its victory of\r\n\"buffoonery\" in 1840. In one chapter, with words rather courtly but\r\nstill not to be mistaken, he condemns Buchanan for a violation of the\r\nprinciples of Jefferson and Jackson in accepting the Dred Scott decision\r\nas a rule of political action; and this the more because its main\r\nconclusion was unnecessary to adjudge Dred Scott's rights in that suit,\r\nand because its announcement was part of a political scheme. Chief\r\nJustice Taney and Buchanan, Van Buren pointed out, though raised to\r\npower by the Democratic party, had joined it late in life, \"with\r\nopinions formed and matured in an antagonist school.\" Both had come from\r\nthe Federalist ranks, whose political heresy Van Buren believed to be\r\nhopelessly incurable.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the civil war Van Buren's animosity to Buchanan's\r\nbehavior became more and more marked. He strongly sympathized with the\r\nuprising of the North; and sustained the early measures of Lincoln's\r\nadministration. But he was not to see the dreadful but lasting and\r\nbenign solution of the problem of American slavery. His life ended when\r\nthe fortunes of the nation were at their darkest; when McClellan's seven\r\ndays' battle from the Chickahominy to the James was just over, and the\r\nNorth was waiting in terror lest his troops might not return in time to\r\nsave the capital. For several months he suffered from an asthmatic\r\nattack, which finally became a malignant catarrh, causing him much\r\nanguish. In the latter days of his sickness his mind wandered; but when\r\nsensible and collected he still showed a keen interest in public\r\naffairs, expressed his confidence in President Lincoln and General\r\nMcClellan, and declared his faith that the rebellion would end without\r\nlasting damage to the Union.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1862, he died, nearly eighty years old, in the quiet summer\r\nair at Lindenwald, the noise of battle far away from his green lawns\r\nand clumps of trees. In the ancient Dutch church at Kinderhook the\r\nsimple funeral was performed; and a great rustic gathering paid the last\r\nand best honor of honest and respectful grief to their old friend and\r\nneighbor. For his fame had brought its chief honor to this village of\r\nhis birth, the village to which in happy ending of his earthly career he\r\nreturned, and where through years of well-ordered thrift, of a gentle\r\nand friendly hospitality, and of interesting and not embittered\r\nreminiscence, he had been permitted\r\n\r\n  \"To husband out life's taper at the close,\r\n  And keep the flame from wasting by repose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nVAN BUREN'S CHARACTER AND PLACE IN HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the engraved portrait of Van Buren in old age, prefixed to his\r\n\"History of Parties,\" are plainly to be seen some of his traits,--the\r\nalert outlooking upon men, the bright, easy good-humor, the firm,\r\nself-reliant judgment. Inman's painting, now in the City Hall of New\r\nYork,[20] gives the face in the prime of life,--the same shrewd, kindly\r\nexpression, but more positively touched with that half cynical doubt of\r\nmen which almost inevitably belongs to those in great places. The deep\r\nwrinkles of the old and retired ex-president were hardly yet incipient\r\nin the smooth, prosperous, almost complacent countenance of the\r\ngovernor. In the earlier picture the locks flared outwards from the\r\nface, as they did later; as yet, however, they were dark and a bit\r\ncurling. His form was always slender and erect, but hardly reached the\r\nmiddle height, so that to his political enemies it was endless delight\r\nto call him \"Little Van.\"\r\n\r\nIn the older picture one sees a scrupulous daintiness about the ruffled\r\nshirt and immaculate neckerchief; for Van Buren was fond of the\r\nelegance of life. The Whigs used to declare him an aristocrat, given to\r\nun-American, to positively British splendor. Very certainly he never\r\naffected contempt for the gracious and stately refinement suited to his\r\nlong held place of public honor, that contempt which a silly underrating\r\nof American good sense has occasionally commended to our statesmen. At\r\nLindenwald, among books and guests and rural cares, he led what in the\r\nbest and truest sense was the life of a country gentleman, not set like\r\nan urban exotic among the farmers, but fond of his neighbors as they\r\nwere fond of him, and unaffectedly sharing without loss of distinction\r\nor elegance their thrifty and homely cares. When he retired to this home\r\nhe was able, without undignified or humiliating shifts, to live in ease\r\nand even affluence. For in 1841 his fortune of perhaps $200,000 was a\r\ngenerous one. His last days were not, like those of Jefferson and Monroe\r\nand Jackson, embittered by money anxieties, the penalty of the careless\r\nprofusion the temptation to which, felt even by men wise in the affairs\r\nof others, is often greater than the certain danger and unwisdom of its\r\nindulgence. But no suggestion was breathed against his pecuniary\r\nintegrity, public or private. Nor was there heard of him any story of\r\nwrong or oppression or ungenerous dealing.\r\n\r\nVan Buren's extraordinary command of himself was apparent in his\r\nmanners. They are finely described from intimate acquaintance by\r\nWilliam Allen Butler, the son of Van Buren's long-time friend, in his\r\ncharming and appreciative sketch printed just after Van Buren's death.\r\nThey had, Mr. Butler said, a neatness and polish which served every turn\r\nof domestic, social, and public intercourse. \"As you saw him once, you\r\nsaw him always--always punctilious, always polite, always cheerful,\r\nalways self-possessed. It seemed to anyone who studied this phase of his\r\ncharacter as if, in some early moment of destiny, his whole nature had\r\nbeen bathed in a cool, clear, and unruffled depth, from which it drew\r\nthis life-long serenity and self-control.\" An accomplished English\r\ntraveler, \"the author of 'Cyril Thornton,'\" who saw him while secretary\r\nof state, and before he had been abroad, said that he had more of \"the\r\nmanner of the world\" than any other of the distinguished men at\r\nWashington; that in conversation he was \"full of anecdote and vivacity.\"\r\nChevalier, one of our French critics, in his letters from America\r\ndescribed him as setting up \"for the American Talleyrand.\" John Quincy\r\nAdams, as has been said, sourly mistook all this, and even the especial\r\ncourtesy Van Buren paid him after his political downfall, as mere proof\r\nof insincerity; and he more than once compared Van Buren to Aaron Burr,\r\na comparison of which many Democrats were fond after 1848. In his\r\nbetter-natured moments, however, Adams saw in his adversary a\r\nresemblance to the conciliatory and philosophic Madison. For his\r\n\"extreme caution in avoiding and averting personal collisions,\" he\r\ncalled him another Sosie of Molière's \"Amphitryon,\" \"ami de tout le\r\nmonde.\"\r\n\r\nVan Buren's skill in dealing with men was indeed extraordinary. It\r\ndoubtless came from this temper of amity, and from an inborn genius for\r\nsociety; but it had been wonderfully sharpened in the unrivaled school\r\nof New York's early politics. When he was minister at London, he wrote\r\nthat he was making it his business to be cordial with prominent men on\r\nboth sides; a branch of duty, he said, in which he was not at home,\r\nbecause he had all his life been \"wholly on one side.\" But he was\r\njocosely unjust to himself. He was, for the politics of his day,\r\nabundantly fair to his adversaries. Sometimes indeed he saw too much of\r\nwhat might be said on the other side. Had he seen less, he would\r\nsometimes have been briefer, less indulgent in formal caution. Nor did\r\nhe fail to avoid the unnecessary misery caused to many public men, the\r\nobstacles needlessly raised in their way, by personal disputes, or by\r\nletting into negotiations matters of controversy irrelevant to the thing\r\nto be done. Patience in listening, a steady and singularly acute\r\nobservance of the real end he sought, and a quick, keen reading of men,\r\nsaved him this wearing unhappiness so widespread in public life. Once he\r\nthus criticised his friend Cambreleng: \"There is more in small matters\r\nthan he is always aware of, although he is a really sensible and useful\r\nman.\" In this maxim of lesser things Van Buren was carefully practiced.\r\nDuring the Jackson-Adams campaign, the younger Hamilton was about\r\nsending to some important person an account of the general. Van Buren,\r\nknowing of this, wrote to Hamilton, and, after signing his letter,\r\nadded: \"P. S.--Does the old gentleman have prayers in his own house? If\r\nso, mention it modestly.\"\r\n\r\nHis self-command was not stilted or unduly precise or correct. He was\r\nvery human. A candidate for governor of New York would to-day hardly\r\nwrite to another public man, however friendly to him, as Van Buren in\r\nAugust and September, 1828, wrote to Hamilton. \"Bet on Kentucky,\r\nIndiana, and Illinois,\" he said, \"jointly if you can, or any two of\r\nthem; don't forget to bet all you can.\" But this was the fashion of the\r\nday.[21] His life was entirely free from the charges of dissipation or of\r\nirregular habits, then so commonly, and often truly, made against great\r\nmen. This very correctness was part of the offense he gave his rivals\r\nand their followers. It would hardly be accurate to describe him, even\r\nin younger years, as jovial with his friends; but he was perfectly\r\ncompanionable. Of a social and cheerful temper, he not only liked the\r\ndecorous gaiety of receptions and public entertainment, but was\r\ndelighted and delightful in closer and easier conversation and in the\r\nchat of familiar friends. His reminiscences of men are said to have been\r\nfull of the charm which flows from a strong natural sense of humor, and\r\na correct and vivid memory of human action and character.\r\n\r\nThere are many apocryphal stories of Van Buren's craft or cunning or\r\nselfishness in politics. It is a curious appreciation with which\r\nreputable historians have received such stories from irresponsible or\r\nanonymous sources; for they deserve as little credence as those told of\r\nLincoln's frivolity or indecency. To them all may not only be pleaded\r\nthe absence of any proof deserving respect, but they are refuted by\r\npositive proof, such as from earliest times has been deemed the best\r\nwhich private character can in its own behalf offer to history. In\r\npolitics Van Buren enjoyed as much strong and constant friendship as he\r\nencountered strong and constant hatred. Nothing points more surely to\r\nthe essential soundness of life and the generosity of a public man than\r\nthe near and long-continued friendship of other able, upright, and\r\nhonorably ambitious men. It was an extraordinary measure in which Van\r\nBuren enjoyed friendship of this quality. With all the light upon his\r\ncharacter, Jackson was too shrewd to suffer long from imposition. His\r\nintimacy with Van Buren for twenty years and more was really\r\naffectionate; his admiration for the younger statesman was profound.\r\nThe explanation is both unnecessary and unworthy, which ascribes to\r\nhatred of Clay all Jackson's ardor in the canvass of 1840 or his almost\r\npathetic anxiety for Van Buren's nomination in 1844. Their peculiar and\r\ncontinuous association for six years at Washington had so powerfully\r\nestablished Van Buren in his love and respect, that neither distant\r\nseparation nor disease nor the nearer intrigues and devices of rivals\r\ncould abate them. Those who were especially known as Van Buren men,\r\nthose who not only stood with him in the party but who went with him out\r\nof it, were men of great talents and of the highest character. Butler's\r\ncareer closely accompanied Van Buren's. Both were born at Kinderhook;\r\nthey were together in Hudson, in Albany, in Washington; they were\r\ntogether as Bucktails, as Jacksonian Democrats, as Free-soil men; they\r\nwere close to one another from Butler's boyhood until, more than a\r\nhalf-century later, they were parted by death. To this strong-headed and\r\nsound-hearted statesman, we are told by William Allen Butler, in a fine\r\nand wellnigh sufficient eulogy, that Van Buren was the object of an\r\naffection true and steadfast, faithful through good report and evil\r\nreport, loyal to its own high sense of duty and affection, tender and\r\ngenerous. Benton, liberal and sane a slaveholder though he was, did not\r\napprove the Wilmot Proviso, or join the Free-soil revolt. But in\r\nretirement and old age, reviewing his \"Thirty Years,\" during twenty of\r\nwhich he and Van Buren had, spite of many differences, remained on\r\nclosely intimate terms, he showed a deep liking for the man. Silas\r\nWright, Azariah C. Flagg, and John A. Dix, all strong and famous\r\ncharacters in the public life of New York, were among the others of\r\nthose steadily faithful in loyal and unwavering regard for this\r\npolitical and personal chief. Nor were they deceived. Jackson and\r\nButler, Wright and Flagg and Dix, sturdy, upright, skillful, experienced\r\nmen of affairs, were not held in true and lifelong friendship and\r\nadmiration by the insinuating manners, the clever management, the\r\nselfish and timid aims, which make the Machiavellian caricature of Van\r\nBuren so often drawn. No American in public life has shown firmer and\r\nlonger devotion to his friends. His reputation for statesmanship must\r\ndoubtless rest upon the indisputable facts of his career. But for his\r\nintegrity of life, for his sincerity, for his fidelity to those\r\nobligations of political, party, and personal friendship, within which\r\nlies so much of the usefulness as well as of the singular charm of\r\npublic life, his relations with these men make a proof not to be\r\nquestioned, and surely not to be weakened by the malicious or anonymous\r\nstories of political warfare.\r\n\r\nFor the absurdly sinister touch which his political enemies gave to his\r\ncharacter, it is difficult now to find any just reason. It may be that\r\nthe cool and imperturbable appearance of good-nature, with which he\r\nreceived the savage and malevolent attacks so continually made upon\r\nhim, to many seemed so impossible to be real as to be sheer\r\nhypocrisy;[22] and from the fancy of such hypocrisy it was easy for the\r\nimagination to infer all the arts and characteristics of deceit.\r\nDoubtless the caution of Van Buren's political papers irritated\r\nimpatient and angry opponents. They found them full of elaborate and\r\nsubtle reservations, as they fancied, against future political\r\ncontingencies; a charge, it ought to be remembered, which is continually\r\nmade against the ripest, bravest, and greatest character in English\r\npolitics of to-day or of the century.[23] Van Buren's reasoning was\r\nperfectly clear, and his style highly finished. But he had not the sort\r\nof genius which in a few phrases states and lights up a political\r\nproblem. The complexity of human affairs, the danger of short and\r\nsweeping assertions, pressed upon him as he wrote; and the amplitude of\r\nhis arguments, sometimes tending to prolixity, seemed timid and\r\nlawyer-like to those who disliked his conclusions.\r\n\r\nVan Buren was not, however, an unpopular man, except as toward the last\r\nhis politics were unpopular as politics out of sympathy with those of\r\neither of the great parties, and except also at the South, where he was\r\nsoon suspected and afterwards hated as an anti-slavery man. He was on\r\nthe whole a strong candidate at the polls. In his own State and at the\r\nNortheast his strength with the people grew more and more until his\r\ndefeat by the slaveholders in 1844. Perhaps the most striking proof of\r\nthis strength was the canvass of 1848, when in New York he was able to\r\ntake fully half of his party with him into irregular opposition, a feat\r\nwith hardly a precedent in our political history. And there was complete\r\nreciprocity. Van Buren was profoundly democratic in his convictions. He\r\nthoroughly, honestly, and without demagogy believed in the common people\r\nand in their competence to deal wisely with political difficulties. Even\r\nwhen his faith was tried by what he deemed the mistakes of popular\r\nelections, he still trusted to what in a famous phrase of his he called\r\n\"the sober second thought of the people.\"[24]\r\n\r\nHowever widely the student of history may differ from the politics of\r\nVan Buren's associates, the politics of Benton, Wright, Butler, and Dix,\r\nand in a later rank of his New York disciples, of Samuel J. Tilden and\r\nSanford E. Church, it is impossible not to see that their political\r\npurpose was at the least as long and steady as their friendship for Van\r\nBuren. Love for the Union, a belief in a simple, economical, and even\r\nunheroic government, a jealousy of taking money from the people, and a\r\nscrupulous restriction upon the use of public moneys for any but public\r\npurposes, a strict limitation of federal powers, a dislike of slavery\r\nand an opposition to its extension,--these made up one of the great and\r\nfruitful political creeds of America, a creed which had ardent and\r\nhopeful apostles a half century ago, and which, save in the articles\r\nwhich touched slavery and are now happily obsolete, will doubtless find\r\napostles no less ardent and hopeful a half century hence. Each of its\r\nassertions has been found in other creeds; but the entire creed with all\r\nits articles made the peculiar and powerful faith only of the Van Buren\r\nmen. As history gradually sets reputations aright, the leader of these\r\nmen must justly wear the laurel of a statesman who, apart from his\r\npersonal and party relations and ambitions, has stood clearly for a\r\npowerful and largely triumphant cause.\r\n\r\nNo vague, no thoughtless rush of popular sentiment touched or shook this\r\nfaith of Van Buren. Had there been indeed a readier emphasis about him,\r\na heartier and quicker sympathy with the temper of the day, he would\r\nperhaps have aroused a popular enthusiasm, he might perhaps have been\r\nthe hero which in fact he never was. But his intellectual perceptions\r\ndid not permit the subtle self-deceit, the enthusiastic surrender to\r\ncurrent sentiment, to which the striking figures that delight the masses\r\nof men are so apt to yield. Van Buren was steadfast from the beginning\r\nto the end, save when the war threats of slavery alarmed his old age and\r\nthe sober second thought of a really patient and resolute people seemed\r\na long time coming. Two years before his death Jefferson wrote to Van\r\nBuren an elaborate sketch of his relations with Hamilton and of our\r\nfirst party division. Two years before his own death Van Buren was\r\nfinishing a history of the same political division written upon the\r\ntheory and in the tone running through Jefferson's writings. It was\r\ncomposed by Van Buren in the very same temper in which he had\r\nrespectfully read the weighty epistle from the great apostle of\r\nDemocracy. Between the ending life at Monticello and that at Lindenwald,\r\nthe political faith of the older man had been steadily followed by the\r\nyounger.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the \"spoils\" system, and the late coming, but steadily\r\nincreasing perception of its corruptions and dangers, have seriously and\r\njustly dimmed Van Buren's fame. But history should be not less indulgent\r\nto him than to other great Americans. The practical politics which he\r\nfirst knew had been saturated with the abuse. He did no more than adopt\r\naccustomed means of political warfare. Neither he nor other men of his\r\ntime perceived the kind of evil which political proscription of men in\r\nunpolitical places must yield. They saw the undoubted rightfulness of\r\nshattering the ancient idea that in offices there was a property right.\r\nThey saw but too clearly the apparent help which the powerful love of\r\nholding office brings to any political cause, and which has been used by\r\nevery great minister of state the world over. Van Buren had, however, no\r\nlove of patronage in itself. The use of a party as a mere agency to\r\ndistribute offices would have seemed to him contemptible. In neither of\r\nthe great executive places which he held, as governor, secretary of\r\nstate, or president, did he put into an extreme practice the\r\nproscriptive rules which were far more rigorously adopted about him. To\r\nhis personal temper not less than to his conceptions of public duty the\r\ninevitable meanness and wrong of the system were distasteful.\r\n\r\nChief among the elements of Van Buren's public character ought to be\r\nranked his moral courage and the explicitness of his political\r\nutterances,--the two qualities which, curiously enough, were most\r\nangrily denied him by his enemies. His well-known Shocco Springs letter\r\nof 1832 on the tariff was indeed lacking in these qualities; but he was\r\nthen not chiefly interested. There was only a secondary responsibility\r\nupon him. But it is not too much to say that no American in responsible\r\nand public station, since the days when Washington returned from his\r\nwalk among the miserable huts at Valley Forge to write to the\r\nContinental Congress, or to face the petty imbecilities of the jealous\r\ncolonists, has shown so complete a political courage as that with which\r\nVan Buren faced the crisis of 1837, or in which he wrote his famous\r\nTexas letter. Nor did any American, stirred with ambition, conscious of\r\ngreat powers, as was this captain of politicians, and bringing all his\r\npolitical fortunes, as he must do, to the risks of universal suffrage,\r\never meet living issues dangerously dividing men ready to vote for him\r\nif he would but remain quiet, with clearer or more decided answers than\r\ndid Van Buren in his Sherrod Williams letter of 1836 and in most of his\r\nchief public utterances from that year until 1844. The courtesies of his\r\nmanner, his failure in trenchant brevity, and even the almost complete\r\nabsence of invective or extravagance from his papers or speeches, have\r\nobscured these capital virtues of his character. He saw too many\r\ndangers; and he sometimes made it too clear that he saw them. But upon\r\nlegitimate issues he was among the least timid and the most explicit of\r\ngreat Americans. No president of ours has in office been more courageous\r\nor more direct.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps an interesting, it is at least a harmless speculation, to\r\nlook for Van Buren's place of honor in the varied succession of men who\r\nhave reached the first office, though not always the first place, in\r\nAmerican public life. Every student will be powerfully, even when\r\nunconsciously, influenced in this judgment by the measure of strength or\r\nbeneficence he accords to different political tendencies. With this\r\nwarning the present writer will, however, venture upon an opinion.\r\n\r\nVan Buren very clearly does not belong among the mediocrities or\r\naccidents of the White House,--among Monroe, Harrison, Tyler, Polk,\r\nTaylor, Fillmore, and Pierce, not to meddle with the years since the\r\ncivil war whose party disputes are still part of contemporary politics.\r\nVan Buren reached the presidency by political abilities and public\r\nservices of the first order, as the most distinguished active member of\r\nhis party, and with a universal popular recognition for years before his\r\npromotion that he was among the three or four Americans from whom a\r\npresident would be naturally chosen. Buchanan's experience in public\r\nlife was perhaps as great as Van Buren's, and his political skill and\r\ndistinction made his accession to the presidency by no means unworthy.\r\nBut he never led, he never stood for a cause; he never led men; he was\r\nnever chief in his party; and in his great office he sank with timidity\r\nbefore the slaveholding aggressors, as they strove with vengeance to\r\nsuppress freedom in Kansas, and before the menaces and open plunderings\r\nof disunion. Van Buren showed no such timidity in a place of equal\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nJackson stands in a rank by himself. He had a stronger and more vivid\r\npersonality than Van Buren. But useful as he was to the creation of a\r\npowerful sentiment for union and of a hostility to the schemes of a\r\npaternal government, it is clear that in those qualities of steady\r\nwisdom, foresight, patience, which of right belong to the chief\r\nmagistracy of a republic, he was far inferior to his less picturesque\r\nand less forceful successor. The first Adams, a man of very superior\r\nparts, competent and singularly patriotic, was deep in too many personal\r\ncollisions within and without his party, and his presidency incurred too\r\ncomplete and lasting, and it must be added, too just a popular\r\ncondemnation, to permit it high rank, though very certainly he belonged\r\namong neither the mediocrities nor the accidents of the White House.\r\n\r\nIf to the highest rank of American presidents be assigned Washington,\r\nand if after him in it come Jefferson and perhaps Lincoln (though more\r\nthan a quarter of a century must go to make the enduring measure of his\r\nfame), the second rank would seem to include Madison, the younger Adams,\r\nand Van Buren. Between the first and the last of these, the second of\r\nthem, as has been said, saw much resemblance. But if Madison had a\r\nmellower mind, more obedient to the exigencies of the time and of a\r\nwider scholarship, Van Buren had a firmer and more direct courage, a\r\nsteadier loyalty to his political creed, and far greater resolution and\r\nefficiency in the performance of executive duties. If one were to\r\nimitate Plutarch in behalf of John Quincy Adams and Van Buren, he would\r\nneed largely to compare their rival political creeds. But leaving these,\r\nit will not be unjust to say that in virile and indomitable continuance\r\nof moral purpose after official power had let go its trammels, and when\r\nthe harassments and feebleness of age were inexorable, and though the\r\nheavens were to fall, the younger Adams was the greater; that in\r\nexecutive success they were closely together in a high rank; but that in\r\nskill and power of political leadership, in breadth of political\r\npurpose, in freedom from political vagaries, in personal generosity and\r\npolitical loyalty, Van Buren was easily the greater man.\r\n\r\nVan Buren did not have the massive and forcible eloquence of Webster, or\r\nthe more captivating though fleeting speech of Clay, or the delightful\r\nwarmth of the latter's leadership, or the strength and glory which their\r\nvery persons and careers gave to American nationality. But in the\r\npersistent and fruitful adherence to a political creed fitted to the\r\ntime and to the genius of the American people, in that noble art which\r\ngathers and binds to one another and to a creed the elements of a\r\npolitical party, the art which disciplines and guides the party, when\r\nformed, to clear and definite purposes, without wavering and without\r\nweakness or demagogy, Van Buren was a greater master than either of\r\nthose men, in many things more interesting as they were. In this exalted\r\nart of the politician, this consummate art of the statesman, Van Buren\r\nwas close to the greatest of American party leaders, close to Jefferson\r\nand to Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIn his very last years the stir and rumbling of war left Van Buren in\r\nquiet recollection and anxious loyalty at Lindenwald. As his growing\r\nillness now and then spared him moments of ease, his mind must\r\nsometimes have turned back to the steps of his career, senator of his\r\nState, senator of the United States, governor, first cabinet minister,\r\nforeign envoy, vice-president, and president. There must again have\r\nsounded in his ears the hardly remembered jargon of Lewisites and\r\nBurrites, Clintonians and Livingstonians, Republicans and Federalists,\r\nBucktails and Jacksonians and National Republicans, Democrats and Whigs,\r\nLoco-focos and Conservatives, Barnburners and Hunkers. There must\r\nrapidly though dimly have shifted before him the long series of his\r\nstruggles,--struggles over the second war with England, over internal\r\nimprovements, the Bank, nullification, the divorce of bank and state,\r\nthe resistance to slavery extension. Through them all there had run, and\r\nthis at least his memory clearly recalled, the one strong faith of his\r\npolitics and statesmanship. In all his labors of office, in all his\r\nmultifarious strifes, he never faltered in upholding the Union. But not\r\nless firmly would this true disciple of Jefferson restrain the\r\nactivities of the federal government. Whatever wisdom, whatever\r\nintegrity of purpose might belong to ministers and legislators at\r\nWashington,--though the strength of the United States might be theirs,\r\nand though they were panoplied in the august prestige rightly ascribed\r\nby American patriotism to that sovereign title of our nation,--still Van\r\nBuren was resolute that they should not do for the people what the\r\nStates or the people themselves could do as well. To his eyes there was\r\nclear and undimmed from the beginning to the close of his career, the\r\nidea of government as an instrument of useful public service, rather\r\nthan an object of superstitious veneration, the idea but two years after\r\nhis death clothed with memorable words by a master in brief speech, the\r\ndemocratic idea of a \"government of the people, by the people, for the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"I shall not, whilst I have the honor to administer the government,\r\nbring a man into any office of consequence, knowingly, whose political\r\ntenets are adverse to the measures which the general government are\r\npursuing; for this, in my opinion, would be a sort of political\r\nsuicide.\"--Washington to Pickering, secretary of war, September 27,\r\n1795. Vol. 11 of Sparks's edition of _Washington's Writings_, 74.\r\n\r\n[2] I use the political name then in vogue. The greater part of the\r\nRepublicans have, since the rearrangement of parties in John Quincy\r\nAdams's time, or rather since Jackson's time, been known as Democrats.\r\n\r\n[3] The more conspicuous difficulty in 1801 arose from the voting by\r\neach elector for two candidates without distinguishing which he\r\npreferred for president and which for vice-president. But the\r\nawkwardness and not improbable injustice of a choice by the House was\r\nalso well illustrated in February, 1801.\r\n\r\n[4] Gales and Seaton's Debates in Congress give here the word \"act\"\r\ninstead of \"think,\"--but erroneously, I assume.\r\n\r\n[5] The comparison cannot of course be complete, as some who were\r\nsenators in 1826 were not senators in 1828.\r\n\r\n[6] This and several other references of mine to Gladstone were written\r\nten years and more before his death. These years of his brief but\r\nextraordinary Home Rule victory, of his final defeat,--for Lord\r\nRosebery's defeat was Gladstone's defeat,--and of his retirement, have\r\nnot only added a mellow and almost sacred splendor to his noble career,\r\nbut have still better demonstrated his superb political gifts. What\r\npolitician indeed, dead or living, is to be ranked above him?\r\n\r\n[7] This was written nine years before the lamentable surrender of the\r\norganization of Van Buren's party at Chicago in 1896. It is safe to say\r\nthat these traditions, even if fallen sadly out of sight, still make a\r\ndeep and powerful force, which must in due time assert itself.\r\n\r\n[8] After the Dissenting Liberals had acted with the Conservatives, not\r\nonly in the first Home Rule campaign in 1886, but during the Salisbury\r\nadministration from 1886 to 1892, and in the campaigns of 1892 and 1895,\r\nthe coalition was ended and a new and single party formed, of which the\r\nDuke of Devonshire and Mr. Chamberlain were leaders as really as Lord\r\nSalisbury or Mr. Balfour. The accession of the former to the Unionist\r\nministry of 1895 was in no sense a reward for bringing over some of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[9] This was written in 1887. The Albany Regency, after a life of sixty\r\nyears, ended with the death of Daniel Manning, in Mr. Cleveland's first\r\npresidency, and with it ended the characteristic influence of its organ.\r\nThe Democratic management at Albany has since proceeded upon very\r\ndifferent lines and has engaged the ability of very different men.\r\n\r\n[10] A month or two after his arrival Van Buren wrote Hamilton that his\r\nplace was decidedly the most agreeable he had ever held, but added:\r\n\"Money--money is the thing.\" His house was splendid and in a delightful\r\nsituation; but it cost him £500. His carriage cost him £310, and his\r\nservants with their board $2,600.\r\n\r\n[11] In estimating the popular vote in 1828, Delaware and South Carolina\r\nare excluded, their electors having been chosen by the legislature. In\r\nGeorgia in that year there was no opposition to Jackson. In 1832 no\r\npopular vote is included for South Carolina or for Alabama. In\r\nMississippi and Missouri there was no opposition to Jackson. In 1829,\r\nupon Van Buren's recommendation when governor, the system in New York of\r\nchoosing electors by districts, which had been in force in the election\r\nof 1838, was abolished; and there was adopted the present system of\r\nchoosing all the electors by the popular vote of the whole State.\r\n\r\n[12] The Treasurer's statement for August, 1837, gave eighty-four\r\ndeposit banks. But of these, nine had less than $5000 each on deposit,\r\nsix from $5000 to $10,000, and eight from $10,000 to $20,000. Fourteen\r\nhad from $50,000 to $100,000 each. Only twenty-nine had more than\r\n$100,000 each. It is not unfair to speak of the deposits as being\r\nsubstantially in fifty banks.\r\n\r\nThe enormous land sales at the Southwest had placed a most\r\ndisproportionate amount of money in banks in that part of the country.\r\nJohn Quincy Adams seemed, but with little reason, to consider this an\r\nintentional discrimination against the North. It is quite probable that,\r\nif the deposits had been in one national bank, the peculiarly excessive\r\nstrain at that point would have been modified. But this was no great\r\nfactor in the crisis.\r\n\r\n[13] I cannot refrain from noticing here the curious fact that Dr. Von\r\nHolst, after a contemptuous picture of Van Buren as a mere verbose,\r\ncoarse-grained politician given to scheming and duplicity, was not\r\nsurprised at his meeting in so lofty a spirit this really great trial.\r\nFor surely here, if anywhere, the essential fibre of the man would be\r\ndiscovered. I must also express my regret that this writer, to whom\r\nAmericans owe very much, should have been content (although in this he\r\nhas but joined some other historians of American politics) to accept\r\nmere campaign or partisan rumors which when directed against other men,\r\nhave gone unnoticed, but against Van Buren have become the basis for\r\nemphatic disparagement and contumely. Even Mackenzie, the publisher of\r\nthe purloined letters, writing his pamphlet with the most obvious and\r\nreckless venom, is quoted by this learned historian as respectable\r\nauthority. Van Buren had refused during nearly a year to pardon\r\nMackenzie from prison for his unlawful use of American territory to\r\nprepare armed raids on Canada. Sir Francis B. Head's opinion was\r\ndoubtless somewhat colored; but he was not entirely without\r\njustification in applying to Mackenzie the words: \"He lies out of every\r\npore in his skin. Whether he be sleeping or waking, on foot or on\r\nhorseback, together with his neighbors or writing for a newspaper, a\r\nmultitudinous swarm of lies, visible, palpable, and tangible, are\r\nbuzzing and settling about him like flies around a horse in August.\"\r\n(Narrative of Sir F. B. Head, London, 1839.)\r\n\r\n[14] The reference was to commercial paper and not to bank-notes. But\r\nboth had been active characteristics of American speculation.\r\n\r\n[15] The depositories now authorized for the proceeds of the internal\r\nrevenue secured the government by a deposit of the bonds of the latter,\r\nwhich the depositories must of course purchase and own. (_U. S. Rev.\r\nStats._ § 5153.)\r\n\r\n[16] I cannot refrain in this revised edition to note that England,\r\nalthough not always a ready scholar, has in later years learned a\r\nfarseeing wisdom which in colonial administration makes her the teacher\r\nof the world. The modern policy of deference to local sentiment and of\r\nfinding her own advantage in the independent prosperity of the colony,\r\nhas bound continents, islands, races, religions, to the English empire,\r\nand brought from them wealth to England, as the old rule of force never\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n[17] It should be remembered that several great expenses of the White\r\nHouse were then and are now met by special and additional\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\n[18] I must again complain of the curious though unintended unfairness\r\nof Professor Von Holst (_Const. Hist. of the U. S._ 1828-1846, Chicago,\r\n1879, p. 663). He treats this letter with great contempt. He assumes\r\nindeed that Van Buren's declaration for annexation would have given him\r\nthe nomination; and admits that Van Buren declared himself \"decidedly\r\nopposed to annexation.\" After this sufficient proof of courage, for Van\r\nBuren could at least have simply promised to adopt the vote of Congress\r\non the main question, it was not very sensible to declare \"disgusting\"\r\nVan Buren's efforts \"to creep through the thorny hedge which shut him\r\noff from the party nomination.\" Professor Von Holst's \"disgust\" seems\r\nparticularly directed against the passage here annotated where, after\r\nhis strong argument against annexation, he declared that he would not be\r\ninfluenced by sectional feeling, and would obey the wishes of a Congress\r\nchosen with reference to the question. Few, I think, will consider this\r\npromise with reference to such a question, either cowardly or\r\n\"disgusting,\" made, as it was, by a candidate for the presidency, of a\r\ndemocratic republic, after clearly and firmly declaring his own views in\r\nadvance of the congressional elections.\r\n\r\n[19] James G. Blaine's _Twenty Years_, vol. i. pp. 269, 272.\r\n\r\n[20] An engraving of this portrait accompanies Holland's biography,\r\nwritten for the campaign of 1836.\r\n\r\n[21] The mania for election betting among public men was very curious.\r\nIn the letters and memoranda printed by Mackenzie, the bets of John Van\r\nBuren and Jesse Hoyt are given in detail. They ranged from $5000 to $50;\r\nfrom \"three cases of champagne\" or \"two bales of cotton,\" to \"boots,\r\n$7,\" or \"a ham, $3.\" They were made with the younger Alexander Hamilton,\r\nJames Watson Webb, Moses H. Grinnell, John A. King, George F. Talman,\r\nDudley Selden, and other notable men of the time.\r\n\r\n[22] One of the latest and most important historians of the time, after\r\nsaying that \"nothing ruffled\" Van Buren, is contented with a different\r\nexplanation from mine. Professor Sumner says that \"he was thick-skinned,\r\nelastic, and tough; he did not win confidence from anybody.\" But within\r\nanother sentence or two the historian adds, as if effect did not always\r\nneed adequate cause, that \"as president he showed the honorable desire\r\nto have a statesmanlike and high-toned administration.\" (Sumner's\r\n_Jackson_, p. 451.)\r\n\r\n[23] Here again I spoke of Gladstone, to whom, as this revised edition\r\nis going to press, the civilized world is bringing, in his death, a\r\nnoble and fitting tribute.\r\n\r\n[24] This expression was not original with Van Buren, as has been\r\nsupposed. It was used by Fisher Ames in 1788; and Bartlett's\r\n_Quotations_ also gives a still earlier use of part of it by Matthew\r\nHenry in 1710.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abolitionists, their
