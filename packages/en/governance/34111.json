This campaign was something novel in the South, for until then,\r\nthere had not been, for years, any probability of defeat to the\r\norganized Democracy in Alabama.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the Kolb-Jones political fight, astute \"organized\"\r\nDemocratic leaders soon expressed such grave apprehensions of the\r\nsuccess of their ticket that, only a few weeks before the time had come\r\nfor the state election (Aug. 1, 1892), Alabama was in the throes of such\r\npolitical excitement as had probably never before been known in the\r\nhistory of that commonwealth. This fervor increased up to the day of\r\nelection, when, as is known to the entire country, Capt. R. F. Kolb\r\nswept the state with cyclonic victory, notwithstanding the fact that he\r\nwas defrauded by the manipulations of the ballot-box stuffers,\r\nunscrupulous returning-officers and unprincipled members of\r\ncanvassing-boards. Another man is to-day occupying the seat to which\r\nCaptain Kolb is entitled, with the absolute acquaintance of the\r\ncertainty of this statement, and with the perfect knowledge that a vast\r\nmajority of the people of Alabama are fully aware that, inasmuch as he\r\nhas assumed it wrongfully, he is unworthy of the trust. What a shameful\r\nand revolting spectacle!\r\n\r\nPresident Hayes was never more despised by the people of Alabama, than\r\nis Governor Jones by the common people of his own state.\r\n\r\nNo better or more interesting recital could be given of the rightful\r\nclaims of Captain Kolb, than is made in his open letter, written\r\nDecember 15, 1892, and addressed to the General Assembly and people of\r\nAlabama. In this letter Captain Kolb makes a demand for justice, gives\r\nwell-known facts that are susceptible of proof, makes statements of\r\nparticular frauds, and asks why an investigation of the matter is not\r\npermitted and the people allowed to choose their own public servants.\r\nThe letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF ALABAMA, AND THE PEOPLE\r\n     OF ALABAMA:\r\n\r\n     \"As I have so far been denied the official rights conferred upon me\r\n     by a sovereign people, I deem it my duty to address this open\r\n     letter to the members of the Legislature and people of Alabama, and\r\n     respectfully ask for an impartial hearing. 'Let justice be done,\r\n     though the heavens fall.' On the 1st of December, 1892, a\r\n     conscienceless and corrupt oligarchy overturned the republican form\r\n     of government in Alabama, and installed as the _de facto_ governor,\r\n     a man who was not elected to the office. I feel that I am airing no\r\n     mere private or personal grievance in thus protesting against and\r\n     denouncing this great crime against law, order and civil liberty. I\r\n     would be an unfaithful steward and unworthy of the sacred trust\r\n     confided to me by the people of Alabama at the polls in August\r\n     last, if I remained silent under the circumstances. Two years ago\r\n     the Democratic party, in convention assembled, refused to nominate\r\n     for governor the acknowledged choice of a majority of the party.\r\n     For the sake of harmony, I bided my time for another two years,\r\n     believing that the people would then rise in their majesty and\r\n     throw off the tyrannous yoke of party bosses. On the 8th of June\r\n     last, the Democratic party again assembled in state convention, to\r\n     nominate candidates for governor and other state officers, and for\r\n     a second time, the rights and wishes of the people were over-ridden\r\n     by fraud and the unfair use of party machinery in the election of\r\n     delegates thereto. My friends did everything in their power to\r\n     bring about a fair and honorable settlement of all differences\r\n     existing between the two factions of the Democratic party in the\r\n     state. All overtures in this direction were treated with scorn and\r\n     derision by the so-called 'organized' Democracy, and we were forced\r\n     to organize our own state convention, which was composed\r\n     exclusively of life-long Democrats. This convention nominated a\r\n     full state ticket and appealed to the justice-loving hearts of the\r\n     true, sovereign people of Alabama, for their verdict on the first\r\n     Monday in August. The issues between the two factions of the party\r\n     were fully presented by both sides of the controversy, in the most\r\n     memorable campaign ever known in the political history of the\r\n     state. On the first Monday in August, the people spoke at the\r\n     ballot-box in thunder tones and declared that the ticket headed by\r\n     myself for governor, received a majority of over 45,000 of the\r\n     votes cast, fully 25,000 of that majority being white voters. By\r\n     frauds and manipulations on the part of election managers and\r\n     county returning-boards in many counties of the state, this true\r\n     majority of 45,000 for myself for governor, was changed into a\r\n     fictitious majority of about 11,000 for Thomas G. Jones. This state\r\n     of facts was admitted to be true for weeks after the election by\r\n     prominent supporters of Governor Jones throughout the state, who\r\n     did not hesitate to say that the Legislature, when it convened,\r\n     would provide for a prompt and impartial investigation of the\r\n     frauds alleged to have been committed, and would declare who was\r\n     rightfully entitled to the office of governor. Governor Jones\r\n     himself is on record as having used the following language on the\r\n     subject, in an interview with Mr. Chappel Cory, editor of the\r\n     Birmingham _Age-Herald_, on August 21, 1892:\r\n\r\n     \"'If I am not fairly elected I do not want the office. I intend to\r\n     renew my recommendation, made in February, 1891, to the ensuing\r\n     General Assembly, to pass laws to provide for contests before the\r\n     General Assembly, for governor and the other state offices. There\r\n     can be no doubt that such a law will be passed. You may say further\r\n     that if the limited session allowed by the constitution will not\r\n     give sufficient time to hear and decide such contests as may be\r\n     brought, that I will not hesitate to convene the General Assembly\r\n     in extraordinary session for the purpose. I have neither reason nor\r\n     motive to use the power of the office of governor to hinder or\r\n     embarrass investigation; but, were it otherwise, consecration to\r\n     this great trust would leave me no room for doubt as to the pathway\r\n     of duty and honor, when the happiness and contentment of the people\r\n     lay in the balance against partisan success or personal triumph.'\r\n     Commenting on this interview with Governor Jones, the _Age-Herald_\r\n     said editorially: 'There is now no reason why every honest man\r\n     should not adjourn the discussion of the gubernatorial issue until\r\n     the meeting of the General Assembly. Certainly no honest-minded\r\n     Democrat, however bitterly he may have fought for Captain Kolb, can\r\n     find an excuse for keeping alive the fires of factional strife. The\r\n     statement by Governor Jones, which we publish this morning, leaves\r\n     nothing more to be said until the trial shall come up according to\r\n     the law and the constitution. No settlement of a contest is\r\n     possible except by the General Assembly, and the Governor says in\r\n     plain terms it shall be settled and rightly settled. He goes so far\r\n     as to say that if the constitutional limit of fifty days shall not\r\n     give time for the determination of all contests, he will convene\r\n     the General Assembly in extraordinary session for that purpose.'\r\n     Thus, it is plainly apparent, that Governor Jones and his friends\r\n     are pledged to provide for and abide by a legislative investigation\r\n     and adjudication of the contest. Can Governor Jones and his friends\r\n     afford not to keep their pledges? Will Governor Jones follow 'the\r\n     pathway of duty and honor,' or will he sacrifice both upon the\r\n     altar of 'partisan success and personal triumph?' On the occasion\r\n     of his inauguration as the _de facto_ Governor of Alabama, December\r\n     1, 1892, in making an urgent appeal to the Legislature to largely\r\n     increase the present rate of taxation, Governor Jones declared that\r\n     'the Democratic party can dare to do right.' If he deemed it the\r\n     duty of a Democratic legislature to increase the burdens of an\r\n     already taxridden people, surely he can afford to recommend to this\r\n     same Legislature the necessity of investigating alleged election\r\n     frauds, which impugn the integrity of his title to the office of\r\n     governor, and especially, when these frauds are not denied by his\r\n     supporters or the press friendly to him. In other words, will\r\n     Governor Jones 'dare to do right,' in this grave matter, affecting,\r\n     as it does, the rights of the majority of the sovereign people of\r\n     this commonwealth and the perpetuity of a republican form of\r\n     government in Alabama. Will the Legislature, now assembled on\r\n     Capitol Hill, knowing as they do, that all honest and fair-minded\r\n     men among their constituents demand an investigation, 'dare to do\r\n     right,' and enact a law which will insure that justice shall be\r\n     done and a stigma removed, which will otherwise be a stain upon\r\n     Alabama's fair escutcheon forever? I believe the Legislature will\r\n     rise above paltry partisan feeling, and that after becoming\r\n     convinced of the wishes of their people during the Christmas\r\n     recess, will return to the Capitol and effect a just and speedy\r\n     settlement of this vital question. It has been charged that I have\r\n     deserted the Democratic party. I repudiate the base calumny with\r\n     the scorn of conscious innocence. The Democratic party has always\r\n     been and always will be the party of the people, and the so-called\r\n     'organized' Democratic party of Alabama has simply deserted and\r\n     outraged the people. I am now, as I have ever been, true and\r\n     faithful to the principles of Jeffersonian Democracy. I believe in\r\n     and shall ever contend for 'a government of the people, for the\r\n     people and by the people.' There are men high in the councils of\r\n     the so-called 'organized' Democracy, who while admitting my\r\n     election, declare that because I supported the electoral ticket\r\n     nominated by the Lakeview convention, I should be denied even an\r\n     opportunity to contest before the Legislature for the office to\r\n     which I have been elected; and some go so far as to say that, had I\r\n     not given such support, I would have been legally seated in the\r\n     gubernatorial chair of Alabama, on the 1st of December, 1892. No\r\n     sensible, or honest person will contend that my support of the\r\n     Lakeview electoral ticket can affect the merits of my cause of\r\n     contest or change the facts of the previous August election. For\r\n     that support, I have no apologies to make; for I followed the\r\n     dictates of right and conscience. And besides, I could not\r\n     consistently support the electoral ticket nominated by the\r\n     convention of party bosses at the State-house, because such support\r\n     would have been on my part an indirect indorsement of the frauds\r\n     which I honestly believe were committed against me by these same\r\n     party bosses and their henchmen, in the August election. For taking\r\n     the position I did, it is proclaimed by my enemies that I am\r\n     'politically dead in Alabama.' In reply to this, I would say that,\r\n     when they undertake to lay me away in my political coffin, they\r\n     will find that no amount of abuse and vilification will prevent my\r\n     speedy and triumphant resurrection through the sovereign might of\r\n     an outraged people. The political bosses are hereby notified that\r\n     in the future, as in the past, I will ever be found battling for\r\n     true Jeffersonian Democracy and the rights of the masses. In the\r\n     meantime, thanks to a merciful Providence, being in fine health and\r\n     feeling confident of the continued sympathy and support of my\r\n     fellow citizens, I propose to fight now and fight ever until the\r\n     banner of right and reform is planted on the dismantled fortress of\r\n     fraud and usurpation.\r\n\r\n     \"For the information of the members of the General Assembly, I\r\n     desire to give some of the facts in detail, showing the truth of\r\n     the charge that the state ticket headed by myself for governor was\r\n     fraudulently counted out, in August last. My information in regard\r\n     to these frauds is of the most authentic character, and I will be\r\n     able to sustain, by convincing proof, every charge alleged. These\r\n     election frauds, to which I call attention, will be startling\r\n     intelligence to the people in the 'white' counties of the state,\r\n     who at present have no adequate conception of their extent and\r\n     enormity. Let us first examine Governor Jones' own home county of\r\n     Montgomery. Every well-informed person in Montgomery county knows\r\n     and admits that the majority of 6,250 returned for Governor Jones,\r\n     was a sham and a fraud. The same old methods were resorted to, that\r\n     have been practised for years. The boast, openly made before the\r\n     election, that our ticket would be 'counted out,' was carried out\r\n     to the letter. It is a known fact and publicly stated, that not\r\n     over 4,000 votes, all told, were actually cast in the August\r\n     election in Montgomery county, and that an honest count of this\r\n     vote would give me not less than 1,500 majority. The return of\r\n     3,561 votes, claimed to have been cast in the two beats of the city\r\n     of Montgomery, every honest citizen knows to be untrue. I charge\r\n     that there were not 1,000 votes actually cast in the two city\r\n     beats, and all over that number counted were uncast ballots. The\r\n     same is true as to the returns from nearly, if not all, the 'black'\r\n     beats of the county. Tickets for the Jones faction were substituted\r\n     for those cast for the Kolb faction, and a large number of uncast\r\n     ballots were counted for Governor Jones and his faction that were\r\n     never voted at all. Uncast ballots were placed in the ballot-boxes\r\n     and counted for Governor Jones purporting to have been cast by men,\r\n     both white and colored, long since dead, and others by men who have\r\n     not lived in the county for years. The poll lists on file in the\r\n     office of the judge of probate, were either destroyed or stolen, to\r\n     prevent copies being furnished, which would show these facts to\r\n     exist. The vote of Montgomery county alone, honestly counted and\r\n     returned as the votes were cast, would show a difference in my\r\n     favor of not less than 7,700 votes. In other words, I carried the\r\n     county by about 1,500 majority, instead of Governor Jones by over\r\n     6,200 as the fraudulent returns show. The same state of facts\r\n     exists as to Lowndes county--over 1,600 majority was returned for\r\n     Governor Jones when, in fact, I carried the county by over 2,000\r\n     majority. In many of the 'black' beats hundreds of ballots cast for\r\n     the Kolb faction were changed for those of the Jones faction, and\r\n     hundreds more of uncast ballots placed in the ballot-boxes and\r\n     counted for Governor Jones, that were never voted at all by anyone.\r\n     The names of hundreds of dead men appear on the poll lists and\r\n     ballots put in for them and counted for Governor Jones. When a copy\r\n     of the poll lists was demanded of the judge of probate, which I\r\n     charge would show these facts to exist, we were informed that said\r\n     copy would be furnished the next day; but lo, and behold! when next\r\n     day came, we were told that the poll lists had been stolen the\r\n     night before. I charge that the vote of Lowndes, honestly counted\r\n     as cast, would give me over 2,000 majority, instead of over 1,600\r\n     majority for Governor Jones, as returned, which would make a\r\n     difference in my favor of over 3,600 votes. The same facts exist as\r\n     to Wilcox county. I charge that not over 3,000 votes were actually\r\n     cast in this county in the August election, and if honestly counted\r\n     I would have received a majority of not less than 500. Yet by fraud\r\n     and ballot-box stuffing and holding back the returns for over a\r\n     week after the election, a majority of over 4,300 was given to\r\n     Governor Jones. An honest count in this county would show 4,500\r\n     votes in my favor. But it was reserved to Dallas county to outdo\r\n     all others, in the way of ballot-box stuffing and fraudulent\r\n     returns, by which a majority of over 6,100 was figured out for\r\n     Governor Jones. An honest count of the vote as actually cast would\r\n     give me over 3,000 majority, making a difference of over 9,000\r\n     votes in my favor, from this county alone. In Selma beat the\r\n     returns show that 2,642 votes were cast, and a majority of over\r\n     2,300 returned for Governor Jones. The facts are, that not\r\n     exceeding 1,400 votes were actually cast in Selma beat, and fully\r\n     600 of those cast were for the Kolb ticket. The census gave Selma\r\n     beat a population of only 7,600, all told, and yet, they return\r\n     2,642 of this population as having voted. One voter out of five is\r\n     above the average of most populations, but Selma has found a way to\r\n     manufacture nearly three voters out of every five of her people. In\r\n     some of the 'black' beats of the county, only thirty to forty votes\r\n     were actually cast, by both white and colored voters, and yet the\r\n     returns give from 400 to 700 majority from these beats, to Governor\r\n     Jones. I charge that not as many votes were cast in the county of\r\n     Dallas for both Jones and Kolb as the majority claimed for Governor\r\n     Jones. The truth is, that Governor Jones did not actually receive\r\n     over 1,300 votes, all told, in the county, and yet he is\r\n     fraudulently given over 6,100 majority. In Perry county the same\r\n     frauds and ballot-box stuffing were resorted to, and hundreds of\r\n     dead men made to vote for Thomas Goode Jones. With an honest count\r\n     of the vote of Perry as actually cast, I would have received a\r\n     majority of over 500 votes, instead of a majority of over 1,800 for\r\n     Governor Jones, as returned, which would make a difference of over\r\n     2,300 votes in my favor. In Hale county, all will remember, that\r\n     the first report received from that county after the election, gave\r\n     me the county by over 1,600 majority, but the political bosses here\r\n     urged them to hold back the returns and 'doctor' them; that the\r\n     'organized' ticket was in great danger and the 'black belt' was\r\n     expected to do her duty. Hale was equal to the emergency, and in a\r\n     few days revised her returns and figured out over 1,200 majority\r\n     for Governor Jones. I charge that the vote of Hale, if honestly\r\n     counted, as actually cast, would give me a majority of over 2,500,\r\n     which would be a difference of over 3,700 in my favor. The same\r\n     irregularities occurred in Greene county, where a true majority of\r\n     over 500 for me was changed into a fictitious majority of 500 for\r\n     Governor Jones, showing a difference of over 1,000 in my favor. In\r\n     Sumpter county my majority was fully 500 more than was returned for\r\n     me, and about the same in Pickens; and in Marengo county, an honest\r\n     count of the vote as cast would have given me the county by a safe\r\n     majority, instead of 1,000 majority for Governor Jones as returned.\r\n\r\n     \"In Macon county, by fraud and manipulations, a true majority of\r\n     about 2,000 for me was reduced to a little over 700. In Bullock\r\n     county, by frauds, manipulations and partisan abuses by county\r\n     returning-boards, a majority of over 1,800 was given Governor Jones\r\n     when, in fact, if he was entitled to any majority at all, it\r\n     should have been less than 200. In Autauga county an honest count\r\n     of the vote actually cast, would have given me the county by at\r\n     least 500 majority, but by ballot-box stuffing and fraudulently\r\n     counting-out votes cast for the Kolb ticket and substituting Jones\r\n     tickets instead, a small majority was falsely returned for Governor\r\n     Jones. In all these 'black belt' counties a majority of the judges\r\n     of probate, sheriffs and clerks, whose duty it was to appoint the\r\n     inspectors of elections, were friends of Governor Jones, and in\r\n     most of the counties, the rights of the Kolb faction were utterly\r\n     ignored, and no friend of mine permitted to act as manager or clerk\r\n     at any of the beats. Only at a few 'white' beats, in any of these\r\n     counties, were we allowed any representation. My political enemies\r\n     were not satisfied with this great wrong done me in the 'black\r\n     belt' counties but invaded some of the 'white' counties, and by\r\n     fraud and manipulation in the beats, or by partisan action on the\r\n     part of county returning-boards, on the Saturday following the\r\n     election, robbed me of over 10,000 votes to which I was justly\r\n     entitled. In Conecuh county I received a majority of 1,235 votes,\r\n     and yet, by throwing out boxes and robbing others, this majority\r\n     was all wiped out, and a false majority of 270 given to Governor\r\n     Jones. In Pike county I received a majority of 910 votes and the\r\n     returns from eleven beats, giving me large majorities, were thrown\r\n     out or destroyed by the county returning-board, and a majority of\r\n     55 given to Governor Jones. The contests in both of these counties\r\n     (Conecuh and Pike) have been virtually decided in my favor by Judge\r\n     Hubbard, in his decision in the contest cases for judge of probate\r\n     in each county. His opinion, as rendered, being in favor of Dr. R.\r\n     A. Lee, of Conecuh, and T. H. Brown, of Pike, both of whom were\r\n     candidates for probate judge on the Kolb ticket. In like manner, as\r\n     in Conecuh and Pike, I was robbed of over 1,000 votes in Butler,\r\n     over 1,000 in Elmore, over 600 in Coosa, over 700 in St. Clair,\r\n     over 700 in Shelby, over 100 in Chilton, over 1,000 in Talladega,\r\n     over 500 in Walker, over 1,000 in Morgan and over 1,000 in Madison.\r\n     I have given plain and unvarnished facts, as I believe them to\r\n     exist, and positively assert that a fair and impartial investigation\r\n     will prove every statement made, to be true. It may be asked why the\r\n     evidence is not here adduced to prove these allegations. If adduced\r\n     here, these same parties would say that it was all _ex parte_ and\r\n     that it would be controverted and destroyed, if both sides should be\r\n     heard. Besides, they know that the details necessary to be recounted\r\n     as to each beat in so many counties, would make a summary too\r\n     voluminous to be incorporated in an address. All I ask is that a\r\n     full, fair and impartial investigation shall be had and that a true\r\n     judgment may be rendered. If Governor Jones and his friends are not\r\n     afraid of truth, equity and justice, why do they refuse? If the\r\n     effect would only be to remove a cloud from his title to the office,\r\n     would he not gladly embrace such an opportunity? 'But there's the\r\n     rub.' They well know that an investigation would disclose frauds and\r\n     manipulations which could not be defended, and would prove his claim\r\n     to the office of governor wholly unfounded upon right. That is why\r\n     they dare not permit an investigation. That is why some of them talk\r\n     so glibly what they would not dare to utter over their own\r\n     signatures. That is why the Legislature has treated this matter with\r\n     silence, while patriotic representatives of the people have urged and\r\n     insisted upon action, so that justice might be done, and right\r\n     triumph. Every honest man knows that Governor Jones has no shadow of\r\n     claim to the office of governor. The people, by their votes in\r\n     August, relegated him to private life for the next two years, and yet\r\n     he is sitting up at the Capitol upon a lot of stuffed ballot-boxes\r\n     from the 'black belt,' and claiming his election. Some of his best\r\n     friends have publicly declared that he could not afford to hold the\r\n     office in the face of such fraudulent returns, and if he persisted\r\n     in doing so, he would go down to posterity more despised than\r\n     Rutherford B. Hayes. I am only contending for what is right. As a\r\n     native-born citizen of Alabama, and one who has always endeavored\r\n     to serve my people and state to the best of my ability, both in\r\n     time of war and in time of peace, I feel that I have a right to\r\n     demand that justice be done. Thousands of true men all over this\r\n     great commonwealth honored me with their support in the August\r\n     election, and in their name I demand of the Legislature, a prompt\r\n     and impartial investigation of this matter. These people represent\r\n     a majority of the white voting population and demand a respectful\r\n     hearing. I beg you, members of the Legislature, not to mistake the\r\n     temper of these people. Remember that a large majority of them have\r\n     been life-long Democrats. While they don't believe in, and never\r\n     will submit to the domination of a few party bosses, yet they do\r\n     believe in the time-honored principles of pure Jeffersonian\r\n     Democracy. They have been the true, the tried and unflinching\r\n     Democrats, who have heretofore fought the battles and won the\r\n     victories of the party in Alabama. True to its noble cause, true to\r\n     every great principle, and true to every demand of patriotism upon\r\n     them, they have been in the fore-front of every contest when\r\n     victory was won, and the firm and immovable, the true and faithful\r\n     guardians of its cause, in every defeat we have ever sustained.\r\n     Many of these people were gallant soldiers in the late war, and\r\n     since 1865 have been battling for the Democratic party in Alabama.\r\n     Many of them have reared sons, in whose breasts they early planted\r\n     the principles of true Democracy, and taught them that it was the\r\n     party of the people. They believe that Democracy means that the\r\n     people shall rule, and that white people should govern Alabama.\r\n     They now feel that a few political bosses are undertaking to\r\n     overthrow a republican form of government in this state. I warn you\r\n     to stop and reflect. Don't trifle with these people longer. Let\r\n     justice be done, and sweet Peace will again spread her white wings\r\n     over our beloved state.\r\n\r\n     \"R. F. KOLB.\r\n\r\n     \"Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 15, 1892.\"\r\n\r\nNothing but silence answers this scathing arraignment of the Democratic\r\nparty of Alabama. The burning charges of corruption and robbery meet no\r\nrebuttal; none could truthfully be made. Many weeks after the publication\r\nof Captain Kolb's letter, the Birmingham _Age-Herald_, of March 3, 1893,\r\ncontained a remarkable editorial confession, headed: \"That Political\r\nPest,\"--which may enable one to form some opinion of the sentiment of the\r\naverage Jones Democrat regarding the Kolb-Jones contest and \"dispute\" over\r\nthe election. This quotation from the editorial will prove quite\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n     \"Now the fact is that the Populists will fight the Democratic party\r\n     in 1894 on the issue of the last August election, and their cry\r\n     will be so many variations of the contest matter. The plain facts\r\n     of this matter had as well be understood first as last. If Captain\r\n     Kolb and the other gentlemen who ran on his ticket had supported\r\n     Cleveland and held good their claims to being Democrats, a contest\r\n     law would have been enacted. Public sentiment would have compelled\r\n     it, and the dispute over the election would have been legally\r\n     settled, and in all probability Governor Jones would have been\r\n     governor just as he is now. But when Captain Kolb and his fellow\r\n     candidates on his state ticket, went bodily over to Mr. Harrison\r\n     and conspired with Chris Magee, public sentiment revolted. From\r\n     that moment all possibility of a contest law vanished. The\r\n     organized Democracy would not hear to yielding an inch of ground,\r\n     and all the influence of Governor Jones himself could not have\r\n     availed to procure a contest law from the Legislature. That is a\r\n     plain statement of fact. That is the shape it will assume in 1894.\r\n     In the meanwhile, if we begin the campaign already, how are we\r\n     going to have any rest?\"\r\n\r\nAs is easily apparent from reading the foregoing editorial, the principal\r\nexcuse of the \"machine bosses\" as to why the office of governor was stolen\r\nfrom Captain Kolb, is \"because he did not support Cleveland!\" This silly\r\ntwaddle about Captain Kolb going over to Harrison, is just such\r\nnonsensical stuff as the average of Alabama Democratic editors deem fit to\r\nfeed the Democratic \"gods and little fishes\" on. What other available\r\nmatter have they, when truth, right and reason have forever departed from\r\ntheir sanctums and from their cause?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ONE OF PREJUDICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting those who have resided in the South, few people outside have\r\nany true conception whatever, of what means a contest against the fixed\r\nideas and established policies of the ruling element in this section.\r\nNot until recently have the searching currents of thought inundated, to\r\na great and perceptible extent, the foundations of bitter prejudice that\r\nhave been the main basis of the monster political structure which has\r\ntowered in its glory in the South since the days of reconstruction. For\r\na long time, few there were who would dare to revolt against its darkened\r\nwalls, lest they might forever be driven from the shadow of its wings.\r\n\r\nIt is no idle charge that is embodied in the frequent statement that the\r\n\"par\" prejudiced Democratic politicians in Alabama will adopt any method,\r\nfoul or fair, _especially foul_, that may perpetuate the control of that\r\nparty, in this state. And it has been the dire dread of becoming a victim\r\nof just such venomous partisans as these that has awed aspiring men of\r\nthis state into party line and once made it seriously doubtful whether\r\nany able man would jeopardize his political prospects by being so bold as\r\nto stand out in opposition to the \"Democracy (?) of Alabama,\" and its\r\nshadowy practices, which Southern young men have been taught by\r\ngray-haired parents to believe justifiable.\r\n\r\nWhen, for once, the prejudice of the leaders and the animosity of the\r\nrabble of the Democratic party is fully aroused and incited against any\r\nperson who would ally himself with the opposition, then the subject of\r\nthis ardent persecution may expect that never will he, nor his seed, go\r\nforgotten by an unrelenting foe, until such prejudice-bearing life is\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nThe time has been when Alabama Democrats would not concede it a\r\nright for a Southern voter to be anything else than a \"booster\"\r\nfor the \"machine bosses.\" The privilege to oppose the Democratic\r\nparty--considering the treatment accorded those who lately antagonized\r\nthat party in the South--is generally supposed by \"Bourbons\" not to\r\nexist, even now.\r\n\r\nDuring the heat of political campaigns,--and especially was it the case\r\nin Alabama last year,--every imaginable pressure is brought to bear upon\r\nthose who do not see fit to support the Democratic ticket. Ostracism is\r\npractised in both social and business life. Merchants withhold supplies\r\nfrom farmers, wealthy landlords threaten the discharge of their tenants,\r\nand mortgage-holders talk wildly of foreclosures, to those who express a\r\ndesire to exercise the right of franchise according to their own belief\r\nand as free men of a so-called free republic. In no other section of the\r\ncountry are such political forces as these exerted to so radical a\r\ndegree, or is the \"party lash\" wielded with so tremendous a flourish.\r\nThe \"party lash\" cracker must be devised so as to \"drive them into\r\nline;\" it makes no difference what the nature of the material may be, if\r\nits popping is fitting for the time and purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF \"PARTY LASH\" CRACKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of Democrats in Alabama, until recently, have blindly\r\ndrifted along, neglecting every interest. Thinking of nothing else,\r\nscarcely, than \"machine boss\" protection from the near approach of some\r\nhighly-pictured prospective woe, ever since before the late war, when\r\nslaveholders waved the party lash and popped the cracker of \"secession\r\nor ruin,\"--until now, when the sons of ex-slaveholders, and others that\r\nform the \"domineering bossism\" in Alabama, pop the cracker of \"Democracy\r\nor negro rule.\" From the time when the \"old plantation darkey,\" hat in\r\nhand, stood humbly before his master to hear that he was no longer a\r\nchattel slave, until now, the \"bulldozing\" ex-slaveholding lord has\r\n\"blowed\" about the danger of \"negro rule\" and the sons of this class of\r\noffice-holding hierarchy have as blusteringly echoed the farce. They\r\nfailed to remember that it was the wrinkled hands of the old colored\r\nslave that were stretched out in protection over his master's loved ones\r\nwhen the deadly flash and quaking thunder of battle threatened Southern\r\nhomes, and they soon unkindly pictured them as demon clutches. There is\r\nno reasonable ground for fear of \"negro supremacy.\" It is the domination\r\nof the man with the black heart, without special reference to \"hide,\"\r\nthat the yoemanry of Alabama must really fear. It is not the supremacy\r\nof the negro that curses, or may curse the white productive classes, but\r\nit is the supremacy of \"machine bosses\" who, through the fraudulent\r\nmanipulation of the ballot-box in counties with a predominance of\r\ncolored population, roll up fictitious and enormous majorities in order\r\nto defeat the will of the white people of other counties. This\r\nwhite-\"hided,\" black-hearted class, which has always popped the cracker\r\nof \"negro supremacy\" are now those who wrongfully dominate a majority of\r\nthe white people of Alabama on account of stuffed ballot-boxes\r\nextravagantly based upon a negro population. The \"antediluvian,\"\r\nex-slaveholding Democrat has talked much about this or that party being\r\na \"negro party,\" but for a certainty this Pharisaical set can now see in\r\ntheir own \"dear old Democratic party\" in Alabama a full-fledged \"negro\r\nparty.\" The Kolb-Jones election demonstrates this fact. Jones having\r\nreceived majorities in no other than \"black belt\" counties. Be it said\r\nto the credit of the \"black belt\" negroes, however, they protest that\r\nthey did not vote for Jones and are amazed that the country has palmed\r\nthe Democratic party of Alabama, and the responsibility for its\r\nexistence, off on them. The national election in Alabama, a fac-simile\r\nof the state election, sustains the apparently dark complexion of that\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe \"Force Bill\" cracker is another very available \"party lash\" snap.\r\nDemocratic campaign orators never fail to picture, in their denunciation\r\nof this hobgoblin, burly negroes guarding the polls with bayonets while\r\ntimid white men come trembling forward to deposit their ballots. \"Unless\r\nthe Democratic ticket is elected, such a state of affairs will most\r\ncertainly exist,\" shouts the office-holder, and there are, even now,\r\nvoters in Alabama who are simple enough to believe it. No party\r\nadvocates or indorses a measure of any such provisions, yet the people\r\nof the South are told that a vote against the Democratic party means the\r\nsupport of just such a state of affairs, and if possible, something\r\nworse. It is argued by Democrats, that under such a perilous\r\nprobability, no farmer could justly consider his empty pocket,\r\npoverty-stricken home, overworked and shabbily-clothed family, and\r\npoorly-educated children, \"and go off to discussing the money question.\"\r\n\r\nUntil of recent years, the rank and file of the people in Alabama\r\nusually \"kicked up the dust\" in their terrible display of hostility to\r\nanything antagonistic to the Democratic party. In the meantime, the\r\n\"machine bosses\" wielded the \"party lash\" and popped the snap crackers\r\nover their heads; ingeniously playing upon their passions and\r\nprejudices, and always holding the offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE TROUBLE OF THE SIXTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Alabama were plunged into the bloody, surging sea of\r\ntrouble in the sixties by the same extremist element in the South, which\r\nhas more than once ruled more desperately than wisely, and is, in times\r\nof great emergency, scarcely conservative or sensible. The writer often\r\nimagines he can hear some of these same old blustering members of the\r\nex-slave- and present office-holding hierarchy exciting the common\r\npeople back before the sixties with their now \"moss-covered\" harangues,\r\nand wonders if some of the common herd could again be herded by these\r\nsame herdsmen and be driven into another conflict of \"a poor man's fight\r\nand a rich man's war.\"\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for the rash domination of this \"rule or ruin\" element\r\nin the South at that time, there is no doubt but that \"the war between the\r\nStates\" could have been averted, with far greater advantage to the people\r\nof this section.\r\n\r\nThe masses of the people of Alabama were not at heart secessionists, but\r\nit is, as heretofore, unwritten truth that this state was seceded\r\nfraudulently by the original \"machine bosses\" who dictated the seating\r\nof the delegates in the \"secession convention,\" and who ruthlessly\r\nsacrificed the lives and property of the poor in a vain endeavor to add\r\nto the coffers of the rich landlord by further enslaving humanity.\r\n\r\nReformers in Alabama are to-day fought hardest and persecuted most by\r\nthe sons of the class of men who fought the poor white man during the\r\nlate war and spoliated his meagre possessions, in order that the\r\nshackles might be kept on the ankles of the black man so the rich\r\nlandlord could prolong his princely ways. Opposing the present movement\r\nfor universal industrial freedom are represented those who have\r\nstrangled Liberty at every stage of her growth, and who respect the\r\nneeds of the poor white man now, as little as they did the wants of the\r\npoor slaves then.\r\n\r\nThe common people always fight all the battles in times of war, create\r\nall the wealth in periods of peace; but, whether in the battle of blood\r\nor the struggle for bread, they have never reaped a substantial benefit\r\nfrom either contest. They have been engaged in a prolonged, though\r\nvarying struggle, all down the history of the ages, and greed and\r\navarice have always sapped their energies and sucked their life-blood.\r\n\r\nSuch is truly a too real recital of the actual experience of the Alabama\r\ncitizen ex-soldier, as he now is in the ranks of \"the common masses of\r\nthe common people,\" battling for bread with about as much hope of\r\nreaping a happy reward in this contest, as he had of winning a\r\nsoul-swelling victory in that of the sixties. How sad is the narrative\r\nof the real life of the average Alabamian, who has always been loyal to\r\nthe political leaders of his native state, worshiping even at the shrine\r\nof the name \"Democracy,\" but, after years of toil, privation and\r\nendurance, approaches the verge of eternity unable to bequeath a\r\nheritage of neither full-fledged liberty nor free-titled land to\r\nuneducated, homeless and hopeless children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWANT PRODUCES THINKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome species of the brute creation open their eyes in nine days, but\r\nsome of the poor, blinded and burden-bearing creatures of humanity\r\nscarcely ever succeed in getting their eyes fully open to the light of\r\nGod's blessed bestowals to mankind. Others soon realize the\r\nrepulsiveness of the black shadows that enthrall them and bite the dust\r\nin anguish in their struggle to be free. And often, when higher reason\r\nfails to prompt one to action, unsatiated appetite constitutes a\r\nnever-failing reminder. As necessity is the mother of invention, so is\r\npoverty productive of thought. The earlier one's condition is reduced to\r\nwant, the sooner will the thought \"materialize into action.\" Thus it is\r\nwith the debt-ridden toiler, the farmless farmer and the produceless\r\nproducer in their unrest in Alabama to-day. The general want has\r\nproduced general thought. Thought has instituted inquiry. Investigation\r\nhas inaugurated a revolt. The opposition to the Democratic party was, in\r\nthis manner, born out of want. Term it the \"third party,\" or whatever\r\nyou may choose, it is really a necessary party; and its growth will\r\ncontinue as long as the wants and demands of the neglected productive\r\ninterests go unheeded.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious old party leaders may appeal to the passions of some; the\r\n\"Force Bill,\" like Banquo's ghost, may continue to \"bob up;\" the farcial\r\ncry of \"negro supremacy\" may again fill the air; but the wide-awake\r\nspirit is becoming prevalent, and these politicians, instead of being\r\nabsorbed with the tar-_iff_, will soon be astounded at the tear-_off_\r\nfrom the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of the usurer's grasp is more likely, hereafter, to convince\r\nthe possessor of the ballot of his duty, than will the artful arraying\r\nof one section by corporation talent. The presence of the legislative\r\ncurse that makes the over-producing producer produceless, will, in days\r\nsoon to come, more largely influence a vast majority of the citizens of\r\nthis state in the exercise of their inalienable will, than will the\r\nDemocratic hobgoblin of the farcial prospective (?) \"Force Bill.\" The\r\nappeal for education that comes from the innocent eyes of little\r\nchildren, as they caress a weary mother's careworn face, shall soon\r\ncarry more force of persuasion with the voter than will the bluster of\r\noffice-seekers in their feigned warnings of \"negro rule;\" and the father\r\nwill then seek to hand down to his children the magic wand that is\r\ndispelling brutishness from the face of all the earth.\r\n\r\nThought having once inundated the passion-played Southern public mind,\r\nan awakening is begun, and, aroused to an appreciation of affairs as\r\nthey exist, the rank and file of the people of Alabama are in an\r\nastounding state of agitation. Some idea of the extent of this unrest\r\ncan be derived by recalling to mind the results of the last elections.\r\nThis change in public sentiment, and attainments of the reform crusaders\r\nagainst the organized Democracy, will best be appreciated by an\r\nunderstanding of the campaign intolerance and election methods which\r\nhave made the \"Bourbon\" historic, and which is fast making all those who\r\nbelieve in keeping sacred our free institutions, shrink from the support\r\nof men of such a party and a party of such methods and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\"BOURBON\" CAMPAIGN INTOLERANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolt of the common people of Alabama against the \"machine bosses\"\r\nis, simply speaking, a revolution against revolutionists; and the\r\nincreasing strength of the former is rapidly developing the intolerant\r\nspirit of the latter. This savage-natured sentiment that has characterized\r\nthe campaign policy of the Democratic party of the South in its treatment\r\nof the opposition, has often received the scathing criticism of many a\r\ncaustic pen. Yet nothing too severe could be said in its condemnation.\r\n\r\nIt is the most idle and hollow mockery for any writer or any newspaper\r\nto attempt to repudiate the rightful accusation, so long made, that the\r\nDemocratic party in the South is responsible for the campaign intolerance\r\nthat is practiced in this section. These outbursts of violence in the\r\nSouth and in Alabama are but the spasmodic ventings of an overwrought\r\npublic sentiment that has been instilled and tutored by the press and\r\nleaders of that party ever since the war. In reality, not half has been\r\ntold of the attempts at stifling free speech in Alabama.\r\n\r\nAlthough the entire record of the \"Bourbon\" element is indeed unenviable\r\nand astonishing, yet, never before in the history of Southern Democratic\r\ncampaign ruffianism had this spirit reached the height of deviltry\r\ndisplayed during 1892, in Alabama. With organized rabbles at their back,\r\nand partisan courts at their faces, political bullies openly boasted of\r\ntheir lawlessness and engaged in their dastardly outrages defiant to\r\nmorality, honesty, conscience or prosecution.\r\n\r\nDuring the last weeks of the Kolb-Jones campaign this barbaric nature\r\nwas beginning to be fully drawn out; the most cowardly demonstration of\r\nits existence having first been made at Florence, Ala., where the writer\r\nwas attacked at midnight, July 27, by a mob that had assembled at the\r\ndepot to do him violence upon his departure from the town. The mob, as\r\nwas stated by dispatches published in the Democratic press, consisted of\r\n\"fifty enraged citizens.\" The riotous crowd was incited and collected by\r\npartisans, for no other than a political cause; and had it not been that\r\nthe writer succeeded in reaching the platform of the car unobserved, no\r\ndoubt but that he would have been egged, stoned, or shot to death. The\r\nlights had been extinguished in the depot, which is located in a desolate\r\npart of the town, and every other arrangement was seemingly made for the\r\ndoing of a dark and bloody deed. These villainous plans proved, however,\r\nto be advantageous to the writer, who escaped a brutally-designed\r\nassassination by getting on the platform of the car before the shower of\r\nmissiles had commenced. The writer's hat suffered ruin from the\r\n\"indignation,\" and a Memphis & Charleston car was turned into the shops\r\nspattered and battered. Herewith is given a letter, referring to the\r\nFlorence incident, and as its author is one of Alabama's most eminent\r\nministers, this document will prove valuable literature:\r\n\r\n     \"Study of L. F. WHITTEN,\r\n         Pastor M. E. Church, South.\r\n             JASPER, Ala., Aug. 1, 1892.\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Brother Manning:\r\n\r\n     \"As soon as I have the time, I hasten to tender to you my sincere\r\n     sympathies for the barbarous and uncivilized treatment you received\r\n     at Florence a few days since. The correspondent of the _Age-Herald_,\r\n     who lives at Florence, saw 'an amusing sight last night to see the\r\n     boasted disciple of Kolbism, J. C. Manning, run from a volley of\r\n     rotten eggs thrown by fifty enraged men.' He could have seen in this\r\n     'amusing sight,' the return of the Spanish Inquisition and diabolic\r\n     intolerance of barbarism, had he been able to look ahead. This was\r\n     outrageous and inhuman treatment for which I assure you I am full of\r\n     regrets. I am ashamed that it has happened in Alabama or the South.\r\n     This spirit shown you, and the abuse heaped upon you, if not\r\n     denounced and punished speedily, will culminate in the hottest\r\n     persecution of an honest minority; which will prohibit free speech\r\n     and destroy the right to oppose the majority, although that majority\r\n     be led by the devil himself. If that spirit is not rebuked in our\r\n     state and the righteous indignation of our people does not stamp it\r\n     out swiftly, then the darkest days of the Rebellion will be bright\r\n     as compared to those to follow. This spirit will invade the pulpit\r\n     and go into the sanctum of the editor, and sermons will have to be\r\n     pleasant, pacific and agreeable, and editors must agree with those\r\n     in authority, or else the minister will be driven out of town, and\r\n     the editor will be rotten-egged or swung up by the thumbs! If that\r\n     comes to pass, then give me a monarchical government. I should\r\n     greatly prefer to appeal to Caesar, than to an enraged mob of 'fifty\r\n     or more citizens' (?) fired up with red liquor, and thirsting for\r\n     the blood of the man who differs from them,--a set of brainless,\r\n     heartless sapheads. I heard a gentleman who saw it, denounce it as\r\n     the most villainous thing he ever saw in a land of freedom. He does\r\n     not belong to your party,--neither do I,--but he was for you. You\r\n     keep on, if you die at your post. Mobs to-day, mausoleums to-morrow.\r\n     The party that resorts to such tactics may ride the top of the wave\r\n     to-day, but the good time is coming when that rotten and rum-soaked\r\n     method will be buried out of sight under an avalanche of ballots of\r\n     brave men, who scorn the rotten-egg method of answering brainy\r\n     arguments, which 'Bourbons' have not sense enough to meet in any\r\n     other way. For my part, I do not believe in intolerance. The day has\r\n     passed to allow it. God holds the reins of government. Life, liberty\r\n     and free speech are our own inalienable rights. To destroy these, as\r\n     the mobs would do, is to muzzle the press, kill the stump-speaker,\r\n     and hang the preacher who does not court popular applause, and who\r\n     defies public sentiment that is wrong.\r\n\r\n     \"Cordially yours for the Right,\r\n          L. F. WHITTEN.\"\r\n\r\n     \"P. S. I said I do not belong to your party. I am a political\r\n     Prohibitionist, and pray for the day to dawn when the sober and\r\n     sensible and honest manhood of our country may get together and\r\n     rule it.\r\n\r\n     \"L. F. W.\"\r\n\r\nOther instances of this frenzied partisan madness soon abounded. But the\r\nmost wicked resort of Democratic party passion, be it said to its\r\neternal shame, was made upon Col. J. M. Whitehead, editor of _The Living\r\nTruth_, Georgiana, Ala. Not content with destroying peace, planning and\r\nattempting midnight assassinations, hooting and howling at public\r\nmeetings, these haters of civil liberty and \"dying hard\" Democrats come\r\nforth in their extreme infernalism, and hurl eggs at a gray-haired,\r\none-legged, ex-Confederate soldier and citizen of irreproachable\r\nmanhood. In response to a request for a statement on this subject, the\r\nwriter received the following reply from Colonel Whitehead:\r\n\r\n     \"GREENVILLE, Ala., April 3, 1893.\r\n\r\n     \"J. C. Manning:\r\n\r\n     \"_Dear Sir_,--You ask me to write to you some of my experiences\r\n     during the campaign last year with our friends, the organized\r\n     Democracy. Knowing their methods so well, their 'wild and woolly'\r\n     ways did not surprise me. I had some experiences with them in 1884,\r\n     when I was an independent candidate for Congress in this district,\r\n     against Herbert. At Ross Hill, Covington county, I was set upon by\r\n     their tools, who had been organized before to kill me. It was a\r\n     miracle that the plan failed. As it was, I had an arm broken, a\r\n     shoulder dislocated and was left for dead on the ground. I had just\r\n     closed a speech in which I had exposed the unfaithfulness of their\r\n     Congressman (the nominee), which I had been doing for the past two\r\n     weeks and he had heard of it. He is now the Secretary of the Navy!\r\n     I had challenged him to a joint discussion and he had declined. He\r\n     was a Confederate soldier and so was I. I had lost a leg and he had\r\n     lost the use of an arm, but nothing of this kind could stand in the\r\n     way of his ambition. I never had any doubt but that he and his\r\n     henchmen instigated this cowardly assault upon me. Last year, most\r\n     of my speeches were made in the 'white counties' where our friends\r\n     are largely in the majority. I went to Union Springs, in Bullock\r\n     county,--a 'black county'--to engage the Hon. W. C. Oates in a\r\n     joint debate. He declined and I made no attempt to speak. As I was\r\n     leaving on the train from the depot that night, I was honored with\r\n     a shower of eggs coming through the car window at which I was\r\n     sitting. They passed within a few inches of my nose and breaking on\r\n     the other side of the car, fell on the good clothes of an\r\n     enthusiastic Democrat. Of course he was mad, while I was in the\r\n     best possible humor. I did the laughing and he did the swearing. It\r\n     took place as the train moved off, so that there was no chance to\r\n     investigate who the parties were. They were under the cover of\r\n     darkness, and doubtless will there remain.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Most respectfully,\r\n         J. M. WHITEHEAD.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are under the cover of darkness, and doubtless will there remain.\"\r\nWhat manner of Democracy (?) is this, which forms a prominent part of\r\nthe nation's administration--even entering the make-up of the cabinet of\r\nthe President! It is no surprise that an opposition cause to such a\r\nparty as this Democracy (?) would dare to undergo the most trying\r\ndifficulties in its struggle to maintain freedom of speech and to\r\nsustain human liberty; it is no wonder that the Southern champions of\r\nreform dare to preserve law, protect home and have honest government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nELECTION METHODS OF THE DEMOCRATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bourbon\" campaign intolerance, ballot-box stuffing and other similar\r\ncrimes against human liberty have become a common practice in the\r\npolitical contests in Alabama. It is said frequently by the opposition\r\nin this state that one's skill in fraudulent election manipulation wins\r\npromotion in the councils of the Democratic party. It is also not untrue\r\nthat voters who have been accomplices in perpetrating election frauds\r\nhave been rewarded with official positions \"on account of efficient\r\nservices rendered the party.\"\r\n\r\nThe election law in Alabama was framed for facilitating fraud as an\r\nalleged necessity for protection from negro supremacy. But, once having\r\nsecured the \"machine,\" the \"bosses\" have taken advantage of this\r\n\"original purpose,\" and have carried the practice of stealing ballots so\r\nfar as to feloniously take white men's votes in order to preserve the\r\n\"machine\" intact. This practice has been carried out to such an\r\noutrageous extent that an overwhelming majority of \"white\" ballots have\r\nfrequently been reversed by the \"machine bosses\" in order to continue\r\nthe evolution of the office-holding hierarchy. The original ballot-box\r\nstuffing law has been recently displaced by another equally as\r\niniquitous. This new law was enacted at the last session of the\r\nLegislature and is known as the \"Sayre Election Bill.\" As fair and able\r\ncriticism that has been made of this bill appeared in the _Alliance\r\nHerald_, Montgomery, Ala., edited by Frank Baltzell, one of the ablest\r\nand most forcible writers in the South. The _Alliance Herald_ says of\r\nthis measure:\r\n\r\n     \"The law should be captioned, 'A Bill to be entitled an Act to\r\n     Perpetuate the Frauds which have heretofore been practiced in\r\n     Alabama.' It is very ingenious in its draft, very adroit in its\r\n     omissions and very mischievous in its operations. The principal\r\n     idea in the bill is that it absolutely puts the control of\r\n     elections in this state into the control of the inspectors of\r\n     elections, by making everything about voting so hedged about by\r\n     secrecy that it is impossible to ever get the evidence of any fraud\r\n     that may be committed, and by making them the absolute directors\r\n     and controllers of those who may not be able to read and write. The\r\n     principal omission of the bill is that it does not provide for the\r\n     appointment of inspectors from each party or faction, or rather\r\n     fails to make provision for the enforcement of the existing section\r\n     in the code which provides for it, effective and certain to be\r\n     enforced. All the frauds in the elections are due to that defect.\r\n     The probate judge, clerk and sheriff do not pretend to enforce the\r\n     law fairly. Appeal to the courts to secure enforcement is a farce,\r\n     as appeal from the decision of the court delays the application of\r\n     the remedy, if the supreme court should order it, until after the\r\n     election shall be past. Each party or faction should be guaranteed,\r\n     under a heavy penalty upon these officers, fair and just\r\n     representation in the management, by having at least one inspector\r\n     and one clerk--those, too, whose names shall be suggested; for to\r\n     appoint one ignorant, careless or indifferent inspector, to watch\r\n     two inspectors and two clerks, is folly. The average ballot-box\r\n     stuffer can count out every time, when that is done. One man is\r\n     needed to watch the one who reads the ballot, and another to watch\r\n     the clerks. Without these two, the 'slick' artist can count out\r\n     every time. This omission in the bill makes it safer than the\r\n     present law, for a voter can now keep a list, and those of his\r\n     party can give their names and voluntarily tell him for whom they\r\n     voted, and thereby afford evidence available in a contest. This\r\n     bill purposely does away with this right by putting all the power\r\n     in the hands of the inspectors and keeping everybody fifty feet\r\n     away from any evidence whatever. The law is almost wholly devoted\r\n     to how voting shall be done. Nobody is concerned about that.\r\n     Everybody wants to know how the counting will be done, or how the\r\n     stuffing will be prevented. That power is kept securely in the\r\n     hands of the inspectors, and the inspectors' appointment is equally\r\n     as firmly kept in the hands of the judge of probate, clerk and\r\n     sheriff. That may seem a very adroit way of perpetuating fraud, but\r\n     it is neither smart, shrewd nor fair.\r\n\r\n     \"The law provides for booths or stalls--one for each fifty voters as\r\n     shown by the preceding election. One voter at a time gets a ticket\r\n     from an inspector, goes into the booth and is allowed five minutes\r\n     to prepare his ticket. If he cannot read or use his hands to make a\r\n     cross mark opposite each name of the candidate for whom he desires\r\n     to vote, the inspector appoints one of the partisans of his\r\n     party--not the voter's--to fix the ticket. He will fix it, too.\r\n     Nobody can see or hear what transpires between the voter and this\r\n     appointed manipulator. No penalty is provided for deceiving or\r\n     wrongly marking the ticket. All the frauds about that feature are\r\n     protected. When it is marked, the voter casts it. Why not number\r\n     it, so that it can be identified in case of contest or dispute?\r\n     That would prevent fraud, and is not wanted. No one is allowed\r\n     within fifty feet of the voting place nor the booths. There is\r\n     great particularity about the way the ticket shall be prepared, and\r\n     none shall be voted unless they shall have the initials of the\r\n     inspector who hands them out, on the ticket. Any other ticket, if\r\n     voted, shall not be counted. There is another chance for fraud.\r\n     Suppose the inspector refuses to mark his initials on the tickets,\r\n     there is no penalty and each one can refuse and defeat the\r\n     election.\r\n\r\n     \"The law requires the registration of voters to be completed the\r\n     first twelve days in June, before the August and November\r\n     elections. Before registering for each election, the voter must\r\n     present his poll-tax receipt. When he registers he gets a\r\n     registration certificate. When he votes he must present this\r\n     registration certificate and leave it with the inspector. The way\r\n     is not plain how it will get back to him, when he delivers it in\r\n     August and desires to vote in November, but it is supposed that he\r\n     will have a slim or good chance at that, as he shall be in accord\r\n     or opposition to the officer who ought to return it. If the\r\n     registrar fails to act after he shall be appointed, there is no way\r\n     for the voters of the beat to register that year; the probate judge\r\n     and registrar can manage that little trick so as to disfranchise\r\n     all the opposition beats with heavy majorities. The probate judge\r\n     can appoint another, but there is no penalty for not serving nor\r\n     for the appointment of an incompetent registrar. That feature is\r\n     well fixed. The bill provides penalties for everything to protect\r\n     secrecy, but nothing to protect the honesty of the count. It seems\r\n     to proceed on the assumption that the principal thing about an\r\n     election is secrecy, and that the honest expression of the will of\r\n     the voters is not to be protected. The inspectors will fix that for\r\n     the party to which they belong and the probate judge will see that\r\n     no other party or faction has any chance or prospect. As a remedy\r\n     for the troubles now complained of in the state, the bill is wholly\r\n     at variance from everything needed. It simply puts in the power of\r\n     the probate judge, clerk and sheriff of a county the power to\r\n     control every election.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing review of the \"Sayre Election Law,\" is no more than a just\r\nexposure of a legislative document devised and enacted for the\r\nsubversion of the will of the people. In other language, this law is\r\nnothing more nor nothing less than a legalized plot to commit treason\r\nagainst a republican form of government.\r\n\r\nWith the registration of voters and the management of elections in their\r\nown hands, the \"machine bosses\" of the \"black belt\" never fail to return\r\nany majority \"that is needed.\" As an instance of this corruption, let us\r\nrefer to the vote of last August, and of last November, in some of the\r\npolling places in the \"black belt\" counties. In the city of Montgomery,\r\nwhen in fact less than 1,000 votes were cast in August, 3,561 votes were\r\nreturned. Some weeks after the state election, one of the managers of\r\nelection in Beat 5 in Montgomery county, stated to Captain Kolb that\r\nthere were about 200 votes actually cast in this beat in the August\r\nelection and that the Kolb ticket received over one hundred and fifty of\r\nthem, and Jones the balance, but the returns gave Jones over four\r\nhundred majority! This statement was made to Captain Kolb unsolicited,\r\nand by a man who said he had voted for Jones, but was suffering from a\r\npunctured conscience on account of the wrong he had done the people of\r\nAlabama and himself, by assisting in ballot-box stuffing. Hundreds of\r\nsimilar cases that occurred in the August election may be given, where\r\nthe ballot-boxes were not only stuffed, but the count reversed.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the Legislature, at the time of the election of\r\ndistrict court solicitors for the present term, a gentleman who happened\r\nto be in Montgomery at the time, found the following letter on the floor\r\nin the office of the Merchants' Hotel:\r\n\r\n     \"HATCH., Nov. 8, 1892.\r\n\r\n     \"MR. J. V. SMITH, Seale, Ala.:\r\n\r\n     \"We are going to be 'snowed under' here to-day. Our only hope is to\r\n     be able to throw out the box. Write me by this P. M. mail the most\r\n     complete plan to do it. Would too many ballots in the box do it? or\r\n     which is best?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Yours, L. 3--3.--\"\r\n\r\nThe envelope which contained this interesting letter, was addressed \"J.\r\nV. Smith, Esq., Seale, Ala.,\" and bears the postmark--\"Hatchechubbee,\r\nAla., Nov. 8, 1892.\" This letter revealed \"election methods.\" Upon\r\ninvestigation, it was learned that Hatchechubbee is a small box of not\r\nover 300 votes and that it took two days to do the counting, and then, in\r\nspite of being \"snowed under,\" the Democratic ticket claimed 79 majority!\r\nIt is only ten miles from Seale to Hatchechubbee. At Oswichee, a beat in\r\nthe same county of Russell,--in which is Hatchechubbee,--there were 74\r\nmore votes in the box than were voters' names on the poll list. Just such\r\n\"double-dealing\" as this, no doubt, won Cleveland's majority in this\r\ncounty. It is useless to add that \"J. V. Smith\" is an office-holder. He\r\nwas elected solicitor for the present term in the Third Congressional\r\nDistrict. As to \"L. 3--3.--\" it will be noticed that the letter _C_ is\r\nthird in the alphabet, which makes \"L. 3.--3.--\" when the letter _C_ is\r\nused in place of \"3.--3.\" read \"L. C. C.\" This \"L. C. C., Hatchechubbee,\r\nAla.,\" is quite partisan in his feelings and is very much disturbed in\r\nhis sleep with nightmares of \"negro supremacy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctoring\" registration lists is an effective way of preventing boxes\r\nfrom being thrown out on account of not having enough names on the poll\r\nlist. In some of the \"black belt\" counties these lists are very sacred,\r\nas they contain the names of many dead negroes and good coon-dogs. An\r\nex-sheriff of Marion county stated to the writer that, in the discharge\r\nof the duties of that office several years ago, it became necessary for\r\nhim to save his own life by killing a negro criminal, who had attacked\r\nhim. The ex-sheriff said that the occurrence often came to his mind,\r\nwhich was full of regrets because of the affair. \"However,\" said he, \"I\r\nam now feeling easy over the affair, as upon examining the registration\r\nlists at the court-house a few days ago, I found the name of this same\r\nnegro registered, and learned that he was voted for Jones.\"\r\n\r\nMany are the ways by which the Democratic party has overcome any\r\nopposition in Alabama. \"Doctoring\" registration lists, stuffing\r\nballot-boxes, reversing the count, throwing out election returns, etc.,\r\nhas been quite a pastime for the \"machine bosses.\" And soon they will\r\nbegin to realize \"the cost of their game.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose the opposition party, which now has control of thirty-nine\r\ncounties out of the sixty-six in the state, should resort to the\r\nshameful election tactics of the Democratic party! Who could picture\r\nthe termination of such a result? Referring to such a revolutionary\r\nimprobability, the _Alliance Herald_ says:\r\n\r\n     \"When the thirty-nine 'white' counties shall commence to count, if\r\n     they should regard that as the last resort, the figures in a state\r\n     election would be as startling as amusing. Think of Dallas rolling\r\n     up 10,000 majority one way, and Etowah rolling up 12,000 for the\r\n     opposing ticket. Then let Montgomery roll up her 7,000 and see how\r\n     they would compare with Coosa's 7,000 or Cleburne's 5,000. Then let\r\n     Wilcox come serenely forward with her usual 6,000 and DeKalb call\r\n     her hand with 7,000. Lowndes, too, could bob up serenely with her\r\n     6,000 and Dale could 'see her' with as blossoming a rose of\r\n     innocence in a game she does not understand and show up 6,000. The\r\n     'white' counties have been holding aloof, until the tricksters\r\n     worked them in November, but they have found out a thing or two,\r\n     and if counting must be done they will startle the natives with the\r\n     unblushing character of what could be done. The 'black belt' had\r\n     best not force this competition. When Dallas kills 5000 'white'\r\n     votes in a 'white' county, by fraudulently counting that number of\r\n     negro votes in order to succeed, should the whites play for even,\r\n     it will not be difficult to divine what will be the result. The\r\n     _Herald_ does not advocate this sort of tactics nor does anyone in\r\n     the 'white' counties, but there is a great deal of silent thinking\r\n     about it. No one wants to do it; but if self-preservation shall\r\n     demand it to thwart the aggressions of the 'black belt,' just watch\r\n     and see how the innocent and guileless man can 'swear to conduct\r\n     this election for the best interests of the white people' and down\r\n     the 'black belt.'\"\r\n\r\nBut the writer thinks \"self-preservation\" will not demand such a course.\r\nThis is not a time for such practices. The common people know it. They\r\nare determined to press forward their revolt against the party that gave\r\nbirth to such revolutionary ideas. The common people of Alabama will not\r\nsubmit longer to such outrages. They are demanding, and, in the name of\r\nGod and humanity, _will have_ a free and fair expression of their\r\npolitical will on the rostrum and at the polls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSUCCESS OF THE POPULISTS ASSURED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Alabama will no longer vote the Democratic ticket simply\r\nbecause the \"antediluvian\" leaders say so. They will no longer be\r\nintimidated by party threats, or blindly driven by party lash, but they\r\nare going to have a good reason for so doing, hereafter, before casting\r\ntheir votes for the party which has been in power in Alabama for\r\neighteen years, during the whole of which time the people have grown\r\npoorer and poorer and no measures have been adopted or suggested for\r\ntheir relief. The great masses of the people cannot again be forced to\r\nneglect more pressing interests to take issue on tariff reform only.\r\nWhile these people favor tariff reform they demand other more vital\r\nthings as well, and they have formulated these demands into a party\r\nplatform; and the brave and patriotic people who have the courage to\r\nmaintain their convictions, will no longer be frightened from the issues\r\nthey indorse, by threats of disrupting an existing political\r\nparty,--especially when there no longer remains any necessity for\r\nkeeping that party together.\r\n\r\nFor what purpose are political parties organized and why do they\r\ncontinue their existence? The reading and thinking masses understand\r\nthat there is but one answer: Political parties are formed to educate\r\nthe people upon a proposed policy and to be instrumental in having such\r\npolicy enacted into law as soon as the majority of voters favor and cast\r\ntheir votes for it. When the policy which brings a party into existence\r\nhas become accepted as a proper theory of government and ceases to have\r\nany opposition, then the necessity of the political party itself ceases,\r\nfor it has nothing else to accomplish. It is proper and usual, however,\r\nfor such a party to continue its existence until some other living\r\nissues arise which demand the consideration of the voter. When this is\r\ndone, one of the political parties which has accomplished its mission,\r\nshould, by appropriate platform, present the issues of the voters of the\r\ncountry; or some new party having that object in view, should be formed.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party was formed for the purpose of eradicating chattel\r\nslavery in America, opposed secession, and incidentally favored a high\r\nprotective tariff to enable the United States Government to carry on the\r\nCivil War. The Democratic party in the South favored slavery and\r\nsecession, and thus the issues were made. The Republican party established\r\nthe objects of its organization and it is conceded that it was right, both\r\nin its opposition to slavery and secession, and hence the issues then\r\ndividing the old parties are now dead issues, leaving the only issue the\r\nincidental one of protection. The fundamental principles promulgated by\r\nJefferson upon which the Democratic party was organized, have been\r\ninstilled into the hearts of practically all Americans and no organized\r\npolitical party is necessary to maintain them. The issues formerly\r\ndividing the Democratic and Republican parties (excepting the tariff)\r\nare no longer in politics; and the political \"bosses\" of neither party\r\ncan show why those who once opposed slavery and secession should remain\r\nas a separate political organization, and those who once favored it\r\nshould remain as one also, while there are living issues concerning the\r\nwelfare of the masses of the common people, about which no concern is\r\nmanifested by either of the old parties.\r\n\r\nHad the Democratic party adopted the living issues and burning demands\r\nof the common people in its platform, and honestly advocated their\r\nspeedy enactment into law, then it would be the party of the people. The\r\nrank and file of that party in the South and West does not express any\r\nmarked disapproval of the principal demands for reform that are embodied\r\nin the platform of the People's party, yet, nine-tenths of the voters of\r\nthe Democratic party are controlled adversely to their political belief\r\nby one-tenth--the Wall Street or Eastern portion. And, as S. S. King,\r\nEsq., a noted reform author, has said, \"Whistling against the wind in\r\nthe effort to drown the fury of the tempest, has always been as\r\neffectual as the effort of Western and Southern Democracy to reform in\r\nthe face of Wall Street dictation.\" Unfortunately for the Democratic\r\nparty, it has been controlled by this un-Democratic Eastern end of\r\nitself until the importunings of the common people of the West and\r\nSouth have been ignored. The thunder of the \"Tammany tiger\" having\r\ndrowned the appeals of the Western and Southern producers, they have\r\nbeen forced to present their demands by independent political action,\r\nand the People's party was necessarily the result; and if these people\r\nhave the courage and manhood to stand firm to their convictions, and to\r\nresist the \"party lash\" which the \"machine bosses\" will of course\r\ncontinue to vigorously apply, there can be no question as to its success\r\nin Alabama.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, however, before the strength of any new issues can\r\neven be tested in this state, the \"machine bosses\" who have reigned\r\nsupreme in Alabama for the last nineteen years must be dethroned. In the\r\nname of Democracy they have perverted every principle which the word\r\nrepresents, and by \"bulldozing\" and fraud, have constantly thwarted the\r\nwill of the people at the ballot-box. They have inaugurated methods as\r\ncorrupt and revolutionary as their despotic minds could conceive, that\r\ntheir dominancy of the common people, might be perpetuated with ease;\r\nthey have shaken the very foundation of the sacred covenant of liberty,\r\nbroken the peace, blighted the prosperity and threatened the homes of\r\nthe people; they have also hastened the time when all good,\r\nliberty-loving and truly democratic citizens of this state must unite in\r\nre-establishing the fact that they are the equals of the \"machine\r\nbosses,\" and that a majority should rule. When this is established in\r\nfact as well as in theory, then, and not until then, will the demands of\r\nthe people, which are favored by a majority of the people, be enacted\r\ninto law. Whether favoring or opposing the demands of the common people,\r\nall honest citizens should unite in an effort to secure to those\r\nfavoring them, the right to have the issues that come before the people\r\nfairly tested by a free ballot and a fair count of the votes polled.\r\nAnything else is slavery, which will not be submitted to by the common\r\npeople of Alabama. In the language of the greatest Alabamian of to-day,\r\nCapt. R. F. Kolb, the grandest Commoner of them all, whose every impulse\r\nis actuated by a desire to do service to his downtrodden fellow men:\r\n\r\n\"The common people of Alabama believe that democracy means that the\r\npeople shall rule. They now feel that a few political 'bosses' are\r\nundertaking to overthrow a republican form of government in this state.\r\nI warn the 'machine bosses' to stop and reflect. Don't trifle with these\r\npeople longer. Let justice be done and sweet Peace will again spread her\r\nwhite wings over our beloved state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nText in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been corrected without note.\r\n\r\nThe following misprints have been corrected:\r\n  \"manmer\" corrected to \"manner\" (page 14)\r\n  \"addresed\" corrected to \"addressed\" (page 34)\r\n  \"day\" corrected to \"days\" (page 34)\r\n  \"the the\" corrected to \"the\" (page 37)",
