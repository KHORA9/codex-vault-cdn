Preface\r\n\r\n\r\n_Much of the material included in this volume was collected several\r\nyears ago while the author was a graduate student at the University of\r\nPennsylvania. The researches then commenced probably first suggested to\r\nhim the lack in our political literature of an ample and interesting\r\naccount of the return of the States. Students, librarians, and even\r\nprofessors of history knew no adequate treatise on the era of\r\nreconstruction, and their testimony was confirmed by the authority of\r\nMr. Bryce, who happily describes the succession of events in those\r\ncrowded times as forming one of the most intricate chapters of American\r\nhistory. No apology is offered, therefore, for considering in this essay\r\nso important and so long-neglected a theme as the rise of the political\r\nrevolution that occurred before reunion was finally accomplished._\r\n\r\n_On the general subject several excellent monographs have recently\r\nappeared; these, however, are nearly all employed in discussing the\r\nsecond stage in the process of restoration, and, except incidentally,\r\nanticipate scarcely anything of value in the present work, which, so far\r\nat least as concerns any logical exposition, conducts the reader over\r\nuntraveled ground. As the introduction indicates with sufficient\r\naccuracy both the scope and method of this study, nothing is required\r\nhere beyond a concise statement of the author’s obligations._\r\n\r\n_Like many other students of American institutions, the writer\r\ncheerfully acknowledges his indebtedness to the works of Brownson, Hurd\r\nand Jameson, and, by transferring some of their opinions to his book,\r\nhas shown a practical appreciation of their researches. In addition to\r\nthese obligations, in which the author is not singular, he profited for\r\nfour years by the lectures of Dr. Francis N. Thorpe, his professor in\r\nconstitutional history. Except in a very few instances, where the name\r\nof an author was forgotten, credit for both suggestions and material is\r\nuniformly given in the references and footnotes._\r\n\r\n_For the selection, arrangement, and treatment of topics the author\r\nalone is responsible; he desires, however, to take this opportunity of\r\nacknowledging generous assistance received from three intimate friends:\r\nhis colleague, Dr. Charles P. Henry, found time in the midst of arduous\r\nliterary engagements to read the whole of the manuscript and to make\r\nmany valuable suggestions, especially in matters of style and diction;\r\nthe book is not less fortunate in having been critically read by Thomas\r\nJ. Meagher, Esq., whose extensive and accurate knowledge of public as\r\nwell as private law contributed to a more clear and scientific statement\r\nof many of the constitutional questions discussed; the technical skill\r\nand the superior intelligence of Mr. George M. Schell were of\r\nconsiderable assistance to the author in correcting the proofs of the\r\nentire book. Nor must he omit to record his appreciation of the courtesy\r\nof Mr. L. E. Hewitt, the efficient librarian of the Philadelphia Law\r\nAssociation. Finally the writer gratefully acknowledges his chief\r\nobligation to the scholarship of his former teacher, Dr. John Bach\r\nMcMaster, who kindly interrupted the progress of his great historical\r\nwork long enough to read a considerable portion of this essay. Indeed,\r\nit was the encouragement of that eminent author which first suggested\r\nthe publication of these pages._\r\n\r\n_Before concluding his remarks the writer wishes to disclaim any\r\nsympathy with the progressive school of historical criticism, which\r\nderides the Constitution as a thing of the past and learnedly\r\ncharacterizes all veneration for its authority as the worship of a\r\nfetich. This book will have attained one of its principal purposes if,\r\nin the language of a distinguished surviving statesman of the war\r\nperiod, it will teach “the constant and ever-important lesson that the\r\nConstitution is always a more reliable guide for the legislator than\r\nthose fierce passions which war never fails to excite.”_\r\n\r\n =Philadelphia=, September 14, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSo closely blended with the essential principles of our federal system\r\nof government were the causes of the Civil War that a clear\r\nunderstanding of its results appears to require some account of the\r\norigin, the independence and the permanent union of these States. Upon\r\nthe eventful years between the Treaty of Paris and the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, crowded as they are with work of note, one could linger\r\nwith pleasure; this epoch, however, has already engaged the pens of so\r\nmany writers, eminent as well as obscure, that a re-study of the\r\nblunders of England’s ministers and the revolt of her distant colonies\r\nmight justly be regarded as a piece of presumption.\r\n\r\nNor does it seem necessary to recite the familiar achievements of the\r\nsucceeding period; for, perhaps, the portion of American history most\r\nattractive to the general reader is included between the 4th of July,\r\n1776, and the 4th of March, 1789. To these years belong the most\r\nconspicuous services of that giant race of leaders whose swords relieved\r\na gallant people from oppression and whose wisdom established a form of\r\ngovernment not, indeed, in universal harmony with popular prejudice, but\r\nadmirably designed for the popular welfare.\r\n\r\nIt was at the outset of what may properly be styled the national era\r\nthat there appeared the remarkable group of statesmen who guided the\r\ninfant Republic on its dim and perilous way. On their broad experience\r\ngleamed a vision of the future touching all their work with elements of\r\nimmortality. By them was skillfully established a system of revenue and\r\nof finance adequate to all the exigencies of the time, and a foreign\r\npolicy inaugurated which for generations together preserved unbroken\r\nharmony with the world outside. They doubled by wise and peaceful\r\nacquisition the area of that Union whose independence had been wrested\r\nfrom George the Third, and with no less wisdom prescribed the procedure\r\nand defined the jurisdiction of Federal courts.\r\n\r\nThe forty years following March 4, 1789, form an epoch with\r\ncharacteristics of its own. This was the period of Virginian ascendency,\r\nthe Adamses alone breaking the line of illustrious Presidents furnished\r\nby the Old Dominion. Introduced by an experiment in government which\r\naroused the slumbering energies of the nation, its conclusion was marked\r\nby the disappearance from political life of the splendid ideals and rich\r\ntraditions of the Fathers.\r\n\r\nThe election of General Jackson coincides with the beginning of a new\r\nphase in American political and industrial development. It was not that\r\nthe fame of a splendid military record had raised its possessor to an\r\noffice for which long experience in governmental affairs had hitherto\r\nbeen thought indispensable, or that the selection of Presidents had\r\npassed from an intellectual few to the control of a much more numerous\r\nclass who were willing to bestow on politics the attention and energy\r\nrequisite for success in trade; but it was about this time that the\r\nimperious power of slavery entered upon its career of aggression.\r\nPhilosophic statesmen of a previous epoch had ardently hoped that the\r\ninstitution would be permitted quietly to disappear; indeed, the\r\ngreatest among them, though divided upon a multitude of political and\r\neconomic questions, agreed in encouraging every movement designed for\r\nits extinction. These humane efforts, however, were not destined to win\r\nimmediate success, and even with the coöperation of the General\r\nGovernment served only to demonstrate the difficulty of such an\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAfter 1820 all the dangers which menaced the integrity of the Union\r\nwere, with one notable exception, traceable to this cause. When Mr.\r\nLincoln in his discussions with Senator Douglas declared that it was the\r\nsole cause of all the troubles which had disturbed the nation, he meant,\r\nprobably, to assert no more than that in his own time it had been the\r\nmost conspicuous one.\r\n\r\nLong before slavery became a subject of embittered controversy the\r\ndoctrine of State Rights had agitated the country. As early as the\r\nsummer of 1793 it had found in Justice Iredell an able advocate on the\r\nbench of the United States Supreme Court. For party purposes it was\r\nadopted five years later by Madison and Jefferson in the celebrated\r\nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions, and during the second war with Great\r\nBritain these statesmen were startled to find New England Federalism\r\nvindicating its unpatriotic, if not treacherous, conduct in the exact\r\nlanguage which they had invented to embarrass a former administration.\r\nWith this instrument, too, Calhoun in 1832 shook the foundations of the\r\nUnion. Both Northern and Southern statesmen of that generation, however,\r\npushed the principle of State sovereignty as far only as their immediate\r\nobject seemed to require.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular mistake to suppose that beyond the limits of the South\r\nthis erroneous doctrine found little favor in the minds of men; for on\r\nthe eve of the War of 1812 a Governor of conservative Pennsylvania had\r\narmed her citizen-soldiers against Federal power.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious Marshall could relate how, before the highest tribunal\r\nin the land, its champions with unwearied zeal renewed the battle for a\r\nhopeless cause. The eloquent voice of Webster hushed for a time the\r\nfretful agitation of South Carolina statesmen, and his genius fixed in\r\nimperishable literary form that interpretation of the Constitution which\r\ncalled forth the abundant resources of both the Nation and the States.\r\nIn his conquering words lived those elevated thoughts that in future\r\nyears sustained the defenders of the Republic.\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson, for the energy and promptness by which he defeated\r\nthe projects of the Nullifiers, has been justly eulogized; but, when the\r\nexcitement of the hour had passed away, the calmer judgment of even his\r\nadmirers perceived that victory inclined rather to the side of Calhoun.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of the abstract question of State sovereignty might,\r\nprobably, have long continued without endangering the Union had the\r\nprinciple not been invoked to defend the institution of human servitude;\r\nyoked to that powerful interest it was inevitable that both should go\r\ndown together in undistinguishable ruin.\r\n\r\nFrom the Protean fount of slavery flowed an hundred various streams\r\ncoloring almost every important question in the tide of events. In the\r\ngeneration between the election of General Jackson and the inauguration\r\nof Mr. Lincoln its defeats were few, its triumphs numerous and\r\nimportant. Prosperity revealed its weaknesses and encouraged its\r\nexperiments. The fruits of its greatest victory, the dismemberment of\r\nMexico, revived those stormy scenes which thirty years before had for\r\nthe first time been witnessed in an American legislative hall.\r\nDissolution of the Union was once more threatened, and again averted by\r\nthe genius and patriotism of the venerable triumvirate, who scarce\r\noutlived their noble work; but the compromise from which Clay, Calhoun\r\nand Webster expected a restoration of former tranquillity contained\r\nwithin itself the very seed-plot of even graver troubles.\r\n\r\nAfter 1850 the attachment of Southern men to their industrial system was\r\nplayed upon by ambitious politicians more and more, until the final\r\noverthrow of themselves and the government which they sought to\r\nestablish for its preservation. It could be shown how before that time\r\none war was prolonged for the protection, and another undertaken chiefly\r\nfor the extension, of that aggressive institution; how its existence was\r\nsupposed to require Federal interference with the mails and an\r\nabridgment of even the ancient right of petition. Every power of the\r\nnational Government and all the resources of the cotton States had been\r\nemployed for its advantage.\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court was the last agent within the Union by\r\nwhich its advocates sought to dignify and perpetuate human servitude,\r\nand so successful were their efforts that an enlightened and humane\r\nChief Justice was but little misrepresented in language or in sentiment\r\nwhen political opponents ascribed to him the doctrine that “the negro\r\nhas no rights which the white man is bound to respect.”\r\n\r\nThe moral progress of the United States during the last forty years\r\nfinds, probably, in no single event a better illustration than the\r\nchange in public opinion upon the interesting question of human rights.\r\nWhen the majority opinion was delivered in the Dred Scott case it\r\nexcited among members of the dominant political party but little\r\nsurprise. The shock which a judicial utterance of such sentiments would\r\ngive in our time to the ethical notions of the American people affords\r\nat once both a measure of the advance that has been made in the interval\r\nand an undoubted proof that progress has not been, as is commonly\r\nsupposed, exclusively or even mainly along material lines. It is\r\nsingular, too, that the first serious attempt of the Federal Supreme\r\nCourt to set at rest a dangerous political question should have been\r\nfollowed by effects of so alarming a tendency.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to relate in these pages the origin or the fate of\r\nthose compromises designed to avoid the inevitable conflict already in\r\nthe closing months of President Buchanan’s administration casting\r\nominous shadows in the pathway of the nation, nor to describe the\r\nuncertain policy of the General Government or attempt to determine the\r\nmeasure of its responsibility for the fearful rebellion which that\r\nhesitation encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe skill and industry of a multitude of laborers have gathered from the\r\nfield of conflict a harvest as bountiful as the result was satisfactory.\r\nWe have general histories and bird’s-eye views, military accounts and\r\nnaval accounts of the Civil War; memoirs and diaries, by actors more or\r\nless prominent in the events which they describe, and narratives of\r\nbattles and of sieges. In this varied and ample field even a belated\r\nworker might hope to glean something of value; but this study, whatever\r\nit may discuss incidentally, will be chiefly concerned with the subject\r\nof Reconstruction, a phase of our political and constitutional\r\ndevelopment which, though beginning during the progress, lies mainly\r\nbeyond the close of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe organization into a separate government of the late Confederate\r\nStates, with their resolute struggle for independence, is the chief\r\nevent in the extraordinary career of this favored nation. The story of\r\ntheir submission to Federal power and the return to their former places\r\nin the Union is not inferior either in interest or instruction to any\r\npolitical event recorded in history. This return is what is commonly\r\nknown as Reconstruction. Though the term on its introduction into\r\npolitical discussion was frequently objected to as inaccurate, it has\r\nbeen generally adopted in the writings of publicists as well as in\r\npopular speech. The word “restoration,” which was at first preferred,\r\nwas soon found to be inexact; for while former relations were resumed by\r\nthe erring States, they came back, one with diminished territorial\r\nextent and all with domestic rights greatly abridged. They had, in fact,\r\nbeen _reconstructed_. It is true that even the loyal States did not\r\nemerge unscathed from this political revolution. In the South, however,\r\nthe established industrial system had been swept completely away.\r\n\r\nThe theme falls naturally under two heads, Presidential Reconstruction\r\nand Congressional Reconstruction. An account of the former, which\r\nextended from the summer of 1861 to the autumn of 1865, occupies the\r\nwhole of this volume. Any adequate treatment of the latter, including as\r\nit does the eventful period from the meeting of Congress in December,\r\n1865, to the withdrawal of Federal forces from the South in 1877, will\r\nrequire a narrative somewhat more ample.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous landmarks of Reconstruction require no extraordinary\r\ntalent to recognize and locate. It is the unfamiliar region between that\r\nis difficult accurately to map out. The failure hitherto to present in a\r\nsingle view the striking features of these neglected parts is chiefly\r\nresponsible for the fact that Reconstruction remains one of the most\r\nobscure parts of our history. A candid and comprehensive account of the\r\npolitical events of the time appears to divest the subject of much of\r\nthe difficulty commonly supposed to attend its investigation. From a\r\nsufficient body of essential facts the step to an understanding and\r\nexposition of every principle of moment is comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nThough the general design of this volume will be suggested to the\r\nstudent of American history by an inspection of its principal\r\nsubdivisions, it may not be unnecessary for the benefit of the general\r\nreader to add a brief outline of the plan that has been adopted.\r\n\r\nChapter I. relates the most important political events in the history of\r\nTennessee from its attempted secession to the restoration, in March,\r\n1865, of a civil government loyal to the United States. Military\r\nmovements in that Commonwealth have been noticed only so far as to\r\nrender intelligible the successive steps by which that reorganization\r\nwas accomplished.\r\n\r\nChapters II. and III. bring the affairs of Louisiana and Arkansas,\r\nrespectively, down to about the same time. Events in those States have\r\nbeen treated, so far as conditions permitted, in the same manner as in\r\nthe case of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nChapter IV. is concerned with the secession, restoration and\r\ndismemberment of Virginia. The formation out of a portion of that\r\nCommonwealth of the new State of West Virginia, both because of the\r\ngrave constitutional question which arose on a division of the parent\r\nState and the intrinsic interest of the subject, has been considered\r\nwith some degree of minuteness.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter V., which discusses anti-slavery legislation, it will appear\r\nhow Mr. Lincoln, though never an Abolitionist or even a radical\r\nRepublican, became by pressure of military necessity an instrument in\r\nthe hands of God to destroy an institution opposed by a long line of\r\nAmerican statesmen and condemned by the light of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding chapter considers the various theories and plans of\r\nrestoration presented during the progress of the war. The rise of the\r\nCongressional plan, which ultimately prevailed, is treated separately in\r\nChapter VII. Only the first stage of its development, however, falls\r\nwithin the limits of this inquiry, which ends with the meeting of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress in December, 1865.\r\n\r\nChapters VIII., IX. and X. trace the progress of the controversy between\r\nthe Legislative and the Executive branches of Government. The\r\nculmination of this difference, however, in the impeachment and trial of\r\nPresident Johnson is a phase of Congressional Reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe topics treated in the eleventh chapter, having frequently employed\r\nthe pens of able and popular writers on the Rebellion, are considered in\r\nthis study merely for the purpose of making it complete in itself; hence\r\nthat section is little more than an epitome of what has already been\r\nsaid on those subjects.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth and last chapter brings every part of the narrative up to\r\nDecember 4, 1865. To clearly comprehend the arduous task that confronted\r\nPresident Johnson this section includes a rapid survey of the wreck of\r\nthe Confederate States. The principal part, however, is reserved for an\r\naccount of the conventions assembled under his authority, the method of\r\ninstituting loyal governments and the spirit and tendency of Southern\r\nlegislation relative to freedmen. An examination of the Presidential\r\nplan of Reconstruction completes the volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Lincoln’s Plan of Reconstruction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n                               TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the celebrated joint debates with Senator Douglas in 1858, the\r\nCooper Union and other addresses, marked Mr. Lincoln, in the new\r\npolitical party just rising to power, as the intellectual peer of able\r\nand trusted leaders like Sumner, Chase and Seward, his conservative\r\nopinions on the subject of slavery made his nomination by the Chicago\r\nConvention more acceptable to delegates from the border States. Though\r\nhis competitors received, in the memorable contest which followed,\r\nalmost a million votes in excess of the number cast for Mr. Lincoln and\r\nhis associate, the fierce conflict among fragments of the Democratic\r\nparty resulted, as is well known, in the choice of a decided majority of\r\nRepublican electors.[1] This rather unexpected defeat of a political\r\norganization that had lost but two Presidential contests since its first\r\nsuccess under Jefferson afforded Southern leaders a pretext for urging a\r\ndismemberment of the Union. Indeed, there is evidence that the more\r\nimpetuous among them had, four years earlier, seriously determined, in\r\ncase of Fremont’s election, upon a similar course.[2] Thus the present\r\nevent, so far from being an universal disappointment to members of the\r\ndefeated party, had been ardently hoped for by many.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a minority party, and not at first possessing the entire\r\nconfidence of even that minority, Mr. Lincoln, unable to divine the\r\nfuture, was compelled in dealing with the insurrection to proceed with\r\nthe utmost caution. Washington himself, in organizing the Federal\r\nGovernment, had a task of less magnitude, and the renown of his military\r\nachievements silenced for a time even the boldest in opposition.\r\nPresident Lincoln’s victories, gained on a different field, gave no such\r\nunquestioned authority to his name. This peculiar situation forced him\r\nto adopt for the guidance of his administration a policy not altogether\r\nfree from embarrassment to both himself and his successor. His purpose\r\nat that time appears to have been to meet the demands of the moment by\r\nthe contrivances of the moment. Whether a different course would have\r\nbeen rewarded by earlier or by more complete success is a hazardous\r\nsubject for speculation. If his theory of our national existence be\r\nliable to the multitude of objections which have grown up in these\r\nfruitful times of peace, no other has been suggested that is free from\r\ncriticism. His political doctrine, too, had the advantage of always\r\nrecommending measures scarcely less distinguished for enlarged views\r\nthan those enlightened convictions which characterize his first\r\ninaugural address. Whatever may be concluded of its merits, the theory\r\nembraced at the outset exerted on many administrative acts of President\r\nLincoln an influence that continued to be felt during his entire\r\nexecutive career; and without remembering this fact we shall not easily\r\ncomprehend either the extent of his “Border Policy,” as the plan of\r\ncompensated emancipation is often called, or his undoubted concern for\r\npersecuted Union men in the seceded States.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of loyal citizens in East Tennessee had early enlisted\r\nthe President’s sympathies, and almost from the commencement of\r\nhostilities measures for their relief formed in his mind part of the\r\nplan of operations by the army under General Buell. Writing, January 6,\r\n1862, to that commander he gives reasons for suggesting the occupation\r\nof some point there rather than Nashville, and adds: “But my distress is\r\nthat our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to\r\ndespair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the\r\nsake of personal protection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we\r\nhave in the South.”[3] The cause of these outrages may be briefly\r\nexplained in a digression.\r\n\r\nIn no part of the late Confederate States was the slave interest more\r\nfeeble than in the thirty counties comprising East Tennessee.[4] That\r\nportion of the State contained in 1860 slightly over 300,000\r\ninhabitants,[5] of whom only about one tenth were slaves, while in many\r\ncounties they formed no more than one in seventeen of the population.\r\nHere and there, indeed, were persons of wealth some of whom owned a few\r\nnegroes. But though a majority of the people looked upon domestic\r\nslavery as something foreign to their social life, they had no strong\r\nphilanthropic impulse to oppose it. While quite willing to allow their\r\ncountrymen elsewhere to keep bondmen at pleasure, they did not regard it\r\nany concern of theirs to assist either in extending or perpetuating\r\nhuman servitude. If the existence of the Union or of slavery was the\r\nissue, they would have hesitated little in deciding which should perish.\r\nThough, as we shall presently see, they were as intolerant of the\r\nRepublican party as any community in the South, they were devotedly\r\nattached to the Union. The fact is partly explained by the industrial\r\nbasis of society in this favored region.\r\n\r\nCut off from Middle Tennessee by lofty ranges of the Cumberland, and\r\nfrom North Carolina by the Great Smoky, the Black and the Stone\r\nmountains, this extensive district is traversed in its entire length by\r\nthe Tennessee and its chief tributaries, the Clinch and the Holston; as\r\nthe great river flows down to Alabama it receives, before turning west\r\nand north to join the Ohio, the waters of many important and beautiful\r\nstreams, some of which, as the French Broad and Nolachucky, are\r\nassociated with deeds of note in the War for Independence; indeed, one\r\nof its crowning victories was chiefly won by settlers from the banks of\r\nthe Watauga. Other names, like Hiwassee, are familiar to readers of\r\nlater events in Tennessee history, and Chickamauga Creek was destined\r\nshortly to become more famous than any.\r\n\r\nKnoxville, in early times a capital of the State, was, in 1860, the\r\nmetropolis of East Tennessee; Chattanooga, at the southern extremity of\r\nthe valley, is separated from Bristol, on the Virginia line, by a\r\ndistance of more than two hundred and forty miles; Cleveland and\r\nGreenville were towns of less importance. The absence of large cities\r\nmakes it evident that manufacturing had not yet begun to attract serious\r\nattention. Like early settlers everywhere in America, the pioneers of\r\nTennessee sought the most immediate returns from the products of the\r\nforests and fields around them. The rich mineral deposits, then either\r\nunknown or almost untouched, had not given rise to those great\r\nextractive operations which in our time have so stimulated the\r\ncommercial life of East Tennessee. Vast cotton plantations, worked by\r\nmultitudes of slaves, like those in the western portion of the State,\r\nhad no existence in these mountain valleys, though occasionally small\r\n“patches” were cultivated for domestic use.\r\n\r\nCitizens of West Tennessee would naturally place upon the Federal\r\nConstitution an interested construction; their industries, they\r\nbelieved, required such an interpretation of that instrument as would\r\nplace the institution of slavery beyond the reach of Congressional\r\ninterference. While the people of East Tennessee, too, believed in the\r\nseveral sovereignty of the States, the question of slavery did not touch\r\nthem so nearly. Indifferent to the subject themselves, they had little\r\nsympathy with those who had determined to break up the Union from a mere\r\nsuspicion that their interests were menaced by the success of a new\r\npolitical party. But to ascribe to the want of interested motives their\r\nindifference to the great disturbing question of the time would be to\r\nassign but one and that, perhaps, not the chief cause.\r\n\r\nExcept on its northern and southern boundaries this delightful region is\r\npractically isolated from several adjacent States as well as from the\r\nremainder of Tennessee. It was in this by-place of nature and amidst\r\nsuch a population that _The Manumission Intelligencer_, a weekly\r\nnewspaper, made its appearance in 1819.[6] It was followed the next year\r\nby _The Emancipator_ of Elijah Embree, a Pennsylvania Quaker; this in\r\nturn was soon succeeded by a more celebrated publication, _The Genius of\r\nUniversal Emancipation_, conducted by Benjamin Lundy. While these\r\npublications served to perpetuate and to extend, they did not create the\r\nsentiment of which they became exponents, for, several years before\r\ntheir appearance, an anti-slavery society flourished in Jefferson\r\nCounty. Its existence is noticed as early as 1814.[7] This anti-slavery\r\nfeeling was part of the philosophic movement encouraged by nearly all\r\nSouthern as well as Northern statesmen before the inauguration of\r\nGeneral Jackson. A new industrial era, beginning about that time, put an\r\nend to the abolition societies in the South; and though Lundy’s paper\r\nwas discontinued in Tennessee after 1824, events of frequent occurrence\r\nsustained the anti-slavery sentiments of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee valley was a natural thoroughfare from Virginia to the\r\nsouth-west, and when slaves were purchased on the Potomac they were\r\nchained together, to prevent escape, and in that condition driven to the\r\nhomes of their new masters.[8] The plaintive songs of captives as they\r\nwere marched in lines along the valley highways often caused the free\r\nmountaineer to pause in his labors and reflect on what was passing\r\nbefore his eyes. He “saw slavery in its bitterness and without\r\ndisguise.” The remembrance of such spectacles was apt to strengthen in\r\nhim anti-slavery feelings that had come down from Revolutionary times.\r\nBut whether Southern leaders ascribed the sentiment to an inherited\r\ntendency or regarded it as a consequence of this odious phase of the\r\ndomestic slave-trade, they did not think it beneath the dignity of\r\nattention; for it was, doubtless, to create a sympathy for their\r\ninstitution that a “Southern Commercial Convention” was held at\r\nKnoxville in 1857. It was too late, however, to root out the convictions\r\nof two generations; the counsels of the wise were soon to be confounded\r\nand the fretful agitation of leaders soon to be hushed in the tempest of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nNo Republican electoral ticket was presented in the great political\r\nbattle of 1860 for the suffrage of Tennessee voters, and had any citizen\r\nopenly advocated the election of Mr. Lincoln he would have had to endure\r\ninsult or injury, or to abandon his home. This explains why the\r\nsuccessful candidates received no vote in all the State. As “Parson”\r\nBrownlow, selecting extreme abolition and secession types,\r\ncharacteristically expressed it, his people were equally opposed to the\r\nWilliam L. Garrisons and the William L. Yanceys of politics.[9] In this\r\nsituation the supporters of Bell, Breckenridge and Douglas were left to\r\ncontend for victory among themselves. Addresses of the time reveal not\r\nonly the emotions of individual speakers, but the excited state of\r\npublic opinion. The attitude of Constitutional Union men was vigorously\r\nstated in a debate at Knoxville by Nathaniel G. Taylor, an elector on\r\nthe Bell and Everett ticket. “The people of East Tennessee,” said the\r\norator, “are determined to maintain the Union by force of arms against\r\nany movement from the South throughout their region of country to assail\r\nthe government at Washington with violence, and that the secessionists\r\nof the cotton States in attempting to carry out their nefarious design\r\nto destroy the Republic would have to march over his dead body and the\r\ndead bodies of thousands of East Tennessee mountaineers slain in\r\nbattle.”[10]\r\n\r\nWhen Yancey came up from Alabama to “precipitate” this section into\r\nrebellion the intrepid Brownlow made a similar reply.[11] The energy or\r\nthe elegance of such utterances may be questioned, but the deeds of\r\nloyal Tennesseeans during eventful years to follow are evidence alike of\r\nthe sincerity of the speakers and their insight into the temper of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nExcept Tennessee, all the States that attempted secession did so by\r\nmeans of revolutionary bodies styled conventions; this description of\r\nthem is justified both by the general powers of administration and\r\ngovernment which they assumed and by the fact that the legislatures in\r\nconvoking them transcended their authority, the members of every State\r\nlegislature being “bound by oath or affirmation to support” the Federal\r\nConstitution, which forms a part of the fundamental law of each\r\ncommonwealth. Though the Legislature of Tennessee, following the example\r\nof law-making bodies in other disloyal States, passed a “Convention\r\nBill,” it was promptly defeated by a majority of 13,204 in a total vote\r\nof more than 120,000. Notwithstanding the constitutional prohibition\r\nthat “no State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or\r\nconfederation,”[12] the Legislature on May 1 authorized Governor Harris\r\nto appoint commissioners to form a military league with the Confederate\r\nStates. Six days later the relations entered into by these agents were\r\nratified in a secret session, the State government thereby turning over\r\ntemporarily to the President of the Confederacy its entire military\r\nforce. These matters disposed of, the plans of disunionists were\r\ncompleted by the passage on the same day of a declaration of\r\nindependence and an ordinance dissolving all Federal relations between\r\nTennessee and the United States. Though this measure was to be voted\r\nupon a month later, the Legislature, as if anticipating the result,\r\nadopted and ratified the Confederate constitution. What was so ardently\r\ndesired by secessionists was finally accomplished, and on June 24 the\r\nGovernor declared his State out of the Union, the vote being 104,019\r\nfor, and 47,238 against, separation.[13] The Tennessee Legislature did\r\nnot assume the functions of a secession convention till after the\r\ncommencement of hostilities; but from that date the forms of law ceased\r\nto be seriously regarded. While the disunion party scored a present\r\ntriumph, loyalist leaders like Horace Maynard, Thomas A. R. Nelson and\r\nAndrew Johnson, at the imminent risk of injury or even of death, were\r\nspeaking and working actively against the spirit of secession. The\r\nstrong Union feeling thus excited resulted ultimately in local\r\ninsurrections and in the meeting, June 17, of a convention at\r\nGreeneville in which a remonstrance was adopted and a committee\r\nappointed to petition the Legislature for the separation of East\r\nTennessee and such counties of Middle Tennessee as were willing to\r\ncoöperate in the formation of a new commonwealth. But the presence there\r\nduring the following years of veteran Confederate armies prevented Union\r\nmen from organizing a separate government, and saved the State from the\r\nfate of Virginia. All who were known to have had a connection, or who\r\nwere suspected of sympathy, with this movement were especially obnoxious\r\nto the secession party, and at the hands of soldiers were subjected to\r\nmany indignities. In various ways the feeling of opposition to the\r\nConfederacy was intensified, and it was not long before measures of\r\nretaliation were considered. Union people were quick to perceive the\r\nadvantage which the South derived from the use of railways within the\r\nState, and, in expectation of assistance from Federal forces in\r\nKentucky, five railroad bridges were burned. East Tennesseeans, however,\r\nwere destined to be sorely disappointed in the matter of aid from the\r\nUnion army; and, without effective organization or arms, were easily\r\ncaptured or dispersed. Of the former, many were sent as prisoners of war\r\nto Alabama, hundreds were crowded into loathsome jails in the State and\r\nothers hanged, with circumstances of deliberate cruelty, near the scenes\r\nof their alleged crimes.\r\n\r\nThese were among the outrages to which Mr. Lincoln referred in his\r\nletter to the Federal commander. By Horace Maynard a Representative, and\r\nAndrew Johnson a Senator, in Congress the President was kept very\r\naccurately informed of events in the State and often importuned to\r\nrelieve their constituents. This he constantly endeavored to do, but his\r\nintentions were effectually defeated by the inactivity of General Buell,\r\nwho cherished other plans for destroying his antagonist. More than two\r\nyears were to elapse, from the time President Lincoln urged his policy,\r\nbefore Tennesseeans received any aid from Federal armies; long before\r\nthat time they had been ruthlessly punished for their patriotism, and\r\nthen their oppressors were chastised by the hand of an abler warrior\r\nthan General Buell.\r\n\r\nWithin a month from the date of President Lincoln’s letter of January 6\r\nGeneral Grant had possession of Fort Henry and, ten days later, February\r\n16, received the surrender of Fort Donelson. Nashville, becoming unsafe,\r\nwas evacuated on February 23, 1862; the State appeared for the first\r\ntime to be slipping from the grasp of the Confederacy, and a question,\r\nhitherto more or less academic, presented itself for practical\r\nsettlement. In the territory from which hostile armies were reluctantly\r\nretiring there would be involved a great derangement in the\r\nadministration of local civil law from the necessary displacement there\r\nof all officials heretofore acting in obedience to the Confederate\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBy other Union victories in the Spring of 1862 the same situation\r\nconfronted the Federal Government in Arkansas, in North Carolina and in\r\nLouisiana. Indeed, this identical question arose as early as 1861 in\r\nVirginia and Missouri, but in the former the rebel government was\r\nabrogated by a delegate convention that restored a loyal government from\r\nwhich in due time sprang the separate State of West Virginia. In\r\nMissouri a lawfully chosen convention appointed a provisional government\r\nin sympathy with the Union. This subject, however, will be more\r\nconveniently discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen General Johnston received tidings of the disaster at Donelson he\r\nretired with his army to Murfreesboro, leaving Nashville, which he was\r\nunable to protect, a scene of panic and dismay, first advising Governor\r\nHarris to secure the public archives and convoke the Legislature\r\nelsewhere. It was in these circumstances that President Lincoln, on the\r\nsame day, February 23, nominated, and the Senate, March 5, 1862,\r\nconfirmed, Andrew Johnson as military governor of Tennessee with the\r\nrank of brigadier-general. As the commission antedates the action of the\r\nSenate by two days the President, no doubt, consulted the leaders of\r\nthat body relative to the contemplated nomination, and received\r\nassurance of its favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nNothing in any way connected with the appointment of Senator Johnson,\r\nwho was destined to act so conspicuous a part in the important and\r\ndifficult work of reconstruction, can fail to be of interest, and any\r\naccount of the execution of his office would be incomplete without some\r\nobservations on the nature of his commission of which the following is a\r\ncopy:\r\n\r\n                                    =War Department=, _March 3, 1862_.\r\n\r\n  _To the_ =Hon. Andrew Johnson=:\r\n\r\n  =Sir=: You are hereby appointed military governor of the State of\r\n  Tennessee, with authority to exercise and perform, within the limits\r\n  of that State, all and singular the powers, duties, and functions\r\n  pertaining to the office of military governor, including the power\r\n  to establish all necessary offices, tribunals, etc.\r\n\r\n                                           =Edwin M. Stanton=,\r\n                                               _Secretary of War_.[14]\r\n\r\nQuoting the essential part of this document a recent coöperative work\r\nhas this comment: “The office [that of military governor] was new to the\r\nlaws and history of the State and country. Its powers and duties were\r\nlimited only by the will of one man, the occupant.”[15] From the\r\ncommission itself we derive our prime conception of both the nature of\r\nthe office and the functions which it comprehended. The authority of the\r\nincumbent extended to the exercise, within the limits of Tennessee, of\r\nall “the powers, duties, and functions pertaining to the office of\r\nmilitary governor.” Nothing in this language implies that the office was\r\nof recent creation. Nor is its nature to be discovered by a perusal of\r\nthe supplemental authority contained in the President’s letter of\r\nSeptember 19, 1863, to Governor Johnson, for the official conduct of the\r\nlatter on his arrival in Nashville can not be seriously thought to have\r\nbeen influenced by instructions received nineteen months later. It is\r\nperfectly true, as Mr. Ira P. Jones, author of the chapter on\r\nReconstruction in Tennessee, asserts, that the office of military\r\ngovernor had never been exercised within that State; but it is not a\r\nfact that it was new to the laws and history of the “country,” if by\r\nthis indefinite expression he means the United States. During the war\r\nwith Mexico the American people had been made familiar with military\r\ncommissions and with military governors. Secretary Marcy prepared, June\r\n3, 1846, for General Stephen W. Kearny the following instructions:\r\n“Should you conquer and take possession of New Mexico and Upper\r\nCalifornia, or considerable places in either, you will establish\r\ntemporary civil governments therein.”[16] To this direction general\r\nrules of conduct were added, and the letter authorized the assurance\r\nthat “It is the wish and design of the United States to provide for them\r\n[the people of New Mexico] a free government with the least possible\r\ndelay, similar to that which exists in our Territories.” By virtue of\r\nthis authority General Kearny appointed Charles Bent governor of New\r\nMexico. Mr. Polk in his Message of July 6, 1848, to Congress maintained\r\nthat with the termination of war his power to establish temporary civil\r\ngovernments over New Mexico and California had ceased; the legality of\r\ntheir previous existence he justified by the law of nations. By cession\r\nto the United States, the government of Mexico no longer pretended to\r\nany control over them.[17] President Polk, differing from other leaders\r\nof his party, held that “until Congress shall act, the inhabitants will\r\nbe without any organized government.”[18] But Congress, notwithstanding\r\nurgent appeals of the Executive, moved very deliberately in the matter\r\nof abolishing the office of military governor. In May, 1847, Colonel\r\nRichard B. Mason assumed the office of Governor and commander-in-chief\r\nof the United States forces in California. Two months after ratification\r\nof the treaty with Mexico he received notice of the fact, but no\r\nintimation that the civil government instituted by the President was\r\ndiscontinued. Without other instructions than an order to extend over\r\nCalifornia “the revenue laws and tariff of the United States” he, as\r\nwell as his successor, General Riley, continued the existing government.\r\n\r\nAfter affirming the legality of its institution the United States\r\nSupreme Court (Cross _vs._ Harrison, p. 193, 16 Howard) says that the\r\nexisting government did not cease as a consequence of the restoration of\r\npeace; the President might have dissolved it, but he did not do so.\r\nCongress could have put an end to it, but that was not done. “The right\r\ninference from the inaction of both is, that it was meant to be\r\ncontinued until it had been legislatively changed.” In fact it was so\r\ncontinued until the people in convention formed a government,\r\nsubsequently recognized by Congress, when California was admitted during\r\nthe autumn of 1850 as a State.\r\n\r\nThe authority, then, of both political departments, as well as the more\r\ndeliberate opinion of the judicial branch, of the General Government had\r\nestablished a precedent with which Mr. Lincoln was thoroughly familiar;\r\nfor, by a singular coincidence, both he and Mr. Johnson were serving\r\ntogether in the Thirtieth Congress, which began its first session in\r\nDecember, 1847. They participated in, or were interested spectators of,\r\nall those stirring scenes that marked the beginning of one of the last\r\nlegislative victories of slavery; so that this portion at least of\r\nAmerican history was not strange to either the President or the Senator\r\nfrom Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe question whether Tennessee was within or without the Union will be\r\nreserved for more ample discussion farther on; it is sufficient to\r\nobserve here that its territory was held by an adverse party and its\r\ngovernment hostile to the national authority. If the administration of\r\nColonel Mason and his successor in California was not regarded by\r\nPresident Lincoln as a sufficient basis for his action there was still\r\nleft an undoubted foundation. The appointment was deemed an element of\r\nstrength to the Union forces operating in Tennessee, and, in this view,\r\nthe act was entirely within the power of the President as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army and navy of the United States. Though its\r\nwisdom may be questioned and its results dismissed with a sneer, it was\r\nnot a novelty nor can his admirers claim for Mr. Lincoln the merit of\r\nits invention; and if in its origin the office had a bearing on the\r\nextension, its present application was not wholly unconnected with the\r\nabolition of slavery. The remaining pages of this chapter and the two\r\nsucceeding ones will be employed in tracing rapidly the operation of the\r\nsystem of military governors in those States in which it was seriously\r\nattempted to be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe movements of contending armies had already obliterated in many\r\ndistricts of Tennessee almost every trace of civil government, and when\r\nState officials hurried away to Memphis, where Governor Harris had\r\nreassembled the Legislature, they left behind them an uncontrolled mob\r\nwhich General Forrest found it necessary to charge with his cavalry to\r\nremove a portion of Confederate military stores that had not been\r\ndistributed among the poor or perished in the prevailing anarchy.[19]\r\nGeneral Grant had already, on February 22, from Fort Donelson, issued an\r\norder that “no courts will be allowed to act under State authority, but\r\nall cases coming within reach of the military arm will be adjudicated by\r\nthe authorities the Government has established within the State. Martial\r\nlaw is therefore declared to extend over West Tennessee.” The order\r\nadded, “whenever a sufficient number of citizens return to their\r\nallegiance to maintain law and order over the territory, the military\r\nrestriction here indicated will be removed.”[20] Union troops under\r\nGeneral Nelson having occupied the city on the 25th, Governor Johnson on\r\nhis arrival, March 12, 1862, from his seat in the United States Senate\r\nwas not under the necessity of employing the harsh discipline of General\r\nForrest to restore order in the deserted capital. For this part of his\r\ncareer he was, however, severely censured by political adversaries in\r\nTennessee. Detached from their historical settings, indeed, his acts\r\ncould justly be described as tyrannical. But it is precisely these\r\nfigures in the back-ground that are necessary to harmonize the whole and\r\nset before us in its proper light a truthful picture of the times. As\r\nhis professions preceded his administrative acts it is proper to\r\nintroduce this portion of the subject by quoting from a speech which he\r\ndelivered in Nashville the evening after his arrival. Five days later,\r\nMarch 18, it was printed under the style of “An Appeal to the People” of\r\nTennessee. After some general observations on the tranquil and\r\nprosperous existence of the State in the Union, and on the honors by\r\nwhich many of her sons had been distinguished, he noticed the fact that\r\nthe very leaders of secession themselves had been the recipients of\r\nFederal bounty and patronage; had taken oaths to support the\r\nConstitution and yet labored to overturn Federal authority. Entering\r\nfairly upon his theme, he continued:\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile the State Government has disappeared. The Executive has\r\n  abdicated; the Legislature has dissolved; the Judiciary is in\r\n  abeyance. The great ship of State ... has been suddenly abandoned by\r\n  its officers and mutinous crew, and left to float at the mercy of\r\n  the winds, and to be plundered by every rover upon the deep.\r\n\r\nPausing to enumerate many acts of spoliation, he resumes:\r\n\r\n  In such a lamentable crisis the Government of the United States\r\n  could not be unmindful of its high constitutional obligation to\r\n  guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of\r\n  government, an obligation which every State has a direct and\r\n  immediate interest in having observed towards every other State....\r\n  This obligation the national Government is now attempting to\r\n  discharge. I have been appointed, in the absence of the regular and\r\n  established State authorities, as Military Governor for the time\r\n  being, to preserve the public property of the State, to give the\r\n  protection of law actively enforced to her citizens, and, as\r\n  speedily as may be, to restore her government to the same condition\r\n  as before the existing rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe “regular and established State authorities,” to whom Governor\r\nJohnson refers, were, of course, none other than those officials who\r\nadministered affairs in Tennessee before the 6th of May. Of these some\r\nhad actually abandoned their offices, while others had subordinated\r\ntheir functions to a power hostile to the constitution of the State. He\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n  These offices must be filled temporarily, until the State shall be\r\n  restored so far to its accustomed quiet, that the people can\r\n  peaceably assemble at the ballot-box and select agents of their own\r\n  choice....\r\n\r\n  I shall, therefore, as early as practicable, designate for various\r\n  positions under the State and county governments, from among my\r\n  fellow-citizens, persons of probity and intelligence, and bearing\r\n  true allegiance to the Constitution and Government of the United\r\n  States, who will execute the functions of their respective offices\r\n  until their places can be filled by the action of the people. Their\r\n  authority, when their appointment shall have been made, will be\r\n  accordingly respected and observed.... Those who through the dark\r\n  and weary night of rebellion have maintained their allegiance to the\r\n  Federal Government will be honored. The erring and misguided will be\r\n  welcomed on their return. And while it may become necessary, in\r\n  vindicating the violated majesty of the law, and in reasserting its\r\n  imperial sway, to punish intelligent and conscious treason in high\r\n  places, no merely retaliatory or vindictive policy will be\r\n  adopted.[21]\r\n\r\nTo all who in private and unofficial capacity had assumed an attitude of\r\nhostility to the Government amnesty was offered for all past acts and\r\ndeclarations upon condition of yielding obedience to the supremacy of\r\nthe laws. This the Governor advised them to do. Though the “Appeal,”\r\nbrief, clear and characterized by the best temper, is a state paper of\r\ndecided merit, there were many classes still residing at the capital\r\nupon whom it made little impression. The mayor and the city council were\r\nordered to take the oath of allegiance to the United States, and on\r\ntheir refusal were imprisoned. Of the harshness of this measure it need\r\nonly be observed that the essence of government is to govern, and had\r\nthe new executive failed on this occasion to assert authority his\r\nadministration would have been wrecked at the outset. For printing\r\nseditious matter the press was placed under restraint, and within a few\r\nmonths it was found necessary to punish with unusual severity, even\r\nministers of the gospel. Clergymen, with a few exceptions, were not only\r\nhostile to the Union but actually encouraged treason from their pulpits.\r\nThese offenders Governor Johnson summoned to take the oath of allegiance\r\nor to depart from the State. They appeared before him, as commanded to,\r\nrefused compliance, but asked time for deliberation; this being granted,\r\nto the full extent desired, and still persisting in their refusal they\r\nwere placed in confinement. That they were not proceeded against with\r\nundue haste appears from an entry in a diary kept by one of Governor\r\nJohnson’s biographers which fixes the date as June 28.[22] Three months\r\nhad fully elapsed since the arrival of Mr. Johnson before the ministers\r\nwere punished for their seditious utterances. To prevent interference\r\nwith his executive functions he sometimes imprisoned judges. Other\r\nmeasures no less arbitrary have been the subject of much criticism. He\r\ndeclared that whenever a loyal citizen was maltreated five or more\r\nsympathizers with the Rebellion should be arrested and dealt with as the\r\nnature of the case appeared to require. When the property of Union men\r\nwas destroyed remuneration should be made them from the property of the\r\ndisloyal. The President seems to have approved of these reprisals.\r\nNothing more clearly shows the demoralized condition of society in\r\nTennessee than the necessity of adopting measures similar to those\r\nemployed eight centuries before by the Danish and Norman conquerors of\r\nEngland to protect their followers from private assassination by the\r\nnatives. With the natural leaders of the people, including bankers,\r\nphysicians and clergymen, encouraging treason, men of inferior\r\nintelligence and station could not be expected to remain peaceful and\r\ncontented citizens, and as preachers of sedition seldom lack numerous\r\nand sympathetic audiences the spirit of lawlessness increased. The\r\nGovernor himself was threatened with assassination in the public streets\r\nand in public meetings, but he set such menaces at defiance and on at\r\nleast one occasion addressed an assembly with his pistol on a desk\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nBut the repression of the disloyal and the restoration of order by no\r\nmeans included the whole of his duties. Functions not less important\r\nremain to be noticed. To the duties of governor and general he added\r\nthose of quartermaster and judge. Though thousands of loyal people\r\nflocked to him for arms and supplies, he proved equal to every demand,\r\nand from their number raised an army that did gallant service in the\r\nfield. He fed, clothed and sheltered the poor without regard to the army\r\nin which their natural protectors were serving. Thus redressing\r\ngrievances, relieving want and reinstating courts he worked with an\r\nintelligent and tireless energy, and when the timid prudence of General\r\nBuell would have allowed Nashville to fall into the hands of the enemy\r\n“the courage of Governor Johnson,” said a panegyrist, “stood a bulwark\r\nfor its defence.”[23] He had been scarcely three months in office when\r\nPresident Lincoln described him as “a true and valuable man,\r\nindispensable to us in Tennessee.” His zeal, his intense fidelity to the\r\nUnion, his tremendous energy and undoubted courage peculiarly fitted him\r\nto rule in turbulent times. At the outset the only agencies left for the\r\nprotection of life, liberty and property were force and arbitrary will;\r\nthese he did not hesitate to employ.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account does not notice his activity in another field. His\r\nultimate object, the establishment of civil authority throughout\r\nTennessee, was kept constantly in view. To prepare for this event he\r\naddressed in May, 1862, large assemblies at Nashville and Murfreesboro,\r\nand in June at Columbia and Shelbyville.[24] This work, however, was\r\nbrought suddenly to an end later in the summer by General Bragg’s raid\r\ninto Kentucky.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been related it appears, and the opinion will grow\r\nstronger with the progress of this narrative, that in appointing a\r\nmilitary governor of Tennessee President Lincoln intended no more than\r\nto revive an office already known to the people of the United States;\r\nand though Mr. Johnson was expected ultimately to reinaugurate a loyal\r\ngovernment throughout the State, his office was regarded primarily as an\r\ninexpensive means of holding territory wrested from, and assisting in\r\nmilitary operations against, an enemy. Indeed, it is only in this view\r\nthat his administration of the office can be regarded as a success, and\r\nthat it was so considered in the North his nomination on the ticket with\r\nMr. Lincoln is undoubted proof.\r\n\r\nBesides several colored regiments, the records for 1863 show that 25,000\r\nTennesseeans were then serving in the Union army, and every succeeding\r\nmonth increased their number.[25] That the political advantage to be\r\ngained by restoring a loyal government was not the only or even the\r\nprincipal purpose of the President may be fairly inferred from the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n  I am told you have at least thought of raising a negro military\r\n  force. In my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so much\r\n  as some man of your ability and position to go to this work. When I\r\n  speak of your position, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave\r\n  state and himself a slaveholder. The colored population is the great\r\n  available and yet un-availed of force for restoring the Union. The\r\n  bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers upon the banks\r\n  of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once; and who doubts\r\n  that we can present that sight if we but take hold in earnest? If\r\n  you have been thinking of it, please do not dismiss the thought.[26]\r\n\r\nBesides supporting the view of the military governors taken above, this\r\nletter also makes it evident that the pressure of events had already\r\nconvinced Mr. Lincoln that to save the Union it was necessary to possess\r\nthe untrammeled use of every national resource.\r\n\r\nAs early as June 8, 1862, the State was included in the department of\r\nGeneral Halleck, who ten days later was requested by Mr. Lincoln to\r\nreport any information of value relative thereto. The thought of a\r\nmovement into East Tennessee was in the mind of the President again on\r\nJune 30, when he informed the commander that he regarded the possession\r\nof the railroad near Cleveland fully as important as the taking of\r\nRichmond. Halleck, concurring in this opinion, telegraphed Buell that\r\n“the capture of East Tennessee should be the main object of the\r\ncampaign,” the department commander believing its occupation would put\r\nan end to guerrilla warfare both in that region and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe inactivity of General Rosecrans for six months after the battle of\r\nMurfreesboro left in the interior of the State a strong Confederate\r\nforce whose presence discouraged all but the most pronounced loyalists;\r\nthese, by means of meetings and speeches, kept a latent Union feeling\r\nalive. A convention, called by Brownlow, Maynard and others, was held at\r\nNashville, July 1, 1863. Delegates were in attendance from forty\r\ncounties; they took an oath of allegiance to the United States, and in a\r\nset of resolutions pronounced the various secession laws and ordinances\r\nvoid. Deeming it vitally important to choose a legislature, they invited\r\nGovernor Johnson to issue writs of election as soon as expedient; with\r\nthis request, however, he did not then think it prudent to comply.\r\n\r\nOther eyes were observing with interest the progress of events within\r\nthe State. General Hurlbut, writing from Memphis, August 11, 1863,\r\nrelative to the political situation in Arkansas, said he was satisfied\r\nthat Tennessee was “ready, by overwhelming majorities, to repeal the act\r\nof secession, establish a fair system of gradual emancipation, and\r\ntender herself back to the Union. I have discouraged [he said] any\r\naction on this subject here until East Tennessee is delivered. When that\r\nis done, so that her powerful voice may be heard, let Governor Johnson\r\ncall an election for members of the Legislature, and that Legislature\r\ncall a Convention, and in sixty days the work will be done.”[27]\r\n\r\nThis desirable event was not long delayed, for by brilliant though\r\nbloodless victories both Knoxville and Chattanooga early in the\r\nfollowing month were in possession of Federal armies. Then President\r\nLincoln wrote his letter of September 11, which, because of its great\r\nimportance, deserves to be reproduced in full:\r\n\r\n  All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists. You need not\r\n  to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating a\r\n  loyal State government. Not a moment should be lost. You and the\r\n  coöperating friends there can better judge of the ways and means\r\n  than can be judged by any here. I only offer a few suggestions.\r\n  The reinauguration must not be such as to give control of the\r\n  State and its representation in Congress to the enemies of the\r\n  Union, driving its friends there into political exile. The whole\r\n  struggle for Tennessee will have been profitless to both State and\r\n  nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is put down and\r\n  Governor Harris is put up. It must not be so. You must have it\r\n  otherwise. Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as\r\n  can be trusted for the Union. Exclude all others, and trust that\r\n  your government so organized will be recognized here as being the\r\n  one of republican form to be guaranteed to the State, and to be\r\n  protected against invasion and domestic violence. It is something\r\n  on the question of time to remember that it cannot be known who is\r\n  next to occupy the position I now hold, nor what he will do. I see\r\n  that you have declared in favor of emancipation in Tennessee, for\r\n  which may God bless you. Get emancipation into your new State\r\n  Government—Constitution—and there will be no such word as fail for\r\n  your case. The raising of colored troops, I think, will greatly\r\n  help every way.[28]\r\n\r\nThe reference in this communication to emancipation is explained by the\r\nfact that, in deference to the wishes of Andrew Johnson and other\r\nTennessee loyalists, the President in his proclamation of January 1,\r\n1863, had not mentioned that State.[29]\r\n\r\nBelieving that his commission as military governor did not confer upon\r\nhim powers adequate to every emergency that might arise in the important\r\nwork of restoring a loyal government Mr. Johnson, to supply this\r\ndeficiency, prepared a letter which he submitted for the approval of\r\nPresident Lincoln, who amended or modified it to read as follows:\r\n\r\n  In addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions\r\n  given you by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to\r\n  exercise such powers as may be necessary and proper to enable the\r\n  loyal people of Tennessee to present such a republican form of State\r\n  government as will entitle the State to the guaranty of the United\r\n  States therefor, and to be protected under such State government by\r\n  the United States against invasion and domestic violence, all\r\n  according to the fourth section of the fourth article of the\r\n  Constitution of the United States.[30]\r\n\r\nThis supplemental authority is dated September 19, and the private\r\nletter enclosing it informs Governor Johnson why his draft was altered.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, while the President was thus urging Governor\r\nJohnson, that General Rosecrans, surrounded by a victorious enemy,\r\ninquired of Mr. Lincoln whether it would not be well “to offer a general\r\namnesty to all officers and soldiers in the Rebellion?” In his reply\r\nnext day the President, referring first, as was his wont, to the\r\nmilitary situation, added, “I intend doing something like what you\r\nsuggest whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to have it accepted\r\nin the true understanding rather than as a confession of weakness and\r\nfear.”[31] The removal soon after of General Rosecrans from his command\r\nand the fortunate appearance at Chattanooga of those great soldiers of\r\nthe first rank, Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Sheridan, made at Lookout\r\nMountain and Mission Ridge the occasion which the President so much\r\ndesired, and on December 8, 1863, he issued his famous Proclamation of\r\nAmnesty and Reconstruction, a copy of which was transmitted with his\r\nthird annual message to Congress. The impression which its candid tone\r\nproduces on the mind of a student to-day was the impression made at the\r\ntime of its appearance upon thoughtful and enlightened men everywhere.\r\nNicolay and Hay in an interesting chapter of their valuable history\r\ndescribe the satisfaction, and even enthusiasm, with which it was\r\nreceived by the adherents of all parties in Congress. This proclamation,\r\naround which the later controversy raged, was authorized by act of\r\nCongress approved July 17, 1862, which, among other provisions,\r\nempowered the President “at any time” thereafter “to extend to persons\r\nwho may have participated in the existing Rebellion in any State or part\r\nthereof, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such time and\r\non such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare.” The\r\ntime for the exercise of this discretion Mr. Lincoln believed had now\r\narrived. Like every measure conceived in his fruitful mind it had been\r\nmaturely considered and was especially fortunate in being introduced by\r\nthe concluding paragraphs of the message. The very note of sincerity\r\nitself rings in these weighty lines. Perhaps it was the suggestion of\r\nunuttered arguments that gave a temporary adherence to the Executive\r\nplan, which, we are told, was put forth because “It is now desired by\r\nsome persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their\r\nallegiance to the United States, and to reinaugurate loyal State\r\ngovernments within and for their respective States.” The proclamation\r\ninformed “all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated\r\nin the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full\r\npardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of\r\nall rights of property, except as to slaves, and in property cases where\r\nrights of third parties shall have intervened, and upon the condition\r\nthat every such person shall take and subscribe an oath, and\r\nthenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate; and which oath\r\nshall be registered for permanent preservation.” This oath bound the\r\nsubscriber thenceforth to “faithfully support, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and the union of the States\r\nthereunder”; to “abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress\r\npassed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves” unless\r\nrepealed, modified or held void by Congress, or by decision of the\r\nSupreme Court; to support “all proclamations of the President made\r\nduring the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so\r\nfar as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court.”\r\n\r\nThe classes excepted from the benefits of the amnesty were all persons\r\n“who are, or shall have been, civil or diplomatic officers or agents of\r\nthe so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial\r\nstations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are, or\r\nshall have been, military or naval officers of said so-called\r\nConfederate Government above the rank of colonel in the army or\r\nlieutenant in the navy; all who left seats in the United States Congress\r\nto aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the Army or Navy\r\nof the United States and afterward aided the rebellion; and all who have\r\nengaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in\r\ncharge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which\r\npersons may have been found in the United States service, as soldiers,\r\nseamen, or in any other capacity.”[32]\r\n\r\nThe proclamation provided further that whenever, in any of the States in\r\nrebellion, “a number of persons, not less than one tenth in number of\r\nthe votes cast in such State at the presidential election” of 1860,\r\n“each having taken the oath aforesaid and not having since violated it,\r\nand being a qualified voter by the election law of the State existing\r\nimmediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all\r\nothers, shall reëstablish a State government which shall be republican,\r\nand in nowise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the\r\ntrue government of the State and the State shall receive thereunder the\r\nbenefits of the Constitutional provision which declares that ‘The United\r\nStates shall guaranty to every State in this Union a republican form of\r\nGovernment, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and, on\r\napplication of the legislature, or of the executive (when the\r\nlegislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.’”\r\n\r\nAny provision adopted by such State relative to its freed people “which\r\nshall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their\r\neducation, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement\r\nwith their present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless\r\nclass, will not be objected to by the national executive.” In\r\nconstructing a loyal government in any State, it was thought not\r\nimproper to suggest that “the name of the State, the boundary, the\r\nsubdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws, as before\r\nthe rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications made\r\nnecessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if\r\nany, not contravening said conditions, and which may be deemed expedient\r\nby those framing the new State government.”\r\n\r\nTo avoid every occasion of misunderstanding it was expressly stated that\r\nthe proclamation “has no reference to States wherein loyal State\r\ngovernments have all the while been maintained.” The President\r\ndisclaimed any authority to admit members to seats in Congress, each\r\nHouse being “the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of\r\nits own members.”[33]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it was observed that “while the mode presented is the best\r\nthe executive can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be\r\nunderstood that no other possible mode would be acceptable.”[34]\r\n\r\nTo get an enrollment of those willing to take the oath prescribed in the\r\namnesty proclamation the President, about the middle of January, 1864,\r\nsent an agent to Tennessee, as he had already sent one to Louisiana and\r\nto Arkansas. About the same time Governor Johnson himself was\r\nconsidering the subject of reconstruction; and on the 21st, to begin\r\nproceedings, called a public meeting at Nashville. It was on this\r\noccasion that he said: “Treason must be made odious, traitors must be\r\npunished and impoverished;” slavery he pronounced dead and declared that\r\nreconstruction must leave it out of view. The meeting, which was largely\r\nattended, adopted resolutions recommending a constitutional convention\r\nand pledged support of only those candidates who favored immediate and\r\nuniversal emancipation. The Governor, however, was cautious, and,\r\nJanuary 26, 1864, issued a call for an election, on the first Saturday\r\nof March following, for the choice of only county officers.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Confederate and the loyalist having been placed by the amnesty\r\nproclamation on an equal footing, some dissatisfaction was aroused among\r\nunconditional Union men. To retain the confidence of this class and to\r\nset at rest the hostile feeling thus excited in the State, Governor\r\nJohnson framed the oath of allegiance more stringently than Mr. Lincoln\r\nhad done. This variance occasioned discussion and delay and brought\r\ninquiries and protests to the President, who, to prevent confusion,\r\ntelegraphed, February 20, 1864, Warren Jordan, of Nashville, as follows:\r\n\r\n  In county elections you had better stand by Governor Johnson’s plan;\r\n  otherwise you will have conflict and confusion. I have seen his\r\n  plan.[35]\r\n\r\nA week later he assured the Hon. E. H. East, Secretary of State for\r\nTennessee, that\r\n\r\n  There is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation\r\n  of eighth December, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in\r\n  his proclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo.[36]\r\n\r\nWhile it is perfectly true that no discrepancy existed between the\r\nproclamation of the President and that of the military governor, the\r\nlatter required an additional test. This the communication to Mr. East\r\ndoes not discuss.\r\n\r\nTo avoid, however, any possible mischief from this source Mr. Lincoln,\r\nMarch 26, issued a supplemental proclamation which explained that the\r\namnesty applied only to “persons who being yet at large and free from\r\nany arrest, confinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and\r\ntake the said oath, with the purpose of restoring peace and establishing\r\nthe national authority.”[37] Prisoners excluded from the amnesty offered\r\nin the proclamation of December 8, like all other offenders, might apply\r\nto the executive for clemency and have their applications receive due\r\nconsideration. This oath, it was made known, could be taken before any\r\ncommissioned officer of the United States, civil, military or naval, or\r\nbefore any officer authorized to administer oaths, in a State or\r\nTerritory not in insurrection. Such officers were empowered to give\r\ncertificates thereon to persons by whom the oath was taken and\r\nsubscribed. The original records, after transmission to the Department\r\nof State, were to be there deposited and to remain in the Government\r\narchives. The Secretary of State was required to keep a register of such\r\noaths and upon application to issue certificates in proper cases in the\r\ncustomary form.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an election, the returns of which are extremely meagre, had\r\nbeen held on March 5 for the choice of county officers. Though the event\r\nwas not without influence in confirming the faith of Unionists, it was\r\nchiefly of value in attracting the attention of the disloyal to the\r\nchances afforded by the proclamation of rehabilitating themselves in\r\ntheir former political rights. The result, however, was not so favorable\r\nas was expected by Governor Johnson or the President, and reconstruction\r\nin Tennessee once more sank to rest. From this condition it was again\r\nrevived by the irrepressible Union men of the State. The East Tennessee\r\nconvention of 1861, by appointing a permanent committee, had kept its\r\norganization alive. In April or May, 1864, this body called a convention\r\nat Knoxville to discuss reconstruction. Of this gathering one element\r\nfavored the Crittenden Resolutions; the other, immediate emancipation.\r\nProbably it was this antagonism that prevented further action. The next\r\nwe hear is that Brownlow and others signed a call for a second\r\nconvention, which was held at Nashville on September 5. In this body\r\nforty or fifty counties were represented, some of them irregularly; that\r\nis, by volunteer delegates. This assembly recommended the election of a\r\nconstitutional convention, the abolition of slavery in the State, and\r\nprovided for taking part in the approaching Presidential election. The\r\nprogramme, however, was only partially carried out. On September 30,\r\nGovernor Johnson issued a proclamation for holding the election, at\r\nwhich Union voters, so far as the unsettled condition of military\r\noperations permitted, cast their ballots for electors of President and\r\nVice-President. It does not appear that in this election any attempt was\r\nmade to choose a governor, a legislature or a constitutional convention;\r\nbut that which met in July, 1863, constituted an executive committee,\r\ncomposed of five members from each division of the State, which after\r\nthe Presidential election issued calls for a State convention at\r\nNashville, December 19, 1864. “The people meet,” said the call, “to take\r\nsuch steps as wisdom may direct to restore the State of Tennessee to its\r\nonce honored status in the great national Union.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“If you cannot meet in your counties, come upon your own personal\r\nresponsibility. It is the assembling of Union men for the restoration of\r\ntheir own commonwealth to life and a career of success.”[38]\r\n\r\nHood’s advance upon Nashville preventing a response to this address, the\r\nconvention did not meet till January 9, 1865. The enemy had then been\r\ndispersed. The State being free from further alarms of war, the\r\nconvention met and proposed important alterations in the State\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe first article provided: “That slavery and involuntary servitude,\r\nexcept as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\nconvicted, are hereby forever abolished and prohibited throughout the\r\nState”; also that “The legislature shall make no law recognizing the\r\nright of property in man.” The old constitution of Tennessee prohibited\r\nthe assembly from passing laws to emancipate slaves without the consent\r\nof the owner; that prohibition was now removed. “The declaration of\r\nindependence and ordinance dissolving the federal relations between the\r\nState of Tennessee and the United States of America,” passed by the\r\nLegislature, May 6, 1861, was abrogated and declared “an act of treason\r\nand usurpation, unconstitutional, null and void.” All laws, ordinances,\r\nand resolutions of the usurped State government passed on and after the\r\n6th day of May, 1861, providing for the issuance of State bonds; also\r\nall notes of the Bank of Tennessee or any of its branches issued on or\r\nafter May 6, 1861, and all debts created in the name of the State by\r\nsaid authority were declared unconstitutional, null and void. Future\r\nlegislatures were restrained from the redemption of said bonds. It was\r\nfurther provided that “The qualification of voters and the limitation of\r\nthe elective franchise may be determined by the general assembly, which\r\nshall first assemble under the amended constitution.”\r\n\r\nThe convention completed its labors on January 26, 1865. The amendatory\r\narticles were submitted, February 22, to the people, and ratified by a\r\nvote of 21,104 to 40. The schedule provided in the event of ratification\r\nthat the loyal people of the State should, on the 4th of March next\r\nthereafter, proceed by _general ticket_ to elect a governor and members\r\nto the general assembly to meet in the capitol at Nashville on the first\r\nMonday of April, 1865.\r\n\r\nA proclamation of Governor Johnson, issued on January 26, referred to\r\nthe respectable character of the convention and commended its wisdom in\r\nsubmitting for the approval of the electors the result of its\r\ndeliberations. His executive powers had been employed to enable the\r\npeople freely to express their judgment on the grave question before\r\nthem. Provision, he declared, would be made to collect the sentiments of\r\nloyal Tennesseeans in the army. The paper concludes with this vigorous\r\nexhortation: “Strike down at one blow the institution of slavery, remove\r\nthe disturbing element from your midst, and by united action restore the\r\nState to its ancient moorings again, and you may confidently expect the\r\nspeedy return of peace, happiness, and prosperity.”[39]\r\n\r\nAbout a month later, February 25, he had the happiness to congratulate\r\nthe people of Tennessee on the favorable result of the election. By\r\ntheir solemn act at the ballot-box the shackles had been stricken from\r\nthe limbs of more than 275,000 bondmen.\r\n\r\nThe convention which proposed the constitutional amendments had, in\r\nanticipation of its ratification, nominated William G. [“Parson”]\r\nBrownlow for Governor, and recommended a full legislative ticket. The\r\nnominee of the convention was chosen March 4, almost without opposition,\r\nreceiving 23,352 votes against 35 scattering. Having been elected on a\r\ngeneral ticket the members of both the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives received the same support as the Governor. The\r\nLegislature met at Nashville, and in a few days thereafter Mr. Brownlow\r\nwas inaugurated. Civil administration was thus formally begun.\r\n\r\nThat the successive steps to restoration in Tennessee may be easily\r\ntraced, the narrative has not been interrupted to relate even matters of\r\nundoubted importance. Almost a year before the occurrences described,\r\nthe Republican national convention had assembled in the city of\r\nBaltimore, and on June 6, 1864, unanimously nominated Andrew Johnson for\r\nVice-President on the ticket with Mr. Lincoln. Tidings of the fact\r\naroused great enthusiasm when it became known in Nashville. In\r\naddressing an immense meeting called for that occasion Governor Johnson,\r\namong other things, said: “While society is in this disordered state,\r\nand we are seeking security, let us fix the foundations of our\r\ngovernment on principles of eternal justice, which will endure for all\r\ntime. There are those in our midst who are for perpetuating the\r\ninstitution of slavery. Let me say to you, Tennesseeans, and men from\r\nthe Northern States, that slavery is dead. It was not murdered by me. I\r\ntold you long ago what the result would be if you endeavored to go out\r\nof the Union to save slavery; and that the result would be bloodshed,\r\nrapine, devastated fields, plundered villages and cities; and therefore\r\nI urged you to remain in the Union. In trying to save slavery you killed\r\nit, and lost your own freedom.”[40]\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Hon. William Dennison, accepting the nomination, he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  The authority of the Government is supreme, and will admit of no\r\n  rivalry. No institution can rise above it whether it be slavery or\r\n  any organized power. In our happy form of government all must be\r\n  subordinate to the will of the people, when reflected through the\r\n  Constitution and the laws made pursuant thereto—State or Federal.\r\n  This great principle lies at the foundation of every government, and\r\n  cannot be disregarded without the destruction of the government\r\n  itself.\r\n\r\n  In accepting the nomination I might here close, but I cannot forego\r\n  the opportunity of saying to my old friends of the Democratic party\r\n  _proper_, with whom I have so long and pleasantly been associated,\r\n  that the hour has now come when that great party can justly\r\n  vindicate its devotion to true democratic policy and measures of\r\n  expediency. The war is a war of great principles. It involves the\r\n  supremacy and life of the Government itself. If the rebellion\r\n  triumphs, free government—North and South—fails. If, on the other\r\n  hand, the Government is successful, as I do not doubt, its destiny\r\n  is fixed, its basis permanent and enduring, and its career of honor\r\n  and glory just begun. In a great contest like this, for the\r\n  existence of free government, the path of duty is patriotism and\r\n  principle. Minor considerations and questions of administrative\r\n  policy should give way to the higher duty _of first preserving the\r\n  Government_, and then there will be time enough to wrangle over the\r\n  men and measures pertaining to its administration.[41]\r\n\r\nFor reasons at which Mr. Lincoln hinted in his letter of March 26, 1863,\r\nfew men in Congress exerted in the beginning of the war so decided an\r\ninfluence upon public opinion in the North as did Mr. Johnson. His\r\nconduct as military governor in no way diminished this popularity. His\r\ncourage in that trying position no less than his devotion to the\r\ninterests of the Union won him ardent admirers in every loyal State.\r\n\r\nVice-President Hamlin appears to have been the victim of an intrigue\r\nwhich represented him as being no material source of strength to the\r\ngovernment and as scarcely loyal to the administration. This injurious\r\nsuspicion, which seems to have had no substantial basis in truth,\r\nhappened to coincide with a growing conviction that the Republican party\r\nshould strengthen itself by placing on the ticket with Lincoln some\r\nprominent leader of the opposition. In this connection the names of\r\nGeneral Butler, John A. Dix, Daniel S. Dickinson and Andrew Johnson were\r\nmentioned. The last named was charged in his administration of the\r\noffice of military governor with harshness and even with oppression.\r\nInvestigation proved these rumors to be without foundation, and Mr.\r\nLincoln was not displeased to find them groundless. It does not appear\r\nthat he was especially favorable to Johnson, but he regarded him as\r\nindispensable to the Union cause in Tennessee; Johnson was a\r\nslave-holder, was somewhat more outspoken than Butler or Dix, and a more\r\nconspicuous representative of the large class known as War Democrats;\r\nabove all he was an able exponent of Southern Union sentiment and he\r\ncame from the very heart of the Confederacy. Perhaps no single element\r\nof strength made him more acceptable to the majority of the convention\r\nthan this last consideration. Even these qualifications might not have\r\nsingled him out for the distinction conferred were it not for the\r\nenthusiasm created by a remarkable speech of Horace Maynard, which\r\nmentioned Mr. Johnson as a man who “stood in the furnace of treason.”\r\nHis administration as military governor had been distinguished for vigor\r\nand ability, and it does not appear that the radical Republicans then\r\nregarded his State without the Union. Some of his measures were\r\nundoubtedly severe, but the peculiar situation in Tennessee required the\r\nemployment of methods not adapted to times of peace. Mr. Lincoln could\r\nnot, of course, show his hand in the Baltimore convention. In fact he\r\nrepeatedly declined to interfere.[42]\r\n\r\nOn October 15, 1864, the ten electors on the McClellan ticket\r\npresented through Mr. John Lellyett, one of their number, a protest\r\nto the President against the proclamation published by Governor\r\nJohnson relative to the pending election. His paper, they asserted,\r\ncontained provisions for holding elections which differed materially\r\nfrom the mode prescribed by the laws of Tennessee. The proclamation,\r\nit was alleged, would admit persons to vote who were not entitled by\r\nthe State constitution to participate in the election; by another\r\nprovision which authorized the opening of but one polling-place in\r\neach county, many legal voters would be unable to exercise the\r\nfranchise. The unusual and impracticable test oath proposed, was\r\nstated as a further grievance, and they complained generally of\r\nmilitary interference with the freedom of elections. To their\r\nrepresentations Mr. Lincoln replied orally that General McClellan\r\nand his friends could manage their side of the contest in their own\r\nway. He could manage his side of it in his way.[43] In a written\r\nreply of the 22d, however, the President said that he perceived no\r\nmilitary reason for interfering in the matter, and on the same\r\noccasion reminded the protestants that the conducting of a\r\nPresidential election in Tennessee under the old code had become an\r\nimpossibility.[44]\r\n\r\nIn their reply to the written communication of the President, they\r\nasserted that an orderly meeting of General McClellan’s friends had been\r\nbroken up by Union soldiers, and a reign of terror inaugurated in\r\nNashville. These acts having been countenanced by Governor Johnson, they\r\nannounced the withdrawal of the McClellan electoral ticket in\r\nTennessee.[45]\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Union electors were, of course, chosen; but\r\ntheir votes, though offered, were not counted by Congress in the joint\r\nconvention of February 8, 1865, for the reason that Tennessee was on\r\nNovember 8 preceding in such a state that no free election was held.[46]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Political History of the United States, p. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol.

In October, 1841, the brig\r\n  _Creole_, of Richmond, with a cargo of 135 slaves left Hampton Roads\r\n  for New Orleans. The negroes, under Madison Washington, killed one of\r\n  the owners, took possession of the vessel and steered her into the\r\n  port of Nassau. There those slaves not expressly charged with murder\r\n  were set at liberty, and though the administration demanded their\r\n  surrender they were not given up. The experience of the _Creole_ was\r\n  not singular, several cases of a similar nature being recorded. These\r\n  facts showed the danger of navigating the Bahama channel after 1833,\r\n  and at least one reason for preferring the overland route down the\r\n  Tennessee valley was an expectation of avoiding such accidents.—(See\r\n  Wilson’s Rise and Fall of the Slave Power, Vol. I. pp. 443–444;\r\n  Lalor’s Cyclopedia of Political Science, etc., Vol. I. pp. 709–710.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Brownlow’s Book, p. 52.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee, pp. 80–81.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Brownlow’s Book, p. 67.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Art.

The\r\nthought of restoring a loyal government there proceeded quite naturally\r\nfrom the peculiar situation in the State. Though not so nearly unanimous\r\nfor secession as South Carolina, her people acted with energy and\r\npromptness when they received tidings of “this last insult and outrage,”\r\nas the election of Mr. Lincoln was sensationally styled.[47] Three days\r\nwere deemed sufficient for deliberation, and the convention, January 25,\r\n1861, passed an ordinance of secession. Two weeks before this assembly\r\nmet at Baton Rouge, the arsenal and the forts, a public building and a\r\nrevenue cutter had been seized by State troops from New Orleans. In the\r\nmint and the custom house of that city more than half a million dollars\r\nwas secured for the Confederate States, and in accepting these funds the\r\nMontgomery Congress expressed its “high sense of the patriotic\r\nliberality” of Louisiana.[48] This act of generosity, however, loses\r\nmuch of its merit when it is remembered that both the coin and bullion\r\nin the mint, as well as the customs, belonged to the Federal government.\r\nBesides, there was then no scarcity of money in the State, for Northern\r\nenterprise had found for her cotton and her sugar profitable markets\r\nboth at home and abroad. It was benefits of this sort, enjoyed in the\r\nUnion, that enabled Governor Moore in January, 1861, to report to his\r\nLegislature an overflowing treasury.[49] This undoubted prosperity\r\nserved only to aggravate the war fever. Enthusiasm in New Orleans was\r\nonly less ardent and general than in Charleston. Business was almost\r\nsuspended, and by the first of June no less than 16,000 residents of\r\nLouisiana were serving in the Confederate army.[50]\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln’s proclamation of April 19 preceding had inaugurated a\r\nblockade of every port within the State. The early days of July\r\nwitnessed the disappearance of Governor Moore’s boasted surplus, and\r\nduring the summer New Orleans became bankrupt;[51] her foreign commerce\r\nwas destroyed by the blockade, her credit had vanished. Though\r\nenlistments continued without interruption, signs of financial distress\r\nmultiplied with the approach of winter. Rebellion, it was soon\r\ndiscovered, was not attended with unmixed blessings; bad government had\r\nproduced its usual consequences, and when Governor Taylor, late in the\r\nsummer of 1862, undertook to raise an army for the defence of his State\r\nhe was surprised at the universal apathy; neglect and disaster had\r\nbrought disunionists to a condition little short of hostility to the\r\nRichmond government.[52]\r\n\r\nUnion men in southern Louisiana had not been unobservant of these signs;\r\npermanent residents of this portion of the State had, for the most part,\r\nmaintained their loyalty to the General Government. Indeed, a decided\r\nmajority of them in the election of 1860 had voted for Bell and Douglas,\r\nand though here, as elsewhere in the South, ardent secessionists were\r\nfound, the proceedings in the convention took the Union men by\r\nsurprise.[53] In the interval they had refrained from violence, but had\r\nnot become reconciled to oppression.\r\n\r\nThe importance of New Orleans to their cause had not been overlooked by\r\nConfederate authorities, and that city was held firmly in their grasp\r\nuntil the fleet of Captain Farragut, toward the close of April, 1862,\r\nsteamed up in hostile array before its defences. The occupation by\r\nGeneral Butler’s army of this strategic position ended in southern\r\nLouisiana the activity of the more extreme secessionists, and though\r\nsome restlessness at the presence of Federal forces was pretended by\r\neven Union men, they had not until the surrender made any serious effort\r\nto help themselves. Under protection of the army, however, they\r\ncommenced immediately to form Union associations for the purpose of\r\ndeveloping the loyal sentiment in this part of the State. Resolutions\r\nrecommending an election were passed by these organizations; newspapers\r\ndiscussed the question, and in various ways it was forced upon the\r\nattention of the President.[54] The more prudent and intelligent among\r\nthem began under encouragement of Federal troops to consider measures\r\nfor relief; the less practical commenced writing complaints to friends\r\nin the North.\r\n\r\nIn a private letter of July 26, 1862, to Hon. Reverdy Johnson, then in\r\nNew Orleans investigating General Butler’s relations with foreign\r\nconsuls, Mr. Lincoln, noticing a reference to the restlessness of the\r\npeople under the rule of General Phelps, asks the Maryland Senator to\r\npardon him for believing the complaint “a false pretense.” A way to\r\navert the inconveniences arising from military occupation was for the\r\npeople of Louisiana “simply to take their place in the Union upon the\r\nold terms.”[55] Writing two days later to Cuthbert Bullett, a Southern\r\ngentleman who appears to have enjoyed his personal esteem and\r\nconfidence, the President, after mentioning difficulties in the way of\r\nestablishing civil authority in the State, suggested a method of\r\navoiding them: “The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person\r\nand property,” he wrote, “have but to reach forth their hands and take\r\nit. Let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority, and set\r\nup a State government conforming thereto under the Constitution. They\r\nknow how to do it, and can have the protection of the army while doing\r\nit. The army will be withdrawn so soon as such State government can\r\ndispense with its presence; and the people of the State can then, upon\r\nthe old constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own\r\nliking.”[56] If, however, Union men exerted themselves no further than\r\ncriticism of the Federal Government, it was more than intimated that\r\nthere were to be expected greater injuries than military necessity had\r\nyet inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of events appears even then to have been forcing the\r\nPresident in the direction of emancipation. To August Belmont, of New\r\nYork, who enclosed the complaints of a New Orleans correspondent, Mr.\r\nLincoln, July 31, 1862, repeated in substance what had already been\r\nwritten to Mr. Bullett, and added: “Those enemies must understand that\r\nthey cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government,\r\nand if they fail still come back into the Union unhurt. If they expect\r\nin any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the\r\nwriter [Mr. Belmont’s correspondent] in saying, ‘Now is the time.’”[57]\r\n\r\nThe appointment in August, 1862, of General George F. Shepley as\r\nmilitary governor may be regarded as the first act in the restoration of\r\na loyal government for Louisiana. His selection, though probably\r\nintended as a private commendation of the judgment of General Butler,\r\nwho had already designated him as Mayor of New Orleans, was never\r\nconsidered by that officer adequate atonement for the public censure\r\nimplied in his removal, December, 1862, from command of the Department\r\nof the Gulf.\r\n\r\nUpon the Federal occupation of New Orleans and adjacent territory all\r\nfunctions of the disloyal government therein immediately ceased. As\r\ncontroversies were constantly arising the establishment of courts had\r\nbecome a necessity. At first these questions were for the most part\r\nadjudicated by General Butler himself, but the pressure of military and\r\nother affairs compelled him soon to refer their settlement to civilians\r\nor to army officers especially chosen for the purpose. This uncertain\r\nsystem of justice, though immeasurably better than none, led to the\r\ninstitution of courts each of which was known by the name of the officer\r\nholding it. Accused persons were brought to trial, and judgments\r\nexecuted by soldiers detailed for such duty. No formal record of\r\nproceedings in these tribunals appears to have been kept, though\r\nmemoranda of judgments rendered were, no doubt, made by an officer who\r\ncame eventually to be designated as clerk.\r\n\r\nFor the decision of questions relating exclusively to the force under\r\nhis command General Butler some time in June, 1862, organized a tribunal\r\nknown as the Provost Court of the Army of the United States, over which\r\nMajor Joseph M. Bell presided. Questions in no way connected with the\r\nmilitary, especially matters of police and the punishment of crimes,\r\nwere often submitted for its determination. Aggrieved persons, without\r\nreflecting upon the consequence of their acts, naturally appealed for\r\nredress to the holder of power. Thus the authority of this institution\r\nsilently extended, and by the autumn of 1862 it exercised unquestioned\r\njurisdiction over all criminal cases arising in the city of New\r\nOrleans.[58] In the absence of courts for adjudicating civil questions\r\nthey, too, were referred to its consideration. All functions of\r\ngovernment having been suspended by the capture of the city, it became\r\nthe duty of the Federal commander, and his right by the laws of war, to\r\nprovide, among other things, for the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nOne of the early acts of General Shepley after his appointment as\r\nMilitary Governor was to establish a system of courts for the State.\r\nMost of the former officials having fled after the surrender, he was\r\ncompelled practically to create new tribunals, and this task he greatly\r\nsimplified by reviving those institutions of justice with which the\r\npeople of Louisiana were already familiar. John S. Whittaker was\r\naccordingly appointed Judge of the Second District Court of the parish\r\nof Orleans. Besides possessing in civil matters the ordinary powers of a\r\nlocal court the old tribunal of that name had been a court of probates\r\nand successions. The new exercised all the powers of the old court. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that the latter derived its authority\r\nfrom the laws of Louisiana, while the former owed its existence to the\r\nwar powers of the Federal Executive. Its jurisdiction extended to civil\r\ncases generally where the defendant resided in the parish of Orleans or\r\nwas a non-resident of the State.[59]\r\n\r\nJudge Hiestand was appointed to the bench of the Fourth District Court\r\nof the parish of Orleans. Besides possessing the general authority of\r\nother district courts in that parish it entertained appeals from\r\njustices’ courts; indeed, these constituted a large part of its\r\nbusiness.[60]\r\n\r\nThe Sixth District Court of the parish of Orleans, revived soon after\r\nthe capture of the city, is, because of the incumbent of that bench,\r\nJudge Rufus K. Howell, of greater interest than either of the preceding.\r\nUnder a commission received from the State of Louisiana before its\r\nattempted secession he continued to preside over that tribunal while the\r\ndisunion party ruled New Orleans, and performed his functions up to the\r\nvery hour of its surrender to the Federal authorities. Having early\r\ntaken the oath of allegiance to the national Government he was permitted\r\nto resume his functions.[61] Like the tribunals mentioned, this court\r\nretained and exercised all the powers that it possessed as originally\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nThese courts, instituted during September and October, 1862, entered\r\nupon the discharge of their duties about the 1st of November following.\r\nThey were the only tribunals of civil jurisdiction in Louisiana, and\r\nthat jurisdiction was limited, as against defendants resident of the\r\nState, to citizens of the parish of Orleans. As to inhabitants beyond\r\nthe limits of that parish there was no court in which they could be\r\nsued. Though the Federal forces held several counties in this condition,\r\ntheir tenure fluctuated with the fortunes of war. A court was therefore\r\nneeded whose jurisdiction would expand with the advance, and contract\r\nwith the retreat, of the Union armies. The Provost Court was not deemed\r\nadequate, and indeed was never designed to meet such contingencies. To\r\nsupply this deficiency a tribunal of very extensive powers, designated\r\nas “a court of record for the State of Louisiana,” was constituted by\r\nExecutive order on October 20. Of this flexible institution Charles A.\r\nPeabody, of New York, a friend of Secretary Seward, was made provisional\r\njudge. Besides being empowered to select a prosecuting attorney, a\r\nmarshal and a clerk, and to make rules for the exercise of his\r\njurisdiction, he was authorized “to hear, try and determine all causes,\r\ncivil and criminal, including causes in law, equity, revenue and\r\nadmiralty, and particularly all such powers and jurisdiction as belong\r\nto the District and Circuit Courts of the United States, conforming his\r\nproceedings, so far as possible, to the course of proceedings and\r\npractice which has been customary in the Courts of the United States and\r\nLouisiana—his judgment to be final and conclusive.” These officers were\r\nto be paid out of the contingent fund of the War Department, and a copy\r\nof the Executive order, certified by the Secretary of War, was “held to\r\nbe a sufficient commission” for the Judge.\r\n\r\nThis institution, made up as to its _personnel_ in the North, was sent\r\nfrom New York with the great expedition of General Banks constituted and\r\norganized for immediate business to Louisiana. Though Judge Peabody,\r\naccompanied by Augustus de B. Hughes, Isaac Edward Clarke and George D.\r\nLamont, who had been chosen, respectively, clerk, marshal and\r\nprosecuting attorney, arrived in New Orleans December 15, 1862, the\r\nopening of court was delayed till the 29th of that month by a change of\r\nadministration in that Department.[62]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the tribunals described many other courts were\r\nestablished about this time; of these the Supreme Court of Louisiana is\r\nthe only one which appears to require especial mention. In former times\r\nunder the State judicial system appeals had lain to this institution,\r\nand it was accordingly held that decisions of the courts now created\r\nwere subject to its revision. In this manner many of their judgments\r\nwere stayed and in suspense, so that the new district courts were of\r\nlittle practical benefit. The necessity of a tribunal to remedy this\r\ndeficiency and adjudicate the accumulated cases of former years soon\r\nbecame apparent, and in April, 1863, Mr. Peabody was appointed Chief\r\nJustice of the State Supreme Court; associated with him on this bench\r\nwere judges chosen from among the people of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nNearly a week before his appointment of Judge Peabody, Mr. Lincoln, by\r\nthe hand of Hon. John E. Bouligny, who had not left his seat in the\r\nHouse of Representatives when Southern delegations withdrew from\r\nCongress, sent to General Butler, Governor Shepley and other Federal\r\nofficers having authority under the United States in Louisiana a\r\ncommunication requesting each of them to assist Mr. Bouligny in his\r\neffort to secure “peace again upon the old terms under the Constitution\r\nof the United States.”[63] This desirable end was to be attained by the\r\nelection of “members to the Congress of the United States particularly,\r\nand perhaps a legislature, State officers, and United States senators\r\nfriendly to their object.” Federal officers were instructed to give the\r\npeople a chance to express their wishes at these elections. “Follow\r\nforms of law,” wrote the President, “as far as convenient, but at all\r\nevents get the expression of the largest number of the people possible.\r\nAll see how such action will connect with and affect the proclamation of\r\nSeptember 22. Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of\r\ncharacter, willing to swear support to the Constitution, as of old, and\r\nknown to be above reasonable suspicion of duplicity.”[64]\r\n\r\nLoyal leaders, believing that Northern men holding office under the\r\nGeneral Government in Louisiana would be set up as candidates,\r\ncommunicated their fears to the President, who sent to Governor Shepley\r\na fortnight before the election a letter of which the essential portion\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n  We do not particularly need members of Congress from there to enable\r\n  us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is the\r\n  conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are\r\n  willing to be members of Congress and to swear support to the\r\n  Constitution and that other respectable citizens there are willing\r\n  to vote for them and send them. To send a parcel of Northern men\r\n  here as representatives, elected, as would be understood (and\r\n  perhaps really so), at the point of the bayonet, would be disgusting\r\n  and outrageous; and were I a member of Congress here, I would vote\r\n  against admitting any such man to a seat.[65]\r\n\r\nThe note of sincerity is unmistakable throughout, and in those\r\nRepresentatives and Senators opposed to Executive policy the concluding\r\nsentences especially must have excited strange emotions when they\r\nre-read in after years their impassioned attacks in Congress upon that\r\ndark spirit who, it was gravely alleged, labored with might unquestioned\r\nto subordinate the Legislative branch of Government.\r\n\r\nThe Union associations referred to appointed committees who waited upon\r\nGeneral Shepley and demanded an election. This he hesitated to call\r\nuntil considerable pressure had first been exerted. The sentiments of\r\nthe President concurring with the local feeling in New Orleans, Shepley\r\nfinally yielded, and on November 14, 1862, issued a proclamation for an\r\nelection to be held December 3d following. This election, in the\r\nlanguage of his proclamation, was ordered “for the purpose of securing\r\nto the loyal electors” of both the First and Second Congressional\r\nDistricts “their appropriate and lawful representation in the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States of America, and of enabling them to\r\navail themselves of the benefits secured by the proclamation of the\r\nPresident of the United States to the people of any State, or part of a\r\nState, who shall on the first day of January next be in good faith\r\nrepresented in the Congress of the United States, by members chosen\r\nthereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such\r\nState have participated.”[66]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the qualifications prescribed by the laws of Louisiana,\r\nGeneral Shepley required each elector to take an oath of allegiance to\r\nthe United States, and from among the old and respected citizens of the\r\nState appointed sheriffs and commissioners of election, who performed\r\ntheir duties to the entire satisfaction of both candidates and voters.\r\nThe army, for reasons given above, refrained from all manner of\r\ninterference, and no Federal office-holder was a nominee.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in many years, it was admitted, every qualified\r\nelector might freely cast his ballot without fear of intimidation or\r\nviolence. In a total of 2,643 votes Benjamin F. Flanders was chosen,\r\nwith little opposition, for the First, and Michael Hahn, by a safe\r\nmajority, for the Second Congressional District. A larger vote was\r\nactually cast for Flanders than had been received by his predecessor,\r\nand in both districts 7,760 citizens, or about half the usual number,\r\nappeared at the polls. When it is remembered that four thousand soldiers\r\nwho enlisted in Butler’s army from this part of the State did not\r\nparticipate in the contest, that many citizens from this section were\r\nserving in the Confederate army and that not a few Union men were exiles\r\nin the North or in Europe the vote in this election was by no means\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWith credentials signed by Governor Shepley, Messrs. Hahn and Flanders\r\nappeared in Washington as claimants for seats in Congress. After a\r\nthorough investigation of the election and several ingenious arguments\r\nin opposition both were admitted, February 17, 1863, though not without\r\nconsiderable misgiving, as Representatives for the remainder of the\r\nterm, which expired March 3 following. For their exclusion the\r\nopposition relied mainly upon these grounds:\r\n\r\n_First._ The election, it was asserted, was brought about by a threat of\r\ninterference with slave property if the State was not represented in\r\nCongress by January 1, 1863; this was a measure of coercion, and the\r\ncompliance of citizens in appearing at the polls was ascribed to selfish\r\nmotives rather than to loyal and patriotic sentiments.\r\n\r\n_Second._ The existence of any vacancy in a constitutional sense was at\r\nleast doubtful; and even if vacancies existed in these districts the\r\nauthority of a military governor to call an election was denied.\r\n\r\n_Third._ It was objected that Governor Shepley had dispensed with the\r\nregistry required by law and had empowered commissioners of election to\r\ndecide upon the qualifications of voters; finally, by requiring an oath\r\nof allegiance to the United States, he had imposed upon electors a test\r\nunknown to the laws of Louisiana.[67]\r\n\r\nWhile the cases of Messrs. Hahn and Flanders were pending the edict of\r\nfreedom had gone forth, for the President, as announced in his\r\npreliminary proclamation of September 22, had declared, January 1, 1863,\r\n“as a fit and necessary war measure,” that “all persons held as slaves\r\nwithin said designated States and parts of States, are and henceforward\r\nshall be free.”[68] Louisiana was named as one of the States in\r\nrebellion. From the operation of this measure, however, the city of New\r\nOrleans and thirteen parishes of the State were excepted.\r\n\r\nThe admission, February 17, of Hahn and Flanders gave new life to the\r\npolitical reorganization of the State.[69] But with this revival of\r\ninterest there was discovered among the supporters of the Federal\r\nGovernment a difference of opinion as to the best course to be pursued\r\nin the circumstances. This division of sentiment arose concerning the\r\nwisdom of retaining slavery in those parishes not included in the\r\nPresident’s proclamation. The Union associations, each appointing five\r\ndelegates, organized what they termed a Free State General Committee\r\nwith Thomas J. Durant as president. This body, holding anti-slavery\r\nviews and assuming that rebellion had destroyed the fundamental law,\r\ntook measures to elect delegates to a general convention for the purpose\r\nof framing a new constitution prohibiting slavery. Their plan was\r\napproved by General Shepley, who, June 12, 1863, appointed Mr. Durant\r\nAttorney-General for the State, with power to act as commissioner of\r\nregistration.[70] He was ordered on the same day to make an enrollment\r\nof all free white male citizens of the United States having resided six\r\nmonths in the State and one month in the parish, who should each take\r\nthe oath of allegiance and register “as a voter freely and voluntarily\r\nfor the purpose of organizing a State government in Louisiana, loyal to\r\nthe Government of the United States.”[71]\r\n\r\nThe conservative element, though less active, was by no means\r\nindifferent to these measures, and sent to Washington a committee of\r\nplanters to consult the President. They represented in a communication\r\nto him that they had “been delegated to seek of the General Government a\r\nfull recognition of all the rights of the State as they existed previous\r\nto the passage of an act of secession, upon the principle of the\r\nexistence of the State constitution unimpaired, and no legal act having\r\ntranspired that could in any way deprive them of the advantages\r\nconferred by that constitution.” They further requested him to direct\r\nthe Military Governor to order an election on the first Monday of\r\nNovember following for all State and Federal officers.[72] To this\r\ncommittee, composed of E. E. Malhiot, Bradish Johnson and Thomas\r\nCottman, Mr. Lincoln, under date of June 19, 1863, replied “that a\r\nrespectable portion of the Louisiana people desired to amend their State\r\nconstitution, and contemplated holding a State convention for that\r\nobject. This fact alone, as it seems to me, is a sufficient reason why\r\nthe General Government should not give the committal you seek to the\r\nexisting State constitution. I may add that while I do not perceive how\r\nsuch committal could facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I\r\nreally apprehend it might be so used as to embarrass them.”[73]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, when we recall the letter of July 26, 1862, to Reverdy\r\nJohnson, that the President, then only contemplating emancipation, had,\r\nsince his proclamation had gone forth, taken much more advanced\r\nground.[74] The army was still his main reliance, and the wisdom of\r\nrestoring a loyal government as well as the method of that restoration\r\nwas regarded favorably or otherwise as it appeared to facilitate or\r\nembarrass military operations.\r\n\r\nRelative to an election in November he said, “There is abundant time\r\nwithout any order or proclamation from me just now.” Though their\r\nrequest was courteously denied, he assured the committee that the people\r\nof Louisiana should not lack an opportunity for a fair election for both\r\nFederal and State officers by want of anything within his power to give\r\nthem.[75]\r\n\r\nThe political reorganization of the State was at this point interrupted\r\nby the absence at Port Hudson of General N. P. Banks, then in command of\r\nthe Department of the Gulf. So energetic and successful was the\r\nConfederate General Taylor that by July 10, when he received\r\nintelligence of the fall of Port Hudson and the surrender of Vicksburg,\r\nhis mounted scouts had been pushed to within sixteen miles of New\r\nOrleans.[76] The surrender in these strongholds of more than 40,000 men\r\nwas a crushing blow to the Richmond Government; enough troops were\r\ndisengaged by these victories to overwhelm the enemy that menaced New\r\nOrleans, and General Taylor hurriedly concentrated his army in the\r\nvalley of the Red River to observe the movements of the Federal\r\ncommander. The Union picket line marked at this time the bounds of\r\nGovernor Shepley’s civil jurisdiction; indeed, it was not greatly\r\nextended until the surrender of General E. Kirby Smith late in May,\r\n1865, after the engagement at Brazos. Eastern Louisiana, with Alabama\r\nand Mississippi, had passed a few weeks earlier under Federal control.\r\n\r\nThe great numbers withdrawn from production in the South combined with a\r\nrigorous enforcement of the blockade had occasioned a cotton famine in\r\nthe markets of the world. To relieve this condition an outlet was sought\r\nfor the abundant crops of the Red River country; and this fact was\r\nprobably, not without considerable influence, in determining the course\r\nof the expedition into Texas, which was intended to accomplish a very\r\ndifferent though scarcely less important purpose.\r\n\r\nThough the vigilance of Mr. Adams, United States Minister to England,\r\nwas rewarded by the abandonment in that country of any further attempt\r\nto build cruisers of the Alabama type, the Confederate naval agent by no\r\nmeans despaired of dealing still severer blows to the commerce of the\r\nNorth, and, attracted by promises which appear to have been authorized\r\nby the ruler of France, changed his field of activity from Liverpool to\r\nBordeaux, where a ship-builder was engaged to construct two formidable\r\nrams. With the attempts to get these under the Confederate flag this\r\nessay is not concerned.[77] French interests in Mexico appeared at that\r\ntime to require the cultivation of friendly relations with what some\r\nEuropean States believed was destined to become a new power among the\r\nnations of the world; hence Napoleon’s encouragement to the Confederate\r\nrepresentatives abroad. This situation was so seriously regarded by the\r\nGovernment at Washington that even at considerable sacrifice it was\r\ndetermined to plant the Union flag somewhere in Texas. To effect this\r\nobject General Banks had considered and submitted to the War Department\r\nplans of his own; these, however, appear to have been reluctantly\r\nabandoned because of repeated instructions from General Halleck, and the\r\nmovement toward Shreveport in the spring and early summer of 1864 was\r\nbegun. From the protracted and envenomed controversy to which it gave\r\nrise among the officers on both sides its disastrous ending is familiar\r\nto all.[78]\r\n\r\nWhile this joint land and naval expedition was yet in contemplation Mr.\r\nLincoln found time to inform the Federal commander of his opinions\r\nrespecting the establishment of a civil government in Louisiana. In his\r\nletter of August 5, 1863, to General Banks he wrote:\r\n\r\n  While I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it\r\n  is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter.\r\n  I would be glad for her to make a new constitution recognizing the\r\n  emancipation proclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts\r\n  of the State to which the proclamation does not apply. And while she\r\n  is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt\r\n  some practical system by which the two races could gradually live\r\n  themselves out of the old relation to each other, and both come out\r\n  better prepared for the new. Education for young blacks should be\r\n  included in the plan. After all, the power or element of “contract”\r\n  may be sufficient for this probationary period; and, by its\r\n  simplicity and flexibility, may be the better.\r\n\r\n  As an anti-slavery man, I have a motive to desire emancipation which\r\n  pro-slavery men do not have; but even they have strong enough reason\r\n  to thus place themselves again under the shield of the Union; and to\r\n  thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through\r\n  which we are now passing.\r\n\r\nHe expressed his approval of the registry which he supposed Mr. Durant\r\nwas making with a view to an election for a constitutional convention,\r\nthe work of which, he hoped, would reach Washington by the meeting of\r\nCongress in December. Before concluding this letter he added: “For my\r\nown part, I think I shall not, in any event, retract the emancipation\r\nproclamation; nor, as executive, ever return to slavery any person who\r\nis freed by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of\r\nCongress.”[79]\r\n\r\nHe again invites attention to the fact that if Louisiana should send\r\nmembers to Congress their admission would depend upon the respective\r\nHouses and not to any extent upon the wishes of the Executive.\r\n\r\nCopies of this communication he intended to send to Hahn, Flanders and\r\nDurant. Three months later, when the gentleman last named informed him\r\nthat nothing had yet been done toward the enrollment, Mr. Lincoln wrote\r\nimmediately to General Banks a letter which at once reveals both the\r\nextent of his interest in this subject and his extreme disappointment on\r\nlearning that his wishes had been but little regarded. Flanders, then in\r\nWashington, confirmed the account of Durant. “This disappoints me\r\nbitterly,” said the letter of November 5, 1863, and though the President\r\ndid not blame either General Banks or the Louisiana leaders for this\r\napparent neglect he urged them “to lose no more time.” “I wish him\r\n[General Shepley], ...” continued the letter, “without waiting for more\r\nterritory, to go to work and give me a tangible nucleus which the\r\nremainder of the State may rally around as fast as it can, and which I\r\ncan at once recognize and sustain as the true State government. And in\r\nthat work I wish you and all under your command to give them a hearty\r\nsympathy and support.\r\n\r\n“The instruction to Governor Shepley bases the movement (and rightfully,\r\ntoo) upon the loyal element. Time is important. There is danger, even\r\nnow, that the adverse element seeks insidiously to preoccupy the ground.\r\nIf a few professedly loyal men shall draw the disloyal about them, and\r\ncolorably set up a State government, repudiating the Emancipation\r\nProclamation and reëstablishing slavery, I cannot recognize or sustain\r\ntheir work. I should fall powerless in the attempt. This Government in\r\nsuch an attitude would be a house divided against itself.\r\n\r\n“I have said, and say again, that if a new State government, acting in\r\nharmony with this government, and consistently with general freedom,\r\nshall think best to adopt a reasonable temporary arrangement in relation\r\nto the landless and homeless freed people, I do not object; but my word\r\nis out to be for and not against them on any question of their permanent\r\nfreedom. I do not insist upon such temporary arrangement, but only say\r\nsuch would not be objectionable to me.”[80]\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that Thomas J. Durant, who was authorized to\r\nmake the enrollment as well as to appoint “registers” to assist him, was\r\nspokesman of the wealthy and influential class of planters, or the\r\nconservative element whose interests opposed any disturbance of existing\r\nconditions. He appears to have drawn for the President a somewhat gloomy\r\npicture of the political situation in Louisiana, and finally to have\r\nprotested against the government organized by the adverse party. The\r\noutlook there, however, was not so discouraging as represented; for as\r\nearly as October 9 Governor Shepley had renewed his order for the\r\nregistration, modifying the former one so far as to include “all loyal\r\ncitizens.”\r\n\r\nInterest was somewhat quickened by the announcement of certain\r\nconservative leaders of an intention to hold a voluntary election in\r\nconformity with the old constitution and laws of the State. On October\r\n27, 1863, an address signed by the president and vice-president of the\r\nCentral Executive Committee was published in the papers of New Orleans.\r\nThis appeal, directed to the loyal citizens of Louisiana, begins:\r\n\r\n  The want of civil government in our State can, by a proper effort on\r\n  your part, soon be supplied, under laws and a constitution formed\r\n  and adopted by yourselves in a time of profound peace. It is made\r\n  your duty, as well as your right, to meet at the usual places, and\r\n  cast your votes for State and parish officers, members of Congress,\r\n  and of the State Legislature.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The day, as fixed by our laws, is Monday, the 2d day of November\r\n  next, 1863. There is nothing [proceeds the address] to prevent your\r\n  meeting on the day fixed by law, and selecting your agents to carry\r\n  on the affairs of government in our own State. The military will not\r\n  interfere with you in the exercise of your civil rights and duties,\r\n  and we think we can assure you that your action in this respect will\r\n  meet the approval of the National Government.\r\n\r\nThe failure of those citizens addressed to exercise their rights, it was\r\nasserted, would subject “the country” to the danger of being thrown as\r\n“vacated” territory into the hands of Congress.[81]\r\n\r\nThe Free State Committee having been invited to coöperate, a\r\ncorrespondence ensued between the rival organizations; but, on the\r\nground that this movement was both illegal and unjust, the Free State\r\nmen declined to participate in the election. In their reply the latter\r\nassert that “There is no law in existence, as stated by you [The\r\nExecutive Central Committee], directing elections to be held on the\r\nfirst Monday of November.\r\n\r\n“The constitution of 1852, as amended by the convention of 1861, was\r\noverthrown and destroyed by the rebellion of the people of Louisiana,\r\nand the subsequent conquest by the arms of the United States does not\r\nrestore your political institutions.”[82]\r\n\r\nThe reply then proceeds to discuss the injustice of the movement, and\r\nupon this subject its reasoning is entitled to more respect. As to the\r\nstatus of the constitution of 1852, it is not easy to comprehend how the\r\nsecession convention, a body universally regarded as revolutionary,\r\ncould amend, in the manner attempted, the fundamental law, seeing that\r\nthis revolution was not yet crowned with success.\r\n\r\nThough no general election was held in response to this address, voting\r\ntook place in two parishes, and certain persons were chosen as\r\nRepresentatives in Congress. Before giving an account of this election\r\nof November 2, 1863, it may be proper to notice a petition submitted by\r\nthe free colored people of New Orleans to Governor Shepley praying to be\r\nregistered as voters so that they could “assist in establishing in the\r\nnew Convention a Civil Government” for their “beloved State of\r\nLouisiana.” This address, prepared at a meeting on November 5, and not\r\nwithout ability, recites in appropriate language the services rendered\r\nby free colored men to both the Nation and the State. It is sufficient\r\nto observe here that their prayer was not granted. The paper itself will\r\nbe considered in discussing the successive steps which led to the\r\ncomplete enfranchisement of the race.[83]\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter has noticed President Lincoln’s Amnesty\r\nProclamation of December 8 as well as that part of the accompanying\r\nmessage to Congress discussing his plan for restoring Union governments\r\nin the insurgent States. The House had not completed its organization\r\nfor the Thirty-eighth Congress when Thaddeus Stevens, a Representative\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, either from curiosity or an anxiety to oppose, as he\r\nconceived, the policy of the President, inquired what names had been\r\nomitted in the call of members. At a later stage of its first meeting,\r\nDecember 7, 1863, he again referred to this subject by asking to have\r\nread the credentials of persons claiming to be Representatives “from the\r\nso-called State of Louisiana.” The acting clerk facetiously promised\r\ncompliance, and read a certificate signed by Mr. John Leonard Riddell\r\nnaming A. P. Field, Thomas Cottman and Joshua Baker as persons elected\r\nto represent respectively the First, Second and Fifth Congressional\r\nDistricts of the State.[84]\r\n\r\nOn a resolution “That A. P. Field is not entitled to a seat in this\r\nHouse from the State of Louisiana,” reported January 29, 1864, from the\r\nCommittee of Elections, his right to admission was fully discussed.\r\n\r\nUnder the apportionment of 1850 that State sent four, and by the census\r\nof 1860 became entitled to five, Representatives. By an act of Congress\r\napproved July 14, 1862, each State entitled to more than one member in\r\nthe lower House was to be divided into as many districts as it had been\r\nallotted Representatives.\r\n\r\nBut, said Chairman Dawes, as Louisiana had never been so divided no\r\nperson in that State had been chosen according to Federal law. The\r\nelection under which Mr. Field claimed a seat occurred in the old First\r\nCongressional District, which, with a great portion of the city of New\r\nOrleans, included two adjacent parishes, Placquemines and St. Bernard.\r\nOn November 1, General Shepley issued a military order forbidding the\r\nelection, and none was held in New Orleans. In the two outlying\r\nparishes, however, under the auspices of a citizens’ committee, to which\r\nreturns were made, a few voters appeared at the polls. In the parish of\r\nSt. Bernard, the only locality in which the House had any proof that\r\nelectors participated, Mr. Field received one hundred and fifty-six\r\nvotes, and though no evidence in support of his statement had been\r\noffered, about the same number, he alleged, had been cast for him in\r\nPlacquemines.\r\n\r\nThe question was, proceeded Mr. Dawes, whether a gentleman with this\r\nconstituency could be in any sense considered as having been elected.\r\nThere were in his district over 10,000 qualified voters, and of these\r\nthe claimant received the support of only one hundred and fifty-six;\r\nhence nearly ten thousand electors expressed no opinion, armed\r\ninterference having prevented 9,844 of them from indicating a\r\npreference. There was no evidence that this majority acquiesced in what\r\nwas done by one hundred and fifty-six men in a corner of St. Bernard\r\nparish where an election was permitted. If no other objection existed,\r\nthe State had not been districted as required by the Act of July, 1862;\r\nthis consideration of itself appeared to the Committee a reason\r\nsufficient for his exclusion. Further, his certificate was signed by one\r\nJohn Leonard Riddell, himself chosen Governor at the same time and in\r\nthe same parishes. His term, according to the laws of Louisiana, did not\r\ncommence till January 1, 1864, and it was not easy to comprehend how he\r\ncame to regard himself as Executive of the State on November 20, 1863,\r\nwhen he signed the certificate presented by the claimant. Mr. Riddell,\r\nindeed, had not then been inaugurated.\r\n\r\nHad not Congress failed to divide the State, the suppression of this\r\nelection would have been without justification and have deserved the\r\ncondemnation of the House. It, however, did not conform to the laws of\r\nLouisiana, for the votes were not cast nor were they counted or\r\ncanvassed as prescribed thereby. This, in substance, was the argument of\r\nMr. Dawes.\r\n\r\nBy other members attention was invited to the fact that under the same\r\nlaws and conditions an election had been held in Louisiana a year\r\nbefore, and in consequence two Representatives admitted. To this\r\nobservation Mr. Stevens replied that Hahn and Flanders, the members\r\nreferred to, had been seated by the power of the House without, as he\r\nthen supposed, any law or right. Henry Winter Davis alone among all who\r\nspoke on the question approved the action of the Military Governor on\r\nthe ground that there was no legal right to hold an election, and the\r\nattempt of any number of persons to do so was an usurpation of sovereign\r\nauthority which was properly prevented. Other Representatives, however,\r\nstrongly condemned this act of Governor Shepley and at least one desired\r\nthe House to express as an amendment to the resolution its disapproval\r\nof his conduct. Though not the question in debate, there could be no\r\nmistaking upon this point the sentiments of a majority of the members.\r\n\r\nMr. Field, permitted to address the House, observed that it was the\r\nfault of the General Government that Union men in Louisiana had not been\r\naided by the previous administration. If they had been, the blood of\r\nIllinois and Massachusetts patriots would not have sprinkled the soil of\r\nhis State.\r\n\r\nTo show that some sort of government existed there he caused the clerk\r\nto read a list of one hundred and twenty-five officers acting in those\r\nparishes included within Federal military lines, and added that though\r\nNew Orleans since its capture paid annually in taxes, collected through\r\nGovernor Shepley, two and a half million dollars, besides a considerable\r\nsum in internal revenue, her people were represented neither in the\r\nlocal nor the national Government.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Louisiana, he said, required that qualified electors\r\nshould be white males who had attained the age of twenty-one years, and\r\nbeen residents of the State for twelve months immediately preceding the\r\nelection. The provision was so modified by Governor Shepley that persons\r\nof this description were allowed to vote after a residence of six\r\nmonths. Mr. Field did not know whence was derived the authority to amend\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nTo secure his coöperation in establishing a loyal government Union men\r\nmet as early as September 19 in convention at New Orleans, and appointed\r\na committee of nine to present an address to the Military Governor\r\ninviting his assistance. He declined, however, after a lengthy interview\r\nto order an election for Representatives until the State had first been\r\ndivided. In fact, until instructions which he had requested, were\r\nreceived from Washington he refused to order any election whatever,\r\nthough he volunteered to forward to Mr. Lincoln any communication which\r\nthey desired to address him on that subject. Besides its correspondence\r\nwith Governor Shepley, the New Orleans convention on September 21 had\r\nsent a letter to General Banks, the Department commander, to secure if\r\npossible his approval of their movement.\r\n\r\nNotice, dated October 20, was given that an election would be held,\r\nNovember 2, at the usual places in the parish of St. Bernard, and the\r\nState and Federal offices to be filled, as well as the precise places at\r\nwhich voters could cast their ballots, were mentioned. Since the\r\nmilitary authorities had refused to assist them, and had then issued no\r\norder against an election, loyal men thought it not improper to express\r\ntheir opinions at the polls. As the Free State people considered\r\nLouisiana out of the Union they declined to participate, and though\r\nGeneral Banks in obedience to instructions from the President had\r\nsubsequently ordered an election they maintained the same attitude. The\r\nclaimant’s party did not oppose this order; for if unable to restore\r\ntheir State in the manner most acceptable they were willing to coöperate\r\nin any method likely to accomplish that object.\r\n\r\nPrecisely what number of voters would be called a constituency Mr. Field\r\nhad not been informed. In the portion of his Congressional District\r\nincluded in St. Bernard and Placquemines parishes there were only 2,400\r\nelectors, and the President’s plan required only one tenth of the number\r\nof votes cast in 1860. Though the election of November 2 preceded the\r\nExecutive proclamation, that fact should not make it void. The electors\r\nin New Orleans were not free to express a choice, and even if it had\r\nbeen otherwise the vote in the First District must have been greatly\r\ndiminished since 1860, for he was assured by two paymasters that 7,000\r\nmen had been recruited there for the Union army.\r\n\r\nSome members admitted that the national Government had not given\r\nsufficient protection to Union men in Louisiana, and therefore should\r\nnot now take advantage of that neglect to also deprive them of\r\nrepresentation in Congress. These believed that if Mr. Field had\r\nreceived a majority of the votes in his district any informality in the\r\nelection should be overlooked, for the right to representation in\r\nCongress grows out of the Constitution, and regulations governing such\r\nelections are matters of mere convenience. The fact that no State\r\norganization existed there did not create a legal impediment, and it was\r\nno objection that Louisiana had not been redistricted, for the\r\nadditional member was not imposed as a burden but as a right which she\r\nwas free to exercise or not; besides, the greater representation\r\nincludes the less.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these considerations, and strong, though not universal,\r\ntestimony to the claimant’s loyalty, he was denied admission, February\r\n9, 1864, by a vote of 85 to 48.[85] His case, however, was not exactly\r\nsimilar to that of Messrs. Hahn and Flanders, as stated by one\r\nRepresentative, for they had received, in the circumstances, a\r\ncomparatively large vote.\r\n\r\nTo this end came the movement of the planters designed primarily to\r\ncounteract that inaugurated by the Free State Committee, which also, as\r\nwe shall see, was soon at variance with the military authorities.\r\nImportant changes had occurred in the shifting politics of his State\r\nbefore the House had taken final action in the case of Mr. Field; these\r\nwill be briefly related.\r\n\r\nMilitary necessity had led the President to issue, December 8, 1863, his\r\nProclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction proposing, though not rigidly\r\ninsisting upon, a plan for reinaugurating State governments wherever\r\nthere existed such a loyal nucleus as could effectively assist in\r\noverthrowing the rebellion. In discussing the affairs of Tennessee that\r\nplan has been quoted at such length as to require no further mention in\r\nthis place.[86]\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks on January 8, 1864, announced his intention of ordering an\r\nelection of State officers. He was urged at this point by the Free State\r\nCommittee to allow their election to go on, but he refused to yield even\r\nunder pressure of an immense public meeting favorable to their\r\nobject.[87] Without his coöperation their plan was doomed to failure,\r\nand when entreaties did not avail to move him they promptly inveighed\r\nagainst his methods and his motives in the columns of _The National\r\nIntelligencer_ at Washington. In a letter dated New Orleans, January 9,\r\n1864, a correspondent writes:\r\n\r\n  President Lincoln has started a Missouri case in Louisiana, and has\r\n  made Banks our master; and Banks is another Schofield, only worse\r\n  than he. Our mass meeting last evening was a complete success; but\r\n  its object will be defeated by Banks, who, under orders direct from\r\n  the President, declares his purpose to order an election for a\r\n  convention; thus playing into the hands of Cottman, Riddle, and\r\n  Fields, and their crew. The Union men—the true Union men—are\r\n  thunderstruck by the course of the President in this matter.\r\n\r\n  We were not informed of the President’s orders to General Banks\r\n  until the hour of the meeting last night, and the meeting was not\r\n  informed at all. General Shepley, who is generally liked, and who\r\n  has done all he could to promote the free State cause, and to\r\n  organize a free State government, will resign, and the election\r\n  ordered by Banks will be purely at military dictation, and will be\r\n  so regarded.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent does not know the secret springs of all these acts of\r\nthe President, but thinks he has probably been deceived by base and\r\ninterested men. “Banks,” he believes, “has the unchanged confidence of\r\nMr. Lincoln.” The writer concludes by asking whether it is not possible\r\nto get the President to countermand his orders to Banks immediately,\r\n“and let the people manage matters as they have begun to do?”[88] To\r\nprove that no line of policy would be acceptable to the Free State\r\nCommittee Mr. Field, in his remarks before the House, read in full the\r\ncommunication from which these excerpts are taken.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend clearly the nature of the controversy which so suddenly\r\narose between the Free State General Committee and the Federal commander\r\nin Louisiana it may be necessary to explain with some detail the precise\r\nattitude of that organization relative to the question at issue between\r\nthe adverse parties. In discussing the respective merits of the State\r\nconstitutions of 1852 and 1861 the organ of the Free State men says:\r\n\r\n  The question is altogether immaterial; for, in the conflict of arms\r\n  incident to this rebellion, the predominant ideas of the good people\r\n  of Louisiana have far preceded either constitution; and to\r\n  reorganize now the State on the slave basis, which both\r\n  constitutions and the laws passed under them recognized, has become\r\n  an utter impossibility. Free soil and free speech have grown up into\r\n  absolute necessities, directly resulting from the war, which has\r\n  converted into dust and ashes all the constitutions which Louisiana\r\n  has ever made, embodying the ideas of property in our fellow-man,\r\n  and all the baneful results of this system of African slavery. The\r\n  present war is nothing but the conflict of the ideas of slavery and\r\n  liberty.... We cannot have peace until public opinion is brought\r\n  quite up to this point. We cannot reorganize the civil government of\r\n  our city, and still less that of our State, and get rid of the\r\n  fearful incubus of martial law now pressing down our energies by its\r\n  arbitrary influence, unless we believe, give utterance to and\r\n  establish the fundamental principle of our national government: “all\r\n  men are created free and equal.” We know of no better way to effect\r\n  this than by calling a convention as soon as possible, to declare\r\n  the simple fact that Louisiana now is and will forever be a free\r\n  State.[89]\r\n\r\nThe party favoring this method insisted that in August, 1863, when\r\nGeneral Shepley was in Washington, their plan in all its parts was\r\nadopted in a Cabinet meeting, and that a special order issued from the\r\nWar Department directing the Military Governor to carry it into\r\nexecution. The movement for reorganizing the State would thus be placed\r\nunder control of the steadfast opponents of slavery. They further\r\nclaimed that Mr. Lincoln then preferred the calling of a convention to\r\nan election of State officers under the old constitution. His letter of\r\nAugust 5, 1863, to General Banks certainly leaves no doubt as to his\r\nsentiments at that time, for he expressed his approval of the enrollment\r\nbeing taken by Durant with a view to an election for a constitutional\r\nconvention, the mature work of which, he thought, should reach\r\nWashington by the meeting of Congress. The impossibility of so\r\nexpediting registration outside of New Orleans as to be ready for an\r\nelection at that early date was explained to the President by the Free\r\nState Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. B. F. Flanders returning from Washington in October, 1863, reported\r\nthe President as saying, in reply to an objection that enough territory\r\nand population were not under protection of the Union army to justify an\r\nelection, that so great was the necessity for immediate action that he\r\nwould recognize and sustain a State government organized by any part of\r\nthe population of which the National forces then had control, and that\r\nhe wished Flanders on his return to Louisiana to say so.[90]\r\n\r\nThe registration under Governor Shepley, though frequently interrupted,\r\nhad proceeded, and the Free State Committee, to insure the success of\r\ntheir object, conferred with him for the purpose of holding, about\r\nJanuary 25, 1864, an election for delegates to a State convention which,\r\nas already observed, intended to frame a new constitution abolishing\r\nslavery everywhere throughout the State. The announcement, then, on\r\nJanuary 8, 1864, by General Banks of his intention to order an election\r\nof State officers under the old constitution was regarded by them as a\r\ndecision for their adversaries. Their objections to the proclamation\r\nitself will be noticed in the proper place. It provided not only for an\r\nelection of State officers on February 22 following, but also for the\r\nchoice of delegates to a convention to be held in April for a revision\r\nof the constitution. The paramount objection of the Free State men was\r\nthat the election of State officers would, under the course of General\r\nBanks, precede that for delegates to the convention, the point at which\r\nthey desired to begin the work of reëstablishing a civil government for\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nTo Thomas Cottman, who accompanied Mr. Field to Washington claiming a\r\nseat in Congress as Representative from the Second Louisiana District,\r\nMr. Lincoln, on December 15, wrote:\r\n\r\n  You were so kind as to say this morning that you desire to return to\r\n  Louisiana, and to be guided by my wishes, to some extent, in the\r\n  part you may take in bringing that State to resume her rightful\r\n  relation to the General Government.\r\n\r\n  My wishes are in a general way expressed, as well as I can express\r\n  them, in the proclamation issued on the eighth of the present month,\r\n  and in that part of the annual message which relates to that\r\n  proclamation. It there appears that I deem the sustaining of the\r\n  Emancipation Proclamation, where it applies, as indispensable; and I\r\n  add here that I would esteem it fortunate if the people of Louisiana\r\n  should themselves place the remainder of the State upon the same\r\n  footing.[91]\r\n\r\nThough this letter expressed as one of Mr. Lincoln’s strongest wishes a\r\nhope that all Union men in Louisiana would “eschew cliquism,” he was\r\ndestined to be disappointed, for at this very time letters from General\r\nBanks, dated December 6 and 16, informed him that Governor Shepley, Mr.\r\nDurant and others had given him to understand that they were charged\r\nexclusively with the work of reconstruction in Louisiana and hence he\r\nhad not felt authorized to interfere. Other officers had set up claims\r\nto jurisdiction conflicting and interfering with his own powers of\r\nmilitary administration. Annoyed that a misunderstanding was delaying\r\nwork which he had been urging for a year, the President, on the 24th of\r\nDecember, wrote General Banks as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have all the while intended you to be master, as well in regard to\r\n  reorganizing a State government for Louisiana, as in regard to the\r\n  military matters of the department; and hence my letters on\r\n  reconstruction have nearly, if not quite, all been addressed to you.\r\n  My error has been that it did not occur to me that Governor Shepley\r\n  or any one else would set up a claim to act independently of you;\r\n  and hence I said nothing expressly upon the point.\r\n\r\n  Language has not been guarded at a point where no danger was thought\r\n  of. I now tell you that in every dispute with whomsoever, you are\r\n  master.\r\n\r\n  Governor Shepley was appointed to assist the commander of the\r\n  department, and not to thwart him or act independently of him.\r\n  Instructions have been given directly to him, merely to spare you\r\n  detail labor, and not to supersede your authority. This, in its\r\n  liability to be misconstrued, it now seems was an error in us. But\r\n  it is past. I now distinctly tell you that you are master of all,\r\n  and that I wish you to take the case as you find it, and give us a\r\n  free State reorganization of Louisiana in the shortest possible\r\n  time. What I say here is to have a reasonable construction. I do not\r\n  mean that you are to withdraw from Texas, or abandon any other\r\n  military measure which you may deem important. Nor do I mean that\r\n  you are to throw away available work already done for\r\n  reconstruction; nor that war is to be made upon Governor Shepley, or\r\n  upon any one else, unless it be found that they will not coöperate\r\n  with you, in which case, and in all cases, you are master while you\r\n  remain in command of the department.[92]\r\n\r\nThis letter making General Banks “master” of the situation in Louisiana\r\nthe President concluded by thanking him for his successful and valuable\r\noperations in Texas. But before receiving this extensive authority and\r\nthe undoubted assurance of Mr. Lincoln’s confidence the commander, on\r\nDecember 30, submitted to the President a plan of reconstruction based\r\nupon the Proclamation and the Message of the 8th of that month. For\r\nevident reasons this communication deserves to be reproduced almost\r\nentire:\r\n\r\n  I would suggest [says General Banks], as the only speedy and certain\r\n  method of accomplishing your object, that an election be ordered, of\r\n  a State government, under the constitution and laws of Louisiana,\r\n  except so much thereof as recognizes and relates to slavery, which\r\n  should be declared by the authority calling the election, and in the\r\n  order authorizing it, inoperative and void. The registration of\r\n  voters to be made in conformity with your Proclamation, and all\r\n  measures hitherto taken with reference to State organization, not\r\n  inconsistent with the Proclamation, may be made available. A\r\n  convention of the people for the revision of the constitution may be\r\n  ordered as soon as the government is organized, and the election of\r\n  members might take place on the same or a subsequent day with the\r\n  general election. The people of Louisiana will accept such a\r\n  proposition with favor. They will prefer it to any arrangement which\r\n  leaves the subject to them for an affirmative or negative vote.\r\n  Strange as this may appear, it is the fact. Of course a government\r\n  organized upon the basis of immediate and universal freedom, with\r\n  the general consent of the people, followed by the adaptation of\r\n  commercial and industrial interests to this order of things, and\r\n  supported by the army and navy, the influence of the civil officers\r\n  of the Government, and the Administration at Washington, could not\r\n  fail by any possible chance to obtain an absolute and permanent\r\n  recognition of the principle of freedom upon which it would be\r\n  based. Any other result would be impossible. The same influence\r\n  would secure with the same certainty the selection of proper men in\r\n  the election of officers.\r\n\r\n  Let me assure you that this course will be far more acceptable to\r\n  the citizens of Louisiana than the submission of the question of\r\n  slavery to the chances of an election. Their self-respect, their\r\n  _amour propre_ will be appeased if they are not required to vote for\r\n  or against it. Offer them a government without slavery and they will\r\n  gladly accept it as a necessity resulting from the war. On all other\r\n  points, sufficient guarantees of right results can be secured; but\r\n  the great question, that of immediate emancipation, will be covered\r\n  _ab initio_, by a conceded and absolute prohibition of slavery.\r\n\r\n  Upon this plan a government can be established whenever you wish—in\r\n  thirty or sixty days; a government that will be satisfactory to the\r\n  South and the North; to the South, because it relieves them from any\r\n  action in regard to an institution which cannot be restored, and\r\n  which they cannot condemn; and to the North, because it places the\r\n  interests of liberty beyond all possible accident or chance of\r\n  failure. The result is certain.[93]\r\n\r\nUpon receiving this communication the President, who cherished no plan\r\nof restoration to which exact conformity was indispensable, expressed,\r\nJanuary 13, 1864, in a letter to General Banks his gratitude for the\r\nzeal and confidence manifested by him on the question of reinaugurating\r\na free State government in Louisiana. He hoped, because of the authority\r\ncontained in the letter of December 24, that the Department Commander\r\nhad already commenced work. “Whether you shall have done so or not,”\r\ncontinues the letter, “please, on receiving this, proceed with all\r\npossible despatch, using your own absolute discretion in all matters\r\nwhich may not carry you away from the conditions stated in your letters\r\nto me, nor from those of the message and proclamation of December 8.\r\nFrame orders, and fix times and places for this and that, according to\r\nyour own judgment.”[94]\r\n\r\nThis letter repeats the idea of subordination to General Banks of all\r\nofficials in his department holding authority from the President, and\r\nstated that the bearer of the communication, Collector Dennison, of New\r\nOrleans, understood the views of the commander and was willing to assist\r\nin carrying them out. Before Mr. Dennison arrived in New Orleans,\r\nhowever, General Banks had already, in his proclamation of January 11,\r\n1864, fixed a date for the election. This action was determined, said\r\nthe Department Commander, upon ample assurance “that more than a tenth\r\nof the population desire the earliest possible restoration of Louisiana\r\nto the Union”; hence he invited “the loyal citizens of the State\r\nqualified to vote in public affairs ... to assemble in the election\r\nprecincts designated by law, ... on the 22d of February, 1864, to cast\r\ntheir votes for the election of State officers herein named, _viz._\r\nGovernor, Lieutenant-Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer,\r\nAttorney-General, Superintendent of Public Instruction and Auditor of\r\nPublic Accounts—who shall, when elected, for the time being, and until\r\nothers are appointed by competent authority, constitute the civil\r\ngovernment of the State, under the constitution and laws of Louisiana,\r\nexcept so much of said constitution and laws as recognize, regulate or\r\nrelate to slavery, which being inconsistent with the present condition\r\nof public affairs, and plainly inapplicable to any class of persons now\r\nexisting within its limits, must be suspended, and they are therefore\r\nand hereby declared to be inoperative and void. This proceeding is not\r\nintended to ignore the right of property existing prior to the\r\nrebellion, nor to preclude the claim for compensation of loyal citizens\r\nfor losses sustained by enlistment or other authorized acts of\r\nGovernment.”[95]\r\n\r\nThe qualifications of voters in this election were to be determined by\r\nthe oath of allegiance prescribed by the President’s proclamation\r\ntogether with the condition annexed to the elective franchise by the\r\nconstitution of Louisiana. Officers elected were to be duly installed on\r\nthe 4th of March.\r\n\r\nSo much of the registration effected under direction of Governor Shepley\r\nand the several Union Associations as was not inconsistent with the\r\nproclamation and other orders of the President was approved. The\r\nproclamation further announced that arrangements would be made for the\r\nearly election of members of Congress for the State, and, that the\r\norganic law might be made to conform to the will of the people and\r\nharmonize with the spirit of the age, an election of delegates to a\r\nconvention for the revision of the constitution would be held on the\r\nfirst Monday of April following.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation declared, among other things, that\r\n\r\n  The fundamental law of the State is martial law.... The Government\r\n  is subject to the law of necessity, and must consult the condition\r\n  of things, rather than the preferences of men, and if so be that its\r\n  purposes are just and its measures wise, it has the right to demand\r\n  that questions of personal interest and opinion shall be subordinate\r\n  to the public good. When the national existence is at stake, and the\r\n  liberties of the people in peril, faction is treason.\r\n\r\n  The methods herein proposed submit the whole question of government\r\n  directly to the people—first, by the election of executive officers,\r\n  faithful to the Union, to be followed by a loyal representation in\r\n  both Houses of Congress; and then by a convention which will confirm\r\n  the action of the people, and recognize the principles of freedom in\r\n  the organic law. This is the wish of the President.[96]\r\n\r\nOn February 13, nine days before the election, General Banks issued an\r\norder relative to the qualifications of electors. It provided, in\r\naddition to the declarations on that subject in his proclamation, that\r\nUnion voters expelled from their homes by the public enemy might cast\r\ntheir ballots for State officers in the precincts where they temporarily\r\nresided and that qualified electors enlisted in the army or navy could\r\nvote in those precincts in which they might be found on election day. If\r\nwithout the State, then commissioners would be appointed to receive\r\ntheir ballots wherever stationed, returns to be made to General\r\nShepley.[97]\r\n\r\nFor governor three candidates were nominated—B. F. Flanders, a\r\nrepresentative of the Free State Committee; Michael Hahn, the choice of\r\nthose who approved the measures of General Banks, and J. Q. A. Fellows,\r\na pro-slavery conservative who favored “the Constitution and the Union\r\nwith the preservation of the rights of all inviolate.” The friends of\r\nHahn would deny to persons of African descent the privileges of\r\ncitizenship, whereas the supporters of Flanders generally would extend\r\nto them such rights and immunities.[98]\r\n\r\nOn Washington’s birthday, as announced in the proclamation of General\r\nBanks, an election was held in seventeen parishes, Hahn receiving 6,183,\r\nFellows 2,996 and Flanders 2,232 votes, a total of 11,411, of which 107\r\nwere cast by Louisiana soldiers stationed at Pensacola, Florida.[99]\r\n\r\nWriting February 25 to the President General Banks says:\r\n\r\n  The election of the 22d of February was conducted with great spirit\r\n  and propriety. No complaint is heard from any quarter, so far as I\r\n  know, of unfairness or undue influence on the part of the officers\r\n  of the Government. At some of the strictly military posts the entire\r\n  vote of the Louisiana men was for Mr. Flanders, at others for Mr.\r\n  Hahn, according to the inclination of the voters. Every voter\r\n  accepted the oath prescribed by your proclamation of the 8th of\r\n  December.... The ordinary vote of the State has been less than forty\r\n  thousand. The proportion given on the 22d of February is nearly\r\n  equal to the territory covered by our arms.[100]\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Free State General Committee in a protest pronounced\r\nthe result of the election “the registration of a military edict,” and\r\n“worthy of no respect from the representatives and Executive of the\r\nnation.” To the question whether this election had in the meaning of the\r\nPresident reëstablished a State government they promptly answered in the\r\nnegative, for the commanding general recognized the Louisiana\r\nconstitution of 1852 and ordered an election under it in which the votes\r\nof the people had nothing to do with reëstablishing government; his\r\nproclamation, by recognizing the existence of the old constitution, made\r\nthe reëstablishment beforehand for them. The Governor and\r\nLieutenant-Governor, together with the other executive officers chosen,\r\ndid not, they argued, constitute a State government; for all the\r\nconstitutions of Louisiana, including that of 1852, described the\r\ngovernment as consisting of three departments: executive, legislative\r\nand judicial.\r\n\r\nThough not avowed, the reason of Banks’ failure to order an election for\r\nmembers of the Legislature was plain, for there was not, they claimed,\r\nwithin the Union lines a sufficient number of parishes to elect a\r\nmajority of that body, and less than a majority was, by the\r\nconstitution, not a quorum to do business; so that no officer elected\r\ncould be legally paid, for that could be done by only a legal\r\nappropriation. The same constitution, they said further, provided that\r\nJustices of the Supreme and District Courts, as well as justices of the\r\npeace, should be elected by the people. The present incumbents had been\r\nsimply appointed by General Shepley. Should Mr. Hahn under pretence of\r\nbeing civil governor undertake to appoint judicial officers, the act\r\nwould be a mere usurpation.\r\n\r\nNot only, they declared, had no State government been established by\r\nthis election, but still further, the proclamation of the President had\r\nnot in the matter of electors been complied with; for Article XII. of\r\nthe constitution of 1852 says: “No soldier, seaman, or marine in the\r\narmy or navy of the United States ... shall be entitled to vote at any\r\nelection in this State.” Yet, continued the protestants, it was a\r\nnotorious fact that the general commanding permitted soldiers recruited\r\nin Louisiana, and otherwise qualified, to vote, and that many availed\r\nthemselves of the privilege. Again, they went on to say, the Legislature\r\nby act of March 20, 1856, provided for the appointment in New Orleans of\r\na register of voters whose office should be closed three days before an\r\nelection, and no one registered during that period. Now prior to the\r\nlate election, the register having closed his office according to law,\r\norders were at once given to two other officers, recorders of the city,\r\nwho had no such powers or functions by law, to register voters, which\r\nthey did night and day, and persons so registered were allowed to vote.\r\n\r\nReferring to the declared intention of General Banks to order an\r\nelection of delegates to a constitutional convention, and by a\r\nsubsequent order fix the basis of representation, the number of\r\ndelegates and the details of the election, they said: “This will put the\r\nwhole matter under military control, and the experience of the last\r\nelection shows that only such a convention can be had as the\r\novershadowing influence of the military authority will permit. Under an\r\nelection thus ordered, and a constitution thus established, a republican\r\nform of government cannot be formed. It is simply a fraud to call it the\r\nreëstablishment of a State government. In these circumstances, the only\r\ncourse left to the truly loyal citizens of Louisiana is, to protest\r\nagainst the recognition of this pretended Government, and to appeal to\r\nthe calm judgment of the nation to procure such action from Congress as\r\nwill forbid military commanders to usurp the powers which belong to\r\nCongress alone, or to the loyal people of Louisiana.”[101]\r\n\r\nBut neither the protest nor the criticism of Free State men availed to\r\narrest the march of events, and in the presence of a vast multitude\r\nMichael Hahn, who had received a majority of all the votes cast, was\r\ninaugurated Governor amidst great enthusiasm on March 4. To the oath\r\nprescribed in the amnesty and reconstruction proclamation of December 8,\r\n1863, given above, was added the following:\r\n\r\n  And I do further solemnly swear, that I am qualified according to\r\n  the constitution of the State to hold the office to which I have\r\n  been elected, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge\r\n  and perform all the duties incumbent on me as Governor of the State\r\n  of Louisiana, according to the best of my abilities and\r\n  understanding, agreeably to the Constitution and Laws of the United\r\n  States, and in support of and according to the constitution and laws\r\n  of this State, so far as they are consistent with the necessary\r\n  military occupation of the State by the troops of the United States\r\n  for the suppression of the rebellion, and the full restoration of\r\n  the authority of the United States.[102]\r\n\r\nThis language clearly indicates the legal theory upon which General\r\nBanks was proceeding, and citizens understood that Mr. Hahn represented\r\na popular power entirely subordinate to the armed occupation of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1864, the President wrote the following private letter to\r\nGovernor Hahn:\r\n\r\n  I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first\r\n  free-state governor of Louisiana. Now you are about to have a\r\n  convention, which, among other things, will probably define the\r\n  elective franchise. I barely suggest for your private consideration\r\n  whether some of the colored people may not be let in—as, for\r\n  instance, the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought\r\n  gallantly in our ranks. They would probably help, in some trying\r\n  time to come, to keep the jewel of liberty within the family of\r\n  freedom. But this is only a suggestion, not to the public, but to\r\n  you alone.[103]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this personal note Mr. Blaine says: “It was perhaps the\r\nearliest proposition from any authentic source to endow the negro with\r\nthe right of suffrage, and was an indirect but most effective answer to\r\nthose who subsequently attempted to use Mr. Lincoln’s name in support of\r\npolicies which his intimate friends instinctively knew would be\r\nabhorrent to his unerring sense of justice.”[104]\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of General Banks, the President two days later\r\ninvested Mr. Hahn until further order “with the powers exercised\r\nhitherto by the military governor of Louisiana.”[105]\r\n\r\nFrom the sentiments of the Free State party it requires little insight\r\ninto human affairs to foretell that in some manner they would soon be\r\nfound in opposition. Their candidate, Mr. B. F. Flanders, who received\r\nfewer votes than either of his competitors, was a prominent official in\r\nthe Treasury Department, and from this vantage ground, without, so far\r\nas appears, rebuke from Secretary Chase, began to stir up in Congress a\r\nfeeling of hostility to the new government in Louisiana. Precisely why\r\nMr. Lincoln decided to take into his own hands the entire subject of\r\nreconstruction may be collected without difficulty from what has already\r\nbeen said; but that this determination was confirmed by his knowledge of\r\nan alliance between the Free State leaders and the “Radicals” in\r\nCongress there can be little doubt.\r\n\r\nThe Department Commander in a general order gave notice on March 11 that\r\nan election would be held on the 28th of that month for the choice of\r\ndelegates to a State convention to meet in New Orleans “for the revision\r\nand amendment of the constitution of Louisiana.”[106] Five days later,\r\nMarch 16, Governor Hahn, in a proclamation to the sheriffs and other\r\nofficers concerned, authorized the election and commanded them to give\r\ndue notice thereof to the qualified voters of the State and to make\r\nprompt returns to the Secretary of State in New Orleans.[107]\r\n\r\nPursuant to these notices the election was held on the 28th, and\r\nresulted in the choice of ninety-seven members, two of whom were\r\nrejected because of irregular returns. The entire State was entitled to\r\n150 delegates. The parish of Orleans was represented by sixty-three\r\nmembers, leaving to the country parishes but thirty-two. Of the vote,\r\nwhich was exceedingly light, no return appears to have been published.\r\nBecause of their recent defeat no nominations were made by the Radicals,\r\nand this fact, together with heavy rains on election day, was assigned\r\nby Governor Hahn in a letter to the President as an explanation of the\r\nmeagre vote. The Parish of Ascension, which in 1860 had a population of\r\n3,940 whites, elected her delegates by 61 votes; Placquemines, which by\r\nthe same census had 2,529 white inhabitants, cast 246, while the single\r\ndelegate from Madison was chosen by only twenty-eight electors.[108]\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks informed a committee of Congress that all that section of\r\nthe State as far up as Point Coupée voted; some men from the Red River\r\ncast their ballots at Vidalia. In his statement he declared that “The\r\ncity of New Orleans is really the State of Louisiana”; yet at that time\r\nit contained less than half the population of the State.[109]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional convention, which assembled April 6, 1864, was\r\norganized on the 7th with E. H. Durell as president, and after a session\r\nof more than two and a half months adjourned July 25. A proclamation of\r\nthe Governor appointed the 5th of September as the time for taking a\r\nvote on the work of the convention. The result was 6,836 for the\r\nadoption, and 1,556 for the rejection of the constitution. Besides these\r\nthere were a number of electors who did not vote on either side of the\r\nquestion.[110]\r\n\r\nOf the work of the convention General Banks spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  In a State which held 331,726 slaves, one half of its entire\r\n  population in 1860, more than three fourths of whom had been\r\n  specially excepted from the Proclamation of Emancipation, and were\r\n  still held _de jure_ in bondage, the convention declared by a\r\n  majority of all the votes to which the State would have been\r\n  entitled if every delegate had been present from every district in\r\n  the State:—\r\n\r\n  Instantaneous, universal, uncompensated, unconditional emancipation\r\n  of slaves!\r\n\r\n  It prohibited forever the recognition of property in man!\r\n\r\n  It decreed the education of all the children, without distinction of\r\n  race or color!\r\n\r\n  It directs all men, white or black, to be enrolled as soldiers for\r\n  the public defence!\r\n\r\n  It makes all men equal before the law!\r\n\r\n  It compels, by its regenerating spirit, the ultimate recognition of\r\n  all the rights which national authority can confer upon an oppressed\r\n  race!\r\n\r\n  It wisely recognizes for the first time in constitutional history,\r\n  the interest of daily labor as an element of power entitled to the\r\n  protection of the State.[111]\r\n\r\nAt the same election, that of September 5, the following persons were\r\nchosen Representatives in Congress: M. F. Bonzano, A. P. Field, W. D.\r\nMann, T. M. Wells and R. W. Taliaferro. A Legislature was elected at the\r\nsame time, the members of which were almost entirely in favor of a free\r\nState, and by this body seven electors of President and Vice-President\r\nwere appointed. On October 10th two United States Senators were\r\nelected—R. King Cutler for the unexpired term ending March 4, 1867, and\r\nCharles Smith for the vacancy created by the resignation of Judah P.\r\nBenjamin, and ending March 4, 1865.[112]\r\n\r\nIt is matter of familiar history that the State government thus\r\norganized was never recognized by Congress. The question was presented\r\nto that body December 5, 1864, at the opening of the second session of\r\nthe Thirty-eighth Congress, when the claimants above named appeared in\r\nWashington applying for admission to seats, and again in January and\r\nFebruary, 1865, upon consideration of a joint resolution declaring\r\ncertain States not entitled to representation in the Electoral College.\r\nAs in the case of Tennessee, however, the vote offered by Louisiana was\r\nnot counted.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the President in setting up this civil government, and the\r\nsuccessive steps in its accomplishment have been related with some\r\ndegree of minuteness, so that the nature of the controversy between the\r\nExecutive and the Legislative branches of the Government may be better\r\nunderstood. Whether Mr. Lincoln exceeded his constitutional authority\r\nwill be considered when an account has been presented of the result of\r\nhis efforts to restore civil government in the States where Federal\r\nauthority had been overthrown.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Ann.

Her\r\ngeographical position classed her with the Western, her productions\r\nbound up her interests with the Southern, States.[113] As late as\r\nJanuary 5, 1861, resolutions opposing separate action were adopted\r\nalmost unanimously by the largest meeting ever held at Van Buren. Mr.\r\nLincoln’s election was not then deemed a sufficient cause to dissolve\r\nthe Union. Citizens of every party favored all honorable efforts for its\r\npreservation, and demonstrations to the contrary were regarded as the\r\nwork of only an extreme and inconsiderable faction.[114] So rapid,\r\nhowever, was the succession of events that scarcely two weeks had\r\nelapsed when she exhibited signs of resting uneasily in the Union; for\r\non January 16 a bill submitting to popular vote the question of holding\r\na convention passed the Legislature.[115] At the election of delegates\r\nto this assembly 23,626 votes were cast for the Union, against 17,927\r\nfor the secession, candidates. Though this convention, which assembled\r\nMarch 4, was organized by the choice of Union officers, the proposal to\r\nhold it had been carried by a majority of 11,586 in the election of\r\nFebruary 18. While secession was strongly urged, a conditional ordinance\r\nwas defeated by a vote of 39 to 35.[116] At Van Buren and Fort Smith\r\nsalutes of thirty-nine guns were fired in honor of the loyal members.\r\nThe inaugural of President Lincoln, received two days after organizing,\r\nproduced a somewhat unfavorable impression. On the 17th an ordinance,\r\nreported by a self-constituted committee of seven secessionists and\r\nseven coöperationists, was unanimously adopted.[117] This provided for\r\nan election on the first Monday of August, when the qualified voters in\r\nthe State could cast their ballots either for “secession” or\r\n“coöperation.” The result, though not wholly satisfactory to either\r\nparty, afforded time for deliberation.\r\n\r\nTidings of the fall of Sumter, together with the President’s\r\nproclamation and a requisition for troops from the Secretary of War,\r\ninterrupted the brief interval of repose following the adjournment of\r\nthe convention. In these circumstances the State was compelled to make a\r\nchoice of sides. Governor Rector’s reply, April 22, to this requisition\r\nshows him to have been ardently in favor of disunion; the president of\r\nthe convention, concurring in this sentiment, issued a call for that\r\nbody to reassemble May 6, when an ordinance of secession was promptly\r\npassed with but one dissenting vote.[118] By a resolution the convention\r\nauthorized the Governor to call out, if necessary, 60,000 men, and\r\nordered the issue of $2,000,000 in bonds. Another ordinance confiscated\r\ndebts due to persons in non-slaveholding States.[119]\r\n\r\nThe first military movement, after the ordinance of secession had been\r\ncarried, aimed to secure Federal property within the State, and their\r\nvalue to the South singled out for seizure the arsenals at Fort Smith\r\nand Little Rock. The latter city on February 5 was thrown into a great\r\nturmoil of confusion and excitement by the unexpected arrival of a body\r\nof troops from Helena with the avowed purpose of taking the arsenal;\r\nmore soldiers arrived during that and the succeeding day until about 400\r\nhad assembled. Though the Governor, in response to their inquiry,\r\ninformed the city council that this force was not there by his order,\r\nthe troops believed they were acting under his command; at any rate they\r\ncame to take the arsenal and were not to be diverted from their object.\r\nTo prevent a collision, which must have followed a refusal of the\r\ncommanding officer to surrender to a body of men disavowed by their\r\nGovernor, the latter was easily persuaded to assume the responsibility\r\nof the movement and he consented to demand its surrender in the name of\r\nthe State. This demand Captain Totten asked until three o’clock the next\r\nday to consider; then he made known his readiness to evacuate the\r\narsenal, which about noon of the following day was delivered to the\r\nState authorities.[120]\r\n\r\nThe delegates of Arkansas on May 18 took their seats in the Confederate\r\nCongress.[121] The convention, it will be observed, assumed at the\r\noutset the functions of a law-making body, and, because of further\r\nextending its authority by the appointment of a Military Board, soon\r\ncame into conflict with both the Governor and the Legislature. When the\r\nconvention empowered the former to call out, if necessary, 60,000 men it\r\ndivided the State into two districts, an eastern and a western. General\r\nBradley was elected to the command of the former and General Pearce,\r\nlate of the United States Army, to that of the latter division. Before\r\nGeneral McCulloch, stationed in the Indian Territory, could assume any\r\noffensive operations the Federal General, Lyon, in pursuit of Jackson,\r\napproached the southern boundary of Missouri; upon this the Military\r\nBoard called out ten regiments for defence. On June 21 it despatched to\r\nRichmond a messenger who proposed to transfer to the Confederate\r\nGovernment all the State troops with their arms making, however, a\r\ncondition precedent: they were to be employed for the protection of\r\nArkansas; but as the Secretary of State could make no promise as to\r\ntheir future disposition the transfer was not then effected.[122] On\r\nJuly 4 a second effort was made by a member of the Military Board who\r\nvisited General Hardee, with whom an arrangement was completed by which\r\na vote should be taken among the troops. If a majority of each company\r\nconsented, those so consenting were to be turned over as a company. If a\r\nmajority declined, the company was to be disbanded altogether. One\r\nentire company was thus mustered out, and from various motives two or\r\nthree hundred soldiers returned home. This was from the eastern\r\ndivision. The western was not so easily disposed of. The Military Board\r\nafter the battle of Springfield directed General Pearce to turn over his\r\nforce to Hardee, who became angry when the agent proposed to submit the\r\nquestion of transfer, and refused to allow it to be done; this\r\ninsubordinate conduct he followed up by writing an abusive letter to the\r\nBoard. Pearce then separated his troops from McCulloch’s command and\r\nmarched them back to Arkansas, where they were informally disbanded and\r\nsent home. Fearing such a result, the Board had ordered General Pearce\r\nto do nothing further in the matter, but their despatches arrived too\r\nlate.[123]\r\n\r\nGovernor Rector’s account shows Arkansas troops, claimed to be 22,000 in\r\nnumber, to have been at that time in a state of complete\r\ndemoralization.[124] The Germans and the Irish, as well as their\r\ndescendants, showing little inclination to enlist, the Governor ascribed\r\ntheir indifference to a want of opportunity for promotion in the\r\nservice. If this was not the cause, then, he thought, authority should\r\nbe given to draft a regiment of each race.[125]\r\n\r\nMore than a third of the voting population was in the field, and as late\r\nas October they had received no pay except Arkansas war bonds, the\r\nworthlessness of which occasioned much murmuring. This discontent was\r\nheightened somewhat by the poor equipment of the regiments, many\r\nsoldiers being without blankets or shoes.[126] There were other symptoms\r\nof unrest within the State. On the charge of attempted insurrection two\r\nnegro men and a girl were hanged in Monroe County.\r\n\r\nAll this occasioned much uneasiness, but the chief cause of alarm was\r\nthe Union sentiment known to exist in the State. In October twenty-seven\r\npersons were brought to Little Rock as members of a secret Union\r\norganization in Van Buren County and placed in jail to await a civil\r\ntrial. Many others also were taken about this time, and it was estimated\r\nthat the “Peace and Constitutional Society” numbered 1,700 members in\r\nArkansas.[127]\r\n\r\nThe activity of Federal armies in the West excited so much apprehension\r\nthat Governor Rector on the 18th of February, by proclamation, called\r\ninto immediate service every man in the State subject to military\r\nduty.[128] A Confederate force under Price was driven into Arkansas by\r\nGeneral Curtis on the same day, and within a week the commandant at\r\nPocahontas issued an appeal to every man “to turn out promptly, shoulder\r\nhis musket, and drive the vandals from the State.” The Richmond\r\nGovernment being unable to assist Arkansas, she was forced to rely upon\r\nher own resources and such aid as might be obtained from Missouri, the\r\nIndian Territory and Texas.[129]\r\n\r\nDisaster and a conviction of neglect led the Governor in May, in an\r\naddress to the people, to express his indignation and threaten to secede\r\nfrom secession. He said:\r\n\r\n  If the arteries of the Confederate heart do not permeate beyond the\r\n  east bank of the Mississippi, let southern Missourians, Arkansians,\r\n  Texans and the great West know it and prepare for the future.\r\n  Arkansas lost, abandoned, subjugated is not Arkansas as she entered\r\n  the Confederate Government. Nor will she remain Arkansas, a\r\n  Confederate State, desolated as a wilderness. Her children, fleeing\r\n  from the wrath to come, will build them a new ark, and launch it on\r\n  new waters, seeking a haven somewhere of equality, safety and\r\n  rest.[130]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Pea Ridge General Curtis moved to White River, and\r\non May 1 occupied Batesville, where he witnessed many demonstrations of\r\nattachment to the Union. Judges of courts, clergymen and other leading\r\ncitizens came forward and voluntarily took the oath of allegiance to the\r\nUnited States. A threatened advance of the Union forces upon Little Rock\r\ncreated the greatest excitement there, and the Governor by proclamation\r\nordered the militia to repair immediately to its defence; but not\r\nfinding himself sufficiently supported he fled.[131] The concentration\r\nat Corinth of all available Confederate strength was the cause of the\r\nweakness of Arkansas at this time. Ten regiments had also been withdrawn\r\nfrom the army of General Curtis to reënforce the Federal troops in\r\nMississippi. This left him in no condition to march upon the State\r\ncapital, and for the time it was saved. Twelve thousand poorly equipped\r\nmen had assembled there in response to the appeal of Governor Rector.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Helena by Federal troops Mr. Lincoln appointed\r\nJohn S. Phelps, of Missouri, military governor.[132] On August 19, 1862,\r\nhe left St. Louis for Helena; but as the contemplated movement was not\r\nthen made his office was of little importance. From the Union refugees\r\nat that point two regiments of Arkansas men were organized. The fall of\r\nVicksburg in July, 1863, however, enabled the Union army to assume\r\noffensive operations, and the summer had not greatly advanced before a\r\nstrong column was moving on Little Rock, the capture of which, September\r\n10, 1863, was a fatal blow to Confederate authority throughout the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAmidst all its distresses the northern section of Arkansas had\r\nmaintained its loyalty. Recent reverses to Confederate arms encouraged\r\ndesertion from their ranks, Union sympathizers became active, and\r\nmovements begun by them were joined by numbers who now regarded the\r\nConfederate cause as lost. Many, however, fearing a restoration of that\r\nauthority, hesitated to identify themselves with the more pronounced\r\nloyalists. A newspaper favorable to the General Government was\r\nestablished at the capital. Meetings were held, and resolutions pledging\r\nunconditional support of the Union cause adopted. Citizens, both white\r\nand black, were organized, and by December, 1863, eight regiments of\r\nArkansas troops had enlisted in the Federal service.[133]\r\n\r\nA still more encouraging symptom was the return of eminent persons who\r\nnow came forward to advocate the Union cause. Prominent among these was\r\nBrigadier-General E. W. Gantt, of the Confederate army, recently a\r\nprisoner of war and pardoned under the Amnesty Proclamation of the\r\nPresident. Toward the close of 1863 he thus describes the feeling of the\r\npeople:\r\n\r\n  The Union sentiment is manifesting itself on all sides and by every\r\n  indication—in Union meetings—in desertions from the Confederate\r\n  army—in taking the oath of allegiance unsolicited—in organizing for\r\n  home defence, and enlisting in the Federal army. Old flags that have\r\n  been hid in the crevices of rocks, and been worshipped by our\r\n  mountain people as holy relics, are flung to the breeze, and\r\n  followed to the Union army with an enthusiasm that beggars all\r\n  description. The little county of Perry, that votes only about 600,\r\n  and which has been turned wrong side out in search of conscripts by\r\n  Hindman and his fellow-murderers and oppressors, with their retinue\r\n  of salaried gentlemen and negro boys, sent down a company of\r\n  ninety-four men. Where they came from, and how they kept their old\r\n  flag during these three years of terror, persecution and plunder, I\r\n  can’t tell. But they were the proudest-looking set of men I ever\r\n  saw, and full of fight.[134]\r\n\r\nThe retreat of General Banks from the Red River country changed greatly\r\nthe aspect of Federal affairs in Arkansas, for it allowed all the\r\nConfederate forces in the vicinity to concentrate against the small army\r\nof General Steele, compelling him to act on the defensive at Little\r\nRock. The State coming once more to a considerable extent under\r\nConfederate control, loyalists became scarce and gradually lost energy\r\nand hope.\r\n\r\nLocal reverses, however, were not allowed to interrupt the comprehensive\r\npolicy of the President, and early in 1864 preparations were made to\r\nreorganize the State government. This movement, like those in Tennessee\r\nand Louisiana, was based upon the Amnesty and Reconstruction\r\nProclamation of December 8, 1863. Even before this step had been taken\r\nthe President was already moulding the diverse elements into a power\r\nthat would ultimately undermine Confederate influence in the State. In\r\nthe preceding summer, July 31, 1863, he had written General S. A.\r\nHurlbut:\r\n\r\n  I understand that Senator Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of offering\r\n  to resume his place in the Senate. Of course the Senate, and not I,\r\n  would decide whether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel\r\n  great interest in the question. It may be so presented as to be one\r\n  of the very greatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so\r\n  presented as to be of no more than temporary personal consequence to\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  The emancipation proclamation applies to Arkansas.... I think I\r\n  shall not retract or repudiate it. Those who shall have tasted\r\n  actual freedom I believe can never be slaves or quasi-slaves again.\r\n  For the rest, I believe some plan substantially being gradual\r\n  emancipation would be better for both white and black. The Missouri\r\n  plan, recently adopted, I do not object to on account of the time\r\n  for ending the institution; but I am sorry the beginning should have\r\n  been postponed for seven years, leaving all that time to agitate for\r\n  the repeal of the whole thing. It should begin at once, giving at\r\n  least the new-born a vested interest in freedom which could not be\r\n  taken away. If Senator Sebastian could come with something of this\r\n  sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his\r\n  case; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the\r\n  world so great a service. See him, if you can, and read this to him;\r\n  but charge him to not make it public for the present.[135]\r\n\r\nUnion officers in the West were urged by Mr. Lincoln in October, 1862,\r\nto assist and encourage repentant rebel communities to elect both State\r\nofficers and members of Congress.[136] As this involved a recognition of\r\nexisting governments it need scarcely be observed that the march of\r\nevents forced the President later to occupy somewhat different ground;\r\nnor is it more necessary to add, that to his main purpose, to undermine\r\nsecession and restore the Union, he adhered inflexibly. With this\r\nfundamental object all his acts harmonize.\r\n\r\nAt the time of her secession, W. K. Sebastian represented Arkansas in\r\nthe United States Senate and abandoned his seat; he was now ready to\r\nassist in restoring his State to her old status. Of these evidences of\r\ndisintegration in Confederate interests within the State the President\r\nwas very exactly informed, and it was because of his conviction that\r\nmany persons hitherto supporting that cause were either wavering in\r\ntheir allegiance or had become hostile to secession that he wrote,\r\nJanuary 5, 1864, to General Steele:\r\n\r\n  I wish to afford the people of Arkansas an opportunity of taking the\r\n  oath prescribed in the proclamation of December 8, 1863, preparatory\r\n  to reorganizing a State Government there. Accordingly I send you by\r\n  General Kimball some blank books and other blanks, the manner of\r\n  using which will, in the main, be suggested by an inspection of\r\n  them; and General Kimball will add some verbal explanations.\r\n\r\n  Please make a trial of the matter immediately at such points as you\r\n  may think likely to give success. I suppose Helena and Little Rock\r\n  are two of them. Detail any officer you may see fit to take charge\r\n  of the subject at each point; and which officer, it may be assumed,\r\n  will have authority to administer the oath. These books, of course,\r\n  are intended to be permanent records. Report to me on the\r\n  subject.[137]\r\n\r\nA week had scarcely elapsed when Mr. Lincoln approved the suggestions of\r\nGeneral Banks relative to reinaugurating a civil government for\r\nLouisiana, and, doubtless, he knew no reason why similar work might not\r\nbe going on simultaneously in Arkansas; therefore he repeated to General\r\nSteele what in substance he had already communicated to the Federal\r\ncommander of the Department of the Gulf. His instructions, dated January\r\n20, 1864, and quoted below, are self-explanatory, and in no important\r\nparticular differ from the Louisiana Plan:\r\n\r\n  Sundry citizens of the State of Arkansas petition me that an\r\n  election may be held in that State, at which to elect a governor\r\n  thereof; ... that it be assumed at said election and thenceforward\r\n  that the constitution and laws of the State, as before the\r\n  rebellion, are in full force, except that the constitution is so\r\n  modified as to declare that “there shall be neither slavery nor\r\n  involuntary servitude, except in the punishment for crime whereof\r\n  the party shall have been duly convicted; but the General Assembly\r\n  may make such provision for the free people as shall recognize and\r\n  declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and\r\n  which may yet be consistent, as a temporary arrangement, with their\r\n  present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class;” and\r\n  also except that all now existing laws in relation to slaves are\r\n  inoperative and void; that said election to be held on the\r\n  twenty-eighth day of March next at all the usual voting places of\r\n  the State, or all such as voters may attend for that purpose; that\r\n  the voters attending at each place at 8 o’clock in the morning of\r\n  said day, may choose judges and clerks of election for that place;\r\n  that all persons qualified by said constitution and laws, and taking\r\n  the oath prescribed in the President’s proclamation of December the\r\n  8th, 1863, either before or at the election, and none others, may be\r\n  voters, provided that persons having the qualifications aforesaid,\r\n  and being in the volunteer military service of the United States,\r\n  may vote once wherever they may be at voting places; that each set\r\n  of judges and clerks may make return directly to you on or before\r\n  the eleventh day of April next; that in all other respects said\r\n  election may be conducted according to said modified constitution\r\n  and laws; that on receipt of said returns, you count said votes, and\r\n  that if the number shall reach or exceed five thousand four hundred\r\n  and six, you canvass said votes and ascertain who shall thereby\r\n  appear to have been elected governor; and that on the eighteenth day\r\n  of April next, the person so appearing to have been elected, and\r\n  appearing before you at Little Rock to have, by you, administered to\r\n  him an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and\r\n  said modified constitution of the State of Arkansas, and actually\r\n  taking said oath, be, by you, declared qualified, and be enjoined to\r\n  immediately enter upon the duties of the office of governor of said\r\n  State; and that you thereupon declare the constitution of the State\r\n  of Arkansas to have been modified and amended as aforesaid by the\r\n  action of the people as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  You will please order an election immediately, and perform the other\r\n  parts assigned you, with necessary incidentals, all according to the\r\n  foregoing.[138]\r\n\r\nBy discussion and organization the elements opposed to the Richmond\r\nGovernment aroused so much enthusiasm that Unionists anticipated the\r\nwishes of the President by meeting, January 8, 1864, in convention at\r\nLittle Rock. This assembly, composed of forty-four delegates\r\nrepresenting, as they claimed, twenty-two of the fifty-four counties in\r\nthe State, was made up of members elected at various mass meetings by\r\nvery meagre votes. This at least was an objection then urged by those\r\nwho were adverse to the purposes of the convention. They further stated\r\nthat many of the counties represented were without the Federal military\r\nlines. It was admitted that if these counties lay beyond Union lines\r\nneither were they occupied by Confederate forces, and that generally the\r\ndelegates were gentlemen of character and patriotism.[139]\r\n\r\nIn a published address the convention stated frankly:\r\n\r\n  We found after remaining at Little Rock about a week, under a\r\n  temporary organization, that delegates were present from twenty-two\r\n  counties, elected by the people, and that six other counties had\r\n  held elections, and that their representatives were looked for\r\n  daily. We then organized the Convention permanently, and determined\r\n  that while we could not properly claim to be the people of Arkansas\r\n  in Convention assembled, with full and final authority to adopt a\r\n  constitution, yet, being the representatives, by election, of a\r\n  considerable portion of the State, and understanding, as we\r\n  believed, the sentiment of nearly all our citizens who desire the\r\n  immediate benefits of a government under the authority of the United\r\n  States, we also determined to present a constitution and plan of\r\n  organization, which, if adopted by them, becomes at once their act\r\n  as effectually as if every county in the State had been represented\r\n  in the Convention.[140]\r\n\r\nAn amended constitution was adopted by this convention on January 22. By\r\nit the act of secession was declared null and void; slavery was\r\nabolished immediately and unconditionally, and the Confederate debt\r\nwholly repudiated.[141] These important changes in the fundamental law\r\nof the State indicate the sentiments of the delegates. Isaac Murphy was\r\nappointed Provisional Governor; C. C. Bliss, Lieutenant-Governor and R.\r\nT. J. White, Secretary of State. These officers were inaugurated on the\r\nsame day that the convention adopted the constitution; this by its\r\nschedule was to be submitted to a popular vote at an election to be held\r\nMarch 14, when State officers and Representatives in Congress would also\r\nbe chosen.[142]\r\n\r\nIgnorant that the movement to restore a civil government had proceeded\r\nso far, Mr. Lincoln had sent his instructions to General Steele. As\r\nthese had been carefully considered it was feared the work of the\r\nconvention would differ in some essential particular from the plan\r\noutlined for the Federal commander. To prevent such a consequence the\r\nPresident wrote General Steele again on January 27 as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have addressed a letter to you and put it in the hands of Mr.\r\n  Gantt and other Arkansas gentlemen, containing a program for an\r\n  election in that State. This letter will be handed you by some of\r\n  these gentlemen. Since writing it, I see that a Convention in\r\n  Arkansas having the same general object, has taken some action,\r\n  which I am afraid may clash somewhat with my program. I therefore\r\n  can do no better than to ask you to see Mr. Gantt immediately on his\r\n  return, and with him do what you and he may deem necessary to\r\n  harmonize the two plans into one, and then put it through with all\r\n  possible vigor. Be sure to retain the free-State Constitutional\r\n  provision in some unquestionable form and you and he can fix the\r\n  rest. The points I have made in the program have been well\r\n  considered. Take hold with an honest heart and a strong hand. Do not\r\n  let any questionable man control or influence you.[143]\r\n\r\nThe President’s interest in the proceedings of the convention and his\r\nanxiety about the outcome of its deliberations appear in a letter to\r\nGeneral Steele written three days after the above.[144] So favorable\r\nwere his impressions of the progress reported that he believed the best\r\nhis subordinate could do “would be to help them on their own plan”; of\r\nthis, however, General Steele, who was on the ground, was to be the\r\njudge. To Governor Murphy he telegraphed, February 6, that his order\r\nconcerning an election was made in ignorance of any action which the\r\nconvention might take; also that his subsequent communication to General\r\nSteele directed that officer to assist, not to hinder, the\r\ndelegates.[145] General Thayer also was informed that the apparent\r\nconflict between the President and the convention was altogether\r\naccidental.[146] On February 17, Mr. Lincoln explained the situation\r\nmore fully to William M. Fishback:\r\n\r\n  When I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in\r\n  ignorance that your convention was doing the same work. Since I\r\n  learned the latter fact I have been constantly trying to yield my\r\n  plan to them. I have sent two letters to General Steele, and three\r\n  or four despatches to you and others, saying that he, General\r\n  Steele, must be master, but that it will probably be best for him to\r\n  merely help the convention on its own plan. Some single mind must be\r\n  master, else there will be no agreement in anything, and General\r\n  Steele, commanding the military and being on the ground, is the best\r\n  man to be that master. Even now citizens are telegraphing me to\r\n  postpone the election to a later day than either that fixed by the\r\n  convention or by me. This discord must be silenced.[147]\r\n\r\nThe President evidently had learned something from his recent experience\r\nwith his friends and subordinates in Louisiana. General Steele from his\r\nheadquarters at Little Rock issued on February 29 the following address\r\nto the people of Arkansas:\r\n\r\n  The convention of your citizens, held at Little Rock during the last\r\n  month [says this proclamation], has adopted a constitution and\r\n  submitted it to you for your approval or rejection. That\r\n  constitution is based upon the principles of freedom, and it is for\r\n  you now to say, by your voluntary and unbiased action, whether it\r\n  shall be your fundamental law. While it may have defects, in the\r\n  main it is in accordance with the views of that portion of the\r\n  people who have been resisting the fratricidal attempts which have\r\n  been made during the last three years. The convention has fixed the\r\n  14th day of March next on which to decide this great question, and\r\n  the General commanding is only following the instructions of the\r\n  Government when he says to you that every facility will be offered\r\n  for the expression of your sentiments, uninfluenced by any\r\n  considerations save those which affect your own interests and those\r\n  of your posterity.... The election will be held and the return be\r\n  made in accordance with the schedule adopted by the convention, and\r\n  no interference from any quarter will be allowed to prevent the free\r\n  expression of the loyal men of the State on that day.[148]\r\n\r\nThe election pursuant to this notice began March 14, 1864, the polls\r\nremaining open for three days. For the constitution 12,177, and against\r\nit 226, votes were cast.[149] Isaac Murphy, against whom there was no\r\nopposing candidate, was chosen Governor by 12,430 votes cast by the\r\ncitizens of more than forty counties. As early as March 18 the President\r\nappears to have received from the Governor-elect some favorable\r\ntidings,[150] and on April 27, when more complete returns had reached\r\nhim from the same source, he expressed in a telegram his gratification\r\nat the large vote, more than double that required by the Louisiana Plan,\r\nand also at the intelligence that the State government, including the\r\nLegislature, was organized and in working order.[151]\r\n\r\nBesides a Governor five other officers of the executive and several\r\nmembers of the judicial branch of government together with many county\r\nofficials were chosen.[152] At the same time three Representatives in\r\nCongress, T. M. Jacks, A. A. C. Rogers and J. M. Johnson, were elected\r\nfrom the First, Second and Third Districts respectively. The\r\nLegislature, composed of twenty-three Senators and fifty-nine members of\r\nAssembly, met on the 11th of April, and during the session, which ended\r\nJune 1 succeeding, appointed William Fishback and Elisha Baxter United\r\nStates Senators to fill vacancies caused by the secession of the late\r\nincumbents, R. W. Johnson and William K. Sebastian. After investigation\r\nby a committee of Congress, however, they were declared not entitled to\r\nseats; but as each possessed such a title to membership as to justify\r\ninquiry they were paid mileage. This consideration they were denied\r\nwhen, without new action, they subsequently presented themselves at a\r\nspecial session of the Senate; on that occasion they were accompanied by\r\nWilliam D. Snow, who had been chosen to succeed Fishback. It was agreed,\r\nMarch 9, 1865, to postpone till the next session of Congress\r\nconsideration of the credentials of Mr. Snow. The House, without\r\nadmitting as Representatives the three claimants for seats, had\r\nconsented to allow them mileage. Arkansas, unlike Louisiana and\r\nTennessee, did not participate in the Presidential election of 1864,\r\nbecause of a feeling that its electoral vote would not be received even\r\nif offered. This course appears to have been adopted on the suggestion\r\nof their representatives, who returned with such a conviction from a\r\nsojourn in Washington.[153]\r\n\r\nA succeeding chapter, in tracing the origin and progress of the\r\ncontroversy between the Executive and Legislative branches of\r\nGovernment, will describe more fully the attitude of Congress toward Mr.\r\nLincoln’s efforts at reconstruction and afford an opportunity for\r\ndiscussing both the nature of the conventions by which civil government\r\nhad been restored in Tennessee, Louisiana and Arkansas, and the\r\nconstitutionality of the various Executive acts by which this\r\nreëstablishment was assisted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  Ann.

The earliest indications of the policy adopted may\r\nbe discerned in the case of Virginia, which presents the only instance\r\nof a people in any of the insurrectionary States organizing open\r\nresistance to revolution. All departments of government in that\r\nCommonwealth having gone over to rebellion, the loyal minority were left\r\nwithout any organization for the conduct of domestic affairs. In these\r\ncircumstances they called a convention which by an original act of\r\nsovereignty reconstituted the government. The progress of the conflict\r\nwas attended in that State by consequences not elsewhere observed, and\r\nit is chiefly because of this fact that a slight departure from exact\r\nchronological order is believed to be justified. The principles which\r\nguided the Administration will be easily comprehended by considering\r\ntheir application to the novel and somewhat embarrassing questions that\r\narose before rebellion was finally crushed within the borders of that\r\nonce glorious Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n“The Convention of Virginia” which, by authority of the Legislature,\r\nassembled at Richmond, February 13, 1861, passed on April 17 following\r\nan ordinance of secession from the United States.[154] Though the\r\ninjunction of secrecy was never removed from this proceeding, the tally,\r\ndiscovered soon after among the private papers of a member, shows that\r\n88 delegates favored and 55 opposed the measure; one was excused from\r\nvoting, eight were either absent or silent.[155] This strong opposition\r\nis explained in part by the physical characteristics of the State.\r\n\r\nThe principal chain of the Alleghanies formed in the western portion of\r\nthe Old Dominion a lofty range which parts the streams finding their way\r\ninto the Ohio and the Potomac from those that reach the lower waters of\r\nChesapeake Bay or the sounds of North Carolina. The country southeast of\r\nthis ridge, including the Shenandoah Valley, the Piedmont district, the\r\nmiddle division and the tide-water region, contained about three fourths\r\nof the white inhabitants, and something less than three fourths of the\r\narea, of Virginia. In this section were found many large tobacco\r\nplantations cultivated almost exclusively by negroes. Indeed, it was in\r\nthe light soil of the tide-water counties of Virginia that English\r\nsettlers in America first attempted, nearly two and one half centuries\r\nbefore, the memorable experiment of African slave labor. Soon after\r\n1808, when their importation was prohibited by act of Congress, slaves\r\nwere bred in Virginia to supply the demand of Southern markets, and by\r\n1860 the bondmen in that Commonwealth had become almost two thirds as\r\nnumerous as the master race.[156] It is sufficiently accurate to say\r\nthat the triangular district bounded on the north by the winding course\r\nof the Potomac, by the parallel of 36° 31′ on the south and stretching\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the crest of the Alleghany mountains, comprised all\r\nthat part of “the good old commonwealth” which was then either\r\nhistorically important or interesting. This prolific soil was the\r\nbirthplace of many of America’s most illustrious sons; its inhabitants\r\nfor the most part were proud to trace their descent from the earliest\r\nsettlers along the James; many were wealthy, and all had long been\r\ndistinguished for their hospitality.\r\n\r\nBeyond this favored region the country, which slopes gradually down to\r\nthe upper Potomac and the Ohio, is marked by a succession of parallel\r\nranges separated by fertile valleys; but like the large tract which\r\nencircled the Adirondacks and a similar one in northern Pennsylvania,\r\nthe Virginian wilderness remained untouched by the ceaseless tide of\r\nimmigration which at the close of the Revolution swept westward from the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. For this uninviting region the second Federal census\r\nindicates less than two inhabitants to the square mile; by 1810 pioneers\r\nfrom the line of the Ohio river encroached on its silent forests. At the\r\nnext census, however, a portion was still unoccupied, but in the\r\nsucceeding decennial period it received from various points, chiefly\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, Ohio and New England, many enterprising and thrifty\r\nsettlers. The sixth census, that of 1840, represents the entire tract as\r\nsparsely inhabited.[157] Its abundant resources, then but little\r\ndeveloped, subsequently gave rise to a great variety of profitable\r\nindustries, and it advanced rapidly in population. Extensive\r\nplantations, however, were few; the number of slaves, owing somewhat to\r\nthe facility for escape, had always been small, and in the ten years\r\npreceding the outbreak of hostilities had actually diminished by upwards\r\nof two thousand.[158] Though it then contained nearly one fourth of the\r\nwhites, it included no more than one thirtieth of the negroes in the\r\nState. Their labor, too, except in other than agricultural occupations,\r\nafforded little remuneration. In consequence of its productions as well\r\nas its location both the interests and sympathies of the people were\r\nwith the adjoining States of Ohio and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from geographical considerations, northwestern Virginia had a\r\ngrievance of long standing: for years its inhabitants had complained\r\nthat they were not fairly represented in the Legislature, and the\r\nimmunity from taxation enjoyed by their fellow-citizens east of the\r\nmountains was a discrimination too gross to escape attention. The slave\r\noligarchy, they declared, possessed and wielded for its own advantage\r\nthe political power of the State. The question of its dismemberment had\r\nbeen discussed as early as 1829–30, when the mountain sons of Virginia\r\nwere on the verge of revolution. The East then yielded a pittance of\r\npower, which, though far short of the demands of justice, reconciled\r\nwestern Virginians for the time. In 1850 they were again on the point of\r\ninsurrection. On this occasion adequate representation was conceded in\r\nthe lower though withheld in the upper chamber of the General Assembly,\r\nthe dominant party thus retaining control of that body as well as the\r\nbenefits of a constitutional provision by which slaves under the age of\r\ntwelve years were exempt from taxation, and of those liable to\r\nassessment none could be valued at more than three hundred dollars even\r\nif worth in the market a thousand dollars or upwards.[159] Moreover,\r\nmuch of the public revenue was expended upon internal improvements for\r\nthe eastern section of the State. The Shenandoah Valley, at one time\r\nshowing signs of discontent, was bound by the construction of railways,\r\nin social as well as in commercial life, more firmly to Richmond. In\r\nshort, the Alleghanies formed a barrier almost completely cutting off\r\nintercourse between the two divisions. Their relations were well\r\nexpressed by Governor Pierpont, who told Senator Wade that there was no\r\ncommunication whatever between the people except the furnishing a few\r\nmembers to the Legislature and a few inmates of the penitentiary.[160]\r\nTheir different interests tended to alienate the sections; the hand of\r\nnature had traced the line of separation.\r\n\r\nNow, however, that a crisis was impending, the Richmond authorities, to\r\nharmonize every element within their Commonwealth, were willing to\r\nforego this privilege; to share the burdens of State administration, to\r\nmeet State liabilities, and generally to place themselves on a footing\r\nof equality with their fellow-citizens along the Ohio. This concession,\r\nby a majority of 50,000, was actually extorted in an election from the\r\nprudence or the fears of disunionists whose magnanimity was duly\r\nemphasized by Governor Letcher in an appeal to the people of the\r\nnorthwest.[161] The latter refused, notwithstanding, to acquiesce in the\r\naction of the secession convention which, so far as it was able to do\r\nso, carried their State, as a political organization, out of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt may be affirmed generally that the professional politicians and large\r\nproperty owners of this region were disloyal;[162] State officials with\r\nsurprising unanimity were ardent advocates of secession and active in\r\ncommitting their Commonwealth to its support. An overwhelming proportion\r\nof the plain people, however, were devotedly attached to the Union and\r\ndetermined on its preservation. Therefore when the Richmond State\r\ngovernment attempted to execute its laws in these parts it encountered\r\nthe most spirited resistance. Especially was this true in the Pan Handle\r\ncounties, where opposition was promptly organized.\r\n\r\nProbably the first consultation upon the grave questions that had arisen\r\nwas held at the Court House in Wellsburgh, Brooke County, where a large\r\nnumber of citizens from that and the adjacent county of Hancock\r\nassembled to hear the report of Mr. Campbell Tarr, their delegate to\r\nRichmond. From Harrison came Hon. John S. Carlile, who, like Mr. Tarr,\r\nnarrowly escaped with his life from that city, where he had represented\r\nhis county in the convention. They reported the proceedings of that body\r\nand urged immediate preparation to resist. As a result of this\r\ndiscussion a committee of four was appointed to procure arms and\r\nammunition in Washington. _En route_ thither they had an interview at\r\nHarrisburg with Governor Curtin, who not only expressed sympathy with\r\ntheir object, but promised assistance if necessary. On arriving at the\r\nnational capital they called upon Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, who was a\r\nnative of Steubenville, Ohio, and a warm personal friend of each member\r\nof the committee. They were immediately presented to Mr. Cameron,\r\nSecretary of War, who, on learning the purpose of their visit,\r\nmanifested some hesitation as to his legal right to comply with their\r\nrequest. Upon this Mr. Stanton declared with emphasis that “the law of\r\n_necessity_ gives the right,” and added, “let them have arms and\r\nammunition; we will look for the book law afterwards.”[163] Two thousand\r\nrifles with suitable ammunition were then furnished, and as security for\r\ntheir proper use Mr. Stanton tendered his own name. From Wellsburgh,\r\nwhere they were temporarily kept in expectation of a rebel attack, these\r\narms were sent for distribution to Wheeling.\r\n\r\nUnited States troops from Ohio and Indiana together with local\r\nvolunteers soon drove the Confederate forces from this region, and\r\nsubsequently, though often menaced, it was almost exempt from the\r\nravages of war.[164] Thus encouraged, Union men resolved to form a\r\npolitical organization coextensive with Virginia or to establish a\r\nseparate and distinct State. Preliminary movements toward that end were\r\npromptly inaugurated, and, April 22, 1861, five days after the passage\r\nof the ordinance, nearly 1,200 citizens of Clarksburgh denounced in a\r\npublic meeting the action of the secession convention and recommended\r\nthe people of northwestern Virginia to assemble on May 13 at Wheeling.\r\nOn the 4th a Union mass meeting had been held at Kingwood, near the\r\nnorthern border. The separation of western from eastern Virginia was\r\ndeclared by this body to be essential to the maintenance of their\r\nliberties. They also resolved to elect a Representative to Congress. On\r\nthe following day there convened at Wheeling another assemblage, which\r\nconsidered the question of separating from that portion of the State in\r\nrebellion. About the same time other gatherings were held in different\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThere were thousands of eager and earnest patriots in the city of\r\nWheeling on May 13, when nearly four hundred delegates, mostly appointed\r\nby primary meetings, and representing twenty-six counties, assembled to\r\ndeliberate on the situation. The best method of organizing opposition to\r\ntreason was the question: how to inaugurate a government which the\r\nFederal authorities would recognize and protect?[165] On this important\r\nsubject there is said to have been considerable diversity of opinion;\r\nthe decision finally reached was based upon a suggestion by one of the\r\nmembers that since Governor Letcher and other State officers, by\r\nadhering to the pretended ordinance of secession, had forfeited their\r\npowers, and the existing constitution made no provision for such an\r\nemergency, the only way was to ask the people, the source of all\r\npolitical power, to send delegates to a convention authorized to supply\r\ntheir places with loyal men. This proposal was presented to the meeting\r\nand adopted with great unanimity.[166] A General State Committee,\r\nempowered to appoint sub-committees in all counties where practicable,\r\nwas then named, and a stirring address put forth. It announced their\r\npurpose and urged all loyal citizens to elect representatives to a\r\nsecond convention. Copies of this appeal were sent to influential\r\ncitizens throughout the State, and it was agreed after a session of\r\nthree days to choose on May 26 delegates to the proposed convention.\r\n\r\nThis election having been held at the time appointed, representatives\r\nfrom nearly forty counties assembled at Wheeling on June 11. The\r\nconvention, numbering 98 members, organized by selecting for its\r\npresident Hon Arthur I. Boreman. Before proceeding to business the\r\nfollowing oath was administered to the delegation from each county: “We\r\nsolemnly declare that we will support the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and the laws made in pursuance thereof, as the supreme law of the\r\nland, anything in the Ordinance of the Convention that assembled in\r\nRichmond on the 13th day of February last to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, so help us God.”[167] The State government was\r\nreconstituted on the 13th by an ordinance declaring vacant all places,\r\nwhether legislative, executive or judicial, whose incumbents had\r\nespoused the cause of secession. This class, as already observed,\r\nincluded nearly every official in Virginia. These vacancies the\r\nconvention supplied by the appointment of loyal men. In the constitution\r\nthey made an important alteration which prescribed the number of\r\ndelegates necessary to constitute a quorum in the General Assembly. All\r\nState, county and town officials were required to take an oath of\r\nallegiance which pledged support of both the Federal Constitution and\r\nthe restored government of Virginia. On June 17 a declaration of\r\nindependence was adopted without one dissenting voice; it denounced the\r\nusurpation of the Richmond convention, which had assumed to place the\r\nresources of Virginia at the disposal of the Confederate Government, to\r\nwhich power it repudiated allegiance. Resolutions expressing a\r\ndetermination never to submit to the ordinance of secession, but to\r\nmaintain the rights of Virginia in the Union, were then passed. All\r\npersons in arms against the national Government were commanded to\r\ndisband and to return to their allegiance. Though the members seriously\r\nendeavored to reorganize their government, it was with an express\r\ndeclaration that a division of the Commonwealth was a paramount object\r\nof their labors, and they decided, June 20, by a unanimous vote in favor\r\nof ultimate separation.\r\n\r\nUnder an ordinance previously adopted Hon. Francis H. Pierpont was\r\nchosen Governor on the same day; a lieutenant-governor, an\r\nattorney-general and an executive council of five were also appointed.\r\nOther administrative offices were subsequently filled. The new\r\nincumbents were to exercise their functions for six months or until\r\nsuccessors should be elected and qualified. The convention on June 25,\r\nsubject in an emergency to be reassembled by the Governor and Council,\r\nthen adjourned to August 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this session the convention directed all members\r\nwilling to swear fealty to the Union, who were elected to the assembly\r\non May 23 preceding, to meet on the 1st of July at Wheeling. At the time\r\nof their election these representatives were destined for Richmond. In\r\naddition to those regularly chosen under the old law of the\r\nCommonwealth, others pursuant to an ordinance of the convention were\r\nelected to fill vacancies. All were to qualify themselves by taking an\r\noath or affirmation of allegiance to the United States and to the\r\nreorganized government of Virginia. These members, chiefly from the\r\nwestern counties, were to compose the law-making body, which was\r\ninvested with all the powers and duties pertaining to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nThe new Governor was inaugurated on June 20, and, after taking the oath\r\nof office, said: “We have been driven into the position we occupy to-day\r\nby the usurpers at the South, who have inaugurated this war upon the\r\nsoil of Virginia, and have made it the great Crimea of this contest. We,\r\nrepresenting the loyal citizens of Virginia, have been bound to assume\r\nthe position we have assumed to-day for the protection of ourselves, our\r\nwives, our children, and our property. We, I repeat, have been driven to\r\nassume this position; and now we are but recurring to the great\r\nfundamental principle of our fathers, that to the loyal people of a\r\nState belongs the law-making power of that State. The loyal people are\r\nentitled to the government and governmental authority of the State. And,\r\nfellow-citizens, it is the assumption of that authority upon which we\r\nare now about to enter.”[168]\r\n\r\n“It was not the object of the Wheeling convention,” he declared on a\r\nlater occasion, “to set up any new government in the State, or separate,\r\nor other government than the one under which they had always\r\nlived.”[169]\r\n\r\nFrom these utterances his hearers must have concluded that the\r\nreorganized government was not for a part but for the whole of Virginia.\r\nIndeed, it was to the discernment of Mr. Pierpont that Virginia\r\nloyalists were chiefly indebted for a legal solution of the intricate\r\nproblem that confronted them. While Carlile and others were urging a\r\ncounter-revolution, Mr. Pierpont was carefully studying the provisions\r\nof the Federal Constitution. The clause of that instrument which\r\nguarantees a republican form of government was designed, he believed, to\r\nmeet just such an emergency as had arisen. Though this conservative\r\nsuggestion was not at first received with much favor, it continued\r\ngradually to win adherents until its propriety was universally\r\nrecognized.[170] By thus proceeding along constitutional lines a State\r\ngovernment in all its branches was soon established in every county not\r\noccupied by an armed foe.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of the restored State assembled, July 2, at Wheeling and\r\nassumed the full exercise of its powers. Two United States Senators,\r\nWaitman T. Willey, whose fidelity many considered doubtful, and John S.\r\nCarlile, an able, eloquent and then a trusted leader, were elected, July\r\n9; the former to fill the vacancy occasioned by the withdrawal of James\r\nM. Mason, the latter to succeed Robert M. T. Hunter, who also had\r\nabdicated his seat in Congress. Both were admitted, though not without a\r\nvigorous protest from the minority, to seats at the first session of the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress, which met on July 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nTheir certificates were presented, July 13, by Andrew Johnson. Senator\r\nBayard entered a protest. Their admission, he said, would be a\r\nrecognition of an organization that was not the regular government of\r\nthe Commonwealth. Mr. Letcher was still Governor of Virginia, his term\r\nnot having expired. The Senate had no authority to create a new State\r\nout of a part of an existing one. He then moved to refer their\r\ncredentials to the Committee on the Judiciary. His colleague, Mr.\r\nSaulsbury, objected, that Mason and Hunter were not expelled until July\r\n11, whereas the claimants were appointed two days previously, at a time\r\nwhen no vacancies had occurred. To this Senator Johnson replied that the\r\nvacancies did in fact exist at the time of their election, July 9, and\r\nthat the expulsion of Mason and Hunter was not merely a declaration that\r\nvacancies existed, but their seats were regarded as filled, and the\r\noccupants expelled from the floor of the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Bayard denied that, even if Mason and Hunter were guilty of the\r\nalleged crimes, there was any power in either the Governor or\r\nLegislature to terminate their appointments; they might die, they could\r\nbe removed by expulsion, but vacancies could not be anticipated by the\r\nLegislature of Virginia. The name of Mr. Pierpont could convey no\r\nauthority to their credentials. On the question of reference five\r\nSenators voted in the affirmative, thirty-five in the negative. The oath\r\nwas therefore administered and they took their seats, July 13, at the\r\nspecial session which began on the 4th.[171]\r\n\r\nA resolution was passed by the House of Delegates of the reorganized\r\ngovernment instructing the Senators and requesting their Representatives\r\nin Congress to vote the necessary appropriation of men and money for a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the war, and to oppose all compromise. A stay\r\nlaw was also enacted by the Legislature, and a bill passed which\r\nauthorized the Governor to organize a patrol in such counties as might\r\nrequire it; two hundred thousand dollars were appropriated for military\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1861, the Wheeling convention reassembled. Hitherto in all\r\nits proceedings relative to a reorganization there had been great\r\nunanimity, but when the delegates returned they were conscious of a\r\nstrong popular sentiment in favor of erecting a new State, a subject\r\nthat had been introduced, though not much discussed, before adjournment.\r\nThis determination among their constituents seriously troubled many of\r\nthe members. Political aspirations had been awakened; many of them had\r\nenjoyed the benefits of the humbler offices under the mother State; the\r\nUnion forces, it was confidently expected, would soon crush the\r\ninsurrection in Virginia, and the reorganized government, with\r\nthemselves at its head, would be acquiesced in by their recent\r\noppressors. To their ambition this hope was far more flattering than the\r\nprospect of administering the affairs of a comparatively small State on\r\nthe western frontier of the Old Dominion. Then, too, the idea of\r\ndismemberment was certain to wound Virginia State pride. Moreover, the\r\nmovement to form an independent commonwealth, when the reorganized\r\ngovernment itself had been scarcely recognized, would look premature.\r\nSentiments of this nature had begun to possess the minds of many\r\ndelegates about the time of their return.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with what appeared to be a popular demand, however, these\r\nconsiderations were disregarded, and the convention by a vote of 50 to\r\n28 passed an ordinance authorizing the formation out of the Commonwealth\r\nof Virginia of a new State to be called Kanawha, which was to embrace\r\nthirty-nine counties between the Alleghanies and the Ohio, provided the\r\npeople thereof, at an election to be held on October 24, should express\r\nthemselves in favor of such a measure; on certain prescribed conditions\r\nother contiguous counties could be annexed. At the election which was to\r\ndecide this important question delegates to a constitutional convention\r\nwere also to be chosen, and, if separation was approved by the people,\r\nthese representatives were to assemble at Wheeling on November 26 and\r\norganize themselves into a convention. Any constitution which they might\r\nadopt was to be submitted to the qualified electors of the counties\r\nconcerned. The new commonwealth was to assume a just proportion of\r\nVirginia’s public debt as it existed prior to January 1, 1861; private\r\nrights derived from her laws were to be valid under the proposed State,\r\nand were to be determined by the laws then existing in Virginia.[172]\r\n\r\nThe convention, as previously noted, reassembled on August 6. Three days\r\nlater one A. F. Ritchie, a member from Marion County, forwarded to\r\nAttorney-General Bates at Washington a letter which requested and\r\nreceived an immediate reply. Mr. Ritchie published the response, of\r\nwhich this is the important part:\r\n\r\n  The formation of a new State out of Western Virginia is an original,\r\n  independent act of _revolution_. I do not deny the power of\r\n  revolution (I do not call it right, for it is never prescribed; it\r\n  exists in force only, and has and can have no law but the will of\r\n  the revolutionists). Any attempt to carry it out involves a plain\r\n  breach of _both the constitutions_—of Virginia and of the Nation.\r\n  And hence it is plain that you cannot take such a course without\r\n  weakening, if not destroying, your claims upon the sympathy and\r\n  support of the General Government, and without disconcerting the\r\n  plan already adopted by both Virginia and the General Government for\r\n  the reorganization of the revolted States and the restoration of the\r\n  integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\n  That plan I understand to be this: When a State, by its perverted\r\n  functionaries, has declared itself out of the Union, we avail\r\n  ourselves of all the sound and loyal elements of the State—all who\r\n  own allegiance to and claim protection of the Constitution—to form a\r\n  State government as nearly as may be upon the former model, and\r\n  claiming to be the very State which has been in part overthrown by\r\n  the successful rebellion. In this way we establish a constitutional\r\n  nucleus around which all the shattered elements of the commonwealth\r\n  may meet and combine, and thus restore the old State in its original\r\n  integrity.\r\n\r\n  This, I verily thought, was the plan adopted at Wheeling, and\r\n  recognized and acted upon by the General Government here. Your\r\n  convention annulled the revolutionary proceedings at Richmond, both\r\n  in the Convention and the General Assembly, and your new Governor\r\n  formally demanded of the President the fulfillment of the\r\n  constitutional guaranty in favor of Virginia—Virginia as known to\r\n  our fathers and to us. The President admitted the obligation, and\r\n  promised his best efforts to fulfill it. And the Senate admitted\r\n  your Senators, not as representing a new and nameless State, now for\r\n  the first time heard of in our history, but as representing “the\r\n  good old commonwealth.”\r\n\r\n  Must all this be undone, and a new and hazardous experiment be\r\n  ventured upon, at the moment when dangers and difficulties are\r\n  thickening around us? I hope not.... I had rejoiced in the movement\r\n  in Western Virginia, as a legal, constitutional, and safe refuge\r\n  from revolution and anarchy; as at once an example and fit\r\n  instrument for the restoration of all the revolted States.\r\n\r\n  I have not time now to discuss the subject in its various bearings.\r\n  What I have written is written with a running pen and will need your\r\n  charitable criticism.\r\n\r\n  If I had time to think, I could give persuasive reasons for\r\n  declining the attempt to create a new State at this perilous time.\r\n  At another time I might be willing to go fully into the question,\r\n  but now I can say no more.[173]\r\n\r\nMr. Ritchie, who had opposed a dismemberment of the old Commonwealth,\r\nwas anxious, no doubt, to justify his vote by the endorsement of an\r\neminent public character, and it is not improbable that before finally\r\ndetermining his action in so important a matter he was desirous of the\r\nopinion of some member of the Administration. Mr. Bates’s communication\r\nis dated the 12th; the convention did not adjourn till the 25th of\r\nAugust. At any time prior to January 1, 1862, it was subject to be\r\nreassembled by its president or by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe election of October 24, by a vote of 18,408 to 781, decided in favor\r\nof a division of the Commonwealth.[174] At the same time fifty-three\r\ndelegates, representing forty-one counties, were chosen to frame a\r\nconstitution for the proposed State. Of this convention John Hall was\r\nelected president and Ellery R. Hall secretary. The task before it, by\r\nno means an easy one, was to draft a fundamental law that would secure\r\nthe approval of the people of western Virginia, of the Legislature of\r\nthe restored State and of Congress. After a session of nearly three\r\nmonths it adjourned, February 18, 1862. Commissioners to convoke this\r\nbody, should its work be recognized by Congress, had first been\r\nappointed. On December 3 preceding the name of the new State was changed\r\nto West Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the convention were many members who desired silence on the subject\r\nof slavery; others saw clearly that to ignore the cause of their present\r\ntroubles would ensure a rejection of their work by Congress. This\r\nelement felt assured that the temper of the national Legislature would\r\nnot indulge the slave power by giving it two additional Senators besides\r\nan increase of strength in the Electoral College. There was also a\r\nsentiment which desired a postponement of the disturbing question until\r\nall others had first been determined. The friends of gradual\r\nemancipation were warned by leading Republicans in Congress that the\r\nconstitution would not be recognized without a satisfactory provision on\r\nthis subject. The “peculiar institution,” however, still possessed\r\ninfluence enough to defeat such a purpose, and the convention adjourned\r\nwithout inserting any expression concerning slavery. Still, the friends\r\nof emancipation did not despair. Mr. Parker, one of these, caused to be\r\nprinted in Ohio instructions to their assemblymen to make the following\r\nprovision a part of their constitution if the speedy admission of the\r\nnew State into the Union should appear to require it: “All children born\r\nof slave mothers in this State, after the constitution goes into\r\noperation, shall be free, males at the age of twenty-eight years, and\r\nfemales at the age of eighteen years, and the children of such females\r\nto be free at birth.”[175]\r\n\r\nThis unauthorized action of Mr. Parker, in connection with appeals\r\nthrough the newspapers, was not without effect. At their county-seat the\r\ncitizens of Upshur passed, among other resolutions, the following: “That\r\nwe, the citizens of Upshur County, do endorse and accept the policy\r\nrecommended by the present Chief Magistrate of the United States,\r\n(Abraham Lincoln) in his message of the 6th of March, 1862, to Congress,\r\nin regard to the emancipation of the slaves of the border States, as the\r\npolicy that should be adopted by the people of West Virginia; and we do\r\nnow pledge ourselves to advocate, defend and carry out the said policy,\r\nas the most promotive of our liberty, safety and prosperity in the\r\nUnion.”[176] Another resolution, adopted on this occasion, declared that\r\nthe meeting expected the convention would have given the people an\r\nopportunity of expressing their sentiments on slavery in the proposed\r\nState. The convention, they complained, did not reflect the popular\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe Union men and the loyal press of other counties followed the example\r\nof Upshur by approving the measure or copying the “Instructions.” Thus\r\nat the time of voting on the constitution an informal poll on slavery\r\nwas obtained in twenty counties.\r\n\r\nA faction in the convention proposed to annex the Shenandoah Valley with\r\nits large negro population; the success of such a plan, it was well\r\nunderstood, would ensure a rejection of the new State by Congress. To\r\nanticipate somewhat the events presently to be narrated it may be\r\nremarked at this point that the adversaries of the measure in Washington\r\nemployed precisely the same tactics to defeat the movement for erecting\r\nan independent State.\r\n\r\nThe new establishment under Pierpont was regarded as representing the\r\nold Commonwealth. On December 2, 1861, the reorganized Legislature again\r\nassembled. The Governor recommended a repeal of the stay laws and\r\nconfiscation of the property of secessionists. He congratulated the\r\npeople that they had contributed their full quota, about 6,000 men, to\r\nthe Union army.\r\n\r\nThe adversaries of slavery endeavored to obtain the consent of the\r\nrestored Legislature to the condition that the gradual emancipation\r\nclause should become a part of the constitution as soon as ratified by\r\nthe people. If Congress at its present session would give its consent\r\nand admit the new State on the same condition, the people, they\r\ndeclared, could be trusted to ratify afterward.\r\n\r\nAn election held April 3, 1862, gave, including the soldiers’ vote,\r\n28,321 for and 572 against the constitution, no returns being received\r\nfrom ten counties.[177] The vote for gradual emancipation, where an\r\nexpression was had, was almost equal to that given for the constitution,\r\nboth being nearly unanimous. The former received 6,052 for and 610\r\nagainst it. How far this informal expression of opinion influenced\r\nCongress will presently be noticed.\r\n\r\nAt an extra session of the Legislature, convoked by Governor Pierpont,\r\nan act, in almost the identical language of that assenting to the\r\nformation of Kentucky, was passed, May 13, 1862, giving consent to the\r\nerection within the jurisdiction of Virginia of a new State to include\r\nforty-eight named counties; the second section of this act provided that\r\nBerkeley, Jefferson and Frederic counties could be annexed whenever a\r\nmajority of their votes, at an election to be held for that purpose,\r\nshould ratify the constitution. The act, together with a certified\r\noriginal of the constitution, was to be transmitted to their Senators\r\nand Representatives in Washington, who were requested to use their\r\nendeavors to obtain the consent of Congress to the admission of West\r\nVirginia into the Union.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 1862, Mr. Wade, from the Committee on Territories, reported\r\nto the United States Senate a bill for the admission of West Virginia\r\ninto the Union, and three days later requested its consideration. It\r\nstipulated, among other things, that “the convention thereinafter\r\nprovided for shall, in the constitution to be framed by it, make\r\nprovision that from and after the fourth day of July, 1863, the children\r\nof all slaves born within the limits of the State shall be free”; it\r\nalso allotted to the new Commonwealth as many Representatives in\r\nCongress as her population would justify under the apportionment then\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner observed that the former was the imposition of a\r\ncondition which proposed to recognize the existence of slavery during\r\nthat generation. “Short as life may be,” he declared, “it is too long\r\nfor slavery.” By the admission of West Virginia a new slave State would\r\nbe added; he moved, therefore, to substitute for this requirement the\r\nJeffersonian interdict that “within the limits of said State there shall\r\nbe neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, otherwise than in\r\npunishment of crime whereof the party shall be duly convicted.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hale justly remarked that after consenting to the admission of so\r\nmany States with pro-slavery constitutions it would be a singular fact\r\nif the first that ever applied with a provision for prospective\r\nemancipation should be rejected.\r\n\r\nSenator Collamer believed that if West Virginia was to enter on a\r\nfooting of perfect equality with other members of the Union she should,\r\nlike them, have the right to regulate domestic questions, including\r\nslavery, in her own way. The condition imposed by the bill denied her\r\nthat right.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade disliked the proposition as it stood, because it was very\r\nobjectionable to him “to say that a man born on the 4th day of July,\r\n1863, shall be free, and one born the day before shall be forever a\r\nslave.” “I should much prefer,” he added, “to have it graduated so that\r\nall born after the adoption of this constitution shall be free, and that\r\nall between certain ages shall be free at a certain period.” At this\r\npoint Sumner’s amendment was lost by a vote of 24 to 11.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlile, of Virginia, who was foremost in organizing resistance to\r\nsecession, had from the beginning assumed the appearance of a friend,\r\nbut, after giving direction to the movement for separation, acted as an\r\nadversary to the new State; he opposed all conditions on its admission\r\nand expressed a preference that it be permitted to enter on the\r\nconstitution submitted by its people. He would never “consent to have\r\nthe organic law of a State framed for its people by the Congress of the\r\nUnited States.” There were 47,000 voters in the counties to be embraced\r\nwithin the proposed State; of that number only about 19,000 had voted on\r\nthe constitution. At the last moment he delivered with his usual\r\neloquence a strong argument against admission. An amendment which he\r\nsubmitted would have the effect certainly to postpone, perhaps\r\naltogether to defeat, the measure in the Senate. Failing to secure its\r\nadoption, he urged a postponement till December following; this motion,\r\nhowever, was voted down.\r\n\r\nSo surprised were his associates at this unexpected opposition that they\r\ninquired pointedly why these belated arguments had not been presented to\r\nthe Committee on Territories when the measure was before them. Mr. Wade,\r\nits chairman, was especially severe in his condemnation of Carlile’s\r\nextraordinary course, for it was the reasoning of the Virginia Senator\r\nthat had won their support; he had searched the precedents and submitted\r\ncheerfully to all the labors imposed by the Committee. Now by his\r\nopposition he brought everything to a stand-still.\r\n\r\nHis colleague, Mr. Willey, who had been converted in a rather advanced\r\nstage of the movement, declared that it was not the desire to be free\r\nfrom that part of the Commonwealth in rebellion that was responsible for\r\nthe present attitude of western Virginia; the insurrection only\r\nprecipitated the attempt to settle a controversy which was older than\r\nhe. To enforce his remarks he added that great numbers of her citizens\r\nhad determined to fix their abodes elsewhere unless West Virginia became\r\nan independent State. During this discussion the Senate had before it\r\nthe constitution framed by the convention which met November 26, 1861,\r\nin the city of Wheeling.\r\n\r\nAfter a vigorous address by Benjamin F. Wade, who had recently\r\ninvestigated the subject, and whose ardor had been aroused by a\r\ndeputation of West Virginians then in Washington, the bill by a vote of\r\n23 to 17 passed the Senate, July 14, 1862.[178]\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Brown, of Virginia, a similar measure had already been introduced\r\ninto the House on June 25. It was read twice and referred to the\r\nCommittee on Territories.[179] When called up on July 16 succeeding it\r\nwas agreed to postpone consideration of the bill until the regular\r\nsession in December,[180] and on the 9th of that month, when\r\nRepresentative Bingham asked that it be put on its passage, discussion\r\nof the subject was resumed.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Conway said that if the application of West Virginia came\r\nin the proper manner he would be happy to vote for its admission; he\r\nregretted, however, that at the beginning of the rebellion a territorial\r\ngovernment had not been organized there; Congress could then have passed\r\nan enabling act, and the State could be received in a manner to admit of\r\nno dispute. The question turned, he declared, on whether the State of\r\nVirginia, of which a Mr. Pierpont was Governor, was the lawful State.\r\nThis he denied. A number of persons without authority met at Wheeling\r\nand organized a government. This establishment the President had\r\nrecognized; one branch of Congress by admitting its Senators had also\r\nconceded its legality. These precedents, however, should not be binding\r\non the House. Neither mobs nor mass-meetings, he asserted, make laws\r\nunder our system, and such bodies had no authority to appoint Mr.\r\nPierpont.\r\n\r\nThe President intended, Mr. Conway believed, to form similar\r\norganizations in all the seceded States. “A policy seems about to be\r\ninaugurated,” he added, “looking to an assumption of State powers by a\r\nfew individuals, wherever a military or other encampment can be effected\r\nin any of the rebellious districts. The utter and flagrant\r\nunconstitutionality of this scheme—I may say, its radically\r\nrevolutionary character—ought to expose it to the reprobation of every\r\nloyal citizen and every member of this House. It aims at an utter\r\nsubversion of our constitutional system. Its effect would be to\r\nconsolidate all the powers of the Government in the hands of the\r\nExecutive. With the admission of this new State, the President will have\r\nsubstantially _created_ four Senators—two for Virginia and two for West\r\nVirginia.” In referring to an extension of this system he declared that\r\nthe President and a few friends could exercise Federal authority in all\r\nthose States. “The true policy of this Government, therefore, with\r\nregard to the seceded States, is to hold them as common territory\r\nwherever and whenever our arms are extended over them. This obviates the\r\nterrible dangers which I have alluded to, and is in harmony with the\r\nhighest considerations of public utility, as well as with sound legal\r\nprinciples.”[181]\r\n\r\nMr. Conway directed his criticisms against the President because he\r\nbelieved the Executive was first to recognize the new government. The\r\naction of the Senate was based upon this precedent, it being assumed\r\nthat recognition was an Executive function.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown, who introduced the bill at the preceding session, related\r\nconcisely the essential facts already placed before the reader. He\r\nreminded Representative Conway that, though a State could not commit\r\ntreason, or any other crime, the officials of government could do so;\r\nthat the legislative powers, being incapable of annihilation, returned\r\nto the people; that the spontaneous assembly at Wheeling merely\r\norganized and proposed a plan by which regular elections were to be held\r\nto fill vacancies caused by the withdrawal of disloyal representatives.\r\nA day was fixed, and wherever throughout the State loyal citizens chose\r\nto hold an election they could do so. The body thus elected assumed the\r\nlegislative functions of the people.\r\n\r\nIn answer to an inquiry he replied that about five counties outside of\r\nWest Virginia were represented in the Legislature which consented to the\r\nerection of the new State, and all the counties in the State were\r\nexpressly invited to send representatives to the General Assembly. If\r\nthey were loyal they should have coöperated; if not, they should have no\r\nvoice in either the State Legislature or Congress. He referred in his\r\nremarks to a telegram which he had that morning received from Wheeling.\r\nIt contained a resolution passed by the Assembly asking the House of\r\nRepresentatives to approve the bill for the admission of West Virginia,\r\nwhich had been favorably acted upon by the Senate at the preceding\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n“It has been asserted,” he said in conclusion, “and understood in some\r\nquarters, that the organization of the government at Wheeling was for\r\nthe purpose of forming a new State. I am prepared to say that when the\r\nconvention originally met in Wheeling, although there were a few\r\nradicals there who wanted to form a new State without reinstating the\r\nold State of Virginia, we voted them down, and commenced the exercise of\r\nour original rights as freemen to build up the loyal government of\r\nVirginia; and although we designed eventually to ask for this\r\nseparation, and it was what we anxiously desired, yet we determined to\r\nbe a law-abiding people, and ask for what we desired through the forms\r\nof law.”[182]\r\n\r\nRepresentative Colfax in giving the reasons which should govern his vote\r\nstated that the restored government had been recognized by the Senate,\r\nby the President as well as other executive officers, and that the\r\nHouse, by admitting Mr. Segar, elected pursuant to a proclamation of\r\nGovernor Pierpont, had also recognized the reorganized State. Even the\r\npolitical party in opposition voted for that member’s admission. He also\r\nremarked that the new State came knocking at the door for admission with\r\nthe tiara of freedom on her brow.[183]\r\n\r\nMr. Olin, who opposed the bill at the preceding session, said: “I shall\r\nvote for it now with reluctance. I shall vote for it mainly upon the\r\nground that the General Government, whether wisely or unwisely I will\r\nnot undertake to say, has encouraged this movement to create a division\r\nof the State of Virginia.”[184] The people of West Virginia, with their\r\nexperience of the evils which slavery brought on them, should not have\r\npermitted that institution to exist for an hour in their new government.\r\nFor this deficiency, however, the bill provided a partial remedy.\r\n\r\nCrittenden observed that it was the party applying for admission that\r\ngave its consent to a division of the State.[185] To this objection\r\nRepresentative Blair replied that there were counties outside of West\r\nVirginia which had assented to dismemberment. Other members, who had\r\nhitherto been hostile, now consented to support the measure from a\r\nconviction that it would weaken rebellion.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Dawes said that the primary elections which sent\r\ndelegates to the Wheeling convention discussed not a reorganization of\r\nthe Virginia government, but the formation of an independent State in\r\nwestern Virginia. To accomplish that, he said, the only way was to\r\nrestore the government of the entire Commonwealth. That government then\r\nhad two things to do: to set up a new State within itself and secondly\r\nto give its consent thereto. This suggestion, he understood, emanated\r\nfrom Washington.[186]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the admission, Thaddeus Stevens said:\r\n\r\n  I do not desire to be understood as being deluded by the idea that\r\n  we are admitting this State in pursuance of any provisions of the\r\n  Constitution. I find no such provision that justifies it, and the\r\n  argument in favor of the constitutionality of it is one got up by\r\n  those who either honestly entertain, I think, an erroneous opinion,\r\n  or who desire to justify, by a forced construction, an act which\r\n  they have predetermined to do.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Now, to say that the Legislature which called this seceding\r\n  convention was not the Legislature of Virginia, is asserting that\r\n  the Legislature chosen by a vast majority of the people of a State\r\n  is not the Legislature of that State. That is a doctrine which I can\r\n  never assent to. I admit that the Legislature were disloyal, but\r\n  they were still the disloyal and traitorous Legislature of the State\r\n  of Virginia; and the State, as a mere State, was bound by their\r\n  acts. Not so individuals. They are responsible to the General\r\n  Government, and are responsible whether the State decrees treason or\r\n  not. That being the Legislature of Virginia, Governor Letcher,\r\n  elected by a majority of the votes of the people, is the Governor of\r\n  Virginia—a traitor in rebellion, but a traitorous governor of a\r\n  traitorous State. Now, then, how has that State ever given its\r\n  consent to this division? A highly respectable but very small number\r\n  of the citizens of Virginia—the people of West Virginia—assembled\r\n  together, disapproved of the acts of the State of Virginia, and with\r\n  the utmost self-complacency called themselves Virginia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I hold that none of the States now in rebellion are entitled to the\r\n  protection of the Constitution, and I am grieved when I hear those\r\n  high in authority sometimes talking of the constitutional\r\n  difficulties about enforcing measures against this belligerent\r\n  power, and the next moment disregarding every vestige and semblance\r\n  of the Constitution by acts which alone are arbitrary. I hope I do\r\n  not differ with the Executive in the views which I advocate. But I\r\n  see the Executive one day saying “you shall not take the property of\r\n  rebels to pay the debts which the rebels have brought upon the\r\n  Northern States.” Why? Because the Constitution is in the way. And\r\n  the next day I see him appointing a military governor of Virginia, a\r\n  military governor of Tennessee, and some other places. Where does he\r\n  find anything in the Constitution to warrant that?\r\n\r\n  If he must look there alone for authority, then all these acts are\r\n  flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community.\r\n  He must agree with me or else his acts are as absurd as they are\r\n  unlawful; for I see him here and there ordering elections for\r\n  members of Congress wherever he finds a little collection of three\r\n  or four consecutive plantations in the rebel States, in order that\r\n  men may be sent in here to control the proceedings of this Congress,\r\n  just as we sanctioned the election held by a few people at a little\r\n  watering place at Fortress Monroe, by which we have here the very\r\n  respectable and estimable member from that locality with us. It was\r\n  upon the same principle.\r\n\r\n  ... I say, then, that we may admit West Virginia as a new State, not\r\n  by virtue of any provision of the Constitution, but under our\r\n  absolute power which the laws of war give us in the circumstances in\r\n  which we are placed. I shall vote for this bill upon that theory,\r\n  and upon that alone; for I will not stultify myself by supposing\r\n  that we have any warrant in the Constitution for this proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe Union, he declared, could never be restored as it was. His consent\r\nwould never be given to restore it with a constitutional provision\r\nprotecting slavery. An additional reason for giving his vote in favor of\r\nthe bill was that there was a provision which would make West Virginia a\r\nfree State.[187]\r\n\r\n“No right of persons, no right of property,” said Mr. Noell, “no social\r\nor domestic affairs, could be regulated or controlled by the people of\r\nwestern Virginia, under the circumstances in which they were placed,\r\nwithout recognizing the ordinance of secession, and acting as a State\r\nwithin the Southern Confederacy.”[188] This showed both the necessity of\r\nreorganizing the government of Virginia and the recognition by Federal\r\nauthorities of the establishment so constituted.\r\n\r\nMr. Segar declared that eleven of the forty-eight counties to comprise\r\nthe new State had not participated in its establishment, being\r\nrepresented neither in the reorganized Legislature nor the Wheeling\r\nconvention; three others were unrepresented both in the House of\r\nDelegates and the conventions; ten cast no vote on the constitution and\r\nthree had interests, social and commercial, which bound them up with the\r\nEast. Then, too, the people of West Virginia made a fundamental law\r\nrecognizing slavery; an anti-slavery constitution was to be imposed on\r\nthem as a condition of admission.[189]\r\n\r\nAn able argument by Representative Bingham, of Ohio, who had charge of\r\nthe bill, concluded the debate on December 10, 1862, when it passed by\r\n96 yeas to 55 nays.[190]\r\n\r\nWith the President rested the fate of this important measure; if he\r\nvetoed it there would, probably, not be found a two thirds majority in\r\nits support. Many members, as will be seen from the preceding abridgment\r\nof the debates, yielded only a reluctant support.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1862, Mr. Lincoln sent to his constitutional advisers\r\nthe following note:\r\n\r\n  =Gentlemen of the Cabinet=:\r\n\r\n  A bill for an act entitled “An act for the admission of the State of\r\n  West Virginia into the Union and for other purposes” has passed the\r\n  House of Representatives and the Senate, and has been duly presented\r\n  to me for my action.\r\n\r\n  I respectfully ask of each of you an opinion in writing on the\r\n  following questions, to wit:\r\n\r\n  1st. Is the said act constitutional?\r\n\r\n  2d. Is the said act expedient?[191]\r\n\r\nTo this request six members of the Cabinet responded by submitting their\r\nwritten opinions. Three—Seward, Stanton and Chase—answered both\r\nquestions in the affirmative. Bates, Blair and Welles replied in the\r\nnegative; the remaining place in the Cabinet was vacant owing to the\r\nresignation of Caleb B. Smith, Secretary of the Interior, who had been\r\nraised to the Bench in Indiana. His successor had not yet been\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nUpon the constitutional point Mr. Seward said: “It seems to me that the\r\npolitical body which has given consent in this case is really and\r\nincontestably the State of Virginia. So long as the United States do not\r\nrecognize the secession, departure, or separation of one of the States,\r\nthat State must be deemed as existing and having a constitutional place\r\nwithin the Union, whatever may be at any moment exactly its\r\nrevolutionary condition. A State thus situated cannot be deemed to be\r\ndivided into two or more States merely by any revolutionary proceeding\r\nwhich may have occurred, because there cannot be, constitutionally, two\r\nor more States of Virginia.... The newly organized State of Virginia is\r\ntherefore, at this moment, by the express consent of the United States,\r\ninvested with all the rights of the State of Virginia, and charged with\r\nall the powers, privileges, and dignity of that State. If the United\r\nStates allow to that organization any of these rights, powers, and\r\nprivileges, it must be allowed to possess and enjoy them all. If it be a\r\nState competent to be represented in Congress and bound to pay taxes, it\r\nis a State competent to give the required consent of the State to the\r\nformation and erection of the new State of West Virginia within the\r\njurisdiction of Virginia.”\r\n\r\n“Upon the question of expediency,” he wrote, “I am determined by two\r\nconsiderations. First. The people of Western Virginia will be safer from\r\nmolestation for their loyalty, because better able to protect and defend\r\nthemselves as a new and separate State than they would be if left to\r\ndemoralizing uncertainty upon the question whether, in the progress of\r\nthe war, they may not be again reabsorbed in the State of Virginia, and\r\nsubjected to severities as a punishment for their present devotion to\r\nthe Union. The first duty of the United States is protection to loyalty\r\nwherever it is found. Second. I am of opinion that the harmony and peace\r\nof the Union will be promoted by allowing the new State to be formed and\r\nerected, which will assume jurisdiction over that part of the valley of\r\nthe Ohio which lies on the south side of the Ohio River, displacing, in\r\na constitutional and lawful manner, the jurisdiction heretofore\r\nexercised there by a political power concentrated at the head of the\r\nJames River.”[192]\r\n\r\nMr. Chase, in discussing the constitutional question, said in part: “The\r\nMadison Papers clearly show that the consent of the Legislature of the\r\noriginal State was the only consent required to the erection and\r\nformation of a new State within its jurisdiction. That consent having\r\nbeen given, the consent of the new State, if required, is proved by her\r\napplication for admission.... The Legislature of Virginia, it may be\r\nadmitted, did not contain many members from the eastern counties; it\r\ncontained, however, representatives from all counties whose inhabitants\r\nwere not either rebels themselves, or dominated by greater numbers of\r\nrebels. It was the only Legislature of the State known to the Union. If\r\nits consent was not valid, no consent could be. If its consent was not\r\nvalid, the Constitution, as to the people of West Virginia, has been so\r\nsuspended by the rebellion that a most important right under it is\r\nutterly lost.”\r\n\r\nRelative to the question of expediency, he writes: “The act is almost\r\nuniversally regarded as of vital importance to their welfare by the\r\nloyal people most immediately interested, and it has received the\r\nsanction of large majorities in both Houses of Congress. These facts\r\nafford strong presumptions of expediency.... It may be said, indeed,\r\nthat the admission of West Virginia will draw after it the necessity of\r\nadmitting other States under the consent of extemporized legislatures\r\nassuming to act for whole States, though really representing no\r\nimportant part of their territory. I think this necessity imaginary.\r\nThere is no such legislature, nor is there likely to be. No such\r\nlegislature, if extemporized, is likely to receive the recognition of\r\nCongress or the Executive.”[193]\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton responded more briefly than either Secretary Seward or\r\nSecretary Chase, observing, among other things: “I have been unable to\r\nperceive any point on which the act of Congress conflicts with the\r\nConstitution. By the erection of the new State, the geographical\r\nboundary heretofore existing between the free and slave States will be\r\nbroken, and the advantage of this upon every point of consideration\r\nsurpasses all objections which have occurred to me on the question of\r\nexpediency. Many prophetic dangers and evils might be specified, but it\r\nis safe to suppose that those who come after us will be as wise as\r\nourselves, and if what we deem evils be really such, they will be\r\navoided. The present good is real and substantial, the future may safely\r\nbe left in the care of those whose duty and interest may be involved in\r\nany possible future measures of legislation.”[194]\r\n\r\nOne or two excerpts from the opinion of Mr. Welles will indicate the\r\ncourse of his argument in the negative: “Under existing necessities, an\r\norganization of the loyal citizens, or of a portion of them, has been\r\nrecognized, and its Senators and Representatives admitted to seats in\r\nCongress. Yet we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the fragment of\r\nthe State which, in the revolutionary tumult, has instituted the new\r\norganization, is not possessed of the records, archives, symbols,\r\ntraditions, or capital of the Commonwealth. Though calling itself the\r\nState of Virginia, it does not assume the debts and obligations\r\ncontracted prior to the existing difficulties. Is this organization,\r\nthen, really and in point of fact anything else than a provisional\r\ngovernment for the State? It is composed almost entirely of those loyal\r\ncitizens who reside beyond the mountains, and within the prescribed\r\nlimits of the proposed new State. In this revolutionary period, there\r\nbeing no contestants, we are compelled to recognize the organization as\r\nVirginia. Whether that would be the case, and how the question would be\r\nmet and disposed of, were the insurrection this day abandoned, need not\r\nnow be discussed. Were Virginia, or those parts of it not included in\r\nthe proposed new State, invaded and held in temporary subjection by a\r\nforeign enemy instead of the insurgents, the fragment of territory and\r\npopulation which should successfully repel the enemy and adhere to the\r\nUnion would doubtless, during such temporary subjection, be recognized,\r\nand properly recognized, as Virginia. When, however, this loyal fragment\r\ngoes farther, and not only declares itself to be Virginia, but proceeds\r\nby its own act to detach itself permanently and forever from the\r\nCommonwealth, and to erect itself into a new State within the\r\njurisdiction of the State of Virginia, the question arises whether this\r\nproceeding is regular, legal, right, and, in honest good faith,\r\nconformable to, and within the letter and spirit of the Constitution....\r\nCongress may admit new States into the Union; but any attempt to\r\ndismember or divide a State by any forced or unauthorized assumption\r\nwould be an inexpedient exercise of doubtful power to the injury of such\r\nState. Were there no question of doubtful constitutionality in the\r\nmovement, the time selected for the division of the State is most\r\ninopportune. It is a period of civil commotion, when unity and concerted\r\naction on the part of all loyal citizens and authorities should be\r\ndirected to a restoration of the Union, and all tendency towards\r\ndisintegration and demoralization avoided.”[195]\r\n\r\nMr. Blair, likewise in the negative, added little of importance to what\r\nSecretary Welles had adduced on that side.\r\n\r\nThe first and rather hastily formed opinion of Attorney-General Bates\r\nhas already been given together with an account of the circumstances\r\nattending its publication; upon longer reflection he did not greatly\r\nchange the ground of his original convictions and in an elaborate\r\ndiscussion still reasoned in the negative.[196]\r\n\r\nBetween these evenly balanced and conflicting opinions of his advisers\r\nMr. Lincoln argued as follows:\r\n\r\n  The consent of the legislature of Virginia is constitutionally\r\n  necessary to the bill for the admission of West Virginia becoming a\r\n  law. A body claiming to be such legislature has given its consent.\r\n  We cannot well deny that it is such, unless we do so upon the\r\n  outside knowledge that the body was chosen at elections in which a\r\n  majority of the qualified voters of Virginia did not participate.\r\n  But it is a universal practice in the popular elections in all these\r\n  States to give no legal consideration whatever to those who do not\r\n  choose to vote, as against the effect of the votes of those who do\r\n  choose to vote. Hence it is not the qualified voters, but the\r\n  qualified voters who choose to vote that constitute the political\r\n  power of the State. Much less than to non-voters should any\r\n  consideration be given to those who did not vote in this case,\r\n  because it is also matter of outside knowledge that they were not\r\n  merely neglectful of their rights under and duty to this government,\r\n  but were also engaged in open rebellion against it. Doubtless among\r\n  these non-voters were some Union men whose voices were smothered by\r\n  the more numerous secessionists; but we know too little of their\r\n  number to assign them any appreciable value. Can this government\r\n  stand, if it indulges constitutional constructions by which men in\r\n  open rebellion against it are to be accounted, man for man, the\r\n  equals of those who maintain their loyalty to it? Are they to be\r\n  accounted even better citizens, and more worthy of consideration,\r\n  than those who merely neglect to vote? If so, their treason against\r\n  the Constitution enhances their constitutional value. Without\r\n  braving these absurd conclusions, we cannot deny that the body which\r\n  consents to the admission of West Virginia is the legislature of\r\n  Virginia. I do not think the plural form of the words “legislatures”\r\n  and “States” in the phrase of the Constitution “without the consent\r\n  of the legislatures of the States concerned,” etc., has any\r\n  reference to the new State concerned. That plural form sprang from\r\n  the contemplation of two or more old States contributing to form a\r\n  new one. The idea that the new State was in danger of being admitted\r\n  without its own consent was not provided against, because it was not\r\n  thought of, as I conceive. It is said, the devil takes care of his\r\n  own. Much more should a good spirit—the spirit of the Constitution\r\n  and the Union—take care of its own. I think it cannot do less and\r\n  live.\r\n\r\n  But is the admission into the Union of West Virginia expedient?\r\n  This, in my general view, is more a question for Congress than for\r\n  the Executive. Still I do not evade it. More than on anything else,\r\n  it depends on whether the admission or rejection of the new State\r\n  would, under all the circumstances, tend the more strongly to the\r\n  restoration of the national authority throughout the Union. That\r\n  which helps most in this direction is the most expedient at this\r\n  time. Doubtless those in remaining Virginia would return to the\r\n  Union, so to speak, less reluctantly without the division of the old\r\n  State than with it; but I think we could not save as much in this\r\n  quarter by rejecting the new State, as we should lose by it in West\r\n  Virginia. We can scarcely dispense with the aid of West Virginia in\r\n  this struggle; much less can we afford to have her against us, in\r\n  Congress and in the field. Her brave and good men regard her\r\n  admission into the Union as a matter of life and death. They have\r\n  been true to the Union under very severe trials. We have so acted as\r\n  to justify their hopes, and we cannot fully retain their confidence\r\n  and coöperation if we seem to break faith with them. In fact, they\r\n  could not do so much for us, if they would. Again, the admission of\r\n  the new State turns that much slave soil, to free, and thus is a\r\n  certain and irrevocable encroachment upon the cause of the\r\n  rebellion. The division of a State is dreaded as a precedent. But a\r\n  measure made expedient by a war is no precedent for times of peace.\r\n  It is said that the admission of West Virginia is secession, and\r\n  tolerated only because it is our secession. Well, if we call it by\r\n  that name, there is still difference enough between secession\r\n  against the Constitution and secession in favor of the Constitution.\r\n  I believe the admission of West Virginia into the Union is\r\n  expedient.[197]\r\n\r\nThe bill passed by the House on the 10th was approved by the President\r\non the 31st of December, 1862; after naming the forty-eight counties to\r\nconstitute the new State the act declares, among other things, that\r\nsince the convention framed the constitution for West Virginia its\r\npeople had expressed a wish to change section seven of the eleventh\r\narticle by inserting the following in its place, _viz._: “The children\r\nof slaves born within the limits of this State after the fourth day of\r\nJuly, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, shall be free; and that all\r\nslaves within the said State who shall, at the time aforesaid, be under\r\nthe age of ten years, shall be free when they arrive at the age of\r\ntwenty-one years; and all slaves over ten and under twenty-one years,\r\nshall be free when they arrive at the age of twenty-five years; and no\r\nslave shall be permitted to come into the State for permanent residence\r\ntherein.”[198]\r\n\r\nThe constitution thus amended was unanimously ratified by the\r\nconvention, which on a summons of the commissioners reassembled February\r\n18, 1863, and also by the people, to whom it was submitted at an\r\nelection held on May 26 following.[199] President Lincoln on April 20\r\nissued a proclamation declaring that the prescribed conditions having\r\nbeen complied with, the constitution would go into force in sixty days\r\nfrom that date; the formation of the new State was complete and it\r\nbecame a member of the Union on the 20th of June, 1863.[200]\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster, in an address delivered thirteen years before, at the\r\nlaying of the corner-stone of an addition to the Federal Capitol, had\r\nasked: “And ye men of Western Virginia, ... what benefit do you propose\r\nto yourself by disunion? If you ‘secede,’ what do you ‘secede’ from, and\r\nwhat do you ‘accede’ to? Do you look for the current of the Ohio to\r\nchange, and to bring you and your commerce to the tide-waters of the\r\neastern rivers? What man in his senses can suppose that you would remain\r\npart and parcel of Virginia a month after Virginia should have ceased to\r\nbe part and parcel of the Union?”[201] The remarkable prediction of the\r\ngreat orator was fulfilled; his inspired vision had pierced the future.\r\nThe Old Dominion had separated forever along the line of the\r\nAlleghanies.\r\n\r\nBefore relating the subsequent history of the restored government, it is\r\nproper to notice a few important events in the early career of the new\r\nCommonwealth. On January 31, 1863, an act passed the General Assembly of\r\nVirginia giving consent to the transfer of Berkeley County to the State\r\nof West Virginia. The preamble of this act affirms that its people\r\ndesired to be annexed to the proposed State. The question of transfer,\r\nhowever, was to be decided by a majority of voters at an election to be\r\nheld on the fourth Thursday of May. If, however, the polls could not be\r\nsafely opened on that day, the Governor was empowered to postpone the\r\nelection by proclamation. The commissioners who superintended the\r\npolling were to certify the results to the Executive. On February 4\r\nsucceeding another act made it lawful for voters in certain districts\r\nincluding twenty-three counties to declare, at a general election to be\r\nheld on the fourth Thursday of May, whether these specified counties\r\nshould be annexed to West Virginia. The consent of the Legislature of\r\nthat State was, of course, made a condition of the transfer, after which\r\nthe jurisdiction of Virginia over such counties was to cease.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia statutes of August 5 and November 2, 1863, in words, admit\r\nBerkeley and Jefferson counties, and they have ever since been under her\r\njurisdiction. When admitted into the Union it was with a provision in\r\nher constitution that she might acquire additional territory; therefore\r\nCongress gave its consent in advance and it was not afterwards\r\nwithdrawn. In brief, West Virginia accepted the transfer and it was\r\nauthorized by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia.[202]\r\n\r\nState officers were elected on May 28, when the following unconditional\r\nUnion candidates, receiving a vote of about 30,000, were chosen without\r\nopposition: Arthur I. Boreman, Governor; J. E. Boyers, Secretary of\r\nState; Campbell Tarr, Treasurer; Samuel Crane, Auditor; A. B. Caldwell,\r\nAttorney-General; also three judges of a court of appeals.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of the new State, which was marked by imposing\r\nceremonies, took place at Wheeling, the capital, on June 20, 1863. Mr.\r\nPierpont, the retiring executive of reorganized Virginia, briefly\r\naddressed the assembled citizens and urged them not to forsake the flag;\r\nhe then introduced his successor, whom he pronounced “true as steel.”\r\nGovernor Boreman in his short speech said that the only terms of peace\r\nwere that the rebels should lay down their arms and submit to the\r\nregularly constituted authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of West Virginia convened on the same day. Waitman T.\r\nWilley and P. G. Van Winkle were elected United States Senators.[203] In\r\nhis first message Governor Boreman recommended to the General Assembly\r\nthe immediate passage of laws effectually to extirpate slavery, and also\r\nthe enactment of a law that no man should be permitted to vote or to\r\nhold office until he had taken the oath of allegiance.\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential election of 1864, the first held since the adoption\r\nof the Constitution in which any State deliberately neglected to appoint\r\nelectors, 33,680 votes were polled in West Virginia; of this number the\r\nUnion ticket received 23,223 and the McClellan electors 10,457.[204]\r\nElections had also been held in Louisiana and Tennessee by authority of\r\nthe governments established there under Mr. Lincoln’s plan of\r\nreconstruction; the Republican majority in Congress, however, denied the\r\nvalidity of the organizations in the two States last named and refused\r\nto count the votes which they presented. This question will be fully\r\nconsidered when we come to trace the development of the Congressional\r\nplan. At the regular State election Governor Boreman was chosen without\r\nopposition, receiving 19,098 votes. With the subsequent history of the\r\nnew Commonwealth the subject of reconstruction is not much concerned.\r\n\r\nBy the formation of an independent Commonwealth the counties beyond the\r\nAlleghanies were withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the restored\r\ngovernment, which after the inaugural ceremonies at Wheeling selected\r\nfor its capital the city of Alexandria, where it continued till May 25,\r\n1865, to exercise its functions in those parts of the Old Dominion\r\nwithin the lines of the Union army. A State government was promptly\r\norganized by the election of a legislature and of executive officers. In\r\nthis establishment the loyal eastern counties participated. Mr. Pierpont\r\nwas elected Governor for the term of three years beginning January 1,\r\n1864. A Lieutenant-Governor, a Secretary of State, a Treasurer, an\r\nAuditor, an Adjutant-General and an Attorney-General were also chosen.\r\n\r\nThe Governor in his message to the Assembly mentioned slavery as doomed,\r\nand recommended the calling of a convention so to amend the State\r\nconstitution as to abolish the institution forever. In compliance with\r\nthis suggestion the Legislature, on December 21, 1863, passed an act\r\ndirecting a convention to be held at Alexandria on the 13th of February\r\nsucceeding to amend the constitution and prohibit slavery in the\r\ncounties of Accomac, Northampton, Princess Ann, Elizabeth City and York\r\n(including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth). These with Berkeley\r\nCounty had been excepted from the operation of the Emancipation\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nNone but loyal citizens who had not assisted the insurgents since\r\nJanuary 1, 1863, were allowed to take part, and those whose right to\r\nvote might be challenged were required to swear support of the\r\nConstitution and to declare that they had not in any way given aid or\r\ncomfort to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe convention, consisting of sixteen members, assembled in the new\r\ncapital at the appointed time and remained in session till April 11\r\nfollowing, when a constitution was adopted.[205] Various amendments,\r\nrelating chiefly to the regulation of the elective franchise and to the\r\nabolition of slavery, were discussed and agreed upon. The work of this\r\nminiature convention was ordered to be proclaimed without a submission\r\nto the people. It was not, however, recognized by Congress, though the\r\ncivil government which authorized its formation was permitted to\r\ncontinue under it, provisionally only, and in all respects subject to\r\nthe paramount authority of the United States at any time to abolish,\r\nmodify, or supersede.\r\n\r\nThough the bill for the admission of West Virginia passed both Houses,\r\nyet Congress was by no means unanimous in giving its consent to that\r\nmeasure. In the debates, of which a synopsis has been given, the\r\nhostility of Thaddeus Stevens and other influential members is scarcely\r\nconcealed. This opposition to executive policy slowly gathered strength,\r\nand by 1863 had become formidable enough to defeat the admission of\r\nRepresentatives from the Alexandria government. The Senators, however,\r\nremained, Lemuel J. Bowden till his death, January 2, 1864, when his\r\nsuccessor was refused admission, and John S. Carlile till the expiration\r\nof his term in 1865.\r\n\r\nOn the assembling of the 38th Congress, which commenced its first\r\nsession December 7, 1863, Joseph E. Segar, Lucius H. Chandler and\r\nBenjamin M. Kitchen appeared as Representatives from Virginia. On May 17\r\nsucceeding Mr. Dawes from the Committee of Elections reported a\r\nresolution to the effect that Joseph E. Segar, from the First District\r\nof Virginia, was not entitled to a seat in that Congress. The case of\r\nMr. Chandler, regarded as precisely similar, was considered at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe district which Mr. Segar claimed to represent was composed of twenty\r\ncounties; of these, Chairman Dawes asserted, only four participated in\r\nthe election. Polling places were not opened in any other part of the\r\ndistrict, the Confederate authorities being in possession of the\r\nremaining counties. As there could be no free exercise of the franchise\r\nin this situation Mr. Segar, it was contended, was not properly chosen,\r\nand, therefore, was not entitled to a seat. The vote cast, though not\r\naccurately ascertained, was estimated at 1,677, of which the claimant\r\nreceived 1,300. Because of his loyalty and the sacrifices he had made,\r\nthe Committee regretted the necessity of deciding against him.\r\n\r\nMr. Segar, speaking in his own behalf, reminded the House that in a\r\npreceding election, when he received 559 out of 1,018 votes polled in\r\nthree counties, he was admitted after a delay of seven or eight weeks;\r\nbut when he was sent by a larger constituency and came as the choice of\r\nfour counties he was informed that he had no right to a seat, and some\r\nof his colleagues who favored his admission in 1862 voted to exclude\r\nhim. The Committee’s report, he asserted, admitted the existence of such\r\na State as Virginia. He asked Chairman Dawes a rather embarrassing\r\nquestion when he inquired how a State could have two Senators and no\r\nRepresentative in Congress. In conclusion he pronounced restored State\r\norganization and gradual accretion to be the best method of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nConcerning the title of Mr. Chandler, from the Second Congressional\r\nDistrict, Chairman Dawes stated that of the 779 votes polled in the\r\nelection 778 were cast for the claimant. For the same reason as in the\r\ncase of Mr. Segar only a small part of that District was free to\r\nparticipate in the election, and nearly all the votes were polled in the\r\ncity of Norfolk. The committee reported against his admission on the\r\nsame ground taken in Mr. Segar’s case.\r\n\r\nChandler, who was permitted to state his case to the House, cited a\r\nresolution introduced by his former school-mate, Owen Lovejoy, the\r\nwell-known abolitionist, authorizing the names of the three Virginia\r\nclaimants to be enrolled as Representatives. That resolution, however,\r\nwas tabled and their credentials referred to the Committee of Elections.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the Union vote in his District was only 6,712; of that number\r\n2,900, he said, were in Norfolk and Portsmouth; the latter city had cast\r\nmore votes against secession than the remainder of his District. Great\r\nnumbers of loyal men, however, left there at the beginning of the war.\r\nElectors being under no obligation to vote may allow an election to go\r\nby default when one citizen could return a member to Congress.\r\nTerritorially restored Virginia was larger than Delaware and possessed\r\ntwice the area of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe case of Benjamin M. Kitchen, on which the Committee had previously\r\nmade an adverse report, differed from those of the other two claimants\r\nin that he had received nearly all of his vote in Berkeley County, which\r\npossessed a sort of wandering character, for it was somewhat uncertain\r\nwhether it was under the jurisdiction of the new or the old State. What\r\naction was taken on the Committee’s report does not appear, but it may\r\nbe inferred from a facetious remark of one member who observed that,\r\nlike Segar and Chandler, Kitchen had been privileged to retire to\r\nprivate life. The two former were refused admission by the decided vote\r\nof 94 to 23.\r\n\r\nBesides endeavoring to win back the wavering, Governor Pierpont was\r\noccupied in taking measures for the relief of the distressed. In the\r\nvicinity of Norfolk and Portsmouth there was a large number of destitute\r\npersons whose natural supporters were still following the declining\r\nfortunes of the Confederacy or had been killed in its service. While it\r\nwas universally agreed that their necessities should be relieved, the\r\nmilitary and civil authorities were in conflict as to the mode of\r\nproviding for them. The President in his efforts to establish amicable\r\nrelations between the officers of the army and those of the State\r\ninvoked the assistance of the Governor. As the restored Commonwealth\r\ncould not be consistently recognized while its capital was in a state of\r\nblockade the President by proclamation, September 24, 1863, declared\r\nthat the interdiction of trade with the port of Alexandria had ceased.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler with headquarters at Fortress Monroe took command of the\r\nDepartment of Virginia and North Carolina November 2, 1863. His\r\npredecessors, he asserted, had endeavored to recruit a regiment of\r\nVirginians; but after several months of energetic trial their efforts\r\nwere abandoned. As eastern Virginia claimed to be a loyal and fully\r\norganized State, Butler renewed the attempt, whereupon Governor Pierpont\r\nprotested vigorously. One and a half companies were all the recruits\r\nthat the Commonwealth would furnish, and these, Butler asserts, were\r\nemployed to defend lighthouses and protect Union inhabitants from\r\noutrages at the hands of their disloyal neighbors.[206] This experience,\r\nit may be supposed, did not tend to raise the Alexandria government in\r\nthe esteem of the Department Commander. We find accordingly that\r\ndifferences soon sprang up between the civil and military authorities.\r\nAn attempt to regulate the liquor traffic in Norfolk and vicinity was\r\nthe occasion of an open rupture. Civil officers continued to collect the\r\npayments imposed by law on those engaged in the business; the military\r\npower, to keep the traffic under better control, undertook to give to a\r\nfew firms a monopoly of the importation. In this situation many small\r\nretailers refused to pay their licenses and were indicted in the local\r\ncourts. To foil this purpose, General Shepley issued, June 22, 1864, an\r\norder providing that “on the day of the ensuing municipal election in\r\nthe city of Norfolk a poll will be opened at the several places of\r\nvoting, and separate ballot-boxes will be kept open during the hours of\r\nvoting, in which voters may deposit their ballots, ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ upon\r\nthe following question: Those in favor of continuing the present form of\r\nmunicipal government during the existence of military occupation will\r\nvote ‘yes.’ Those opposed to it will vote ‘no.’”\r\n\r\nGovernor Pierpont resented this action and promptly issued a\r\nproclamation protesting against it as a revolutionary proceeding in\r\nviolation of the Federal Constitution, adding, “No loyal citizen,\r\ntherefore, is expected to vote on the proposed question.” In a vigorous\r\npamphlet discussing the “abuses of military power” he repeated his\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nButler at this point took up the cudgels for his subordinate and in a\r\ngeneral order, dated June 30, 1864, discussed the incident at some\r\nlength. Pierpont was alluded to as “a person who calls himself\r\nGovernor,” and as one “pretending to be the head of the restored\r\ngovernment of Virginia, which government is unrecognized by the\r\nCongress, laws, and Constitution of the United States.” The order\r\nfurther recited that as the loyal citizens of Norfolk had voted against\r\nthe further trial of the experiment of municipal government “therefore\r\nit is ordered that all attempts to exercise civil office and power,\r\nunder any supposed city election, within the city of Norfolk and its\r\nenvirons, must cease, and the persons pretending to be elected to civil\r\noffices at the late election, and those heretofore elected to municipal\r\noffices since the rebellion, must no longer attempt to exercise such\r\nfunctions; and upon any pretense or attempt so to do, the military\r\ncommandant at Norfolk will see to it that persons so acting are stayed\r\nand quieted.”\r\n\r\nA memorial to Mr. Lincoln enlisted his sympathy and secured for Pierpont\r\nthe assistance of Attorney-General Bates, who on July 11 wrote the\r\nPresident a long official letter setting forth his sense of the serious\r\nmilitary encroachment by General Butler upon civil law and the authority\r\nof Mr. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia. The Department Commander\r\nreplied in a communication of forty pages in sharp criticism of the\r\nAlexandria government, which he characterized as a “useless, expensive,\r\nand inefficient thing, unrecognized by Congress, unknown to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and of such character that there is\r\nno command in the Decalogue against worshiping it, being the likeness of\r\nnothing in the heavens above, the earth beneath, or the waters under the\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General, who was accused of a design to create a conflict\r\nbetween the civil and the military power, also came in for a share of\r\nrather violent criticism. In this altercation each party accused the\r\nother of being assisted by only secessionists and traitors.[207]\r\n\r\nIt was relative to this controversy that Mr. Lincoln, December 21, 1864,\r\naddressed to General Butler the following communication:\r\n\r\n  On the 9th of August last, I began to write you a letter, the\r\n  enclosed being a copy of so much as I then wrote. So far as it goes\r\n  it embraces the views I then entertained and still entertain.\r\n\r\n  A little relaxation of the complaints made to me on the subject,\r\n  occurring about that time, the letter was not finished and sent. I\r\n  now learn, correctly I suppose, that you have ordered an election,\r\n  similar to the one mentioned, to take place on the eastern shore of\r\n  Virginia. Let this be suspended at least until conference with me\r\n  and obtaining my approval.\r\n\r\n                              [Inclosure.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Executive Mansion, Washington=, _August 9, 1864_.\r\n\r\n  _Major-General Butler_:\r\n\r\n  Your paper of the —— about Norfolk matters, is received, as also was\r\n  your other, on the same general subject, dated, I believe, some time\r\n  in February last. This subject has caused considerable trouble,\r\n  forcing me to give a good deal of time and reflection to it. I\r\n  regret that crimination and recrimination are mingled in it. I\r\n  surely need not to assure you that I have no doubt of your loyalty\r\n  and devoted patriotism; and I must tell you that I have no less\r\n  confidence in those of Governor Pierpont and the Attorney-General.\r\n  The former—at first as the loyal governor of all Virginia, including\r\n  that which is now West Virginia, in organizing and furnishing\r\n  troops, and in all other proper matters—was as earnest, honest, and\r\n  efficient to the extent of his means as any other loyal governor.\r\n\r\n  The inauguration of West Virginia as a new State left to him, as he\r\n  assumed, the remainder of the old State; and the insignificance of\r\n  the parts which are outside of the rebel lines, and consequently\r\n  within his reach, certainly gives a somewhat farcical air to his\r\n  dominion, and I suppose he, as well as I, has considered that it can\r\n  be useful for little else than as a nucleus to add to. The\r\n  Attorney-General needs only to be known to be relieved from all\r\n  question as to loyalty and thorough devotion to the national cause,\r\n  constantly restraining as he does my tendency to clemency for rebels\r\n  and rebel sympathizers. But he is the law-officer of the Government,\r\n  and a believer in the virtue of adhering to law.\r\n\r\n  Coming to the question itself, the military occupancy of Norfolk is\r\n  a necessity with us. If you, as department commander, find the\r\n  cleansing of the city necessary to prevent pestilence in your army;\r\n  street-lights and a fire department necessary to prevent\r\n  assassinations and incendiarism among your men and stores; wharfage\r\n  necessary to land and ship men and supplies; a large pauperism,\r\n  badly conducted at a needlessly large expense to the government; and\r\n  find that all these things, or any of them, are not reasonably well\r\n  attended to by the civil government, you rightfully may and must\r\n  take them into your own hands. But you should do so on your own\r\n  avowed judgment of a military necessity, and not seem to admit that\r\n  there is no such necessity by taking a vote of the people on the\r\n  question.\r\n\r\n  Nothing justifies the suspending of the civil by the military\r\n  authority but military necessity; and of the existence of that\r\n  necessity, the military commander, and not a popular vote, is to\r\n  decide. And whatever is not within such necessity should be left\r\n  undisturbed.\r\n\r\n  In your paper of February you fairly notified me that you\r\n  contemplated taking a popular vote, and, if fault there be, it was\r\n  my fault that I did not object then, which I probably should have\r\n  done had I studied the subject as closely as I have since done. I\r\n  now think you would better place whatever you feel is necessary to\r\n  be done on this distinct ground of military necessity, openly\r\n  discarding all reliance for what you do on any election. I also\r\n  think you should so keep accounts as to show every item of money\r\n  received and how expended.\r\n\r\n  The course here indicated does not touch the case when the military\r\n  commander, finding no friendly civil government existing, may, under\r\n  sanction or direction of the President, give assistance to the\r\n  people to inaugurate one.[208]\r\n\r\nOn the same general subject the President one week later wrote General\r\nButler this brief note:\r\n\r\n  I think you will find that the provost-marshal on the eastern shore\r\n  has, as by your authority, issued an order, not for a meeting, but\r\n  for an election. The order, printed in due form, was shown to me,\r\n  but as I did not retain it, I cannot give you a copy. If the people,\r\n  on their own motion, wish to hold a peaceful meeting, I suppose you\r\n  need not hinder them.[209]\r\n\r\nIt has elsewhere been observed that a Legislature representing what\r\nremained of the restored government was chosen at the time of Mr.\r\nPierpont’s election. This body, however, was but the merest shadow of\r\nthe Assembly of that once proud Commonwealth. Seven Delegates responded\r\nto the roll call when the House convened in December, 1863. They\r\nadjourned from day to day and on the 9th of that month organized with\r\neight members in the popular branch. Precisely how many Senators\r\ncomposed the upper House does not appear in any notice of their\r\nproceedings accessible to the writer; the aggregate number in both\r\nchambers, however, is said not to have exceeded 16.[210] This estimate\r\nis probably correct; for in the election, February 4, 1864, of a\r\nSecretary of State and a Treasurer the total vote on joint ballot was\r\nonly 14.[211]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that neither Mr. Lincoln nor Governor Pierpont regarded\r\nthis organization as anything more than a nucleus around which the loyal\r\nelements might rally. Both Congress and the military authorities,\r\nhowever, treated it with scant courtesy. It is not matter of surprise,\r\ntherefore, that memorials were presented to the United States Senate\r\npetitioning for the substitution of a military for this feeble civil\r\ngovernment. To offset this movement remonstrances from citizens of\r\nAlexandria and from citizens of Loudoun County were offered, January 17,\r\n1865, by Senator Willey, of West Virginia. All the memorials of both\r\nclasses were referred to the Committee on Territories.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Willey credentials of Hon. Joseph Segar, Senator-elect from\r\nVirginia, were presented, February 17, 1865, to supply the vacancy\r\ncaused by the death of Lemuel J. Bowden. Mr. Willey moved that the\r\ncredentials be read and placed on the files, and that the oath of office\r\nbe administered to Mr. Segar. The credentials were read and immediately\r\nafter Mr. Sumner moved that the papers be referred to the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary. Senator Willey opposed the reference. The credentials, he\r\nbelieved, were proper on their face; they came to the Senate in due form\r\nunder the seal of the State of Virginia. Mr. Segar was the accredited\r\nsuccessor of Mr. Bowden, who died while a member of Congress. If Mr.\r\nBowden was entitled to a seat his successor was likewise entitled if his\r\ncredentials were regular and correct.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan also opposed the reference because he did not think it wise to\r\nabandon the policy hitherto pursued in dealing with loyal minorities in\r\nthe rebellious States. He would be sorry, he said, if these States were\r\nrepulsed when they were desirous to do all they could to achieve the\r\nvery end for which the present tremendous struggle was taking place.\r\nWhen Mr. Bowden came to take his seat no such objection was made. A\r\nquestion by Senator Hale developed the fact, however, that Mr. Bowden\r\npresented himself before the vote was taken on the admission of West\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nTrumbull believed that a reference of the credentials, just as in the\r\nArkansas case, would bring up the question. Senator Howard, who favored\r\na reference, thought that the entire question of the right of Virginia\r\nto be represented in Congress should be gone into. He would thank the\r\ncommittee for a concise account of all the proceedings connected with\r\nthe election of Mr. Segar and his colleague. He asked whether a State\r\nlike Virginia, in armed rebellion, could have Senators on that floor.\r\n\r\nMr. Saulsbury pointed out the change that had come over the judgment of\r\nthe Senate. When Messrs. Willey and Carlile appeared there was, he said,\r\nbut a corporal’s guard who opposed their right to seats, because\r\nVirginia was in rebellion, and it was then held by the minority that\r\nSenators should represent the sovereignty of their States. Those who\r\nwere then most zealous for the admission of the gentlemen claiming to\r\nrepresent Virginia had become most vehement in their opposition to the\r\nadmission of Mr. Segar.\r\n\r\nSenator McDougall believed that to refer the proposition to the\r\ncommittee would be to bury it, and no resurrection, he said, had been\r\nproclaimed for any such thing. He had his impressions and was as well\r\nprepared to discuss the question then as at any time. Virginia,\r\naccording to his understanding of the philosophy of the Constitution,\r\nwas a State of the Union. He believed the Senator-elect, by reason of\r\nhis credentials, could take the oath, though that was not conclusive of\r\nhis right to a seat in the Senate.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson, of Massachusetts, believed that Congress because of its\r\naction for three years was bound to recognize the existence of both the\r\nGovernor and Legislature of Virginia. He was disposed, however, to\r\nsupport the motion of his colleague, Charles Sumner, as well as the\r\namendment thereto which authorized the committee to inquire into the\r\nelection, returns and qualifications in the case of the claimant.\r\nCertain parts of Virginia, exempted by the President’s proclamation,\r\nwere not in rebellion. Every square mile additional over which Federal\r\nauthority was restored came by the terms of that proclamation into the\r\nsame condition.\r\n\r\nMr. Willey asserted that the Legislature sneeringly referred to as “the\r\nCommon Council of Alexandria” represented 216,000 loyal people. He\r\nbelieved that county after county, as fast as they were relieved from\r\nthe power of the rebellion, would come to the support of the loyal\r\nnucleus at Alexandria. It would place the Senate, he said, in a singular\r\nposition to repulse the claimant while his State was represented by\r\nanother Senator [Carlile].\r\n\r\nSenator Sherman stated that Mr. Segar’s credentials purported to show\r\nthat he had been elected a member of the Senate on the 8th of December\r\nand that they bore date of December 12, 1864. Therefore he had slept for\r\nsixty or seventy days on his right to a seat which would, at any rate,\r\nexpire on the 4th of March. The succeeding Congress, he said, would have\r\nample time to decide the question, for, no doubt, at that time a\r\ngentleman claiming to be a Senator from Virginia would present himself.\r\nThen it could be deliberately determined. His motion to lay the\r\ncredentials on the table prevailed by a vote of 29 to 13.[212] When this\r\naction was taken Carlile was among the eight absentees.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a proclamation of the President the Senate assembled at noon\r\nof March 4 in executive session. Five days later the question of\r\nadmitting Senators from Virginia came again before the Senate on\r\npresentation by Mr. Doolittle of the credentials of Hon. John C.\r\nUnderwood as Senator-elect from that State for six years from the 4th of\r\nMarch. His credentials were read and after some discussion it was agreed\r\nto postpone their consideration as well as those of Mr. Segar until the\r\nfollowing session. Henderson and Doolittle spoke in favor of the early\r\nrecognition by Congress of the local governments in those States which\r\nhad been brought partly under Federal power. The account of Virginian\r\naffairs will be resumed in the final chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol. Hist., p. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol.

The parent State,\r\n  however, by an act of December 5, 1865, had already repealed both the\r\n  statutes of January 31 and February 4, 1863, as well as section two of\r\n  the act of May 13, 1862; and on December 11, 1866, a bill in equity\r\n  was filed in the Supreme Court of the United States in which it was\r\n  contended that it was not the intention of that State to consent to\r\n  the annexation of Berkeley and Jefferson counties except upon the\r\n  performance of certain conditions; the state of the county on election\r\n  day was such as not to permit the opening of all the polls in Berkeley\r\n  and Jefferson, nor indeed at any considerable part of the usual\r\n  election places. The voters did not have adequate notice. In short, a\r\n  great majority of them were then and now, December, 1866, opposed to\r\n  annexation. Other irregularities are alleged in the complaint of\r\n  Virginia. A decision, however, has been rendered by the Supreme Court\r\n  of the United States in favor of the new Commonwealth.

The principal events which marked the progress of\r\nsecession in those States, the military successes which brought Federal\r\nauthorities to consider the restoration of loyal governments within\r\ntheir borders, and the operation of those causes which ultimately\r\noverthrew rebellion have been more rapidly sketched. To trace the\r\nsuccessive steps which led to the emancipation of slaves in the seceding\r\nStates a somewhat more ample narrative will be required. This subject is\r\nnot only of intrinsic interest but its culmination in the proclamation\r\nof September 22, 1862, marks the introduction into the President’s plan\r\nof restoration of an element hitherto left out of account.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1859, when John Brown, for his rash though courageous\r\nattempt to liberate slaves, was hanged by the authorities of Virginia a\r\ngreat majority of even Northern people looked on with indifference or\r\nwith approval. The inhabitants of the free States, however, were rather\r\nlaw-abiding than pitiless and came in time to revere the memory of that\r\nstern old Puritan. Ideas in those times matured with amazing rapidity,\r\nand fourteen months had scarcely elapsed when James B. McKean, a\r\nRepresentative from New York, introduced into Congress, three days\r\nbefore the Confederate government was organized, the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the “Gulf States” have assumed to secede from the Union, and\r\n  it is deemed important to prevent the “border slave States” from\r\n  following their example; and whereas it is believed that those who\r\n  are inflexibly opposed to any measure of compromise or concession\r\n  that involves, or may involve, a sacrifice of principle or the\r\n  extension of slavery, would nevertheless cheerfully concur in any\r\n  lawful measure for the emancipation of slaves: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the select committee of five be instructed to\r\n  inquire whether, by the consent of the people, or of the State\r\n  governments, or by compensating the slaveholders, it be practicable\r\n  for the General Government to procure the emancipation of the slaves\r\n  in some, or all, of the “border States”; and if so, to report a bill\r\n  for that purpose.[213]\r\n\r\nMr. Burnett, of Kentucky, desiring to discuss the proposition, it was\r\nlaid on the table and received no further consideration. Whether Mr.\r\nLincoln had much reflected upon the principle of this resolution or the\r\nreasoning in its preamble, he had not become on March 4 a convert to its\r\nessential idea, for in his inaugural address he was content, in\r\nexpressing his sentiments on the institution of slavery, to re-affirm a\r\ndeclaration which he had formerly made. “I have no purpose,” said he,\r\n“directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in\r\nthe States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so,\r\nand I have no inclination to do so.”[214] Even if the occasion had not\r\ndemanded the language of conciliation we might easily credit this solemn\r\nassurance. Indeed, for an entire year after this announcement he\r\nrefrained in his public utterances from taking any attitude hostile to\r\nthe continuance of slavery. The influences which forced him to adopt\r\nother opinions may be briefly related.\r\n\r\nOn May 22, 1861, General Butler arrived at Fortress Monroe and at once\r\ntook command of the Department of Virginia; next day he sent a\r\nreconnoitering party to Hampton, and in the terror and confusion\r\noccasioned by the presence of Yankee soldiers three slaves of Colonel\r\nMallory, a Confederate officer, effected their escape; during the\r\nafternoon they remained in concealment and at night reached the Union\r\npickets. The following morning they were brought before the Federal\r\ncommander, whom they informed of their master’s purpose to employ them\r\nin military operations in North Carolina. On the next day Major John B.\r\nCary, also of the Confederate army, and a former delegate with Butler in\r\nthe Baltimore Convention, came to the fort with a flag of truce, and as\r\na representative of Colonel Mallory demanded the surrender of these\r\nrunaways pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Constitution under\r\nwhich the Union commander claimed to act. With characteristic readiness\r\ncame the reply that the Fugitive Slave Law could not be invoked in this\r\ncase; Virginia assumed to be a foreign State and she must count it among\r\nthe disadvantages of her position if, so far at least, she was taken at\r\nher word. These negroes further informed General Butler or his officers\r\nthat if they were not returned others would come next day. On the 26th\r\neight slaves were before him awaiting an audience; one squad of\r\nforty-seven came early on the 27th and another lot of a dozen arrived\r\nduring the same day. Then they came by twenties, thirties and forties\r\nboth to Fortress Monroe and Newport News.[215]\r\n\r\nThus arose an important question on which the Government had yet\r\ndeveloped no policy. As the acts for the rendition of fugitive slaves\r\nwere not repealed till June, 1864, the views of individual commanders\r\ntemporarily prevailed. Without precedent or instructions General\r\nMcDowell by an order entirely excluded them from his lines. Caprice,\r\ntoo, entered into a settlement of the problem, and even a whimsical\r\nsolution was sometimes attempted. A felicitous invention for determining\r\nthese controversies between master and bondman is ascribed to the\r\ncolonel of a Massachusetts regiment. Both the claimant and the claimed\r\nwere put outside his tent for a trial of speed; the negro, proving the\r\nfleeter, was never heard of again.[216] An institution which had\r\npractically determined both the foreign and domestic policy of the\r\nUnited States for an entire generation was suddenly become the sport of\r\na subordinate officer of volunteers! The wise should have heeded these\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nWhile the Federal commander in Virginia was exchanging arguments with\r\nConfederate officers, General McClellan at his headquarters in\r\nCincinnati was considering a proclamation which on May 26 he issued to\r\nthe Union men of western Virginia. This document, among other things,\r\nsays: “All your rights shall be religiously respected, notwithstanding\r\nall that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe our\r\nadvent among you will be signalized by an interference with your slaves.\r\nUnderstand one thing clearly: not only will we abstain from all such\r\ninterference, but we will, on the contrary, _with an iron hand crush any\r\nattempt at insurrection on their part_.”[217]\r\n\r\nScarcely less explicit in its announcement concerning slavery was\r\nGeneral Patterson’s proclamation of June 3, 1861, to troops of the\r\nDepartment of Pennsylvania. “You must bear in mind,” says its concluding\r\nparagraph, that “you are going for the good of the whole country, and\r\nthat, while it is your duty to punish sedition, you must protect the\r\nloyal, _and, should the occasion offer, at once suppress servile\r\ninsurrection_.”[218]\r\n\r\nButler’s interview with Major Cary had been promptly communicated to the\r\nWar Department, whose chief, Mr. Cameron, expressed in his reply of May\r\n30 approval of the General’s action. The Secretary, however, endeavored\r\nto distinguish between interference with slave property and the\r\nsurrender of negroes that came voluntarily within Federal lines. The\r\ncommander was further directed to “employ such persons in the services\r\nto which they may be best adapted, keeping an account of the labor by\r\nthem performed, of the value of it, and the expenses of their\r\nmaintenance,”[219] the question of their final disposition to be\r\nreserved for future determination.\r\n\r\nIn defence of his attitude toward masters of fugitives who had been\r\nemployed in the batteries or on the fortifications of the enemy,\r\ninternational law supplied General Butler with an analogy that he\r\nskillfully applied to the novel conditions which had arisen. Articles of\r\nassistance in military operations cannot in time of war be imported by\r\nneutrals into an enemy’s country, and the attempt to introduce such\r\ngoods renders them liable to seizure as lawful prize. It did not greatly\r\nembarrass this versatile lawyer that the term _contraband_ applies\r\nexclusively to relations between a belligerent and a neutral, or that\r\nthe decision of a prize court might be necessary to determine whether a\r\nparticular article had been so designated. No doubt he believed firmly\r\nin the doctrine that the wants of war are contraband of war. In his\r\ncorrespondence with General Scott he had observed that “as a military\r\nquestion, it would seem to be a measure of necessity” to deprive\r\ndisloyal masters of the services of their slaves, and this, on the\r\npretext that they were contraband of war, he proceeded to do by refusing\r\nto surrender any negroes coming inside his lines.[220] This method of\r\nsettling the difficulty was what Secretary Cameron had approved. But\r\nthis phase presented the question in its extreme simplicity. A refusal\r\nto return the slaves of Confederate officers or of Confederate\r\nsympathizers was one thing; similar treatment of loyal slaveholders\r\nwould not be so readily overlooked by authority. Though such cases were\r\nmore likely to occur in Maryland, Kentucky or Missouri, that fact did\r\nnot prevent the subject from assuming very great importance even in\r\nVirginia. Whole families escaped from their masters, and General Butler\r\nsoon had on his hands negroes from three months to almost fourscore\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nAttorney-General Bates, writing July 23, 1861, to United States Marshal\r\nJ. L. McDowell, of Kansas, who had asked whether he should give his\r\nofficial service in executing the fugitive slave law, said in response\r\nto the inquiry:\r\n\r\n  It is the President’s constitutional duty to “take care that the\r\n  laws be faithfully executed.” That means all the laws. He has no\r\n  right to discriminate, no right to execute the laws he likes, and\r\n  leave unexecuted those he dislikes. And of course you and I, his\r\n  subordinates, can have no wider latitude of discretion than he has.\r\n  Missouri is a State in the Union. The insurrectionary disorders in\r\n  Missouri are but individual crimes, and do not change the legal\r\n  status of the State, nor change its rights and obligations as a\r\n  member of the Union.\r\n\r\n  A refusal by a ministerial officer to execute any law which properly\r\n  belongs to his office, is an official misdemeanor, of which I have\r\n  no doubt the President would take notice.[221]\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General in this instance merely amplified a suggestion\r\ncontained in the inaugural.\r\n\r\nToward the close of July, 1861, the number of “contrabands” had\r\nincreased to nine hundred, and the Union commander again requested\r\ninstructions.[222] Secretary Cameron’s reply on the 8th of August\r\nfollowing merely authorized, what General Butler had all along been\r\ndoing, employing them at such labor as they were adapted to and keeping\r\na complete record, so that when peace was restored the essential facts\r\nof each case could easily be ascertained.[223] His tact in dealing with\r\nthis question appears from an act of Congress approved August 6 in which\r\nhis extension of meaning to the word _contraband_ is adopted. This\r\ndeclared that if persons held to labor or service were employed in\r\nhostility to the United States, the right to their services should be\r\nforfeited and such persons be discharged therefrom.[224]\r\n\r\nExclusion of fugitive slaves from the quarters and camps of troops\r\nserving in the Department of Washington was provided by a general order\r\nof July 17, 1861, and a few weeks later, August 10, the departure by\r\nrailway of negroes from the District of Columbia was prevented unless\r\nevidence of freedom could be adduced.[225]\r\n\r\nFar more important, however, than these prudent regulations of the\r\nAdjutant-General was the celebrated proclamation of Fremont, dated St.\r\nLouis, August 31, 1861, which declared martial law throughout the entire\r\nState of Missouri and expressed a purpose both to confiscate the\r\nproperty and free the negroes of all persons in the State who should\r\ntake up arms against the United States or who were shown to have taken\r\nan active part with their enemy in the field.[226] The President, in a\r\ncommunication of September 2 following, wrote General Fremont expressing\r\nanxiety concerning the effects of this proclamation: “I think there is\r\ngreat danger,” said Mr. Lincoln, “that the closing paragraph, in\r\nrelation to the confiscation of property and the liberating slaves of\r\ntraitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them\r\nagainst us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky.[227]\r\n\r\n“Allow me therefore to ask that you will, as of your own motion, modify\r\nthat paragraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections of the\r\nact of Congress entitled, ‘An act to confiscate property used for\r\ninsurrectionary purposes,’ approved August 6, 1861, and a copy of which\r\nact I herewith send you.\r\n\r\n“This letter is written in a spirit of caution, and not of\r\ncensure.”[228]\r\n\r\nThough General Fremont had acted wholly on his own responsibility he\r\nrefused so to modify that portion of his proclamation relative to\r\nemancipating slaves as to conform to the act of Congress referred to,\r\nand in a letter requested the President “openly to direct” him “to make\r\nthe correction.” Referring to this part of his communication Mr. Lincoln\r\nreplied on the 11th: “Your answer, just received, expresses the\r\npreference on your part that I should make an open order for the\r\nmodification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore ordered that\r\nthe said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and\r\nconstrued, as to conform to, and not to transcend, the provisions on the\r\nsame subject contained in the act of Congress” approved August 6,\r\n1861.[229]\r\n\r\nAs late as October 14 the War Department was guided by the principles\r\ndeveloped in its correspondence with Butler, the instructions of that\r\ndate to General T. W. Sherman being based upon this policy.[230] A month\r\nlater inhabitants of the eastern shore of Virginia were informed by\r\nGeneral Dix that “special directions have been given not to interfere\r\nwith the condition of any person held to domestic service;” to prevent\r\nany such occurrence slaves were not permitted to come within his\r\nlines.[231]\r\n\r\nBesides those who favored military emancipation, a large class seriously\r\nexpected that the war would not only preserve the integrity of the\r\nUnion, but in some way result in a general liberation of slaves. This\r\nfeeling, manifested in various ways, was rapidly gathering strength, and\r\nas early as November 8 found enthusiastic expression at a public meeting\r\nof two thousand citizens held in Cooper Institute, New York city. This\r\nassembly, which convened at the suggestion of Mr. Lincoln, was presided\r\nover by Hon. George Bancroft and attended by many distinguished persons\r\nof both the nation and the State. Besides the remarks of its illustrious\r\nchairman addresses were made by William Cullen Bryant, General Ambrose\r\nBurnside, Professor Francis Lieber and others. Shortly before the\r\nspeakers arrived a gentleman arose in the audience, and in a ringing\r\nvoice proposed “Three cheers for John C. Fremont!” These were given,\r\nsays a newspaper account, “with electrical effect and without a murmur\r\nof dissent.” The meeting was evidently not in entire sympathy with the\r\nPresident’s order modifying that General’s proclamation of the preceding\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina, as is well known, was not so ardent for secession as\r\nmost of her sister States in the South; forced to take sides, however,\r\nshe imitated the example of her neighbors. Even then all her people did\r\nnot share the opinions of their leaders, and when Federal troops landed\r\nin the vicinity of Hatteras nearly four thousand loyal inhabitants of\r\nthe coast flocked to their lines and readily took the oath of allegiance\r\nto the United States; for this conduct they incurred the extreme hatred\r\nof secessionists, who soon reduced them to a condition of distress. To\r\nrelieve their destitution, by supplies of food and clothing, the meeting\r\nwas called in Cooper Institute. Resolutions of sympathy were unanimously\r\nadopted; a committee of relief was appointed to collect from the city\r\nand elsewhere such funds as were necessary for the purchase of supplies,\r\nwhich were to be forwarded and distributed in the most judicious manner.\r\n\r\n“If the President,” said Mr. Bancroft, “has any doubt under the terrible\r\nconflict into which he has been brought, let him hear the words of one\r\nof his predecessors. Alien nullification raised itself in South\r\nCarolina. Andrew Jackson, in the watches of the night, as he sat alone\r\nfinishing that proclamation, sent the last words of it to Livingston,\r\nhis bosom friend and best adviser. He sent it with these words; I have\r\nhad the letter in my own hands, handed to me by the only surviving child\r\nof Mr. Livingston. I know the letter which I now read is a copy: ‘I\r\nsubmit the above as the conclusion of the proclamation for your\r\namendment and revision. Let it receive your best flight of eloquence to\r\nstrike to the heart and speak to the feelings of my deluded countrymen\r\nof South Carolina. The Union must be preserved without blood if this be\r\npossible; but it must be preserved at all hazards and at any price.’”\r\nMr. Bancroft added: “We send the army into the South to maintain the\r\nUnion, to restore the validity of the Constitution. If any one presents\r\nclaims under the Constitution, let him begin by placing the Constitution\r\nin power, by respecting it and upholding it.”\r\n\r\nFrancis Lieber referred to slavery as “that great anachronism, out of\r\ntime, out of place in the nineteenth century,” and Rev. Doctor Tyng\r\nsaid, “if slavery is in the way of the Union, then tread slavery down\r\ninto the dust.”[232] These sentiments were received with applause.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft a week later wrote to the President:\r\n\r\n  Following out your suggestion, a very numerous meeting of\r\n  New-Yorkers assembled last week to take measures for relieving the\r\n  loyal sufferers of Hatteras. I take the liberty to enclose you some\r\n  remarks which I made on the occasion. You will find in them a copy\r\n  of an unpublished letter of one of your most honored predecessors,\r\n  with which you cannot fail to be pleased.\r\n\r\n  Your administration has fallen upon times which will be remembered\r\n  as long as human events find a record. I sincerely wish to you the\r\n  glory of perfect success. Civil War is the instrument of Divine\r\n  Providence to root out social slavery. Posterity will not be\r\n  satisfied with the result unless the consequences of the war shall\r\n  effect an increase of free States. This is the universal expectation\r\n  and hope of men of all parties.[233]\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Mr. Lincoln sent this reply:\r\n\r\n  I esteem it a high honor to have received a note from Mr. Bancroft\r\n  inclosing the report of proceedings of a New York meeting taking\r\n  measures for the relief of Union people of North Carolina. I thank\r\n  you and all others participating for this benevolent and patriotic\r\n  movement.\r\n\r\n  The main thought in the closing paragraph of your letter is one\r\n  which does not escape my attention, and with which I must deal in\r\n  all due caution, and with the best judgment I can bring to it.[234]\r\n\r\nWe have here the key to President Lincoln’s treatment of the slavery\r\nquestion down to the hour of his lamented death. As the hostile\r\nemployment of negroes constituted by act of August 6 a full answer to\r\nany claim for service General McClellan was informed by Secretary\r\nSeward, December 4, 1861, that the arrest of such persons as fugitives\r\nfrom labor “should be immediately followed by the military arrest of the\r\nparties making the seizure.” These instructions were called forth by\r\nintelligence that Virginia slaves engaged in hostility to the United\r\nStates frequently escaped from the enemy and took refuge within the\r\nlines of the Army of the Potomac. Coming afterward into the District of\r\nColumbia, such persons upon the presumption arising from color, were\r\nliable to be arrested by the Washington police.[235]\r\n\r\nOn December 3, 1861, in his first annual message to Congress, Mr.\r\nLincoln discussed without especial emphasis the question of aiding those\r\nslaves who had been freed under the act of August 6; he observed that\r\nthis class was dependent upon the United States; it was believed that,\r\nfor their own benefit, many of the States would enact similar laws; he\r\ntherefore recommended Congress to provide for accepting such persons\r\nfrom the States,\r\n\r\n  according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, _pro tanto_, of direct\r\n  taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States\r\n  respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the General\r\n  Government, be at once deemed free; and that, in any event, steps be\r\n  taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned, if\r\n  the other shall not be brought into existence) at some place or\r\n  places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider,\r\n  too, whether the free colored people already in the United States\r\n  could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such\r\n  colonization.\r\n\r\n  To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of\r\n  territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be\r\n  expended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the\r\n  acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of\r\n  constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The\r\n  power was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the\r\n  purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great\r\n  expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of\r\n  acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure\r\n  effects that object; for the emigration of colored men leaves\r\n  additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr.\r\n  Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana\r\n  more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for\r\n  population.\r\n\r\n  On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with\r\n  the acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to\r\n  absolute necessity—that without which the Government itself cannot\r\n  be perpetuated?\r\n\r\n  The war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for\r\n  suppressing the insurrection, I have been anxious and careful that\r\n  the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a\r\n  violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore,\r\n  in every case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union\r\n  prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving\r\n  all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more\r\n  deliberate action of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n  In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade\r\n  of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by\r\n  proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at the last session for\r\n  closing those ports.\r\n\r\n  So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence as well as the\r\n  obligations of law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the\r\n  act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary\r\n  purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its\r\n  propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved; and\r\n  hence all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in\r\n  haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may\r\n  reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.[236]\r\n\r\nThe President’s mastery of national affairs is seen in the ability and\r\nthoroughness with which he treated a great variety of important public\r\nquestions; though his message touches with the utmost delicacy the\r\nparamount issue of slavery it really marked an advance in his position.\r\nHowever, he was not yet abreast of the aggressive anti-slavery party in\r\nthe 37th Congress, which had just commenced its first regular session.\r\n\r\nThe “increase of free States,” which Mr. Bancroft hoped would result\r\nfrom the war, and which President Lincoln’s reply shows had not escaped\r\nhis attention, was not to be effected by military emancipation in the\r\nfield but by the voluntary action of the States themselves. The caution\r\nand judgment which he brought to bear on this subject are apparent from\r\neven a casual examination of the message, which refers to the number of\r\nslaves that had been freed by the incidents of war, and to the extreme\r\nprobability that still others would be liberated in its progress. It\r\ncontained also a recommendation of colonization, a topic which had long\r\nbeen familiar to Americans both North and South. To any new law\r\nemancipating slaves for the participation of their masters in rebellion,\r\nhe promised to give due consideration. This part of the message had the\r\nadditional merit of being easily expanded into a more definite policy.\r\nIt was this characteristic prudence that led the President to suppress\r\nthe following remarks in a report which the Secretary of War had\r\nprepared for the opening of Congress in December, 1861:\r\n\r\n  If it shall be found that the men who have been held by the rebels\r\n  as slaves are capable of bearing arms and performing efficient\r\n  military service, it is the right, and may become the duty, of this\r\n  government to arm and equip them, and employ their services against\r\n  the rebels, under proper military regulation, discipline, and\r\n  command.[237]\r\n\r\nAny legislation, or even any extended debate, on these recommendations\r\nwas prevented by questions deemed more urgent by Congress. Indeed, the\r\nPresident does not appear to have seriously expected favorable action at\r\nthis time upon his suggestions, for he resumed certain efforts which he\r\nhad been carefully considering. He believed that by the pressure of war\r\nnecessities the border States might be induced to take up the idea of\r\nvoluntary emancipation if the General Government would pay their\r\ncitizens the full property value of the slaves they were asked to\r\nliberate; and this experiment seemed most feasible in the small State of\r\nDelaware, which retained only the merest fragment of a property interest\r\nin the institution.\r\n\r\nEven before the appearance of his message a plan of compensated\r\nabolishment had taken definite form in the mind of the President, for\r\nabout November 26 he had prepared a draft of a bill for gradual\r\nemancipation in Delaware.[238] Through Congressman George P. Fisher the\r\nproposition was laid before the General Assembly of that State and\r\nreceived favorable consideration in the lower House. By the Senate,\r\nwhich convened November 25, 1861, it was taken up for discussion on\r\nFebruary 7 succeeding. Upon the question, 4 voted in favor and 4 against\r\nconcurring in the action of the more popular branch of the Legislature.\r\nThe remaining Senator, McFerran, was absent or silent and is not\r\naccounted for in the journal of this special session. Therefore the\r\nmeasure was returned non-concurred in to the other chamber. The\r\nfollowing preamble and joint resolution relative to the proposed\r\nemancipation bill are self-explanatory. The Federal suggestion was\r\nrepelled as an unwarranted interference in the domestic concerns of that\r\nState:\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, There has been circulating among the members of this\r\n  General Assembly a printed draft for a law to be entitled “An act\r\n  for the gradual emancipation of slaves in the State of Delaware with\r\n  just compensation to their owners”; _and whereas_ many of the\r\n  members of this General Assembly have been requested to support it,\r\n  the said draft being in the following words: [Then follows the\r\n  title, together with the twenty-one sections composing the bill. To\r\n  which is added:] _And whereas_ it is uncertain that said proposition\r\n  will be submitted to this General Assembly for its action,\r\n  nevertheless, viewing it to be unworthy of their support, they\r\n  desire to place upon record the grounds of their condemnation;\r\n  therefore\r\n\r\n  _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of\r\n  Delaware in General Assembly met_, That the members of this\r\n  Legislature were not elected with a view to the passage of any act\r\n  for the emancipation of slaves, but with the understanding, either\r\n  expressed or implied, that legislation upon the distracting subject\r\n  of slavery was hostile to the public peace, and therefore to be\r\n  avoided; that the passage of the act drafted as aforesaid, inasmuch\r\n  as it renders Congressional action necessary, would, upon the\r\n  apparent application of the State of Delaware, introduce the slavery\r\n  question into Congress, would encourage the abolition element\r\n  therein, and fortify it in its purpose to destroy entirely all\r\n  property in slaves, and furthermore, would be injurious to the quiet\r\n  and harmony that prevail in this State.\r\n\r\n  _Be it further resolved by the authority aforesaid_, That it is the\r\n  opinion of this General Assembly, that Congress has no right to\r\n  appropriate a dollar for the purchase of slaves, and that such a\r\n  proposal, coming from the source to which it is traceable, evinces a\r\n  design on the part of those having control of our national affairs\r\n  to abolish slavery in the States.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved further_, That this General Assembly having in mind the\r\n  interests of the people of Delaware, are not willing, especially at\r\n  a time of financial embarrassment, to make the State of Delaware a\r\n  guarantor of any debt the payment of which depends upon the mere\r\n  pledge of public faith; that the confidence of the people of this\r\n  State that nothing would ever be done to promote a disunion of our\r\n  National system, but that it would remain, as expressed by Webster\r\n  “one and inseparable, now and forever,” having been impaired by the\r\n  events of the last two years, we are and should be very cautious in\r\n  resting our obligations on the mere faith of others; that by\r\n  accepting the terms to be offered by the United States, we should,\r\n  upon grounds of the plainest equity, be held to have pledged the\r\n  faith of Delaware for the payment of nine hundred thousand dollars\r\n  as mentioned in the draft aforesaid; that, keeping in mind the fact\r\n  that the power of the nation is now put forth to suppress a\r\n  rebellion prevailing throughout a very large portion of its\r\n  territory, and that in consequence of such rebellion and the\r\n  uncertainty of its being speedily quelled, the stocks of the United\r\n  States, which heretofore brought in the market a sum far beyond the\r\n  par value thereof, are now selling at a continually increasing rate\r\n  of discount, we are unwilling to pledge the faith of Delaware (a\r\n  faith which has never been violated) that the proposed mode of\r\n  payment is safe and proper.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved further_, That when the people of Delaware desire to\r\n  abolish slavery within her borders, they will do so in their own\r\n  way, having due regard to strict equity; that any interference from\r\n  without, and all suggestions of saving expense to the people, or\r\n  others of like character, are improper to be made to an honorable\r\n  people, such as we represent, and are hereby repelled—that though\r\n  the State of Delaware is small, and her people not of the richest,\r\n  they are beyond the reach of any who would promote an end by\r\n  improper interference and solicitations.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved further_, That a copy of the foregoing resolutions, duly\r\n  attested, be transmitted to each of our Senators, and to our\r\n  Representative in Congress, to be laid before their respective\r\n  houses.[239]\r\n\r\nThus ended, so far as Delaware was concerned, the question of\r\ncompensated emancipation. Precisely why the offer of Federal assistance\r\nwas rejected nowhere clearly appears except in the records of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The high ground assumed in the resolutions was, of\r\ncourse, the only one in harmony with public opinion in the State. There\r\nare, however, some facts in the history of that Commonwealth which\r\nafford a partial explanation of the action of its Legislature. When the\r\nFederalist party as a political force had disappeared everywhere outside\r\nof New England its principles and traditions still lingered on in\r\nDelaware. The same conservative tendency, the same distrust of\r\ninnovation is seen again in the prudent manner in which the authorities\r\nof the State invested and improved her portion of the surplus revenue\r\ndistributed among the States in 1837. With a half dozen exceptions the\r\nshares allotted to other members of the Union have disappeared, in some\r\ninstances expended patriotically, in others squandered on projects more\r\nor less visionary. It has frequently been observed, too, that a\r\ncommunity whose population is chiefly agricultural is apt to view with\r\nsuspicion any financial proposition of great magnitude. Whatever the\r\ntrue explanation of her opposition to the policy of the President, the\r\nquestion at once sank to rest in Delaware; it was soon to be revived\r\nelsewhere, however, as will presently be seen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile army officers continued to determine, on their own authority,\r\nvery important questions relative to the surrender of fugitive slaves.\r\nMajor-General Halleck declared in a proclamation of February 23, 1862,\r\nthat “it does not belong to the military to decide upon the relation of\r\nmaster and slave. Such questions must be settled by the civil courts. No\r\nfugitive slave will therefore be admitted within our lines or camps,\r\nexcept when specially ordered by the General commanding.”[240] General\r\nHalleck’s order No. 3 of November 20 preceding, as it cut off an\r\nopportunity for the escape of thousands, occasioned much bitter\r\ndiscussion both in and out of Congress. By Halleck it was explained in\r\nthese words: “Unauthorized persons, black or white, free or slaves, must\r\nbe kept out of our camps, unless we are willing to publish to the enemy\r\neverything we do or intend to do.” This statement, however, does not\r\naltogether harmonize with the spirit of his order.[241]\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell up to March 6 appears to have uniformly returned this\r\nclass of persons, and on the 26th of that month General Hooker permitted\r\nnine citizens of Maryland to search for negroes supposed to have taken\r\nrefuge with some of the regiments in his division. Notwithstanding the\r\ncommander desired that no obstacles be thrown in their way, trouble\r\noccurred when the claimants showed their authority and demanded the\r\nsurrender of their slaves. They were driven from camp because fears for\r\ntheir safety were entertained by some of the officers. The anger of the\r\nsoldiers appears to have been especially aroused by the fact that when\r\nwithin a few yards of camp the slaveholders fired two pistol shots at a\r\nnegro who was running past them.[242]\r\n\r\nGeneral Doubleday’s opinion, as stated April 6, 1862, by the Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General, was, “that all negroes coming into the lines of any of\r\nthe camps or forts under his command, are to be treated as persons and\r\nnot as chattels.\r\n\r\n“Under no circumstances,” continues this regulation, “has the commander\r\nof a fort or camp the power of surrendering persons claimed as fugitive\r\nslaves, as it cannot be done without determining their character.\r\n\r\n“The additional article of war recently passed by Congress positively\r\nprohibits this.”[243]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unmistakable tone of the above, General Williams\r\nannounced two months later from his headquarters at Baton Rouge that\r\ncommanders of the camps and garrisons in that part of Louisiana were\r\nrequired to turn all fugitives beyond the limits of their guards and\r\nsentinels because of “the demoralizing and disorganizing tendencies to\r\nthe troops of harboring runaway negroes.”[244]\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show the divergence of sentiment among Federal\r\ncommanders on the rendition of fugitive slaves. The party preferences of\r\nofficers served as a rather reliable index to the treatment of the\r\nfugitive in any particular case. This confusion, it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to add, arose from the failure of Congress to pass a law on\r\nthe subject, and to a considerable degree from the absence of any\r\nclearly expressed policy by the Administration. Of the changing opinions\r\nof the President, however, we catch an occasional glimpse. Though the\r\ncontrabands at Fortress Monroe had, no doubt, brought before him the\r\nentire question of slavery, the sagacity of General Butler had postponed\r\nthe necessity of any announcement in May, 1861; but the subject could\r\nnot always be avoided, and the imprudence of Fremont forced a\r\ndeclaration in September following. The events of another year were\r\ndestined to produce changes which even the wisest could not then\r\nforesee.\r\n\r\nA new phase of this troublesome question resulted from the capture,\r\nNovember 7, of Hilton Head, South Carolina, and the Federal occupation\r\nof the Sea Islands, where the labor of slaves abandoned by their masters\r\nwas organized under authority of the Treasury Department by Mr. E. L.\r\nPierce. This was, probably, intended as nothing more than an experiment,\r\nto be extended if successful. To interest Government officials at\r\nWashington in the work among these freedmen, Mr. Pierce, at the\r\nsuggestion of Secretary Chase, called, February 15, 1862, upon the\r\nPresident, who seemed rather annoyed at the visit, and, after listening\r\na few moments, said somewhat impatiently that he did not think he ought\r\nto be troubled with such details; that “there seemed to be an itching to\r\nget negroes into our lines.” To this Mr. Pierce replied that the negroes\r\nwere domiciled there when the Union forces took possession. The\r\nPresident then handed his visitor a card by which Mr. Chase was\r\nauthorized to give what instructions he thought judicious relative to\r\nPort Royal contrabands.[245] This impatience Mr. Pierce explains by\r\nsaying that the President was in expectation of a personal bereavement.\r\nThis certainly accounts for the anxiety and apparent annoyance of Mr.\r\nLincoln, but his remark that there seemed to be an “itching” to get\r\nnegroes inside Federal lines shows that he had not yet deliberately\r\nconsidered the novel case of abandoned slaves; abandoned masters had\r\nhitherto claimed his attention. Though slowly, as it may have appeared\r\nto radical members of his own party, the President was surely\r\napproaching the great question, and on March 6, 1862, sent to Congress a\r\nmessage which recommended the adoption, and even proposed the form, of a\r\njoint resolution declaring:\r\n\r\n  That the United States ought to coöperate with any State which may\r\n  adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary\r\n  aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for\r\n  the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of\r\n  system.[246]\r\n\r\nAs one of the most efficient means of self-preservation it was\r\nrecommended by the Executive to the coördinate branch of Government; for\r\nto deprive the cotton States of the hope of being joined by the border\r\nStates would, he said, “substantially end the rebellion; and the\r\ninitiation of emancipation completely deprives them of it as to all the\r\nStates initiating it. The point is not that all the States tolerating\r\nslavery would very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation; but that\r\nwhile the offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such\r\ninitiation, make it certain to the more Southern that in no event will\r\nthe former ever join the latter in their proposed confederacy.” Gradual\r\nemancipation he believed better for all concerned. The current\r\nexpenditures of the war would soon purchase, at a fair valuation, all\r\nthe slaves in any named State. However, it was proposed as a matter of\r\nperfectly free choice. “In the annual message, last December,” continued\r\nthe President, “I thought fit to say, ‘the Union must be preserved, and\r\nhence all indispensable means must be employed.’ I said this not\r\nhastily, but deliberately. War has been made and continues to be an\r\nindispensable means to this end. A practical re-acknowledgment of the\r\nnational authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at\r\nonce cease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also\r\ncontinue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may\r\nattend and all the ruin which may follow it. Such as may seem\r\nindispensable, or may obviously promise great efficiency, toward ending\r\nthe struggle, must and will come.”\r\n\r\nThe message inquired “whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would\r\nnot be of more value to the States and private persons concerned than\r\nare the institution and property in it, in the present aspect of\r\naffairs?”[247]\r\n\r\nThis was really a great step in advance; by many it was regarded as a\r\ndirect and positive interference with the domestic institutions of the\r\nStates; it was certainly a preliminary movement to get rid of slavery.\r\nThe deliberate opinion of the Delaware Legislature has already been\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nEasily distinguished in principle from the opposition in Delaware were\r\nthe sentiments expressed in Virginia when the equitable and generous\r\nproposal of the President came up for consideration in the Richmond\r\nLegislature. Mr. Collier submitted to that body a preamble and\r\nresolution relative to the proposition. In the former it was said that\r\nnegro slaves having been the property of their masters for two hundred\r\nand forty years, by use and custom at first, and subsequently by\r\nrecognition of the public law, ought not to be, and could not justly be,\r\ninterfered with in such property relation by the State, by “the people\r\nin convention assembled to alter an existing constitution, or to form\r\none for admission into the confederacy, nor by the representatives of\r\nthe people of the State in the Confederate Legislature, nor by any means\r\nor mode which the popular majority might adopt; and that the State,\r\nwhilst remaining republican in the structure of its government, can\r\nlawfully get rid of that species of property, if ever, only by the free\r\nconsent of the individual owners.” For the State to deprive an\r\nindividual of this species of property would contravene the\r\nindispensable principles of free government. This view, as further\r\nexplained by its author, denied the power of even a majority, in making\r\na new State constitution, to disturb a preëxisting and resident\r\nproperty.[248]\r\n\r\nThree days after sending his recommendation to Congress, the President\r\nwrote privately to Henry J. Raymond, editor of the _New York Times_:\r\n\r\n  I am grateful to the New York journals and not less so to the\r\n  “Times” than to others, for their kind notices of the late special\r\n  message to Congress.\r\n\r\n  Your paper, however, intimates that the proposition, though well\r\n  intentioned, must fail on the score of expense. I do hope you will\r\n  reconsider this. Have you noticed the facts that less than one-half\r\n  day’s cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware at\r\n  $400 per head—that eighty-seven days’ cost of this war would pay for\r\n  all in Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Kentucky, and\r\n  Missouri at the same price? Were those States to take the step, do\r\n  you doubt that it would shorten the war more than eighty-seven days,\r\n  and thus be an actual saving of expense?\r\n\r\n  Please look at these things and consider whether there should not be\r\n  another article in the “Times.”[249]\r\n\r\nBy his request those Congressmen from the border States then in\r\nWashington called, March 10, on Mr. Lincoln, who explained that his\r\nrecent message was not inimical to the interests they represented. In\r\nthe progress of the war, slaves would come into camps and continual\r\nirritation be thus maintained. In the border States that condition kept\r\nalive a feeling of hostility to the Government. He told them further\r\n“that emancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of the\r\nStates, and must be adopted or rejected by each for itself.”[250]\r\n\r\nRelative to this interview a memorandum of the Hon. John W. Crisfield,\r\none of the Maryland Representatives present, contains the following\r\nentry: “He [the President] was constantly annoyed by conflicting and\r\nantagonistic complaints; on the one side a certain class complained if\r\nthe slave was not protected by the army; persons were frequently found\r\nwho, participating in these views, acted in a way unfriendly to the\r\nslave-holder; on the other hand, slaveholders complained that their\r\nrights were interfered with, their slaves induced to abscond and\r\nprotected within the lines; these complaints were numerous, loud and\r\ndeep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the progress\r\nof the war ... [they] strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that at\r\nsome day the border States would unite with them, and thus tend to\r\nprolong the war; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should be\r\nadopted by Congress and accepted by our [the border slaveholding]\r\nStates, these causes of irritation and these hopes would be removed, and\r\nmore would be accomplished toward shortening the war than could be hoped\r\nfrom the greatest victory achieved by Union armies; ... that he did not\r\nclaim nor had this Government any right to coerce them” to accept the\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Noell’s remark that the _New York Tribune_ favored the measure\r\nand understood it to mean that gradual emancipation must be accepted or\r\nthe border States would get something worse, the President replied that\r\nhe must not be expected to quarrel with that journal before the right\r\ntime; he hoped never to have to do it. The message having said that “all\r\nindispensable means must be employed” to preserve the Union, Mr.\r\nCrisfield inquired pointedly, what would be the effect of the refusal of\r\na State to accept this proposal. Did the President, he asked, look “to\r\nany policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of this scheme.” Mr.\r\nLincoln candidly replied that he had “no designs beyond the action of\r\nthe States on this particular subject,” though he should lament their\r\nrefusal to accept it. Mr. Crisfield said “he did not think the people of\r\nMaryland looked upon slavery as a permanent institution; and he did not\r\nknow that they would be very reluctant to give it up if provision was\r\nmade to meet the loss and they could be rid of the race; but they did\r\nnot like to be coerced into emancipation, either by the direct action of\r\nthe Government or by indirection, as through the emancipation of slaves\r\nin this District, or the confiscation of Southern property as now\r\nthreatened; and he thought before they would consent to consider this\r\nproposition they would require to be informed on these points.” The\r\nPresident answered that “unless he was expelled by the act of God or the\r\nConfederate armies, he should occupy that house for three years; and as\r\nlong as he remained there Maryland had nothing to fear either for her\r\ninstitutions or her interests on the points referred to.” Representative\r\nCrisfield immediately added: “Mr. President, if what you now say could\r\nbe heard by the people of Maryland, they would consider your proposition\r\nwith a much better feeling than I fear without it they will be inclined\r\nto do.” To this Mr. Lincoln said that a publication of his sentiments\r\nwould not do; it would force him before the proper time into a quarrel\r\nwhich was impending with the Greeley faction. This he desired to\r\npostpone, or, if possible, altogether to avoid.\r\n\r\nTo an objection of Governor Wickliffe, of Kentucky, he said that the\r\nresolution proposed would be considered rather as the expression of a\r\nsentiment than as involving any constitutional question. He did not know\r\nhow the project was received by the members from the free States; some\r\nof them had spoken to him and received it kindly; but for the most part\r\nthey were as reserved and chary as the border State delegations; he\r\ncould not tell how they would vote.[251]\r\n\r\nTo James A. McDougall, of California, who was making some opposition in\r\nthe Senate, he sent, March 14, this private communication while the\r\nresolution was still pending:\r\n\r\n  As to the expensiveness of gradual emancipation with the plan of\r\n  compensation, proposed in the late message, please allow me one or\r\n  two brief suggestions.\r\n\r\n  Less than one half day’s cost of this war would pay for all the\r\n  slaves in Delaware at four hundred dollars per head.\r\n\r\n  Thus, all the slaves in Delaware by the census of 1860,        1,798\r\n    are....\r\n\r\n                                                                   400\r\n\r\n                                                             —————————\r\n\r\n  Cost of slaves                                              $719,200\r\n\r\n  One day’s cost of the war                                  2,000,000\r\n\r\n                                                             =========\r\n\r\n  Again, less than eighty-seven days’ cost of this war would, at the\r\n  same price, pay for all in Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia,\r\n  Kentucky, and Missouri.\r\n\r\n           Thus, slaves in Delaware                    1,798\r\n                           Maryland                   87,188\r\n                           District of Columbia        3,181\r\n                           Kentucky                  225,490\r\n                           Missouri                  114,965\r\n                                                ————————————\r\n                                                     432,622\r\n                                                         400\r\n                                                ————————————\r\n           Cost of slaves                       $173,048,800\r\n           Eighty-seven days’ cost of war        174,000,000\r\n                                                ============\r\n\r\n  Do you doubt that taking the initiatory steps on the part of those\r\n  States and this District would shorten the war more than\r\n  eighty-seven days, and thus be an actual saving of expense?\r\n\r\n  A word as to the time and manner of incurring the expense. Suppose,\r\n  for instance, a State devises and adopts a system by which the\r\n  institution absolutely ceases therein by a named day—say January 1,\r\n  1882. Then let the sum to be paid to such a State by the United\r\n  States be ascertained by taking from the census of 1860 the number\r\n  of slaves within the State, and multiplying the number by four\r\n  hundred—the United States to pay such sums to the State in twenty\r\n  equal annual installments, in six per cent. bonds of the United\r\n  States.\r\n\r\n  The sum thus given, as to time and manner, I think, would not be\r\n  half as onerous as would be an equal sum raised now for the\r\n  indefinite prosecution of the war; but of this you can judge as well\r\n  as I. I enclose a census table for your convenience.[252]\r\n\r\nOn the same day of the conference with the border State delegations,\r\nMarch 10, the resolution, in precisely the language suggested by the\r\nPresident, was introduced by Roscoe Conkling, and on the following day\r\nby a vote of 89 to 31 passed the House.[253] The Senate by 32 yeas to 10\r\nnays took favorable action upon it on the 2d of April succeeding.[254]\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that at this time, March, 1862, the Government\r\nset up no claim of a right by Federal authority to interfere with\r\nslavery within the limits of a State; also that public opinion in the\r\nNorth had advanced to the position occupied by Representative McKean\r\nmore than a year before, when he introduced into Congress his resolution\r\nfor compensated emancipation.[255]\r\n\r\nAt a session, May 28, 1862, of the Union Convention of Baltimore its\r\nBusiness Committee reported a series of resolutions which were adopted\r\nunanimously, among them one approving the wise and conservative policy\r\nproposed by the President in his message of March 6; that it was not\r\nonly the duty but the interest of the loyal people of Maryland to accept\r\nthe offer of pecuniary aid tendered by the Government to inaugurate an\r\nequitable plan of emancipation and colonization.[256] This was the dawn\r\nof emancipation in Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe President approved, April 16, six days after the passage of his\r\ncherished measure, an act prohibiting slavery and liberating slaves in\r\nthe District of Columbia. It included both compensation to owners and\r\nthe principle of colonization.[257]\r\n\r\nShortly before its passage, April 17, a resolution was favorably\r\nconsidered by the House to appoint a committee of nine empowered to\r\nreport whether any plan could be proposed and recommended for the\r\ngradual emancipation of all African slaves and the extinction of slavery\r\nin Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri by the\r\npeople or local authorities thereof, and how far and in what way the\r\nUnited States could and ought equitably to aid in facilitating either of\r\nthe above objects. This measure was adopted by a vote of 67 to 52, and\r\none week later a committee was appointed by the Speaker.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hunter by an order of April 25 had extended martial law over\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Two weeks later he proclaimed\r\npersons in those States heretofore held as slaves forever free. “Slavery\r\nand martial law in a free country” he declared “altogether\r\nincompatible.” The President in his proclamation of May 19, 1862,\r\nrescinding this order once more reveals his sentiments on the slavery\r\nquestion. The act of the Department commander, he said, was wholly\r\nunauthorized. The document continues: “I further make known that,\r\nwhether it be competent for me, as Commander-in-Chief of the army and\r\nnavy, to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at\r\nany time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to\r\nthe maintenance of the Government to exercise such supposed power, are\r\nquestions which, under my responsibility, I reserve to myself, and which\r\nI cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the\r\nfield.”[258]\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln took this opportunity to point out to those most nearly\r\nconcerned the unmistakable signs of the times, and earnestly appealed to\r\nthem to embrace the offer of compensated abolishment, quoting upon that\r\nsubject the joint resolution of Congress. The order of General Hunter,\r\nso far as it concerned the President, could have been dismissed by its\r\ndisavowal; but he went farther: he not only took advantage of this\r\noccasion earnestly to urge upon the border States very serious\r\nconsideration of the principle of compensated emancipation, but he\r\nraised, without pausing to discuss it, the question of his right as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army and navy to declare the freedom of slaves\r\nwithin the limits of a State should such a measure become indispensable\r\nto the maintenance of the Union.\r\n\r\nFor refusing to employ his regiment in returning fugitive slaves of\r\ndisloyal masters, Colonel Paine, of the Fourth Wisconsin Volunteers, was\r\nplaced under arrest in the summer of 1862; about the same time\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Anthony was similarly disciplined both for refusing\r\npermission to search his camp and for ordering the arrest of those\r\nhunting for slaves.[259]\r\n\r\nInstructions from the War Department, dated July 22, and applying to all\r\nthe States in rebellion except South Carolina and Tennessee, authorized\r\nthe employment as laborers of so many persons of African descent as the\r\nmilitary and naval commanders could use to advantage, and the payment of\r\nreasonable wages for their labor.[260]\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1862, Representative Lovejoy proposed a bill, a substitute\r\nfor one previously reported by him and introduced by Mr. Isaac N.\r\nArnold:\r\n\r\n  To the end that freedom may be and remain forever the fundamental\r\n  law of the land in all places whatsoever, so far as it lies within\r\n  the powers or depends upon the action of the Government of the\r\n  United States to make it so: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n  United States of America in Congress assembled_, That slavery or\r\n  involuntary servitude, in all cases whatsoever (other than in the\r\n  punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\n  convicted) shall henceforth cease, and be prohibited forever in all\r\n  the Territories of the United States, now existing, or hereafter to\r\n  be formed or acquired in any way.[261]\r\n\r\nThis measure passed by 85 yeas to 50 nays. In the Senate, June 9, it was\r\nreported amended by inserting this substitute: “That from and after the\r\npassage of this act there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude in any of the Territories of the United States now existing,\r\nor which may at any time hereafter be formed or acquired by the United\r\nStates, otherwise than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall\r\nhave been duly convicted.” In this form it passed by a vote of 28 to 10\r\nand the House concurred by 72 yeas to 38 nays.[262]\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner, writing June 5, 1862, to a correspondent who was\r\nimpatient at what seemed the short-comings of the President, says:\r\n\r\n  Your criticism of the President is hasty. I am confident that, if\r\n  you knew him as I do, you would not make it.\r\n\r\n  Of course, the President cannot be held responsible for all the\r\n  misfeasances of subordinates, unless adopted or at least tolerated\r\n  by him. And I am sure that nothing unjust or ungenerous will be\r\n  tolerated, much less adopted, by him.\r\n\r\n  I am happy to let you know that he has no sympathy with Stanly in\r\n  his absurd wickedness, closing the schools, nor again in his other\r\n  act of turning our camp into a hunting ground for slaves. He\r\n  repudiates both—positively. The latter point has occupied much of\r\n  his thought; and the newspapers have not gone too far in recording\r\n  his repeated declarations, which I have often heard from his own\r\n  lips, that slaves finding their way into the national lines are\r\n  never to be re-enslaved. This is his conviction, expressed without\r\n  reserve.\r\n\r\n  Could you have seen the President—as it was my privilege often—while\r\n  he was considering the great questions on which he has already\r\n  acted—the invitation to emancipation in the States, emancipation in\r\n  the District of Columbia, and the acknowledgment of the independence\r\n  of Hayti and Liberia—even your zeal would have been satisfied, for\r\n  you would have felt the sincerity of his purpose to do what he could\r\n  to carry forward the principles of the Declaration of Independence.\r\n  His whole soul was occupied, especially by the first proposition,\r\n  which was peculiarly his own. In familiar intercourse with him, I\r\n  remember nothing more touching than the earnestness and completeness\r\n  with which he embraced this idea. To his mind, it was just and\r\n  beneficent while it promised the sure end of slavery. Of course, to\r\n  me who had already proposed a bridge of gold for the retreating\r\n  fiend, it was most welcome. Proceeding from the President, it must\r\n  take its place among the great events of history.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I wish that you really knew the President, and had heard the artless\r\n  expression of his convictions on these questions which concern you\r\n  so deeply. You might, perhaps, wish that he were less cautious, but\r\n  you would be grateful that he is so true to all that you have at\r\n  heart. Believe me, therefore, you are wrong, and I regret it the\r\n  more because of my desire to see all our friends stand firmly\r\n  together.[263]\r\n\r\nThe President requested and obtained, July 12, 1862, an interview with\r\nthe border State delegations. The near adjournment of Congress would\r\ndeprive him of an opportunity of seeing them for several months. He\r\nbelieved they held more power for good than any other equal number of\r\nmembers, and felt that the duty of making an appeal to them could not be\r\nwaived. This he did by reading a carefully prepared paper.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate States, he said, would cling to the hope of an ultimate\r\nunion with the border States as long as they perpetuated the institution\r\nof slavery. If the members had supported his plan of gradual\r\nemancipation in the preceding March the rebellion would now, 1862, be\r\nsubstantially ended.\r\n\r\nLooking to the stern facts in the case he inquired whether they could do\r\nbetter for their States than to follow the course which he urged. If the\r\nwar continued long, the institution “will be extinguished by mere\r\nfriction and abrasion,”—by the incidents of war much of its value was\r\nalready gone. He did not speak of immediate emancipation, “but of a\r\ndecision at once to emancipate gradually.” Room for colonization could\r\nbe procured in South America ample and cheap enough. When their numbers\r\nincreased sufficiently to be company for one another the freed people\r\nwould not be so reluctant to go. His repudiation of General Hunter’s\r\nproclamation had given offence to some whose support the Government\r\ncould not afford to lose. The pressure from such persons was still upon\r\nhim and the Congressmen from the border slave States could relieve him\r\nand the country. He begged them to reexamine his message of March 6, and\r\ncommend it to the consideration of their constituents. The peril of\r\ntheir common country demanded the loftiest views and the boldest action\r\nif they desired to perpetuate popular government.[264]\r\n\r\nIt was represented to him, in a conversation which followed this appeal,\r\nthat the resolution of Congress, being no more than an expression of\r\nsentiment, could not be regarded by them as a basis for substantial\r\naction. Mr. Lincoln admitted that, as a condition of taking into\r\nconsideration a proposition so nearly affecting their social system, the\r\nborder slave States were entitled to expect a substantial pledge of\r\npecuniary aid.\r\n\r\nIt was further represented at this conference that the people of the\r\nborder States were interested in knowing the great importance which Mr.\r\nLincoln attached to the policy in question, while it was equally due to\r\nthe country, to the President and to themselves that they should\r\npublicly announce the motives under which they were called to act, and\r\nthe considerations of public policy urged upon them and their\r\nconstituents. With a view to such a statement of their position the\r\nmembers met in council to deliberate on the reply they should make, and\r\ntwo days later the majority sent the following paper to the President:\r\n\r\n“The undersigned ... have listened to your address with the profound\r\nsensibility naturally inspired by the high source from which it\r\nemanates, the earnestness which marked its delivery, and the\r\noverwhelming importance of the subject of which it treats. We have given\r\nit our most respectful consideration, and now lay before you our\r\nresponse....\r\n\r\n“... Repudiating the dangerous heresies of the secessionists, we\r\nbelieved, with you, that the war on their part is aggressive and wicked,\r\nand the objects for which it was to be prosecuted on ours, defined by\r\nyour message at the opening of the present Congress, to be such as all\r\ngood men should approve. We have not hesitated to vote all supplies\r\nnecessary to carry it on vigorously....”\r\n\r\nThis support, continues the response, was yielded “in the face of\r\nmeasures most distasteful to us and injurious to the interests we\r\nrepresent, and in the hearing of doctrines, avowed by those who claim to\r\nbe your friends, [which] must be abhorrent to us and our constituents.”\r\n\r\nThe greater number of them did not, however, vote for the measure\r\nrecommended in his message of March 6, and they proceeded to state the\r\nprincipal reasons which influenced their action. First, it proposed a\r\nradical change in their social system; it was hurried through both\r\nHouses with undue haste; and was passed without any opportunity whatever\r\nfor consultation with their constituents, whose interests it deeply\r\ninvolved. “It seemed,” said the majority, “like an interference by this\r\nGovernment with a question which peculiarly and exclusively belonged to\r\nour respective States, on which they had not sought advice or solicited\r\naid. Many of us doubted the constitutional power of this Government to\r\nmake appropriations of money for the object designated, and all of us\r\nthought our finances were in no condition to bear the immense outlay\r\nwhich its adoption and faithful execution would impose upon the national\r\nTreasury. If we pause but a moment to think of the debt its acceptance\r\nwould have entailed, we are appalled by its magnitude. The proposition\r\nwas addressed to all the States and embraced the whole number of\r\nslaves.”\r\n\r\nThe census of 1860 showed a slave population of nearly 4,000,000; from\r\nnatural increase the number in 1862 exceeded that. “At even the low\r\naverage of $300, the price fixed by the emancipation act for the slaves\r\nof this District, and greatly below their real worth, their value runs\r\nup to the enormous sum of $1,200,000,000; and if to that we add the cost\r\nof deportation and colonization, at $100 each, which is but a fraction\r\nmore than is actually paid by the Maryland Colonization Society, we have\r\n$400,000,000 more. They were not willing nor could the country bear a\r\ntax sufficient to pay the interest on that sum in addition to the vast\r\nand daily increasing debt already fixed upon them by the exigencies of\r\nthe war. The proposition is nothing less than the deportation from the\r\ncountry of $1,600,000,000 worth of producing labor and the substitution\r\nof an interest-bearing debt of the same amount. Even if it were expected\r\nthat only the border States would accept the proposition, that involved\r\na sum too great for the financial ability of the Government at this\r\ntime. The total number of slaves in those States according to the late\r\ncensus was 1,196,112. The same rate of valuation with expenses of\r\ndeportation and colonization gives the enormous sum of $478,038,133.\r\n\r\n“We did not feel that we should be justified in voting for a measure\r\nwhich, if carried out, would add this vast amount to our public debt at\r\na moment when the Treasury was reeling under the enormous expenditure of\r\nthe war.”\r\n\r\nTo them the resolution seemed no more than the enunciation of a\r\nsentiment. “No movement was then made to provide and appropriate the\r\nfunds required to carry it into effect; and we were not encouraged to\r\nbelieve that funds would be provided. And our belief has been fully\r\njustified by subsequent events. Not to mention other circumstances, it\r\nis quite sufficient for our purpose to bring to your notice the fact\r\nthat, while this resolution was under consideration in the Senate our\r\ncolleague, the Senator from Kentucky, moved an amendment appropriating\r\n$500,000 to the object therein designated, and it was voted down with\r\ngreat unanimity. What confidence, then, could we reasonably feel that if\r\nwe committed ourselves to the policy it proposed, our constituents would\r\nreap the fruits of the promise held out; and on what ground could we, as\r\nfair men, approach them and challenge their support?”\r\n\r\nThey denied that if, as the President alleged, they had supported the\r\nresolution of March 6, the war would be substantially ended, and they\r\nadded, “The resolution has passed and if there be virtue in it, it will\r\nbe quite as efficacious as if we had voted for it.”\r\n\r\nThe war, they asserted, was prolonged not by reason of their conduct,\r\nbut because of the union of all classes in the South. Those who wished\r\nto break down national independence and set up State domination, the\r\nState-rights party, could not be reconciled; but the large class who\r\nbelieved their domestic interests had been assailed by the Government\r\nmight be if only they were convinced “that no harm is intended to them\r\nand their institutions,” but that the Government was simply defending\r\nits legitimate authority.\r\n\r\n“Twelve months ago,” adds this response, “both Houses of Congress,\r\nadopting the spirit of your message, then but recently sent in, declared\r\nwith singular unanimity the objects of the war, and the country\r\ninstantly bounded to your side to assist you in carrying it on. If the\r\nspirit of that resolution had been adhered to, we are confident that we\r\nshould before now have seen the end of this deplorable conflict. But\r\nwhat have we seen?\r\n\r\n“In both Houses of Congress we have heard doctrines subversive of the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, and seen measure after measure founded\r\nin substance on those doctrines proposed and carried through which can\r\nhave no other effect than to distract and divide loyal men, and\r\nexasperate and drive still further from us and their duty the people of\r\nthe rebellious States. Military officers, following these bad examples,\r\nhave stepped beyond the just limits of their authority in the same\r\ndirection, until in several instances you have felt the necessity of\r\ninterfering to arrest them.... The effect of these measures was\r\nforetold, and may now be seen in the indurated state of Southern\r\nfeeling.”\r\n\r\nTo these causes, and not to the failure of the border delegations to\r\nsupport the measure, they attributed the terrible earnestness of those\r\nin arms against the Government. Nor was the institution of slavery the\r\nsource of insurgent strength, but rather the apprehension that the\r\npowers of a common Government would be wielded against the institutions\r\nof the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe reply concludes: “If Congress, by proper and necessary legislation,\r\nshall provide sufficient funds and place them at your disposal, to be\r\napplied by you to the payment of any of our States or the citizens\r\nthereof who shall adopt the abolishment of slavery, either gradual or\r\nimmediate, as they may determine, and the expense of deportation and\r\ncolonization of the liberated slaves, then will our State[s] and people\r\ntake this proposition into careful consideration, for such decision as\r\nin their judgment is demanded by their interest, their honor, and their\r\nduty to the whole country.”[265]\r\n\r\nThe minority, seven in number, in their reply of the 15th declared\r\nthemselves ready to make any sacrifice to save the Government and the\r\ninstitutions of their fathers, and promised to ask the people of their\r\nStates calmly, deliberately and fairly to consider the recommendations\r\nof the President; they were encouraged to assume this position because\r\nthe leaders of the rebellion had offered to abolish slavery among them\r\nas a condition of foreign intervention in favor of their independence as\r\na nation.[266]\r\n\r\nHorace Maynard, though not representing a border State proper, expressed\r\nhis approval of the President’s policy and stated the physical\r\nimpossibility of submitting to the consideration of his people that or\r\nany other proposition until Tennessee had first been freed from hostile\r\narms.[267]\r\n\r\nA fourth paper submitted to the President was that of Senator J. B.\r\nHenderson, of Missouri, who had cheerfully supported the measure at the\r\ntime of its introduction; he believed the proposition would have\r\nreceived the approbation of a large majority of the border State\r\ndelegations if they could have foreseen that the war would have been\r\nprotracted a twelvemonth and had felt assured that the dominant party in\r\nCongress would, like the President, be as prompt in practical action as\r\nthey had been in the expression of a sentiment. “In this period of the\r\nnation’s distress,” says Senator Henderson, “I know of no human\r\ninstitution too sacred for discussion; no material interest belonging to\r\nthe citizen that he should not willingly place upon the altar of his\r\ncountry, if demanded by the public good.”[268]\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson did not agree with the opinion of the President that “the\r\nwar would now be substantially ended” had the members from the border\r\nStates supported the measure in the preceding March. Personally he was\r\nfavorable to the proposition, but remembered that he was the servant not\r\nthe master of the people of Missouri.\r\n\r\nTo the sudden and unexpected collapse of McClellan’s Richmond campaign\r\nhas been ascribed the determination of President Lincoln to adopt\r\ngeneral military emancipation so much sooner than he otherwise would\r\nhave done. The great and decisive element of military strength in the\r\nslave population which he saw so clearly a little later could not even\r\nthen, June and July, 1862, have been altogether concealed from his keen\r\ninsight into affairs. His personal appeal to the border Congressmen was\r\nmade July 12; the result of that conference he easily anticipated. Nor\r\nwas the receipt of their written replies necessary to inform him that\r\nhis offer would be rejected. So much he could readily collect from their\r\noral objections and verbal criticisms. The decision to give notice of\r\nhis intention to issue a proclamation concerning slavery was probably\r\nmade within a few hours after he had assured Mr. Crisfield that the\r\nemancipation policy extended no farther than to a refusal of the border\r\nStates to accept his tender of pecuniary aid to any commonwealth\r\nvoluntarily adopting the plan of gradual abolishment. However this may\r\nbe, he confided on the following day, July 13, 1862, to Secretaries\r\nSeward and Welles his intention to emancipate slaves by proclamation if\r\ntheir masters did not cease to make war on the Government. From the\r\ndiary of the latter, we learn under what circumstances this important\r\ncommunication was made.\r\n\r\n  President Lincoln [writes Mr. Welles] invited me to accompany him in\r\n  his carriage to the funeral of an infant child of Mr. Stanton.\r\n  Secretary Seward and Mrs. Frederick Seward were also in the\r\n  carriage. Mr. Stanton occupied at that time, for a summer residence,\r\n  the house of a naval officer, some two or three miles west or\r\n  northwesterly of Georgetown. It was on this occasion and on this\r\n  ride that he first mentioned to Mr. Seward and myself the subject of\r\n  emancipating the slaves by proclamation in case the rebels did not\r\n  cease to persist in their war on the Government and the Union, of\r\n  which he saw no evidence. He dwelt earnestly on the gravity,\r\n  importance, and delicacy of the movement; said he had given it much\r\n  thought, and had about come to the conclusion that it was a military\r\n  necessity, absolutely essential for the salvation of the nation,\r\n  that we must free the slaves or be ourselves subdued, etc., etc.\r\n  This was, he said, the first occasion where he had mentioned the\r\n  subject to any one, and wished us to frankly state how the\r\n  proposition struck us. Mr. Seward said the subject involved\r\n  consequences so vast and momentous that he should wish to bestow on\r\n  it mature reflection before giving a decisive answer; but his\r\n  present opinion inclined to the measure as justifiable, and perhaps\r\n  he might say expedient and necessary. These were also my views. Two\r\n  or three times on that ride the subject, which was of course an\r\n  absorbing one for each and all, was adverted to, and before\r\n  separating, the President desired us to give the subject special and\r\n  deliberate attention, for he was earnest in the conviction that\r\n  something must be done. It was a new departure for the President,\r\n  for until this time, in all our previous interviews, whenever the\r\n  question of emancipation or the mitigation of slavery had been in\r\n  any way alluded to, he had been prompt and emphatic in denouncing\r\n  any interference by the General Government with the subject. This\r\n  was, I think, the sentiment of every member of the Cabinet, all of\r\n  whom, including the President, considered it a local domestic\r\n  question appertaining to the States respectively, who had never\r\n  parted with their authority over it. But the reverses before\r\n  Richmond, and the formidable power and dimensions of the\r\n  insurrection, which extended through all the slave States and had\r\n  combined most of them in a confederacy to destroy the Union,\r\n  impelled the Administration to adopt extraordinary measures to\r\n  preserve the national existence. The slaves, if not armed and\r\n  disciplined, were in the service of those who were, not only as\r\n  field laborers and producers, but thousands of them were in\r\n  attendance upon the armies in the field, employed as waiters and\r\n  teamsters, and the fortifications and intrenchments were constructed\r\n  by them.[269]\r\n\r\nThe session of Congress was drawing to a close, but before adjournment\r\nthe Confiscation Act, passed July 17, 1862, was approved by the\r\nPresident. This with kindred laws increased the number of forfeitures of\r\ntitle to slaves for the crimes of treason and rebellion. These penalties\r\nwere by him considered just and their imposition constitutional.\r\n\r\nWithin five days after the adjournment of Congress the President, July\r\n21, 1862, reached his final conclusions on the subject of emancipation.\r\nThe diary of Secretary Chase contains the following record:\r\n\r\n  [Having received notice of a Cabinet meeting, Mr. Chase says:] I\r\n  went to the President’s at the appointed hour and found that he was\r\n  profoundly concerned at the present aspect of affairs, and had\r\n  determined to take some definite steps in respect to military action\r\n  and slavery. He had prepared several orders, the first of which\r\n  contemplated authority to commanders to subsist their troops in the\r\n  hostile territory; the second, authority to employ negroes as\r\n  laborers; the third, requiring that both in case of property taken\r\n  and negroes employed, accounts should be kept with such degree of\r\n  certainty as would enable compensation to be made in proper cases.\r\n  Another provided for the colonization of negroes in some tropical\r\n  country.\r\n\r\n  A good deal of discussion took place upon these points. The first\r\n  order was unanimously approved. The second was also unanimously\r\n  approved; and the third by all except myself. I doubted the\r\n  expediency of attempting to keep accounts for the benefit of\r\n  inhabitants of rebel States. The colonization project was not much\r\n  discussed.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of War presented some letters from General Hunter, in\r\n  which General Hunter advised the Department that the withdrawal of a\r\n  large proportion of his troops to reënforce General McClellan\r\n  rendered it highly important that he should be immediately\r\n  authorized to enlist all loyal persons without reference to\r\n  complexion. Mr. Stanton, Mr. Seward, and myself expressed ourselves\r\n  in favor of this plan, and no one expressed himself against it. Mr.\r\n  Blair was not present. The President was not prepared to decide the\r\n  question, but expressed himself as averse to arming negroes.[270]\r\n\r\nThis Cabinet meeting came to no final conclusion, and, as we learn from\r\nthe same source, the discussion was resumed on the following day, July\r\n22, when the question of arming the slaves was brought up.\r\n\r\n  I advocated it warmly [writes Secretary Chase].[271] The President\r\n  was unwilling to adopt this measure, but proposed to issue a\r\n  proclamation on the basis of the Confiscation Bill, calling upon the\r\n  States to return to their allegiance—warning rebels that the\r\n  provisions of the act would have full force at the expiration of\r\n  sixty days—adding, on his own part, a declaration of his intention\r\n  to renew, at the next session of Congress, his recommendation of\r\n  compensation to States adopting gradual abolishment of slavery—and\r\n  proclaiming the emancipation of all slaves within States remaining\r\n  in insurrection on the first day of January, 1863.[272]\r\n\r\nMr. Chase promised the measure his cordial support, but preferred that\r\nno new expression on the subject of compensation be made at that time.\r\nSecretary Chase, in the diary mentioned, says: “The impression left upon\r\nmy mind by the whole discussion was, that, while the President thought\r\nthat the organization, equipment, and arming of negroes, like other\r\nsoldiers, would be productive of more evil than good, he was not\r\nunwilling that commanders should, at their discretion, arm for purely\r\ndefensive purposes, slaves coming within their lines.”[273] On the\r\nkindred policy of emancipation, however, the President had reached a\r\ndefinite conclusion which was in advance of the opinions entertained by\r\neven the most radical members of his Cabinet. When, therefore, he read\r\nto them, on July 22, his draft of an emancipation proclamation they were\r\nfor the most part taken completely by surprise. This momentous document\r\ndeserves to be reproduced entire.\r\n\r\n  In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled\r\n  “An act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and\r\n  rebellion, to seize and confiscate property of rebels, and for other\r\n  purposes,” approved July 17, 1862, and which act and the joint\r\n  resolution explanatory thereof are herewith published, I, Abraham\r\n  Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim to and\r\n  warn all persons within the contemplation of said sixth section to\r\n  cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or abetting the\r\n  existing rebellion, or any rebellion, against the Government of the\r\n  United States, and to return to their proper allegiance to the\r\n  United States, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and\r\n  by said sixth section provided.\r\n\r\n  And I hereby make known that it is my purpose, upon the next meeting\r\n  of Congress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure\r\n  for tendering pecuniary aid to the free choice or rejection of any\r\n  and all States which may then be recognizing and practically\r\n  sustaining the authority of the United States, and which may then\r\n  have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt,\r\n  gradual abolishment of slavery within such State or States; that the\r\n  object is to practically restore, thenceforward to be maintained,\r\n  the constitutional relation between the General Government and each\r\n  and all the States wherein that relation is now suspended or\r\n  disturbed; and that for this object the war, as it has been, will be\r\n  prosecuted. And as a fit and necessary military measure for\r\n  effecting this object, I as Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy\r\n  of the United States, do order and declare that on the first day of\r\n  January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\r\n  sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or States\r\n  wherein the constitutional authority of the United States shall not\r\n  then be practically recognized, submitted to, and maintained, shall\r\n  then, thenceforward, and forever be free.[274]\r\n\r\nThe diary of Secretary Chase, as well as the President’s endorsement on\r\nhis draft, shows the emancipation proclamation to have been read to the\r\nCabinet July 22, 1862. Various suggestions were offered; but except an\r\nobjection of Secretary Seward they had all been fully anticipated by Mr.\r\nLincoln and settled in his own mind. Secretary Seward said: “Mr.\r\nPresident, I approve of the proclamation, but I question the expediency\r\nof its issue at this juncture. The depression of the public mind,\r\nconsequent upon our repeated reverses, is so great that I fear the\r\neffect of so important a step. It may be viewed as the last measure of\r\nan exhausted Government, a cry for help; the Government stretching forth\r\nits hands to Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to\r\nthe Government.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking afterwards of this incident, Mr. Lincoln said: “Seward’s idea\r\nwas ‘that it would be considered our last _shriek_ on the retreat. Now,’\r\nadded Mr. Seward, ‘while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that you\r\npostpone its issue, until you can give it to the country supported by\r\nmilitary success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon\r\nthe greatest disasters of the war!’ The wisdom of this view,” said Mr.\r\nLincoln in recalling the occasion, “struck me with very great force. It\r\nwas an aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the subject, I\r\nhad entirely overlooked. The result was that I put the draft of the\r\nproclamation aside, as you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a\r\nvictory.”[275]\r\n\r\nInstead of the proclamation so carefully discussed, a short one was\r\npublished three days later, of which the most important part is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled\r\n  “An act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and\r\n  rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for\r\n  other purposes,” approved July 17, 1862, and which act, and the\r\n  joint resolution explanatory thereof, are herewith published, I,\r\n  Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim\r\n  to and warn all persons within the contemplation of said sixth\r\n  section to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or\r\n  abetting the existing rebellion, or any rebellion, against the\r\n  Government of the United States, and to return to their proper\r\n  allegiance to the United States, on pain of the forfeitures and\r\n  seizures as within and by said sixth section provided.[276]\r\n\r\nThis warning was required by the sixth section of the act mentioned.\r\n\r\nDuring the following month President Lincoln waited patiently for\r\ntidings of some unquestioned success that would justify the publication\r\nof his proclamation, but when instead he received in the closing days of\r\nAugust intelligence of the second disaster at Manassas his anxiety must\r\nhave become intense. This victory, together with the succession of\r\nothers recently attending Confederate arms, encouraged General Lee’s\r\ninvasion of Maryland. An army, notwithstanding its late reverses, still\r\nformidable in numbers and once more thoroughly reorganized marched\r\nleisurely from the vicinity of Washington to locate and destroy him.\r\nWhen, where or how the battle-cloud would break was uncertain. All eyes\r\nwere turned on McClellan, again in command of the Union forces and\r\nstrengthened by every soldier that could be spared from the defences of\r\nthe Federal capital. It was in this state of suspense, and on the very\r\nday, September 13, that Lee’s victorious legions entered Frederick City\r\nthat the President gave audience to a deputation from the religious\r\ndenominations of Chicago, presenting a memorial for the immediate issue\r\nof an emancipation proclamation, which was enforced by some remarks from\r\nthe chairman. The President replied that he had for weeks past, even for\r\nmonths, thought much upon the subject of their memorial.\r\n\r\n“I am approached,” said he, “with the most opposite opinions and advice,\r\nand that by religious men, who are equally certain that they represent\r\nthe Divine will. I am sure that either the one or the other class is\r\nmistaken in that belief, and perhaps, in some respect, both. I hope it\r\nwill not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God\r\nwould reveal His will to others, on a point so connected with my duty,\r\nit might be supposed He would reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am\r\nmore deceived in myself than I often am, it is my earnest desire to know\r\nthe will of Providence in this matter. And if I can learn what it is I\r\nwill do it! These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose\r\nit will be granted that I am not to expect a direct revelation. I must\r\nstudy the plain physical facts of the case, ascertain what is possible,\r\nand learn what appears to be wise and right.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the subject and the impossibility of even\r\nanti-slavery men, in or out of Congress, agreeing upon any measure of\r\nemancipation were then referred to. However, he would discuss the merits\r\nof the case and asked pointedly:\r\n\r\n“What good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially\r\nas we are now situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole\r\nworld will see must necessarily be inoperative.... Would my word free\r\nthe slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the rebel\r\nStates? Is there a single court, or magistrate, or individual that would\r\nbe influenced by it there?”\r\n\r\nHe admitted to his visitors, however, that he raised no objections to\r\nsuch a proclamation as they desired on legal or on constitutional\r\ngrounds; for, continued he, “as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy,\r\nin time of war I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may\r\nbest subdue the enemy, nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in\r\nview of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the South.\r\nI view this matter as a practical war measure, to be decided on\r\naccording to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the\r\nsuppression of the rebellion.”\r\n\r\nThe committee replied, and the President added, “I admit that slavery is\r\nat the root of the rebellion.... I will also concede that emancipation\r\nwould help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by\r\nsomething more than ambition. I grant, further, that it would help\r\nsomewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you\r\nrepresent imagine.... Unquestionably, it would weaken the rebels by\r\ndrawing off their laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not\r\nso sure we could do much with the blacks.”[277] The President, too,\r\ncalled attention to the fact that the border slave States had 50,000\r\nbayonets in the Union army. It would be a serious matter if in\r\nconsequence of such a proclamation they should go over to the South. In\r\nconclusion he said that he had not decided against a proclamation of\r\nliberty to the slaves, but held the matter under advisement and assured\r\nthem that the subject was on his mind by day and by night more than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt was currently reported among anti-slavery men in Illinois that the\r\nemancipation proclamation was extorted from the President by the\r\npressure of such delegations as this from the Christian Convention.[278]\r\nTo determine how little foundation there is for this opinion it is only\r\nnecessary to recall what had occurred in the Cabinet on July 22\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\nThe repulse of Lee’s veterans at Antietam, September 17, 1862, raised\r\nsomewhat the hopes of the President. On the 19th General McClellan\r\ntelegraphed an account of his victory, and Mr. Lincoln three days later\r\nannounced his intention to issue the postponed proclamation.\r\n\r\nAll the Cabinet members, having been summoned by messenger from the\r\nState Department, were in attendance at the White House on September 22,\r\n1862. After some talk of a general nature, and the reading by Mr.\r\nLincoln of a humorous chapter from a book by Artemus Ward, the\r\nconversation assumed a more serious tone. What subsequently transpired\r\non that eventful occasion we learn from the following record in the\r\ndiary of Secretary Chase:\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen, [said the President] I have, as you are aware, thought a\r\n  great deal about the relation of this war to slavery, and you all\r\n  remember that, several weeks ago, I read to you an order I had\r\n  prepared upon the subject, which, on account of objections made by\r\n  some of you, was not issued. Ever since then my mind has been much\r\n  occupied with this subject, and I have thought all along that the\r\n  time for acting on it might probably come. I think the time has come\r\n  now. I wish it was a better time. I wish that we were in a better\r\n  condition. The action of the army against the rebels has not been\r\n  quite what I should have best liked. But they have been driven out\r\n  of Maryland, and Pennsylvania is no longer in danger of invasion.\r\n  When the rebel army was at Frederick I determined, as soon as it\r\n  should be driven out of Maryland, to issue a proclamation of\r\n  emancipation, such as I thought most likely to be useful. I said\r\n  nothing to any one, but I made a promise to myself and [hesitating a\r\n  little] to my Maker. The rebel army is now driven out, and I am\r\n  going to fulfill that promise. I have got you together to hear what\r\n  I have written down. I do not wish your advice about the main\r\n  matter, for that I have determined for myself. This I say without\r\n  intending anything but respect for any one of you. But I already\r\n  know the views of each on this question. They have been heretofore\r\n  expressed, and I have considered them as thoroughly and as carefully\r\n  as I can. What I have written is that which my reflections have\r\n  determined me to say. If there is anything in the expressions I use\r\n  or in any minor matter which any one of you thinks had best be\r\n  changed, I shall be glad to receive your suggestions. One other\r\n  observation I will make. I know very well that many others might, in\r\n  this matter as in others, do better than I can; and if I was\r\n  satisfied that the public confidence was more fully possessed by any\r\n  one of them than by me, and knew of any constitutional way in which\r\n  he could be put in my place, he should have it. I would gladly yield\r\n  it to him. But though I believe that I have not so much of the\r\n  confidence of the people as I had some time since, I do not know\r\n  that, all things considered, any other person has more; and, however\r\n  this may be, there is no way in which I can have any other man put\r\n  where I am. I am here. I must do the best I can, and bear the\r\n  responsibility of taking the course which I feel I ought to take.”\r\n\r\n  The President then proceeded to read his Emancipation Proclamation,\r\n  making remarks on the several parts as he went on, and showing that\r\n  he had fully considered the subject in all the lights under which it\r\n  had been presented to him.\r\n\r\n  After he had closed, Governor Seward said: “The general question\r\n  having been decided, nothing can be said further about that. Would\r\n  it not, however, make the proclamation more clear and decided to\r\n  leave out all reference to the act being sustained during the\r\n  incumbency of the present President; and not merely say that the\r\n  Government _recognises_, but that it will maintain the freedom it\r\n  proclaims?”\r\n\r\n  I followed, saying: “What you have said, Mr. President, fully\r\n  satisfies me that you have given to every proposition which has been\r\n  made a kind and candid consideration. And you have now expressed the\r\n  conclusion to which you have arrived clearly and distinctly. This it\r\n  was your right, and, under your oath of office, your duty to do. The\r\n  proclamation does not, indeed, mark out the course I would myself\r\n  prefer; but I am ready to take it just as it is written and to stand\r\n  by it with all my heart. I think, however, the suggestions of\r\n  Governor Seward very judicious, and shall be glad to have them\r\n  adopted.”\r\n\r\n  The President then asked us severally our opinions as to the\r\n  modifications proposed, saying that he did not care much about the\r\n  phrases he had used. Every one favored the modification, and it was\r\n  adopted. Governor Seward then proposed that in the passage relating\r\n  to colonization some language should be introduced to show that the\r\n  colonization proposed was to be only with the consent of the\r\n  colonists, and the consent of the states in which the colonies might\r\n  be attempted. This, too, was agreed to, and no other modification\r\n  was proposed. Mr. Blair then said that the question having been\r\n  decided, he would make no objection to issuing the proclamation; but\r\n  he would ask to have his paper, presented some days since, against\r\n  the policy, filed with the proclamation. The President consented to\r\n  this readily. And then Mr. Blair went on to say that he was afraid\r\n  of the influence of the proclamation on the border States and on the\r\n  army, and stated, at some length, the grounds of his apprehensions.\r\n  He disclaimed most expressly, however, all objections to\r\n  emancipation _per se_, saying he had always been personally in favor\r\n  of it—always ready for immediate emancipation in the midst of slave\r\n  States, rather than submit to the perpetuation of the system.[279]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account from the diary of Secretary Chase is fully\r\ncorroborated by a narrative of Mr. Welles describing the same\r\nevent.[280] Mr. Blair, as already observed, believed the time\r\ninopportune for issuing the proclamation and feared as a result that the\r\nborder States would go over to secession. The President, however,\r\nthought the difficulty not to act as great as to act. There were two\r\nsides, he said, to that question. For months he had labored to get those\r\nStates to move in this matter, convinced in his own mind that it was\r\ntheir true interest to do so, but his labors were vain. “We must take\r\nthe forward movement,” he declared. “They would acquiesce, if not\r\nimmediately, soon; for they must be satisfied that slavery had received\r\nits death-blow from slave-owners—it could not survive the\r\nrebellion.”[281]\r\n\r\nWhen the Cabinet had concluded its deliberations the document was duly\r\nattested, the seal affixed and the President’s signature added. On the\r\nfollowing morning, September 23, 1862, the proclamation was published in\r\nfull by all the leading newspapers of the loyal States, where it excited\r\nthe most profound surprise. Indicating, as it does, the progress of\r\nopinion, it was the first great landmark of the war; behind it lay the\r\nold, before it the new order of things. The successive steps by which\r\nMr. Lincoln reached this position have been sketched in the present\r\nchapter with fullness and, it is believed, with accuracy. It has been\r\nshown how fugitive slaves escaping to the Federal lines were at first\r\nsurrendered to their masters; how soon afterward, as in the case of\r\nGeneral Butler’s command, they were protected by the army and employed\r\nas laborers; how in a later stage, certain Union commanders who proposed\r\nto confiscate slave property or to arm negroes as soldiers were gently\r\nrebuked and their acts disavowed by the President. This forbearance,\r\nhowever, was without effect on the Southern people, whose hatred was\r\nquite as likely to ascribe it to Yankee cowardice as to Yankee\r\nmagnanimity.\r\n\r\nWith this account of the introduction into the problem of reconstruction\r\nof a novel and very perplexing element we are prepared to examine the\r\nvarious theories of State status held by those whose position and\r\nability made them leaders of public opinion. That subject will be more\r\nproperly discussed in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol.

Late in the year 1816 there was organized in the city of\r\n  Washington the “National Colonization Society,” of which the expressed\r\n  purpose was to encourage emancipation by procuring a place outside the\r\n  United States, preferably in Africa, to which free negroes could be\r\n  aided in emigrating. This, it was believed, would rid the South of its\r\n  free colored population which had already become a nuisance. Until\r\n  1830 it was warmly supported everywhere, and branches of the society\r\n  were established in nearly every State. In the South its purposes were\r\n  furthered by James Madison, by Charles Carroll and by Henry Clay.\r\n  Bushrod Washington became president of the association. Rufus King and\r\n  President Harrison were among its friends in the North.\r\n\r\n  Though Texas and Mexico were looked upon as favorable places for\r\n  locating a colony of free blacks, they were sent to the British\r\n  possession of Sierra Leone. In 1821 a permanent location was purchased\r\n  in Liberia. This settlement, with Monrovia as its capital, became\r\n  independent in 1847. The American Colonization Society attracted\r\n  little notice after the rise, about 1829–30, of those known as\r\n  immediate abolitionists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  Letters and State Papers of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. II. p. 155.\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol.

There, in his effort to\r\nestablish loyal governments in three of the rebellious States, as well\r\nas in the protection and encouragement extended to reorganized Virginia,\r\nwe have seen practical applications of that theory. In his first\r\ninaugural Mr. Lincoln said: “It is safe to assert that no government\r\nproper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination,”\r\nand on the same occasion he added, “No State, upon its own mere motion,\r\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that _resolves_ and _ordinances_ to\r\nthat effect are legally void.”[282] From the principles of March 4,\r\n1861, was logically deduced the central idea of the plan announced in\r\nDecember, 1863, and maintained by the President till the last hour of\r\nhis life. In his first message to Congress, submitted at the special\r\nsession beginning July 4, 1861, he again attempted to remove the fears\r\nof those whose prejudice ascribed to the dominant political party a\r\npurpose to interfere in the domestic concerns of the slaveholding\r\nStates. As will be seen by the following quotation he little more than\r\nreiterated on that occasion what he had solemnly declared four months\r\nearlier:\r\n\r\n  Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what\r\n  is to be the course of the Government towards the Southern States\r\n  _after_ the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive\r\n  deems it proper to say, it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be\r\n  guided by the Constitution and the laws; and that he probably will\r\n  have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the\r\n  Federal Government relatively to the rights of the States and the\r\n  people, under the Constitution, than that expressed in the inaugural\r\n  address.\r\n\r\n  He desires to preserve the Government, that it may be administered\r\n  for all, as it was administered by the men who made it. Loyal\r\n  citizens everywhere have the right to claim this of their\r\n  Government, and the Government has no right to withhold or neglect\r\n  it. It is not perceived that, in giving it, there is any coercion,\r\n  any conquest, or any subjugation, in any just sense of those\r\n  terms.[283]\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph quoted expresses his perfect confidence in a\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the war, and in this respect suggests the faith\r\nof Charles Sumner, in whose private correspondence the same thought\r\nconstantly occurs. In his message the President observed also that\r\nVirginia had allowed “this giant insurrection to make its nest within\r\nher borders; and this Government has no choice left but to deal with it\r\n_where_ it finds it. And it has the less regret, as the loyal citizens\r\nhave, in due form, claimed its protection. Those loyal citizens this\r\nGovernment is bound to recognize, and protect, as being Virginia.”[284]\r\n\r\nAs early as June, 1861, Mr. Lincoln, on application of Governor\r\nPierpont, recognized the restored State of Virginia by promising\r\nassistance to repel invasion and to suppress domestic violence; his\r\nexample was followed by both Houses of Congress: first, in the prompt\r\nadmission of Senators and Representatives from that Commonwealth, and\r\nlong afterward, when there was ample time for reflection, by consenting\r\nto admit the new State of West Virginia, to whose separate and\r\nindependent existence the reorganized Legislature had formally assented.\r\nThe recognition of Pierpont’s government, however, involved on the\r\nconstitutional question little difference of opinion between the\r\nPresident and Congress. Thus far the political departments, if not in\r\ncomplete harmony, were at any rate not in conflict. This act, though it\r\nmarked no distinct Executive policy, was the occasion of some discordant\r\nnotes which will be referred to in their proper relation.\r\n\r\nIt may not be unnecessary to observe that underlying the early policy of\r\nthe President was a conviction that the rebellion was effected by a\r\nsmall but treasonable faction; indeed, in the message of July 4 he\r\nexpressed his belief that, with the probable exception of South\r\nCarolina, the disloyal were in a minority in all the seceding States.\r\nThe great mass of Southern people, it was assumed, opposed disunion, and\r\nwith Federal assistance would soon right themselves. Peaceful citizens\r\nof that section, being regarded as still under protection of the\r\nConstitution, were, therefore, not to be molested. The conflict waged by\r\nthe General Government was a personal war against insurgents. Leaders\r\nwho encouraged sedition and committed acts of hostility against the\r\nUnited States could be tried precisely as in a consolidated state like\r\nGreat Britain, and upon conviction punished for their treason. This\r\nattitude was not only wise, but had the additional merit of greatly\r\nsimplifying the method of restoration. It asserted further that the\r\nrebellious States were still in the Union, and under the existing\r\ncompact could not lawfully withdraw from it; being in the Union, they\r\nwere entitled to all the rights accorded to other members of the\r\nconfederation. In brief, its essential idea was the indestructibility of\r\na State, and it denied that the integrity of the national domain had\r\nbeen impaired or the number of States diminished by the ordinances of\r\nsecession. The General Government could properly aid the people of a\r\nState to express their will, but, beyond what was demanded by the\r\nexigencies of the war, could not legally exercise those powers\r\nconstitutionally reserved to the States. By the treasonable act of\r\nlevying war against the Republic the rights and franchises incident to\r\nUnited States citizenship were forfeited. The power of Congress extended\r\nno further than to a guaranty of preëxisting republican forms of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTo the correctness of these principles Democrats and Republicans alike\r\ngave almost universal assent. But the war was increasing in magnitude,\r\nand the measures adequate to the suppression of a gigantic rebellion\r\nproved to be very different from those adapted to a local insurrection.\r\nThe President’s original intention was to overcome armed resistance to\r\nFederal power and as speedily as possible restore the States to their\r\nformer relations. This task, however, was more easily conceived than\r\naccomplished, and in the terrible conflict that ensued political parties\r\nas well as individual statesmen were swept onward from point to point to\r\nvery different resting-places. From this condition resulted the great\r\nnumber of theories of reconstruction presented before the end of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe President early in the war adopted principles that found little\r\nfavor with conservative Democrats. His readiness to recognize the\r\nrestored State of Virginia was equivalent to a declaration that if a\r\nmajority of the people in one of the seceded States voluntarily\r\ntransferred their obedience and support to a hostile power the loyal\r\nminority constituted the State and should govern it. In this connection\r\nwill be remembered the objections of Bayard and Saulsbury to receiving\r\nSenators Willey and Carlile from the reorganized government of Virginia.\r\nA further advance is indicated by Mr. Lincoln’s appointment, early in\r\n1862, of military governors for those States that had been brought\r\npartly within Federal military lines. After the proclamation of\r\nSeptember 22, 1862, and that of January 1 succeeding, the question of\r\nrestoration was left permanently out of view. If the erring States were\r\never to resume their places they must first recognize the anti-slavery\r\nlegislation summarized in the preceding chapter. Hitherto the paramount\r\nconsideration with the President was a speedy restoration of former\r\nrelations; thenceforth “the Union as it was” became impossible, because\r\nslaves liberated in the progress of the war could never be returned to a\r\ncondition of servitude. The introduction of this element greatly\r\nincreased the difficulties of a problem already sufficiently intricate.\r\nBut neither this nor any other consequence of his proclamation appears\r\nto have been overlooked by the Executive.\r\n\r\nThe message of December 8, 1863, together with the accompanying\r\nproclamation sketched in outline the only plan which Mr. Lincoln ever\r\npublished on the subject of reconstruction, and even to this mode of\r\nreinstatement he did not require exact conformity, recognizing that its\r\nmodification might be demanded by inherent differences in situation\r\namong the returning States. By its terms all persons participated in the\r\nrebellion, except certain described classes, were promised amnesty with\r\nrestoration of property (excluding slaves and those cases of property in\r\nwhich rights of third parties intervened) upon taking an oath which\r\npledged support of the Constitution and the Union; of the slavery\r\nlegislation enacted during the war (unless such acts were repealed by\r\nCongress, or were modified or annulled by the Supreme Court), and\r\nadherence to all Executive proclamations on that subject so long and so\r\nfar as not modified or declared void by the Judiciary. Whenever in any\r\nof the rebellious States a number of persons equal to one tenth of the\r\nvoters participating in the Presidential election of 1860, who were\r\nqualified electors under the laws existing immediately before the\r\nordinance of secession, should reëstablish a State government republican\r\nin form, and not contravening this oath, it would be recognized as the\r\ntrue government of that State and should receive the benefits of the\r\nconstitutional guaranty. To the emancipated race renewed assurance of\r\npermanent freedom was given. It was also suggested that in\r\nreorganization the political framework of the States be maintained. The\r\nadmission of members elected to Congress was a matter for the\r\ndetermination of its respective Houses.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to notice in this method of reorganization, known afterward\r\nas “the Louisiana Plan,” the absence of any provision for conferring on\r\nthe freedmen the elective franchise. In a private letter to Governor\r\nHahn the President had, it is true, expressed his personal preference\r\nfor including among the electors such of the colored race as had fought\r\ngallantly in the Union ranks and also the very intelligent among\r\nthem[285]. This, however, was only an unofficial suggestion. Nor were\r\nsecurities of any sort required for the future as a condition of\r\nreinstatement.\r\n\r\nUnder this plan, which was presented as only a rallying point, Union\r\ngovernments had been inaugurated in Tennessee, Louisiana and Arkansas;\r\nthe first two participated in the Presidential election of 1864, and\r\nbefore the close of the war they had all elected members to Congress.\r\nThe legality of these governments Mr. Lincoln always maintained. How\r\nCongress regarded them will be related in succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nLong before the announcement of any mode of reorganization by the\r\nExecutive, members of the Legislative branch of Government had made some\r\nefforts in this field; these, however, were for the most part tentative\r\nand hesitant. The question had not yet been brought fairly before\r\nCongress; indeed, it was in discussing the results and tendencies of\r\nPresidential reconstruction that the Congressional plan, destined\r\nultimately to prevail, slowly assumed definitive form.\r\n\r\nAs early as December, 1861, Mr. Harlan, of Iowa, introduced into the\r\nSenate a bill for the establishment of provisional governments for the\r\nterritory embraced by the States of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Tennessee. It was referred to the\r\nCommittee on Territories, but was never reported.\r\n\r\nMore important, however, than this proposed enactment, both because of\r\nthe acknowledged position of their author and the influence which they\r\nexerted upon the mode of reconstruction finally adopted, were the nine\r\nresolutions offered, February 11, 1862, by Charles Sumner. These were\r\n“declaratory of the relations between the United States and the\r\nterritory once occupied by certain States, and now usurped by pretended\r\ngovernments, without constitutional or legal right.” A preamble in the\r\ncharacteristic style of this celebrated statesman introduced his famous\r\npropositions, which were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whereas certain States, rightfully belonging to the Union of the\r\n  United States, have through their respective governments wickedly\r\n  undertaken to abjure all those duties by which their connection with\r\n  the Union was maintained; to renounce all allegiance to the\r\n  Constitution; to levy war upon the national Government; and, for the\r\n  consummation of this treason, have unconstitutionally and unlawfully\r\n  confederated together, with the declared purpose of putting an end\r\n  by force to the supremacy of the Constitution within their\r\n  respective limits; and whereas this condition of insurrection,\r\n  organized by pretended governments, openly exists in South Carolina,\r\n  Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas,\r\n  Tennessee, and Virginia, except in Eastern Tennessee and Western\r\n  Virginia, and has been declared by the President of the United\r\n  States, in a proclamation duly made in conformity with an act of\r\n  Congress, to exist throughout this territory, with the exceptions\r\n  already named; and whereas the extensive territory thus usurped by\r\n  these pretended governments and organized into a hostile\r\n  confederation, belongs to the United States, as an inseparable part\r\n  thereof, under the sanctions of the Constitution, to be held in\r\n  trust for the inhabitants in the present and future generations, and\r\n  is so completely interlinked with the Union that it is forever\r\n  dependent thereupon; and whereas the Constitution, which is the\r\n  supreme law of the land, cannot be displaced in its rightful\r\n  operation within this territory, but must ever continue the supreme\r\n  law thereof, notwithstanding the doings of any pretended governments\r\n  acting singly or in confederation, in order to put an end to its\r\n  supremacy: Therefore:\r\n\r\n  1. _Resolved_, That any vote of secession or other act by which any\r\n  State may undertake to put an end to the supremacy of the\r\n  Constitution within its territory is inoperative and void against\r\n  the Constitution, and when sustained by force it becomes a practical\r\n  _abdication_ by the State of all rights under the Constitution,\r\n  while the treason which it involves still further works an instant\r\n  _forfeiture_ of all those functions and powers essential to the\r\n  continued existence of the State as a body politic, so that from\r\n  that time forward the territory falls under the exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction of Congress as other territory, and the State being,\r\n  according to the language of the law, _felo-de-se_, ceases to exist.\r\n\r\n  2. That any combination of men assuming to act in the place of such\r\n  State, attempting to insnare or coerce the inhabitants thereof into\r\n  a confederation hostile to the Union, is rebellious, treasonable,\r\n  and destitute of all moral authority; and that such combination is a\r\n  usurpation incapable of any constitutional existence and utterly\r\n  lawless, so that everything dependent upon it is without\r\n  constitutional or legal support.\r\n\r\n  3. That the termination of a State under the Constitution\r\n  necessarily causes the termination of those peculiar local\r\n  institutions which, having no origin in the Constitution or in those\r\n  natural rights which exist independent of the Constitution, are\r\n  upheld by the sole and exclusive authority of the State.\r\n\r\n  4. That slavery, being a peculiar local institution, derived from\r\n  local laws, without any origin in the Constitution or in natural\r\n  rights, is upheld by the sole and exclusive authority of the State,\r\n  and must therefore cease to exist legally or constitutionally when\r\n  the State on which it depends no longer exists; for the incident\r\n  cannot survive the principal.\r\n\r\n  5. That in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\n  territory once occupied by the States, it is the duty of Congress to\r\n  see that the supremacy of the Constitution is maintained in its\r\n  essential principles, so that everywhere in this extensive territory\r\n  slavery shall cease to exist practically, as it has already ceased\r\n  to exist constitutionally or legally.\r\n\r\n  6. That any recognition of slavery in such territory, or any\r\n  surrender of slaves under the pretended laws of the extinct States\r\n  by any officer of the United States, civil or military, is a\r\n  recognition of the pretended governments, to the exclusion of the\r\n  jurisdiction of Congress under the Constitution, and is in the\r\n  nature of aid and comfort to the rebellion that has been organized.\r\n\r\n  7. That any such recognition of slavery or surrender of pretended\r\n  slaves, besides being a recognition of the pretended governments,\r\n  giving them aid and comfort, is a denial of the rights of persons\r\n  who, by the extinction of the States, have become free, so that,\r\n  under the Constitution, they cannot again be enslaved.\r\n\r\n  8. That allegiance from the inhabitant and protection from the\r\n  Government are corresponding obligations, dependent upon each other,\r\n  so that while the allegiance of every inhabitant of this territory,\r\n  without distinction of color or class, is due to the United States,\r\n  and cannot in any way be defeated by the action of any pretended\r\n  Government, or by any pretence of property or claim to service, the\r\n  corresponding obligation of protection is at the same time due by\r\n  the United States to every such inhabitant, without distinction of\r\n  color or class; and it follows that inhabitants held as slaves,\r\n  whose paramount allegiance is due to the United States, may justly\r\n  look to the national Government for protection.\r\n\r\n  9. That the duty directly cast upon Congress by the extinction of\r\n  the States is reinforced by the positive prohibition of the\r\n  Constitution that “no State shall enter into any Confederation,” or\r\n  “without the consent of Congress keep troops or ships-of-war in time\r\n  of peace, or enter into any agreement or compact with another\r\n  State,” or “grant letters of marque and reprisal,” or “coin money,”\r\n  or “emit bills of credit,” or “without the consent of Congress lay\r\n  any duties on imports or exports,” all of which have been done by\r\n  these pretended Governments, and also by the positive injunction of\r\n  the Constitution, addressed to the nation, that “the United States\r\n  shall guaranty to every State in this Union a republican form of\r\n  government,” and that in pursuance of this duty cast upon Congress,\r\n  and further enjoined by the Constitution, Congress will assume\r\n  complete jurisdiction of such vacated territory where such\r\n  unconstitutional and illegal things have been attempted, and will\r\n  proceed to establish therein republican forms of government under\r\n  the Constitution; and in the execution of this trust will provide\r\n  carefully for the protection of all the inhabitants thereof; for the\r\n  security of families, the organization of labor, the encouragement\r\n  of industry, and the welfare of society, and will in every way\r\n  discharge the duties of a just, merciful and paternal\r\n  Government.[286]\r\n\r\nSumner, as already noticed, having confidence in the ultimate triumph of\r\nthe national cause, began early in the war to reflect on the subject of\r\nreorganization. As might have been expected from his previous career,\r\nhis opinion of the changes that would result from rebellion inclined him\r\nat the outset to adopt the views of the less extreme anti-slavery men.\r\nNotwithstanding this fact, however, his scheme of reconstruction,\r\nbecause of its radical and comprehensive character, caused something of\r\na sensation when introduced in the Senate, and disturbed the repose of\r\nmany conservative patriots outside. By leading Republicans it was\r\npromptly disavowed as the policy of their party. These resolutions,\r\nthough never adopted or even formally discussed by Congress, colored\r\nsomewhat the final work of reconstruction. An account of the extent and\r\nthe manner in which they influenced the legislative plan belongs\r\nproperly to a consideration of the acts of March, 1867. What appeared to\r\nbe a public necessity had by that time brought many members of his party\r\nfully abreast of Mr. Sumner.\r\n\r\nThe interval had been employed in various ways to keep his peculiar\r\ntheory before the public. A private letter to Francis Lieber, dated\r\nMarch 29, 1862, shows that Sumner’s view of the measures essential to\r\nrestoration had not been modified by the discussions of a month.\r\n“Assuming,” he says, “that our military success is complete, and that\r\nthe rebel armies are scattered, what next? Unless I am mistaken, the\r\nmost difficult thing of all,—namely, the reorganization. How shall it be\r\ndone,—by what process? What power shall set a-going the old governments?\r\nWill the people coöperate enough to constitute self-government? I have\r\npositive opinions here. If successful in war, we shall have then before\r\nus the alternative: (1) Separation; or (2) subjugation of these States\r\nwith emancipation. I do not see any escape. Diplomatists here and abroad\r\nthink it will be separation. I think the latter, under my resolutions or\r\nsomething like.”[287]\r\n\r\nBy a distinguished Confederate officer Sumner has been described as a\r\nstatesman who seemed over-educated, and who had retained without having\r\ndigested his learning;[288] by an admirer of his own party as wanting in\r\ntact and practical wisdom as a legislator.[289] Though it must be\r\nadmitted that a grain of truth forms the basis of these criticisms, yet\r\nthe letter to his friend Dr. Lieber shows no lack of insight into the\r\nevents and tendencies of the times. Without anticipating a subsequent\r\nportion of this narrative it may be observed here that if his vision did\r\nnot pierce the remote future, his knowledge and experience enabled him\r\nto see as much of coming events as the most gifted of his\r\ncontemporaries. Writing a year later, July 21, 1863, to Hon. John\r\nBright, one of our few friends in England, he remarked that “so great a\r\nrevolution cannot come to a close at once.”[290] The defeat of General\r\nLee at Gettysburg a few weeks earlier suggested the thought that the\r\ndestruction of the Army of Northern Virginia would have precipitated on\r\nCongress the entire question of reconstruction, and time was an\r\nessential element in the development of Sumner’s most cherished plans.\r\n\r\nNot only in his private correspondence and in the discussion of every\r\nconceivable measure before Congress did he endeavor to enforce his\r\ntheory of State status, but he also published in a leading periodical an\r\nelaboration and defence of his opinions. For many reasons the\r\nundelivered speech forming the basis of his article in the _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_ for October, 1863, is of remarkable interest. It reveals the\r\nmental habits of one of the most useful and influential characters then\r\nin public life; the statesman is really thinking aloud. He appears, for\r\ninstance, to have been much impressed by the fact that, under the\r\nCommonwealth, Cromwell partitioned his country into military districts\r\nof which Sumner remarked that there were precisely _eleven_, just the\r\nnumber of States in rebellion. One view is enforced by an appropriate\r\npassage from Cicero, while of Edmund Burke it is asserted that had he\r\nlived during the Civil War his eloquence would have blasted Southern\r\nleaders for their folly and madness in entering upon a career of\r\nrebellion. All who are familiar with the debates of that period must\r\nhave observed that Sumner was considerably influenced by the authority\r\nof great names, and in consequence sometimes exposed himself to rebuke\r\nfrom men who, though in many respects inferior, had studied the\r\nquestions of the day in the light of their own times.\r\n\r\nIt is not intended, however, to trace the origin of the doctrine of\r\nState suicide or even to suggest all the arguments upon which he relied\r\nfor its support, the purpose of these remarks being rather to show on\r\nwhat principles its essential propositions were based. This, it is\r\nbelieved, cannot be better done than by explaining the resolutions in\r\nhis own language.\r\n\r\nIn the _Atlantic Monthly_ he wrote: “It is sometimes said that the\r\nStates themselves committed _suicide_, so that as States they ceased to\r\nexist, leaving their whole jurisdiction open to the occupation of the\r\nUnited States under the Constitution. This assumption is founded on the\r\nfact that, whatever may be the existing governments in these States,\r\nthey are in no respect constitutional, and since the State itself is\r\nknown by the government, with which its life is intertwined, it must\r\ncease to exist constitutionally when its government no longer exists\r\nconstitutionally.”\r\n\r\nHe acknowledges the difficulty of defining the entity which we call a\r\nState. “Among us,” says Mr. Sumner, “the term is most known as the\r\ntechnical name for one of the political societies which compose our\r\nUnion.... Nobody has suggested, I presume, that any ‘State’ of our Union\r\nhas, through rebellion, ceased to exist as a _civil society_, or even as\r\na _political community_. It is only as a _State of the Union_, armed\r\nwith State rights, or at least as a _local government_, which annually\r\nrenews itself, as the snake its skin, that it can be called in question.\r\nBut it is vain to challenge for the technical ‘State,’ or for the annual\r\ngovernment, that immortality which belongs to civil society. The one is\r\nan artificial body, the other is a natural body; and while the first,\r\noverwhelmed by insurrection or war, may change or die, the latter can\r\nchange or die only with the extinction of the community itself, whatever\r\nmay be its name or its form.”\r\n\r\nPhillimore is quoted in support of the proposition that a “State,” even\r\nin a broader signification, may lose its life. That author says: “A\r\nstate, like an individual, may die,” and, among the various ways in\r\nwhich this may occur, adds, “by its submission and the donation of\r\nitself to another country.” “But in the case of our Rebel States,”\r\nresumes Mr. Sumner, “there has been a plain submission and donation of\r\nthemselves,—_effective, at least, to break the continuity of\r\ngovernment_, if not to destroy that immortality which has been claimed.\r\nNor can it make any difference, in breaking this continuity, that the\r\nsubmission and donation, constituting a species of attornment, were to\r\nenemies at home rather than to enemies abroad,—to Jefferson Davis rather\r\nthan to Louis Napoleon. The thread is snapped in one case as much as in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n“But a _change of form_ in the actual government may be equally\r\neffective. Cicero speaks of a change so complete as ‘to leave no image\r\nof a state behind.’ But this is precisely what has been done throughout\r\nthe whole Rebel region: there is no image of a _constitutional_ State\r\nleft behind.”\r\n\r\nThe first resolution of the series quoted declares “That any vote of\r\nsecession or other act by which any State may undertake to put an end to\r\nthe supremacy of the Constitution within its territory is inoperative\r\nand void against the Constitution, and when sustained by force it\r\nbecomes a practical _abdication_ by the State of all its rights under\r\nthe Constitution.” Perhaps Mr. Sumner in the essay failed to strengthen\r\nhis original statement of this proposition, which he believed was\r\n“upheld by the historic example of England, at the Revolution of 1688,\r\nwhen, on the flight of James II. and the abandonment of his kingly\r\nduties, the two Houses of Parliament voted that the monarch, ‘having\r\nviolated the fundamental laws, and having withdrawn himself out of the\r\nkingdom, _had abdicated the government_, and that the throne had thereby\r\nbecome vacant.’” This precedent, which Senator Sumner thought\r\napplicable, was by no means so formidable an argument against the\r\nrebellious States as he chose to regard it. If the term _abdicate_ is\r\nequivalent to a species of informal resignation it did not apply\r\nstrictly to the case of James II., for that unfortunate ruler presented\r\nto Englishmen the unusual spectacle of withdrawing from his kingdom\r\nunder an escort of Dutch troops. Doubtless he remembered the saying of\r\nhis father, who proved the truth of the adage in his own person, that\r\nthe distance is short between the prison and the grave of a king. The\r\nexpectation of recovering his throne was a motive with James scarcely\r\nless powerful than that of taking precaution for his personal safety.\r\nThis intention appears from the unsuccessful campaign in Ireland, which\r\nhe had selected as a rallying point. That monarch’s real offence was his\r\nviolation of the laws of England. Many of his predecessors, as well as\r\nsome of his successors, were as unreasonable and as obstinate as he. The\r\ncharge of abdication was scarcely a decent pretext for declaring the\r\nthrone vacant, and Mr. Sumner appears to have forgotten for the moment\r\nthat the Federal Government is one of limited while Parliament is\r\nclothed with absolute powers. In reality James was coerced by the Prince\r\nof Orange into “withdrawing” from the Kingdom. It is not intended here\r\nto call in question the accepted vindication of the Revolution of 1688,\r\nbut merely to show that the Massachusetts statesman was at times not\r\nabove supporting an argument by a legal or an historical fiction.\r\n\r\nThe same resolution continues: “The treason which it [the attempt by\r\nforce to terminate the supremacy of the Constitution] involves still\r\nfurther works an instant _forfeiture_ of all those functions and powers\r\nessential to the continued existence of the State as a body politic.”\r\n\r\nOn the idea of State forfeiture his reasoning is entitled to more\r\nrespect. He argues: “But again it is sometimes said that the States, by\r\ntheir flagrant treason, have _forfeited_ their rights as States, so as\r\nto be civilly dead. It is a patent and indisputable fact, that this\r\ngigantic treason was inaugurated with all the forms of law known to the\r\nState; that it was carried forward not only by individuals, but also by\r\nStates, so far as States can perpetrate treason; that the States\r\npretended to withdraw bodily in their corporate capacities;—that the\r\nRebellion, as it showed itself, was _by_ States as well as _in_ States;\r\nthat it was by the governments of States as well as by the people of\r\nStates; and that, to the common observer, the crime was consummated by\r\nthe several corporations as well as by the individuals of whom they were\r\ncomposed. From this fact, obvious to all, it is argued that, since,\r\naccording to Blackstone, ‘a traitor hath abandoned his connection with\r\nsociety, and hath no longer any right to the advantages which before\r\nbelonged to him purely as a member of the community,’ by the same\r\nprinciple the traitor State is no longer to be regarded as a member of\r\nthe Union. But it is not necessary, on the present occasion, to insist\r\non the application of any such principle to States.”\r\n\r\nDiscarding as not essential to his defence the theories of State\r\nforfeiture, State abdication, or even State suicide, the article adds:\r\n“It is enough, that, for the time being, and _in the absence of a loyal\r\ngovernment_, they can take no part and perform no function in the Union,\r\n_so that they cannot be recognized by the National Government_. The\r\nreason is plain. There are in these States no local functionaries bound\r\nby constitutional oaths, so that, in fact, there are no constitutional\r\nfunctionaries; and since the State government is necessarily composed of\r\nsuch functionaries, there can be no State government. Thus, for\r\ninstance, in South Carolina, Pickens and his associates may call\r\nthemselves the governor and legislature; and in Virginia, Letcher and\r\nhis associates may call themselves governor and legislature; but we\r\ncannot recognize them as such. Therefore to all pretensions in behalf of\r\nState governments in the Rebel States I oppose the simple FACT, that for\r\nthe time being no such governments exist. The broad spaces once occupied\r\nby those governments are now abandoned and vacated.”\r\n\r\nDiscussing the question of transition to rightful government he says:\r\n“And here the question occurs, How shall this rightful jurisdiction be\r\nestablished in the vacated States? Some there are, so impassioned for\r\nState rights, and so anxious for forms even at the expense of substance,\r\nthat they insist upon the instant restoration of the old State\r\ngovernments in all their parts, through the agency of loyal citizens,\r\nwho meanwhile must be protected in this work of restoration. But\r\nassuming that all this is practicable, as it clearly is not, it\r\nattributes to the loyal citizens of a Rebel State, however few in\r\nnumbers,—it may be an insignificant minority,—a power clearly\r\ninconsistent with the received principle of popular government, that the\r\nmajority must rule, ... but the argument for State Rights assumes that\r\nall these rights may be lodged in voters as few in number as ever\r\ncontrolled a rotten borough of England.\r\n\r\n“Pray admitting that a minority may organize the new government, how\r\nshall it be done? and by whom shall it be set in motion?... It is not\r\neasy to see how the new government can be set in motion without a resort\r\nto some revolutionary proceeding, instituted either by the citizens or\r\nby the military power,—unless Congress, in the exercise of its plenary\r\npowers, should undertake to organize the new jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n“But every revolutionary proceeding is to be avoided. It will be within\r\nthe recollection of all familiar with our history, that our fathers,\r\nwhile regulating the separation of the Colonies from the parent country,\r\nwere careful that all should be done according to the forms of law, so\r\nthat the thread of _legality_ should continue unbroken. To this end the\r\nContinental Congress interfered by a supervising direction. But the Tory\r\nargument in that day denied the power of Congress as earnestly as it\r\ndenies this power now.”...\r\n\r\n“But, happily,” he says, “we are not constrained to any such\r\nrevolutionary proceeding. The new governments can all be organized by\r\nCongress, which is the natural guardian of people without any immediate\r\ngovernment, and within the jurisdiction of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. Indeed, with the State governments already _vacated_ by\r\nrebellion, the Constitution becomes, for the time, the supreme and only\r\nlaw, binding alike on President and Congress, so that neither can\r\nestablish any law or institution incompatible with it. And the whole\r\nRebel region, deprived of all local government, lapses under the\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of Congress, precisely as any other territory;\r\nor, in other words, the lifting of the local governments leaves the\r\nwhole vast region without any other government than Congress, unless the\r\nPresident should undertake to govern it by military power.”...\r\n\r\nThis part of the essay concludes with a declaration that its author had\r\nno pride of opinion, but would cheerfully abandon his views when\r\nconvinced of their error. He next proceeds to an examination of the\r\nsources of Congressional power. These, he asserts, are derived from the\r\nnecessity of the case, for Congress must have jurisdiction over every\r\nportion of the United States _where there is no other government_; and\r\nfrom the _Rights of War_, which he deemed not less abundant for Congress\r\nthan for the President. “It is Congress,” he contended, “that conquers;\r\nand the same authority that conquers must govern.” A third source of\r\nauthority, common alike to Congress and the President, was the\r\nconstitutional provision imposing on the United States the duty of\r\nguarantying republican forms of government. These ample powers were\r\nconfirmed by an additional grant in the clause concerning the admission\r\nof new States “into this Union.” The latter left it with Congress to\r\nprescribe the time and manner of the return of the rebel States,\r\nassuming that they were no longer _de facto_ States of the Union.\r\n\r\nAmong the “unanswerable reasons for Congressional governments” the\r\narticle says: “Slavery is so odious that it can exist only by virtue of\r\npositive law, plain and unequivocal; but no such words can be found in\r\nthe Constitution. Therefore Slavery is impossible within the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the National Government.... I am glad to believe that it\r\nis implied, if not expressed, in the Chicago Platform; ... but if the\r\nrebel territory falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the National\r\nGovernment, then Slavery will be impossible there.... The moment that\r\nthe States fell, Slavery fell also; so that, even without any\r\nProclamation of the President, Slavery had ceased to have a legal and\r\nconstitutional existence in every rebel State.”[291]\r\n\r\n“Let it be established in advance,” declared Mr. Sumner, “as an\r\ninseparable incident to every Act of Secession, that it is not only\r\nimpotent against the Constitution of the United States, but that, on its\r\noccurrence, both soil and inhabitants will lapse beneath the\r\njurisdiction of Congress, and no State will ever again pretend to\r\nsecede.”\r\n\r\nThe argument of which an epitome has been given was regarded by the\r\nPostmaster-General, Montgomery Blair, as formidable enough to merit\r\nattention, and he accordingly replied in a speech at Rockville,\r\nMaryland, in which Sumner, for arraying himself directly against the\r\nPresident on a question of fundamental policy in the conduct of the war,\r\nwas mentioned with sharp censure. This brought upon the Cabinet member,\r\nand upon Mr. Lincoln over his shoulders, much vehement criticism. It was\r\nin relation to this address that the President said:\r\n\r\n  The controversy between the two sets of men represented by Blair and\r\n  by Sumner is one of mere form and little else. I do not think Mr.\r\n  Blair would agree that the States in rebellion are to be permitted\r\n  to come at once into the political family and renew their\r\n  performances, which have already so bedeviled us, and I do not think\r\n  Mr. Sumner would insist that when the loyal people of a State obtain\r\n  supremacy in their councils and are ready to assume the direction of\r\n  their own affairs they should be excluded. I do not understand Mr.\r\n  Blair to admit that Jefferson Davis may take his seat in Congress\r\n  again as a representative of his people. I do not understand Mr.\r\n  Sumner to assert that John Minor Botts may not. So far as I\r\n  understand Mr. Sumner, he seems in favor of Congress taking from the\r\n  Executive the power it at present exercises over insurrectionary\r\n  districts and assuming it to itself; but when the vital question\r\n  arises as to the right and privilege of the people of these States\r\n  to govern themselves, I apprehend there will be little difference\r\n  among loyal men. The question at once is presented, In whom is this\r\n  power vested? and the practical matter for discussion is how to keep\r\n  the rebellious population from overwhelming and outvoting the loyal\r\n  minority.[292]\r\n\r\nConcisely expressed, the theory of State suicide based reconstruction\r\nupon the right of Congress to legislate for Federal territories and to\r\nadmit new States into this Union. In one view it rested on a provision\r\nin the Constitution which makes it obligatory on the States to have\r\nrepublican governments. This side of the doctrine shaded into the\r\nconservative view, according to which it is the duty of the States to be\r\nrepresented in Congress; but Sumner, as will subsequently appear,\r\nmaintained that the Confederate States should not be counted when\r\nnumbers were to be estimated in the adoption of constitutional\r\namendments; also that Congress had power to prescribe the qualifications\r\nof voters for conventions in those States. This view regarded the war as\r\na conflict of ideas; it assumed to find authority in the individual\r\nconscience discerning the will of God, was inclined to disallow\r\nobjective standards, and to consider all law as matter of subjective\r\ndetermination. From a careful perusal of his speeches Mr. Sumner appears\r\nto have insisted that a republican form of government could be such a\r\none only as conformed to his subjective ideas. Except his own State,\r\nwhose constitution of 1780 was held to have abolished slavery in that\r\nCommonwealth, no one of the States in 1789 possessed, according to his\r\nnotions, a republican form of government. His touchstone of\r\nrepublicanism was the Declaration of Independence. In short, the\r\nrequirements of the Constitution appear to have been found, not in the\r\nwritten instrument, but in his individual conceptions of political\r\njustice, equality and liberty whereby he constituted himself a new\r\nsource of law. In the matter of a subjective standard of natural justice\r\nand the like, the “radicals” generally agreed with Sumner.[293]\r\n\r\nThe position that the object of the war from the beginning, on the part\r\nof the Federal authorities, was to fulfill the guaranty of a republican\r\nform of government is untenable. It may well be doubted whether the\r\ncommunity so guaranteed can be restricted to any particular government;\r\nindeed, it is difficult to see how a government not voluntarily\r\ninstituted by the people of a State can be called republican. By having\r\na government imposed by Congress they would resemble the people of a\r\nTerritory, and the result would be an inequality among the States\r\ncomposing the Union.\r\n\r\nThough it has been commended as well written, there is some crude\r\nthinking and even cruder phraseology in the preamble as well as in the\r\nresolutions themselves. Mr. Sumner appears to have been much influenced\r\nby feudal and other historical analogies. It will be seen later how he\r\nrecoiled somewhat from accepting fully the consequences of his own\r\nprinciples.[294] The famous theory of State suicide, as tersely stated\r\nby an able advocate of the doctrine, was in effect that “a Territory by\r\ncoming into the Union becomes a State; a State by going out of the Union\r\nbecomes a Territory.”[295]\r\n\r\nTo offset the resolutions of Sumner, Hon. Garrett Davis, of Kentucky,\r\nintroduced two days later a series of eight propositions. Of these the\r\nfirst asserts that the rights, privileges and liberties which the\r\nConstitution assures to the people of the United States “are fixed,\r\npermanent, and immutable through all the phases of peace and war, until\r\nchanged by the power and in the mode prescribed by the Constitution\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nIn the light of subsequent events, however, the last is the most\r\ninteresting of the series. This declares “That the United States\r\nGovernment should march their armies into all the insurgent States, and\r\npromptly put down the military power which they have arrayed against it,\r\nand give protection and security to the loyal men thereof, to enable\r\nthem to reconstruct their legitimate State governments, and bring them\r\nand the people back to the Union and to obedience and duty under the\r\nConstitution and the laws of the United States, bearing the sword in one\r\nhand and the olive branch in the other, and whilst inflicting on the\r\nguilty leaders condign and exemplary punishment, granting amnesty and\r\noblivion to the comparatively innocent masses; and if the people of any\r\nState cannot, or will not reconstruct their State government and return\r\nto loyalty and duty, Congress should provide a government for such State\r\nas a Territory of the United States, securing to the people thereof\r\ntheir appropriate constitutional rights.”[296]\r\n\r\nThese propositions, like the resolutions of Sumner, were never taken up\r\nfor discussion, and they are referred to as containing a clear\r\nexpression, by a Southern Democrat,[297] of extra-constitutional powers\r\nin treating incorrigible States as Territories.\r\n\r\nSumner was not alone in maintaining novel opinions concerning the\r\nrelation of the seceded States to the Federal Government. A theory\r\ndestined to exert even greater influence in shaping the plan of\r\nreconstruction finally adopted was announced at the very commencement of\r\nhostilities by Thaddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania, then one of the\r\nforemost members of the Republican party and a few years later its\r\nacknowledged leader in the House. Unlike the Massachusetts Senator, Mr.\r\nStevens never formulated his views of State status; but as he urged them\r\non almost every conceivable occasion the essential principles of his\r\nsystem may be easily collected from his numerous speeches in Congress.\r\nSubjects of legislation only remotely related to his favorite topic\r\nappear to have been regarded by him as important chiefly because of the\r\nopportunity afforded to express his sentiments on the measures necessary\r\nto reorganization. These opinions, he declared, had been deliberately\r\nformed; we know that to the end they were persistently urged and ably\r\ndefended. Because of their radical nature and the frequency with which\r\nthey were reiterated Stevens was by many regarded as a sort of fanatic;\r\nthis estimate was confirmed, no doubt, by his bodily deformity as well\r\nas by an apparent want of amiability and a certain bluntness of\r\nexpression. Even by keen observers he was at first considered a man of\r\nmediocre ability. But, though not to be compared with the giant race of\r\nan earlier generation, he was a statesman far above the common-place.\r\nAmong the multitude of plans and theories offered in Congress his system\r\nwas distinguished for the harmony of its parts; and enemies who hated,\r\nno less than followers who feared, him were forced to admit the\r\nconsistency of his principles.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of Stevens in the field of constructive statesmanship\r\ncannot now be discussed; for their consideration belongs properly to an\r\nexamination of the first reconstruction act, which was no more than a\r\nmodification of his theory. Long before Sumner’s plan had agitated timid\r\nconservatives the Pennsylvanian leader by his extreme opinions had\r\nastonished Congress. When the question of discharging from labor or\r\nservice those slaves employed in hostility to the United States came\r\nbefore the House at the special session beginning July 4, 1861, Stevens\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Speaker, I thought the time had come when the laws of war were\r\n  to govern our action; when constitutions, if they stood in the way\r\n  of the laws of war in dealing with the enemy, had no right to\r\n  intervene. Who pleads the Constitution against our proposed action?\r\n  Who says the Constitution must come in, in bar of our action? It is\r\n  the advocates of rebels, of rebels who have sought to overthrow the\r\n  Constitution and trample it in the dust—who repudiate the\r\n  Constitution. Sir, these rebels, who have disregarded and set at\r\n  defiance that instrument, are, by every rule of municipal and\r\n  international law, estopped from pleading it against our action.\r\n  Who, then, is it that comes to us and says, “You cannot do this\r\n  thing, because your Constitution does not permit it?” The\r\n  Constitution! Our Constitution, which you repudiate and trample\r\n  under foot, forbids it! Sir, it is an absurdity. There must be a\r\n  party in court to plead it, and that party, to be entitled to plead\r\n  it in court, must first acknowledge its supremacy, or he has no\r\n  business to be in court at all. I repeat, then, that those who bring\r\n  in this plea here, in bar of our action, are the advocates of\r\n  rebels. They are nothing else, whatever they intend. I mean it, of\r\n  course, in a legal sense. I mean they are acting in the capacity of\r\n  counsellors-at-law for the rebels; they are speaking for them, and\r\n  not for us—who are the plaintiffs in this transaction. I deny that\r\n  they have any right to plead at all. I deny that they have any\r\n  standing in court. I deny that they have any right to invoke this\r\n  Constitution, which they deny has authority over them, which they\r\n  set at defiance and trample under foot. I deny that they can be\r\n  permitted to come here and tell us we must be loyal to the\r\n  Constitution.[298]\r\n\r\nThe expectation almost universally cherished at this time was that when\r\nthe insurrection should have been suppressed, as it was confidently\r\nbelieved it speedily would be, the erring States, without the\r\ninterposition of Federal authority, would resume their normal relations\r\nto the General Government. With this state of public opinion in mind it\r\nwill readily be perceived how great an interval separated Mr. Stevens\r\nfrom both parties in Congress. The opening sentence of the remarks\r\nquoted contains the essential idea of his theory of the change resulting\r\nfrom rebellion. Armed secession had unlocked the war powers, and the\r\nConstitution, where it conflicted with these powers, had ceased to be a\r\nrestraint upon government. The military had risen superior to the civil\r\nauthority. The principle was boldly and emphatically announced that\r\nthose who repudiated and defied the supreme law could not at the same\r\ntime plead its provisions.\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1863, the appropriation bill being under consideration, an\r\namendment was offered to add to the clause “for compensation of\r\nthirty-three commissioners, at $3,000 each, and eleven clerks, at $1,200\r\neach, $112,200,” the following:\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, A sufficient sum shall be collected in the\r\n  insurrectionary States to pay said salaries: _And provided further_,\r\n  That no greater sum shall at any time be paid to said commissioners,\r\n  or to any of them, than shall have been collected from the taxes in\r\n  the insurrectionary States, and paid into the Treasury of the United\r\n  States.[299]\r\n\r\nThe discussion which ensued brought out an expression of views relative\r\nto the position of the seceded States under the Federal Government.\r\nStevens in the course of his remarks said: “I did say, sir, that I find\r\nno warrant in the Constitution for the admission, under the\r\nConstitution, of West Virginia. I do not know whether the gentleman from\r\nKentucky voted for that bill or not.” Mr. Dunlap, the member referred\r\nto, stated that he had voted against the bill, because he deemed it\r\nunconstitutional. After this explanation the Pennsylvania leader\r\nproceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n  Then the gentleman voted against it upon the same opinion I\r\n  expressed, that it was unconstitutional. But I went further and\r\n  voted for it because I did not believe that the Constitution\r\n  embraced a State now in arms against the Government of this Union\r\n  and I hold that doctrine now. It was not said upon the spur of the\r\n  occasion. It is a deliberate opinion, formed upon a careful\r\n  examination of the law of the United States and the laws of nations.\r\n\r\n  Though it may be out of place just now, I will give one or two\r\n  reasons for my opinion. The establishment of our blockade admitted\r\n  the Southern States, the Confederates, to be a belligerent power.\r\n  Foreign nations have all admitted them as a belligerent power.\r\n  Whenever that came to be admitted by us and by foreign nations, it\r\n  placed the rebellious States precisely in the condition of an alien\r\n  enemy with regard to duties and obligations. Now, I think there is\r\n  nothing more plainly written in the law of nations than that\r\n  whenever a war, which is admitted to be a national war, springs up\r\n  between nation and nation, ally and ally, confederate and\r\n  confederate, every obligation which previously existed between them,\r\n  whether treaty, compact, contract, or anything else, is wholly\r\n  abrogated, and from that moment the belligerents act toward each\r\n  other, not according to any municipal obligations, not according to\r\n  any compacts or treaties, but simply according to the laws of war.\r\n  And I hold and maintain that with regard to all the Southern States\r\n  in rebellion. I do not speak of Kentucky, but of those States which\r\n  have gone out under an act of legislation or convention—the\r\n  Constitution has no binding influence and no application.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question by Representative Dunlap he stated further that\r\nthe seceded States, in his opinion, were not members of the Union. “The\r\nordinances of secession,” he added, “backed by the armed power which\r\nmade them a belligerent nation, did take them, so far as present\r\noperations are concerned, from under the laws of the nation.” When asked\r\nhow, as Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, he proposed to pass\r\nan appropriation to pay officers to collect revenue in States which did\r\nnot belong to the Union, he said:\r\n\r\n  I propose to levy that tax, and collect it as a war measure. I would\r\n  levy a tax wherever I can upon these conquered provinces, just as\r\n  all nations levy them upon provinces and nations they conquer. If my\r\n  views and principles are right, I would not only collect that tax,\r\n  but I would, as a necessary war measure, take every particle of\r\n  property, real and personal, life estate and reversion, of every\r\n  disloyal man, and sell it for the benefit of the nation in carrying\r\n  on this war. We have such power and we are to treat them simply as\r\n  provinces to be conquered, and as a nation fighting in hostility to\r\n  us until we do conquer them. To me it is a great absurdity to say\r\n  that men, by millions, in arms, shall claim the protection of the\r\n  provisions of the Constitution and laws made for loyal men, while\r\n  they do not obey one of those laws, but repudiate their binding\r\n  effect. There never was a principle more clear than that every\r\n  obligation, whether in a national or civil point of view, in order\r\n  to be binding, must be reciprocal; and that the moment the duty\r\n  ceases upon the one part, the obligation ceases upon the other; and\r\n  that, in my judgment, is precisely the condition of the rebel States\r\n  now.\r\n\r\nThe secession ordinance of South Carolina he characterized in response\r\nto an inquiry as an act of treason and rebellion, and when asked whether\r\nthe backing up of these ordinances by armed force imparted to them any\r\nvalidity, he replied: “I hold that so long as they remain in force\r\nagainst us as a belligerent power, and until they are conquered, it is\r\nin fact an existing operation. I will not say anything about its\r\nlegality. [Laughter.] I hold that it is an existing _fact_, and that so\r\nfar from enforcing any laws, you have not the power.”\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Yeaman, who asked whether those people were then citizens of the\r\nUnited States, or whether they formed an independent nation, and if the\r\nlatter whence was derived the right or the authority to wage war against\r\nthem, and to tax them for the support of that war, Stevens answered: “I\r\nhold that the Constitution, in the first place, so far operated that\r\nwhen they went into secession and armed rebellion they committed\r\ntreason; and that when they so combined themselves as to make themselves\r\nadmitted as belligerents—not merely as men in insurrection, but as\r\nbelligerents—they did acquire the right to be treated as prisoners of\r\nwar, and all the other rights which pertain to belligerents under the\r\nlaws of nations.”\r\n\r\nSome members held in utter abhorrence the principles of the Pennsylvania\r\nleader; others were astonished at their boldness. It was in the course\r\nof this discussion, participated in by many Representatives, that\r\nStevens defined his existing as well as his past relations to his party,\r\nand referred, not without a touch of pride, to the fact that hitherto he\r\nhad pointed out the way for the Republican majority—in short, that he\r\nhad been the political prophet of his party. He declared:\r\n\r\n  I know perfectly well, as I said before, I do not speak the\r\n  sentiments of this side of the House as a party. I know more than\r\n  that: that for the last fifteen years I have always been a step\r\n  ahead of the party I have acted with in these matters; but I have\r\n  never been so far ahead with the exception of the principles I now\r\n  enunciate, but that the members of the party have overtaken me and\r\n  gone ahead; and they, together with the gentleman from New York,\r\n  [Mr. Olin] will again overtake me and go with me, before this\r\n  infamous and bloody rebellion is ended. They will find that they\r\n  cannot execute the Constitution in the seceding States; that it is a\r\n  total nullity there; and that this war must be carried on upon\r\n  principles wholly independent of it. They will come to the\r\n  conclusion that the adoption of the measures I advocated at the\r\n  outset of the war, the arming of the negroes, the slaves of the\r\n  rebels, is the only way left on earth in which these rebels can be\r\n  exterminated. They will find that they must treat those States now\r\n  outside of the Union as conquered provinces and settle them with new\r\n  men, and drive the present rebels as exiles from this country; for I\r\n  tell you they have the pluck and endurance for which I gave them\r\n  credit a year and a half ago in a speech which I made, but which was\r\n  not relished on this side of the House, nor by the people in the\r\n  free States. They have such determination, energy, and endurance,\r\n  that nothing but actual extermination or exile or starvation will\r\n  ever induce them to surrender to this Government. I do not ask\r\n  gentlemen to indorse my views, nor do I speak for anybody but\r\n  myself; but in order that I may have some credit for sagacity, I ask\r\n  that gentlemen will write this down in their memories. It will not\r\n  be two years before they will call it up, or before they will adopt\r\n  my views, or adopt the other alternative of a disgraceful submission\r\n  by this side of the country.[300]\r\n\r\nFor himself, for the Administration and for the Republican party even so\r\nradical an anti-slavery man as Owen Lovejoy made haste to repudiate\r\nthese extreme opinions.\r\n\r\nIn debate, January 22, 1864, Stevens enunciated still more clearly the\r\nfundamental principles of his system. “I mean to say,” he declared on\r\nthat occasion, “that if a State, as a State, makes war upon the\r\nGovernment and becomes a belligerent power, we treat it as a foreign\r\nnation, and when we conquer it we treat it just as we do any other\r\nforeign nation.” “There can be no neutrals,” he added, “in a hostile\r\nState.” If loyal people domiciled in the South desired to avoid\r\npunishment or the hardships of public enemies, they should change their\r\nplace of residence.\r\n\r\nRelative to discerning the State in the Union minority he observed: “If\r\nten men fit to save Sodom can elect a Governor and other State officers\r\nfor and against the eleven hundred thousand Sodomites in Virginia, then\r\nthe democratic doctrine that the majority shall rule is discarded and\r\ndangerously ignored. When the doctrine that the _quality_ and not the\r\n_number_ of voters is to decide the right to govern, then we are no\r\nlonger a republic, but the worst form of despotism.” It was a mere\r\nmockery, he affirmed, to say that a tithe of the residents, because they\r\nwere holier or more loyal than others, could change the form and\r\nadminister the government of an organized State. The people who took a\r\nState out of the Union were subject to the laws of the commonwealth,\r\nand, so far as the General Government is concerned, subject to the laws\r\nof war and of nations, both while the war continued and when it\r\nended.[301]\r\n\r\nNorthern Democrats, from the beginning to the end of reconstruction,\r\nwere consistent advocates of a doctrine which involved no contradictions\r\nlike the system of Sumner and no element of vindictiveness like the\r\n“conquered province” theory of Stevens. Ordinances of secession they\r\nheld to be null and void; these measures in no way impaired the vitality\r\nor contracted the scope of the Constitution because the power by which\r\nthey were temporarily maintained, however near to attaining its object,\r\nhad not been crowned with success. The result of the conflict could\r\nalone determine whether the bond of union between the seceding and the\r\nloyal States had been severed. Armed resistance to the supreme law was\r\ntreason in those so engaged, even though such resistance was decreed by\r\nStates. _Ante bellum_ relations would continue unimpaired if the General\r\nGovernment succeeded in suppressing the rebellion. This doctrine, once a\r\nState in the Union always a State, was, so far, in harmony with the\r\npolicy adopted by the Administration at the commencement of hostilities.\r\n\r\nWith all the following propositions, however, the policy of the\r\nGovernment was not in entire accord, nor, indeed, was it in exact\r\nconformity with the principles above ascribed to the President. The\r\npeople of a State, the Democratic leaders asserted, are the State, in\r\nthe widest sense of that term, and they make its fundamental law; to be\r\ntheir constitution it must be their unrestrained and voluntary act, not\r\na result of coercion or intimidation. When they have freely acted, then\r\nthe only essential conditions of a State constitution, in its Federal\r\nrelations, are that it should be republican in form and not conflict\r\nwith the Constitution of the United States. South Carolina, for example,\r\nwas made a member of the Union by the Constitution and the consent of\r\nher people; except successful revolution no other power could unmake\r\nher. That revolution being unsuccessful she was still in the Union. The\r\nidea that a State was partly out of and partly in the Union, Democratic\r\ndoctrine regarded as an absurdity. State officers, indeed, could commit\r\nsuicide; a majority of its people could commit suicide; but the State\r\ndid not, therefore, cease to exist, for the idea of a State involved the\r\nfourfold notion of a defined territory, people occupying it, functions\r\nconstituting a system of government and officers to administer it.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Joseph K. Edgerton, of Indiana, in an able speech\r\ndelivered February 20, 1865, said that he accepted the principle of\r\nPresident Lincoln’s inaugural and only regretted that after so clear and\r\nsound a statement of constitutional law and good intentions the\r\nPresident had subsequently come to the same conclusion as Mr. Stevens.\r\nThe theory then announced was the only one consistent with the true\r\nconstitutional idea that the Federal Union is a perpetual union of\r\nStates, and that each State, as an individual member of the Union, has\r\nin itself the same element of perpetuity that belongs to the aggregate\r\nRepublic formed by the Federal union of States. The Union can be held to\r\nbe perpetual only on the principle that the States composing it are\r\nperpetual corporations or bodies politic, and indestructible by any act\r\nof the aggregate body or by their own act. The States united cannot\r\ndestroy a single commonwealth; power to do that is power to consolidate\r\nthe States into one. A single member cannot destroy the Union; power to\r\ndo that is power to secede, and neither consolidation nor secession is a\r\nprinciple of the Union. Here we have in amplified form the celebrated\r\ndeclaration of Chief Justice Chase, that the Constitution in all its\r\nprovisions contemplates “an indestructible union of indestructible\r\nStates.”[302] For a different though a very able presentation of\r\nDemocratic theory the reader is referred to the address of Mr. Pendleton\r\non the bill to guarantee republican forms of government to the\r\nrebellious States.[303]\r\n\r\nThough this theory of a perpetual Union was the one almost universally\r\nheld at the beginning of the war, it came during the progress of the\r\nconflict to be little regarded by the dominant party in Congress; by\r\nRepublican leaders it was soon cast aside with indignation or contempt;\r\nit remained unaltered when their views of State status were adapted to\r\nchanged conditions, and the Democratic organization, so far at least as\r\nreconstruction was concerned, settled down into little more than a party\r\nof protest.\r\n\r\nThe silence in which Sumner’s propositions were received may be regarded\r\nas a negative testimony to the conservative sentiments of Senators even\r\nafter war had existed for nearly a year; the House, however, just twelve\r\nmonths before the Massachusetts Senator offered his plan, February 11,\r\n1861, made a positive declaration of its opinion relative to the\r\nlimitations of Federal authority by passing unanimously the following\r\nresolution: “That neither Congress, nor the people or the governments of\r\nthe non-slaveholding States, have the right to legislate upon or\r\ninterfere with slavery in any of the slaveholding States in the\r\nUnion.”[304] This deliberate expression establishes beyond question the\r\nfact that the Constitution, as then understood, gave no authority to the\r\nFederal Government to interfere with, control or regulate relations\r\nbetween master and slave in any State which recognized the right of\r\nproperty in man. On this subject the people were practically unanimous,\r\ntheir Representatives entirely so. Even three months of war, with all\r\nthe antagonisms and all the bitterness excited, failed to shake this\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1861, the day after the disaster at Bull Run, Representative\r\nCrittenden, of Kentucky, introduced the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the\r\n  country by the disunionists of the Southern States, now in arms\r\n  against the constitutional Government, and in arms around the\r\n  capital; that in this national emergency, Congress, banishing all\r\n  feelings of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty\r\n  to the whole country; that this war is not waged on their part in\r\n  any spirit of oppression, or for any purpose of conquest or\r\n  subjugation, or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the\r\n  rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend\r\n  and maintain the _supremacy_ of the Constitution, and to preserve\r\n  the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several\r\n  States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are\r\n  accomplished the war ought to cease.\r\n\r\nOnly two votes were recorded against it.[305] Four days later Andrew\r\nJohnson offered in the upper House a resolution in nearly the same\r\nlanguage, and it was opposed by only five Senators. There is little\r\ndoubt that this practical unanimity in Congress reflected the sentiment\r\nof almost the entire North. This conspicuous landmark, so frequently\r\nreferred to before the reunion was completed, will be useful to show how\r\nfar the warring factions drifted during the progress of the conflict.\r\n\r\nSenator Trumbull, of Illinois, who disliked certain expressions in the\r\nform in which it was proposed, said, relative to the object of the war\r\nas declared by the resolution:\r\n\r\n  I trust this war is prosecuted for the purpose of subjugating all\r\n  rebels and traitors who are in arms against the Government. What do\r\n  you mean by “subjugation”? I know that persons in the Southern\r\n  States have sought to make this a controversy between States and the\r\n  Federal Government, and have talked about coercing States and\r\n  subjugating States; but, sir, it has never been proposed, so far as\r\n  I know, on the part of the Union people of the United States, to\r\n  subjugate States or coerce States. It is proposed, however, to\r\n  subjugate citizens who are standing out in defiance of the laws of\r\n  the Union, and to coerce them into obedience to the laws of the\r\n  Union. I dislike that word in this connection. In its broadest sense\r\n  I am opposed to it. If it means the war is not for the purpose of\r\n  the subjugation of traitors and rebels into obedience to the laws,\r\n  then I am opposed to it. I trust the war is prosecuted for that very\r\n  purpose. I move to strike out the words “and in arms around the\r\n  capital,” and also the words “or subjugation.”[306]\r\n\r\nMr. Harris, of New York, said: “If slavery shall be abolished, shall be\r\noverthrown as a consequence of this war, I shall not shed a tear over\r\nthat result; but, sir, it is not the purpose of the Government to\r\nprosecute this war for the purpose of overthrowing slavery. If it comes\r\nas a consequence, let it come; but it is not an end of the war.”[307]\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding chapter will be traced with some degree of fullness\r\nthe sentiments on reconstruction, in July, 1864, not only of the\r\nmajority but of every important element composing Congress. The position\r\nthen attained by the average Republican member, it must be repeated, was\r\nnot reached at a single bound. Its progress has been described in the\r\npreceding pages. The vote on the Crittenden resolution marks the\r\nstarting point. There was then, though war had existed for three months,\r\nno diversity of opinion worthy of notice. The successive advances from\r\nthe declaration, February 11, 1861, that neither Congress nor the\r\ngovernments of the free States had a constitutional right to interfere\r\nwith slavery in any slaveholding State of the Union to the passage by\r\nboth Houses, July 2, 1864, of the Wade-Davis bill, which proposed by\r\nFederal law to regulate the franchise in the rebellious States, to\r\nappoint provisional governors (empowered to dissolve State conventions),\r\nand to prescribe provisions for their local constitutions, form one of\r\nthe most instructive commentaries on the importance of necessity as a\r\nprinciple of constitutional interpretation.\r\n\r\nA resolution introduced December 4, 1861, by Mr. Holman, of Indiana, for\r\nthe purpose of getting the House to re-affirm the Crittenden\r\npropositions of July 22 preceding, was tabled by a vote of 71 to\r\n65.[308]\r\n\r\nA discussion of the various theories of reconstruction might seem to\r\nrequire in this place, by way of anticipation, at least a summary of the\r\nCongressional plan; but as this was the mode of reorganization which was\r\nfinally imposed on the South it is preferred to present its development\r\nchronologically and to consider it apart. Several of the remaining\r\nchapters will be devoted to an account of its successive modifications\r\nuntil the subject was taken, in December, 1865, altogether out of\r\nExecutive hands.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol.

The Proclamation\r\nof December 8, 1863, followed promptly and brought the subject of\r\nreconstruction before the Thirty-eighth Congress at its first session.\r\nThe preceding pages have alluded to the universal favor with which that\r\nannouncement was received. Though opposition to Executive measures was\r\nhushed for the time, it appears only to have gathered strength in this\r\nbrief interval of silence. One short week introduced into the House of\r\nRepresentatives a resolution the subsequent progress of which brought\r\nthe dominant party in Congress to the support of a measure hostile to\r\nthat submitted by the President. Its interesting history may be\r\ncollected from the pages of the _Congressional Globe_.\r\n\r\nOn December 15, from the Committee of Ways and Means, Thaddeus Stevens\r\nreported among other resolutions one to refer so much of the President’s\r\nmessage as was contained in the Proclamation, and as related to the\r\ncondition and treatment of rebellious States, to a special committee of\r\nnine to be appointed by the Speaker. Henry Winter Davis inquired whether\r\nMr. Stevens would accept for that resolution an amendment pointing more\r\ndirectly to the purpose in view. This substitute read as follows:\r\n\r\n  That so much of the President’s message as relates to the duty of\r\n  the United States to guarantee a republican form of government to\r\n  the States in which the governments recognized by the United States\r\n  have been abrogated or overthrown, be referred to a select committee\r\n  of nine, to be named by the Speaker, which shall report the bills\r\n  necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing\r\n  guaranty.[310]\r\n\r\nStevens offering no objection, Representative Davis remarked that the\r\nlanguage of the resolution was general, and, he believed, would cover\r\nthe whole war; the committee, he supposed, intended to point to what, in\r\nthe very inaccurate phraseology of the day, was known as the question of\r\nreconstruction; but believing there had been no destruction, he\r\ncarefully avoided the use of that term.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States, continued Mr. Davis, was engaged in\r\ntwo operations: the suppression of armed resistance to the supreme\r\nauthority of the nation and a very delicate, and perhaps as high a\r\nduty—to see, when armed resistance should be overcome, that governments\r\nrepublican in form should be restored in all those States. His\r\nsubstitute directed the investigations of the committee to that one\r\npoint. It was not intended as a peremptory instruction to the committee\r\nto report any particular measure, but to take such action as their\r\nwisdom should recommend.\r\n\r\nDemocratic feeling on this subject appears in an inquiry by\r\nRepresentative Brooks, of New York, as to whether republican governments\r\nhad not been abrogated and overturned north as well as south of the\r\nPotomac since the revolution began.[311]\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Mr. Davis prevailed, and of the special committee\r\nappointed he was made chairman. On January 18, 1864, he asked unanimous\r\nconsent to report a bill to guarantee certain States a republican form\r\nof government. Objection having been made, he moved a suspension of the\r\nrules; but failing to receive the necessary two thirds vote his motion\r\nwas lost. On February 15 succeeding, when he brought the measure before\r\nthe House again and requested a postponement of its consideration for\r\ntwo weeks, it encountered Democratic opposition. The bill was then read\r\na first and second time, ordered to be printed, and returned to the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nOn March 22 the bill came before the House on the question of ordering\r\nit to be engrossed and read a third time. In its support Mr. Davis made\r\nan able address in which he analyzed the plan proposed by the Executive\r\nand emphasized its deficiencies. He said:\r\n\r\n  The bill which I am directed by the Committee on the Rebellious\r\n  States to report is one which provides for the restoration of civil\r\n  government in States whose governments have been overthrown. It\r\n  prescribes such conditions as will secure not merely civil\r\n  government to the people of the rebellious States, but will also\r\n  secure to the people of the United States permanent peace after the\r\n  suppression of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  The bill challenges the support of all who consider slavery the\r\n  cause of the rebellion, and that in it the embers of rebellion will\r\n  always smoulder; of those who think that freedom and permanent peace\r\n  are inseparable, and who are determined, so far as their\r\n  constitutional authority will allow them, to secure these fruits by\r\n  adequate legislation.\r\n\r\n  ... It is entitled to the support of all gentlemen upon this side of\r\n  the House, whatever their views may be of the nature of the\r\n  rebellion; and the relation in which it has placed the people and\r\n  States in rebellion toward the United States, not less of those who\r\n  think that the rebellion has placed the citizens of the rebel States\r\n  beyond the protection of the Constitution, and that Congress,\r\n  therefore, has supreme power over them as conquered enemies, than of\r\n  that other class who think that they have not ceased to be citizens\r\n  and States of the United States, though incapable of exercising\r\n  political privileges under the Constitution, but that Congress is\r\n  charged with a high political power by the Constitution to guarantee\r\n  republican governments in the States, and that this is the proper\r\n  time and the proper mode of exercising it. It is also entitled to\r\n  the favorable consideration of gentlemen upon the other side of the\r\n  House, who honestly and deliberately express their judgment that\r\n  slavery is dead. To them it puts the question whether it is not\r\n  advisable to bury it out of our sight, that its ghost may no longer\r\n  stalk abroad to frighten us from our propriety.\r\n\r\n  It does not address itself to that class of gentlemen upon the other\r\n  side of the House, if there be any, nor to that class of the people\r\n  of the country who look for political alliance to the men who head\r\n  the rebellion in the South....\r\n\r\n  It purports, sir, not to exercise a revolutionary authority, but to\r\n  be an execution of the Constitution of the United States, of the\r\n  fourth section of the fourth article of that Constitution, which not\r\n  merely confers the power upon Congress, but imposes upon Congress\r\n  the duty of guaranteeing to every State in this Union a republican\r\n  form of government. That clause vests in the Congress of the United\r\n  States a plenary, supreme, unlimited political jurisdiction,\r\n  paramount over courts, subject only to the judgment of the people of\r\n  the United States, embracing within its scope every legislative\r\n  measure necessary and proper to make it effectual; and what is\r\n  necessary and proper the Constitution refers, in the first place, to\r\n  our judgment, subject to no revision but that of the people. It\r\n  recognizes no other tribunal. It recognizes the judgment of no\r\n  court. It refers to no authority except the judgment and will of the\r\n  majority of Congress, and of the people on that judgment, if any\r\n  appeal from it.\r\n\r\n  [Secession he described as] the act of the people of the States,\r\n  carrying with it all the consequences of such an act. And therefore\r\n  it must be either a legal revolution which makes them independent,\r\n  and makes of the United States a foreign country, or it is a\r\n  usurpation against the authority of the United States, the erection\r\n  of governments which do not recognize the Constitution of the United\r\n  States, which the Constitution does not recognize, and, therefore,\r\n  not republican governments of the States in rebellion. The latter is\r\n  the view which all parties take of it. I do not understand that any\r\n  gentleman on the other side of the House says that any rebel\r\n  government which does not recognize the Constitution of the United\r\n  States, and which is not recognized by Congress, is a State\r\n  government within the meaning of the Constitution. Still less can it\r\n  be said that there is a State government, republican or\r\n  un-republican, in the State of Tennessee, where there is no\r\n  government of any kind, no civil authority, no organized form of\r\n  administration except that represented by the flag of the United\r\n  States, obeying the will, and under the orders of the military\r\n  officer in command. It is the language of the President of the\r\n  United States in every proclamation, of Congress in every law on the\r\n  statute-book, of both Houses in their forms of proceeding, and of\r\n  the Courts of the United States in their administration of the law.\r\n  It is the result of every principle of law, of every suggestion of\r\n  political philosophy, that there can be no republican government\r\n  within the limits of the United States that does not recognize, but\r\n  does repudiate, the Constitution, and which the President and the\r\n  Congress of the United States do not, on their part, recognize.\r\n  Those that are here represented are the only governments existing\r\n  within the limits of the United States. Those that are not here\r\n  represented are not governments of the States, republican under the\r\n  Constitution. And if they be not, then they are military\r\n  usurpations, inaugurated as the permanent governments of the States,\r\n  contrary to the supreme law of the land, arrayed in arms against the\r\n  Government of the United States; and it is the duty, the first and\r\n  highest duty, of the Government to suppress and expel them. Congress\r\n  must either expel, or recognize and support them. If it do not\r\n  guarantee them, it is bound to expel them; and they who are not\r\n  ready to suppress them are bound to recognize them.\r\n\r\n“In the famous Rhode Island cases,” he continued, the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States by the mouth of Chief Justice Taney, declared “that a\r\nmilitary government, established as the permanent government of a State,\r\nis not a republican government in the meaning of the Constitution, and\r\nthat it is the duty of Congress to suppress it. That duty Congress is\r\nnow executing by its armies. He [Justice Taney] further said in that\r\ncase that it is the exclusive prerogative of Congress—of Congress, and\r\nnot of the President—to determine what is and what is not the\r\nestablished government of the State; and, to come to that conclusion, it\r\nmust judge of what is and what is not a republican government, and its\r\njudgment is conclusive on the Supreme Court, which cannot judge of the\r\nfact for itself, but accepts the fact declared by the political\r\ndepartment of the Government.”\r\n\r\nMr. Davis resumed:\r\n\r\n  We are now engaged in suppressing a military usurpation of the\r\n  authority of the State government. When that shall have been\r\n  accomplished, there will be no form of State authority in existence\r\n  which Congress can recognize. Our success will be the overthrow of\r\n  all semblance of government in the rebel States. The Government of\r\n  the United States is then, in fact, the _only_ Government existing\r\n  in those States, and it is there charged to guarantee them\r\n  republican governments.\r\n\r\n  ... The duty of guaranteeing carries with it the right to pass all\r\n  laws necessary and proper to guaranty.... It places in the hands of\r\n  Congress the right to say what is and what is not, with all the\r\n  light of experience and all the lessons of the past, inconsistent,\r\n  in its judgment, with the permanent continuance of republican\r\n  government; and if, in its judgment, any form of policy is radically\r\n  and inherently inconsistent with the permanent and enduring peace of\r\n  the country, with the permanent supremacy of republican government,\r\n  and it have the manliness to say so, there is no power, judicial or\r\n  executive, in the United States, that can even question this\r\n  judgment but the =People=; and they can do it only by sending other\r\n  representatives here to undo our work. The very language of the\r\n  Constitution and the necessary logic of the case involve that\r\n  consequence. The denial of the right of secession means that all the\r\n  territory of the United States shall remain under the jurisdiction\r\n  of the Constitution. If there can be no State government which does\r\n  not recognize the Constitution, and which the authorities of the\r\n  United States do not recognize, then there are these alternatives,\r\n  and these only: the rebel States must be governed by Congress till\r\n  they submit and form a State government under the Constitution; or\r\n  Congress must recognize State governments which do not recognize\r\n  either Congress or the Constitution of the United States; or there\r\n  must be an entire absence of _all_ government in the rebel States;\r\n  and that is anarchy. To recognize a government which does not\r\n  recognize the Constitution is absurd, for a government is not a\r\n  constitution; and the recognition of a State government means the\r\n  acknowledgment of men as governors, and legislators, and judges,\r\n  actually invested with power to make laws, to judge of crimes, to\r\n  convict the citizens of other States, to demand the surrender of\r\n  fugitives from justice, to arm and command the militia, to require\r\n  the United States to repress all opposition to its authority, and to\r\n  protect it from invasion—against our own armies; whose Senators and\r\n  Representatives are _entitled_ to seats in Congress, and whose\r\n  electoral votes must be counted in the election of the President of\r\n  a Government which they disown and defy!! To accept the alternative\r\n  of anarchy as the constitutional condition of a State is to assert\r\n  the failure of the Constitution and the end of republican\r\n  government. Until, therefore, Congress recognize a State government,\r\n  organized under its auspices, there is no government in the rebel\r\n  States except the authority of Congress. In the absence of all State\r\n  government, the duty is imposed on Congress ... to administer civil\r\n  government until the people shall, under its guidance, submit to the\r\n  Constitution of the United States, and, under the laws which it\r\n  shall impose, and on the conditions Congress may require, reorganize\r\n  a republican government for themselves, and Congress shall recognize\r\n  that government.\r\n\r\n  ... Is it yet time to reorganize the State governments? or is there\r\n  not an intermediate period in which sound legislative wisdom\r\n  requires that the authority of Congress shall take possession of and\r\n  temporarily control the States now in rebellion until peace shall be\r\n  restored and republican government can be established deliberately,\r\n  undisturbed by the sound or fear of arms, and under the guidance of\r\n  law?\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the condition of the rebellion, Mr. Davis declared:\r\n“We have occupied a vast area wrested from its power, but to this day we\r\nhave not expelled the rebels from _any State_ they ever held.” In no\r\nportion of those States could military power “be withdrawn for a moment\r\nwithout instant insurrection”; and he added, “There is no rebel State\r\nheld now by the United States enough of whose population adheres to the\r\nUnion to be intrusted with the government of the State. One tenth cannot\r\ncontrol nine tenths. Five tenths are nowhere willing to undertake the\r\ncontrol of the other five tenths.” In West Virginia, he said, such a\r\ncondition existed and had been recognized. “In no other State—the only\r\none in respect to which a doubt can exist is Tennessee—in no other State\r\nis there such a portion of territory held, or any such portion of\r\npopulation under our control, or any such portion of it which is in our\r\ncontrol inspired by such sentiments toward the Government of the United\r\nStates, so free from fear of the returning wave of rebel invasion, so\r\nassured of the continued supremacy of the United States, that we ought\r\nto be willing to trust them with this power. You can get a handful of\r\nmen in the several States who would be glad to take the offices if\r\nprotected by the troops of the United States, but you have nowhere a\r\nbody of independent, loyal partisans of the United States, ready to meet\r\nthe rebels in arms, ready to die for the Republic, who claim the\r\nConstitution as their birthright, count all other privileges light in\r\ncomparison, and resolve at every hazard to maintain it.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the loyal masses of the South, of whom so much was heard at\r\nthe beginning of the war, he remarked:\r\n\r\n  It is the most astounding spectacle in history that in the Southern\r\n  States, with more than half of the population opposed to it, a great\r\n  revolution was effected against their wishes and against their\r\n  votes, without a battle, a riot, or a protest in behalf of the\r\n  beneficent Government of their fathers—a revolution whose opponents\r\n  hastened to lead it, without a martyr to the cause they deserted\r\n  except the nameless heroes of the mountains of Tennessee, or a\r\n  confessor of the faith they had avowed save the illustrious Petigru\r\n  of South Carolina!\r\n\r\n  ... There is no fact that any one has stated on authority at all\r\n  reliable that any respectable proportion of the people of the\r\n  Southern States now in rebellion are willing to accept any terms\r\n  that even our opponents on the other side of the House are willing\r\n  to offer them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  What, then, are we to do with the population in these States? To\r\n  make “confusion worse confounded” by erecting by the side of the\r\n  hostile State government a new State government on the shifting\r\n  sands of that whirlpool, to be supported by us while we are there\r\n  and to turn its power against us when we are driven out? That would\r\n  be to erect a new throne where\r\n\r\n                 “Chaos umpire sits,\r\n                 And by decision more embroils the fray\r\n                 By which he reigns.”\r\n\r\n  In my judgment, it is not safe to confide the vast authority of\r\n  State governments to the doubtful loyalty of the rebel States until\r\n  armed rebellion shall have been trampled into the dust, until every\r\n  armed rebel shall have vanished from the State, until there shall be\r\n  in the South no hope of independence and no fear of subjection,\r\n  until the United States is bearded by no military power and the laws\r\n  can be executed by courts and sheriffs without the ever-present\r\n  menace of military authority. Until we have reached that point, this\r\n  bill proposes that the President shall appoint a civil governor to\r\n  administer the government under the laws of the United States in\r\n  force in the States respectively at the outbreak of the rebellion,\r\n  subject, of course, to the necessities of military occupation.\r\n\r\nWhen military opposition shall have been suppressed, continued Mr.\r\nDavis, then call upon the people to reorganize their governments in\r\ntheir own way, “subject to the conditions that we think essential to our\r\npermanent peace, and to prevent the revival hereafter of the\r\nrebellion....”\r\n\r\nTo establish republican forms of government that the people of the\r\nUnited States would agree to, three modes were indicated: “One is to\r\nremove the cause of the war by an alteration of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States prohibiting slavery everywhere within its limits. That,\r\nsir, goes to the root of the matter, and should consecrate the nation’s\r\ntriumph. But there are thirty-four States—three fourths of them would be\r\ntwenty-six. I believe there are twenty-five States represented in this\r\nCongress, so that we, on that basis, cannot change the Constitution. It\r\nis, therefore, a condition precedent in that view of the case, that more\r\nStates shall have governments organized within them.”\r\n\r\nHe next noticed the calculation based on three fourths of the States\r\nthen represented in Congress, a construction held by Thaddeus Stevens,\r\nbut even that view was not without its difficulties. The States of New\r\nJersey, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware were named as doubtful. If such\r\nan amendment were adopted it still left “the whole field of the civil\r\nadministration of the States prior to the recognition of State\r\ngovernments, all laws necessary to the ascertainment of the will of the\r\npeople, and all restrictions on the return to power of the leaders of\r\nthe rebellion, wholly unprovided for.” The constitutional amendment met\r\nhis hearty approval, but it was not a complete remedy.\r\n\r\nRelative to the Administration policy, he observed:\r\n\r\n  The next plan is that inaugurated by the President of the United\r\n  States in the proclamation of the 8th of December, called the\r\n  amnesty proclamation. That proposes no guardianship of the United\r\n  States over the reorganization of the governments, no law to\r\n  prescribe who shall vote, no civil functionaries to see that the law\r\n  is faithfully executed, no supervising authority to control and\r\n  judge of the election. But if, in any manner, by the toleration of\r\n  martial law, lately proclaimed the fundamental law, under the\r\n  dictation of any military authority, or under the prescriptions of a\r\n  provost marshal, something in the form of a government shall be\r\n  presented, represented to rest on the votes of one tenth of the\r\n  population, the President will recognize that, provided it does not\r\n  _contravene_ the proclamation of freedom and the laws of Congress;\r\n  and, to secure that, an oath is exacted.\r\n\r\n  Now you will observe that there is no guarantee of law to watch over\r\n  the organization of that government. It may combine all the\r\n  population of a State; it may combine one tenth only; or ten\r\n  governments may come competing for recognition at the door of the\r\n  Executive mansion. The executive authority is pledged; Congress is\r\n  not pledged. It may be recognized by the military power and may not\r\n  be recognized by the civil power, so that it would have a doubtful\r\n  existence, half civil and half military, neither a temporary\r\n  government by law of Congress nor a State government, something as\r\n  unknown to the Constitution as the rebel government that refuses to\r\n  recognize it.\r\n\r\nIn examining the operation of the Executive proclamation on the\r\nexistence of slavery, Mr. Davis asked, how does it accomplish the\r\nreorganization of the government on the basis of universal freedom? and\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n  The only prescription is that the government shall not _contravene_\r\n  the provisions of that proclamation. Sir, if that proclamation be\r\n  valid, then we are relieved from all trouble on that score; but if\r\n  that proclamation be not valid, then the oath to support it is\r\n  without legal sanction, for the President can ask no man to bind\r\n  himself by an oath to support an unfounded proclamation or an\r\n  unconstitutional law even for a moment, still less till it shall\r\n  have been declared void by the Supreme Court of the United\r\n  States.... If, therefore, he shall have taken the oath, he can, in\r\n  good conscience as well as in good law, disregard it the next\r\n  moment; so that, in point of fact, the law leaves us where the\r\n  proclamation does; it adds nothing to its legality, nothing to its\r\n  force.\r\n\r\n  But what is the proclamation which the new governments must not\r\n  contravene? That certain negroes shall be free, and that certain\r\n  other negroes shall remain slaves. The proclamation therefore\r\n  recognizes the existence of slavery. It does just exactly what all\r\n  the constitutions of the rebel States prior to the rebellion did;\r\n  ... and, therefore, the old constitutions might be restored\r\n  to-morrow without _contravening_ the proclamation of freedom. Those\r\n  constitutions do not say that the President shall not have the\r\n  right, in the exercise of his military authority, to emancipate\r\n  slaves within the States.... They do not even establish slavery....\r\n  They merely recognize it just as the proclamation recognizes its\r\n  existence in parts of Virginia and in parts of Louisiana. So that\r\n  the one tenth of the population at whose hands the President\r\n  proposes to accept and guarantee a State government, can elect\r\n  officers under the old constitution of their State in exactly the\r\n  same terms and with exactly the same powers existing at the time of\r\n  the rebellion, and may, under his proclamation, demand a\r\n  recognition.... So soon as the State government is recognized, the\r\n  operation of the proclamation becomes merely a judicial question.\r\n  The right of a negro to his freedom is a legal right divesting a\r\n  right of property, and is to be enforced in the courts; and then the\r\n  question is what the courts will say about the proclamation. Is it\r\n  valid or invalid? Does it of itself confer a legal right to freedom\r\n  on negroes who were slaves? Is it within the authority of the\r\n  Executive?... How local State courts, created by the Southern\r\n  people, will decide such a question _no one_ can doubt.... It is,\r\n  therefore, under the scheme of the President, merely a judicial\r\n  question, to be adjudged by judicial rules, and to be determined by\r\n  the courts.... I do not desire to argue the legality of the\r\n  proclamation of freedom. I think it safer to _make it law_.... Under\r\n  the act of 1862 the President is authorized to use the negro\r\n  population for the suppression of the rebellion; while the rebellion\r\n  lasts, his proclamation in law exempts the slave from the duty of\r\n  obeying his master, but after the rebellion is extinguished, the\r\n  master’s rights are in his own hands, subject only to the opinion of\r\n  the courts on the legal effect of the proclamation, without a single\r\n  precedent to sanction it, and opposed by the solemn assertions of\r\n  our Government against the principle worked to authorize it.\r\n  Gentlemen are less prudent or less in earnest than I am if they will\r\n  risk the great issues involved in this question on such authorities\r\n  before the courts of justice.\r\n\r\n  By the bill we propose to preclude the judicial question by the\r\n  solution of a political question. How so? By the paramount power of\r\n  Congress to reorganize governments in those States, to impose such\r\n  conditions as it thinks necessary to secure the permanence of\r\n  republican government, to refuse to recognize any governments there\r\n  which do not prohibit slavery forever. Ay, gentlemen take the\r\n  responsibility to say, in the face of those who clamor for speedy\r\n  recognition of governments tolerating slavery, that the safety of\r\n  the people of the United States is the supreme law; that their will\r\n  is the supreme rule of law, and that we are authorized to pronounce\r\n  their will on this subject—take the responsibility to say that we\r\n  will revise the judgments of our ancestors; that we have experience\r\n  written in blood which they had not; that we find now, what they\r\n  darkly doubted, that slavery is really, radically inconsistent with\r\n  the permanence of republican governments; and that, being charged by\r\n  the supreme law of the land, on our conscience and judgment, to\r\n  guarantee, that is, to continue, maintain, and enforce, if it exist,\r\n  to institute and restore when overthrown, republican governments\r\n  throughout the broad limits of the republic, we will weed out every\r\n  element of their policy which we think incompatible with its\r\n  permanence and endurance.... It [the bill] adds to the authority of\r\n  the proclamation the sanction of Congress....\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen must deny the jurisdiction of Congress over the States\r\n  where there are no recognized governments, or place a bound or limit\r\n  to the discretion of Congress....\r\n\r\n  And if the sentiments of State pride and State rights be touched by\r\n  the assertion of this wide discretion, which men may deny but cannot\r\n  expunge, I would admonish those who dislike it that it is a\r\n  jurisdiction which nothing but the dereliction of the States can\r\n  wake into activity, and they who wish to exclude it from their\r\n  limits have only not to give occasion for its exercise by renouncing\r\n  obedience to the Constitution and pulling down their own State\r\n  governments. But now the jurisdiction has attached in all the rebel\r\n  States. Until Congress has assented, there is no State government in\r\n  any rebel State, and none will be recognized except such as\r\n  recognize the power of the United States; so that we come down to\r\n  this: whether we—and when I say we, I mean we upon this side of the\r\n  House, who are firmly, thoroughly, and honestly convinced that the\r\n  time has come not merely to strike the arms from the hands of the\r\n  rebels, but to strike the fetters from the arms of the slaves, and\r\n  remove that domineering and cohesive power without which we could\r\n  have had no rebellion, and which now is its animating spirit, and\r\n  which will die when it dies—....\r\n\r\n  And if it be time [for Congress to assert its authority] then all I\r\n  ask in conclusion is, that gentlemen will go and read that great\r\n  argument of Daniel Webster in the Rhode Island case ... where he met\r\n  this semi-revolutionary attempt to count heads and call that the\r\n  people, and maintained—and so the Supreme Court judged when it\r\n  refused to take jurisdiction of the question—that the great\r\n  political law of America is that every change of government shall be\r\n  conducted under the supervising authority of some existing\r\n  legislative body throwing the protection of law around the polls,\r\n  defining the rights of voters, protecting them in the exercise of\r\n  the elective franchise, guarding against fraud, repelling violence,\r\n  and appointing arbiters to pronounce the result and declare the\r\n  persons chosen by the people.... He [Webster] maintained it to be\r\n  the great fundamental principle of the American government that\r\n  legislation shall guide every political change, and that it assumes\r\n  that somewhere within the United States there is always a permanent,\r\n  organized legal authority which shall guide the tottering footsteps\r\n  of those who seek to restore governments which are disorganized and\r\n  broken down.\r\n\r\nThe bill, he asserted in conclusion, was an effort to apply this great\r\nprinciple of American law.[312]\r\n\r\nRepresentative Scofield, of Pennsylvania, said, April 29, 1864, when the\r\nsubject was again before the House, that the continuity of\r\nconstitutional government in the seceded States had been broken, the\r\nregular transmission of political power interrupted. How, he inquired,\r\nshould the severed thread be joined? By the unconstrained action of the\r\npeople themselves, say the gentlemen in opposition. He indorsed that\r\nsentiment, and added that when the people of those States should ground\r\nthe arms of their rebellion, and uncoerced take upon themselves the easy\r\nyoke and light burden of the ever gentle Federal Government it would\r\nmark a glad day in those uncheerful years of our history.\r\n\r\nFor those States from which hostile armies had been excluded Congress\r\nshould legislate or leave the people in the rough hand of military law.\r\nThe bill designed to discharge that duty was generally acceptable to any\r\none who conceded the propriety of Congressional action, its three\r\nprohibitions being probably the only debatable points,—that is the\r\nassumption of Confederate debts, the prevention of Confederate officers\r\nfrom voting and the prohibition of involuntary servitude.\r\n\r\nTo assume the rebel debt, he asserted, would be to offer a high bounty\r\nfor future rebellions; if rebel officers were permitted to vote, upon\r\nwhat principle of comparative justice could the privilege be denied to\r\nordinary criminals? These officers were guilty of the highest crime\r\nagainst government. As to the third prohibition he had more to say.\r\n\r\n“If God shall give us victory,” continued Mr. Scofield, “and enable us\r\nto subdue or scatter the army of the enemy, is a voluntary reunion of\r\nthe States possible? I say _voluntary_ because I suppose nobody desires\r\na Union always to be maintained by force; and I use the word _reunion_\r\nbecause nobody proposes a form of government different from our present\r\nsystem of State brotherhood. I am not now speaking of the several plans\r\nof reconstruction, for they are designed only as temporary devices,\r\nlooking to a reunion.... My question looks beyond the battle and beyond\r\nreconstruction. When the victory is won, if won it shall be, and the\r\ntransition over, will the insurgent States _willingly stay_ where they\r\nhave been _forcibly put_ in their old places in the old Union?... Our\r\nown liberties could not survive their permanent subjugation. When the\r\nFederal Government becomes strong enough to hold eleven States as\r\ncolonies, it will be too strong, I fear, for the people’s liberties.”\r\nAll motives for those States ever to depart should be removed.\r\n\r\nSimilarity of ideas he characterized as the bond of nationality, and\r\nnamed Ireland, Hungary and Poland to show the opposite. In the United\r\nStates slavery was the one subject of estrangement. Could North and\r\nSouth be brought to think alike on that subject? The theory that each\r\nside could hold its own opinions on slavery and no evil consequences\r\nfollow was somewhat to blame. That theory failed in practice and for\r\nthat failure each side blamed the other.\r\n\r\nThe fathers, he said, lived under that theory, that slavery and freedom\r\ncould coexist, but they expected that the institution would soon become\r\nextinct. Hence they only tolerated it. Slavery was to recede slowly and\r\nfreedom to follow steadily. Upon _that_ basis they got along very well\r\nand so could their descendants. Instead of consenting to go, slavery\r\ndemanded expansion and perpetuity. This was reversing the compromise of\r\nthe fathers; this change had to be discussed, the slave power took\r\numbrage and secession followed. If one sentiment must prevail, then\r\nslavery, which could not stand discussion, must yield if there was to be\r\na reunion. To live in peace together the North must embrace slavery or\r\nthe South must abandon it.\r\n\r\nTo adopt slavery would mean the adoption by 20,000,000 people of\r\nsentiments favorable thereto, whereas the institution never had any\r\nfriends in the North. Those in that section so considered were only its\r\napologists. If, three years ago, slavery had no real friends in the\r\nNorth, who would advocate it when it had attempted to destroy the most\r\nbeneficent of governments? To reconcile the free States would\r\nnecessitate a change of opinion—to adopt freedom as the dominant idea\r\nwould require simply a change of _investment_ in the sections. For the\r\npresent extinguish the conflagration, for the future remove the\r\ninflammable material from which it was kindled. For the present seize\r\nthe mad revolutionists of the South, for the future destroy the virus\r\nthat poisoned their blood.\r\n\r\nAll who favored emancipation he favored as co-workers for a voluntary\r\nand peaceful reunion of the States; slavery was presented merely as an\r\nelement of discord and disunion and as such he asked for its\r\nremoval.[313]\r\n\r\nMr. Williams said that the war was inaugurated on the theory that the\r\nStates were _in_, whereas the great fact of war was a proclamation that\r\nthey were _out_. Northern Democrats were willing to accept the fact that\r\nthey were _out, without war_—to adopt the principle of the _laissez nous\r\nfaire_ of the rebel authorities and to treat with them upon the idea of\r\na _reconstruction_; peaceful secession with _reconstruction by treaty_.\r\nThe severance of the States was complete, though the hope of recovery\r\nremained. By releasing the crews of their privateers, by blockading\r\ntheir ports the Federal authorities had recognized them as a _de facto_\r\ngovernment; Federal legislation had put them under the ban as alien\r\nenemies. In the minds of the framers of the Constitution the theory of\r\nan indissoluble Union referred to _the right_, to its organic law. They\r\ndid not mean that it could not be ruptured by violence. If the\r\ngovernments of the States were dissolved “they must, of course, be\r\nreconstructed under the auspices of the conquering power, and that not\r\nby the Executive, but by the Legislature of the Union, whose sword he\r\nbears, and which only, consistently with the genius of our institutions,\r\nthe past practice of the Government, and the letter as well as spirit of\r\nthe Constitution, can venture to determine what use shall be made of the\r\nterritories conquered by it, and when and upon what terms they shall be\r\nreadmitted into full communion as members of this Government.... To\r\npermit any executive officer to declare its law, and set it in motion,\r\nand place it under the control of a minority—a mere tithe of its\r\ncitizens—with power to send delegates to Congress with representation\r\nunimpaired and unaffected—even though he should reenact a part of its\r\nabrogated Constitution—would be, as I think, a monstrous anomaly, a\r\nviolation of fundamental principles, and a precedent fraught with great\r\ndanger to republican liberty.... To come back into the Union, it must\r\neither be born anew or come back with all its rights unimpaired, except\r\nthose material ones which have been destroyed in the progress of the\r\nwar. There is, I think, no middle ground, as there is no power either\r\nhere or elsewhere to prescribe terms which shall abridge the rights or\r\nprivileges of a State that has _not_ been out of the Union, or returns\r\nto it in virtue of its original title.” The rebellious States, he\r\ndeclared, “are in the Union for correction, not for _heirship_.” In\r\npoint of fact they were out.\r\n\r\nReplying to an observation of Fernando Wood, Mr. Williams said: “We are\r\nin favor, at all events, of preserving all that is left of it [the\r\nUnion], and intend, with the blessing of God, to win back the residue,\r\nand pass it through the fire until it shall come out purged of the\r\nmalignant element that has unfitted it for freedom.\r\n\r\n“... Say that they [the rebellious States] are in the Union as before,\r\nand all your sacrifices have been idle, and all the blood spilled by you\r\nhas sunk into the earth in vain.”\r\n\r\nThe confiscation and distribution of the great baronial possessions of\r\nrebel leaders were in his judgment an essential element in any feasible\r\nplan of reconstruction. He deduced from passages in Bynkershoek and\r\nBarbeyrac that “everything belonging to the offending party is\r\nconfiscated.... _Indemnity_, _security_, and _punishment_ are all,\r\ntherefore, means of self-defense which may be legitimately used.”\r\n\r\nIs the forfeiture, he asked, of the estates and property of traitors,\r\nwhether they consist of lands or slaves, required for these purposes?\r\n“_Vae Victis_” is not the maxim of a humane conqueror. Though he would\r\nnot exclude the idea of mercy, he was not clear as to “the wisdom of a\r\nproclamation of amnesty in advance as a measure of pacification, without\r\nlimits as to time, and where submission after conquest, and when it is\r\nno longer a virtue but a necessity, is to be rewarded with the same\r\nimpunity as a voluntary return to duty before that time.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the nature, cause and fury of the war, he continued: “Its\r\nsuppression has become impossible without removing the cause of the\r\nstrife, and disabling our enemy by liberating his slaves, and arming\r\nthem against him.”\r\n\r\nNo reparation was adequate for the injury inflicted; for, said he,\r\n“there can be no punishment, except in the divestiture of the rights and\r\nthe seizure of the estates of the guilty leaders. There is no security\r\nexcept in the distribution of the latter.” From these he would carve out\r\ninheritances for the widow and the helpless offspring of the Northern\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nFor eighteen months, he observed in conclusion, the war was conducted\r\nupon the principle of inflicting as little injury as possible upon the\r\nenemy.[314]\r\n\r\nThe speech of Mr. Williams was marked by considerable fluency as well as\r\ngreat elegance of diction; it was the effort of a scholar, though not\r\nconfined strictly to the question before the House. He introduced with\r\ndirectness and vigor the ideas of indemnity, security and punishment;\r\nthese, it may be remarked, became important elements in determining the\r\nmode of reinstatement that finally emerged from the chaos of resolutions\r\nand plans submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Baldwin, of Michigan, believed the bill “to be an utter\r\nsubversion of the Constitution”; even a latitudinarian construction of\r\nthat instrument would not justify it. It embraced a plan that could be\r\nenforced by only the military arm. It was the precursor of the\r\nestablishment of a despotism. That measure, as well as the President’s\r\nplan, was fraught with danger.\r\n\r\nHe lamented interference with the elective franchise and the denial of\r\nthe privileges of the writ of _habeas corpus_. For eighteen months the\r\nwar had been waged for the destruction of the South, not for the\r\nrestoration of the Union. Did not wisdom, he asked, suggest that all\r\nplans of reconstruction which tended only to intensify hate and postpone\r\nthe day of peace be abandoned? Speaking of the effect of Mr. Lincoln’s\r\npolicy he observed: “That it was intended that the amnesty proclamation\r\nof last December would hasten the end of this strife, I do not believe.\r\nWe are told that nearly every Southern paper published it, and it only\r\nnerved them to the performance of more earnest deeds.” The President’s\r\nplan as well as that of Congress, he believed, were designed to\r\nperpetuate the present dominant party by the vote of reconstructed\r\nStates. A considerable portion of his remarks was devoted to criticism\r\nof the Administration.[315]\r\n\r\nMr. Thayer, of Pennsylvania, believed that the powers delegated by the\r\npeople of the United States to the national Government were sufficient\r\nfor the great work of reconstruction, and added: “That the time has come\r\nin which Congress, in the exercise of the great powers conferred upon\r\nit, should settle and authoritatively declare the terms and conditions\r\nupon which the people of the rebellious districts should be restored to\r\ntheir State privileges and resume their just relations to the national\r\nGovernment, does not admit of doubt.” People occupying territory wrested\r\nfrom the rebellion should be restored with the least possible delay to\r\nthe privileges of representative government. “Congress alone can enact\r\nthe laws which are to reconstruct the political societies in which the\r\nfundamental principle of loyalty to the national Government and\r\nobedience to its laws and respect for its authority have been\r\nobliterated by the violence of rebellion. The President of the United\r\nStates cannot enact these laws, and it is in my opinion a reproach to\r\nCongress that by its inaction up to the present time it has rendered it\r\nnecessary that the national Executive should be obliged by a sense of\r\nobligation to the public welfare to resort to temporary expedients for\r\nthe preservation of public order and the assertion of national supremacy\r\nin those districts and States which the valor of our soldiers has\r\nredeemed from the insulting domination of the rebel army.”\r\n\r\nExecutive action, he asserted, was suggested by necessity. “What has\r\nbeen done in that respect by the President I believe to have been well\r\ndone, wisely done, and patriotically done, and to have been demanded\r\nalike by the necessity of the case and for the welfare of the Republic.”\r\nThe exclusive right over the subject, however, belonged to Congress,\r\nwhich should relieve the President of all responsibility therein.\r\n\r\nSafeguards against the recurrence of similar outbreaks in the future\r\nshould be required. He would support the measure before the House\r\nbecause of these safeguards or pledges. Unconditional and perpetual\r\nloyalty in the new governments in the rebellious States to that of the\r\nUnited States, extirpation and perpetual prohibition of slavery and\r\ncompulsory repudiation of the rebel debt were the chief among these.\r\n\r\n“The safety of the country,” said he, “its future repose, the\r\ncontinuance of the Union, and the firm establishment of our political\r\nsystem imperatively demand that in the reorganization of local\r\ngovernments in the rebel States the foundations of such governments must\r\nrest upon the principle of submission to the Constitution and laws of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n“... It is also necessary to guard the elective franchise and the\r\nprivilege of holding office in those States against the intrusion and\r\ntreachery of all who have in any sense been leaders in the present\r\nrebellion. For this purpose prudence requires that all who have held\r\noffice under the pretended rebel government should be excluded from\r\nthese privileges.”\r\n\r\nThe seventh section of the bill he would like to see so modified as to\r\ndeclare that no debt of the pretended Confederate States, and no debt\r\ncontracted by the State for the purpose of prosecuting the war against\r\nthe United States or of giving aid to its enemies, should be recognized\r\nor paid by the State.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular doctrine, he remarked in conclusion, that those who\r\nhad thrown off all restraints of the Constitution and who for years had\r\nwaged war for the purpose of overthrowing it should be entitled to\r\ndemand its protection while engaged in armed hostility to it.[316]\r\n\r\nMr. Yeaman did not believe Congress had a right to legislate away the\r\nlaws and institutions of these States. The American people, he said,\r\nwould come out of the contest with a better political education, an\r\neducation having for its basis the idea that _they are a nation_, and he\r\nadded, “a war to enforce the theory of secession will end in an\r\nincreased consolidated nationality.” The theory expressed in the\r\nVirginia and Kentucky Resolutions was the fatal blow in our political\r\nhistory. His address was in the nature of an essay in political science\r\nand not altogether germane to the measure under consideration.[317]\r\n\r\n“Pass a judicious enabling act,” urged Mr. Longyear, “with proper\r\nsafeguards, of which the people may avail themselves to organize civil\r\ngovernments at the very earliest opportunity, and it will afford a\r\nrallying point for the Union sentiment remaining there, and tend to\r\nfoster it and nourish it into a healthful and vigorous existence. It\r\nwill prevent perplexing and complicated irregularities and diversities\r\nof action, and tend largely to harmony and strength in our future\r\ndeliberations. No stronger illustration of the necessity and propriety\r\nof immediate action need be given than the case of Tennessee, Louisiana,\r\nand Arkansas.\r\n\r\n“The President’s proclamation does not solve the difficulty. As a\r\nproclamation of amnesty, as a general outline or plan for organizing new\r\nState governments, as a prescription of safeguards and conditions\r\nprecedent to such organization, it will ever stand as a bright and\r\nglorious page in the history of the present Administration. But it is\r\nincomplete for lack of constitutional power. That can be conferred by\r\nCongress alone, under the power to admit new States.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“If we succeed [in the war] we make no conquest of territory, because\r\nthat is already ours. We simply succeed, in that respect, in bringing\r\nthat which is our own again under our control.” Because of rebellion the\r\nconstitutions and laws of those States had ceased to exist, and as\r\nslavery was established solely in State laws that also ceased to exist.\r\nThe only object of a constitutional amendment was to prohibit its\r\nestablishment forever. Freedom, he added, was being substituted for\r\nslavery. In respect to slavery and the slave power we were in the midst\r\nof a revolution. They proved themselves inimical to civil liberty, to\r\nthe Constitution and to republican institutions.[318]\r\n\r\nTo the remark of Fernando Wood, of New York, that the South could not be\r\nsubdued, Ignatius Donnelly replied, “We are doing it!” and he added, if\r\nthe system of the President is deficient in the machinery that will\r\nensure safety “it is our duty to supply that defect. The plan of the\r\nPresident, unsupported by any action on our part, hangs upon too many\r\ncontingencies. It may be repealed by his successor; it may be resisted\r\nby Congress; it may be annulled by the Supreme Court. It rests the\r\nwelfare of the nation upon the mind of one man; it rests the whole\r\nstructure of social order upon the unstable foundation of individual\r\noaths.” Upon this subject Mr. Donnelly observed that General Jefferson\r\nThompson, C. S. A., noted in passing through those regions that men\r\nconsulted their memorandum books to see what oath they had taken last.\r\nThousands of rebel dead had been found on the battle field with oaths of\r\nallegiance, sworn to and subscribed, in their pockets. Mr. Donnelly\r\nfavored the bill, and if any measure of greater security could be found\r\nhe would support that. He desired, as soon as it could be attained, an\r\namendment of the Constitution that would prohibit slavery.\r\n\r\n“I am aware, Mr. Speaker,” he continued, “of the great claims which Mr.\r\nLincoln has upon the people of the United States. I recognize that\r\npopularity which accompanies him, and which, considering the ordeal\r\nthrough which he has passed, is little less than miraculous. I recognize\r\nthat unquestioning faith in his honesty and ability which pervades all\r\nclasses, and the sincere affection with which almost the entire\r\npopulation regard him. We must not underrate him even in our praises. He\r\nis a great man. Great not after the old models of the world, but with a\r\nhomely and original greatness. He will stand out to future ages in the\r\nhistory of these crowded and confused times with wonderful distinctness.\r\nHe has carried a vast and discordant population safely and peacefully\r\nthrough the greatest of political revolutions with such consummate\r\nsagacity and skill that while he led he appeared to follow; while he\r\ninnovated beyond all precedent he has been denounced as tardy; while he\r\nstruck the shackles from the limbs of three million slaves he has been\r\nhailed as a conservative! If to adapt, persistently and continuously,\r\njust and righteous principles to all the perplexed windings and changes\r\nof human events, and to secure in the end the complete triumph of those\r\nprinciples, be statesmanship, then Abraham Lincoln is the first of\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\n“If the end of the war is to be a restoration _of the appearance_ of the\r\nold Government; a patching together of the broken shreds and fragments;\r\na propping up of the fabric in such style that the next Administration\r\nmay possibly get out from under it before it falls, then that\r\nproclamation may be found all-sufficient. But for all other purposes it\r\nwill be utterly unavailing. It does not reach the heart of the\r\ndistemper....\r\n\r\n“We owe more than this to ourselves; we owe more than this to the South.\r\nWe must regenerate the South.”[319]\r\n\r\nThis discriminating tribute to the character and genius of Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas paid by no servile flatterer; it was not the eulogy of even a\r\nsupporter of the Presidential plan of reconstruction; nor was it\r\ndesigned as a discharge of, or uttered in expectation of compelling,\r\nExecutive favors, but appears rather to have been the spontaneous\r\ntestimony of a keen interpreter of men and measures not less creditable\r\nto the insight of the speaker than to the subject of his remarks.\r\nOthers, it is true, refrained from misrepresenting the President’s\r\nattitude and cheerfully ascribed to him patriotic and enlightened\r\nmotives in his public conduct. Mr. Donnelly alone condensed into a\r\nparagraph a panegyric with which the judgment of posterity is in\r\ncomplete accord. This portion of his speech is quoted both to show that\r\nthere were men in Congress who fully appreciated the greatness of the\r\nPresident, and that criticism of his measures was not in many instances\r\nsuggested by feelings of personal hostility.\r\n\r\nVery different were the remarks of Mr. Dennison, who declared that “The\r\npassage of this law will be the final gathering up of the reserved\r\nrights of States, and the last vestige of protection of the citizen\r\nunder State constitutions will be taken away, and all power centralized\r\nin the General Government.” He opposed the bill for the additional\r\nreason that it was intended to legalize and perpetuate the\r\nunconstitutional acts of the President. “There does not exist on the\r\nearth a more despotic government than that of Abraham Lincoln. He is a\r\ndespot in fact if not in name.”[320] These excerpts sufficiently\r\nindicate the character of his invective.\r\n\r\n“I have offered a substitute to the bill of the committee,” said\r\nThaddeus Stevens, “because that does not, in my judgment, meet the evil.\r\nIt partially acknowledges the rebel States to have rights under the\r\nConstitution, which I deny, as war has abrogated them all. I do not\r\ninquire what rights we have under it, but they have none. The bill takes\r\nfor granted that the President may partially interfere in their civil\r\nadministration, not as conqueror but as President of the United States.\r\nIt adopts in some measure the idea that less than a majority may\r\nregulate to some extent the affairs of a republic.”[321] The chief\r\nobjection of Mr. Stevens, however, was that it removed the opportunity\r\nof confiscating the property of the disloyal.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Wadsworth, of Kentucky, he said, agreed with him that the\r\npeople of the South could plead none of the constitutional provisions in\r\ntheir defence. Whatever rights they possessed were those of belligerents\r\nengaged in war. “When we come to enforce the rights of conquest,”\r\ncontinued the Pennsylvania member, “we should be justified in insisting\r\nupon the _extreme rights_ of war, without yielding to the mitigations\r\ndictated by modern usage with regard to belligerents originally composed\r\nof foreign nations engaged in war which they deemed just.” Explaining\r\nformer recommendations which in many quarters had called forth severe\r\ncriticism, he said: “I thought that the women and children, the\r\nnon-combatants, and those who were forced by the laws of their State\r\ninto the armies, should be spared; and the property of the guilty,\r\nmorally as well as politically guilty, only should be taken. And yet we\r\nhear a howl of horror from conservative gentlemen at the inhumanity of\r\nthe proposition.” He still further explained his sentiments on this\r\noccasion. After stating that the people of the Confederate States were\r\nsovereign and acted through their representatives, he asserted that they\r\nhad commenced and were continuing to wage an unjust war and therefore\r\ntheir private property was liable to confiscation. The right to take\r\ntheir property existed, but no one, he said, “advises the execution of\r\nthe extreme right. But the right exists and ought to be enforced against\r\nthe most guilty. To allow them to return with their estates untouched,\r\non the theory that they have never gone out of the Union, seems to me\r\nrank injustice to loyal men.” Of those who denied that the Confederate\r\nStates had gone out of the Union he inquired, “What are we making war\r\nupon them for? For seceding; for going out of the Union against law. The\r\nlaw forbids a man to rob or murder, and yet robbery and murder exist _de\r\nfacto_ but not _de jure_.” Hence the Constitution does not allow the\r\nStates to go out of the Union. He referred also in his speech to a\r\nresolution introduced by Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, which passed the House\r\nwithout a division and declared the Confederate States a public enemy,\r\nengaged in a public war.[322]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, May 2, Representative Strouse remarked that immediately\r\nafter the disaster of Bull Run the House almost unanimously passed the\r\nCrittenden Resolutions, which declared that “This war is not waged in\r\nany spirit of oppression, or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,\r\nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established\r\ninstitutions of these States.” This announcement, he asserted, brought\r\nvolunteers, whereas now, 1864, county, State and Federal bounties\r\ncombined could not induce men to enlist, and the cause of the apathy was\r\nthat the war had been perverted from the purpose announced in the\r\nresolutions referred to. The entire speech had little reference to the\r\nbill of Mr. Davis, but seemed rather designed, by an attack on the\r\nAdministration, to please his Democratic constituents.[323]\r\n\r\nMr. Cravens said that the dominant party did not distinguish between\r\nloyalty to the Administration and loyalty to the Government. The time\r\nfor compromise had passed when the Republican party refused to accept\r\nthe Crittenden Resolutions. That organization was in all essentials an\r\nabolition party. If there ever was a distinction it no longer existed.\r\nHe cited a rather complete list of all the measures acted upon by\r\nCongress showing their concern for the negro; he charged neglect of the\r\nwhite soldier, his widow and orphans; quoted from the speech of Thaddeus\r\nStevens on the admission of West Virginia, and named Representative\r\nJulian as uttering sentiments little behind the Pennsylvania member in\r\nboldness and exhibiting no more reverence for the Constitution. The\r\nincapacity and dire wickedness of the President and his “courtiers” came\r\nin for a share of criticism.\r\n\r\nMr. Gooch on the following day, May 3, remarked that the rebellion was\r\nbut the military phase of the conflict of ideas which began with the\r\nadoption of the Constitution. “When we shall have crushed the rebellion\r\nand restored peace to all parts of the country we shall hold this\r\nterritory, not by a new title, but by the old, not as territory acquired\r\nby conquest, but territory defended and maintained against revolt.... I\r\ncan see no reason why the President, as Commander-in-Chief, should not,\r\nin the meantime, so use the military power as to aid and assist the\r\nloyal people of any one of these States in the organization of a loyal\r\nState government.... All these acts by the President, or the military\r\npower under him, in thus aiding and assisting the loyal people in these\r\nStates, impose no obligation upon Congress to recognize them until such\r\ntime as it shall deem proper to do so, and any recognition the military\r\npower may see fit to give to these governments can never fix their\r\nstatus in the Union. Congress alone has the power to determine what\r\ngovernment is the legitimate one in a State, and its decision is binding\r\non the other departments of the Government.”[324]\r\n\r\nMr. Perry, of New Jersey, spoke of the duration of the war, predicted\r\nthe general bankruptcy which its great expense would bring about, and\r\ncalculated that in eleven years the cost of the war would equal the\r\nassessed value of property.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Executive plan he said: “And here the President’s design\r\nis perfectly evident, to secure a majority of the delegates to the\r\nnominating convention of his party, and to provide for his own election\r\nby the House of Representatives in the event of there not being an\r\nelection by the people. By this plan the narrow foothold maintained by\r\nour armies in North Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Florida,\r\nArkansas, and elsewhere may send the pretended full delegations of those\r\nStates to this House. Mr. Speaker, I denominate the whole plan a\r\npolitical trick worthy of the most adroit and unscrupulous wire-puller\r\nof our ward primary meetings.” The State governments had not been\r\ndestroyed, he added, “nor can they be destroyed unless the rebels are\r\nfinally victorious, and establish their independence.”[325]\r\n\r\nFernando Wood said that Mexico had a republican form of government, and\r\nthat Texas came into the Union without changing the character of her\r\ngovernment except to substitute a governor for President and to change\r\nthe titles of some officials. Every Southern State possessed the same\r\nform of government which it did before secession. If, he asserted, they\r\nwere then republican in form, “they are so now.” The Confederate\r\nconstitution had all the elements of republicanism. The bill provided\r\nthat hereafter none of the States in rebellion should hold slaves. It\r\ndid not leave to the people the right to regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions. Is it republicanism to take from the people this\r\nprivilege? “To impose upon them a form of government of your own making,\r\nunder the pretext of this bill, would be the worst kind of tyranny,\r\nwhatever the provisions of your constitution might be.”[326]\r\n\r\nHe defended himself against serious charges of General Schenck, whom he\r\ncriticised severely. These accusations, however, were reiterated by Hon.\r\nWilliam D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, who at this point rose to speak on\r\nthe merits of the bill.\r\n\r\nThe proposed measure did not meet his unqualified approval. It lacked\r\nsome of the amendments suggested by Mr. Stevens. “I should like to see\r\nhis distinct declaration,” said Congressman Kelley, “that ‘The\r\nConfederate States are a public enemy, waging an unjust war, whose\r\ninjustice is so glaring that they have no right to claim the mitigation\r\nof the extreme rights of war which are accorded by modern usage to an\r\nenemy who has the right to consider the war a just one.’” He would like\r\nto see the bill of Mr. Davis provide also for the exclusion from\r\nCongress of all those States that seceded, and every part of them.\r\n\r\nAs more immediately important, however, he would prefer to see included\r\nin the measure the proposition of Mr. Stevens respecting amendments of\r\nthe Constitution; he denied the immortality of a State. It has its\r\nbeginning, its transitions and may have its end. “A State may be killed,\r\na State may commit suicide. An act of God, by destroying its\r\ninhabitants, might extinguish a State. A State could be conquered and\r\nheld by some strong and hostile power. The political people of each of\r\nthose States have overthrown the State. Through its corporate power each\r\nState destroyed its corporate life, and no one of them exists.” He also\r\ndenied that a State could transfer to any foreign power territory within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States. The Supreme Court had decided\r\nthat the Southern States were alien enemies and entitled to only the\r\nrights of such.[327]\r\n\r\nThe message of the President, Representative S. S. Cox believed, “should\r\nbe welcomed, not so much for what it is as for what it pretends to be.\r\nIt is his first adventure beyond the line of force into the field of\r\nconciliation....\r\n\r\n“To test the genuineness of this amnesty: five months have gone, but we\r\nsee no signs of thousands of Southern citizens rushing to embrace this\r\namnesty. Indeed, it is conceded that the rebellion is now more\r\nformidable than ever.” There was no genuine movement toward the\r\nrestoration of the seceded States. He would not take the oath of\r\nallegiance and swear support of the negro policies. How could Southern\r\nmen be expected to take the oath? Its terms provoked or irritated them\r\nstill more. The structure, he declared, was built on the Emancipation\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nThe bill of Mr. Davis had the same defects. That, too, was based upon\r\nthe one tenth system and the policy of forced emancipation. “In some of\r\nits features,” he said, “it is an improvement upon the rickety\r\nestablishment proposed by the President.\r\n\r\n“... The emancipation act of the gentleman [Lincoln] can never be\r\nreconciled with the normal control of the States over their domestic\r\ninstitutions, so all oaths to sustain the same are oaths to subvert the\r\nold governments, Federal and State.... The President’s plan, therefore,\r\nwhether intended or not, is an oath to encourage treason, and the plan\r\nof the gentleman from Maryland is a plan to consummate revolution.\r\n\r\n“... If his [the President’s] plan of making one tenth rule in the\r\nStates should succeed, then he will have ready at hand the electoral\r\nvotes of Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, North Carolina, and\r\nother States. He began this business in Florida the other day, and the\r\nblood which flowed at Olustee is the result of this scheme of personal\r\nambition!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“There is a sort of _odium historicum_,” proceeded Mr. Cox, “attached to\r\nall political test oaths.... They have been the bane and foil of good\r\ngovernment ever since bigotry began and revenge ruled. You cannot make\r\neight million people, nearly all in revolt at what they regard as the\r\ndetestable usurpations of abolition, forswear their hatred to abolition.\r\nYou force by this oath the freed negro into the very nostrils of the\r\nSouthern man, whose submission to law you seek.\r\n\r\n“The conditions of pardon only inflame but do not quench rebellion....\r\n\r\n“We may yet change the war from the diabolical purposes of those in\r\npower, by changing that power to other hands, and we are not ready to\r\nsever our Union while that hope remains.”\r\n\r\nPrecedents and analogies from both ancient and contemporary history were\r\ncited to demonstrate the folly of attempting to hold the South in her\r\nplace by force. These together with censure of the Administration and\r\ncriticism of the dominant party in Congress made up a great part of Mr.\r\nCox’s very long speech.[328]\r\n\r\nRepresentative Boutwell, of Massachusetts, referring, May 4, to the\r\nremarks of his colleague, Mr. Ashley, of the committee which reported\r\nthe bill, observed that “since this rebellion opened the Thirty-seventh\r\nCongress commenced its existence and ceased to exist; that this Congress\r\nis now closing the fifth month of its First Session, and that up to this\r\ntime no efficient, indeed no legislative steps whatever have been taken\r\nby which the Executive is to be guided in the affairs of the people\r\noccupying the territory that has been reclaimed from rebel domination.\r\nUnder these circumstances I think it due to the country that this House,\r\nat least, should do nothing which conveys any reflection upon his policy\r\nunless that policy be clearly and manifestly in contravention of the\r\nConstitution or of the well-ascertained and admitted principles of the\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\nWhen the populous parts of Louisiana were torn from rebel domination,\r\nand the State of Arkansas indicated in various ways the growth of a\r\nsentiment of loyalty and returning allegiance to the General Government,\r\nthe Executive had but one of three courses before him: either to be\r\nsilent, to govern by military authority alone, or else to establish a\r\ncivil government or at least to take initiatory steps toward such\r\nestablishment. “It was unquestionably his right and duty, in the absence\r\nof all legislative action, to govern these territories as fast and as\r\nfar as they were reclaimed by military power.”\r\n\r\nHe defended both the President and General Banks, who had for years been\r\nconsistent advocates of liberty. He then announced himself in favor of\r\nthe bill of Mr. Davis.\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens],” continued Mr. Boutwell,\r\n“maintains, as I understand, that these States are out of the Union;\r\nthat their territory is alien territory, and that we are making war\r\nagainst alien enemies. I do not admit either of these positions to be\r\ntrue. I feel quite sure that these eleven once-existing States are no\r\nlonger States of the Union. The evidence on which I rely in support of\r\nthis position is found first in the declaration made by the authorities\r\nof those States that they no longer exist as States of the American\r\nUnion. Next, we find that for three years and more they have been\r\nresisting the authority of the Government and have been carrying on a\r\nwar against it. It is absurd to say that States or people are a part of\r\nthe Government under the Constitution, and entitled to constitutional\r\nrights and privileges, when they have been carrying on war against the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Nor do I admit that the people in the rebellious States are aliens.\r\nThey are not of any other country, they are not of any other legal\r\njurisdiction, they are within the jurisdiction of the Union. Three years\r\nago they were a portion of this Union, and although they have been\r\ncarrying on a war, that war has not thus far been successful, their\r\nindependence has not been acknowledged by us, nor has it been recognized\r\nby any other nation. They, therefore, are not aliens. They are, to be\r\nsure, public enemies, but they are not alien enemies.\r\n\r\n“... These States as political organizations have by their own will\r\nceased to exist.... The existence of a State is a fact within the\r\ncontrol of the people themselves, and cannot be influenced by any\r\nextraneous power whatever, and therefore these States have by the will\r\nof the people thereof as political organizations ceased to exist.”\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the Government of the United States had legal\r\njurisdiction over this territory and over the people who occupied it, it\r\nwas an absurdity, he declared, “to say that these States still exist and\r\nthat the people there may without our consent elect officers and send\r\nRepresentatives to this body and Senators to the other branch of\r\nCongress.”\r\n\r\nTo the taunt of the Democrats that the war had been changed from a war\r\nto restore the Union to one for the purpose of emancipating the slave,\r\nMr. Boutwell replied by a denial of the fact, but added that even if it\r\nwere so, it was not the first instance of the sort in human history. Up\r\nto 1774 every American expected to preserve the old relations with\r\nEngland, yet within two years Independence was declared. The pending\r\nmeasure, he asserted, had not elicited marked attention in Congress nor\r\nany great interest throughout the country, yet in it lay the germ of a\r\nnew civilization for half a continent.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the elective franchise to white males did not meet his\r\napproval; for though the suffrage is not a natural, it is the highest\r\npolitical, right. Where the suffrage is denied to any large number of\r\nmen, that community is never free from the danger of intestine\r\ncommotion.\r\n\r\nAs South Carolina and Georgia were responsible for breathing into\r\nslavery the breath of life after it had everywhere been condemned, he\r\nwould not have them again reappear in the Union. Florida did not deserve\r\na place in the Union and, by giving the colored men local suffrage in\r\nthat district, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, he would invite the\r\nblacks thither as fast as they could be spared from the industries in\r\nwhich they were elsewhere engaged. He would not ask to extend this\r\nprinciple to loyal Northern or to border States with a negro\r\npopulation.[329]\r\n\r\nMr. Pendleton, of Ohio, made by far the ablest Democratic argument\r\nagainst the proposed enactment. Its details as well as its general\r\npolicy, he said, required examination. After stating quite fully the\r\nprovisions of the bill, he continued:\r\n\r\n  The gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Davis] facetiously entitles it “a\r\n  bill to guaranty to certain States whose governments have been\r\n  usurped or overthrown a republican form of government.”\r\n\r\n  At last the mask has been thrown off. At last the pretenses have all\r\n  been laid aside. Three years of war have done their work, and the\r\n  purposes and objects of the Republican party have been at last\r\n  acknowledged. This bill is the consummation of its statesmanship the\r\n  fruit of its experience, the demonstration of its purposes. The\r\n  gentleman from Maryland introduced it; it is understood to be\r\n  distasteful to some of his party friends; but it is a party measure;\r\n  it will be voted for by every member of the Republican organization;\r\n  it marks their policy of restoration; it defines their ideas of\r\n  Union; it interprets their construction of the Constitution. As such\r\n  I accept it. We have had double-dealing, hypocrisy and fraud for the\r\n  last three years. We have had false professions, false names, and\r\n  double-faced measures. We have had armies raised, taxes collected,\r\n  battles fought, under the pretense that the war was for the Union,\r\n  the old Union, the Union of the Constitution. These were the\r\n  catchwords for the patriotic people. In the secret council-chambers\r\n  of the party they were sneered at as devices with which to ensnare\r\n  the innocent, to deceive the ignorant, to coax the obstinate. They\r\n  were to be discarded as soon as, in the heat of war, in the\r\n  exasperation of passion, in the exultation of victory, or in the\r\n  bitterness of defeat and disaster and oppression, it would be safe\r\n  to divulge the great conspiracy against the Union, the\r\n  constitutional confederation, the principles of free government.\r\n\r\n  That time has come. The veil is drawn aside. We see clearly. The\r\n  party in possession of the powers of the Government is\r\n  revolutionary. It seeks to use those powers to destroy the\r\n  Government, to change its form, to change its spirit. It seeks under\r\n  the forms of law to make a new Government, a new Union, to ingraft\r\n  upon it new principles, new theories, and to use the powers of the\r\n  law against all who will not be persuaded. It is in rebellion\r\n  against the Constitution; it is in treasonable conspiracy against\r\n  the Government. It differs in nothing from the armed enemies except\r\n  in the weapons of its warfare. They fight to overthrow its authority\r\n  over them, while it seeks to destroy that authority at home. They\r\n  would curtail the limits of the jurisdiction of the Federal\r\n  Government; it would extend those limits, but change the basis and\r\n  principles upon which it rests. If revolt against constituted\r\n  authority be a crime, if patriotism consist in upholding in form and\r\n  spirit the Government our fathers made, those in power here to-day\r\n  are as guilty as those who in the seceded States marshal armed men\r\n  for the contest.\r\n\r\n  “Revolutions move onward.” That is true. But call things by their\r\n  true names. Admit you are in revolution; admit you are\r\n  revolutionists; admit that you do not desire to restore the old\r\n  order; admit that you do not fight to restore the Union. Take the\r\n  responsibility of that position. Avow that you exercise the powers\r\n  of the Government because you control them; that you are not bound\r\n  by the Constitution, but by your own sense of right. Avow that\r\n  resistance to your schemes is not treason, but war. Dissolve the\r\n  spell which you have woven around the hearts of our people by the\r\n  cunning use of the words conservatism, patriotism, Union. And we\r\n  will cease all criminations, we will hush all reproaches for oaths\r\n  violated, pledges falsified, faith betrayed. We will meet you on\r\n  your own ground, we will fight you with your weapons, and by the\r\n  issue of that contest, whether of argument or of arms, we will\r\n  abide.\r\n\r\n  Am I to be told that I misrepresent the Republican party? The\r\n  gentleman who has just taken his seat [Mr. Boutwell], an able and\r\n  honored member of that party, has said in your hearing, “If I could\r\n  direct the force of public sentiment and the policy of this\r\n  Government, South Carolina as a State and with a name should never\r\n  reappear in this Union. Georgia deserves a like fate. Florida does\r\n  not deserve a name in this Union.”\r\n\r\n  The gentleman from Maryland felt that this charge could be\r\n  truthfully made. He sought to answer it in advance. He denied that\r\n  the provisions of the bill contravened any clause of the\r\n  Constitution. Where is the authority for it? Where is the authority\r\n  to declare State governments overthrown? Where is the authority to\r\n  reconstruct them? Where is the authority to appoint a governor; to\r\n  call a convention to remodel their constitutions; to fix the\r\n  qualifications of its members; to prescribe the conditions of their\r\n  organic law; and until a _new_ constitution shall be made, to\r\n  administer by Federal officers such parts of the old constitution\r\n  and laws as the governor, or the President, or Congress may\r\n  select?...\r\n\r\nAt this point he quoted Madison on the guaranty clause, a subject\r\nelaborated in the Senate by Carlile, of Virginia. Mr. Pendleton observed\r\nthat if slavery, which, with one possible exception, existed in all the\r\nStates at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, was not\r\ninconsistent with a republican form of government then it was not\r\ninconsistent with it in 1864.\r\n\r\n  And yet the advocates of this bill [continued Mr. Pendleton] propose\r\n  to deprive the States of power over the question of slavery, power\r\n  over their own indebtedness, power to regulate the elective\r\n  franchise, and the right to hold office, under the pretense that\r\n  they thereby execute the provision that the United States must\r\n  guaranty a republican form of government to the States.\r\n\r\n  The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Boutwell] has shown how he\r\n  would execute it. South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida should never\r\n  again appear as State[s] or in name in this Confederation. Is their\r\n  exclusion a guarantee to them of a republican government?\r\n\r\n  ... If Congress may insist upon the three fundamental conditions\r\n  prescribed in this bill, ... by a parity of reasoning it ought to\r\n  insist upon their incorporation into the constitution of the States\r\n  remaining steadfast by the Union. If they are essential to\r\n  republicanism in the one class of States they are equally so in all.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ... Gentlemen must not palter in a double sense. These acts of\r\n  secession are either valid or they are invalid. If they are valid,\r\n  they separated the State from the Union. If they are invalid, they\r\n  are void; they have no effect; the State officers who act upon them\r\n  are rebels to the Federal Government; the States are not destroyed;\r\n  their constitutions are not abrogated; their officers are committing\r\n  illegal acts, for which they are liable to punishment; the States\r\n  have never left the Union, but so soon as their officers shall\r\n  perform their duties or other officers shall assume their places,\r\n  will again perform the duties imposed and enjoy the privileges\r\n  conferred by the Federal compact, and this not by virtue of a new\r\n  ratification of the Constitution, nor a new admission by the Federal\r\n  Government, but by virtue of the original ratification, and the\r\n  constant, uninterrupted maintenance of position in the Federal Union\r\n  since that date.\r\n\r\n  Acts of secession are not invalid to destroy the Union, and valid to\r\n  destroy the State governments and the political privileges of their\r\n  citizens. We have heard much of the two-fold relation which citizens\r\n  of the seceded States may hold to the Federal Government—that they\r\n  may be at once belligerents and rebellious citizens. I believe there\r\n  are some judicial decisions to that effect. Sir, it is impossible.\r\n  The Federal Government may possibly have the right to elect in which\r\n  relation it will deal with them; it cannot deal with them at one and\r\n  the same time in inconsistent relations. Belligerents being captured\r\n  are entitled to be treated as prisoners of war; rebellious citizens\r\n  are liable to be hanged. The private property of belligerents,\r\n  according to the rules of modern war, shall not be taken without\r\n  compensation; the property of rebellious citizens is liable to\r\n  confiscation. Belligerents are not amenable to the local criminal\r\n  law, nor to the jurisdiction of courts which administer it;\r\n  rebellious citizens are, and the officers are bound to enforce the\r\n  law, and to exact the penalty of its infraction. The seceded States\r\n  are either in the Union or out of it. If in the Union, their\r\n  constitutions are untouched, their State governments are maintained;\r\n  their citizens are entitled to all political rights, except so far\r\n  as they may be deprived of them by the criminal law which they may\r\n  have infracted. This seems incomprehensible to the gentleman from\r\n  Maryland. In his view the whole State government centers in the men\r\n  who administer it; so that when they administer it unwisely, or put\r\n  it in antagonism to the Federal Government, the State government is\r\n  dissolved, the State constitution is abrogated, and the State is\r\n  left, in fact and in form, _de jure_ and _de facto_, in anarchy,\r\n  except so far as the Federal Government may rightfully intervene.\r\n  This seems to be substantially the view of the gentleman from\r\n  Massachusetts [Mr. Boutwell]. He enforces the same position, but he\r\n  does not use the same language.\r\n\r\n  ... If by a plague or other visitation of God every officer of a\r\n  State government should at the same moment die, so that not a single\r\n  person clothed with official power should remain, would the State\r\n  government be destroyed? Not at all. For the moment it would not be\r\n  administered, but as soon as officers were elected and assumed their\r\n  respective duties it would be instantly in full force and vigor.\r\n\r\n  If these States are out of the Union their State governments are\r\n  still in force unless otherwise changed. And their citizens are to\r\n  the Federal Government as foreigners, and it has in relation to them\r\n  the same rights, and none other, as it had in relation to British\r\n  subjects in the war of 1812, or to the Mexicans in 1846. Whatever\r\n  may be the true relation of the seceded States, the Federal\r\n  Government derives no power in relation to them or their citizens\r\n  from the provision of the Constitution now under consideration, but\r\n  in the one case derives all its power from the duty of enforcing the\r\n  “Supreme law of the land;” and in the other from the power “to\r\n  declare war.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The gentleman [Mr. Davis] states his case too strongly. The duty\r\n  imposed on Congress is doubtless important, but Congress has no\r\n  right to use a means of performing it forbidden by the Constitution,\r\n  no matter how necessary or proper it might be thought to be. But,\r\n  sir, this doctrine is monstrous. It has no foundation in the\r\n  Constitution. It subjects all the States to the will of Congress; it\r\n  places their institutions at the feet of Congress. It creates in\r\n  Congress an absolute unqualified despotism. It asserts the power of\r\n  Congress in changing the State governments to be “plenary, supreme\r\n  and unlimited”—“subject only to revision by the people of the whole\r\n  United States.” The rights of the people of the State are nothing,\r\n  their will is nothing. Congress first decides, the people of the\r\n  whole Union revise. My own State of Ohio is liable at any moment to\r\n  be called in question for her constitution. She does not permit\r\n  negroes to vote.... From that decision of the Congress there is no\r\n  appeal to the people of Ohio, but only to the people of\r\n  Massachusetts, and New York, and Wisconsin, at the election of\r\n  Representatives; and if a majority cannot be elected to reverse the\r\n  decision, the people of Ohio must submit. Woe be to the day when\r\n  that doctrine shall be established, for from its centralized\r\n  despotism we will appeal to the sword!\r\n\r\nThe rights of the States, he said in conclusion, had reconciled liberty\r\nwith empire, the freedom of the individual with increase of the public\r\ndomain; by the proposed measure these were all swept instantly away. It\r\nsubstituted “despotism for self-government; despotism the more severe\r\nbecause vested in a numerous Congress elected by a people who may not\r\nfeel the exercise of its power.... It maintains integrity of territory\r\nbut destroys the rights of the citizen.” Finally he declared that he\r\npreferred separation to the unity which the bill would create.[330]\r\n\r\nDebate was concluded by Henry Winter Davis, who rose for the purpose of\r\nperfecting the pending measure by moving as a substitute a bill\r\nessentially the same as that under consideration in the House; from that\r\nplan, however, it differed in two not unimportant particulars. First, it\r\nexcluded what his friend Mr. Cox had objected to, the rule of one tenth,\r\nand required a majority to concur in forming a government. The other\r\nsoftened the operation of the clause excluding officers of the State and\r\nConfederate government, by saving merely ministerial officers and the\r\ninferior military officers; so that the exclusion merely affected\r\npersons of dangerous political influence. By an arrangement with\r\nThaddeus Stevens, instead of having a direct vote on his substitute, a\r\nportion of it was proposed as a preamble to this bill, which, of course,\r\nwould be voted on separately and take whatever fate the House might\r\nassign to it. With these observations Mr. Davis said, “I offer this as a\r\nsubstitute, and move the previous question upon it.” The substitute was\r\nagreed to, and the amendment to the preamble adopted, the preamble\r\nitself being rejected. By 73 yeas to 59 nays, the bill passed the House,\r\nMay 4, 1864.[331]\r\n\r\nThis important measure authorized the President, by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate, to appoint for each of the States declared in\r\nrebellion a provisional governor, with pay and emoluments not to exceed\r\nthat of a brigadier-general of volunteers, and who was to be charged\r\nwith the civil administration of such State until a government was\r\nrecognized as existing therein. As soon as military resistance to\r\nFederal authority had been suppressed, and the people had sufficiently\r\nreturned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws, it was\r\nmade the duty of the governor to direct the United States marshal to\r\nenroll all white male citizens of the United States, resident in the\r\nState, in their respective counties; and wherever a majority of them\r\ntook the oath of allegiance, the loyal people of the States were, by\r\nproclamation, to be invited by the governor to elect delegates to a\r\nconvention to act upon the reëstablishment of a State government, the\r\nproclamation to prescribe the details of the election. Qualified\r\nelectors in the army could vote at the headquarters of their respective\r\ncommands. No person who had held or exercised any civil, military, State\r\nor Confederate office under the rebel occupation, and who had\r\nvoluntarily borne arms against the United States, could either vote or\r\nbe eligible as a delegate. The convention was required to insert in the\r\nconstitution the following provisions:\r\n\r\n  First. No person who has held or exercised any office, civil or\r\n  military, except offices merely ministerial and military offices\r\n  below colonel, State or Confederate, under the usurping power, shall\r\n  vote for or be a member of the Legislature, or Governor.\r\n\r\n  Second. Involuntary servitude is forever prohibited, and the freedom\r\n  of all persons is guaranteed in said State.\r\n\r\n  Third. No debt, State or Confederate, created by or under the\r\n  sanction of the usurping power, shall be recognized or paid by the\r\n  State.\r\n\r\nUpon the adoption of such a constitution by the convention and its\r\nratification by the voters of the State the provisional governor should\r\nso certify to the President, who, after obtaining the assent of\r\nCongress, was empowered by proclamation to recognize the government so\r\nestablished, and none other, as the constitutional government of the\r\nState; from the date of such recognition, and not before, Senators and\r\nRepresentatives as well as electors for President and Vice-President\r\ncould be legally chosen in such State. Until reorganization the\r\nprovisional governor was to enforce the laws of the Union, and of the\r\nState before rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe remaining provisions were as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 12 declared that “all persons held to involuntary servitude or\r\nlabor in the States referred to, are emancipated and discharged\r\ntherefrom, and they and their posterity are declared to be forever free.\r\nAnd if any such persons or their posterity shall be restrained of\r\nliberty, under pretense of any claim to such service or labor, the\r\ncourts of the United States shall, on _habeas corpus_, discharge them.”\r\n\r\nSection 13 provided that “if any person declared free by this or any law\r\nof the United States, or any proclamation of the President, be\r\nrestrained of liberty; with intent to be held in or reduced to\r\ninvoluntary servitude or labor, the person convicted before a court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction of such act shall be punished by a fine of not\r\nless than $1,500, and be imprisoned not less than five nor more than\r\ntwenty years.”\r\n\r\nBy section 14 it was declared that “every person who shall hereafter\r\nhold or exercise any office, civil or military, except offices merely\r\nministerial, and military offices below the grade of colonel, in the\r\nrebel service, State or Confederate, is declared not to be a citizen of\r\nthe United States.”[332]\r\n\r\nOn the following day the proposed measure came up in the Senate, was\r\nread twice by its title and referred to the Committee on Territories. On\r\nMay 27 Mr. Wade reported the bill with amendments, and on June 30\r\nsucceeding moved to postpone all prior orders and proceed to its\r\nconsideration. His motion, however, was not agreed to, and it was not\r\ntill July 1, when the session was drawing rapidly to a close, that its\r\ndiscussion began. To save time the amendments proposed by the committee\r\nwere voted down. Senator Brown, of Missouri, believed that the subject\r\nof reconstruction could and should be postponed to a later day, and\r\noffered for the bill, by way of amendment, a substitute which declared\r\nincapable of voting “for electors of President or Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States, or of electing Senators or Representatives in Congress,”\r\nuntil the rebellion was abandoned, the inhabitants of all those States\r\nhitherto proclaimed in a state of insurrection. That question he\r\nregarded as the necessity of the hour.[333]\r\n\r\nMr. Wade hoped this amendment would not prevail; there was nothing, he\r\nasserted, in the argument that sufficient time did not remain for its\r\ncareful consideration, because it was early and thoroughly debated in\r\nthe House and had been fully discussed by the Senate Committee. It was\r\nfive months on their desks and the attention of Senators had often been\r\ncalled to it. On Republicans at least its consideration had frequently\r\nbeen urged by himself. More than ordinary care had been taken in this\r\nmatter, and if the bill was not then understood it never would be.\r\n\r\nThe question would arise in the ensuing campaign. Senators, he said, had\r\nbeen refused admission to Congress, and the principles on which they\r\nwould be received should be declared. They were announced in the bill\r\nwhich had passed the House. It protected the Government against\r\nConfederate sympathizers and guarded the interests of loyal Southerners\r\nduring the period of transition.\r\n\r\nThe status of the seceded States was a question upon which men differed\r\nwidely. It was a question to be ascertained and declared by Congress,\r\n“for the Executive ought not to be permitted to handle this great\r\nquestion to his own liking. It does not belong, under the Constitution,\r\nto the President to prescribe the rule, and it is a base abandonment of\r\nour own powers and our own duties to cast this great principle upon the\r\ndecision of the executive branch of the Government.... I know very well\r\nthat the President from the best motives undertook to fix a rule upon\r\nwhich he would admit these States back into the Union. It was not upon\r\nany principle of republicanism; it would not have guarantied to the\r\nStates a republican form of government, because he prescribed the rule\r\nto be that when one tenth of the population would take a certain oath\r\nand agree to come back into the Union they might come in as States. When\r\nwe consider that in the light of American principle, to say the least of\r\nit, it was absurd. The idea that a State shall take upon itself the\r\ngreat privilege of self-government when there are only one tenth of the\r\npeople that can stand by the principle is most anti-republican,\r\nanomalous, and entirely subversive of the great principles that underlie\r\nall our State governments and the General Government. Majorities must\r\nrule, and until majorities be found loyal and trustworthy for State\r\ngovernment, they must be governed by a stronger hand....\r\n\r\n“... I hold that once a State of this Union, always a State; that you\r\ncannot by wrong and violence displace the rights of anybody or\r\ndisorganize the State.” It was marvellous to him how gentlemen could\r\nfancy that States forfeited their rights because more or less of the\r\npeople had gone off into rebellion, and he added, “This bill proceeds\r\nupon that idea and discards absolutely the notion that States may lose\r\ntheir rights and that they may be abrogated and may be reduced to the\r\ncondition of Territories. It denies any such thing as that. No sound\r\nprinciple can be adopted that warrants any such thing.”\r\n\r\nNoticing the imposition of conditions on the admission or on the\r\nreadmission of a State, he remarked that this feature of the bill would\r\nprobably receive more criticism than any other, and declared, “that the\r\ngreat Union party of the country are altogether convinced that slavery\r\nmixed up in a Government is so unsafe, so liable to overthrow that it\r\ncannot be admitted as an element in a State government.... Therefore\r\nthis bill has taken special pains to say that the new government shall,\r\nin its constitution, proclaim emancipation as a condition upon which it\r\nshall be permitted to come into the Union.” There was a time, he\r\nadmitted, when it would have been deemed unconstitutional in Congress to\r\nprescribe any particular principle for a constitution when a State was\r\nseeking to come into the Union. “We have done so, however,” he asserted,\r\n“in every State that we have ever admitted,” and yet perhaps the\r\nquestion was never entirely settled. “Would it be wise for us,” he\r\nasked, “in admitting States back into this Union to permit them to come\r\nwith the very element that carried them out, with the very seeds of\r\ndestruction which had destroyed them already? The framers of this bill,”\r\nhe continued, “have sedulously shut it out, and made it a condition on\r\nwhich the seceded States shall come back that it shall be a fundamental\r\nprinciple of their constitution that slavery is excluded.”\r\n\r\nThe amendment of Senator Brown he characterized as a bare negative; it\r\ndid not inform the people of the seceded States upon what principle they\r\nwere to be again admitted into the Union.[334]\r\n\r\nMr. Carlile, of Virginia, observed on entering into the discussion that\r\neverything the bill proposed to do in the way of remedying existing\r\nevils would be accomplished by adopting the amendment offered by the\r\nSenator from Missouri. The provisions of the bill were not to be\r\nenforced and were not to have any life until after the suppression of\r\nthe rebellion, and, therefore, there could be no pressing necessity for\r\naction at that time, when a large majority of Senators expected in three\r\nor four days to leave Washington for their homes. Senator Wade\r\ninterrupted him to point out that there was provided a military governor\r\nwhose duties could be performed in any stage of the rebellion, from the\r\ntime Federal forces obtained a foothold in any State until it was in the\r\nUnion again. The Virginia Senator agreed with Mr. Wade as to the extent\r\nof the President’s power in the matter, and in the belief that once a\r\nState in the Union always a State; but the bill, he said, not only\r\nmaintained that State governments were overthrown, but so far as it\r\ncould do so, recognized and assumed the right to overthrow the State\r\ngovernments if that work was not already accomplished. If the President\r\nhad not the right to prescribe rules for the return of rebellious\r\nStates, where was the constitutional provision which authorized Congress\r\nto do so? The title of the bill was an insult, he declared, to the\r\nunderstanding of every enlightened man in the nation and the bill itself\r\none of the most revolutionary that ever was proposed in a deliberative\r\nbody claiming to be the representatives of a free people.\r\n\r\nThe question mooted in Congress forty years before, he continued, was\r\ninsignificant compared to the present. That was a proposition to impose\r\nupon the inhabitants of a Territory seeking admission into the Union a\r\nrestriction upon their right of self-government when they became a\r\nState. After one of the most exhaustive and learned debates that ever\r\ngraced the Capitol of the nation that assumption for Congress was\r\nabandoned. It was permitted to rest as the settled law of the land that\r\nCongress had no power to impose limitations affecting the right of the\r\npeople of a State to regulate their own domestic affairs, even when\r\nsought to be applied to the inhabitants of a Territory seeking admission\r\nto the Union. This continued the settled action of Congress until\r\nreversed at the preceding session by assuming to create an independent\r\nState out of a portion of the Commonwealth which he represented.\r\n\r\n“No State can have a Republican form of government,” he declared, “no\r\nState has a republican government, when that government, no matter what\r\nare its provisions, is prescribed to them by another outside of their\r\nlimits. A republican form of government must emanate and emanate alone\r\nfrom the people that are to be governed. It belongs not to the Congress\r\nof the United States; it belongs not to the thirty-three States of this\r\nUnion to prescribe for the smallest State within its folds a\r\nconstitution or form of government. If you have a right to impose a\r\nlimitation upon this power as to one subject of domestic legislation you\r\nhave a right to impose it upon every subject. If you have a right to\r\nmake one provision of a constitution for a people you have the right to\r\nmake the entire instrument itself.”\r\n\r\nAn interruption of his argument by Mr. Wade drew from the Virginia\r\nSenator a query rather embarrassing to the Ohio statesman. “Where,”\r\nasked Carlile, “does the Senator derive the power to appoint a governor\r\nfor a State, a State which he acknowledges to be in existence, a State\r\ngovernment that he acknowledges to be in existence, a State government\r\nthat he acknowledges it to be his duty to protect and maintain? By what\r\nprovision of the Constitution does the Senator derive the authority to\r\nappoint for such a State an executive head?” Mr. Wade replied that when\r\nthe Constitution imposed the duty of guaranteeing a republican form of\r\ngovernment it conferred the power to do so, and he in turn inquired, “Is\r\nnot that good law?” “No, sir,” answered Carlile, who proceeded: “Now,\r\nMr. President, I will satisfy the Senator himself, I think; and really\r\nit is not necessary for me to attempt to satisfy him, for he is too good\r\na lawyer not to know the meaning of the word ‘guaranty.’ What is it?\r\nDoes the authority to ‘guaranty to each State in this Union a republican\r\nform of government’ authorize this Union to set up a government, to\r\ncreate a government, or to make a government? Is the maker of a note the\r\nman who guaranties its payment? There is no man in the Senate who knows\r\nbetter the definition and legal significance of the word ‘guaranty’ than\r\nthe Senator from Ohio, and none, I am sure, is more familiar, too, with\r\nthe power that was intended to be conferred by this provision of the\r\nConstitution.” After admitting that he would bring the power of the\r\nGovernment to bear on a faction who undertook to establish a monarchical\r\nform of government, Mr. Wade put this hypothetical case: “Suppose now\r\nthat we have conquered them and the people are still bent on their\r\nmonarchy, shall we not guaranty a republican government to them by\r\nputting one over them?” “If the Senator be right,” answered Carlile,\r\n“Mr. Madison, the author of the Constitution, was wrong.” He then quoted\r\nfrom the forty-third number of the Federalist:\r\n\r\n  “To guaranty to every State in the Union a republican form of\r\n  government; to protect each of them against invasion; and on\r\n  application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the\r\n  Legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.”\r\n\r\n  In a confederacy founded on republican principles and composed of\r\n  republican members, the superintending government ought clearly to\r\n  possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or\r\n  monarchical innovations.\r\n\r\n“The very case put by Senator Wade,” observed Carlile; “and how it is to\r\nbe done is stated:”\r\n\r\n  The more intimate the nature of such a Union may be, the greater\r\n  interest have the members in the political institutions of each\r\n  other; and the greater right to insist that the forms of government\r\n  under which the compact was entered into should be _substantially_\r\n  maintained.... It may possibly be asked, what need there could be of\r\n  such a precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for\r\n  alterations in the State governments, without the concurrence of the\r\n  States themselves. These questions admit of ready answers. If the\r\n  interposition of the General Government should not be needed, the\r\n  provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in\r\n  the Constitution. But who can say what experiments can be produced\r\n  by the caprice of particular States, by the ambition of enterprising\r\n  leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers? To the\r\n  second question it may be answered that if the General Government\r\n  should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority, it will\r\n  be, of course, bound to pursue the authority. But the authority\r\n  extends no further than to a _guaranty_ of a republican form of\r\n  government, which supposes a _preëxisting government_ of the form\r\n  which is to be guarantied.\r\n\r\nSustained in his position by Madison’s commentary Carlile resumed: “Now,\r\nsir, is the Senator answered?... It is not claimed or pretended, I\r\nsuppose, by the Senator from Ohio, or by any advocate of this bill, that\r\nunder any other provision of the Constitution can a pretext be afforded\r\nfor the assertion of such a power as this bill proposes to assert.” To\r\nSenator Wilkinson’s inquiry, what would the Government of the United\r\nStates do if the people of South Carolina determined that they would not\r\nhave a republican form of government in that State, the Virginia Senator\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“I would have the Government of the United States do nothing that it has\r\nnot the power under the Constitution to do, because I believe that the\r\nGovernment of the United States is a Government of limited powers. I\r\nbelieve it to be its duty under the grant of power in the Constitution\r\nto guaranty the existence of a preëxisting republican government. That\r\ngovernment existed in South Carolina; the people have not determined, at\r\nleast before this war they had not determined, to have any other than a\r\nrepublican form of government. We had recognized that government as a\r\nrepublican form of government by the recognition of the State in all its\r\ndepartments and the admission of all its national representatives. It is\r\nmade the duty of the Government of the United States, not of Congress;\r\nand I desire to call the attention of the Senator to that, because it\r\nbears upon his assumption for Congress of power which does not belong to\r\nthe Executive. It is not alone the duty of Congress to guaranty a\r\nrepublican form of government to the people of the several States; the\r\nextent of that guarantee is not limited alone to the means which\r\nCongress may employ; but the words of the Constitution are ‘the United\r\nStates shall guaranty.’ Hence every department of the Government is\r\nequally bound; and Congress being the legislative branch of course\r\nparticipates to a greater extent in the discharge of that duty.”\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion with Mr. Clark, Carlile proceeded in his argument:\r\n“But, sir, the Senator from Ohio says the Union is to be preserved. So\r\nsay I. Upon what principle are these States to come back into the Union?\r\nThe people, says the Senator from Ohio, will meet you with that inquiry.\r\nSir, when was ever such an inquiry suggested to the brain of any loyal\r\nman in this Union? When was such an inquiry ever put? Never until after\r\na policy different from that which characterized the commencement of\r\nthis struggle was entered upon by the party in power. All said the Union\r\nwas to be restored; all accepted the struggle as the use of the military\r\npower of the Government in the restoration of the Union. What Union? The\r\nUnion of the Constitution. The Union into which new States are to be\r\nadmitted. It is not into ‘a Union’ but into ‘this Union’ that the States\r\nare admitted. What Union? The Union of the Constitution, none other; and\r\nhe who seeks to preserve the Union can only do it by an observance of\r\nthe Constitution and of the constitutional means to restore it, not\r\nreconstruct it.\r\n\r\n“... In this Union, created by this Constitution, of limited and\r\ndelegated powers, all prescribed and written in the instrument, you\r\npropose to exercise your legislative power by usurping the rights and\r\nliberties of the people, a power which all the people you represent\r\ncould not use or could not exert without the destruction of the Union\r\nwhich the Constitution formed. There is no power in this Government,\r\nthere is no power in the parties to this Government, there is no power\r\nin all the States of this Union to prescribe a constitution for the\r\nlittle State of Rhode Island. If every other State in the Union, the\r\nadhering as well as the rebellious States, if every man, woman, and\r\nchild in them were to meet and prescribe a constitution for the people\r\nof Rhode Island, they would have no power or authority to do so under\r\nthe Union; and tell me where the people’s representatives derive the\r\npower to do that which all the people in their collective capacity, save\r\nthe small minority which constitutes that State, cannot do?”[335]\r\n\r\nMr. Carlile emphasized the fact that the bill under consideration was\r\nnot a war measure. In a running argument with several Senators he showed\r\nboth a ready and comprehensive knowledge of the Constitution and made\r\nsome telling points against the bill as well as against the radical\r\ntendencies in Congress. His speech was, perhaps, the very ablest\r\ndelivered by any Senator in opposition to the proposed measure. At its\r\nconclusion Mr. Brown’s amendment was agreed to.\r\n\r\nAn amendment offered by Charles Sumner to enact the Emancipation\r\nProclamation into a law was rejected by a vote of 21 to 11. The\r\nMassachusetts statesman did not wish, he said, to see the edict of\r\nfreedom “left to float on a Presidential proclamation.”[336]\r\n\r\nThe bill concerning States in insurrection against the United States\r\nthen passed the Senate by 26 yeas to 3 nays.[337] When the vote was\r\ntaken 20 Senators were absent. On the succeeding day, July 2, 1864, a\r\nmessage announced the disagreement of the House to the Senate amendment\r\nand requested a committee of conference. A subsequent motion of Mr. Wade\r\nthat the Senate recede from its amendment and agree to the bill of the\r\nHouse was carried after some discussion by a vote of 18 to 14, thus\r\npassing the bill on the same day.[338] The names of Doolittle,\r\nHenderson, Ten Eyck and Trumbull voting with the Democrats in opposition\r\nforeshadowed that division in the Republican ranks which afterwards\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe history of this famous bill from the moment of its passage by\r\nCongress until the publication a week later of the President’s\r\nproclamation concerning it is best related in the Life of Mr. Lincoln by\r\nhis private secretaries, Messrs. Nicolay and Hay. These writers\r\npossessed an unusual opportunity for ascertaining the sentiments of the\r\nPresident upon nearly every question of public interest.\r\n\r\n“Congress,” says the diary of Mr. Hay, “was to adjourn at noon on the\r\nFourth of July; the President was in his room at the Capitol signing\r\nbills, which were laid before him as they were brought from the two\r\nHouses. When this important bill was placed before him he laid it aside\r\nand went on with the other work of the moment. Several prominent members\r\nentered in a state of intense anxiety over the fate of the bill. Mr.\r\nSumner and Mr. Boutwell, while their nervousness was evident, refrained\r\nfrom any comment. Zachariah Chandler, who was unabashed in any mortal\r\npresence, roundly asked the President if he intended to sign the bill.\r\nThe President replied: ‘This bill has been placed before me a few\r\nmoments before Congress adjourns. It is a matter of too much importance\r\nto be swallowed in that way.’ ‘If it is vetoed,’ cried Mr. Chandler, ‘it\r\nwill damage us fearfully in the Northwest. The important point is that\r\none prohibiting slavery in the reconstructed States.’ Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n‘That is the point on which I doubt the authority of Congress to act.’\r\n‘It is no more than you have done yourself,’ said the Senator. The\r\nPresident answered: ‘I conceive that I may in an emergency do things on\r\nmilitary grounds which cannot be done constitutionally by Congress.’ Mr.\r\nChandler, expressing his deep chagrin, went out, and the President,\r\naddressing the members of the Cabinet who were seated with him, said: ‘I\r\ndo not see how any of us now can deny and contradict what we have always\r\nsaid, that Congress has no constitutional power over slavery in the\r\nStates.’ Mr. Fessenden expressed his entire agreement with this view. ‘I\r\nhave even had my doubts,’ he said, ‘as to the constitutional efficacy of\r\nyour own decree of emancipation, in those cases where it has not been\r\ncarried into effect by the actual advance of the army.’\r\n\r\n“The President said: ‘This bill and the position of these gentlemen seem\r\nto me, in asserting that the insurrectionary States are no longer in the\r\nUnion, to make the fatal admission that States, whenever they please,\r\nmay of their own motion dissolve their connection with the Union. Now we\r\ncannot survive that admission, I am convinced. If that be true, I am not\r\nPresident; these gentlemen are not Congress. I have laboriously\r\nendeavored to avoid that question ever since it first began to be\r\nmooted, and thus to avoid confusion and disturbance in our own councils.\r\nIt was to obviate this question that I earnestly favored the movement\r\nfor an amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery, which passed\r\nthe Senate and failed in the House. I thought it much better, if it were\r\npossible, to restore the Union without the necessity of a violent\r\nquarrel among its friends as to whether certain States have been in or\r\nout of the Union during the war—a merely metaphysical question, and one\r\nunnecessary to be forced into discussion.’\r\n\r\n“Although every member of the Cabinet agreed with the President, when, a\r\nfew minutes later, he entered his carriage to go home, he foresaw the\r\nimportance of the step he had resolved to take and its possibly\r\ndisastrous consequences to himself. When some one said to him that the\r\nthreats made by the extreme radicals had no foundation, and that people\r\nwould not bolt their ticket on a question of metaphysics, he answered:\r\n‘If they choose to make a point upon this, I do not doubt that they can\r\ndo harm. They have never been friendly to me. At all events, I must keep\r\nsome consciousness of being somewhere near right. I must keep some\r\nstandard or principle fixed within myself.’”[339]\r\n\r\nA perusal of the preceding abridgment of debates shows clearly that the\r\nbill was designed by Congress as a measure of reconstruction and\r\nintended by many of its leading advocates as a rebuke of the President.\r\nHe was not, however, a statesman whom even the deliberate censure of a\r\ncoördinate branch of Government could hurry into an act of rashness; he\r\nhad never been precipitate; indeed, the burden of radical criticism was\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln was provokingly slow. This was the opinion which\r\nCharles Sumner expressed in confidential correspondence with his English\r\nfriends[340] and which Secretary Chase entered in the pages of his\r\ndiary.[341] The President was, it is true, the most cautious of men, and\r\nthe fact goes far to explain the absence during his eventful\r\nadministration of even a single serious blunder; the discovery of a\r\ngross error of judgment seldom or never rewarded the researches of his\r\nablest critics. Though his modesty was scarcely less than his prudence,\r\nhe entertained a just conception of the dignity of his office; long\r\nreflection upon constitutional questions, which made him familiar with\r\nthe extent of executive power, taught him likewise to recognize those\r\nlimitations which the fundamental law had imposed upon legislative\r\naction. Another characteristic which made him a formidable adversary in\r\nevery controversy was a constant purpose to be always, as he expressed\r\nit himself, “somewhere near right.”\r\n\r\nThe measure had been so long under consideration that none of its\r\nprovisions could have taken him by surprise, and we are justified in\r\nconcluding that when the bill was presented for his approval he had\r\nalready determined on his course of action. Indeed there is evidence\r\nthat some of his supporters in Congress had written to their friends in\r\nLouisiana predicting the very fate that afterward befell the bill. Their\r\noutline of the President’s course admits of no other explanation than\r\nthat he had communicated to them his intentions respecting it. The\r\nprogress of the measure in the Senate was to be so retarded that the\r\nadjournment of Congress would relieve him of the necessity of exercising\r\nthe veto, and that is precisely what happened. In the very last hour of\r\nthe session it was submitted for his approval; his disposal of the bill\r\non that occasion has already been noticed; his approval was withheld and\r\nCongress rose before the expiration of the ten days which would enact\r\nthe bill into a law without his signature. Though an interested view had\r\nnot been overlooked, he disregarded in discharge of his duty every\r\npersonal consequence of the important step which he purposed to take.\r\nHis hostility to the measure had long been suspected, but when knowledge\r\nof his failure to approve it had become a certainty the anger of the\r\nmore radical members of his party became extreme. They had clearly been\r\noutwitted by the President and many of them, eager for retaliation,\r\nreturned to their homes meditating schemes of revenge.\r\n\r\nFor the present, at least, anything like adequate discipline of Mr.\r\nLincoln was not within their power, for the Baltimore convention, which\r\nrenominated him for the Presidency, had adjourned nearly a month before.\r\nThis at least was secure. His election, though not entirely a foregone\r\nconclusion, was reasonably assured; few of the discomfited members even\r\nimagined the thought of injuring their party to embarrass the President.\r\nIt is easy to believe, however, that they intended such criticism of his\r\npolicy as would be consistent with party success. But even here he\r\nresolved to dispute with them a field of operations which they believed\r\nentirely their own. The President, it is true, could not, even if so\r\ninclined, justify his conduct in person before the voters of every State\r\nin the Union; he could, however, and did forestall expected criticism\r\nfrom Congressmen by publishing a proclamation vindicating his “pocket”\r\nveto, thus destroying whatever hope remained to radical Republicans of\r\ndiminishing his popularity by ascribing to him base or selfish motives\r\nfor opposing the sense of the Legislative department of Government. As\r\non other critical occasions so on this he found no precedent to guide\r\nhim, but with characteristic firmness proceeded deliberately to\r\nestablish one. When some of the Congressmen reached their States they\r\nfound their constituents already pondering the proclamation of July 8,\r\n1864. Its importance requires that it be quoted in full:\r\n\r\n  Whereas, at the late session, Congress passed a bill to “guarantee\r\n  to certain States, whose governments have been usurped or\r\n  overthrown, a republican form of government,” a copy of which is\r\n  hereunto annexed;\r\n\r\n  And whereas the said bill was presented to the President of the\r\n  United States for his approval less than one hour before the _sine\r\n  die_ adjournment of said session, and was not signed by him;\r\n\r\n  And whereas the said bill contains, among other things, a plan for\r\n  restoring the States in rebellion to their proper practical relation\r\n  in the Union, which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that\r\n  subject, and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the\r\n  people for their consideration:\r\n\r\n  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,\r\n  do proclaim, declare, and make known, that, while I am (as I was in\r\n  December last, when by proclamation I propounded a plan for\r\n  restoration) unprepared, by a formal approval of this bill, to be\r\n  inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration; and, while I\r\n  am also unprepared to declare that the free-State constitutions and\r\n  governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana\r\n  shall be set aside and held for naught, thereby repelling and\r\n  discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to\r\n  further effort, or to declare a constitutional competency in\r\n  Congress to abolish slavery in States, but am at the same time\r\n  sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment\r\n  abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted,\r\n  nevertheless I am fully satisfied with the system for restoration\r\n  contained in the bill as one very proper plan for the loyal people\r\n  of any State choosing to adopt it, and that I am, and at all times\r\n  shall be, prepared to give the Executive aid and assistance to such\r\n  people, so soon as the military resistance to the United States\r\n  shall have been suppressed in any such State, and the people thereof\r\n  shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the\r\n  Constitution and laws of the United States, in which cases Military\r\n  Governors will be appointed, with directions to proceed according to\r\n  the bill.[342]\r\n\r\nThis unexpected publication was very differently received by the various\r\nelements composing the Republican party; a large majority of those\r\nacting with that organization still confided in Mr. Lincoln; by the\r\nradical wing, however, he was sharply censured. Notwithstanding the\r\nnecessity for harmony in the approaching campaign two of the boldest\r\nleaders, disregarding every consideration of prudence, arraigned the\r\nPresident in language which for severity was never surpassed by the\r\ninvectives of his ablest political opponents. In the entire experience\r\nof the Republic no Executive had ever assumed to reject those provisions\r\nin a legislative measure which he disliked and adopt those that were\r\nacceptable. This is precisely what Mr. Lincoln did, and the reasons for\r\nhis action he declared to the people with a confidence which forcibly\r\nrecalls the direction of Andrew Jackson to the editor of his official\r\norgan: “Speak out to the people, sir, and tell them that instead of\r\nsupporting me and my policy Congress is engaged in President-making.”\r\nThere was, however, this difference: Abraham Lincoln addressed the\r\npeople directly and ventured no criticism of their representatives. Like\r\nhis more impulsive though not less popular predecessor he was not\r\ndeceived in the reliance which he placed in the patriotic instincts of\r\nthe multitude, which cared little for nice metaphysical distinctions; by\r\nthe masses of the people he was trusted to the end.\r\n\r\nBy Henry Winter Davis and Benjamin F. Wade, chief authors of the bill,\r\nits progress had been watched with feverish anxiety; when convinced that\r\ntheir labor was lost they became greatly agitated and made no effort to\r\nconceal their indignation at the conduct of the President. Their joint\r\nprotest, printed in the _New York Tribune_ of August 5, was, perhaps,\r\nthe most bitter attack made upon Mr. Lincoln during his Presidential\r\ncareer. Their fierce manifesto, addressed “To the supporters of the\r\nGovernment,” declares that the writers had “read without surprise, but\r\nnot without indignation, the proclamation of the President of the 8th of\r\nJuly, 1864.\r\n\r\n“The supporters of the Administration are responsible to the country for\r\nits conduct; and it is their right and duty to check the encroachments\r\nof the Executive on the authority of Congress, and to require it to\r\nconfine itself to its proper sphere.”\r\n\r\nThe paper then related the history of the bill. Its treatment by the\r\nPresident, they declared, indicated a persistent though unavowed purpose\r\nto defeat the will of the people by the Executive perversion of the\r\nConstitution. They insinuated that only the lowest personal motives\r\ncould have dictated this action. “The President,” they said, “by\r\npreventing this bill from becoming a law, holds the electoral votes of\r\nthe rebel States at the dictation of his personal ambition.\r\n\r\n“If those votes turn the balance in his favor, is it to be supposed that\r\nhis competitor, defeated by such means, will acquiesce?\r\n\r\n“If the rebel majority assert their supremacy in those States, and send\r\nvotes which elect an enemy of the Government, will we not repel his\r\nclaims?\r\n\r\n“And is not that civil war for the Presidency inaugurated by the votes\r\nof the rebel States?\r\n\r\n“Seriously impressed with these dangers, Congress, ‘_the proper\r\nconstitutional authority_,’ formally declared that there are no State\r\ngovernments in the rebel States, and provided for their erection at a\r\nproper time; and both the Senate and the House of Representatives\r\nrejected the Senators and Representatives chosen under the authority of\r\nwhat the President calls the free constitution and government of\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\n“The President’s proclamation ‘holds for naught’ this judgment, and\r\ndiscards the authority of the Supreme Court, and strides headlong toward\r\nthe anarchy his proclamation of the 8th of December inaugurated.\r\n\r\n“If electors for President be allowed to be chosen in either of those\r\nStates, a sinister light will be cast on the motives which induced the\r\nPresident to ‘hold for naught’ the will of Congress rather than his\r\ngovernment in Louisiana and Arkansas.\r\n\r\n“The judgment of Congress which the President defies was the exercise of\r\nan authority exclusively vested in Congress by the Constitution, to\r\ndetermine what is the established government in a State, and in its own\r\nnature and by the highest judicial authority binding on all other\r\ndepartments of the Government.”\r\n\r\nThey ridiculed the President’s expressed hope that the constitutional\r\namendment abolishing slavery might be adopted. “We curiously inquire,”\r\ncontinue Messrs. Wade and Davis, “on what his expectation rests, after\r\nthe vote of the House of Representatives at the recent session, and in\r\nthe face of the political complexion of more than enough of the States\r\nto prevent the possibility of its adoption within any reasonable time;\r\nand why he did not indulge his sincere hopes with so large an\r\ninstallment of the blessing as his approval of the bill would have\r\nsecured?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A more studied outrage on the legislative authority of the people has\r\nnever been perpetrated.\r\n\r\n“Congress passed a bill; the President refused to approve it, and then\r\nby proclamation puts as much of it in force as he sees fit, and proposes\r\nto execute those parts by officers unknown to the laws of the United\r\nStates, and not subject to the confirmation of the Senate.\r\n\r\n“The bill directed the appointment of provisional governors by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n“The President, after defeating the law, proposes to appoint, without\r\nlaw and without the advice and consent of the Senate, military governors\r\nfor the rebel States!\r\n\r\n“He has already exercised this dictatorial usurpation in Louisiana, and\r\ndefeated the bill to prevent its limitation.”\r\n\r\nScarcely an expression of the proclamation, which was examined in\r\ndetail, escaped its share of censure or of ridicule. To suppose that the\r\nPresident was ignorant of the contents of the bill was out of the\r\nquestion, for it had been discussed, they asserted, during more than a\r\nmonth in the House of Representatives, by which it was passed as early\r\nas the 4th of May. It passed the Senate in absolutely the form in which\r\nit came from the House. Indeed, at the President’s request, a draft of a\r\nbill substantially the same in material points, and almost identical in\r\nthose features objected to by the proclamation, was submitted for his\r\nconsideration during the winter of 1862–1863.\r\n\r\nThe “Protest” included also a sharp contrast between the Executive plan\r\nof December 8, 1863, and that embodied in the bill which had passed\r\nCongress. That measure, said Messrs. Wade and Davis, required a majority\r\nof the voters to establish a State government, the proclamation was\r\nsatisfied with one tenth; “the bill requires one oath, the proclamation\r\nanother; the bill ascertains voters by registering, the proclamation by\r\nguess; the bill exacts adherence to existing territorial limits, the\r\nproclamation admits of others; the bill governs the rebel States _by\r\nlaw_, equalizing all before it, the proclamation commits them to the\r\nlawless discretion of military governors and provost marshals; the bill\r\nforbids electors for President (in the rebel States), the proclamation\r\nand defeat of the bill threaten us with civil war for the admission or\r\nexclusion of such votes....”\r\n\r\nThis arraignment of the President’s course concluded with the language\r\nof admonition, if not indeed of absolute menace: “The President has\r\ngreatly presumed on the forbearance which the supporters of his\r\nAdministration have so long practised, in view of the arduous conflict\r\nin which we are engaged, and the reckless ferocity of our political\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n“But he must understand that our support is of a cause, and not of a\r\nman; that the authority of Congress is paramount and must be respected;\r\nthat the whole body of the Union men of Congress will not submit to be\r\nimpeached by him of rash and unconstitutional legislation; and if he\r\nwishes our support, he must confine himself to his Executive duties,—to\r\nobey and execute, not make the laws,—to suppress by arms armed\r\nrebellion, and leave political reorganization to Congress.\r\n\r\n“If the supporters of the Government fail to insist on this, they become\r\nresponsible for the usurpations which they fail to rebuke, and are\r\njustly liable to the indignation of the people whose rights and\r\nsecurity, committed to their keeping, they sacrifice.\r\n\r\n“Let them consider the remedy for these usurpations, and, having found\r\nit, fearlessly execute it.”[343]\r\n\r\nThe authors of this remarkable paper were eminent in the councils of\r\ntheir party and stood high in the estimation of Union men everywhere.\r\nSenator Wade was distinguished no less for his physical than for his\r\nmoral courage—qualities impaired somewhat, it is true, by a temper\r\nfierce and vindictive. Henry Winter Davis, whose zeal for civil liberty\r\nwill constitute his best claim to the gratitude of posterity, possessed\r\nliterary gifts scarcely surpassed by any statesman then in public life.\r\nThough treated with extreme fairness, not to say generosity, by the\r\nPresident, he pursued toward the Administration a course of consistent\r\nhostility. This opposition, which even Mr. Lincoln’s tact could never\r\ndisarm, has been ascribed to disappointment at his failure to obtain a\r\nplace in the Cabinet. While the selection of Montgomery Blair from his\r\nown State of Maryland may have been a cause of estrangement, a sense of\r\nwhat Mr. Davis regarded as public duty contributed, doubtless, to\r\nintensify this feeling, which led him ultimately to think the President\r\nscarcely entitled to courteous treatment. With the Ohio Senator the\r\npitiless maxim, _vae victis_, had an undoubted influence. Both were\r\ngentlemen of wide experience and acknowledged ability, and yet their\r\nvigorous and fearless arraignment of the President revealed an\r\nastonishing lack of political sagacity. They inquired, for example, on\r\nwhat foundation he rested his expectation of an adoption of the\r\nconstitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The incorporation, soon\r\nafter, of such a provision in the fundamental law shows their want of\r\ninsight into the tendencies of the times. The fire of the prophet,\r\nindeed, was present in the protest; his inspiration was altogether\r\nwanting. Their absurd assertion that the electoral votes of Louisiana,\r\nArkansas and Tennessee were the prime consideration with the President\r\nmust be attributed to the passion rather than to the reason of his\r\ncritics, for few men of that generation were more familiar with the\r\nConstitution in all its relations. Better than most of their readers\r\nthey knew that the duty of counting such votes was entrusted not to a\r\npossibly interested Executive, but to a joint convention of both Houses.\r\nIf the Maryland member believed the President had committed the\r\nmisdemeanors charged and insinuated it was his duty to bring before the\r\nHouse the question of impeachment. Far less than was expressed in the\r\nprotest would have been ground for investigation. If tenderness to\r\nLincoln, a weakness of which Mr. Davis at least was never suspected, or\r\na concern for party welfare prevented such a step, then he was himself\r\nguilty of a gross neglect of duty. Doubtless this consideration,\r\ntogether with the want of moderation shown in the manifesto, subjected\r\nits authors to a suspicion of insincerity. Indeed, one does not read a\r\ndozen lines of their arraignment without discovering the chief if not\r\nthe sole cause of its publication. “The President,” they say, “did not\r\nsign the bill ‘to guarantee to certain States whose governments have\r\nbeen usurped, a republican form of government’—passed by the supporters\r\nof his Administration in both Houses of Congress after mature\r\ndeliberation.” In brief, the political departments of Government had\r\nentered upon a struggle for power; Congress had been defeated, and its\r\ndiscomfited leaders sought to relieve their feelings by railing at the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nExcept that it probably defeated the renomination of Mr. Davis for\r\nCongress, their protest was followed by no political result of\r\nmoment.[344] In it the mass of Republicans perceived only the seeds of\r\ndissension within their ranks. In this view it was a source of delight\r\nto Democrats, though they felt little sympathy with either the defeated\r\nbill or the purposes of its chief authors.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  See p. 23, _ante_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 310:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 1 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 1 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  Appendix, Part IV., Globe, 1 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 82–85; also\r\n  Speeches and Addresses of Henry Winter Davis.

In the struggle for power\r\nhe had refrained with his usual prudence from improving his advantage\r\nover the Legislative department. The annual message omitted all\r\nreference to the controversy occasioned by his failure to sign, and his\r\nproclamation concerning, the bill of Messrs. Wade and Davis; the\r\nquestion of reconstruction was noticed in only the most casual manner. A\r\nstatement of the satisfactory condition of foreign relations introduced\r\nthe Executive communication; the subject of finance received the\r\nconsideration that its importance required. The vast proportions and the\r\nefficient state of the navy were mentioned as matter of congratulation.\r\nGeneral Sherman’s projected march of three hundred miles through hostile\r\nregions was characterized as the most remarkable feature in the military\r\noperations of the year. This with other evidences of approaching\r\ndisruption in the Confederacy led logically to a summary of what had\r\nbeen accomplished toward reorganization in those States already wrested\r\nfrom insurgent armies. On this subject the message observed: “Important\r\nmovements have also occurred during the year to the effect of molding\r\nsociety for durability in the Union. Although short of complete success,\r\nit is much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each\r\nof the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State\r\ngovernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to\r\nmaintain and administer them.”[345] Movements in the same direction, he\r\nsaid, more extensive though less definite, were in progress elsewhere\r\nand should not be overlooked. No plan of reconstruction was proposed, or\r\neven alluded to in the message.\r\n\r\nAmong questions beyond Executive authority to adjust was specified the\r\nadmission of members to Congress. In disclaiming power over this subject\r\nhe anticipated the criticism of those Senators and Representatives who\r\nlater in the session ascribed to him a design to usurp important\r\nfunctions of the Legislative branch of Government.\r\n\r\nFrom its concluding paragraphs we are enabled to collect the sentiments\r\nof the President relative to his offer, a year before, of a general\r\npardon to designated classes upon specified terms. In this connection he\r\nsaid: “But the time may come—probably will come—when public duty shall\r\ndemand that it [the door open to repentant rebels] be closed; and that,\r\nin lieu, more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted.” This\r\nseems to establish beyond question the fact that Mr. Lincoln feared some\r\nmeasures more stringent than he had been hitherto pursuing might be\r\nrendered necessary by the failure of a policy of clemency to recall any\r\nlarge number of insurgents to their obedience to the Constitution and\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\nHe ventured to recommend a reconsideration of the proposed\r\nconstitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the United\r\nStates, which at the preceding session had passed the Senate, but failed\r\nto receive in the House the requisite two thirds vote. Though the\r\npresent, he reminded them, was the same Congress and composed of nearly\r\nthe same members, their judgments were, no doubt, influenced by an\r\nintervening election, which, though it imposed on them no obligation to\r\nchange their views, made it reasonably certain that if they did not\r\nsubmit the amendment to the States the succeeding Congress would. He\r\ninquired, since its passage was merely a question of time, whether they\r\nwould not agree that the sooner the better? The voice of the people, he\r\nadded, had for the first time been heard on that question.[346]\r\n\r\nAs the President believed, the House had been so far converted to his\r\nviews that a joint resolution adopting the amendment was passed early in\r\nthe session by a vote of 119 to 56.[347]\r\n\r\nWhen Congress assembled the public was occupied chiefly in watching the\r\nprogress of naval and military operations. The sinking of the _Alabama_\r\nand the capture of the _Florida_ practically ended Confederate\r\nprivateering, for any expectations based upon the escape of the\r\n_Albemarle_ were frustrated by the enterprise and daring of Lieutenant\r\nCushing. One army had been destroyed by Sheridan, another crippled by\r\nThomas. Tidings of telling blows inflicted by General Sherman gave\r\nsomething like assurance of his safety. Though not without heavy loss,\r\nGrant had forced Lee within the defences of Richmond and Petersburg.\r\nSome of the lesser Union advantages had, it is true, been offset by\r\nSouthern victories; signs of disintegration within the Confederacy,\r\nhowever, were multiplying, and this condition forced upon Congress the\r\ninevitable question of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nBy unanimous consent of the House Thaddeus Stevens, on December 8,\r\noffered resolutions distributing the President’s message. To the\r\nCommittee on the Rebellious States was referred so much of it as was\r\nalleged to relate “to the duty of the United States to guaranty a\r\nrepublican form of government to the States in which the governments\r\nrecognized by the United States have been abrogated or overthrown.”[348]\r\n\r\nNothing whatever in the message or the accompanying documents related to\r\nany such duty on the part of the United States, and the resolution\r\nassumed such a recommendation, no doubt, for the purpose of bringing the\r\nsubject before Congress. One week later, Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, reported a\r\nbill, on the subject of Stevens’s resolution, which was read twice,\r\nordered to be printed and returned to the Committee. On January 12\r\nsucceeding Representative Eliot, of Massachusetts, gave notice of his\r\nintention to offer at the proper time an amendment to the bill in charge\r\nof Mr. Ashley. No objection having been made, it was ordered to be\r\nprinted. This was, in fact, a substitute for the bill reported by the\r\nOhio member, and provided “that no State engaged in rebellion against\r\nthe Government of the United States shall be allowed to resume its\r\npolitical relations with the Government of the United States until by\r\nthe action of the loyal citizens within the limits of the same a State\r\nconstitution shall be ordained and established, republican in form,\r\nforever prohibiting involuntary servitude within the State, and\r\nguarantying to all persons freedom and equality of rights before the\r\nlaw.” Its second section provided “that the State of Louisiana shall be\r\npermitted to renew its political relations with the Government of the\r\nUnited States under the constitution adopted by the convention assembled\r\nat New Orleans on the 6th of April, 1864.”[349]\r\n\r\nThat some of the more influential among the radical members desired to\r\navoid, if possible, a controversy with the President may be fairly\r\ninferred from a letter of Charles Sumner, written December 27, 1864, to\r\nDoctor Lieber. Among other things the Senator says: “I have presented to\r\nthe President the duty of harmony between Congress and the Executive. He\r\nis agreed. It is proposed to admit Louisiana (which ought not to be\r\ndone), and at the same time pass the reconstruction bill for all the\r\nother States, giving the electoral franchise to ‘all citizens’ without\r\ndistinction of color. If this arrangement is carried out, it will be an\r\nimmense political act.”[350] A communication to John Bright, written a\r\nfew days after the above, January 1, 1865, confirms this view. On that\r\noccasion Mr. Sumner said: “The President is exerting every force to\r\nbring Congress to receive Louisiana under the Banks government. I do not\r\nbelieve Louisiana is strong enough in loyalty and freedom for an\r\nindependent State. The evidence on this point seems overwhelming. I have\r\ndiscussed it with the President, and have tried to impress on him the\r\nnecessity of having no break between him and Congress on such questions.\r\nMuch as I am against the premature recognition of Louisiana, I will hold\r\nmy peace if I can secure a rule for other States, so that we may be\r\nsaved from daily anxiety with regard to their condition.”[351] These\r\npassages explain the amendment to the revived bill. Sumner was willing\r\nto remain a neutral spectator of the debates on the recognition of\r\nLouisiana provided the reorganization of the remaining States should be\r\nmade on the lines indicated by Congress.\r\n\r\nOn January 16, Ashley’s bill was reached in the regular order of\r\nbusiness; by direction of the Committee on the Rebellious States, it was\r\noffered as a substitute for the original measure, from which it differed\r\nin one very important particular. It expressly recognized the loyal\r\ngovernments of both Louisiana and Arkansas. By unanimous consent the\r\nproposed enactment, considered as an original bill, was offered for the\r\nplan submitted by Henry Winter Davis at the preceding session.\r\n\r\nRepresentative William D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, would amend the\r\nclause providing for the enrollment of “all the white male citizens of\r\nthe United States” by inserting the words “and all other male citizens\r\nof the United States who may be able to read the Constitution thereof.”\r\nMr. Eliot then introduced the amendment of which he had previously given\r\nnotice. By Representative Arnold another amendment was offered to that\r\nof Eliot.\r\n\r\nJudge Kelley opened the debate by declaring that indemnity for the past\r\nthe victors in the war could not hope to obtain; they could, however,\r\ndemand security for the future. In a very long speech he discussed the\r\nstatus of the negro in the early days of the Republic; this portion of\r\nhis address was concluded with the remark that his amendment did not\r\ncontemplate that the entire mass of people of African descent, degraded\r\nand brutalized by laws and customs, be immediately clothed with all the\r\nrights of citizenship, but only those so far fitted by education for its\r\njudicious exercise as were able to read the Constitution and the laws of\r\nthe United States. This, indeed, he admitted, was only an entering wedge\r\nand was to be regarded as an aid to their improvement; when sufficiently\r\nadvanced they were to be endowed with every right necessary to their\r\nprotection. A strong plea was made to confer the suffrage on the colored\r\nman; otherwise, asked the Pennsylvania member, how will it be possible\r\nto prevent his subjugation? He would not rely on men’s abstract sense of\r\njustice, for that had not prevented outrages in the past. Justice should\r\nbe embodied in laws and constitutions while it was in the power of\r\nCongress to do so. That body was to determine who should select\r\ndelegates to the conventions that were to frame governments for the\r\ninsurgent States. The Union minorities in the South required the\r\npolitical support of every loyal man in their communities. It was the\r\npower, he reminded Representatives, not the spirit of the rebellion that\r\nFederal armies were overthrowing. In conclusion he declared himself in\r\nfavor of conferring the suffrage on “every man who fights or pays,” a\r\ndoctrine which he ascribed to Jefferson, in whose party he said he had\r\nbeen trained.[352]\r\n\r\nMr. Eliot, who spoke on January 17, regretted that he had not been able\r\nto support the amended bill reported from the select committee. Partly\r\nbecause of the interest, he said, which his friend Henry Winter Davis\r\ntook in the subject he came to its consideration prepossessed in its\r\nfavor. The provisions of the measure passed at the preceding session,\r\nhowever, were not then discussed. There were strong reasons for action\r\nat that time which no longer existed to the same extent. There was time\r\nenough on the present occasion, January, 1865, to make it more perfect\r\nand more practicable than the plan offered by the committee.\r\n\r\nEntering upon an examination of the bill he declared that its terms were\r\nperemptory; eleven States were in rebellion, and by the first section\r\nthe President was called upon to appoint for each of them a provisional\r\ngovernor. Such appointments were to be made when the measure became a\r\nlaw. Except in Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee these appointments\r\nwould be not only useless but a needless source of expense, and though\r\nsection _fifteen_ recognized the governments established in the two\r\nformer, the machinery of the bill would be applied to all the States in\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nIt imposed upon the several governors proposed to be appointed executive\r\nduties which they could not assume until the power of the United States\r\nhad vindicated itself within those States; there were other duties which\r\nthey should not be required to perform. They were to see that the laws\r\nwhich were in force in that section in 1860 should be faithfully\r\nexecuted, with no knowledge on the part of the House of the import of\r\nthose laws. Why should Congress assume responsibility for enforcing the\r\nblack code? Why demand the enforcement, he asked, of minute police\r\nregulations in States where complexion appointed or reduced punishment?\r\nOther laws were specified, such as those punishing the circulation of\r\nbooks or writings advocating human rights, laws requiring the removal\r\nfrom those States of free persons of color, prohibiting them from\r\nengaging in business, and punishing by the lash upon suspicion of false\r\ntestimony and before conviction. There was a law, he said, in one of\r\nthose States requiring the imprisonment of free colored sailors in her\r\nports.[353] These provisions and many others of the same tenor were\r\ncontained in the statute books of those States in 1860 and had been\r\nenforced. The penalty differed according to color; offences when\r\ncommitted by a white man were punished in one way, and when committed by\r\ncolored men in another way. The provisional governor was charged with\r\nthe faithful execution of such laws.\r\n\r\nThe provision for the assessment and collection of taxes he\r\ncharacterized as a remarkable proposition; they were to be imposed\r\nwithout representation, without any persons at the national capital to\r\nenlighten Congress on the subject; they were to be laid without the\r\nknowledge of the parties concerned or the parties to be affected.\r\n\r\nThe sixth section, he continued, provided that every person who should\r\nthereafter hold certain offices in the Confederacy was “declared not to\r\nbe a citizen of the United States.” That, Mr. Eliot contended, was\r\napplying the punishment before the offence had been committed. If\r\nCongress declared that a man should for a certain offence be deprived of\r\ncitizenship, could he, then, be indicted for treason subsequently\r\ncommitted?\r\n\r\nThe question of electing delegates to constitutional conventions\r\npresented a practical difficulty. Colored soldiers and sailors in the\r\nservice were made voters by the bill; but they were not enrolled, they\r\nwere not registered or credited to any county or parish; they were\r\naggregated. They had no legal local habitation. They may have belonged\r\nto men owning plantations in several districts. The bill did not\r\ndesignate. With the white soldier the case was different, for he was\r\nknown to belong to a certain district. If colored men entitled, because\r\nof military or naval service, to participate in the choice of delegates\r\nshould be out of the service before the election occurred, and others\r\nshould have taken their places, which class could vote, those in the\r\nservice of the Government when the election for delegates took place, or\r\nthose serving when the bill passed Congress?\r\n\r\nWhether the difficulties pointed out were inseparable from any bill on\r\nthe subject, he would not undertake to say. But in his judgment it would\r\nbe unsafe for Congress to permit a measure containing such provisions to\r\nbecome a law. “Why,” he asked, “is it not more wise to take the States\r\nas they shall present themselves for admission?” Arkansas had acted in\r\none way, Louisiana in another, and Tennessee was proceeding in still a\r\ndifferent manner.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his objections to some features of the Louisiana\r\nconstitution, he favored her recognition. From information derived from\r\nthe highest sources, he had no doubt that her Legislature would supply\r\nsuch deficiencies. There were influences bearing on that body which he\r\nbelieved could not be resisted.\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens inquired, “If Louisiana and those other States are in\r\nthe Union, by what authority do we legislate for their internal police?”\r\nThis provoked laughter on the Democratic side of the House. “If they are\r\nin the Union,” answered Mr. Eliot, “just as Pennsylvania is, we ought\r\nnot to; but the difficulty is that they are not in the Union in that\r\nsense, to that extent, thus fully. They are not out of the Union\r\nterritorially, and yet rebellion has overthrown their governments for a\r\ntime, and it is needful that the Congress of the United States should\r\nintervene and should legislate.” To this the Pennsylvania leader further\r\nobserved, “I understand the gentleman to say that they are partly in the\r\nUnion, and partly out. About how much are they in the Union and about\r\nhow much out?” This keen thrust was greeted by more laughter from the\r\nDemocratic members.[354]\r\n\r\nOn his motion to postpone further consideration for two weeks Mr. Wilson\r\ndemanded the previous question. Henry Winter Davis appealed to him to\r\nwithdraw the motion. This Mr. Wilson declined to do, upon which the\r\nMaryland member observed, “a vote to postpone is equivalent to a vote to\r\nkill the bill.” By 103 yeas to 34 nays, however, further debate was\r\npostponed till the 1st of February succeeding.[355]\r\n\r\nThough Representative Washburne, of Illinois, moved on February 7 a\r\nfurther postponement of two weeks, the subject was before the House\r\nagain on the following day, when it went over informally. Debate was not\r\nresumed till the 20th, when Mr. Dawes, of Massachusetts, took the floor.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-eighth Congress, he said, was in the last days of its last\r\nsession; a bill containing the main features of the measure under\r\nconsideration, though it passed both Houses, failed at the preceding\r\nsession to become a law; this circumstance led him to make a careful\r\nexamination of the subject. The proposed enactment was not designed to\r\ninvigorate the army, the navy or the Executive; it was intended rather\r\nto follow the army. It was intended to be applied to the condition in\r\nwhich the army left the State. “it is an attempt,” he said, “to gather\r\nup the ‘_disjecta membra_’ of those States, the broken and torn\r\nfragments of those communities, and out of the chaos, as well as the\r\nruins and _debris_ that are left in the march of those armies, to create\r\na State capable of discharging the functions, exercising the authority,\r\nand invoking the recognition of this Government, and of the people under\r\nwhich it lives....\r\n\r\n“... The bill proceeds upon the supposition not only that there are\r\nStates still existing, but that their old constitutions and laws are\r\nstill in full force and operation”; for it imposed upon the provisional\r\ngovernor the faithful execution of those laws in force when rebellion\r\noverthrew their State governments, with the single exception of the\r\nprovision touching the enforcement of laws against slavery and the mode\r\nof trial and punishment of colored people. Two remarkable features of\r\nthe bill, he asserted, were those empowering the Executive in\r\nWashington, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint\r\ngovernors in every one of those States; then, no matter what provisions\r\nfor their election existed in the State law, the President was\r\nauthorized to appoint just as many and just as few officers as he\r\npleased. It might be a judge of the highest court of judicature in the\r\nState; or it might be the humblest road-master; it might be any one or\r\nall of the countless corps between them. There was no provision in the\r\nbill that they should be even residents of the State. “An army of\r\nofficers,” he continued, “in one paragraph of four lines, is here\r\ncreated, subject to the sole authority and control of the President of\r\nthe United States.” In a Confederate report Mr. Dawes noticed that there\r\nwere 13,000 of them in a single State.\r\n\r\n“What,” he asked, “is the effect to be on the people over whom, from\r\nevery quarter of this Union, broken-down politicians, men without place,\r\nfoot-loose, are to be placed? Sir, it is a reproach to our Government at\r\nthis hour that there are, about this capital and in the Northern States,\r\nmen who have been appointed to the judgeships of district and other\r\ncourts of the rebel States and Territories, drawing quarterly the\r\nsalaries of those offices, although they have never been able, from the\r\nhour they received their commissions to the present moment to set foot\r\nin the States over whose courts they have been appointed. They could not\r\ngo one rod into the State, positions in whose highest courts they have\r\nheld for more than a year, without being hung on the first tree.... But\r\nmy friend [Mr. Ashley] has reported a bill here which authorizes an army\r\nof thousands of these officeholders to go into those States, with\r\ncommissions from this capital in their pockets, to lord it over the\r\npoor, miserable inhabitants left behind the army there. These rebel\r\nStates may be thus converted into asylums for broken-down politicians.”\r\n\r\nIn the language of indignation he entered into a criticism of that\r\npolicy which proposed to levy on the houseless and homeless wanderers in\r\nthe South, even then only saved from starvation by the charity of the\r\nNorth, precisely the same amount of taxes raised in 1860 when, by\r\ncomparison, the people were in a princely state. “Sir,” he declared,\r\n“there is not an army, great as our army is, that has power enough to\r\naccomplish that one single feat provided for in this bill, for the very\r\nplain reason that there is not money enough left in any one of these\r\nStates outside the Government with which to pay that round sum for one\r\nsingle year.... This wise, efficacious policy is resorted to in this\r\nbill to hasten on, I suppose, that other day mentioned in it, when a\r\nmajority of these people, molded by this process, won by its benignity\r\n‘shall voluntarily take the oath of allegiance.’”\r\n\r\nHe asserted, as Eliot had done, that the committee were calling upon\r\nCongress to sanction all the black codes of those States, save only that\r\npart which held men in bondage, and that was allowed to enforce itself.\r\n\r\nThe omissions, he asserted, were not less remarkable than the provisions\r\nof the bill. The state of things established by it was of indefinite\r\nduration. There was no provision for the peculiar conditions existing\r\nthere. “There is no attempt at any adaptation of these laws to the new\r\nstate of things consequent upon the rebellion, and consequent upon our\r\nconstitutional action here. Not only is there no provision for the new\r\nwants and necessities of this wasted and wretched people who have been\r\ninvolved in the rebellion, but for that other people who have now passed\r\ninto freedom by our legislation, and by the military consequences of\r\nthis rebellion, who are now without food, without subsistence, without\r\nknowledge, and without opportunity to support and maintain themselves;\r\nyes, sir, without homes, literally without where to lay their heads.”\r\nThere were 3,000,000 of these people, he added, whose very existence was\r\nignored by the bill; there was no provision for schools; no provision\r\nfor even a poorhouse; no provision to teach them the arts of\r\ncivilization, no provision for kindling in them hope, for holding up\r\nbefore them incentives to industry or securing to them its reward. Under\r\nthe operations of the bill they were the objects of free plunder; they\r\nwere to go forth to be hunted, despoiled and persecuted: outcasts in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nBy the bill it was left in the discretion of the provisional governor,\r\nhe asserted, to terminate the system set over them. He, as well as the\r\narmy of officeholders under him, would be interested in prolonging the\r\nperiod until the people had _sufficiently_ returned to their obedience.\r\nBefore the initiatory steps could be taken, even if the provisional\r\ngovernor were willing, a majority of the people in each State must of\r\ntheir own choice signify their loyalty by taking the oath of allegiance.\r\nThis made the matter dependent not upon the wish of the loyal, but of\r\nthe disloyal persons who constituted the majority in those States.\r\n\r\nThe plan, he further stated, ignored the principle that the American\r\npeople have the right to shape and alter for themselves the rules by\r\nwhich they are to be governed. If the matter was left in the hands of\r\nthe disloyal, the time would be far distant when Union governments would\r\nbe instituted in those States. The only wise policy was to establish a\r\ngovernment among the loyal; even though it might be weak and inefficient\r\nat first, it would finally win back those who desired to be reconciled.\r\nThe other numerous class, those who deserved to be hanged, were not\r\nprovided for in the bill. He was opposed to the provision which would\r\nturn over to insurgents the loyal minorities in those States, and was\r\nnot less opposed to prescribing a fixed iron rule by conformity to which\r\nalone out of chaos and anarchy might be made a loyal government.\r\n\r\nFurther, the bill proceeded upon the assumption that there was no power\r\nin these people, except what was conferred on them by Federal\r\nlegislation, to establish State governments. This he denied, and the\r\nauthors of the proposed measure, by offering to recognize the\r\nestablishments otherwise organized in Arkansas and Louisiana had\r\nconceded as much. In the people, he said, and in them alone, existed the\r\nauthority to form an organic law subject to the constitutional provision\r\nthat the government should be republican in form. He favored a\r\nrecognition of the Louisiana government not because it was formed under\r\nthe guidance of General Banks, but because it was made by the loyal\r\npeople of that State, was acquiesced in by them, and because under it\r\nthey were building up a loyal government.\r\n\r\nGovernors Hahn and Murphy and the officials chosen in Louisiana and\r\nArkansas who had been exercising their functions for a year would be\r\ndispossessed by foreigners sent amongst them by the President, who was\r\nempowered to do so by the bill; bickerings, heartburnings and discontent\r\nwould follow any attempt to enforce this policy. Sooner or later the\r\npeople of those States must be allowed to form governments for\r\nthemselves, protected by the parental care of the central\r\nauthority.[356]\r\n\r\nFernando Wood declared that he had listened with interest and pleasure\r\nto words of conciliation for the South; little but subjugation,\r\ndevastation and annihilation had thus far been heard from the party, the\r\nAdministration and the people represented by Mr. Dawes.\r\n\r\nThe seceding States, Mr. Wood contended, had republican forms of\r\ngovernment which the treason of individuals did not affect. Nor did\r\nindividual crimes destroy the rights of the people to regulate their\r\ndomestic institutions. The forms of government were the same as those\r\nthat existed in the rebellious States six years before. Even admitting\r\nthat they had not such governments in existence among them, the bill did\r\nnot provide a _republican_ form of government for those States.[357]\r\n\r\nHe was followed in opposition to the proposed enactment by Mr. LeBlond,\r\nof Ohio, who discussed both the status of the rebellious States and\r\ntheir form of government. His speech on the former question added\r\nnothing of value to what Representative Pendleton had said at the\r\npreceding session, nor did he enter upon so able an examination of the\r\nclause guaranteeing a republican form of government as did Senator\r\nCarlile on that occasion.\r\n\r\nHenry T. Blow, of Missouri, made an appeal for the admission of Arkansas\r\nand Louisiana to prevent destructive military raids into those States as\r\nwell as his own. He would support any measure that would restore them\r\nand strengthen their loyal population. However, he did not favor negro\r\nsuffrage. His remarks scarcely touched the measure before the\r\nHouse.[358]\r\n\r\nJoseph K. Edgerton, of Indiana, who followed in a lengthy speech in\r\nopposition, said:\r\n\r\n  The forerunner of this measure of legislation, so far as this House\r\n  is concerned, may be found in the territorial bill reported by the\r\n  gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Ashley] from the Committee on Territories\r\n  in the Thirty-seventh Congress, in March, 1862. It was aptly termed\r\n  at the time by the gentleman’s colleague from the Cincinnati\r\n  district of Ohio [Mr. Pendleton] “A bill to dissolve the Union and\r\n  abolish the Constitution of the United States.” The bill was\r\n  summarily, if not indignantly, rejected by the House without a\r\n  second reading. But, sir, men and events have since changed, if the\r\n  Constitution of the United States has not changed, and the stone of\r\n  revolutionary reconstruction then rejected by the master-builders in\r\n  this House bids fair to become the head of the corner. Then the\r\n  Constitution was not altogether repudiated as the foundation of our\r\n  legislation; now revolutionary opinions and plans override it as a\r\n  thing of the past. Not many are there in this Congress, and fewer\r\n  there will be in the next, I fear, to do reverence to the\r\n  Constitution and obey its commands.\r\n\r\nThe President’s proclamation of December 8, 1863, was then noticed, and\r\nhis usurpation of authority denounced; the subject of the Louisiana\r\ngovernment was also entered upon and fully discussed. He next referred\r\nto the introduction early in the preceding session of a resolution by\r\nHenry Winter Davis providing for the appointment of a special committee\r\nauthorized to report a bill guaranteeing a republican form of government\r\nto the rebellious States. The fate of that bill, President Lincoln’s\r\nproclamation concerning it, and the protest of Wade and Davis were\r\nsuccessively dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nThe question between the President and his two Congressional friends,\r\nWade and Davis, was to Mr. Edgerton’s mind “one between two usurping\r\npowers, the Executive and the Legislative”; but, he continued, “I am\r\nfree to say my sympathies were with the legislators and not with the\r\nPresident. Executive edicts have done more than acts of Congress during\r\nthe last four years to sap the foundations and remove the landmarks of\r\nthe Constitution.” The majority in Congress, he asserted, by consenting\r\nto recognize the governments of Louisiana and Arkansas, kissed the hand\r\nthat smote them.\r\n\r\nHe opposed a recognition of the Louisiana government because of its\r\nunconstitutional origin; Arkansas, he said, differed from it in no\r\nmaterial respect. After stating the provisions of the bill he gave the\r\nfollowing summary of its effects:\r\n\r\n  1. To take from the people of the State all power to initiate\r\n  proceedings to reorganize their own State government in harmony with\r\n  the Constitution of the United States, or even to prescribe the\r\n  qualifications of suffrage. The bill ignores the idea that there is\r\n  any vital power in the people to restore their State government—not\r\n  only taken from them by rebellion but kept from them by Federal\r\n  power—....\r\n\r\n  2. The effect is to exclude from the reorganization the entire white\r\n  population of the State who shall have held office or voluntarily\r\n  borne arms against the United States, or who shall not take the oath\r\n  of July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\n  3. To confine the right of suffrage and power of reorganization to\r\n  enrolled men and Federal soldiers taking the oath; and the law\r\n  affords no guaranty that even the enrollment shall embrace a\r\n  majority of males over twenty-one years of age. The majority\r\n  required as a basis of action is so many of enrolled persons taking\r\n  the oath as, with the soldiers, shall constitute a majority of the\r\n  persons enrolled; that majority, through defect or fraud in\r\n  enrollment, may be not even one tenth of the males of the State over\r\n  twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\n  4. The effect is the absolute disfranchisement of eleven States and\r\n  their continuance in a state of war until they accept “the\r\n  abandonment of slavery,” as dictated to them by the United States,\r\n  and until by organic law they declare that all persons shall have\r\n  “equality of civil rights before the law” of the State; a\r\n  well-seeming phrase of broad import; the precise meaning of which I\r\n  do not understand. A woman is a person, a negro is a person, an\r\n  alien is a person, and the right of suffrage is a civil right. Does\r\n  this high-sounding phrase of the bill mean that women, negroes, and\r\n  aliens shall have equal right to vote in a regenerated State with\r\n  white male citizens? What does “equality of civil rights before the\r\n  law for all persons” mean?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  In fact and in purpose, then, the bill before the House is one to\r\n  abolish slavery in the United States, and to enfranchise and elevate\r\n  negroes, and to disfranchise and degrade white men; a bill to change\r\n  the social and industrial systems and internal policy of eleven\r\n  States; a bill to take from those States their inherent reserved\r\n  constitutional right to regulate in their own way their internal\r\n  policy, not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States.\r\n  It is a bill to punish treason without trial or conviction; a bill\r\n  to confiscate private property without adequate compensation; in\r\n  short, a bill to reconstruct States and make State constitutions,\r\n  when in truth no States or their constitutions have been destroyed,\r\n  or need reconstruction, unless by the voluntary action of their own\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  If this is a revolutionary Congress, you have a revolutionary power\r\n  to pass this bill; but if it be, as I am bound by my oath of office\r\n  to believe and assert, a Congress sitting under the Constitution of\r\n  the United States, and having no powers outside of or unknown to it,\r\n  then you cannot constitutionally pass this bill.\r\n\r\nHe stated further that the bill “embodies a spirit and purpose toward\r\nthe Southern people which, if impolitic and vindictive one year ago,\r\nwhen the bill first came before the House, and when our enemy was far\r\nstronger and more defiant than now, is still more impolitic and\r\nvindictive at this time, when the minds of all good men are searching\r\ndiligently for ways of reconciliation and peace.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion he declared: “The Congress of the United States, the\r\nlegislative power of the Union, and the Constitution, is asked by this\r\nbill to be the minister and executioner of the great revenge of section\r\nupon section, States North upon States South. For one, sir, I wash my\r\nhands of the deed.”[359]\r\n\r\nThe passages quoted convey no adequate idea of the able and\r\ncomprehensive character of Mr. Edgerton’s speech. It was concerned not\r\nonly with the subject under discussion, but extended to a rather\r\nsearching examination of Republican professions in 1861 and the\r\nrevolutionary practices of a later time. It was marked throughout by\r\nperfect temper, but was not on that account less effective. Any\r\nextension of time, however, even twenty minutes, was denied him by the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nAt this point, February 21, Ashley withdrew a motion he had previously\r\nmade to recommit the bill, and by authority of his committee withdrew\r\nthe measure which was the original text and, in lieu thereof, introduced\r\nanother. With this substitution the pending amendments fell.\r\nRepresentative Wilson desired his substitute to hold its original place.\r\nMessrs. Wilson, Kelley and Eliot then modified their amendments to the\r\nmeasure hitherto under discussion, and Ashley explained his action in a\r\nbrief address.\r\n\r\nHe referred to the bill which at the preceding session failed to receive\r\nthe President’s approval. Since then he had labored earnestly to\r\nconciliate members on his side of the House who had scruples about the\r\nmeasure as it originally passed, and, if possible, obtain a united vote\r\nin its favor. For that purpose he consented to a compromise in providing\r\nfor the recognition of Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee. The conditions\r\nwere not such as he would prescribe if those States stood alone. But in\r\norder to secure what he thought of paramount importance—universal\r\nsuffrage to the liberated black men of the South—he consented to insert\r\nin the bill which he had proposed a few days previously, a conditional\r\nrecognition of existing governments in the States of Louisiana and\r\nArkansas, and the government then being organized in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his efforts to win the coöperation of Representatives\r\nwho entertained practically the same opinions which he did in favor of\r\nuniversal suffrage for the colored man, and in favor of the early\r\nrecognition of every Confederate State with a population sufficient to\r\nmaintain a government, he now declined to offer his substitute. At the\r\nrequest and with the concurrence of his committee the bill of the\r\npreceding session was offered with some modifications. These alterations\r\nwere to strike out all that the bill contained to which gentlemen had\r\nraised objection, in that it seemingly authorized the execution of State\r\nlaws as they existed at the commencement of the rebellion. To make it\r\nperfectly clear what the committee intended, they had inserted a\r\nprovision that the governor should execute only such laws as related to\r\nthe protection of persons and property; that all laws inconsistent with\r\nthe proposed enactment, and all laws recognizing the relation of master\r\nand slave, should not be enforced. The section which authorized the\r\ncollection of taxes had been omitted. He preferred not to commit himself\r\nto a recognition of the Louisiana and Arkansas governments, unless he\r\ncould secure what he thought of paramount importance in reorganizing the\r\nother States.\r\n\r\n“It is very clear to my mind,” he asserted, “that no bill providing for\r\nthe reorganization of loyal State governments in the rebel States can\r\npass this Congress. I am pretty sure that this bill and all the\r\namendments and substitutes offered will fail to command a majority of\r\nthis House.”\r\n\r\nThe course of debate had shown on the Republican side, he said, so\r\nstrong an individuality that no compromise could bring them together on\r\nthe great question of reconstruction. Many on his side were capital\r\nleaders in the minority; they were good at pulling down, but not so good\r\nat leading majorities and building up. He admitted their utter inability\r\nto agree on the subject, and had consented to a conditional recognition\r\nof certain State governments because he knew they could be upheld by\r\nmilitary power until the rebellion should be crushed. Republicans were\r\nso nearly unanimous at the preceding session, he said, that he felt the\r\nconcessions embodied in his substitute would enable them to agree\r\nwithout much discussion or without consuming the valuable time of the\r\nHouse so late in the session. His remarks not only showed disappointment\r\nat the attitude of his party, but clearly revealed the existence of a\r\nschism in its ranks.[360]\r\n\r\nHenry Winter Davis then rose to state the case for the House. The bill,\r\nhe said, to which amendments were pending was the same as that which at\r\nthe preceding session received the assent of both Houses of Congress,\r\nwith some modifications to suit the tender susceptibilities of gentlemen\r\nfrom Massachusetts: “first, the sixth section, declaring rebel officers\r\nnot citizens of the United States, has been stricken out; second, the\r\ntaxation clause has been stricken out; third, the word ‘government’ has\r\nbeen inserted before ‘trial and punishment,’ to meet the refined\r\ncriticisms of the two gentlemen from Massachusetts who suppose that\r\npenal laws would be in force and operative when the penalties were\r\nforbidden to be enforced; that discriminating laws could survive the\r\ndeclaration that there should be no discrimination between different\r\npersons in trial or punishment. There has been one section added to meet\r\nthe present aspect of public affairs; that section authorizes the\r\nPresident, instead of pursuing the method prescribed in the bill in\r\nreference to the States where military resistance shall have been\r\nsuppressed, in the event of the legislative authority under the\r\nrebellion in any rebel State taking the oath to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States, annulling their confiscation laws and ratifying\r\nthe amendment proposed by this Congress to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, before military resistance shall be suppressed in such\r\nState, to recognize them as constituting the legal authority of the\r\nState, and directing him to report those facts to Congress for its\r\nassent and ratification. With these modifications, the bill which is now\r\nthe test for amendment is the bill which was adopted by this House at\r\nthe last session.”\r\n\r\nHe need not be at the trouble, he said, to answer the arguments of\r\ngentlemen who at the preceding session voted for the bill, and who, in\r\nthe repose of the intervening period, had criticised in detail the\r\nlanguage and, not stopping there, had found in its substance that it\r\nviolated the principles of republican government and sanctioned the\r\nenormities of those laws with which slavery had covered and defiled the\r\nstatutes of every Southern State.\r\n\r\nWith increasing severity Mr. Davis proceeded:\r\n\r\n  That these discoveries should have been made since the vote of last\r\n  session is quite as remarkable as that they should have been\r\n  overlooked before that vote. But they were neither overlooked before\r\n  nor discovered since. The vote was before a pending election. It is\r\n  the will of the President which has been discovered since.\r\n\r\n  It is not at all surprising, Mr. Speaker, that the President, having\r\n  failed to sign the bill passed by the whole body of his supporters\r\n  by both Houses at the last session of Congress, and having assigned,\r\n  under pressure of events, but without the authority of law, reasons,\r\n  good or bad, first for refusing to allow the bill to become a law,\r\n  and therefore usurping power to execute parts of it as law, while he\r\n  discarded other parts which interfered with possible electoral\r\n  votes, those arguments should be found satisfactory to some minds\r\n  prone to act upon the winking of authority.\r\n\r\n  The weight of that species of argument I am not able to estimate. It\r\n  bids defiance to every species of reply. It is that subtle,\r\n  pervading epidemic of the time that penetrates the closest argument\r\n  as spirit penetrates matter that diffuses itself with the atmosphere\r\n  of authority, relaxing the energy of the strong, bending down the\r\n  upright, diverting just men from the path of rectitude, and\r\n  substituting the will and favor of power for the will and interest\r\n  of the people as the rule of legislative action.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  All I desire now to do is to state the case and predict results from\r\n  one course or the other. The course of military events seems to\r\n  indicate that possibly by the 4th of next July, probably by next\r\n  December, organized, armed rebellion will cease to lift its brazen\r\n  front in the land. Disasters may intervene; errors or weaknesses may\r\n  prolong the conflict; the proverbial chances of war may interpose\r\n  their caprices to defer the national triumph; but events now point\r\n  to the near approach of the end. But whether sooner or later,\r\n  whenever it comes, there is one thing that will assuredly accompany\r\n  it. If this bill do not become a law, when Congress again meets, at\r\n  our doors, clamorous and dictatorial, will be sixty-five\r\n  Representatives from the States now in rebellion, and twenty-two\r\n  Senators, _claiming_ admission, and, upon the theory of the\r\n  honorable gentleman, _entitled_ to admission beyond the power of\r\n  argument to resist it; for peace will have been restored, there will\r\n  be no armed power but that of the United States; there will be\r\n  quiet, and votes will be polled under the existing laws of the\r\n  State, in the gentleman’s view. Are you ready to accept that\r\n  consequence? For if they come to the door of the House they will\r\n  cross the threshold of the House, and any gentleman who does not\r\n  know that, or who is so weak or so wild as to suppose that any\r\n  declaratory resolution adopted by both Houses as a condition\r\n  precedent can stop that flood, had better put his puny hands across\r\n  the flood of the flowing Mississippi and say that it shall not enter\r\n  the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n  There are things, gentlemen, that are possible at one time and not\r\n  possible at another. You can now prevent the rise of the flood, but\r\n  when it is up you can not stop it. If gentlemen are in favor of\r\n  meeting that state of things, then do as has been already so\r\n  distinctly intimated in the course of this debate, vote against this\r\n  bill in all its aspects; leave the door wide open; let “our brethren\r\n  of the South,” whose bayonets are now pointed at our brothers’\r\n  hearts, drop their arms, put on the seemly garb of peace, go through\r\n  the forms of an election, and assert the triumph of their beaten\r\n  faction under the forms of political authority after the sword has\r\n  decided against them. I am no prophet, but that is the history of\r\n  next December if this bill be defeated; and I expect it not to\r\n  become a law.\r\n\r\n  But suppose the other course to be pursued; suppose the President\r\n  sees fit to do what there is not the least reason to suppose that he\r\n  desires to do; suppose that after he has destroyed the armies in the\r\n  field he should go further, and do, as I think he ought to do, what\r\n  the judgment of this country dictates, treat those who hold power in\r\n  the South as rebels and not as governors or legislators; disperse\r\n  them from the halls of legislation; expel them from executive\r\n  mansions, strip them of the emblems of authority, and set to work to\r\n  hunt out the pliant and supple “Union men,” so-called, who have\r\n  cringed before the storm, but who will be willing to govern their\r\n  fellow-citizens under the protection of United States bayonets;\r\n  suppose that the fruitful example of Louisiana shall spread like a\r\n  mist over all the rest of the southern country, and that\r\n  Representatives like what Louisiana has sent here, with such a\r\n  backing of votes as she has given, shall appear here at the doors of\r\n  this Hall; whose representatives are they? I do not mean to speak of\r\n  the gentlemen now here from Louisiana in their individual character,\r\n  but in their political relations to their constituency. Whose\r\n  representatives are they? In Louisiana they are the representatives\r\n  of the bayonets of General Banks and the will of the President, as\r\n  expressed in his secret letter to General Banks. If you admit such\r\n  representatives, you must admit, on the same basis and under the\r\n  same influences, Representatives from every State from Texas to\r\n  Virginia; the common council at Alexandria—which has just sent two\r\n  Senators to the other House and has ratified the amendment to the\r\n  Constitution abolishing slavery in all the rest of Virginia, where\r\n  none of them dare put his portly person—would be entitled to send\r\n  ten Representatives here and two Senators to speak for the\r\n  indomitable “Old Dominion.” If the rebel Representatives are not\r\n  here in December next you will have here servile tools of the\r\n  Executive who will embarrass your legislation, humble your Congress,\r\n  degrade the name of republican government for two years, and then\r\n  the natural majority of the South, rising indignantly against that\r\n  humiliating insult, will swamp you here with rebel Representatives\r\n  and be your masters. These are their alternatives and there is no\r\n  middle ground.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Eliot’s objection the Maryland member replied that provisional\r\ngovernors “are appointed _now without law_, and all we propose is that\r\nthey shall be _under the responsibility of law and subject to the\r\ncontrol and confirmation of the Senate_.” Having in mind this condition\r\nand the Executive appointments to judicial places in Louisiana, Mr.\r\nDavis added:\r\n\r\n  Sir, when I came into Congress ten years ago, this was a Government\r\n  of law. I have lived to see it a Government of personal will.\r\n  Congress has dwindled from a power to dictate law and the policy of\r\n  the Government to a commission to audit accounts and to appropriate\r\n  moneys to enable the Executive to execute his will and not ours. I\r\n  would stop at the boundaries of law. When I look around for them I\r\n  seem to be in a waste; they are as clean gone as the division fences\r\n  of Virginia estates from here to the Rapidan.\r\n\r\nAfter explaining the efforts of Mr. Ashley and himself to remove the\r\nobjectionable features of the bill as pointed out by the two members\r\nfrom Massachusetts [Messrs. Dawes and Eliot] he again criticised both\r\nwith some severity, and continued:\r\n\r\n  Sir, my successor may vote as he pleases. But when I leave this Hall\r\n  there shall be no vote from the third congressional district of\r\n  Maryland that recognizes anything but the body and mass of the\r\n  people of any State as entitled to govern them, and to govern the\r\n  people that I represent. And they who may wish to substitute one\r\n  tenth, or any other fractional minority, for that great power of the\r\n  people to govern, may take, and shall take, the odium. Ay! I shall\r\n  brand it upon them that in the middle of the nineteenth century, in\r\n  the only free Republic that the world knows, where alone the\r\n  principles of popular government are the rules of authority, they\r\n  have gone to the dark ages for their models, reviving the wretched\r\n  examples of the most odious governments that the world has ever\r\n  seen, and propose to stain the national triumph by creating a\r\n  wretched, low, vulgar, corrupt, and cowardly oligarchy to govern the\r\n  freemen of the United States—the national arms to guaranty and\r\n  enforce their oppressions. Not by my vote, sir; not by my vote!\r\n\r\n  If the majority of the people will not recognize the authority of\r\n  the Constitution of the United States, what does the gentleman say\r\n  who proposes these declaratory resolutions? That they shall come\r\n  here without it? No, sir; but I would govern them for a thousand\r\n  years first by the supreme authority of the Constitution which they\r\n  have defied and will not acknowledge. And govern them how? Not by\r\n  the uncontrolled will of this or any other President that ever\r\n  lived, George Washington included. I would govern them by the laws\r\n  that in the hours of their sanity they enacted, unaltered excepting\r\n  so far as the progress of events require that they should be\r\n  altered; to the extent that we have proposed to alter them in our\r\n  bill, and no further. I leave their own rules for their government,\r\n  make the President appoint, under his official and public\r\n  responsibility, the officers who are to execute them; and if they do\r\n  not like to be governed in that way, let us trust that the prodigal\r\n  will come one day to his senses, and humbly kneeling before the\r\n  Constitution that he has vainly defied, swear before Almighty God\r\n  that he will again be true to it.\r\n\r\nThat is my remedy for the grievance. That is what we propose....[361]\r\n\r\nThough not his last word on the subject of reconstruction, this was the\r\nlast great speech of Mr. Davis in Congress on the question of restoring\r\npolitical power to the rebellious States. His alliance with Stevens, a\r\nsomewhat unnatural union, had brought him only disaster. As noticed in\r\nthe preceding chapter, he had been defeated for renomination in his\r\ndistrict. It is thought that disappointment hastened somewhat his early\r\ndeath, which occurred toward the close of the year, December 30, 1865.\r\nThough a touch of pathos may be discerned in his concluding remarks, his\r\nwas not the craven spirit that was ready, in the words of Edgerton, to\r\nkiss the hand that smote him.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Mallory, of Kentucky, on his motion to lay the bill and\r\namendments on the table, called for the yeas and nays. The question\r\nbeing taken was decided in the affirmative; 91 voting to lay the bill\r\nand amendments on the table; 64 were opposed, and 27 did not vote.[362]\r\nThe Democratic members were a unit against the measure, and in a body\r\nvoted to lay it on the table.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Davis now appeared complete, but the struggle was not to\r\nbe abandoned without another effort. On the following day, February 22,\r\n1865, Mr. Wilson from the Committee on the Judiciary reported House Bill\r\nNo. 740, to establish the supremacy of the Constitution in the\r\ninsurrectionary States, with a substitute which provided that neither\r\nthe people nor the legislature of any rebellious State should elect\r\nRepresentatives or Senators to Congress until the President had\r\nproclaimed that armed hostility to the United States within such State\r\nhad ceased; nor until the people of such State had adopted a\r\nconstitution not repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates; nor until by law of Congress such State had been declared\r\nentitled to representation in the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe authority for this bill he professed to find in the fourth section\r\nof Article I. of the Constitution, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and\r\n  Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature\r\n  thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter\r\n  such regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was somewhat embarrassed in defending his bill. Dawes and\r\nMallory exposed its weakness, and Representative Kernan, of New York,\r\nbelieved it would put it in the power of the Executive to say whether\r\nStates should be represented in Congress. Fernando Wood observed that\r\nneither by that bill nor any other could either House of Congress be\r\ndeprived of the right to pass upon the election, returns and\r\nqualifications of members.[363]\r\n\r\nMr. Ashley at this point moved to amend the substitute offered by the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary by striking out all after the enacting clause\r\nand inserting the reconstruction bill that was tabled the day before.\r\nWhen a point of order was raised against its introduction the Speaker\r\nsaid that there was an important amendment; the word “white” having been\r\ninserted before the expression “male citizen,” thus restricting the\r\nclass to be enrolled by the United States marshal. Mr. Kelley would\r\namend it by striking out the word “white.” To this the Ohio member had\r\nno personal objection; indeed, he was abreast of Mr. Kelley in the\r\nmatter of the suffrage: the only restriction he would impose being that\r\nof intelligence. Ashley appears, however, to have regarded himself as\r\nbut the mouthpiece of his committee by whose authority he had only a few\r\nmonths before inserted a provision in his reconstruction bill to\r\nrecognize the Louisiana and Arkansas governments, though he expressly\r\ndeclared on a subsequent occasion that he was opposed to such\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nBy a vote of 80 to 65 the bill and its amendments was again laid on the\r\ntable. Thirty-seven members abstained from voting; fourteen Republicans\r\nvoted with the Democrats.[364] This action was taken on the 22d of\r\nFebruary, 1865; the session closed on the 4th of March following without\r\nany further attempt to pass the bill. Before the vote was taken Ashley\r\nstated his sentiments candidly. He wanted a record made on the question.\r\n“I do not expect,” said he, “to pass this bill now. At the next session,\r\nwhen a new Congress fresh from the people shall have assembled, with the\r\nnation and its Representatives far in advance of the present Congress, I\r\nhope to pass even a better bill. Sir, I know that our loyal people will\r\nnever be guilty of the infamy of inviting the blacks to unite with them\r\nin fighting our battles, and after our triumph—a triumph which we never\r\ncould have achieved but for their generous coöperation and aid—deny\r\nthose loyal blacks political rights while consenting that pardoned but\r\nunrepentant white rebels shall again be clothed with the entire\r\npolitical power of these States.”[365] The desire to obtain negro\r\nsuffrage explains the inconsistent course of Representative Ashley\r\nthroughout these debates.\r\n\r\nBy a singular method of abridging history Mr. Blaine in his _Twenty\r\nYears of Congress_ passes without observation the attempt to revive the\r\n“pocketed” bill, though it was during its discussion that there was for\r\nthe first time unmistakably revealed the existence of a schism in the\r\nRepublican party.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  McPherson’s Pol.

It was thought proper, however, to reserve for separate\r\ntreatment the various questions presented by the participation in that\r\ncontest of Louisiana and Tennessee, two States reorganized under\r\nExecutive auspices. On the introduction by Mr. Wilson of a joint\r\nresolution declaring certain named States not entitled to representation\r\nin the Electoral College, the entire subject came before the House soon\r\nafter the meeting of Congress in December.\r\n\r\nThe proposed resolution was read twice and referred to the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary. On the following day, December 20, 1864, it was reported,\r\nordered to be printed and recommitted. Under the operation of the\r\nprevious question it passed the House on January 30 succeeding. Its\r\npreamble, which was favorably considered at the same time, declared that\r\n“the inhabitants and local authorities of the States of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee rebelled against the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and have continued in a state of armed\r\nrebellion for more than three years, and were in a state of armed\r\nrebellion on the 8th of November, 1864.”\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution provided that these States were not entitled to\r\nrepresentation in the Electoral College for the choice of President and\r\nVice-President for the term of office beginning March 4, 1865, and that\r\nno electoral votes from them, relative to the choice of said officers\r\nfor that term, should be received or counted.[366]\r\n\r\nIn a modified form the measure subsequently passed the Senate, which\r\nproposed that there be stricken from the preamble the words “and were in\r\nsuch condition of armed rebellion for more than three years,” and that\r\nthere be inserted in lieu thereof, “and were in such condition on the\r\n8th day of November, 1864, that no valid election for electors of\r\nPresident and Vice-President, according to the Constitution and laws\r\nthereof, was held therein on said day.” In this amendment the House\r\npromptly concurred, February 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, February 1, Mr. Trumbull asked consideration of the\r\nmeasure inasmuch as the electoral votes were to be counted a week later.\r\nWhen the amendment was under discussion, Senator Ten Eyck, of New\r\nJersey, moved to strike out the word “Louisiana” in the preamble, and\r\nadded that it was a matter of history that the State had reorganized, or\r\nat least attempted to do so, and in the opinion of many, and perhaps\r\nmost, of her loyal citizens had reorganized as a State. It was matter of\r\nhistory that they had elected State officers and a State Legislature;\r\nthat they had elected members to a constitutional convention and framed\r\na new constitution for that State; that the Legislature passed a law\r\nauthorizing the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of\r\nthe United States in the last Presidential election, and that such\r\nelectors had met and cast their votes. “Under these circumstances,” said\r\nMr. Ten Eyck, “I think there is a striking distinction between the State\r\nof Virginia and the State of Louisiana.” The object of his amendment, he\r\nstated, was to afford opportunity to a loyal people who had suffered all\r\nthe horrors of the rebellion, who had got the better of it, and put it\r\nunder foot, of coming back and resuming their place in the councils of\r\nthe nation. He did not then desire to make any further remarks.[367]\r\n\r\nSenator Trumbull then took up the discussion of Ten Eyck’s amendment to\r\nthe amendment. The electoral votes, he said, were to be opened and\r\ncanvassed a week later, and it was known to all that no rules for action\r\nhad ever been adopted in that joint convention. He recalled the fact\r\nthat in 1856 there arose a question over the counting of the electoral\r\nvote of Wisconsin. A severe snow storm had prevented the electors from\r\nmeeting at their State capital on the day fixed by law, and it was not\r\nuntil the day following that they were able to cast their votes for\r\nPresident and Vice-President. The question was not then decided, for\r\nBuchanan and Breckenridge were the successful candidates in either\r\nevent, and were so declared.\r\n\r\nHe believed a similar question was likely to arise when the electoral\r\nvotes would be counted on February 8. It was a matter of public\r\nnotoriety, he continued, that several of the States included in the\r\nPresident’s proclamation of 1861, Arkansas, Tennessee and Louisiana, had\r\ncast electoral votes. There was a question as to their authority to do\r\nso in consequence of the insurrection which prevailed there on the 8th\r\nof November, when the election took place, and the House of\r\nRepresentatives had passed the joint resolution declaring that the votes\r\nof certain named States should not be counted. The motion of the Senator\r\nfrom New Jersey would have the effect of counting the vote of Louisiana.\r\n“If we decide to receive the vote from Louisiana,” declared Mr.\r\nTrumbull, “it will be a decision by the Congress of the United States\r\nthat the State of Louisiana was in such a condition as to vote for\r\nPresident and Vice-President on the 8th of November last.”\r\n\r\nThe alteration proposed by the Committee on the Judiciary, said he, was\r\nfor the purpose of avoiding any such committal on the subject as the\r\nmotion of the Senator from New Jersey brought up. If the preamble “is\r\nadopted and the resolution passed, Congress will not have decided\r\nwhether Louisiana is in the Union or out of the Union, whether she is a\r\nState or not a State.” It would be time enough, he believed, to decide\r\nthat question when it was presented to the Senate. No statement of\r\nfacts, he asserted in reply to Senator Howe, accompanied the joint\r\nresolution from the Committee on the Judiciary; it was a House\r\nresolution, and no report accompanied it from the House Committee.\r\n\r\nA large part of Louisiana, he added, was on the 8th of November\r\npreceding in the possession of a hostile force. In a very considerable\r\nportion of the State there was no opportunity to vote for President or\r\nVice-President, and it might be a very serious question whether, when\r\nhalf a State or the third of a State was overrun by an enemy, an\r\nelection held under such circumstances and under the auspices of Federal\r\nguns would be an election which would authorize the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, when in joint convention it came to canvass the votes for\r\nPresident and Vice-President, to count ballots cast under such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn acting upon the resolution he did not mean to commit the Senate one\r\nway or another relative to the organization which had been formed in\r\nLouisiana. A decision to strike out Louisiana would be to decide that\r\nher electoral vote would be received and that on November 8th there was\r\na State government there. That he did not believe. No evidence, he\r\nasserted, had been submitted to show how many votes were cast.\r\n\r\nPursuant to an act of Congress the President had declared the\r\ninhabitants of Louisiana in insurrection against the United States. That\r\nproclamation had not been recalled. “Sir,” concluded Mr. Trumbull,\r\n“until there shall be some action by Congress recognizing the\r\norganization which has been set up in Louisiana, we ought not in my\r\njudgment to count electoral votes from the State.” Whether Congress\r\nwould recognize it, he could not say; that had not yet been done, and,\r\nuntil it had been, the electoral vote ought not to be counted. He hoped,\r\ntherefore, that Ten Eyck’s amendment would not prevail.[368]\r\n\r\nMr. Ten Eyck said it was with great diffidence that he undertook to\r\npropose an amendment to the resolution; but he held the doctrine that\r\nthese commonwealths having taken up their lot and part with their sister\r\nStates when admitted into the Union were not legally out of it; their\r\ngovernments had been in abeyance; they had been overrun by the feet of\r\nhostile armies, and many of their citizens, by usurpation and in\r\nviolation of their duty to their fellow-men and to their God, had\r\nattempted to carry these States out of the Union.\r\n\r\nThat being his opinion, whenever these States, by the aid of the General\r\nGovernment, or by the efforts of their own people, or by the act of both\r\ncombined, reëstablished themselves, or set their State governments in\r\naction anew, and had commenced again to revolve in their old orbits, he\r\nshould feel it his duty, so far as he was concerned, to extend to them\r\nall the privileges and all the rights to which the loyal people of a\r\nloyal State were entitled at the hands of their sister States, whether\r\nupon the floor of the Senate or anywhere else. It was to exclude\r\nLouisiana from the operation of the resolution that he made his motion.\r\nAs to those States manifestly in the condition described in the preamble\r\nthere was propriety in passing the resolution.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an observation of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,\r\nthat the majority desired to avoid a committal on this subject, Mr. Ten\r\nEyck suggested that it would not, perhaps, be amiss to insist that a\r\ncommittal should not be had against the interest of the State any more\r\nthan in its favor, and if his amendment involved the question whether\r\nLouisiana was in a condition to perform all the functions of a State\r\ngovernment and to appoint State officers and Senators and members of the\r\nnational House of Representatives, the same question was involved in the\r\nresolution and it would be determined against her if the joint\r\nresolution passed as it stood; for that would decide that Louisiana was\r\nin a state of rebellion such as to deprive her of all the powers, rights\r\nand privileges of a member of the Union. He was not prepared to go to\r\nthat extent.\r\n\r\nFrom various memorials, papers and documents that had come into\r\npossession of the Senate, he continued, and were published by its order,\r\nas well as from information derived from other sources, it appeared that\r\nnearly, if not quite, a year before an election for State officers was\r\nheld in Louisiana and a very large number of votes cast, about two\r\nthirds or approximating two thirds of the largest number that had been\r\ncast at any former election for State officers. Trumbull interrupted to\r\nremark that no such statements had been received by the committee. In\r\nthose localities which voted, perhaps two thirds of the former vote had\r\nbeen cast, but not two thirds of that cast in the entire State. Ten Eyck\r\nreplied that the vote was 11,414; it was alleged that a large number of\r\nformer voters had entered the rebel army and a great many had been\r\nkilled. He might be in error concerning the whole vote of the State. All\r\nthese elections were free and uninterrupted and without the interference\r\nof any military power whatever. A person on the ground had declared that\r\n“no effort whatever was made on the part of the military authorities to\r\ninfluence the citizens of the State, either in the selection of\r\ncandidates or in the election of officers, and that the direct influence\r\nof the Government of the United States was less in Louisiana than in the\r\nelections probably of any State of the Union; that the officers\r\nrepresenting the Government, both civil and military, were divided, so\r\nfar as they entertained or expressed opinions, on the question of\r\ncandidates and upon the policy pursued in the organization of the\r\ngovernment.” If any military interference was exerted it was in aid of\r\nthe loyal people, and the civil authority was not at all in\r\nsubordination to the military.\r\n\r\nIn view of the invitation that had been held out by the Government to\r\nall the loyal people of those States to come back and to endeavor to\r\norganize themselves anew and, when they had gained sufficient strength,\r\nto present themselves civilly and quietly at the ballot-box to choose\r\ntheir own State officers and to choose delegates to form a new State\r\nconstitution, and when they claim the rights of other States, are they\r\nto be met by the plea that upon certain out-bounds of the State there\r\nmay still be heard the tread of rebel feet? It appeared by all the\r\ntestimony that the population, the business and the property of\r\nLouisiana were confined to the cities and regions of country immediately\r\nbordering upon the river, and that the residue of the State was very\r\nsparsely settled indeed. That portion not submerged was used for\r\nplanting purposes. The wealth and population of the State were confined\r\nwithin a small space and this contracted area was chiefly under control\r\nof the United States. The Presidential electors were chosen by the State\r\nLegislature, and he did not think that method legal. That is why the\r\nvote cast in the election did not appear in the testimony submitted to\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\r\n\r\nAs to the withdrawal by the President of his proclamation declaring the\r\ninhabitants of Louisiana in a state of insurrection, if that were the\r\ntest either the present incumbent or his successor could keep the loyal\r\npeople of those States from returning to the Union during the remainder\r\nof his administration, and, if reëlected, for the following term. This\r\neven if every soul within the State were loyal and anxious to\r\nreturn.[369]\r\n\r\nMr. Howe announced his intention of voting for the amendment of Ten\r\nEyck, though for reasons very different from those which influenced the\r\nNew Jersey Senator. His support would not be controlled by the number of\r\ncitizens who participated in the choice of electors. “I am governed,”\r\nsaid he, “by the single fact that a statute of your own, existing at the\r\ntime of that election, declared that the people of that State had the\r\nright to choose electors, and that certain of them did participate in\r\nmaking that choice. The Senator from Illinois [Trumbull] says but a\r\nsmall portion of the people of the State participated in that choice.\r\nYour statute said that all might. Does the refusal of a large portion or\r\na small portion of the people of a State to participate in an election\r\ndeprive the minority, if you please, no matter how small, of their right\r\nunder your statute?” Besides Louisiana he understood that two other\r\nStates had made choice of electors. He would vote for an amendment to\r\nstrike them out of the resolution also.[370]\r\n\r\nTrumbull argued that a mere refusal to count the electoral vote of\r\nLouisiana did not settle the question against the existing organization.\r\nWisconsin had a right to vote in 1856, and nobody supposed otherwise;\r\nbut many opposed the counting of that vote. The State organization may\r\nbe perfect and yet its electoral vote rejected. If the Senate had\r\nrefused to count Wisconsin’s vote, it would not therefore have decided\r\nthat there was no such State. Ten Eyck promptly indicated the weakness\r\nof this reasoning by pointing out that the preamble of the pending\r\nresolution declared Louisiana in such a condition of rebellion that no\r\nelection could be had. Senator Trumbull then put the case of a foreign\r\nenemy having such possession of Louisiana that no election could be held\r\nthroughout the State, and asked whether the Senator from New Jersey\r\nwould count the electoral vote of Louisiana when not twenty men could\r\nhave assembled in the State and voted for President and Vice-President.\r\nIf the Senate refused to count her vote under such circumstances, would\r\nit decide that the organization of the State of Louisiana was not to be\r\nrecognized, and was repudiated? Whether the organization established in\r\nLouisiana was a valid one was a question which would come before the\r\nSenate when they inquired into the right to seats of those gentlemen who\r\nhad presented themselves as Senators.\r\n\r\nReplying to an assertion of Senator Howe, who was not in his seat, Mr.\r\nTrumbull said he would like to see the statute which gave Louisiana a\r\nright to vote in the Presidential election of 1864. If any such existed\r\nit would be repealed by the act of Congress which empowered the\r\nPresident to declare the people of certain commonwealths in a state of\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the objection of Mr. Ten Eyck that the President, if he\r\ndesired, could keep a State out during his entire administration,\r\nSenator Trumbull observed that it was only necessary for Congress to\r\nrepeal the act upon which the proclamation was based and then the\r\nproclamation itself would fall.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of a State to vote when she had an opportunity to do so,\r\nsaid Mr. Trumbull, would be no reason for excluding her electoral vote;\r\nbut the people of Louisiana did not have an opportunity unawed by\r\nhostile armies and unrestrained by military authority to vote for\r\nPresident and Vice-President. This, he said, was not the real point at\r\nissue; the question for the Senate to consider and determine was whether\r\nthe Legislature of Louisiana was a lawful assembly, for it was by that\r\nbody that electors of President and Vice-President were chosen in the\r\nelection of 1864.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull believed that on November 8 about three fourths of the area\r\nof Louisiana was in possession of the Confederates. No person could have\r\nvoted within that jurisdiction. Eleven or twelve thousand was the\r\nlargest vote ever cast under these organizations; while the vote of the\r\nState, when all her legal voters had the privilege of going to the\r\npolls, was more than 60,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Ten Eyck stated that 51,000 was the highest vote ever cast, and that\r\nthe average was but 34,000. Trumbull believed the Senate should concur\r\nin the House resolution and that it need not commit itself one way or\r\nthe other on the Louisiana organization. The counting of the electoral\r\nvote, which pressed for settlement, should soon be determined.[371]\r\n\r\nMr. Harris thought the question of counting the votes could be disposed\r\nof without committing the Senate or deciding the matter of admitting\r\nSenators, as was done in the case of Wisconsin in 1856. “If we count the\r\nvotes of these States,” said he, “the number of votes for Mr. Lincoln\r\nand Mr. Johnson will be so many; if we reject these votes the number of\r\nvotes will be so many; and in either case these candidates are elected.”\r\nBy this or a similar declaration, the phraseology of which was suggested\r\nby the precedent of 1856, the question could be passed over. He asked\r\nthe chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary why Congress had not the\r\npower to declare that New York should not vote. He opposed the preamble\r\nbecause he did not believe it true, and he denied that the local\r\nauthorities in Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee were in rebellion on\r\nthe 8th of November preceding.\r\n\r\nWhen, on February 2, Senator Harris resumed his remarks he observed that\r\nthe question as to the power of Congress to legislate in relation to the\r\ncounting of votes for President and Vice-President was not considered by\r\nthe committee. Reflection had led him to doubt the competence of\r\nCongress to legislate on the subject. That body could fix the time for\r\nchoosing electors and specify the time when they should perform the\r\nfunctions of their office. That, he contended, was the extent of the\r\npower of Congress over the subject. He could find no authority in the\r\nConstitution, however, which empowered Congress to pass a law, for the\r\nresolution amounted to that, excluding any votes returned to the\r\nVice-President. Even if Congress had the authority it was inexpedient to\r\nexercise it. Why should such extreme power be exercised when the\r\nnecessity did not exist? The result, it was conceded, would be the same\r\nwhether Congress counted the votes of Louisiana, Tennessee and Arkansas\r\nor not. The power was not contained in the Constitution. Those States\r\nspecified in the preamble did certainly rebel, but that Louisiana,\r\nArkansas and Tennessee were in that condition on November 8 was at least\r\nopen to question.[372]\r\n\r\nSenator Doolittle believed that Congress by legislation could provide in\r\nadvance for the manner of counting electoral votes; but that, he\r\ninsisted, was very different from passing a law which declared certain\r\nvotes null and void after they had been cast. That would be retroactive\r\nlegislation. He doubted the power of Congress over the subject of\r\ncounting the electoral votes, beyond that contained in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n“The Congress,” he continued, quoting the fourth clause of section one\r\nof the second article, “may determine the time of choosing the electors,\r\nand the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the\r\nsame throughout the United States.” Pursuant to this provision Congress\r\npassed the act of January 23, 1845. It was not for the president of the\r\nSenate to open such as Congress told him to open, but he should “open\r\nall the certificates” which were sent to him, “and the votes shall then\r\nbe counted.” Here, said the Senator, arose the grave question whether\r\nthe president of the joint convention was made the sole judge as to what\r\nvotes should be counted. The question practically came up in 1856, but\r\nit was not then necessary to decide it, and it was waived as not being\r\nessential to the result. On the present occasion, 1865, it was the same,\r\nthe result of the election would not be affected by the matter of\r\ncounting or not counting the votes of Tennessee and Louisiana; but it\r\nwas not necessary for Congress to assert a doctrine which in some future\r\ntime might be the very destruction of the Government, namely, “That a\r\npolitical party in Congress can decide that certain votes of certain\r\nStates shall be canceled and others shall be received. It will never do\r\nto set that precedent.” It would be time enough, he said in conclusion,\r\nto meet the question when it came up in the joint convention.[373]\r\n\r\nMr. Hale said that he had foreseen the difficulty and at the preceding\r\nsession had introduced a joint resolution directing in advance what\r\nshould be done; but the pressure of other business, certainly not more\r\nimportant, prevented action thereon. If the result of the Presidential\r\nelection had depended upon the votes of Louisiana, Tennessee and\r\nArkansas would the party have submitted against which their votes had\r\nbeen cast? The rebellion then existing was caused, he believed, by\r\nnothing at all in comparison with such a question.\r\n\r\nHe denied the assertion of Senator Doolittle that Congress had no power\r\nover the counting of the electoral votes. Suppose, he argued, that,\r\ncontrary to the constitutional provision, a member of Congress or any\r\nofficer of the Federal Government holding an office of profit or trust\r\nhappened to be an elector, would not Congress have power to say that\r\nsuch vote of Federal officer should not be counted?\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution, he declared, made the most ample\r\nprovision for just such a case. That instrument confers on Congress the\r\npower “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this\r\nConstitution in the Government of the United States.” Was not the power\r\nto choose a President one vested in the Government of the United States?\r\n\r\nMr. Hale contended that then, when action by Congress would not affect\r\nthe result of the election, was the time to settle the principle, and\r\nthe precedent could be pointed to showing the action and sentiment of\r\nCongress at a time when there was no inducement to anything but an\r\nhonest and straightforward decision of the case.\r\n\r\nSuppose, he went on, that Nevada while in the territorial condition had\r\ngrown restless under her provincial state and had sent certificates\r\nsigned by her electors, would Congress have no authority to say whether\r\nthey should be counted? In Washington’s first election the vote of New\r\nYork State was not counted. Now her Senator, Mr. Harris, doubted the\r\ncompetence of Congress either to exclude, or refuse to count, the votes\r\nof a State.[374]\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle objected to being quoted quite so strongly as to say that\r\nCongress had no power over this subject. Congress had power over the\r\nsubject, but that power was limited. When the Constitution says that the\r\nStates shall do certain things, such as directing the appointment of\r\nelectors, that is a limitation on the power of Congress over the matter.\r\nWhat he maintained was that after the ballots had been cast there was no\r\npower in Congress as a legislative body to declare certain votes valid\r\nor invalid. The tribunal to which the question was referred was the\r\npresident of the Senate presiding over the joint convention of both\r\nHouses. The power in the first instance was with that officer to count\r\nor not to count the votes. He was to decide whether they were from\r\nStates or from Territories.[375]\r\n\r\nSenator Trumbull maintained that so far from being empowered to decide\r\ndisputes, the president of the joint convention was not authorized to\r\neven count the votes. In the practice of the Government the\r\nVice-President had never since the days of Washington counted the votes.\r\nThe Constitution says that he shall “open all the certificates and the\r\nvotes shall then be counted.” It does not state by whom, but it does\r\nstate that Congress has power to pass all laws necessary to carry the\r\ninstrument into effect. Congress, he said, had exercised such power from\r\nthe beginning.\r\n\r\nThere was no legal difference, he asserted, between South Carolina and\r\nLouisiana. An individual trading in the latter State, except under a\r\nparticular license, could be taken up and tried as a felon, and yet “we\r\nare told that we cannot determine by act of Congress that they cannot\r\nelect a President for us!”\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull contended that if a question arose upon the counting of the\r\nvote of any State, the joint convention could not decide upon it. The\r\nbodies would have to separate and, by passing a concurrent resolution,\r\neach act independently. There was no popular election, he said, in the\r\nState of Louisiana, but a body assuming to be its Legislature had\r\nappointed electors of President and Vice-President. He did not know\r\nwhether the new constitution of Louisiana authorized that method.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Senate, he continued, in amending the joint\r\nresolution of the House was to avoid declaring that the people of\r\nLouisiana were on the 8th of November in a state of armed insurrection.\r\nThe preamble, even as it was amended, did not wholly satisfy him; he\r\nbelieved that he would be better pleased if it was altogether omitted.\r\nHe was informed that Tennessee had sent a vote as well as Louisiana. The\r\nobject of the committee was to settle the question before the meeting of\r\nthe joint convention.[376]\r\n\r\nSenator Collamer thought that any law honestly intended to carry into\r\neffect the provisions of the Constitution could not be objected to. It\r\ncould if it opposed or was inconsistent with that instrument. There had\r\nbeen legislation on the subject and additional action by Congress might\r\nbe necessary. For the resolution he offered the following substitute:\r\n\r\n  That the people of no State, the inhabitants whereof have been\r\n  declared in a state of insurrection by virtue of the fifth section\r\n  of the act entitled “An act further to provide for the collection of\r\n  duties on imports, and for other purposes,” approved July 13, 1861,\r\n  shall be regarded as empowered to elect electors of President and\r\n  Vice-President of the United States until said condition of\r\n  insurrection shall cease and be so declared by virtue of a law of\r\n  the United States.[377]\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Howard the question was regarded as of very great importance not\r\nonly as a precedent for the future, but “as indicating the opinion of\r\nCongress on the subject, to use a familiar term, of ‘reconstruction,’ or\r\nrather the rights of the States in rebellion.” He believed it clear that\r\nthe Vice-President was to open the certificates and that the duty of\r\ncounting devolved upon the two Houses thus assembled. The act of 1792\r\nseemed so to construe the Constitution.\r\n\r\n“The power of counting the votes,” he asserted, “and of rejecting votes\r\nwhich are void for fraud or illegality, is, under the Constitution, in\r\nthe joint convention thus assembled.” There was no doubt about it, he\r\ndeclared, because the Houses convened for a great and protective\r\npurpose; they were exercising the tutelary authority of the people, in\r\nprotecting the nation from the imposition of false and fraudulent\r\nballots and certificates. The inhabitants of the States mentioned in the\r\nproclamation of the President were public enemies; therefore they had no\r\npolitical rights under the United States.\r\n\r\n“I look upon this measure as necessary,” continued Mr. Howard, “as one\r\nform in which the sense of Congress ought to be expressed against any\r\nhasty attempt to readmit these rebellious States into the Union.” For\r\none, he would require the loyalty and friendliness of a majority of the\r\npeople of the rebellious States to be proved before readmitting any of\r\nthem. “The theory of our Government,” he went on, “is different from\r\nthat of almost every other government on earth. It is that the will of\r\nthe majority shall govern; in common phrase, the majority of the people,\r\nbut practically the majority of the voting population.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion he declared that it was “the bounden duty of Congress, in\r\nevery case, to keep out of the Union every one of these eleven seceded\r\nStates until, in pursuance of our laws, passed or to be passed, it has\r\nbecome perfectly evident to us that there is in such a State a clear,\r\nabsolute majority of its voting population friendly to the Government of\r\nthe United States, and willing to proceed in the discharge of their\r\nfunctions as a State; and, until that is done, you may be perfectly\r\nsure, so long as I hold a seat in this body, my vote will be given\r\nagainst any such proposal. I never will consent to admit into this Union\r\na State a majority of whose people are hostile and unfriendly to the\r\nGovernment of my country. I prefer to hold them in tutelage (for that is\r\nreally the word) one year, five years, ten years, even twenty years,\r\nrather than run the risk of a repetition of this rebellion, which has\r\ncost us so much blood and treasure.”[378]\r\n\r\nTen Eyck, considering Louisiana as the strongest case, mentioned it in\r\npreference to Arkansas or Tennessee, and, from a paper furnished by a\r\ngentleman who was familiar with the situation there, was able to state\r\nthat “eleven thousand four hundred and fourteen votes were polled at\r\nthis election. The average vote for ten years prior to the rebellion in\r\nthese parishes was fifteen to sixteen thousand.” The same parishes cast\r\ntheir highest vote, 21,000, in 1860. He expressed a wish to save\r\nTennessee also from the effect of the resolution, and declared that he\r\ndid not see how the Vice-President-elect, an alien, could preside over\r\nthe Senate. Further, a vote in favor of the resolution prejudged the\r\ncase of the Senators and the legality of the Legislature which sent\r\nthem.[379]\r\n\r\nSenator Pomeroy did not suppose that States unrepresented in either\r\nHouse could be represented in the Electoral College. He criticised the\r\ncorrectness of the preamble so far as it related to Arkansas. The rebel\r\ngovernor as well as the rebel legislature, he said, was driven out long\r\nago.\r\n\r\n“Arkansas,” he continued, “has not voted at all in the Presidential\r\nelection.... Under the instructions and impressions that the members\r\nfrom Arkansas received here last session, they distinctly understood\r\nthat States not represented in either branch of Congress would have no\r\nright to vote at the Presidential election. They returned to Arkansas\r\nand so reported, and they never had any election; there are no votes\r\nhere from that State. They have been in suspense awaiting the action of\r\nCongress.” The resolution itself did not, of course, affect Arkansas,\r\nfor there were no votes from that State to be counted.[380]\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan, probably adopting a hint dropped by Senator Ten Eyck, noticed\r\nthe fact that the proclamation of January 1, 1863, exempted from its\r\noperations thirteen named parishes of Louisiana because no rebellion\r\nexisted in them. The validity of that decree had been recognized, while\r\nthe proclamation of December 8 following invited the people of Louisiana\r\nand other States to resume their rights. The question was whether the\r\narrangements of the President were to be executed in good faith.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the Executive, he continued, “to put down this\r\nrebellion, to relieve the people from its oppression, and to restore\r\nthem precisely to where they were when the rebellion found them. If that\r\nis done, in ten days after his proclamation, _eo instanti_, the people\r\nresume their rights and functions; and in this case I understand they\r\nare not only in possession of the right, but are actually in the\r\nenjoyment of it, having a regularly organized government with all the\r\nmachinery necessary and proper to a government.” He believed that men\r\nand money were furnished the President to sustain State governments and\r\nmake them supreme within their own limits.\r\n\r\nConcluding this portion of his remarks he said: “Mr. President, this\r\ninvolves a direct conflict between the Legislative and Executive bodies\r\nof this Government, and at this time I am of opinion that we cannot\r\nafford to enter into that conflict.”[381]\r\n\r\nSenator Powell, of Kentucky, said that when it was asserted that General\r\nBanks did not interfere in the Louisiana election the statement was not\r\ntrue, for there could be no greater interference in the elections of a\r\nState than to alter the qualifications of voters. He declared himself\r\n“opposed to admitting on this floor persons who are elected under the\r\nbayonet influence in any way whatever. I very well know that there was\r\nno free expression of the people of Louisiana in these elections. I know\r\nthat they but obeyed the behests of the military, whatever commanders\r\nmay say about it.... But for its tragical results upon republican\r\nliberty it [the election] would be the greatest of farces.”\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky member believed that the rebellious States were still in\r\nthe Union, and when a majority of the people in any of them returned to\r\nloyalty, when their governments were organized, their Senators and\r\nRepresentatives should be received.[382]\r\n\r\nCowan, entering again into the discussion, said: “We are bound by the\r\nConstitution to preserve the Union and to preserve the rights of the\r\npeople under the Union; not merely the rights of a majority, but the\r\nrights of the people, of all the people, and of any number of the people\r\nhowever small. What are we to do? A minority of the people come forward\r\nand say, ‘If you aid us for a while we can preserve this State and keep\r\nher in the Union.’ ‘But no,’ according to the doctrine advanced here,\r\n‘there must be a majority of you before we can recognize you as in the\r\nUnion.’... That will be very poor encouragement for the loyal men of the\r\nrebel States to try and bring back their people to reason.” The\r\nPennsylvania Senator was one of the few who adhered to the opinion that\r\nthe masses of men at the South were not disloyal; that it was a leaders’\r\nrebellion.[383]\r\n\r\nSherman, of Ohio, described the scene in the joint convention of 1856\r\nwhen Humphrey Marshall wanted to speak and Mr. Mason, president of the\r\nSenate, refused to recognize him. Speaker Banks, however, did recognize\r\nhim; upon this, Mason and others left the convention, and confusion\r\nensued; that, Mr. Sherman believed, was a reason why the resolution\r\nshould be disposed of.[384]\r\n\r\nMr. Wade said: “About a year ago Congress, anticipating that such\r\nquestions as this might arise, in my judgment very wisely framed a law\r\nand passed it through both branches with the hope of settling this\r\nmatter in advance. That law was made upon great deliberation in both\r\nbodies of Congress: it received a very large vote in each House. It was\r\nvery proper in my judgment that Congress should fix the matter then,\r\nbecause everybody could anticipate that a question of the most serious\r\ndanger to the Republic might arise in the then approaching Presidential\r\nelection, which might endanger the stability of our Union, and which\r\nmight under certain circumstances precipitate these Northern States into\r\na civil war. Apprehending that such a question might arise, Congress\r\nwisely, in my judgment, provided against it; but the President did not\r\nagree with them, and he vetoed their bill, leaving the question open\r\nwith all its dangers, which, thank God, have not arisen.”\r\n\r\nThe President, added Mr. Wade, chose to pocket the bill, “and, as I\r\nsuppose, he did it in defence of the proclamation which he had put\r\nforth, declaring that whenever a tenth part of the people of a State\r\nwould come back, he would recognize them as the State and as part and\r\nparcel of this Government—a proposition which, with all my respect for\r\nthe Chief Magistrate, I am bound to say is the most absurd and\r\nimpracticable that ever haunted the imagination of a statesman.... And I\r\nmust say of that proclamation of the President that it was the most\r\ncontentious, the most anarchical, the most dangerous proposition that\r\nwas ever put forth for the government of a free people.\r\n\r\n“... I had a conversation with the now Vice-President-elect of the\r\nUnited States on that subject, and with other gentlemen on the Union\r\nside in the Southern States, and I do not know of one of them who was\r\nnot filled with the deepest apprehension that if this principle should\r\nprevail they would be annihilated by the nine tenths.”[385]\r\n\r\nAs to permitting citizens of Louisiana who were serving in the army and\r\nnavy to vote in the election of February 22, 1864, Mr. Doolittle\r\nobserved: “We have done the same thing in Wisconsin, in Ohio, in\r\nPennsylvania, in New York, all growing out of exigencies which have\r\noccurred since this rebellion began, passing laws, authorizing men,\r\nalthough in the Army of the United States, still to take part in the\r\nelections, providing that they should not be deprived of their rights of\r\ncitizenship because they had enlisted in the Army to bear all the\r\nsacrifices which are necessary to defend their country in this struggle.\r\nAnd, sir, I maintain that there was nothing wrong in this.”[386] Even if\r\nit were wrong, only 808 soldiers, he asserted, participated in the\r\nelection. A separate registry of this vote had been kept by General\r\nBanks. So far, therefore, from being a military usurpation it was an\r\nattempt of the President to lay down the military power. This he was\r\nendeavoring in good faith to do.\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat excited defence of the Administration by Senator\r\nDoolittle, and severe attacks on both President Lincoln and General\r\nBanks by Mr. Powell and others, Ten Eyck’s motion to strike out\r\nLouisiana from the joint resolution was defeated, February 3, 1865, by a\r\nvote of 22 to 16.[387] Lane’s motion immediately after to strike out the\r\npreamble, which would leave only an unmeaning resolution, was lost by a\r\nvote of 30 nays to 12 yeas.[388]\r\n\r\nSenator Harris proposed to amend Mr. Collamer’s substitute by resolving,\r\n“That it is inexpedient to determine the question as to the validity of\r\nthe election of electors in the said States of Tennessee and Louisiana,\r\nand that in counting the votes for President and Vice-President the\r\nresult be declared as it would stand if the votes of the said States\r\nwere counted, and also as it would stand if the votes of the said States\r\nwere excluded, such result being the same in either case.” By nearly the\r\nsame majority this proposition also was voted down without much\r\ndiscussion.[389]\r\n\r\nReverdy Johnson, who favored the House resolution as amended by the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary, did not think the rebellious States were out\r\nof the Union, and asserted that there was no power in any branch of\r\nGovernment to declare war against a State. Referring to the Whiskey\r\nInsurrection in Washington’s administration, he said that Congress\r\npassed no act declaring it at an end. The President declared it. It\r\nended itself. The insurrectionists laid down their arms, and expressed\r\nwillingness to yield obedience to the United States; that ended the\r\ninsurrection and disbanded the Federal forces, “and that happening, the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, every part of it, stood exactly in the relation,\r\nfor all purposes, in which the State and every part of it stood before\r\nthe insurrection was commenced.”[390]\r\n\r\nMr. Collamer said that the real point in Senator Johnson’s argument was\r\nwhether Congress had anything to do in the reorganization or\r\nreëstablishment of those States. Mr. Johnson, continued the Senator from\r\nVermont, seemed to think not. On resuming his speech, February 4, 1865,\r\nhe inquired: “When will, and when ought, Congress to admit these States\r\nas being in their normal condition? When they see that they furnish\r\nevidence of it. It is not enough that they stop their hostility and are\r\nrepentant. They should present fruits meet for repentance. They should\r\nfurnish to us by their actions some evidence that the condition of\r\nloyalty and obedience is their true condition again, and Congress must\r\npass upon it; otherwise we have no securities. It is not enough that\r\nthey lay down their arms. Our courts should be established, our taxes\r\nshould be gathered, our duties should be collected in those States; and\r\nbefore they come here to perform their duties or privileges again as\r\nmembers of this Union, they should place themselves in an attitude\r\nshowing to us that they have truly taken that position, and we should\r\npass upon it; and I insist that the President, making peace with them,\r\nif you please, by surceasing military operations, does not alter their\r\nstatus until Congress passes upon it.... I believe that when\r\nreëstablishing the condition of peace with that people, Congress,\r\nrepresenting the United States, has power, in ending this war as any\r\nother war, to get some security for the future.”\r\n\r\nThe guaranty clause, Mr. Collamer asserted, implied that States were to\r\nbe kept in the Union; it was inserted for the security of the minority\r\nin a State, though there might be but one man there to redeem Sodom. No\r\none State could discharge the United States from a performance of that\r\nobligation. To keep it Congress, if it was essential to maintaining a\r\nrepublican form of government, could abolish slavery if that institution\r\nstood in the way of performing the guaranty. Before restoring the\r\nStates, he added in conclusion, the President would need the assistance\r\nof Congress, else how could he get rid of the confiscation act.[391]\r\n\r\nCollamer’s substitute, which shared the fate of the amendment offered by\r\nTen Eyck, could be construed only by an examination of the President’s\r\nproclamation to ascertain what States were in insurrection.\r\n\r\nTo the preamble, which stated that four years earlier certain designated\r\nStates had rebelled, and on the 8th of November preceding were in such\r\ncondition of rebellion that no valid election for the choice of electors\r\nof President and Vice-President could be held there, Senator Pomeroy\r\nobjected that the rebel governor of Arkansas had been killed, and the\r\nentire disloyal government destroyed. When the election was held the\r\nreal local authorities in that State were Union men. It would not be\r\ntrue, as the preamble declared, that these authorities were in rebellion\r\non November 8. The terms of the disloyal officials in Arkansas had\r\nexpired by limitation; the chief men in that government were not alive\r\nto exert any influence if they were disposed to do so. It was not true\r\nto say that they made war on the United States on the 8th of November,\r\n1864, or that they were then in condition to do so. Since the rebellion\r\nbegan they never had but one election.\r\n\r\nPomeroy’s amendment to substitute for “state of rebellion” the word\r\n“condition” was carried by a vote of 26 to 13. The preamble, as thus\r\nperfected, declared that certain States had rebelled four years before,\r\nand on November 8 were in such “condition” that no valid election was\r\nheld.[392]\r\n\r\nMr. Lane believed that for the protection of Union men in those States a\r\nloyal government was indispensable, and that it did more to demoralize\r\nthe insurgents and to close out the rebellion than any other act that\r\ncould be accomplished. It would be worth more than all the victories\r\nthat could be gained in the field.[393]\r\n\r\nSenator Howe in closing the debate observed that four days had been\r\nspent in discussing not the passage of the joint resolution, but the\r\nreason to be assigned in its preamble for excluding the vote of certain\r\nStates. It belonged to the legislatures of those commonwealths, he\r\nmaintained, to declare whether valid elections had been held there. He\r\ndistrusted that sort of legislation, and in conclusion said: “If you\r\nwill take hold of the question of the political relations of these\r\ncommunities, and if you will tell what is the truth, and has been the\r\ntruth since 1861, that there are no State organizations there, no State\r\ngovernments, I am with you. When you establish that, you know what they\r\nmay and what they may not do.”[394]\r\n\r\nBy a vote of 29 to 10 the joint resolution was passed on February 4. In\r\nthe record the names of Cowan, Doolittle, Harris, Howe, Lane of Kansas,\r\nNesmith, Saulsbury, Ten Eyck, Van Winkle and Willey appear in\r\nopposition.[395]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of canvassing the electoral votes, both Houses assembled\r\nin joint convention four days later, February 8, 1865. The\r\nVice-President in discharge of his duty proceeded to open and hand to\r\nthe tellers the votes of the several States, beginning with Maine. No\r\none dissenting it was agreed on a suggestion by Senator Wade to dispense\r\nwith the reading of everything in the certificate except the result of\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\nWhen all the votes had been recorded, Cowan said: “Mr. President, I\r\ninquire whether there are any further returns to be counted.” The\r\nVice-President replied in the negative. To his former question Mr. Cowan\r\nthen added, “And if there be, I would inquire why they are not submitted\r\nto this body in joint convention, which is alone capable of determining\r\nwhether they should be counted or not.” The Vice-President acknowledged\r\nthat he had in his possession returns from the States of Louisiana and\r\nTennessee, but in obedience to the law of the land “the Chair holds it\r\nto be his duty not to present them to the convention.” The Pennsylvania\r\nSenator thereupon inquired whether the joint resolution had been signed\r\nby the President, and was informed that while the official communication\r\nof its approval had not been received by either House, the Chair had\r\nbeen apprised that the resolution had received the Executive approval.\r\n\r\nCowan then suggested that, as a motion was not in order, the votes of\r\nLouisiana and Tennessee be counted, and that the convention determine\r\nthe fact. Representative Cox immediately recommended the reading of the\r\njoint rule under which both Houses were then acting. On being directed\r\nby the Vice-President the secretary complied with this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThaddeus Stevens did not think any question had arisen which required\r\nthe two Houses to separate, for that, according to the language of the\r\njoint resolution, could only occur upon the reading of those returns\r\nwhich had been opened by the president of the convention.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan did what he could to bring the question before the two Houses,\r\nand failing, withdrew it. The result, after some further effort to call\r\nup the returns from Louisiana and Tennessee, was then announced. The\r\ntellers reported that for President of the United States Abraham Lincoln\r\nhad received 212, and George B. McClellan 21 votes; that for\r\nVice-President Andrew Johnson had received 212, and George H. Pendleton\r\n21 votes.[396]\r\n\r\nOn February 10 the president _pro tempore_ laid before the Senate the\r\nfollowing communication from Mr. Lincoln:\r\n\r\n  _To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n  The joint resolution entitled “Joint resolution declaring certain\r\n  States not entitled to representation in the Electoral College” has\r\n  been signed by the Executive, in deference to the view of Congress\r\n  implied in its passage and presentation to him. In his own view,\r\n  however, the two Houses of Congress, convened under the twelfth\r\n  article of the Constitution, have complete power to exclude from\r\n  counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal; and it is\r\n  not competent for the Executive to defeat or obstruct that power by\r\n  a veto, as would be the case if his action were at all essential in\r\n  the matter. He disclaims all right of the Executive to interfere in\r\n  any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes, and\r\n  he also disclaims that, by signing said resolution, he has expressed\r\n  any opinion on the recitals of the preamble, or any judgment of his\r\n  own upon the subject of the resolution.[397]\r\n\r\nExcept for a brief speech by Reverdy Johnson this message was received\r\nin silence by the Senate. Mr. Johnson commented upon the extraordinary\r\ncourse of the President, whose duty, he said, was clearly to approve or\r\nto disapprove, not virtually to read a lecture to the Senate as he had\r\ndone. The Maryland member did not doubt that the motives of the\r\nPresident were perfectly correct and patriotic, but it was not the first\r\ntime, he asserted, that that had been done. The bill for the\r\nreconstruction of the seceded States passed both Houses by an\r\noverwhelming majority; but it was defeated by the President’s failure to\r\napprove, and the adjournment of Congress before ten days elapsed. In his\r\nmanifesto or proclamation he approved portions and disapproved\r\nothers.[398]\r\n\r\nShort as this paper was, however, it was entirely characteristic of the\r\nPresident. This little lesson in constitutional law is only another\r\nproof that Mr. Lincoln possessed in an eminent degree the faculty of\r\nseeing clearly through the most intricate question. His disposal of this\r\ndifficulty as well as his reflections on Congress remind one of the\r\nfacility with which he straightened out for General Butler the liquor\r\nproblem at Norfolk. The succeeding chapter will describe another phase\r\nof the controversy between the political departments of the Government.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 505.\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 533.\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 534–535.\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 535–536.\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 536.\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 535–537.\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 537, 548.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 548–549.\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 549–550.\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 550.\r\n\r\nFootnote 376:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 550–551.\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., pp. 551–552.\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 553–554.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 554–555.\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., pp. 555–556.\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 556.\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 557–558.\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 558.\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 576–582.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 575.\r\n\r\nFootnote 387:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., pp. 576–582.\r\n\r\nFootnote 388:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 582.\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 583.\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 585.\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 591.\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 593.\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 594.\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., pp. 594–595.\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 595.\r\n\r\nFootnote 396:\r\n\r\n  The subject of the counting of the electoral votes will be found in\r\n  the Congressional Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 668–669.\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 711.\r\n\r\nFootnote 398:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 711.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n                       SENATE DEBATE ON LOUISIANA\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the opening of its second session, December 5, 1864, the Speaker of\r\nthe Thirty-eighth Congress laid before the House the credentials of W.\r\nD. Mann, T. M. Wells, Robert W. Taliaferro, A. P. Field and M. F.\r\nBonzano, who claimed seats as Representatives from the State of\r\nLouisiana. A petition, signed by numerous citizens of that commonwealth,\r\nprotesting against the admission of these claimants, was referred at the\r\nsame time on motion of Henry Winter Davis to the Committee of Elections\r\nin connection with their credentials, which had already received the\r\nsame direction. On the 13th this remonstrance was ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes on February 11 following reported that “M. F. Bonzano is\r\nentitled to a seat in this House as a Representative from the First\r\nCongressional District of Louisiana.” Six days later he presented a\r\nreport and resolutions from his committee to the effect that Messrs.\r\nField and Mann from the Second and Third Districts, respectively, were\r\nalso entitled to seats. These reports with the accompanying resolutions\r\nwere laid on the table and ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\nNo further action was taken on the question of their admission, but on\r\nMarch 3, 1865, Chairman Dawes by unanimous consent reported from the\r\nCommittee of Elections a resolution that there be paid to each of the\r\nLouisiana claimants for compensation, expenses and mileage the sum of\r\n$2,000 and a like amount to T. M. Jacks, J. M. Johnson and A. A. C.\r\nRogers, claimants from Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe House, however, was not nearly so unanimous as its committee. Mr.\r\nWashburne remarked that Congress, by allowing at the last session the\r\nsum of $1,500 to one gentleman who claimed a seat, had fixed a sort of\r\nrule in such cases. That amount he would, probably, not object to paying\r\nto the present applicants; but if large payments, such as the\r\ncompensation proposed by the resolution, were made to men coming to the\r\nCapitol it was feared they might not soon stop.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Johnson, of Pennsylvania, believed that regardless of\r\ntheir right to seats they should be compensated because they had been\r\nencouraged to come; they appeared at the Capitol, he asserted, with an\r\nhonest expectation of getting seats, and in an honest effort to restore\r\npopular government to their States.\r\n\r\nMr. Dawes declared that they came not as adventurers but under what they\r\nsupposed was the policy of the General Government; hence the favorable\r\nrecommendation of the committee. When he demanded the previous question,\r\nRepresentative Brandegee moved to lay the resolution on the table.\r\nThaddeus Stevens asked to strike out the words “claimants for seats.” To\r\nthis the Massachusetts member offered no objection. “I do not want to\r\nrecognize the idea,” added Stevens, “that anybody on earth thinks that\r\nthese men are entitled to seats.”[399] This request, however, was\r\ndenied, and the resolution was then adopted.\r\n\r\nIt was during their three months’ sojourn in Washington that one of the\r\nclaimants, A. P. Field, committed an assault upon Representative William\r\nD. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, whom he regarded as the chief obstacle to\r\ntheir admission. This occurrence, which took place on February 20 at the\r\nWillard Hotel, was due, no doubt, to the artificial excitement of the\r\nLouisiana claimant, but was without influence upon the action of the\r\nHouse.[400]\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Louisiana, as previously related, had chosen\r\nCharles Smith and R. King Cutler as United States Senators. With the\r\nRepresentatives-elect these gentlemen also appeared in Washington as\r\nclaimants for seats. On December 7, two days after Congress assembled,\r\nthe president _pro tempore_ presented certain proceedings of the\r\nLouisiana Legislature declaratory of the election of Smith and Cutler.\r\nThe papers, it was announced, would lie on the table unless otherwise\r\nordered. Just as Henry Winter Davis had done in the House, Senator Wade\r\noffered a memorial from Louisiana citizens remonstrating against their\r\nadmission, and also against the reception of any electoral vote from\r\nthat State. On his motion it was agreed that all documents pertaining to\r\nthe subject be printed. On the following day, December 8, the\r\ncredentials as well as the remonstrance were referred to the Committee\r\non the Judiciary.\r\n\r\nSenator Trumbull on February 17 succeeding made a report from his\r\ncommittee, and offered a joint resolution relative to the credentials of\r\nSmith and Cutler. At the request of Charles Sumner the resolution was\r\nread at length and was as follows:\r\n\r\n  That the United States do hereby recognize the government of the\r\n  State of Louisiana, inaugurated under and by the convention which\r\n  assembled on the 6th day of April, A. D., 1864, at the city of New\r\n  Orleans, as the legitimate government of the said State, and\r\n  entitled to the guarantees and all other rights of a State\r\n  government under the Constitution of the United States.[401]\r\n\r\nThis resolution was limited to Louisiana because the facts, while in\r\nmany respects similar, were not identical with those in the case of\r\nArkansas. Besides, when the subject first came up in committee the\r\nArkansas case had not been presented, though it arose before Louisiana\r\nhad been disposed of. Trumbull believed it the intention of the\r\ncommittee to act immediately upon Arkansas when the case of Louisiana\r\nhad been considered.[402]\r\n\r\nSumner moved, February 23, to strike out all of the joint resolution\r\nexcept the enacting clause, and to substitute the following:\r\n\r\n  That neither the people nor the Legislature of any State, the people\r\n  of which were declared to be in insurrection against the United\r\n  States by the proclamation of the President, dated August 16, 1861,\r\n  shall hereafter elect Representatives or Senators to the Congress of\r\n  the United States until the President, by proclamation, shall have\r\n  declared that armed hostility to the Government of the United States\r\n  within such State has ceased; nor until the people of such State\r\n  shall have adopted a constitution of government not repugnant to the\r\n  Constitution and laws of the United States; nor until, by a law of\r\n  Congress, such State shall have been declared to be entitled to\r\n  representation in the Congress of the United States of America.[403]\r\n\r\nTo this amendment Senator Trumbull objected that it would put it in the\r\npower of the President, by refusing to issue his proclamation, to keep a\r\nState out forever. Sumner’s substitute was promptly defeated by a vote\r\nof 29 to 8.[404]\r\n\r\nOf the members of the committee Powell alone opposed the resolution\r\noffered by Mr. Trumbull. The chief object in recognizing the government\r\nof Louisiana at that time, said the Kentucky Senator, was to allow that\r\nState to vote for the proposed amendment of the Constitution; to do that\r\neffectually those favorable to the resolution desired first to admit her\r\nSenators and Representatives; their admission would be the immediate\r\neffect of its passage.\r\n\r\nA just conclusion on that subject could be reached only by information\r\nconcerning the action of the President, of the military, and of the\r\npeople of Louisiana in connection with the election. He opposed the\r\nloyal government because it was not formed by the people of that State;\r\nhowever, he did not want to be classed with those who thought Louisiana\r\nout of the Union. He believed that something approximating a majority of\r\nher people should indicate a willingness to return to the Union, and\r\nshould participate in the movement for reorganization. The formation of\r\nthe existing government, he asserted, was controlled and influenced by\r\npersons who were not citizens of Louisiana, and, he added, “It is a\r\ngovernment formed really and virtually by the military power of the\r\nUnited States, using as instruments delegates who were elected under and\r\nby force of the bayonet.”\r\n\r\nBefore Senators could vote for the resolution, he continued, they must\r\nmaintain the doctrine announced in the President’s proclamation of\r\nDecember 8, 1863, when he proposed that one tenth of the loyal voters in\r\na State who would comply with the conditions therein prescribed, could\r\nform a State government; they must further maintain that the President,\r\nof his own volition, had power by decretal order to alter the\r\nconstitution of a State; that the President had power to prescribe the\r\nqualifications both of voters and candidates for office in the States;\r\nfinally they must believe that not only did the President possess these\r\npowers, but that Major-General Banks, in virtue of his office, possessed\r\nthem in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nMr. Powell proposed to show that not only did Louisiana people not act\r\nof their own volition, but that “they were coerced to do what they did.”\r\nThe constitution of that State, he asserted, was not made by the free\r\nsuffrage of the people.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a State government is a purely civil act; the people\r\nmust act without restraint. He had never heard any Senator say that the\r\nPresident could legitimately exercise the power assumed in his\r\nproclamation of December 8, 1863. Mr. Powell objected to the oath which\r\nwas to be taken as a condition precedent to becoming a qualified elector\r\nin one of the revolted States, especially to that portion which promised\r\nsupport of all future proclamations of the President on the question of\r\nslavery. “Why, sir,” he exclaimed, “the President may proclaim that the\r\nnegro shall be the master and the white man the slave; that the negro\r\nshall be the voter and the white man deprived of the right of suffrage;\r\nand yet this oath requires the man taking it to swear in advance that he\r\nwould support even such a measure as that....\r\n\r\n“At the very threshold, then,” he continued, “you repudiate the great\r\nprinciple of republican government that majorities shall rule. Here you\r\npropose to say not that majorities, but that less than one tenth shall\r\nrule.” It was intimated by the President that when they made a\r\nconstitution it must not recognize African slavery. General Banks,\r\ncarrying out the suggestion of the President, as well as what had been\r\ndistinctly stated to General Steele in relation to Arkansas, took it\r\nupon himself to alter the constitution of Louisiana in that respect.\r\n\r\nWhence does the President, it was asked, derive the power to prescribe\r\nqualifications for either electors or candidates? The proclamation, the\r\nKentucky Senator asserted, was the basis of the whole proceeding, and\r\nthose who voted for the resolution endorsed the proclamation.\r\n\r\nMr. Powell then reviewed the acts and read the proclamation of General\r\nBanks, whose conduct he denounced for presuming to declare certain parts\r\nof the Louisiana constitution no longer applicable to any class of\r\npersons in that State, and, therefore, inoperative and void.\r\n\r\nHe further objected that Banks had no authority to call the convention,\r\nfor the constitution of Louisiana could be lawfully amended in only the\r\nmode pointed out by itself. The President’s proclamation, he added,\r\nwould allow only those to vote who were qualified electors under the\r\nfundamental law of the State; those in the army and navy were not, but\r\nGeneral Banks in his ukase of February 13, 1864, allowed them to\r\nparticipate in the election.\r\n\r\nHe also invited attention to the action of the Department Commander in\r\ndesignating provost marshals to take care that the polls were properly\r\nopened, in the absence of the sheriffs, and that suitable persons were\r\nappointed judges of election and so forth. Of the 11,414 votes he\r\nasserted that 808 were cast by soldiers who under the President’s\r\nproclamation were not legal voters. The fact, added Mr. Powell, that\r\nGeneral Banks after the inauguration of Hahn as governor continued to\r\nissue proclamations shows that the civil was controlled by the military\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nPassing on to a discussion of the statement of Banks before the\r\nCommittee on the Judiciary that the military did not interfere in the\r\nelection of February 22, Senator Powell quoted the following passages\r\nfrom a proclamation of the Department Commander:\r\n\r\n  Those who have exercised or are entitled to the rights of citizens\r\n  of the United States will be required to participate in the measures\r\n  necessary for the reëstablishment of civil government.... It is\r\n  therefore a solemn duty resting upon all persons to assist in the\r\n  earliest possible restoration of civil government. Let them\r\n  participate in the measures suggested for this purpose. Opinion is\r\n  free and candidates are numerous. Open hostility cannot be\r\n  permitted. Indifference will be treated as a crime, and faction as\r\n  treason.\r\n\r\n“Talk to me,” exclaimed Mr. Powell, “of freedom of election under such\r\nmilitary orders! Why, sir, there was but one free man, in my opinion, in\r\nall Louisiana at that time, and that was Major-General Banks; and I do\r\nnot know that he was free, for he was serving his master at the White\r\nHouse.” The fundamental law there was martial law, which is but the will\r\nof the commander-in-chief, and under that law he could have beheaded\r\nthem if they did not vote.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, he continued, the coercive finger of the military\r\nwas engaged in the establishment of that government. Under the various\r\nproclamations even Unionists, men who had always been loyal, could not\r\nvote unless they took the oath required in the President’s proclamation.\r\nThere was a large class of loyal men in Louisiana, he said, who refused\r\nto take that oath, for there had been presented to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee an earnest protest signed by Thomas J. Durant and thirty-one\r\nothers, influential Union men of that State, against the admission of\r\nSenators and Representatives and against counting its electoral vote.\r\nThose Senators, he added toward the conclusion of his remarks, who only\r\na few days before opposed the counting of Louisiana’s electoral vote\r\nshould now vote against the resolution acknowledging the government\r\nwhich appointed the Senators that are claiming seats.[405]\r\n\r\nSumner and Davis referred to the resolution as a shadow. To this Mr.\r\nDoolittle replied that the vote of Louisiana might be necessary to\r\nsecure the constitutional amendment, and that the new constitution of\r\nthat State had struck the shackles from 90,000 slaves not reached by the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation.\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson, who favored the resolution, secured the floor, and\r\nobserved, among other things, that Louisiana and Arkansas did not claim\r\nthat they were yet strong enough to maintain their governments without\r\nthe military aid of the nation; but neither was Maryland, West Virginia,\r\nKentucky or Missouri; even Ohio, Indiana or Illinois, he said, could not\r\nwithout national assistance maintain their State organizations for sixty\r\ndays against the Confederate armies.\r\n\r\n“If we would have State governments,” said Mr. Henderson, “we must begin\r\nsomewhere and at some time.” It was nonsensical, he argued to talk of\r\nrestoring the Union, while keeping the loyal people in those States for\r\nall time to come under military domination. “We must declare the right\r\nin Congress,” he added, “to make and establish these governments for the\r\nStates, or permit the President, under military law, to set them up, or\r\nwe must recognize such as the loyal people may set up for themselves.”\r\nIf, as Madison thought, Congress cannot make them, but can only\r\nguarantee such as already exist and are found to be republican in form,\r\nit must be left with the President, under his power as the head of the\r\narmy, or to the people of the respective States. If left entirely with\r\nthe President he might by military force impose upon the State a\r\nconstitution against the wishes of both the loyal and disloyal. The\r\nSenator frankly admitted that neither House would be under any\r\nobligation to receive members sent from a State so constituted.\r\n\r\n“But,” he went on to say, “if the people—the loyal masses, whether a\r\nmajority or a minority of the whole voting population as formerly\r\nknown—participated in its creation and acquiesce in the revival of the\r\nState government, the case though inaugurated by the President in my\r\njudgment would be very different. According to the theory of our\r\nGovernment, and its practice in all its past time in analogous cases, it\r\nwould seem that whether Congress or the President inaugurated the\r\nproceeding, the constitution can only receive its validity and authority\r\nfrom the approval or acquiescence of the people to be affected; and that\r\nbrings me to consider how the people in the seceded States shall revive\r\ntheir governments, and who are the legally qualified voters for that\r\npurpose in these States.\r\n\r\n“At the threshold of the inquiry we are met with the objection that the\r\nStates are now without officers of any kind legally elected, and that of\r\nthemselves they are powerless to inaugurate any movement to set up a\r\nloyal government. It is said they have no officials to superintend the\r\nelection, to count the votes, and grant certificates of election.\r\nHowever desirable these formalities may be, it has not been the uniform\r\npractice of Congress to require them.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of California, continued Mr. Henderson, the first election\r\nwas called by the military order of a subordinate officer of the army, a\r\ndelegate convention was chosen, a constitution was framed by that\r\nassembly and submitted to Congress. It was accepted as republican in\r\nform, and under it a State government was inaugurated that for fifteen\r\nyears had been administered with the greatest success. The territory, he\r\nsaid, was wholly without civil authorities recognized by the United\r\nStates. Congress had passed no enabling act, had prescribed no forms of\r\nproceeding, had failed to fix the qualifications of voters, had\r\nappointed no judges of election or other officers to count and certify\r\nthe votes; yet the act, however informal, was ratified because the\r\nconstitution on its face was unobjectionable in form, and it was\r\nbelieved that the people interested acquiesced in the government it\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIf the people of Rhode Island, added Mr. Henderson, had acquiesced in\r\nthe government set up under Dorr, Congress and the Executive would have\r\nrecognized it as legitimate. The Senator from Kentucky contended that\r\nalthough a majority of the legal and qualified voters of Louisiana\r\nshould acquiesce in the new constitution Congress could not admit the\r\nState. In support of his view Mr. Henderson pointed to the State\r\ngovernment of Missouri, which was the offspring of a movement purely\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nIn the States whose representatives were seeking admission to Congress\r\nbut one government asked recognition, and what if these organizations\r\nwere of revolutionary origin?—the revolution was on the side of loyalty.\r\nRevolutionary governments had been accepted in time of peace—governments\r\nspringing up in the midst of anarchy, without the sanctions of\r\nregularity; why, he asked, should they be rejected now when they were\r\nneeded to protect the loyal inhabitants of the respective States and to\r\naid the nation in vindicating its lost authority?\r\n\r\nThe assertion that on the face of these constitutions they were\r\nrepublican in form Senator Sumner denied. They did not follow out the\r\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution. This general answer was\r\nunsatisfactory, and Mr. Henderson said that the only question with him\r\nwas how could he best get these States performing their legitimate\r\nfunctions in the Union again. If, as the Massachusetts Senator\r\nmaintained, the act of secession took the States out, why could not the\r\nact of loyal men bring them back? If secession, he argued, was potent\r\nenough to take a State out, and that was mere revolution, why could not\r\nthe loyal men perfect a revolution on the side of Government as well as\r\nrebels perfect a revolution on the side of secession, outrage and wrong?\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that secession took the States out of the Union, Sumner\r\nobjected to have imputed to him. A subsequent remark indicated one\r\nground of his opposition to the government of Louisiana. “If the loyal\r\nmen, white and black, recognize it, then,” he declared, “it will be\r\nrepublican in form. Unless that is done, it will not be.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked whether Congress could interfere with the right of suffrage\r\nin one of the States, Sumner evaded a candid reply, and concealed his\r\nmeaning under these words: “It is the bounden duty of the United States\r\nby act of Congress to guarantee complete freedom to every citizen, and\r\nimmunity from all oppression, and absolute equality before the law.” No\r\ngovernment that does not guarantee these things, he added, can be\r\nrecognized as republican in form according to the theory of the Federal\r\nConstitution, if the United States are called upon to enforce the\r\nconstitutional guaranty.\r\n\r\nSenator Henderson, interpreting this answer in the affirmative, observed\r\nthat if under the guaranty clause the national Legislature could\r\nregulate the suffrage in the States, there was no limitation except the\r\nmere discretion of Congress. In support of this position he cited\r\nMadison in No. 43 of _The Federalist_, and of course had this part of\r\nthe argument his own way, for the test of a republican form satisfactory\r\nto the Massachusetts Senator would leave few representatives in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson denied that the admission of Senators and Representatives\r\nfrom these commonwealths would be a precedent for other States to demand\r\nrecognition, even with the institution of slavery, thus bringing back\r\nthe germs of a new rebellion against the Government; because in the\r\nconstitutions presented involuntary servitude was abolished. With\r\nslavery remaining any restoration would be utterly useless. It was\r\nagainst union with the free States that the Southern people had taken up\r\narms, and against restoration that they continued to use them. In that\r\nstruggle they would employ every moral and material force, including the\r\nslave himself, stimulated by the boon of freedom, to resist the return\r\nof their States. Whatever the future might bring, it would fail to bring\r\nto the doors of Congress seeking admission a State constitution without\r\na positive interdict of slavery.\r\n\r\nTo the objection that a majority of the people of these States were in\r\nrebellion and that to recognize the loyal minority would be to subvert\r\nthe whole republican system Senator Henderson replied that if it were\r\nstrictly true that a majority in a particular community “not only shall\r\nbut must govern,” then a majority of legal voters in a State desiring to\r\nsecede would have the undoubted right to do so. As no principle of the\r\nGeneral Government authorized such action, it was not true, he said,\r\nthat a majority of citizens in a State can govern themselves except in\r\nstrict obedience to the Constitution of the United States. If a majority\r\nproved derelict and undertook to destroy the very Government of which\r\nthe State is a part, it is right that the minority, who sustain the\r\nGovernment in its entirety, State and national, should institute\r\ngovernment for their protection. He admitted that General Banks did a\r\ngreat many things for which there was no legal authority; but the\r\nquestion was whether this constitution was the will of the loyal men of\r\nLouisiana. If it was, their representatives had a right to seats on the\r\nfloor of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Sumner, Senator Henderson said he favored the idea that the\r\nloyal men should govern a State, and he added, if that be the government\r\nof the few it results from the voluntary disloyalty of the many. They,\r\nof their own will, had relinquished the right to govern themselves under\r\nthe Constitution, and as they had no right to govern themselves\r\notherwise they could not govern at all. As to the oligarchy of skin, to\r\nwhich Sumner had referred, Henderson believed that the regulation of the\r\nsuffrage was a question for the consideration of the States; if they\r\nconferred the franchise on the negro, he did not object.\r\n\r\nAs to the Louisiana constitution the question was whether it embodied\r\nthe will of those legally entitled to exercise the functions of the\r\nState government. If the casting of illegal votes vitiated elections,\r\nbut few elections, he asserted, would be valid.\r\n\r\nIf those States were admitted, they could immediately settle all\r\nquestions of suffrage, and Congress would be relieved of the difficulty\r\nin future. He put clearly the difference of opinion prevailing among\r\nSenators on this subject when he stated that Mr. Powell objected to the\r\nnew constitution of Louisiana because negro soldiers were permitted to\r\nvote, while Mr. Sumner opposed it because negroes at home did not vote.\r\nConcluding this part of his speech, he declared that the Federal\r\nGovernment by recognizing the old organization in Rhode Island against\r\nDorr expressed its preference for a constitution of restricted suffrage.\r\n\r\nWithout naming his authority Henderson then read from a private letter\r\nthe opinion of a gentleman whom he regarded as one of the ablest jurists\r\nin the United States.[406] The correspondent said in part:\r\n\r\n  It must be observed that the civil society, and the political\r\n  society so to speak, of a State need not necessarily do [be] the\r\n  same. In other words the basis of _representation_ may be the whole\r\n  population, but the basis of _suffrage_ be property, adult years,\r\n  &c. The power to choose rulers is lodged in the voters, and they may\r\n  not exceed one tenth of the population.... That portion of the\r\n  population in which political power is lodged, determines who shall\r\n  fill the respective offices, make laws, etc. Although the members of\r\n  that society may have possessed every requisite therefor, yet the\r\n  moment they ceased to be citizens of the United States they ceased\r\n  to belong thereto.\r\n\r\n  That rule holds good with respect to every member, and the political\r\n  society may, by death, disqualification of members, &c., be reduced\r\n  to a very few persons. To state an extreme case, for illustration of\r\n  the principle, Massachusetts formerly had a property qualification,\r\n  and although her population entitled her to, say, thirteen\r\n  Representatives in the United States House, her voters may not have\r\n  exceeded fifty thousand. Suppose while that qualification remained,\r\n  by some financial or other disaster, only one thousand or one\r\n  hundred citizens retained the necessary income or property, would\r\n  not the persons chosen to Congress by the few and only remaining\r\n  voters be duly elected? So with regard to any other element of\r\n  suffrage, as United States citizenship, if by its loss the voters\r\n  are reduced to very few in number, do not those few constitute the\r\n  political or voting power? As to the policy or impolicy of\r\n  restricted suffrage, we are not now concerned, but are endeavoring\r\n  to reach a constitutional and legal analysis of our governmental\r\n  system.\r\n\r\n  But here is encountered the startling and practical difficulty,\r\n  “Shall a few persons be permitted to govern a State, despite the\r\n  wishes of its inhabitants, and without giving them all a voice? Is\r\n  that republican?”\r\n\r\n  But it must be remembered that the few voters, say one seventh, or\r\n  one tenth of the whole population, have always been intrusted with\r\n  that power. Wisdom has fixed the basis of suffrage, without regard\r\n  to relative numbers; that is, it has endeavored, under our popular\r\n  system, to give the right or privilege to as many citizens as were\r\n  supposed competent to exercise it intelligently. The rules\r\n  prescribed as to age, sex, citizenship, &c., were deemed essential,\r\n  right, and proper. Whether many or few come within the rules does\r\n  not affect their validity.... If persons heretofore entitled to a\r\n  vote chose to commit a felony, and incur thereby, as a penalty, the\r\n  deprivation of their former right of suffrage, it is not supposed\r\n  that the loss of such votes is anti-republican. If, then, a majority\r\n  choose to perpetrate treason, or to expatriate themselves, or in any\r\n  other way become disqualified, how does that action vitiate the\r\n  rule? If they, after becoming disqualified, remain in the State, are\r\n  they not bound to submit to its rulers and laws? If their rulers are\r\n  chosen without their voice, is it not in consequence of their own\r\n  voluntary action? Indeed, it often happens that the persons elected\r\n  to office receive only a meager minority of the votes which could\r\n  have been lawfully polled, yet that fact has no influence upon the\r\n  legal result. So a person is often chosen by a minority of the votes\r\n  actually cast, and is not the majority bound to submit?\r\n\r\nThe author of this letter appears to have been more familiar with the\r\nConstitution, as it was understood by its framers, than almost any\r\nmember of either House, notwithstanding the presence in Congress of many\r\ndistinguished statesmen. In the following eight propositions Mr.\r\nHenderson then gave a masterly summary of the Presidential plan of\r\nreconstruction:\r\n\r\n  1. I hold that the seceded States are still in the Union and cannot\r\n  get out of it except through amendment of the Constitution\r\n  permitting it.\r\n\r\n  2. The seceded States being still in the Union are entitled to claim\r\n  all the rights accorded to other States.\r\n\r\n  3. That each State now in the Union has the right to stand upon the\r\n  form of its constitution as it existed at the time of its admission.\r\n  The people of such State may change its constitution, provided they\r\n  retain a republican form of government; but neither the President\r\n  nor Congress can reform, alter, or amend such constitution, nor\r\n  prescribe any alteration or amendment as a condition of association\r\n  with the other States of the Union. The General Government may\r\n  properly lend its aid to enable the people to express their will;\r\n  but any attempt to exercise power constitutionally reserved to the\r\n  State, beyond what may be demanded by the immediate exigencies of\r\n  war, will not tend to restore the Union, but rather to destroy our\r\n  whole system of government.\r\n\r\n  4. When citizens of a State rebel and take up arms against the\r\n  General Government they lose their rights as citizens of the United\r\n  States, and they necessarily forfeit those rights and franchises in\r\n  their respective States which depend on United States citizenship.\r\n\r\n  5. If a seceded State be still in the Union, entitled to recognition\r\n  as a State, and a majority of the people have voluntarily withdrawn\r\n  their allegiance, the loyal minority constitute the State and should\r\n  govern it.\r\n\r\n  6. Congress should not reject the governments presented because of\r\n  mere irregularity in the proceedings leading to their\r\n  reorganization.\r\n\r\n  7. If Congress has no right to make and impose a constitution upon\r\n  the people of any State; if its power extends no further than to\r\n  guaranty preëxisting republican forms of government; if the State\r\n  still exists, and the loyal men are entitled to exercise the\r\n  functions of its government, it follows that the only questions to\r\n  be examined here are, first, is the constitution the will of the\r\n  loyal men qualified to act? and, second, is it republican in form?\r\n\r\n  8. The constitutions of Louisiana and Arkansas are thought to be\r\n  republican in form, and it is admitted that the loyal men of those\r\n  States respectively acquiesce in them. Hence the duty of Congress to\r\n  recognize them, and the duty of each House to admit their\r\n  representatives.[407]\r\n\r\nOn February 25 debate on Trumbull’s resolution was resumed. At this\r\npoint Mr. Sumner offered an amendment in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n  That it is the duty of the United States at the earliest practicable\r\n  moment, consistent with the common defence and general welfare, to\r\n  reëstablish by act of Congress republican governments in those\r\n  States where loyal governments have been vacated by the existing\r\n  rebellion, and thus, to the full extent of their power, fulfil the\r\n  requirement of the Constitution, that “the United States shall\r\n  guaranty to every State in this Union a republican form of\r\n  government.”\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2. _And be it further resolved_, That this important duty is\r\n  imposed by the Constitution in express terms on “the United States,”\r\n  and not on individuals or classes of individuals, or on any military\r\n  commander or executive officer, and cannot be intrusted to any such\r\n  persons, acting, it may be, for an oligarchical class, and in\r\n  disregard of large numbers of loyal people; but it must be performed\r\n  by the United States, represented by the President and both Houses\r\n  of Congress, acting for the whole people thereof.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 3. _And be it further resolved_, That, in determining the\r\n  extent of this duty, and in the absence of any precise definition of\r\n  the term “republican form of government,” we cannot err, if, when\r\n  called to perform this guaranty under the Constitution, we adopt the\r\n  self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence as an\r\n  authoritative rule, and insist that in every reëstablished State the\r\n  consent of the governed shall be the only just foundation of\r\n  government, and all men shall be equal before the law.\r\n\r\nNot less important is the declaration in the fourth section that “in the\r\nperformance of this guaranty, there can be no power under the\r\nConstitution to disfranchise loyal people, or to recognize any such\r\ndisfranchisement, especially when it may hand over the loyal majority to\r\nthe government of the disloyal minority; nor can there be any power\r\nunder the Constitution to discriminate in favor of the rebellion by\r\nadmitting to the electoral franchise rebels who have forfeited all\r\nrights and by excluding loyal persons who have never forfeited any\r\nright.” To allow the reëstablishment of any State without proper\r\nsafeguards for the rights of all the citizens, and especially without\r\nmaking it impossible for rebels to trample upon the rights of those who\r\nare now fighting the battles of the Union, would be, said the succeeding\r\nsection, for the United States to fail in duty under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMore directly in opposition to the resolution reported by the chairman\r\nof the Judiciary Committee, however, was the seventh section, which\r\ndeclared “That a government founded on military power, or having its\r\norigin in military orders, cannot be a ‘republican form of government’\r\naccording to the requirement of the Constitution; and that its\r\nrecognition will be contrary not only to the Constitution, but also to\r\nthat essential principle of our Government which, in the language of\r\nJefferson, establishes ‘the supremacy of the civil over the military\r\nauthority.’”\r\n\r\nThe resolutions further asserted that a government founded on an\r\noligarchical class, even if erroneously recognized as a “republican form\r\nof government,” could not sustain itself without national support; that\r\nsuch an organization was not at that moment competent to discharge the\r\nduties and execute the powers of a State, and that its recognition would\r\ntend to enfeeble the Union, to postpone the day of reconciliation and to\r\nendanger the national tranquillity. The ninth section renders clear one\r\nground of Sumner’s hostility to the recognition of Louisiana. It asserts\r\nthat\r\n\r\n  Considerations of expediency are in harmony with the requirements of\r\n  the Constitution, and the dictates of justice and reason, especially\r\n  now, when colored soldiers have shown their military value; that as\r\n  their muskets are needed for the national defence against rebels in\r\n  the field, so are their ballots yet more needed against the subtle\r\n  enemies of the Union at home; and that without their support at the\r\n  ballot-box the cause of human rights and of the Union itself will be\r\n  in constant peril.[408]\r\n\r\nIt was agreed on motion of Mr. Sumner to have his amendment printed.\r\n\r\nSenator Howard, of Michigan, entered at this point into the debate. Much\r\nof what he said has already been related in the preceding narration of\r\nevents leading up to the reinauguration of a loyal government in\r\nLouisiana. While admitting that the President’s plan had been undertaken\r\nfor patriotic ends, he could not, he said, recognize in the Executive,\r\nwithout the subsidiary aid of an act of Congress, any right to assure a\r\ncommunity, composed of voters numbering one tenth of the electors who\r\nparticipated in the Presidential contest of 1860, that it would be\r\nrecognized as a legitimate government and entitled to the constitutional\r\nguaranty. This, he said, was a stretch of authority beyond any previous\r\nattempt, and he thought it time that Congress, in whom, he believed,\r\nrested solely the authority of readmitting and reconstructing the\r\nrebellious States, “should lay hold of this subject, assert their power,\r\nand provide by some statute of uniform application for the\r\nreconstruction, as it is called, and readmission of the insurrectionary\r\nStates. That is their right and their duty; that is not the right, it is\r\nnot the duty of the President.”\r\n\r\nA State he defined negatively as not “the geographical superficies,” the\r\nland, on which population resides, and positively as “a moral person, a\r\npolitical community, possessing the faculty of political government.”\r\nThe land, he said, is the theatre on which the political community moves\r\nand acts, but is endowed with no thought, no right, no duty. The\r\nthinking beings residing upon it constitute the State.[409]\r\n\r\n“A State of the Union or a State in the Union is, therefore, a people\r\nyielding obedience to the laws of the Union, that is, the acts of\r\nCongress and the national treaties.... A people who have a State\r\ngovernment which is republican in form; a people who were one of the\r\noriginal thirteen States which formed the United States, or a people who\r\nhave, since the adoption of the Constitution, been, in the language of\r\nthat Constitution, ‘admitted by the Congress into this Union’ as States\r\nupon an equal footing with the original States; for this equality of\r\nrights and powers as States is plainly implied by the language and the\r\nmanifest intention of the instrument; and no other people except such\r\noriginal State or admitted State; none but a State which permits the\r\nlaws of the Union to have full scope and force within its limits; none\r\nbut a State which sends Senators and Representatives to Congress\r\nfriendly to the Government itself, willing to vote men and money to\r\nsupport and uphold it, who believe that a person forcibly resisting its\r\nauthority is a traitor and deserving of death; none but a State which is\r\nwilling to bring to trial, to convict such a traitor, and to punish him\r\nfor his treason; none but a State whose population is capable of\r\nfurnishing both the grand jury to indict and the traverse jury to\r\nconvict such a traitor; none but a State whose population and whose\r\nauthorities are in favor not only of permitting the laws of the United\r\nStates relating to civil rights to be executed, but who are willing that\r\nthe punitive code of the nation, the code of vengeance against its\r\nenemies, shall be carried out; none but such are States of the Union....\r\n\r\n“To be in fact a State of the Union and in the Union, this will or\r\nconsent of the people must be in harmony with the Constitution, and its\r\nmovements subsidiary to it. It must regard the Constitution as its\r\nhighest political good; its injunctions as the highest human law, its\r\ncommands as the infallible and final measure of civil duty. In short, to\r\nbe in the Union is to be actively and willingly coöperating with other\r\nStates in the performance of all those acts and things without which the\r\nFederal Government cannot act or move, cannot perform the functions\r\nrequired of it by the Constitution; it is to elect Senators and\r\nRepresentatives to the Congress of the United States; to permit the\r\ncourts of the United States to be held within their limits, and its\r\ncitizens to act as jurors and officers of the court; to permit the\r\njudgments and sentences of the court to be executed against its\r\ncitizens; to permit the United States mail to be carried through the\r\nState and its contents distributed according to law; to permit the\r\nofficers of the United States to collect the Federal revenue whether\r\nderived from foreign or domestic products; to permit the United States\r\nto manage and control their own property, whether consisting of forts,\r\ndockyards, arsenals, mints, or public lands; to make such elections of\r\nSenators and Representatives freely and as the means of maintaining\r\nitself as a State in the Union; and to permit all these things willingly\r\nand freely as rights belonging to the Federal Government with which\r\nneither the State government nor the people of the State have any right\r\nwhatever to interfere. In short, to be a State in the Union is to use\r\nall those powers of the State which have a relation to the Federal\r\nGovernment in a manner friendly to that Government, friendly to its\r\nexistence and continuance, in a manner promotive of the objects of that\r\nGovernment; and to permit without hindrance the exercise within the\r\nState of all the powers of the Federal Government.”\r\n\r\nThough he declined to discuss the question whether a State by omitting\r\nto send Representatives and Senators to Congress would on that account\r\ncease to be a member of the Union, he gave it as his opinion that mere\r\nfailure to be represented in Congress would not be followed by such\r\nconsequences; but if a State not only refused to participate in Federal\r\nlegislation but went farther, and as a political community made war upon\r\nthe General Government, he declared that “it would be folly, madness, to\r\nsay that the State was not our enemy in every sense in which that term\r\ncan be employed to describe hostile relations between independent\r\ncommunities.... No one will pretend that such a community is in the\r\nUnion in fact, for that would be to make an admission and in the same\r\nbreath to contradict it. _De facto_, such a community, and, if it be\r\nbounded by State lines, such a State, is as completely out of the Union\r\nas is Canada or Mexico, from the moment it assumes the attitude of\r\nhostility until it is subdued and conquered by our arms, or until it\r\nvoluntarily lays down its arms, ejects its hostile government and\r\nreturns _in fact_ to its once friendly sentiments and friendly relations\r\nto the Federal Government.”\r\n\r\n“Loyalty,” continued Senator Howard, “thus becomes the final test in\r\nsolving the question, what is a State in the Union? If a State by its\r\novert acts has shown a want of this friendship, it is no longer in the\r\nUnion _de facto_, and cannot be treated as if it were. The Supreme\r\nCourt, acting upon the soundest principles of public law, have decided\r\nthe waging of war by a State, although acting under an illegitimate and\r\nrevolutionary government, renders her territory enemy’s territory, and\r\nthe people there resident enemies of the United States, in the sense of\r\nthe laws of war. And their decision could not have been different.”\r\n\r\nThe State, he argued further, was in fact, though wrongfully, out of the\r\nUnion because its actual government was disloyal and treasonable. Out of\r\nit because unsubdued rebellion made it for the time being an independent\r\nthough unrecognized nation on the earth’s surface, throwing off its\r\nallegiance to its paramount Government, and assuming by the sword to\r\nassert its separate nationality.\r\n\r\n“But we are at war with the rebel States, and are told ... that the\r\nGovernment, so far at least as the rebel States are concerned, is under\r\nsome peculiar constitutional restraint by which its hands are tied; that\r\nwe are prohibited from ‘subjugating’ those States; that all we can do,\r\nunder the Constitution, is to break up the military array of the rebels,\r\ndisperse their armed bands, take away their arms, and do that very\r\nindefinite duty, _restore order_; that thereupon our task is ended and\r\nthe rebel States have a constitutional right to come back into the Union\r\nand participate in the enactment of Federal laws and the conduct of the\r\nFederal Government. And we are menaced both in Congress and out with\r\nterrible retributions if we conquer or attempt to conquer, if we\r\nsubjugate or attempt to subjugate, the rebel States. It is admitted by\r\nthese our critics that in an international war ... we should have all\r\nthe rights and powers of other independent nations, and might rightfully\r\nconquer our adversary, ... that we might make a complete conquest of his\r\npeople and his territory....\r\n\r\n“Now, it is lawful to wage such a foreign war, for the purpose of\r\neffectuating such a complete conquest, and of course lawful to attain\r\nit; ... lawful to substitute the political authority of the United\r\nStates for that of a hostile foreign nation;” otherwise, he argued, the\r\nwar could not be a successful one; hence in a war with a member of the\r\nUnion the United States could substitute for the authority of such\r\nhostile commonwealth its own authority. There was no difference between\r\nthe two cases. The former actual hostile government should be supplanted\r\nby the Federal Government. No other government had a right to give the\r\nlaw. Had the conquered rebel people that right? No; for that would be to\r\nallow them at once to expel their conquerors by a popular decree, and to\r\ndeny the supremacy of the Federal Government which had subdued them. Had\r\nthe old State government, he asked, the once loyal government, the right\r\nto govern the conquered people? No; there was no such government. It had\r\nlong since ceased to exist. “In fact, there is no government there, none\r\nat all, which can for a moment be recognized or permitted by the United\r\nStates, as the party now holding the actual mastery of the country; and\r\nlike every other case where the possession of a country has arisen from\r\nthe use of superior force, the will of the conqueror is the law—that is,\r\nthe will of the United States expressed, in the absence of acts of\r\nCongress, by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, but by the acts of\r\nCongress after Congress has spoken.\r\n\r\n“... No one will deny that we have a right to subdue by arms and to\r\nreduce to quietude and submission a rebel State, that is, the people of\r\na State in insurrection. But how absurd to make this concession, and at\r\nthe same time to deny to us the constitutional power to occupy and hold\r\nthe territory and its people in our military grasp—an occupation just as\r\nnecessary to the end in view as the firing of cannon, the charging of\r\ncavalry, or any other operation in the field.\r\n\r\n“... The true objects of the war ... are the suppression of the\r\nrebellion, the reëstablishment of the original Federal authority within\r\nthe State, and the revival of the loyalty of the people of the State as\r\nthe sole foundation and condition of all its civil rights as a State of\r\nthe Union and of the right of its people to be treated as friends and\r\nnot as enemies. Although the United States have the full and complete\r\nright which conquest gives, for the purpose of subjecting these domestic\r\nenemies to the exercise of the powers granted by the Constitution to\r\nCongress, and for the purpose of restoring to the body-politic its vital\r\nblood, loyalty to the Government, yet those purposes, those distinct\r\nends, are without doubt limits beyond which we cannot go. We are\r\nrestrained by the manifest objects for which the national Government was\r\nformed; but restrained by no particular clause of the Constitution. The\r\ninstrument contains no such clause, and the limitation and restraint are\r\nof precisely the same nature as those which any other government is\r\nunder in subduing an insurrection of its own subjects or citizens; the\r\nplain object of the war in both cases being the restoration of\r\nlegitimate authority and the revival of allegiance. And until this\r\nrevival of allegiance there must be the same need of military occupation\r\nand repression in both cases.”\r\n\r\nAfter showing that the existence of the States is indispensable to that\r\nof the Federal Government, he proceeded, “it is not permissible by mere\r\ninterpretation to clothe that Government with a power permanently to\r\nabolish the State government by way of punishing or suppressing the\r\nrebellion; or to convert the States into mere Territories of the United\r\nStates, that is, public domain, to be divided up afterward by lines\r\ndifferent from those of the States, and again admitted into the Union\r\nlike matured Territories, with such new geographical limits as Congress\r\nmay see fit to establish.”\r\n\r\nArticle IV., Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution the Senator\r\nregarded as an express prohibition to change the boundaries of any State\r\nonce in the Union without its consent; “its consent in its capacity as a\r\nState, freely given by its own Legislature.” He believed that the\r\nAmnesty Proclamation of President Lincoln indicated that its author held\r\na different opinion.\r\n\r\nHe rejected the idea that the rebellious States could be converted into\r\nTerritories. This term, under our system, he added, “implies land never\r\nlying in any State, land ceded to the United States either by the old\r\nStates, or purchased or conquered from foreign nations. The term never\r\nhas been used to describe a State or any part of a State; and it implies\r\nnot only the ownership of the soil and right of disposition, but full\r\nand complete political jurisdiction in the Federal Government over the\r\npeople resident there....”\r\n\r\nThe objects of the conquest being as stated above, such forcible\r\noccupation was, he continued, in its very nature temporary and ought to\r\ncease the moment those objects were attained. This could not be done\r\nwithout establishing a government to preserve order, life and property—a\r\nprovisional government, for that is the true historic name to be applied\r\nin all cases where an old government has been overthrown; a provisional\r\ngovernment instituted by the conqueror, and to be continued just so long\r\nas Congress deemed it necessary to continue it for the attainment, and\r\nwhile attaining, those high objects. The occupancy, that is, the\r\npossession of all the reins of local government by the Federal\r\nauthorities would be but temporary, provisional, fiduciary. It should\r\nnecessarily last until the Federal Government had done its duty in the\r\nreëstablishment of order and the revival of loyalty. Until then it was,\r\nand should continue, the omnipotent sovereign of the State, holding\r\nactually by right of conquest, though for a particular purpose, and\r\nbeing itself necessarily the final judge to determine when its tutelary\r\nmission had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nHe avoided, he said, a discussion of the question whether a State can\r\ncommit suicide, that is, extinguish its own being by waging a rebellious\r\nwar against the Federal Government; instead of presenting any such\r\nabstract question of political dialectics, the case, he declared, merely\r\npresented the usual question which arose whenever and wherever there had\r\nbeen a forcible revolution. What, he inquired, was the duty of the\r\nparamount and lawful government in its treatment of insurgent\r\ncommunities? And was not the Government doing its whole duty in\r\npunishing the ringleaders in the revolt and restoring the old and\r\nconstitutional Government over those districts?\r\n\r\nThe Government, Mr. Howard proceeded, must be the final judge of the\r\nduration of this military occupation. It was bound by the plain terms of\r\nthe Constitution not only to suppress the insurrection, which was done\r\nthe moment it had obtained firm possession of the whole of the hostile\r\nterritory, but to guarantee to the conquered State a republican form of\r\ngovernment. To perform this high and sacred trust, time of course was\r\nnecessary; likewise a great variety of means and instrumentalities, “of\r\nall which the Government of the United States must, because it has no\r\nsuperior, no equal in the matter, be the sole and final judge. These\r\nmeans may embrace acts of provisional legislation, creating private\r\nrights and duties not previously in existence, but existing by law and\r\nof a permanent nature, paramount to all subsequent State legislation\r\nbecause arising under the supreme authority of the nation, as, for\r\ninstance, the giving freedom to slaves; or they may undoubtedly embrace\r\nconditions to be performed by the subdued States on taking their places\r\nagain in the Union, such as would be an ordinance forever abolishing\r\nslavery in the State....\r\n\r\n“Yet while thus in our military power, awaiting our action, looking to\r\ntheir restoration, nothing is clearer than that the citizens of the\r\nrebel States, though owing obedience to all the laws of the United\r\nStates, possess no political rights under the Constitution except\r\nprotection. They are not free to act, because their freedom to act\r\nwould, if indulged, lead them again to draw the sword against the United\r\nStates.... They have no right to send members to this body or to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, much less to participate in the election of\r\nPresident and Vice-President. They are the ward-provinces of the United\r\nStates, progressing toward the maturity of revived loyalty, but not yet\r\nentitled to exercise the elective franchise or to participate in the\r\nenactment of laws.\r\n\r\n“If I am asked what I mean by the Government of the United States, and\r\nwhether I mean that the President as Commander-in-Chief has the\r\nexclusive power to establish these provisional governments, I answer, I\r\ndo not. He has the right to regulate military occupation until Congress\r\nhas acted upon the subject; ... but the establishment of provisional\r\ngovernments, the quieting of the rebellious province and the\r\nreëstablishment of legitimate authority over it, pertains to the\r\nsovereign power, that is, the law-giving power of the nation. With us\r\nthat power is lodged in Congress and not in the President; and in my\r\nopinion it is the business of Congress, and Congress alone, to establish\r\nand uphold these provisional governments.... We need not doubt that\r\nwhatever we see fit to enact will be approved and carried out by the\r\nPresident. We cannot be more truly anxious than he to fix upon a stable,\r\nfirm policy for restoring peace and union; but we ought not to shut our\r\neyes to the necessities he will continually be under, to the almost\r\nirresistible importunities he will encounter, to provide some sort of\r\ncivil government for the subdued States or districts; or to the\r\nconsequences of leaving such mighty questions for him to decide. It is\r\nour plain duty to establish a uniform rule on the subject, so that all\r\nmay be treated alike and the same remedy be applied with a paternal but\r\nfirm and resolute hand to each delinquent State.”\r\n\r\nHe opposed for two reasons the “scheme” of allowing one tenth or any\r\nother minor part of the male citizens of a commonwealth to organize a\r\ngovernment and assume to act as a State: first, “because as against the\r\nwill of an actual majority the government of such a minority must\r\nnecessarily come to a speedy end and thus invite a renewal of the civil\r\nwar, in that locality at least; and second, because government by a\r\nminority is of evil example and inconsistent with the genius of American\r\nliberty.... As a Republican I would sooner hazard ten slaveholders’\r\nrebellions than risk liberty in a government by a minority.” In this\r\nconnection he assigned an additional motive for his attitude toward the\r\nresolution. The will of the friendly element, he said, could prevail\r\nonly by military support, and such an organization, if intended as a\r\ncivil government, was not republican in the sense of the Constitution.\r\nWhen such aid was withdrawn the majority, he asserted, would wreak\r\nvengeance on the weakened minority.\r\n\r\nConcluding this part of his argument, he added: “The measure now before\r\nyou proposes to acknowledge eight thousand citizens of Louisiana as a\r\nState, and to give them the rights and privileges exercised by a voting\r\npopulation of more than fifty thousand in 1860. Eight thousand are thus\r\nto give the law or assume to give it to forty-two thousand—to more than\r\nfive times their number. This they may do so long as their decrees are\r\nsustained by the presence and consent of a competent military force; but\r\nwe all know, both parties there know, the world knows, and, sir,\r\nposterity will know, that it is not the eight thousand who govern the\r\nState, but the fear of the bayonet, and the fear is inspired solely by\r\nthe President of the United States, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army\r\nand Navy! Disguise it, or attempt to disguise it, as we may, to this\r\ncomplexion doth it come at last. Yes, sir, both the eight thousand and\r\nthe forty-two thousand voters are governed not by themselves, but by the\r\nbayonet! And this is at present the only government in Louisiana. The\r\nobject of the present measure is to continue this hybrid, unnatural\r\ngovernment there. It allows the meager and almost contemptible\r\nproportion of less than one sixth of the voting population to govern the\r\nwhole State, and to have the influence of the whole State in our\r\nlegislation here, while we know that if the military forces were\r\nwithdrawn that privileged one sixth part would be swept away like chaff\r\nbefore the hurricane breath of the enraged majority. Sir, such a\r\ngovernment is the merest bubble, especially if unsustained by military\r\npower. This is too obvious to need further comment.”\r\n\r\n“All this we might possibly endure,” continued Senator Howard, “were it\r\nnot that the measure before us clothes this mockery of a government,\r\nthis king of shreds and patches, this mistletoe State _régime_ that\r\nfalls to the earth the moment it ceases to cling around the flag-staff\r\nof the national forces, with the high attribute of voting upon and\r\ndetermining questions of legislation, questions of war or peace,\r\nquestions of prosecuting or ceasing to prosecute the present war, in\r\nthis Hall and in the Hall of the House of Representatives. This measure\r\nintroduces here Senators and Representatives whose immediate friends and\r\nrelatives at home have deliberately aided and assisted to put to death\r\nmyriads of Union soldiers from the North, and in swelling up that vast\r\ndebt of more than two thousand million dollars which now rests upon the\r\ncountry. Think you that such Senators and Representatives, whose\r\nconstituents have already been stripped of their property by the rebel\r\ngovernment, and brought down to the depths of poverty; a community\r\nwithout the habits of labor among the intelligent classes; naked,\r\nhungry, despondent and sullen; think you that their Representatives\r\nwould at the present time be safe depositories of the power to tax their\r\nconstituents to pay this debt? Is it not, on the other hand, the part of\r\nprudence to guard against the contingency of having that debt repudiated\r\nby such legislators and the still more disgraceful contingency of being,\r\nby their votes, aided by a Northern party, finally compelled to pay the\r\nrebel debt of $4,000,000,000? And tell me, what right has Louisiana, the\r\nmajority of whose population is to-day, wherever they are, hostile to\r\nthis Government and anxious for its overthrow; what right has she, upon\r\nany recognized principle of public law or justice, to be represented in\r\nCongress?”\r\n\r\nThe treatment accorded Louisiana would, he feared, be a precedent for\r\nthe ten remaining States. There would be the expense of holding each for\r\na time in military occupation to bolster up their State governments. He\r\npreferred for Louisiana and the other insurgent States a provisional\r\nestablishment for regulating domestic affairs, but without\r\nrepresentation in Congress until the mass of their people plainly\r\nperceived their error in attempting to overthrow the General Government.\r\n\r\nCongress should, he thought, take the subject of readmission into their\r\nown hands. It was for them and not for the President to execute the\r\nimportant guaranty to each State of a republican form of government, and\r\nthat duty became more and more urgent as the Federal armies swept on\r\nfrom victory to victory. In making good that guaranty the great\r\nindispensable necessity, he declared, was loyalty.[410]\r\n\r\nMr. Howard was followed immediately by Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, who\r\nto the great surprise of his fellow-Democrats argued in favor of the\r\nresolution. His remarks were introduced by a concise statement of the\r\nchief political events occurring in Louisiana between the capture of New\r\nOrleans and the ratification, in September, 1864, of the new\r\nconstitution. Concluding this part of his speech he said:\r\n\r\n“These, sir, are the facts. The Committee on the Judiciary—and in the\r\nconclusion to which they came I concurred—were of opinion that under the\r\ncircumstances in which the State was at the period when these\r\nproceedings were had, she could not be recognized as a State of the\r\nUnited States under that constitution adopted in 1864, except by an act\r\nof Congress. The committee were of opinion that it was not in the power\r\nof the Executive under the circumstances to bring the State back under\r\nthat constitution. They were of opinion, however, that it was competent\r\nfor Congress to do so, and the only question before the Committee was,\r\nwhether, under the circumstances under which the State was at the time,\r\nit was not the duty of Congress to bring the State back so as to have\r\nher represented in the Union.”\r\n\r\nHis objection to the conclusion of the committee was that the\r\nproceedings which led to the adoption of the constitution were\r\ninstituted at the instance and under the power of the Federal military\r\nauthorities. The precedent, he admitted, was really a bad one, and the\r\nproposition upon which the committee were called to decide was whether,\r\nif they were satisfied that the number of votes said to have been cast\r\nwere in fact cast, and the persons voting were loyal citizens, they\r\nshould be denied the privilege of being represented in the councils of\r\nthe nation and subjected to a continuance of military power. Mr. Johnson\r\nadded: “My impression is that, no matter how the proceedings were\r\ninstituted, whether it was by the military authority, or by the coming\r\ntogether of the people of the State, if in point of fact the people of\r\nthe State did act voluntarily and were competent to act under the\r\noriginal constitution, and were authorized to act by being loyal at the\r\ntime they did act, it is the duty of the government of the United States\r\nto receive them back.\r\n\r\n“Another objection was that, however true it might be that it would be\r\nin the power of all the voters of the State to adopt a constitution for\r\nthemselves, or to claim the right of coming back to the Union under the\r\nconstitution existing at the time of the rebellion, it was not true that\r\nit was in the power of fourteen [eleven] thousand, four hundred and\r\nfourteen voters, when the entire voting population of the State was\r\nfifty-one thousand, to take that course. As it seemed to me then, and\r\nseems now, there is no evidence to show that a single citizen of\r\nLouisiana was excluded from the right of voting.”\r\n\r\nIt was not so certain, he argued further, that the eleven thousand\r\nvoters who participated were not a large majority of the actual electors\r\nin Louisiana, for the war engaged the greater part of the voting\r\npopulation, and nine tenths of those who entered the Confederate service\r\nhad forfeited their lives upon the battlefield; of those above or below\r\nthe military age many had gone elsewhere, or if they remained in the\r\nState it was as disloyal citizens.\r\n\r\nIt was not pretended, he said, in discussing the relation of the loyal\r\nminority to the General Government, that by the act of secession they\r\nceased to be citizens of the United States. Their fidelity to the Union\r\nentitled them to Federal protection. If loyal, they had forfeited no\r\nrights belonging to them before the commencement of the rebellion. No\r\nFederal law had been violated, no constitutional obligation evaded by\r\nthem. They could not ask admission into the Union, because to speak such\r\na desire was to subject themselves to punishment; when the protection of\r\nthe United States was afforded them and they could once more declare\r\ntheir sentiments without hazard they met at their several election\r\npolls, organized their government under existing law, and then, wishing\r\nto change it, met in convention and adopted the constitution which had\r\nbeen submitted to the Senate. “Why,” inquired Mr. Johnson, “should we\r\nnot receive it?” The right of eleven thousand citizens to change their\r\nconstitution was not denied, but their action was questioned because\r\nthere were others, then in arms against the Government of the United\r\nStates, who did not join them in asserting it. In examining the question\r\nwho were to exercise the authority of the State, he argued: “Now, if it\r\nbe true that the secession ordinance had no operation to carry the State\r\nout, and that I understand even the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr.\r\nSumner] admitted last night; if it be true that the State is in the\r\nUnion notwithstanding the ordinance, then the only question to be\r\nconsidered is, who are the people of Louisiana that are to exercise the\r\nsovereign authority belonging to the State of Louisiana? Are they the\r\nloyal or the disloyal? There can be but one answer to that inquiry. It\r\nmust only be the loyal.”\r\n\r\nSenator Howard admitted, continued Mr. Johnson, that it is not in the\r\npower of the United States to change the territorial limits of the\r\nStates that had gone out, because the Constitution prohibits it. If he\r\nhad thought for a moment he would have seen that the Constitution\r\nequally prohibits any interference on the part of the General Government\r\nwith the exercise of the right of suffrage in a State. He then combated\r\nat some length the intimation of Senators Howard and Sumner that any\r\npower without a State had a right to prescribe qualifications for the\r\nexercise of the suffrage.\r\n\r\nMr. Powell, too, concurred in this view and asked by what authority\r\nGeneral Banks and the President undertook to prescribe the\r\nqualifications of voters in Louisiana. The Maryland Senator replied that\r\nthis question had been anticipated. The eleven thousand four hundred and\r\nfourteen voters, according to the proof before the Senate, were all\r\nloyal men and entitled to vote by the original constitution of\r\nLouisiana, no matter how they were brought together. If, coming\r\ntogether, they did an act which they would have been authorized to do if\r\nthey had come together voluntarily they ought to be received.\r\n\r\nPowell then inquired, what right had the Senate to presume that there\r\nmay not have been twelve thousand loyal voters in Louisiana who were\r\ndeprived of the right of suffrage because of this order of General\r\nBanks? As the Kentucky Senator understood it, no man could vote “unless\r\nhe would go forward and take the oath prescribed by the President and\r\nswear to support and sustain all proclamations in regard to African\r\nslavery already issued and all that might afterward be issued.” Mr.\r\nJohnson acknowledged this difficulty and admitted that he had always\r\nfelt it; but they had the same difficulty, he asserted, in his own\r\nState, and a much greater one; he would be sorry to think Maryland was\r\nnot in the Union. “Maryland is in the Union,” said Senator Powell. “The\r\nconstitution,” observed Johnson in reply, “which now makes her a State\r\nin the Union was adopted the other day. I mean the one which governs\r\nher. She has manumitted her slaves by force of that constitution. No man\r\nin Maryland seriously contests the obligation of that constitution in\r\nthat particular or in any other. But it was adopted, in fact, by the\r\nexclusion of a good many men who were entitled to vote.”\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson at this point became engaged in an argument, not wholly\r\nrelevant, with Sumner in which he gained some advantage over the\r\nMassachusetts Senator. As a specimen of the latter’s parliamentary\r\ntactics at this time it may not be irrelevant to reproduce a passage\r\nfrom the _Congressional Globe_.\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Sumner.= Allow me to ask the Senator [Johnson] whether, in his\r\n  opinion, the Ordinance governing the Northwest Territory,\r\n  prohibiting slavery everywhere throughout that Territory, and which\r\n  was declared to be a perpetual compact, could be set aside by any\r\n  one of the States in the Territory now.\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Johnson.= I certainly think they can, except so far as rights\r\n  are vested.\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Sumner.= The Senator, then, thinks Ohio can enslave a\r\n  fellow-man?\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Johnson.= Just as much as Massachusetts can.\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Sumner.= Massachusetts cannot.\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Johnson.= Why not?\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Sumner.= Massachusetts cannot do an act of injustice.\r\n\r\n  =Mr. Johnson.= Oh, indeed! I did not know that. [Laughter.][411]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this claim for his native State Sumner admitted a moment\r\nlater that Massachusetts had united in the Convention of 1787 with South\r\nCarolina to deny to Congress authority to prohibit the slave trade for\r\ntwenty years, and he confessed that such action was unjust. His\r\ninconsistency was still further exposed by Senator Henderson, who called\r\nattention to the fact that the educational qualification imposed by the\r\nMassachusetts constitution would exclude from the franchise almost every\r\nnegro in Louisiana if the provisions were applicable in the latter\r\nState.[412]\r\n\r\nAfter this colloquy, not uninteresting to the student of constitutional\r\nhistory, the Maryland Senator resumed his remarks:\r\n\r\n“One word more, sir, and I have done. If Congress passes this\r\nresolution, and the State is admitted, no court will hereafter be able\r\nto decide that she is not a State in the Union, and no court therefore\r\ncan call in question the validity or effect of any provision to be found\r\nin her constitution. One of the provisions of this constitution is that\r\nall the slaves of Louisiana are emancipated. Pass this resolution, admit\r\nthe State, and that provision is effectual at once.”[413]\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner, having in mind the fundamental condition imposed by Congress\r\nupon the admission of Missouri, offered the following amendment of the\r\nresolution from the Committee on the Judiciary:\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, That this shall not take effect except upon the\r\n  fundamental condition that within the State there shall be no denial\r\n  of the electoral franchise, or of any other rights on account of\r\n  color or race, but all persons shall be equal before the law. And\r\n  the Legislature of the State, by a solemn public act, shall declare\r\n  the assent of the State to this fundamental condition, and shall\r\n  transmit to the President of the United States an authentic copy of\r\n  such assent whenever the same shall be adopted, upon the receipt\r\n  whereof he shall, by proclamation, announce the fact; whereupon,\r\n  without any further proceedings on the part of Congress, this joint\r\n  resolution shall take effect.[414]\r\n\r\nThough Senator Clark favored the principle of Sumner’s amendment, he\r\nopposed it, as it stood, because it affected a resolution which proposed\r\n“to recognize the government in the State of Louisiana,” which in his\r\njudgment was still a State in the Union, “having its constitution\r\noverthrown, but desiring and attempting to establish a new” one; and he\r\nadded, “I hold that we have no power to amend that constitution; and\r\nthat is the reason why I shall be obliged to vote against it here.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke for the adoption of Trumbull’s resolution and, in doing so,\r\ntraveled some of the ground gone over by Henderson. The government of\r\nLouisiana, Mr. Clark believed, belonged to the Union people. He was not\r\naware that any definite number of persons was required to constitute a\r\nState, nor did he understand how the majority by going into rebellion\r\ncould take away the rights of the loyal minority.\r\n\r\nThe guaranty of a republican form of government was made, he asserted,\r\nto meet precisely such a case as had arisen in Louisiana. In this view\r\nit became the duty of Congress to protect the government established by\r\nthe minority.[415]\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy, speaking to the principle of Sumner’s amendment, declared\r\nthat he would vote against all measures that looked like Congressional\r\ninterference with the right to vote in the States. Saulsbury interrupted\r\nhim to inquire what he would have done had the President, or his\r\nSecretary of War, sent armed soldiers to the polls and imposed a test\r\nupon voters as was done in Delaware, where Democrats were chased into\r\nswamps and compelled in the night time to lie out in the snow. Pomeroy’s\r\nonly reply to this was to relate his own experience under Democratic\r\nsupremacy in the early days of Kansas. He resumed his remarks on\r\nLouisiana, but these had been anticipated by the speakers who preceded\r\nhim. In conclusion he asserted that there were two reasons for\r\nrecognizing Arkansas where there was but one in favor of Louisiana.[416]\r\n\r\nThe Delaware Senator did not fail to call attention to Pomeroy’s\r\nevasion, and said he was glad to observe a change in the spirit of some\r\nof his Republican friends. “I think,” he said, “they begin to scent the\r\ndanger in the distance; that they begin to see that if a Government of\r\nlaw is to be destroyed, and power is to be concentrated in Executive\r\nhands, or in the hands of Executive agents, there is an end of liberty\r\nin this country. I hail the dawn, therefore, of a better day.”[417]\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson again entered into the discussion, and in the course of\r\nhis remarks drew from Senator Sumner this remarkable statement\r\nconcerning Louisiana: “It is in and it is not. [Laughter.] The territory\r\nis in; but as yet there is no State government that is in.” In this\r\ndiscussion Sumner asserted also that when the bill of his friend Senator\r\nWade was before Congress no one questioned its constitutionality though\r\nit proposed to interfere in the suffrage and to impose a condition upon\r\nStates at the time of their reconstruction. Pomeroy dissented from the\r\ndoctrine that Congress could reconstruct the insurgent States, and\r\nmaintained that the only question then was whether they would recognize\r\nwhat the people of Louisiana had done.\r\n\r\nReverdy Johnson pointed out to Sumner the great increase of\r\nrepresentation in Congress which the South would acquire by an extension\r\nof the suffrage to negroes. The three fifths provision, he said, would\r\nbe done away with, and he made the further observation that for years to\r\ncome the entire colored vote of that section would be in the hands of a\r\nfew white men. He urged recognition of both Louisiana and Arkansas, so\r\nthat the constitutional amendment would become binding, for unless\r\nratified by three fourths of all the States it would be open to doubt.\r\n\r\nThe session was drawing rapidly toward its close; it was late in the\r\nevening of February 25, and the resolution under discussion was too\r\nimportant to be passed without due consideration. These circumstances\r\noffered Mr. Wade, who vehemently opposed the measure, a decent pretext\r\nfor demanding the “yeas” and “nays” on his motion to postpone the\r\nsubject till the first Monday of December following, 1865.\r\n\r\nBefore a vote was reached on this motion, however, Powell spoke again at\r\nconsiderable length. In addition to his former arguments, many of which\r\nwere repeated, he said that “all the loyal Union men in the State of\r\nLouisiana who refused, like supple menials and slaves, to crouch beneath\r\nthe iron military power of General Banks, and take that oath were\r\nexcluded from voting,” and he added, “I believe to-day there are more\r\nmen of that description in Louisiana than voted to ratify this\r\nconstitution.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked by Mr. Henderson whether he had heard of any objection to it\r\non the part of the loyal men of Louisiana, Powell answered that Thomas\r\nJ. Durant and thirty-one others, distinguished, leading, loyal men of\r\nthat State, had made earnest and powerful protest against it, and\r\nremonstrated against the admission to Congress of Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from Louisiana. They were also opposed to counting her\r\nelectoral vote. Mr. Durant, he believed, was the first district-attorney\r\nappointed in Louisiana by the present Executive. Henderson insinuated by\r\nan inquiry that Durant was himself a candidate for office at that\r\nelection and took the oath prescribed. Powell not being informed on\r\nthese points, the matter was left in doubt.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky Senator took this opportunity to characterize the manner of\r\nGeneral Banks in his statement before the Judiciary Committee as that of\r\na “swift witness, to make a case that he thought would cause Louisiana\r\nto be admitted.” He also called upon some advocate of the resolution to\r\nexplain a support of the present measure after voting a few days before\r\nfor the resolution declaring that the electoral vote of Louisiana should\r\nnot be counted. If Louisiana was then a legitimate government, why, he\r\nasked, was she not entitled to cast her electoral vote? He did not then\r\nbelieve it a legitimate government and so opposed the counting of her\r\nelectoral vote; but the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Johnson] and the\r\nSenator from Missouri [Mr. Henderson], who then voted with him, now\r\nsupported the resolution.[418]\r\n\r\nWade’s motion to postpone further consideration of the joint resolution\r\ntill the first Monday of December was defeated by a vote of 17 to\r\n12.[419]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the discussions to postpone Sumner said that he would\r\nregard its passage as a national calamity. It would be the political\r\nBull Run of that Administration, sacrificing, as it would, a great cause\r\nand the great destinies of this Republic. When Trumbull taxed him with\r\nintent to postpone discussion by dilatory motions the Massachusetts\r\nSenator admitted his opposition and declared that to defeat the measure\r\nhe would employ any weapon in the arsenal of parliamentary warfare.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Administration endeavored to press their adversaries\r\nto take final action on the resolution. The earnestness of the two\r\nfactions provoked rather sharp censure of Sumner and the few Republicans\r\nwho acted with him and were attempting by dilatory motions to fatigue\r\nthe Senate into a postponement. Doolittle was especially severe on them,\r\nand particularly on Sumner, who replied with much asperity. He was\r\nsupported by Howard and Chandler, while Trumbull, Foster and Doolittle\r\nundertook a defence of the resolution and its advocates. This wrangling\r\nappears to have delighted the Democratic members. Mr. Hendricks, indeed,\r\nmade no attempt to conceal his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“The discordant elements of the Republican party are exhibiting\r\nthemselves here,” said the Indiana Senator, “and I venture the prophecy\r\nthat a like exhibition will be witnessed over the country within a very\r\nfew years. But four years ago, at the Chicago Convention, when Mr.\r\nLincoln was nominated for the Presidency a solemn pledge was made to the\r\npeople of this country that that party, when it came into power, would\r\nnot undertake to interfere with the institutions of the States. As soon\r\nas the disturbed condition of the country gave the pretext for it, the\r\nundertaking was commenced; and now, when, in the judgment of some, it\r\nhas been accomplished, there comes up the grave question, what is to be\r\ndone, and what is to be the political condition of the four million\r\nnegroes when they are set free? And upon that question the real strife\r\nof to-night has been witnessed. That is the subject and it need not be\r\ndisguised. It is growing out of the discordant elements of the party\r\nthat now governs the country.”[420]\r\n\r\nTrumbull, in reply to an inquiry of Senator Wade, said that he had voted\r\nagainst receiving the electoral vote of Louisiana because it had not\r\nbeen recognized. Now he proposed to put it in a condition where it could\r\ncast electoral votes, and do all other acts belonging to a State.\r\n\r\nTo this Wade replied that “If the President of the United States,\r\noperating through his major-generals, can initiate a State government,\r\nand can bring it here and force us, compel us, to receive as associates\r\non this floor these mere mockeries, these men of straw who represent\r\nnobody, your Republic is at an end.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I have heard a great deal about this pretended election in\r\nLouisiana that did not come from Major-General Banks, and I pronounce\r\nthe proceeding a mockery. It is not pretended that there could be\r\ndrummed up from the riffraff of New Orleans and sent into the vicinity\r\nunder the mandate of a Major-General more than about six thousand votes,\r\nwhere over fifty thousand were formerly polled.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Talk not to me of your ten per cent. principle. A more absurd,\r\nmonarchical, and anti-American principle was never announced on God’s\r\nearth——“[421]\r\n\r\nAt this point Senator Sherman, of Ohio, interposed to obtain\r\nconsideration for a revenue measure which he had in charge, whereupon\r\nhis colleague changed somewhat the declamation against the resolution to\r\na denunciation of its advocates, especially Trumbull, upon whom he\r\nretorted the charge of retarding legitimate business. Howard resented\r\nthe charge of radical factiousness and denounced Trumbull with\r\nconsiderable warmth. Sherman suggested that enough had been said on both\r\nsides, and in the lighter skirmishing of the breathing-spell which\r\nfollowed, Mr. Sprague, of Rhode Island, hitherto a silent spectator of\r\nthese exciting scenes, declared that he held in his possession a paper\r\nindicating the names of the members of the Louisiana Legislature, and it\r\nshowed that twenty-five, or twenty-seven or thirty of those gentlemen\r\nwho constituted that assembly were officeholders of the Federal\r\nGovernment, or the government of the State, which, he said, was the same\r\nthing.[422]\r\n\r\nWhile Sherman’s measure and Trumbull’s resolution were competing for\r\npriority of consideration Sumner remarked that during the preceding\r\nsummer, 1864, he had met a distinguished gentleman just returned from\r\nLouisiana; he had been present at some of the sittings of the\r\nconvention, having been in New Orleans in discharge of important public\r\nduties. This gentleman, added Sumner, said compendiously that the\r\nconvention was “nothing but a stupendous hoax.”\r\n\r\nWhen Reverdy Johnson inquired the name of Sumner’s informant, Senator\r\nGrimes replied that he could furnish a large number of names of persons\r\npresent in New Orleans when the convention was held, and added: “If the\r\nSenate will give a committee I will undertake to prove and I will prove\r\nthat the voters whose votes were polled in the outlying parishes at\r\nThibodeaux and Placquemines, and other places, were carried in army\r\ntransports to those places where they polled the votes, being discharged\r\nsoldiers and persons belonging in New Orleans, and were brought back to\r\nNew Orleans, and were not residents of the places where they purported\r\nto vote.”[423]\r\n\r\nSumner, immediately after the uncontroverted statement of Mr. Grimes,\r\nadded, with more energy than elegance: “The pretended State government\r\nin Louisiana is utterly indefensible whether you look at its origin or\r\nits character. To describe it, I must use plain language. It is a mere\r\nseven-months’ abortion, begotten by the bayonet in criminal conjunction\r\nwith the spirit of caste, and born before its time, rickety, unformed,\r\nunfinished—whose continued existence will be a burden, a reproach, and a\r\nwrong. That is the whole case; and yet the Senator from Illinois now\r\npresses it upon the Senate at this moment to the exclusion of the\r\nimportant public business of the country.”[424]\r\n\r\nThe urgency of the army and navy appropriation bills prevented for the\r\ntime further consideration of the Louisiana question. The subject,\r\nhowever, was again brought before the Senate on March 2, 1865, by Mr.\r\nDoolittle, who had received and had been requested to file with the\r\nsecretary of the Senate a certificate, under seal of the State of\r\nLouisiana, of the election of Michael Hahn as a Senator of the United\r\nStates from the State of Louisiana for six years from March 4, 1865. Mr.\r\nDavis, of Kentucky, opposed its reception. Doolittle’s motion to have it\r\nlaid on the table and filed was, however, agreed to.\r\n\r\nOnly two days of the session remained; in the temper of the Senate it\r\nwas impossible that the resolution could pass at that time, and the\r\nHouse had not yet taken it up for discussion. In these circumstances the\r\nmeasure was abandoned, though very reluctantly, by its champions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 399:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part II., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 1395.\r\n\r\nFootnote 400:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 971–974.\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  Ibid., p. 903.\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part II., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 1011.\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  Globe, Part I., 2 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 1061–1064.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  While this chapter was in press an interesting letter from Senator\r\n  Henderson informed the author that the Hon.

The State of Tennessee, too, as we have seen,\r\nwas not named in the edict of freedom; that was published by the\r\nPresident simply as a measure of military necessity, and was not\r\nregarded by him or by others as operative to prevent, when war had\r\nceased, a revival of servitude in the insurgent States, for negroes\r\ncould easily be imported from those loyal commonwealths still tolerating\r\nthat institution. It was uncertain, too, how the proclamation would\r\naffect the status of slaves in those districts not yet overrun by the\r\nUnion armies. In the border States, in Tennessee and in the excepted\r\nparts of Louisiana and Virginia there were probably 2,000,000 men in\r\nbondage. In order, then, to abolish universally as well as permanently\r\nto prohibit involuntary servitude an amendment of the Constitution was\r\nproposed in the familiar language of the sixth section of the ordinance\r\nof 1787. Though it passed the Senate, April 8, 1864, it failed at that\r\ntime to receive in the House the requisite two thirds vote. It has been\r\nseen how upon the recommendation of Mr. Lincoln it was reconsidered and\r\npassed by the Representatives at a succeeding session, January 31, 1865,\r\nand submitted to the States for their action. It was adopted by his own\r\nState, Illinois, on the following day. By the close of February sixteen\r\nothers had followed its example, and before the President’s death twenty\r\nin all had ratified the Amendment. To Mr. Lincoln, who had long held\r\nanti-slavery opinions, this expression of public sentiment was extremely\r\ngrateful; indeed, less than two months before his assassination he\r\ndeclared his satisfaction at the popular verdict, and his confidence\r\nthat the States would consummate what Congress had so nobly begun. The\r\nThirteenth Amendment, however, was not announced as part of the organic\r\nlaw until after the Presidential plan of reconstruction had been ignored\r\nby the Thirty-ninth Congress. This subject, therefore, need not be\r\nfurther discussed in these pages.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary amount of work actually completed by the national\r\nLegislature can be comprehended only by considering the degree of\r\nperfection to which the committee system has been carried under\r\ncongressional government. Measures that conduct the reader over vast\r\nstretches of the records of Congress occupy but a day or two in the\r\ncalendar. The discussions described in the two preceding chapters did\r\nnot, as might be supposed, engage the entire attention of Federal\r\nlegislators. It was desirable, if, indeed, it was not essential, that\r\nthe sentiments of the lawmaking body of the nation be authoritatively\r\ndeclared on the question of admitting members to Congress from those\r\nStates reconstituted under the Executive plan; definitive action in the\r\nmatter of the electoral votes which they presented was also awaited with\r\nnot a little interest. Scarcely inferior in importance and more\r\ninstructive than these measures was the passage of an act, approved\r\nMarch 3, 1865, which created in the War Department a “Bureau of\r\nRefugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands.” As the system of relief then\r\ninaugurated was destined to become an important agency in the work of\r\nreconstruction a brief account of its origin and institution may not be\r\ndeemed superfluous.\r\n\r\nA former chapter has related how great numbers of “contrabands,” by\r\nassembling early in the war at Fortress Monroe and Newport News, taxed\r\nthe ingenuity of even General Butler to provide for their maintenance;\r\nit also noticed an attempt under Mr. E. L. Pierce to improve the\r\ncondition of abandoned slaves in South Carolina, and the friendly\r\ninterest of Secretary Chase in that experiment. But the hundreds of\r\nfugitives within Federal lines in May, 1861, had grown to be millions by\r\nthe beginning of 1865. Of this army of homeless freedmen the policy of\r\nenlisting colored troops provided directly for nearly 200,000\r\nable-bodied males. The women, the children and the large class\r\nunsuitable for military service left a multitude still unprovided for.\r\nSome relief, it is true, was afforded by the Treasury Department, which\r\nundertook to establish on abandoned and confiscated lands colonies of\r\nself-supporting negroes, but the ignorance and rapacity of many persons\r\nentrusted with the supervision of this work led to its general failure.\r\nHere and there, indeed, more satisfactory results were obtained, though\r\nthese isolated successes seldom reached the point of actual\r\nencouragement. The South Carolina experiment may, therefore, be properly\r\nregarded as the germ of the Freedmen’s Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe progress of these communities had been watched anxiously by the\r\nabolition and the kindred associations which sprang up to continue the\r\nwork that anti-slavery men had begun. On this subject a committee\r\nrepresenting the Freedmen’s Aid Societies of Boston, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia and Cincinnati addressed, December 1, 1863, an able\r\nmemorial to the President. Without expressing a favorable opinion of the\r\nplan suggested by the petitioners, Mr. Lincoln referred the question, as\r\none of great magnitude and importance, to the consideration of Congress.\r\nThe Freedmen’s Aid Societies, however, had been anticipated by\r\nRepresentative Eliot, of Massachusetts, who had offered, January 12,\r\n1863, a bill to establish a Bureau of Emancipation, which was referred\r\nto a select committee; but other business, regarded as more urgent,\r\nprevented them from reporting at that time a measure which had been\r\nprepared. At the succeeding session the proposition was offered again.\r\nAfter numerous efforts to secure favorable action, efforts extending\r\nover a period of two years, Congress took the subject into\r\nconsideration. The House proposed one, the Senate a different measure; a\r\ncommittee of conference suggested something unlike either, though\r\nembodying important features of both. This, like every proposition\r\naffecting the negro, encountered considerable opposition. The creation\r\nof such a bureau, said its adversaries, conceded the very point that\r\npro-slavery men had always maintained; namely, that the negro was\r\nincapable of taking care of himself. The extent of its powers, its\r\nduration and the cost of its maintenance were successively made grounds\r\nof opposition by those hostile to its establishment. Nor did its enemies\r\nfail to point out the great temptation to abuse which was offered by the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe act established in the War Department, to continue during the\r\nrebellion and for one year thereafter, a bureau to which should be\r\ncommitted the management of all confiscated or abandoned lands, and the\r\ncontrol of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from any\r\ndistrict within the territory embraced in the operations of the army,\r\nunder such regulations as might be adopted by the head of the bureau and\r\napproved by the President.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the bureau was entrusted to a commissioner appointed by\r\nthe President with the concurrence of the Senate. In the exercise of his\r\nfunctions he was to be assisted by such clerks as the Secretary of War\r\nmight assign him; their number, of course, was limited by law. For his\r\ncompensation the head of the new bureau was to receive a sum fixed at\r\n$3,000 per annum. To aid in executing the provisions of the act the\r\nPresident was authorized to select, by and with the advice and consent\r\nof the Senate, one assistant commissioner for each of the States\r\ndeclared to be in insurrection, not, however, to exceed ten in number,\r\neach to receive an annual salary of $2,500.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War, besides assigning clerks of the several grades\r\nmentioned in the law, was authorized to issue, under regulations which\r\nhe might himself prescribe, such provisions, clothing and fuel as might\r\nbe deemed needful for the immediate and temporary shelter and supply of\r\ndestitute and suffering refugees and freedmen as well as their wives and\r\nchildren. Any military officer could be detailed to duty under the act,\r\nbut without increase of pay or allowances.\r\n\r\nIt was further provided that the commissioner, “under the direction of\r\nthe President, shall have authority to set apart, for the use of loyal\r\nrefugees and freedmen, such tracts of land within the insurrectionary\r\nStates as shall have been abandoned, or to which the United States shall\r\nhave acquired title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise, and to every\r\nmale citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as aforesaid, there shall be\r\nassigned not more than forty acres of such land, and the person to whom\r\nit was so assigned shall be protected in the use and enjoyment of the\r\nland for the term of three years at an annual rent not exceeding six per\r\ncentum upon the value of said land, as it was appraised by the State\r\nauthorities in the year 1860, for the purpose of taxation, and in case\r\nno such appraisal can be found, then the rental shall be based upon the\r\nestimated value of the land in said year, to be ascertained in such\r\nmanner as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe. At the end of\r\nsaid term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of any parcels\r\nso assigned may purchase the land, and receive such title thereto as the\r\nUnited States can convey, upon paying therefor the value of the land, as\r\nascertained and fixed for the purpose of determining the annual rent\r\naforesaid.”[425]\r\n\r\nIt was made the duty of the assistant commissioners to submit a\r\nquarterly report of their proceedings to the commissioner, who in turn\r\nwas required to report annually to the President before the commencement\r\nof each regular session of Congress. Special reports might from time to\r\ntime be requested of either the head of the bureau or his subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe bureau thus established was organized principally by officers of the\r\nregular army under direction of General Oliver O. Howard, who had been\r\nselected by President Johnson as commissioner. It soon grew to vast\r\nproportions. At first it was economically managed and beneficent in its\r\ninfluence; subsequently, however, it degenerated into an abuse.\r\nInteresting and instructive as would be an inquiry into its operations,\r\nthe history of this politico-philanthropic experiment does not fall\r\nwithin the limits of this work.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment, February 27, 1861, of the Peace Convention, which\r\nhad been in session at Washington endeavoring to discover, if possible,\r\na means of avoiding the irrepressible conflict, there was a large class\r\nwho believed that if only they had been directing the policy of\r\nGovernment the outbreak could have been averted; even when war was\r\nflagrant and passions were highest this class, though diminished greatly\r\nin numbers, did not altogether despair of effecting a settlement between\r\nthe sections. Besides these well-meaning patriots there were not a few\r\nwho were ambitious of notoriety or possessed of an undue opinion of\r\ntheir own importance. Persons of both classes attempted from time to\r\ntime to bring about an armistice which would facilitate negotiations\r\nbetween the two governments. The efforts of these men have no further\r\nbearing on the subject of reconstruction than as they serve to show Mr.\r\nLincoln’s views in successive stages of the conflict.\r\n\r\nProminent among these attempts was the Jacquess-Gilmore mission, which\r\nhas been described in an interesting volume of Rebellion reminiscences\r\nby one of the participants.[426] Horace Greeley’s career as a diplomat\r\nis also a familiar story, which at once illustrates the guilelessness of\r\nthe editor and the sagacity of the President. Mr. Greeley’s failure at\r\nNiagara Falls, however, did not discourage a similar undertaking by Hon.\r\nJeremiah S. Black, who, with no greater success, had an interview in\r\nCanada with his former friend Jacob Thompson.[427]\r\n\r\nMore important, because of its consequences, than the work of any of\r\nthese volunteer commissioners was the visit of Francis P. Blair, Sr., to\r\nRichmond. This distinguished politician and editor had in the days of\r\nNullification assisted in shaping the policy of the Government. The\r\nbosom friend and confidential adviser of Andrew Jackson, Mr. Blair\r\nthoroughly understood Southern feeling, and from long residence in\r\nWashington was intimately acquainted with Southern leaders. His\r\npolitical victories in the past encouraged, no doubt, the hope of some\r\nnotable achievement to crown his maturer years. For some time he had\r\nbeen meditating a plan of reunion which would not only end the strife\r\nbut contribute to heal the wounds of war. Though anxious to communicate\r\nhis project to the President, he received no encouragement to do so. By\r\nrequesting Blair to call upon him after the fall of Savannah Mr. Lincoln\r\nevaded a discussion of the subject. That contingency, however, was not\r\nremote, and late in December the veteran political leader received from\r\nthe President a card bearing these words:\r\n\r\n  Allow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and\r\n  return.\r\n\r\n                                                         =A. Lincoln.=\r\n\r\n  _December 28, 1864._\r\n\r\nWith this credential Mr. Blair went at once to the camp of General\r\nGrant, whence under flags of truce he sent two communications to\r\nJefferson Davis requesting, among other things, permission for an\r\ninterview. This, after some delay, was granted, and on the 12th of\r\nJanuary, 1865, he found himself in Richmond face to face with the\r\nConfederate President. What transpired is accurately known from accounts\r\nof the meeting by both Blair and Davis. The former admitted frankly that\r\nMr. Lincoln afforded him no opportunity to explain the object of his\r\nmission, and, indeed, appeared anxious to avoid an interview on that\r\nsubject. When he had been assured that the Confederate authorities were\r\nunder no engagements to European powers that would prevent their\r\nentering into arrangements with the Government of the United States Mr.\r\nBlair unfolded his plan by reading to Mr. Davis a carefully prepared\r\npaper embodying the following suggestions:\r\n\r\nSlavery, he said, was doomed, for even the South itself had proposed to\r\nemploy the slave in winning its independence. That institution,\r\ntherefore, no longer remained as an obstacle to peace. Louis Napoleon,\r\nhe continued, had declared publicly that his object was to make the\r\nLatin race supreme in the southern part of North America. This, indeed,\r\nhad been an idea of the Emperor’s uncle, who desired at one time to make\r\nconquests of territory in the States bordering the Gulf, and the\r\nfoothold already effected in Mexico was one step in the accomplishment\r\nof this grand design. After developing these points Mr. Blair added,\r\n“Jefferson Davis is the fortunate man who now holds the commanding\r\nposition to encounter this formidable scheme of conquest, and whose fiat\r\ncan at the same time deliver his country from the bloody agony now\r\ncovering it in mourning. He can drive Maximilian from his American\r\nthrone, and baffle the designs of Napoleon to subject our Southern\r\npeople to the ‘Latin race.’”\r\n\r\nHow this was to be accomplished Mr. Blair’s paper outlined. President\r\nLincoln’s amnesty proclamation looked to an armistice, which could be\r\nenlarged to embrace all engaged in the war; then by secret preliminaries\r\nto a cessation of hostilities Mr. Davis could transfer to Texas such a\r\nportion of the Confederate army as was deemed adequate to his purpose.\r\nWith a Southern force on the Rio Grande and Juarez conciliated it could\r\nenter Mexico and expel her invaders. If these combined forces were\r\ninsufficient, multitudes from the Federal army, officers and men, would\r\nbe found ready to engage in the enterprise. Both Republicans and\r\nDemocrats of the North had declared their adherence to the Monroe\r\nDoctrine.\r\n\r\nAfter thus indicating for Mr. Davis a means of escape from his dilemma\r\nthe adroit politician next appealed powerfully to his desire of fame.\r\n“He who expels the Bonaparte-Hapsburg dynasty from our Southern flank,”\r\nproceeded Mr. Blair, “which General Jackson in one of his letters warned\r\nme was the vulnerable point through which foreign invasion would come,\r\nwill ally his name with those of Washington and Jackson as a defender of\r\nthe liberty of the country. If in delivering Mexico he should model its\r\nStates in form and principle to adapt them to our Union and add a new\r\nSouthern constellation to its benignant sky while rounding off our\r\npossessions on the continent at the Isthmus, and opening the way to\r\nblending the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific, thus embracing our\r\nRepublic in the arms of the ocean, he would complete the work of\r\nJefferson, who first set one foot of our colossal Government on the\r\nPacific by a stride from the Gulf of Mexico.”[428]\r\n\r\nBlair remarked in conclusion, “There is my problem, Mr. Davis; do you\r\nthink it possible to be solved?” After a little consideration came the\r\nreply, “I think so.” Touching the question of bringing the sections\r\ntogether again Mr. Davis observed that though a spirit of vindictiveness\r\nhad been engendered by the war, time and events would do something\r\ntoward its removal. The circumstance of Northern and Southern armies\r\nunited in a common cause would, he believed, assist greatly in restoring\r\nthe old feeling. He also acknowledged to his visitor that European\r\npowers were pleased to see the sections exhausting their resources in\r\nmutual war.\r\n\r\nThus was the Confederate leader persuaded to entertain the bold project\r\nof conquering Mexico under pretence of relieving the Monroe Doctrine\r\nfrom its peril. The explanation of this easy conversion, however, lies\r\nmainly in the fact that Mr. Davis, however he might endeavor to conceal\r\nhis convictions, was convinced that the resources of the South were\r\nscarcely equal to another campaign. Like other leaders of the\r\nConfederacy he was anxious to seize any means of escape from an\r\nembarrassing situation. He proposed to Mr. Blair, therefore, the\r\nappointment of commissioners, and mentioned Judge Campbell, formerly of\r\nthe United States Supreme Court, as one qualified by his talents and\r\nintegrity to undertake such a mission.\r\n\r\nDuring his short sojourn in Richmond Mr. Blair learned from other\r\nprominent secessionists the hopelessness of the rebellion, and this,\r\nperhaps, was the only tangible result of his celebrated intrigue. To\r\ninitiate the project Mr. Davis handed him a letter to be shown President\r\nLincoln. That interesting communication was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                =Richmond, Virginia=, _12 Jany., ’65_.\r\n\r\n  =F. P. Blair=, Esq.:\r\n\r\n  =Sir=: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to you, to\r\n  give you, in this form, the substance of remarks made by me, to be\r\n  repeated by you to President Lincoln, etc., etc. I have no\r\n  disposition to find obstacles in forms, and am willing now, as\r\n  heretofore, to enter into negotiations for the restoration of peace;\r\n  and am ready to send a commission whenever I have reason to suppose\r\n  it will be received, or to receive a commission, if the United\r\n  States Government shall choose to send one. That, notwithstanding\r\n  the rejection of our former offers, I would, if you could promise\r\n  that a commissioner, minister, or other agent, would be received,\r\n  appoint one immediately, and renew the effort to enter into\r\n  conference, with a view to secure peace to the two countries.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours, etc.,\r\n                                               =Jefferson Davis=.[429]\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln’s only response to the communication thus brought to his\r\nattention was to open a little wider the door for negotiation by sending\r\nto Mr. Blair the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                     =Washington=, _January 18, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  =F.

Blair=, Esq.:\r\n\r\n  =Sir=: You having shown me Mr. Davis’s letter to you of the 12th\r\n  instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and\r\n  shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he, or any other\r\n  influential person now resisting the National authority, may\r\n  informally send to me, with the view of securing peace to the people\r\n  of our one common country.\r\n\r\n                                                     Yours, etc.,\r\n                                                         =A. Lincoln=.\r\n\r\nWith this note Mr. Blair returned to Richmond framing as best he could\r\nexcuses why President Lincoln rejected the overtures of Jefferson Davis\r\nfor a joint invasion of Mexico. With the nature of these explanations\r\nthis essay is not concerned. To cover his retreat from an unsuccessful\r\nintrigue the disappointed commissioner then suggested that, perhaps,\r\nGrant and Lee could enter into negotiations for peace with more\r\nassurance of success than politicians could hope to do. Though Mr. Davis\r\noffered no objection to this proposal, Blair was forced soon after to\r\nreport that military negotiations were out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate leader was then compelled to choose between obstinate\r\nperseverance in his policy of a war for Southern independence or to\r\naccept frankly Mr. Lincoln’s offer of reunion. Blair’s first visit to\r\nRichmond did not escape observation, and, when his second conference was\r\nknown, interest in the purpose of his mission became intense. Without\r\nsome effort at negotiation Mr. Davis could not afterward satisfy the\r\npeace party in the South without subjecting himself to the injurious\r\nimputation of preferring war. In these circumstances, and after\r\nconsultation with his cabinet, he authorized Alexander H. Stephens, John\r\nA. Campbell and R. M. T. Hunter to proceed to Washington as a commission\r\nfor the purpose of informally conferring with Mr. Lincoln “upon the\r\nissues involved in the existing war, and for the purpose of securing\r\npeace to the two countries.” They were burdened with no instructions,\r\nand only one condition was insisted upon, that is, an acknowledgment of\r\nSouthern independence.\r\n\r\nToward the end of January they presented themselves at the Federal\r\nmilitary lines near Richmond, and, after an exchange of telegrams with\r\nthe authorities in Washington, were permitted to pass on to Fortress\r\nMonroe. It was the original intention of President Lincoln to intrust\r\nthe work of the conference wholly to Secretary Seward, and for this\r\npurpose he gave him the following written instructions:\r\n\r\n                                          =Executive Mansion,\r\n                                      Washington=, _January 31, 1865_.\r\n\r\n  Hon. =William H. Seward=, _Secretary of State_:\r\n\r\n  You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, there to meet and\r\n  informally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, on\r\n  the basis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a\r\n  copy of which you have. You will make known to them that three\r\n  things are indispensable, to wit: _First_. The restoration of the\r\n  national authority throughout all the States. _Second._ No receding\r\n  by the executive of the United States on the slavery question from\r\n  the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to Congress,\r\n  and in preceding documents. _Third._ No cessation of hostilities\r\n  short of an end of the war and the disbanding of all forces hostile\r\n  to the Government. You will inform them that all propositions of\r\n  theirs, not inconsistent with the above, will be considered and\r\n  passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality. You will hear all\r\n  they may choose to say and report it to me. You will not assume to\r\n  definitely consummate anything.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours, etc.,\r\n                                               =Abraham Lincoln=.[430]\r\n\r\nThe different if not conflicting statements as to the object of their\r\nmission nearly led to a return of the Confederate representatives\r\nwithout any interview whatever. General Grant, fearing the unfavorable\r\ninfluence on the Union cause of such a result, sent to Secretary Stanton\r\na confidential dispatch in which he referred to the evident sincerity of\r\nStephens and Hunter. He also expressed his regret that they were about\r\nto return without an expression on the subject of their mission from any\r\nperson in authority. President Lincoln, who was about to recall Mr.\r\nSeward by telegraph, decided, on reading Grant’s message, to join his\r\nSecretary at Fortress Monroe, for which place he set out at once.\r\n\r\nThe famous conference, which took place February 3, 1865, on board a\r\nsteamer at Hampton Roads, has been treated in detail by nearly every\r\nhistorian of the Rebellion, and, therefore, need only be briefly noticed\r\nin these pages. An informal discussion of four hours occurred on the\r\n_River Queen_. By a previous agreement no writings or memoranda were\r\nmade; hence our principal knowledge of what transpired at that\r\ncelebrated interview is derived from accounts subsequently written out\r\nfrom memory by the Confederate commissioners, and from Secretary\r\nSeward’s letter to Charles Francis Adams, United States Minister to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens, who began the discussion, asked whether there was no way\r\nof restoring former relations; to this Mr. Lincoln replied, “There was\r\nbut one way that he knew of, and that was, for those who were resisting\r\nthe laws of the Union to cease that resistance.” Stephens observed that\r\nthey had been led to believe that both sections might for a time cease\r\ntheir present strife and unite on some continental question until\r\npassion had somewhat subsided and accommodation become possible.\r\n\r\nTo this suggestion Mr. Lincoln replied promptly: “I suppose you refer to\r\nsomething that Mr. Blair has said. Now it is proper to state at the\r\nbeginning that whatever he said was of his own accord, and without the\r\nleast authority from me.” The President then stated that before the\r\nvisit to Richmond he had flatly refused to hear Mr. Blair’s\r\npropositions; he was willing, however, to hear proposals for peace on\r\nthe conditions expressed in his reply to the letter of Mr. Davis. The\r\nrestoration of the Union was a _sine qua non_ with him, therefore his\r\ninstructions that no conference be held except on that basis.\r\n\r\nThough the Confederate statesmen had resolved not to enter into any\r\nagreement that would require their forces to unite in an invasion of\r\nMexico, Mr. Stephens continued to press the subject, and this after Mr.\r\nLincoln had refused even to discuss the question. The President then\r\nbrought the conversation back to the original object of the meeting, and\r\ndeclared that he could not entertain a proposition looking to an\r\narmistice until the paramount question of reunion was first determined.\r\n\r\nThe terms of reunion were then discussed. On this subject Mr. Lincoln is\r\nreported by the commissioners to have said that the shortest way to\r\neffect this was to disband the insurgent armies and permit “the National\r\nauthorities to resume their functions.” As to the admission of members\r\nto Congress from the seceding States the President believed they ought\r\nto be received, and also that they would be; however, he could enter\r\ninto no stipulations on that subject. By the cessation of resistance, he\r\nis alleged to have declared, the States would be immediately restored to\r\ntheir practical relations to the Union. This sentiment was probably\r\nascribed to him for party purposes.\r\n\r\nAs the enforcement of the confiscation and other penal laws was left\r\nentirely with him he assured them that the Executive power would be\r\nexercised with the utmost liberality. The courts could determine all\r\nquestions involving rights of property, and Congress, after passion had\r\nbeen somewhat composed, would, no doubt, be liberal in making\r\nrestitution of forfeited property, or would indemnify those who had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nThe President refused to promise any modification whatever of the terms\r\nof his Emancipation Proclamation. He regarded it as a judicial question.\r\nHow the courts would decide it he did not know. His own opinion was that\r\nas the proclamation was only a war measure, as soon as the war ceased it\r\nwould be inoperative for the future. It would be held to apply only to\r\nsuch slaves as had come under its operation while it was in active\r\nexercise. The courts, however, might hold that it effectually\r\nemancipated all the slaves in the States to which it applied at the\r\ntime. He is reported further to have said that he interfered with\r\nslavery to maintain the Union, and then only with hesitation and under\r\npressure of a public necessity. He had always favored emancipation, but\r\nnot immediate emancipation.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion he is said to have stated as his belief that the\r\npeople of the North were not less responsible for slavery than those of\r\nthe South; if the war should then cease, with the voluntary abolition of\r\nslavery by the States, he would favor, individually, payment by the\r\nGovernment of a fair indemnity for the loss to owners. That feeling, he\r\nbelieved, had an extensive existence in the loyal States. He knew some\r\nwho were in favor of an appropriation as high as $400,000,000 for that\r\npurpose. However, he could enter into no stipulation. He merely\r\nexpressed his own views and what he believed to be the views of others\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nRelative to the division of Virginia Mr. Lincoln said he could give only\r\n“an individual opinion, which was, that Western Virginia would continue\r\nto be recognized as a separate State in the Union.”\r\n\r\nSeward brought to the notice of the commissioners one topic which to\r\nthem was new, that is, the passage by Congress three days earlier of the\r\nproposed amendment to the Federal Constitution. He is reported to have\r\nsaid that it was passed in deference to the war spirit, and that if the\r\nSouth would agree to immediate restoration its ratification might be\r\ndefeated. This, however, is doubtful, for the Cabinet as well as the\r\nPresident approved the action of Congress in submitting the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the consideration of the States; besides, it is not in\r\nharmony with Mr. Seward’s anti-slavery record.\r\n\r\nIn urging on Mr. Stephens separate State action to effect a cessation of\r\nhostilities, the President said: “If I resided in Georgia, with my\r\npresent sentiments, I’ll tell you what I would do if I were in your\r\nplace. I would go home and get the Governor of the State to call the\r\nLegislature together, and get them to recall all the State troops from\r\nthe war; elect Senators and Members to Congress, and ratify this\r\nconstitutional amendment prospectively, so as to take effect—say in five\r\nyears. Such a ratification would be valid, in my opinion. I have looked\r\ninto the subject, and think such a prospective ratification would be\r\nvalid. Whatever may have been the views of your people before the war,\r\nthey must be convinced now that slavery is doomed. It cannot last long\r\nin any event, and the best course, it seems to me, for your public men\r\nto pursue would be to adopt such a policy as will avoid, as far as\r\npossible, the evils of immediate emancipation. This would be my course,\r\nif I were in your place.”[431]\r\n\r\nThe advice was wasted. When the party was on the point of separating,\r\nMr. Stephens again asked the President to reconsider the plan of an\r\narmistice on the basis of a Mexican expedition. “Well, Stephens,”\r\nreplied Mr. Lincoln, “I will reconsider it; but I do not think my mind\r\nwill change.” Thus ended the famous Hampton Roads conference.\r\n\r\nOn their return to Richmond the commissioners made a formal report to\r\nMr. Davis of the failure of negotiations; this he transmitted to the\r\nConfederate Congress with an artful letter designed to strengthen the\r\nwar party in the South, and to silence effectually the adversaries of\r\nhis administration. To improve this advantage a day was appointed for\r\nthe purpose of getting a popular expression on the result of the\r\nconference. Business was generally suspended, and the people crowded\r\nevery building in the city suitable for holding large assemblies.\r\nChurches, theatres and halls of legislation were engaged for the\r\noccasion. Twenty orators, among the ablest in the South, told their\r\nhearers of the Northern “ultimatum,” not omitting to describe eloquently\r\nall the consequences of subjugation. The old war spirit appeared to have\r\nbeen kindled once more; “But,” says Mr. Pollard, “it was only the sickly\r\nglare of an expiring flame; there was no steadiness in the excitement;\r\nthere was no virtue in huzzas; the inspiration ended with the voices and\r\nceremonies that invoked it; and it was found that the spirit of the\r\npeople of the Confederacy was too weak, too much broken to act with\r\neffect, or assume the position of erect and desperate defiance.”[432] In\r\nMarch General Lee revealed the weakness of his army at Fort Steadman;\r\nGrant’s movements around Petersburg followed in April; the rest is a\r\nfamiliar story.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief discussion of topics only allied to the Presidential\r\nmethod of reunion it is time to resume our examination of the main\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nIt is almost a trite observation to remark that President Lincoln’s\r\nopinions on public questions were formed only after mature deliberation,\r\nand that to the conclusions thus reached he adhered with inflexible\r\ntenacity. Notwithstanding the sentiments of Congress on the question of\r\nreconstruction he evinced a decided preference for his own. This is\r\nproved by a number of letters and speeches from which two may be\r\nselected both because of the time of their appearance and the station of\r\nthe persons to whom they were addressed. To General Hurlbut, who had\r\ntemporarily succeeded Banks in command at New Orleans, the President\r\nwrote, November 14, 1864, the following admonitory letter:\r\n\r\n  Few things, since I have been here, have impressed me more painfully\r\n  than what, for four or five months past, has appeared a bitter\r\n  military opposition to the new State government of Louisiana. I\r\n  still indulged some hope that I was mistaken in the fact; but copies\r\n  of a correspondence on the subject between General Canby and\r\n  yourself, and shown me to-day, dispel that hope. A very fair\r\n  proportion of the people of Louisiana have inaugurated a new State\r\n  government, making an excellent new constitution—better for the poor\r\n  black man than we have in Illinois. This was done under military\r\n  protection, directed by me, in the belief, still sincerely\r\n  entertained, that with such a nucleus around which to build we could\r\n  get the State into position again sooner than otherwise. In this\r\n  belief a general promise of protection and support, applicable alike\r\n  to Louisiana and other States, was given in the last annual message.\r\n  During the formation of the new government and constitution they\r\n  were supported by nearly every loyal person, and opposed by every\r\n  secessionist. And this support and this opposition, from the\r\n  respective standpoints of the parties, was perfectly consistent and\r\n  logical. Every Unionist ought to wish the new government to succeed;\r\n  and every disunionist must desire it to fail. Its failure would\r\n  gladden the heart of Slidell in Europe, and of every enemy of the\r\n  old flag in the world. Every advocate of slavery naturally desires\r\n  to see blasted and crushed the liberty promised the black man by the\r\n  new constitution. But why General Canby and General Hurlbut should\r\n  join on the same side is to me incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n  Of course, in the condition of things at New Orleans, the military\r\n  must not be thwarted by the civil authority; but when the\r\n  constitutional Convention, for what it deems a breach of privilege,\r\n  arrests an editor in no way connected with the military, the\r\n  military necessity for insulting the Convention and forcibly\r\n  discharging the editor is difficult to perceive. Neither is the\r\n  military necessity for protecting the people against paying large\r\n  salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing very apparent.\r\n  Equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for forcibly\r\n  interposing to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the\r\n  State. These things, if they have occurred, are, at the best, no\r\n  better than gratuitous hostility. I wish I could hope that they may\r\n  be shown to not have occurred. To make assurance against\r\n  misunderstanding, I repeat that in the existing condition of things\r\n  in Louisiana, the military must not be thwarted by the civil\r\n  authority; and I add that on points of difference the commanding\r\n  general must be judge and master. But I also add that in the\r\n  exercise of this judgment and control, a purpose, obvious and\r\n  scarcely unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to\r\n  crush out the civil government, will not be overlooked.[433]\r\n\r\nA similar communication, though less peremptory in tone, he felt\r\nconstrained to send to General E. R. S. Canby, who had been assigned to\r\ncommand in the military division of West Mississippi. Under date of\r\nDecember 12, 1864, he wrote that officer:\r\n\r\n  I think it is probable that you are laboring under some\r\n  misapprehension as to the purpose, or rather the motive, of the\r\n  Government on two points—cotton and the new Louisiana State\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  It is conceded that military operations are the first in importance;\r\n  and as to what is indispensable to these operations, the department\r\n  commander must be judge and master.\r\n\r\n  But the other matters mentioned I suppose to be of public importance\r\n  also; and what I have attempted in regard to them is not merely a\r\n  concession to private interest and pecuniary greed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  As to the new State government of Louisiana. Most certainly there is\r\n  no worthy object in getting up a piece of machinery merely to pay\r\n  salaries and give political consideration to certain men. But it is\r\n  a worthy object to again get Louisiana into proper practical\r\n  relations with the nation, and we can never finish this if we never\r\n  begin it. Much good work is already done, and surely nothing can be\r\n  gained by throwing it away.\r\n\r\n  I do not wish either cotton or the new State government to take\r\n  precedence of the military while the necessity for the military\r\n  remains; but there is a strong public reason for treating each with\r\n  so much favor as may not be substantially detrimental to the\r\n  military.[434]\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Lincoln never modified these opinions is conclusively proved by\r\nthe last public utterance of his life. In addressing the citizens of\r\nWashington, who were holding a demonstration in consequence of Lee’s\r\nsurrender, the President on the evening of April 11 said:\r\n\r\n  By these recent successes the reinauguration of the national\r\n  authority—reconstruction—which has had a large share of thought from\r\n  the first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is\r\n  fraught with great difficulty. Unlike a case of war between\r\n  independent nations, there is no authorized organ for us to treat\r\n  with—no one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other\r\n  man. We simply must begin with and mold from disorganized and\r\n  discordant elements. Nor is it a small additional embarrassment that\r\n  we, the loyal people, differ among ourselves as to the mode, manner,\r\n  and measure of reconstruction. As a general rule, I abstain from\r\n  reading the reports of attacks upon myself, wishing not to be\r\n  provoked by that to which I cannot properly offer an answer. In\r\n  spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my knowledge that I\r\n  am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking\r\n  to sustain the new State government of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  In this I have done just so much as, and no more than, the public\r\n  knows. In the annual message of December, 1863, and in the\r\n  accompanying proclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction, as\r\n  the phrase goes, which I promised, if adopted by any State, should\r\n  be acceptable to and sustained by the executive Government of the\r\n  nation. I distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which\r\n  might possibly be acceptable, and I also distinctly protested that\r\n  the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should\r\n  be admitted to seats in Congress from such States. This plan was in\r\n  advance submitted to the then Cabinet, and distinctly approved by\r\n  every member of it. One of them suggested that I should then and in\r\n  that connection apply the Emancipation Proclamation to the\r\n  theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana; that I should\r\n  drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people, and that\r\n  I should omit the protest against my own power in regard to the\r\n  admission of members of Congress. But even he approved every part\r\n  and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by\r\n  the action of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  The new constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation for the\r\n  whole State, practically applies the proclamation to the part\r\n  previously excepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for freed\r\n  people, and it is silent, as it could not well be otherwise, about\r\n  the admission of members to Congress. So that, as it applies to\r\n  Louisiana, every member of the Cabinet fully approved the plan. The\r\n  message went to Congress, and I received many commendations of the\r\n  plan, written and verbal, and not a single objection to it from any\r\n  professed emancipationist came to my knowledge until after the news\r\n  reached Washington that the people of Louisiana had begun to move in\r\n  accordance with it. From about July 1862, I had corresponded with\r\n  different persons supposed to be interested [in] seeking a\r\n  reconstruction of a State government for Louisiana. When the message\r\n  of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached New Orleans,\r\n  General Banks wrote me that he was confident that the people, with\r\n  his military coöperation, would reconstruct substantially on that\r\n  plan. I wrote to him and some of them to try it. They tried it, and\r\n  the result is known. Such has been my only agency in getting up the\r\n  Louisiana government.\r\n\r\n  As to sustaining it, my promise is out, as before stated. But as bad\r\n  promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this as a bad\r\n  promise, and break it whenever I shall be convinced that keeping it\r\n  is adverse to the public interest; but I have not yet been so\r\n  convinced. I have been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to\r\n  be an able one, in which the writer expresses regret that my mind\r\n  has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question whether the\r\n  seceded States, so called, are in the Union or out of it. It would\r\n  perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since I\r\n  have found professed Union men endeavoring to make that question, I\r\n  have purposely forborne any public expression upon it. As appears to\r\n  me, that question has not been, nor yet is, a practically material\r\n  one, and that any discussion of it, while it thus remains\r\n  practically immaterial, could have no effect other than the\r\n  mischievous one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may\r\n  hereafter become, that question is bad as the basis of a\r\n  controversy, and good for nothing at all—a merely pernicious\r\n  abstraction.\r\n\r\n  We all agree that the seceded States, so called, are out of their\r\n  proper practical relation with the Union, and that the sole object\r\n  of the Government, civil and military, in regard to those States is\r\n  to again get them into that proper practical relation. I believe\r\n  that it is not only possible, but in fact easier, to do this without\r\n  deciding or even considering whether these States have ever been out\r\n  of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at home, it\r\n  would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad. Let\r\n  us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper\r\n  practical relations between these States and the Union, and each\r\n  forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing\r\n  the acts he brought the States from without into the Union, or only\r\n  gave them proper assistance, they never having been out of it. The\r\n  amount of constituency, so to speak, on which the new Louisiana\r\n  government rests, would be more satisfactory to all if it contained\r\n  50,000, or 30,000, or even 20,000, instead of only about 12,000, as\r\n  it does. It is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective\r\n  franchise is not given to the colored man. I would myself prefer\r\n  that it were now conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who\r\n  serve our cause as soldiers.\r\n\r\n  Still, the question is not whether the Louisiana government, as it\r\n  stands, is quite all that is desirable. The question is, will it be\r\n  wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it, or to reject and\r\n  disperse it? Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation\r\n  with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State\r\n  government? Some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave\r\n  State of Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the Union, assumed to be\r\n  the rightful political power of the State, held elections, organized\r\n  a State government, adopted a free State constitution, giving the\r\n  benefit of public schools equally to black and white, and empowering\r\n  the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored\r\n  man. Their legislature has already voted to ratify the\r\n  constitutional amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing\r\n  slavery throughout the nation. These twelve thousand persons are\r\n  thus fully committed to the Union and to perpetual freedom in the\r\n  State—committed to the very things, and nearly all the things, the\r\n  nation wants—and they ask the nation’s recognition and its\r\n  assistance to make good their committal.\r\n\r\n  Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize\r\n  and disperse them. We, in effect, say to the white man: You are\r\n  worthless or worse; we will neither help you, nor be helped by you.\r\n  To the blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old\r\n  masters, hold to your lips we will dash from you, and leave you to\r\n  the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some\r\n  vague and undefined when, where, and how. If this course,\r\n  discouraging and paralyzing both white and black, has any tendency\r\n  to bring Louisiana into proper practical relations with the Union, I\r\n  have so far been unable to perceive it. If, on the contrary, we\r\n  recognize and sustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse\r\n  of all this is made true. We encourage the hearts and nerve the arms\r\n  of the twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it,\r\n  and proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it,\r\n  and ripen it to a complete success. The colored man, too, in seeing\r\n  all united for him, is inspired with vigilance, and energy, and\r\n  daring, to the same end. Grant that he desires the elective\r\n  franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already\r\n  advanced steps toward it than by running backward over them? Concede\r\n  that the new government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as\r\n  the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching\r\n  the egg than by smashing it.\r\n\r\n  Again, if we reject Louisiana we also reject one vote in favor of\r\n  the proposed amendment to the national Constitution. To meet this\r\n  proposition it has been argued that no more than three fourths of\r\n  those States which have not attempted secession are necessary to\r\n  validly ratify the amendment. I do not commit myself against this\r\n  further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable,\r\n  and sure to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by\r\n  three fourths of all the States would be unquestioned and\r\n  unquestionable. I repeat the question: Can Louisiana be brought into\r\n  proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by\r\n  discarding her new State government? What has been said of Louisiana\r\n  will apply generally to other States. And yet so great peculiarities\r\n  pertain to each State, and such important and sudden changes occur\r\n  in the same State, and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole\r\n  case that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed\r\n  as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive and inflexible plan\r\n  would surely become a new entanglement. Important principles may and\r\n  must be inflexible. In the present situation, as the phrase goes, it\r\n  may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the\r\n  South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act when satisfied\r\n  that action will be proper.\r\n\r\nThe promised announcement was never made; for within three days the\r\ngreat career of Abraham Lincoln was brought to a close. The inherent\r\ndifficulties of reconstruction, as well as the mischievous consequences\r\nof faction among Union men, he perceived and acknowledged at the outset.\r\nPrecisely how he would have removed the one and, without breaking with\r\nhis party, have avoided the other we can never know. His uniform success\r\nin dealing with other embarrassing questions appears to justify the\r\nopinion that he would not have failed altogether in solving the greater\r\nproblem presented by the return of peace. This subject will be further\r\ndiscussed in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 425:\r\n\r\n  Globe, 2 Sess. 38th Cong., p. 141 (appendix).\r\n\r\nFootnote 426:\r\n\r\n  Personal Recollections of Abraham Lincoln, by James R.

While it is true that the confidence which he\r\nenjoyed among the masses in the loyal States, his unquestionable\r\nintegrity and his splendid intellectual powers would have made him a\r\nformidable adversary even in a controversy with Congress, yet we have no\r\nassurance that these undoubted elements of strength would have enabled\r\nhim, in the confused times following the Rebellion, to do more than\r\npostpone a contest with the Legislative branch in which a desire to\r\ndiscipline the South was even then winning adherents. The passions of\r\nthe hour would have discovered a weakness in his clemency to the\r\nvanquished, while his very breadth of soul and sense would have been\r\nregarded by radical members of his party as only an evidence of his\r\ndesire to facilitate the restoration to power of red-handed rebels. But\r\nit is idle to speculate on what might have been the result of his\r\nendeavors to heal the wounds of war, for, by the assassin’s bullet, the\r\nexecution of his policy passed into other hands.\r\n\r\nWhile the terrible tragedy of April 14 was still unknown to a great\r\nmajority of American citizens, Andrew Johnson was quietly installed in\r\nthe office of President. As every detail of the simple ceremony in the\r\nKirkwood Hotel is familiar to this generation of readers, that event\r\nrequires only a passing allusion. In the presence of the constitutional\r\nadvisers of his predecessor, except Secretary Seward, who had been\r\ndangerously wounded by one of Booth’s accomplices, the oath of office\r\nwas administered by Chief Justice Chase, who, with the Attorney-General,\r\nhad examined the precedents and the law. Besides these officials a few\r\nmembers of Congress, who still lingered at the capital, were in\r\nattendance as witnesses.\r\n\r\nSomething of Andrew Johnson’s political career has been related in the\r\nchapter on Tennessee. As military governor of that State his high\r\ncourage, his acknowledged patriotism, his honesty of purpose and\r\nprinciple were evident to all. Traits of character suspected, but not\r\nthen fully disclosed, were developed by more complex conditions. The\r\nproblem that confronted him may be briefly stated.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Johnson succeeded to the Presidential office Confederate armies\r\nsomewhat broken, indeed, but still capable of mischief were retarding\r\nthe victorious march of Sherman’s legions. Measures for disbanding the\r\nformer became necessary when Southern leaders, recognizing the\r\nhopelessness of further resistance, made overtures looking to an\r\narmistice which took place and to the surrender that subsequently\r\nfollowed. It became necessary to discontinue at once the enlistment of\r\nmen in the loyal States, and, to economize expense, to muster out of\r\nservice as expeditiously as possible the grand army of Union volunteers.\r\nThe energy and promptness with which this task was accomplished were not\r\nthe least of Secretary Stanton’s services to the nation. The perfection\r\nto which years of experience had brought the machinery of the War\r\nDepartment enabled the bulk of the Union armies to return without delay\r\nto their homes, where, discarding the character of soldiers, they melted\r\ninsensibly into the civil population and speedily resumed the pursuits\r\nof peace. Relations with France were somewhat strained, and, owing to a\r\nsuccession of unfriendly acts, a war with Great Britain was not\r\nimprobable. The public finances, too, required attention. To provide a\r\nrevenue adequate to the extraordinary demands of the time was beginning\r\nto tax the resources of Government. A satisfactory settlement of even\r\nthe least of these might well have appeared a serious question. The\r\ncessation of hostilities, however, presented a problem far transcending\r\nthe greatest of them in importance.\r\n\r\nMany of the late Confederate States were threatened with anarchy, for in\r\nthose commonwealths the recent authority had been extinguished and no\r\norganizations existed which the Administration could recognize as State\r\ngovernments. The political reconstruction of four of them, it is true,\r\nhad been commenced under encouragement and direction of the national\r\nExecutive, but even in those much remained to be done. Before examining\r\nthe condition of the insurgent States as a whole it may be well,\r\ntherefore, to summarize the most important events that occurred in\r\nArkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana and Virginia between the institution of\r\nloyal governments in those commonwealths and the meeting of the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress in December, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of Arkansas, though lacking its full membership,\r\nconvened in March, 1865, and unanimously adopted on April 14 succeeding\r\nthe proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution. The action of\r\nCongress, however, in submitting that proposition to the States had been\r\nanticipated by the Union men of that commonwealth, for their organic law\r\nhad already abolished involuntary servitude; by the same instrument they\r\nhad repudiated all debts created in the conduct of the war, thereby\r\ncomplying with three of the principal conditions required for restoring\r\ntheir State to the Union.\r\n\r\nDuring the same session an act passed the Legislature disfranchising all\r\ncitizens who had aided the Confederate cause after the organization,\r\nApril 18, 1864, of a loyal government. By the adversaries of this\r\nmeasure it was claimed that the lawmaking body exceeded its powers,\r\nbecause the act in effect prescribed qualifications for the suffrage\r\ndifferent from those required by the State constitution, and, so far as\r\nit attempted to deprive citizens of their privileges without judicial\r\nconviction of crime, was contrary to the law of the land. This statute\r\nawakened the indifferent, and, as the time approached for holding\r\nCongressional elections, excited considerable discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the new government silently extended its authority over\r\nthose parts of the State occupied by Southern soldiers until the\r\ncessation of hostilities. Governor Flanigan on retiring suggested that\r\nConfederate county officers be continued under his successor. This\r\nproposal, however, was promptly rejected and the secession establishment\r\nin all its parts completely ignored. Governor Murphy then published a\r\nproclamation urging the people in those regions hitherto dominated by\r\nthe enemy, which comprised nearly half the counties in the State, to\r\nassemble and renew their local organizations. His address was favorably\r\nreceived, and his administration soon acquiesced in throughout the\r\ncommonwealth. Outrages ceased with the disappearance of Confederate\r\nsoldiers, and by the beginning of July judicial tribunals had been\r\nrevived in nearly every county. Some of the courts had been in session,\r\nand most of them were prepared to meet regularly for the transaction of\r\nbusiness. Taxes were collected as quietly as before the war, and civil\r\nprocess could be executed in every part of the State. Hundreds had\r\nreturned from the South to their former homes and resumed the pursuits\r\nof peace. Discontent, so far as any existed in the State, was confined\r\nto some ex-Confederate officers and to a few non-combatants who had\r\nsympathized with the rebellion. Both classes advised disregard of the\r\ndisfranchising law, but as a rule the returned soldiers on both sides\r\nwere quiet and orderly. All accounts concur in representing the\r\npacification of Arkansas as complete toward the end of summer, and by\r\nOctober 13, 1865, the Secretary of State was able to report officially\r\nthat the new government was in successful operation, the civil\r\norganization of every county having been effected. Governor Murphy in\r\napproving a circular published near the close of the same month by\r\nBrigadier General Sprague, an assistant commissioner of the Freedmen’s\r\nBureau, enjoined both civil officers and citizens to give all possible\r\nencouragement to the officers and appointees of the bureau.[437]\r\n\r\nThe President on receiving intelligence of this satisfactory condition\r\nof affairs sent to Governor Murphy the following dispatch:\r\n\r\n  There will be no interference with your present organization of\r\n  State government. I have learned from E. W. Gantt, Esq., and other\r\n  sources, that all is working well, and you will proceed and resume\r\n  the former relations with the Federal Government, and all the aid in\r\n  the power of the Government will be given in restoring the State to\r\n  its former relations.[438]\r\n\r\nAs the time approached for an election of national Representatives, the\r\nGovernor issued another address in which he advised the choice of\r\npersons who could take the oath required by Congress. Three members were\r\nelected, namely: William Ryers, G. H. Kyle and James M. Johnson, who\r\nsubsequently appeared at Washington and presented their\r\ncredentials.[439]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account of the situation in Arkansas is confirmed by the\r\ntestimony of General Reynolds, military commander of the department, who\r\nhad sent officers into all the counties. These reported civil government\r\nas everywhere reëstablished. The State, they asserted, had never enjoyed\r\ngreater tranquillity. There was not a shadow of conflict between the\r\ncivil and the military authority, for the latter in sustaining the\r\nformer was careful not to encroach on any of its functions. In short,\r\nthe restoration of civil law in that State was universally admitted.\r\n\r\nIn two thirds of the counties, however, great destitution prevailed.\r\nEarly in the summer the General Government felt compelled to distribute\r\namong indigent freedmen and refugees vast quantities of food, and\r\nNorthern generosity alone, the Governor declared, could prevent great\r\ndistress during the ensuing winter. Nor was his expectation\r\ndisappointed. It is a splendid tribute to the character of Americans\r\nthat one of the most destructive conflicts in history, with all the\r\nanimosities which protracted civil wars engender, did not perceptibly\r\nimpair in them the feelings of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe organization of a Union government in Tennessee has elsewhere been\r\ndescribed. The Assembly chosen under its authority met at Nashville on\r\nthe 2d of April, 1865, and three days later ratified the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment. On the 21st the President was requested to proclaim the\r\ninsurrection at an end in that commonwealth, though a few weeks later he\r\nwas called upon for troops to guarantee a republican form of government\r\nand to protect the State against invasion and domestic violence. Besides\r\nappointing executive officers the Legislature elected to the United\r\nStates Senate David T. Patterson and Joseph S. Fowler.\r\n\r\nThe most important measure of the session, however, was the enactment on\r\nJune 5 of a severe law affecting the elective franchise. By it the right\r\nto vote was restricted, as formerly, to white males who had attained\r\ntheir twenty-first year. To the classes excepted by the Proclamation of\r\nDecember 8, 1863, were added all those who had left seats in the General\r\nAssembly, all who were absentees from the United States for the purpose\r\nof aiding the rebellion and all who had fled within the Confederate\r\nlines with the same intention. These were disfranchised for the period\r\nof fifteen years from the passage of the act.[440]\r\n\r\nDuring this session there was presented by the freedmen of the State a\r\npetition for the elective franchise. The “colored citizens of\r\nTennessee,” as they styled themselves, received no response to their\r\nprayer beyond the approval of an order for printing 500 copies of their\r\nmemorial. The motion for this trifling concession was carried by a vote\r\nof 41 to 10.\r\n\r\nOn June 12 the Legislature adjourned until the first Monday in October.\r\nOn the same day Governor Brownlow ordered an election to be held on\r\nAugust 2 for Representatives to Congress in each of the eight districts\r\ninto which the State had just been divided. Vacancies in the General\r\nAssembly were directed to be filled at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe disfranchising act, with the oath required thereunder, had the\r\neffect of excluding a large number, probably three fourths, of the\r\ncitizens from voting. Its adversaries declared the law unconstitutional,\r\nand it encountered much opposition, especially in Middle and West\r\nTennessee. Its constitutionality, however, was sustained by one of the\r\nState courts in a decision rendered June 29, and the Governor, in a\r\nproclamation of July 10 succeeding, argued in favor of the statute.\r\nThose who should unite to defeat its execution would be “declared in\r\nrebellion against the State of Tennessee, and dealt with as rebels.” It\r\nwas further signified that votes cast in violation of the law would not\r\nbe taken into account by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nNor were these idle threats, for the civil officers were instructed “to\r\narrest and bring to justice all persons who, under pretence of being\r\ncandidates for Congress or other office, are traveling over the State\r\ndenouncing and nullifying the Constitution and laws of the land, and\r\nspreading sedition and a spirit of rebellion.”[441]\r\n\r\nIt was relative to these measures that President Johnson on July 20,\r\n1865, sent the following despatch to Governor Brownlow:\r\n\r\n  I hope and have no doubt you will see that the recent amendments to\r\n  the constitution of the State as adopted by the people, and all the\r\n  laws passed by the last Legislature in pursuance thereof, are fairly\r\n  executed, and that all illegal votes in the approaching election be\r\n  excluded from the polls, and the election for members of Congress be\r\n  legally and fairly conducted. When and wherever it becomes necessary\r\n  to employ force for the execution of the laws and the protection of\r\n  the ballot-box from violence and fraud, you are authorized to call\r\n  upon Maj.-Gen. Thomas for sufficient military force to sustain the\r\n  civil authorities of the State. I have received your recent address\r\n  to the people, and think it well timed, and hope it will do much\r\n  good in reconciling the opposition to the amendment to the\r\n  constitution and the laws passed by the last Legislature. The law\r\n  must be executed and the civil authority sustained. In your efforts\r\n  to do this, if necessary, Gen. Thomas will afford a sufficient\r\n  military force. You are at liberty to make what use you think proper\r\n  of this despatch.[442]\r\n\r\nThough no violence marked the election, considerable irregularities,\r\nnotwithstanding the Governor’s precautions, appear to have crept into\r\nmodes of registration, and he felt compelled in consequence to reject\r\nthe ballots of twenty-nine counties. In this contest 61,783 citizens\r\nparticipated, but when those illegally enrolled were disregarded the\r\nnumber was reduced to 39,509. The defective vote, which applied to all\r\nthe candidates, was thrown out in every county, though it changed the\r\nresult in only one district. Of the eight Representatives chosen all\r\nwere Union men; four, however, were conservatives, opposed both to test\r\noaths and measures of disfranchisement.[443] Governor Brownlow because\r\nof his action was severely censured, but was supported by a majority of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn October, when the Legislature reassembled, a bill to render persons\r\nof African and of Indian descent competent witnesses in the State courts\r\npassed the Senate by the close vote of 10 to 9, but failed altogether to\r\nreceive the approval of the House. The Representatives of his State\r\ndeclined at that time, by a vote of 35 to 25, to pass a simple\r\nresolution endorsing the Administration of President Johnson, but almost\r\nunanimously adopted in place of that proposition the following:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we endorse the administration of his Excellency the\r\n  President of the United States, and especially his declaration that\r\n  treason shall be made odious, and traitors punished.[444]\r\n\r\nA colored convention representing the freedmen of the State was held at\r\nthe capital during the week succeeding the election. If the Legislature\r\ndid not grant before December 1, 1865, their petition for the elective\r\nfranchise, this body resolved to protest against the admission of the\r\nTennessee delegation to Congress. On the question of negro suffrage the\r\nGovernor in his October message said:\r\n\r\n  I think it would be bad policy, as well as wrong in principle, to\r\n  open the ballot-box to the uninformed and exceedingly stupid slaves\r\n  of the Southern cotton, rice, and sugar fields. If allowed to vote,\r\n  the great majority of them would be influenced by leading\r\n  secessionists to vote against the Government, as they would be\r\n  largely under the influence o£ this class of men for years to come,\r\n  having to reside on and cultivate their lands. When the people of\r\n  Tennessee become satisfied that the negro is worthy of suffrage,\r\n  they will extend it, and not before; and I repeat that this question\r\n  must be regulated by the State authorities and by the loyal voters\r\n  of the State, not by the General Government.[445]\r\n\r\nApprehending trouble from the antagonism of races Mr. Brownlow advocated\r\nthe old idea of colonization for the black man. He believed, however,\r\nthat negroes should be admitted to testify in the courts and argued in\r\nfavor of conferring such a privilege. Repugnance to their testimony, he\r\ndeclared, was due principally to education and habit.\r\n\r\nIf the following account from _The Knoxville Whig_ of September 27 is\r\ntrustworthy the freedmen of Tennessee had but a slender claim to the\r\nright to vote. That journal said:\r\n\r\n  Thousands of free colored persons are congregating in and around the\r\n  large towns in Tennessee, and thousands are coming in from other\r\n  States, one third of whom cannot get employment. Indeed, less than\r\n  one third of them want employment, or feel willing to stoop to work.\r\n  They entertain the erroneous idea that the Government is bound to\r\n  supply all their wants, and even to furnish them with houses, if, in\r\n  order to do that, the white occupants must be turned out. There is a\r\n  large demand for labor in every section of the State, but the\r\n  colored people, with here and there a noble exception, scorn the\r\n  idea of work. They fiddle and dance at night, and lie around the\r\n  stores and street corners in the day time.[446]\r\n\r\nThe Governor’s message, sent in at this session, was hopeful in tone. He\r\nfavored some amendment but not a repeal of the franchise law. He advised\r\nalso a “full pardon to the masses—the young and the deluded, who\r\nfollowed blindly the standard of revolt, provided they act as becomes\r\ntheir circumstances.” The unrepentant, however, should suffer the period\r\nof disfranchisement; while the active leaders, he believed, were\r\nentitled “neither to mercy nor forbearance.” To some negroes he would\r\ngive the right of suffrage, but, believing it unsafe, he was opposed to\r\nconferring it on them all.\r\n\r\nTennessee, over which advancing and retreating armies had repeatedly\r\npassed, suffered even more severely than Arkansas, for besides having\r\nbeen the principal theatre of operations for the contending hosts in the\r\nWest, her territory had also been in the early rule of Governor Johnson\r\nthe scene of local strife. Old family feuds that for various reasons had\r\nbeen allowed to slumber were in many instances revived, and the most\r\nlawless outrages perpetrated in the face of day. These disorders,\r\nhowever, had practically ceased toward the conclusion of his\r\ngovernorship, and peace reigned once more within the borders of that\r\ncommunity. The existence there of a considerable demand for labor\r\nassisted greatly in diminishing the burden of the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe closing months of the war found the loyal government of Louisiana\r\nendeavoring with the influence of the Union army to extend its\r\njurisdiction over all the territory that had been brought under Federal\r\ncontrol. Notwithstanding its contracted area this commonwealth for\r\ncertain purposes was treated as a restored member of the Union. Like the\r\nNorthern States it was affected by the draft which, on February 15, took\r\nplace in some districts included in the Department of the Gulf. But the\r\ngreat struggle that for four years had employed the attention and tested\r\nthe resources of the Government soon reached its close, thus rendering\r\nunnecessary any field service from the recruits then obtained.\r\n\r\nThough the attitude of Congress toward the Banks government has been\r\ndescribed in the preceding pages, that was not believed the proper place\r\nto examine the nature of the election which was held on September 5, or\r\nthe _personnel_ of the Legislature chosen on that occasion. In\r\nconnection with the appointment by that assembly of Messrs. Smith and\r\nCutler as United States Senators the subject was noticed incidentally.\r\nThe action of Congress on the question of admitting members from\r\nLouisiana was, however, fully entered into in that relation.\r\n\r\nSome additional information affecting the validity of that election is\r\nafforded by a proclamation published May 13, 1865, by the acting\r\nGovernor, J. Madison Wells.[447] This document asserts that the Register\r\nof Voters for the city of New Orleans declared officially that there had\r\nbeen enrolled 5,000 persons who did not possess the legal qualifications\r\nfor electors. To ascertain the political people, therefore, a new\r\nregistration was thought desirable. Mr. Wells accordingly declared the\r\nold records closed from the date of his proclamation. The certificates\r\ngranted thereon, as well as the enrollment, were pronounced null and\r\nvoid. He then authorized the opening on June 1, 1865, of a new set of\r\nbooks, the enrollment to be made in accordance with the qualifications\r\nprescribed by the constitution and laws of Louisiana. The old\r\nregistration having been made under an order of General Banks this\r\nannouncement led at once to a difference between the Department\r\nCommander and the acting Governor. Many names recorded on the old books\r\nwere alleged to have been those of colored men, and a circumstance\r\npresently to be related tends to support the assertion.\r\n\r\nAbout that time the Confederate Governor, Allen, transferred to Federal\r\nofficials all the important military records in his possession, and from\r\nhis capital at Shreveport published a communication in which he\r\nannounced his administration closed on that day. He said in part: “The\r\nwar is over, the contest is ended, the soldiers are disbanded and gone\r\nhome, and now there is in Louisiana no opposition whatever to the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States.”[448]\r\n\r\nOn June 10 an address to the people of thirty-five parishes was issued\r\nby the new Governor, who congratulated them on their return to the\r\nprotection of the national flag. It was not with the past, he reminded\r\nthem, but with the present and the future that their welfare was bound\r\nup. They were exhorted to go manfully to work and reëstablish civil\r\ngovernment. The submission to law and the prompt acquiescence of those\r\nrecently hostile to the United States he regarded as a hopeful sign.\r\nEven the soldiers, he said, returned to their homes better and wiser\r\nmen, promising by a cheerful obedience to law to atone for past errors.\r\nAll citizens were urged to imitate their example. Provisional\r\nappointments to county offices would be made until they could be filled\r\nby election. In naming persons for such places the Governor promised to\r\nbe guided by the recommendation of the people if they selected men of\r\ngood reputation who had taken the amnesty oath, which would be a\r\nprerequisite in every case. If the people did not act promptly he would\r\nfeel compelled to make appointments upon the best information\r\nobtainable. If errors were made, then citizens would be themselves to\r\nblame for neglecting promptly to suggest the proper persons. A\r\nprovisional judiciary would also be constituted.\r\n\r\nImportant elections, he announced, would take place in the autumn, when\r\nRepresentatives to Congress and members of a Legislature would be\r\nchosen. If each parish was provided with the proper officers to open the\r\npolls an election for governor and other State officers would take place\r\nat the same time. The people addressed were informed that in making the\r\nnew constitution its framers did not intend to deprive them of their\r\nrights. The response to this appeal was a local reorganization in nearly\r\nall the parishes affected.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wells, on September 21, in a second order appointed the 6th of\r\nNovember succeeding as the day for holding the election, and also\r\ndefined the qualifications of voters. White male citizens of the United\r\nStates who had attained the age of twenty-one years and had resided\r\ntwelve months in the commonwealth were declared entitled to exercise the\r\nsuffrage. Evidence was also required of every elector that he had taken\r\nthe oath of amnesty contained in the proclamation of December 8, 1863,\r\nor that prescribed, May 29, 1865, by Mr. Johnson. The excepted classes\r\ncould vote only upon receiving a special pardon from the President. In\r\nother respects the election would be conducted in accordance with the\r\nconstitution of 1852.\r\n\r\nBy a Democratic convention, held October 2 in New Orleans, at which\r\ntwenty-one parishes were unrepresented, Mr. Wells was unanimously\r\nnominated for Governor. The preamble to a body of resolutions adopted on\r\nthat occasion asserts that the issue which for four years had tried the\r\nstrength of the Government had been made openly and manfully; that the\r\ndecision having been adverse they now came forward in the same spirit of\r\nfrankness and honor to support the Federal Government under the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe “National Democratic” party they believed to be the only agency by\r\nwhich radicalism, to which they imputed a tendency toward consolidation,\r\ncould be successfully encountered, and through which the General\r\nGovernment could be restored to its pristine purity. On the subject of\r\nreorganization they endorsed President Johnson’s policy, which, it was\r\nalleged, preserved unimpaired the rights of the States and maintained\r\ntheir equality in the Union.\r\n\r\nNoticing a question already assuming importance, they declared that, in\r\naccordance with the constant adjudication of the Federal Supreme Court,\r\npersons of African descent could not be regarded as citizens of the\r\nUnited States; that under no circumstances could there exist any\r\nequality between the white and other races; that as the national\r\nGovernment was instituted by, so it was designed to be perpetuated for\r\nthe exclusive benefit of, white men. For the time they were content with\r\nthis oblique reference to the subject of negro suffrage. Another\r\nresolution advised the calling of a convention to frame a constitution\r\nfor the State, that of 1864 being characterized as the creation of\r\nfraud, violence and corruption.\r\n\r\nThis convention, which admitted the effectual abolition of slavery in\r\nthe South, assumed that those who had sustained loss by the policy of\r\nemancipation could rightfully petition Congress for compensation. The\r\nrepeal was also advocated of those statutes and ordinances not in\r\nharmony with the Federal Constitution. Believing it consonant with “the\r\nchivalrous magnanimity” of President Johnson the convention earnestly\r\nappealed for an early general amnesty and a prompt restitution of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAlmost a month preceding the meeting of this convention an address was\r\ncirculated by the “National Conservative Union” party, whose\r\nrepresentatives assembled one week later than the Democratic delegates.\r\nIts members opposed both an extension of suffrage to negroes and the\r\ncalling of a new constitutional convention. Like the Democratic\r\ndelegates they endorsed the reconstruction policy of the President. They\r\napproved the attitude of their conservative Northern friends who opposed\r\nradicalism and an elevation of the freedmen to political equality with\r\nwhites. The doctrine of secession was repudiated, and to the payment of\r\nall obligations created in carrying on the war they declared themselves\r\ninflexibly opposed. They, too, favored the speedy passage of an act of\r\ngeneral amnesty as well as a repeal of the confiscation law.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wells was also the choice of this convention. He accepted both\r\nnominations and perceived no inconsistency in doing so, never, he\r\nasserted, having been a strict party man. Mr. Wells, who had formerly\r\nbeen a Red River planter, proved his loyalty to the Federal Government\r\nby coming within the Union lines as soon as they were established, and\r\nbringing with him his slaves, thereby endangering somewhat his\r\nownership.\r\n\r\nThough he had not yet returned to his home, the friends of Henry Watkins\r\nAllen, the late Confederate executive, named him as their candidate for\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nIn the election, which was held at the appointed time, the entire vote\r\npolled was 27,808, of which Governor Wells received 23,312, and\r\nex-Governor Allen, 5,497. In every county except one the Democratic\r\nticket for members of the Legislature was successful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most instructive incident of this contest was the part\r\nplayed by those known as “Radical” Republicans. These held a\r\nmass-meeting in the city of New Orleans on November 13 at which were\r\nadopted resolutions claiming the election to Congress of Henry C.\r\nWarmoth as territorial Delegate. When he subsequently appeared in\r\nWashington his case was brought to the attention of the House by\r\nThaddeus Stevens, who offered, December 20, 1865, what purported to be a\r\ncertificate of Warmoth’s election as Delegate from the “Territory of\r\nLouisiana.” On request of the Pennsylvania leader this document was\r\nreferred to the Joint Committee on Reconstruction.[449]\r\n\r\nThis extreme element, which assumed to regard Louisiana as a Territory,\r\npolled 19,000 votes, most of which were alleged to have been cast by\r\ncolored men. It declared the State organization repugnant to the Federal\r\nConstitution both in law and effect. The President, it was asserted,\r\ncould not restore Louisiana by proclamation, for reinstatement could be\r\naccomplished in a constitutional manner only by petitioning Congress for\r\nadmission whenever a majority of the people deemed such a course\r\nexpedient, and the temper of the whites, nine tenths of whom were\r\ndisloyal, rendered it inadvisable at that time to take such a step. The\r\nmeeting rejoiced that the Republican party in the North had triumphed in\r\nthe recent elections, for these victories pointed to ultimate success.\r\nThe premature admission of Louisiana Congressmen, by placing the Union\r\npeople under rebel rule, would be disastrous. However, as loyal citizens\r\nthey would confine themselves to peaceable means of redress.\r\n\r\nWarmoth appears shortly before the end of the war to have gone into\r\nLouisiana with the Union army, in which he is said by one authority to\r\nhave acquired the reputation of a brave soldier and by another to have\r\nmerited dismissal from its ranks.[450] By organizing the freedmen and\r\ninsisting upon their political rights he won their confidence; his\r\nshrewdness and engaging address retained their gratitude. In this\r\nelection his adherents not only sought to determine the Federal\r\nrelations of Louisiana, but also conferred upon negroes the privilege of\r\nvoting, for there was then no law of either the General or State\r\ngovernment investing them with any such right.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature, which was convoked in special session, assembled at New\r\nOrleans on the 23d of November. The Governor’s message on that occasion\r\nrelated chiefly to such local objects as required the attention of the\r\nlawmaking body. By recommending an election of United States Senators\r\nMr. Wells repudiated the action of the General Assembly, which, at the\r\npreceding session, had appointed Messrs. Smith and Cutler to represent\r\nthe State. Acting upon the Governor’s suggestion, the latter was again\r\nchosen, with Hahn for his colleague. These appointments were intended to\r\nfill vacancies caused by the withdrawal, February 5, 1861, of John\r\nSlidell and Judah P. Benjamin.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the lower House was the selection of a\r\ncommittee to consider a resolution which provided for assembling a\r\nconvention to draft a State constitution. For reasons already assigned\r\nthe majority report of this committee recommended the calling of a\r\nconvention and counselled the Governor to order an election in which the\r\nquestion could be voted on by the people. The minority recognized the\r\nconstitution of 1864 as binding, and on the ground of public economy\r\npreferred its amendment, especially as it had already acted favorably on\r\nthe abolition of slavery. The adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment and\r\nthe repeal of the ordinance of secession were mentioned by them as\r\nconditions essential to the recognition of Louisiana as a State and as\r\nindispensable to a restoration of all the privileges which that\r\ncondition implied.\r\n\r\nAs early as February 17 preceding the Legislature established under the\r\nconstitution of 1864 had ratified the Thirteenth Article amending the\r\nConstitution. By a vote of two to one the Assembly again approved that\r\naction. The session came to an end on the 22d of December.\r\n\r\nThis commonwealth, a veritable Eden when the strife began, had been\r\nsadly changed in its progress. A generous Government, indeed, by\r\nrepairing the levees protected her fairest parishes from inundation. The\r\nsame beneficent authority maintained many public institutions of charity\r\nthat must else have ceased their noble work. Distress and want had\r\nalready invaded that once prosperous community, and in the city of New\r\nOrleans alone 16,000 persons were dependent upon and maintained by\r\nFederal bounty. Silence reigned in the great cotton market of the world.\r\nThe wreck of her public finances has elsewhere been described. Her\r\nopulent commerce had been destroyed, agriculture everywhere languished.\r\nPlantations that but lately teemed with rich harvests showed the effects\r\nof interrupted cultivation, and the mighty river that had annually\r\npoured into her metropolis the productions of a dozen States now flowed\r\nuntroubled to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nTo show the attitude of Congress toward the Alexandria government events\r\nin Virginia have in part been anticipated. The Legislature of the loyal\r\nportion of that Commonwealth was composed of members from only ten\r\ncounties and parts of other counties. It was by delegates from this\r\nrestricted area that the constitution of 1864 was framed and adopted.\r\n\r\nBy this instrument the elective franchise was confined to male whites\r\nthat had attained the age of twenty-one years, who had resided twelve\r\nmonths in the State and were willing to swear support of the Federal\r\nConstitution and the restored government; but officials and voters were\r\nrequired in addition to make oath, or affirmation, that they had not,\r\nsince January 1, 1864, voluntarily given aid or assistance to those in\r\nrebellion against the General Government. The Assembly, however, was\r\nempowered, when it was deemed safe to do so, to restore to citizenship\r\nall who would be disfranchised by this provision of the organic law.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary servitude was also abolished. While great numbers of negroes\r\nwere thus set at liberty, nothing was then done to elevate them to the\r\ndignity of citizens. The question of making them voters was, of course,\r\nstill more remote.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly was prohibited from making provision for the\r\npayment of any debt or obligation created in the name of the\r\nCommonwealth by the pretended State authorities at Richmond; and it was\r\nalso forbidden to permit any county, city or corporation to levy or\r\ncollect taxes for the discharge of any debt incurred for the purpose of\r\naiding any rebellion against the State or the United States, or to\r\nprovide for the payment of any bonds held by rebels in arms.[451]\r\n\r\nThe Confederate capital, long deemed impregnable, fell on the 2d of\r\nApril. Within a week came tidings of the surrender of Lee’s entire army,\r\ngreatly reduced in numbers, it is true, but hitherto the main reliance\r\nof the Confederacy. Mr. Lincoln, apparently, was not altogether without\r\nexpectation of some such fortunate outcome of the extensive preparations\r\nthat had been made for ensuring the success of the final campaign, and\r\non the following day, April 10, 1865, he sent from Washington to the\r\nexecutive head of the restored State this telegram:\r\n\r\n  =Governor Pierpont=, _Alexandria, Virginia_:\r\n\r\n  Please come up and see me at once.[452]\r\n\r\n                                                         =A. Lincoln.=\r\n\r\nMr. Pierpont, as the writer has been credibly informed, called by\r\nrequest on President Lincoln during the week of his assassination,\r\nevidently in response to this telegram, when they spent three hours\r\ntogether in conversation. No third party appears to have been present at\r\ntheir consultation. The topic discussed it is not difficult to imagine.\r\nShortly before his death, which occurred in March, 1899, Governor\r\nPierpont informed his daughter that he never believed Andrew Johnson\r\ncarried out Mr. Lincoln’s idea in the reconstruction of Virginia.[453]\r\nThat policy, however, had not then, April 10, assumed definitive form in\r\nthe mind of the President himself, for he expressly stated to Mr.\r\nPierpont that he had no plan for reorganization, but must be guided by\r\nevents. His last public utterance establishes the correctness of this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nFour weeks later President Johnson by executive order recognized the\r\nAlexandria establishment, and toward the close of the same month, May\r\n26, 1865, Mr. Pierpont, with other members of his government, arrived in\r\nRichmond. The sneer of Thaddeus Stevens that the archives and property\r\nof loyal Virginia were conveyed to the new capital in an ambulance\r\naffords at least an adequate idea of the feeble condition of the\r\nrestored State. But notwithstanding the absence of all pomp and his lack\r\nof the usual emblems of authority the Governor, we are told, was\r\nreceived in a very flattering manner.\r\n\r\nVirginia, which emerged from the struggle crippled by the loss of an\r\nimportant part of her domain, suffered more in the destruction of the\r\nelements of wealth than any of her errant sisters, and though entering\r\nsomewhat reluctantly on a career of rebellion, she was the only member\r\nof the Confederacy that was permanently weakened. Industry could never\r\nrepair the alienation of her territory. While it may appear that the\r\nGeneral Government acted harshly toward a State to which the Union owed\r\nso much, the preceding pages show clearly that the loss of her\r\ntrans-Alleghany counties was due chiefly to an unwise administration of\r\nher internal affairs. Notwithstanding the statement of Mr. Blaine, the\r\nwriter does not think that Virginia was singled out for punishment. But\r\neven apart from her dismemberment the ravages of war fell most heavily\r\non the Old Dominion. There it was that the Army of the Potomac and the\r\nArmy of Northern Virginia contended longest for supremacy. Troops in\r\ntheir marches and countermarches foraged liberally on her people,\r\nsometimes without distinction of friend or foe. Concrete illustrations\r\nwill occur to every reader acquainted with the military history of the\r\ngreat conflict. The devastation of the Shenandoah valley was only a\r\nstriking example of what was constantly occurring within more restricted\r\nareas of the State. Barns and dwelling houses, fences and crops perished\r\nin the universal destruction. Cattle were either killed or carried off,\r\nand even the implements of husbandry were frequently devoted to the\r\nflames. The injury thus sustained by agricultural interests was followed\r\nin many districts by an alarming scarcity of food during the ensuing\r\nyears, and to escape starvation numbers of her citizens fled from once\r\nhappy homes. Newspaper correspondents in their progress through the\r\nState describe scenes of wretchedness and distress. In exploring for\r\ntheir journals wide regions that had recently been the theatre of war\r\nthey witnessed spectacles of want, hunger and despair. Uncultivated\r\ntracts in the wake of the armies contributed to heighten the picture of\r\ndesolation. Richmond, the centre of so many interesting historical\r\nassociations, though long exempt from pillage, perished ultimately in a\r\nconflagration. In short, nearly every landmark of prosperity was effaced\r\nby the calamities of war.\r\n\r\nTo repair these ravages, to repeople these solitudes, to revive commerce\r\nand agriculture, to restore tranquillity and maintain order was the\r\nstupendous task before Governor Pierpont, in whose public career it may\r\nbe regarded as the second stage. After the formation of West Virginia,\r\nin which he had acted a conspicuous and honorable part, and one that can\r\nscarcely be overrated, his exertions barely sufficed to preserve the\r\ncontinuity of a loyal government in his native State. In the former\r\nundertaking he had the coöperation of nearly every person of\r\nconsideration beyond the Alleghanies. His efforts in Richmond, however,\r\nreceived but indifferent support. Whites of little influence and negroes\r\nwho were still but prospective citizens made up the greater number of\r\nhis adherents. A handful of secessionists, it is true, set the example\r\nof obedience to the laws, though they found among their late associates\r\nbut few imitators. It was from such material and in such circumstances\r\nthat Mr. Pierpont was to reconstruct the grand old Commonwealth. The\r\nGovernor, however, applied himself at once to the duties imposed by his\r\noffice. He appointed persons to reorganize the various counties by\r\nholding elections for local officers, though in numerous instances he\r\nmerely authorized to act for the preservation of peace those citizens\r\nwhom the military officers might select. The difficulties of the\r\nsituation were such that he summoned the Legislature to meet in special\r\nsession at Richmond on the 20th of June.\r\n\r\nIn response to this request the lawmaking body assembled at the\r\nappointed time. The Executive message on that occasion related concisely\r\nwhat had been done by the restored government subsequent to June, 1861.\r\nIt also stated that since his arrival at the capital the Governor had\r\nconversed with intelligent men of every shade of political opinion and\r\nrepresenting every part of Virginia. He was convinced, he said, that if\r\nthe test of loyalty prescribed by their constitution was enforced in the\r\nelection and qualification of officers, it would render organization\r\nimpracticable in most of the counties. It was folly to suppose that a\r\nState could be administered “under a republican form of government where\r\nin a large portion of the State, nineteen twentieths of the people are\r\ndisfranchised and cannot hold office. But, fortunately, by the terms of\r\nthe constitution, the General Assembly has control of this subject. The\r\nrestricting clauses of the constitution were devised in time of war....\r\nMen accept the facts developed by the logic of the past four years,\r\ndeclare that they have taken the oath of allegiance to the Government of\r\nthe United States without mental reservation, and intend to be, and\r\nremain, loyal to the Government of their fathers. It would not be in\r\naccordance with the spirit of that noble Anglo-Saxon race, from which we\r\nboast our common origin, to strike a fallen brother, or impose upon him\r\nhumiliating terms after a fair surrender.”[454]\r\n\r\nFor the oath required by the State constitution he suggested the\r\nsubstitution of that prescribed by the President, or one of similar\r\ncharacter; he also recommended the passage of an act to legalize\r\nmarriage between persons of color, and the appointment of a day for\r\nholding elections of Representatives to Congress and for members of the\r\nLegislature in those counties where none had been chosen.\r\n\r\nThe subject of disfranchisement was immediately taken up in both Houses,\r\nand the result of their action was to allow the suffrage to those who,\r\nupon taking the amnesty oath, had not held office under the Confederacy\r\nor its State governments. Those who had done so could neither vote nor\r\nhold office. The Legislature submitted to the people, to be determined\r\nat the election in October succeeding, the question of removing this\r\nrestriction upon officeholders.\r\n\r\nThis action of the Assembly was followed by the appearance of a large\r\nnumber of competitors for office, and considerable interest was\r\nawakened. Finding, however, that they would be unable to take the oath\r\nrequired by Congress many of the candidates for the national Legislature\r\nwithdrew. The President was asked by some citizens of Albemarle County\r\nwhether, in his opinion, Congress would probably insist upon the oath.\r\nThe following reply to their inquiry was made by Attorney-General Speed:\r\n\r\n  The President has referred to me your letter, dated Charlottesville,\r\n  Virginia, September, 1865, and I am instructed by him to say that he\r\n  has no more means of knowing what Congress may do in regard to the\r\n  oath about which you inquire than any other citizen. It is his\r\n  earnest wish that loyal and true men, to whom no objections can be\r\n  made, should be elected to Congress.\r\n\r\n  This is not an official letter, but a simple expression of\r\n  individual opinion and wish.[455]\r\n\r\nThe election was held on October 12, the vote polled being the smallest\r\never given in the history of the State. In the first eight Congressional\r\ndistricts, however, it exceeded 40,000. The constitutional amendment met\r\nwith very little opposition, many counties voting unanimously to remove\r\nthe restriction upon the suffrage.[456] The Assembly then chosen\r\nconvened at Richmond on December 4, 1865, the time fixed for the meeting\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that there were grounds for apprehension regarding the\r\nstability of the new governments instituted in these four States, the\r\nprincipal cause of anxiety to the Administration was the disorganized\r\npolitical and social condition of the remaining members of the late\r\nConfederacy. It was universally agreed that with the destruction of its\r\nmilitary power the authority of that government was completely\r\nextinguished. From that moment until the revival within them of Federal\r\nlaws these commonwealths were destitute of all legislation of a general\r\ncharacter. Under our dual principle of government, however, this could\r\nbe endured temporarily. But the absence of a central organism would soon\r\nbe evident in the reappearance of those alarming symptoms which marked\r\nAmerican political and industrial life in the critical period between\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, in 1783, and the inauguration, nearly six years\r\nlater, of the present national system. In that unhappy interval,\r\nhowever, the authority of the various States was ample for the\r\nregulation of domestic affairs, while in the deranged and confused times\r\nsucceeding the Rebellion seven entire commonwealths were left without\r\nany general or any particular government. Their territory, indeed, had\r\npassed under control of the Union forces, for when the Administration of\r\nJefferson Davis was overthrown the disloyal State establishments, of\r\nwhich it was only an emanation, fell likewise. Though internal progress\r\nwas not seriously to be expected in this situation, tolerable order was\r\npreserved by Federal soldiers, who occupied the entire region between\r\nthe Potomac and the Rio Grande, for even in those States reorganized\r\nunder Executive auspices civil authority was not yet established on a\r\nfoundation sufficiently secure to maintain itself without assistance\r\nfrom the military power of the nation.\r\n\r\nBesides the absence of all civil government there were other elements of\r\ndiscord that tended to increase the confusion in these States. Their\r\npopulation, it need scarcely be observed, was not homogeneous. The\r\ndecree of emancipation together with the incidents of war had brought\r\nfreedom to almost the entire slave population of the South. This was\r\nsoon to be confirmed by the proposed constitutional amendment, which was\r\ndesigned both to place beyond question the status of freedmen and to\r\nstrike the shackles from the limbs of the last bondman in the loyal as\r\nwell as in the disloyal States. About the middle of December nearly\r\n4,000,000 negroes bereft of the hand that bestowed their daily\r\nsustenance found themselves suddenly dependent for support upon their\r\nown exertions. The General Government, it is true, by creating the\r\nBureau of Freedmen and Refugees, diminished considerably the danger from\r\nthis source, though this relief by no means solved the problem of\r\ntransforming the recent slave into a useful member of society; besides,\r\nthe bureau itself subsequently degenerated into a fruitful source of\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\nNor were Southern whites by any means unanimous as to the best policy to\r\nadopt in the circumstances in which an unsuccessful rebellion had placed\r\nthem. Between Union men and secessionists there existed a feeling of\r\nextreme bitterness. Even among members of the latter class there was\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion, as in North Carolina, where the\r\nformer Whigs, by the moderation of their views as much as by constantly\r\nagitating the question of reconstruction, had somewhat embarrassed the\r\nRichmond authorities while war was still flagrant. Add to these causes\r\nof disorder the discontent of thousands of disbanded soldiers who\r\nreturned in the gloom of defeat not infrequently to ruined homes and\r\nwasted fields. Then, too, there was the disappointment and humiliation\r\nnaturally felt by a brave and impulsive people who had fought gallantly\r\nin support of a cause condemned, indeed, by the civilized world, but\r\nbelieved by them to be not only just but indispensable to their\r\nprosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nThough a volume could be profitably employed in describing, town by town\r\nand county by county, the extent of destruction inflicted on the South,\r\na few brief paragraphs must suffice to suggest an imperfect idea of the\r\nenormous loss of wealth sustained by that section. The wreck of four\r\nmembers of the Confederacy has been noticed in the preceding pages. That\r\nrapid sketch, however, took no account of the damage to individuals by\r\nthe liberation of their slaves, for, except in those instances where\r\nnegroes left the commonwealth, that was not in any sense a loss to the\r\nState. If it were, a community, by reducing to servitude a part of its\r\ninhabitants, could at any time increase the amount of its capital. It is\r\nonly from the slaveholder’s point of view, therefore, that emancipation\r\ncan be regarded as a pecuniary loss. Immense damage was sustained by\r\nboth North and South in the withdrawal of millions of men from the\r\nvarious fields of production. The energy of these multitudes, which was\r\nrapidly making the United States the most opulent and powerful nation on\r\nthe globe, had exerted itself for four years in the destruction of\r\nformer accumulations.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the moment that the star of the Confederacy had begun to\r\ndecline the imperial State of Georgia, hitherto exempt from punishment,\r\nwas wasted by fire and sword. Sometimes the Southern, sometimes the\r\nNorthern army stripped the country of everything capable of supporting\r\nlife. Crops had been harvested, indeed, but this served only to\r\nfacilitate their destruction. In the retreat of Johnston and the advance\r\nof Sherman toward Atlanta highways had been injured, bridges burned and\r\nmany lines of railroad completely destroyed. Dwellings, when they\r\ninterfered with military operations, were levelled by even the\r\nConfederate army, and the Union forces could not be expected to show\r\ngreater consideration for the property of public enemies. General Hood\r\nnot only wasted the vast stores accumulated in Atlanta but burned\r\nhabitations when they stood in the way of his fortifications. Though\r\nwinter was rapidly approaching, the Federal commander deemed it\r\nnecessary after the capture of that stronghold to expel from their\r\nabodes a considerable part of its population. A brief truce, it is true,\r\nenabled the miserable inhabitants to remove a part of their effects\r\nfarther south; thousands, outcasts from their ruined homes, were thus\r\ndriven to wander among strangers whose bounty had already been taxed by\r\nearlier fugitives; both classes were dependent for their maintenance on\r\nthe precarious charity of an impoverished people. Crowded dwellings\r\nforced great numbers in the inclement weather to seek shelter in the\r\nneighboring forests, where they found a safe refuge, indeed, but a\r\nscanty subsistence. Over the region traversed by Sherman and Johnston\r\nthe forces of Hood soon after traced a devastating march northward to\r\nDalton. The mischiefs of the great march to Savannah have frequently\r\nbeen described. Its beginning was announced by the blaze of burning\r\nbuildings, and when the last of the Federal soldiers had set their faces\r\ntoward the sea the city of Atlanta was little more than a mass of\r\nsmoking ruins. Though the region traversed was probably the richest in\r\nthe State, extensive misery accompanied the progress of the army. The\r\nmeat and the vegetables needed for his command were taken by the Union\r\nGeneral. Horses, mules and wagons were freely appropriated; slaves also\r\nwere assisted to escape from their masters. Mills and cotton-gins were\r\nfrequently devoted to the flames. In Milledgeville factories,\r\nstorehouses and public buildings were destroyed. The principal edifices\r\nof Macon perished about the same time. Indeed, Augusta was the only\r\nconsiderable place in the State that escaped serious harm. The people in\r\nnorthwestern Georgia were in the utmost destitution, large families\r\nbeing frequently for whole days without food; venerable persons of both\r\nsexes, sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, often walked\r\nfifteen and even twenty miles to procure food enough to prevent\r\nstarvation. The injury to all the usual means of transportation greatly\r\nincreased the difficulty of bringing relief. When the conflict had\r\nended, however, Federal officers did what they could to alleviate the\r\nalmost universal distress, and their magnanimity was not without\r\ninfluence on the future conduct of many an ex-Confederate veteran.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, the fatal State that woke the sword of war, did not\r\nsuffer greatly in the earlier stages of the conflict, though even then\r\nher foreign commerce was extinguished and her agriculture interrupted\r\nalong the coast. Before its close, however, she was destined to\r\nexperience most of its horrors. A restless generation of agitators had\r\nassiduously inculcated the notion that the South was ruthlessly\r\noppressed by Yankee avarice. This teaching bore fruit, and the people of\r\nSouth Carolina, coming to regard themselves as little better than\r\ntributary slaves, were easily persuaded to resort to the wager of\r\nbattle. With the progress of the contest this proud State was growing\r\nweaker within, hostile pressure was constantly increasing from without.\r\nTime at length and the fortunes of war had brought round their revenge,\r\nand when the veterans of Sherman turned northward from Savannah the\r\nPalmetto State was powerless to prevent, or seriously to retard, their\r\nadvance. Transportation was greatly embarrassed by the destruction of\r\nthe bridges as well as the tracks of almost every important railway\r\nwithin the State. Immense quantities of cotton and numbers of cotton\r\nwarehouses, uncounted dwellings and depots, machine shops and foundries,\r\nas well as several sailing vessels and steamboats were consumed by\r\nflames. Besides these blackened memorial’s of disaster and defeat, the\r\nstately cities of Charleston and Columbia were almost simultaneously\r\nlaid in ruins by great conflagrations. The inability of the civil\r\nauthorities to furnish food for his army constrained General Sherman to\r\nforage for supplies. In this manner all the cattle, hogs, sheep and\r\npoultry, even the little stores of meal, treasured as the last barrier\r\nagainst want, were consumed, and the people left entirely without\r\nsubsistence. To prevent general starvation the Confederate commander was\r\ncompelled to distribute the rations of his soldiers among the wretched\r\ninhabitants. From various causes many ancient and wealthy families found\r\nthemselves suddenly reduced to a condition of beggary, and so low was\r\nthe condition of the public treasury that the Legislature as early as\r\nthe mid-summer of 1865 had already begun seriously to discuss the\r\nquestion of repudiation.\r\n\r\nWith some slight alterations this picture of South Carolina’s ills will\r\nserve for that of her northern and more deserving sister, so far at\r\nleast as concerns those parts overrun by the contending hosts. The\r\ncessation of hostilities stopped the carnival of death and silenced the\r\nengines of destruction before half of North Carolina’s territory had\r\nbeen crossed. From the first years of the war there were numerous\r\ninstances of privation among the loyalists of that State. Toward its\r\nclose the more favored classes also began to feel the pressure of want.\r\nThe negroes required and received assistance from the Freedmen’s Bureau.\r\nThe whites, refugees as well as secessionists, were aided by the\r\ncommanders of the rival forces.\r\n\r\nFlorida, fortunately for her people, was so remote from the principal\r\nscenes of war that she felt few of its evils. Battles, it is true,\r\noccurred within the State, but they were as skirmishes compared to the\r\nbloody engagements which took place elsewhere. The same observations are\r\nsubstantially true of Texas. A fringe of Mississippi’s territory, too,\r\nhad been swept by the furnace-blast of war. The extensive movements\r\naround Corinth, Iuka, Vicksburg, Jackson and Port Hudson will suggest\r\nthe extent of destruction that visited the northern half of that State.\r\nThere existed considerable privation in that section, though no general\r\ndistress as in other members of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nAll the Gulf States, however, were not equally fortunate. Though long\r\nimpending, the fate of Alabama came swiftly. Almost in the same hour she\r\nwas invaded from the north and menaced from the south. A large portion\r\nof her material resources was already exhausted when the cavalry raids\r\nof General Wilson spread terror and devastation through the interior\r\ncounties. The city of Selma was laid in ashes; smaller towns and\r\nvillages were likewise consumed by flames; schools and colleges, private\r\nbuildings and public edifices perished in the universal wreck. Monuments\r\nof ruin were everywhere conspicuous throughout a region the most\r\nproductive, probably, in all the South. Silence and desolation reigned\r\nwhere but lately stood proud and hospitable mansions. Nor was the\r\ndestruction of wealth or its elements the only injury sustained, for\r\nindustry would soon repair the losses of capital. Labor itself had been\r\nseverely crippled. Of the army of 122,000 soldiers which Alabama\r\nfurnished to the cause of secession 35,000, it was estimated, had been\r\nleft on the field of battle, and at least an equal number had been\r\ndisabled for life. Mobile, enriched by the cotton trade, was silent as\r\nsome ancient necropolis. Her splendid commerce was ruined; her stately\r\nships were gone, and the wave broke unheeded on the shores of her\r\ndeserted harbor.\r\n\r\nThis hurried summary conveys only a very inadequate notion of the\r\ncomplex problem which Mr. Johnson was forced to consider. His arduous\r\nduty was to repair the ravages of military violence, to evoke order from\r\nthe discord of civil strife, to heal the wounds which the imperious\r\npower of slavery had inflicted upon industries and institutions; in a\r\nword, to restore the harmony of that Republic founded by the wisdom of\r\nWashington and preserved by the policy of Lincoln. The sentiments of the\r\nChief Magistrate who was about to attempt this difficult but\r\nindispensable task it is now time to consider. His deliberate\r\nconclusions and his spontaneous utterances are best examined, it is\r\nbelieved, in something like chronological order.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1864, almost a year before his accession to the Presidency,\r\nhe had said in addressing the people of Nashville:\r\n\r\n  But in calling a convention to restore the State, who shall restore\r\n  and reëstablish it?... Shall he who brought this misery upon the\r\n  State be permitted to control its destinies? If this be so, then all\r\n  this precious blood of our brave soldiers and officers so freely\r\n  poured out will have been wantonly spilled....\r\n\r\n  Why all this carnage and devastation? It was that treason might be\r\n  put down and traitors punished. Therefore I say that traitors should\r\n  take a back seat in the work of restoration. If there be but five\r\n  thousand men in Tennessee loyal to the Constitution, loyal to\r\n  freedom, loyal to justice, these true and faithful men should\r\n  control the work of reorganization and reformation absolutely. I say\r\n  that the traitor has ceased to be a citizen, and in joining the\r\n  rebellion has become a public enemy. He forfeited his right to vote\r\n  with loyal men when he renounced his citizenship and sought to\r\n  destroy our Government.... If we are so cautious about foreigners\r\n  who voluntarily renounce their homes to live with us what should we\r\n  say to the traitor, who, although born and reared among us, has\r\n  raised a parricidal hand against the Government which always\r\n  protected him? My judgment is that he should be subjected to a\r\n  severe ordeal before he is restored to citizenship.... Before these\r\n  repenting rebels can be trusted, let them bring forth the fruits of\r\n  repentance.... Treason must be made odious, and traitors must be\r\n  punished and impoverished. Their great plantations must be seized,\r\n  and divided into small farms, and sold to honest, industrious men.\r\n  The day for protecting the lands and negroes of these authors of the\r\n  rebellion is past. It is high time it was.[457]\r\n\r\nThough he had never been accustomed to conceal his opinions on questions\r\nof public interest, and though there was no reason for supposing that\r\nhis views on reorganization had changed in the months intervening\r\nbetween the Nashville speech and his inauguration, there was\r\nconsiderable curiosity, if not indeed impatience, to learn his\r\nsentiments on the paramount issue before the nation. Even the\r\nunparalleled excitement and profound regret occasioned by the\r\nassassination of Mr. Lincoln could not make men forget the grave\r\nquestions which the changed conditions of the Union presented for the\r\nconsideration of statesmen. Therefore the brief remarks addressed by the\r\nnew Executive to those who were present at his inauguration were eagerly\r\nscrutinized for some indication of the principles which he was likely to\r\nadopt in the conduct of his Administration. The absence, however, of\r\neven a hint on that interesting subject gave universal disappointment,\r\nand anxious patriots were not reassured by his failure to announce any\r\nexpression of a purpose to continue the policy of his predecessor. By\r\nhis intimate friends this omission was construed as an intention to\r\npursue in dealing with the South a less generous course than, it was\r\nbelieved, Mr. Lincoln had marked out.\r\n\r\nAmong the more extreme “Radicals” this surmise occasioned little regret,\r\nfor they did not object to the accession of an Executive made, as they\r\nbelieved, of sterner stuff than the late incumbent. From his fierce\r\ndenunciation of secessionists both while military governor of Tennessee\r\nand subsequently, it was generally understood that more stringent\r\nmethods would be adopted by Mr. Johnson than had hitherto been employed.\r\nAmong other things he said in his inaugural: “As to an indication of any\r\npolicy which may be pursued by me in the administration of the\r\nGovernment, I have to say that that must be left for development, as the\r\nadministration progresses. The message or declaration must be made by\r\nthe acts as they transpire. The only assurance that I can now give of\r\nthe future, is by reference to the past.”[458]\r\n\r\nDelegations of citizens who waited upon him to tender their cordial\r\nsupport were assured in the most explicit terms that his past course\r\nwas an indication of what his future policy would be. Three days after\r\nentering upon the duties of his office a deputation of distinguished\r\npersons called on Mr. Johnson under circumstances at once unusual and\r\ntouching. The remains of the late President still lay in the White\r\nHouse. Before the sad procession of the dead left the national Capital\r\nfor Springfield, Governor Oglesby, with other gentlemen from Illinois,\r\ncalled to assure the new Executive of their respect and confidence.\r\nHis record, they declared, gave assurance to their State that in his\r\nhands they could safely trust the destinies of the Republic. The\r\nPresident responded in a speech discussing a far wider range of topics\r\nthan he had treated in his inaugural. Appropriate reference to his\r\npredecessor, the tragical close of whose career was scarcely alluded\r\nto in his first address, was made in this more extended discourse. He\r\nspoke with unaffected and profound emotion. “The beloved of all hearts\r\nhas been assassinated,” said he, “and when we trace this crime to its\r\ncause, when we remember the source whence the assassin drew his\r\ninspiration, and then look at the result, we stand yet more astounded\r\nat this most barbarous, most diabolical act.... We can trace its cause\r\nthrough successive steps back to that source which is the spring of\r\nall our woes. No one can say that if the perpetrator of this fiendish\r\ndeed be arrested, he should not undergo the extremest penalty of the\r\nlaw known for crime: none will say that mercy should interpose. But is\r\nhe alone guilty? Here, gentlemen, you perhaps expect me to present\r\nsome indication of my future policy. One thing I will say: every era\r\nteaches its lesson. The times we live in are not without instruction.\r\nThe American people must be taught—if they do not already feel—that\r\ntreason is a crime and must be punished.... When we turn to the\r\ncriminal code we find arson laid down as a crime with its appropriate\r\npenalty. We find theft and murder denounced as crimes, and their\r\nappropriate penalty prescribed; and there, too, we find the last and\r\nhighest of crimes,—treason.... Let it be engraven on every mind that\r\ntreason is a crime, and traitors shall suffer its penalty.... I do not\r\nharbor bitter or resentful feelings towards any.... When the question\r\nof exercising mercy comes before me it will be considered calmly,\r\njudicially—remembering that I am the Executive of the Nation. I know\r\nmen love to have their names spoken of in connection with acts of\r\nmercy, and how easy it is to yield to that impulse. But we must never\r\nforget that what may be mercy to the individual is cruelty to the\r\nState.”\r\n\r\nCommenting on this speech Mr. Blaine, from whom it is quoted, says that\r\nit “was reported by an accomplished stenographer, and was submitted to\r\nMr. Johnson’s inspection before publication. It contained a declaration\r\nintimating to its hearers, if not explicitly assuring them, that ‘the\r\npolicy of Mr. Lincoln in the past shall be my policy in the future.’\r\nWhen in reading the report he came to this passage, Mr. Johnson queried\r\nwhether his words had not been in some degree misapprehended; and while\r\nhe was engaged with the stenographer in modifying the form of\r\nexpression, Mr. Preston King, of New York, who was constantly by his\r\nside as adviser, interposed the suggestion that all reference to the\r\nsubject be stricken out. To this Mr. Johnson promptly assented. He had\r\nundoubtedly gone farther than he intended in speaking to Mr. Lincoln’s\r\nimmediate friends, and the correction—inspired by one holding the\r\nradical views of Mr. King—was equivalent to a declaration that the\r\npolicy of Mr. Lincoln had been more conservative than that which he\r\nintended to pursue.”[459]\r\n\r\nTo a deputation of New Hampshire citizens he said in part: “This\r\nGovernment is now passing through a fiery, and, let us hope, its last\r\nordeal—one that will test its powers of endurance, and will determine\r\nwhether it can do what its enemies have denied—suppress and punish\r\ntreason.” Though he had been urged, he asserted, by friends whose good\r\nopinion he valued, he refrained from foreshadowing in a public manifesto\r\nthe policy which would guide him. He further observed on this occasion:\r\n“I know it is easy, gentlemen, for any one who is so disposed, to\r\nacquire a reputation for clemency and mercy. But the public good\r\nimperatively requires a just discrimination in the exercise of these\r\nqualities.... To relieve one from the penalty of crime may be productive\r\nof national disaster. The American people must be taught to know and\r\nunderstand that treason is a crime.... Treason is a crime, and must be\r\npunished as a crime. It must not be regarded as a mere difference of\r\npolitical opinion. It must not be excused as an unsuccessful rebellion,\r\nto be overlooked and forgiven. It is a crime before which all others\r\nsink into insignificance; and in saying this it must not be considered\r\nthat I am influenced by angry or revengeful feelings.” He added, that to\r\nthose who had been deluded and deceived by designing men, to those who\r\nhad been only technically guilty of treason, he would accord amnesty,\r\nleniency and mercy. On the instigators of rebellion, however, should be\r\nvisited “the full penalty of their crimes.”[460]\r\n\r\nReplying, April 21, to an address of Governor Morton, who introduced a\r\ndelegation from Indiana, he said: “Mine has been but one straightforward\r\nand unswerving course, and I see no reason why I should depart from\r\nit....\r\n\r\n“I hold it as a solemn obligation in any one of these States where the\r\nrebel armies have been driven back or expelled—I care not how small the\r\nnumber of Union men, if enough to man the ship of State—I hold it, I\r\nsay, a high duty to protect and secure to them a republican form of\r\ngovernment. This is no new opinion.... In adjusting and putting the\r\ngovernment upon its legs again, I think the progress of this work must\r\npass into the hands of its friends. If a State is to be nursed until it\r\nagain gets strength, it must be nursed by its friends, and not smothered\r\nby its enemies.”[461] To this delegation he declared himself not less\r\nopposed to consolidation than to dissolution and disintegration. In a\r\nbrief reply on the same day to a deputation from Ohio he added nothing\r\nof value to these observations, and on the 24th of April he addressed in\r\na similar strain a body of exiles from the South.\r\n\r\n“The colored American asks but two things,” said the spokesman of a\r\nnegro delegation about the same time, “that he have, first, complete\r\nemancipation, and secondly, full equality before American law.” To this\r\nthe President replied, among other things, that he feared leading\r\ncolored men did not “understand and appreciate the fact that they have\r\nfriends on the south side of the line. They have, and they are as\r\nfaithful and staunch as any north of the line. It may be a very easy\r\nthing, indeed popular, to be an emancipationist north of the line, but a\r\nvery different thing to be such south of it. South of it, it costs a man\r\neffort, property, and perhaps life.”[462]\r\n\r\nTwo months later, June 24, in replying to an address of a South Carolina\r\ncommittee, he said in part: “The friction of the rebellion has rubbed\r\nout the nature and character of slavery. The loyal men who were\r\ncompelled to bow and submit to the rebellion should, now that the\r\nrebellion is ended, stand equal to loyal men everywhere. Hence the wish\r\nof reconstruction, and the trying to get back the States to the point at\r\nwhich they formerly moved in perfect harmony.” He reminded them that as\r\nan institution slavery was gone, and said there was no hope that the\r\npeople of South Carolina would be admitted into either the Senate or the\r\nHouse of Representatives until by their conduct they had afforded\r\nevidence of this truth. In their circumstances the true policy was to\r\nrestore the State government, not through military rule, but by the\r\naction of the people.[463]\r\n\r\nDesiring to relieve all loyal citizens and well-disposed persons from\r\nunnecessary trade restrictions, and to encourage a return to peaceful\r\npursuits, the President removed, April 29, 1865, the interdict on all\r\ndomestic and coastwise intercourse in that portion of the late\r\nConfederate States east of the Mississippi and within the lines of\r\nnational military occupation. From this order, however, certain named\r\narticles contraband of war were excepted. Military and naval regulations\r\nin conflict with his proclamation were revoked. On May 22 following he\r\nannounced that ports in the same district would be reopened to foreign\r\ncommerce after July 1, 1865, though certain places in Texas were still\r\ndenied this privilege.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection hitherto existing in Tennessee was declared at an end\r\non June 13, 1865. The authority of the United States, this Proclamation\r\nasserted, was unquestioned within the limits of that commonwealth, and\r\nduly commissioned Federal officials were in undisturbed exercise of\r\ntheir functions. All disabilities attaching to the State and its\r\ninhabitants were therefore removed; but nothing contained in the order\r\nwas to be construed as affecting any of the penalties and forfeitures\r\nfor treason which had previously been incurred.\r\n\r\nTen days later, June 23, the blockade of Galveston and other ports\r\nbeyond the Mississippi was rescinded. These were to be opened to foreign\r\ntrade on the 1st of July succeeding. It was ordered, August 29, 1865,\r\nthat after September 1 all restrictions upon internal, domestic and\r\ncoastwise commerce be removed, so that even articles contraband of war\r\nmight be imported into and sold in the late insurgent States, the\r\nnecessity for prohibiting intercourse in those articles having in great\r\nmeasure ceased.\r\n\r\nIn an order dated May 9, 1865, the President declared null and void all\r\nacts and proceedings of the military and civil organizations of Virginia\r\nwhich had been in rebellion against the General Government; also that\r\nall persons who should exercise or attempt to exercise any authority,\r\njurisdiction or right under Jefferson Davis, and his confederates, or\r\nunder John Letcher or William Smith,[464] and their confederates, or any\r\npretended commission or authority issued by them, or any of them, since\r\nApril 17, 1861, would be deemed and taken as in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States, and dealt with accordingly. By the same order the\r\nauthority of the United States was revived within the geographical\r\nlimits known as Virginia, and the heads of the several Executive\r\nDepartments were instructed to enforce therein all Federal laws the\r\nadministration of which belonged to their respective offices.\r\n\r\nTo carry into effect the constitutional guaranty of a republican form of\r\ngovernment and “afford the advantage and security of domestic laws, as\r\nwell as to complete the reëstablishment of the authority of the laws of\r\nthe United States, and the full and complete restoration of peace within\r\nthe limits aforesaid, Francis H. Pierpont, Governor of the State of\r\nVirginia,” was assured of such assistance from the Federal authorities\r\nas was believed necessary in any lawful measures that he might adopt for\r\nextending the State government throughout that Commonwealth.[465]\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury was directed to nominate without delay\r\nassessors of taxes and collectors of customs and internal revenue, and\r\nsuch other officers of his Department as were authorized by law, to\r\nexecute the revenue laws of the United States. Preference in making\r\nappointments was to be given to qualified loyal residents of the\r\ndistricts in which their respective duties were to be performed; but if\r\nsuitable persons could not be found residing there, then citizens of\r\nother States or districts should be named.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of appointments similar instructions were given to the\r\nPostmaster-General, who was empowered to establish post offices and post\r\nroutes, and to enforce the postal laws of the United States in the State\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the remaining Executive Departments, State, War, Navy and\r\nInterior, were likewise ordered to enforce the acts of Congress\r\npertaining to their respective offices. The judge of the United States\r\nDistrict Court for Virginia was directed to hold courts in that\r\nCommonwealth, while it was made the duty of the Attorney-General to\r\ninstruct the proper officers to libel and bring to judgment,\r\nconfiscation and sale, property subject to confiscation, and to provide\r\nfor the administration of justice within the said State in all matters\r\nof which the Federal courts had cognizance.\r\n\r\nIt was this recognition of his government, and this assurance of\r\nsupport, that induced Mr. Pierpont less than three weeks afterward to\r\nremove his capital from Alexandria. An account of this event as well as\r\nof the nature of the Governor’s duties in his enlarged jurisdiction, has\r\nbeen anticipated.\r\n\r\nIn recognizing Mr. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia, President Johnson\r\nmerely concluded to retain for reconstruction what had already been\r\naccomplished by the loyal minority of that Commonwealth. Nor is it easy\r\nto perceive why, by rejecting what had been done, he should have\r\nincreased the difficulties of a situation even then sufficiently\r\ncomplicated. While military governor of Tennessee he had executed, and,\r\nso far as appears, without remonstrance, all the measures recommended by\r\nMr. Lincoln, so that when he succeeded to the Presidency he was to some\r\nextent committed to the policy of his predecessor. He preserved his\r\nconsistency by endeavoring to maintain that system in which he had\r\nformerly acquiesced, and in sustaining the reconstructed governments of\r\nLouisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia it is somewhat hazardous to\r\naffirm that he acted unwisely. More than this the adherents of President\r\nLincoln could not reasonably have expected. Mr. Johnson was not,\r\nhowever, required by any consideration of moment to apply that mode of\r\nrestoration to the seven remaining States; nor is it by any means\r\ncertain that he had a legal right to do so. With President Lincoln the\r\nproblem was to preserve the Union. To effect that object he believed it\r\nnecessary to institute loyal governments, and his action in so doing\r\nappears to have been clearly within his powers as Commander-in-Chief.\r\nHad his course been unwise or even prejudicial to national interests,\r\nthe reorganization of those States was still a legitimate war measure to\r\nwhich his discretion undoubtedly extended. When Andrew Johnson became\r\nPresident, however, the nature of the problem had greatly changed, for\r\neven though no proclamation had yet announced the termination of the\r\nRebellion, hostilities had entirely ceased before he issued the first of\r\nhis orders on reconstruction. It was only by something like a legal\r\nfiction, therefore, that the war powers could longer be exercised. It is\r\nbelieved that his failure to recognize the different circumstances was\r\nan error of judgment. The danger of a renewal of the conflict was not\r\nsufficiently real to justify a continuance of the unlimited authority\r\nthat might be deemed necessary in time of war. He was aware that\r\nCongress had refused to admit representatives or to count electoral\r\nvotes from those States reorganized during the Rebellion, when the\r\naction of the Executive rested on the firm, if somewhat undefined,\r\nfoundation of the war powers. After a majority, even in these\r\ncircumstances, had pronounced against that system, on what ground could\r\nthe new President base his expectation of success? Without first\r\nassuring himself of the coöperation of the Legislative branch he should\r\nnot have undertaken the arduous task of reviving Union governments in\r\nthose commonwealths where even the very image of civil authority had\r\nbeen effaced. Perhaps he had been convinced that the method of\r\nrestoration was analogous to the process of terminating war with a\r\nforeign power in which the initiative is to be taken by the Executive\r\nDepartment of Government. On this subject Mr. Blaine acutely remarks,\r\nthat, “There is nothing of which a public officer can be so easily\r\npersuaded as of the enlarged jurisdiction that pertains to his\r\nstation.”[466] It was while executing his measures of reconstruction\r\nthat Mr. Lincoln discovered the real sentiments and, to his surprise, no\r\ndoubt, encountered the determined opposition of Congress. In the case of\r\nhis successor the same excuse cannot be urged, for he was aware of the\r\ntemper of the Republican majority, and appears to have consulted only\r\nhis courage in espousing a cause already condemned by many of the most\r\ninfluential leaders of the party to which he principally owed his\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nAs the order recognizing the Alexandria government marked no distinct\r\nExecutive policy, speculation could still amuse or employ itself on the\r\nexpected announcement by the new President. The first step in that\r\nmomentous undertaking was the appointment, May 29, 1865, of William W.\r\nHolden as Provisional Governor of North Carolina. The order promulgating\r\nthat measure was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution\r\n  of the United States declares that the United States shall guarantee\r\n  to every State in the Union a republican form of government, and\r\n  shall protect each of them against invasion and domestic violence;\r\n  and whereas the President of the United States is, by the\r\n  Constitution, made commander-in-chief of the army and navy, as well\r\n  as chief civil executive officer of the United States, and is bound\r\n  by solemn oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the\r\n  United States, and to take care that the laws be faithfully\r\n  executed; and whereas the rebellion, which has been waged by a\r\n  portion of the people of the United States against the properly\r\n  constituted authorities of the Government thereof, in the most\r\n  violent and revolting form, but whose organized and armed forces\r\n  have now been almost entirely overcome, has, in its revolutionary\r\n  progress, deprived the people of the State of North Carolina of all\r\n  civil government; and whereas it becomes necessary and proper to\r\n  carry out and enforce the obligations of the United States to the\r\n  people of North Carolina, in securing them in the enjoyment of a\r\n  republican form of government:\r\n\r\n  Now, therefore, in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed\r\n  upon me by the Constitution of the United States, and for the\r\n  purpose of enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a\r\n  State government, whereby justice may be established, domestic\r\n  tranquillity insured, and loyal citizens protected in all their\r\n  rights of life, liberty, and property, I, Andrew Johnson, President\r\n  of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy of\r\n  the United States, do hereby appoint William W. Holden, Provisional\r\n  Governor of the State of North Carolina, whose duty it shall be, at\r\n  the earliest practicable period, to prescribe such rules and\r\n  regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a\r\n  convention, composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of\r\n  the people of said State who are loyal to the United States, and no\r\n  others, for the purpose of altering or amending the constitution\r\n  thereof; and with authority to exercise, within the limits of said\r\n  State, all the powers necessary and proper to enable such loyal\r\n  people of the State of North Carolina to restore said State to its\r\n  constitutional relations to the Federal Government, and to present\r\n  such a republican form of State government as will entitle the State\r\n  to the guarantee of the United States therefor, and its people to\r\n  protection by the United States against invasion, insurrection, and\r\n  domestic violence; _Provided_, that in any election that may be\r\n  hereafter held for choosing delegates to any State convention, as\r\n  aforesaid, no person shall be qualified as an elector, or shall be\r\n  eligible as a member of such convention, unless he shall have\r\n  previously taken the oath of amnesty, as set forth in the\r\n  President’s proclamation of May 29, A. D. 1865, and is a voter\r\n  qualified as prescribed by the Constitution and laws of the State of\r\n  North Carolina, in force immediately before the 20th day of May,\r\n  1861, the date of the so-called ordinance of secession; and the said\r\n  convention when convened, or the Legislature that may be thereafter\r\n  assembled, will prescribe the qualifications of electors, and the\r\n  eligibility of persons to hold office under the Constitution and\r\n  laws of the State, a power the people of the several States\r\n  composing the Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the\r\n  origin of the Government to the present time.\r\n\r\n  And I do hereby direct:\r\n\r\n  _First._ That the military commander of the Department, and all\r\n  officers and persons in the military and naval service aid and\r\n  assist the said Provisional Governor in carrying into effect this\r\n  proclamation, and they are enjoined to abstain from, in any way,\r\n  hindering, impeding or discouraging the loyal people from the\r\n  organization of a State Government, as herein authorized.\r\n\r\nThen followed instructions, similar to those contained in the order of\r\nMay 9, relative to Virginia, directing the heads of the several\r\nExecutive Departments to enforce those Federal laws in North Carolina of\r\nwhich the administration belonged to their respective offices.\r\n\r\nSomewhat earlier on the same day was published an Amnesty Proclamation,\r\nrenewing in effect the provisions of that issued by Mr. Lincoln on the\r\n8th of December, 1863. It increased, however, the number of classes\r\nexcepted from the benefits of the original offer by adding the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  All persons who have been or are absentees from the United States\r\n  for the purpose of aiding the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  All military and naval officers in the rebel service, who were\r\n  educated by the Government in the Military Academy at West Point or\r\n  the United States Naval Academy.\r\n\r\n  All persons who held the pretended offices of governors of States in\r\n  insurrection against the United States.\r\n\r\n  All persons who left their homes within the jurisdiction and\r\n  protection of the United States, and passed beyond the Federal\r\n  military lines into the pretended confederate States for the purpose\r\n  of aiding the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  All persons who have been engaged in the destruction of the commerce\r\n  of the United States upon the high seas, and all persons who have\r\n  made raids into the United States from Canada, or been engaged in\r\n  destroying the commerce of the United States upon the lakes and\r\n  rivers that separate the British Provinces from the United States.\r\n\r\n  All persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits\r\n  hereof by taking the oath herein prescribed, are in military, naval,\r\n  or civil confinement, or custody, or under bonds of the civil,\r\n  military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States, as\r\n  prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind,\r\n  either before or after conviction.\r\n\r\n  All persons who have voluntarily participated in said rebellion, and\r\n  the estimated value of whose taxable property is over twenty\r\n  thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n  All persons who have taken the oath of amnesty as prescribed in the\r\n  President’s proclamation of December 8, A. D. 1863, or an oath of\r\n  allegiance to the Government of the United States since the date of\r\n  said proclamation, and who have not thenceforward kept and\r\n  maintained the same inviolate.[467]\r\n\r\nThe proclamation provided, however, that persons belonging to the\r\nexcluded classes could make special application for pardon, when such\r\nliberal clemency would be exercised by the President as was deemed\r\nconsistent with the facts in each case, and with the peace and dignity\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nSecretary Seward, who attested the proclamation, approved its general\r\ntenor as well as its details. At first he appears to have opposed the\r\n“Twenty-thousand-dollar exclusion,” but finally yielded to the arguments\r\nof the President, who by this description had hoped to include a\r\nnumerous class that did not come under any of those specified. In this\r\nrespect it possessed the comprehensive as well as the convenient\r\ncharacter of a general warrant. All attempts to fix responsibility for\r\nsecession have proved futile, and it is difficult to explain the\r\nPresident’s attitude toward Southern men of property unless, indeed, he\r\nmeant to humiliate a class that he personally disliked, or, perhaps, he\r\nintended to act upon the principle that to be mild it is necessary first\r\nto appear cruel. Precisely why the other classes were excepted from the\r\noffer of indemnity the reader of Rebellion literature need not be\r\ninformed. The amnesty proclamation applied to all the insurgent States.\r\n\r\nLike the “Louisiana plan,” the order appointing Mr. Holden was based on\r\nthat clause of the Federal Constitution which guarantees “to every State\r\nin this Union a republican form of government.” It was in his character\r\nof Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, as well as Executive, that\r\nhe assumed to appoint a provisional governor. The Rebellion, which in\r\nits progress had “deprived the people of the State of North Carolina of\r\nall civil government,” he described as having been “almost entirely\r\novercome.” This condition rendered it necessary to fulfill the Federal\r\nobligation to secure to the people of that State a republican form of\r\ngovernment. The order being self-explanatory, it only remains to observe\r\nthat none but “loyal people” were to participate in electing delegates\r\nto the convention, which it was made the duty of the Governor to\r\nconvoke. The term “loyal people” included all who would take the oath\r\nand receive the pardon provided for in the proclamation. These were\r\nrequired to be qualified voters under the laws in force immediately\r\nbefore the act of secession. By this provision the negroes of the State\r\nwere excluded from the electoral people, and the work of reconstruction\r\nleft entirely in the hands of the whites. The convention chosen by these\r\ncitizens, or the Legislature that might be thereafter assembled, was\r\nauthorized to “prescribe the qualifications of electors, and the\r\neligibility of persons to hold office under the constitution and laws of\r\nthe State, a power,” added the order, which “the people of the several\r\nStates composing the Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the\r\norigin of the Government to the present time.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Holden in a proclamation of June 12, 1865, announced his\r\nappointment and declared his purpose to order an election of delegates\r\nto a State convention, the object of calling which was briefly noticed.\r\nHe also made known his intention to commission justices of the peace for\r\nthe purpose of administering the oath of allegiance and opening the\r\npolls. He urged the people to resume their accustomed pursuits; refugees\r\nwere encouraged by an offer of protection to return to the State, and\r\nfreedmen were instructed in the duties peculiar to their altered\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nBy a second proclamation, dated August 8, the choice of delegates to the\r\nproposed convention was fixed for September 21 succeeding. Some delay in\r\nappointing a date for holding the election was occasioned by a desire to\r\nafford the people an opportunity of enrolling their names and obtaining\r\nthe required certificates.\r\n\r\nBy such voters as were not included in any of the excepted classes,\r\ntogether with the few who had been able to procure the Presidential\r\npardon, full delegations were chosen in all but three counties. The\r\ndetails of this election accessible to the writer are exceedingly\r\nmeagre. Owing much to the timely publication and the admirable character\r\nof the orders of General Schofield, who had exercised the functions of\r\nmilitary governor until superseded by Mr. Holden, the contest appears to\r\nhave been free from unusual violence, though newspaper correspondents,\r\nit is true, reported disturbances at several polling places and mention\r\nrumors of rioting.\r\n\r\nThe convention, which assembled at Raleigh on October 2, was composed\r\nfor the most part of members who had either openly opposed or\r\nreluctantly joined the secession movement. There were few, however, who\r\nhad not given aid and comfort to the enemy. In other words, they were\r\nWhigs and conservative Democrats. Every representative readily took the\r\noath to support the Constitution of the United States. The convention\r\norganized by electing Edwin G. Reade, an ex-member of the Thirty-fifth\r\nCongress, as president. On taking his seat Mr. Reade made an appropriate\r\nand conciliatory address.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Governor also submitted to the members of the convention\r\na brief message in which he observed that their duties were too plain to\r\nrequire any suggestions from him. North Carolina, he said, attempted in\r\nMay, 1861, to separate herself from the Union. That attempt involved her\r\nin protracted and disastrous war. She entered the rebellion a\r\nslaveholding and emerged from it a non-slaveholding State. “In other\r\nrespects,” he declared, “so far as her existence as a State and her\r\nrights as a State are concerned, she has undergone no change.”[468] He\r\nassumed that the convention would insert in the organic law a provision\r\nforever prohibiting involuntary servitude in North Carolina. The\r\nlanguage abolishing that institution, the form of the resolution\r\nabrogating the ordinance of secession and the nature of the action to be\r\ntaken on the war debt were the most important questions before the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nOn October 7 the repealing ordinance was passed unanimously in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  The ordinance of the convention of the State of North Carolina,\r\n  ratified on the 21st day of November, 1789, which adopted and\r\n  ratified the Constitution of the United States, and also all acts\r\n  and parts of acts of the General Assembly ratifying and adopting\r\n  amendments to the said Constitution, are now, and at all times since\r\n  the adoption and ratification thereof, have been, in full force and\r\n  effect, notwithstanding the supposed ordinance of the 20th of May,\r\n  1861, declaring the same to be repealed, rescinded, and abrogated;\r\n  and the said supposed ordinance is now, and at all times hath been,\r\n  null and void.[469]\r\n\r\nThe resolution abolishing slavery, reported on the following day, was\r\nadopted on the 9th of October, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Be it declared and ordained by the delegates of the people of the\r\n  State of North Carolina in convention assembled, and it is hereby\r\n  declared and ordained_, That slavery and involuntary servitude,\r\n  otherwise than for crimes, whereof the parties shall have been duly\r\n  convicted, shall be, and is hereby, forever prohibited within the\r\n  State.[470]\r\n\r\nNot without some reluctance there was also adopted a resolution\r\nprohibiting any future Legislature from assuming or paying any State\r\ndebt created directly or indirectly for the purpose of aiding the\r\nRebellion. There seems to have been in the convention a strong element\r\nopposed to the passage of such a measure, or at all events who preferred\r\nto refer it to a popular vote. The decision of the convention on this\r\nsubject appears to have been influenced by a telegram from the President\r\nto Governor Holden, in which the former says:\r\n\r\n  Every dollar of the debt created to aid the rebellion against the\r\n  United States should be repudiated finally and forever. The great\r\n  mass of the people should not be taxed to pay a debt to aid in\r\n  carrying on a rebellion which they in fact, if left to themselves,\r\n  were opposed to. Let those who have given their means for the\r\n  obligations of the State look to that power they tried to establish\r\n  in violation of law, Constitution, and will of the people. They must\r\n  meet their fate. It is their misfortune, and cannot be recognized by\r\n  the people of any State professing themselves loyal to the\r\n  Government of the United States and in the Union....[471]\r\n\r\nThe convention adjourned October 19 to reassemble on the fourth Thursday\r\nof May, 1866. Judge Reade, its president, previously delivered a\r\nfarewell address, in which he said: “Our work is finished. The breach in\r\nthe Government, as far as the same was by force, has been overcome by\r\nforce; and so far as the same has had the sanction of legislation, the\r\nlegislation has been declared to be null and void. So that there remains\r\nnothing to be done except the withdrawal of military power when all our\r\ngovernmental relations will be restored, without further asking, on the\r\npart of the United States. The element of slavery, which so long\r\ndistracted and divided the sections, has by an unanimous vote been\r\nabolished. Every man in the State is free. The reluctance which for a\r\nwhile was felt to the sudden and radical change in our domestic\r\nrelations—a reluctance which was made oppressive to us by our kind\r\nfeelings for the slave, and by our apprehensions of the evils which were\r\nto follow him—has yielded to the determination to be to him, as we\r\nalways have been, his best friends; to advise, protect, educate and\r\nelevate him; to seek his confidence, and to give him ours, each\r\noccupying appropriate positions to the other.... It remains for us to\r\nreturn to our constituents and engage with them in the great work of\r\nrestoring our beloved State to order and prosperity.”[472]\r\n\r\nAn election, fixed for November 9, was ordered by Mr. Holden for the\r\nchoice of Governor, members of a General Assembly, county officers and\r\nRepresentatives in Congress. On the same occasion the people were to\r\nvote on the ordinance abolishing and prohibiting slavery. The action of\r\nthe convention on the Confederate debt being final, that subject was not\r\nreferred to the popular judgment.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the convention the president and other delegates soon after\r\nadjournment proceeded to Washington to acquaint Mr. Johnson with the\r\nresult of their deliberations. They related to him what has already been\r\nplaced before the reader. As the convention had yielded what was\r\ninvolved in the war, President Johnson was requested to declare on the\r\npart of the Federal authorities that the governmental relations of North\r\nCarolina had been reconciled. Notwithstanding what had been done they\r\nfeared that their State delegation would be excluded from Congress by\r\nthe imposition of a test oath which few men in that commonwealth could\r\ntake. The convention, therefore, petitioned Congress, through Mr.\r\nJohnson, to repeal the requirement. The President, after expressing his\r\nsatisfaction with what North Carolina had done, reminded the delegates\r\nthat to make restoration practicable one thing still remained to be\r\naccomplished, namely, their acceptance of the amendment abolishing\r\nslavery throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThe ordinances submitted to the people were ratified at the November\r\nelection, when Jonathan Worth was chosen Governor over Mr. Holden by a\r\nmajority of 6,730, in a total of 58,554 votes. The repeal of the\r\nsecession ordinance was ratified by a vote of 20,506 to 2,002, and that\r\nprohibiting slavery by 19,039 against 3,970.\r\n\r\nIn a dispatch of November 27, President Johnson, thanking the\r\nProvisional Governor for the efficient manner in which he had executed\r\nhis duties, said that the result of the election was greatly to damage\r\nthe prospects of the State in the restoration of its government, that if\r\nthe action and spirit of the Legislature were in the same direction it\r\nwould greatly increase the harm already done, and might prove fatal. He\r\nhoped the mischief would be repaired.[473]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Legislature during a brief session ratified, with only six\r\ndissenting votes, the Thirteenth Amendment, and elected John Pool and\r\nWilliam A. Graham United States Senators. Seven Representatives in\r\nCongress had been previously chosen.\r\n\r\nMr. Holden, who continued to perform the functions of his office until\r\nthe inauguration of his successor on the 15th of December, probably owed\r\nhis appointment to his reputation as a Democratic editor. Though his\r\nrise to political prominence was similar to that of the President, he\r\nhad not the latter’s inflexibility of principle. A secessionist in 1856,\r\nwhen the success of Fremont appeared probable, he soon began to recede\r\nfrom that position, and in 1859 was opposed to disunion; subsequently he\r\ndrifted with the popular current and even went so far in an advanced\r\nstage of the Rebellion as to advocate a “last-dollar-and-last-man”\r\nresolution. But even this, together with the expression of extreme\r\nopinions, did not restore him to public confidence, and before the end\r\nof the war the _Standard_, which he edited, became the organ of the\r\ndisaffected. Notwithstanding this wavering and inconsistent career the\r\nfact that he was generally regarded as an enemy of secession singled him\r\nout as the proper person to reorganize the government of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThough the President was not indifferent to the demoralized condition of\r\nhis native State, that consideration alone does not appear to have\r\ninduced him to begin the process of reconstruction with that\r\ncommonwealth. There is strong testimony to prove that Mr. Lincoln had\r\nprepared a similar proclamation for restoring the former relations of\r\nNorth Carolina, and on July 8, 1867, General Grant testified before the\r\nJoint Committee on Reconstruction that he had twice heard read at\r\nmeetings of Mr. Lincoln’s Cabinet a paper embodying the same provisions\r\nas that published by President Johnson.\r\n\r\nBefore taking the second step a brief interval elapsed; perhaps the\r\nPresident was hesitating; however this may be, he informed Hon. George\r\nS. Boutwell that “the measure was tentative.” The fears of the\r\nMassachusetts statesman and his concern for harmony in the Republican\r\nparty, of which he was an able and honored leader, induced him, in\r\ncompany with Senator Morrill, of Vermont, to call on the President.\r\nDuring their conversation Mr. Johnson, when the dangers of his policy\r\nwere indicated, assured his visitors “that nothing further would be done\r\nuntil the experiment had been tested.”[474]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this deliberate assurance, the President at that time\r\nappears to have almost determined on the system that he intended to\r\nadopt, for scarcely two weeks had passed when he appointed, by a\r\nproclamation similar to that for North Carolina, William L. Sharkey,\r\nProvisional Governor of Mississippi. Within a month from the date of Mr.\r\nHolden’s appointment others were made for all the remaining States\r\nexcept Florida, the order for reorganizing which was delayed till July\r\n13.[475]\r\n\r\nThe origin and development of the Executive plan having now been traced\r\nwith some degree of minuteness, it is not the design of this essay to\r\npursue circumstantially the institution of that system in the six\r\nremaining States. By proclamations almost identical with that issued in\r\nthe case of North Carolina, provisional governors were appointed in all\r\nof those commonwealths before the middle of July. Though the method of\r\nreorganization in these States presented similar features, several were\r\ndistinguished in some respects from the others. Observations on those\r\ndifferences will employ nearly all that remains to be said on\r\nReconstruction under President Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Mr. Holden alarmed Republican leaders; the successive\r\nproclamations for restoring the other States directed public attention\r\nto the questions involved in reconstruction. Seeing that Congress was\r\nnot in session, that the President had assumed an expectant attitude,\r\nand that every plan of reunion proposed was liable to serious objection,\r\nit is not a matter of wonder that the recent Confederate authorities\r\nattempted of themselves to restore Federal relations.\r\n\r\nThese were among the considerations that induced Governor Clarke, of\r\nMississippi, to summon the Legislature of that State to meet on May 18.\r\nIn his address convoking the disloyal assembly he urged the people, in\r\norder to remove the necessity for sending Federal troops among them, to\r\nrestore and preserve peace. The Legislature came together accordingly,\r\nand, among other measures, provided for the election, on June 19, of\r\ndelegates to a State convention. Before that date, however, the\r\nPresident had appointed William L. Sharkey, an eminent jurist,\r\nProvisional Governor, thus ignoring both the measures of Mr. Clarke and\r\nthe insurgent assembly. The latter was dispersed by a military order,\r\nwhile the Governor was carried off to a fortress in Boston harbor.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharkey, in a dutiful and able address, appointed August 7 as the\r\nday for holding an election of delegates to a State convention which was\r\nto meet at the city of Jackson one week later. In this proclamation, he\r\nsaid: “The negroes are now free—free by the fortunes of war—free by\r\nproclamation—free by common consent—free practically, as well as\r\ntheoretically, and it is too late to raise questions as to the means by\r\nwhich they became so.”[476] Though the Governor, to avoid the delay of\r\nseparate county organization, had appointed many local officials who had\r\nheld their posts during the Rebellion, he required all of them to take\r\nthe oath of allegiance prescribed by the President.\r\n\r\nThe convention, which assembled at the appointed time, declared the\r\nordinance of secession null and void, prohibited slavery and made it the\r\nduty of the next Legislature to provide for the protection of the person\r\nand the property of freedmen. The lawmaking body was also to take\r\nmeasures for guarding both the negroes and the commonwealth against any\r\nevils that might arise from sudden emancipation. The first Monday in\r\nOctober was appointed for the election of State officers and members of\r\nCongress. A memorial was also adopted urging the President to remove the\r\ncolored troops from the State. The members, acting apparently in their\r\nindividual capacity, united in a petition for the pardon of Jefferson\r\nDavis and of Governor Clarke. The amendment of the State constitution\r\nabolishing slavery was adopted by the decisive vote of 86 to 11. After\r\nSouth Carolina, Mississippi contained the greatest proportion of slaves,\r\nand was thus very deeply involved in the system.\r\n\r\nWhile the convention was in session the President sent to Governor\r\nSharkey a telegram in which he made the following remarkable suggestion:\r\n\r\n  I am gratified to see that you have organized your convention\r\n  without difficulty.... If you could extend the elective franchise to\r\n  all persons of color who can read the Constitution of the United\r\n  States in English and write their names, and to all persons of color\r\n  who own real estate valued at not less than two hundred and fifty\r\n  dollars and pay taxes thereon, you would completely disarm the\r\n  adversary and set an example the other States will follow. This you\r\n  can do with perfect safety, and you would thus place Southern States\r\n  in reference to free persons of color upon the same basis with the\r\n  free States. I hope and trust your convention will do this, and as a\r\n  consequence the radicals, who are wild upon negro franchise, will be\r\n  completely foiled in their attempts to keep the Southern States from\r\n  renewing their relations to the Union by not accepting their\r\n  Senators and Representatives.[477]\r\n\r\nFrom the view point of practical politics this recommendation was\r\nundoubtedly a wise one, but it will scarcely be contended that it was\r\nthe suggestion of enlightened statesmanship. The South, distrusting the\r\nPresident’s sincerity, refused to adopt his suggestion. The\r\ncommunication is reproduced, not to show that the President was not\r\nalways impelled by the highest motives so much as to show that even\r\nbefore Congress had assembled he had already come to regard as “the\r\nadversary” those whose exertions secured his election.\r\n\r\nIn his proclamation appointing a date for the election of delegates\r\nGovernor Sharkey advised the people, when it might be necessary in\r\nconsequence of the remoteness of a military force, to form a county\r\npatrol for the apprehension of offenders. Information having reached him\r\nthat in many parts of the State organized bands had been robbing and\r\nplundering, and that the Federal troops were insufficient to suppress\r\nthese disorders, he urged citizens, especially the young men who had “so\r\ndistinguished themselves for gallantry,” to organize promptly in each\r\ncounty volunteer companies, one of cavalry and one of infantry if\r\npracticable, to assist in detecting, punishing and preventing crime.\r\n\r\nFrom his headquarters at Vicksburg, General Slocum, the Federal\r\ncommander, immediately published an order to prevent the proposed\r\nreorganization of the militia. The contemplated force, he said, would be\r\nnumerically superior to his own, and, as many of the Union troops on\r\nduty in Mississippi were freedmen, collisions would be unavoidable. The\r\ncrimes referred to by Mr. Sharkey were, the General asserted, committed\r\nagainst Northern men, Government couriers and negroes. Southerners, it\r\nwas true, had been halted by these marauders, but were promptly released\r\nand informed that they had been stopped by mistake. Citizens who\r\nrecognized the persons were unwilling to disclose the names of these\r\nlawless members of the community. The State, too, he declared, had not\r\nyet been relieved from the attitude of hostility which she assumed\r\nagainst the General Government. Those engaged in attempts to organize\r\nthe militia would be arrested.\r\n\r\nFearing that the President would not support General Slocum, Carl\r\nSchurz, who had been sent South on a mission to assist in carrying out\r\nthe Administration policy, expressed in a communication to the President\r\nsome doubt as to the wisdom of the Governor’s action. To this the\r\nPresident, in a reply of August 30, said he presumed that General\r\nSlocum, without first consulting the Government, would issue no order\r\ninterfering with Mr. Sharkey in his effort to restore the functions of\r\nthe State government. In the matter of organizing patrols Mr. Johnson\r\ntook the same view as the Governor, and in that connection said, “The\r\npeople must be trusted with their government, and, if trusted, my\r\nopinion is that they will act in good faith and restore their former\r\nconstitutional relations with all the States composing the Union.”[478]\r\n\r\nThe lapse of fifteen months had worked a revolution in the opinions of\r\nthe President. Circumstances, it is true, had changed since the delivery\r\nof his Nashville speech; the main question, however, had not greatly\r\naltered, for it was still important to determine the political people of\r\nthe late insurgent States. From declaring that “rebels” must take a back\r\nseat in the work of restoration, the President had come to believe that\r\n“the people must be trusted with their government.” It is not to convict\r\nMr. Johnson of inconsistency that his opinions are here brought into\r\njuxtaposition, but rather to inquire whether every important\r\nconsideration for ignoring secessionists in 1864 had disappeared by\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nOn representation from the Provisional Governor that the Federal\r\ncommander interfered to prevent the execution of his proclamation for\r\nreorganizing the militia, the President on September 2 required General\r\nSlocum to revoke his military order. Under instructions somewhat\r\nperemptory in tone, that officer two days later rescinded his\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the freedmen, as well as their exact legal status,\r\nbecame about this time the subject of much discussion in Mississippi.\r\nWhile many continued in the service of their old masters, numbers roamed\r\nabout the country in idleness, and nearly all of them had very\r\nextravagant notions of their newly acquired rights and privileges.\r\nThough the whites admitted of necessity the complete freedom, they were\r\nfor the most part unprepared to grant equal rights to negroes. Between\r\nthem and their employers, however, there occurred but little serious\r\ntrouble. All labor was contracted for, and owners of plantations,\r\napprehensive that labor would be difficult to secure at the beginning of\r\nthe season, were anxious to make contracts for the year 1866. Toward the\r\nclose of September the assistant commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau\r\nturned over to the civil authorities all the business of his court. To\r\nget rid of military tribunals, Governor Sharkey promised that in all\r\ncases involving the rights of negroes their testimony would be accepted.\r\n\r\nIn the election, which was held on October 9, General Benjamin G.\r\nHumphreys, late of the Confederate army, was chosen Governor;\r\nimmediately thereafter he was pardoned by the President. Five\r\nRepresentatives in Congress were also elected. By the Legislature, which\r\nconvened and organized one week later, Governor Sharkey was appointed\r\nUnited States Senator to fill the unexpired term of Jefferson Davis. For\r\nthe long term, Mr. J. L. Alcorn was elected. The legislation relative to\r\nfreedmen will be subsequently considered.\r\n\r\nBesides his complaint to the President relative to the interference of\r\nGeneral Slocum with the proposed reorganization of the militia, Governor\r\nSharkey expressed dissatisfaction with the military authorities who\r\nrefused to obey writs of _habeas corpus_ issued by local judges. To this\r\nSecretary Stanton replied that the grant of a provisional government did\r\nnot affect the proper jurisdiction of military courts, and that this\r\njurisdiction was still called for in cases of wrong done to soldiers,\r\nwhether white or colored, and in cases of wrong done to colored\r\ncitizens, and where the local authorities were unable or unwilling to do\r\njustice, either from defective machinery, or because some State law\r\ndeclared colored persons incompetent as witnesses. Mississippi was to a\r\nconsiderable extent still under military law, and the suspension of the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_ had not been revoked. To a similar remonstrance\r\nthe Secretary of State replied that, the commonwealth being still under\r\nmartial law, the military power was supreme.\r\n\r\nOn receiving tidings of General Johnston’s surrender, Governor Brown, of\r\nGeorgia, called a session of the Confederate Legislature, but General\r\nGilmore, who commanded the department including that commonwealth,\r\nissued a counter-proclamation annulling the late Executive’s order.\r\nGeneral Wilson, in writing the ex-Governor, used expressions that were\r\nneedlessly harsh, and whether the language was his own or that of the\r\nPresident, to whom the commander ascribed it, the style was neither\r\ndignified nor magnanimous. Whoever may have been responsible for the\r\nphraseology, the Union General appears to have believed in a rigorous\r\nexercise of the rights of conquest. With the defeat of this attempt of\r\nthe recent authorities to restore their commonwealth to its old status,\r\nGeorgia remained in military hands till the appointment, June 17, of\r\nJames Johnson as Provisional Governor.\r\n\r\nIn the work of reconciling the people of that State the Provisional\r\nExecutive was assisted by a sensible address of ex-Governor Brown, and\r\nby the support of many leading secessionists. Now that the\r\n“irrepressible conflict” had been settled, the people appeared anxious\r\nfor the reorganization of their State. The 4th of October was early\r\nfixed as the date for holding an election of delegates. The suffrage of\r\ncitizens was solicited and received by candidates of ability and\r\ncharacter. These were pledged to advocate the necessary measures for\r\nrestoring their commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe convention assembled at Milledgeville on October 25, was called to\r\norder by the Provisional Governor, and elected Herschel V. Johnson as\r\nits president. Instead of declaring the nullity of the secession and\r\nkindred ordinances the convention “repealed” them. On the question of\r\nrepudiating the war debt the vote stood 133 to 117 in favor of the\r\nproposition. This resolution, however, was not carried until November 7,\r\nand appears even then to have been passed only after considerable\r\npressure from Washington, whence the President directed or assisted by\r\ntelegraph the proceedings in all the reconstruction conventions. The war\r\ndebt thus declared void amounted to $18,135,775. The necessity for this\r\naction is evident; the hardships occasioned thereby can be easily\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe State constitution, which was thoroughly revised, recognized the\r\nchanges that had occurred in civil and social affairs. In that\r\ninstrument the freedom of slaves was expressly declared, and the\r\nLegislature was required to make regulations respecting the altered\r\nrelations of this class of persons. The constitution as thus amended was\r\nunanimously adopted by the convention.\r\n\r\nThough Georgia was not the most loyal supporter of Jefferson Davis in\r\nthe time of his prosperity, now that adversity had overtaken him, the\r\nconvention, in a memorial to President Johnson, invoked the Executive\r\nclemency in behalf of their late chief. The convention assumed for the\r\npeople their share in the crime for which Mr. Davis and a few others\r\nwere undergoing punishment.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Mississippi, the President approved the organization\r\nof “a police force” in the several counties, for the purpose of\r\narresting marauders, suppressing crime and enforcing authority.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature, which was elected November 15, assembled at\r\nMilledgeville on the 4th of December following. With its proceedings we\r\nare not now concerned more than to observe that the Thirteenth Amendment\r\nwas adopted by that body five days subsequently.[479] The measures of\r\nthe Georgia Assembly were not before Congress when it convened.\r\n\r\nLike the chief magistrates in several other Southern States, the\r\nConfederate Governor of Texas, when convinced after the surrender of\r\nGeneral Kirby Smith that the war had ceased, took steps toward bringing\r\nhis commonwealth into its old practical relations with the Union. He\r\naccordingly ordered an election of delegates to a convention to be held\r\non June 19, but was anticipated by President Johnson, who two days\r\nearlier had appointed Andrew J. Hamilton Provisional Governor. Though\r\nthe latter did not promptly appoint a day for holding the election, he\r\nannounced his intention of doing so at an early date. There was probably\r\nin the minds of the less intelligent Texans a notion that emancipation\r\nwas to be gradual, or that it was not yet an accomplished fact. To\r\ndispel any such idea the new Executive circulated an address which\r\ninformed the public that if, “in the action of the proposed convention,\r\nthe negro is characterized or treated as less than a freeman,” Senators\r\nand Representatives from Texas would vainly seek admission to the halls\r\nof Congress. The choice of delegates having been fixed for January 8,\r\n1866, an account of the convention or of the proceedings in the Assembly\r\nsubsequently organized in that State does not fall within the scope of\r\nthis work. In the interval justice was administered by officers\r\ntemporarily commissioned for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe negro population, which, because of the influx from other Southern\r\nStates, had doubled since 1860, presented a difficult problem in the\r\nreorganization of Texas. They knew little of the uses of freedom and\r\nwere kept systematically at work only by the candid admonitions of\r\nGeneral Granger and the Governor. Toward the close of December, however,\r\na better feeling prevailed among them; but it appears to have been a\r\nserious problem to have kept the freedmen of Texas steadily at work.\r\nPlanters throughout the State lost heavily by their inability to engage\r\nor to retain in their service laborers enough to gather the standing\r\ncotton crop. The full consideration of this subject is inseparable from\r\nan analysis of Texan legislation relative to freedmen. Though well\r\nadvanced, the reconstruction of Texas under the Executive plan was not\r\ncompleted before the meeting of the Thirty-ninth Congress.\r\n\r\nNothing in the reorganization of Alabama or of South Carolina calls for\r\nespecial mention. The same is true of Florida. Both the spirit and\r\ntendency of Southern legislation, however, require to be noticed, and\r\nwith that examination a brief recapitulation will complete this\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this inquiry two related topics require briefly to be\r\nnoticed, namely, the character of the reconstruction conventions, and\r\nthe _personnel_ as well as the spirit of the legislatures organized\r\nunder their authority. As to the former it may be observed that there\r\nwere several modes in which constitutional conventions could have been\r\nassembled; all, however, were objectionable because of an element of\r\nirregularity. Considering them chronologically, rather than logically,\r\nthe first was the method employed by the Union men of western Virginia.\r\nThe Wheeling convention of June, 1861, was composed of delegates chosen\r\nat elections called, not by the constituted authorities, for they were\r\nalready committed to a policy of rebellion, but by a spontaneous popular\r\nmovement inaugurated by loyal and influential leaders. The work of this\r\nbody, even though revolutionary, or at least irregular in its origin,\r\nwas acquiesced in by the people affected and subsequently approved by\r\nthe General Government. So few, however, were the loyalists of the\r\ninsurgent States generally, that it was not practicable elsewhere in the\r\nSouth to reorganize governments in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nA second mode was that adopted by Mr. Lincoln. Under this method, the\r\nPresident, as Commander-in-Chief, protected Union minorities in their\r\nefforts to reëstablish local governments in harmony with the Federal\r\nConstitution. This plan, it is evident, could be justified merely as a\r\nmilitary measure, and, therefore, was lawful only during the continuance\r\nof the Rebellion. On the return of peace all such provisional schemes\r\nwould disappear unless tolerated by the neglect or confirmed by the\r\nlegislation of Congress. The conventions held under this theory rested\r\non the authority of the commanding officer, who was himself acting by\r\nExecutive direction. In reorganizing the government of Louisiana,\r\nGeneral Banks, it will be remembered, declared that the fundamental law\r\nof that commonwealth was martial law, which was no more than his\r\narbitrary will. In purging the electoral people and amending the\r\nconstitution of that State he acted in strict conformity with that\r\nassumption. If in the preceding pages the reconstruction measures of Mr.\r\nLincoln have been characterized as legitimate, it must not be supposed\r\nthat it was intended to assert that they would have been lawful in time\r\nof peace, for under the American system it has never been deemed\r\ncompetent for the national Executive to call a convention. Though the\r\nestablishments instituted under his authority, except in the case of\r\nTennessee, never received the permanent sanction of Congress, the\r\nconventions which organized these governments stand on a foundation\r\nsomewhat different from those assembled by the appointees of President\r\nJohnson, for in the summer of 1865 the plea of military necessity could\r\nno longer be urged. If, therefore, the conventions held in Louisiana,\r\nArkansas and Tennessee were tainted with irregularity, those assembled\r\nin the remaining States were undoubtedly revolutionary. Technically,\r\nhowever, the conventions of both classes stand on the same footing.\r\nGovernor Perry, of South Carolina, regarded as revolutionary the body\r\nwhich he convoked to reorganize his commonwealth, and for that reason,\r\nas he alleged, dissolved the convention before it had taken final action\r\non the important question of the Southern debt.\r\n\r\nThe course of the Confederate governors of Mississippi, Georgia and\r\nTexas, who summoned the insurgent legislatures of their respective\r\nStates for the purpose of calling conventions, suggests a third mode in\r\nwhich the machinery of government could have been set in motion. This\r\nplan, however, presented an evident difficulty, inasmuch as these\r\nassemblies could not have been recognized without admitting in some sort\r\nthe validity of the secession and kindred ordinances. Mr. Lincoln, it is\r\ntrue, intended, before hostilities had ceased, to permit the members of\r\nthe Virginia Legislature to meet as influential individuals for the\r\npurpose of recalling their State troops from the Confederate army. The\r\nsurrender of Lee occurring soon after, and the President’s action having\r\nbeen misunderstood, he withdrew this permission, and did it the more\r\nreadily as the necessity which suggested it had passed completely away.\r\nThe department commanders prevented any response to the proclamations of\r\nthe Executives in the three States named above, and President Johnson by\r\nhis prompt appointment of provisional governors ignored or anticipated\r\ntheir action. To say nothing of the revolutionary course contemplated by\r\nthe ex-Confederate governors, the success of their plan required the\r\napproval or at least the connivance of Federal authorities.\r\n\r\nStill another manner of proceeding was for Congress, by calling or\r\nauthorizing conventions, to inaugurate the movement for reconstruction;\r\nbut the power of the national Legislature extends only to the passage of\r\nenabling acts for Territories, and these commonwealths appear to have\r\nbeen neither constitutional Territories nor constitutional States.\r\nHowever, as some irregularity was inseparable from any system of\r\nreorganization, the Legislative branch of Government was the authority\r\nleast objectionable for controlling informal changes in the nature of\r\nthe Union. If powers not conferred by the Constitution must be assumed,\r\nit is better in the interests of civil liberty for the representatives\r\nof the people to transcend the organic law.\r\n\r\nThe second mode, it need scarcely be observed, was that embodied in the\r\nExecutive plan. The conventions which assembled under encouragement and\r\ndirection of President Johnson had an opportunity unequaled since the\r\nformation of the Constitution of winning the gratitude of the nation. By\r\nadopting an enlightened and humane policy they could have furnished an\r\nexample of patriotism that would serve to influence the deliberations\r\nnot only of the first assemblies to meet under the new order, but of all\r\nfuture legislatures in those States. It is well known that they did not\r\nprove equal to this emergency; the concessions to Northern opinion were\r\nnot gracefully yielded, and lost much of their merit by having been\r\nextorted from the fears of the delegates. In some instances the\r\nconventions, by assuming functions of the ordinary legislative\r\ncharacter, transcended their powers, and many of them “repealed” the\r\nordinances without condemning the principle of secession. They amended\r\nand even adopted constitutions that were never submitted to the people.\r\nThe civil rights of the negro were abandoned to the mercy of those who\r\nhad fought to perpetuate human servitude. No provision was made for\r\nfreedmen in the fundamental law, it having been assumed that the new\r\nlegislatures could be trusted to extend justice equally to all classes\r\nin the community. In a word, those were disappointed who had expected\r\nfrom the conventions a display of civic virtues commensurate to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe remaining topic, that is, the character of the reconstructed\r\ngovernments as well as the spirit and tendency of their legislation, may\r\nin this place be briefly dismissed. Not, indeed, that the subject is\r\nunimportant, for it was mainly upon this question that the Thirty-ninth\r\nCongress justified its refusal to admit members from the South, and\r\nvindicated its rigorous treatment of the subjugated States. While an\r\ninvestigation of public opinion in that section is essential to a\r\ncorrect understanding of legislative action, the full consideration of\r\nthe subject belongs properly to a treatise on Congressional\r\nreconstruction, a theme to which this essay is only introductory. For\r\nthe present purpose, therefore, a brief outline must suffice.\r\n\r\nThough the reconstruction conventions were correctly regarded as\r\nrevolutionary, that character would not affect the legislatures\r\ninstituted by their authority if the people concerned acquiesced in\r\ntheir proceedings. Americans of that day were not altogether indifferent\r\nto the sacred right of revolution, even if the principle was not so\r\nhighly esteemed as formerly. An objection far more serious than the\r\nirregular origin of these conventions was the spirit which animated\r\nSouthern legislators.\r\n\r\nWhen the Thirty-ninth Congress convened at its first session members had\r\nbefore them only the merest fragments of the mass of testimony\r\nsubsequently reported by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, though\r\neven then they possessed evidence of the temper of the Southern mind\r\nsufficient, they believed, to recommend the most deliberate procedure.\r\nIt would not be difficult to collect from contemporary literature proofs\r\nof hostility to the General Government sufficient to justify the\r\nattitude of Congress when it assembled on the 4th of December, 1865.\r\nFrom various sources the Northern people had caught glimpses of the\r\nactual condition of affairs within the late Confederacy. These\r\nmanifestations of unfriendliness to the Union were enough to excite\r\nsuspicion, and, in a matter affecting the future welfare of a great and\r\npowerful nation, suspicion is a just ground for inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe alacrity with which the Southern people rushed to battle, as well as\r\nthe vigor with which they prosecuted the war, was a phenomenon not more\r\nremarkable than the unanimity and promptness with which they apparently\r\nacquiesced in the result. It was long before the people of the North\r\ncould believe that the rebellion was anything more than a leaders’\r\ninsurrection, and they could not easily be persuaded after its close\r\nthat those who had fought so desperately to destroy, were sincere in\r\ntheir professions of loyalty to, the Union. It was not unnatural,\r\ntherefore, that the late adversaries of the South would look with\r\nsuspicion on her instant submission. With few exceptions Southern\r\nstatesmen seemed desirous of effecting an early reunion. While various\r\nreasons might be assigned to explain this dutiful and almost unlimited\r\nobedience, it is certain that the argument chiefly relied upon by the\r\nprovisional governors was that it was only by such a course that they\r\ncould hope soon to be relieved of the presence among them of Yankee\r\nsoldiers. Apprehension that more burdensome conditions might be imposed\r\nby Stevens and other radical leaders in Congress was, perhaps, not\r\naltogether without influence in producing this general acquiescence in\r\nthe policy of the President.[480] As every citizen who engaged in\r\nrebellion had forfeited both his life and his estate, it would be\r\nprudent temporarily to conceal any feeling of resentment, or any desire\r\nof revenge. These considerations were not without influence on the\r\nconduct of both the leaders and the people. With the quick upgrowth,\r\nhowever, of a feeling of personal safety, encouraged, no doubt, by a\r\nlavish distribution of pardons, and with an expectation, not unfounded,\r\nthat reconciliation would speedily be followed by either a restoration\r\nof, or indemnity for, confiscated property, this policy of conformity\r\nwould vanish. Thus under exterior tranquillity rankled bitter memories\r\nof disaster and defeat nourishing a state of unrest which even the\r\nunquestioned influence of their late commanders could not always keep\r\nfrom expressing itself in acts of violence. However, as Henry Winter\r\nDavis had foretold, the Southern population generally put on the seemly\r\ngarb of peace and observed the form of holding elections.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that many of their most enlightened citizens\r\nrecommended, and that their most trusted leaders enjoined, submission to\r\nthe new order, the transition from a state of hostility was marked even\r\nat the outset by acts of the highest indiscretion. Nor were these\r\nconfined to irresponsible individuals whose utterances might have been\r\njustly regarded as the momentary inspiration of passion. Some of the\r\nacts referred to were the deliberate convictions of legislative bodies,\r\nand, as these measures appear to have escaped criticism, they may fairly\r\nbe supposed to reflect the sentiments of the South. In the circumstances\r\nthis was especially unfortunate, postponing as it did the day of peace\r\nand reconciliation; it afforded also a decent pretext to the “Radicals,”\r\nif they desired one, for excluding the Southern delegations from\r\nCongress. It justified inquiry, and investigation was fatal to Southern\r\nclaims of universal submission.\r\n\r\nThough the exclusion of representatives undoubtedly intensified, it did\r\nnot occasion the change in Southern feeling, for the Mississippi\r\nmeasures, presently to be noticed, were passed before the meeting of\r\nCongress. Acts of frequent occurrence tended to confirm the worst fears\r\nof that body, and long before the Joint Committee had completed their\r\nlabors they were supplied with new species of violence if any\r\ndescription of outrage was lacking to crown their indictment. With due\r\nallowance for the fact that during many years preceding the war outrages\r\nwere much more numerous in the slave than in the free States, it soon\r\nbecame apparent that it was unsafe to leave to the justice of Southern\r\ncourts either the few Unionists who had remained faithful in that\r\nsection or the recently enfranchised slaves. The estimation in which the\r\nformer were held appears in the fact that in competition for office they\r\nwere uniformly defeated by ex-Confederate candidates, sometimes by\r\nunpardoned, and even unrepentant ones. The feeling toward freedmen was\r\none of extreme bitterness. Overlooking scattered acts of violence and\r\noutrage of which negroes were generally, though not always, the victims,\r\nSouthern hostility toward them found unmistakable expression in the\r\nNovember legislation of Mississippi. On the 22d of that month was\r\nenacted a law regulating the relation of _master_ and _apprentice_ in\r\nthe case of “freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes.” Among other things\r\nthis statute provided:\r\n\r\n  That it shall be the duty of all ... civil officers ... in this\r\n  State to report to the probate courts of their respective counties,\r\n  semiannually, ... all freedmen, free negroes, and mulattoes, under\r\n  the age of eighteen, within their respective counties, beats or\r\n  districts, who are orphans, or whose parent or parents have not the\r\n  means, or who refuse to provide for and support said minors, and\r\n  thereupon it shall be the duty of said probate court to order the\r\n  clerk of said court to apprentice said minors to some competent and\r\n  suitable person, on such terms as the court may direct, having a\r\n  particular care to the interest of said minors: Provided, That the\r\n  former owner of said minors shall have the preference, when in the\r\n  opinion of the court, he or she shall be a suitable person for that\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2.... That the said court shall be fully satisfied that the\r\n  person or persons to whom said minor shall be apprenticed shall be a\r\n  suitable person to have the charge and care of said minor, and fully\r\n  to protect the interest of said minor. The said court shall require\r\n  the said master or mistress to execute bond and security, payable to\r\n  the State of Mississippi, conditioned that he or she shall furnish\r\n  said minor with sufficient food and clothing, to treat said minor\r\n  humanely, furnish medical attention in case of sickness, teach or\r\n  cause to be taught him or her to read and write, if under fifteen\r\n  years old, and will conform to any law that may be hereafter passed\r\n  for the regulation of the duties and relation of master and\r\n  apprentice: Provided, that said apprentice shall be bound by\r\n  indenture, in case of males until they are twenty-one years old, and\r\n  in case of females until they are eighteen years old.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 3.... That in the management and control of said apprentices,\r\n  said master or mistress shall have power to inflict such moderate\r\n  corporeal chastisement as a father or guardian is allowed to inflict\r\n  on his or her child or ward at common law: Provided, That in no case\r\n  shall cruel or inhuman punishment be inflicted.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 4.... That if any apprentice shall leave the employment of his\r\n  or her master or mistress, without his or her consent, said master\r\n  or mistress may pursue and recapture said apprentice, and bring him\r\n  or her before any justice of the peace of the county, whose duty it\r\n  shall be to remand said apprentice to the service of his or her\r\n  master or mistress; and in the event of a refusal on the part of\r\n  said apprentice so to return, then said justice shall commit said\r\n  apprentice to the jail of said county, on failure to give bond,\r\n  until the next term of the county court; and it shall be the duty of\r\n  said court, at the first term thereafter, to investigate said case,\r\n  and if the court shall be of opinion that said apprentice left the\r\n  employment of his or her master or mistress without good cause, to\r\n  order him or her to be punished, as provided for the punishment of\r\n  hired freedmen, as may be from time to time provided for by law, for\r\n  desertion, until he or she shall agree to return to his or her\r\n  master or mistress: Provided, that the court may grant continuances,\r\n  as in other cases; and provided further, that if the court shall\r\n  believe that said apprentice had good cause to quit his said master\r\n  or mistress, the court shall discharge said apprentice from said\r\n  indenture, and also enter a judgment against the master or mistress,\r\n  for not more than one hundred dollars, for the use and benefit of\r\n  said apprentice, to be collected on execution, as in other cases.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 5.... That if any person entice away any apprentice from his or\r\n  her master or mistress, or shall knowingly employ an apprentice, or\r\n  furnish him or her food or clothing, without the written consent of\r\n  his or her master or mistress, or shall sell or give said apprentice\r\n  ardent spirits, without such consent, said person so offending shall\r\n  be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and shall, on conviction\r\n  thereof before the county court, be punished as provided for the\r\n  punishment of persons enticing from their employer hired freedmen,\r\n  free negroes or mulattoes.[481]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of apprenticing minors it will be observed that the former\r\nowner, when a person satisfactory to the court, was to have the\r\npreference; in the event of his death his widow or other member of his\r\nfamily was, if deemed suitable, to have the preference in\r\nre-apprenticing the minor. When there was no record testimony of the\r\ndate of birth, judges of county courts were empowered to fix the age of\r\nthe minor. The act was to go into force immediately after its\r\npassage.[482]\r\n\r\nThe act of November 25, conferring civil rights on emancipated slaves,\r\nprovided:\r\n\r\n  That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes may sue and be sued,\r\n  implead and be impleaded in all the courts of law and equity of this\r\n  State, and may acquire personal property and chooses in action, by\r\n  descent or purchase, and may dispose of the same, in the same\r\n  manner, and to the same extent that white persons may; Provided,\r\n  that the provisions of this section [1] shall not be so construed as\r\n  to allow any freedman, free negro or mulatto, to rent or lease any\r\n  lands or tenements, except in incorporated towns or cities in which\r\n  places the corporate authorities shall control the same.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Sec. 5.... That every freedman, free negro and mulatto, shall, on\r\n  the second Monday of January, one thousand eight hundred and\r\n  sixty-six, and annually thereafter, have a lawful home or\r\n  employment, and shall have written evidence thereof, as follows, to\r\n  wit: if living in any incorporated city, town or village, a license\r\n  from the mayor thereof, and if living outside of any incorporated\r\n  city, town or village, from the member of the board of police of his\r\n  beat, authorizing him or her to do irregular and job work, or a\r\n  written contract, as provided in section six of this act, which\r\n  licenses may be revoked for cause, at any time, by the authority\r\n  granting the same.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 6.... That all contracts for labor made with freedmen, free\r\n  negroes and mulattoes, for a longer period than one month shall be\r\n  in writing and in duplicate, attested and read to said freedman,\r\n  free negro or mulatto, by a beat, city or county officer, or two\r\n  disinterested white persons of the county in which the labor is to\r\n  be performed, of which each party shall have one; and said contracts\r\n  shall be taken and held as entire contracts, and if the laborer\r\n  shall quit the service of the employer, before the expiration of his\r\n  term of service, without good cause he shall forfeit his wages for\r\n  that year, up to the time of quitting.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 7.... That every civil officer shall, and every person may\r\n  arrest and carry back to his or her legal employer any freedman,\r\n  free negro or mulatto, who shall have quit the service of his or her\r\n  employer before the expiration of his or her term of service without\r\n  good cause, and said officer and person shall be entitled to receive\r\n  for arresting and carrying back every deserting employee aforesaid,\r\n  the sum of five dollars, and ten cents per mile from the place of\r\n  arrest to the place of delivery, and the same shall be paid by the\r\n  employer, and held as a set-off for so much against the wages of\r\n  said deserting employee: Provided, that said arrested party after\r\n  being so returned may appeal to a justice of the peace or member of\r\n  the board of the police of the county, who on notice to the alleged\r\n  employer, shall try summarily whether said appellant is legally\r\n  employed by the alleged employer and has good cause to quit said\r\n  employer; either party shall have the right of appeal to the county\r\n  court, pending which the alleged deserter shall be remanded to the\r\n  alleged employer, or otherwise disposed of as shall be right and\r\n  just, and the decision of the county court shall be final.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 8.... That upon affidavit made by the employer of any freedman,\r\n  free negro or mulatto, or other credible person, before any justice\r\n  of the peace or member of the board of police, that any freedman,\r\n  free negro or mulatto, legally employed by said employer, has\r\n  illegally deserted said employment, such justice of the peace or\r\n  member of the board of police, shall issue his warrant or warrants,\r\n  returnable before himself, or other such officer, directed to any\r\n  sheriff, constable or special deputy, commanding him to arrest said\r\n  deserter and return him or her to said employer, and the like\r\n  proceedings shall be had as provided in the preceding section; and\r\n  it shall be lawful for any officer to whom such warrant shall be\r\n  directed to execute said warrant in any county of this State, and\r\n  that said warrant may be transmitted without indorsement to any like\r\n  officer of another county, to be executed and returned as aforesaid,\r\n  and the said employer shall pay the cost of said warrants and arrest\r\n  and return, which shall be set off for so much against the wages of\r\n  said deserter.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 9.... That if any person shall persuade or attempt to persuade,\r\n  entice or cause any freedman, free negro or mulatto, to desert from\r\n  the legal employment of any person, before the expiration of his or\r\n  her term of service, or shall knowingly employ any such deserting\r\n  freedman, free negro or mulatto, or shall knowingly give or sell to\r\n  any such deserting freedman, free negro or mulatto, any food,\r\n  raiment or other thing, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,\r\n  and upon conviction shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars\r\n  and not more than two hundred dollars and the costs, and if said\r\n  fine and costs shall not be immediately paid, the court shall\r\n  sentence said convict to not exceeding two months’ imprisonment in\r\n  the county jail, and he or she shall moreover be liable to the party\r\n  injured in damages: Provided, if any person shall, or shall attempt\r\n  to persuade, entice, or cause any freedman, free negro or mulatto,\r\n  to desert from any legal employment of any person with the view to\r\n  employ said freedman, free negro or mulatto, without the limits of\r\n  this State, such person, on conviction, shall be fined not less than\r\n  fifty dollars and not more than five hundred dollars and costs, and\r\n  if said fine and costs shall not be immediately paid, the court\r\n  shall sentence said convict to not exceeding six months’\r\n  imprisonment in the county jail.\r\n\r\nThis arbitrary and cruel act, wholly inconsistent with a state of\r\npersonal freedom, by forbidding the lease to freedmen, free negroes and\r\nmulattoes of either lands or tenements outside of cities, not only made\r\nof the emancipated slaves a landless and homeless class, but deprived\r\nthem of all hope of rising out of that condition. On the second Monday\r\nof January, 1866, less than two months after the passage of this act,\r\nand annually thereafter, they were required to have a lawful home or\r\nemployment, and to possess written evidence thereof. This requirement\r\nextended to the doing of even irregular and job work, and a written\r\ncontract for all labor for a longer period than one month. If the\r\nlaborer, without good cause, left the service of his employer before the\r\nexpiration of his term, he forfeited all wages for that year up to the\r\ntime of quitting. As the freedmen were wholly without representation in\r\nthe State judiciary, the master class could in every instance determine\r\nthe sufficiency of the cause. The intermarriage of the races was made a\r\nfelony, and the white or the black person convicted of that crime was to\r\nbe confined in the State penitentiary for life.[483] Southern whites had\r\nno objection to the personal attendance, even in first-class railway\r\ncoaches, of colored servants, but as other than a servant, the freedman\r\nwas considered exceedingly obnoxious, and this sentiment was enacted\r\nimmediately before either of the statutes mentioned, into a law which\r\nexcluded negroes from riding in cars of the first class.[484]\r\n\r\nThere was some apprehension lest this and similar legislation would lead\r\nto bloody outbreaks. The colored race generally was growing distrustful\r\nand discontented. The fear of violence was probably not unconnected with\r\nthe passage of a law approved November 29, which provided:\r\n\r\n  Sec. 1.... That no freedman, free negro or mulatto, not in the\r\n  military service of the United States Government, and not licensed\r\n  so to do by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or\r\n  carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk, or\r\n  bowie-knife, and on conviction thereof, in the county court, shall\r\n  be punished by fine, not exceeding ten dollars, and pay the costs of\r\n  such proceedings, and all such arms or ammunition shall be forfeited\r\n  to the informer, and it shall be the duty of every civil and\r\n  military officer to arrest any freedman, free negro or mulatto,\r\n  found with any such arms or ammunition, and cause him or her to be\r\n  committed for trial in default of bail.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2.... That any freedman, free negro or mulatto, committing\r\n  riots, routs, affrays, trespasses, malicious mischief and cruel\r\n  treatment to animals, seditious speeches, insulting gestures,\r\n  language or acts, or assaults on any person, disturbance of peace,\r\n  exercising the function of a minister of the Gospel without a\r\n  license from some regularly organized church, vending spirituous or\r\n  intoxicating liquors, or committing any other misdemeanor, the\r\n  punishment of which is not specifically provided for by law, shall,\r\n  upon conviction thereof, in the county court, be fined not less than\r\n  ten dollars and not more than one hundred dollars, and may be\r\n  imprisoned, at the discretion of the court, not exceeding thirty\r\n  days.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 3.... That if any white person shall sell, lend or give to any\r\n  freedman, free negro or mulatto, any fire-arms, dirk or bowie-knife,\r\n  or ammunition, or any spirituous or intoxicating liquors, such\r\n  person or persons so offending, upon conviction thereof, in the\r\n  county court of his or her county, shall be fined, not exceeding\r\n  fifty dollars, and may be imprisoned at the discretion of the court,\r\n  not exceeding thirty days....\r\n\r\n  Sec. 4.... That all the penal and criminal laws now in force in this\r\n  State, defining offences, and prescribing the mode of punishment for\r\n  crimes and misdemeanors committed by slaves, free negroes or\r\n  mulattoes, be and the same are hereby re-enacted, and declared to be\r\n  in full force and effect, against freedmen, free negroes and\r\n  mulattoes, except so far as the mode and manner of trial and\r\n  punishment have been changed or altered by law.\r\n\r\n  Sec. 5.... That if any freedman, free negro or mulatto, convicted of\r\n  any of the misdemeanors provided against in this act, shall fail or\r\n  refuse, for the space of five days after conviction, to pay the fine\r\n  and costs imposed, such person shall be hired out by the sheriff or\r\n  other officer, at public outcry, to any white person who will pay\r\n  said fine and all costs, and take such convict for the shortest\r\n  time.[485]\r\n\r\nThough the General Government was solemnly pledged to guarantee the\r\nentire freedom of the negro, he was completely disarmed by these\r\nstatutes, which were to be administered by men who had been but recently\r\nserving the Confederate cause. The purpose of the last measure is\r\nrendered clear by Section 4, which reënacted against freedmen all the\r\npenal and criminal laws that had applied to slaves. It revived, in\r\nshort, the black code of _ante bellum_ times.\r\n\r\nPersons convicted of vagrancy, under an amendatory act, approved\r\nNovember 24, 1865, were subject to a fine not exceeding one hundred\r\ndollars and costs, besides a maximum imprisonment of ten days. The first\r\nsection, which defined who were vagrants, was general in its\r\napplication. The provisions especially affecting freedmen were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Sec. 2.... That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this\r\n  State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in\r\n  January, 1866, or thereafter, with no lawful employment or business,\r\n  or found unlawfully assembling themselves together either in the day\r\n  or night time, and all white persons so assembling with freedmen,\r\n  free negroes or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen,\r\n  free negroes or mulattoes on terms of equality, or living in\r\n  adultery or fornication with a freedwoman, free negro or mulatto,\r\n  shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined\r\n  in the sum of not exceeding, in the case of a freedman, free negro\r\n  or mulatto, fifty dollars, and a white man two hundred dollars, and\r\n  imprisoned at the discretion of the court, the free negro not\r\n  exceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding six months.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Sec. 5.... That all fines and forfeitures collected under the\r\n  provisions of this act shall be paid into the county treasury for\r\n  general county purposes, and in case any freedman, free negro or\r\n  mulatto, shall fail for five days after the imposition of any fine\r\n  or forfeiture upon him or her for violation of any of the provisions\r\n  of this act, to pay the same, that it shall be, and is hereby made\r\n  the duty of the sheriff of the proper county to hire out said\r\n  freedman, free negro or mulatto, to any persons who will, for the\r\n  shortest period of service, pay said fine or forfeiture and all\r\n  costs: Provided, a preference shall be given to the employer, if\r\n  there be one, in which case the employer shall be entitled to deduct\r\n  and retain the amount so paid from the wages of such freedman, free\r\n  negro or mulatto, then due or to become due; and in case such\r\n  freedman, free negro or mulatto cannot be hired out, he or she may\r\n  be dealt with as a pauper.[486]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo extended knowledge of human affairs is necessary to perceive that, by\r\na rigorous enforcement of these laws, the great mass of freedmen could\r\nbe easily restored to a state of practical servitude during the season\r\nwhen their labor was desirable, and that for the remainder of the year\r\ntheir condition would be little better than that of the pauper. That the\r\ntwo races were regarded as equal before the law will scarcely be\r\ncontended. An act approved December 1 made it a misdemeanor in certain\r\ncases for either a white or a black man to hunt hogs or other stock upon\r\nany lands other than his own; the white man was liable, on conviction,\r\nto a fine of from $100 to $500, or imprisonment from one to three months\r\nin the county jail, or both, at the discretion of the court. For the\r\nsame offence no imprisonment was provided in the case of freedmen, and\r\nthe fine was fixed between $10 and $20. The latter, however, could be\r\nhired at public outcry to the lowest bidder who would pay the fine and\r\ncost. The employer, it was provided, was to have the preference in\r\nhiring.[487]\r\n\r\nThe Legislature first to meet under the reformed government not only\r\nexpressed for the people of Mississippi no profound regret for resisting\r\nthe Federal authority, but left no doubt in what estimation it held\r\nthose who fought for Southern independence by releasing ex-Confederate\r\nsoldiers from indictments for misdemeanors committed before the\r\nwar.[488] In perfect harmony with the spirit of this act of oblivion was\r\none which changed the name of Jones County to that of Davis, and the\r\nname of Ellisville in the same county to Leesburg.[489] This, it should\r\nbe observed, was only three days before the meeting of Congress.\r\n\r\nThis legislation, by no means the most severe enacted under the new\r\ngovernments, marks in Southern sentiment a reaction no less unexpected\r\nthan the complete and almost instantaneous submission following the\r\nsurrender of Johnston. The sudden change in opinion has been ingeniously\r\nand even absurdly accounted for. In the latter class of explanations may\r\nbe included the notion that the people of the South were exasperated by\r\nthe interference of Congress, that body, as already mentioned, not\r\nhaving convened till after the passage of the obnoxious laws. On the\r\nother hand, it was not generally known, even in Mississippi, that the\r\nPresident in the work of reorganization had resolved to ignore the\r\ncoördinate political branch of Government; he had, indeed, fairly\r\nsignified to Governor Sharkey the position that he intended to assume,\r\nbut his communication to that official, which was never designed for\r\npublication, was not immediately circulated through the State; the\r\nknowledge, therefore, that the Executive had concluded to oppose the\r\npolicy of Congress could not have been a factor in disturbing the brief\r\nrepose of the seceding States, and we must seek elsewhere for the cause.\r\n\r\nIn many of the insurgent commonwealths rebellion had involved almost\r\nevery citizen in the guilt of treason, almost every estate in the\r\nliability to confiscation. The President and his advisers hoped by a\r\ngenerous distribution of pardons to win the esteem and confidence of\r\nthis numerous and influential class, and to leave to “Radical” members\r\nof Congress the ungrateful office of punishment. This policy contributed\r\nto awaken the undaunted spirit of the South, and was, no doubt, an\r\nelement in unsettling the conditions that prevailed after the surrender.\r\nNorthern magnanimity, which was content to regard the defeat of\r\nsecession as sufficient discipline for the rebellious States, and the\r\nattitude of the Democratic party were also important influences in\r\nmisleading the South. More responsible for the reaction, however, than\r\nany of these was the unsatisfactory administration of the Freedmen’s\r\nBureau. The testimony of General Grant can be cited to prove that, while\r\naccomplishing much that was desirable, this institution was retarding\r\nsomewhat the progress of reconstruction. In a hurried tour of the late\r\nConfederate States he had observed that it was not conducted with good\r\njudgment or economy, and remarked in his report to the President that\r\n“the belief widely spread among the freedmen of the Southern States,\r\nthat the lands of their former owners will, at least in part, be divided\r\namong them, has come from the agents of this bureau. This belief is\r\nseriously interfering with the willingness of the freedmen to make\r\ncontracts for the coming year.... Many, perhaps the majority, of the\r\nagents of the Freedmen’s Bureau advise the freedmen that by their own\r\nindustry they must expect to live. To this end they endeavor to secure\r\nemployment for them, and to see that both contracting parties comply\r\nwith their engagements. In some instances, I am sorry to say, the\r\nfreedman’s mind does not seem to be disabused of the idea that a\r\nfreedman has the right to live without care or provision for the future.\r\nThe effect of the belief in division of lands is idleness and\r\naccumulation in camps, towns, and cities.”[490]\r\n\r\nThough its management was open to criticism, the necessity for the\r\nexistence of the bureau, to afford at least temporary protection to the\r\nnewly enfranchised, was perceived and acknowledged by the General. It\r\nprobably accorded well with the political aspirations of bureau agents\r\nto create in the minds of freedmen a belief that the Government would\r\ngive to each of them “forty acres of land and a mule”; for this\r\nexpectation would be a pledge of allegiance to the Federal\r\nrepresentative, without the approval of whom no negro could seriously\r\nhope to secure so enviable a start in his career of freedom.\r\n\r\nThat confusion would follow the violent overthrow of a long-established\r\nindustrial system was to be expected, and it was not unnatural for the\r\nSouth to ascribe to the influence of bureau agents much of the mischief\r\ninseparable from immediate emancipation. While the complaints of the\r\nlate insurgents were commonly considered with deference, it was scarcely\r\nto be expected that they would not sometimes be despised, and it would\r\nbe easy to impute to their discontent every outrage reported to the\r\nofficers of the bureau or the commanders of the posts. Though Federal\r\nrepresentatives as a rule labored faithfully to restore and preserve\r\norder, it would be singular if some of them, assuming the arrogant\r\nmanner of conquerors, did not occasionally depart from that system of\r\nconciliation which the generous nature of Mr. Lincoln had adopted.\r\n\r\nThese were among the causes of the Southern reaction. It is no\r\njustification of these severe and even cruel enactments to show, as Mr.\r\nHerbert has done, that similar laws disgraced the statute books of many\r\nNorthern States. In the settlement then in progress the Southern people\r\nconceded nothing of importance that was not won in the war, and if they\r\nwere as sincere in their desire for reunion as some writers contend,\r\nthey should not have feared the paradox of improving by their example\r\nthe ancient legislation of the free States, or have been alarmed at the\r\ninnovation of reducing to practice the principles of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied that there was considerable ground for complaint\r\nbecause of the influence of many employees of the bureau in demoralizing\r\nthe Southern system of labor, but the further punishment of a race that\r\nhad been trodden down by oppressive generations does not commend itself\r\nas either a humane or an enlightened remedy; besides, the South was\r\ngreatly indebted to the fidelity of the negro, who during the war\r\npossessed, without abusing, the opportunity as well as the capacity for\r\nmischief. On the other hand, there was some obligation to Northern men\r\nfor their magnanimity, and under wiser counsels their wishes, and even\r\ntheir prejudices, would have been respected. In the victorious section\r\npublic opinion, then in the formative stage, was watching anxiously the\r\nprogress and the proceedings of the new governments. Except a few\r\nextremists, the voters of the loyal States did not dream at that time,\r\nas was persistently asserted at the South, of forcing negro suffrage on\r\nthe rebellious States. They did, however, desire to see embodied in the\r\nnew State constitutions such provisions as would establish before the\r\nlaw the equality of all classes.\r\n\r\nWhile the policy of President Johnson did not altogether escape\r\ncriticism at the South, so general and so prompt was the acquiescence in\r\nhis plan, that when Congress convened nearly all the States recently in\r\nrebellion had remodeled their governments and elected members of\r\nCongress who were at the national capital waiting to be admitted to\r\nseats. Without separately considering the new establishments, they may\r\nbe described concisely and with sufficient accuracy as governments\r\ndiffering but little from those extinguished by the fall of the\r\nConfederacy. The members of the former, it is true, had taken an oath of\r\nallegiance, and the influence of that act upon their conduct will\r\npresently be noticed. Though it certainly was not the original\r\nintention, and appears never to have become the fixed purpose of Mr.\r\nJohnson to entrust to enemies of the Government the work of restoring\r\nthe insurgent States, the result of his endeavors was that\r\nreconstruction was left almost exclusively in the hands of those who had\r\nattempted to destroy the Union. It was precisely such a contingency that\r\nMr. Lincoln had in mind when he declared in his message of December 8,\r\n1863, that, “An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State\r\ngovernment, constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very\r\nelement against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is\r\nsimply absurd.”[491]\r\n\r\nThis deliberate statement, as well as the subsequent administrative acts\r\nof Mr. Lincoln, sufficiently disposes of the notion that he favored a\r\nrather loose system of reconstruction. Without attempting to distinguish\r\nbetween theories really identical, there was still a considerable\r\ndifference in the reorganization effected under the two Executives. The\r\nconditions which confronted the President and Congress in December,\r\n1865, could have arisen only from disregarding the principle laid down\r\nby Mr. Lincoln. From his solemn and reiterated declarations there can be\r\nlittle doubt that he would have rejected without hesitation any system\r\nof which the first fruits were little more than a nullification of his\r\ndecree of emancipation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his tireless threats of severity, we can easily perceive\r\nin the reorganization directed by Mr. Johnson, a noticeable falling back\r\nfrom the Executive plan of December, 1863, as announced and enforced by\r\nhis predecessor. Nor did this retrogression proceed from the greater\r\nhumanity, but rather from the greater weakness of the new President.\r\nEven in the matter of fealty there was a difference; for while the\r\nconflict was still doubtful, the taking of an oath of allegiance to the\r\nGeneral Government was a serious step for the Southern Unionist, because\r\nthe record thereafter singled him out, if not for destruction, at least\r\nfor annoyance, or for punishment by the friends of secession, and,\r\nperhaps, the oath then effected some such object as it was designed to\r\naccomplish. When war had ceased, however, there was no longer a choice\r\nof sides, and thenceforth universal swearing as an instrument of\r\ngovernment became practically worthless. It was not regarded, at all\r\nevents, as an efficient security for the future. Mr. Johnson probably\r\ncontinued to exact oaths of allegiance because they were formerly of\r\nvalue in distinguishing the friends from the enemies of the Government.\r\nThough professing the same general opinion on the subject of amnesty,\r\nthe principles on which the two Presidents granted pardons were\r\nsufficiently distinct.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that President Johnson, who had once declared that “rebels”\r\nshould take a back seat in the work of reconstruction, so far changed\r\nhis opinion that he subsequently said the people must be trusted in the\r\nrestoration of their governments; he likewise modified his early\r\nimpressions as to the permanence of the establishments instituted under\r\nhis predecessor, for it was his original opinion that those governments\r\nwere merely provisional in their nature, and would require the\r\nconfirmation or the approval of Congress. Ultimately, however, he came\r\nto regard himself as the judge of their sufficiency. The evidence of\r\nthis is conclusive. In a telegram of July 14, 1865, to Governor Sharkey,\r\nSecretary Seward said:\r\n\r\n“The government of the State [Mississippi] will be provisional only\r\nuntil the civil authorities shall be restored, with the approval of\r\nCongress. Meanwhile military authority cannot be withdrawn.”[492]\r\n\r\nIf it be contended that Mr. Seward made this important declaration upon\r\nhis personal responsibility the argument fails, because in a dispatch to\r\nGovernor Marvin, of Florida, dated September 12, 1865, nearly two months\r\nlater, the Secretary of State repeated the substance of the message in\r\nlanguage even more explicit. On that occasion he said: “It must,\r\nhowever, be distinctly understood that the restoration to which your\r\nproclamation refers will be subject to the decision of Congress.”[493]\r\n\r\nThe determination of President Johnson to retain the members of Mr.\r\nLincoln’s Cabinet would indicate his original intention of applying to\r\nthe subjugated States the system adopted by his predecessor. The\r\ninfluence which led to the modification of the method of enforcing\r\nwithout abandoning the principles underlying that plan it is not easy to\r\ndiscover. His change of attitude toward the South has been variously\r\nexplained. By Mr. Blaine it has been ascribed to the flattery of\r\nSouthern leaders, as well as to the personal influence of Secretary\r\nSeward, whose wide culture, and consequent humanity, would favor a\r\npolicy of conciliation. Without intending to underestimate the\r\ninsinuating address of the New York statesman it may be observed that\r\nhis powers of persuasion appear to have exerted themselves with most\r\nsuccess in the direction of the President’s inclination. The attention\r\nof Southern leaders, a class of men by whom the President had hitherto\r\nbeen ignored, deserves, however, to be noticed in any enumeration of\r\neven the probable cause of the change. Another theory has it that Mr.\r\nJohnson both feared and hated several of the leading Republicans,\r\nbecause of their connection with a movement to procure his resignation\r\nfrom the Vice-Presidency, a station which, they believed, he had\r\ndisgraced by appearing in an intoxicated state to take the oath of\r\noffice. His desire to punish those who had constituted themselves\r\ncustodians of the national dignity, it is asserted, was a principal\r\nmotive in his surrender to the South. A more reasonable explanation of\r\nthe change which occurred in the President’s attitude toward his own\r\nsection is that offered by Dr. Chadsey, who regards Mr. Johnson as an\r\ninconsistent advocate of State Sovereignty.[494] In this principle he\r\nbelieved as firmly as Jefferson Davis himself, though unlike the\r\nConfederate chieftain he refused, by stopping short of secession, to\r\naccept its logical results. Nearly all his administrative acts are those\r\nwhich might have been expected from a Democrat of the strict\r\nconstruction school, and Andrew Johnson never professed allegiance to\r\nany other political party.\r\n\r\nThe governments of which the reorganization has been described in the\r\npreceding pages continued in operation until suspended by the\r\nReconstruction Act of March 2, 1867. Except Texas all these\r\nestablishments, as previously observed, had sent members to the\r\nThirty-ninth Congress. Their claims to seats, it is well known, were\r\ncompletely ignored, and a select body, consisting of nine members from\r\nthe lower and six from the upper House, was appointed to investigate the\r\ncondition of the late Confederate States, and to report whether any of\r\nthem were entitled to representation in either branch of Congress. With\r\nthe conclusions of the celebrated Joint Committee this essay is not\r\nconcerned further than to observe that on the recommendation of the\r\nmajority the Tennessee delegation was admitted on the 24th of July,\r\n1866. Long before that event, however, the task of restoring the Union\r\nhad been taken altogether out of Executive hands.\r\n\r\nIf we reflect how much swifter in a political organism is the progress\r\nof ruin than that of repair, and consider that four years had been\r\nabandoned to the destruction and disorders of civil war, we cannot but\r\nbe surprised at the attempt of the President, single-handed, to adapt\r\nand execute in less than three months a series of measures designed to\r\nrestore tranquillity and revive prosperity among the impoverished\r\ninhabitants of a wasted country. In this view his failure in the work of\r\nreconstruction can excite little astonishment. One reason for this\r\nprecipitate action was a desire to reunite the sections before the\r\nmeeting of Congress, and it was so far a praiseworthy if not a prudent\r\ncourse to adopt. But had he proceeded ever so leisurely there would\r\nstill have existed undoubted obstacles to success. To say that he was\r\nlacking in the tact of his predecessor, that he was naturally of an\r\nobstinate and even of a combative disposition, and that he possessed\r\ndefects, both of temper and judgment, would be merely to repeat a few\r\ntrite observations.[495] Conditions were rapidly changing, but with Mr.\r\nJohnson, conditions passed for almost nothing, though in reality\r\ncircumstances make legislative acts beneficial or otherwise. Like the\r\nmeasures of the Thirty-eighth Congress for restoring the Union, those of\r\nMr. Johnson may be carefully examined without discovering any\r\nconsiderable traces of originality. Indeed, if we except President\r\nLincoln, this entire period seems to have been somewhat lacking in\r\nconstructive statesmanship, though no branch of the public service was\r\nwithout officials of integrity, judgment and ability.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the preceding pages the inaugurals, the messages, the\r\nletters and other communications of Mr. Lincoln have been freely quoted\r\nto show his opinions on all of the principal and most of the subordinate\r\nphases of reconstruction. To complete the design of this inquiry, there\r\nremains to be considered but a single topic related to the main theme,\r\nnamely, the limitations of the Presidential plan for restoring the\r\nUnion. Many of these defects having been incidentally noticed, a general\r\nrecapitulation does not appear to be required, and the subject, it is\r\nbelieved, may be appropriately concluded by an examination of those\r\nfeatures of the Executive system which the narrative has not hitherto\r\nsufficiently emphasized.\r\n\r\nThis summary disclaims, however, any intention of attempting the\r\nabsurdity of testing the statesmanship of Abraham Lincoln by contrasting\r\na method of reconstruction proposed in 1863 with that deemed adequate by\r\nCongress to meet the changed conditions of 1867. We may, indeed, fairly\r\nand even profitably compare the sentiments of the two political\r\ndepartments in the summer of 1864, when, for the first time during the\r\nwar, they were arrayed in opposition on a fundamental policy of civil\r\nadministration. Because of its variance with received notions of\r\nrepresentative government, the so-called “ten _per cent._ principle”\r\nwill be first considered.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the political people that Mr. Lincoln offered to\r\nrecognize as constituting a State encountered, probably, more opposition\r\nthan any single feature of his plan. While its merits and its defects\r\nwere equally evident, the latter, as might be expected, were given by\r\nits adversaries the place of prominence in all their criticisms.\r\nException was taken as well to the legality as to the expediency of the\r\nprinciple. The former has been fully discussed, and on that subject all\r\nthat need be observed is that President Lincoln believed it\r\nconstitutional to preserve the Union, and every measure conducive to\r\nthat end he regarded as lawful.\r\n\r\nOn the question of expediency, however, several considerations suggest\r\nthemselves. Apart from its repugnance to the American idea of majority\r\nrule, its palpable weakness was that governments founded on the consent\r\nof a minimum proportion of the electors would require the support of\r\nFederal power. Here occurs the question, did the forces thus engaged so\r\ngreatly impair the efficiency of the main armies as sensibly to retard\r\nthe work of destroying the enemy? It cannot be denied that there were\r\noccasions when a few additional regiments could have been employed to\r\nadvantage; but neither the reverses nor the disasters of the Union\r\narmies were caused by lack of numbers so much as by the need early in\r\nthe war of commanders of military genius. On the other hand, the troops\r\nwho sustained the new governments, besides weakening the Confederacy,\r\nwere affording protection to organizations that otherwise could not have\r\nbeen recruited. There is record of not less than sixty-five regiments\r\nfurnished by the States restored during the Presidency of Mr.\r\nLincoln.[496] But even more important than this gratifying result was\r\nthe influence which the reinstatement of four seceding commonwealths\r\nexerted on the attitude of those European powers which had proved early\r\nin the conflict their hostility to the United States. The “Johnson\r\ngovernments,” so-called, were never required to furnish any such\r\nunquestioned evidence of reviving loyalty, and that fact should not be\r\noverlooked in any comparison of the results accomplished by the two\r\nExecutives.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the general existence of a strong opposition to minority\r\nrule, the revolutionary proceedings in western Virginia were sanctioned\r\nby every department of Government. Members from the loyal eastern\r\ncounties were at first admitted to seats in both branches of Congress;\r\ntheir successors, however, were in turn refused this indulgence until\r\nthere was presented the novel spectacle of a single Senator representing\r\nthe diminished glory of the Old Dominion. Louisiana, too, which for a\r\nfew days was heard in the lower House, was subsequently excluded\r\naltogether by the changing views of Congress. The revived bill of Wade\r\nand Davis provided in one of its many forms for recognizing that State\r\nas well as Arkansas, and even when the extremists obtained control of\r\nCongress the loyal government organized in Tennessee was approved by\r\navowed opponents of the Executive plan. Mr. Lincoln, indeed, clearly\r\nperceived the inherent weakness of his system, and no one could have\r\nbeen more anxious than he to secure a wider constituency. These facts\r\nseem to indicate that between him and Congress there was not then so\r\nwide a gulf as, for partisan purposes, is sometimes represented. It is\r\ntrue that there was a difference of principle between the two\r\ndepartments; that there was a powerful party in Congress who believed\r\nthat reconstruction was essentially a work of peace and, therefore,\r\npertained exclusively to the national Legislature. The holders of this\r\nview were, doubtless, confirmed in their opinion by a conviction that\r\nthe Executive was encroaching on a coördinate branch of government.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential system as well as the contemporary theory of Congress\r\nrestricted the suffrage of whites, by whom it was almost universally\r\nengrossed at the foundation of the Republic. On the ground of justice\r\nand to encourage the cultivation of civic virtues among the negroes, Mr.\r\nLincoln would admit those qualified to exercise this important\r\nprivilege. His successor acknowledged in a private communication that\r\nfor party purposes he favored some extension of the elective franchise\r\nto freedmen. Though Congress advanced rapidly toward negro suffrage, the\r\nfirst essay of that body in the work of reconstruction included no\r\nprovision for conferring on the colored race a right to participate in\r\ngovernment. By Wade and Davis it was not then deemed necessary even as a\r\ndefensive power. Only a few bold innovators, considered almost fanatic\r\non the question, were in favor of bestowing the right to vote on the\r\nmultitudes maintained by the Freedmen’s Bureau; it was not then deemed\r\nwithin the commission of the general Government, the teachings of\r\npolitical science were still respected by the majority in Congress, and\r\nthe fruits of victory, it was hoped, could be secured without a resort\r\nto radical measures.\r\n\r\nThe form of an oath to support the proclamations and laws respecting\r\nslavery appeared in the Presidential plan as a condition indispensable\r\nto reinstatement. On this subject the difference between the Executive\r\nand Congress was merely one of degree; for the Wade-Davis bill,\r\ndoubtless in imitation of the Presidential system, imposed terms\r\nprecedent, and the new constitutions were to repudiate the rebel debt,\r\nabolish slavery and prohibit the higher insurgent officials, civil as\r\nwell as military, from holding the office of governor, from serving in\r\nthe State legislatures and even from voting.\r\n\r\nBy its adversaries the plan of Mr. Lincoln was condemned for its failure\r\nto exact any security for the future beyond the oath of allegiance, the\r\ntelegraphic supervision by the President and the power of Congress over\r\nthe admission of members. This defect the legislative theory endeavored\r\nto supply, but even the guardianship proposed by Wade and Davis could\r\ngive no assurance that the rebellious communities would not, after\r\nreinstatement, eliminate by constitutional amendment the conditions\r\nimposed on their readmission.[497]\r\n\r\nHowever crude we may now consider Mr. Lincoln’s system it should not be\r\nforgotten that with him the paramount consideration was the overthrow of\r\nthe Confederacy. With that purpose all his measures harmonized, and it\r\nis scarcely critical to examine them from any other point of view. How\r\nfar necessity, which had originally suggested, would subsequently have\r\nmodified his plan it is now impossible to state. Without detracting a\r\nparticle from his well-won fame it may be admitted that his method,\r\nwhich could not have foreseen the rapid succession of changes following\r\nhis death, was but indifferently adapted to solve the problem with which\r\nCongress was compelled to deal in 1867; but the measure of permanent\r\nsuccess which attended the deliberate legislation of that body by no\r\nmeans justifies the conclusion that some other system would have proved\r\na total failure. With all its immaturity the plan of the President was\r\nnot without its advantages. It aimed to restore with as little\r\ninnovation as possible the Union of the Fathers; with some exceptions\r\nthe natural leaders of Southern society were to participate in the work\r\nof reorganization, and the author of this simple plan approached his\r\ndifficult task in a generous and enlightened spirit.\r\n\r\nOn the life and character of Abraham Lincoln an admiring generation has\r\nexhausted the language of panegyric; the terms of censure have been\r\nreserved almost exclusively for his method of restoring the Union; but\r\nneither the critic’s ken, nor the ambitious phrase of eulogy, nor all\r\nthe thoughts that since his death have dropped from poets’ pens affords\r\nthat clear insight into his nature which is unconsciously revealed in\r\nthe simple and beautiful exhortation that concludes his last inaugural.\r\nThe sentiments which immortalize that celebrated state paper could have\r\nproceeded only from the depths of a noble soul—a soul that would have\r\nimposed silence on the voice of vengeance and would never have consented\r\nto the revenge of section upon section. In this book an endeavor has\r\nbeen made fully to discuss his plan of reconstruction; the spirit in\r\nwhich he approached that difficult task is best stated in his own\r\ngenerous and patriotic words, with which may be fittingly closed this\r\nlong though interesting inquiry: “With malice toward none; with charity\r\nfor all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right,\r\nlet us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s\r\nwounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his\r\nwidow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and\r\nlasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.”[498]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  Why the Solid South? p. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 436:\r\n\r\n  This recollection has been verified by correspondence with Col.

J. B. Henderson, the only\r\n  surviving Senator who participated in the debates summarized in\r\n  chapter X., and, so far as the writer is informed, the only living\r\n  member who served in the United States Senate during that eventful\r\n  period. Coming, as it does, from one who supported many of Mr.\r\n  Lincoln’s most cherished measures, the letter will be welcomed as a\r\n  valuable historical document. It contrasts forcibly the Presidential\r\n  plan with the theory of Senator Sumner, and though written on August\r\n  21, 1901, more than a generation after the occurrence of the principal\r\n  events discussed in this book, it is characterized by the clearness\r\n  and the energy of expression which marked even the unpremeditated\r\n  addresses of the Senator’s Congressional career. On the subject of\r\n  reunion he writes as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Time, in my judgment, has stamped its approval on Mr. Lincoln’s views\r\n  touching the questions of reconstruction during the Civil War. He was\r\n  always calm and judicial. He was philosophical in periods of the most\r\n  intense excitement. He never lost his head, but under all\r\n  circumstances preserved his temper and his judgment. He was not the\r\n  buffoon described by his enemies. On the contrary, he was a wise\r\n  statesman, a learned lawyer, and a conscientious patriot; and, better\r\n  than all, an honest man.\r\n\r\n  “The infirmity in Mr. Sumner’s theories of reconstruction came from\r\n  the great exuberance of his learning. He ransacked history, ancient\r\n  and modern, for precedents growing out of civil wars. But these\r\n  precedents all antedated the American Constitution. They grew out of\r\n  monarchical systems of government, and had no relation to the\r\n  republican forms created by our Constitution. Under our system there\r\n  can be no suicide of a State. Individual citizens by rebellion and\r\n  disloyalty may forfeit their political rights, but the State as an\r\n  entity commits no treason and forfeits no rights to existence. Under\r\n  our Constitution the State cannot die. It is the duty of the Federal\r\n  Government to see that it does not die—that it shall never cease to\r\n  exist. If the State be invaded from without, the duty of the General\r\n  Government is to protect and defend it. If domestic violence threatens\r\n  the subversion of the local government, the nation’s duty is to\r\n  intervene and uphold the hands of those who maintain the laws. The\r\n  trustee of an express trust cannot excuse himself to a minority of the\r\n  beneficiaries because the majority repudiate his agency.\r\n\r\n  “‘The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\n  republican form of government.’ No State government is republican in\r\n  form that does not acknowledge the supremacy of the Federal\r\n  Constitution. This is the essential test of republicanism. No State\r\n  can enter the Union without conforming its Constitution to this\r\n  supreme organic law. And whenever by force or violence, a majority of\r\n  its citizens undertake to withdraw the State from its obedience to\r\n  Federal law and to repudiate the sovereignty of the Federal\r\n  Government, it at once becomes the duty of Congress to act.\r\n\r\n  “This duty of Congress is not to destroy the State or to declare it a\r\n  suicide, and proceed to administer on its effects. On the contrary,\r\n  the duty clearly is to preserve the State, to restore it to its old\r\n  republican forms. Its duty is not to territorialize the State and\r\n  proceed to govern it as a conquered colony. The duty is not one of\r\n  demolition, but one of restoration. It is not to make a Constitution,\r\n  but to guarantee that the old Constitution or one equally republican\r\n  in form, and made by the loyal citizens of the State, shall be upheld\r\n  and sustained.\r\n\r\n  “If a majority of the people of a State conspire to subvert its\r\n  republican forms, that majority may be, and should be, put down by the\r\n  Federal power, while the minority, however few, sustaining republican\r\n  forms may be constitutionally installed as the political power of the\r\n  State.\r\n\r\n  “These, as I understand, were the views of Mr. Lincoln; and they were\r\n  not the views of Mr. Sumner, as enunciated in his resolutions of 1862\r\n  and advocated by him in his subsequent career in the Senate.\r\n\r\n  “A departure from these views gave us the carpet-bag governments of\r\n  the Southern States, and brought upon us divers other evils in our\r\n  ideas and theories of government, whose effects are yet visible.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 498:\r\n\r\n  N. & H., Vol. X., p. 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX A\r\n                        THIRTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SENATE\r\n\r\nFirst session, July 4, 1861, to August 6, 1861.
