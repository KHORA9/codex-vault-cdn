Bush\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addresses are separated by three asterisks: ***\r\n\r\nDates of addresses by George W.

Bush\r\nFebruary 27, 2001\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress: It is a great\r\nprivilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for\r\ngoverning our great country.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress\r\nhad to formally invite me and it could have been a close vote. So, Mr.\r\nVice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie. I want to\r\nthank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the\r\nWhite House to discuss important issues. We are off to a good start. I\r\nwill continue to meet with you and ask for your input. You have been\r\nkind and candid, and I thank you for making a new President feel\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath. On the\r\nsteps of this building, I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws,\r\nand I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in\r\nWashington. I hope America is noticing the difference. We are making\r\nprogress. Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation's capital.\r\nAnd this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because in the end\r\nwe will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will be\r\njudged by what we are able to accomplish.\r\n\r\nAmerica today is a Nation with great challenges, but greater resources.\r\nAn artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different\r\npictures of our country. One would have warning signs: increasing\r\nlayoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent\r\npoverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism. Another picture would be full\r\nof blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is\r\nsecond to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that\r\nis revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength, concerned\r\ncitizens who care for our country and care for each other.\r\n\r\nNeither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge\r\nand invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture\r\nto repaint the other, to direct the advantages of our time to solve the\r\nproblems of our people.\r\n\r\nSome of these resources will come from government, some but not all.\r\nYear after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an\r\nold, tired argument: on one side those who want more government,\r\nregardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government,\r\nregardless of the need.\r\n\r\nWe should leave those arguments to the last century and chart a\r\ndifferent course. Government has a role, and an important role. Yet too\r\nmuch government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity\r\nand the private economy. Our new governing vision says government\r\nshould be active but limited, engaged but not overbearing.\r\n\r\nMy budget is based on that philosophy. It is reasonable and it is\r\nresponsible. It meets our obligations and funds our growing needs. We\r\nincrease spending next year for Social Security and Medicare and other\r\nentitlement programs by $81 billion. We have increased spending for\r\ndiscretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate\r\nof inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national\r\ndebt, and then when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the\r\npeople who earned it in the first place.\r\n\r\nA budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives.\r\nExcellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner\r\nenvironment, a stronger defense, these are all important needs, and we\r\nfund them.\r\n\r\nThe highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our\r\nchildren's education. Education is my top priority. Education is my top\r\npriority, and by supporting this budget, you will make it yours as well.\r\n\r\nReading is the foundation of all learning, so during the next 5 years\r\nwe triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in America\r\nlearn to read. Values are important, so we have tripled funding for\r\ncharacter education to teach our children not only reading and writing,\r\nbut right from wrong.\r\n\r\nWe have increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we\r\nknow a good education starts with a good teacher.\r\n\r\nAnd I have a wonderful partner in this effort. I like teachers so much,\r\nI married one. Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the\r\nprofession that will shape our future: teaching. She will travel across\r\nAmerica to promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in\r\nour schools and in programs such as Head Start.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the\r\ndifference. Funding is important, and so is reform. So we must tie\r\nfunding to higher standards and accountability for results.\r\n\r\nI believe in local control of schools. We should not and we will not\r\nrun public schools from Washington, DC. Yet when the Federal government\r\nspends tax dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be\r\ntested on basic reading and math skills every year, between grades\r\nthree and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our\r\nchildren are learning, and I want to know, because I refuse to leave\r\nany child behind in America.\r\n\r\nCritics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about\r\n\"teaching to the test.\" But let us put that logic to the test. If you\r\ntest a child on basic math and reading skills and you are \"teaching to\r\nthe test,\" you are teaching math and reading, and that is the whole\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nAs standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet\r\nthem, so we must streamline the dozens of Federal education programs\r\ninto five, and let States spend money in those categories as they see\r\nfit. Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve, and the\r\nsupport to do so.\r\n\r\nYet if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and\r\nstudents different options: a better public school, a private school,\r\ntutoring, or a charter school. In the end, every child in a bad\r\nsituation must be given a better choice, because when it comes to our\r\nchildren, failure is simply not an option.\r\n\r\nAnother priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare\r\nand Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health\r\ncare needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over\r\nthe next 10 years.\r\n\r\nMy budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to\r\nfund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit\r\nfor lowincome seniors. No senior in America should have to choose\r\nbetween buying food and buying prescriptions.\r\n\r\nTo make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not\r\ndiverted into any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion\r\nof the Social Security surplus for Social Security and for Social\r\nSecurity alone.\r\n\r\nMy budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling\r\nAmericans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must\r\nchoose. Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we\r\nwill help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. And\r\nto provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next 5\r\nyears we will double the number of people served at community health\r\ncare centers.\r\n\r\nAnd we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage yet\r\nworry their insurance company does not care and won't pay. Together,\r\nthis Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure\r\ndoctors make medical decisions and patients get the health care they\r\ndeserve with a Patients' Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they\r\nneed, not be forced to go to court because they didn't get it. We will\r\nensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims, but\r\nfirst, let us put in place a strong independent review so we promote\r\nquality health care, not frivolous lawsuits.\r\n\r\nMy budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope\r\nto many who struggle with serious disease. Our prayers tonight are with\r\none of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer, a fine\r\nRepresentative and a good man, Congressman JOE MOAKLEY. I can think of\r\nno more appropriate tribute to JOE than to have the Congress finish the\r\njob of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health.\r\n\r\nMy New Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new\r\ntechnologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more\r\nwelcoming. For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we\r\nmust continue to break down barriers to equality.\r\n\r\nThe budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our\r\ncountry strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United\r\nStates military. I am requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay\r\nand benefits, and health care and housing. Our men and women in uniform\r\ngive America their best, and we owe them our support.\r\n\r\nAmerica's veterans honored their commitment to our country through\r\ntheir military service. I will honor our commitment to them with a $1\r\nbillion increase to ensure better access to quality care and faster\r\ndecisions on benefit claims.\r\n\r\nMy budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of\r\ntoxic brownfields. I propose we make a major investment in conservation\r\nby fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\r\n\r\nOur national parks have a special place in our country's life. Our\r\nparks are places of great natural beauty and history. As good stewards,\r\nwe must leave them better than we have found them, so I propose\r\nproviding $4.9 billion over 5 years for the upkeep of these national\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nMy budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the\r\ndisadvantaged. We must encourage and support the work of charities and\r\nfaithbased and community groups that offer help and love, one person at\r\na time. These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to\r\nfight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence, to provide a\r\nhot meal or a mentor, or a safe haven for our children. Government\r\nshould welcome these groups to apply for funds, not discriminate\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers. Government\r\nshould not fund religious activities, but our Nation should support the\r\ngood works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in\r\nneed. So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not,\r\nto deduct their charitable contributions. Estimates show this could\r\nencourage as much as $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money\r\nthat will save and change lives.\r\n\r\nOur budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a\r\nFederal Compassion Capital Fund with a focused and noble mission: to\r\nprovide a mentor for the more than 1 million children with a parent in\r\nprison and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen\r\npregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems.\r\n\r\nWith us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome\r\nMayor John Street. Hi, Mr. Mayor.\r\n\r\nMayor Street has encouraged faithbased and community organizations to\r\nmake a significant difference in Philadelphia. He has invited me to his\r\ncity this summer to see compassion in action. I am personally aware of\r\njust how effective the mayor is.\r\n\r\nMayor Street is a Democrat. Let the record show I lost his city, big\r\ntime. But some things are bigger than politics. So I look forward to\r\ncoming to your city to see your faith-based programs in action.\r\n\r\nAs government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice. Too\r\nmany of our citizens have cause to doubt our Nation's justice when the\r\nlaw points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals. All\r\nour citizens are created equal and must be treated equally. Earlier\r\ntoday, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific\r\nrecommendations to end racial profiling.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong, and we will end it. It is wrong. In so doing, we will not\r\nhinder the work of our Nation's brave police officers. They protect us\r\nevery day, often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we\r\nwill add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve.\r\n\r\nMy budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations.\r\nIt has funded our Nation's important priorities. It has protected\r\nSocial Security and Medicare. And our surpluses are big enough that\r\nthere is still money left over.\r\n\r\nMany of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I\r\nlistened, and I agree.\r\n\r\nWe owe it to our children and our grandchildren to act now, and I hope\r\nyou will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAt the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that\r\nis available to retire. That is more debt repaid more quickly than has\r\never been repaid by any nation at any time in history.\r\n\r\nWe should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the\r\nfuture. We should approach our Nation's budget as any prudent family\r\nwould, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nFor example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense\r\nspending. We may need to increase spending for our farmers or\r\nadditional money to reform Medicare. So my budget sets aside almost a\r\ntrillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs, that is one\r\ntrillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\nWe have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent. We have funded\r\nour priorities. We have paid down all the available debt. We have\r\nprepared for contingencies, and we still have money left over. Yogi\r\nBerra once said \"when you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" Now we\r\ncome to a fork in the road. We have two choices. Even though we have\r\nalready met our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger\r\ngovernment. That is the road our Nation has traveled in recent years.\r\n\r\nLast year, government spending shot up 8 percent. That is far more than\r\nour economy grew, far more than personal income grew and far more than\r\nthe rate of inflation. If you continue on that road, you will spend the\r\nsurplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills.\r\n\r\nUnrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we\r\nmust take a different path. The other choice is to let the American\r\npeople spend their own money to meet their own needs. I hope you will\r\njoin me in standing firmly on the side of the people.\r\n\r\nYou see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and\r\ngovernment is charging more than it needs. The people of America have\r\nbeen overcharged, and on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund.\r\n\r\nSome say my tax plan is too big. Others say it is too small. I\r\nrespectfully disagree. This plan is just right.\r\n\r\nI did not throw darts at a board to come up with a number for tax\r\nrelief. I did not take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that\r\nmight sound good. I looked at problems in the Tax Code and calculated\r\nthe costs to fix them.\r\n\r\nA tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so\r\nwe must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a\r\nthird of the money they earn in Federal income taxes, so we lowered the\r\ntop rate to 33 percent.\r\n\r\nThis reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses,\r\nwhich often pay taxes at the highest rate, and help for small business\r\nmeans jobs for Americans.\r\n\r\nWe simplified the Tax Code by reducing the number of tax rates from the\r\ncurrent five rates to four lower ones, 10 percent, 15 percent, 25\r\npercent and 33 percent. In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted\r\nout. Everyone who pays income taxes will get relief.\r\n\r\nOur government should not tax and thereby discourage marriage, so we\r\nreduced the marriage penalty. I want to help families rear and support\r\ntheir children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair to tax the same earnings twice, once when you earn them\r\nand again when you die, so we must repeal the death tax.\r\n\r\nThese changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two\r\nchildren will save $1,600 a year on their Federal income taxes. Now,\r\n1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nSixteen hundred dollars buys gas for two cars for an entire year. It\r\npays tuition for a year at a community college. It pays the average\r\nfamily grocery bill for 3 months. That is real money.\r\n\r\nWith us tonight, representing many American families, are Steven and\r\nJosefina Ramos. They are from Pennsylvania, but they could be from any\r\none of your districts. Steven is a network administrator for a school\r\ndistrict. Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school, and they\r\nhave a 2-yearold daughter. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost\r\n$8,000 a year in Federal income taxes. My plan will save them more than\r\n$2,000.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you what Steven says, \"$2,000 a year means a lot to my\r\nfamily. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying\r\noff our personal debt in 2 years time.\" After that, Steven and Josefina\r\nwant to start saving for Lianna's college education.\r\n\r\nMy attitude is government should never stand in the way of families\r\nachieving their dreams. And as we debate this issue, always remember,\r\nthe surplus is not the government's money, the surplus is the people's\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nFor lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right\r\nnow, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two\r\nchildren on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional\r\ndollar she earns above the 25,000. For overtime, her hardest hours, are\r\ntaxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends a terrible message: You will\r\nnever get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor\r\nhard work, never punish it.\r\n\r\nWith tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the\r\nwaitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest\r\npercentage reductions. And millions of additional American families\r\nwill be removed from the income tax rolls entirely.\r\n\r\nTax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic\r\nexpansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest\r\nrates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job\r\nall by themselves.\r\n\r\nForty years ago and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat and\r\none Republican, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts\r\nto, in President Kennedy's words, \"get this country moving again.\" They\r\nknew then, what we must do now, to create economic growth and\r\nopportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who\r\nbuy goods and create jobs.\r\n\r\nWe must act quickly. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified\r\nbefore Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic\r\nrecovery. So I want to work with you to give our economy an important\r\njump start by making tax relief retroactive.\r\n\r\nWe must act now because it is the right thing to do. We must also act\r\nnow because we have other things to do. We must show courage to\r\nconfront and resolve tough challenges: To restructure our Nation's\r\ndefenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare\r\nand Social Security.\r\n\r\nAmerica has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present\r\npeace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work\r\nwith our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of\r\nfreedom. We will work for free markets and free trade and freedom from\r\noppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is\r\ntheir friend.\r\n\r\nWe will promote our values, and we will promote peace. And we need a\r\nstrong military to keep the peace. But our military was shaped to\r\nconfront the challenges of the past. So I have asked the Secretary of\r\nDefense to review America's armed forces and prepare to transform them\r\nto meet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the\r\nresearch and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader\r\ntransformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our\r\ndefense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around.\r\n\r\nOur Nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the\r\n21st century, threats that are more widespread and less certain. They\r\nrange from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants and rogue\r\nnations intent on developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect\r\nour own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must\r\ndeploy effective missile defenses.\r\n\r\nAnd as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and\r\nreduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs.\r\n\r\nA strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom. Yet\r\nthe cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves\r\nand our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and\r\nproducts that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade\r\nbrings greater political and personal freedom.\r\n\r\nEach of the previous five presidents has had the ability to negotiate\r\nfarreaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask to give me the strong hand\r\nof presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.\r\n\r\nAs we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high costs of\r\nenergy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy\r\npolicy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has\r\nresulted in high prices and uncertainty. I have asked Federal agencies\r\nto work with California officials to help speed construction of new\r\nenergy sources. And I have directed Vice President Cheney, Commerce\r\nSecretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham, and other senior members of\r\nmy administration to develop a national energy policy.\r\n\r\nOur energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at\r\nhome while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more\r\nelectricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative\r\nenergy sources and conservation, and we must. America must become more\r\nenergy independent, and we will.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming\r\nMedicare and Social Security.\r\n\r\nMedicare's finances are strained, and its coverage is outdated.\r\nNinety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form\r\nof prescription drug coverage. Medicare does not. The framework for\r\nreform has been developed by Senators FRIST and BREAUX and Congressman\r\nTHOMAS; and now is the time to act. Medicare must be modernized. And we\r\nmust make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care\r\nplan that offers prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nSeven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim\r\nSocial Security benefits. Everyone in this Chamber knows that Social\r\nSecurity is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only\r\nhave a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country\r\nwill one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll\r\ntaxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits. There is a better way.\r\n\r\nThis spring I will form a Presidential commission to reform Social\r\nSecurity. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall.\r\nReform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the\r\nbenefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must\r\nreturn Social Security to sound financial footing, and it must offer\r\npersonal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.\r\n\r\nSocial Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on\r\nthe money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must\r\nincrease that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound\r\ninvestments at a higher rate of return.\r\n\r\nOwnership, access to wealth, and independence should not be the\r\nprivilege of a few. They are the hope of every American, and we must\r\nmake them the foundation of Social Security.\r\n\r\nBy confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with\r\nour budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can\r\nadd to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nThe agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great Nation.\r\n\r\nAmerica is a Nation at peace, but not a Nation at rest. Much has been\r\ngiven to us, and much is expected.\r\n\r\nLet us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our\r\ngoodwill must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisanship is more than\r\nminding our manners, it is doing our duty.\r\n\r\nNo one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. At so\r\nmany turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the\r\ncollected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk\r\nthrough Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we are\r\nreminded of their courage and achievement.\r\n\r\nYet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history.\r\nAmerica's purpose always stands before us.\r\n\r\nOur generation must show courage in a time of blessing as our Nation\r\nhas always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue,\r\ncan gather to greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege\r\nand responsibility we share. And if we work together, we can prove that\r\npublic service is noble.\r\n\r\nWe all came here for a reason. We all have things we want to accomplish\r\nand promises to keep. Juntos podemos, together we can. We can make\r\nAmericans proud of their government. Together we can share in the\r\ncredit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and\r\nearn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens, the highest\r\npossible praise: well done, good and faithful servants.\r\n\r\nThank you all. Good night. And God bless.\r\n\r\n(Applause, the Members rising.)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nJanuary 29, 2002\r\n\r\nThank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of\r\nCongress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight,\r\nour nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the civilized\r\nworld faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union has never\r\nbeen stronger. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In four short months,\r\nour nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the\r\nPentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the\r\nworld of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist\r\ntraining camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country\r\nfrom brutal oppression. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who\r\nonce occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay.\r\n(Applause.) And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice\r\ntheir lives are running for their own. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We'll be\r\npartners in rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcome the\r\ndistinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid\r\nKarzai. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of\r\nAfghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or\r\ngoing to school. Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's\r\nnew government. And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs,\r\nDoctor Sima Samar. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the\r\nresolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States\r\nmilitary. (Applause.) When I called our troops into action, I did so\r\nwith complete confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight,\r\nthanks to them, we are winning the war on terror. (Applause.) The men\r\nand women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to\r\nevery enemy of the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans\r\nand continents, on mountaintops and in caves--you will not escape the\r\njustice of this nation. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nFor many Americans, these four months have brought sorrow, and pain\r\nthat will never completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter\r\nreturns to Ground Zero, to feel closer to his two sons who died there.\r\nAt a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note\r\nfor his lost father: Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven. I don't\r\nwant to play football until I can play with you again some day.\r\n\r\nLast month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, a CIA officer and\r\nMarine who died in Mazur-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of\r\nfarewell: \"Semper Fi, my love.\" Shannon is with us tonight. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nShannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause\r\nis just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and\r\nall who gave their lives for freedom.\r\n\r\nOur cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan\r\nconfirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true scope of the task\r\nahead. We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos, where\r\nthey laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of their\r\nhatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. We\r\nhave found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water\r\nfacilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons,\r\nsurveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of\r\nlandmarks in America and throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWhat we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there,\r\nour war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who\r\nhijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's\r\ncamps, and so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous\r\nkillers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw\r\nregimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs,\r\nset to go off without warning.\r\n\r\nThanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition\r\npartners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet, tens of\r\nthousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies view\r\nthe entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever\r\nthey are. (Applause.) So long as training camps operate, so long as\r\nnations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk. And America and our\r\nallies must not, and will not, allow it. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in\r\nthe pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist\r\ncamps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And,\r\nsecond, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical,\r\nbiological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and\r\nthe world. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of\r\nbusiness, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A\r\nterrorist underworld--including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic\r\nJihad, Jaish-i-Mohammed--operates in remote jungles and deserts, and\r\nhides in the centers of large cities.\r\n\r\nWhile the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is\r\nacting elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to\r\ntrain that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have\r\nexecuted an American, and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working\r\nwith the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to\r\nbomb our embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block\r\nthe shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in\r\nSomalia.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that all nations will heed our call, and eliminate the\r\nterrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own. Many\r\nnations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror,\r\nand I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nBut some governments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no\r\nmistake about it: If they do not act, America will. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from\r\nthreatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since\r\nSeptember the 11th. But we know their true nature. North Korea is a\r\nregime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while\r\nstarving its citizens.\r\n\r\nIran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an\r\nunelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.\r\n\r\nIraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support\r\nterror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas,\r\nand nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has\r\nalready used poison gas to murder thousands of its own\r\ncitizens--leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead\r\nchildren. This is a regime that agreed to international\r\ninspections--then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has\r\nsomething to hide from the civilized world.\r\n\r\nStates like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of\r\nevil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of\r\nmass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They\r\ncould provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match\r\ntheir hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the\r\nUnited States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would\r\nbe catastrophic.\r\n\r\nWe will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their\r\nstate sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and\r\ndeliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy\r\neffective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from\r\nsudden attack. (Applause.) And all nations should know: America will do\r\nwhat is necessary to ensure our nation's security.\r\n\r\nWe'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on\r\nevents, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws\r\ncloser and closer. The United States of America will not permit the\r\nworld's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most\r\ndestructive weapons. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign\r\nmay not be finished on our watch--yet it must be and it will be waged\r\non our watch.\r\n\r\nWe can't stop short. If we stop now--leaving terror camps intact and\r\nterror states unchecked--our sense of security would be false and\r\ntemporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it\r\nis both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur first priority must always be the security of our nation, and that\r\nwill be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports\r\nthree great goals for America: We will win this war; we'll protect our\r\nhomeland; and we will revive our economy.\r\n\r\nSeptember the 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in\r\nthis Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity\r\nand resolve. (Applause.) Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit\r\ndirected toward addressing problems here at home. I'm a proud member of\r\nmy party--yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create\r\njobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans,\r\nnot as Democrats, but as Americans. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIt costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion\r\ndollars a month--over $30 million a day--and we must be prepared for\r\nfuture operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons\r\ndefeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them. We\r\nneed to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile, to put\r\nour troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely. Our men and women\r\nin uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best\r\ntraining--and they also deserve another pay raise. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMy budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two\r\ndecades --because while the price of freedom and security is high, it\r\nis never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will\r\npay. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect\r\nour citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of\r\nanother attack. Time and distance from the events of September the 11th\r\nwill not make us safer unless we act on its lessons. America is no\r\nlonger protected by vast oceans. We are protected from attack only by\r\nvigorous action abroad, and increased vigilance at home.\r\n\r\nMy budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland\r\nsecurity, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response,\r\nairport and border security, and improved intelligence. We will develop\r\nvaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases. We'll increase\r\nfunding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic\r\npolice and firefighters. (Applause.) We will improve intelligence\r\ncollection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the\r\nsecurity of air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and\r\ndepartures of visitors to the United States. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nHomeland security will make America not only stronger, but, in many\r\nways, better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve\r\npublic health. Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer\r\nneighborhoods. Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal\r\ndrugs. (Applause.) And as government works to better secure our\r\nhomeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nA few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a\r\npassenger lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the\r\nman, who had been trained by al Qaeda and was armed with explosives.\r\nThe people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved\r\nnearly 200 lives. And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants\r\nHermis Moutardier and Christina Jones. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOnce we have funded our national security and our homeland security,\r\nthe final great priority of my budget is economic security for the\r\nAmerican people. (Applause.) To achieve these great national\r\nobjectives--to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our\r\neconomy--our budget will run a deficit that will be small and\r\nshort-term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a\r\nfiscally responsible manner. (Applause.) We have clear priorities and\r\nwe must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown\r\noverseas: We'll prevail in the war, and we will defeat this recession.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmericans who have lost their jobs need our help and I support\r\nextending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care\r\ncoverage. (Applause.) Yet, American workers want more than unemployment\r\nchecks-- they want a steady paycheck. (Applause.) When America works,\r\nAmerica prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one\r\nword: jobs. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nGood jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start.\r\n(Applause.) Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve\r\nhistoric education reform so that no child is left behind. I was proud\r\nto work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and\r\nCongressman George Miller. (Applause.) Senator Judd Gregg. (Applause.)\r\nAnd I was so proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my\r\nfriend, Ted Kennedy. (Laughter and applause.) I know the folks at the\r\nCrawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say such a\r\nthing--(laughter)--but our work on this bill shows what is possible if\r\nwe set aside posturing and focus on results. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThere is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and\r\nsucceed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood\r\ndevelopment programs. (Applause.) We must upgrade our teacher colleges\r\nand teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great\r\ngoal for America: a quality teacher in every classroom. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nGood jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress\r\nmust act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build\r\ninfrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home\r\nso America is less dependent on foreign oil. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nGood jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates\r\nnew jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion\r\nauthority. (Applause.) On these two key issues, trade and energy, the\r\nHouse of Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the\r\nSenate to pass this legislation. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nGood jobs depend on sound tax policy. (Applause.) Last year, some in\r\nthis hall thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was\r\ntoo big. (Applause.) But when the checks arrived in the mail, most\r\nAmericans thought tax relief was just about right. (Applause.) Congress\r\nlistened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling\r\nthe child credit, and ending the death tax. For the sake of long-term\r\ngrowth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax\r\ncuts permanent. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the\r\neconomy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment, and by\r\nspeeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend. For the sake\r\nof American workers, let's pass a stimulus package. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nGood jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these\r\nimportant reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce\r\ndependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmericans know economic security can vanish in an instant without\r\nhealth security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a\r\npatients' bill of rights--(applause)--to give uninsured workers credits\r\nto help buy health coverage--(applause)--to approve an historic\r\nincrease in the spending for veterans' health--(applause)--and to give\r\nseniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for\r\nprescription drugs. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nA good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to\r\nenact new safeguards for 401K and pension plans. (Applause.) Employees\r\nwho have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk\r\nlosing everything if their company fails. (Applause.) Through stricter\r\naccounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate\r\nAmerica must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and\r\nheld to the highest standards of conduct. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nRetirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social\r\nSecurity, and we will. We must make Social Security financially stable\r\nand allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose\r\nthem. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMembers, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other\r\nissues: productive farm policy--(applause)--a cleaner\r\nenvironment--(applause) --broader home ownership, especially among\r\nminorities--(applause)--and ways to encourage the good work of\r\ncharities and faith-based groups. (Applause.) I ask you to join me on\r\nthese important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've\r\napplied to our war against terrorism. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nDuring these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see\r\nthe true character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies\r\nbelieved America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in\r\nfear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe American people have responded magnificently, with courage and\r\ncompassion, strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the\r\nfamilies, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in\r\nawe of the American people.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope you will join me--I hope you will join me in expressing\r\nthanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings\r\nto our nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nNone of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the\r\n11th. Yet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country\r\nlooked into a mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that\r\nwe are citizens, with obligations to each other, to our country, and to\r\nhistory. We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate, and\r\nmore about the good we can do.\r\n\r\nFor too long our culture has said, \"If it feels good, do it.\" Now\r\nAmerica is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: \"Let's roll.\"\r\n(Applause.) In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of\r\nfirefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we\r\nhave glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We\r\nwant to be a nation that serves goals larger than self. We've been\r\noffered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nMy call tonight is for every American to commit at least two\r\nyears--4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime--to the service of\r\nyour neighbors and your nation. (Applause.) Many are already serving,\r\nand I thank you. If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place\r\nto start. To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I\r\ninvite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom Corps will\r\nfocus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home;\r\nrebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nOne purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America\r\nneeds retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major\r\nemergencies; volunteers to help police and fire departments;\r\ntransportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.\r\n\r\nOur country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We\r\nneed mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in\r\nprison. And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA\r\nFreedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps\r\nand Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.\r\n\r\nAnd America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to\r\nevery part of the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace\r\nCorps, double its volunteers over the next five years--(applause)--and\r\nask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and\r\nopportunity in the Islamic world. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity--a moment\r\nwe must seize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of\r\nmillions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can\r\novercome evil with greater good. (Applause.) And we have a great\r\nopportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values\r\nthat will bring lasting peace.\r\n\r\nAll fathers and mothers, in all societies, want their children to be\r\neducated, and live free from poverty and violence. No people on Earth\r\nyearn to be oppressed, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the\r\nmidnight knock of the secret police.\r\n\r\nIf anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic\r\n\"street\" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration. Let the\r\nskeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of\r\nlearning, and tolerance and progress. America will lead by defending\r\nliberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for\r\nall people everywhere. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nNo nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We\r\nhave no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always\r\nstand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of\r\nlaw; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private\r\nproperty; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these\r\nvalues around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a\r\ngreater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment.\r\nWe seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.\r\n\r\nIn this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old\r\nrivalries. America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways\r\nwe have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity. In every region,\r\nfree markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power\r\nto lift lives. Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia,\r\nand Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of\r\nterror cannot stop the momentum of freedom. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return\r\nto normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will. Those of us\r\nwho have lived through these challenging times have been changed by\r\nthem. We've come to know truths that we will never question: evil is\r\nreal, and it must be opposed. (Applause.) Beyond all differences of\r\nrace or creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger\r\ntogether. Deep in the American character, there is honor, and it is\r\nstronger than cynicism. And many have discovered again that even in\r\ntragedy--especially in tragedy--God is near. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in\r\nthe history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in\r\nhuman events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or\r\nconsequential.\r\n\r\nOur enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and\r\nmurder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand\r\nfor a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our founding. We\r\naffirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nSteadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's\r\nprice. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my\r\nfellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory.\r\n\r\nThank you all. May God bless. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nJanuary 29, 2003\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished\r\ncitizens and fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet\r\nhere to consider the state of the union. This year, we gather in this\r\nchamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead.\r\n\r\nYou and I serve our country in a time of great consequence. During this\r\nsession of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital\r\nto our country; we have the opportunity to save millions of lives\r\nabroad from a terrible disease. We will work for a prosperity that is\r\nbroadly shared, and we will answer every danger and every enemy that\r\nthreatens the American people.\r\n\r\nIn all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be\r\nconfident. In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is\r\nsure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong.\r\n\r\nThis country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore,\r\nwe will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other\r\npresidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus and\r\nclarity and courage.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when\r\nwe work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we\r\nachieved historic education reform -- which must now be carried out in\r\nevery school and in every classroom, so that every child in America can\r\nread and learn and succeed in life. To protect our country, we\r\nreorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland\r\nSecurity, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To\r\nbring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief\r\nin a generation. To insist on integrity in American business we passed\r\ntough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.\r\n\r\nSome might call this a good record; I call it a good start. Tonight I\r\nask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our\r\nfellow citizens.\r\n\r\nOur first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough\r\nto employ every man and woman who seeks a job. After recession,\r\nterrorist attacks, corporate scandals and stock market declines, our\r\neconomy is recovering -- yet it's not growing fast enough, or strongly\r\nenough. With unemployment rising, our nation needs more small\r\nbusinesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers\r\nto put up the sign that says, \"Help Wanted.\"\r\n\r\nJobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when\r\nAmericans have more money to spend and invest; and the best and fairest\r\nway to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006\r\nbe made permanent and effective this year. And under my plan, as soon\r\nas I sign the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers'\r\npaychecks. Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we\r\nshould do it now. Instead of slowly raising the child credit to $1,000,\r\nwe should send the checks to American families now.\r\n\r\nThe tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes -- and it will\r\nhelp our economy immediately: 92 million Americans will keep, this\r\nyear, an average of almost $1,000 more of their own money. A family of\r\nfour with an income of $40,000 would see their federal income taxes\r\nfall from $1,178 to $45 per year. Our plan will improve the bottom line\r\nfor more than 23 million small businesses.\r\n\r\nYou, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and\r\npromised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for\r\nAmericans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better\r\nfor Americans today.\r\n\r\nWe should also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in\r\nour tax laws. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is not fair to\r\nagain tax the shareholder on the same profits. To boost investor\r\nconfidence, and to help the nearly 10 million senior who receive\r\ndividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\nLower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand. More\r\njobs mean more taxpayers, and higher revenues to our government. The\r\nbest way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to\r\nencourage economic growth, and to show some spending discipline in\r\nWashington, D.C.\r\n\r\nWe must work together to fund only our most important priorities. I\r\nwill send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by 4\r\npercent next year -- about as much as the average family's income is\r\nexpected to grow. And that is a good benchmark for us. Federal spending\r\nshould not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families.\r\n\r\nA growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will also be\r\ncrucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work\r\ntogether to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer\r\nyounger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they\r\nwill control and they will own.\r\n\r\nOur second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all\r\nAmericans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and\r\ninnovation, with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our\r\nlives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much -- and many\r\nhave no coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a\r\nnationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care.\r\n\r\nInstead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a\r\ngood insurance policy, choose their own doctors, and seniors and\r\nlow-income Americans receive the help they need. Instead of bureaucrats\r\nand trial lawyers and HMOs, we must put doctors and nurses and patients\r\nback in charge of American medicine.\r\n\r\nHealth care reform must begin with Medicare; Medicare is the binding\r\ncommitment of a caring society. We must renew that commitment by giving\r\nseniors access to preventive medicine and new drugs that are\r\ntransforming health care in America.\r\n\r\nSeniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep\r\ntheir coverage just the way it is. And just like you -- the members of\r\nCongress, and your staffs, and other federal employees -- all seniors\r\nshould have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription\r\ndrugs.\r\n\r\nMy budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade\r\nto reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties\r\nhave talked for years about strengthening Medicare. I urge the members\r\nof this new Congress to act this year.\r\n\r\nTo improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime\r\ncauses of higher cost, the constant threat that physicians and\r\nhospitals will be unfairly sued. Because of excessive litigation,\r\neverybody pays more for health care, and many parts of America are\r\nlosing fine doctors. No one has ever been healed by a frivolous\r\nlawsuit. I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.\r\n\r\nOur third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while\r\ndramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive\r\nenergy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop\r\ncleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you\r\nClear Skies legislation that mandates a 70-percent cut in air pollution\r\nfrom power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy\r\nForests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that\r\ndevastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres\r\nof treasured forest.\r\n\r\nI urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment\r\nand our economy. Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step and\r\nprotect our environment in ways that generations before us could not\r\nhave imagined.\r\n\r\nIn this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about\r\nnot through endless lawsuits or command-and-control regulations, but\r\nthrough technology and innovation. Tonight I'm proposing $1.2 billion\r\nin research funding so that America can lead the world in developing\r\nclean, hydrogen-powered automobiles.\r\n\r\nA single chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates\r\nenergy, which can be used to power a car -- producing only water, not\r\nexhaust fumes. With a new national commitment, our scientists and\r\nengineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory\r\nto showroom, so that the first car driven by a child born today could\r\nbe powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.\r\n\r\nJoin me in this important innovation to make our air significantly\r\ncleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nOur fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest\r\nproblems of America. For so many in our country -- the homeless and the\r\nfatherless, the addicted -- the need is great. Yet there's power,\r\nwonder-working power, in the goodness and idealism and faith of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nAmericans are doing the work of compassion every day -- visiting\r\nprisoners, providing shelter for battered women, bringing companionship\r\nto lonely seniors. These good works deserve our praise; they deserve\r\nour personal support; and when appropriate, they deserve the assistance\r\nof the federal government.\r\n\r\nI urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen\r\nService Act, to encourage acts of compassion that can transform\r\nAmerica, one heart and one soul at a time.\r\n\r\nLast year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in the USA\r\nFreedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers\r\nacross America. Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus\r\nthe spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of\r\nsome of our most vulnerable citizens -- boys and girls trying to grow\r\nup without guidance and attention, and children who have to go through\r\na prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.\r\n\r\nI propose a $450-million initiative to bring mentors to more than a\r\nmillion disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners.\r\nGovernment will support the training and recruiting of mentors; yet it\r\nis the men and women of America who will fill the need. One mentor, one\r\nperson can change a life forever. And I urge you to be that one person.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs. Addiction crowds\r\nout friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the\r\nrichness of life to a single destructive desire. As a government, we\r\nare fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies and reducing demand\r\nthrough anti-drug education programs. Yet for those already addicted,\r\nthe fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives. Too many\r\nAmericans in search of treatment cannot get it. So tonight I propose a\r\nnew $600-million program to help an additional 300,000 Americans\r\nreceive treatment over the next three years.\r\n\r\nOur nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work. One\r\nof them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\r\nA man in the program said, \"God does miracles in people's lives, and\r\nyou never think it could be you.\" Tonight, let us bring to all\r\nAmericans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The\r\nmiracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you.\r\n\r\nBy caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women\r\nwho need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society -- a\r\nculture that values every life. And in this work we must not overlook\r\nthe weakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of\r\ntheir birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion. And because\r\nno human life should be started or ended as the object of an\r\nexperiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity, and pass a\r\nlaw against all human cloning.\r\n\r\nThe qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America\r\nalso determine our conduct abroad. The American flag stands for more\r\nthan our power and our interests. Our founders dedicated this country\r\nto the cause of human dignity, the rights of every person, and the\r\npossibilities of every life. This conviction leads us into the world to\r\nhelp the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of\r\nevil men.\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan, we helped liberate an oppressed people. And we will\r\ncontinue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and\r\neducate all their children -- boys and girls. In the Middle East, we\r\nwill continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic\r\nPalestine. Across the Earth, America is feeding the hungry -- more than\r\n60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of\r\nthe United States. As our nation moves troops and builds alliances to\r\nmake our world safer, we must also remember our calling as a blessed\r\ncountry is to make this world better.\r\n\r\nToday, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the\r\nAIDS virus -- including 3 million children under the age 15. There are\r\nwhole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult\r\npopulation carries the infection. More than 4 million require immediate\r\ndrug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims --\r\nonly 50,000 -- are receiving the medicine they need.\r\n\r\nBecause the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not\r\nseek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural\r\nSouth Africa describes his frustration. He says, \"We have no medicines.\r\nMany hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home\r\nand die.\" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to\r\nhear those words.\r\n\r\nAIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many\r\nyears. And the cost of those drugs has dropped from $12,000 a year to\r\nunder $300 a year -- which places a tremendous possibility within our\r\ngrasp. Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater\r\nopportunity to do so much for so many.\r\n\r\nWe have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own\r\ncountry. And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I\r\npropose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief -- a work of mercy beyond\r\nall current international efforts to help the people of Africa. This\r\ncomprehensive plan will prevent 7 million new AIDS infections, treat at\r\nleast 2 million people with life-extending drugs, and provide humane\r\ncare for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children\r\norphaned by AIDS.\r\n\r\nI ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years,\r\nincluding nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against\r\nAIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.\r\n\r\nThis nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague\r\nof nature. And this nation is leading the world in confronting and\r\ndefeating the man-made evil of international terrorism.\r\n\r\nThere are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war\r\non terror. There's never a day when I do not learn of another threat,\r\nor receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this\r\nglobal war against a scattered network of killers. The war goes on, and\r\nwe are winning.\r\n\r\nTo date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of\r\nal Qaeda. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the\r\nSeptember the 11th attacks; the chief of al Qaeda operations in the\r\nPersian Gulf, who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa\r\nand the USS Cole; an al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast Asia; a\r\nformer director of al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan; a key al\r\nQaeda operative in Europe; a major al Qaeda leader in Yemen. All told,\r\nmore than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many\r\ncountries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way\r\n-- they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends\r\nand allies.\r\n\r\nWe are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks.\r\nAmerica and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist\r\nconspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen, the American\r\nembassy in Singapore, a Saudi military base, ships in the Straits of\r\nHormuz and the Straits the Gibraltar. We've broken al Qaeda cells in\r\nHamburg, Milan, Madrid, London, Paris, as well as, Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\nWe have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One\r\nby one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.\r\n\r\nAs we fight this war, we will remember where it began -- here, in our\r\nown country. This government is taking unprecedented measures to\r\nprotect our people and defend our homeland. We've intensified security\r\nat the borders and ports of entry, posted more than 50,000\r\nnewly-trained federal screeners in airports, begun inoculating troops\r\nand first responders against smallpox, and are deploying the nation's\r\nfirst early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack. And\r\nthis year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to\r\nprotect this nation against ballistic missiles.\r\n\r\nI thank the Congress for supporting these measures. I ask you tonight\r\nto add to our future security with a major research and production\r\neffort to guard our people against bioterrorism, called Project\r\nBioshield. The budget I send you will propose almost $6 billion to\r\nquickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents\r\nlike anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague. We must assume that\r\nour enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before\r\nthe dangers are upon us.\r\n\r\nSince September the 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies\r\nhave worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists.\r\nThe FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and is\r\ntransforming itself to meet new threats. Tonight, I am instructing the\r\nleaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security, and the Department\r\nof Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge\r\nand analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government\r\nmust have the very best information possible, and we will use it to\r\nmake sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nOur war against terror is a contest of will in which perseverance is\r\npower. In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon,\r\non a field in Pennsylvania, this nation made a pledge, and we renew\r\nthat pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and\r\nwhatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence\r\nin the affairs of men -- free people will set the course of history.\r\n\r\nToday, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger\r\nfacing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess\r\nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such\r\nweapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or\r\nsell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the\r\nleast hesitation.\r\n\r\nThis threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th\r\ncentury, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built\r\narmies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate\r\nthe world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no\r\nlimit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and\r\ncommunism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of\r\ngreat alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nNow, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared\r\nagain, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again,\r\nthis nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at\r\npeace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are\r\ncalled to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all\r\nmankind. And we accept this responsibility.\r\n\r\nAmerica is making a broad and determined effort to confront these\r\ndangers. We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter\r\nand stand by its demand that Iraq disarm. We're strongly supporting the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control\r\nnuclear materials around the world. We're working with other\r\ngovernments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and\r\nto strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of\r\nmissile technologies and weapons of mass destruction.\r\n\r\nIn all these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow\r\na process -- it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to\r\nthe civilized world. All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden\r\nand catastrophic attacks. And we're asking them to join us, and many\r\nare doing so. Yet the course of this nation does not depend on the\r\ndecisions of others. Whatever action is required, whenever action is\r\nnecessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDifferent threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to\r\nsee a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking\r\nintimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights\r\nand democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their\r\nown government and determine their own destiny -- and the United States\r\nsupports their aspirations to live in freedom.\r\n\r\nOn the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in\r\nfear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on\r\na negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear\r\nweapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world, and\r\ndeveloping those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime\r\nis using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions.\r\nAmerica and the world will not be blackmailed.\r\n\r\nAmerica is working with the countries of the region -- South Korea,\r\nJapan, China, and Russia -- to find a peaceful solution, and to show\r\nthe North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only\r\nisolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship. The North\r\nKorean regime will find respect in the world and revival for its people\r\nonly when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions.\r\n\r\nOur nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula\r\nand not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal\r\ndictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to\r\nterrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to\r\ndominate a vital region and threaten the United States.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last\r\ncasualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed\r\nto disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he\r\nsystematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical,\r\nbiological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his\r\ncountry. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these\r\nweapons -- not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized\r\nworld, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities.\r\n\r\nAlmost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave\r\nSaddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter\r\ncontempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The\r\n108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct -- were not sent to conduct a\r\nscavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of\r\nCalifornia. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime\r\nis disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its\r\nbanned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy\r\nthem as directed. Nothing like this has happened.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological\r\nweapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -- enough\r\ndoses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that\r\nmaterial. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials\r\nsufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin --\r\nenough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure.\r\nHe hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he\r\nhas destroyed it.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the\r\nmaterials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve\r\nagent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold\r\nthousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no\r\nevidence that he has destroyed them.\r\n\r\nU.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000\r\nmunitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently\r\nturned up 16 of them -- despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their\r\nexistence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of\r\nthese prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has\r\ndestroyed them.\r\n\r\nFrom three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had\r\nseveral mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce\r\ngerm warfare agents, and can be moved from place to a place to evade\r\ninspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's\r\ngiven no evidence that he has destroyed them.\r\n\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that\r\nSaddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had\r\na design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods\r\nof enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned\r\nthat Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium\r\nfrom Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to\r\npurchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons\r\nproduction. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities.\r\nHe clearly has much to hide.\r\n\r\nThe dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is\r\ndeceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that\r\nthousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and\r\nmaterials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites and\r\nmonitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the\r\ninspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.\r\n\r\nIraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United\r\nNations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists\r\ninspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached\r\nby Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that\r\nSaddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N.\r\ninspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families.\r\n\r\nYear after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent\r\nenormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible\r\nuse he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nWith nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons,\r\nSaddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle\r\nEast and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the\r\nAmerica people must recognize another threat. Evidence from\r\nintelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people\r\nnow in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists,\r\nincluding members of al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he\r\ncould provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them\r\ndevelop their own.\r\n\r\nBefore September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam\r\nHussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and\r\nshadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19\r\nhijackers with other weapons and other plans -- this time armed by\r\nSaddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped\r\ninto this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever\r\nknown. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day\r\nnever comes.\r\n\r\nSome have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when\r\nhave terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely\r\nputting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to\r\nfully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all\r\nrecriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and\r\nrestraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option.\r\n\r\nThe dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has\r\nalready used them on whole villages -- leaving thousands of his own\r\ncitizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced\r\nconfessions are obtained -- by torturing children while their parents\r\nare made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued\r\nother methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock,\r\nburning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with\r\nelectric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil,\r\nthen evil has no meaning.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of\r\nIraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country -- your enemy is\r\nruling your country. And the day he and his regime are removed from\r\npower will be the day of your liberation.\r\n\r\nThe world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not\r\naccept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends\r\nand our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to\r\nconvene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing\r\ndefiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present\r\ninformation and intelligence about Iraqi's legal -- Iraq's illegal\r\nweapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors,\r\nand its links to terrorist groups.\r\n\r\nWe will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam\r\nHussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the\r\npeace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\r\n\r\nTonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace,\r\nmembers of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or\r\nnear the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those\r\nhours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has\r\nprepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and\r\nAmerica believes in you.\r\n\r\nSending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a President\r\ncan make. The technologies of war have changed; the risks and suffering\r\nof war have not. For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory\r\nis free from sorrow. This nation fights reluctantly, because we know\r\nthe cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come.\r\n\r\nWe seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be\r\ndefended. A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace\r\nat all. If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by\r\njust means -- sparing, in every way we can, the innocent. And if war is\r\nforced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the\r\nUnited States military -- and we will prevail.\r\n\r\nAnd as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will\r\nbring to the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies -- and\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nMany challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season.\r\nIn two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an\r\nawareness of peril; from bitter division in small matters to calm unity\r\nin great causes. And we go forward with confidence, because this call\r\nof history has come to the right country.\r\n\r\nAmericans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our\r\ntime. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world\r\nand to ourselves. America is a strong nation, and honorable in the use\r\nof our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice\r\nfor the liberty of strangers.\r\n\r\nAmericans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of\r\nevery person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is\r\nnot America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.\r\n\r\nWe Americans have faith in ourselves, but not in ourselves alone. We do\r\nnot know -- we do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we\r\ncan trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all\r\nof life, and all of history.\r\n\r\nMay He guide us now. And may God continue to bless the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nJanuary 20, 2004\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished\r\nguests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nAmerica this evening is a Nation called to great responsibilities. And\r\nwe are rising to meet them.\r\n\r\nAs we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American servicemen and\r\nwomen are deployed across the world in the war on terror. By bringing\r\nhope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are\r\nmaking America more secure.\r\n\r\nEach day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are\r\ntracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger\r\nlists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are\r\npatrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAmericans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in\r\nthe world. The American economy is growing stronger. The tax relief you\r\npassed is working.\r\n\r\nTonight, Members of Congress can take pride in great works of\r\ncompassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible. You are\r\nraising the standards of our public schools; and you are giving our\r\nsenior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\r\n\r\nWe have faced serious challenges together - and now we face a choice.\r\nWe can go forward with confidence and resolve - or we can turn back to\r\nthe dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw\r\nregimes are no threat to us. We can press on with economic growth, and\r\nreforms in education and Medicare - or we can turn back to the old\r\npolicies and old divisions.\r\n\r\nWe have not come all this way - through tragedy, and trial, and war -\r\nonly to falter and leave our work unfinished. Americans are rising to\r\nthe tasks of history, and they expect the same of us. In their efforts,\r\ntheir enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing\r\nthat the state of our Union is confident and strong.\r\n\r\nOur greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American\r\npeople. Twenty-eight months have passed since September 11th, 2001 -\r\nover two years without an attack on American soil - and it is tempting\r\nto believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable,\r\ncomforting - and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta,\r\nCasablanca, Riyadh, Mombassa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The\r\nterrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world.\r\nAnd by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.\r\n\r\nInside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give\r\nhomeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to\r\ndefend us. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which\r\nallows Federal law enforcement to better share information, to track\r\nterrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For\r\nyears, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug\r\ntraffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are\r\neven more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the\r\nPATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat will not\r\nexpire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital\r\nlegislation to protect our citizens - you need to renew the PATRIOT Act.\r\n\r\nAmerica is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this\r\nwar. Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September\r\n11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani\r\nauthorities. Last August 11th brought the capture of the terrorist\r\nHambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed\r\nover 200 people. We are tracking al-Qaida around the world - and nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed.\r\nThousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on a\r\nmanhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves\r\n- and, one by one, we will bring the terrorists to justice.\r\n\r\nAs part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the\r\nregimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply them with\r\nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The United States and our\r\nallies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made\r\nAfghanistan the primary training base of al-Qaida killers. As of this\r\nmonth, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections\r\nand full participation by women. Businesses are opening, health care\r\ncenters are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan\r\nare back in school. With help from the new Afghan Army, our coalition\r\nis leading aggressive raids against surviving members of the Taliban\r\nand al-Qaida. The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation\r\nthat is free, and proud, and fighting terror - and America is honored\r\nto be their friend.\r\n\r\nSince we last met in this chamber, combat forces of the United States,\r\nGreat Britain, Australia, Poland, and other countries enforced the\r\ndemands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein - and\r\nthe people of Iraq are free. Having broken the Baathist regime, we face\r\na remnant of violent Saddam supporters. Men who ran away from our\r\ntroops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.\r\n\r\nThese killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing\r\ndanger. Yet we are making progress against them. The once all-powerful\r\nruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a prison cell. Of\r\nthe top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed\r\n45. Our forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day,\r\nand conducting an average of 180 raids every week. We are dealing with\r\nthese thugs in Iraq, just as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's\r\nevil regime.\r\n\r\nThe work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America\r\nhas always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last\r\nJanuary, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our\r\ncoalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic\r\nlaw, with a bill of rights. We are working with Iraqis and the United\r\nNations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the\r\nend of June. As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom\r\nwill do all in their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying\r\nto shake the will of our country and our friends - but the United\r\nStates of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The\r\nkillers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.\r\n\r\nMonth by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own\r\nsecurity and their own future. And tonight we are honored to welcome\r\none of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current President of the\r\nIraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi. Sir, America stands with you\r\nand the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation.\r\n\r\nBecause of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for\r\nthe better. Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to\r\ndisclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction\r\nprograms, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons.\r\nColonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off,\r\nand far more secure, without weapons of mass murder. Nine months of\r\nintense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain\r\nsucceeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not.\r\nAnd one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be\r\ncredible - and no one can now doubt the word of America.\r\n\r\nDifferent threats require different strategies. Along with nations in\r\nthe region, we are insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear\r\nprogram. America and the international community are demanding that\r\nIran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons. America is\r\ncommitted to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the\r\nhands of the world's most dangerous regimes.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to this rostrum on September 20th, 2001, I brought the\r\npolice shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended, and\r\na task that does not end. I gave to you and to all Americans my\r\ncomplete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies.\r\nAnd this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many. You in the\r\nCongress have provided the resources for our defense, and cast the\r\ndifficult votes of war and peace. Our closest allies have been\r\nunwavering. America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been\r\nskilled and tireless.\r\n\r\nd the men and women of the American military - they have taken the\r\nhardest duty. We have seen their skill and courage in armored charges,\r\nand midnight raids, and lonely hours on faithful watch. We have seen\r\nthe joy when they return, and felt the sorrow when one is lost. I have\r\nhad the honor of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts, from\r\nthe deck of a carrier in the Pacific, to a mess hall in Baghdad. Many\r\nof our troops are listening tonight. And I want you and your families\r\nto know: America is proud of you. And my Administration, and this\r\nCongress, will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war\r\non terror.\r\n\r\nI know that some people question if America is really in a war at all.\r\nThey view terrorism more as a crime - a problem to be solved mainly\r\nwith law enforcement and indictments. After the World Trade Center was\r\nfirst attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted, tried,\r\nconvicted, and sent to prison. But the matter was not settled. The\r\nterrorists were still training and plotting in other nations, and\r\ndrawing up more ambitious plans. After the chaos and carnage of\r\nSeptember 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal\r\npapers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United\r\nStates - and war is what they got.\r\n\r\nSome in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the\r\nliberation of Iraq. Objections to war often come from principled\r\nmotives. But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam\r\nHussein in power. We are seeking all the facts - already the Kay Report\r\nidentified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program\r\nactivities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed\r\nfrom the United Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons\r\nof mass destruction programs would continue to this day. Had we failed\r\nto act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed\r\nas empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance\r\nby dictators around the world. Iraq's torture chambers would still be\r\nfilled with victims - terrified and innocent. The killing fields of\r\nIraq - where hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children vanished\r\ninto the sands - would still be known only to the killers. For all who\r\nlove freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a\r\nbetter and safer place.\r\n\r\nSome critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized.\r\nThis particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in\r\nBritain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand,\r\nItaly, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the\r\nNetherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have\r\ncommitted troops to Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore\r\nthe vital contributions of our international partners, or dismiss their\r\nsacrifices. From the beginning, America has sought international\r\nsupport for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much\r\nsupport. There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of\r\nmany nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will\r\nnever seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.\r\n\r\nWe also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater\r\nMiddle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and\r\ncondescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are\r\nincompatible with liberty and self-government. I believe that God has\r\nplanted in every heart the desire to live in freedom. And even when\r\nthat desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, despair, and\r\nanger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the\r\nsafety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward\r\nstrategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the\r\nenemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher\r\nstandard from our friends. To cut through the barriers of hateful\r\npropaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are\r\nexpanding their programming in Arabic and Persian - and soon, a new\r\ntelevision service will begin providing reliable news and information\r\nacross the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of\r\nthe National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the\r\ndevelopment of free elections, free markets, free press, and free labor\r\nunions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic\r\nwork of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light\r\nthe way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the world.\r\n\r\nAmerica is a Nation with a mission - and that mission comes from our\r\nmost basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of\r\nempire. Our aim is a democratic peace - a peace founded upon the\r\ndignity and rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause\r\nwith friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special\r\ncalling: This great Republic will lead the cause of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn these last three years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental\r\nstrengths of the American economy. We have come through recession, and\r\nterrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war.\r\nAnd because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this\r\neconomy is strong, and growing stronger.\r\n\r\nYou have doubled the child tax credit from 500 to a thousand dollars,\r\nreduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced\r\ntaxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small\r\nbusinesses, and you have lowered taxes for every American who pays\r\nincome taxes.\r\n\r\nAmericans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy\r\nforward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was\r\nthe fastest in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the highest in\r\nalmost 20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. Manufacturing\r\nactivity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low.\r\nExports are growing. Productivity is high. And jobs are on the rise.\r\n\r\nThese numbers confirm that the American people are using their money\r\nfar better than government would have - and you were right to return it.\r\n\r\nAmerica's growing economy is also a changing economy. As technology\r\ntransforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more\r\nproductive, and workers need new skills. Much of our job growth will be\r\nfound in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology. So we\r\nmust respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good\r\njobs in our new economy.\r\n\r\nAll skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are\r\nsupposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too\r\nlong, for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By\r\npassing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of\r\nliteracy the law of our country. We are providing more funding for our\r\nschools - a 36 percent increase since 2001. We are requiring higher\r\nstandards. We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We\r\nare reporting results to parents, and making sure they have better\r\noptions when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward\r\nexcellence for every child.\r\n\r\nBut the status quo always has defenders. Some want to undermine the No\r\nChild Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability. Yet\r\nthe results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect\r\nthird graders to read and do math at third grade level - and that is\r\nnot asking too much. Testing is the only way to identify and help\r\nstudents who are falling behind.\r\n\r\nThis Nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children\r\nalong from grade to grade without them learning the basics. I refuse to\r\ngive up on any child - and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the\r\ndoor of opportunity to all of America's children.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can\r\ngain the skills they need to find work now. Many of the fastest-growing\r\noccupations require strong math and science preparation, and training\r\nbeyond the high school level. So tonight I propose a series of measures\r\ncalled Jobs for the 21st Century. This program will provide extra help\r\nto middle- and high school students who fall behind in reading and\r\nmath, expand Advanced Placement programs in low-income schools, and\r\ninvite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach\r\npart-time in our high schools. I propose larger Pell Grants for\r\nstudents who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school.\r\nI propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges,\r\nso they can train workers for the industries that are creating the most\r\nnew jobs. By all these actions, we will help more and more Americans to\r\njoin in the growing prosperity of our country.\r\n\r\nJob training is important, and so is job creation. We must continue to\r\npursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda.\r\n\r\nCongress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes. The tax\r\nreductions you passed are set to expire. Unless you act, the unfair tax\r\non marriage will go back up. Unless you act, millions of families will\r\nbe charged 300 dollars more in Federal taxes for every child. Unless\r\nyou act, small businesses will pay higher taxes. Unless you act, the\r\ndeath tax will eventually come back to life. Unless you act, Americans\r\nface a tax increase. What the Congress has given, the Congress should\r\nnot take away: For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed\r\nshould be permanent.\r\n\r\nOur agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and\r\nemployees with relief from needless Federal regulation, and protect\r\nthem from junk and frivolous lawsuits. Consumers and businesses need\r\nreliable supplies of energy to make our economy run - so I urge you to\r\npass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote\r\nconservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of\r\nenergy. My Administration is promoting free and fair trade, to open up\r\nnew markets for America's entrepreneurs, and manufacturers, and\r\nfarmers, and to create jobs for America's workers. Younger workers\r\nshould have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their\r\nSocial Security taxes in a personal retirement account. We should make\r\nthe Social Security system a source of ownership for the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAnd we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting\r\nas good stewards of taxpayer dollars. In two weeks, I will send you a\r\nbudget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important\r\ndomestic needs, while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to\r\nless than four percent. This will require that Congress focus on\r\npriorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money.\r\nBy doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.\r\n\r\nTonight I also ask you to reform our immigration laws, so they reflect\r\nour values and benefit our economy. I propose a new temporary worker\r\nprogram to match willing foreign workers with willing employers, when\r\nno Americans can be found to fill the job. This reform will be good for\r\nour economy - because employers will find needed workers in an honest\r\nand orderly system. A temporary worker program will help protect our\r\nhomeland - allowing border patrol and law enforcement to focus on true\r\nthreats to our national security. I oppose amnesty, because it would\r\nencourage further illegal immigration, and unfairly reward those who\r\nbreak our laws. My temporary worker program will preserve the\r\ncitizenship path for those who respect the law, while bringing millions\r\nof hardworking men and women out from the shadows of American life.\r\n\r\nOur Nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of\r\nchange. Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives.\r\nThis dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising\r\ncosts of medical care and health insurance. Members of Congress, we\r\nmust work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits\r\nof modern medicine throughout our country.\r\n\r\nMeeting these goals requires bipartisan effort - and two months ago,\r\nyou showed the way. By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription\r\ndrug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are\r\ngiving them the modern medicine they deserve.\r\n\r\nStarting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to\r\nreceive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the\r\nretail price of most prescription drugs - and millions of low-income\r\nseniors can get an additional 600 dollars to buy medicine. Beginning\r\nnext year, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings\r\nagainst diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare\r\ncan receive wellness exams.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under\r\nMedicare. For a monthly premium of about 35 dollars, most seniors who\r\ndo not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut\r\nroughly in half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to\r\nkeep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan\r\nthat fits them best - just as you, as Members of Congress, can choose\r\nan insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year,\r\nmillions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their\r\nmedical expenses, in a health savings account.\r\n\r\nI signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of\r\nour seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under\r\nMedicare, will meet my veto.\r\n\r\nOn the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that\r\nAmericans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best\r\nfits their individual needs. To make insurance more affordable,\r\nCongress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs. Small\r\nbusinesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower\r\ninsurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance -\r\nI urge you to pass Association Health Plans. I ask you to give\r\nlower-income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow\r\nmillions to buy their own basic health insurance. By computerizing\r\nhealth records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs,\r\nand improve care. To protect the doctor-patient relationship, and keep\r\ngood doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous\r\nmedical lawsuits. And tonight I propose that individuals who buy\r\ncatastrophic health care coverage, as part of our new health savings\r\naccounts, be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nA government-run health care system is the wrong prescription. By\r\nkeeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more\r\nAmericans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private\r\nmedicine that makes America's health care the best in the world.\r\n\r\nWe are living in a time of great change - in our world, in our economy,\r\nand in science and medicine. Yet some things endure - courage and\r\ncompassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith\r\nand race. The values we try to live by never change. And they are\r\ninstilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families, and\r\nschools, and religious congregations. These institutions - the unseen\r\npillars of civilization - must remain strong in America, and we will\r\ndefend them.\r\n\r\nWe must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, responsible\r\nchildren. And when it comes to helping children make right choices,\r\nthere is work for all of us to do.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their\r\nlives and futures on drugs. Our government is helping parents confront\r\nthis problem, with aggressive education, treatment, and law\r\nenforcement. Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over\r\nthe past two years. Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using\r\nillegal drugs than in the year 2001. In my budget, I have proposed new\r\nfunding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce\r\ndemand for illegal drugs. Drug testing in our schools has proven to be\r\nan effective part of this effort. So tonight I propose an additional 23\r\nmillion dollars for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to\r\nsave children's lives. The aim here is not to punish children, but to\r\nsend them this message: We love you, and we don't want to lose you.\r\n\r\nTo help children make right choices, they need good examples. Athletics\r\nplay such an important role in our society, but, unfortunately, some in\r\nprofessional sports are not setting much of an example. The use of\r\nperformance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and\r\nother sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message - that there\r\nare shortcuts to accomplishment, and that performance is more important\r\nthan character. So tonight I call on team owners, union\r\nrepresentatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the\r\nright signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now.\r\n\r\nTo encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers\r\nyoung people face - even when they are difficult to talk about. Each\r\nyear, about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted\r\ndiseases that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever\r\nbecoming parents. In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help\r\ninform families about these medical risks. We will double Federal\r\nfunding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of\r\nlife: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid\r\nsexually transmitted diseases. Decisions children make now can affect\r\ntheir health and character for the rest of their lives. All of us -\r\nparents, schools, government - must work together to counter the\r\nnegative influence of the culture, and to send the right messages to\r\nour children.\r\n\r\nA strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe\r\nwe should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of\r\nthe most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization.\r\nCongress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense\r\nof Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute\r\nprotects marriage under Federal law as the union of a man and a woman,\r\nand declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states.\r\nActivist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court\r\norder, without regard for the will of the people and their elected\r\nrepresentatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's\r\nvoice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will\r\nupon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the\r\nconstitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this debate is important - and so is the way we conduct\r\nit. The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that\r\neach individual has dignity and value in God's sight.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the\r\ncompassion of America's religious institutions. Religious charities of\r\nevery creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country -\r\nmentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely.\r\nYet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to\r\nthese groups, just because they have a cross or Star of David or\r\ncrescent on the wall. By Executive Order, I have opened billions of\r\ndollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based\r\ncharities. Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of\r\nfaith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again.\r\n\r\nIn the past, we have worked together to bring mentors to the children\r\nof prisoners, and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the\r\nhomeless. Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in\r\nneed of help. This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from\r\nprison back into society. We know from long experience that if they\r\ncan't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to\r\ncommit more crimes and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a\r\nfour-year, 300 million dollar Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative to expand\r\njob training and placement services, to provide transitional housing,\r\nand to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from\r\nfaith-based groups. America is the land of the second chance - and when\r\nthe gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFor all Americans, the last three years have brought tests we did not\r\nask for, and achievements shared by all. By our actions, we have shown\r\nwhat kind of Nation we are. In grief, we found the grace to go on. In\r\nchallenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people. In\r\nvictory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America. And\r\nhaving come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart.\r\n\r\nI have been a witness to the character of the American people, who have\r\nshown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and\r\ntoughness for the long haul. All of us have been partners in a great\r\nenterprise. And even some of the youngest understand that we are living\r\nin historic times. Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me\r\na letter. It began, \"Dear George W. Bush.\" \"If there is anything you\r\nknow, I Ashley Pearson age 10 can do to help anyone, please send me a\r\nletter and tell me what I can do to save our country.\" She added this\r\nP.S.: \"If you can send a letter to the troops ... please put, 'Ashley\r\nPearson believes in you.'\" Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops\r\nhas just been conveyed. And yes, you have some duties yourself. Study\r\nhard in school, listen to your mom and dad, help someone in need, and\r\nwhen you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say \"thank\r\nyou.\" And while you do your part, all of us here in this great chamber\r\nwill do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith. Our\r\nNation is strong and steadfast. The cause we serve is right, because it\r\nis the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is\r\nunmistakable - and it is not carried forward by our power alone. We can\r\ntrust in that greater power Who guides the unfolding of the years. And\r\nin all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true.\r\n\r\nMay God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nFebruary 2, 2005\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow\r\ncitizens:\r\n\r\nAs a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of\r\ngovernment share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the\r\nvotes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share\r\nwith newly-elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories,\r\nUkraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the\r\ncommitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This\r\nevening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\nTonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going\r\nback to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world --\r\nthe state of our union is confident and strong.\r\n\r\nOur generation has been blessed -- by the expansion of opportunity, by\r\nadvances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents'\r\nsacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror -- or a lot of\r\ngray -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the\r\nquestion: What will be the state of their union? Members of Congress,\r\nthe choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next\r\nseveral months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have\r\nalways done, and build a better world for our children and our\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great\r\ninstitutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. America's\r\neconomy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In\r\nthe past four years, we provided tax relief to every person who pays\r\nincome taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad,\r\nprosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest\r\nlevel in history, and in the last year alone, the United States has\r\nadded 2.3 million new jobs. When action was needed, the Congress\r\ndelivered -- and the nation is grateful.\r\n\r\nNow we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more\r\nflexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America\r\nthe economic leader of the world.\r\n\r\nAmerica's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the\r\nfederal government. I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending\r\ndiscipline. I will send you a budget that holds the growth of\r\ndiscretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and\r\nstays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget\r\nsubstantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs\r\nthat are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not\r\nfulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: Taxpayer\r\ndollars must be spent wisely, or not at all.\r\n\r\nTo make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising\r\ngeneration to fill the jobs of the 21st century. Under the No Child\r\nLeft Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and\r\nwe're closing the achievement gap for minority students. Now we must\r\ndemand better results from our high schools, so every high school\r\ndiploma is a ticket to success. We will help an additional 200,000\r\nworkers to get training for a better career, by reforming our job\r\ntraining system and strengthening America's community colleges. And\r\nwe'll make it easier for Americans to afford a college education, by\r\nincreasing the size of Pell Grants.\r\n\r\nTo make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward,\r\nnot punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. Small business is\r\nthe path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we\r\nmust free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest\r\njob-creators from junk lawsuits. Justice is distorted, and our economy\r\nis held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous asbestos\r\nclaims -- and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.\r\n\r\nTo make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health\r\ncare more affordable, and give families greater access to good coverage\r\n-- and more control over their health decisions. I ask Congress to move\r\nforward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help\r\nlow-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every\r\npoor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error\r\nand needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and\r\ntheir employees -- -- expanded health savings accounts -- and medical\r\nliability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure\r\npatients have the doctors and care they need.\r\n\r\nTo keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of\r\naffordable, environmentally responsible energy. Nearly four years ago,\r\nI submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages\r\nconservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and\r\nmore production here at home -- including safe, clean nuclear energy.\r\nMy Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve\r\nthe health of our citizens. And my budget provides strong funding for\r\nleading-edge technology -- from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to\r\nrenewable sources such as ethanol. Four years of debate is enough: I\r\nurge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and\r\nless dependent on foreign energy.\r\n\r\nAll these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new\r\njobs -- but they are just the beginning of our duty. To build the\r\nprosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were\r\ncreated to meet the needs of an earlier time. Year after year,\r\nAmericans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. I've\r\nappointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to\r\nbottom. And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will\r\nwork together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy\r\nto understand, and fair to all.\r\n\r\nAmerica's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs\r\nof our economy and to the values of our country. We should not be\r\ncontent with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to\r\nprovide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and\r\ninvite chaos at our border. It is time for an immigration policy that\r\npermits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take,\r\nthat rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our\r\ncountry, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists.\r\n\r\nOne of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust\r\nbetween generations -- is also in need of wise and effective reform.\r\nSocial Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we\r\nmust honor its great purposes in this new century. The system, however,\r\non its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. And so we must join\r\ntogether to strengthen and save Social Security.\r\n\r\nToday, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits,\r\nand millions more are nearing retirement -- and for them the system is\r\nsound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is\r\n55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social\r\nSecurity system will not change in any way. For younger workers, the\r\nSocial Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with\r\ntime. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different\r\nera. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were much\r\nlower than they are today. And a half-century ago, about sixteen\r\nworkers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.\r\n\r\nOur society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could\r\nnot have foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and,\r\ntherefore, drawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to\r\nrise dramatically over the next few decades. And instead of sixteen\r\nworkers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about\r\nthree workers. And over the next few decades that number will fall to\r\njust two workers per beneficiary. With each passing year, fewer workers\r\nare paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.\r\n\r\nSo here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social\r\nSecurity will be paying out more than it takes in. And every year\r\nafterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. For\r\nexample, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up\r\nwith an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat -- and by 2033,\r\nthe annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion. By the year 2042,\r\nthe entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. If steps are not\r\ntaken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically\r\nhigher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in\r\nSocial Security benefits or other government programs.\r\n\r\nI recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates\r\nare not so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a\r\nfive-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for\r\ncollege tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their\r\n20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before\r\nthey retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a\r\nsmall matter to the United States Congress. You and I share a\r\nresponsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems\r\nof Social Security once and for all.\r\n\r\nFixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review\r\nof the options. Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy\r\nretirees. Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of\r\nindexing benefits to prices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my\r\npredecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age.\r\nFormer Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of\r\nSocial Security benefits. The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan\r\nrecommended changing the way benefits are calculated. All these ideas\r\nare on the table.\r\n\r\nI know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move\r\nahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement\r\nsecurity is more important than partisan politics. I will work with\r\nmembers of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms.\r\nI will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer. We must, however,\r\nbe guided by some basic principles. We must make Social Security\r\npermanently sound, not leave that task for another day. We must not\r\njeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. We must\r\nensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have\r\ndignity and peace of mind in their retirement. We must guarantee there\r\nis no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. And we must\r\ntake care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger\r\nworkers have years to prepare and plan for their future.\r\n\r\nAs we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the\r\nsystem a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach\r\nthat goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is\r\nhow the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is\r\ntaken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of\r\ntoday's retirees. If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be\r\nable to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so\r\nyou can build a nest egg for your own future.\r\n\r\nHere's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will\r\ngrow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can\r\ndeliver -- and your account will provide money for retirement over and\r\nabove the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition,\r\nyou'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your\r\npersonal account, if you wish, to your children and -- or\r\ngrandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and\r\nthe government can never take it away.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful\r\nguidelines for personal accounts. We'll make sure the money can only go\r\ninto a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that\r\nyour earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make\r\nsure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden\r\nmarket swings on the eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal\r\naccount cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over\r\ntime, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we'll\r\nmake sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal\r\nretirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on\r\ncontributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside\r\nfour percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.\r\n\r\nPersonal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees,\r\nbecause you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings\r\nPlan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any\r\nof five different broadly-based investment funds. It's time to extend\r\nthe same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans.\r\n\r\nOur second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to\r\nhonor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many\r\nof my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and\r\nfaith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children.\r\nGovernment is not the source of these values, but government should\r\nnever undermine them.\r\n\r\nBecause marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society,\r\nit should not be re-defined by activist judges. For the good of\r\nfamilies, children, and society, I support a constitutional amendment\r\nto protect the institution of marriage.\r\n\r\nBecause a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable,\r\nwe must strive to build a culture of life. Medical research can help us\r\nreach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and\r\nhelp people overcome disabilities -- and I thank the Congress for\r\ndoubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. To build a\r\nculture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always\r\nserve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit\r\nof others. We should all be able to agree -- -- we should all be able\r\nto agree on some clear standards. I will work with Congress to ensure\r\nthat human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for\r\nbody parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a\r\ncommodity. America will continue to lead the world in medical research\r\nthat is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.\r\n\r\nBecause courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a\r\nduty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As\r\nPresident, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and\r\nwomen who understand the role of courts in our democracy, and are\r\nwell-qualified to serve on the bench -- and I have done so. The\r\nConstitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial\r\nnominee deserves an up or down vote.\r\n\r\nBecause one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must\r\nnever turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the\r\nopportunities of America. Our government will continue to support\r\nfaith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now\r\nwe need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our\r\ncities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. Tonight I\r\npropose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people\r\nout of gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects\r\nwomen and rejects violence. Taking on gang life will be one part of a\r\nbroader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors,\r\ncoaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to\r\nsports. And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will\r\nbe our First Lady, Laura Bush.\r\n\r\nBecause HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask\r\nyou to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and\r\nprovide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we\r\nupdate this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens\r\nwith the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women.\r\n\r\nBecause one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in\r\nequal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and\r\nbackgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In\r\nAmerica we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a\r\ncrime he or she did not commit -- so we are dramatically expanding the\r\nuse of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to\r\nCongress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in\r\ncapital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have\r\ncompetent lawyers by their side.\r\n\r\nOur third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an\r\nAmerica that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. We will pass\r\nalong to our children all the freedoms we enjoy -- and chief among them\r\nis freedom from fear.\r\n\r\nIn the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we have\r\ntaken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new\r\ndepartment of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on\r\npreventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken\r\nup terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses\r\nagainst biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and\r\ntrained more than a half-million first responders. Police and\r\nfirefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working\r\nevery day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all.\r\n\r\nOur nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the\r\nenemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and\r\ncontinuing. The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still\r\nhas leaders -- but many of its top commanders have been removed. There\r\nare still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists -- but their\r\nnumber has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass\r\ndestruction -- but no longer without attention and without consequence.\r\nOur country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many,\r\nand intimidate us all -- and we will stay on the offensive against\r\nthem, until the fight is won.\r\n\r\nPursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror -- and\r\nI thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the\r\nresources they have needed. During this time of war, we must continue\r\nto support our military and give them the tools for victory.\r\n\r\nOther nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an\r\ninternational force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries\r\nhave troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union\r\nprovided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a\r\nmission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60\r\ngovernments in the Proliferation Security Initiative, to detect and\r\nstop the transit of dangerous materials. We're working closely with the\r\ngovernments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear\r\nambitions. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have\r\ncaptured or detained al Qaeda terrorists. In the next four years, my\r\nadministration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat\r\nthe dangers of our time.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by\r\neliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of\r\nmurder. If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in\r\nhatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror\r\nwill stalk America and other free nations for decades. The only force\r\npowerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace\r\nhatred with hope, is the force of human freedom. Our enemies know this,\r\nand that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he\r\ncalled the \"evil principle\" of democracy. And we've declared our own\r\nintention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support\r\ndemocratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate\r\ngoal of ending tyranny in our world.\r\n\r\nThe United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose\r\nour form of government on anyone else. That is one of the main\r\ndifferences between us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand\r\nan empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal,\r\nself-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. Our aim is to\r\nbuild and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with\r\ngovernments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own\r\ncultures. And because democracies respect their own people and their\r\nneighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace.\r\n\r\nThat advance has great momentum in our time -- shown by women voting in\r\nAfghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people\r\nof Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president.\r\nWe are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. And in the\r\ncoming years, we will add to that story.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories\r\nare now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence\r\nand failure. Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a\r\ntrip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with\r\nPrime Minister Sharon and President Abbas. She will discuss with them\r\nhow we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and\r\nbuild the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. To\r\npromote this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support\r\nPalestinian political, economic, and security reforms. The goal of two\r\ndemocratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace,\r\nis within reach -- and America will help them achieve that goal.\r\n\r\nTo promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United\r\nStates will work with our friends in the region to fight the common\r\nthreat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom.\r\nHopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan\r\nto Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its\r\nleadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in\r\ndetermining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt,\r\nwhich showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the\r\nway toward democracy in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nTo promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes\r\nthat continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder.\r\nSyria still allows its territory, and parts of Lebanon, to be used by\r\nterrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. You\r\nhave passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act -- and\r\nwe expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open\r\nthe door to freedom. Today, Iran remains the world's primary state\r\nsponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its\r\npeople of the freedom they seek and deserve. We are working with\r\nEuropean allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give\r\nup its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and\r\nend its support for terror. And to the Iranian people, I say tonight:\r\nAs you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you.\r\n\r\nOur generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in\r\nthe Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country\r\nis a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have\r\nchosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting\r\nterrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home. And\r\nthe victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on\r\nterror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring\r\nmore hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a\r\nterrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nWe will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty -- as\r\nthey showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk,\r\nmillions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to\r\nrepresent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A young woman\r\nin Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day,\r\nand wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, \"Hearing\r\nthose explosions, it occurred to me -- the insurgents are weak, they\r\nare afraid of democracy, they are losing. So I got my husband, and I\r\ngot my parents, and we all came out and voted together.\"\r\n\r\nAmericans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. In any\r\nnation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for\r\nmillions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they\r\nhave earned the respect of us all.\r\n\r\nOne of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia\r\nTaleb al-Suhail. She says of her country, \"We were occupied for 35\r\nyears by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the\r\nAmerican people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers.\"\r\nEleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's\r\nintelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able\r\nto vote for the leaders of her country -- and we are honored that she\r\nis with us tonight.\r\n\r\nThe terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and\r\nwill continue to attack it. Yet, the terrorists' most powerful myth is\r\nbeing destroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and\r\nassassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to\r\ndestroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections. And the whole\r\nworld now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the\r\nwill of the Iraqi people.\r\n\r\nWe will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for\r\ntheir own freedom, and to write their own history. As Prime Minister\r\nAllawi said in his speech to Congress last September, \"Ordinary Iraqis\r\nare anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as\r\nquickly as possible.\" That is the natural desire of an independent\r\nnation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The\r\nnew political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in\r\nconsultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our\r\nefforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces -- forces\r\nwith skilled officers and an effective command structure. As those\r\nforces become more self-reliant and take on greater security\r\nresponsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly\r\nbe in a supporting role. In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend\r\ntheir own country -- and we will help that proud, new nation secure its\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nRecently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, \"Tell America not to\r\nabandon us.\" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military\r\nstrategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and\r\nunchanging. We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and\r\nfreedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. We\r\nwill not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that\r\nwould embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us\r\nout. We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is democratic,\r\nrepresentative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able\r\nto defend itself. And when that result is achieved, our men and women\r\nserving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned.\r\n\r\nRight now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world,\r\noften taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and\r\nequipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character\r\nthat makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are\r\nunrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and\r\ndecency, and every day they're making our nation more secure. Some of\r\nour servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this\r\ngrateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. And we\r\nhave said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our\r\nfreedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever.\r\n\r\nOne name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of\r\nPflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His\r\nmom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a\r\nMarine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror.\r\nShe wrote, \"When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to\r\nprotect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said,\r\n'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'\" Ladies\r\nand gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders, and\r\nour military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant\r\nNorwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.\r\n\r\nIn these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events.\r\nWe have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of\r\nvictory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen\r\nthreads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world\r\nhas reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world.\r\nWe are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in\r\nour country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to\r\nspread the peace that freedom brings.\r\n\r\nAs Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, \"Each age is a dream\r\nthat is dying, or one that is coming to birth.\" And we live in the\r\ncountry where the biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was\r\nonly a dream -- until it was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from\r\nfascism was only a dream -- until it was achieved. The fall of imperial\r\ncommunism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished. Our\r\ngeneration has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with\r\nconfidence. The road of Providence is uneven and unpredictable -- yet\r\nwe know where it leads: It leads to freedom.\r\n\r\nThank you, and may God bless America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nJanuary 31, 2006\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, Members of the\r\nSupreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow\r\ncitizens:\r\n\r\nToday our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called\r\nAmerica to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. Tonight we\r\nare comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was\r\ntaken from her so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of\r\nCoretta Scott King.\r\n\r\nEach time I am invited to this rostrum, I am humbled by the privilege,\r\nand mindful of the history we have seen together. We have gathered\r\nunder this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national\r\nachievement. We have served America through one of the most\r\nconsequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to\r\nserve with you.\r\n\r\nIn a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches,\r\nthere will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can\r\nbe conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to\r\nharden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act\r\nin a spirit of good will and respect for one another -- and I will do my\r\npart. Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will\r\nmake it stronger.\r\n\r\nIn this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both\r\nthe future and the character of our country. We will choose to act\r\nconfidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our\r\nduties in the hope of an easier life. We will choose to build our\r\nprosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from\r\ntrade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of\r\nisolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting -- yet it\r\nends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people ... the\r\nonly way to secure the peace ... the only way to control our destiny is\r\nby our leadership -- so the United States of America will continue to\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nAbroad, our Nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we\r\nseek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as\r\nmisguided idealism. In reality, the future security of America depends\r\non it. On September 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a\r\nfailed and oppressive state seven thousand miles away could bring\r\nmurder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter\r\nterrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the\r\nrights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight\r\nagainst terror. Every step toward freedom in the world makes our\r\ncountry safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.\r\n\r\nFar from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great\r\nstory of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely\r\ndemocracies on Earth. Today, there are 122. And we are writing a new\r\nchapter in the story of self-government -- with women lining up to vote\r\nin Afghanistan ... and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with\r\npurple ink ... and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the\r\nrights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. At the start of\r\n2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic\r\nnations. And we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria,\r\nBurma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran -- because the demands of\r\njustice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom as well.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight\r\nagainst it. And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is\r\nradical Islam -- the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an\r\nideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious\r\nabout mass murder -- and all of us must take their declared intentions\r\nseriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian\r\ncontrol throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of\r\nmass murder. Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe\r\nhaven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the\r\nmilitary strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen\r\nthe weapon of fear. When they murder children at a school in Beslan ...\r\nor blow up commuters in London ... or behead a bound captive ... the\r\nterrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent\r\nto inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated: We love our freedom,\r\nand we will fight to keep it.\r\n\r\nIn a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our\r\ncommitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave\r\nthese vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They\r\nwould simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace\r\nin retreat. And there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam\r\nto work its will -- by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself --\r\nwe would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or\r\neven in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be\r\ncertain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will\r\nnever surrender to evil.\r\n\r\nAmerica rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the Nation\r\nthat saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped\r\nraise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we\r\naccept the call of history to deliver the oppressed, and move this\r\nworld toward peace.\r\n\r\nWe remain on the offensive against terror networks. We have killed or\r\ncaptured many of their leaders -- and for the others, their day will\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nWe remain on the offensive in Afghanistan -- where a fine president and\r\nnational assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions\r\nof a new democracy.\r\n\r\nAnd we are on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory.\r\nFirst, we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old\r\nresentments will be eased, and the insurgency marginalized. Second, we\r\nare continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government\r\nto fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can\r\nexperience the benefits of freedom. Third, we are striking terrorist\r\ntargets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of\r\ndefeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we\r\nare proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.\r\n\r\nOur work in Iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. But that\r\nbrutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In\r\nless than three years, that nation has gone from dictatorship, to\r\nliberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections.\r\nAt the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off\r\nterrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning\r\nover territory to Iraqi security forces. I am confident in our plan for\r\nvictory ... I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people ... I am\r\nconfident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we\r\nare in this fight to win, and we are winning.\r\n\r\nThe road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. As we\r\nmake progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the\r\nlead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels -- but\r\nthose decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by\r\npoliticians in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nOur coalition has learned from experience in Iraq. We have adjusted our\r\nmilitary tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the\r\nway, we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered\r\nby Members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will\r\ncontinue to reach out and seek your good advice.\r\n\r\nYet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for\r\nsuccess, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but\r\nfailure. Hindsight alone is not wisdom. And second-guessing is not a\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\nWith so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty\r\nto speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would\r\nabandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison ... put men like bin Laden\r\nand Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country ... and show that a pledge\r\nfrom America means little. Members of Congress: however we feel about\r\nthe decisions and debates of the past, our Nation has only one option:\r\nWe must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the\r\nAmerican military in its vital mission.\r\n\r\nOur men and women in uniform are making sacrifices -- and showing a\r\nsense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it is like to\r\nfight house to house in a maze of streets ... to wear heavy gear in the\r\ndesert heat ... to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb. And those who\r\nknow the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was\r\nkilled last month fighting the enemy in Fallujah. He left behind a\r\nletter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to\r\nevery American. Here is what Dan wrote: \"I know what honor is. It has\r\nbeen an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the\r\nsecure knowledge that you would not have to.... Never falter! Don't\r\nhesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of\r\nprotecting that which is worth protecting.\"\r\n\r\nStaff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and\r\nBud, are with us this evening. Our Nation is grateful to the fallen,\r\nwho live in the memory of our country. We are grateful to all who\r\nvolunteer to wear our Nation's uniform -- and as we honor our brave\r\ntroops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nOur offensive against terror involves more than military action.\r\nUltimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their\r\ndark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of\r\npolitical freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America\r\nsupports democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections\r\nare vital -- but they are only the beginning. Raising up a democracy\r\nrequires the rule of law, protection of minorities, and strong,\r\naccountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great\r\npeople of Egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election -- and\r\nnow their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will\r\nreduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in\r\nelections -- now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm,\r\nreject terrorism, and work for lasting peace. Saudi Arabia has taken\r\nthe first steps of reform -- now it can offer its people a better future\r\nby pressing forward with those efforts. Democracies in the Middle East\r\nwill not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of\r\ntheir own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the\r\nMiddle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical\r\nelite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that\r\ncountry sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in\r\nLebanon -- and that must come to an end. The Iranian government is\r\ndefying the world with its nuclear ambitions -- and the nations of the\r\nworld must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons.\r\nAmerica will continue to rally the world to confront these threats. And\r\ntonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America\r\nrespects you, and we respect your country. We respect your right to\r\nchoose your own future and win your own freedom. And our Nation hopes\r\none day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.\r\n\r\nTo overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by\r\nencouraging economic progress, fighting disease, and spreading hope in\r\nhopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting\r\nenemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need.\r\nWe show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given\r\ndignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with\r\nmalaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into\r\nslavery. We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by\r\npoverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, organized\r\ncrime, human trafficking, and the drug trade.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight\r\nAIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing\r\nnations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. For\r\npeople everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life.\r\nShort-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of\r\nour world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of\r\nour country. I urge Members of Congress to serve the interests of\r\nAmerica by showing the compassion of America.\r\n\r\nOur country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at\r\nhome. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.\r\nFortunately, this Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement,\r\nintelligence, the military, and homeland security. These men and women\r\nare dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our\r\nsupport and our thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already\r\nuse to fight drug trafficking and organized crime -- so I ask you to\r\nreauthorize the Patriot Act.\r\n\r\nIt is said that prior to the attacks of September 11th, our government\r\nfailed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of\r\nthe hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al-Qaida\r\noperatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until it was\r\ntoo late. So to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me\r\nby the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist\r\nsurveillance program to aggressively pursue the international\r\ncommunications of suspected al-Qaida operatives and affiliates to and\r\nfrom America. Previous presidents have used the same constitutional\r\nauthority I have -- and Federal courts have approved the use of that\r\nauthority. Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed.\r\nThis terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist\r\nattacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If there are\r\npeople inside our country who are talking with al-Qaida, we want to\r\nknow about it -- because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.\r\n\r\nIn all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory\r\nin Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions -- we\r\nneed the support of friends and allies. To draw that support, we must\r\nalways be clear in our principles and willing to act. The only\r\nalternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and\r\nanxious world. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to\r\nserve the values that gave us birth. American leaders -- from Roosevelt\r\nto Truman to Kennedy to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat,\r\nbecause they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on\r\nthe march. Our own generation is in a long war against a determined\r\nenemy -- a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who\r\nwill need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I\r\nask for yours. Together, let us protect our country, support the men\r\nand women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.\r\n\r\nHere at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the\r\nprosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOur economy is healthy, and vigorous, and growing faster than other\r\nmajor industrialized nations. In the last two-and-a-half years, America\r\nhas created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European\r\nUnion combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural\r\ndisasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance\r\nthat is the envy of the world.\r\n\r\nThe American economy is pre-eminent -- but we cannot afford to be\r\ncomplacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors\r\nlike China and India. This creates uncertainty, which makes it easier\r\nto feed people's fears. And so we are seeing some old temptations\r\nreturn. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we\r\ncan keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy.\r\nOthers say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing\r\nthe economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing\r\ntaxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy --\r\neven though this economy could not function without them. All these are\r\nforms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction -- toward\r\na stagnant and second-rate economy.\r\n\r\nTonight I will set out a better path -- an agenda for a Nation that\r\ncompetes with confidence -- an agenda that will raise standards of\r\nliving and generate new jobs. Americans should not fear our economic\r\nfuture, because we intend to shape it.\r\n\r\nKeeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing.\r\nAnd our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to\r\nspend, save, and invest. In the last five years, the tax relief you\r\npassed has left 880 billion dollars in the hands of American workers,\r\ninvestors, small businesses, and families -- and they have used it to\r\nhelp produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. Yet\r\nthe tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. If we do\r\nnothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not\r\nexpect and will not welcome.\r\n\r\nBecause America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more\r\nthan temporary tax relief. I urge the Congress to act responsibly, and\r\nmake the tax cuts permanent.\r\n\r\nKeeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax\r\ndollars. Every year of my presidency, we have reduced the growth of\r\nnon-security discretionary spending -- and last year you passed bills\r\nthat cut this spending. This year my budget will cut it again, and\r\nreduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly\r\nor not fulfilling essential priorities. By passing these reforms, we\r\nwill save the American taxpayer another 14 billion dollars next year --\r\nand stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. I am pleased that\r\nMembers of Congress are working on earmark reform -- because the Federal\r\nbudget has too many special interest projects. And we can tackle this\r\nproblem together, if you pass the line-item veto.\r\n\r\nWe must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or\r\nentitlements. This year, the first of about 78 million Baby Boomers\r\nturn 60, including two of my Dad's favorite people -- me, and President\r\nBill Clinton. This milestone is more than a personal crisis -- it is a\r\nnational challenge. The retirement of the Baby Boom generation will put\r\nunprecedented strains on the Federal government. By 2030, spending for\r\nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent\r\nof the entire Federal budget. And that will present future Congresses\r\nwith impossible choices -- staggering tax increases, immense deficits,\r\nor deep cuts in every category of spending.\r\n\r\nCongress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security,\r\nyet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away\r\n-- and with every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse. So\r\ntonight, I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the\r\nfull impact of Baby Boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and\r\nMedicaid. This commission should include Members of Congress of both\r\nparties, and offer bipartisan answers. We need to put aside partisan\r\npolitics, work together, and get this problem solved.\r\n\r\nKeeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all\r\nthat Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in\r\nAmerica is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to\r\nbuy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can\r\nout-produce or out-compete the American worker.\r\n\r\nKeeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds\r\nour laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.\r\nOur Nation needs orderly and secure borders. To meet this goal, we must\r\nhave stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. And we\r\nmust have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty\r\n... allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally ... and reduces\r\nsmuggling and crime at the border.\r\n\r\nKeeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our\r\ngovernment has a responsibility to help provide health care for the\r\npoor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all\r\nAmericans, we must confront the rising cost of care ... strengthen the\r\ndoctor-patient relationship ... and help people afford the insurance\r\ncoverage they need. We will make wider use of electronic records and\r\nother health information technology, to help control costs and reduce\r\ndangerous medical errors. We will strengthen Health Savings Accounts --\r\nby making sure individuals and small business employees can buy\r\ninsurance with the same advantages that people working for big\r\nbusinesses now get. We will do more to make this coverage portable, so\r\nworkers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their\r\nhealth insurance. And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors\r\nout of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties\r\nwithout a single OB-GYN -- I ask the Congress to pass medical liability\r\nreform this year.\r\n\r\nKeeping America competitive requires affordable energy. Here we have a\r\nserious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported\r\nfrom unstable parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001,\r\nwe have spent nearly 10 billion dollars to develop cleaner, cheaper,\r\nmore reliable alternative energy sources -- and we are on the threshold\r\nof incredible advances. So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy\r\nInitiative -- a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research at the\r\nDepartment of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To\r\nchange how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in\r\nzero-emission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind\r\ntechnologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy.\r\n\r\nWe must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our\r\nresearch in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in\r\npollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. We will also fund additional\r\nresearch in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from\r\ncorn but from wood chips, stalks, or switch grass. Our goal is to make\r\nthis new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years.\r\nBreakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach\r\nanother great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports\r\nfrom the Middle East by 2025. By applying the talent and technology of\r\nAmerica, this country can dramatically improve our environment ... move\r\nbeyond a petroleum-based economy ... and make our dependence on Middle\r\nEastern oil a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nAnd to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all:\r\nWe must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. Our\r\ngreatest advantage in the world has always been our educated,\r\nhard-working, ambitious people -- and we are going to keep that edge.\r\nTonight I announce the American Competitiveness Initiative, to\r\nencourage innovation throughout our economy, and to give our Nation's\r\nchildren a firm grounding in math and science.\r\n\r\nFirst: I propose to double the Federal commitment to the most critical\r\nbasic research programs in the physical sciences over the next ten\r\nyears. This funding will support the work of America's most creative\r\nminds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology,\r\nsupercomputing, and alternative energy sources.\r\n\r\nSecond: I propose to make permanent the research and development tax\r\ncredit, to encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology.\r\nWith more research in both the public and private sectors, we will\r\nimprove our quality of life -- and ensure that America will lead the\r\nworld in opportunity and innovation for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThird: We need to encourage children to take more math and science, and\r\nmake sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other\r\nnations. We have made a good start in the early grades with the No\r\nChild Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test\r\nscores across our country. Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high\r\nschool teachers, to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science\r\n... bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms ...\r\nand give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a\r\nbetter chance at good, high-wage jobs. If we ensure that America's\r\nchildren succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nPreparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us\r\ncan share. I urge you to support the American Competitiveness\r\nInitiative ... and together we will show the world what the American\r\npeople can achieve.\r\n\r\nAmerica is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness\r\nis not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we\r\ntreat one another. So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, America has become a more hopeful Nation. Violent\r\ncrime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare\r\ncases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use\r\namong youth is down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in\r\nAmerica than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of\r\nchildren born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in\r\na row.\r\n\r\nThese gains are evidence of a quiet transformation -- a revolution of\r\nconscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of\r\npersonal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. Government has played\r\na role. Wise policies such as welfare reform, drug education, and\r\nsupport for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the\r\ncharacter of our country. And everyone here tonight, Democrat and\r\nRepublican, has a right to be proud of this record.\r\n\r\nYet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about\r\nthe direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic\r\ninstitutions. They are concerned about unethical conduct by public\r\nofficials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine\r\nmarriage. And they worry about children in our society who need\r\ndirection and love ... and about fellow citizens still displaced by\r\nnatural disaster ... and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.\r\n\r\nAs we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief\r\nthat America is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel.\r\nThe American people know better than that. We have proven the\r\npessimists wrong before -- and we will do it again.\r\n\r\nA hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under\r\nlaw. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members, Chief Justice\r\nJohn Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming\r\nboth of them. And I will continue to nominate men and women who\r\nunderstand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate\r\nfrom the bench. Today marks the official retirement of a very special\r\nAmerican. For 24 years of faithful service to our Nation, the United\r\nStates is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\r\n\r\nA hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not\r\ncut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every\r\nlife. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most\r\negregious abuses of medical research -- human cloning in all its forms ...\r\ncreating or implanting embryos for experiments ... creating human-animal\r\nhybrids ... and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos. Human life\r\nis a gift from our Creator -- and that gift should never be discarded,\r\ndevalued, or put up for sale.\r\n\r\nA hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.\r\nHonorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen\r\nthe ethical standards of Washington -- and I support your efforts. Each\r\nof us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility -- and\r\nthat is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.\r\n\r\nAs we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the\r\ncharacter of America in our compassion and care for one another.\r\n\r\nA hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack\r\ndirection and love. Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we\r\nare encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child --\r\nand this good work is led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. This year we\r\nwill add resources to encourage young people to stay in school -- so\r\nmore of America's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.\r\n\r\nA hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of\r\nsuffering and emergency -- and stays at it until they are back on their\r\nfeet. So far the Federal government has committed 85 billion dollars to\r\nthe people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris,\r\nrepairing highways, and building stronger levees. We are providing\r\nbusiness loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet these immediate\r\nneeds, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the\r\nstorm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow\r\ncitizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer\r\nis not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child ... and\r\njob skills that bring upward mobility ... and more opportunities to own a\r\nhome and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also\r\nwork for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in\r\nhope, and rich in opportunity.\r\n\r\nA hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which\r\ncan be prevented, and treated, and defeated. More than a million\r\nAmericans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among\r\nAfrican-Americans. I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan\r\nWhite Act ... and provide new funding to states, so we end the waiting\r\nlists for AIDS medicine in America. We will also lead a nationwide\r\neffort, working closely with African-American churches and faith-based\r\ngroups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS,\r\nand come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of\r\nconsequence. We have entered a great ideological conflict we did\r\nnothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that\r\nwill influence all our lives. And sometimes it can seem that history is\r\nturning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore.\r\n\r\nYet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every\r\ngreat movement of history comes to a point of choosing. Lincoln could\r\nhave accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery.\r\nMartin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma, and\r\nachieved only half a victory over segregation. The United States could\r\nhave accepted the permanent division of Europe, and been complicit in\r\nthe oppression of others. Today, having come far in our own historical\r\njourney, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?\r\n\r\nBefore history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like\r\nAmericans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well.\r\nWe will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global\r\neconomy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And\r\nso we move forward -- optimistic about our country, faithful to its\r\ncause, and confident of victories to come.\r\n\r\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless America.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nJanuary 23, 2007\r\n\r\nThank you very much. And tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct\r\nhonor of my own -- as the first President to begin the State of the\r\nUnion message with these words: Madam Speaker (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. from\r\nBaltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this\r\nrostrum. But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter,\r\nNancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\n(Applause.) Congratulations, Madam Speaker. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nTwo members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we\r\npray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and\r\nCongressman Charlie Norwood. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMadam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress,\r\ndistinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nThe rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour -- when\r\ndecisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with\r\nlarge endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. In all of\r\nthis, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult\r\nchallenges and determined enemies -- and the wisdom to face them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSome in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate -- and I\r\ncongratulate the Democrat majority. (Applause.) Congress has changed,\r\nbut not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own\r\nconvictions -- and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held\r\nto the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: To\r\nextend this nation's prosperity; to spend the people's money wisely; to\r\nsolve problems, not leave them to future generations; to guard America\r\nagainst all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to\r\ndefend us. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe're not the first to come here with a government divided and\r\nuncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our\r\ndifferences, and achieve big things for the American people. Our\r\ncitizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on -- as long\r\nas we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done.\r\n(Applause.) Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans,\r\nand to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity -- and this\r\nis the business before us tonight.\r\n\r\nA future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy -- and\r\nthat is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job\r\ngrowth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs -- so far.\r\nUnemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This\r\neconomy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with\r\nmore government, but with more enterprise. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nNext week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy.\r\nTonight, I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be\r\npriorities for this Congress.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must balance the federal budget. (Applause.) We can do so\r\nwithout raising taxes. (Applause.) What we need is impose spending\r\ndiscipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in\r\nhalf by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule.\r\n(Applause.) Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will\r\nsubmit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next\r\nfive years. (Applause.) I ask you to make the same commitment.\r\nTogether, we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal\r\ngovernment, and we can balance the federal budget. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nNext, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are\r\noften slipped into bills at the last hour -- when not even C-SPAN is\r\nwatching. (Laughter.) In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to\r\nover 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent\r\nof earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate -- they\r\nare dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill\r\nthat arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign\r\nthem into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law.\r\nThe time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to\r\nreform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and\r\nto a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least\r\nin half by the end of this session. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge\r\nof entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are\r\ncommitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them\r\npermanently sound. Yet, we're failing in that duty. And this failure\r\nwill one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax\r\nincreases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits.\r\nEveryone in this chamber knows this to be true -- yet somehow we have\r\nnot found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it\r\nnow. With enough good sense and goodwill, you and I can fix Medicare\r\nand Medicaid -- and save Social Security. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nSpreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools\r\nthat give children the knowledge and character they need in life. Five\r\nyears ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left\r\nBehind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding\r\nthose schools accountable for results. And because we acted, students\r\nare performing better in reading and math, and minority students are\r\nclosing the achievement gap.\r\n\r\nNow the task is to build on the success, without watering down\r\nstandards, without taking control from local communities, and without\r\nbacksliding and calling it reform. We can lift student achievement even\r\nhigher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing\r\nschools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools\r\nthe right to choose someplace better. (Applause.) We must increase\r\nfunds for students who struggle -- and make sure these children get the\r\nspecial help they need. (Applause.) And we can make sure our children\r\nare prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more\r\ncompetitive by strengthening math and science skills. The No Child Left\r\nBehind Act has worked for America's children -- and I ask Congress to\r\nreauthorize this good law. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nA future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have\r\naffordable and available health care. (Applause.) When it comes to\r\nhealth care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the\r\ndisabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities.\r\nFor all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to\r\nmeet their needs. (Applause.) But many Americans cannot afford a health\r\ninsurance policy.\r\n\r\nAnd so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans\r\nafford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction\r\nfor health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for\r\ndependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income on\r\npayroll tax -- or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single\r\nAmericans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on\r\n$7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men,\r\nwomen, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance\r\nwill benefit from lower tax bills. At the same time, this reform will\r\nlevel the playing field for those who do not get health insurance\r\nthrough their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on\r\ntheir own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings -- $4,500\r\nfor a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of\r\nother Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction\r\nwould help put a basic private health insurance plan within their\r\nreach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making\r\nhealth care affordable for more Americans. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMy second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with\r\ninnovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private\r\nhealth insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal\r\nfunds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I\r\nhave asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with\r\nCongress to take existing federal funds and use them to create\r\n\"Affordable Choices\" grants. These grants would give our nation's\r\ngovernors more money and more flexibility to get private health\r\ninsurance to those most in need.\r\n\r\nThere are many other ways that Congress can help. We need to expand\r\nHealth Savings Accounts. (Applause.) We need to help small businesses\r\nthrough Association Health Plans. (Applause.) We need to reduce costs\r\nand medical errors with better information technology. (Applause.) We\r\nwill encourage price transparency. And to protect good doctors from\r\njunk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. (Applause.) In all\r\nwe do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made\r\nnot by government and insurance companies, but by patients and their\r\ndoctors. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nExtending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration\r\nsystem worthy of America -- with laws that are fair and borders that\r\nare secure. When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms\r\nthe interests of our country. To secure our border, we're doubling the\r\nsize of the Border Patrol, and funding new infrastructure and\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\nYet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless\r\nwe take pressure off the border -- and that requires a temporary worker\r\nprogram. We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign\r\nworkers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. As a result,\r\nthey won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave Border Agents\r\nfree to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists.\r\n(Applause.) We'll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and\r\ngive employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers,\r\nso there's no excuse left for violating the law. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes\r\nand assimilates new arrivals. (Applause.) We need to resolve the status\r\nof the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without\r\nanimosity and without amnesty. (Applause.) Convictions run deep in this\r\nCapitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and\r\nconclusive debate, so that you can pass, and I can sign, comprehensive\r\nimmigration reform into law. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nExtending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy\r\nthat keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean.\r\nFor too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this\r\ndependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to\r\nterrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and\r\nraise the price of oil, and do great harm to our economy.\r\n\r\nIt's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply -- the\r\nway forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way\r\nAmerica generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal\r\ntechnology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power.\r\n(Applause.) We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and\r\nhybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and\r\nbiodiesel fuel. (Applause.) We must continue investing in new methods\r\nof producing ethanol -- (applause) -- using everything from wood chips\r\nto grasses, to agricultural wastes.\r\n\r\nWe made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington\r\nand the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic\r\nadvances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in\r\npursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce\r\ngasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years.\r\n(Applause.) When we do that we will have cut our total imports by the\r\nequivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the\r\nMiddle East.\r\n\r\nTo reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels,\r\nby setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of\r\nrenewable and alternative fuels in 2017 -- and that is nearly five\r\ntimes the current target. (Applause.) At the same time, we need to\r\nreform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for\r\nlight trucks -- and conserve up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline\r\nby 2017.\r\n\r\nAchieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence\r\non foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it. And so as we\r\ncontinue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil\r\nproduction in environmentally sensitive ways. (Applause.) And to\r\nfurther protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I\r\nask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum\r\nReserve. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable\r\nus to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will\r\nhelp us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to\r\nconfront the serious challenge of global climate change. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nA future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of\r\njustice. The lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by\r\nthe outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. We have a shared\r\nobligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear\r\nthose cases and deliver timely rulings. As President, I have a duty to\r\nnominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. And\r\nthe United States Senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a\r\nfair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nFor all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to\r\nprotect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come\r\nand gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the\r\nterrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation.\r\nWe've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know\r\nwith certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a\r\nglimpse of what the terrorists intend for us -- unless we stop them.\r\n\r\nWith the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of\r\nconflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential\r\nwhen a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has\r\nsurely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the\r\nfight to the enemy. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nFrom the start, America and our allies have protected our people by\r\nstaying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable\r\nsanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing\r\ncommunications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has\r\nnever been the same.\r\n\r\nOur success in this war is often measured by the things that did not\r\nhappen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our\r\nallies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We stopped\r\nan al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building\r\non the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming\r\noperatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an al\r\nQaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America.\r\nAnd just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up\r\npassenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each\r\nlife saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who\r\ndevote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nEvery success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless\r\nambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is\r\nstill at work in the world. And so long as that's the case, America is\r\nstill a nation at war.\r\n\r\nIn the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before September the\r\n11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And\r\nthese past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature\r\nof this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists,\r\npossessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take\r\nalmost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite.\r\nThey preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise\r\nparadise for the murder of the innocent.\r\n\r\nOur enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to\r\noverthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to\r\nplan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and\r\nterrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from\r\nthe world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to\r\nimpose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to\r\nthis warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: \"We will sacrifice our\r\nblood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is\r\neven worse.\" Osama bin Laden declared: \"Death is better than living on\r\nthis Earth with the unbelievers among us.\"\r\n\r\nThese men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in\r\nthe Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become\r\nclear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are\r\njust as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the\r\nMiddle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran,\r\nwhich is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah -- a group second\r\nonly to al Qaeda in the American lives it has taken.\r\n\r\nThe Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same\r\ntotalitarian threat. Whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter\r\nthe innocent they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill\r\nAmericans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to\r\nkill on an even more horrific scale.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report\r\nto you that the dangers had ended. They have not. And so it remains the\r\npolicy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of\r\nintelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our\r\nduty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological\r\nstruggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail,\r\nwe must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19\r\nmen to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist\r\nfears most is human freedom\r\n\r\n-- societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to\r\ntheir own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their\r\nresentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant\r\nideologies -- and most will choose a better way when they're given a\r\nchance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates\r\nand reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our\r\nday is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to\r\nbuild free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. And I\r\nsay, for the sake of our own security, we must. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader\r\nMiddle East -- and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction.\r\nIn 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner\r\nof the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose\r\nnew leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan\r\ndefied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in\r\n2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a\r\ntransitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic\r\nconstitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under\r\nthat constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their\r\nmidst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of\r\nhope and solidarity that we should never forget. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nA thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics,\r\nand in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of\r\nPierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution.\r\nHezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict\r\nin the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately\r\nelected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried\r\nto regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In\r\nIraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most\r\nsacred places in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This\r\natrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke\r\nretaliation from Iraqi Shia -- and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements,\r\nsome of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result\r\nwas a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nThis is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in.\r\nEvery one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be\r\nlike us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our\r\nown security at risk. (Applause.) Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at\r\nthis hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this\r\nbattle. Let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq -- a plan that demands more\r\nfrom Iraq's elected government, and gives our forces in Iraq the\r\nreinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a\r\ndemocratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of\r\nits people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror.\r\n\r\nIn order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must\r\nstop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet\r\nready to do this on their own. So we're deploying reinforcements of\r\nmore than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. The vast\r\nmajority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear\r\nand secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army\r\nunits. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by\r\nchasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads.\r\nAnd in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and\r\nlocal forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're\r\nsending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find\r\nthe terrorists and clear them out. (Applause.) We didn't drive al Qaeda\r\nout of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new\r\nsafe haven in a free Iraq.\r\n\r\nThe people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their\r\ngovernment to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not\r\nopen-ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to\r\nsecure Baghdad -- and they must do so. They pledged that they will\r\nconfront violent radicals of any faction or political party -- and they\r\nneed to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and\r\ncoalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing\r\nsecurity to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed\r\nthemselves to a series of benchmarks -- to achieve reconciliation, to\r\nshare oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of\r\nIraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-enter\r\ntheir nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take\r\nresponsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of\r\nthis to happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the\r\nIraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully\r\nweighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end,\r\nI chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for\r\nsuccess. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in\r\nIraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be\r\ngrievous and far-reaching.\r\n\r\nIf American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi\r\ngovernment would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect\r\nan epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni\r\nextremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A\r\ncontagion of violence could spill out across the country -- and in\r\ntime, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.\r\n\r\nFor America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the\r\nobjective. Chaos is the greatest ally -- their greatest ally in this\r\nstruggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy\r\nwith new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater\r\ndetermination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to\r\nignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy. Ladies and\r\ngentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than\r\nfor America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq and to\r\nspare the American people from this danger. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken\r\nwith many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've\r\nmade. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our\r\nconvictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.\r\nOur country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give\r\nit a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field,\r\nand those on their way. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will\r\ncontinue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others.\r\nAnd that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see\r\nthis great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work\r\nin close consultation. It's why I propose to establish a special\r\nadvisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress\r\nfrom both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position\r\nAmerica to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our\r\nenemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks\r\nof our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the\r\nchallenges ahead. (Applause.) Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize\r\nan increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000\r\nin the next five years. (Applause.) A second task we can take on\r\ntogether is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps.\r\nSuch a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would\r\nease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians\r\nwith critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs\r\nthem. It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a\r\nchance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.\r\n\r\nAmericans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because\r\nwe're not in this struggle alone. We have a diplomatic strategy that is\r\nrallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. In Iraq,\r\nmultinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United\r\nNations. We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the\r\nGulf States to increase support for Iraq's government.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran, and made it clear\r\nthat the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear\r\nweapons. (Applause.) With the other members of the Quartet -- the U.N.,\r\nthe European Union, and Russia -- we're pursuing diplomacy to help\r\nbring peace to the Holy Land, and pursuing the establishment of a\r\ndemocratic Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel in peace\r\nand security. (Applause.) In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in\r\nturning back the Taliban and al Qaeda offensive -- the first time the\r\nAlliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area. Together\r\nwith our partners in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, we're\r\npursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of\r\nnuclear weapons. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like\r\nCuba, Belarus, and Burma [1] -- and continue to awaken the conscience\r\nof the world to save the people of Darfur. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerican foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our\r\nwork in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is\r\ngiven, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of\r\nhunger and poverty and disease -- and that is precisely what America is\r\ndoing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent\r\nof Africa. (Applause.) Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS\r\nRelief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from\r\n50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue\r\nfunding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2\r\nbillion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 African\r\ncountries. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nI ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American\r\naid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on\r\nthe rise and corruption is in retreat. And let us continue to support\r\nthe expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting\r\nlives and eliminating poverty. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWhen America serves others in this way, we show the strength and\r\ngenerosity of our country. These deeds reflect the character of our\r\npeople. The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage,\r\nand self-sacrifice of the American people. You see this spirit often if\r\nyou know where to look -- and tonight we need only look above to the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nDikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He\r\ncame to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine -- but\r\nCoach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea.\r\n(Laughter.) Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the\r\nUnited States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty\r\nto share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in\r\nhis old hometown. A friend has said of this good-hearted man: \"Mutombo\r\nbelieves that God has given him this opportunity to do great things.\"\r\nAnd we are proud to call this son of the Congo [2] a citizen of the\r\nUnited States of America. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAfter her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to\r\nshare her love of music and art with her child. So she borrowed some\r\nequipment, and began filming children's videos in her basement. The\r\nBaby Einstein Company was born, and in just five years her business\r\ngrew to more than $20 million in sales. In November 2001, Julie sold\r\nBaby Einstein to the Walt Disney Company, and with her help Baby\r\nEinstein has grown into a $200 million business. Julie represents the\r\ngreat enterprising spirit of America. And she is using her success to\r\nhelp others -- producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the\r\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Julie says of her\r\nnew project: \"I believe it's the most important thing that I have ever\r\ndone. I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is\r\nsafe.\" And so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business\r\nentrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur -- Julie Aigner-Clark.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nThree weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station\r\nwith his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a\r\ntrain. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the\r\nman into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed\r\nright above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: \"We got\r\nguys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got\r\nto show each other some love.\" There is something wonderful about a\r\ncountry that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nTommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when\r\nhe enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a\r\nreconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy\r\nfire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body\r\nas a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm,\r\nand received shrapnel wounds to his legs -- yet he refused medical\r\nattention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack,\r\nfiring grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage,\r\nSergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other\r\nAmericans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect\r\nand the gratitude of our entire country. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit\r\nand character of America -- and these qualities are not in short\r\nsupply. This is a decent and honorable country -- and resilient, too.\r\nWe've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced\r\ndangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with\r\nconfidence -- because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in\r\nthe world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. God bless.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nSee you next year. Thank you for your prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge W. Bush\r\nJanuary 28, 2008\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of\r\nCongress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Seven years have\r\npassed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In that time,\r\nour country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We\r\nfaced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the\r\nworld economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues\r\ncall for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say we've answered\r\nthe call. Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted\r\nwith purpose. And together, we showed the world the power and\r\nresilience of American self-government.\r\n\r\nAll of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business.\r\nThat is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It\r\nremains our charge to keep.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and\r\nprosperity of our nation long after this session has ended. In this\r\nelection year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our\r\nresponsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them that\r\nRepublicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for\r\nresults at the same time. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nFrom expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good\r\nprogress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American\r\npeople expect us to get it done.\r\n\r\nIn the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our\r\nnation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to\r\ndetermine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe\r\nthat the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom\r\nof ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability\r\nof free peoples to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve\r\ntheir lives for their futures.\r\n\r\nTo build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money\r\nand empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy\r\nis undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a\r\nrecord 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace.\r\nWages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising,\r\nbut the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our\r\ncountry, there is a concern about our economic future.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth.\r\nBut in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. So\r\nlast week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and\r\nRepublican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax\r\nrelief for individuals and families and incentives for business\r\ninvestment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would\r\ndelay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. (Applause.)\r\nThis is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our\r\npeople working. And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the\r\ntax relief we've delivered over the past seven years will be taken\r\naway. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a\r\ntax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who\r\nwould see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said\r\nthey would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their\r\nenthusiasm. I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and\r\nmoney orders. (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\r\nMost Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other\r\npressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry\r\nabout their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their\r\npaychecks. There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the\r\ntax relief permanent. (Applause.) And members of Congress should know:\r\nIf any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nJust as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their\r\ntrust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I'll send you a\r\nbudget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated\r\nprograms, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that I will submit\r\nwill keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families\r\nhave to balance their budgets; so should their government. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional\r\nearmarks -- special interest projects that are often snuck in at the\r\nlast minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to\r\nvoluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked\r\nyou to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even\r\ncome to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if\r\nyou send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and\r\ncost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd tomorrow, I will issue an executive order that directs federal\r\nagencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress.\r\nIf these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in\r\nthe open and hold a public vote. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and\r\nspending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility\r\nof homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the\r\nhousing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW\r\nalliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid\r\nforeclosure. And Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass\r\nlegislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal\r\nHousing Administration, and allow state housing agencies to issue\r\ntax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages.\r\n(Applause.) These are difficult times for many American families, and\r\nby taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.\r\n\r\nTo build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and\r\ndoctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better\r\ninformation and better options. We share a common goal: making health\r\ncare more affordable and accessible for all Americans. (Applause.) The\r\nbest way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not\r\ngovernment control. (Applause.) So I have proposed ending the bias in\r\nthe tax code against those who do not get their health insurance\r\nthrough their employer. This one reform would put private coverage\r\nwithin reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this\r\nyear. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create\r\nAssociation Health Plans for small businesses, promote health\r\ninformation technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical\r\nlawsuits. (Applause.) With all these steps, we will help ensure that\r\ndecisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your\r\ndoctor's office -- not in the halls of Congress. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOn education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance, and\r\nempower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods\r\nacross our country, there are boys and girls with dreams -- and a\r\ndecent education is their only hope of achieving them.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act,\r\nand today no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth\r\ngraders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are\r\non the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted all-time\r\nhighs. (Applause.) Now we must work together to increase\r\naccountability, add flexibility for states and districts, reduce the\r\nnumber of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nMembers of Congress: The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan\r\nachievement. It is succeeding. And we owe it to America's children,\r\ntheir parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure\r\nup. Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than\r\n2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's Capital have found new\r\nhope at a faith-based or other non-public school. Sadly, these schools\r\nare disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities.\r\nSo I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these\r\nlifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more\r\nchildren, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell\r\nGrants for Kids. We have seen how Pell Grants help low-income college\r\nstudents realize their full potential. Together, we've expanded the\r\nsize and reach of these grants. Now let us apply that same spirit to\r\nhelp liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nOn trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the\r\nworld and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our\r\neconomic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American\r\ngoods and crops and services all over the world. So we're working to\r\nbreak down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We're\r\nworking for a successful Doha Round of trade talks, and we must\r\ncomplete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we're pursuing\r\nopportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements.\r\n\r\nI thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now\r\nI ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South\r\nKorea. (Applause.) Many products from these nations now enter America\r\nduty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their\r\nmarkets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give\r\nus better access to nearly 100 million customers. They will support\r\ngood jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose products say\r\n\"Made in the USA.\" (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThese agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first\r\nagreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of\r\nAmerica that is confronting violence and terror, and fighting drug\r\ntraffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the\r\npurveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come\r\ntogether, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region\r\nthat democracy leads to a better life. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nTrade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for\r\nsome Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government\r\nhas a responsibility to help. (Applause.) I ask Congress to reauthorize\r\nand reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced\r\nworkers learn new skills and find new jobs. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nTo build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative\r\ngenius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to\r\npioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. (Applause.) Our\r\nsecurity, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our\r\ndependence on oil. Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce\r\noil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together we\r\nshould take the next steps: Let us fund new technologies that can\r\ngenerate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. (Applause.) Let\r\nus increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear\r\npower. (Applause.) Let us continue investing in advanced battery\r\ntechnology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the\r\nfuture. (Applause.) Let us create a new international clean technology\r\nfund, which will help developing nations like India and China make\r\ngreater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an\r\ninternational agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and\r\neventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by\r\nevery major economy and gives none a free ride. (Applause.) The United\r\nStates is committed to strengthening our energy security and\r\nconfronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals\r\nis for America to continue leading the way toward the development of\r\ncleaner and more energy-efficient technology. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nTo keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill\r\nof our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the\r\nbreakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation\r\nsupporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed\r\nthrough with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our\r\nscientific edge. So I ask Congress to double federal support for\r\ncritical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America\r\nremains the most dynamic nation on Earth. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOn matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit\r\nof medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments\r\nwhile respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark\r\nachievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin\r\ncells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the\r\npotential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by\r\nextending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human\r\nlife. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nSo we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research.\r\nAnd as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure\r\nthat all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. And so I call on\r\nCongress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the\r\nbuying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOn matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and\r\nempower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says.\r\n(Applause.) I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the\r\nletter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees\r\nare being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the\r\nSenate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the\r\nAmerican people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over\r\nthe past seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that\r\nthe pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have\r\nvolunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than\r\never. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with\r\nnewfound support from the federal government. And to help guarantee\r\nequal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for\r\nfederal funds, I ask you to permanently extend Charitable Choice.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nTonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the\r\nGulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of\r\nthis region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and\r\nbetter than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April\r\nwe will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and\r\nthe United States in the great city of New Orleans. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThere are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly\r\nbefore this body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement\r\nspending and immigration. Every member in this chamber knows that\r\nspending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and\r\nMedicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful\r\nchoices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases,\r\nsudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I've laid\r\nout proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask members of Congress\r\nto offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save\r\nthese vital programs for our children and our grandchildren. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure\r\nour borders -- and with your help, my administration is taking steps to\r\ndo so. We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and\r\nadvanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We've effectively\r\nended the policy of \"catch and release\" at the border, and by the end\r\nof this year, we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents.\r\nYet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our\r\nborder until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here\r\nand support our economy. (Applause.) This will take pressure off the\r\nborder and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us\r\nharm. We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people\r\nhere illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be\r\nresolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws\r\nand our highest ideals. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThis is the business of our nation here at home. Yet building a\r\nprosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies\r\nabroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people,\r\nwhen given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In\r\nthe last seven years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history\r\nof liberty. We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for\r\ntheir right to free and fair elections. We've seen people in Lebanon\r\ntake to the streets to demand their independence. We've seen Afghans\r\nemerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new president and a\r\nnew parliament. We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained\r\nfingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have\r\ninspired us. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn the past seven years, we've also seen images that have sobered us.\r\nWe've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the\r\ncaskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand. We've seen\r\nwedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in\r\nJordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains\r\nin London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day,\r\nwe saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant.\r\nThese horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty\r\nis opposed by terrorists and extremists -- evil men who despise\r\nfreedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nSince 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists.\r\nWe will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will\r\ndeliver justice to our enemies. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st\r\ncentury. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency\r\nthat we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and\r\nour enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to\r\ndetermine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in\r\ntyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this\r\nchoice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the\r\nPalestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America\r\nand the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are\r\nhelping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their\r\ncountry. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian\r\npersonnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al Qaeda is now a\r\nyoung democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and\r\nhospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with\r\nnew hope. These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 Marines\r\nto our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and\r\ntrain the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and al Qaeda is\r\ncritical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting\r\nAmerica's vital mission in Afghanistan. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud\r\npeople their liberty, and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks\r\nacross the world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their\r\nefforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and\r\nchanged course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We\r\ngave our troops a new mission: Work with the Iraqi forces to protect\r\nthe Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the\r\nterrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened.\r\nThose who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them\r\ninstead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their\r\ncountry. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out\r\nthe terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return.\r\nAnd they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams\r\nthat include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public\r\nservants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by\r\nimprovements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are\r\nperforming with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of\r\nour whole nation. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni\r\ntribal leaders grew tired of al Qaeda's brutality and started a popular\r\nuprising called \"The Anbar Awakening.\" Over the past year, similar\r\nmovements have spread across the country. And today, the grassroots\r\nsurge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the\r\nterrorists. The government in Baghdad has stepped forward, as well --\r\nadding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhile the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American\r\nand Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined\r\njust one year ago. (Applause.) When we met last year, many said that\r\ncontaining the violence was impossible. A year later, high profile\r\nterrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian\r\nkillings are down.\r\n\r\nWhen we met last year, militia extremists -- some armed and trained by\r\nIran -- were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later,\r\ncoalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia\r\nfighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that\r\ndefeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen we met last year, al Qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq,\r\nand their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of\r\nthe country. Today, it is al Qaeda that is searching for safe passage.\r\nThey have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held, and\r\nover the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in\r\nIraq, including hundreds of key al Qaeda leaders and operatives.\r\n\r\nLast month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against\r\nIraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al Qaeda and admitted that\r\ncoalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen,\r\nsome may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is\r\nno doubt. Al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be\r\ndefeated. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWhen we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise.\r\nToday, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a\r\npolicy of \"return on success,\" and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are\r\nbeginning to come home.\r\n\r\nThis progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance\r\nof their commanders. This evening, I want to speak directly to our men\r\nand women on the front lines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, Marines,\r\nand Coast Guardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've\r\nasked of you, and more. Our nation is grateful for your courage. We are\r\nproud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed chamber,\r\nwith the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge:\r\nIn the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our nation.\r\n(Applause.) And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these\r\nbrave men and women by fully funding our troops. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and\r\nwe can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming\r\nyear is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while\r\ntransitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are\r\nshifting from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and,\r\neventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this\r\ntransition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine Expeditionary\r\nUnit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming\r\nmonths, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow\r\nsuit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are\r\ncoming home. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAny further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq\r\nand the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned\r\nthat too fast a drawdown could result in the \"disintegration of the\r\nIraqi security forces, al Qaeda-Iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a\r\nmarked increase in violence.\" Members of Congress: Having come so far\r\nand achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nIn the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on\r\nthe progress they're making toward political reconciliation. At the\r\nlocal level, Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds are beginning to come together to\r\nreclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the\r\nprovinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. (Applause.) We're\r\nseeing some encouraging signs. The national government is sharing oil\r\nrevenues with the provinces. The parliament recently passed both a\r\npension law and de-Baathification reform. They're now debating a\r\nprovincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But\r\nafter decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence,\r\nreconciliation is taking place -- and the Iraqi people are taking\r\ncontrol of their future. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. But\r\nit is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A\r\nfree Iraq will deny al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will show\r\nmillions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A\r\nfree Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror,\r\nand a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen\r\nIran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on\r\nour friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its\r\nintentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, al\r\nQaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until\r\nthey have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans: We will\r\nnot rest either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated.\r\n(Applause.) We must do the difficult work today, so that years from now\r\npeople will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment,\r\nprevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a\r\nsafer America. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land,\r\nwhere we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a president\r\nwho recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a\r\nstate where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel.\r\nIsraelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic\r\nPalestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in\r\nRamallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America\r\nwill do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace\r\nagreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The\r\ntime has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a\r\ndemocratic Palestine live side-by-side in peace. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nWe're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the\r\nregime in Tehran. Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people. And\r\nwherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian\r\nregime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia\r\ngroups in Iraq, supporting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing\r\nHamas' efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also\r\ndeveloping ballistic missiles of increasing range, and continues to\r\ndevelop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create\r\na nuclear weapon.\r\n\r\nOur message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with\r\nyou. We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to\r\nthe day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran\r\nis also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so\r\nnegotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come\r\nclean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your\r\noppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. But above\r\nall, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops. We\r\nwill stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the\r\nPersian Gulf. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOn the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective\r\nmeasure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are\r\ngrateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11.\r\nThis is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy.\r\nIn the past six years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot\r\nto fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to\r\nblow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated\r\nmen and women in our government toil day and night to stop the\r\nterrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are\r\nsaving American lives, and everyone in this chamber owes them our\r\nthanks. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAnd we owe them something more: We owe them the tools they need to keep\r\nour people safe. And one of the most important tools we can give them\r\nis the ability to monitor terrorist communications. To protect America,\r\nwe need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are\r\nsaying, and what they're planning. Last year, Congress passed\r\nlegislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the\r\nlegislation to expire on February the 1st. That means if you don't act\r\nby Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and\r\nour citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow\r\nof vital intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability\r\nprotection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to\r\ndefend America. We've had ample time for debate. The time to act is\r\nnow. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nProtecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more\r\nthan good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing\r\nthe conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on\r\ndespair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more\r\nhopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our\r\nnational interest; it is the calling of our conscience.\r\n\r\nAmerica opposes genocide in Sudan. (Applause.) We support freedom in\r\ncountries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong\r\neducation initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We've also changed\r\nthe way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account.\r\nThis program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law\r\nin developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important\r\ninitiative. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than\r\nhalf the world's food aid comes from the United States. And tonight, I\r\nask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food\r\nassistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing\r\nworld, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of\r\nfamine. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we're\r\nworking to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15\r\nAfrican nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4\r\nmillion people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask\r\nyou to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this\r\nprogram a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment\r\nto fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the\r\nnext five years. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nAmerica is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate\r\npeople, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have\r\nstepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have\r\nrisked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over\r\nthe past seven years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than\r\n95 percent. And as we increase funding -- (applause.) And as increase\r\nfunding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a\r\nnew war and a new generation. (Applause.) I call on the Congress to\r\nenact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna\r\nShalala, so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors\r\nand help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nOur military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless\r\nnights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved\r\none is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for\r\nthem. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care,\r\ncreating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal\r\ngovernment, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education\r\nbenefits to their spouses or children. (Applause.) Our military\r\nfamilies serve our nation, they inspire our nation, and tonight our\r\nnation honors them. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe strength -- the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is\r\nthat our greatness lies not in our government, but in the spirit and\r\ndetermination of our people. (Applause.) When the Federal Convention\r\nmet in Philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the Articles of\r\nConfederation, which began with the words, \"We the undersigned\r\ndelegates.\" When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft a preamble to our\r\nnew Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with\r\nwords that changed the course of our nation and the history of the\r\nworld: \"We the people.\"\r\n\r\nBy trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble\r\nnation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all\r\nmen and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations\r\ntransformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation\r\non Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue\r\nto trust the people, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be\r\nsecure, and the state of our Union will remain strong. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nSo tonight, with confidence in freedom's power, and trust in the\r\npeople, let us set forth to do their business. God bless America.\r\n(Applause.)",
