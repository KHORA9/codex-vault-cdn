While events of such\r\nmagnitude are passing before his eyes, a man who did not forget himself\r\nwould deserve to be for ever forgotten. I have thought of nothing but\r\nthe situation of my country. The more I reflect upon that, the more I am\r\nconvinced that the evil which lies at the root of all her evils, which\r\nundermines and destroys her governments and her liberties, her dignity\r\nand her happiness, is the evil which I attack;--the idolatry of\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nWhether the accession of M. Louis Napoléon Bonaparte to the Presidency\r\nof the Republic will be found an efficacious remedy for this disease,\r\nthe future will show. What I have said here after the election of M.\r\nLouis Napoléon Bonaparte, I should have equally said, without the\r\nslightest alteration, if General Cavaignac had been elected. It is not\r\nto individuals, but to society itself, that great social truths are\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE PREVALENT EVIL?                              1\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT\r\nTO DEMOCRACY?                                                          7\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC                                            15\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE SOCIAL REPUBLIC                                                25\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE REAL AND ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF\r\nSOCIETY IN FRANCE?                                                    36\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PEACE IN FRANCE                        56\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMORAL CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PEACE IN FRANCE                            70\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION                                                            84\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE PREVALENT EVIL?\r\n\r\n\r\nMirabeau, Barnave, Napoleon, and Lafayette, who died at distant and very\r\ndissimilar periods, in bed or on the scaffold, in their own country or\r\nin exile, all died under the influence of one sentiment--a sentiment of\r\nprofound melancholy. They thought their hopes deceived, their labours\r\nabortive. They were assailed by doubts of the success of their cause,\r\nand by misgivings as to the future.\r\n\r\nKing Louis-Philippe reigned above seventeen years, for more than eleven\r\nof which I had the honour to be his minister. If to-morrow it pleased\r\nGod to summon us into his presence, should we quit this earth very\r\nconfident in the future destiny and the constitutional order of our\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nIs then the French Revolution destined to give birth only to doubt and\r\ndeception?--to bury all its triumphs under ruins?\r\n\r\nYes: so long as France shall suffer the true and the false, the upright\r\nand the perverse, the practicable and the chimerical, the salutary and\r\nthe pestilent to be constantly mingled and confounded in her opinions,\r\nher institutions, and the government of her affairs, such will be the\r\nunfailing and inevitable result.\r\n\r\nUntil a people which has gone through a great revolution has passed on\r\nthe principles, the passions, and the doctrines which have led to this\r\nrevolution, a sentence like that which shall be passed on all human\r\nthings at the Last Day, “severing the wheat from the tares, and the corn\r\nfrom the straw that shall be cast into the fire,” it can never surmount\r\nthe perils, nor reap the advantages, of the struggle in which it has\r\nbeen engaged.\r\n\r\nSo long as this judgment is deferred, chaos reigns; and chaos, if\r\nprolonged in the midst of a people, would be death.\r\n\r\nChaos is now concealed under one word--Democracy.\r\n\r\nThis is now the sovereign and universal word which all parties invoke,\r\nall seek to appropriate as a talisman.\r\n\r\nThe Monarchists say, “Our Monarchy is a Democratic Monarchy: therefore\r\nit differs essentially from the ancient Monarchy, and is adapted to the\r\nmodern condition of society.”\r\n\r\nThe Republicans say, “The Republic is Democracy governing itself. This\r\nis the only form of government in harmony with a democratic society, its\r\nprinciples, its sentiments, and its interests.”\r\n\r\nSocialists, Communists, and Montagnards require that the republic should\r\nbe a pure and absolute democracy. This, in their estimation, is the\r\ncondition of its legitimacy.\r\n\r\nSuch is the power of the word Democracy, that no government or party\r\ndares to raise its head, or believes its own existence possible, if it\r\ndoes not bear that word inscribed on its banner; and those who carry\r\nthat banner aloft with the greatest ostentation and to the extremest\r\nlimits, believe themselves to be stronger than all the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFatal idea, which incessantly excites and foments social war amongst us!\r\nThis idea must be extirpated; for on its extirpation depends social\r\npeace, and, in her train, liberty, security, prosperity, dignity, all\r\nthe benefits, material or moral, which social peace alone can ensure.\r\n\r\nThe following are the causes to which the word _democracy_ owes its\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt is the banner of all the social hopes and ambitions of man,--pure or\r\nimpure, noble or base, rational or irrational, possible or chimerical.\r\n\r\nNow it is the glory of man to be ambitious. He alone, of all created\r\nbeings, does not passively resign himself to evil; he alone incessantly\r\naspires after good; not only for himself, but for his fellow-creatures.\r\nHe respects and loves the race to which he belongs; he wishes to find a\r\nremedy for their miseries, and redress for their wrongs.\r\n\r\nBut man is no less imperfect than he is ambitious. Amidst his ardent and\r\nunceasing struggles to eradicate evil and to achieve good, every one of\r\nhis virtuous inclinations is accompanied by an evil inclination which\r\ntreads closely on its heels, or strives with it for precedence. The\r\ndesire for justice and the desire for vengeance--the spirit of liberty\r\nand the spirit of tyranny--the wish to rise and the wish to abase what\r\nhas risen--the ardent love of truth and the presumptuous temerity of\r\nfancied knowledge;--we may fathom all the depths of human nature; we\r\nshall find throughout, the same mingled yet conflicting qualities, the\r\nsame danger from their close and easy approximation.\r\n\r\nTo all these instincts, at once contrary and parallel,--to all\r\nindiscriminately, the bad as well as the good,--the word _Democracy_\r\nholds out an interminable vista and infinite promises. It fosters every\r\npropensity, it speaks to every passion, of the heart of man; to the most\r\ngenerous and the most shameful, the most moral and the most immoral, the\r\ngentlest and the harshest, the most beneficent and the most\r\ndestructive: to the former it loudly offers, to the latter it secretly\r\nand dimly promises, satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSuch is the secret of its power.\r\n\r\nI am wrong in saying, the secret. The word _Democracy_ is not new, and\r\nin all ages it has signified what it signifies now. But what is new and\r\nproper to our times is this: the word _Democracy_ is now pronounced\r\nevery day, every hour, and in every place; and at every time and place\r\nit is heard by all men. This formidable appeal to all that is most\r\npotent, for good and for evil, in man and in society, was formerly heard\r\nonly transiently, locally, and among certain classes, which, though\r\nbound to other classes by the ties of a common country, were distinct\r\nand profoundly different from them. They lived at a distance from each\r\nother; each obscurely known to the other. Now there is but one society;\r\nand in this society there are no more lofty barriers, no more great\r\ndistances, no more mutual obscurities. Whether it be false or true,\r\nnoxious or salutary, when once a social idea arises, it penetrates\r\neverywhere, and its action is universal and constant. It is a torch that\r\nis never extinguished; a voice that is never wearied or hushed.\r\nUniversality and publicity are from henceforth the conditions of all the\r\ngreat provocations addressed to men,--of all the great impulses given to\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless one of those absolute and sovereign facts which enter\r\ninto the designs of God with regard to mankind.\r\n\r\nSuch being the fact, the empire of the word _Democracy_ is not\r\nto be regarded as a transitory or local accident. It is the\r\ndevelopment--others would say the explosion--of all the elements of\r\nhuman nature throughout all the ranks and all the depths of society; and\r\nconsequently the open, general, continuous, inevitable struggle of its\r\ngood and evil instincts; of its virtues and its vices; of all its powers\r\nand faculties, whether to improve or to corrupt, to raise or to abase,\r\nto create or to destroy. Such is, from henceforth, the social state, the\r\npermanent condition of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO DEMOCRACY?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are men whom this fearful struggle does not alarm: they have full\r\nconfidence in human nature. According to them, if left to itself, its\r\nprogress is towards good: all the evils of society arise from\r\ngovernments which debase men by violence or corrupt them by fraud:\r\nliberty--liberty for everybody and everything--liberty will almost\r\nalways suffice to enlighten or to control the wills of men, to prevent\r\nevil or to cure it: a little government--the least possible--may be\r\nallowed for the repression of extreme disorder and the control of brute\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nOthers have a more summary way of disposing of all dread of the triumph\r\nof evil in man or in society. There is, they say, no such thing as\r\nnatural and necessary evil, since no human inclination is bad in itself;\r\nit becomes so, only when it does not attain the end after which it\r\naspires--it is a torrent which overflows its banks when obstructed. If\r\nsociety were organized in such a manner that each of the instincts of\r\nman found its proper place and received its due satisfaction, evil would\r\ndisappear, strife would cease, and all the various forces of humanity,\r\nharmoniously combine to produce social order.\r\n\r\nThe former of these speculators misunderstand man; the latter\r\nmisunderstand man, and deny God.\r\n\r\nLet any man dive into his own heart and observe himself with attention.\r\nIf he have the power to look, and the will to see, he will behold, with\r\na sort of terror, the incessant war waged by the good and evil\r\ndispositions within him--reason and caprice, duty and passion; in short,\r\nto call them all by their comprehensive names, good and evil. We\r\ncontemplate with anxiety the outward troubles and vicissitudes of human\r\nlife; but what should we feel if we could behold the inward\r\nvicissitudes, the troubles of the human soul?--if we could see how many\r\ndangers, snares, enemies, combats, victories, and defeats can be crowded\r\ninto a day--an hour? I do not say this to discourage man, nor to humble\r\nor under-value his free will. He is called upon to conquer in the battle\r\nof life, and the honour of the conquest belongs to his free will. But\r\nvictory is impossible, and defeat certain, if he has not a just\r\nconception and a profound feeling of his dangers, his weaknesses, and\r\nhis need of assistance. To believe that the free will of man tends to\r\ngood, and is of itself sufficient to accomplish good, betrays an\r\nimmeasurable ignorance of his nature. It is the error of pride; an error\r\nwhich tends to destroy both moral and political order; which enfeebles\r\nthe government of communities no less than the government of the inward\r\nman.\r\n\r\nFor the struggle is the same, the peril as imminent, the aid as\r\nnecessary, in society as in the individual man. Many of those now living\r\nhave been doomed to see, several times in the course of their lives, the\r\nsocial edifice tottering to its fall, and all the props that should\r\nuphold, all the bonds that should unite it, failing. Over what an\r\nimmense extent, and with what fearful rapidity, have all the causes of\r\nsocial war and social destruction, which are always fermenting in the\r\nmidst of us, each time burst forth! Which of us has not shuddered at the\r\nsudden discovery of the abyss over which we live--the frail barriers\r\nwhich separate us from it, and the destructive legions ready to rush\r\nforth upon society as soon as its jaws are unclosed? For my own part, I\r\nwas a spectator, day by day, hour by hour, of the purest, the wisest,\r\nthe gentlest, and the shortest of these formidable convulsions; in July,\r\n1830, I saw, in the streets and the palaces, at the gate of the national\r\ncouncils and in the midst of popular assemblies, society abandoned to\r\nitself, an actor or spectator of the revolution. And at the same time\r\nthat I admired the generous sentiments, the proofs of strong\r\nintelligence and disinterested virtue and heroic moderation which I\r\nwitnessed, I shuddered as I saw a mighty torrent of insensate ideas,\r\nbrutal passions, perverse inclinations, and terrible chimeras, rise and\r\nswell, minute by minute, ready to overflow, and submerge a land where\r\nall the dikes that had contained it were broken down. Society had\r\ngloriously repulsed the violation of its laws and its honour, and now it\r\nwas on the point of falling into ruins in the midst of its glory. Here\r\nit was that I learned the vital conditions of social order, and the\r\nnecessity of resistance to ensure the safety of the social fabric.\r\n\r\nResistance not only to evil, but to the principle of evil; not only to\r\ndisorder, but to the passions and the ideas which engender\r\ndisorder--this is the paramount and peremptory duty of every government.\r\nAnd the greater the empire of Democracy, the more important is it that\r\ngovernment should hold fast to its true character, and act its true part\r\nin the struggle which agitates society. Why is it that so many\r\ndemocracies--some of them very brilliant--have so rapidly perished?\r\nBecause they would not suffer their governments to do their duty, and\r\nfulfil the objects for which governments are instituted. They did more\r\nthan reduce them to weakness; they condemned them to falsehood. It is\r\nthe melancholy condition of democratic governments, that while\r\ncharged--as they must be--with the repression of disorder, they are\r\nrequired to be complaisant and indulgent to the causes of disorder; they\r\nare expected to arrest the evil when it breaks out, and yet they are\r\nasked to foster it whilst it is hatching. I know no more deplorable\r\nspectacle than a power which, in the struggle between the good and the\r\nevil principle, continually bends the knee before the bad, and then\r\nattempts to resume an attitude of vigour and independence when it\r\nbecomes necessary to resist its excesses. If you will not have excesses,\r\nyou must repress them in their origin. If you wish for liberty--for the\r\nfull and glorious development of human nature--learn first on what\r\nconditions this is attainable; look forward to its consequences. Do not\r\nblind yourselves to the perils and the combats it will occasion. And\r\nwhen these combats and these perils arise, do not require your leaders\r\nto be hypocritical or weak in their dealings with the enemy. Do not\r\nforce upon them the worship of idols, even were you yourselves those\r\nidols. Permit them, nay command them, to worship and to serve the true\r\nGod alone.\r\n\r\nI might here allow myself the satisfaction of recalling the names of all\r\nthe rulers who have fallen shamefully because they submitted basely to\r\nbe the slaves or the tools of the errors and passions of the democracies\r\nit was their duty and their vocation to govern; but I had rather dwell\r\non the memory of those who lived gloriously by resisting them. It is\r\nmore to my taste to prove the truth by examples of the success which\r\ncrowns wisdom, than by those of the disasters which attend on folly.\r\n\r\nDemocratic France owes much to the Emperor Napoleon. He gave her two\r\nthings of immense value: within, civil order strongly constituted;\r\nwithout, national independence firmly established. But had she ever a\r\ngovernment which treated her with greater severity, or showed less\r\ncomplaisance for the favourite passions of Democracy? As to the\r\npolitical constitution of the state, Napoleon’s only care was to raise\r\npower from the abasement into which it had fallen, to restore to it all\r\nthe conditions of force and greatness. In this he saw a national\r\ninterest paramount to all others, whether the nation were governed\r\ndemocratically or otherwise.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon was a despot. If he rightly understood and ably served some\r\nof the great interests of that new France he had to govern, he\r\nprofoundly misunderstood and injured others, not less sacred. How was it\r\npossible that one so hostile to liberty should be favourable to the\r\npolitical propensities of Democracy?\r\n\r\nI shall not contest this. I run no risk of forgetting that Napoleon was\r\na despot, for I have not to learn it now--I thought so when he was\r\nliving. It may, however, be asked whether he could have been otherwise?\r\nwhether he could have tolerated political liberty, and whether we were\r\nthen in a state to receive it? I shall not attempt to decide these\r\nquestions. There are men, and very great men, who are suited to certain\r\ndiseased and transitory crises, and not to the sane and permanent state,\r\nof society. Napoleon was, perhaps, one of those men. That he mistook\r\nsome of the essential wants of our time, nobody is more convinced than I\r\nam. But he re-established order and authority in the midst of democratic\r\nFrance. He believed, and he proved, that it was possible to serve and to\r\ngovern a democratic society without humouring all its inclinations. This\r\nis his real greatness.\r\n\r\nWashington has no resemblance to Napoleon. He was not a despot. He\r\nfounded the political liberty, at the same time as the national\r\nindependence, of his country. He used war only as a means to peace.\r\nRaised to the supreme power without ambition, he descended from it\r\nwithout regret, as soon as the safety of his country permitted. He is\r\nthe model for all democratic chiefs. Now you have only to examine his\r\nlife, his soul, his acts, his thoughts, his words; you will not find a\r\nsingle mark of condescension, a single moment of indulgence, for the\r\nfavourite ideas of Democracy. He constantly struggled--struggled even to\r\nweariness and to sadness--against its exactions. No man was ever more\r\nprofoundly imbued with the spirit of government, or with respect for\r\nauthority. He never exceeded the rights of power, according to the laws\r\nof his country; but he confirmed and maintained them, in principle as\r\nwell as in practice, as firmly, as loftily, as he could have done in an\r\nold monarchical or aristocratical state. He was one of those who knew\r\nthat it is no more possible to govern from below in a republic than in a\r\nmonarchy--in a democratic than in an aristocratic society.\r\n\r\nDemocratic societies enjoy no privilege which renders the spirit of\r\ngovernment less necessary in them than in others; no privilege which\r\nrenders their vital conditions different or inferior to those required\r\nelsewhere. By an infallible consequence of the struggle which infallibly\r\narises in such societies, the possessor of power is continually called\r\non to decide between the contrary impulses by which he is solicited to\r\nmake himself the artisan of good or the accomplice of evil, the champion\r\nof order or the slave of disorder. The mythic story of the choice of\r\nHercules is the daily and hourly history of his life. Every government,\r\nwhatever be its form or its name, which, by the vice of its organization\r\nor situation, or by the corruption or feebleness of its will, cannot\r\nfulfil this inevitable task, will speedily pass away like an evil\r\nphantom, or will ruin the democracy it affects to establish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not speak of the republican form of government otherwise than\r\nwith respect. Considered in itself, it is a noble form of government. It\r\nhas called forth great virtues; it has presided over the destiny and the\r\nglory of great nations.\r\n\r\nBut a republican government has the same vocation, the same duties, as\r\nany other government. Its name gives it no claim to dispensation or\r\nprivilege. It must satisfy both the general and permanent wants of human\r\nsociety, and the particular wants of the particular community which it\r\nis called to govern.\r\n\r\nThe permanent want of every community,--the first and most imperious\r\nwant of France at the present day,--is, peace in the bosom of society\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said about unity and social fraternity. These are\r\nsublime words, but they ought not to make us forget facts. Nothing has a\r\nmore certain tendency to ruin a people than a habit of accepting words\r\nand appearances as realities. Whilst the shouts of unity and fraternity\r\nresound among us, they are responded to by social war, flagrant or\r\nimminent, terrible from the evils it causes, or from those it seems\r\nlikely to cause.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on this grievous wound. Yet in order to cure, we ought\r\nto touch, and even to probe it. It is an old wound. The history of\r\nFrance is filled with the struggle between the different classes of\r\nsociety, of which the Revolution of 1789 was the most general and mighty\r\nexplosion. The contests between nobility and commonalty, aristocracy and\r\ndemocracy, masters and workmen, those possessing property and those\r\ndependent on wages, are all different forms and phases of the social\r\nstruggle which has so long agitated France. And it is at the very moment\r\nwhen we are boasting of having reached the summit of civilization--it is\r\nwhile the most humane words that can issue from the lips of man are\r\nringing in our ears, that this struggle is revived more violently, more\r\nfiercely than ever!\r\n\r\nThis is a curse and a shame, of which we, and the age we live in, must\r\nrid ourselves. Internal peace, peace among all classes of citizens, is\r\nthe paramount want, the only chance for the salvation of France.\r\n\r\nWill the Democratic Republic give us this peace?\r\n\r\nIt did not begin well. When scarcely born, a civil war was its first\r\nnecessity--most unfortunately for the republic. Governments find great\r\ndifficulty in rising out of their cradles. Will the Democratic Republic\r\nsucceed in the attempt? If time is allowed to it, will it restore social\r\npeace?\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance which strikes me powerfully, and causes me\r\ngreat anxiety: that is, the ardour manifested by the republic to be\r\nexpressly and officially called democratic.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America are universally admitted to be the model of\r\na Republic and a Democracy. Did it ever enter the head of the American\r\npeople to call the United States a Democratic Republic?\r\n\r\nNo; nor is this astonishing. In that country there was no struggle\r\nbetween Aristocracy and Democracy; between an ancient aristocratical\r\nsociety and a new democratic society: on the contrary, the leaders of\r\nsociety in the United States, the descendants of the first colonists,\r\nthe majority of the principal planters in the country and the principal\r\nmerchants in the towns, who constituted the natural aristocracy of the\r\ncountry, placed themselves at the head of the revolution and the\r\nrepublic. The devotion, energy, and constancy which they showed in the\r\ncause, were greater than those displayed by the people. The conquest of\r\ntheir independence, and the foundation of the republic, was not, then,\r\nthe work and the victory of certain classes over certain other classes;\r\nit was the joint work of all, led by the highest, the wealthiest, and\r\nthe most enlightened, who had often great difficulty in rallying the\r\nspirit and sustaining the courage of the mass of the population.\r\n\r\nWhenever officers were to be chosen for the bodies of troops formed in\r\nthe several States, Washington gave this advice:--“Take none but\r\ngentlemen: they are the most trustworthy, as well as the ablest.”\r\n\r\nA republican government has more need than any other of the co-operation\r\nof every class of its citizens: if the mass of the population does not\r\nzealously adopt it, it has no root; if the higher classes are hostile or\r\nindifferent to it, it can enjoy no security. In either case, it is\r\nreduced to the necessity of oppressing. It is precisely because in a\r\nrepublic the authority of the government is weak and precarious, that it\r\nstands in need of great moral support from the society over which it\r\npresides. Which are the republics that have lived long and honourably,\r\novercoming the defects and the storms incident to their institutions?\r\nThose only in which the republican spirit was sincere and general; which\r\nobtained, on the one side, the attachment and the confidence of the\r\npeople, and on the other the decided support of the classes who, by\r\ntheir position, fortune, education, and habits, bring into public life\r\nthe largest share of natural authority, tranquil independence,\r\nknowledge, and leisure. On these conditions only can a republic be\r\nestablished or maintained; for on these conditions only can it exist\r\nwithout troubling the peace of society, and without condemning its\r\ngovernment to the deplorable alternative of the disorganization of\r\nanarchy, or the rigid tension of tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America enjoyed this singular good fortune, but it\r\nis denied to the French Republic. Indeed this is not only admitted, but\r\nproclaimed and vaunted, by its authors. What is the meaning of the words\r\n_Democratic Republic_ now current amongst us, and adopted as the\r\nofficial name, the symbol of the government? It is the echo of an\r\nancient social war-cry--a cry which is still raised, still repeated in\r\nevery class of society; still angrily uttered against one class by\r\nanother, which, in its turn, hears it with terror directed against\r\nitself. All are in turn democrats as against those above them,\r\naristocrats as against those below; threatening and threatened, envious\r\nor envied, and exhibiting continual and revolting changes of position,\r\nattitude, and language, and a deplorable confusion of conflicting ideas\r\nand passions. It is war in the midst of chaos.\r\n\r\nBut I hear it said, “This war is a fact--it is the dominant fact of our\r\nhistory, our society, and our revolution. Such facts can neither be\r\nhidden nor passed over in silence, and this is become final and\r\ndecisive. It is not war that we proclaimed in proclaiming a Democratic\r\nRepublic, it is victory--the victory of Democracy. Democracy has\r\nconquered, and remains alone on the field of battle. She raises her\r\nvisor, announces her name, and takes possession of her conquest.”\r\n\r\nSuch an answer is dictated by illusion or by hypocrisy. How does a\r\ngovernment, whether democratic or not, assert and prove its victory,\r\nwhen that victory is real and decisive? By restoring peace. Thus, and\r\nthus alone, could the Democratic Republic have proved that it had\r\nconquered. But does peace reign in France? Is it even approaching? Do\r\nthe various elements of society, willingly or unwillingly, satisfied or\r\nresigned, really believe in the existence and permanence of peace, and\r\ncome to seek tranquillity, order, and protection under the shelter of\r\nthe Democratic Republic? Listen to the comments on the title assumed by\r\nthe republican government which are universally heard; see the striking\r\nand menacing facts which are continually occurring, and which are the\r\nconsequence or the proof of those comments. Is this state of things\r\npeace? Is there, I will not say the reality, but the bare appearance, of\r\none of those energetic, wise, and conclusive victories which put an end,\r\nfor a time at least, to social conflicts, and secure a long truce to\r\nharassed nations?\r\n\r\nThere are facts of such magnitude, clearness, and prominence, that no\r\nhuman force or fraud can succeed in hiding them. It is in vain that you\r\nrepeat that the days of fraternity are come; that Democracy, such as you\r\nestablish it, puts an end to all hostilities or conflicts of classes,\r\nand assimilates and unites all orders of citizens. The truth, the\r\nterrible truth, gleams through these vain words. Interests, passions,\r\npretensions, situations, and classes conflict on every side, with all\r\nthe fury of boundless hopes and boundless fears. It is clear that the\r\nfirst acts of the Democratic Republic threaten to plunge herself and us\r\ninto the chaos of social war.\r\n\r\nAnd does she give us arms for our defence, or open to us issues for our\r\nescape?\r\n\r\nI pass over the name she assumes; I turn to the political ideas she\r\nproclaims as laws for the government of the state: so far from\r\ndiminishing my anxiety, these serve but to increase it. For if the\r\nbanner of the Democratic Republic appears to me to bear the inscription\r\nof social war, its constitution seems to me to lead directly to\r\nrevolutionary despotism. I find in it no distinct powers, possessed of\r\nsufficient inherent strength to exercise a reciprocal control; no solid\r\nramparts, under the shelter of which various rights and interests can\r\ntake root and flourish in safety; no organization of guarantees; no\r\nbalance of powers in the centre of the state and at the head of\r\ngovernment--nothing but a single motive force and various wheels; a\r\nmaster and his agents; nothing between the personal liberty of the\r\ncitizens and the bare will of the numerical majority: the principle of\r\ndespotism, checked by the right of insurrection.\r\n\r\nSuch is the position of the Democratic Republic with relation to social\r\norder; such, with relation to political order, is the government which\r\nit constitutes.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the result? Assuredly neither peace nor liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen the republic was proclaimed, in the midst of general and profound\r\nalarm, one sentiment prevailed. A great number of men attached to the\r\ninterests of their country, said, or thought, “Let us wait; let us\r\ntry--perhaps the republic will be different now from what it was\r\nheretofore; let the experiment be tried--let it not be disturbed by\r\nviolence: we shall see the result.”\r\n\r\nThey kept their word; they have excited no troubles, they have raised no\r\nobstacles, to disturb or to impede the progress of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe same sentiment prevailed throughout Europe--a sentiment inspired, no\r\ndoubt, by prudence, and not by any cordiality or hope: but the motives\r\nwhich influenced Europe signify little; the important fact is, that no\r\nact, no danger from without troubles the French Republic in the\r\nexperiment of its foundation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, justice compels us to acknowledge that the leaders\r\nof the republic have endeavoured to belie the predictions of its\r\nadversaries and the fears of the public. They have respected the faith\r\nof men. They have fought--very late, it is true, but at last they have\r\nfought--for the existence of society. They have not broken the peace of\r\nEurope, and they have striven to maintain the public credit. These\r\nmeritorious efforts do honour to the men invested with power, and show,\r\nmoreover, what the general instincts of the country are. But these men\r\ncan only retard, they cannot arrest, the downward course of the state on\r\na fatal declivity; they can find no firm footing, and lose ground at\r\nevery step. They have sunk into the revolutionary rut; and though they\r\nstruggle not to plunge deeper into it, they cannot, or they dare not,\r\nquit it. The acts of the republic are not, in all points, what they\r\nformerly were; but the republic is what it was. Whether as to social\r\norganization or political institutions, the conditions of order or the\r\nsecurities for liberty, the republic has nothing better to offer than\r\nwhat she offered fifty years ago. There are the same ideas, the same\r\ncrude and rash experiments, often even the same forms and the same\r\nwords. Strange spectacle! The authors of the republic are afraid of\r\ntheir own work, and would fain change its character and aspect; but they\r\ncan produce nothing but a copy.\r\n\r\nHow long, whatever be its ultimate success or failure, the present\r\nattempt will last, nobody knows. But hitherto France has evidently\r\nreason to fear that its first and paramount interests--social peace and\r\npolitical liberty--will be placed, or left, by the Democratic Republic,\r\nin immense danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE SOCIAL REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Social Republic promises to solve the difficulty.\r\n\r\n“All systems, all governments,” it declares, “have been tried and found\r\nwanting. My ideas alone are new, and have not yet been put to the test.\r\nMy day is come.”\r\n\r\nThis is a mistake. The ideas propounded by the Social Republic are not\r\nnew. They are as old as the world. They have risen up in the midst of\r\nall the great moral and social crises, whether in the East or the West,\r\nin the ancient or the modern world. The second and third centuries in\r\nAfrica, and especially in Egypt, during the agitations caused by the\r\npropagation of Christianity--the middle ages during their confused,\r\nstormy fermentation--the sixteenth century in Germany, in the course of\r\nthe Reformation--and the seventeenth in England during the political\r\nrevolution,--had their Socialists and their Communists, thinking,\r\nspeaking, and acting precisely like those of our own day. It is a phase\r\nof human nature that reappears at epochs when society is like a boiling\r\ncaldron, in which every ingredient is thrown to the surface and exposed\r\nto view.\r\n\r\nTill now, it is true, these ideas had only been enounced on a small\r\nscale, obscurely and timidly, and were repelled and execrated almost as\r\nsoon as they saw the light. But now they boldly exhibit themselves, and\r\nput forth all their pretensions before the public. It signifies little\r\nwhether this is by their own strength, by the fault of the public\r\nitself, or from causes inherent in the present state of society. Since\r\nthe Social Republic is proclaimed aloud, we must look at it steadily and\r\nendeavour to fathom its lowest depths.\r\n\r\nI wish to avoid all circumlocution, to throw aside all disguises, and to\r\ngo straight to the heart of the idol. Nor is this impossible. For as all\r\nthe efforts of the Social Republic tend to one end, so all its ideas are\r\nthe offspring of one fundamental idea.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental idea is to be found, explicitly or implicitly, in the\r\nlanguage of all the leaders of the Social Republic, though all do not\r\navow, and some are perhaps not even conscious that they entertain it. M.\r\nProudhon appears to me the one among them who knows best what he thinks\r\nand what he wishes: he appears to show the firmest and most consistent\r\nunderstanding in his detestable dreams.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, so firm nor so consistent as it appears, or probably\r\nas he himself thinks it. He has not declared, and I doubt if he have\r\nperceived, to what his system leads.\r\n\r\nHis system, nakedly and rigorously stated, is this:--\r\n\r\nAll men have a right--and the same right--to happiness.\r\n\r\nHappiness is the enjoyment (without any limit but that prescribed by the\r\nwant and the faculty of enjoying) of all the good things existing or\r\npossible in this world; whether natural and primitive, or progressively\r\ncreated by the intelligence and the labour of man.\r\n\r\nCertain men, certain families, or certain classes have acquired the\r\nexclusive enjoyment of some (indeed the greater part) of the most\r\nessential and productive of these good things; or, in other words, these\r\nthings, or the means of procuring them, are become the special and\r\nperpetual property of certain men, families, and classes.\r\n\r\nSuch a confiscation of a part of the fund common to mankind, for the\r\nadvantage of a few, is essentially contrary to justice; contrary to the\r\nrights of the men of the same generation, who ought all to enjoy it\r\nequally; and contrary to the rights of successive generations, each of\r\nwhich, on its entrance into life, ought to find the good things of life\r\nequally accessible, and to enjoy them in its turn like its predecessors.\r\n\r\nTherefore all special and perpetual appropriation of the good things\r\nwhich confer happiness, and of the means of procuring those good things,\r\nmust be abolished, in order to insure the universal enjoyment and the\r\nequal distribution of them amongst all men, and all successive\r\ngenerations of men.\r\n\r\nBut how is it possible to abolish property? or, at least, so to\r\ntransform it, that, as regards its social and permanent effects, it may\r\nbe as if it were abolished?\r\n\r\nHere the leaders of the Social Republic differ greatly among themselves.\r\nSome recommend slow and gentle measures; others urge prompt and decisive\r\nones. Some have recourse to political means--for example, a certain\r\norganization of existence and labour in common; others try to invent\r\neconomical and financial expedients--for example, a series of measures\r\ndesigned gradually to destroy the net revenue of property, whether in\r\nland or capital, and thus to render property itself useless and\r\nillusory. But all these schemes originate in the same design and tend to\r\nthe same result; the abolition or the nullification of personal,\r\ndomestic, and hereditary property; and of all institutions, social or\r\npolitical, which are based upon personal, domestic, and hereditary\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nSuch, through all the diversity, obscurity, ambiguity, and contradiction\r\nof the ideas which circulate among the adherents of the Social\r\nRepublic, is the beginning and the end, the alpha and omega, of all\r\nthese systems; such is the end they pursue, and hope to attain.\r\n\r\nBut the following truths are forgotten by M. Proudhon and his friends.\r\n\r\nMankind is not merely a series of individuals called men; it is a race,\r\nwhich has a common life, and a general and progressive destiny. This is\r\nthe distinctive character of man, which he alone of created beings\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nAnd why is this? It is because human individuals are not isolated, nor\r\nconfined to themselves, and to the point they occupy in space or time.\r\nThey are connected with each other; they act upon each other, by ties\r\nand by means which do not require their presence, and which outlive\r\nthem. Hence the successive generations of men are linked together in\r\nunbroken succession.\r\n\r\nThe permanent union and progressive development which are the\r\nconsequences of this unbroken succession of man to man, and generation\r\nto generation, characterize the human race. They constitute its\r\npeculiarity and its greatness, and mark man for sovereignty in this\r\nworld, and for immortality beyond it.\r\n\r\nFrom this are derived, and by this are founded, the family and the\r\nstate, property and inheritance, country, history, glory, all the facts\r\nand all the sentiments which constitute the extended and perpetual life\r\nof mankind, amidst the bounded appearance and rapid disappearance of\r\nindividual men.\r\n\r\nIn the Social Republic all this ceases to exist. Men are mere isolated\r\nand ephemeral beings, who appear in this life, and on this earth the\r\nscene of life, only to take their subsistence and their pleasure, each\r\nfor himself alone, each by the same right, and without any end or\r\npurpose beyond.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the condition of the lower animals. Among them there\r\nexists no tie, no influence, which survives the individual, and extends\r\nto the race. There is no permanent appropriation, no hereditary\r\ntransmission, no unity nor progress in the life of the species;--nothing\r\nbut individuals who appear and then vanish, seizing on their passage\r\ntheir portion of the good things of the earth and the pleasures of life,\r\naccording to the combined measure of their wants and their strength,\r\nwhich, according to them, constitute their right.\r\n\r\nThus, in order to secure to every individual of the human species the\r\nequal and incessantly fluctuating share of the goods and pleasures of\r\nsense, the doctrines of the Social Republic bring men down to the level\r\nof the lower animals. They obliterate the human race.\r\n\r\nThey do worse.\r\n\r\nThere is in the mind of man an imperishable instinct that God presides\r\nover his destiny, and that it is not wholly accomplished in this world.\r\nNaturally and universally, man believes in God and invokes him as his\r\nsupport in the present, his hope in the future.\r\n\r\nAccording to the doctrines of the Social Republic, God is an unknown\r\nimaginary power, upon whom the visible and real rulers of men upon earth\r\nthrow the weight of their own responsibility, and by thus directing the\r\neyes of the suffering towards another master and another state of\r\nexistence, dispose them to acquiesce in their afflictions, whilst they\r\nsecure themselves in the maintenance of their usurpations. According\r\nthen to this doctrine, God is evil, for it is in his name that men are\r\npersuaded to acquiesce in evil. To banish evil from the earth, it\r\ntherefore is necessary to banish God from the mind of man. Men left\r\nalone with their earthly masters, and reduced to an earthly existence,\r\nwill demand the enjoyments of this life and the equal distribution of\r\nthese enjoyments; and as soon as those who are without them insist on\r\nhaving them, they will have them, for they are the strongest.\r\n\r\nThus God and the human race will disappear together. In their place will\r\nremain animals still bearing the name of men, more intelligent and more\r\npowerful than other animals, but having the same condition and the same\r\ndestiny; and like them seizing, on their passage through life, their\r\nportion of the goods of earth and the pleasures of sense, according to\r\nthe combined measure of their wants and their strength, which constitute\r\ntheir right.\r\n\r\nSuch is the philosophy of the Social Republic; such, therefore, is the\r\nbasis of its policy. We have traced its origin and its end.\r\n\r\nI will not insult the good sense or the dignity of mankind by dwelling\r\non it longer. It is the degradation of man, and the destruction of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nNot only of society as at present constituted, but of all human society\r\nwhatsoever: for all society rests on foundations which it is the object\r\nof the Social Republic to overthrow. It is not a mere invasion of the\r\nsocial edifice by intruders, whether barbarian or not; it is the utter\r\nruin of the edifice itself that is contemplated. If M. Proudhon had the\r\nabsolute disposal of society in its present state, with all that it\r\npossesses or enjoys, and were to change the distribution and the\r\npossessors of property at his own good pleasure, he would be guilty of\r\ngreat iniquity, and occasion great suffering. He would not, however,\r\ndestroy society. But if he pretended to give the ideas with which he\r\ntries to batter down the present structure of society, as laws to one\r\nnewly framed, it would infallibly perish. Instead of a State and a\r\nPeople, there would be only a chaos of human beings, without a tie and\r\nwithout repose. Nor would it be possible to reduce that chaos to order\r\nwithout abandoning or evading the ideas of the Social Republic, and\r\nreturning to the natural conditions of social order.\r\n\r\nThe Social Republic is then at once odious and impossible. It is the\r\nmost absurd, and at the same time the most perverse, of all chimeras.\r\n\r\nBut we must not presume upon this. Nothing is more dangerous than what\r\nis at once strong and impossible. The Social Republic is strong; indeed\r\nhow can it be otherwise? Availing themselves with ardour of every kind\r\nof liberty granted for the promulgation of ideas, its advocates are\r\nincessantly labouring to diffuse their principles and their promises\r\nthrough the densest ranks of society. There they find masses of men easy\r\nto delude, easy to inflame. They offer them rights in conformity with\r\ntheir desires. They excite their passions in the name of justice and\r\ntruth. For it would be puerile to deny (and for the honour of human\r\nnature we must admit) that the ideas of the Social Republic have, to\r\nmany minds, the character and the force of truth. In questions so\r\ncomplex and so exciting, the smallest gleam of truth is sufficient to\r\ndazzle the eyes and inflame the hearts of men, and to dispose them to\r\nembrace with transport the grossest and most fatal errors with which\r\nthat truth is blended. Fanaticism is kindled at the same time that\r\nselfishness is awakened; sincere devotedness joins hands with brutal\r\npassions; and, in the terrible fermentation which ensues, evil\r\npredominates; the portion of good mingled with it acts only as its veil\r\nand its instrument.\r\n\r\nWe have no right to complain, for it is we ourselves who incessantly add\r\nfuel to the fire--and this is the most deep-seated of our maladies. It\r\nis we who give to the Social Republic its chief strength. It is the\r\nchaos of our political ideas and our political morality--that chaos\r\ndisguised sometimes under the word _democracy_, sometimes under that of\r\n_equality_, sometimes under that of _people_--which opens all the gates,\r\nand throws down all the ramparts of society before it. We say that\r\nDemocracy is everything. The men of the Social Republic reply,\r\n“Democracy is ourselves.” We proclaim, in language of infinite\r\nconfusion, the absolute equality of rights and the sovereign right of\r\nnumbers. The men of the Social Republic come forward and say, “Count our\r\nnumbers.” The perpetual confusion of the true and the false, the good\r\nand the bad, the possible and the chimerical, which prevails in our own\r\npolicy, our own language, our own acts--this it is which has enfeebled\r\nour arm for defence, and given to the Social Republic a confidence, an\r\narrogance, and an influence for attack, which of itself it would never\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nWhen this confusion shall be dissipated; when we shall arrive at that\r\nperiod of maturity in which free nations, instead of blindly following\r\ntheir first impressions, whithersoever they may lead, see things as they\r\nreally are, assign to the different elements of society their just\r\nmeasure, and to words their true meaning, and regulate their ideas as\r\nthey do their affairs, with that firm moderation which rejects all\r\nfantasies, admits all necessities, respects all rights, has regard to\r\nall interests, and represses all usurpations;--those from below no less\r\nthan those from above--those of fanaticism no less than those of\r\nselfishness: when we shall have reached this point, although the Social\r\nRepublic may not entirely disappear, and although we may not have\r\nentirely crushed its efforts nor annihilated its dangers (for it derives\r\nits ambition and its strength from sources that none can dry up), still\r\nit will be controlled by the union and the order of society; all that is\r\nmost absurd and perverse in its doctrines will be incessantly combated\r\nand defeated, and it will in time take its due place in that vast and\r\nimposing development of the human race which is passing before our\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE REAL AND ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY IN FRANCE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first step towards extricating ourselves out of the chaos in which\r\nwe are plunged, is, a full understanding and frank admission of all the\r\nreal and essential elements of which society in France is now composed.\r\n\r\nIt is because we misunderstand these elements, or refuse them the place\r\nand the consideration they deserve, that we remain in, or relapse into,\r\nchaos.\r\n\r\nA society may be tortured, perhaps destroyed; but you cannot force it to\r\nassume a form and mode of existence foreign to its nature, either by\r\ndisregarding the essential elements of which it is constituted, or by\r\ndoing violence to them.\r\n\r\nLet us first advert to that civil order which forms the basis of French\r\nsociety, as of every other society.\r\n\r\nFamily; property of all kinds, whether land, capital, or wages; labour,\r\nunder all its forms, individual or collective, intellectual or manual;\r\nthe situations in which men are placed, or the relations which are\r\nintroduced among them by the incidents of family, property, and\r\nlabour;--such are the constituents of civil society.\r\n\r\nThe essential and characteristic fact in French civil society is, unity\r\nof laws and equality of rights. All families, property of every kind,\r\nlabour of every description, are governed by the same laws, and possess\r\nor confer the same civil rights. There are no privileges; that is, no\r\nlaws or rights peculiar to particular families, or to property or labour\r\nof particular sorts.\r\n\r\nThis is a new and mighty fact in the history of human societies.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this fact, notwithstanding this civil unity and\r\nequality, there are evidently numerous and great diversities and\r\ninequalities, which unity of laws and equality of rights can neither\r\nprevent nor remove.\r\n\r\nAs to property, whether in immoveables or moveables, land or capital,\r\nthere are rich and poor; there are large, middling, and small\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nThe great proprietors may be less numerous and less wealthy, and the\r\nmiddling and small proprietors may be more numerous and more powerful,\r\nthan they were formerly, or than they are in other countries; but this\r\ndoes not prevent the inequality amongst them from being real and great\r\nenough to occasion a radical difference and inequality of social\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nFrom diversities of position founded on property, I pass on to those\r\nfounded upon labour, of every kind and degree, from the highest\r\nintellectual, to the lowest manual labour. Here too I meet with the same\r\nfact. Here too diversity and inequality arise and subsist, in spite of\r\nidentical laws and equal rights.\r\n\r\nIn the professions called liberal, or those which depend on the\r\ncultivation and employment of the intellect; among lawyers, physicians,\r\nmen of science, and literary men of every sort, some few rise to the\r\nhighest rank, attract business, and gain success, reputation, wealth,\r\nand influence. Others earn laboriously what is barely sufficient for the\r\nwants of their families, and the decencies of their station. Many more\r\nvegetate in obscure and unemployed indigence.\r\n\r\nAnd here one fact deserves notice. From the time when all professions\r\nhave been accessible to all, from the time when labour has been free,\r\nsubject only to the same laws for all, the number of men who have raised\r\nthemselves to the first ranks in the liberal professions has not\r\nsensibly increased. It does not appear that there are now more great\r\nlawyers or physicians, more men of science or letters of the first\r\norder, than there were formerly. It is the men of the second order, and\r\nthe obscure and idle multitude, that are multiplied. It is as if\r\nProvidence did not permit human laws to have any influence over the\r\nintellectual rank of its creatures, or the extent and magnificence of\r\nits gifts.\r\n\r\nIn the other trades or professions, in which labour is chiefly material\r\nand manual, there are also different and unequal situations. Some, by\r\nintelligence and good conduct, accumulate a capital and enter upon the\r\npath of competence and advancement; others, either incapable or\r\nimprovident, lazy or dissolute, remain in the narrow and precarious\r\ncondition of men dependent upon the daily casualties of wages.\r\n\r\nThus throughout the whole extent of civil society,--whether among those\r\nwho depend on labour, or those possessed of property,--diversity and\r\ninequality of situation arise and coexist with unity of laws and\r\nequality of rights.\r\n\r\nHow, indeed, can it be otherwise? If we examine every form of human\r\nsociety throughout all ages and countries--whatever be the variety of\r\ntheir organization, government, extent, or duration, or of the kind and\r\ndegree of civilization to which they have attained--we shall find three\r\ntypes of social position always fundamentally the same, though under\r\nvery different forms and very differently distributed.\r\n\r\n     1. Men living on the income of their property, whether in land or\r\n     capital, without seeking to increase it by their own labour;\r\n\r\n     2. Men occupied in increasing by their own labour the property,\r\n     whether in land or capital, which they possess;\r\n\r\n     3. Men living by their labour without land or capital.\r\n\r\nThese diversities and inequalities in the social condition of men are\r\nnot accidental, or peculiar to any particular time or country. They are\r\nuniversal facts, which naturally arise in every human society, amidst\r\ncircumstances, and under laws, the most widely different.\r\n\r\nAnd the more accurately we study them, the more clearly we shall\r\nperceive that there exists an intimate connexion and a profound harmony\r\nbetween these facts and the nature of man, which we know, on the one\r\nhand, and the mysteries of his destiny, of which we can only obtain a\r\ndim and distant glance, on the other.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. Independently of these diversities and inequalities\r\namong individuals, whether proprietors or labourers, other diversities\r\nand other inequalities exist among the kinds of property and of labour.\r\nThese differences are not less real than the others, though they are\r\nless apparent; nor are they more incompatible with unity of laws or\r\nequality of civil rights.\r\n\r\nMoveable property, or capital, has acquired, and continues to acquire,\r\nan ever increasing extension and importance in the communities of\r\nmodern Europe. It is evident that the progress of civilization in our\r\ntimes is entirely in favour of its development; a just requital for the\r\nimmense services which capital has rendered to civilization.\r\n\r\nBut this is not enough: efforts are continually made to assimilate\r\nimmoveable to moveable property; to render land as transferable, as\r\ndivisible, as convenient to possess and to improve as capital. All the\r\nproposed innovations, direct or indirect, in the laws relating to landed\r\nproperty, have this object in view, either openly or covertly.\r\n\r\nBut though a movement so favourable to capital is going on, landed\r\nproperty is still the most considerable in France, and still holds the\r\nfirst place in the estimation and the desires of the people. Those who\r\npossess it addict themselves more and more to the enjoyment of it, and\r\nthose who do not possess it are more and more eager after its\r\nacquisition. The great proprietor is returning to the taste for living\r\non his estate: the tradesman, who has earned a competence, retires to\r\nthe country to enjoy repose: the peasant thinks of nothing but how to\r\nadd field to field. Whilst everything is done to favour the development\r\nof capital, landed property is more in request and more prized than\r\never.\r\n\r\nIt may be confidently predicted that if, as I hope, social order\r\ntriumphs over its insane or depraved enemies, the attacks of which\r\nlanded property is now the object, and the dangers with which it is\r\nthreatened, will, in the end, enhance its preponderance in society.\r\n\r\nWhence arises this preponderance? Is it merely because, of all sorts of\r\nproperty, land is the most secure, the least variable;--that which best\r\nresists the perturbations, and survives the calamities of society?\r\n\r\nThis motive, though real, powerful, and obvious, is far from being the\r\nonly one. There are other motives, or rather we may call them\r\ndeep-seated instincts, whose empire over man is great, even when he is\r\nunconscious of it. These secure the social preponderance of landed\r\nproperty, or restore it when transiently shaken or enfeebled. Among\r\nthese instincts two appear to me the most powerful; it will be\r\nsufficient to indicate them, for an attempt to fathom their depths would\r\ncarry me too far.\r\n\r\nMoveable property, or capital, may procure a man all the advantages of\r\nwealth; but property in land gives him much more than this. It gives him\r\na place in the domain of the world--it unites his life to the life which\r\nanimates all creation. Money is an instrument by which man can procure\r\nthe satisfaction of his wants and his desires. Landed property is the\r\nestablishment of man as sovereign in the midst of nature. It satisfies\r\nnot only his wants and his desires, but tastes deeply implanted in his\r\nnature. For his family, it creates that domestic country called home,\r\nwith all the living sympathies and all the future hopes and projects\r\nwhich people it. And whilst property in land is more consonant than any\r\nother to the nature of man, it also affords a field of activity the most\r\nfavourable to his moral development, the most suited to inspire a just\r\nsentiment of his nature and his powers. In almost all the other trades\r\nor professions, whether commercial or scientific, success appears to\r\ndepend solely on himself--on his talents, address, prudence, and\r\nvigilance. In agricultural life, man is constantly in the presence of\r\nGod, and of his power. Activity, talents, prudence and vigilance are as\r\nnecessary here as elsewhere to the success of his labours, but they are\r\nevidently no less insufficient than they are necessary. It is God who\r\nrules the seasons and the temperature, the sun and the rain, and all\r\nthose phenomena of nature which determine the success or the failure of\r\nthe labours of man on the soil which he cultivates. There is no pride\r\nwhich can resist this dependence, no address which can escape it. Nor is\r\nit only a sentiment of humility as to his power over his own destiny\r\nwhich is thus inculcated upon man; he learns also tranquillity and\r\npatience. He cannot flatter himself that the most ingenious inventions\r\nor the most restless activity will ensure his success; when he has done\r\nall that depends upon him for the cultivation and the fertilization of\r\nthe soil, he must wait with resignation. The more profoundly we examine\r\nthe situation in which man is placed by the possession and cultivation\r\nof the soil, the more do we discover how rich it is in salutary lessons\r\nto his reason, and benign influences on his character. Men do not\r\nanalyze these facts, but they have an instinctive sentiment of them,\r\nwhich powerfully contributes to that peculiar respect in which they hold\r\nproperty in land, and to the preponderance which that kind of property\r\nenjoys over every other. This preponderance is a natural, legitimate and\r\nsalutary fact, which, especially in a great country, society at large\r\nhas a strong interest in recognising and respecting.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just shown with relation to property, is equally true with\r\nrelation to labour. It is the glory of modern civilization to have\r\nunderstood and proclaimed the moral value and the social importance of\r\nlabour; to have raised it to the estimation and the rank which justly\r\nbelong to it. If I had to point out the most profound evil, the most\r\nfatal vice, of the state of things which prevailed in France up to the\r\nsixteenth century, I should say, without hesitation, the contempt in\r\nwhich labour was held. Contempt of labour and pride in idleness are\r\ncertain signs either that society is under the dominion of brute force,\r\nor that it is verging to its decline. Labour is the law which God has\r\nenjoined on man. It is by labour that he developes and improves\r\neverything around him--by labour that he developes and improves his own\r\nnature. Labour is become the surest pledge of peace between nations. The\r\nrespect and the liberty enjoyed by labour tend more than anything to\r\ncalm the anxieties which we might otherwise too justly feel, and to\r\nraise our hopes for the prospects of the human race. By what fatality\r\nthen has it happened that the word _labour_, so honourable to modern\r\ncivilization, is become a war-cry and a source of disasters in France?\r\nIt is because that word is made a cloak for a great and pernicious lie.\r\nIt is not labour, its interests or its rights, which are the object of\r\nthe ferment excited in its name; the war which has been declared on the\r\nplea of protecting labour, is not in fact waged in its behalf, nor, if\r\nsuccessful, would redound to its advantage. It is, on the contrary,\r\ndirected against labour, whose ruin and degradation would be its\r\ninfallible result.\r\n\r\nLabour, like family, property, and everything else in this world, is\r\nsubject to natural and general laws; among which are, diversity and\r\ninequality of the kinds and the results of labour, and of the stations\r\nof those by whom it is performed. Intellectual labour is superior to\r\nmanual. Descartes, who enlightened France, and Colbert, who laid the\r\nfoundations of her prosperity, performed a labour superior to that of\r\nthe workman who prints the works of Descartes, or who helps to produce\r\nthe manufactures fostered by Colbert; and among these very workmen,\r\nthose who are intelligent, moral, and industrious, justly attain to a\r\nsituation superior to that which the same description of labour can\r\nsecure to the dull, the lazy, or the licentious. The variety of tasks\r\nand vocations allotted to man is infinite. Labour is everywhere--in the\r\nhouse of a father of a family, who educates his children and\r\nsuperintends his affairs; in the cabinet of a statesman who takes part\r\nin the government of his country; in that of the magistrate who\r\nadministers its laws; of the philosopher who instructs, and of the poet\r\nwho charms it; in the fields, on the ocean, on the highways, in the\r\nmanufactories and the workshops; and in every situation, in every\r\nvariety of labour, in every class of labourers, diversity and inequality\r\narise and subsist; inequality of intellectual power, of moral merit, of\r\nsocial importance, of material wealth. These are the natural, primitive,\r\nuniversal laws of labour, originating in the nature and condition of\r\nman, or, to speak more properly, ordained by the wisdom of God. It is\r\nagainst these laws that the war of which we are witnesses is waged; it\r\nis this hierarchy of labour, founded on the decrees of God and the free\r\nactions of man, which it is the object of this war to abolish; and to\r\nsubstitute--what?--the degradation and the ruin of labour, by the\r\nreduction of all labour and all labourers to the same level! Examine the\r\nmeaning which is usually affixed to the word _labour_ in the language of\r\nthese enemies of social order. They do not distinctly say that material\r\nand manual work are the only real work; indeed they occasionally affect\r\ngreat respect for purely intellectual labour: but they omit to mention\r\nthe various sorts of higher labour which are performed on every stage of\r\nthe social scale; their whole attention is absorbed by material labour,\r\nwhich they constantly represent as the kind of labour whose importance\r\nthrows every other into the shade. In short, they talk in a manner to\r\nexcite and keep alive in the minds of the men employed in physical\r\nlabour, the opinion that theirs only has a claim to the name and the\r\nrights of labour. Even when speaking not of labour, but of labourers,\r\nthey hold the same levelling and depreciating language;--ascribing the\r\nrights of labour to workmen, as such, independently of all degrees of\r\npersonal merit. Thus the coarsest and most ordinary labour is assumed as\r\nthe standard to which all the higher degrees are adjusted; and diversity\r\nand inequality are abolished, for the supposed advantage of that which\r\nis the least and the lowest in the scale!\r\n\r\nDo those who hold such language serve--do they even understand--the\r\ncause which they affect to advocate? Is it by such means that we can\r\nadvance, or even barely keep our ground, on that glorious path of\r\ncivilization in which labour acquired its proper rank and dignity? Do we\r\nnot, on the contrary, mutilate, degrade, and disgrace labour, when we\r\nstrip it of a part of its noblest claims, and substitute in their stead\r\npretensions which are not only absurd and preposterous, but mean, in\r\nspite of their insolence? Lastly, does not such language show a gross\r\nmisconception and violent perversion of the natural facts on which civil\r\nsociety in France is founded? This, though admitting unity of laws and\r\nequality of rights, assuredly never pretended to abolish that variety of\r\nfaculties, merits, and destinies, which is one of the mysterious laws of\r\nGod, and the inevitable result of the free will of man.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from civil to political society; that is, the relation\r\nexisting between men, in virtue of their interests, opinions and\r\nsentiments, and the ruling power under which they live. Let us endeavour\r\nhere to determine also the real and essential elements of which society\r\nis now composed in France.\r\n\r\nIn a free country, or in one struggling to become free, the elements of\r\npolitical society are political parties, in the widest and highest\r\nacceptation of the term.\r\n\r\nLegally, there are now no other parties in France than those inherent\r\nin every constitutional state; the party of the Government and that of\r\nthe Opposition. There are neither Legitimists nor Orleanists. The\r\nRepublic exists, and will not suffer the principle of its existence to\r\nbe attacked; and as this is the indisputable right of every established\r\ngovernment, it is by no means my intention to contest or to infringe it.\r\n\r\nBut there are things so inherent in society, that prohibitive laws, even\r\nwhen obeyed, fail to eradicate them. There are political parties of\r\nwhich the germ lies so deeply buried, and the roots so widely spread,\r\nthat they do not die, even when they are no longer apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Legitimist party is not a mere dynastic, nor is it a mere\r\nmonarchical, party. It is indeed attached to a principle and to a name;\r\nbut it also occupies a great substantive place both in the history and\r\non the soil of France. It represents all that remains of the elements so\r\nlong predominant throughout that French society which contained within\r\nitself the fruitful and vigorous germs of progress; and out of which\r\narose, after a growth of ages, the France which suddenly burst forth in\r\n1789, mighty, aspiring, and glorious. Though the French Revolution\r\noverthrew the ancient fabric of French society, it could not annihilate\r\nits elements. In spite of the convulsions by which they were dispersed,\r\nand in the midst of the ruins by which they are surrounded, these still\r\nsubsist, and are still considerable in modern France. At every\r\nsucceeding crisis they evidently acquiesce more completely in the social\r\norder and political constitution which the country has adopted; and by\r\nthis acquiescence they take their station in it, and change their\r\nposition without disowning their character.\r\n\r\nMoreover, does anybody believe that the party which endeavoured to found\r\na constitutional monarchy in 1830, and which upheld that monarchy for\r\nmore than seventeen years, has vanished in the tempest that overthrew\r\nthe edifice it had raised? It has been called the party of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_,--the middle classes; and this in fact it was, and still\r\nis. The ascendancy of the middle classes in France, incessantly supplied\r\nby recruits from the bulk of the population, is the characteristic\r\nfeature in our history since 1789. Not only have they conquered that\r\nascendancy, but they have justified their claims to it. Amidst the\r\ngrievous errors into which they have fallen, and for which they have\r\npaid so dearly, they have shown that they really possessed the qualities\r\nthat constitute the strength and greatness of a nation. On all\r\nemergencies, for all the wants of the country in war or peace, and to\r\nevery kind of social career, this class has abundantly furnished men,\r\nnay, generations of men, able, active, and sincerely devoted to the\r\nservice of their country. When called on in 1830 to found a new\r\nmonarchy, the middle classes brought to that difficult task a spirit of\r\njustice and political sincerity of which no succeeding event can cancel\r\nthe merit. In spite of all the passions and all the perils that assailed\r\nthem, in spite even of their own passions, they earnestly desired\r\nconstitutional order, and they faithfully observed it. At home, they\r\nrespected and maintained universal, legal and practical liberty; abroad,\r\nuniversal, firm and prosperous peace.\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who disregard or despise the power of the\r\naffections in political affairs. I do not regard it as any proof of\r\ngreatness or strength of mind to say, “We don’t care for such or such a\r\nfamily; we attach no value to proper names; we take men or leave them\r\naccording to our wants or our interests:” to me, this language, and the\r\nclass of opinions which it discloses, appear to betray far more\r\npolitical ignorance and impotence than elevation of mind or rectitude of\r\njudgment. It is, however, indisputable that political parties having no\r\nother attachment than that excited by proper names, and no other\r\nstrength than that derived from personal affections, would be extremely\r\nfeeble and inefficient. But can anybody for a moment imagine that the\r\nLegitimist party, or the party attached to the monarchy of 1830, are of\r\nthat nature? Is it not evident, on the contrary, that these parties are\r\nfar more the offspring of the general course of events than of\r\nattachment to persons? that they are of a social, as well as a political\r\nnature, and correspond to the most deep-rooted and indestructible\r\nelements of society in France?\r\n\r\nAround these great parties floats the mass of the population; holding to\r\nthe one or the other by its interests, its habits, or its virtuous and\r\nrational instincts; but without any strong or solid adhesion, and\r\nincessantly assailed and worked upon by Socialists and Communists of\r\nevery shade. These last do not constitute political parties, for they do\r\nnot espouse any political principle, nor advocate any peculiar political\r\norganization. Their only endeavour is to destroy all the influences, and\r\nto break all the ties, material or moral, which bind the part of the\r\npopulation living by the labour of its hands, to the class occupied in\r\nthe business of the state; to divide that part of the population from\r\nthe land-owner, the capitalist, the clergy, and all the other\r\nestablished authorities; and finally to work upon it through its\r\nmiseries, and rule it by its appetites. One name denotes them all; all\r\nare members of the one great Anarchical Party. It is not the superiority\r\nof this or that form of government which they preach to the people--it\r\nis sheer and absolute anarchy; for one kind of government is as\r\nincompatible with chaos as another. There is, however, one striking\r\nfact: whether sincere or depraved, blind Utopians or designing\r\nAnarchists, all these disturbers of social order are Republicans. Not\r\nthat they are more attached or more submissive to republican government\r\nthan to any other; for every regular and efficient government, whether\r\nrepublican or monarchical, is equally odious to them; but they hope that\r\nunder a republic they shall find stronger weapons to aid their attacks,\r\nand feebler barriers to resist them. This is the secret of their\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nI have thus surveyed French society on every side. I have sought out and\r\nexhibited all its real and essential elements, and all my inquiries lead\r\nto the same result. On every side, whether in political or civil life, I\r\nmeet with profound diversities and inequalities: diversities and\r\ninequalities which can neither be obliterated in civil life by unity of\r\nlaws and equality of rights, nor in political life by a republican\r\ngovernment; and which endure or revive under legislation of every kind\r\nand government of every form.\r\n\r\nThis is not an opinion, an argument, or a conjecture, but a statement of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nNow what is the import and tendency of these facts? Shall we find in\r\nthem the ancient classifications of society? Will the ancient political\r\ndenominations apply to them? Do they exhibit an aristocracy opposed to a\r\ndemocracy; or a nobility, a bourgeoisie, and a so-called people? Would\r\nthese diversities and inequalities of social and political position\r\nform, or tend to form, a hierarchy of classes analogous to those which\r\nformerly existed in French society?\r\n\r\nNo, certainly!--the words _aristocracy_, _democracy_, _nobility_,\r\n_bourgeoisie_, or _hierarchy_, do not correspond to the constituent\r\nelements of modern French society, or express them with any truth or\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nDoes then this society consist solely of citizens equal among each\r\nother? Are there no different classes, and only individual diversities\r\nand inequalities, devoid of all political importance? Is there nothing\r\nbut a great and uniform democracy, which seeks satisfaction in a\r\nrepublic at the risk of finding repose in a despotism?\r\n\r\nNeither is this the fact; either of these descriptions would equally\r\nmisrepresent the true state of our society. We must emancipate ourselves\r\nfrom the tyranny of words, and see things as they really are. France is\r\nextremely new, and yet full of the past; whilst the principles of unity\r\nand equality have determined her organization, she still contains social\r\nconditions and political situations profoundly different and unequal.\r\nThere is no hierarchical classification, but there are different\r\nclasses; there is no aristocracy, properly so called, but there is\r\nsomething which is not democracy. The real, essential, and distinct\r\nelements of French society, which I have just described, may enfeeble\r\neach other by perpetual conflicts, but neither can destroy or\r\nobliterate the other. They survive all the struggles in which they\r\nengage, and all the calamities which they inflict on each other. Their\r\nco-existence is a fact which it is not in their power to abolish. Let\r\nthem then fully acquiesce in it; let them live together, and in peace.\r\nNeither the liberty nor the repose, the dignity nor the prosperity, the\r\ngreatness nor the security of France, are to be had on any other terms.\r\n\r\nOn what conditions can this peace be established?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PEACE IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever it shall have been distinctly perceived and fully admitted that\r\nthe different classes which exist among us, and the political parties\r\nwhich correspond to those classes, are natural and deeply-rooted\r\nelements of French society, a great step will have been made towards\r\nsocial peace.\r\n\r\nThis peace is impossible so long as each of the different classes and\r\nthe great political parties into which our society is divided cherishes\r\nthe hope of annihilating the others, and of reigning alone. That is the\r\nevil which, ever since 1789, has periodically agitated and convulsed\r\nFrance. Sometimes the democratic element has aimed at the extinction of\r\nthe aristocratic; at other times the aristocratic element has tried to\r\ncrush the democratic, and to regain its former predominance.\r\nConstitutions, laws, and the administration of the government have been\r\nby turns directed, like engines of war, to one or the other of these\r\nends--a war to the death, in which neither combatant believed his life\r\ncompatible with that of his rival.\r\n\r\nThis war was suspended by the Emperor Napoleon. He rallied around him\r\nthe classes which had formerly possessed, and those which actually\r\nenjoyed, power and influence; and by the security which he offered them,\r\nby the continual turmoil in which he kept them, or by the yoke which he\r\nimposed upon them, he established and maintained peace.\r\n\r\nAfter him, from 1814 to 1830, and from 1830 to 1848, this war was\r\nrenewed. A great progress had been made. Liberty had become real. Both\r\nthe ancient aristocratic, and the modern democratic elements acquired\r\nstrength; but though neither could succeed in suppressing the other,\r\neach was impatient of its adversary’s existence, and eagerly strove for\r\nthe mastery.\r\n\r\nAnd now a third combatant has entered the arena. The democratic party\r\nhaving divided itself into two conflicting sections, the workmen are now\r\narrayed against their masters, or the people against the middle classes.\r\nThis new war, like the former, is a war to the death; for the new\r\naspirant is as arrogant and exclusive as the others can have ever been.\r\nThe sovereignty, it is said, belongs of right to the people only; and no\r\nrival, ancient or modern, noble or bourgeois, can be admitted to share\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEvery pretension of this kind must be withdrawn, not by one only, but by\r\nall of the contending parties. The great elements of society among\r\nus--the old aristocracy, the middle classes, and the people--must\r\ncompletely renounce the hope of excluding and annihilating each other.\r\nLet them vie with each other in influence; let each maintain its\r\nposition and its rights, or even endeavour to extend and improve them,\r\nfor in such efforts consists the political life of a country. But there\r\nmust be an end of all radical hostility: they must resign themselves to\r\nlive together, side by side, in the ranks of the government as well as\r\nin civil society. This is the first condition of social peace. How, it\r\nmay be asked, can this condition be satisfied? How can the different\r\nelements of our society be brought to tolerate each other’s existence,\r\nand to fulfil their several functions in the government of the country?\r\n\r\nI reply, by such an organization of that government as may assign to\r\neach its place and functions; may concede something to the wishes, while\r\nit imposes limits to the ambition, of all.\r\n\r\nI am here met by an idea, perhaps the most false and fatal of all those\r\ncurrent in our days on the subject of constitutional organization. It is\r\nthis:--“National unity involves political unity. There is but one\r\npeople: there can exist at the head and in the name of this people, but\r\none power.”\r\n\r\nThis is the idea which most completely characterizes both revolution and\r\ndespotism. The Convention and Louis XIV. exclaimed alike, “L’Etat, c’est\r\nmoi.”\r\n\r\nIt is as false as it is tyrannical. A nation is not a vast aggregate of\r\nmen, consisting of so many thousands or millions, occupying a certain\r\nextent of ground, and concentrated in, and represented by, a unit,\r\ncalled king or assembly. A nation is a great organic body, formed by the\r\nunion within one country of certain social elements which assume the\r\nshape and constitution naturally impressed upon them by the primitive\r\nlaws of God and the free acts of man. The diversity of these elements\r\nis, as we have just seen, one of the essential facts resulting from\r\nthose laws; and is absolutely inconsistent with the false and tyrannous\r\nunity which it is proposed to establish at the centre of government, as\r\nrepresentative of that society in which it never exists.\r\n\r\nWhat then, it is said, must all the elements of society, all the groups\r\nof which it is naturally composed, all the various classes, professions,\r\nand opinions it contains, be represented in the government by powers\r\ncorresponding to each?\r\n\r\nNo, certainly: society is not a federation of professions, classes, and\r\nopinions, which treat, by their several delegates, of the affairs which\r\nare common to them all; any more than it is a uniform mass of exactly\r\nsimilar elements, which send their representatives to the centre of\r\ngovernment only because they cannot all repair thither themselves, and\r\nare compelled to reduce themselves to a number which can meet in one\r\nplace and deliberate in common. Social unity requires that there should\r\nbe but one government; but the diversity of the social elements equally\r\nrequires that this government should not be one sole power.\r\n\r\nThere is a natural process of attraction and concentration at work in\r\nthe heart of society, and among the numberless particular associations\r\nwhich it contains (such as families, professions, classes, and parties),\r\nby which all the smaller associations are successively absorbed into the\r\nlarger. The multitude of particular and different elements are thus\r\nreduced to a small number of principal and essential elements, which\r\ninclude and represent all the rest.\r\n\r\nI do not think that these principal elements of society ought to be all\r\nspecially represented in the government of the state by several\r\nauthorities; I only maintain that their diversity is inconsistent with\r\nthe unity of the central power.\r\n\r\nTo this reasoning it has often been confidently replied--that the\r\nvarious elements of society are congregated, by the process of free\r\nelection, in a single assembly which represents the whole nation; and\r\nwhich affords them an arena for free discussion, where they can maintain\r\ntheir opinions, their interests and their rights, and exert their proper\r\ninfluence over the resolutions of the assembly, and consequently over\r\nthe government of the state.\r\n\r\nWe are then to infer from this that we have discharged the claims of\r\nthe most varied, weighty, and essential social elements when we have\r\nsaid, “Get yourselves elected, then give your opinion, and try to make\r\nit the prevalent one!” Election and discussion constitute the entire\r\nbasis which is to sustain the social edifice; election and discussion\r\nafford a sufficient guarantee for all interests, rights, and liberties!\r\n\r\nSuch a theory betrays a strange ignorance of human nature, human\r\nsociety, and the French people.\r\n\r\nI will put a single question. The interests of society are twofold;\r\nthose of stability and conservation on the one hand, and those of\r\nactivity and progress on the other. If you wanted to secure the\r\ninterests of activity and progress, would you seek this security among\r\nthe social elements in which the interests of stability and conservation\r\nare peculiarly strong? Undoubtedly not: you would commit the interests\r\nof activity and progress to the care of their natural and willing\r\nprotectors, and you would do well. But all these various interests have\r\nequal wants and equal claims. There is no safety for any of them but in\r\nits appropriate power; that is to say, in a power analogous to it in its\r\nnature and in its relations to other powers. If the interests of\r\nstability and conservation are committed wholly to the chances of the\r\ncomposition of a single elective assembly, invested with the sole and\r\nfinal decision of all questions, and to the chances of the discussions\r\nin that assembly, be assured that sooner or later, after numerous\r\noscillations between tyrannies of different kinds, those interests will\r\nbe sacrificed or lost.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to seek the principle of the political stability of\r\ngovernment in the mobile elements of society. The permanent elements of\r\nsociety must find in the government itself, powers corresponding to\r\nthem, and offering a pledge for their security. A diversity of powers is\r\nequally indispensable to conservation and to liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of amazement that this truth should be disputed, for the\r\nvery men who dispute it have made a great step towards its admission and\r\napplication. After establishing unity of power at the head of the state,\r\nthey have admitted a division of powers lower down, on account of the\r\ndiversity of functions. They have carefully separated the legislative,\r\nexecutive, administrative, and judicial powers; thus practically\r\nacknowledging the necessity of giving guarantees to different interests,\r\nby the separation and the different constitution of these powers. How is\r\nit that they do not see that this necessity has a higher application,\r\nand that the diversity of the general interests of society and of the\r\nduties of the supreme power, imperatively requires a diversity of powers\r\nin the highest as well as in the subordinate spheres of government?\r\n\r\nBut to constitute a real and efficient diversity of powers, it is not\r\nenough that each should have a distinct place and name in the\r\ngovernment; it is also necessary that all should be strongly organized,\r\nall fully competent to fill and to maintain the place they occupy.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion of the day to think that harmony among the powers of\r\nthe state, and security against their excess, is to be found in their\r\nweakness. People are afraid of every kind of authority; and in order to\r\nprevent their destroying each other, or encroaching upon liberty, they\r\ningeniously endeavour to undermine them all in turn.\r\n\r\nThis is a monstrous error. Every weak power is a power doomed to perish\r\nby extinction or by usurpation. If several weak powers conflict, either\r\none will become strong at the expense of the others, and will end in a\r\ntyranny, or they will trammel and neutralize each other, and the result\r\nwill be anarchy.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that has constituted the strength and success of\r\nconstitutional monarchy in England? It is that, while the royalty and\r\naristocracy were originally strong, the commonalty has become strong by\r\nsuccessive conquests of its rights from the aristocracy and the king. Of\r\nthe three constitutional powers, two retain much of their primitive\r\ngreatness, and rest firmly on their deep and primæval roots; the third\r\nhas risen to greatness, and has gradually struck its roots deeply into\r\nthe same soil. Each is fully able to defend itself against the other,\r\nand to fulfil its peculiar mission.\r\n\r\nWhen an earnest and sincere attempt was made to establish constitutional\r\nmonarchy in France, its firmest adherents desired an ancient and\r\nhistorical basis for royalty; for the Chamber of Peers, an hereditary\r\nseat in the legislature, and for the Chamber of Deputies, direct\r\nelection: not by any means in obedience to theories or precedents, but\r\nin order that the great powers of the state might be true\r\npowers,--efficient and living entities, not words or phantoms.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, notwithstanding the difference of names,\r\nsituations, manners, and institutions, Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson,\r\nand Madison, when founding the Republic, recognised and acted upon the\r\nsame principles. They too thought it necessary to have different powers\r\nat the head of the government; and in order that the difference might be\r\nreal, they gave to each of these powers--_i.e._ the two chambers and the\r\nPresident--a distinct origin; as distinct as the general institutions of\r\nthe country would permit, and as different as their several functions.\r\n\r\nDiversity of origin and of nature is one of the conditions essential to\r\nthe intrinsic and real strength of powers, and this again is the\r\ncondition indispensable to political harmony and social peace.\r\n\r\nNor is it only at the summit and centre of government that these\r\nprinciples ought to guide the organization of power; they are equally\r\napplicable through the whole extent of the country, in the management of\r\nits local, no less than of its general affairs. A great deal has been\r\nsaid in favour of centralization and administrative unity, and there is\r\nno doubt that they have rendered great service to France. We shall\r\npreserve many of their forms, regulations, maxims, and works; but the\r\ntime of their sovereignty is past. Centralization is no longer\r\nsufficient for the chief wants and pressing dangers of society. The\r\nstruggle is no longer confined to the centre; it agitates the whole\r\nnation. Since property, family, and all the bases of society, are\r\nattacked everywhere, they must everywhere be vigorously defended; and\r\nfunctionaries or orders which have to travel from the centre of\r\ngovernment will be found a very inadequate defence, even though\r\nsupported by bayonets. Landed proprietors, and heads of families, who\r\nare the natural guardians of society, must all be enjoined and empowered\r\nto maintain its security by conducting its affairs: they must have an\r\nactive share in the management of its local as well as its general\r\ninterests; in the administration, as well as the government of the\r\ncountry: the central government ought to uphold the banner of social\r\norder, but it cannot bear the whole burthen of it unaided.\r\n\r\nI speak always on the presumption that I am speaking _to_ a free\r\ncountry, and _of_ a free government; for it is under free governments\r\nthat the safety of society demands all these conditions: they have\r\nevidently no application to absolute governments.\r\n\r\nAbsolute power is, however, subject to certain conditions, as well as\r\nliberty. It is far from being always possible where it would be\r\nsubmitted to, nor can it be obtained wherever it is desired.\r\n\r\nLet the friends of freedom never forget that nations prefer absolute\r\npower to anarchy. The first want--the first instinct--of communities, as\r\nwell as of governments or of individuals, is self-preservation. Now a\r\ncommunity may exist under absolute power; under anarchy, if it lasts, it\r\nmust perish.\r\n\r\nThe readiness, I might almost say the eagerness, with which nations\r\nthrow their liberties into the gulf of anarchy, in the desperate attempt\r\nto close it, is a shameful spectacle. I know nothing more lamentable to\r\nwitness than this sudden renunciation of all the rights so noisily and\r\nvehemently demanded. The friend of freedom and of progress who would\r\nfall into despair of man and of the future at this humiliating sight\r\nmust withdraw into himself, and refresh and invigorate his soul at\r\nthose high and pure fountains which nourish deep convictions and\r\nfar-reaching hopes.\r\n\r\nLet not France, whatever be her peril, reckon on absolute power to save\r\nher. It would not justify her confidence. In her ancient society,\r\nabsolute power reposed on a principle of moderation and of permanence;\r\nwhile, under the Emperor Napoleon, it contained a principle of strength,\r\neither of which it would vainly seek for now. Popular tyranny or\r\nmilitary dictatorship may be the expedient of a day, but can never be a\r\nform of government. Free institutions are now as necessary to social\r\npeace as they are to individual dignity; and power, whatever be its\r\nnature or origin, whether republican or monarchical, has no wiser course\r\nto pursue than to learn to use them, for they are now its only\r\ninstruments and its only stay.\r\n\r\nIf some are tempted to seek repose in other sources, let them abandon\r\nall such hopes. Whatever be the future destiny of France, we shall not\r\nescape from the necessity of a constitutional government; we are\r\ncondemned, for our own salvation, to surmount all the difficulties, and\r\nto fulfil all the conditions, with which it may be encumbered.\r\n\r\nThere is but one means of rendering ourselves equal to this mighty task,\r\nand of complying with this imperious necessity. All the elements of\r\nstability, all the conservative forces in the country must unite closely\r\nand act constantly together. It is no more possible to extinguish\r\ndemocracy in the nation than liberty in the government. That immense\r\nmovement which has been communicated to every country and agitates all\r\ntheir deepest recesses; which is incessantly inciting every class and\r\nevery individual to think, to desire, to claim, to act, to employ his\r\nactivity in every direction,--this movement will not be stopped. It is a\r\nfact in which we must acquiesce, whether it pleases or displeases us,\r\nwhether it awakens our fears or excites our hopes. But though we cannot\r\nextinguish this movement, we can guide and govern it; and if it is not\r\nguided and governed, it will throw back the whole current of\r\ncivilization, and will be the opprobrium as well as the curse of\r\nhumanity. Democracy, to be guided and governed, must form a considerable\r\ningredient in the state, but it must not be the sole one: it must be\r\nstrong enough to climb itself, but never to pull down others: it must\r\nfind issues, and encounter barriers on every side. Democracy is a\r\nfertilizing, but muddy stream, whose waters are never beneficent till\r\nthe turbid and impetuous current has spread itself abroad and subsided\r\ninto calmness and purity.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, a great people, though in a small country, whose republican\r\nglory shone brightly even amidst the full blaze of the monarchical glory\r\nof Louis XIV., conquered their country from the ocean, and maintained\r\ntheir conquest, by cutting canals and raising dikes on every side. It\r\nis the ceaseless care of the whole community that the canals be never\r\nobstructed and the dikes never broken; for on this depend the prosperity\r\nand the existence of Holland.\r\n\r\nLet all the conservative elements of France learn from this example; let\r\nthem unite all their efforts, let them keep a common and incessant\r\nwatch, that the rising tide of democracy may always find safe channels\r\nand indestructible barriers. On the joint and efficient action of these\r\ndepend the safety of the community, and the safety of each individual\r\ncomposing it. If the conservative elements of French society know how to\r\ncombine and to form a united body, if the party spirit which prevails\r\namong them shall give way to a large and enlightened political spirit,\r\nthen France, and the democracy of France, are saved. If the conservative\r\nelements remain disunited and disorganized, Democracy will destroy\r\nFrance, and will perish under the ruins she has made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMORAL CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PEACE IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political conditions which I have just specified are indispensable\r\nto the re-establishment of social peace in France; but they alone will\r\nnot suffice. Such a work requires something more than a good\r\norganization of powers; it requires a certain measure of prudence and\r\nvirtue on the part of the people themselves. It is a gross delusion to\r\nbelieve in the sovereign power of political machinery. The free will of\r\nman plays a great part in social affairs, and the success of\r\ninstitutions must in the end depend on the men who live under them.\r\n\r\nMuch has lately been said about Christianity, and the name of Jesus\r\nChrist has been frequently introduced into the harangues of demagogues.\r\nGod forbid that I should suffer my mind to dwell long on these\r\nprofanations,--this hideous mixture of cynicism and hypocrisy. I shall\r\nonly suggest one question--If the French nation were sincerely and\r\npractically Christian, what would be its conduct in the midst of the\r\nterrible difficulties by which it is agitated and perplexed?\r\n\r\nThe rich and great of the earth would earnestly and perseveringly labour\r\nto alleviate the distresses of those beneath them. Their intercourse\r\nwith the poorer classes would be active, affectionate, morally and\r\nphysically beneficent. The various sufferings and perils of humanity\r\nwould call forth corresponding associations, endowments, and works of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nThe poor and humble would be submissive to the will of God and the laws\r\nof society. They would seek the satisfaction of their wants in regular\r\nand assiduous labour, the improvement of their condition in good conduct\r\nand provident habits, and consolation and hope in the futurity promised\r\nto man.\r\n\r\nThese are the Christian virtues--they are called Faith, Hope, and\r\nCharity. Is this the conduct men are exhorted by the preachers of\r\nDemocracy to pursue? Are these the sentiments which these men, who\r\naffect a veneration for the Founder of Christianity, try to rekindle in\r\nthe hearts of the people?\r\n\r\nI doubt whether they can carry the impudence of mendacity so far as to\r\nanswer in the affirmative; and if they dared to do so, I am sure that,\r\nspite of the credulity of the public, they would receive a universal\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nBut these monstrous attempts, whether the result of fraud or of folly,\r\nwill not succeed. Christianity will not be disfigured or degraded so.\r\nNothing can be more anti-Christian than the ideas, the language, or the\r\ninfluence of the present race of reformers of social order. If Communism\r\nand Socialism prevailed, Christianity must become extinct: if\r\nChristianity were more potent, Communism and Socialism would soon sink\r\ninto the chaotic mass of obscure and forgotten extravagances.\r\n\r\nI wish to be perfectly just; and while attacking notions which are the\r\ndisgrace and the curse of our times, I would acknowledge whatever germ\r\nof morality they contain, and show what virtuous pretexts or benevolent\r\ninstincts may delude their advocates or seduce their converts.\r\n\r\nThere is a sentiment, noble and beautiful in itself, which has been much\r\nand often appealed to throughout all the perturbations and convulsions\r\nof society in France; this sentiment is, enthusiasm for mankind--the\r\nenthusiasm of confidence, sympathy, and hope. This feeling reigned\r\nsupreme among us in 1789, and gave its resistless impulse to that epoch.\r\nThere was no virtue that was not ascribed to man--no success that was\r\nnot hoped and predicted for him. Faith and hope in man took the place of\r\nfaith and hope in God. The trial was not long deferred. The idol did not\r\nlong retain its power. Confidence was soon convicted of presumption, and\r\nsympathy ended in social war and the scaffold. The hopes that were\r\nfulfilled appeared insignificant, compared to those that had vanished\r\nlike dreams. Never did experience advance with such rapid strides to\r\nconfront and overthrow pride.\r\n\r\nYet it is to this same sentiment that our modern reformers of social\r\norder appeal. It is this same idolatrous enthusiasm for human nature\r\nthat they invoke. At the same time that they rob man of his sublimest\r\nemotions and loftiest prospects, they exalt without measure his nature\r\nand his power: rather, I ought to say, they miserably degrade them, for\r\nthey promise him nothing beyond this earth; but while there, their\r\nbelief in him is blind and implicit--their hope from him, and for him,\r\nboundless.\r\n\r\nThe most melancholy reflection is, that this insane idolatry is their\r\nonly excuse; the only one of their ideas which springs from a source of\r\nthe smallest elevation, or possesses the smallest moral value. If they\r\nhad not a blind faith in man, and a servile adoration of humanity, they\r\nwould be nothing more than the propagators of a rapacious, brutish, and\r\nlawless materialism.\r\n\r\n“If man exalteth himself,” says Pascal, “I abase him; if he abaseth\r\nhimself, I exalt him.” We ought continually to bear in mind and to apply\r\nthese admirable words. Certainly man is a being worthy to inspire us\r\nwith respect and love, and with high hopes of his future condition. To\r\nthose who were insensible to the nobleness of his nature and his\r\ndestiny--to himself, if he forgot it--I should say with Pascal, “If man\r\nabaseth himself, I exalt him.” But to those who promise themselves\r\neverything from him, by promising him everything; whose expectations\r\nfrom him are as boundless as those they labour to excite in him; to\r\nthose who, goaded by their own pride, are constantly striving to inflate\r\nhis pride; who forget, and try to make him forget, the frailty and\r\nwretchedness of his nature, the supreme laws by which he is bound, and\r\nthe support of which he stands in need,--to those men I would say with\r\nPascal, “If man exalteth himself, I abase him.” And facts,--recent,\r\nglaring, incontrovertible facts,--say it far more impressively than I.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to restore France to the state of things which\r\nprevailed in 1789--to rekindle that enthusiasm of presumptuous\r\nconfidence and hope with which the nation was then drunk--an enthusiasm\r\nwhich then was genuine as well as general, had the ardour and\r\nspontaneity of youth, and was rendered excusable by inexperience, but\r\nwhich now would be only a false and factitious excitement; a thin, an\r\nineffectual veil thrown over bad passions and insane dreams. By what\r\nincurable arrogance could we reject the lessons which God has lavished\r\nupon us for the last sixty years? He does not require of us to despair\r\nof ourselves and of our species, to abandon all efforts for its\r\nprogress, or to shut our hearts against a tender sympathy in its weal\r\nor woe; but He does forbid us to exalt our own nature into an idol. He\r\ncommands us to see it as it is; without illusion and without coldness;\r\nand to love and serve it according to the laws He has established. I\r\nhave certainly no desire to extinguish any of the small portion of moral\r\nardour still remaining in the world, nor to infuse additional doubt and\r\nindifference into hearts already so lukewarm and uncertain. But neither\r\ncan I add to their delusions. It is not by retracing its course toward\r\nthe sources of the revolution, that France will walk with a firm and\r\nanimated step: those fountains are all dry, and our generation will not\r\ngo to slake its thirst or refresh its spirit at them. You complain of\r\nits languor; you want to see the faith and the moral energy, which are\r\nthe soul and strength of nations, revive among us: but it is vain to\r\nseek them in the revolutionary spirit, which is wholly incapable of\r\ninspiring them. It is a fire which has still power to consume, but can\r\nneither warm nor enlighten. Instead of reviving and invigorating our\r\nbelief in the great truths which are the wholesome stimulants as well as\r\nthe true guardians of society, they can only diffuse doubt and\r\nperplexity. Certainly France wants to be morally elevated and\r\nstrengthened; she wants to regain her faith in, and attachment to, fixed\r\nand undisputed principles. But the revolutionary spirit can do nothing\r\nto appease these wants; the scenes and the harangues, the predictions\r\nand the recollections which it suggests, can only retard the work. The\r\nhonour of its accomplishment is reserved for other moral powers and\r\nother intellectual tendencies.\r\n\r\nAmong the foremost, are the domestic sentiments and morals. The Family\r\nis now, more than ever, the first element and the last rampart of\r\nsociety. Whilst, in general society, everything becomes more and more\r\nmobile, personal, and transient, it is in domestic life that the demand\r\nfor permanency, and the feeling of the necessity of sacrificing the\r\npresent to the future, are indestructible. It is in domestic life that\r\nthe ideas and the virtues which form a counterpoise to the excessive and\r\nungoverned movement excited in the great centres of civilization, are\r\nformed. The tumult of business and pleasure, temptation and strife which\r\nreigns in our great cities, would soon throw the whole of society into a\r\ndeplorable state of ferment and dissolution, if domestic life, with its\r\ncalm activity, its permanent interests, and its fixed property, did not\r\noppose solid barriers throughout the country to the restless waves of\r\nthis stormy sea. It is in the bosom of domestic life, and under its\r\ninfluences, that private, the basis of public, morality is most\r\nsecurely maintained. There too, and in our days there almost\r\nexclusively, the affections of our nature,--friendship, gratitude, and\r\nself-devotion,--all the ties which unite hearts in the sense of a common\r\ndestiny, grow and flourish. The time has been when, under other forms of\r\nsociety, these private affections found a place in public life; when\r\ndevoted attachments strengthened political connexions. These times are\r\npast, never to return. In the vast and complicated and ever-moving\r\nsociety of our days, general interests and principles, the sentiments of\r\nthe masses, and the combinations of parties, have the entire possession\r\nand direction of public life. The private affections are ties too\r\ndelicate to exercise any powerful influence over the conflicts of that\r\npitiless field. But it is never without serious injury that one of the\r\nvital elements of human nature is uprooted out of any of the fields of\r\nhuman action; and the complete absence of tender and faithful\r\nattachments in that almost exclusive domain of abstract ideas and\r\ngeneral or selfish interests, has robbed political life of a noble\r\nornament and a great source of strength. It is of incalculable\r\nimportance to society that there should be some safe retreat in which\r\nthe affectionate dispositions--I would almost say passions--of the heart\r\nof man may expand in freedom; and that, occasionally emerging from that\r\nretreat, they may exhibit their presence and their power by some\r\nbeautiful examples in that tumultuous region of politics in which they\r\nare so rarely found. But these social virtues must be nursed in the\r\nbosom of domestic life; these social affections must spring from family\r\naffections. Home, the abode of stability and morality, also contains the\r\nhearth at which all our affections and all our self-devotion are\r\nkindled; it is in the circle of the Family that the noblest parts of our\r\nnature find satisfactions they would seek for else in vain; it is from\r\nthat circle that, when circumstances demand, they can go forth to adorn\r\nand bless society.\r\n\r\nNext to the spirit of family, the political spirit is that from which\r\nFrance has now the greatest services to expect, and which she ought to\r\nfoster with the greatest care. The political spirit shows itself in the\r\nwill and the power to take a regular and active part in public affairs,\r\nwithout employment of violence or risk of disturbance. The greater the\r\nspread and cultivation of the political spirit, the more does it teach\r\nmen the necessity and the habit of seeing things as they are in their\r\nexact and naked truth. To see, not what exists, but what they wish; to\r\nindulge complacently in illusions about facts, as if facts would, with\r\nequal complacency, take the form that they desire,--is the radical and\r\ncharacteristic weakness of men still new to political life, and the\r\nsource of their most fatal errors. To see things as they are, is the\r\nfirst and very excellent fruit of the political spirit, and gives birth\r\nto another not less excellent, viz.--that, by learning to see only what\r\nis, we learn to desire only what is possible; the exact appreciation of\r\nfacts begets moderation in designs and pretensions. The political\r\nspirit, true and sincere to itself, becomes prudent and reasonable\r\ntowards others. Nothing inclines men more to moderation than a full\r\nknowledge of the truth; for it is rarely that she throws all her weight\r\ninto one scale. The political spirit is thus naturally led by prudence,\r\nif by no higher morality, to that respect for rights which is not only\r\nits fundamental law and essential merit, but the sole basis of social\r\nstability; since, where law ceases, nothing remains but force, which is\r\nessentially variable and precarious. The respect for rights supposes, or\r\nproduces, the respect for law, the habitual source of rights. The real\r\nand the possible, rights and law, such are the subjects upon which the\r\npolitical spirit is constantly exercised, and which become the habitual\r\nobjects of its inquiry and its veneration. It thus maintains, or\r\nre-establishes, a moral principle of fixity in the relations of\r\nindividuals, and a moral principle of authority in those of the state.\r\n\r\nThe more the value for family ties shall increase at the expense of the\r\nselfishness of an isolated existence, and the more the political shall\r\ngain upon the revolutionary spirit, the more tranquil will the society\r\nof France become, and the more firmly will it rest upon its\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, neither the domestic nor the political spirit would\r\nsuffice for the task. They need the assistance of another and a higher\r\nspirit, whose influence penetrates more deeply than they can do into the\r\nhuman soul. It is peculiar to religion that she has a language for every\r\nindividual; a language which all can understand, the high as well as the\r\nhumble, the happy as well as the unhappy; and that she ascends or\r\ndescends, without an effort, into every rank and region of society. And\r\nit is one of the admirable features of the constitution of the Christian\r\nchurch, that her ministers are not only scattered over, but form an\r\nintegral part of, the whole of society; living as near to the cottage as\r\nthe palace; in habitual and intimate intercourse with the highest and\r\nthe lowest; equally the monitors of greatness and the consolers of\r\nmisery. This tutelary power, spite of the abuses and the faults into\r\nwhich it has been led by its very force and extent, has for ages\r\nexercised a more vigilant and energetic control over the moral dignity\r\nand the dearest interests of man, than any other. Nobody would be so\r\naverse as I should, for the sake of religion herself, to see a revival\r\nof the abuses by which she has been disfigured or corrupted; but I\r\nconfess that I do not fear this at the present day. The principles of\r\nlay supremacy and freedom of thought have definitively triumphed in\r\nmodern society: they may still have some enemies to repel, and some\r\nconflicts to sustain, but their victory is certain; they have in their\r\nfavour the prevailing institutions, manners, opinions, and passions; and\r\nthat general and overwhelming current of ideas and events which flows on\r\nthrough all diversities, obstacles, and perils, in the same direction,\r\nat Rome, Madrid, Turin, Berlin, and Vienna, no less than at London or\r\nParis. For modern society to fear religion, or to dispute her influence\r\nwith acrimony, would therefore be a puerile alarm and a fatal error. You\r\nare surrounded by an immense and excited multitude; you complain that\r\nyou want means to act upon it, to enlighten, direct, control, and\r\ntranquillize it; that you have little intercourse with these men, save\r\nthrough the tax-gatherer and the policeman; that they are given over,\r\nwithout defence, to the inflammatory declamations of charlatans and\r\ndemagogues, and to the blind violence of their own passions. Dispersed\r\namong them, you have men whose express mission and constant occupation\r\nit is to guide their faith, to console their distresses, to show them\r\ntheir duties, to awaken and elevate their hopes, to exercise over them\r\nthat moral influence which you vainly seek elsewhere. And would you not\r\nsecond these men in their work, when they can second you so powerfully\r\nin yours, precisely in those obscure enclosures where you so rarely\r\npenetrate, and where the enemies of social order enter continually, and\r\nsap all their foundations?\r\n\r\nThere is, it is true, a condition attached to the favour and the\r\npolitical efficacy of the religious spirit; it demands sincere respect,\r\nand liberty. I will even confess that the fears and desires of the\r\nreligious party often render them unjust, captious, suspicious,\r\nrancorous, and exacting; that they sometimes fall into the vortex of\r\nthose false, anarchical and chimerical ideas which it is their peculiar\r\nvocation to combat. I will make as large concessions as can be required,\r\nas to the injustice you must expect to submit to, and the precautions\r\nyou will have to take; yet I shall say at the conclusion, as I said at\r\nthe beginning, Do not hold up acrimonious disputes with religion; do not\r\nfear her influences; allow them space and liberty to expand and to act\r\nin the largest and most powerful manner. On the whole, they will\r\ncertainly be more in favour of tranquillity than of strife, and will\r\nassist more than they will embarrass you.\r\n\r\nIf we were under that proximate necessity of acting, which affords a\r\nlight indispensable to those who want to do more than lay down general\r\nprinciples of action, it would be our business to inquire by what\r\npractical means, by what positive institutions or laws, the domestic,\r\nthe political, and the religious spirit might be duly strengthened and\r\ndeveloped in our country. At present I shall only add one word. We\r\ncannot treat with great moral forces as if they were mercenary and\r\nsuspected auxiliaries. They exist by themselves, with their natural\r\nmerits and defects, their unavoidable benefits and dangers. We must\r\naccept them, such as they are; without pretending to be either their\r\nslaves or their tyrants, without giving up everything to them, but also\r\nwithout trying to withhold their just portion. The religious, the\r\ndomestic, and the political spirit are more than ever beneficent, more\r\nthan ever necessary, in our society. Neither social tranquillity, nor\r\nstability, nor order can dispense with their co-operation. Seek then\r\nthat co-operation with sincerity; receive it with a good grace, and\r\nresign yourselves to pay the price of it.\r\n\r\nSocieties, no more than individuals, are exempted from the necessity of\r\npurchasing advantages by efforts and sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet not France deceive herself. Not all the experiments she may try, not\r\nall the revolutions she may make, or suffer to be made, will ever\r\nemancipate her from the necessary and inevitable conditions of social\r\ntranquillity and good government. She may refuse to admit them, and may\r\nsuffer without measure or limit from her refusal, but she cannot escape\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nWe have tried everything:--Republic--Empire--Constitutional Monarchy. We\r\nare beginning our experiments anew. To what must we ascribe their ill\r\nsuccess? In our own times, before our own eyes, in three of\r\nthe greatest nations in the world, these three same forms of\r\ngovernment--Constitutional Monarchy in England, the Empire in Russia,\r\nand the Republic in North America--endure and prosper. Have we the\r\nmonopoly of all impossibilities?\r\n\r\nYes; so long as we remain in the chaos in which we are plunged, in the\r\nname, and by the slavish idolatry, of Democracy; so long as we can see\r\nnothing in society but Democracy, as if that were its sole ingredient;\r\nso long as we seek in government nothing but the domination of\r\nDemocracy, as if that alone had the right and the power to govern.\r\n\r\nOn these terms the Republic is equally impossible as the Constitutional\r\nMonarchy, and the Empire, as the Republic; for all regular and stable\r\ngovernment is impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd liberty--legal and energetic liberty--is no less impossible than\r\nstable and regular government.\r\n\r\nThe world has seen great and illustrious communities reduced to this\r\ndeplorable condition; incapable of supporting any legal and energetic\r\nliberty, or any regular and stable government; condemned to interminable\r\nand sterile political oscillations, from the various shades and forms of\r\nanarchy to the equally various forms of despotism. For a heart capable\r\nof any feeling of pride or dignity, I cannot conceive a more cruel\r\nsuffering than to be born in such an age. Nothing remains but to retire\r\nto the sanctuary of domestic life, and the prospects of religion. The\r\njoys and the sacrifices, the labours and the glories of public life\r\nexist no more.\r\n\r\nSuch is not, God be praised, the state of France; such will not be the\r\nclosing scene of her long and glorious career of civilization,--of all\r\nher exertions, conquests, hopes, and sufferings. France is full of life\r\nand vigour. She has not mounted so high, to descend in the name of\r\nequality to so low a level. She possesses the elements of a good\r\npolitical organization. She has numerous classes of citizens,\r\nenlightened and respected, already accustomed to manage the business of\r\ntheir country, or prepared to undertake it. Her soil is covered with an\r\nindustrious and intelligent population, who detest anarchy, and ask only\r\nto live and to labour in peace. There is an abundance of virtue in the\r\nbosoms of her families, and of good feeling in the hearts of her sons.\r\nWe have wherewithal to struggle against the evil that devours us. But\r\nthe evil is immense. There are no words wherein to describe, no measure\r\nwherewith to measure it. The suffering and the shame it inflicts upon us\r\nare slight, compared to those it prepares for us if it endures. And who\r\nwill say that it cannot endure, when all the passions of the wicked, all\r\nthe extravagances of the mad, all the weaknesses of the good, concur to\r\nfoment it? Let all the sane forces of France then unite to combat it.\r\nThey will not be too many, and they must not wait till it is too late.\r\nTheir united strength will more than once bend under the weight of their\r\nwork, and France, ere she can be saved, will still need to pray that God\r\nwould protect her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n                                LONDON:\r\n\r\n                    Printed by W.
