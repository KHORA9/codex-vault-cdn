VIII.    WASHINGTON, D.C., JANUARY, 1892.    No. 1.\r\n\r\nEntered as second-class matter at the Post Office, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Catalogue contains the titles of all the current official\r\npublications of the United States, including the reports and papers\r\nissued by Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, and other organizations of\r\nthe Government; all the documents printed by order of Congress--that is\r\nto say, the Executive Documents, Reports of Committees, Miscellaneous\r\nDocuments, Journals, and Debates of both Houses; and in addition, the\r\ntitles of all public Acts, Treaties, and Maps.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the titles is alphabetical, under authors' names as\r\nregards special treatises, and under topics as regards Congressional\r\ndocuments. At the same time the Departments, Bureaus, Commissions,\r\netc., are credited with the works issued under their supervision. A\r\nvaluable feature of the work consists in the separate entry of every\r\npaper or contribution contained in Reports, Bulletins, or other\r\npublications of the Government. A general Index at the end of the\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nSubscription price $5.00 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note_: All correspondence relating to the Catalogue or to the\r\npublications of the United States Government should be addressed to the\r\npublishers,\r\n\r\nW. H. LOWDERMILK & CO., 1424-1426 F STREET, WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe beg to announce that we have purchased all the rights in this\r\nperiodical, and will issue it hereafter regularly and promptly early in\r\neach month. Mr. Hickcox will compile and edit the work as heretofore,\r\nand no change will be made in its general character. As rapidly as the\r\nmatter can be prepared we shall print all the numbers necessary to\r\ncomplete the back volumes and send them to the subscribers of those\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this catalogue as a systematic and accurate record of\r\nthe vast, varied, and important number of books and documents issued\r\nannually by Congress and the Departments must be apparent to every\r\nperson who has occasion to consult such publications. The irregularity\r\nof its appearance in the past was due to want of support sufficient to\r\npay its working expenses, and we trust that such reason may not again\r\ndiscourage its prompt appearance, or worse, its discontinuance\r\nentirely. The enterprise is not likely to prove very remunerative, but\r\nwe hope at least to command enough patronage to repay the actual outlay\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nW. H. LOWDERMILK & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above announcement will be gratifying to the patrons of this\r\npublication. The undersigned desires to congratulate those who having\r\nbeen loyal under adverse circumstances have at last a guarantee that\r\nthe catalogue will hereafter reach them regularly, and that the\r\nunfinished volumes will be speedily completed. The seven years of hard,\r\nbut unsuccessful, labor are in a measure redeemed through the\r\nenterprise, intelligence, and liberality of Messrs. Lowdermilk & Co. It\r\nis earnestly requested that former subscribers will promptly and\r\ncordially co-operate with the new publishers in supplying the key, and\r\nthe only key to the varied and comprehensive publications of the United\r\nStates government.\r\n\r\nJ.

Both the French\r\nand American governments promptly gave it the stamp of their approval\r\nby becoming early purchasers. We have bought from the artist all the\r\ncopies remaining in his possession, and offer them as follows:\r\n\r\n    Signed Artist's Remarque Proof, on Japan paper   $100.00\r\n    Ordinary Prints                                    18.00\r\n\r\n    HENRI LE FORT'S GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n    Between the two windows of the late General Grant's library is a\r\n    large portrait bust of Washington, engraved by Henri Le Fort, said\r\n    by Mr. McLane and others to be the best presentment they had seen\r\n    of the great founder of American independence. Mr. Huntington, a\r\n    well-known amateur, possesses three hundred portraits of\r\n    Washington, and he claims that Henri Le Fort's etching is the best.\r\n    This celebrated French aquafortist obtained the following rewards:\r\n    A medal at the Paris Salon in 1881; a medal at the Boston\r\n    Exposition in 1883; a diploma of honor at Caen.; a medal at\r\n    Amsterdam, and one this year at Antwerp.
