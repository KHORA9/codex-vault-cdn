FISHER UNWIN\r\n\r\nPATERNOSTER SQUARE\r\n\r\nMDCCCXCVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[_All Rights reserved._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{vii}\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe following pages have been written from the point of view of the\r\nyear 1896, the greater part of which I spent in Australia.  During the\r\nearlier months of the present year I was in New Zealand, but I was\r\nunable to continue my survey of general Australasian affairs.\r\n\r\nA result of the limitation that I was compelled to impose upon myself\r\nwill be observed in the apparent antiquity of the chapter dealing with\r\nAustralian Federation; but this is not so great as might have been\r\nanticipated, the new Federal Convention having drafted a Bill which is\r\nbased, to a large extent, upon that of 1891.  For purposes of\r\ncomparison I have, with the kind permission of the London agents of the\r\nMelbourne _Argus_, included an article in which that newspaper has\r\nsummarised the provisions of the new Federal Constitution Bill.\r\n\r\nI have also included a brief account of a visit to the Coolgardie\r\ngoldfields which, though alien in purpose from the remaining chapters,\r\nmay not be without interest as a record of personal impressions {viii}\r\nof a Province which has but recently felt the effects of a budding\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me that I should attempt to discuss\r\nAustralasian problems with reference to their applicability to Great\r\nBritain; but I have preferred to leave this task, of which the\r\nimportance cannot be overstated, to persons of greater experience, and\r\nto confine myself to a record of Australasian action and to a\r\ncomparison of the points of similarity or the reverse between the\r\nseveral Provinces. It will be seen, however, that, in some cases, as\r\nwhen dealing, for instance, with the results of payment of members and\r\nwith the powers and privileges of Australasian Upper Houses, I have\r\nnoted differences of conditions which must render deductions by analogy\r\na matter of extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"Liberal\" and \"Conservative\" are used to denote,\r\nrespectively, the more and the less advanced parties in Australasian\r\npolitics, and must not be taken to imply differences in opinion similar\r\nto those prevailing in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would only say that my studies would have been\r\nimpossible in the absence of kindly communicativeness on the part of\r\npoliticians of all shades of opinion; and, on the social side, that I\r\nretain warm feelings of gratitude towards the committees of clubs and\r\nnumerous acquaintances who extended to me the cordial hospitality of\r\nkinship.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

AUSTRALIA_\r\n\r\nContrast between Western Australia and the Eastern Provinces--The\r\nConstitution of South Australia--The alliance between Liberalism and\r\nLabour--Joint action in the face of financial depression: Village\r\nSettlements, Progressive Taxation, the direct encouragement of\r\nproduction--The advocacy of an Elective Executive--The State and\r\nReligious Instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveller who visited Western Australia in 1896 saw a country which\r\nwas enjoying, owing to its goldfields, a phenomenally rapid\r\ndevelopment, with all its attendant advantages of a large increase in\r\npopulation, an expanding revenue, and abundance of employment.  As he\r\npassed to the Eastern Provinces he found himself in the midst of\r\ncommunities which had been shaken to their foundations by the fall in\r\nthe value of their staple products and the collapse of many banking\r\ninstitutions, and were putting forth strenuous efforts to restore the\r\nequilibrium between revenue and expenditure and to make a fresh start\r\nupon the path of prosperity.  These efforts, varying in detail in\r\ndifferent Provinces, have included the imposition {2} of additional\r\ntaxation, provision for the unemployed, and, in some cases, direct\r\nencouragement of production.  The policy pursued by South Australia is\r\nof particular interest as her Constitution gives the freest play to\r\ndemocratic influences.\r\n\r\nThe House of Assembly is elected on the basis of adult suffrage; the\r\nUpper House or Legislative Council by adults possessing a property\r\nqualification consisting of a freehold of the clear annual value of\r\nL50, a registered leasehold of L20, with three years to run or the\r\nright of purchase, or the occupation of a dwelling-house of the clear\r\nannual value of L25.  No property qualification is required in\r\ncandidates for election to either House, and the Members of both Houses\r\nare paid at the rate of L200 per annum.  Adults, upon reaching the age\r\nof twenty-one in the case of the Assembly or possessing the requisite\r\nqualification in the case of the Council, can claim to be placed upon\r\nthe electoral roll and are entitled to vote upon the expiration of six\r\nmonths after registration; upon removal to another constituency, the\r\nvote can immediately be transferred.  Plural voting is forbidden under\r\nheavy penalties, and all the elections, except that for the Northern\r\nTerritory, take place upon the same day.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have enabled the democratic element to obtain a\r\npreponderating voice in both Houses, by a majority of one in the\r\nCouncil and by a considerable majority in the Assembly.  During {3} the\r\nlast three years the Government has been in the hands of the Liberals\r\nunder the Hon. C. C. Kingston, who has included in his cabinet two\r\nformer Premiers in the persons of the Treasurer, the Hon. F. W. Holder,\r\nand the Minister of Education and Agriculture, the Hon. Dr. Cockburn.\r\nThe Ministerialists have had the support of the Labour Party, which has\r\nbeen very successful with its candidates and now holds the balance of\r\npower.  It was formed towards the close of the year 1890, after the\r\nfailure of the maritime strike, in response to the feeling of the\r\nTrades Unions and other labour organisations that their objects would\r\nbe obtained most easily by securing the direct representation of labour\r\nin Parliament.  They were influenced also by the rejection by the\r\nAssembly of Dr. Cockburn's proposals for progressive taxation in spite\r\nof promises made by a majority of the members before their election.  A\r\npolitical programme was, accordingly, drawn up, which is the accepted\r\ncreed of the Labour representatives, who number six in the Council of\r\ntwenty-four and twelve in the Assembly of fifty-four members.  It has\r\nsuccessively been modified, as measures previously advocated have been\r\npassed into law, and contains the following principal items: The\r\ncessation of the alienation of Crown Lands by the substitution of some\r\nsystem of leasing; the remission of the duties on articles not grown or\r\nproduced in the Colony, any resulting deficiency in the revenue to be\r\nmade up by increasing the tax on {4} land values; redistribution of\r\nseats on the basis of population; the encouragement of local industries\r\nby the extension of the State Export Department, so that producers may\r\nbe able to obtain the full benefit of foreign markets; and Federation\r\non a democratic basis.  The Labour Party are opposed most strongly to\r\nthe admission of coloured races and to assisted immigration, on the\r\nground that the former would lower the status of the Australian\r\nworkman, and the latter cause the supply of labour to exceed the demand\r\nand bring misery and destitution upon the poor.  The relations of the\r\nLabour and Liberal members, which have been most cordial, are based\r\nupon mutual interdependence.  The Liberals rely upon the support of the\r\nLabour members; the latter are not strong enough to take office, nor, I\r\nunderstand, do they wish to do so, and must support the Liberals in\r\norder to be able to mould the legislation to the shape that they\r\ndesire.  A prominent member of the Labour Party has thus summarised the\r\nposition: \"The hardest work in connection with some of the measures has\r\nbeen done by Liberals who, though not members of the Party, are\r\ngenerally found working in connection with that body.  But it must be\r\nconceded that most of the planks which have been carried owe their\r\nearly success to the fact of their adoption on the programme of the\r\nUnited Labour Party, and the persistent advocacy and solid votes of its\r\nmembers.\"  The policy of the Party has created a great {5} amount of\r\nbitterness in the country, their successful advocacy of progressive\r\ntaxation on incomes and land values and of other democratic measures\r\nhaving led them to be charged with being inimical to capital as such;\r\nbut the Speaker of the Assembly, who is a Conservative, has stated in a\r\nrecent speech that, \"in speaking of the Labour Party, he wishes to do\r\nso with the greatest respect.  They are a power in the House, and no\r\nGovernment could have retained office in the last Parliament without\r\ntheir support.  The Labour representatives were picked men, clever in\r\ndebate, unremitting in attention to their duties, and a credit to the\r\ndistricts they represented.\"  The leader of the Party is Mr. J. A.\r\nMcPherson, a native of Aberdeen, who migrated to Adelaide in 1882 and\r\nengaged in the printing trade.  He identified himself with Trades Union\r\naffairs, was elected unanimously in 1890 to be Secretary of the Trades\r\nand Labour Council, and still holds that position.  He entered the\r\nAssembly at a bye-election in 1892, and is regarded as one of the\r\nablest and most energetic members of the Labour Party.  Mr. McPherson\r\nhas a popular supporter in Mr. E. L. Batchelor, the colleague of the\r\nPremier in the representation of West Adelaide, who has risen from\r\nsubordinate employment on the Government railways to be, at the age of\r\nthirty, President of the Railway Association and Secretary of the\r\nParty.  Mr. Batchelor is a man of broad views and a keen student, and\r\nhas brought {6} forward a Bill for the institution of the initiative\r\nand referendum, which he considers to be suited to the small population\r\nof South Australia.  The Party are fortunate in their leading men and\r\nshow no signs of cleavage, their only serious difference of opinion\r\nhaving been in regard to the qualifications of Labour candidates.  As\r\nlong as solidarity can be maintained and the present leaders remain in\r\nthe ascendant, no fear need be felt that they will subordinate the\r\ninterests of the community to those of their own class, though they\r\nwould be the first to admit that their main object is to protect the\r\nworking man and to improve his position.\r\n\r\nThe principal measures of the present Administration, such as the\r\nTaxation Acts and the establishment of the Village Settlements and of\r\nthe Produce Export Department, may be said to be the joint product of\r\nthe Liberal and Labour Parties, and may be regarded as an example of\r\nthe policy pursued by a pure democracy in the face of financial\r\ndepression, dislocation of trade, and widespread scarcity of employment.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Act of 1893 which authorised the formation of Village\r\nSettlements was to prevent men of small means, who found difficulty in\r\nobtaining employment, from leaving the country by affording them the\r\nopportunity of settling upon the land and working it co-operatively\r\nwith the assistance of advances from the State.  Its main provisions\r\nwere, that any twenty or more persons {7} might form an association for\r\nthe purpose of taking up a grant of land not exceeding 160 acres per\r\nhead; that the work should be done under the direction of trustees\r\nappointed by members of the association from among their number, who\r\nshould manage the affairs of the village upon principles of\r\nco-operation and equitable division; and that the Commissioner of Crown\r\nLands might advance to any such association out of funds provided by\r\nParliament, an amount not exceeding the sum of L50 for each villager\r\nand not exceeding one-half the cost of the improvements upon the land.\r\nThe advances were to be repaid in ten equal annual instalments, with\r\ninterest computed at 5 per cent. per annum on the moneys for the time\r\nbeing remaining unpaid; but the first of such instalments was not to be\r\npayable until after the expiration of three years from the date of the\r\nadvance.  The formation of settlements on a purely communistic basis\r\nwas rendered possible by Section 78 of the Act, which states that \"the\r\nrules\" (of an association) \"may require payment to a common fund or\r\notherwise as may be determined of all or any part of the earnings of\r\nthe villagers whether earned within the village or elsewhere.\"  Twelve\r\nassociations were formed, mostly on the banks of the Murray, between\r\nthe months of February and August, 1894, but not, with a single\r\nexception, on the lines intended by the Government.  The extreme\r\nscarcity of employment and great poverty at Adelaide and in the\r\nneighbourhood in the early part of that year led them to form {8} the\r\nremainder of persons who were almost entirely destitute.  They were\r\nnecessarily assisted at the start, but did not afterwards receive\r\nadvances until the Government Inspector had certified that they were\r\njustified by the improvements made upon the land.  The action of the\r\nGovernment was illegal throughout, as the Act stated expressly that the\r\nadvances should be made out of funds provided by Parliament, and no\r\nfunds had been voted for the purpose, but it may be condoned on the\r\nground of the extreme urgency of the crisis.  At the expiration of a\r\nyear the limit had been reached in most cases, and further advances\r\nwere indispensable to prevent the immediate collapse of the majority of\r\nthe settlements.  The Commissioner of Crown Lands, accordingly,\r\nintroduced a Bill in which he asked for authority to increase the\r\nadvances, under the same conditions, to L100 per head, and for further\r\npowers of control over the settlements.  The Bill, which was hotly\r\nopposed, was not passed till a Select Committee had been appointed to\r\ninquire on the spot into the conditions and financial prospects of the\r\nsettlements and had reported in its favour.\r\n\r\nThe report, which was dated November 14, 1895, and the evidence upon\r\nwhich it was based, gave a complete picture of the disadvantages under\r\nwhich the settlers laboured and of the drawbacks of the system of\r\ndistribution.  The land selected for the villages was such, it was\r\npointed out, that it could not be cultivated except under irrigation.\r\nThis had {9} necessitated the erection of a costly pumping plant, which\r\nthe settlers had difficulty in purchasing, as they could offer no\r\nsecurity for payment.  When the plant was finally obtained, it was\r\nfound, in some cases, to be unsuitable; in others it could not be\r\nproperly worked in the absence of a capable engineer.  The settlers,\r\nbrought together at haphazard by destitution and not by their knowledge\r\nof agricultural pursuits, had wasted much time and labour through\r\nignorance, incapacity, and insufficiency of proper tools.  They had\r\nlacked a strong controlling hand to direct their operations, and had\r\ndisobeyed the trustees whom they had themselves appointed; and as the\r\ntrustees had little power discipline had been nonexistent, and\r\nquarrels, at several settlements, of continual occurrence.  Order had\r\nbeen restored with difficulty, as the only punishment was expulsion,\r\nupon a decision of the trustees ratified by a vote of the villagers,\r\nand many villagers had voted against expulsion from the fear that they\r\nin their turn might be subjected to a similar penalty.  The\r\narrangements for the distribution of rations also had caused\r\nconsiderable dissatisfaction and led to disagreement between single and\r\nmarried men, as the former felt that the latter received a share of the\r\nstores out of proportion to the work they had done.  The general system\r\nwas, that rations were issued on a sliding scale, according as a man\r\nwas single or had a large or small family, and was to that extent\r\npurely communistic.\r\n\r\n{10}\r\n\r\nThe difficulties encountered by the settlers had been such as would\r\nhave discouraged most men, but, in spite of them, the total number had\r\nonly fallen in eighteen months from 598 to 440, and the majority of\r\nwitnesses expressed themselves satisfied with their lot.  They admitted\r\nthe necessity of further advances, but pleaded that they had a heavy\r\nburden to bear in the cost of machinery, and that their labour,\r\nespecially in the planting of fruit trees, could not yield an immediate\r\nreturn.  The financial position was thus summarised:--The Government\r\nhad advanced L26,000, the unpaid accounts amounted to about L11,000,\r\nand the improvements were valued by the Commissioner of Crown Lands at\r\nL41,000.\r\n\r\nDuring 1896 the further advances had been expended, but the settlements\r\nhad not become self-supporting, and the increased burden of debt and\r\nuncertainty as to the future had caused many of the settlers to become\r\ndisheartened and others to leave in despair.  On the other hand, the\r\nappointment of an expert to exercise the additional powers conferred\r\nupon the Commissioner and to give advice to the settlers, had led to\r\nthe diminution of quarrels and disagreements among them and to a better\r\ndirection of their work.  In view of these facts the Government decided\r\nto close four of the settlements which had been formed upon land\r\nunsuitable to the purpose, owing to the poorness of the soil or the\r\nabsence of facilities for profitable irrigation.  It has been {11}\r\nestimated that the remainder have sufficient irrigable land to maintain\r\na population of about three hundred families, and that they require an\r\naverage of about L25 per settler to make them self-supporting.  A few\r\nenthusiasts alone believe that any portion of the principal of the\r\nloans will ever be repaid; but the Government will have no cause to\r\ncomplain if they receive regular interest on the money.  Some\r\ndifficulty is likely to arise in the disposal of the produce.  There is\r\na considerable market for vegetables on the river, but it will soon be\r\novertaken by the supply.  The settlers will probably devote most of\r\ntheir land to fruit growing and dairying, and will be able to take\r\nadvantage of the Export Department.\r\n\r\nThe settlers should have a better chance of success in the future, as\r\nloafers are gradually being weeded out, and the process is to be\r\ncontinued until the settlers shall have been reduced to such as have\r\nshown an honest desire to make homes for themselves and their families\r\nupon the land.  This course has been rendered possible by the large\r\nexodus of working men to Western Australia, which has reduced the\r\npressure upon the local labour market.  The Government desire to\r\napproximate all the settlements to the level of Murtho, which alone was\r\nformed of persons who had considerable means of their own.  The\r\nsettlers, about twenty in number, put an average of L60 each into the\r\nventure and left good situations out of enthusiasm for the principles\r\nof co-operation.  They are intelligent, well-educated {12} men and\r\nwomen who are bound to put forward every effort to be successful, as\r\notherwise they will be in a worse position than at the start.  They\r\nwork all the land upon the method of joint cultivation on the ground\r\nthat, as different forms of produce are grown, it is of importance to\r\nbe able to concentrate the greater portion of the labour at any point\r\nwhere it may be required, and, under the influence of communistic\r\nideas, give to all an equal share of the results of their united\r\nefforts.  This system would have seemed, from the constitution of human\r\nnature, to be doomed to failure; but an amount of work has been done in\r\nplanting and clearing which testifies to continuous and sustained\r\nlabour, disagreements have been rare, and the settlers, in conversation\r\nwith me, expressed themselves as contented with their lot and confident\r\nof eventual success.  They do not regard themselves as recipients of\r\ncharity, as they have received advances on the same conditions as\r\nholders of Working Men's blocks; on the contrary, they regard\r\nthemselves as pioneers of a new movement, and desire, not only to make\r\nhomes for themselves and their families, but to prove that land can be\r\nworked successfully on a co-operative, almost a communistic, basis.  If\r\nthe Murtho settlers succeed, they will do so by the continued exercise\r\nof mutual forbearance and from the impulse of a common enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe Government appear to have made several {13} grave mistakes of\r\nomission and commission in the formation of the settlements.  They\r\nshould have caused a survey of the Murray lands to be made before the\r\nselection of the sites, and they should have realised that men, united\r\nonly by their destitution, required control and direction, and, as the\r\nmajority were ignorant of agricultural pursuits, constant\r\nsuperintendence of their work.  The system of joint cultivation also\r\nwas entirely unsuited to the class of men who formed the bulk of the\r\nsettlers.  It is true that the Act authorised neither preliminary\r\nsurveys nor the appointment of superintendents, and stated expressly\r\nthat the associations were to be co-operative; but if the urgency of\r\nthe crisis may be taken to have justified the Government in making\r\nadvances without the sanction of Parliament, it would also have\r\njustified such further illegalities as would have benefited the\r\nsettlers and safeguarded the interests of the tax-payers.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of co-operation was inevitable if the settlements were\r\nto be formed upon land which could only be cultivated under irrigation,\r\nin the erection of the pumping plant and the use of water.  It would\r\nalso be advisable in the purchase of seeds, trees and vines, the\r\ndisposal of produce and the common ownership of horses and implements\r\nof husbandry.  But the land might have been cut up into blocks, in\r\norder to enable each settler to obtain the full benefit of his\r\nexertions {14} subject to payment for the services rendered to him by\r\nthe association.\r\n\r\nThe Government are to be congratulated, however faulty their methods\r\nmay have been, upon their attempt to enable the unemployed to make\r\nhomes for themselves upon the land, a great improvement upon the policy\r\nof their predecessors, who wasted thousands of pounds upon unnecessary\r\nrelief works.  They have undoubtedly raised the moral tone of the\r\nsettlers, who make a good impression upon the visitor through their\r\nintelligence and sobriety and the happy appearance of their children,\r\nand one cannot but regret that, owing to the absence of direction, much\r\nof their labour has been absolutely valueless.  The cynic will say that\r\nthe men have every reason to be contented as they are living entirely\r\nupon advances and can rid themselves of all responsibility for the\r\nloans by leaving the settlements; but he forgets that they have\r\nqualified for these advances by hard work and that they never see a\r\nshilling that they can call their own.\r\n\r\nThe whole question must be looked at from the point of view of the\r\nAustralian, who would be horrified at our system, under which indigence\r\nis assumed to be the result of idleness and improvidence and relief is\r\noffered under the most degrading conditions, and expects his Government\r\nto do something to relieve the misery caused by scarcity of employment.\r\nIn South Australia, where adult suffrage and payment of the members of\r\nboth {15} Houses have made the working classes masters of the\r\nsituation, they can compel the Ministry to pay attention to their\r\nwishes.  A step in the right direction, was taken when Village\r\nSettlements were substituted for temporary relief works; but any future\r\nscheme, while affording to men the opportunity of regaining a position\r\nof independence, should compel them to prove their worthiness by their\r\nown individual exertions.\r\n\r\nThe wide application by the Australasian Provinces of the principle of\r\nState action renders them especially liable to violent fluctuations of\r\nprosperity and adversity.  As young countries they have borrowed\r\nlargely for purposes of development, and have constructed expensive\r\npublic works which have greatly increased the demand for labour.\r\nDuring the recent years of depression the Government have been obliged\r\nto discontinue their operations, and have offered less employment at a\r\ntime when the labour market was already overstocked owing to the\r\ncontraction of private enterprise.  Similarly in the case of revenue:\r\nthe receipts from the railways, which are almost universally owned by\r\nthe State, vary proportionately with the returns from taxation, which\r\ndepend in their turn largely upon the condition of trade.  They have\r\nfallen in South Australia from L1,229,598 in 1891-2 to L967,656 in\r\n1894-5, with the result that when the community has been least able,\r\nowing to the diminished returns from other resources of revenue, to\r\nbear additional {16} taxation, further taxes have necessarily been\r\nimposed to meet the interest upon the loans out of the proceeds of\r\nwhich the railways have been constructed.  The Kingston Government,\r\nwhich took office in 1893, had to face a deficit of L200,000, and\r\nimmediately set to work to restore order in the finances.  This they\r\nattempted to do by retrenchment, reducing the expenditure by L100,000\r\nper annum, and by the imposition of fresh taxation.  Succession Duties,\r\na tax on the unimproved value of land and an income tax had already\r\nbeen imposed, a distinction being made in the latter case, between\r\nincomes derived from property and incomes resulting from personal\r\nexertion; but the present Government were the first to introduce the\r\nprogressive principle into the taxes on incomes and land values.  This\r\nlegislation has encountered, as might be expected, the strongest\r\nopposition from the richer members of the community, who protest that a\r\nfeeling of insecurity is produced and capital driven out of the\r\ncountry, but it may be noted that South Australia in 1895 raised money\r\nat 3 per cent. upon exceptionally favourable terms.  The Government\r\nwere compelled to obtain further funds, and showed their desire to\r\nequalise the incidence of the additional taxes by lowering, in spite of\r\nthe opposition of the Labour Party, the exemption from income tax from\r\nL200 to L125 and by increasing the duty on beer, spirits, and other\r\narticles of ordinary consumption.  Income tax is {17} at present at the\r\nrate of 4-1/2d. in the pound up to L800, and of 6d. in the pound above\r\nL800 of taxable amount resulting from personal exertions, and at the\r\nrate of 9d. and 1s. in the pound, respectively, on incomes from\r\nproperty.  Incomes between L125 and L425 enjoy exemption on L125 of the\r\namount.  Taxpayers are required, under penalty of prosecution for\r\nperjury for a false declaration, to furnish annually a statement of all\r\nforms of income that they have enjoyed during the past year, except in\r\nrespect of any share or interest in a registered company; in this case\r\nthe tax, at the rate of a shilling in the pound, is deducted by an\r\nofficer of the company before payment of the dividends to shareholders.\r\nThe higher rate is not paid on either form of income unless it,\r\nseparately, exceeds L800.  The tax on the unimproved value of land is\r\n1/2d. in the pound up to, and 1d. above, the capital value of L5,000, and\r\nis increased by 20 per cent. in the case of absentee owners.  A general\r\nassessment of all the lands in the Colony is made triennially, each\r\nperson's property in each district or township being treated\r\nseparately.  The assessments are then sorted alphabetically, in order\r\nto discover the total holding of each individual which is the basis\r\nupon which the higher or lower rate of taxation is imposed.  Little\r\nobjection is taken to the manner in which the value of the land is\r\nassessed; in the majority of cases the owner and the official of the\r\nGovernment are able to agree as {18} to a fair valuation, and, should\r\nthey fail to do so, an appeal against the valuation may be made to the\r\nTaxation Department, and, if an arrangement be not arrived at, to a\r\nCourt of Law.  The assessment of 1894 led to a large number of appeals,\r\nas the assessors had not realised the enormous fall in value of\r\nagricultural and pastoral land, but all, with a single exception, were\r\nmet to the satisfaction of the appellant by concessions voluntarily\r\nmade by the Department.  Their attention is turned mainly to urban\r\nland, because it is subject to the greatest increase in unimproved\r\nvalue and returns the larger portion of the receipts derived from this\r\nsource.  An incidental advantage of the tax lies in the fact that land\r\nheld by speculators for a rise in value contributes to the revenue\r\nequally with that on which buildings have been erected.  The tax is\r\nrecognised by most people as equitable in principle, but its\r\nprogressive character has brought upon the Ministry the bitterest\r\nanimosity of the landed class, who maintain that it has caused land to\r\nbe given up and to become unsaleable, not so much because the present\r\nburden is intolerable but because it is merely the thin end of the\r\nwedge.  They point to the programme of the Labour Party in which it is\r\nstated that the duty should be taken off certain articles of ordinary\r\nconsumption, the deficiency (which, according to an official estimate,\r\nwould be L310,000 a year) to be made up by increasing the tax on land\r\nvalues, and argue that as the Labour Party hold the {19} Government\r\nunder their thumb, they will be able to enforce compliance with their\r\nwishes.  It is difficult for a stranger to judge to what extent\r\npossessors of capital have actually been deterred from investing it in\r\nland, especially as several important factors have led concurrently to\r\na depreciation in its value, such as the fall in the prices of wheat\r\nand wool, the failure of banks which were interested, directly or\r\nindirectly, in large tracts of country, and bad legislation, passed\r\nsome ten years ago, under which the runs were cut up into blocks too\r\nsmall for the successful prosecution of the pastoral industry.  The\r\nGovernment can point to Pastoral Acts which are admitted to be steps in\r\nthe right direction, and challenge their opponents to show in what way\r\nthey could have raised the L20,000 yielded by the additional Land Tax\r\nwith less burden to the community.  The Absentee Tax lacks similar\r\njustification, as it only brings in L3,600 a year.  It is defended by\r\nthe Premier on the ground that the absentee, as regards his property,\r\nhas the full protection of the administration of the laws, and should\r\ncontribute to the expenditure necessary for the maintenance of the\r\nState; and that he does not do so to the extent of those who live in\r\nSouth Australia and contribute daily to the revenue by means of the\r\nCustoms in all they eat and drink and practically all they put on.  On\r\nthe other hand it is contended that it is of supreme importance to\r\nattract capital to the Colony and that this principle is recognised\r\n{20} in the case of public loans and Treasury bonds, on which no income\r\ntax is charged, and should also be taken into consideration with\r\nreference to private investments in land.  Succession Duty is levied\r\nupon a graduated scale, ranging from 1-1/2 per cent. for L500 to 10 per\r\ncent. for L200,000 and upwards in the case of a widow, widower,\r\nancestor or descendant of the deceased, and from 1 per cent. for any\r\namount under L200 to 10 per cent. for L20,000 and upwards where the\r\nproperty is inherited by a person in any degree of collateral\r\nconsanguinity.  If the heir is a stranger in blood he pays 10 per cent.\r\nwhatever be the value of the property.  In order to promote the\r\ndiffusion of wealth the rate of the tax is based upon the amount\r\ninherited, not upon the total value of the estate.\r\n\r\nIn the relief of the unemployed and the imposition of additional\r\ntaxation, the Ministry, while choosing their methods, have dealt with\r\nproblems which they were bound to face; but they have not confined\r\nthemselves to the negative task of coping with existing difficulties.\r\nThey have realised that greater commercial activity would permanently\r\nbenefit the revenue and add to the demand for labour, and that, in a\r\ncountry like South Australia, it could only be secured by a wider and\r\nmore varied cultivation of the soil, and have, with the hearty support\r\nof the Labour Party, seized every opportunity to encourage production\r\nand develop the export trade.  Farmers already had the advantage of an\r\nAgricultural Bureau at Adelaide, {21} with local branches, which\r\nperiodically disseminated information, and of an Agricultural College\r\nto which they could send their sons, at a small annual charge, or\r\ngratuitously if they could obtain a scholarship; but they were\r\nhindered, when the fall in the value of cereals compelled them to turn\r\ntheir attention to subsidiary industries, by the absence of facilities\r\nfor obtaining a market for subsidiary products.  The limited demand in\r\nthe Colony for butter, fruit, and wine offered insufficient inducement\r\nto farmers and small cultivators.  Previous to 1893, the total export\r\nof butter did not exceed the value of L1,200, but in that year and in\r\n1894 a bonus was offered by the Government, with the result that butter\r\nof the value of L110,000 has since been shipped.  They also formed a\r\nProduce Export Department through which producers can ship their goods\r\nto London, entered into a contract with the Peninsular and Oriental and\r\nOrient Steamship Companies for cheap rates of carriage, and established\r\nin London a Wine and Produce Depot to receive the goods and sell them\r\non the most favourable terms.  A receiving depot has since been\r\nestablished at Port Adelaide and refrigerating machinery and chambers\r\nhave been erected, which enable the Department to receive sheep and\r\nsend them as frozen meat to England.  Butter, wine, frozen meat, and\r\nfruit have been sent to London through the Department, and in some\r\ncases prices have been realised which far surpassed those which could\r\nhave been obtained in {22} the local market.  The scheme is not yet\r\nself-supporting, as, though the charges cover the expenses, the\r\nsalaries of the additional officials required in the Ministry, and an\r\nannual sum of some L3,500 for the maintenance of the Depot in London,\r\nfall upon the revenue of the country; but this expenditure is more than\r\nrepaid by the impetus undoubtedly given to trade which would not\r\notherwise have been afforded owing to the absence of private\r\nenterprise.  The Ministry have undertaken a work in which individuals\r\nwould have had little chance of success, and have enabled small\r\nconsignors to ship their produce at wholesale rates.  Their object also\r\nhas been, in the words of the Minister of Agriculture (Dr. Cockburn),\r\n\"to afford a guarantee of quality.  All goods consigned to the Depot\r\nare examined previous to shipment.  If found to be in good condition\r\nand properly packed, they are sent forward to the London manager with a\r\ncertificate to that effect.  By this system of inspection a barrier is\r\nerected against the export of inferior goods which have an injurious\r\neffect on the reputation of South Australian produce.\"  This latter\r\npoint is of great importance and applies equally as regards the injury\r\nthat might be done by one Province to another, as the British consumer\r\nregards Australian produce generically, and does not distinguish\r\nbetween the output of different Provinces.  Dr. Cockburn called a\r\nconference in 1896, which was attended by representatives from New\r\nSouth {23} Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, to consider how far joint\r\naction might be taken to secure uniformity of output.  The presence of\r\na representative from Victoria enhanced the practical character of the\r\ndeliberations, as that Province has been the pioneer in the movement\r\nand conducts its operations on a very extensive scale.  It was decided\r\nthat the respective Parliaments should be invited to legislate in the\r\ndirection of uniform inspection of frozen meat, dairy produce, wine and\r\nfruit, the adoption as far as possible of a federal brand which would\r\nbe a guarantee of high quality and the joint exhibition of Australian\r\nproduce at some leading agricultural show in England.  The conference\r\nis regarded as a promising sign of the willingness of the Australian\r\nProvinces to act together in matters of common concern.  The\r\ninstitution of the Produce Export Department is favourably viewed by\r\nthe press of South Australia and by the bulk of the community, but,\r\nwhile it is admitted that the initiative of the State has been\r\nsuccessful, the hope is expressed that, when the trade has been firmly\r\nestablished, the scope of State action will be reduced and private\r\nenterprise be allowed to step in.  Such an attitude shows the prevalent\r\ndistrust of State action; in order that it may not be perpetuated, the\r\nmiddleman is to be invited to absorb a portion of the profits which at\r\npresent are gained by the producer.\r\n\r\nThe present Ministry have also legislated on the {24} subject of\r\nworkmen's liens, to protect the wage-earner against an insolvent or\r\ndishonest employer; they have passed a Conciliation Act, to facilitate\r\nthe settlement of industrial disputes, and have established a State\r\nBank to provide for advances to farmers and other producers and to\r\nlocal authorities.  These measures were warmly supported by the Labour\r\nmembers, who tried, unsuccessfully, to enlarge the scope of the State\r\nBank by making it a Bank of Issue.\r\n\r\nAt the General Election in 1896 the Liberals, who were again\r\nsuccessful, advocated certain measures of social reform; continued\r\neconomy of administration; the extension of the functions of the Export\r\nDepartment; Federation on a democratic basis, and the election of\r\nMinistries by Parliament, a proposal which has excited singularly\r\nlittle interest, in spite of the complete change that it would effect\r\nin the methods of government.  The justification for it must be sought\r\nin the local conditions of the Province, which has never taken kindly\r\nto the system of government by party.\r\n\r\nThe tariff question, which has caused a clear line of division in New\r\nSouth Wales, has been settled decisively in favour of protection, and\r\nno distinct issue has taken its place at the recent elections.  In\r\nAdelaide and the neighbourhood the contest may be said to have been\r\nfought in some sense between capital and labour, though among the\r\nsupporters of the Ministry are many men of considerable means; {25} or\r\nbetween individualism and socialism, but that all are socialists to the\r\nextent of believing in State ownership of railways and State control of\r\nwaterworks and water conservation, while the majority are favourably\r\ndisposed to the Export Department, and the average man has no definite\r\nideas on the subject, but views each proposed extension of State action\r\naccording to his opinion of its possible effect upon himself.  The\r\nsuccess of the Liberals was remarkable, as the South Australians are a\r\nfickle people, and usually overthrow the party that is in power; but it\r\nis suggested that the female vote, which has been given for the first\r\ntime, may have been recorded largely in favour of those who had passed\r\nthe Adult Suffrage Act.  However that may be, the Kingston Government\r\nare by no means sure of an extension of three years, as the ties of\r\nparty allegiance are slight except in the case of the Labour members,\r\nand the struggles in the Assembly may resolve themselves, as in the\r\npast, into contests between individual aspirants for office.  The\r\ntendency of the last Parliament was in the direction of a clearer line\r\nof cleavage, but this was due to the cleverness of the present Premier,\r\nwho included in the Cabinet his two strongest opponents whose\r\nopposition had been the more bitter that it was not founded upon\r\ndifferences of political opinion.  Until that time South Australia had\r\nhad forty-one Ministries in thirty-seven years, a constant change of\r\nthe responsible heads of public departments {26} which greatly impaired\r\ntheir efficiency and prevented continuity of administration.  The\r\nabsence of a stable majority in the Assembly gave the opportunity, and\r\nambition and love of power the impetus, to continual struggles for\r\noffice which were wholly unallied with any baser motives, as Australian\r\nstatesmen have obtained an honourable pre-eminence for their rectitude\r\nof character.\r\n\r\nThe intentions of the Government in regard to the substitution of an\r\nelective executive, which have not yet been definitely formulated, may\r\nbe gathered from a speech made by Dr. Cockburn, the principal advocate\r\nof the change, in which he proposed that Ministers, who would continue,\r\nas at present, to be Members of Parliament, should be elected by ballot\r\nby the Assembly at the commencement of each session; that they should\r\nappoint one of their number to be their leader, but should be\r\nresponsible individually to Parliament for their respective\r\ndepartments; and that their corporate responsibility should be limited\r\nto matters affecting the Province as a whole, such as finance or its\r\nrelations with other countries.  The Governor's prerogative of\r\ndissolution would remain unaffected, but as the House would be brought\r\ninto closer touch with the people, dissolutions would be unnecessary\r\nand undesirable.  Dr. Cockburn claimed that his proposal was in\r\naccordance with the natural evolution of Parliamentary Government, and\r\ncontended that, the area of selection being enlarged, the {27} best men\r\nwould be chosen as Ministers from the whole House and the best man for\r\neach office.  Ministers would not be called upon to justify proceedings\r\nof their colleagues which in their hearts they condemned, and private\r\nmembers would be able to exercise greater independence, as they would\r\nnot be called upon to sacrifice their convictions to maintain their\r\nfriends in office, and, being allowed greater freedom on questions of\r\nlegislation, would introduce many bills of an important character.\r\nIntrigue, which was an essential of Party government, would become\r\ndisreputable when resorted to for purposes of personal advancement.\r\nThe objection that certain members would not work together if chosen to\r\nform an administration was met by the fact that men sat in amity on the\r\nTreasury benches who previously had denounced one another to the utmost\r\nof their power.  The distinctive feature of the proposal, therefore, is\r\nthe indirect election of Ministers.  The people elect the\r\nrepresentatives, who, in turn, are to elect certain of their number to\r\nform the Executive.  The first criticism that suggests itself is, that\r\nit is difficult to believe in the rapid elimination of party feeling,\r\nand that it is probable, granted the existence of intrigues among\r\naspirants for office under the present system, that they would be\r\nincreased tenfold when such persons sought to ingratiate themselves,\r\nnot only with prospective Premiers, but with a majority of the members\r\nof the Assembly.  Again, {28} while it is impossible to foresee all the\r\nresults of the change, it may be anticipated that some obvious\r\nadvantages would be counterbalanced by incoherence of policy and\r\nhaphazard legislation, but that a class of men might be induced to come\r\nforward as candidates who are deterred by their horror of continual\r\nparty strife.  Dr. Cockburn stated that no amendment would be required\r\nin the Constitution Act, as, after the election of the Ministers, their\r\nnames would be submitted in the ordinary way to the Governor.  The\r\npresent Ministry also favour the biennial retirement of half the\r\nmembers of the Assembly, in order to secure continuity in its\r\ncomposition, and the institution of the referendum.\r\n\r\nThese proposals are warmly supported by the Labour Party.  They\r\nadvocate elective Ministries on the ground that the people would obtain\r\ngreater control over the Executive, that stability of government would\r\nbe promoted, and that the legislative efficiency of Parliament would\r\ngreatly be increased.  They contrast the rapid dispatch of business by\r\nlocal governing bodies with the waste of time and obstruction which\r\nprevail in legislative assemblies.  The biennial retirement of half the\r\nmembers of the Lower House commends itself to them for the reason which\r\ncauses it to be opposed by men of conservative tendencies, that it\r\nwould do away with the form of minority representation which is\r\nrendered possible in two-member constituencies by the widespread habit\r\nof plumping.  They have {29} been foremost in their advocacy of the\r\nreferendum and the initiative, and one of their representatives, Mr.\r\nBatchelor, has introduced a Bill which provides for the establishment\r\nof the referendum, and contains the striking clause that \"If petitions,\r\nsigned by not less than one-tenth of the electors entitled to vote for\r\nthe election of members of the House of Assembly ... shall be presented\r\nto Parliament praying that legislation shall be initiated on any\r\nsubject, the Attorney-General shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a\r\nBill to give effect to such petition; and such Bill shall be introduced\r\ninto Parliament as a Government measure.\"  Mr. Batchelor believes that\r\nlegislation would be accelerated on subjects which fail to receive\r\nattention because Ministries fear that they might alienate the\r\nsympathies of some of their supporters.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the direct consultation of the people upon a particular\r\nsubject was put into practical effect at the recent elections, when\r\nthey were invited, in the form of an initiative, to say whether they\r\ndesired alterations in the law in regard to education.  Primary\r\neducation in South Australia is free, secular and compulsory.  No\r\nreligious instruction is permitted in the State schools, but the\r\nMinister of Education has the power, on receiving a written request\r\nfrom the parents of not less than ten children who attend any school,\r\nto require the teacher to read the Bible to any pupils who are present\r\nfor that purpose for half an hour before {30} half-past nine, the time\r\nat which the ordinary teaching commences.  The direct reference to the\r\npeople was the result of a Parliamentary resolution instigated by the\r\nadvocates of denominational education, who contended that public\r\nopinion was veering round in their favour and believed that they would\r\nobtain a great accession of strength in the female vote which was to be\r\nexercised for the first time.  It was couched in the form of the\r\nfollowing questions, which were submitted to the electorate on a\r\nseparate voting paper on the occasion of the general elections:--\r\n\r\n1. Do you favour the continuance of the present system of education in\r\nthe State schools?\r\n\r\n2. Do you favour the introduction of religious instruction in the State\r\nschools during school hours?\r\n\r\n3. Do you favour the payment of a Capitation Grant to denominational\r\nschools for secular results?\r\n\r\nThe wording of the first and second questions was calculated to act in\r\nfavour of the opponents of secularism, as the first would probably be\r\nanswered in the negative not only by those who support religious\r\ninstruction but also by many who believe that, in the present state of\r\nthe finances, education should not be free except to such as are unable\r\nto pay for it.  It was not made clear whether it was intended to apply\r\nto the system as a whole or merely to its secular character.  The {31}\r\nsecond question would bring together all who favour religious\r\ninstruction, however much they may disagree among themselves as to the\r\nform in which it should be given.  During the progress of the campaign\r\nthe majority of the candidates declined to express their views upon the\r\nmatter, but stated that they would be prepared to abide by the popular\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give the result of the reference for the whole\r\nProvince with the exception of the Northern Territory, which has a very\r\nsmall electorate:--\r\n\r\n  1.  Yes ... ... 51,744.    No ... ... 17,755.\r\n  2.  Yes ... ... 18,889.    No ... ... 34,922.\r\n  3.  Yes ... ... 13,428.    No ... ... 41,975.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classification of the papers is disappointingly meagre, as no\r\ninformation can be gathered as to the number of supporters of religious\r\nteaching and the capitation grant who were favourable to the other\r\nleading features of the existing system, nor as to the extent to which\r\nthe friends of the capitation grant approved or disapproved of\r\nreligious instruction in the State schools.  The returns show, however,\r\nthat, while 90,000 votes were given for Parliamentary candidates, some\r\n20,000 persons either did not vote at all or gave an informal vote upon\r\nthe distinct issue, and that less than one-fifth pronounced against the\r\nAct as it stands.  The condemnation of the capitation grant is still\r\nmore emphatic, and if the {32} supporters of religious teaching have\r\nless cause for dissatisfaction, it may be noted that in no constituency\r\nwere the affirmative in excess of the negative replies, and that as the\r\ntotal number of votes given upon the first question was far larger than\r\nthat on the second and third, thousands who had voted affirmatively\r\nupon the first must have considered that they had thereby returned a\r\nnegative reply to the others and should be reckoned as additional\r\nopponents of religious instruction and of the capitation grant.  It is\r\nalso noteworthy that, contrary to the general expectation, the country\r\ndistricts gave a considerably higher percentage of votes in favour of\r\nthe present system than the seven constituencies which include Adelaide\r\nand its immediate neighbourhood.  The advocates of religious\r\ninstruction have announced that they intend to continue their efforts\r\nto win over the majority to their views; in the meanwhile, they will\r\nrealise that the process must be slow and will stir up the various\r\nagencies of the churches to increased activity in a sphere which is\r\nparticularly their own.\r\n\r\nThe secular character of State education, which dates from 1851, cannot\r\nbe shown to have had evil effects upon the conduct of the working\r\nclasses, who almost universally respect and obey the law and have an\r\nair of confident independence which has been fostered by manhood\r\nsuffrage, high wages and a high standard of comfort.  South Australia\r\nwas fortunate in her original settlers, and has always {33} attracted a\r\ngood class of immigrants.  At present great benefit is accruing from\r\nthe rapid development of Western Australia, which has relieved the\r\npressure upon the labour market and increased the demand for South\r\nAustralian goods.  The latest Savings Bank returns give the total\r\namount deposited as L2,713,000 and the number of depositors as 88,876,\r\na very satisfactory rate for a population of about 320,000, especially\r\nwhen it is considered that the working classes also have large\r\ninvestments in Friendly and Building Societies.  In conclusion, the\r\nvisitor cannot but be struck by the entire absence of squalid poverty\r\nand of overcrowding in tenements and by the orderliness of the people\r\nand the high average of prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{34}\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_DEMOCRACY AND ITS SAFEGUARDS IN NEW SOUTH WALES_\r\n\r\nThe necessity for safeguards against financial extravagance and\r\npolitical pressure--The Crown Lands Act--The appointment of independent\r\nRailway Commissioners--The Standing Committee on Public Works--The\r\nPublic Service Board--The unemployed, their numbers and treatment--The\r\ndemocratisation of the constitution--The Labour Party, its history,\r\nsuccesses and aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of New South Wales, as of several other Australian\r\nProvinces, lived for many years in a fool's paradise.  They had\r\nreceived a magnificent inheritance in the land and were able, owing to\r\nthe proved mineral resources of the country, to draw upon a practically\r\ninexhaustible fund in the willing advances of British capitalists.  All\r\nclasses vied with one another, especially in Victoria, in the\r\nextravagant loans and expenditure which caused the crisis of 1893, the\r\ngreatest blessing, as many think, that has ever befallen Australia.\r\nRegardless of the burdens it was imposing upon future generations, the\r\nParliament of New South Wales, with which I shall be dealing\r\nprincipally in the present chapter, {35} constructed unnecessary public\r\nworks, allowed the Civil Service to be packed with the friends and\r\nrelations of those in power, and authorised roads and bridges almost at\r\nthe whim of each individual member.  This condition of things could not\r\ncontinue indefinitely: on the one side, a rapidly increasing debt, on\r\nthe other, an enormous army of civil servants, aspirants for employment\r\non public works and local claimants for a share of the expenditure of\r\nloan funds, who were able, on account of the wideness of the franchise\r\nand the numerous functions undertaken by the Government, to bring\r\npressure to bear upon the Ministry through their representatives in the\r\nAssembly.  It was essential that the power to borrow should be\r\ncurtailed; essential also that the possibilities of political pressure\r\nshould greatly be diminished.  The former object could only be achieved\r\nat the cost of a comparative loss of credit, the latter by a wise\r\nrecognition on the part of the electorate of the dangers of unfettered\r\nState action under a democratic constitution.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of indebtedness cannot justly be laid solely to the\r\ncharge of the popular representatives, as, though the Legislative\r\nCouncil has occasionally resisted Loan Bills, it does not appear to\r\nhave realised the dangers of the proposed expenditure.  Nor was it in\r\nhuman nature that it should have opposed the construction of railways\r\nby which its members, mostly landholders, would enormously {36} be\r\nbenefited.  Were their lands to be resumed by the Government, they\r\nwould obtain an enhanced price for them; in any case, many of them\r\nwould gain a large unearned increment.  The members of the Council who\r\nare nominated for life, similarly with Labour members, lawyers, and\r\nothers who represent particular sections in Parliament, have been\r\nactive mainly where their own interests have been concerned.  In\r\npursuance of their right to reject measures of taxation, they threw out\r\nSir George Dibbs' Income-Tax Bill in 1893 and, two years later, Mr.\r\nReid's Land and Income-Tax Assessment Bill.  As landholders they\r\nobjected to a land tax, and to an income tax as representatives of the\r\nwealth of the community.  Nor has the extravagance been due to payment\r\nof members, which is regarded by some as the cause of all the evils of\r\nAustralia, as it was not inaugurated until after the greater part of\r\nthe indebtedness had been incurred; but the necessity for political\r\nsafeguards has been accentuated by the entrance into Parliament of men\r\nwho, owing to their pecuniary circumstances, are less able to resist\r\nthe demands of their electors, are deeply interested in the\r\npostponement of dissolutions, and are more dependent upon their\r\nre-election.  It would be equally false to attach any blame to the\r\nLabour Party, which did not make its appearance in the Assembly until\r\n1891.\r\n\r\nWhile the great diminution of borrowing and consequently of the\r\nconstruction of public works has {37} lessened the opportunities for\r\nundue political influence, many still exist, and the number would have\r\nbeen far greater in the absence of recent legislation.  How numerous\r\nthese opportunities might be, may be gauged from the fact that,\r\nexclusive of some 10,000 railway employes, 20,000 persons were formerly\r\nin the service of the State at an annual salary of L2,600,000; that\r\nmany thousands are tenants of the Crown, liable to be propitiated by\r\nthe reduction of their rent; that nearly half the population live in\r\nunincorporated districts, in which the local expenditure is met out of\r\nnational funds, and that the unemployed continually clamour for rations\r\nand employment upon relief works, the receipt of which, under the\r\nexisting law, does not entail political disfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe first legislative recognition of this danger is seen in the Crown\r\nLands Act of 1884, which constituted Local Land Boards, consisting of\r\nnot more than three members to be appointed by the Governor in Council,\r\nwhich were to consider all applications for land, insure the due\r\nfulfilment of the conditions, residential or other, which are attached\r\nto different forms of tenure, and appraise the rents of pastoral leases\r\nand the rate of compensation for improvements.  The practice of the\r\nMinistry has been to appoint as chairman of a Board some experienced\r\nofficial of the Crown Lands Department and, as his colleagues, persons\r\nrecommended by the residents in the district.  I am assured that this\r\nsystem of Land {38} Boards, whose decisions are subject to an appeal to\r\nthe Land Court, has worked satisfactorily and that confidence has been\r\npromoted by the publicity of the proceedings.  A full statement is\r\npublished periodically, for each district, of the areas still open for\r\nsettlement and of the conditions under which they can be taken up: the\r\nLand Boards have to inquire into the _bona fides_ of the applicants.\r\nThe question of the remission or suspension of the payment of rent is\r\none of great difficulty in countries in which the Crown is the largest\r\nlandholder.  If a discretionary power is given to the Ministry,\r\npolitical pressure can be brought to bear upon them by tenants through\r\ntheir Parliamentary representatives; if it be withheld, great hardship\r\nmay ensue.  This is particularly the case in Australia, where the value\r\nof a property may greatly be reduced by the devastations of rabbits or\r\nother pests and the consequent deterioration in the grazing capability\r\nof the land, or by a fall in the price which can be obtained for stock\r\nor wool.  The Land Acts of New South Wales recognise either of the\r\nabove causes as sufficient to entitle a pastoral lessee to a\r\nreappraisement of his rent by a Land Board, and permit the suspension\r\nof annual payments for one year in the case of holders of land under\r\nconditional purchase who reside upon it, but compel the vast majority\r\nof tenants of the Crown to abide strictly by the conditions of their\r\nagreements, under pain of the forfeiture of their holdings.  Cases of\r\nindividual {39} hardship, which would engage the attentions of a\r\nprivate landlord, are, in the avoidance of a greater evil, left without\r\nredress.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 two further measures were passed with a similar object, the\r\nGovernment Railways and Public Works Acts.  In a book recently\r\npublished by authority of the Government,[1] to which I have to\r\nacknowledge my indebtedness, it is stated that the re-organisation of\r\nthe railway administration was rendered necessary by the excess of\r\npolitical influence, the absence of expert control, and the\r\nconstruction of new lines without sufficient regard to the prospects of\r\nan early remunerative traffic, which had caused the capital expenditure\r\nto have been nearly doubled while the net earnings had not increased.\r\nUnder the former Act, accordingly, the Government railways and\r\ntramways, which are now about 2,600 miles in extent and have been\r\nconstructed at a cost of thirty-eight millions, were vested absolutely\r\nin a Board of three Railway Commissioners to be appointed by the\r\nGovernor in Council.  In order that their independence might be\r\nsecured, they were made irremovable except for misbehaviour or\r\nincompetency, and then only upon a vote of both Houses, and their\r\nsalaries were charged on the consolidated Revenue Fund, which was\r\npermanently appropriated to the required extent.  They were entrusted\r\nwith the general management of the railways and with the {40}\r\nappointment, subject to the regulations governing entrance into the\r\npublic service, and dismissal, of all clerks, officers and employes,\r\nwhose salaries and wages, however, are subject to the vote of\r\nParliament.  The Government were fortunate in securing the services of\r\na very competent senior commissioner, who, with his colleagues, has\r\nbeen able, without lowering the rate of wages, to reduce the percentage\r\nof working expenses to gross revenue from 66.69 to 54.46 per cent., and\r\nhas increased the net return on capital from 2.85 to 3.60 per cent.\r\nThe result is the more satisfactory that the railways are not worked\r\nsolely with a view to profit, but in such a manner as to benefit the\r\npopulation as a whole and to encourage the remote farmer and\r\npastoralist.  The experience of the other Australasian Provinces which\r\nestablished similar Boards proves it to be essential that the\r\ncommissioners should not only possess great commercial ability, but be\r\nstrong men who are able to withstand the pressure to which they will be\r\nsubjected and are regardless of the attacks which are likely to follow\r\nupon their refusal of favours.\r\n\r\nThe Public Works Act provides for the appointment of a Parliamentary\r\nStanding Committee on Public Works, which is to consider and report\r\nupon all proposals for the construction of public works, except such as\r\nare connected with the military or naval defences of the Province,\r\nwhere the estimated cost exceeds L20,000, and upon any similar {41}\r\nproposals involving a smaller expenditure, which may be submitted to it\r\nby the Governor in Council.  It consists of thirteen persons, eight\r\nmembers of the Assembly and five of the Council, who are appointed for\r\nthe duration of a Parliament and receive remuneration at the rate of\r\nthree guineas for each sitting and thirty shillings a day for\r\ntravelling expenses where the sittings are held at a distance from\r\nSydney.  The Secretary for Public Works nominates an equal number from\r\nboth sides of the House after consultation with the leader of the\r\nOpposition; in the majority of cases these nominations are challenged\r\nand the appointments are made by ballot of the whole House, which,\r\naccording to trustworthy information, leads to disreputable\r\nnegotiations between those who desire the additional salary and those\r\nwho are able to confer it.  It has been suggested recently by a Royal\r\nCommission, which reported that \"the expenditure on public buildings is\r\nin excess of what is necessary, owing to the system of political\r\ninterference, which is responsible for the erection of special post\r\noffices in country townships where shops could be used, and of costly\r\ncourts of justice and other structures which are not required,\" that\r\nall proposals for public expenditure involving a probable outlay of\r\nmore than L5,000, should be considered and reported on by a committee\r\nconsisting of the permanent heads of the Public Works Department, the\r\nTreasury, and the Department on whose behalf the proposed {42}\r\nexpenditure would occur.  But the adoption of this suggestion would not\r\ngo to the root of the evil, which lies in the manner in which small\r\npublic works of a purely local character are carried out in rural\r\ndistricts.  In the early days of the Province the Government, in order\r\nto widen the area of settlement, constructed all roads, bridges, and\r\nother local works out of national funds.  As population increased,\r\nmunicipalities were established, which rated themselves for local\r\npurposes and received subsidies from the Government proportionately to\r\nthe amounts thus raised; but the Act of 1867, which contemplated the\r\nextension of the system, provided that new municipalities, either\r\nboroughs or municipal districts, could only be created upon the receipt\r\nof a petition signed by a stated proportion of the prospective\r\nratepayers.  The Councils of such municipalities have the right to levy\r\nrates not exceeding two shillings in the pound in one year upon all\r\nrateable land within their borders, and receive from the Government\r\nduring the first five years a sum equal to the whole amount actually\r\nraised in this manner or from any other specified source of revenue.\r\nThis is gradually diminished until, at the end of fifteen years, no\r\nfurther subsidies are received, except such as have specially been\r\nvoted by Parliament.  At the present time, owing to the absence from\r\nthe Act of any compulsory provision, the incorporated districts of the\r\nProvince comprise somewhat more than half of the {43} population, but\r\nless than one hundredth of the total area.  Successive Governments have\r\nrecognised the evil, but have failed to pass a satisfactory Amending\r\nAct which would establish some form of local government in the\r\nunincorporated areas and compel them to pay a fixed portion of their\r\nlocal expenditure.  The estimates for such expenditure are framed by\r\nthe Public Works Department, and are based upon the reports of its\r\nresident engineers and of the agents of the Government Architect.  The\r\nopportunity of the pushing rural member occurs upon the expenditure of\r\nthe unappropriated sum of money which is left in the hands of the\r\nMinister, to meet requirements that cannot be foreseen; in this\r\nconnection, members may threaten a withdrawal of their support and\r\nministers may seek to win over new adherents.  The reports of such\r\nactions are probably much exaggerated, as there are many who delight in\r\nvilifying the Assembly, but the popularity of a rural representative\r\ndepends undeniably on the number of public works which the Government\r\ncarry out in his district.\r\n\r\nThe next important step was the appointment, early in 1895, of a Royal\r\nCommission to inquire into the Civil Service, which reported that the\r\nAct of 1884, under which a Civil Service Board of five persons had been\r\nconstituted, had failed in its purpose, because the Board consisted\r\nusually of men who had other duties to perform and had not the power to\r\nfix the salaries or control the service, and {44} because the right was\r\nreserved to ministers in special cases to make appointments without\r\neither examination or probation.  The Commissioners found that, owing\r\nto the absence of any well-ordered system of classification, the\r\ngrossest inequalities and anomalies existed in the salaries of offices\r\nattached to different departments or even to the same department, as,\r\nto take an extreme case, that, in the department of the Government\r\nArchitect the official who designed the Crown Lands office and\r\nsupervised its erection was receiving less remuneration than the\r\nprincipal messenger; and that, while the service contained many\r\nhigh-minded and able officials, there were cases where incompetency,\r\nneglect of duty, and even drunkenness had formed no bar to continued\r\nemployment.  In accordance with their recommendations, founded on the\r\nbelief that Parliament could not directly cope with the matter, an Act\r\nwas passed in 1895 which constituted a Public Service Board of three\r\npersons, to be appointed for a period of seven years in the same way,\r\nand with the same securities for independence, as the Railway\r\nCommissioners.  The Board was charged with the duty of making a\r\nthorough investigation, which was periodically to be repeated, into the\r\nworking of each department, and of fixing the number, grade, and salary\r\nof the officials.  Future appointments and promotions were to be made\r\nby the Governor in Council, upon a certificate of the Board, subject to\r\nthe regulations in regard to competitive {45} examinations and an\r\nobligatory period of probation upon entrance into the service.  As the\r\nCommission had reported that it should be possible to effect an annual\r\nsaving of a quarter of a million, special importance attached to the\r\nprovisions which enabled the Board to dispense with the services of\r\nthose who could not usefully and profitably be employed, such persons\r\nto receive gratuities on a fixed scale upon their retirement.  The\r\nBoard were sitting during my stay in Sydney and had to suffer from the\r\nopen hostility of those who had been affected by their decisions and\r\nfrom abusive correspondence in the press.  Their impartiality was\r\nimpugned, and they were charged with allowing themselves to be\r\ninfluenced by the wishes of Ministers; but when the unpleasant task of\r\nretrenchment has been completed, they will doubtless carry on a work of\r\npractical utility unhampered by criticisms and accusations.\r\n\r\nNo serious attempt has yet been made to deal with the problem of the\r\nunemployed, which is the more urgent from the fact that the receipt of\r\nrelief does not disfranchise the recipient.  Its origin must be sought\r\nin the extensive Public Works policy of the past, which absorbed\r\nimmigrants who would otherwise have settled on the land.  In 1887 the\r\nmajority of the great undertakings had been completed, and many\r\nthousand men, thus thrown out of employment, drifted into Sydney and\r\nled the Ministry to establish a casual labour Board, which {46} was\r\ndiscontinued after a year, but spent L252,000 in the relief of\r\ndestitution.  In the following years other causes intensified the\r\ndistress: the great strikes of 1890 destroyed confidence and deterred\r\nenterprise; the Broken Hill strike and the recent strike at Newcastle\r\nhave had similar effects, the latter having struck a blow at the export\r\ntrade in coal, which was gradually recovering from earlier\r\ndisturbances; the collapse of 1893 cast adrift a large number of\r\nmechanics and clerks whose services had been required during the period\r\nof inflation, the fall in the price of wool caused a shrinkage in\r\nprivate expenditure, and the severe drought experienced during the\r\nlatter part of 1895 had disastrous effects on the labours of those\r\nemployed in mining, pastoral, and agricultural pursuits.  To meet the\r\ndifficulty a Labour Bureau was established at Sydney in 1892, in order\r\nthat the unemployed might be able to register themselves and might be\r\nhelped to obtain work; but, while much has been done in this direction,\r\nno more satisfactory solution has been found for the problem, as a\r\nwhole, than continual relief works, which attract the destitute from\r\ncountry districts and other Provinces, and afford merely temporary\r\nalleviation of the distress.  According to a recent report of the\r\nSuperintendent of the Bureau, to whom I am indebted for information,\r\nL201,000 were spent during the year ending February last (in a\r\npopulation of a million and a quarter) upon works in {47} aid of the\r\nunemployed, an expenditure of which two items alone, L50,000 for forest\r\nthinning and L35,000 for railway deviations, can be supposed to have\r\nhad any other justification.  Mr. Creer told me in June, 1896, that the\r\ndaily attendance at the Bureau had averaged for several months 1,500 to\r\n2,500, but had decreased latterly to 300 to 500; that many who had been\r\ngiven employment had abandoned it, and that, where a large number had\r\nbeen working together, he had had much trouble owing to their rowdiness\r\nand bad behaviour.  On this point the Premier, Mr. Reid, stated that he\r\nhad been informed, on good authority, that there were not more than\r\n1,500 genuine unemployed in Sydney, but admitted, quoting his\r\ninformant, that \"there are also hundreds of men who do little or no\r\nwork\" and \"a large number of men who have been identified with the\r\nunemployed agitation for the past ten years, and who appear to delight\r\nin its existence, as no doubt they consider it a capital cover to pose\r\nas _bona-fide_ workmen out of employment.\"  The conduct of the latter\r\nis mainly due to the weakness of successive Ministries, which have\r\nfailed to resist pressure and may almost be said to have encouraged\r\nidleness.  Such encouragement is also provided in the climate of\r\nSydney, which enables men to sleep in the open for nine months of the\r\nyear without discomfort.  Mr. Creer proposed that those who profess to\r\nbe willing to work should be employed upon schemes of water\r\nconservation and {48} irrigation in the drier parts of the Province,\r\nwhich should be carried out by gangs of men under strict supervision,\r\nand that the confirmed loafers should be placed in Industrial Homes and\r\nbe compelled to choose between work and starvation.  The present\r\nGovernment have established thirty-five branches of the Labour Bureau,\r\nwhich will tend to prevent the unemployed from flocking into the\r\nMetropolis.  But the bulk of the unemployed at Sydney are demoralised\r\nby idleness and ignorant of agricultural pursuits, and can only be\r\ndealt with by a strong Minister who, regardless of political\r\nconsequences, will discontinue the system of indiscriminate relief and\r\ntreat the confirmed loafers with the greatest severity.\r\n\r\nDemocratic government, actively opposed by some and detested by most of\r\nthe more educated members of the community, is firmly established in\r\nNew South Wales, and is essential to the happiness of the people there\r\nas elsewhere in Australasia, in the general prevalence of purely\r\ncommercial instincts and the absence of a landed class which is bound\r\nby inherited traditions to take an interest in its dependents.  Of\r\nrecent years the democratic movement has been more rapid: payment of\r\nMembers of the Assembly dates from 1889, Sir George Dibbs passed\r\nmanhood suffrage in 1893, and Mr. Reid seeks to curtail the power of\r\nthe Upper House.  A great impetus has been given by the Labour members,\r\nwhose numbers and influence entitle {49} them to be regarded as one of\r\nthe most important political factors in the Province.  The reason for\r\nthe formation of a separate party has thus been explained to me by one\r\nof its members: the prominent men among the working classes, who were\r\nanxious to promote progressive legislation, were hampered by the fact\r\nthat they disagreed upon the question of the tariff, and that their\r\nvotes were, consequently, useless as far as the advancement of such\r\nlegislation was concerned.  The line of cleavage in the Assembly was\r\nbetween Protectionists and Free Traders; reactionary and advanced views\r\nwere represented on both sides of the House.  They felt, therefore,\r\nthat labour would be powerless unless the issue of the tariff were\r\nexplicitly sunk and a programme put forward which would concentrate the\r\nvotes of the working classes.  In their campaign they were doubtless\r\naided by the Act passed for the payment of members, and by the failure\r\nof the maritime and other strikes, which impressed Trades Unionists\r\nwith the necessity of seeking to attain their ends by other means.  A\r\nprogramme was, accordingly, drawn up, of which the principal items\r\nwere, in order of importance, Electoral Reform, the Right of Mining for\r\nGold on Private Land, and the Taxation of Land Values; it was adopted\r\nat the elections of 1891 by a large number of candidates who came\r\nforward in the Labour interest and succeeded in winning thirty-four\r\nseats.  Upon the meeting of {50} Parliament it was decided by the\r\nParty, although the majority had Protectionist leanings, that support\r\nshould be accorded to Sir H. Parkes, who had made Electoral Reform the\r\nprincipal item of his policy.  A few months later he was defeated on\r\nthe Coal Mines Regulation Bill, and the votes of the Labour Party were\r\ntransferred to his Protectionist successor, Sir G. Dibbs, who also\r\nfavoured Electoral Reform; but, in the meanwhile and subsequently, many\r\nof the Labour members refused to leave their views on the tariff in\r\nabeyance, with the result that the number of those who adhered\r\nstaunchly to the programme was reduced to five or six.  In spite of\r\nthese defections, the first two items in the programme were carried and\r\nthe Taxation of Land Values took the foremost place.  At the 1894\r\nelections the Labour Party had been much discredited, but secured\r\nfifteen representatives, in the Assembly of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, who were pledged to the so-called \"solidarity\" vote.\r\nTheir support was then transferred to Mr. Reid, the present Free Trade\r\nPremier, who was in favour of the Land Tax, which they enabled him to\r\ncarry in 1895, though only after a further election, caused by the\r\naction of the Upper House, at which they carried three additional\r\nseats.  At present the Labour Party are concentrating all their efforts\r\nupon the abolition of the Legislative Council and the substitution for\r\nit of the referendum, which they regard as a necessary preliminary to\r\nthe passage of {51} advanced legislation, and are prepared to accept,\r\nas a step in the right direction, Mr. Reid's proposal that the tenure\r\nof the members of the Council who are nominated for life should be\r\nreduced to a period of years, and that all-important Bills, upon which\r\nthe Assembly and Council have failed to agree in two consecutive\r\nsessions, should be referred to a plebiscite.  They argue that when the\r\nelectors realise that the Council can only delay legislation for one\r\nsession, and that the issue is then directly referred to them, they\r\nwill sweep it away as a mere obstacle in the path of progress.  It may\r\nbe doubted whether the adoption of the plebiscite would have the\r\nresults that they anticipate, but it cannot be doubted that a compact\r\nbody of representatives, aiming at the democratisation of the\r\nconstitution and willing to support whichever party makes the highest\r\nbid for their votes, have but to remain united to achieve their object,\r\nespecially when it is in accordance with the natural evolution of\r\nParliamentary government.  The Labour members have a definite programme\r\nupon which all their efforts are concentrated, but are chary of giving\r\ntheir views upon other questions, as their votes, in consequence of the\r\ncommon pledge, will depend on the decision of the majority of the\r\nparty.  Great indignation is expressed at the \"caucus\" meetings, at\r\nwhich the votes of all are thus determined; but it is difficult to see\r\nwherein the conduct of the Labour members differs essentially {52} from\r\nthat of the representatives who support one of the principal parties in\r\nthe State.  In both cases certain main objects are sought and\r\nindividual convictions are, on occasion, subordinated to their\r\nattainment; the only difference is that, in the latter case, the action\r\nis taken voluntarily in order to maintain a party in power; in the\r\nformer, its expediency is determined by the majority of those who are\r\nunited in a common purpose.  On the other hand it must be admitted that\r\nthe Labour Party display, at present, all the irresponsibility of\r\nindependence, and have often acted in such a manner as to justify the\r\nhostility of their opponents.  During my stay at Sydney they attempted,\r\non one occasion, to convert the Assembly into a court of judicial\r\nappeal; on another, to interfere with the actuarial calculations of\r\ninsurance societies.\r\n\r\nThe importance of political safeguards is accentuated not only by the\r\naccelerated movement in the direction of constitutional change, but by\r\nthe increasing belief in the efficacy of State control and state\r\ninterference.  During the session of 1896 the Government brought\r\nforward measures dealing with the conservation of water, the public\r\nhealth, adulteration, and the regulation of coal mines and of factories\r\nand workshops, the passage of which would necessitate a considerable\r\nincrease in the number of State officials; and the Labour Party, the\r\ntransference of whose support would place the Ministry in danger of\r\ndefeat, have shown, by their votes in the past, {53} their conviction\r\nthat all new public works which are in the nature of a monopoly, should\r\nbe constructed and owned by the State.\r\n\r\nThe scope of my inquiries in New South Wales led me in directions which\r\nhave caused me to emphasise the darker sides of political life; but I\r\nwish to guard against the inference that similar shadows could not have\r\nbeen found elsewhere, and have touched upon the subject in my general\r\nobservations upon Australasian tendencies.  In fact, I may add, I was\r\ndrawn into my particular line of study at Sydney by the knowledge that\r\nNew South Wales had taken especial precautions, except in regard to the\r\nunemployed, against the evils which I have here sought to summarise.\r\nThe predominant note in that Province is one of hopefulness: the vast\r\npastoral, mineral, agricultural, and other resources of the country,\r\nthe harbour at Sydney which renders it the natural centre of the\r\nforeign trade of the Continent, and the rapidity of the recovery from\r\nthe crisis of 1893, are calculated to inspire confidence in the future;\r\nas are the high average wages of the working classes, the low cost of\r\nliving, and the short hours of labour.  But the most impressive sign of\r\na healthy national life is the readiness of the democracy to recognise\r\nthe dangers inherent in its rule, and to divest itself voluntarily of\r\nsome of its powers, in the interests of pure and upright government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"New South Wales; the Mother Colony of the Australias.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{54}\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_PROBLEMS OF QUEENSLAND_\r\n\r\nThe agitation of Central and Northern Queensland for separation from\r\nthe South--The \"Kanaka\" traffic--White and coloured labour on the\r\nplantations--The Sugar Works Guarantee Act--The irregularity of\r\nemployment in the sugar and pastoral industries--The conditions and\r\nopinions of the shearers--Assistance to dairymen and producers of\r\nfrozen meat--The Labour Party, its history and prospects--Criticisms of\r\nthe Government--The principles of State action.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Provinces of Australia, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide\r\nare not only the political capitals, but have become naturally, from\r\ntheir geographical position and other advantages, the points of\r\ndeparture of the trunk lines of railway and the centres of commercial\r\nand intellectual activity.  In the case of Queensland, Brisbane, which\r\nwas selected as the capital because settlement was almost confined to\r\nits neighbourhood, had to compete with several other good harbours; it\r\nis situated at the south-eastern extremity of a vast territory, and is\r\nconnected only by sea with the northern parts above Bundaberg.  The\r\nexistence of this means of communication caused successive Governments\r\nto {55} postpone the construction of a coastal railway in favour of\r\nlines running from East to West which would promote the development of\r\nthe pastoral resources of the interior by affording access to the\r\nnearest port; but these lines, which start from Brisbane, Rockhampton,\r\nand Townsville, and have a respective length of 483, 424, and 235\r\nmiles, have tended, by increasing the importance of the latter places,\r\nto foster in their inhabitants a feeling of jealousy at the supremacy\r\nof the former and of antagonism of interests with the South.  The\r\nclimatic conditions also are divergent: the Centre and South are\r\nsemi-tropical; the North, which lies wholly within the tropics,\r\ncontains a low fringe of fertile land along the coast, suitable for the\r\ncultivation of sugar, and the cause of the constant struggles which\r\nhave surrounded the question of the employment of coloured labour.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Queensland as a separate Province dates from 1859,\r\nand was at once followed by an extension of population to the Northern\r\ndistricts, and a few years later by the growth of a demand for\r\nseparation, which culminated in 1871 in a petition to the Crown, in\r\nwhich the desire was expressed that the country to the North of the\r\nDawes Range, which lies between Gladstone and Bundaberg, should be\r\ncreated into a new Province, on the ground that the absence of regular\r\ncommunication between the capital and the Northern settlements rendered\r\ngood government and the administration {56} of justice very difficult\r\nand uncertain.  During the succeeding years the agitation flickered in\r\nthe North and was latent in the Centre, which had been conciliated by\r\nthe construction of its railways and appeared to have identified itself\r\nwith the South.  Some ten years ago the Northern members pressed their\r\nclaims very strongly, and more recently the Central members have\r\npetitioned the Crown, sent a deputation to the Colonial Secretary, and\r\nbrought their case before the Queensland Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe arguments advanced by the Northern and Central separationists are\r\nsimilar in character, and if recognised as valid in the case of the\r\nCentre, must be doubly so when applied to the North, owing to its\r\ngreater distance from the capital and the difficulty of communication\r\nwith many of its outlying districts.  The boundaries adopted by the\r\nseparationists are those laid down by the Real Property (Local\r\nRegistries) Act of 1887, under which the Province was divided into\r\nthree parts, of which the Northern contains 255,000, the Central\r\n223,000, and the Southern 190,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the Centre, to which I have been able to give more\r\nattention, as I spent some time in that district, are based not only\r\nupon alleged unjust apportionment of expenditure, defective\r\nadministration, and financial hardships endured under the protective\r\ntariff for the benefit of Southern manufacturers, but upon the inherent\r\nand inalienable right of a community of free British people.  It is\r\n{57} pointed out that Central Queensland is in a more advanced position\r\nthan were Victoria and Queensland at the time of their separation from\r\nNew South Wales; that it returns less members than the city of Brisbane\r\nand the country within a radius of ten miles of it; and that the\r\nNorthern and Central members, even if unanimous in favour of\r\nseparation, would only number twenty-seven as against the forty-five\r\nrepresentatives of the South, and are bound, apart from the\r\nconstitutional aspect of the question, to look to the intervention of\r\nthe Imperial Government.  The most important utterance from this source\r\nis the reply of Sir Henry Holland, now Lord Knutsford, to the Northern\r\ndeputation, in the course of which he said that \"there is no instance\r\nof recent years, since the Colonies attained the greatness they have,\r\nof the Imperial Legislature passing an Act interfering with the\r\nadministration of one of those great Colonies, except at the request of\r\nthe Colonial Government.  Therefore I say it is difficult, if not\r\nundesirable, to deal with such a question as this unless we have the\r\nauthority, on a desire expressed on the part of the Colonial\r\nLegislature, or unless there is some case made out which is absolutely\r\noverwhelming;\" and Mr. Chamberlain recently stated, with reference to\r\nCentral separation, that, even if local agreement had been reached, the\r\ndifficulties and risks attending any attempt to divide the Province\r\nwere, under existing circumstances, very great.  He clearly appreciated\r\nthe hostile feeling that would be aroused throughout {58} Australia by\r\nany interference on the part of the Imperial Authorities with the\r\ninternal government of an Australian Province.  As the separationists\r\ndo not hope to obtain a majority in the Queensland Assembly, they are\r\nlikely to be ardent advocates of Federation, especially if a clause be\r\ninserted in the Constitution which would enable the Federal Government\r\nto subdivide a Province without the consent of its Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Southern members are influenced by the fear that, under separation,\r\nthey would lose the Northern and Central markets.  To meet this\r\nobjection, a resolution was moved in the Assembly by one of the members\r\nfor Rockhampton that the separation of Central Queensland was\r\ndesirable, but on such terms that the interchange of natural products\r\nbetween the two Provinces should continue to be free from tax or duty;\r\nbut the proposal, which was seen to be fraught with endless\r\ndifficulties, has not been regarded seriously.  The question has also\r\narisen in what manner the liability for the public debt would be\r\ndistributed in the case of separation, but it is contended that the\r\nmatter would be settled under the Imperial Act of 1861, under which\r\nboth Provinces would jointly be liable for the whole debt, and\r\nmachinery is provided for arbitration as to the proportion of it which\r\nwould be borne by each of the Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for some form of decentralisation has been recognised,\r\nand partially acted on, by {59} successive Ministries since 1877, when\r\na Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the best means of\r\nbringing about a more equitable distribution of the revenue.  The\r\nsystem of Local Government, introduced in 1878 and extended in the\r\nfollowing year to rural districts, lessened the direct control\r\nexercised from Brisbane, and handed over to elective Municipal Councils\r\nand Divisional Boards the expenditure of the revenue raised for local\r\npurposes.  In 1887 local registries of titles to real estate were\r\nestablished at Townsville and Rockhampton, and Sir S. Griffiths\r\nintroduced a Financial Districts Bill, to divide the Province into\r\nthree districts and to provide for separate accounts of revenue and\r\nexpenditure.  The Bill was not passed, but separate returns have since\r\nbeen published, which do not, however, give a full statement of the\r\ncontributions of the different districts to the revenue.  In 1892 the\r\nsame Minister introduced a Constitution Bill, in which he proposed to\r\nplace Queensland under a federal system of Government, a General\r\nAssembly of the United Provinces, and three Provincial Parliaments.  In\r\nthe course of discussion the number of Provinces was reduced from three\r\nto two, to the exclusion of the Centre, which was to retain its\r\nconnection with the South.  The Bill passed the Assembly, and was\r\nthrown out by the Council, principally on the ground that it had not\r\nbeen supported by the statutory two-thirds majority.  The Central\r\nSeparationists were naturally opposed {60} to the Bill in its amended\r\nform, and public opinion in the North was equally hostile.  It was\r\npointed out that the expenses of government would greatly be increased,\r\neven more than under territorial separation, and that the powers of the\r\nProvincial Parliament would be so limited, in the absence of control\r\nover the railways and the customs tariff, that the North would not\r\nenjoy the enhanced prosperity which, under an entirely separate\r\nGovernment, would make it indifferent to the additional expenditure.\r\nThe appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court to reside at\r\nTownsville, and, since last year, at Rockhampton, has lessened the\r\nexpenditure and loss of time involved in legal proceedings initiated in\r\nthe Northern and Central Districts.  In the Ministerial measure dealing\r\nwith the election of delegates to represent Queensland at the\r\nAustralian Federal Convention, which failed to become law owing to an\r\ninsoluble deadlock between the two Houses, it was proposed that, of the\r\nten delegates, three should be elected by the Northern and two by the\r\nCentral Parliamentary Representatives, a greater proportion than would\r\nbe warranted by their respective populations as compared with that of\r\nthe South.  The Premier, Sir Hugh Nelson, defended the liberality of\r\nthis proposal on the ground that \"it is of the utmost importance that\r\nin any federal constitution provision should be made for the division\r\nof existing Colonies and the terms on which such divisions shall take\r\nplace;\" adding {61} that \"the Northern and Central districts have a\r\nperfectly legitimate aspiration: they are looking forward to the day\r\nwhen they will be formed into separate states.\"\r\n\r\nThe above remarks embody the views of many South Queenslanders who look\r\nforward to eventual separation, but are not prepared to advocate it at\r\npresent; the Central separationists, on the other hand, contend that\r\nthe question is ripe for immediate settlement, and, as a proof of\r\npopular feeling in the matter, point out that ten out of the eleven\r\nrepresentatives of Central Queensland are pledged to separation, and\r\nthat numerous petitions were handed to the late Governor, Sir Henry\r\nNorman, on the occasion of his tour through the district.  Personal\r\nobservation and inquiries directed to all with whom I came in contact,\r\nhave convinced me that the enthusiasm for separation is greatly on the\r\nwane in the Centre, owing to the strength of the Labour Party, which,\r\nin 1896, carried a majority of the Central seats, and to the inevitable\r\nreaction which succeeds a period of excitement.  The owners of property\r\nand tradespeople of Rockhampton have everything to gain by a change\r\nwhich would make their town the capital of a province; the miners at\r\nMount Morgan and the shearers are indifferent, though the latter,\r\njudging from a conversation which I had with some twenty of them, have\r\na vague idea that under separation the Labour Party, of which they are\r\nsupporters, would be in a stronger position; and the pastoralists, who\r\n{62} direct the principal industry of the community, are practically\r\nunanimous in their opposition: they have obtained the railway which has\r\nopened up the Western Downs, and they dread the predominance of the\r\nLabour Party and of Rockhampton, the inhabitants of which, they\r\nmaintain, have shown little regard for their interests.\r\n\r\nAs regards the feeling in the North, I have been told by one of the\r\nNorthern members, himself a supporter of separation, and by others,\r\nthat the agitation is at present dormant.  The election of local men\r\nhas been promoted by the payment of members; previously most of the\r\nNorthern representatives were inhabitants of Brisbane, who were out of\r\ntouch with the feelings and interests of their constituents.  Material\r\nand political considerations also have exercised great influence.  The\r\nsugar planters, ardent advocates of separation as long as the\r\nimportation of coloured labour was forbidden, have been staunch\r\nsupporters of the Union since the removal of the prohibition and the\r\npassage of the Sugar Works Guarantee Act.  On the other side, the\r\nLabour Party, who share in the hatred of coloured labour which is\r\ncommon to the working classes throughout Australasia, opposed\r\nseparation while it was likely to lead to its legalisation, but have\r\nbeen encouraged by their present strength, the tenure of seven seats\r\nout of sixteen in the Northern district, in the belief that, if they\r\nobtained separation, they might hope again to {63} exclude it, and\r\nwould have an opportunity of giving effect to their general political\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nThe \"Kanaka\" question has been so fully discussed in the press and in\r\nnumerous pamphlets, that the Imperial and Provincial Acts, which first\r\naimed at the protection of the islanders, may be dismissed with the\r\nremark that they are admitted in Queensland to have had abundant\r\njustification.  The conditions have been made successively more\r\nstringent until, at the present time, it is almost impossible that any\r\nKanakas should be taken against their will, ill-treated on the voyage,\r\nor oppressed upon the plantations.  Government agents, to give a brief\r\nsummary of the Acts, accompany all recruiting vessels and are bound to\r\nsee that the islanders understand the nature of the agreement into\r\nwhich they are about to enter, as to rate of payment, and duration of\r\nservice; that every return passenger is duly landed along with his\r\nproperty at his own village or district, and that the islanders receive\r\nthe prescribed provisions and clothing on the journey, and are\r\notherwise treated in accordance with the regulations.  Inspectors\r\nreceive the vessels upon their arrival in Queensland, superintend the\r\nsignature of the agreements, and, generally, are responsible for the\r\nwelfare of the labourers during their residence in the country.  In the\r\ncase of sickness employers are bound to provide proper medicine and\r\nmedical attendance, and they may be called upon to contribute towards\r\nthe maintenance of a hospital.  {64} The contentment of the labourers\r\nmay be inferred from the fact that a large proportion re-engage\r\nthemselves upon the expiration of the term of three years, and that, of\r\nthe 1,305 who were landed during the year 1895, 250 had previously been\r\nemployed in Queensland.  As the result of frequent intercourse, the\r\nconditions are well known in most of the islands from which the\r\nlabourers are recruited.  According to official figures, the number of\r\nislanders in Queensland increased in 1895 from 7,853 to 8,163, of whom\r\nnearly two-thirds are in the districts of Mackay and Bundaberg; all are\r\nemployed on the cultivation of sugar, with the exception of a few at\r\nThursday Island, who are engaged in the beche-de-mer and pearl-shell\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the only valid objection which can now be made\r\nagainst the system, except by those who disagree from the whole thing\r\non principle, is, that it may lead to the gradual depopulation of some\r\nof the islands by the withdrawal of a considerable proportion of the\r\nadult males of marriageable age.  It may be noted, in this connection,\r\nthat the islanders have also been recruited for Guatemala, if not for\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nThe mode of cultivation and the treatment of the raw material have been\r\nmodified during the last few years.  At first the cane was grown solely\r\nin large plantations, each of which possessed a separate mill and\r\ntreated only its own produce; but as prices fell and the local demand\r\nwas overtaken, more scientific {65} methods began to prevail.  It was\r\nfound, on the one hand, that the cane could be treated most\r\neconomically on a large scale; on the other, that few plantations were\r\nsufficiently extensive to keep a large mill at work during the whole\r\nseason.  To meet these conditions, central mills were constructed and\r\nthe land was in many cases subdivided, and let or sold on a system of\r\ndeferred payments to farmers, who were encouraged to cultivate it in\r\nsmall areas, and to send their cane to the factories.  The interests of\r\nthe mill-owner and the farmers should be identical; the former is\r\nanxious that his mill should be worked to its full capacity, and has\r\nevery inducement to dispose of his land upon terms favourable to\r\ncultivators; the latter have a sure outlet for the disposal of their\r\nproduce.  In 1894, fully 40 per cent. of the 80,000 acres under cane\r\nwas cultivated in areas of ninety acres and under.  An impetus was\r\ngiven to this movement by the temporary prohibition of the importation\r\nof islanders, which compelled planters to consider the possibility of\r\nan alternative to coloured labour, and by a vote of L50,000, by means\r\nof which two central mills were erected for groups of small farmers.\r\nThe success of these mills induced the Government to pass the Sugar\r\nWorks Guarantee Act, under which \"any company which can give the\r\nGovernment security in land, has the requisite cane crops growing for a\r\nfair season's mill work, and can show that it has an area of land\r\ncapable of supplying the mill with a full crop, can obtain the {66}\r\nsanction of the Government to accept a tender for the erection of a\r\nfactory, the State guaranteeing the interest and the redemption of the\r\ndebentures issued in payment for it.  By this measure the country has\r\nnot only supplied the means for the steady development of the industry,\r\nbut has taken, in its belief in the soundness of the enterprise, a\r\ndirect interest in it.  No surer guarantee can exist than this law,\r\nthat the Parliament of Queensland will in future safeguard the\r\nprosperity of an undertaking in which the State has so keen an\r\nincentive to protect itself from loss.\"[1]  The contingent liability\r\nincurred by the State in the year ending June, 1895, was L157,000, and\r\nin the preceding year L44,000: the amount is likely to be increased, as\r\nthe construction of seven additional mills has been conditionally\r\napproved of, but, under an amending Act of 1895, is not to exceed a\r\ntotal of L500,000.  The Premier sees no reason to suppose that, with\r\nproper management, any of the new factories will fail to meet their\r\nliabilities to the State.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the question arises whether coloured labour\r\nwill permanently be necessary, the answer to which depends upon the\r\nability of the white man to become acclimatised in a tropical country.\r\n\"If the white man,\" to quote a prominent Queenslander, \"can live and\r\nwork and bring {67} up his children in the tropics of this continent,\r\nthen assuredly the time will come when we shall require coloured\r\nlabourers to cultivate our cane no more than do the continental\r\nsugar-beet farmers require coloured men to do their field work.  Where\r\ncan we look for proof of the European's ability to work and live in the\r\nheated North?  He works on railways and in mines now, but there is an\r\nentire lack of evidence that his children and his children's children\r\ncan continue to do so with unimpaired health and vigour.  Again, it has\r\nto be seen what will be the normal death-rate in the North.  It has\r\nbeen heavy, but we have yet to estimate the lowering of that rate as\r\nthe malarial swamps are drained, and the dense tropical scrubs cleared\r\naway....  Time alone can solve this question thoroughly, though it may\r\nbe permitted one to say that so far there is ample reason to think that\r\nthe evidence is accumulating in favour of the European's ability to\r\npermanently inhabit and cultivate our tropical lands.  There is some\r\nsatisfaction in noting, for instance, that, despite the increased\r\nsettlement in Northern Queensland, the death-rate for the Colony has\r\nfallen from 22.97 Per 1,000 in 1884 to 12.08 in 1894.\"[2]  The rate of\r\nmortality among the Kanakas is reported officially to have been 40.62\r\nper 1,000 in 1894, and 29.64 in 1895.  Their employment is absolutely\r\nprohibited in the mills, and is restricted to certain forms of work\r\nupon the plantations.  The {68} Government are anxious to replace the\r\nKanakas gradually by white labourers and to settle the tropical\r\nlittoral with a population of small farmers.  This object, however, it\r\nis contended, cannot be attained without the temporary employment of\r\ncoloured labour.  Another aspect of the question may be noted: granted\r\nthat white men cannot at present do all the work upon the plantations,\r\nKanakas are preferable to Orientals, whether Chinese or Japanese, who\r\nwould remain permanently in the country.  Even in Queensland, though\r\nless than in the Southern Provinces, such a state of things would be\r\nregarded as eminently undesirable.\r\n\r\nA considerable demand for white labour has thus been created, the\r\nextent of which may be gauged from the figures given to me by a planter\r\nwho has 3,000 acres under cane in the neighbourhood of Bundaberg.  Upon\r\nland which formerly carried 800 head of cattle and gave employment to a\r\nsingle married couple, he now employs 300 Kanakas and 80 white men\r\nduring the whole of the year, and 120 additional white men during the\r\ncrushing season, which lasts, as a rule, from June to December.  The\r\nlatter are compelled to shift for themselves during the remaining\r\nmonths of the year and wander about the country in the search for\r\ncasual work; many, it is said, seek it in the agricultural districts of\r\nthe Darling Downs.\r\n\r\nThe people of Queensland are confronted with a serious problem in the\r\nfact that of the three {69} principal industries of the countries,\r\nmining alone affords regular and constant employment, and that only on\r\nproved goldfields.  In the sugar industry, as stated, about 40 per\r\ncent. of the labourers, exclusive of the islanders, are permanently\r\nemployed, and in the pastoral industry the proportion is even smaller.\r\nOn a typical sheep-station in the Central district which carries 80,000\r\nsheep, the permanent staff number only 19, and are supplemented at\r\nshearing time by some 25 to 30 shearers and as many more workmen who\r\npick up, sort, and pack the fleeces.  The shearers with whom I\r\nconversed bewailed the irregularity of their employment; they work at\r\nhigh pressure for a few months in the wool-sheds, and have no fixed\r\noccupation during the remainder of the year.  I was favourably\r\nimpressed by the men, and was informed that, as a class, they have much\r\nimproved of late years, and that many of them have considerable\r\nsavings.  Allowances must be made for workmen who are herded together,\r\ngood characters with bad, and lead a nomadic and demoralising existence\r\nwhich lacks the sobering influences of sustained industry and domestic\r\nassociations.  Recent Ministries have been alive to the importance of\r\nthis question and have aimed at the gradual diminution of the size of\r\npastoral properties held from the Crown.  The Land Act of 1884 divided\r\nthem into two equal parts, over one of which the holder was offered a\r\nfixed lease for 21 years, while the other was to be subject to {70}\r\nresumption by the State as the demand for the land might arise.  Under\r\nthis provision large tracts of country have been thrown open for\r\noccupation as grazing farms of from 5,000 to 20,000 acres and have been\r\neagerly taken up, as many as twenty applications having been received\r\nfor a single farm where the quality of the soil has been exceptionally\r\nfavourable.  The Act of 1894, passed by the present Government,\r\nestablished a new form of tenure which was intended to meet the special\r\nrequirements of the shearers.  Grazing homesteads not exceeding 2,500\r\nacres in area may be acquired at a low rental, subject to the condition\r\nthat the selector must reside upon the land for not less than six\r\nconsecutive months in each year during the first ten years of his\r\nlease; but, under license from the Land Board, the selectors of two or\r\nmore homesteads may co-operate to work their holdings as a whole, in\r\nwhich case residence by one-half of the whole number of selectors will\r\nfulfil the conditions of occupation.  Some of the shearers may, from\r\nthe force of habit, be incapable of a settled existence; but many of\r\nthem proclaim their desire to occupy land and are hereby afforded an\r\nopportunity which they have scarcely at present realised.  The\r\nattractiveness of this form of tenure will be increased if the\r\nGovernment pass their proposed legislation to authorise them to sink\r\nbores for the supply of water to the smaller holdings.\r\n\r\nA better state of things prevails upon the Darling Downs in the south\r\nof the Province, where the {71} shearing is done by cultivators and\r\nothers who are in regular employment.  This part of the country should\r\neventually carry a large resident population engaged in the growth of\r\ncereals and in dairy-farming.  To promote settlement and \"in the strong\r\nbelief that Queensland is capable of and will soon be supplying not\r\nonly her own requirements, but also of exporting largely of her surplus\r\nfarm products, the Government have made provision in connection with\r\nthe Torres Strait Service for the carriage of farm and dairy produce in\r\nlarge quantities, and have also submitted to Parliament a measure for\r\nthe appointment of an additional Minister, to be charged solely with\r\nthe development of agricultural interests, and have taken the necessary\r\nsteps for the establishment of an agricultural college within a\r\nreasonable distance from Brisbane.\"[3]  The export of dairy produce has\r\nbeen encouraged by the offer of a bonus, and the construction of butter\r\nfactories by loans, the funds being obtained from a portion of the\r\nproceeds of a tax imposed upon owners of sheep and cattle by the Meat\r\nand Dairy Produce Encouragement Act of 1893.  The remainder is expended\r\nin advances to proprietors of meat works, and it is provided in a\r\nsubsequent Act, that the amounts received in payment of interest or\r\nrepayment of the principal of the loans, may be refunded to the payers\r\nof the tax.  The progress of settlement has been retarded by the\r\nalienation from {72} the Crown of much of the land that is most\r\nsuitable for the purpose, both in quality and situation.  The freehold\r\nhas in many cases passed to financial institutions, which, having\r\nadvanced upon it an amount greater than the present value as\r\ndepreciated by the fall in prices, are unwilling to sell the land and\r\nto reconcile themselves to their losses.  The Government have been\r\nauthorised by the Agricultural Land Purchase Act of 1894, to expend a\r\nsum not exceeding L100,000 a year in the purchase, under voluntary\r\nagreement, of land suitable for agricultural settlement which is to be\r\noffered for selection in agricultural farms, and have made considerable\r\nuse of their powers, but the system has not been sufficiently long in\r\noperation to enable an estimate to be formed of its results.\r\n\r\nThe irregularity of employment has engendered among the working classes\r\na widespread feeling of discontentment, and constitutes one of the main\r\ncauses of the numerical strength of the Labour vote, which amounts to\r\nabout 34 per cent. of the whole.  The Parliamentary Labour Party in\r\nQueensland differs from that of the other Australian Colonies in its\r\nclose identification with directly socialistic aspirations.  It was\r\nfounded to give effect to the political platform of the Australian\r\nLabour Federation, published in 1890 under the influence of the\r\ncommunist, William Lane, which advocates \"the nationalisation of all\r\nsources of wealth and all means of producing and exchanging wealth;\"\r\n{73} its organ, _The Worker_, writes under the motto \"Socialism in our\r\ntime,\" and several of its members publicly admit that they are\r\nSocialists.  Others, however, who look forward to the possibility of an\r\nalliance with a reconstructed Opposition ask to be judged solely by the\r\nprogramme of the party which contains no distinctly socialistic item,\r\nin the popular acceptation of the term, except the establishment of a\r\nState Labour Department to which men may apply as a right for work at a\r\nminimum wage; but they will have difficulty in overcoming the general\r\nimpression, which their opponents, not unnaturally, do all in their\r\npower to intensify.\r\n\r\nThe Party first came into prominence at the elections in 1893, when\r\nthey won fifteen seats out of seventy-two, and have nothing to show in\r\nthe way of practical legislation to counterbalance the undoubted\r\nconsolidation of the forces of their opponents.  A comparison suggests\r\nitself with the success of the Labour Parties in New Zealand and South\r\nAustralia which have co-operated with progressive Ministers in the\r\nenactment of measures of social reform.  In the latter case, the Labour\r\nParty have been so moderate in their programme, speeches, and actions,\r\nthat they have carried a quarter of the seats in the Legislative\r\nCouncil, and thus prove themselves not to have alienated the\r\nhouseholders and small owners of property who form the bulk of the\r\nelectorate for that House.  In New South Wales {74} the Labour Party\r\nhave been able, by opportunistic transfers of their votes, to secure\r\nelectoral reform and the taxation of incomes and land values.  The\r\nposition of affairs in Queensland is not analogous; the coalition of\r\nSir S. Griffith and Sir T. McIlwraith practically destroyed the\r\nOpposition, and made it necessary for the Labour Party to trust almost\r\nentirely to their own efforts, which should have been directed towards\r\nthe concentration of all the progressive feeling of the community.\r\nTheir policy, on the contrary, has deprived them of the support of many\r\nwho are dissatisfied with the Government, and has not materially\r\nstrengthened their hold upon the working classes.  Though they carried\r\ntwenty seats in 1896, they only polled 964 more votes than in 1893, nor\r\nhave they improved their position in the House, as, even should they be\r\nsupported by the ten Oppositionists and Independents, they would be\r\nconfronted by a solid phalanx of forty-two Ministerialists.  It may be\r\nof interest to note that their principal successes have been gained\r\namong bushmen and miners, but that they also hold the sugar district of\r\nBundaberg, two agricultural constituencies, two seats at Rockhampton,\r\nand three in the poorer and outlying parts of Brisbane.\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the Labour Party against the Government were directed\r\nmainly to their failure to amend the electoral laws or to pass\r\nhumanitarian legislation, and to the stringency of the Peace\r\nPreservation Act of 1894.  Apart from their obvious {75} objections to\r\nthe plural vote of persons holding property in different divisions,\r\nthey contend that many miners and shearers are permanently\r\ndisfranchised, as they are neither householders nor reside for six\r\nmonths in the same place, and that persons qualified to be registered\r\nare impeded by the provisions which oblige them to fill in a claim in\r\nwhich, among other things, they have to state their qualification, and\r\nto get the claim attested by a justice of the peace, electoral\r\nregistrar, or head male teacher of a State school.  The Peace\r\nPreservation Act was passed at a time when a serious disturbance had\r\narisen from a strike of shearers in the pastoral districts of the West,\r\non the ground that the ordinary laws of the Colony were insufficient\r\nfor the prevention, detection, and punishment of crime in such\r\ndistricts, and was as strongly justified by some as it was condemned by\r\nothers.  The Act authorised the Executive to proclaim districts which\r\nshould come under its operation, and to appoint such district\r\nmagistrates as might be necessary for carrying its provisions into\r\neffect.  These may be summarised in the words of the Hon. T. J. Byrnes,\r\nthe Attorney-General: \"The first portion of this legislation is to give\r\nus power to put an end to the carrying of arms and the sale of arms in\r\nthe districts that have been disturbed...  It is proposed in the second\r\npart of the Bill that inquests on crime may be held...  The third\r\nportion of the Bill deals with the power {76} of arrest and detention\r\nof persons under suspicion.\"  Under the latter heading persons\r\nsuspected of crime committed in a proclaimed district could be arrested\r\nby a special or provisional warrant, in any part of Queensland, and be\r\ndetained in prison; but it was provided that such persons should be\r\ntreated as persons accused of crime and not as convicted prisoners, and\r\nthat no person \"should be held in custody under a provisional warrant\r\nfor a longer period than thirty days, nor under a special warrant for a\r\nlonger period than two months, without being brought to trial for the\r\noffence stated in such warrant.\"  In justification of the measure, the\r\nsame Minister quoted cases in which woolsheds had been burnt and the\r\npolice and private individuals had been fired upon although no actual\r\nloss of life had occurred.  A stranger cannot form an opinion upon the\r\nquestion and can only note, on the one side, that the operation of the\r\nAct was limited to one year, that it was most judiciously administered,\r\nnot more than one district, under a single district magistrate, having\r\nbeen proclaimed, and that it brought about the speedy cessation of the\r\ntroubles; on the other, that no attempt was made by the Government at\r\nmediation between the opposing parties, although, to quote the\r\nAttorney-General again, they \"knew that labour troubles of an\r\naggravated nature were likely to occur.\"  A Bill \"to provide for\r\nconciliation in industrial pursuits\" is included in the programme of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n{77}\r\n\r\nAs regards the necessity for humanitarian legislation, reference can be\r\nmade to the evidence given before a Royal Commission in 1891.  The\r\nCommissioners were unanimous in reporting that, in many factories and\r\nworkshops which they had visited, the sanitary conditions were very\r\nbad, the ventilation was improperly attended to, and little or no\r\nattempt had been made to guard the machinery.  They were agreed as to\r\nthe need of further legislation, but, while some were of opinion that\r\nthe wider powers should be exercised by inspectors under the local\r\nauthorities, others were in favour of the appointment of a special\r\nclass of male and female inspectors.  They also found that children of\r\nthe ages of ten, eleven, and twelve years were employed in factories,\r\nand that the hours of labour in many retail shops were very long,\r\nadding that medical evidence was conclusive that the excessive hours\r\nwere more injurious to health in Queensland than they would be in a\r\ncolder climate; but they were unable to concur as to the advisability\r\nof legislative interference.  A Factory Act, though not of a very\r\nstringent character, was passed by the Government towards the end of\r\nthe session of 1896.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Government during the last few years has been\r\ndirected mainly towards the restoration of the credit of the country\r\nand the development of its industries.  Queensland reached its lowest\r\nebb in 1889, when, in spite of the recent loan of ten millions, the\r\ndeficit amounted to {78} L484,000.  Since that time matters have\r\nrapidly improved, and in 1895 and 1896 the revenue was considerably in\r\nexcess of the expenditure.  This result has been achieved by economical\r\nadministration, and the direct encouragement of enterprise which has\r\nbeen effected by a large extension of the sphere of State action.  The\r\nprinciples involved appear to have been threefold.\r\n\r\nFirst, that the State should facilitate the occupation of outlying\r\ndistricts by the construction of public works, provided they may be\r\nexpected to return a fair interest upon the expenditure.  The proposals\r\nput forward some fifteen years ago, that the three Western lines should\r\nbe connected with the Gulf of Carpentaria by a series of Land Grant\r\nRailways, were condemned by the sense of the community, which preferred\r\nto postpone their construction until it could be undertaken by the\r\nState.  In pursuance of this policy all the railways are owned and\r\nmanaged by the State, which has recently protected itself against the\r\ndanger of the construction of unprofitable lines under political\r\npressure by an Act of Parliament under which, upon any fresh proposal,\r\nthe local authorities affected may be required to give a guarantee that\r\nthey will, for a period of years, should the earnings fail to reach a\r\ncertain standard, make good half of the deficiency out of the rates.\r\nIn the Western portions of the Colony, in which occupation has been\r\nretarded by the scarcity of water, the Government have also {79}\r\nincurred considerable expenditure in the successful provision of\r\nartesian water and in general works of conservation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the State may assist producers to dispose advantageously\r\nof their produce.  Reference has been made to the contracts which the\r\nGovernment have entered into with the British India Company for the\r\ncarriage of farm and dairy produce.  They are now considering the\r\nadvisability of assisting cattle-owners, whose resources are severely\r\nstrained by the low prices which they obtain in London for their frozen\r\nmeat.  The principal cause of the low prices and the attitude of the\r\nPremier can be gathered from the following extract from the financial\r\nstatement which he delivered in 1896:--\r\n\r\n\"Our meat I believe to be as good as any in the world, and the cost at\r\nwhich it can be delivered at a profit at the ports of the Colony will\r\ncompare favourably with any other country that I am aware of; and yet\r\nthe prices lately obtainable in London are such as barely cover the\r\ncharges for freezing, freight, insurance, &c.  Something will have to\r\nbe done if the industry is to be preserved.  The only suggestion I have\r\nreceived as yet is that the Colony, either individually or in\r\nconjunction with the other Colonies, should take the business of\r\ndistribution into its own hands, as it is believed that, whilst the\r\nconsumers give good value for our meat, a great part of that value is\r\nabsorbed by various graduations of middlemen, leaving, as I have said,\r\na margin for the {80} producer altogether disproportionate to the real\r\nvalue of the product.  To effect this a large amount of capital will be\r\nrequired, respecting which I have no proposal to submit, as the matter\r\nis really one for private enterprise to undertake, but I mention the\r\nmatter as one requiring speedy and most serious attention, because, if\r\nprivate enterprise should not be forthcoming to cope with the\r\ndifficulty, it may devolve upon Parliament to adopt such measures as\r\nmay appear practicable to conserve an important industry which we can\r\nill afford to lose.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, I understand (I was not in Queensland at the time), a\r\nParliamentary Committee was instructed to consider the question, and\r\nreported in favour of the establishment at London and in the provinces\r\nof depots for the receipt and distribution of frozen meat.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, referring to the injury done to the harbour of\r\nBrisbane by excessive towage rates, the Premier said that if private\r\nenterprise could not do it for a less sum, it would be a very simple\r\nthing for the Government to take the matter in hand.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the State may use its credit, after strict investigation\r\nof the circumstances and upon conviction of the validity of the\r\nsecurity, to enable prospective producers to borrow money at a low rate\r\nof interest.  The Sugar Works Guarantee Act, of which I have quoted the\r\nprovisions, has led other producers to ask for similar concessions.\r\nThe {81} farmers want flour mills and cheap money; the pastoralists and\r\ngraziers complain of the tax levied upon them under the Meat and Dairy\r\nProduce Encouragement Acts.  Why, they ask, should the sugar industry\r\nbe exceptionally favoured?  Again, if the Government are to establish\r\ndistributing agencies for frozen meat, why not also for other produce?\r\n\r\nThe Socialists describe these various measures as a spurious form of\r\nsocialism calculated to increase the profits of a single class of the\r\ncommunity; but the Government do not trouble themselves about abstract\r\nterms.  They have steadily pursued a settled policy, and have\r\nsuccessively assisted the sugar, pastoral, and agricultural interests;\r\nthey are prepared, if necessary, to give substantial help to\r\ncattle-owners in the disposal of their produce, and they intend to\r\npropose amendments of the mining laws which will promote the further\r\ndevelopment of the industry.  Nor have the producers alone been\r\nbenefited; the working classes, who are the first to suffer in times of\r\ndepression, are sharing in the renewed prosperity of the country, and\r\nhave been able to take advantage of the increased demand for their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Quoted, by permission of the author, from an article contributed to\r\nthe _Australasian Review of Reviews_ by Mr. J.

Owing to\r\nthe mountainous character of many parts of both islands, and in the\r\nabsence of railways and other facilities for internal transit,\r\ncommunication had been carried on principally by sea, and settlement,\r\ninstead of radiating from one point, as in New South Wales, Victoria,\r\nand South Australia, had been diffused at Auckland, Wellington,\r\nChristchurch, Dunedin, and other places of secondary importance.  Under\r\nthese circumstances, while it was deemed advisable to create a Central\r\nGovernment at Auckland, which was transferred to Wellington in 1865,\r\nsix elective {83} Provincial Councils were established, which, though\r\ntheir legislative and executive powers were confined within specified\r\nlimits, promoted the continuance of the separate development of the\r\nseveral portions of the Colony.  In 1876 the Provincial Legislatures,\r\nwhich had in the meanwhile been increased by a division of territories\r\nto ten, were abolished by the Central Government, principally because\r\nthey impeded the execution of the national policy of the construction\r\nof public works.  The effects of the system, however, are still seen,\r\nespecially in the demands made in the House of Representatives that the\r\ndifferent districts shall share in the benefits of any proposed\r\nexpenditure of public funds.\r\n\r\nAnother feature which served to differentiate New Zealand from\r\nAustralia was the existence of a warlike native race in the North\r\nIsland, which opposed the colonisation of the early settlers.  From the\r\noutset, ignorance of each other's language and habits of thought led to\r\nmisunderstandings in regard to the disposal of land, which was\r\ncomplicated by the communal tenure of the Maoris.  The appreciation of\r\nthis difficulty led to the insertion in the Treaty of 1840, in which\r\nthe chiefs purported to cede the sovereignty of New Zealand, of a\r\nprovision which reserved to the Crown the right of pre-emption over all\r\nnative lands.  But the dissatisfaction was not allayed; the natives,\r\nconscious of the steady advances of the {84} settlers and urged to sell\r\nby agents of the Crown, feared that they would gradually be\r\ndispossessed of their territory.  A conflict which arose in regard to\r\nsome land, and led to fatal results, increased the state of tension,\r\nwhich culminated, after a struggle in the extreme north, in the\r\nprolonged conflicts of 1860 to 1870.  After the pacification the\r\nreciprocal relations began to improve, and are now excellent.  The\r\nMaoris are universally respected, have four members in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and two in the Legislative Council, and are\r\nrepresented in the Executive Council by a Minister, who is himself a\r\nhalf-caste.  Numerous attempts have also been made to settle the land\r\nquestion, notably by the resumption of the right of pre-emption, which\r\nhad been waived for a time, and by the constitution, by an Act of 1893,\r\nof a Validation Court for the purpose of considering and finally\r\nsettling the titles to lands obtained by Europeans from the natives.\r\nIn view of their pre-emptive right, the Government have been bound, in\r\njustice to the Maoris, to make provision for the purchase of such lands\r\nas may be offered to them, though they have not herein initiated a new\r\npolicy.  From the establishment of Imperial sovereignty to 1870,\r\nsuccessive Governments acquired six million acres in the North Island,\r\nthe whole of the Middle Island, with the exception of reserves for the\r\noriginal owners who were few in number, and Stewart Island.  From that\r\ndate until 1895, another six {85} million acres had been acquired at an\r\noutlay of a million and a half pounds, and subsequent purchases, from a\r\nlarge area still under negotiation, amount to about 550,000 acres.  New\r\nZealand has thus disbursed, and is still disbursing, large sums of\r\nmoney in the purchase of native lands, while Australia and Tasmania\r\nrecognised no right of possession on the part of the few degraded\r\naboriginals; and New Zealand alone is burdened with the payment of\r\ninterest upon loans raised to cover the charges of prolonged military\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nDuring the wars, settlement was necessarily checked in the North\r\nIsland, but proceeded in the Middle Island without intermission.  At\r\ntheir conclusion, in 1870, Mr. (now Sir Julius) Vogel, the Colonial\r\nTreasurer, placed before Parliament a comprehensive scheme of public\r\nworks, which aimed at the general improvement of means of\r\ncommunication, a matter of particular importance in the North Island as\r\nbeing likely to hasten its final pacification.  \"The leading features\r\nof the policy were: to raise a loan of ten millions, and to spend it\r\nover a course of years in systematic immigration, in the construction\r\nof a main trunk railway throughout the length of each island, in the\r\nemployment of immigrants on the railway work, and in their ultimate\r\nsettlement within large blocks of land reserved near the lines of\r\nrailway, in the construction of main roads, in the purchase of {86}\r\nnative lands in the North Island, in the supply of water-power on the\r\ngoldfields, and in the extension of the telegraph.  The plan, with some\r\nmodifications, was authorised by the Legislature.  These modifications\r\nmostly related to the amount to be borrowed and to its expenditure; but\r\nthere was one alteration which crippled the whole policy.  The\r\nreservation of large tracts of Crown land through which the railways\r\nwere intended to be made, with a view to the use of that land for\r\nsettlement thereon, and as the means of recouping to the Colony a great\r\npart of the railway expenditure, was withdrawn by the Government from\r\nfear of losing the whole scheme.  That fear was not unfounded, inasmuch\r\nas provincial opposition to the reservation in question, combined with\r\nthe opposition of those who disliked the whole scheme, would have\r\nseriously endangered its existence.\"[1]  The provincial opposition was\r\ndue to the fact that, though the disposal of the Crown lands and the\r\nappropriation of the Land Fund were vested by the Constitution Act in\r\nthe Central Legislature, each province had in practice been allowed to\r\nframe the regulations for the alienation of land within its district,\r\nand had received the proceeds of sale for its own use.  But the\r\nomission of the proposed reservation \"has necessitated the frequent\r\nrecurrence of borrowing large sums in order to continue work which had\r\nbeen begun and was useless while {87} it was unfinished, instead of\r\nmaking, as would have been the case under a proper system of land\r\nreservation, the work itself to a great extent, if not altogether,\r\nself-supporting and self-extending; and that deplorable omission has\r\nalso frustrated the anticipated conduct of progressive colonisation\r\nconcurrently with the progress of the railways.  The result of not\r\ninsisting on this fundamental condition has been what should have been\r\nforeseen and obviated.  The Provincial Governments sold land in the\r\nvicinity of the intended railways, and expended the proceeds for\r\nprovincial purposes; and, as a rule, speculative capitalists absorbed\r\nthe land and the profits which should have been devoted to colonisation\r\nand to the railway fund.\"[2]  As the proposed railways would pass\r\nthrough private as well as Crown lands, Sir Julius Vogel also sought\r\nthe power to levy a special rate, in certain circumstances, upon the\r\npersons in the vicinity of the railways who would be benefited by their\r\nconstruction.  He believed that he would thereby prevent\r\n\"indiscriminate scrambling for railways,\" but was equally unable to\r\ninduce Parliament to accept his views.  The aggregation of large\r\nestates was promoted by the low price, 10s. or even 5s. an acre, at\r\nwhich the land was for many years sold.  262 freeholders, including\r\ncompanies, owned in 1891, 7,840,000 acres of land in estates of 10,000\r\nacres and upwards.  The Province has, since its {88} foundation, sold\r\nor finally disposed of more than 21 million acres, and has at present\r\nnearly three million acres open for selection.  The remaining lands,\r\nexclusive of those in the hands of the Maoris, amount to 16-1/2 million\r\nacres, but comprise large tracts of barren mountainous country in the\r\nMiddle Island, and of valueless pumice sand in the North Island.  In\r\nmost directions, according to the Premier, settlement is already in\r\nadvance of the roading operations.\r\n\r\nThe policy initiated by Sir Julius Vogel in 1870 was carried on by\r\nsuccessive Ministers until 1888, during which time more than 27\r\nmillions were borrowed and devoted, for the most part, to the\r\nconstruction of railways and other public undertakings.  Subsequently,\r\nSir Harry Atkinson and his successor, Mr. John Ballance, realised the\r\ndanger of constant reliance upon loans, and greatly reduced the\r\nexpenditure, which had become extravagant in the abundance of borrowed\r\nmoney.  Mr. Ballance also reformed the system of direct taxation and\r\ngave an impetus to legislation dealing with the settlement of the land\r\nand the protection of workmen in industrial pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe existing property tax, at the rate of one penny in the L on all\r\nproperty, subject to an exemption of L500, was replaced by a graduated\r\ntax on incomes and land values, the principle of graduation having\r\nalready been recognised in the case of succession duty.  The former\r\nimpost was naturally upheld by {89} large owners of property and by all\r\nclasses of professional men who had escaped taxation upon their\r\nincomes; while it was distasteful to shopkeepers, who might be taxed on\r\nunsaleable merchandise, and to cultivators of the soil, who found that\r\ntheir taxes rose in proportion to the improvements which they effected\r\nupon their estates.  The Government had little difficulty in passing\r\ntheir measure, which, subject to slight modifications, is in force at\r\nthe present time.  Incomes below L300 are not taxed; between L300 and\r\nL1,300 they pay 6d. in the L, above L1,300 a shilling; but the sum of\r\nL300 is deducted from the total income in the assessment of the tax.\r\nFor instance, an income of L2,000 pays L60, at the rate of L25 upon\r\nL1,000, and L35 upon L700.  The ordinary land-tax is a penny in the L\r\non all freehold properties of which the unimproved value exceeds L500;\r\nbetween L500 and L1,500 exemption is allowed on L500; between L1,500\r\nand L2,500 the exemption decreases by L1 for every L2 of increased\r\nvalue, being extinguished at the latter amount.  Should the value\r\nexceed L5,000, a graduated land-tax is also levied, which rises\r\nprogressively from half a farthing, until it reaches twopence upon\r\nestates of the unimproved value of L210,000 and upwards.  All\r\nimprovements are excluded from the assessment of the taxable amount:\r\nthey are defined to include \"houses and buildings, fencing, planting,\r\ndraining of land, clearing from timber, scrub or fern, laying down in\r\ngrass or {90} pasture, and any other improvement whatsoever, the\r\nbenefit of which is unexhausted at the time of valuation.\"  Under this\r\nprovision rural owners have every encouragement to improve their\r\nproperties, as the more they do so, the smaller becomes the proportion\r\nof the total value of their estates on which they are liable for\r\ntaxation.  Owners are allowed, for the purposes of the ordinary, but\r\nnot of the graduated land-tax, to deduct from the unimproved value of\r\ntheir land the amount of registered mortgages secured upon it; and\r\nmortgagees pay one penny in the L upon the sum total of their\r\nmortgages, but are not subject to the graduated tax.  A return,\r\npublished under the assessment of 1891, shows, however, that rural\r\nowners are obtaining less benefit from the exemption of improvements\r\nthan the owners of urban lands.  The figures are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                 Actual Value,      Value\r\n                  including           of          Unimproved\r\n                 improvements.   improvements.      value.\r\n\r\n  Counties ...    85,818,167      27,922,735      57,880,233\r\n  Boroughs ...    36,406,862      18,442,562      17,907,662\r\n\r\n     Total ...  L122,225,029     L46,365,297     L75,787,895\r\n\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that land is taxed, on an average, at 49 per cent. of\r\nits actual value inclusive of improvements in boroughs, and at 67-1/2 per\r\ncent. in counties; {91} but it must be remembered that, as the urban\r\npopulation is not concentrated in one centre, land values have not been\r\ninflated to any great extent, and that much of the rural land has\r\neither recently been settled or is held in large blocks in a\r\ncomparatively unimproved condition.  The improvement or sale of such\r\nproperties would, the Government believed, be promoted by the\r\nimposition of the tax.  The Minister of Labour (the Hon. W. P. Reeves)\r\nexpressed this view in the clearest terms: \"The graduated tax is a\r\nfinger of warning held up to remind them that the Colony does not want\r\nthese large estates.  I think that, whether partly or almost entirely\r\nunimproved, they are a social pest, an industrial obstacle, and a bar\r\nto progress.\"  Similar feelings are, apparently, entertained towards\r\nthe absentee owner, who, if he has been absent from or resident out of\r\nthe Province for at least three years prior to the passing of the\r\nannual Act imposing the tax, is required to pay an additional 20 per\r\ncent. upon the amount of graduated land-tax to which he would otherwise\r\nbe liable.  The income and land taxes produce a revenue about equal to\r\nthat formerly derived from the property tax, and are collected from far\r\nfewer taxpayers, the respective numbers being 15,808 and 26,327 in a\r\npopulation of some 700,000 persons.  The benefits have been felt\r\nprincipally by tradesmen, miners, mechanics, labourers, and small\r\nfarmers.  Of 91,500 owners of land, 76,400 escape payment of the\r\nland-tax.  It {92} may be noted, incidentally, that a permissive Act of\r\n1896 authorises such local bodies as adopt it to levy rates on the\r\nbasis of the unimproved value of land.  Much anxiety has been felt by\r\nlarge landowners and owners of urban property throughout Australasia at\r\nthe successive adoption of a tax on unimproved values by South\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and New South Wales.  They fear that it is the\r\nfirst step towards the national absorption of land values advocated by\r\nHenry George, but forget that the Governments of New South Wales and\r\nNew Zealand, in respect of exemptions, and of New Zealand and South\r\nAustralia, in respect of graduation, have introduced features in their\r\nsystems of taxation which cause them to be fundamentally distinct from\r\nhis proposals.  The Bill passed through the Victorian Assembly in 1894,\r\nbut rejected by the Council, also provided for exemptions.\r\n\r\nBut how, it may be asked, has an equitable assessment of the land been\r\nsecured for the purposes of the tax?  Any owner who is not satisfied\r\nwith the value placed upon his land on the assessment roll, may require\r\nthe Commissioner to reduce the assessment to the amount specified on\r\nthe owner's return, or to purchase the land at the sum mentioned on the\r\nowner's return of its actual value inclusive of improvements.  The\r\nCommissioner is bound to make the reduction unless the Government\r\napprove of the acquisition of the land.  A reasonable balance is thus\r\nstruck: the Government are unwilling to {93} have a large amount of\r\nland thrown on their hands, while the owner does not take the risk of\r\nthe resumption of the land at an inadequate valuation.  Disputes\r\nbetween the Commissioner and owners have, in most cases, been adjusted\r\nsatisfactorily; but the Government decided to buy the Cheviot Estate of\r\n85,000 acres, which lies close to the sea in the Middle Island.  Upon\r\nits purchase they at first let the pastoral lands temporarily at the\r\nrate of L8,862 a year, while their surveyors laid out the country and\r\nsupervised the construction of roads.  The results of the transaction\r\nwere, in 1896, eminently satisfactory; the capital value of the estate\r\nthen stood at L271,700, and the annual rental at L14,300; and the few\r\ninhabitants engaged in pastoral pursuits had been replaced by 216\r\nsettlers and their families, who were reported to be of a good class\r\nand to have done a large amount of work in the improvement of their\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe principal Act dealing with the alienation of Crown Lands is that of\r\n1892, which consolidates and amends former legislation.  Crown Lands\r\nare divided into urban, suburban, and village lands, which are sold by\r\nauction at an upset price, and rural lands, which are again subdivided\r\naccording to their adaptability for cultivation or pasturage.  When\r\ntownships are being laid out on Crown Lands, one-tenth of the\r\nsuperficial area is to be reserved for purposes of recreation, and a\r\nsimilar extent as a nucleus of municipal property, to be {94} vested\r\nsubsequently as an endowment in the local authority in addition to the\r\nreserves necessary for all public purposes.  At the option of the\r\napplicant, lands may be purchased for cash, or be selected for\r\noccupation with the right of purchase, or on lease in perpetuity.\r\nSelectors are limited to 640 acres of first-class land, or 2,000 acres\r\nof second-class land, the maximum being inclusive of any lands which\r\nthey may already hold.  The object of this provision is to prevent\r\nexisting landowners from aggregating large estates by the purchase of\r\nCrown Lands.  Cash sales are effected at a price of not less than 20s.\r\nand 5s. per acre, respectively, for first-class and second-class land,\r\nand entitle the selector to a free-hold title upon the expenditure of a\r\nprescribed amount on improvements.  Land selected under occupation with\r\nthe right of purchase is subject to a rental of 5 per cent. upon the\r\ncash price, under lease in perpetuity, which is for 999 years, to a\r\nrental of 4 per cent.; and strict conditions of residence and\r\nimprovement are, in both cases, attached and rigidly enforced.  At the\r\nexpiration of ten years, a licensee under the former tenure may, upon\r\npayment of the upset price, acquire the freehold or may change the\r\nlicense for a lease in perpetuity.  The latter is the perpetual lease\r\nof the previous Acts, denuded of the option of purchase and of the\r\nperiodical revaluation of the rent, and is, in the latter respect,\r\nreactionary, as the State gives up its right to take advantage of any\r\nunearned increment.  {95} Subsidies amounting to one-third of the rent\r\nof land taken up under any of the above tenures and one-fourth of the\r\nrent of small grazing-runs are paid to local authorities for the\r\nconstruction of roads, but must be expended for the benefit of the\r\nselectors from whose lands such moneys are derived.  The Act of 1892\r\nalso authorises the Governor to reserve blocks of country, as special\r\nsettlements or village settlements, for persons who may desire to take\r\nup adjacent lands.  The Village Settlements have been successful when\r\nthey have been formed in localities in which there was a demand for\r\nlabour; the Special Settlements comparative failures, because many of\r\nthe members of the associations had neither the requisite means nor\r\nknowledge of rural pursuits.  Pastoral land is let by auction in areas\r\ncapable of carrying not more than 20,000 sheep or 4,000 head of cattle;\r\nor in small grazing-runs not exceeding, according to the quality of the\r\nsoil, 5,000 or 20,000 acres in area.  The dominant feature in the Act,\r\nin its application to pastoral as well as agricultural land, is the\r\nstrict limitation of the area which may be held by any one person;\r\nrightly or wrongly, the Government are determined that the Crown Lands\r\nshall not pass into the hands of large holders.  The principal\r\ntransactions of the last three years are thus summarised, the figures\r\nfor 1894 covering the period from April, 1893, to March, 1894, and so\r\nfor the other years:\r\n\r\n{96}\r\n\r\n                       1894.            1895.              1896.\r\n\r\n                   No.    AREA.

The Government also are benefited by a policy which\r\nrenders the land revenue a permanent asset in the finances.  The\r\nreceipts for the financial year 1895-6 amounted to nearly L300,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 an attempt was also made to deal with the problem of the\r\nscarcity of available land in settled districts which was caused by the\r\nprevalence {97} of large estates.  It was thought that the labourers\r\nemployed upon them, and the sons of farmers who might wish to settle\r\nnear their parents, should have an opportunity of acquiring land.  The\r\nGovernment, accordingly, passed the first of a series of Land for\r\nSettlements Acts, which authorised the repurchase or exchange of lands\r\nand their subdivision for purposes of close settlement.  Upon the\r\nrecommendation of a Board of Land Purchase Commissioners, some of whom\r\nrepresent local interests, that a certain estate is suitable for\r\nsettlement, and should be purchased at a certain price, the Government\r\nmay enter into negotiations with the owner with a view to a voluntary\r\ntransaction, and, upon his refusal, take the land compulsorily at a\r\nvaluation fixed by a Compensation Court.  Owners are so far safeguarded\r\nthat they cannot be dispossessed of estates of less than 640 acres of\r\nfirst-class, or 2,000 acres of second-class land, that they can claim\r\nto retain the above area, and that they can require the Government to\r\ntake the whole of their estates.  The maximum annual expenditure was\r\nlimited at first to L50,000, but has been raised to L250,000.  At the\r\nend of March of last year twenty-eight estates, containing 87,000\r\nacres, had been acquired, in one case compulsorily, and made available\r\nfor settlement by surveys and the construction of roads at a total\r\nexpenditure of nearly L390,000.  Nineteen of these had already been\r\nsubdivided into farms of various sizes, and were bringing in rentals\r\namounting to {98} 4.76 per cent. upon the outlay which they had\r\ninvolved.  The Land Purchase Inspector was able to report that the\r\nlands, which had been the object of eager competition, had, in most\r\ncases, been greatly improved and were in good condition, and he is\r\nlikely to find even better results in the future, as the Amending Act\r\nof 1896 provided that applications for land should not be entertained\r\nunless the applicants were able to prove their ability properly to\r\ncultivate the soil and to fulfil the stipulations of the leases.  This\r\nprovision is of great importance, as much of the land has been\r\ncultivated by its former owners, and would deteriorate rapidly under\r\nincapable management.  The Governments of South Australia, Queensland,\r\nand Western Australia have legislated in a similar direction, and that\r\nof New South Wales introduced a Bill which failed to become law.  As\r\nfar as New Zealand is concerned, which has conducted its operations on\r\nthe largest scale, the system has not been sufficiently long in\r\nexistence to enable an estimate to be formed of its probable financial\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nA similar uncertainty prevails in regard to the more recent attempts to\r\nplace cheap money within the reach of settlers.  The first step in that\r\ndirection was taken in 1886, when regulations were made for the\r\nestablishment of Village Settlements, the members of which might\r\nreceive loans for the construction of their houses and for other\r\npurposes.  These settlements were not, as in some of the {99}\r\nAustralian Provinces, formed on a co-operative or a semi-communistic\r\nbasis.  The success of this experiment doubtless encouraged the\r\nGovernment to widen the scope of the advances.  In 1895, 4,560 persons,\r\ndivided among 144 settlements, had occupied 33,800 acres of land; they\r\nhad received L25,800 in advances, had paid L17,600 in rent and\r\ninterest, and had carried out improvements of the value of L92,800.\r\nThese improvements, consequently, form an ample security for the\r\nrepayment of the loans.  The necessity of a general scheme of advances\r\nwas based upon the difficulty experienced by small settlers, however\r\ngood might be the security, in obtaining loans except at prohibitive\r\nrates.  Authority was, accordingly, obtained through the Government\r\nAdvances to Settlers Acts of 1894-6 to borrow three millions with a\r\nview to loans ranging from L25 to L3,000, upon first mortgages, to\r\nowners of freehold land and occupiers of Crown Lands, the advances not\r\nto exceed three-fifths of the value of the former and one-half of the\r\nvalue of the lessee's interest in the latter.  Advances may not be made\r\non town lands, nor on suburban lands which are held for residential or\r\nmanufacturing purposes.  The valuation of every security is to be\r\ncarried out by or on behalf of a superintendent appointed _ad hoc._,\r\nand is to be submitted for the consideration of a General Board\r\nconsisting of the Colonial Treasurer, the Superintendent, the Public\r\nTrustee, the Commissioner of Taxes, and a nominee of the {100} Governor\r\nin Council.  The advances on freehold land may be either for a fixed\r\nperiod at 5 per cent., or for 36-1/2 years at 6 per cent., of which 5 per\r\ncent. is reckoned as interest and 1 per cent. towards the gradual\r\nrepayment of the principal; on leasehold lands, in the latter form\r\nalone.  As the loan of a million and a half raised as the source of\r\nadvances was floated at 3 per cent., and realised nearly L1,400,000,\r\nthe margin between the percentage due by the Government and that\r\nreceived from the settlers should be sufficient to enable one-tenth of\r\nthe interest to be paid, as provided, into an Assurance Fund against\r\npossible losses, and a residue to be available which will cover the\r\ngeneral expenses of administration.  But it is obvious that the result\r\nof the experiment will depend greatly upon the prevalent rate of\r\ninterest and the price of produce.  Hitherto, two-thirds of the\r\nadvances have been used by settlers to enable them to rid themselves of\r\nformer and less advantageous mortgages; in some cases, mortgagees, in\r\norder to retain their mortgages, have voluntarily lowered the rate of\r\ninterest to 5 per cent.  The tabular statement on the following page of\r\nthe financial position is the latest that has been issued, and does not\r\npurport to be more than approximately correct.  Advances may also be\r\nmade towards the construction of dwelling-houses to those who have\r\nobtained selections under the Land for Settlements Acts; but they may\r\nnot exceed twenty pounds nor the {101} amount already spent by the\r\napplicant upon his holding.\r\n\r\n  INCOME.\r\n\r\n  The advances authorised and accepted\r\n    amount to L735,967, and yield an annual\r\n    income of 5 per cent.  . . . . . . . . . . .

Any owner of land may settle as a\r\nfamily home the land, not exceeding, with all improvements, L1,500 in\r\nvalue, on which he resides and has his home, provided that at the time\r\nthe land is unencumbered and he is able to pay all his debts without\r\nthe land in question.  As a precaution against the {102} concealment of\r\nliabilities, he is obliged to make an application to a District Land\r\nRegistrar, who must thereupon give public notice of the intended\r\nregistration.  Should any creditor put in a claim within twelve months,\r\nthe case is to be tried before a Judge of the Supreme Court, and if the\r\nowner of the land is vindicated, the Registrar is to issue a\r\ncertificate which will exempt the family home from seizure under\r\nordinary processes of law, but not in one or two contingencies, of\r\nwhich the principal is the failure to meet current liabilities in\r\nrespect of rates or taxes.  The registration is to continue until the\r\ndeath of the owner or the majority or death under the age of twenty-one\r\nof all his children, and is not to precede the last of these events.\r\nUpon its cessation it may be renewed at the option of the persons then\r\nholding the estate, who must be relations of the deceased.  Little\r\neffect has been given to the Act owing, probably, to the unavoidable\r\npublicity of the proceedings.  It appears to have been based upon a\r\nSouth Australian Act of 1891, which enables holders of workmen's\r\nblocks, by the endorsement of their leases, to secure for their\r\nproperties somewhat similar exemptions from seizure.  Their failure to\r\navail themselves, to any considerable extent, of this privilege is\r\nattributed to the unwillingness of working men to take any trouble in a\r\nmatter of which the advantages are merely contingent.\r\n\r\nSo far I have discussed the legislation of New Zealand which affects\r\nfreeholders and those who {103} are, or desire to become, tenants of\r\nthe Crown; but before proceeding to deal with matters of common import\r\nto most settlers, I must point out that tenants holding from private\r\nlandlords have also engaged the paternal attention of the Government.\r\nThe Minister of Lands introduced last session, but failed to pass, a\r\nFair Rent Bill, which would have established a system of Land Courts\r\nunder the presidency of Stipendiary Magistrates.  Landlords and tenants\r\nwould have had an equal right to apply for the determination of the\r\nfair rent which, upon the decision of the Court, whether it were higher\r\nor lower than the reserved rent, would have been deemed, until a\r\nfurther revision, to be the rent payable under the lease.  The\r\nGovernment displayed great inconsistency in the introduction of the\r\nmeasure; having shown, in the system of lease in perpetuity, that they\r\nobjected to the periodical revaluation of the rents payable upon Crown\r\nLands, they proposed, through the Fair Rent Bill, to enable the Crown,\r\nas landlord, to take steps to increase the rents of its tenants.\r\n\r\nAs regards the general interests of producers, the Government have,\r\nthrough reductions amounting to L50,000 a year in railway rates, made a\r\nconcession to them at the expense of the general taxpayer, as the\r\nrailways, after payment of working expenses, return only 2.8 per cent.,\r\na sum insufficient to meet the interest upon their cost of\r\nconstruction.  Again, they have appointed experts in butter-making,\r\n{104} fruit-growing, &c., who travel about the country and give\r\ntechnical instruction by means of lectures; and they distribute, among\r\nfarmers and others, pamphlets containing practical advice upon various\r\naspects of cultivation.  But, except that butter is received, graded\r\nand frozen free of charge, they have not followed the example of\r\nVictoria and South Australia in the direct encouragement of exports.\r\nFinally, while the State acts as landlord, banker, and carrier, it also\r\ncarries on a department of life insurance and annuities, accepts the\r\nposition of trustee under wills, and, if the programme of the\r\nGovernment is accepted by Parliament, will undertake the business of\r\nfire insurance and grant a small allowance to all who are aged and\r\nindigent and have resided for a long term of years in the Colony.  The\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the country, under the assistance of\r\nthe State, has also proceeded in other directions.  More than L500,000\r\nhad been spent up to March, 1896, in the construction of water-races on\r\ngoldfields for the benefit of alluvial miners and public companies; and\r\nin that year the Premier, in view of the large amount of foreign and\r\nnative capital that was flowing into the industry, obtained the\r\nauthorisation of Parliament to the expenditure of a further sum of\r\nL200,000 in the conservation of water by means of large reservoirs, the\r\nconstruction of water-races, the extension of prospecting throughout\r\nthe Colony, and the construction of roads and tracks for the general\r\n{105} development of the goldfields.  The physical attractions and\r\nhealth resorts of the country, many of which are reached with\r\ndifficulty, are also being opened up by the expenditure of public funds.\r\n\r\nThe general question of settlement has, during the last few years, been\r\nconnected closely with that of the unemployed.  In New Zealand, as in\r\nseveral of the Australian Provinces, the construction of the main lines\r\nof railway attracted into the country immigrants who, upon their\r\ncompletion, were left without other resources.  At the same time the\r\nfall in prices rendered many settlers unable to fulfil their\r\nobligations, and, upon the loss of their properties, drove them into\r\nthe towns, where they swelled the ranks of the unemployed.  It also\r\nforced those who remained solvent to cut down their general expenses,\r\nand especially their labour bill, to the lowest possible point.  The\r\nGovernment were compelled to face the problem and attempted to give\r\nformer settlers a fresh chance and gradually to accustom artisans to\r\nrural pursuits which, in the case of uncleared land, are at first of a\r\nsimple character.  But the facilities offered under the Land Act were\r\nof little use unless it could be arranged that the men, being without\r\ncapital, should have outside employment upon which they could depend\r\nuntil their lands had been cleared and brought into cultivation.  It\r\nhad already been realised that the construction of roads was an\r\nindispensable sequel to that of railways, and large annual\r\nappropriations {106} had been made from the Public Works Fund; but it\r\nwas then decided that settlement should be encouraged systematically in\r\nthose districts in which it was proposed to proceed with the\r\nconstruction of roads.  This policy has, accordingly, been carried out\r\nenergetically during the last few years from loans and current revenue\r\nupon the co-operative system, which was inaugurated in 1891 by the Hon.\r\nR. J. Seddon, then Minister of Public Works and now Premier of the\r\nColony.  As this system, which was first tried as an experiment upon\r\nthe railways, is now employed in connection with most public works, its\r\nobject and operation may be illustrated by a series of quotations: \"The\r\ncontract system had many disadvantages.  It gave rise to a class of\r\nmiddle men, in the shape of contractors, who often made large profits\r\nout of their undertakings, and at times behaved with less liberality to\r\ntheir workmen than might have been expected under the circumstances.\r\nEven in New Zealand, where the labour problem is less acute than in\r\nolder countries, strikes have occurred in connection with public works\r\ncontracts, with the result that valuable time has been lost in the\r\nprosecution of the works, much capital has been wasted by works being\r\nkept at a standstill and valuable plant lying idle, and large numbers\r\nof men being for some time unemployed; and considerable bitterness of\r\nfeeling has often been engendered.  The contract system also gave rise\r\nto sub-contracting, which is worse again; for not only {107} is it\r\nsubject to all the drawbacks of the parent system, but by relegating\r\nthe conduct of the works to contractors of inferior standing, with\r\nlittle or no capital, the evil of \"sweating\" was admitted.  Very often,\r\ntoo, the business people who supplied stores and materials were unable\r\nto obtain payment for them, and not seldom the workmen also failed to\r\nreceive the full amount of their wages.  The result in some cases was\r\nthat, instead of the expenditure proving a great boon to the district\r\nin which the works were situated, as would have been the case if the\r\ncontract had been well managed and properly carried out, such contracts\r\nfrequently brought disaster in their train.  The anomaly of the\r\nprincipal contractor making a large profit, his sub-contractor being\r\nruined and his workmen left unpaid, also occasionally presented itself,\r\nand thus the taxpayer who provided the money had the mortification of\r\nseeing one man made rich (who would perhaps take his riches to Europe\r\nor America to enjoy them) and a number of others reduced to poverty, or\r\nin some instances cast upon public charity....  The co-operative system\r\nwas designed to overcome these evils, and to enable the work to be let\r\ndirect to the workmen, so that they should be able, not only to earn a\r\nfair day's wage for a fair day's work, but also to secure for\r\nthemselves the profits which a contractor would have otherwise made on\r\nthe undertaking....  The work is valued by the engineer appointed to\r\nhave charge of it {108} before it is commenced, and his valuations are\r\nsubmitted to the Engineer-in-Chief of the Colony for approval.  When\r\napproved, they constitute the contract price for the work; but they are\r\nnot absolutely unchangeable as in the case of a binding, strictly legal\r\ncontract.  It frequently happens under an ordinary contract that work\r\nturns out to be more easy of execution than was anticipated, and the\r\nState has to see its contractors making inordinate profits.  Sometimes,\r\non the other hand, works cost more than was expected; but in most cases\r\nof this kind the contractor either becomes a bankrupt, so that the\r\nState has, after all, to pay full value for the work, or, if the\r\ncontractor happens to be a moneyed man, he will probably find some\r\nmeans of getting relieved of a contract, or of obtaining special\r\nconsideration for his losses on completion of his work.  Under the\r\nco-operative system, if it is found that the workmen are earning\r\nunusually high rates their contracts can be determined, and be re-let\r\nat lower rates, either to the same party of men or to others, as may be\r\nnecessary.  Similarly, if it is shown, after a fair trial of any work,\r\nthat capable workmen are not able to earn reasonable rates upon it, the\r\nprices paid can, with the approval of the Engineer-in-chief, be\r\nincreased, so long as the department is satisfied that the work is not\r\ncosting more than it would have cost if let by contract at ordinary\r\nfair paying prices....  Another great advantage of {109} co-operation\r\nis that it gives the Government complete control over its expenditure.\r\nUnder the old plan, when large contracts were entered into, the\r\nexpenditure thereunder was bound to go on, even though, through sudden\r\ndepression or other unlooked-for shrinking of the revenue, the\r\nGovernment would gladly have avoided or postponed the outlay....  Not\r\nonly has the Government complete control over the expenditure, but in\r\nthe matter of the time within which works are to be completed the\r\ncontrol is much superior to that possessed when the works are in the\r\nhands of a contractor.  When once a given time is allowed to a\r\ncontractor in which to complete a work, any request to finish it in\r\nless time would at once provoke a demand for extra payment; but under\r\nthe co-operative system the Government reserves the right to increase\r\nthe numbers employed in any party to any extent considered desirable,\r\nso that if any sudden emergency arises, or an unusually rapid\r\ndevelopment in any district takes place, it is quite easy to arrange\r\nfor the maximum number possible of men being employed on the works in\r\nhand, with no more loss of time than is required to get the men\r\ntogether.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt was at first proposed that the men should work in gangs of about\r\nfifty, who should have an equal interest in the contract and make an\r\nequal division of the wages and profits; but experience showed that\r\nlarge gangs did not work together harmoniously {110} owing to\r\ndifferences, not only in the temperament of the men, but also in their\r\nabilities as workmen.  The labourers solved this difficulty by forming\r\nthemselves into small parties composed of men of about equal ability,\r\nwith the result that, while some gangs earn higher wages than others,\r\nthe weak are not excluded altogether from employment.  The co-operative\r\nworks have, on the whole, been successful; but it is clear, from the\r\nreports of the surveyors, that constant supervision is necessary, and\r\nthat there is considerable dissatisfaction, among unskilled workmen,\r\nwith the low rate of their earnings, and, generally, with the\r\nintermittent character of the employment.  For the Government have\r\ndecided, in order that work may be given to as many as possible and\r\nthat settlement may be promoted, that no labourers shall be employed\r\nmore than four days in the week.  During the remainder of the time, if\r\nthey have taken up land in the neighbourhood, they devote themselves to\r\nit; otherwise they are likely to be demoralised by enforced idleness.\r\nThe Minister of Public Works attempted to prove that works had been\r\ncarried out more economically under the co-operative system, but was\r\nunable to cite cases that were exactly analogous.  He showed that the\r\naverage number of employes had risen from 788 in 1891-2 to 2,336 in\r\n1895-6, but that, whereas in the former years workmen under the Public\r\nWorks Department were twice as numerous as those under the Lands {111}\r\nDepartment, in the latter the proportion had been more than reversed.\r\nThis change must be regarded as satisfactory, as employes under the\r\nLands Department are, in a large majority of cases, settlers.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Government passed an Act which was intended to meet the\r\nspecial requirements of the unemployed.  Any number of men composing an\r\nassociation may, by agreement with the Minister of Lands, settle upon\r\nCrown Lands for the purpose of clearing or otherwise improving them,\r\nand will, subject to the authorisation of Parliament, receive from the\r\nColonial Treasurer payment for their work.  They are entitled thereupon\r\nto take up holdings at a rental based on the combined value of the land\r\nin an unimproved condition and of the improvements.  This system, which\r\nis known as that of Improved Farm Settlements, has been worked largely\r\nin connection with co-operative works.  In March of last year 39\r\nsettlements had been initiated which covered 63,600 acres and carried\r\n679 residents.  They have \"had the effect of removing from the towns a\r\nconsiderable number of people who otherwise would have been found in\r\nthe ranks of the unemployed, and an opportunity has been given to all\r\nwho are really desirous of becoming _bona-fide_ settlers to make homes\r\nfor themselves, and become producers rather than a burden on the State.\r\nMany who have taken up land on this system brought no experience with\r\n{112} them to aid in the operations of the pioneer work of settlement,\r\nand this had to be gained at some cost to themselves and the State.  So\r\nlong as the Government continues monetary aid by way of assisting in\r\nclearing, grassing, and house-building, all will go well; by the time\r\nthis comes to an end, sufficient experience should have been gained,\r\nand the farms ought to be stocked.  This latter is at present a\r\ndifficulty with many of the settlers, for it is obvious that many of\r\nthem can at first do little more than support themselves out of the\r\nmoneys advanced for clearing, without sparing anything for stock.\"[4]\r\nThe success of these settlements, it is pointed out, depends upon the\r\nsimultaneous occupation by men with capital of the adjoining Crown\r\nLands in larger holdings on which there will be a demand for the labour\r\nof the settlers; otherwise they will be in difficulties when the roads\r\nare completed, as their blocks of a hundred acres or so will not alone\r\nsuffice to secure to them a livelihood.  This principle has been borne\r\nin view, as far as possible, in the location of the settlements.\r\n\r\nLabourers for the co-operative works, I should have stated, are\r\nrecommended by the local agencies of the Labour Department, and are\r\nselected on the principle that applicants not previously employed have\r\npriority of claim over those who have recently had employment; that men\r\nresident in the neighbourhood of the works have priority over {113}\r\nnon-residents, and that married men have priority over single men;\r\nwhile the qualifications of the men as workmen and their personal\r\ncharacters are naturally taken into consideration.  During the five\r\nyears of its existence, the Labour Department has found employment for\r\nnearly 16,000 men; of the 2,781 men assisted during the year ending\r\nMarch, 1896, 2,163 were sent to Government works.  Under the control of\r\nthe Labour Department is a State Farm, in the province of Wellington,\r\nat which unemployed are received for a few weeks or months, and, having\r\nsaved a few pounds, are enabled to seek work elsewhere.  The farm is\r\nspecially adapted for young, able-bodied men who have been brought up\r\nas clerks and shop assistants, but, owing to the stress of competition,\r\nhave been thrown out of employment.  Many of them would be prepared to\r\nundertake manual labour, but lack the necessary experience.  At the\r\nfarm they would be able to obtain in a short time sufficient knowledge\r\nto render them capable of accepting work for private employment.  The\r\nSecretary of the Department of Labour, Mr. Tregear, maintains that the\r\nfarm has proved its usefulness and should be supplemented by similar\r\ninstitutions in the other provinces.  Since the last annual report, I\r\nunderstand, the Government have decided, as the land has been improved\r\nto a point which renders it impossible to employ any considerable\r\nnumber upon it profitably, to dispose of it, and to remove the workmen\r\n{114} to fresh areas of uncleared land.  They hope to recoup themselves\r\nfor their whole expenditure, but will not necessarily be convicted of\r\nfailure should they fail to do so, as the undertaking was started on a\r\ncharitable, and not on a commercial, basis.  It aimed at the assistance\r\nof the genuine unemployed, and was not intended to become a refuge for\r\nconfirmed loafers.  On this point Mr. Tregear writes, and his views are\r\nthose of the working men of New Zealand: \"I am more and more impressed\r\nwith the necessity that exists of establishing farms which shall be\r\nused as places of restriction for the incurably vagrant atoms of the\r\npopulation.  The State Farm does not and should not fulfil this\r\npurpose; it is for the disposal and help of worthy persons,\r\nunsuccessful for the time, or failing through advance in years.  What\r\nis required is a place of detention and discipline.  There exists in\r\nevery town a certain number of men whose position vibrates between that\r\nof the loafer and the criminal: these should altogether be removed from\r\ncities.  The spieler, the bookmaker, the habitual drunkard, the loafer\r\non his wife's earnings, the man who has no honest occupation, he whose\r\ncondition of 'unemployed' has become chronic and insoluble--all these\r\npersons are evil examples and possible dangers.  Such an one should be\r\nliable, on conviction before a stipendiary magistrate, to be removed\r\nfor one or two years to a farm, where simple food and clothes would be\r\nfound for him {115} in return for his enforced labour.  The\r\nsurroundings would be more healthy, and open-air life and regular\r\noccupation would induce more wholesome habits and principles than the\r\nhours formerly spent in the beer-shop and at the street-corner, while\r\nthe removal from bad companionship would liberate from the pressure of\r\nold associations.  He would, on his discharge, probably value more\r\nhighly his liberty to work as a free man for the future, and, as the\r\nState would have been to no cost for his maintenance, it would be a\r\ngainer by his temporary removal from crowded centres.  There need be no\r\nmore trouble than before in regard to the sustentation of the\r\nrestricted person's family, as such a vagrant is of no use to his\r\nfamily, but only an added burden.  While for the honest workman,\r\ntemporarily 'unemployed,' every sympathy should be shown and assistance\r\nto work given, for the other class, the 'unemployable,' there should be\r\ncompulsory labour, even if under regulations of severity such as obtain\r\nin prisons.\"[5]  New Zealand has a justification for penal colonies\r\nlacking in older countries in the fact that the genuine unemployed can\r\nobtain assistance from the Government to enable them to settle on the\r\nland, either through the Co-operative Works or the Improved Farm\r\nSettlements.\r\n\r\nThe special efforts of the Government to settle impecunious persons on\r\nthe land are still in the {116} initial stage and have not served to\r\nneutralise the effects of the lowness of prices and consequent scarcity\r\nof employment.  The total expenditure under the heading of Charitable\r\nAid was L106,500 in the year ended March, 1896, being an increase of\r\nL20,000 upon that of the previous twelve months.  A sum of L18,000 was\r\nalso spent on relief works.  The administration is vested in the local\r\nauthorities, who obtain the necessary funds from rates, voluntary\r\ncontributions and subsidies on a fixed scale from the National\r\nExchequer.  They expend one-fifth of the amount on the maintenance of\r\ndestitute children and the greater portion of the remainder on outdoor\r\nrelief.  No information is available as to the number of persons\r\nrelieved, their average ages, the form of relief or the conditions\r\nunder which it is given; but it is evident from reports of the\r\nInspector of Charitable Institutions that the administration is\r\nexceedingly lax and tends to intensify the evil which it should strive\r\nto alleviate.  It would seem that, on the one hand, the Government are\r\ninculcating habits of independence, on the other, conniving at the\r\nencouragement of pauperism.\r\n\r\nThe results of recent legislation will depend, partly, on the price of\r\nproduce, principally, on the methods of administration.  This matter is\r\none on which it is difficult to form an adequate opinion, as all\r\nstatements are tinged more or less with the prejudice of partisanship.\r\nIt is therefore {117} best to confine oneself to Acts of Parliament and\r\nofficial documents while realising that the more a State extends its\r\nsphere of action, the more are its Ministers subject to political\r\npressure and tempted to maintain themselves in office by a misuse of\r\nthe possibilities of patronage.  The disposal of Crown Lands is vested\r\nin Local Land Boards, which consist of the Commissioners of Crown Lands\r\nfor the district, and of not less than two nor more than four members\r\nappointed for two years, but removable from time to time by warrant\r\nunder the hand of the Governor.  These Boards receive all applications\r\nfor Crown Lands and dispose of them in accordance with the provisions\r\nof the Land Acts.  They are constituted the sole judges of the\r\nfulfilment of the conditions attached to leases and may cancel them,\r\nafter inquiry, subject to the right of appeal to a judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt.  If any lessee make default in the payment of interest, his\r\nlease is liable to absolute forfeiture, subject to a similar right of\r\nappeal, without any compensation for his improvements.  This question\r\nis one of great delicacy: it is manifestly unfair to confiscate a man's\r\nimprovements if he has a fair prospect of being able to meet his\r\nobligations within a definite period; on the other hand, if such\r\nlatitude be allowed, possibilities of favouritism are at once admitted.\r\nAgain, are all applicants for land to be treated alike, irrespective of\r\nthe probability that they will be good tenants of the Crown?  The {118}\r\nLand Boards are vested with a discretionary power to refuse\r\napplications, but must state the grounds of their refusal.  The best\r\nconstitution for these Boards has been much discussed; but if, as has\r\nbeen proposed, nomination by the local authorities or election by the\r\nelectors of local authorities were substituted for nomination of the\r\nGovernment, the pressure might be not only greater, but more immediate.\r\nStatistics, moreover, show that the administration of the Land Laws has\r\nnot erred on the side of leniency.  In March, 1896, the arrears of rent\r\nthroughout the Province were only L15,700, a decrease of L22,000 upon\r\nthe amount reported for the previous twelve months; and forfeitures had\r\nbeen numerous for failure to carry out the conditions of tenure.  Under\r\nexceptional circumstances Parliament is prepared to make special\r\narrangements.  In view of the losses incurred by pastoralists during\r\nthe severe winter of 1895, it passed a Pastoral Tenants' Relief Act,\r\nwhich empowered the Land Boards after inquiry into the facts of each\r\ncase to grant remissions of rent or extensions of leases at reduced\r\nrentals.  The Advances to Settlers Act also appears to be administered\r\nprudently, on the principle that the value of the property which may be\r\noffered as a security for a loan, and the risk of any loss from\r\ngranting an advance, must determine the result of the consideration of\r\nevery application.  It is a necessary limitation of the Act that many\r\nof those who most {119} require assistance, having borrowed at high\r\nrates of interest, are unable to obtain the advances which would enable\r\nthem to clear off their mortgages on account of the depreciation in\r\nvalue of the security.  Of 2,196 applications received to March of last\r\nyear, 730 had been refused, and 397 had lapsed through the refusal of\r\nthe department to offer amounts equal to the expectations of the\r\napplicant.\r\n\r\nThe Acts providing for the purchase of private and native land and for\r\nadvances to settlers have necessitated a large increase in the\r\nindebtedness of the Colony, and a consequent divergence from the\r\nprinciples laid down by Sir Harry Atkinson and Mr. Ballance.  The\r\npresent Premier, Mr. Seddon, who succeeded Mr. Ballance in 1893, admits\r\nthat his Government borrowed L3,800,000 in three years, but contends\r\nthat the whole of the amount with the exception of L210,000 is being\r\nexpended in such a manner as to be remunerative.  The sum mentioned is\r\nexclusive of a loan for a million authorised last session, which is to\r\nbe expended upon the construction of railways and roads, the purchase\r\nof native lands, and the development of the goldfields and hot springs.\r\nHave these loans been in the best interests of the Colony?  A stranger\r\ncan but look at the matter broadly and will be inclined to think that\r\nthey follow, in natural sequence, upon the policy of Sir Julius Vogel.\r\nThe State then decided that it would use its credit to accelerate the\r\nconstruction of railways and roads and open up {120} outlying\r\ndistricts.  Such works were valueless--in fact ruinous to the\r\nProvince--unless they were followed by a strenuous and successful\r\nencouragement of settlement and cultivation.  The latter task has been\r\nthe principal work of the Seddon Government, which has attempted, not\r\nonly to settle people on the land, but to settle them in suitable\r\nlocalities and under conditions that will give them a reasonable\r\nprospect of an independent and comfortable livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"The Colony of New Zealand,\" Gisborne, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[2] \"The Colony of New Zealand,\" Gisborne, pp. 171-2.\r\n\r\n[3] New Zealand Official Year Book, 1894.

In\r\nQueensland, New South Wales, and New Zealand, the members of the\r\nCouncil are nominated for life and receive no remuneration for their\r\nservices; but, as their number is not restricted, their opposition to\r\nmeasures passed by the Assembly is limited by the dread that the\r\nExecutive may exercise the power of making additional appointments.  In\r\nthe other Provinces the Councils are elective; in South Australia,\r\nWestern Australia, and Tasmania, as in the Provinces already mentioned,\r\nthe Members are {122} subject to no property qualification, and in New\r\nZealand, South Australia, and Tasmania they are paid at the rate,\r\nrespectively, of L150, L200, and L50 a year.  In Victoria, on the other\r\nhand, there is a property qualification for membership which consists\r\nin the possession of a freehold estate of the clear annual value of\r\nL100, which confines eligibility to a small fraction of the population;\r\nand the area of selection is restricted further by the absence of\r\nremuneration and by the size of the electoral districts, which\r\nnecessitates heavy expenditure on the part of a candidate at a\r\ncontested election.  Under these circumstances, the comparatively low\r\nelectoral franchise, which admits upon the rolls two-thirds of the\r\nvoters for members of the Assembly, is absolutely useless to the\r\ndemocratic electors: they are unable to find candidates who will adopt\r\ntheir views, and have been obliged, as at the last elections, to allow\r\nall the retiring members to be re-elected without opposition.  It\r\nshould be stated that the members are elected for a period of six years\r\nin ten provinces, and retire in rotation at intervals of two years.\r\n\r\nThe Victorian Assembly consists of ninety-five members who are elected\r\nfor three years upon the basis of manhood suffrage and receive\r\nremuneration at the rate of L270 a year.  Conflicts between the two\r\nHouses were incessant during the first twenty-five years of Responsible\r\nGovernment.  Immediately after its establishment in 1855 a struggle\r\n{123} arose as to the right of selection upon pastoral properties, in\r\nwhich the Council supported the interests of the squatters.  The issue\r\ncould not be doubtful, as the squatters, who had been allowed to\r\ndepasture enormous tracts of land in the early days of the Province,\r\nhad no fixed tenure and were impeding the settlement of the country.\r\nIn 1865 the Assembly passed a protective tariff which was distasteful\r\nto the Council as representative of the producers, and tried to secure\r\nits enactment by tacking it on to the Appropriation Bill.  They relied\r\nupon the section of the Constitution Act which provides that \"all Bills\r\nfor appropriating any part of the revenue of Victoria, and for imposing\r\nany duty, rate, tax, rent, return or impost, shall originate in the\r\nAssembly, and may be rejected but not altered by the Council.\"  Upon\r\nthe refusal of the Council to submit to such coercion, the Ministry\r\narranged with various banks that they should advance the funds required\r\nfor public purposes, levied a tax upon a resolution of the Assembly and\r\npaid the civil servants without parliamentary authority.  A general\r\nelection followed, at which the Ministry were successful; the Assembly\r\nand Council repeated their action of the previous session, and,\r\nfinally, the Council agreed to accept the new tariff provided it was\r\nsubmitted to them in the form of a separate Bill.  Similar\r\nconstitutional struggles occurred in 1867 upon the proposed grant to\r\nex-Governor Darling, and in 1877 upon the Bill to provide for the\r\npayment of Members {124} of the Assembly.  During the following years\r\npeace reigned between the two Houses, owing at first to the great\r\nprosperity of the Province, which caused universal confidence, and the\r\npredominance of material considerations; afterwards to the equally\r\ngreat reaction which compelled politicians to sink their differences\r\nand combine to save the credit of their country.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism was renewed in 1894 upon the proposals for additional\r\ntaxation, by which the Premier, Mr. Turner, hoped to cope with an\r\nanticipated deficiency in the revenue of more than half a million\r\npounds.  His scheme included the repeal of the existing land-tax, under\r\nwhich landed estates of upwards of 640 acres in extent are taxed\r\nannually upon the excess of the capital value over L2,500--an impost\r\nwhich obviously penalises rural, at the expense of urban, properties\r\nand was intended to promote the subdivision of the land (though it does\r\nnot appear to have had much effect in that direction); and the\r\nimposition of a tax on unimproved values at the rate of 1d. in the L,\r\nsubject to the exemption of L100 when the value does not exceed L1,000,\r\nand of an income tax which, subject to the exemption of incomes not\r\nexceeding L200, was to be at the rate of 3d. in the L on incomes\r\nderived from personal exertion and 6d. on incomes derived from property\r\nup to L2,200, above which sum the amount was in both cases to be\r\ndoubled.  Absentees were to pay an additional 20 per cent., {125} and\r\nincomes from land were to be exempt where the owner paid the land-tax.\r\nThese taxes, it was calculated, would yield an annual revenue of\r\nL600,000.  The Finance Bill was passed in the Assembly at its second\r\nreading by a majority of twenty-two, but in committee it was amended so\r\nas to exempt from the land-tax land values of less than L500.  The\r\nresultant deficiency in the proceeds of the tax was made up by a\r\ncontinuance of the primage duties and by an increase of the tax on\r\nincomes derived from personal exertion.  Upon its transmission to the\r\nCouncil the Bill was summarily rejected, the Minister who was in charge\r\nof it alone, beyond the tellers, being in its favour, on the ground\r\nthat the questions of a tax on unimproved values had not been submitted\r\nto the electorate and that, in the existing conditions of the Province,\r\nany further burden upon the producers would be opposed to its best\r\ninterests.  The Ministry accepted the decision of the Council and\r\ncontented themselves with rigid retrenchment, the continuance of the\r\nexisting land-tax, and the imposition of a progressive income tax which\r\nrises to a maximum of sixteen-pence upon the excess over L2,000 of\r\nincomes derived from property.  According to a statement of the\r\nPremier, they intend to make the question a distinct issue at the next\r\nelections, and will in the meanwhile take no action in the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the following session the Council rejected an Electoral Bill which\r\nprovided for the abolition of {126} the plural vote and the\r\nenfranchisement of women, and disagreed with the Assembly upon several\r\nimportant clauses of a Factory Bill, in the legitimate exercise of the\r\nfunctions of a revising Chamber.  The Ministry succeeded in 1896 in\r\npassing the Factory Bill in a form which met some of the objections of\r\nthe Council, and reintroduced the Electoral Bill, which was\r\nsubsequently laid aside by the Council on the ground that it had not\r\nsecured in the Assembly the absolute majority of all the votes required\r\nin the case of amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe value of any Second Chamber must rest upon its ability, and the\r\nexercise of its ability, to check dangerous tendencies in legislation.\r\nAs regards Victoria, it must be admitted that the greatest danger has\r\nlain in the tendency to extravagant expenditure due to the fatal\r\nfacility of obtaining almost unlimited advances from the British\r\ncapitalist.  Politicians have been tempted to outbid each other in the\r\nstruggle for popular support, and to promise the outlay of vast sums of\r\nborrowed money.  Judged with reference to this question, the\r\nLegislative Council cannot be regarded as having been efficient.  The\r\ngreatest waste of money has occurred in connection with the\r\nconstruction of railways from which there was no likelihood of adequate\r\nreturns, and with injudicious advances to Irrigation and Water Supply\r\nTrusts.  The Council has been hampered by the {127} restrictions\r\nimposed upon it by the Constitution Act, but it has not admitted that\r\nit is debarred from amending Railway Bills, though it has done so but\r\nsparingly, owing to the opposition which such action aroused in the\r\nAssembly.  It would seem that, at the time of the greatest output of\r\nthe Victorian gold mines and of the high prices obtainable for\r\nagricultural and pastoral produce, the Council was as much carried away\r\nby the prosperity of the Province as the Assembly, and formed an\r\nequally false estimate as to its continuance.  It appears, however, to\r\nhave been the first to realise the imminence of a reaction.  A\r\ncomparison of the British and Victorian finances shows that while, in\r\nthe former case, speaking broadly, provision is made only for the\r\nmaintenance of the public services and for some matters of national\r\nimportance, such as public instruction, in which all parts of the\r\ncountry share equally, in the latter case the expenditure includes the\r\nconstruction of public works which benefit particular localities, and\r\ngrants and subsidies which benefit particular industries.  Under these\r\nconditions members of the Assembly are subject to continual pressure\r\nfrom their constituents, which, it is contended, the members of the\r\nCouncil, owing to the greater size of the constituencies, are better\r\nable to resist.  As the whole body of the tax-payers are responsible\r\nfor the interest on the railways, a locality has everything to gain by\r\nthe {128} increase of its mileage; if it receives advances for works of\r\nirrigation and defaults upon the consequent obligations, it hopes to\r\ninduce the Government, through its Member, to grant more lenient terms.\r\nThe works in many cases are of doubtful value; the liability remains as\r\na burden upon posterity.\r\n\r\nThe evil is widely recognised, but opinions differ as to the remedy.  A\r\nstep in the right direction was taken by the appointment in 1890 of the\r\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Railways, which, it is suggested,\r\nshould be supplemented by a similar Committee whose duty it would be to\r\nreport upon all proposals for new works of water supply involving an\r\nexpenditure of a thousand pounds of State money.  Others ask that the\r\nCouncil should be allowed to amend Money Bills, and would do so with\r\nmore reason if the property qualification for membership were removed,\r\nas the electorate already includes the bulk of the stable elements of\r\nthe population.  But the greatest safeguard would appear to lie in the\r\nlessons of the past, and in the appointment of Standing Committees\r\nwhose antecedent sanction shall be essential to proposals for the\r\nexpenditure of national funds upon public undertakings.  It would be\r\nadvisable to define by Act of Parliament what classes of public works\r\nmight be carried out upon borrowed money; all others would then form a\r\ncharge upon current revenue.\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\nThe absence of any ultimate appeal in the case of a divergence of\r\nopinion between the two Houses has recently been discussed in several\r\nof the Provinces.  It has been pointed out that the power of the\r\nExecutive to make additional appointments to nominee Councils is an\r\nunsatisfactory device calculated to produce friction between the\r\nGovernor and his responsible advisers; that elective Councils can force\r\nupon the Assembly dissolutions from which they are themselves exempt;\r\nand that, in the majority of cases, the Councils are able, owing to the\r\nvariety of issues and the influence of local and personal\r\nconsiderations, to deny that any particular question has received the\r\nverdict of popular approval.  The measures rejected by the Victorian\r\nCouncil since 1891 include the Land and Income Tax Bill, the Opium\r\nBill, the Miners' Right Titles Bill, the Mallee Land Bill, and the\r\nVillage Settlements Amendment Bill.  The Council has rejected the Opium\r\nBill twice, and the Bill for the abolition of plural voting three times.\r\n\r\nThe question was considered in 1894 by a Victorian Royal Commission,\r\nwhich recommended that:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) If the Legislative Assembly shall in two consecutive sessions pass\r\nany Bill which shall not be passed by the Legislative Council, then,\r\nnotwithstanding such Bill when passed in the second session by the\r\nLegislative Assembly shall be in an amended form, if the same shall not\r\nin such second session be passed by the Legislative {130} Council, such\r\nBill, if the Assembly so determine by resolution, shall, in manner to\r\nbe duly provided, be submitted for acceptance or rejection to the\r\nvoters on the roll for the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"(2) In the event of the said Bill being duly accepted or approved of\r\nby the majority of the voters on the said roll who shall vote when a\r\npoll is taken, and upon a certificate to that effect to be duly given\r\nby the Speaker, the said Bill shall be transmitted to the Governor for\r\nhis assent.  Should, however, such Bill be rejected or disapproved of,\r\nthen, upon the certificate of the Speaker to that effect, the said Bill\r\nshall lapse for the session.\r\n\r\n\"(3) At least six weeks must intervene between the first and the second\r\npassing of the said Bill by the Legislative Assembly.\"\r\n\r\nMeasures based upon these lines were introduced during 1896 in the\r\nAssemblies of Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales, but, in the\r\nlatter case alone, reached the Legislative Council.  It was thought\r\nthat that body might receive the Bill favourably, as it would be\r\nbrought thereby into direct contact with the people, and might overcome\r\nthe jealousy which is at present felt against it.  In fact, it might\r\nattain to actual popularity by enabling the electorate to pronounce\r\ndirectly upon a distinct issue.  But this view did not prevail with the\r\nCouncil, which rejected the measure in the most summary manner.\r\n\r\nA supplementary proposal put forward in Victoria {131} is that, upon\r\nsubjects which cannot be referred in a clear and simple manner to the\r\nelectors, differences should be followed by a dissolution of both\r\nHouses, and, if an agreement is still impossible, by their joint\r\nmeeting as one Chamber.  In New Zealand, a Bill recently introduced by\r\nthe Premier, but not passed through the House of Representatives,\r\nprovided that, if a measure had been twice within fourteen months\r\npassed by one House and rejected by the other, the House which had\r\npassed it might call upon the Governor to convene a joint meeting of\r\nthe two Houses, which should finally dispose of it by approval,\r\nrejection, or amendment.  It will be noticed that the Council might\r\nthus secure the enactment of a measure which was opposed by the\r\nmajority of the popular representatives.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism of the two Houses in Victoria would seem to be to a\r\ngreat extent a reflex of an antagonism between town and country.  The\r\npopulation of the Province is estimated to have been 1,180,000 in 1895,\r\nthat of Melbourne and its suburbs 439,000, or 37 per cent. of the\r\nwhole.  Under these conditions, and owing to the greater cohesion of\r\ncompact electorates, a strong feeling has arisen in the rural districts\r\nthat Melbourne has a disproportionate voice in the affairs of the\r\nProvince, and that the balance should be redressed by the action of the\r\nCouncil.  It is also believed that the abolition of the plural vote\r\nwould lead to equal electoral districts which would increase the\r\nsupremacy of the capital {132} and the power of the Labour Party.  At\r\nthe present time they hold fifteen seats, all of which are urban or\r\nsuburban, and, though discredited by the collapse of the Trades Unions,\r\nare not without influence upon the Government.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of the total population contained in Melbourne and its\r\nsuburbs rose from 26 in 1861 to 43 in 1891, mainly as the result of the\r\nhigh protective tariff which aimed at making Victoria the principal\r\nmanufacturing centre of Australia.  Upon the consequent establishment\r\nof a large number of factories, the Government were soon compelled to\r\nintervene in the interests of the workers, and passed in 1873 the first\r\nAct dealing with the supervision of factories and workrooms.  It\r\ndefined a factory as any place in which not less than ten persons were\r\nemployed in manufacturing goods for sale, and provided that such places\r\nshould be subject, as to building, sanitation, &c., to regulations made\r\nby the central Board of Health, and that no female should be employed\r\ntherein without the permission of the Chief Secretary for more than\r\neight hours in any one day.  The measure failed in its purpose through\r\nthe indifference of the Municipalities, which were charged with its\r\nentire administration.  They appear to have been negligent in\r\nexercising the powers entrusted to them, and to have allowed themselves\r\nto be served by officers who were unacquainted with their duties.  In\r\nthe following years several measures were passed which {133} were\r\nconsolidated by the Factories and Shops Act of 1890.  Some new points\r\nof great importance had been introduced, which applied, however, only\r\nto cities, towns, and boroughs, unless they were extended to any shire\r\nat the request of its Council: the definition of a factory was amended\r\nso as to include all places in which four white men or two Chinamen\r\nwere employed in manufacturing goods for sale; such places had to be\r\nregistered, subject to the approval of the premises by the Local\r\nCouncil, and the employers were bound to keep a record showing the\r\nnames of the persons employed in the factory, the sort of work done by\r\nthem, and the names and addresses of outside workers; the employment of\r\nchildren under thirteen years of age was prohibited; machinery had to\r\nbe fenced in in order to prevent accidents, and persons in charge of\r\nsteam-engines and boilers, with a few exceptions, had to obtain\r\ncertificates of competency.  As regards the enforcement of these and\r\nother provisions, inspectors were authorised to enter a factory at any\r\nreasonable time, to make any pertinent inquiry and examination, to\r\ndemand the production of any certificate or documents kept in pursuance\r\nof the Act, and, generally, to exercise such other powers as might be\r\nnecessary for carrying it into effect.  Proceedings for offences\r\nagainst the Act were to be taken before two or more justices, who, upon\r\na conviction, would be guided by a prescribed scale of fines and\r\npenalties.  Finally, retail shops were {134} dealt with by a provision\r\nwhich limited the hours during which they might be kept open; but\r\ncertain categories of shops were explicitly excluded, and Municipal\r\nCouncils were given the power of altering the hours upon a petition of\r\na majority of the shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nThe absence of finality in such legislation was soon shown by the\r\ndemand for further restrictions, which was met by the Government by the\r\ncustomary expedient of the appointment of a Royal Commission.  The\r\ncensus of 1891 had given the number of persons employed in connection\r\nwith the manufacturing industries as 96,000, of whom less than a half\r\nwere in registered factories.  The remainder were working in shires, in\r\nlaundries and dye works, in workrooms other than Chinese in which less\r\nthan four persons were employed, or in their own homes.  The Commission\r\nconsequently, in the pursuance of their instructions to \"inquire and\r\nreport as to the working of the Factories and Shops Act, 1890, with\r\nregard to the alleged existence of the practice known as sweating and\r\nthe alleged insanitary condition of factories and workrooms,\" had a\r\nwide field of investigation, but turned their attention principally to\r\nthe industries in which the circumstances of the workers were believed\r\nto be most unfavourable.  In the clothing industry they found that,\r\nbeyond the common grievance of slackness of trade, those employed in\r\nfactories had little to complain of in the matter of {135} wages, but\r\nthat among the outworkers, owing to the depression, competition had\r\nreduced the rate of pay to the lowest level compatible with continued\r\nexistence.  They were informed of many cases, which have been\r\ncorroborated by factory inspectors and others, of women who, working\r\nfrom twelve to fourteen hours a day, were unable to earn more than ten\r\nor twelve shillings in a week.  It was contended that, as in other\r\ncountries, the competition was rendered more acute by those who were\r\nnot dependent upon the work for a livelihood.  Another result of this\r\ncompetition was seen in the policy pursued by several large firms which\r\nhad closed factories built at a heavy cost and were relying upon their\r\noperations being carried on by contractors, because they had been\r\nunable to produce goods at the factory at the rate at which they could\r\nbe turned out by those who employed the services of outworkers.  An\r\nattempt had been made by the women to protect their interests by the\r\nformation of a Tailoresses' Union, which, after a fitful existence,\r\ncollapsed in 1893.  Since that time, in the absence of any form of\r\ncombination, contractors had been able to play off the outworkers\r\nagainst the inworkers and against each other.  It may here be noted\r\nthat, according to a recent report of the Chief Inspector of Factories,\r\nthe inquiry caused the rate of payment to be lowered in consequence of\r\nthe publicity given to the very small wages paid by some firms engaged\r\nin the clothing trade.\r\n\r\n{136}\r\n\r\nIn the course of their inquiries into the furniture trade, the\r\nCommissioners found that the Chinese, by evasions of the Factory Act,\r\ntheir poor way of living, long hours of labour and acceptance of low\r\nwages, had practically ruined the European cabinet-makers.  Their\r\ncompetition was confined to that branch of the industry, but had\r\nindirectly affected it as a whole.  Statistics showed that in 1886\r\nthere were 64 registered European furniture factories employing 1,022\r\nmale hands, while in 1894 the number of factories had decreased to 46\r\nand of employes to 320.  On the other side, the number of Chinese\r\nemployed as carpenters and cabinetmakers had increased from 66 in 1880\r\nto 320 in 1886, and decreased to 246 in 1894.  It appeared that the\r\nChinese, having ousted the European workmen from the industry, had\r\nengaged in a keen competition among themselves, which had reduced\r\nprices to such a low level that many manufacturers had been compelled\r\nto close their factories and dismiss their workmen.  These latter had\r\ncommenced to make articles of furniture on their own account, and were\r\nreputed to be in a pitiable state of destitution.  The Commissioners\r\ncame to the conclusion that, while the unsatisfactory condition of\r\ntrade had contributed to the distress of the European cabinetmakers,\r\nthe competition of the Chinese had been the greatest factor in bringing\r\nabout the existing state of affairs.\r\n\r\nTheir recommendations were embodied in a {137} measure introduced in\r\n1895 and passed in the following session, but limited in its operation,\r\nby the action of the Council, to a period of four years.  Its most\r\nimportant provisions aim at the protection of the workers in those\r\nindustries in which they are least able to protect themselves.  The\r\ndesire of the Government was to get persons as far as possible to work\r\nin factories and to deal with the difficulty of outworkers by a system\r\nof permits.  Clause 13 of the Bill prohibited the making up of apparel\r\noutside a factory except by those who had received a permit from the\r\nchief inspector, which was not to be given unless he were satisfied\r\nthat the person applying for it was prevented by domestic duties or\r\nbodily affliction from working inside a factory or workroom.  Employers\r\nwere to keep a record showing the work done by holders of permits,\r\ntheir names and addresses, and the amount of remuneration, which was to\r\nbe forwarded periodically to the chief inspector, and might be\r\npublished in the Government Gazette at the discretion of the Governor\r\nin Council.  The number of outworkers would be reduced to a minimum,\r\nand the fear of publicity would act as a check upon their employers.  A\r\nfurther protection was afforded to makers of furniture and of clothing\r\nor wearing apparel, including boots and shoes, by clauses under which\r\nthe Governor in Council was authorised to appoint special Boards,\r\nconsisting of a chairman and four members, of whom two were to be\r\nrepresentatives {138} of occupiers of factories and workrooms in which\r\nsuch articles were prepared or manufactured, and two of the persons\r\nemployed in wholly or partly preparing such articles.  The Board was to\r\ndetermine the lowest rate which should be paid to the employes, whether\r\nworking inside or outside a factory.  The Assembly added another clause\r\nwhich authorised the appointment of similar Boards for the\r\ndetermination of the hours of labour in any manufacturing industry, but\r\nthe Council refused to accept it, and also rejected the clause which\r\nprohibited outside work by others than holders of permits.  They\r\nintroduced amendments which provided that the discretionary publication\r\nof particulars in the Gazette should be limited to cases in which an\r\nemployer had been convicted for some contravention of the Factories and\r\nShops Acts, and that the special Wage Boards should be elective, in the\r\nbelief that it would be dangerous to vest the power of appointment in\r\nthe Governor in Council, since it would actually be exercised by the\r\nChief Secretary.  The Government agreed to the former of these\r\namendments, as the value of the right of publication was lessened by\r\nthe Council's acceptance of the principle of the Wage Boards; but upon\r\nthe other points of difference a conflict ensued between the two\r\nHouses, which resulted in the final decision that the Boards are to be\r\nelective, and that outworkers will not be required to obtain a permit,\r\nbut, if engaged in the manufacture of clothing or {139} wearing\r\napparel, must register their names and addresses with the chief\r\ninspector, for the confidential use of the Department, and must answer\r\nall questions put to them by inspectors as to the names of their\r\nemployers and the rate of remuneration.  The Chief Secretary had\r\nexplained in the Assembly that the Government desired to obtain the\r\nregistration of outworkers in order that they might know from the\r\nindividuals themselves the addresses at which they were working, and\r\nwhether they were being paid in accordance with the prices fixed by the\r\nBoards.  It is also provided that a sub-contractor, equally with the\r\noccupier of a factory, must keep the prescribed record of all work\r\ngiven out by him.\r\n\r\nThe furniture trade, as has been seen, is one of those for which the\r\nGovernor in Council may cause special Boards to be elected; but it has\r\nbeen realised that, in the cabinet-making branch, owing to their\r\nsuperior numbers, the Chinese would obtain a controlling voice.  This\r\ndifficulty was met by an amending Bill which authorised the nomination\r\nof these Boards.  Other sections of the Act also aim at the protection\r\nof the white workman: one Chinaman is to be deemed to constitute a\r\nfactory, and no person employed in a factory or workroom in the\r\nmanufacture of any article of furniture is to work on a Sunday, after\r\ntwo o'clock on a Saturday, or between five o'clock in the evening and\r\nhalf-past seven in the morning on any other day of the week.  Furniture\r\nmade in Victoria is to be stamped legibly {140} and indelibly in such a\r\nmanner as to show whether it was manufactured by white or Chinese\r\nlabour.  It is noteworthy that, through the Boards which will fix the\r\nminimum rate of pay in the baking and furniture trades, the Victorian\r\nGovernment are making their first attempt to regulate the labour of\r\nmen; in the other trades affected by these Boards women form the vast\r\nmajority of the workers.\r\n\r\nThe general provisions of this Act as they affect factories include\r\ngreater stringency in the sanitary requirements, in the limitation of\r\nthe hours of labour of women and boys, and in the precautions against\r\naccidents.  Laundries and dye-works are constituted factories, and the\r\npowers of inspectors are in several respects strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe sections dealing with shops also deserve a word of notice.  The\r\nnecessity for further legislation was based by the Chief Secretary on\r\nthe ground that under the existing law Municipal Councils were not\r\nbound to give effect to petitions received from a majority of\r\nshopkeepers, and could only bind their own districts.  Besides, the\r\npenalties imposed for contravention of any law or bye-law had, in many\r\ncases, been so small that shopkeepers had been able to ignore it with\r\npractical impunity.  He therefore proposed that petitions should in\r\nfuture be addressed either to the Governor or to the local authorities,\r\nthat a metropolitan district should be constituted so as to render\r\npossible uniformity in the hours of closing shops, and that the\r\npenalties should be on a {141} fixed scale.  These proposals were\r\nembodied in the Act, as were others which provided that assistants in\r\nshops should have a weekly half-holiday, and that women and boys should\r\nnot be employed for more than a fixed number of hours in a week or day,\r\nnor for more than five hours without an interval for meals, and should\r\nhave the use of adequate sitting accommodation.  These provisions,\r\nhowever, were not to apply to the categories of shops excluded from the\r\noperation of previous Acts unless extended to them under regulations\r\nmade by the Governor in Council.  Soon after the passage of the Act a\r\nstrong feeling arose among the shopkeepers of Melbourne and its suburbs\r\nthat, as assistants had to receive a weekly half-holiday, shops should\r\nbe closed upon one afternoon in the week; but opinions differed as to\r\nwhether the day should be Saturday or Wednesday.  The shopkeepers in\r\nthe city were disposed to favour the former, those in the suburbs were\r\ndivided in their views.\r\n\r\nThe Act should be regarded as a humane attempt to minimise the\r\nsufferings of the outworkers and to improve the conditions of labour of\r\nthe toiling masses of the population.  The appointment of the special\r\nBoards is regarded with sympathy even by those who doubt the\r\npossibility of enforcing a minimum wage in the case of persons whose\r\ncompetition is intensified by the fear of starvation.  Two general\r\nconsiderations suggest themselves: that a vast discretionary power is\r\nvested in the Executive, {142} and that the inspectors will be\r\nconfronted with a task of hopeless magnitude.  On the first point it is\r\nto be noted that the Governor in Council, acting naturally upon the\r\nadvice of the Chief Secretary, may not only exercise the powers already\r\nmentioned, but may extend the provisions of the Act or any of them to\r\nany shire or part of a shire, and make regulations upon a large number\r\nof subjects connected with the efficient administration of all the\r\nFactories, and Shop Acts.  As regards the inspectors, who are eleven in\r\nnumber, it is to be feared that, though they may invite the\r\nco-operation of the police, they will be unable adequately to supervise\r\nfactories, watch the labour of the single Chinaman, protect the\r\nhome-worker from the tyranny of the contractor, and assure to\r\nassistants in shops the conditions to which they are legally entitled.\r\nThey will undoubtedly be fettered by the unwillingness of the workers\r\nto supply information which may lead to the loss of their employment.\r\n\r\nThe correlative of protection, which principally benefits the\r\nmanufacturer, is the direct encouragement of the enterprise of the\r\nproducer.  In this respect successive Governments have displayed an\r\neagerness which has not always been confined within the limits of\r\nprudence.  The borrowed capital sunk in the construction and equipment\r\nof the Victorian Railways is about L36,730,000, which returned in the\r\nyear 1895-6 a net profit on working of L855,000, being a deficit of\r\nL584,000 upon L1,439,000, the {143} annual charge for interest upon the\r\nloans; but a large proportion of this deficiency was due to the failure\r\nof the wheat crop and the consequent decrease in the amount of goods\r\ncarried along the lines.  Recent returns show that several lines not\r\nonly do not pay any interest on the capital expenditure, but do not\r\nearn even as much as is disbursed in working expenses.  The report of\r\nthe Railway Inquiry Board shows that the Assembly was actually disposed\r\nat one time to sanction the expenditure of a further sum of L41,000,000\r\nupon the construction of new lines; but the _Age_ newspaper published a\r\nseries of articles which showed clearly that national insolvency would\r\nfollow the approval of expenditure on such a gigantic scale.  The\r\nexposure attained its object, but involved the proprietor, Mr. David\r\nSyme, in actions for libel, brought by the Railway Commissioners, which\r\nextended, with intervals, over a period of four years.  Finally, he was\r\nproved to have been entirely justified in his language, but was saddled\r\nwith an enormous bill of costs as the reward of his patriotic efforts\r\non behalf of the community.  The danger that similar proposals might be\r\ncarried in the future was lessened in 1890, when the Standing Committee\r\nwas appointed as a check upon the extravagant tendencies and culpable\r\npliability of individual members.\r\n\r\nAgain, in connection with water supply and irrigation, the expenditure\r\nhas been on an extravagant scale.  The Melbourne Waterworks are {144}\r\njustified by the requirements of the metropolis, but those of Geelong\r\nand of Bendigo and adjacent areas commenced in 1865, and constructed at\r\na capital cost of L1,427,000, show an annual deficit of L35,000; and\r\nother national works which cost L830,000 are dependent for a return\r\nupon irrigation trusts, most of which are unable to meet their own\r\nliabilities.  Apart from this direct expenditure, the State has\r\nadvanced L2,438,000 to local bodies, urban and rural waterworks trusts\r\nand irrigation trusts.  Adding together these different amounts, we\r\nfind the total direct and indirect expenditure of the State to have\r\nbeen L4,695,000, and we learn from the report of a recent Royal\r\nCommission that the annual revenue is about L68,000, or less than 1-1/2\r\nper cent. upon the capital.  As the money bears an average interest of\r\n4 per cent., the loss to the consolidated revenue is at the rate of\r\nL120,000 a year.  The expenditure was based upon the principle that the\r\nnational credit should be pledged in order that farmers and land and\r\nproperty owners might be assisted to provide works of water supply\r\nwhich would accelerate the permanent settlement of many parts of the\r\nProvince.  Loans had been granted to municipalities before 1881, but in\r\nthat year the question was treated comprehensively by the Water\r\nConservation Act, which authorised the constitution of trusts for the\r\nconstruction of works of water supply for domestic purposes and the use\r\nof stock.  In 1883 the Act was amended so as to include trusts {145}\r\nformed for the promotion of works of irrigation.  The Urban Trusts and\r\nlocal bodies generally have met their obligations satisfactorily, with\r\nthe exception of some of the latter, which, instead of striking higher\r\nrates or increasing the charge for the water, appear to have hoped that\r\nthe State would step in and relieve them of their liabilities.  The\r\nRural and Irrigation Trusts also have attempted to throw the duty of\r\npaying interest on the cost of the works upon the taxpayers of the\r\nwhole province.  In the latter case the Public Works Department cannot\r\nbe absolved from blame.  It is clear from the report of the Commission\r\nthat money was advanced to Irrigation Trusts without an adequate\r\npreliminary investigation of the amount of water available or of the\r\nnumber of settlers who would make use of it.  \"The public mind was\r\nexcited at the time, and the gospel of irrigation was preached from one\r\nend of the Colony to the other.  The farmers had been suffering from a\r\ncycle of dry seasons, the price of produce was high, and the prospect\r\nof insuring their crops against the exigencies of climate by means of\r\nirrigation appears to have overruled all prudential considerations.\r\nSchemes were hastily conceived and as hastily carried out.  The\r\nquestion as to whether the cost of the undertaking would be\r\ncommensurate with the benefits to be derived therefrom, or whether the\r\nland could bear the burden that would be placed upon it, was apparently\r\nlightly considered, if considered at all.\"  But, according to an\r\nofficial who {146} had been concerned in the matter, the Department,\r\nfar from readily concurring in or urging on schemes, had done its\r\nutmost to restrain the popular enthusiasm.  Continued pressure had been\r\nexercised by deputations, generally supported by the Member for the\r\ndistrict, which tried to induce Ministers to set aside formalities in\r\nview of the great necessity for water and of the great benefit that\r\nwould ensue.  The lavishness of the Department, whatever may have been\r\nits cause, was equalled by that of the Trusts, which in most cases\r\nexpended the loan money as expeditiously as possible without regard to\r\nthe requirements of the district or the supervision of the\r\nundertakings; they did not realise that they would ever be called upon\r\nto provide for meeting the interest on the moneys advanced to them.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Government overrated the knowledge and\r\nability of the Trusts, and their recognition of the responsibility\r\ninvolved in the control of large sums of public money.  The Royal\r\nCommissioners recommended that, after Parliament had decided what\r\nconcessions should be made, the enforcement of the monetary obligations\r\nshould be transferred from the Department to the Audit Commissioners,\r\nwho should be vested with powers enabling them to take action to\r\nrecover arrears due to the State.  They believed that, in the absence\r\nof such a change, the Department, being subject to political pressure,\r\nmight make further concessions, and again allow matters to drift into\r\nan unsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\n{147}\r\n\r\nThe next instance of national expenditure in the promotion of\r\nenterprise comes under a different category: the State has, since 1878,\r\ndevoted to the encouragement of the gold-mining industry the sum of\r\nL800,000, which was not intended to give a direct return upon the\r\noutlay so much as to maintain the pre-eminence of Victoria among the\r\ngold-producing Provinces of Australasia.  Of this amount L455,000 was\r\nexpended in boring, the remainder in subsidies to mining companies and\r\nprospecting parties.  But, as in the case of railways and works of\r\nwater supply, the Government were confronted by the extreme difficulty\r\nof providing safeguards against the misapplication of the funds.\r\nDirect control by the Minister of Mines was proved neither to yield\r\ngood results nor to be satisfactory to the Minister, as he was\r\nsubjected to continual pressure from Members of Parliament.\r\nProspecting Boards were, accordingly, appointed in the seven mining\r\ndistricts into which the Province is divided, each Board consisting of\r\nfive members, the surveyor of the district, a member of the\r\nMine-owners' Association, a member of the Miners' Association, a member\r\nof the local mining board, and a representative of the municipalities.\r\nThese men were authorised to allocate all votes, and, according to a\r\nstatement of the present Minister, as they represented different\r\ninterests in the mining and different localities, they took a parochial\r\nview of their duties and developed \"a kind of unconscious log-rolling\"\r\n{148} which caused the grants, in many cases, to be devoted to entirely\r\nunprofitable objects.  The expenditure of the L800,000 is believed to\r\nhave been of the greatest value to several mining companies, but has\r\nproduced a direct return of only L11,526, an amount which would have\r\nbeen smaller had not the Minister threatened dividend-paying companies\r\nwith the forfeiture of their leases unless they repaid their loans to\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe Government have also attempted to increase the export of such\r\narticles as butter, wine, cheese, and frozen meat, for which a large\r\nmarket is believed to be obtainable in Great Britain.  Their policy has\r\nbeen to foster these industries by means of bonuses to producers,\r\nsubsidies to owners of factories, and the free use of cold storage at\r\nrefrigerating works, and to enforce a certain standard of quality as a\r\nnecessary condition of their assistance.  As the industry progresses\r\nthe bonus is reduced and finally withdrawn, and charges are made for\r\ncold storage which are sufficient to reimburse the State for its\r\noutlay.  Such a course has already been pursued in the most successful\r\ncase, that of butter, in which the value of the amount annually\r\nexported has risen from L51,000 in 1889-90 to L876,000 in 1895-6.  In\r\nthis manner the State is not permanently engaged, but initiates its\r\nexpenditure at the highest point and gradually releases itself from the\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the Government were confronted with {149} a large amount of\r\nmisery among the working classes, much of it undeserved, which had\r\nresulted from the collapse of many land companies and banking and\r\nbuilding associations.  An artificial prosperity, caused by the\r\ninflation of metropolitan values, had created a demand for the services\r\nof a disproportionate number of artisans, who, upon the inevitable\r\nreaction, were thrown suddenly out of employment.  Under these\r\ncircumstances the Ministry were called upon to do something to relieve\r\nthe distress, and passed a new Land Act which offered favourable terms,\r\nin the way of tenure and monetary advances, to those who were willing\r\nto settle upon the land.  They were enabled to take it up either\r\nindividually or in associations of not less than six persons who\r\ndesired to live near each other.  At the expiration of a year after the\r\npassage of the Act 4,080 applications had been received, of which 2,122\r\nhad been approved, 993 rejected, and 965 were under consideration; and,\r\nin order that the benefit might be immediate, the land had been made\r\navailable as speedily as possible and applicants had not been compelled\r\nto wait until blocks had been surveyed.  In view of the conditions\r\nunder which the settlements were formed it is not surprising to learn\r\nfrom subsequent official reports that the favourable anticipations\r\nhave, in numerous instances, not been realised, owing to the\r\nunsuitability of the soil, the inexperience or physical incapacity of\r\nthe settlers, or the absence {150} of a local demand for labour or of a\r\nmarket for the surplus produce.  Many of the associations have been\r\ndisbanded as the members were unable to work together harmoniously; and\r\nthose that are still in existence have, in almost every case, abandoned\r\nthe co-operative principle and are working their blocks on individual\r\nlines.  In 1896 the number of resident settlers was 2,127, who, with\r\ntheir wives and families, formed a total population of 8,802; they had\r\nreceived, during the three years, advances from the Government to the\r\namount of L57,000.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1893 also provided for the establishment of Labour Colonies.\r\nThe movement in this direction originated with a few people at\r\nMelbourne, who saw the futility of periodical doles to the destitute,\r\nwhich were of merely temporary assistance to them and did not place\r\nthem in the way of earning a permanent livelihood.  It was also felt\r\nthat, in the absence of any system similar to the English poor-law,\r\nwhich, whatever its evils, relieves the conscience of the community,\r\nministers were subject to continual pressure, which compelled them to\r\ninstitute public works for the sole benefit of the unemployed.  In 1892\r\nthe distress was met, as far as the public were concerned, by the\r\nsubscription of a large sum of money, which was distributed through the\r\nagency of the local branch of the Charity Organisation Society; but, in\r\nthe following year, the distress being still more acute, {151} the idea\r\nof a Labour Colony rapidly gained ground and was met by the Government\r\nby the grant of an area of 800 acres at Leongatha, some 80 miles from\r\nMelbourne, which enabled the promoters of the scheme at once to\r\ncommence their operations.  At the outset it had been intended that the\r\nfunds should be obtained, partly by private subscription, partly by\r\n_pro-rata_ contributions from the national exchequer; but, in the\r\nabsence of popular response, the Government deemed it advisable, at the\r\ncommencement of 1894, to take over the entire administration of the\r\ncolony, and appointed, as Honorary Superintendent, Colonel Goldstein,\r\nwho had been actively identified with the undertaking.  Colonel\r\nGoldstein states that the main purpose of the colony, which is based on\r\na German model, is to give temporary work at unattractive wages to the\r\nable-bodied unemployed in order that they may be prevented from passing\r\nover the narrow line which separates poverty from pauperism.  At first\r\nthe aged and infirm were admitted, but it was found that employment\r\ncould not be obtained for them and that their presence affected the\r\nvalue of the colony as a means of instruction for a class of men in\r\nwhom it is necessary to arouse a spirit of responsible independence.\r\nThey are, moreover, provided for by benevolent asylums and other\r\ncharitable institutions which receive large subsidies from the\r\nGovernment.  Consequently men beyond the age of 55 years are now only\r\nreceived in {152} exceptional cases.  All applicants are registered,\r\nand, if their alleged destitution is believed to be genuine, are\r\nforwarded by rail to the colony, where they receive free board and\r\nlodging.  The colonists are subjected to strict discipline, work for a\r\nweek without pay upon probation, and then earn wages which rise to a\r\nmaximum of 4s. a week; they receive no money while at the colony, but\r\nmay draw certain necessaries, or, if married, cause their wages to be\r\nremitted to their wives.  The work is so arranged that the capabilities\r\nof the colonists may be used to the best advantage and that they may be\r\nfitted as far as possible for agricultural employment, which is\r\nobtained for them by means of a Labour Bureau established at the\r\ncolony.  At the expiration of six months, or upon an accumulation in\r\ntheir favour of a credit balance amounting to 30s., colonists must,\r\nsubject to occasional exemptions, seek employment elsewhere, and may\r\nnot be re-admitted under a period of six weeks.  In this manner the men\r\neither obtain outside employment while resident at the colony or leave\r\nit possessed of a sum of money which renders them better able to search\r\nfor it; they have the alternative of applying subsequently for\r\nre-admittance.  The results obtained during the three years have been\r\nof a most satisfactory character; 1,832 men have passed through the\r\ncolony since its inception, of whom only 124 have been dismissed for\r\nfaults, and none for insubordination; 573 have had {153} remunerative\r\nwork found for them, and the remainder have earned sufficient ready\r\nmoney to enable them to set out in search of employment.  There have\r\nbeen 566 re-admissions of 307 men who have returned from one to eight\r\ntimes.  \"The majority of the men,\" says Colonel Goldstein, \"are of the\r\nshiftless sort, who cannot do anything for themselves.  As Leongatha is\r\n80 miles from Melbourne, we seldom see the genuine loafer there.  The\r\nmen who go are willing enough to work when shown how, but they seem\r\nunable to rouse themselves into any sort of vigour, to say nothing of\r\nenthusiasm, until they have been there a considerable time....\r\nNumerous instances could be given indicative of the generally helpless\r\nnature of the men.  There can be no doubt that employers, during the\r\ndepression, will first reduce their worst men.  Of these, many have\r\nsufficient energy to shift for themselves; the rest drift to the labour\r\ncolony.  Most of them have suffered severely from privation and\r\npoverty, and probably have had their dejected condition further\r\ndispirited by semi-starvation....  After a few months' stay it is\r\nsurprising to see the difference in their appearance, and, what is more\r\nto the purpose, their discovery that a new kind of life is opened to\r\nthem.  Bush-work gives them a healthier feeling of self-dependence than\r\nthey ever enjoyed before, especially so for men who have a trade behind\r\nthem ready when the chance comes.\"  The total outlay has amounted to\r\nL11,276, {154} which has been expended mainly upon farm appointments,\r\nimplements, and permanent improvements, and is represented by assets of\r\nthe value of L10,861.  The net cost must be regarded as exceedingly\r\nsmall in view of the fact that, as the great majority of the colonists\r\nare artisans and quite unused to bush or farm work, their labour is\r\nnecessarily slow and expensive, and that, as soon as a man begins to be\r\nuseful, he is selected for some private employer.  The Labour Colony\r\nhas, it is maintained, apart from the benefits conferred upon hundreds\r\nof individuals, paralysed the agitation of the unemployed; as long as\r\nit is in existence no able-bodied man need starve.\r\n\r\nFinally, a measure, passed in 1896, aimed at the protection of\r\npastoralists, farmers, and other cultivators of the soil by providing\r\nmachinery by which the State might grant loans to them, upon adequate\r\nsecurity, at a low rate of interest, with a sinking fund extending over\r\na long period of years.\r\n\r\nThe salient features of Victorian legislation are the strong note of\r\nhumanity and the confidence in the wisdom and efficiency of State\r\naction.  If this confidence has sometimes been misplaced, there is no\r\nreason to suppose that the Victorians have imposed upon themselves a\r\nburden that they are unable to bear.  They are an energetic race, who\r\nhave not only developed the resources of their own country, but have\r\nobtained large interests in New South Wales and Queensland.  If in the\r\npast {155} they were too much inclined to draw bills upon futurity,\r\nthey have had a sharp lesson which has taught them the necessity of\r\nretrenchment and compelled them to reduce their annual expenditure by a\r\nthird of the total amount.  It is impossible to form an unfavourable\r\nestimate of the prospects, or of the high average prosperity, of a\r\npopulation of less than 1,200,000 persons, which includes 185,000\r\nfreeholders and has accumulated at the Savings Banks L7,300,000 divided\r\namong nearly 340,000 depositors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{156}\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n_THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA_\r\n\r\nConstitutional history--The relations of Church and State--Natural\r\nimpediments to development--The construction of railways--The scarcity\r\nof water--The promotion of the mining and other industries--The absence\r\nof parties in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Australia received the privileges of Responsible Government\r\nmany years after the other Australasian Provinces; otherwise, its\r\nconstitutional development has proceeded upon similar lines.  The first\r\nGovernor was appointed in 1829, and administered the affairs of the\r\ncountry with the assistance of an Executive Council.  Two years later a\r\nLegislative Council was established which consisted solely of the\r\nmembers of the Executive Council, but it was subsequently widened by\r\nthe admission, at first, of unofficial nominee members, afterwards of a\r\nsufficient number of elected members to form a majority of the whole\r\nbody.  Then an agitation sprang up in the Province in favour of\r\nResponsible Government, and in 1889, after a unanimous vote of the\r\nLegislative Council, a Constitution {157} Bill was submitted by the\r\nGovernment, considered by the Council, and forwarded to the Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies.  In the House of Commons it met with\r\nconsiderable opposition, on the ground that the Crown Lands of the\r\nProvince should not be handed over to a population of only 46,000\r\npersons.  But, upon a favourable report of a Select Committee and\r\nrepresentation made by the Agents-General of the other Australasian\r\nProvinces, the point was decided in the sense desired by the Province,\r\nand, as the Bill passed rapidly through the House of Lords, it received\r\nthe Royal Assent in August, 1890.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution the Executive power is vested in the Governor,\r\nwho acts by the advice of a Cabinet composed of five responsible\r\nMinisters.  They are, at the present time, the Colonial Treasurer and\r\nColonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Railways\r\nand Director of Public Works, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and the\r\nMinister of Mines.  The Premier, Sir John Forrest, holds the offices of\r\nColonial Secretary and Colonial Treasurer, and the Minister of Mines,\r\nthe only Minister in the Upper House, controls the Postal and\r\nTelegraphic Departments.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative authority is vested in the two Houses of Parliament,\r\nthe Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly.  The Council\r\nconsists of twenty-one members, of whom a third retire every two years.\r\nThey are elected upon a property {158} qualification, and must have\r\nbeen resident for at least two years in the Province.  The Assembly\r\nconsists of thirty-three members, who must have resided at least one\r\nyear in the Province, and are elected upon a wider franchise for the\r\nperiod of four years.  No remuneration is paid to the members of either\r\nHouse, but they receive free passes over all Government Railways and,\r\nby courtesy, over those belonging to private companies.\r\n\r\nThe limitations upon the power of legislation possessed by the\r\nParliament of Western Australia are similar to those imposed upon the\r\nLegislatures of other Australian Provinces, except that the protection\r\nof the aborigines has been placed in the hands of an independent Board,\r\nnominated and controlled by the Governor.  It receives for the\r\nexecution of its duties 1 per cent. of the annual revenue of the\r\ncountry, but cannot carry them out without the active support of\r\nGovernment officials.  The existence of this Board is strongly resented\r\nby Western Australians as an unjust reflection upon them, and as an\r\nimputation that they cannot be trusted to deal in a just and humane\r\nmanner towards the natives; and the Premier, voicing the unanimous\r\nopinion of both Houses, has attempted, hitherto without success, to\r\nsecure the repeal of the obnoxious section of the Constitution Act.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Government in regard to the relations between\r\nChurch and State as affecting the endowment of religious bodies and the\r\nassistance {159} given to denominational schools was, until recently,\r\nthat grants should annually be voted by Parliament.  But the trend of\r\npublic opinion has been in the direction of secular education and the\r\ntermination of the payments made to the Churches.  The matter was,\r\naccordingly, during the session of 1895, dealt with by the\r\nEcclesiastical Grants Abolition Act and the Assisted Schools Abolition\r\nAct.  Previously the payments to the Churches had been at the rate of\r\nabout L3,500 per annum, of which the Church of England received L2,000,\r\nthe Roman Catholics L1,000, and the Wesleyans and Presbyterians L360\r\nand L160 respectively.  The grants have been commuted at ten years'\r\npurchase, and the capital amount is to be paid _pro rata_ out of the\r\nConsolidated Revenue Fund in two equal instalments to the recognised\r\nheads of each religious denomination.  This Bill was passed, with\r\nuniversal approval, through both Houses of Parliament, but a like\r\nunanimity was not manifested in regard to the Education question.  In\r\nfact, early in the session, the Premier had stated that he had no\r\nimmediate intention of dealing with it, but his hands were forced by\r\npopular opinion, as manifested by the result of several elections\r\nfought upon that issue.  Consequently, after a resolution passed by\r\nboth Houses that \"It is expedient that the Assisted\" (denominational)\r\n\"Schools should no longer form part of the public Educational system of\r\nthe Colony,\" and on the report of a Joint Committee, a Bill was\r\nintroduced by the Premier into the {160} Assembly fixing the sum to be\r\npaid as compensation, in lieu of grants in aid, at L20,000.  In 1894\r\none-third of the children being educated in the Colony were attending\r\nthe Assisted Schools, at a cost to the country of L2,093 for the\r\nAssisted, and L11,356 for the Government Schools.  The Bill was hotly\r\ndiscussed; the Opposition divided over the amount, and were only beaten\r\nby one vote, and it was finally decided that the compensation should be\r\nL15,000.  The whole of this money will be paid to the Roman Catholics,\r\nwho had alone taken advantage of the system.  There is a High School at\r\nPerth established by statute; otherwise little has been done in the\r\ndirection of secondary education, and Western Australia has no\r\nUniversity.  The advantages of primary education have been extended as\r\nfar as possible; any district which can guarantee the attendance of\r\nfifteen children can claim the erection of a school and the appointment\r\nof a teacher; but it is clear that, in a very sparsely inhabited\r\ncountry, no system can be devised which will reach the whole population.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Ministry has been, in the main, one of loans and\r\npublic works.  They were called upon, at the inauguration of\r\nResponsible Government, to administer an area of nearly a million\r\nsquare miles, thinly populated and penalised by great natural\r\ndrawbacks, such as the scarcity of good harbours, the difficulty of\r\ninland communication, and the absence over large tracts of country of a\r\n{161} sufficient supply of water.  These drawbacks the Government have,\r\nin various ways, done their best to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe principal ports of Western Australia are--on the south Albany and\r\nEsperance Bay, on the west Bunbury, Fremantle, and Geraldtown, and on\r\nthe northwest Cossack and Broome.  The most important of these are\r\nAlbany, a fine natural harbour, which is the point of call of the ocean\r\nliners, and Fremantle, the port of Perth.  All have been improved, as\r\nfar as conditions would permit, by dredging operations and the\r\nconstruction of piers and jetties, but very extensive works, for which\r\nthe sum of L350,000 has already been allotted, are being carried out at\r\nFremantle, in the hope of making it a good and commodious harbour for\r\nall classes of ocean vessels.  In the interests of safe navigation,\r\nlighthouses have been erected at various points along the coast.\r\n\r\nAs the rivers are mostly filled only during the rainy season, and\r\nunnavigable for any distance even for small boats, the methods of\r\ninternal transit are limited to road and rail.  The Government have\r\nregarded the construction of roads as a matter of national rather than\r\nof purely local importance, and have expended upon them large sums of\r\nmoney.  They are at present engaged in opening up stock routes to the\r\nNorth and between the Murchison and Coolgardie Goldfields.  Their\r\nrailway policy has been to render accessible the different resources of\r\n{162} the country.  The South-Western Railway from Perth to Bunbury,\r\nBusselton, and Donnybrook traverses country suitable for the growth of\r\ncereals and for mixed farming.  Its course is along the foot of the\r\nDarling Range, which is covered with valuable forests of jarrah.\r\nParliament has recently sanctioned two extensions: to Collie, an\r\nimportant coalfield, and to Bridgetown, the centre of an agricultural\r\narea.  The Eastern Railway, starting from Fremantle, passes through\r\nPerth and taps an important district adapted for general agriculture,\r\nfruit-growing, and viticulture; it connects with the Yilgarn Railway,\r\nwhich has now been completed to several points upon the Coolgardie\r\nGoldfields, and will be dependent for its returns upon their\r\nprosperity, as it passes through vast areas of arid scrub.  The\r\nNorthern Railway consists of short lines from Geraldtown, which pass\r\nthrough country suitable, in parts, for the growth of cereals, in\r\nothers, for pastoral purposes; it is to be continued to Cue, on the\r\nMurchison Goldfield.  The above are all Government railways, built\r\nunder private contract and equipped and managed by the State.  There\r\nare also two large private companies, the Great Southern Railway,\r\nconnecting Albany with Beverley, the terminus of the Eastern Railway,\r\nand the Midland Railway, connecting Geraldtown with Perth at points on\r\nthe Northern and Eastern Railways.  They were built upon the land-grant\r\nsystem, at a time when the Government were anxious to extend the\r\nrailways, {163} but were not in a position to incur the cost of their\r\nconstruction.  This system is not likely to be adopted again, as both\r\nCompanies have pursued an ungenerous policy in regard to the alienation\r\nof their lands, while the Midland Company were unable to complete their\r\nundertaking without the assistance of the Government, which, in return\r\nfor a mortgage of the whole line, guaranteed for them the interest and\r\nprincipal of a loan of L500,000.  In fact, during the session of 1896,\r\nthe Government, after negotiations with the Great Southern Railway\r\nCompany, obtained the authority of Parliament for the negotiation of a\r\nloan for the purchase of all its interests, including the permanent\r\nway, rolling stock, buildings, and unsold lands.\r\n\r\nIn the southern and western portions of the Province water is\r\nplentiful.  The northern portion is subject to terrible drought, such\r\nas that which a few years ago almost ruined the squatters and caused\r\nthe loss of three-quarters of a million sheep.  But the attention of\r\nthe Government has been mainly turned to the eastern division, which\r\nincludes the Yilgarn, Coolgardie, and Dundas Goldfields, and has an\r\naverage annual rainfall of about ten inches, and it is in this portion\r\nof the country that the heaviest expenditure was incurred during the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1895.  Thirteen large and two small tanks were\r\ncompleted on the Coolgardie Goldfields with a capacity of 13-1/2 millions\r\nof gallons and at a total cost of nearly L38,000.  Wells were {164}\r\nsunk, bores put down in the search for water, condenser plants erected,\r\nand new soaks opened up at advantageous places throughout the district.\r\nWells have also been sunk, and reservoirs constructed, on the Murchison\r\nand Pilbarra Goldfields, and in other parts of the country.  But the\r\ngreatest undertaking in this direction will be the construction of vast\r\nworks for the supply from a distance of water to the Coolgardie\r\nGoldfields.  Parliament has authorised the required loan, and may\r\ntherefore be presumed to concur with the Ministry in the belief that\r\nthe necessary water cannot be obtained on the spot by artesian bores or\r\notherwise.  The future of Western Australia is bound up with that of\r\nthe goldfields.  Should they fail through lack of water, recent\r\nimmigrants would leave the country, and their departure would cripple,\r\nif not ruin, the agricultural industry, and cause immediately a heavy\r\nfall in the revenue.  Under these circumstances, the scheme of the\r\nGovernment, even though it entails a very large expenditure, might be\r\njustified as being essential to the continued prosperity of the\r\nProvince.  A similar argument may be applied to the large sums spent\r\nupon the railways, since they, as well as the waterworks, should be\r\nremunerative; but when we find Parliament sanctioning, in one session,\r\napplications for loans amounting to seven millions--and bear in mind\r\nthe smallness of the population--we cannot but fear that the Province\r\nis beginning to borrow recklessly and may expose itself to the {165}\r\nfinancial troubles which have overtaken some of its Eastern neighbours.\r\n\r\nSo much for the natural difficulties and the attempts made, and about\r\nto be made, by the Government to overcome them; but they have\r\nrecognised that the heavy expenditure upon public works would be\r\nunjustifiable in the absence of simultaneous efforts to encourage the\r\noccupation and cultivation of the land and the development of the\r\nmineral resources; and they have, therefore, while not embarking upon a\r\npolicy of direct subsidies for the payment of the passages of\r\nimmigrants, offered every inducement to people to come to the Province\r\nof their own accord.  Intending settlers or companies can obtain, upon\r\nfavourable terms, land for pastoral or agricultural purposes, mineral\r\nleases, and concessions giving them the right to cut timber upon the\r\nState forests.  A miner can acquire, on the annual payment of ten\r\nshillings, a miner's right, entitling him to take possession of, mine,\r\nand occupy, unoccupied Crown Lands for gold mining in accordance with\r\nthe Mining Regulations.  The general conditions dealing with the\r\nalienation of Crown Lands are laid down in the Land Regulations, under\r\nwhich the Province has been divided into six districts, in order that\r\ndifferent terms may be made in accordance with the varying quality and\r\ncapabilities of the soil in different parts of the country.  Pastoral\r\nleases may be obtained at a rent ranging from five shillings to L1 a\r\nyear for 1,000 acres.  {166} Agricultural land is in most parts of the\r\ncountry sold at ten shillings an acre, to be paid either directly or by\r\nannual instalments; but the title to the land is not given until\r\ncertain stated improvements have been carried out upon it, in order to\r\nprevent its being held in an unimproved condition for speculative\r\npurposes, and residence is encouraged by the enforcement of a larger\r\nexpenditure in improvements upon occupiers who do not live upon their\r\nestates.  As a further inducement to settlers, the Government have set\r\napart special agricultural areas, which they cause to be surveyed\r\nbefore selection and marked out in blocks; they offer, under the\r\nHomesteads Act, 1893, free grants of land not exceeding 160 acres in\r\nextent, subject to stringent conditions as to residence and expenditure\r\nupon improvements; and they have established an agricultural bank which\r\nis authorised to make advances to farmers and other cultivators of the\r\nsoil.  The policy of the Government has had considerable success, as\r\nthe total area of cultivated land rose from 86,000 acres in 1886 to\r\n193,000 acres at the end of 1894.  But farmers have had to contend with\r\ngreat difficulties in the work and expense required for the clearing of\r\nthe land, and in the absence of a market for their produce.  A distinct\r\nimprovement, however, has obtained since the advent of a large\r\npopulation upon the goldfields, whose wants they may hope to supply.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Sir John Forrest and his colleagues have had\r\nmatters entirely in their favour.  {167} The credit of the Province has\r\nsteadily improved, in view of its mining operations; for the same\r\nreason the railways have shown the most satisfactory returns, and the\r\nreceipts from the Customs, under a tariff levied primarily for purposes\r\nof revenue, but partially protective in its incidence, have increased\r\nby leaps and bounds.  Again, in Parliament the Ministry have met with\r\nbut little opposition.  Upon the inauguration of Responsible\r\nGovernment, the Premier had the prestige of former office under the\r\nCrown, and found himself face to face with an Assembly which had no\r\nexperience in the principles of Party Government.  The members were\r\nintimately acquainted with each other, and criticism of the Ministry\r\nwas resented as a personal insult.  The so-called Opposition made no\r\nserious attempt to overthrow the Government, partly because, in the\r\ndearth of men of both ability and leisure, there was no material for\r\nthe formation of an alternative Ministry; partly because they were in\r\nagreement with them upon most of the questions that came up for\r\ndiscussion.  The policy of the construction of public works out of\r\nloans was generally acceptable, and soon justified itself by results,\r\nowing, to a great extent, to the development of the goldfields.  Mines\r\nhad been worked in Western Australia for a considerable time, but\r\nattracted little attention until the great discoveries at Coolgardie\r\nand in its neighbourhood.  These came at a most opportune moment.  A\r\nlarge amount of capital in Europe was seeking {168} profitable\r\nemployment; the stagnation of business in the Eastern Provinces of\r\nAustralia had brought hardship upon the labouring population and made\r\nthem anxious to seek work elsewhere; and the success of the South\r\nAfrican Mines had caused the British public to look favourably upon\r\nmining speculations.  As a result, mines were successfully floated in\r\nLondon and in Australia, immigrants poured in from the Eastern\r\nProvinces, mercantile firms established branches at Perth and at other\r\ncentres, and the revenue obtained from the Customs and from the\r\nRailways and other public departments increased to an unparalleled\r\nextent.  But the increase of revenue naturally caused a large increase\r\nin the work of the departments concerned, and they failed signally to\r\nmeet the additional demands upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Telegraphic and Postal Department obtained an evil pre-eminence\r\nthrough its irregularity and untrustworthiness, and caused much\r\ninconvenience and monetary loss, owing to the delay in the delivery of\r\nletters and telegrams.  Complaints were also rife against the Railway\r\nDepartment, as imported machinery lay for months at Fremantle, because\r\nthe Government had not sufficient trucks in which to take it up the\r\nline to its place of destination.  It must be remembered, however, that\r\nthe public services had been organised to meet the needs of a far\r\nsmaller population and were called upon to carry out work which had\r\nincreased at a {169} rapidity which could not be foreseen.  A certain\r\namount of difficulty was, under these circumstances, bound to occur, as\r\nthe Government would not have been justified in launching into heavy\r\nadditional expenditure until they had reasonable assurance of the\r\npermanence of the goldfields and of the consequent increase of business.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Government of Western Australia has been that of a huge\r\nland development company; constitutional questions have been in the\r\nbackground.  But a tendency is already perceptible among recent\r\nimmigrants to demand manhood suffrage, payment of members, and other\r\nitems of democratic legislation to which they have been accustomed in\r\nthe Eastern Provinces.  This movement, however, will be checked by the\r\nconservative instincts of the native population, and by the general\r\nbelief that the Ministry have guided the destinies of the province\r\nwisely during the crucial years which have succeeded the inauguration\r\nof Responsible Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{170}\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n_DISCURSIVE NOTES ON TASMANIA_\r\n\r\nThe restriction of the immigration of coloured races--Betting and\r\nlotteries--The adoption of a modification of Hare's System of\r\nVoting--Conflicts between the two Houses of Parliament--Finance and\r\ntaxation--Land Grant Railways.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session of the Tasmanian Parliament in 1896 was of a quiet\r\ncharacter as far as the Ministerial programme was concerned.  Measures\r\nwere introduced, among others, for the extension to certain coloured\r\nraces of the restrictions imposed upon the immigration of the Chinese,\r\nfor the better suppression of public betting and gaming, for the\r\ninspection of certain products intended for export, for the\r\nconsolidation and amendment of the electoral laws, and for the\r\nreference to a plebiscite of disputes between the House of Assembly and\r\nthe Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nThe first of these measures was introduced in pursuance of a resolution\r\npassed at the Premiers' Conference at the commencement of the year, and\r\nwas based upon the Chinese Immigration Act, 1887, which limits the\r\nnumber of Chinese, not being {171} British subjects, that may be\r\nbrought to Tasmania in any vessel in proportion to its tonnage, and\r\nthrows upon the masters of the vessels the duty of paying a capitation\r\nfee of L10 for every such Chinaman that they introduce into the\r\nProvince.  It was proposed to apply this provision to \"all male persons\r\nbelonging to any coloured race inhabiting the Continent of Asia or the\r\nContinent of Africa, or any island adjacent thereto, or any island in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean or Indian Ocean, not being persons duly accredited on\r\nany special mission to Her Majesty by the Government or ruler of any\r\ncountry, state, or territory, or to Tasmania under the authority of the\r\nImperial Government.\"  The Bill, which also exempted from its operation\r\nthe native races of Australia and New Zealand, was accepted by the two\r\nHouses of Parliament, but was reserved by the Governor for the Imperial\r\nassent, which was likely to be withheld, as the measure would\r\nundoubtedly lead to the strongest protests from the Japanese, who will\r\nscarcely submit to be treated as an inferior race by an Australian\r\nProvince.  Should this attitude be adopted, a considerable amount of\r\nfriction may be anticipated, as measures on similar lines have been\r\nadopted by the two Houses of Parliament in some of the other Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Bill for the better suppression of betting and gaming should rather\r\nhave been called a Bill for their regulation, as, while it aimed at the\r\nentire suppression of book-makers and betting-houses, it did not {172}\r\ninterfere with the totalisator or with any lotteries which had been\r\nauthorised by Act of Parliament or were carried on solely by\r\ncorrespondence through the post-office, and in accordance with\r\nregulations which might be made by the Governor in Council.  The\r\ntotalisator is now to be found in all the Australasian Provinces except\r\nNew South Wales and Victoria; in the latter its adoption has widely\r\nbeen advocated, but has been opposed by the clergy, who have entered\r\ninto an unconscious alliance with the book-makers.  The organisers of\r\nthe large \"Tattersall\" Sweeps, which are worked from Tasmania and\r\nattract subscribers from all parts of Australasia, will also be\r\nunaffected by the Act; to a certain extent they will even be benefited,\r\nas they will be freed from the competition of many of their more humble\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nThe measure dealing with the inspection of exported produce was deemed\r\nadvisable on account, partly of the proposed action of other Provinces\r\nin regard to Tasmanian fruit, partly of the importance of enabling\r\nTasmanian producers to obtain an official certificate of the quality of\r\ntheir produce.  In outside markets, it was contended, in which the\r\nProvinces come into competition with each other, dealers gave the\r\npreference to, and paid higher prices for, imports which had received\r\nthe imprimatur of the Government stamp.  The interests of the community\r\nalso would be protected against those of selfish and dishonest traders.\r\nIt was, therefore, {173} proposed that all dairy produce, fruit, or\r\ntimber intended for exportation should be examined by an inspector, and\r\nshould not be shipped until he had certified that it was sound, free\r\nfrom disease, and likely to reach its destination in a good state of\r\npreservation.  The Governor in Council was also authorised to make\r\nregulations for the inspection of the ships in which such produce was\r\nto be carried, for the protection from unnecessary suffering of live\r\nstock when carried by sea, and for the branding and shipment of\r\nproducts approved of by an inspector for exportation.  The Bill was\r\nread a second time in the Assembly on the understanding that it would\r\nbe referred to the persons who would principally be affected by it, and\r\nwas so unfavourably received by them, and especially by the\r\nfruit-growers, that it was shortly afterwards dropped.  In several\r\nProvinces inspection has been accompanied by a system of bonuses to\r\nproducers, but in this respect Tasmania has taken no action.\r\nSubstantial bonuses were, however, offered some fourteen years ago to\r\nmanufacturers of considerable quantities of sugar, sacking, and woollen\r\ngoods, but of these the last alone has been claimed.\r\n\r\nTasmania has not followed the example of New South Wales and South\r\nAustralia in the adoption of manhood or adult suffrage and the\r\nabolition of plural votes, but has passed a new Electoral Bill which\r\nadopts a modification of Hare's system, and thus secures a considerable\r\nrepresentation of the {174} minority in both Houses of Parliament.  It\r\nprovided, as introduced, that the two principal cities, Hobart and\r\nLaunceston, which return, respectively, six and three, and four and\r\ntwo, representatives to the Assembly and Council, should thenceforward\r\nbe single constituencies, and that \"each elector shall have one vote\r\nonly, but may vote in the alternative for as many candidates as he\r\npleases; and his vote shall be deemed to be given in the first place\r\nfor the candidate opposite whose name in the ballot-paper the figure 1\r\nis placed; but in the event of its not being required to be used for\r\nthe return of such candidate, it shall be transferable to the other\r\ncandidates in succession, in the order of priority indicated by the\r\nfigures set opposite their respective names; and the elector shall\r\ninsert opposite the names of the candidates for whom he wishes to vote,\r\nthe figures 1, 2, 3, and so on, in the order of his preference.\"  The\r\nmethod by which the returning officer was to decide who were the\r\nsuccessful candidates was so complicated as to require two pages of the\r\nBill for its explanation.  Briefly stated, it was as follows: the total\r\nnumber of votes divided by the number of representatives being the\r\n\"Quota\" necessary for the election of candidates, the returning officer\r\ndeclares the candidates who have a number of first votes equal to or\r\ngreater than the quota to be elected; he then notes how many of the\r\nsecond votes on the papers of the successful candidates are given to\r\neach of the other candidates, {175} and distributes the surplus votes\r\namong them in accordance with their respective proportions.  One or\r\nmore additional candidates are probably thereby elected, and the\r\nprocess is repeated until the requisite number are elected or a further\r\nquota is no longer reached.  In the latter case, the candidate who has\r\nthe smallest number of votes is excluded, and the second votes of those\r\nwho supported him in the first instance are counted to the other\r\ncandidates.  The second votes of the candidates who successively become\r\nlowest on the list may be distributed, as often as may be necessary,\r\namong the remainder; in this manner a final result must at length be\r\nobtained.  The Assembly provided by an amendment that each elector\r\nshould vote for as many candidates as there were vacancies, while\r\nsignifying the order of his preference; the Council reduced the number\r\nof requisite votes by one-half, and limited the operation of the Bill\r\nto the next general election.  A doubt was expressed whether the\r\nbenefits would counterbalance the additional trouble and inevitable\r\nconfusion which would attend the first application of the new system.\r\nIt was also contended that, among a population of not more that 160,000\r\npersons, if the experiment were worthy of a trial, it should be\r\nextended to the whole country.  The only other electoral peculiarity\r\nthat I have noted in Australia is to be found in Queensland.  Under an\r\nAct of 1892 which deals with the election of members of the Assembly,\r\nan elector may \"indicate on his {176} ballot-paper the name or names of\r\nany candidate or candidates for whom he does not vote in the first\r\ninstance, but for whom he desires his vote or votes to be counted in\r\nthe event of any candidate or candidates for whom he votes in the first\r\ninstance not receiving an absolute majority of votes.\"  These\r\ncontingent votes are not counted unless the requisite number of\r\ncandidates fail to obtain an absolute majority of all the primary\r\nvotes; they are of no value where the candidates are not in the ratio\r\nof more than two to one to the vacancies, as it is provided that in\r\nsuch cases the candidates who receive the greatest number of votes\r\nshall be elected.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the four Provinces, New South Wales,\r\nVictoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, which decided in favour of\r\npopular election of the delegates to the new Federal Convention and the\r\nsubsequent approval or rejection of the Draft Constitution by a direct\r\npopular vote, are those in which the Ministry advocate a plebiscite for\r\nthe settlement of disputes between the two Houses of Parliament.  The\r\nacceptance of the Federation Enabling Bill by the Legislative Councils\r\nof these Provinces must weaken the moral force of their opposition to\r\nthe plebiscite, as it may reasonably be argued that, if the people can\r\nbe trusted to give an intelligent vote upon the most important of all\r\nAustralian problems, they can still more be trusted to deal with any\r\nquestion of current politics.  In Tasmania Ministers are {177}\r\nconfronted with a Legislative Council which continually amends, as well\r\nas rejects, their financial proposals, justifying its attitude upon the\r\nwording of the Constitution Act of 1854.  The section in question\r\nstates that \"all Bills for appropriating any part of the revenue or for\r\nimposing any tax, rate, duty, or impost shall originate in the House of\r\nAssembly, and it shall not be lawful for the House of Assembly to\r\noriginate or pass any vote, resolution, or Bill for the appropriation\r\nof any part of the revenue, or of any tax, rate, duty, or impost for\r\nany purpose which shall not have been first recommended by the Governor\r\nto the House of Assembly during the session in which such vote,\r\nresolution, or Bill shall be passed.\"  As the right of amendment is not\r\nspecifically withheld, as in the Victorian Constitution, the\r\nLegislative Council assumes its possession.  The case for the\r\nplebiscite was put by the Premier and the Treasurer upon the second\r\nreading of the Bill.  Sir Edward Braddon stated that the financial\r\nprivileges of the Assembly had continually been infringed by the\r\nCouncil, and that, on one occasion, in reference to the Drawbacks Bill,\r\nthey had almost assumed the power of initiating a money vote.\r\nCuriously enough, the principal question mentioned by him as suitable\r\nfor the application of the plebiscite was that of Female Suffrage,\r\nwhich, introduced as a private measure, had been rejected by the\r\nCouncil after he had failed to secure its defeat in the Assembly.  In\r\nthe {178} preceding session, he said, the Assembly had vainly asked the\r\nCouncil to agree to a joint dissolution of both Houses when a Bill had\r\ntwice been rejected and a General Election had intervened.  A similar\r\nmeasure, passed in South Australia in 1881, had operated most\r\nsuccessfully, its mere presence on the Statute Book having put an end\r\nto the deadlocks which had previously been of constant occurrence.  It\r\nis probable, however, that the comparative absence of disputes has\r\nmainly been due to the democratisation of the Council, which has\r\nbrought it into close touch with the feeling of the Assembly; and that,\r\nin Tasmania, where the electors for the Council are only one in five of\r\nthose for the Assembly, a joint dissolution would produce little change\r\nin the _personnel_ of the former body.  The Treasurer, Sir Philip Fysh,\r\ntreating the subject historically, pointed out that the Council had\r\nthrown out year after year votes, first passed in 1863, for the\r\nexpenditure of L103,000 upon the construction of roads and bridges, and\r\nhad several times rejected the Launceston and Western, Hobart and\r\nLaunceston, and Mersey and Deloraine Railway Bills.  They had three\r\ntimes refused to accept a Bill for the re-assessment of the land of the\r\nProvince with a view to the imposition of a tax on unimproved values.\r\nAs regards its opposition to the proposed expenditure of borrowed money\r\nupon the construction of railways, roads and bridges, it would appear\r\nthat the Council in most cases acted {179} wisely, and that the\r\nProvince would have been benefited if it had persisted in its\r\nopposition.  The total public debt at the end of June, 1896, was nearly\r\nL8,150,000, exclusive of L215,000 in temporary Treasury Bills and\r\nL250,000 in Local Inscribed Stock, and entailed an annual liability for\r\ninterest of L313,000.  Towards this amount, the works which should be\r\ndirectly reproductive, such as the railways and the postal and\r\ntelegraphic services, returned a net revenue, after payment of working\r\nexpenses, of only L26,000.  It may be contended, of course, that the\r\ncountry could not have been developed in the absence of a large\r\nexpenditure; but, as the liability forms a heavy burden upon so small a\r\npopulation--a burden, indeed, which might have become almost unbearable\r\nbut for the valuable discoveries of minerals--the Council seems to have\r\nhad abundant justification for its efforts to check the extravagant\r\ntendencies of the Assembly.  The Ministry, after passing the second\r\nreading of the Bill in the Assembly by a small majority, withdrew it,\r\nas there was no possibility of getting it through the Council; its\r\nintroduction appears to have been due to the desire that it should be\r\ndiscussed at the pending General Elections.  The principal clause\r\nprovided that \"any Bill which shall be passed by the House of Assembly\r\nin two consecutive sessions of Parliament, and which shall be rejected\r\nby the Legislative Council in each of {180} two such consecutive\r\nsessions, may be submitted for the approval of the people of Tasmania\r\nby means of a general poll of, or referendum to, the electors for the\r\nHouse of Assembly.\"  An interval of not less than six weeks was to\r\nelapse between the two sessions, and where a Bill had been amended by\r\nthe Council, the Assembly was to be vested with the final decision\r\nwhether the amendments effected such substantial alterations as to be\r\ntantamount to a rejection, and might present an address to the Governor\r\nrequesting that a Bill which had been rejected twice or substantially\r\naltered might be submitted to a general vote of the electors.  A bare\r\nmajority of the votes so recorded was to be sufficient to secure the\r\nenactment of the measure subject to the constitutional rights of the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThe placid progress of the Session was impaired by the introduction of\r\na private railway Bill, which led to many nights of contentious debate\r\nand much hostility among the various sections in the Assembly.  All the\r\nrailways are owned by the State with the exception of a few short lines\r\nin the Northern and Western portions of the Province which have been\r\nconstructed by Mining Companies without any concessions from the\r\nGovernment.  During recent years the Western district has become an\r\nimportant mining centre, and should, in the opinion of most Tasmanians,\r\nbe connected by railway with either Launceston or Hobart.  But the\r\ncondition of the {181} finances is such, as has already been seen, that\r\nthe Government cannot venture to undertake the construction of further\r\npublic works unless it can be shown that they will immediately give an\r\nadequate return upon the outlay.  The small surplus of the last two\r\nyears was obtained at the cost of rigid retrenchment and high direct\r\ntaxation, an income tax of eightpence in the pound upon incomes derived\r\nfrom personal exertion, and a shilling upon those derived from\r\nproperty, and a land-tax of a halfpenny in the pound upon the capital\r\nvalue of land.  It, therefore, became necessary, if the construction of\r\nthe line or lines were not to be postponed indefinitely, that the aid\r\nof private enterprise should be invoked and that concessions should be\r\noffered which would be sufficient to attract private capitalists.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 a Bill was passed which authorised the Van Diemen's Land\r\nCompany to construct a railway of about forty miles in length, which\r\nwould place the West Coast in communication with Emu Bay in the North.\r\nAt a distance of eighteen miles from the latter place is Ulverstone,\r\nwhich is directly connected with Launceston, and the Government have a\r\nbalance from loan funds which may be devoted to the construction of a\r\nrailway across the intervening space.  The inducement offered to the\r\nCompany was the right to mark off, within certain areas, twelve blocks\r\nof 320 acres of mineral land, which would be granted to them upon the\r\n{182} completion of the railway.  They were limited in the charges\r\nwhich they might make for the carriage of passengers and the conveyance\r\nof merchandise, were to pay a royalty of 2-1/2 per cent. upon the gross\r\nvalue of all minerals obtained by them in addition to the statutory\r\nincome tax of one shilling in the pound, and were to be liable, after\r\nthe expiration of twenty-one years, to the resumption of the railway\r\nand all its appurtenances by the Government at the price of 20 per\r\ncent. above the actual cost of construction.  At the end of 1896 the\r\nCompany had not taken the initial steps towards the commencement of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nThe proposal made by a Victorian Syndicate and submitted to Parliament\r\nduring the session of 1896, aimed at the connection by railway of the\r\nWest Coast with some point on the State lines in the South.  In return\r\nfor the construction of the railway, which would be about a hundred\r\nmiles in length, the promoters asked for a concession of large areas of\r\nland along its proposed route and for considerable rights to make use\r\nof the rivers in its vicinity, which are running to waste in the\r\ngreatest abundance, as sources of electrical energy.  As the railway\r\nwould, admittedly, be worked at a loss for many years, they based their\r\nhopes of a profit upon the probability of the discovery of minerals and\r\nupon the generation of electricity, which they would either use\r\nthemselves or dispose of to companies mining on land belonging to the\r\n{183} State.  The district in question, it may be stated, is believed\r\nto be of little agricultural value, but to be likely to carry minerals,\r\nthough it has not adequately been prospected.  After its second reading\r\nthe Bill was referred to a select committee, which made reductions in\r\nthe concessions, and these were further reduced, after prolonged\r\ndebate, upon its reconsideration in the Assembly.  I have mentioned\r\nthese details in order to show that, while the State was not in a\r\nfinancial position to undertake the direct construction of railways\r\ndeemed to be necessary for the development of the resources of the\r\ncountry, the Assembly was not unmindful of the interests of posterity,\r\nand sought to reduce the inevitable concessions to the lowest possible\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{184}\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n_FEMALE SUFFRAGE_\r\n\r\nI do not propose, in the present chapter, to discuss the hackneyed\r\narguments for and against female suffrage, but to indicate the progress\r\nof the movement in the several Provinces of Australasia, and to note\r\nsome of the results of the adoption of adult suffrage in South\r\nAustralia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other Provinces, we are bound to consider the existing\r\nfranchise for the election of members of the Assembly in order to\r\nrealise what would be the effect of extending it to women upon similar\r\nterms.  In Victoria manhood suffrage would be superseded by adult\r\nsuffrage; in New South Wales and Western Australia, where residence of\r\nthree and six months, respectively, forms a qualification, the vast\r\nmajority of women would obtain a place on the rolls; but in Tasmania\r\nand Queensland the right to exercise the franchise would be confined,\r\npractically, to widows and women of independent means.\r\n\r\n{185}\r\n\r\nWe are also bound to take into consideration the constitution of the\r\nLegislative Council in order to gauge the full significance of female\r\nsuffrage.  If it is elective, as the electors must be qualified as\r\nfreeholders, leaseholders, or occupiers, the vote would be confined to\r\nwomen of independent means and widows or spinsters in personal\r\noccupation, and, while the wife and daughters of the poor man would\r\nnecessarily be excluded from the register, those of the rich man might,\r\nas has been done in South Australia, receive special gifts of freehold\r\nproperty which would be sufficient to render them eligible.  To this\r\nextent, therefore, as in Tasmania and, to a small degree, wherever\r\nplural voting is allowed, female suffrage would constitute a new\r\nproperty vote.  Similar conditions would not prevail when the members\r\nof the Council are nominated upon the recommendation of Ministers who\r\nare subject to the control of the popular representatives.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Victoria will be the next Province to follow the\r\nexample of South Australia and New Zealand.  A ministerial measure\r\nwhich would have introduced female suffrage, though only in the\r\nconstituencies of the Assembly, has twice been passed by that House.\r\nOn the first occasion it was rejected by the Council, on the second it\r\nwas laid aside on the ground that it had not been approved by the\r\nabsolute majority which is required in the case of amendments of the\r\n{186} constitution.  Both Bills were rendered distasteful to the\r\nCouncil by the inclusion of a provision for the abolition of the plural\r\nvote, but it is unlikely that the first would, apart from that fact,\r\nhave been accepted.  Many members of the Council, I was told, are\r\nfavourable to female suffrage, but would have voted in accordance with\r\ntheir opinion that important constitutional changes should not be\r\npassed until they have been placed before the electorate.  As the life\r\nof the Assembly may not exceed three years, the reference need not long\r\nbe delayed.\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania, in 1896, the House of Assembly passed a private Bill\r\ncontaining a similar limitation to that in the Victorian measure, and\r\nwas equally unable to secure the concurrence of the Council.  A\r\nresolution in favour of female suffrage has been adopted by a large\r\nmajority in the Assembly of New South Wales, but the question has not\r\nbeen taken up by either of the recognised parties.  The Premier may be\r\nreckoned as a personal supporter, but declines to move in the matter in\r\nview of differences of opinion in the Cabinet.  Neither in Western\r\nAustralia nor in Queensland does the subject arouse much interest.\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of feeling in five of the six Australian Provinces.\r\nIn South Australia an arduous contest was concluded in 1894 by the\r\npassage of an Act which placed women upon an absolute equality with men\r\nin the right to vote for {187} members both of the Assembly and of the\r\nCouncil.  It is unnecessary to trace the history of the agitation which\r\nmay be said to have commenced in 1888 upon the formation of the Women's\r\nFranchise League, though a Bill for the enfranchisement of women of\r\nproperty had previously been introduced.  Thenceforward it was pursued\r\nvigorously, and culminated in 1893, when the Government pronounced in\r\nfavour of adult suffrage.  But the difficulties were not at an end: the\r\nBill of that year was wrecked, mainly because its adoption was to be\r\ndependent upon an affirmative plebiscite; reintroduced in the following\r\nyear without the obnoxious clause, it was passed through both Houses of\r\nParliament, though only by the bare statutory majority in the Assembly,\r\nand shortly afterwards received the Queen's assent.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the debates the Premier, who holds the portfolio\r\nof Attorney-General, said that, if women were entitled to vote, they\r\nwould have the right to sit in Parliament, and the Assembly, by\r\ntwenty-eight votes to eight, refused to exclude them.  A doubt has\r\nsince been expressed, which is not shared by the Ministry, whether they\r\nare qualified to be elected to the Council.  I have not had the\r\nopportunity to read the arguments, which concern the interpretation of\r\nseveral statutes, but they would be of no great interest, the main\r\npoint being that Parliament intended to enable women to sit in both\r\nHouses.  {188} In New Zealand, on the other hand, the enfranchising Act\r\nof 1893 expressly denied to women the right of election to the House of\r\nRepresentatives or nomination to the Council; and the succeeding House,\r\nthough elected under adult suffrage, refused to go back upon this\r\ndecision.  The subsequent proposal of the Premier that women should be\r\neligible for nomination to the Council, was intended, I believe, partly\r\nas a bid for their support, partly as a means of casting ridicule upon\r\nthe non-representative body.\r\n\r\nThe first elections in South Australia under the new franchise were\r\nheld early in 1896, and, apart from a few rural constituencies in which\r\nthe issues were personal rather than political, were contested under\r\nthree recognised programmes.  The National Defence League, or\r\nOpposition, mentioned in its programme no items which were likely to be\r\nespecially attractive to the female voters, and treated as open\r\nquestions temperance legislation, and religious instruction in State\r\nschools; the Labour platform, with discreet vagueness, advocated any\r\nequitable and reasonable claims of women for the amendment of the laws;\r\nand the Ministerial policy, as enunciated by the Premier, included an\r\namendment of the Licensed Victuallers' Act in the direction of greater\r\nlocal control over licenses, and various measures of social reform, of\r\nwhich the principal were the raising of the age of consent, the\r\nsimplification of the remedies of deserted wives, {189} and the\r\nrestriction of the importation and sale of opium.  It should be\r\nmentioned, however, that, as the Labour Party are united in a close,\r\nthough independent, alliance with the Government, the supporters of the\r\none in many cases voted for the candidates of the other.  In several\r\nconstituencies a Ministerialist and a Labour man contested the two\r\nseats and received jointly the assistance of both parties.\r\n\r\nAs the Women's Franchise League had been dissolved upon the attainment\r\nof its purpose, the only organisation which interested itself,\r\nspecifically, in the female voters was the W.C.T.U., which, having\r\ndrawn up a scheme of reforms, suggested that it should be used as a\r\nbasis for ascertaining the views of candidates, but did not seek\r\ndirectly to influence the votes of its members though leaning,\r\nundoubtedly, to the side of the Government.  Its efforts to instruct\r\nwomen in the method of voting enabled returning officers to\r\ncongratulate them on their knowledge of the business.  From personal\r\nobservation I can bear witness to the extreme orderliness of the\r\nproceedings, both during and after the poll.\r\n\r\nThe elections resulted in a slight accession of strength to the ranks\r\nof the Ministerialists and Labour members.  As these are very Radical,\r\nthe majority of women, contrary to the expectations of many, had failed\r\nto display Conservative predilections.  It would seem, indeed, if we\r\ntake also {190} into consideration the result of two General Elections\r\nin New Zealand, that their so-called Conservatism takes the form, not\r\nof an aversion from advanced legislation, but of a disinclination to\r\nbring about a change of Ministry.  Under masculine influences, South\r\nAustralia had forty-two Ministries in forty years; women entered the\r\narena and a Ministry which had held office for three years was again\r\nreturned to power.  An allowance must, of course, be made for a feeling\r\nof gratitude to those through whom the privilege of the vote had been\r\nobtained.  Equally wrong was the anticipation that the women would be\r\nfound to be subject to clerical influences.  At the instigation of\r\nthose who were under this impression, the electors were invited, under\r\na direct reference, to say whether they desired the introduction of\r\nreligious instruction in State schools during school hours and the\r\npayment of a capitation grant to denominational schools for secular\r\nresults.  Both questions were answered emphatically in the negative,\r\nthe second by a majority of more than three votes to one.  The W.C.T.U.\r\nwas in favour of religious instruction, but strongly opposed to the\r\ncapitation grant.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion formed after the elections was that, in the vast\r\nmajority of cases, the women had voted in the same way as their\r\nmasculine relatives, and that domestic harmony had not been disturbed.\r\nIt was impossible to obtain definite data, as the Premier refused,\r\nrightly enough, to sanction {191} the issue of different voting papers\r\nfor the two sexes.  But, even if the female franchise merely increased\r\nthe number of votes and did not affect the result of the elections, it\r\ndoes not follow that it has been nugatory.\r\n\r\nMembers who have to consider the wishes of female as well as male\r\nconstituents will shape their actions accordingly.  The effects of this\r\ninfluence cannot yet be studied fully in South Australia, as they were\r\nnot manifested, to any great extent, in the first session of the new\r\nParliament.  A Licensed Victuallers' Act was passed, as had been\r\npromised by the Premier, which instituted local control over the issue\r\nof licenses, but provided, in accordance with statutory enactment, that\r\nthe refusal of licenses, or reduction in their number, should be\r\naccompanied by compensation to the parties directly interested.  As the\r\nProvince has a steadily growing industry in the cultivation of the\r\nvine, Prohibitionists will be met by a serious obstacle to their\r\ncrusade.  In pursuance of an _ad feminas captandas_ agitation for the\r\nprohibition of the employment of barmaids which had been carried on\r\nduring the elections, the Assembly inserted a clause in the Bill which\r\nprohibited their employment after a certain number of years, but\r\nsubmitted to its excision by the Council.  A Bill which would have\r\ngiven to widows a legal right to one-third of their deceased husband's\r\nproperty was discussed, but allowed to lapse.  The Franchise Act, I\r\nshould have stated, {192} allowed a female elector, upon the completion\r\nof certain formalities, to vote through the post if she would be absent\r\nfrom her home on the day of the election, a privilege already accorded\r\nto men, or if she were resident more than three miles from the nearest\r\npolling place, or, by reason of the state of her health, would probably\r\nbe unable to vote at the polling place on the day of the poll.  This\r\nprovision, which permitted open voting, was found to have led to\r\nabuses, and the Government passed an amending Act which withdrew all\r\nthe supplementary privileges except the last, and required absent\r\nvoters to fill in the paper at a postmaster's office and without\r\nsupervision.  As I was not in South Australia during the session, I am\r\nunable to give more than a brief summary of the proceedings which may\r\nbe connected, directly or indirectly, with the extension of the\r\nfranchise to women.\r\n\r\nBut when we turn to New Zealand, where a House elected under adult\r\nsuffrage has fulfilled its allotted term of three years, we may expect\r\nto find more definite results.  In that Province, as in South\r\nAustralia, women were enfranchised by a House which had received no\r\npopular mandate to that effect; in fact, the matter had scarcely been\r\ndiscussed in the constituencies, though attention had been drawn to it\r\nby the advocacy of several successive Premiers.  In 1892, however, a\r\nnew Electoral Bill, which conferred the franchise on all adult women,\r\nwas passed by the House of Representatives {193} and accepted by the\r\nCouncil subject to the insertion of a clause which absolved women in\r\nsome cases from attendance at the polling booth.  The Government\r\nrefused to accept the amendment, and the Bill lapsed for the session.\r\nIn the following year it was reintroduced in the original form, and was\r\npassed by both Houses, though only by a slender majority in the\r\nCouncil.  The Act contains the striking and, as far as I know, unique\r\nprovision that the names of voters who have not exercised their\r\nprivileges are to be erased from the rolls, though a claim for\r\nreinstatement may be made at the next periodical revision.\r\n\r\nThe elections, which took place at the end of 1893, aroused widespread\r\ninterest in the members of the fair sex, of whom nine out of every\r\neleven who were registered went to the poll and proved conclusively\r\nthat, though the desire for the vote might not have been general, women\r\nwould not refrain from its exercise.  With the help of their lords and\r\nmasters, they falsified the expectations of those who had anticipated a\r\nreaction in favour of Conservatism, by retaining in power, with an\r\nincreased majority, a Government which is, in some respects, even more\r\nRadical than that of South Australia.  So complete was the defeat of\r\nthe Opposition that it was reduced to a remnant of twenty members in a\r\nHouse of seventy-four.  Another important feature was the return of a\r\nbody of Prohibitionists who aimed at legislation which would enable the\r\nelectors {194} in a locality to close all the public-houses by a bare\r\nmajority.  As they sat on both sides of the House, they did not affect\r\nthe numerical strength of the two parties, but constituted a force\r\nwhich it was impossible for the Government to ignore.  But while the\r\nconsequent liquor legislation and the increased prominence of the\r\ntemperance movement are the principal effects of the extension of the\r\nfranchise to women, other measures of considerable importance are\r\nconnected with the new factor in the sphere of politics.\r\n\r\nSome of these would, doubtless, have been passed in any case.  The\r\nShops and Shop Assistants Act of 1894, for instance, which limits the\r\ntotal number of hours in a week, and the number of consecutive hours in\r\na day, during which women and persons under eighteen years of age may\r\nbe employed in a shop, and requires shopkeepers to provide sitting\r\naccommodation for their female employes, was passed by the preceding\r\nHouse of Representatives, and would have become law but for its\r\nrejection by the Council.  Similarly, the greater stringency in the\r\nlimitation of the hours of employment of women and young persons in\r\nfactories, the exclusion of young persons from certain dangerous\r\ntrades, and the prohibition of the employment of women within a month\r\nof their confinement, all of which were included in the Factories Act\r\nof the same year, might have been expected in the natural progress of\r\nindustrial legislation.  The appointment of women, {195} also, as\r\ninspectors of factories, gaols, and asylums is in accordance with the\r\nrecent practice of other countries.  The same may be said of the Infant\r\nLife Protection Act, which seeks to prevent baby-farming, and of Acts\r\ndealing with the adoption of children and with industrial schools,\r\nthough it is probable that their passage has been hastened by a\r\nknowledge of the approval of the female voters.  Their influence is\r\nalso seen in measures such as the raising of the age of consent to\r\nsixteen, in a country, be it remembered, in which girls come much more\r\nearly to maturity than in England, the permission accorded to women to\r\nbe enrolled as barristers and solicitors, and the simplification of the\r\nprocedure where a judicial separation is desired.  Parliament has\r\ndiscussed, but without legislative results, proposals that the sexes\r\nshould be placed on an equality as regards the grounds for a divorce,\r\nand that a divorce should be obtainable if either party become insane\r\nor be sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nBut we can trace the influence of women most directly in the desire of\r\nthe Premier, to which I have referred, to render them eligible for\r\nnomination to the Council, and in the attempts to put an end to the\r\nlegal sanction accorded by the State to betting, immorality, and drink.\r\nIn these matters members are face to face with the most pronounced\r\nopinions of their female constituents.\r\n\r\nThe prevention of gambling is sought through the {196} suppression of\r\nthe totalisator, which was legalised in 1889.  In the following years,\r\nit is admitted, the number of licenses issued was in excess of the\r\nrequirements of the population, and it was felt, even by the advocates\r\nof the machine, when a strongly supported effort was made in the House\r\nof Representatives to abolish it, that a concession was inevitable.  In\r\nits final form the measure reduced by one-third the number of licenses\r\nwhich might be issued thenceforward, and prohibited all persons from\r\nbetting with minors and from laying or taking odds dependent upon the\r\ndividend paid by the totalisator.\r\n\r\nThe female voters are even more anxious to secure the repeal of the\r\nC.D. Act, though it has for several years been a dead letter.  It only\r\napplies to districts which the Government declares to be subject to its\r\nprovisions, and no Ministry at the present time would venture to\r\nrecommend its application nor Municipal Council to proffer such a\r\nrequest.  But the women will not be satisfied until they have expunged\r\nfrom the Statute Book an Act which they declare to be a disgrace to New\r\nZealand.  Their purpose would have been effected by a short measure\r\nwhich was passed by the House of Representatives but rejected by the\r\nnominated Legislative Council, which is less amenable to public\r\nopinion.  They have also inspired the Government to greater stringency\r\nin the administration of the law against keepers of houses of ill-fame,\r\nwhich has led, {197} according to common report, to a large increase in\r\nthe prevalence of venereal diseases.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the position of affairs as it affects the\r\nProhibitionists in their crusade against public-houses, it is necessary\r\nto have some knowledge, in their broadest aspects, of the constitution\r\nand powers of the licensing authority and of the gradual extension of\r\npopular control.  Under an Act of 1881 the regulation of the traffic\r\nwas placed in the hands of elective Licensing Committees, and the first\r\nstep in the direction of popular control was taken by the provision\r\nthat additional licenses, except in special cases, should not be\r\ngranted until they had been demanded by a poll of the ratepayers.\r\nObjections to the granting or renewal of licenses might be made by\r\nprivate individuals, the police and corporate bodies, and should\r\nspecify, as the ground of objection, that the proposed licensee was an\r\nundesirable person, that the premises were unsuitable, or that \"the\r\nlicensing thereof is not required in the neighbourhood.\"  The words\r\nthat I have quoted were seized upon by the Prohibitionists, who had\r\ngathered strength during the following years as a justification for the\r\nrefusal of all licenses if they could capture the Licensing Committee.\r\nIn Sydenham, a suburb of Christchurch, they were at length successful,\r\nand were confronted with the bitter antagonism of the brewers.  After\r\nseveral years of litigation they were defeated conclusively, and were\r\nthrown back upon an agitation for the amendment of the law.\r\n\r\n{198}\r\n\r\nThe next important measure, that of 1893, was passed by representatives\r\nelected under manhood suffrage, who knew that when they sought a\r\nrenewal of confidence they would be called upon to justify their\r\nactions, not only in the eyes of Prohibitionists, but in those of the\r\nnewly enfranchised female electors.  We shall therefore not be\r\nsurprised to find that the Act introduced a great extension of the\r\nprinciple of popular control.  It placed both the election of the\r\nLicensing Committees and the Local Option polls on the basis of adult\r\nsuffrage and enlarged the scope of the latter.  Previously, as we have\r\nseen, the electors were only allowed to decide as to the advisability\r\nof additional licenses.  Herein their power was curtailed, as such\r\npolls were not to be held unless a census had shown that the population\r\nof a district had increased by 25 per cent. in the quinquennial period.\r\nThis was a concession to Prohibitionists who would welcome a change\r\nwhich rendered the increase of licenses more difficult.  But the\r\nprincipal innovation was the control given to the electorate over the\r\nrenewal of all publicans' accommodation or bottle licenses.  Triennial\r\npolls were to be held, at which they were to be invited to say whether\r\nthey desired the continuation, reduction, or abolition of licenses,\r\nsubject to the proviso that prohibition would not be deemed to be\r\ncarried except by a three-fifths majority of the votes, and that the\r\npoll would be void unless it had been attended by a majority of the\r\nregistered electors.  {199} Should prohibition not be carried, the\r\nvotes in its favour were to be added to those cast for reduction, and,\r\nin the event of reduction, the Licensing Committee were to refuse to\r\nrenew the licences of not more than one in four of the publicans in the\r\ndistrict, commencing with those whose licenses had been endorsed, and\r\nproceeding with those who offered little or no accommodation to\r\ntravellers.  No provision was made for compensation to persons who,\r\nthrough no fault of their own, might be dispossessed of their licenses.\r\nAs the Act declared that the poll should be regarded as void unless\r\none-half of the electors recorded their votes, it was to the obvious\r\ninterest of anti-prohibitionists to abstain from attendance at the\r\nbooths, and the figures consequently afford no index of the full\r\nstrength of the opposing parties.  The Prohibitionists, however, had\r\nlittle cause to be dissatisfied with the results of their first appeal\r\nto the electorate, which included women as well as men: prohibition was\r\ncarried in one case, reduction in fourteen, while in the remainder the\r\npoll was either void or the votes were cast in favour of existing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe amending Act of 1895 has made no substantial alterations in the law\r\nin spite of the persistent agitation of Prohibitionists in favour of\r\nprohibition on the vote of a bare majority.  It was decreed that\r\nlicensing polls should be held concurrently with General Elections,\r\nthat voters should {200} be allowed to vote both for prohibition and\r\nreduction, though the two votes could, naturally, no longer be combined\r\nin favour of the latter, that the vote should affect all forms of\r\nlicenses, and, in view of the district in which prohibition had been\r\ncarried, that, in such cases, the issue should be between the continued\r\nrefusal of licenses and their restoration to the former number.  Under\r\nthe present law, it will be noted, should successive reductions lead to\r\nthe cancellation of all licenses, a vote of the electors can never\r\nrestore more licenses than existed at the time when the last was doomed\r\nto extinction.\r\n\r\nThe second poll was taken at the end of 1896 and resulted in the\r\nfailure to carry either prohibition or reduction in any district.  The\r\nfigures were as follows: continuation, 139,249; reduction, 94,226;\r\nprohibition, 98,103.  Though the Prohibitionists had been enabled to\r\nincrease their vote by nearly 50,000 and had therein sufficient grounds\r\nfor the hope of ultimate success, it is probable that they would have\r\nbeen more successful but for the intemperance of their leaders, who aim\r\nat prohibition alone and care neither for the regulation of the traffic\r\nnor for reduction.  They were also handicapped by the frantic efforts\r\nof the brewers, who spent their ample funds freely and were able to\r\ncommand the votes of many who were interested, either directly or\r\nindirectly, in the trade; and by an alliance between the brewers and\r\nmany of the Ministerialists.  While the General {201} Election and the\r\nLocal Option poll constituted distinct issues, and there was no reason\r\nwhy a supporter of the Government should feel bound to vote for the\r\ncontinuation of licenses, it is an undoubted fact that a large number\r\nof the women of the working classes, who might have been expected to be\r\nopposed to the public-houses, voted, on that occasion, in favour of\r\ntheir retention.  At Wellington, where, as at Adelaide, I was struck by\r\nthe prevailing orderliness, the only women whom I noted as taking an\r\nactive part in the proceedings were canvassing in favour of the brewers.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it seems strange that the brewers should have worked\r\nwith the party which had passed the most stringent liquor legislation\r\non the Statute Book, but it must be remembered that this question had\r\nneither been debated nor divided the House on the ordinary lines of\r\ncleavage.  The brewers, many persons maintain, know that they have the\r\nsympathy of the Government which, according to this hypothesis, has\r\ndone as little as possible to meet the wishes of the Prohibitionists,\r\nand that only under virtual compulsion, and, in its measure of 1896,\r\nintroduced a Bill which would certainly be rejected by the Council and\r\nwas calculated to cast ridicule upon the agitation of the\r\nProhibitionists.  It was provided therein that a fourth issue should be\r\nadded at the Local Option polls, that of national prohibition, and\r\nthat, if it were carried by a three-fifths majority of the votes {202}\r\nrecorded in all the districts, it should be unlawful, subject to the\r\nexception mentioned hereafter, to import into the Province any liquor\r\nfor any purpose or to distil it in the Province or to manufacture it\r\nfor sale or barter.  No person selling any spirituous or distilled\r\nperfume, nor any apothecary, chemist, or druggist administering or\r\nselling any spirituous, distilled, or fermented liquor for medicinal\r\nuse, should do so otherwise than in such combination as rendered it\r\nunfit for use as a beverage.  The Governor might declare, by notice in\r\n_The Gazette_, by what combination of ingredients the articles would be\r\nrendered sufficiently unpalatable.  Persons requiring liquor for\r\nmedicinal use or use in the arts and manufacturers were to make\r\napplications to Her Majesty's Customs and if their _bona fides_ were\r\nproved, might receive it, for ready money, \"in such closed and sealed\r\nbottles or other receptacle as that the liquor therein cannot be poured\r\nout without such seal being first broken,\" and attached \"with a\r\nGovernment label declaring the kind, quantity, quality, and price of\r\nthe liquor, as these may be determined by the Governor.\"  In this\r\nmeasure the Government seem to have attempted to run with the hare and\r\nhunt with the hounds.  The brewers would laugh in their sleeves and the\r\nProhibitionists would welcome a measure which instituted machinery for\r\nthe attainment of national prohibition.  If the assumption be correct,\r\nthe latter are credited with a lamentable lack of any sense of humour;\r\nfrom all {203} appearances they are not prepared to allow themselves to\r\nbe hoodwinked.\r\n\r\nMany of the representatives seem to have had an equally low opinion of\r\nthe average intelligence of female electors, as they sought to capture\r\nthe votes of domestic servants by a Bill which was rejected by the\r\nCouncil, in which a weekly half-holiday was decreed to them except in\r\ncases of sickness or death in the family, or where an annual holiday of\r\nnot less than fourteen days had been substituted by mutual agreement\r\nbetween employers and their servants.  How the period of rest was to be\r\nenforced was, perhaps wisely, not laid down, as domestics would, in few\r\ncases, be prepared to give information against their employers.  Those\r\namong the latter, however, who took the matter seriously would,\r\npresumably, guard themselves against judiciary proceedings by\r\ncompelling their servants to be out of the house on the holiday between\r\nthree o'clock and half-past nine, whatever might be the state of the\r\nweather.  Again, the undoubted evil, that young girls, by the culpable\r\nweakness of their parents, are allowed to parade the streets at night,\r\nwas to be cured, according to the Government, by the so-called Juvenile\r\nDepravity Suppression Bill, which failed to meet with acceptance by the\r\nusually docile House of Representatives.  Its danger and absurdity can\r\nbe gathered, without further comment, from the quotation of one of the\r\nclauses: \"Whenever any constable finds any girl\" (who is apparently not\r\nover the age of sixteen years) {204} \"loitering in the streets or in\r\nout-of-the-way places after the hour of ten of the clock at night, and\r\nhe has reason to believe that she is there for improper purposes, the\r\nfollowing provisions shall apply:--\r\n\r\n\"1. He shall forthwith take her to the nearest beat of another\r\nconstable, or, failing him, to the nearest justice or clergyman, or,\r\nfailing him, to the nearest house of some married person of good\r\nrepute, in whose presence the girl shall be questioned as to her name,\r\nher abode, her parents or guardians, and her reason for being from home\r\nand loitering as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"2. The constable shall then take, or shall cause her to be taken, to\r\nher home, where she shall be handed over to the person in charge of the\r\nhouse, and the constable shall forthwith on his return from duty make\r\nreport of the facts to the officer in charge of the station.\"\r\n\r\nShould the offence be repeated and the girl's reply be deemed by the\r\nofficer in charge of a police station to be unsatisfactory, she may be\r\nbrought before a magistrate and be committed to a reformatory or an\r\nindustrial school.  Some justification, I must add, for the seemingly\r\ndepreciatory opinion of the members was afforded by the proceedings at\r\nthe convention of the National Council of Women held at Christchurch\r\nearly in 1896.  This Association, which claims to be non-political and\r\nto focus the views of the women of New Zealand, passed {205}\r\nresolutions in favour of the nationalisation of the land, a compulsory\r\neight hours' day, and the enactment of a minimum rate of wages; but the\r\nclimax was reached when it was resolved that \"in all cases where a\r\nwoman elects to superintend her own household and to be the mother of\r\nchildren, there shall be a law attaching a certain just share of her\r\nhusband's earnings or income for her separate use, payable if she so\r\ndesires it into her separate account.\"  The first portion of this\r\nsentence is mysterious, and seems to be based on the assumption that\r\nthe husband has nothing to say in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary legislative activity which I have summarised need\r\narouse no astonishment, as it is in consonance with the usual practice\r\nof the Parliament of New Zealand.  Between the years 1876 and 1894, it\r\nhas been computed, 2,972 measures were passed, and of these no less\r\nthan 1,602 have already been repealed.\r\n\r\nSo much for the past: we must now consider briefly the present position\r\nof affairs and the further effects which may be anticipated from female\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nIt is the general impression that while a large majority of the women\r\nvoted in 1893 as their husbands and brothers advised them, yet they\r\nwere induced, in many instances, by their leagues, which had been\r\nstarted on independent lines, to support candidates on moral rather\r\nthan political considerations.  In the following year these leagues,\r\n{206} with the exception of those which placed liquor questions before\r\nall others, were captured by one of the political parties, most of them\r\nby the Ministerialists.  An amusing incident occurred in this\r\nconnection at Dunedin.  Shortly before the last elections it was\r\ndecided, at a thinly-attended meeting of the Women's Franchise League,\r\nto support the three Ministerial candidates, although one of them was\r\nan anti-prohibitionist.  Thereupon many of the members protested\r\nagainst the party character given to the association, and called a\r\nmeeting, the proceedings at which were thus described by the local\r\nnewspaper:--\r\n\r\n\"The meeting which was held yesterday afternoon in connection with the\r\nWomen's Franchise League was, in some respects, the most unique\r\ngathering ever held in the city.  There were nearly 200 women present,\r\nand they were divided into two parties--the followers of Mrs. Hatton\r\nand the supporters of Mrs. Don and Mrs. Hislop.  At the close of the\r\nopening remarks of the Chairman (the Rev. Mr. Saunders), Mr. Hatton\r\nmounted the platform, and declining to take his seat, the Chairman\r\nthreatened to send for a policeman.  Then occurred a scene and uproar,\r\nof which it is impossible to give any conception.  The noise was\r\ndeafening; and attracted to the spot passers-by in the street.  Half a\r\ndozen persons occupied the stage, and while some persons were\r\naddressing the meeting, others were engaged in heated argument.  Women\r\n{207} stamped on the floor with their feet and parasols, others were\r\nspeaking at the highest pitch of their voices; there were hissing and\r\nhooting, and other unwomanly demonstrations.  Eventually a portion of\r\nMrs. Hislop's supporters withdrew to a side room, and the Chairman,\r\nhaving dissolved the meeting, vacated the chair.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, that, with the exception of ardent Prohihitionists,\r\nwomen are subordinating their special interests to their increasing\r\nattachment to one or other of the parties; but it does not follow that\r\nthey will cease to exercise a direct influence upon legislation.  It is\r\nnot easy to learn to what extent their views have been modified during\r\nthe last few years.  The proceedings of the National Council of Women\r\ncannot be taken seriously, and the practical aspirations of the sex\r\nmust be sought rather in the points emphasised by the local leagues.\r\nThe files of the newspapers, unfortunately, afford little information,\r\nas it was the practise of candidates to speak upon general topics at\r\ntheir public meetings, and to take part in informal and unreported\r\ndiscussions with the members of the various women's leagues.  On these\r\noccasions, I understand, and I must again except the Prohibitionists,\r\nthe women made their views known, but did not seek to exact pledges as\r\na condition of support.  It is believed that they took less interest in\r\nthe second elections, but statistics are not yet available for a\r\ncomparison {208} of the numbers that went to the poll on the two\r\noccasions.  Of 9,332 women who were registered for the City of\r\nAuckland, 6,304 recorded their votes, but I am unable to say whether\r\nthe proportion of about seven in ten holds good for the Province.\r\n\r\nBut, while it is necessary to consider the view of local leagues in\r\norder to form general conclusions as to the trend of female thought, it\r\nis found that, in the absence of one predominating centre, different\r\nissues obtain prominence in different places, and that the vote lacks\r\nthe force which would be given to it by concentration.  A general\r\nsimilarity of aims, however, enables an estimate to be formed of the\r\nquestions which the women will press upon the attention of Parliament\r\nin the immediate future.  The repeal of the C.D. and Totalisator Acts,\r\namendments of the marriage laws, and greater protection of women and\r\nchildren against the cruelty of husbands and fathers, are subjects\r\nwhich are certain again to provoke discussion.  Parliament will also be\r\nasked again to admit women within its precincts, as they are no longer\r\nsatisfied with the possession of the franchise; but the agitation will,\r\nI think, at present be unsuccessful, partly because, in the only\r\ninstance in which a woman has held a public position, the experiment is\r\nregarded as having been a failure.  Some three years ago Mrs. Yates was\r\nelected to be Mayor of Onehunga, {209} and was unable to fill the\r\nposition satisfactorily.  She was a woman of considerable ability, but\r\nof a hasty temper, and came into constant conflict with the\r\nCouncillors.  Very possibly they did not give her a fair chance; but\r\nthe fact remains that the proceedings excited much ridicule, in the\r\npress and elsewhere, and retarded the movement in favour of rendering\r\nwomen eligible for seats in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibitionists do not count upon much legislative assistance\r\nduring the next three years, as the number of members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives who are in favour of prohibition upon the vote of a\r\nbare majority was reduced by the last election.  They believe that if\r\nthe \"National Option\" Bill be re-introduced, the Council may seize upon\r\nthat fact as a ground for again rejecting it.  In the meanwhile, they\r\nwill concentrate their efforts upon the education of the electorate,\r\nand have, as I have shown, no reason to be discouraged by the results\r\nof the second local option poll.\r\n\r\n\"Equal wages for equal work\" is a new cry of the female voters.  They\r\nbelieve that if the Government were to introduce the principle of equal\r\nwages for similar work as between the men and women in the Civil\r\nService, private employers would gradually follow the example.  This\r\nproposal has the support both of those who desire to raise the wages of\r\nwomen and of those who think that they would no longer be {210} able to\r\ncompete with men in the search for employment.  It might have been\r\nexpected that the habit which women have now acquired of meeting\r\ntogether for the discussion of a common policy would have inclined them\r\nto the formation of Trades Unions; but it is too early to look for\r\nindirect results from female suffrage, which has hitherto had no\r\nappreciable effect upon the rate of wages of women.  Nor has it\r\nmodified the domestic instincts of the vast majority of the sex.\r\n\r\nLastly, the women of the working classes, almost without exception, are\r\nin favour of pensions to the aged and needy, and regard objections\r\nbased on the deterrence of thrift or the difficulty of raising the\r\nnecessary funds as factitious and disingenuous.  Herein, as in some of\r\nthe other matters to which I have referred, we see the principal danger\r\nof female suffrage in New Zealand, the tendency of the women to\r\nsubordinate reason to sentiment.  They note the prevalence of an evil,\r\nand believe that if the State decrees its cessation it will promptly\r\ncease to exist.  But we must cherish the hope, though the justification\r\nfor it is not yet manifest, that as the women become accustomed to the\r\nexercise of their power, they will no longer take a purely emotional\r\nview of the problems which engage their attention.  At the same time,\r\nas we have seen, they have promoted several unobtrusive but eminently\r\nuseful reforms which would have had less chance of acceptance in a\r\nHouse elected {211} by men.  It is in this direction, and not in\r\nattempts to make people virtuous or sober by Act of Parliament, that we\r\nmay anticipate the best results from the enfranchisement of the women\r\nof New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Otago Daily Times_, November 2, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{212}\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n_THE EVOLUTION OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT_\r\n\r\nThe five self-governing Provinces of the mainland of Australia have\r\nbeen evolved from the Crown Colonies of New South Wales, South\r\nAustralia, and Western Australia by the successive detachment of\r\nVictoria and Queensland from the former and the gradual growth of the\r\nsystem of responsible government, and are separated by lines of\r\ndemarcation which, except where the Murray or one of its tributaries\r\nforms the boundary, are purely arbitrary and have not been drawn in\r\naccordance with any distinctive geographical features.  In the exercise\r\nof fiscal autonomy as regards their reciprocal relations, they have\r\nadopted protective tariffs which have not only impeded the interchange\r\nof commodities, but in some cases diverted trade from its natural\r\ncourse.  New South Wales, indeed, after a period of protection, has\r\nreverted to the policy of free trade, while the tariffs of Queensland\r\nand Western Australia are directed mainly to the {213} acquisition of\r\nrevenue; but they are actually protective, as are, avowedly and to a\r\nhigh degree, those of Victoria and South Australia.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, and as the result of insufficient intercourse,\r\nantagonistic interests have been created and jealousies aroused which\r\nare a source of anxiety to those who consider the future of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe dangers which would be likely to arise from the independent\r\ndevelopment of the Provinces were recognised at an early date.  At the\r\ntime of the suggested separation of the district of Port Phillip from\r\nNew South Wales and of the discussion of the new constitutions which\r\nwere about to be granted, it was proposed by the Imperial Authorities\r\nthat the government should be in the hands of a General Assembly and\r\nlocal Provincial Councils, but it was objected by the colonists that,\r\nin the absence of regular means of communication, any scheme which\r\nincluded the creation of a central legislature and executive would be\r\nfound to be impracticable.  In deference to their views the idea was\r\nallowed to drop, and no attempt was made to secure unity of action\r\nbetween the Provinces, except that, in 1850, the Governor of New South\r\nWales received a commission as Governor-General of Australia and\r\nGovernor of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the administrators\r\nof which obtained the rank of Lieutenant-Governor.  They were to be\r\nsuperseded in their authority by the former when he was in {214} their\r\nterritories, but were instructed to correspond directly with the\r\nColonial Office.  It is not clear to what extent the Governor-General\r\nwas expected to direct the administration of the other Provinces.  Some\r\nwriters maintain that his pre-eminence was purely titular and intended\r\nas a compliment to the Mother Colony.  In any case, when, a few years\r\nlater, responsible government was established and the Governors\r\ngradually became little more than figure-heads of the Executive, the\r\nmatter ceased to be of any importance.\r\n\r\nThe next phase in the movement originated in Victoria upon the\r\ninitiative of Mr. (now Sir Charles) Gavan Duffy, who, in 1857, induced\r\nthe Legislative Assembly to appoint a committee to consider the\r\nadvisability of federal union.  Upon their recommendation that an\r\ninter-provincial conference should be held, communications were\r\naddressed to New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania, which,\r\nthough separated from the mainland of Australia, has always identified\r\nitself closely with Australian affairs.  The proposal was in each case\r\nfavourably received, as also, a little later, by Queensland, which had\r\nbeen erected into a separate Province in 1859; and Tasmania actually\r\nappointed its delegates.  But there the matter was allowed to rest;\r\nand, although occasional conferences were held at which a uniform\r\ntariff, the immigration of the Chinese, and other subjects were\r\ndiscussed, no practical steps were taken until 1883, when external\r\nquestions impressed {215} Australian statesmen with the necessity for\r\nthe creation of some body which would voice the opinions of Australia.\r\nGermany was reputed to have designs upon New Guinea, France upon the\r\nNew Hebrides; while the latter country also gave offence by the penal\r\nsettlement in New Caledonia.  In the spring of that year Sir T.\r\nM'Ilwraith, the Premier of Queensland, which from its position has the\r\ngreatest interest in New Guinea, had hoisted the British flag on the\r\nIsland and taken formal possession of that part of it which was not\r\nunder the control of the Dutch; but his action had been disavowed by\r\nthe Imperial Government.  A convention, attended by representatives\r\nfrom the five Australian Provinces, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Fiji,\r\nwas accordingly held at Sydney, at which a decision was arrived at as\r\nto the main principles which were embodied in the Federal Council Act\r\nof 1885, the first legislative recognition of the Unity of Australia.\r\nUnder this Act it was provided that a Federal Council, containing two\r\nrepresentatives from a self-governing Province and one from a Crown\r\nColony, should come into existence as soon as four of the Australasian\r\nProvinces had expressed their willingness to join it, and should\r\nthenceforward hold biennial sessions.  The motive which had called the\r\nCouncil into existence was shown clearly in the principal power\r\ndelegated to it, that of legislating, subject to Imperial approval, in\r\nregard to the relations of Australasia with the Islands of the {216}\r\nPacific.  It was also authorised to deal, among other subjects, with\r\nthe fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits and\r\ncertain aspects of civil and criminal jurisdiction, upon which it could\r\npass enactments which would bind the Provinces represented upon it; and\r\nwith questions such as general defences, quarantine, copyright,\r\nuniformity of weights and measures, and others which might be referred\r\nto it by the Legislatures of two or more Provinces, and any other\r\nmatters of general Australasian interest on which the Legislatures can\r\nlegislate within their own limits, but as to which it is deemed\r\ndesirable that there should be a law of general application.  Such\r\nlegislation, however, was to take effect only in the Provinces that\r\nrequested the Council to act, and in any others that might subsequently\r\nadopt it.  It will thus be seen that the measure is of a purely\r\npermissive character, as each Province decides for itself whether it\r\nwill be represented on the Council.  New South Wales, mainly under the\r\ninfluence of the late Sir Henry Parkes, and New Zealand have never\r\ntaken part in the deliberations, and South Australia has only been\r\nrepresented on a single occasion.  The abstention of New Zealand is of\r\nsmaller importance, from her geographical position and her intention\r\nnot to identify herself at present with any scheme of Australian\r\nfederation; but the hostility of New South Wales and the apathy of\r\nSouth Australia have placed great obstacles in the way of Queensland,\r\n{217} Victoria, Western Australia, and Tasmania, which, and especially\r\nVictoria, have attempted to turn the Council to the best account.\r\nOther causes have combined to minimise its utility; it has neither an\r\nExecutive to carry out, nor a judiciary to enforce its decisions; it\r\nhas no control over public funds; and, as has recently been pointed\r\nout, \"it transacts its business without a Ministry or a department,\r\nwithout a leader or an Opposition, without a party or a programme;\r\nthere is no necessary continuity of representation, or similarity in\r\nthe mode of appointment of representatives, or fixed area within which\r\nits legislation has force; it is vagrant in domicile and without a roof\r\nto shelter it, without a foot of territory to rest upon, without a ship\r\nor a soldier to protect it, without a single man in its service, or a\r\nshilling of its own to pay one.\"[1]  But, in spite of these drawbacks,\r\nthe Council has done practical work: it has paved the way for a system\r\nof national defence by the establishment of federal garrisons at King\r\nGeorge's Sound and Thursday Island; it has regulated the pearl-shell\r\nand beche-de-mer fisheries on the coasts of Queensland and Western\r\nAustralia, and it has interested itself actively in the promotion of\r\nthe proposed Pacific cable.  More would have been done, particularly in\r\nthe consideration of the matters referred to it by Provincial\r\nLegislatures, had {218} it not been hoped that by the postponement of\r\naction the Council would be enabled, through the adhesion of South\r\nAustralia and New South Wales, to legislate for the whole of Australia.\r\nSeveral of the Provinces, notably Western Australia and Queensland,\r\nwhich have shown little eagerness for the immediate realisation of a\r\ncloser union, believed that the Council would, by a gradual process of\r\ndevelopment, be transformed into a Federal Parliament, and were\r\nprepared to allow events to take their natural course; but in other\r\nquarters a strong feeling arose, which was strengthened by the report\r\nof Imperial officers on the condition of the Provincial Defences, that\r\nthe time had arrived when an attempt should be made to draft a Federal\r\nConstitution Bill which should be submitted to the various Provinces,\r\nand, if approved by them, to the Imperial Authorities.  As the result\r\nof correspondence between the Premiers, delegates from the whole of\r\nAustralasia, with the exception of Fiji, met at Melbourne in 1890, and\r\npassed resolutions which led to the convocation at Sydney in the\r\nfollowing year of a constituent convention, which was attended by\r\nParliamentary representatives from the seven Provinces.  The convention\r\nsat for several weeks, under the presidency of Sir Henry Parkes, and\r\ndrew up a Bill \"to constitute the commonwealth of Australia,\" which\r\nformed the basis of the discussions at the recent Federal Convention.\r\n\r\n{219}\r\n\r\nThe legislative powers of the Commonwealth are, under the provisions of\r\nthe Bill, vested in a Governor-General, appointed by the Queen, a\r\nSenate, and a House of Representatives.  The laws passed by the\r\nParliament are to be presented to the Governor-General, who may assent\r\nto them in the Queen's name, reserve them for the signification of her\r\npleasure, withhold his assent, or return them to the Parliament with\r\nany amendments that he may recommend.  Laws assented to by the\r\nGovernor-General may be disallowed within two years by the Queen in\r\nCouncil, and laws that have been reserved shall not come into force\r\nunless within the same period they have received the assent of the\r\nQueen in Council.  The Members of the Convention did not deem it\r\nnecessary that any class of Bills should be reserved, but understood\r\nthat, as they proposed that the Commonwealth should be able to\r\nlegislate on several matters affecting the relations of Australia with\r\nforeign nations, the Constitution would not be acceptable to the\r\nImperial Authorities unless a considerable power of intervention were\r\nreserved to them.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is to be composed of eight members for each Province, which\r\nis henceforth to be called a State, of whom one-half retire\r\ntriennially, directly chosen by the Houses of Parliament of the several\r\nStates for a period of six years.  Senators are subject to no property\r\nqualification, but must be of {220} the age of thirty years, have\r\nresided for five years within the limits of the Commonwealth, be\r\nentitled to vote for a member of the House of Representatives, and if\r\nnot British subjects by birth, have been naturalised for at least five\r\nyears before the time of their election.  Bankrupts, criminals, and\r\nGovernment contractors are specially disqualified.  Similar provisions\r\nand disqualifications apply to members of the House of Representatives,\r\nexcept that the minimum age is reduced to twenty-one years, and that\r\nthe periods of residence and naturalisation are reduced from five years\r\nto three.  They are to be chosen, in constituencies of thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants, by electors whose qualification shall be that prescribed\r\nby each State as the qualification for electors of its more numerous\r\nHouse of Parliament.  The members of both Houses are to be paid at the\r\nrate of L500 a year, and are precluded from sitting in a State\r\nParliament.  The Parliament of the Commonwealth is to have authority to\r\ndeal with \"external affairs and treaties,\" to take over the powers of\r\nthe Federal Council, which will cease to exist from the date of its\r\nestablishment, and to have the exclusive right to legislate in regard\r\nto the affairs of the people of any race, not being Australian\r\naboriginals or Maoris of New Zealand, with respect to whom it is deemed\r\ndesirable to make laws not applicable to the general community; the\r\nseat of the Federal Government and any places required {221} for\r\nFederal purposes; and the provisional administration of any territory\r\nsurrendered by any State, and accepted by the Commonwealth, or any\r\nterritory in the Pacific placed by the Queen under the authority of and\r\naccepted by the Commonwealth.  The framers of the Constitution\r\ndoubtless had in view the Northern Territory, which, as it forms a\r\nheavy burden upon its resources, South Australia might be glad to hand\r\nover to the Federation.  The Federal Parliament is also to deal\r\nexclusively with the postal and telegraphic services, military and\r\nnaval defences and munitions of war, ocean beacons and lighthouses,\r\nquarantine, and, as soon as a uniform tariff has been imposed, with\r\nforeign and internal trade, bounties and duties of customs and excise.\r\nIn the meanwhile, the duties are to be collected by Federal officials,\r\nbut will be those that are, or may be, imposed by the Parliaments of\r\nthe several States.  Upon the enactment of a uniform Federal tariff,\r\nall such State laws will thereby be repealed and \"trade and intercourse\r\nthroughout the Commonwealth, whether by means of internal carriage or\r\nocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.\"  The expenditure of the\r\nCommonwealth is to be charged to the several States in proportion to\r\nthe numbers of their people, and any surplus of revenue over\r\nexpenditure is to be returned to them in proportion to the amount of\r\nrevenue raised therein respectively, subject to certain reservations\r\nand to the right of the Federal Parliament, after {222} the imposition\r\nof a uniform tariff, to prescribe the method of its disposal.  The\r\nFederal revenue is to consist of customs and excise duties and of\r\nmoneys raised by any other mode or system of taxation, but so that all\r\nsuch taxation shall be uniform through the Commonwealth.  The Federal\r\nParliament may also, \"with the consent of the Parliaments of all the\r\nStates, make laws for taking over and consolidating the whole or any\r\npart of the public debt of any State or States; but so that a State\r\nshall be liable to indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the amount\r\nof a debt taken over, and that the amount of interest payable in\r\nrespect of a debt shall be deducted and retained from time to time from\r\nthe share of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth which would be\r\notherwise payable to the State.\"[2]  Certain other legislative powers\r\nare vested in the Federal Parliament, which may concurrently be\r\nexercised by the several States, and in such cases Federal shall\r\nsupersede State legislation.  All subjects not exclusively vested in\r\nthe Parliament of the Commonwealth, or withdrawn from the Parliaments\r\nof the several States, are reserved to, and shall remain vested in, the\r\nState Parliaments.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Senate in regard to Money Bills formed the subject\r\nof much discussion, and was decided by a compromise which, it was\r\nhoped, would satisfy both those who desired to secure the {223}\r\nfinancial supremacy of the House of Representatives and the inhabitants\r\nof the smaller States, who would naturally struggle for the rights of\r\nthe Senate in which they would be on a footing of equality with their\r\nmore powerful neighbours.  The views of the former were met by the\r\nprovisions that \"laws appropriating any part of the public revenue, or\r\nimposing any tax or impost, shall originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives,\" and that \"the Senate shall have equal power with the\r\nHouse of Representatives in respect to all proposed laws, except laws\r\nimposing taxation and laws appropriating the necessary supplies for the\r\nordinary annual services of the Government, which the Senate may affirm\r\nor reject, but may not amend.  But the Senate may not amend any\r\nproposed law in such a manner as to increase any proposed charge or\r\nburden on the people.\"  The interests of the latter were safeguarded by\r\nthe four succeeding sub-sections:\r\n\r\n\"Laws imposing taxation shall deal with the imposition of taxation only.\r\n\r\n\"Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs on\r\nimports, shall deal with one subject of taxation only.\r\n\r\n\"The expenditure for services other than the ordinary annual services\r\nof the Government shall not be authorised by the same law as that which\r\nappropriates the supplies for such ordinary annual services, but shall\r\nbe authorised by a separate law or laws.\r\n\r\n{224}\r\n\r\n\"In the case of a proposed law which the Senate may not amend, the\r\nSenate may at any stage return it to the House of Representatives with\r\na message requesting the omission or amendment of any items or\r\nprovisions therein.  And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks\r\nfit, make such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or without\r\nmodifications.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe executive authority of the Commonwealth is to be exercised by the\r\nGovernor-General as the Queen's representative, with the aid and advice\r\nof a Federal Executive Council.  Considerable discussion took place at\r\nthe Convention as to the relations which should exist between the\r\nFederal Executive and Legislature, some of the Representatives being in\r\nfavour of the British system, others of the direct popular election of\r\nthe head of the Government.  It was finally agreed that the members of\r\nthe Council should be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General,\r\nshould hold office, during his pleasure, and should be capable of being\r\nchosen and of sitting in either House of Parliament.  They are to\r\nexecute the provisions of the Constitution and the laws of the\r\nCommonwealth; to assume at once control of the departments of customs\r\nand excise, posts and telegraphs, military and naval defence, ocean\r\nlights and quarantine; and, until other provision is made by\r\nParliament, to appoint and remove all other officers of the Government.\r\n\r\n{225}\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth may establish a Supreme Court of\r\nAustralia, consisting of a Chief Justice and not less than four other\r\nJustices, who shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council,\r\nand shall be irremovable except upon an address from both Houses of\r\nParliament.  The Supreme Court shall be a final Court of Appeal from\r\nany other Federal Court, which may be established by Parliament, and\r\nfrom the highest Court of final resort in any State; and may be\r\ninvested by Parliament with final and conclusive jurisdiction in all\r\ncases upon which an appeal has hitherto been allowed to the Queen in\r\nCouncil, subject to the right of the Queen to grant an appeal to\r\nherself in Council against the judgment of the Supreme Court in any\r\ncase which concerns the public interests of the Commonwealth, or of any\r\nState, or of any other part of the British Empire.  The Parliament may\r\nalso confer upon the Federal Courts, other than the Supreme Court,\r\njurisdiction to deal, either exclusively or concurrently with the\r\nCourts of the States, with cases arising under the Constitution or\r\nunder any law made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth or affecting\r\nthe Representatives of Foreign Powers, and with certain other matters\r\nincluding cases in which the Commonwealth is a party, or in which a\r\nWrit of Mandamus or Prohibition is sought against an officer of the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\n\r\nAs the powers of the State are to be substantially those which they\r\npossess at present with the {226} exception of such as are transferred\r\nto the Federal Legislature and Executive, it is only necessary to add\r\nthat the Governors of the States are to be appointed in the manner\r\nwhich their Parliament may prescribe, but are to correspond with the\r\nImperial Authorities through the Governor-General: that States are not\r\nto be subdivided nor deprived of any of their territories without the\r\nconsent of their Parliaments; and that they are forbidden explicitly to\r\nraise or maintain any military or naval force, to coin money, or make\r\nanything but gold and silver legal tender in payment of debts, to make\r\nany law prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, or to make or\r\nenforce any law abridging any privilege or immunity of citizens of\r\nother States of the Commonwealth, or to deny to any person within their\r\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is provided that any of the existing Provinces that have\r\nnot adopted the Constitution may, upon doing so, be admitted to the\r\nCommonwealth, and that any law for the alteration of the Constitution\r\nis not to be submitted to the Governor-General for the Royal Assent\r\nuntil it has been passed by an absolute majority of both Houses of\r\nParliament, and has been approved by conventions of a majority of the\r\nStates representing a majority of the people of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution Bill had been drafted, the next step should have\r\nbeen its reference to the Parliaments of the Constituent Provinces; but\r\nit was {227} not even introduced in New South Wales, Queensland,\r\nWestern Australia, or New Zealand.  In Victoria it was passed by the\r\nAssembly and forwarded to the Council, which passed it subject to\r\ncertain amendments which were never considered by the Assembly; in\r\nSouth Australia it was introduced in the Assembly, and was dropped; in\r\nTasmania it passed the Assembly and was dropped at an early stage in\r\nthe Council.  This procession of failures caused the advocates of\r\nFederation to realise that there must be something faulty in the method\r\nof procedure, and to ask themselves whether it was reasonable to expect\r\nthat fourteen independent Chambers, or twelve, if New Zealand be\r\nexcluded, should be able to arrive at a uniform decision on so\r\ncomplicated and contentious a subject.  It was felt, also, that the\r\nParliaments had no popular mandate to deal with the question, and that,\r\nin the general apathy and absence of interest, the electors themselves\r\nshould be stirred up by direct participation in the movement.\r\nAccordingly, Mr. Reid, the Premier of New South Wales, invited the\r\nPremiers of the other Australian Provinces to meet him at Hobart in\r\nJanuary, 1895, taking advantage of the fact that four of them would be\r\nthere in connection with the biennial meeting of the Federal Council.\r\nThe invitation was accepted, and a new scheme was devised of which the\r\nmain principles were the popular election of delegates empowered to\r\nmeet and frame a Federal Constitution; the reference of the\r\nConstitution {228} so framed to a plebiscite of the several electorates\r\nand its subsequent transmission for Imperial legislation.  The Premiers\r\nof New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania accepted\r\nthe proposal in its entirety; the Premier of Queensland agreed to it,\r\nexcept as regards the reference of the Constitution to a plebiscite;\r\nbut the Premier of Western Australia was unable to concur with the\r\ndecision of his colleagues.  Sir John Forrest did not believe that\r\npopular election would lead to the choice of the most highly trained\r\njurists and financiers, who could alone frame a consistent and workable\r\nConstitution, and he regarded as absurd the assumption that the average\r\nelector could give an intelligent opinion upon a measure of so\r\ncomplicated a character.  There is much force in these objections; but\r\nit must be remembered that the former effort failed from its\r\ndissociation from popular impulse, and that the delegates would have\r\nthe benefit of the work of their predecessors, which they would be\r\nbound to accept as the basis of their deliberations.  As regards the\r\nplebiscite, it cannot have been expected that the vote of the bulk of\r\nthe electorate would be more than an affirmative or negative reply upon\r\nthe broadest issue; but, assuming it to be necessary that the\r\nConstitution Bill should in some manner or other be submitted for the\r\njudgment of each of the Provinces, the direct reference has the merit\r\nof being expeditious and conclusive and of avoiding the quagmire of\r\nParliamentary discussions.\r\n\r\n{229}\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to note the results of the resolutions passed at the\r\nPremiers' Conference, it may be of interest to consider to what extent\r\nrecent events have affected the status of the Federal Council.  As has\r\nalready been remarked, it has pursued a policy of self-effacement, and\r\nin spite of the increase in its numbers, it has never appealed to the\r\nimagination of Australians.  It was undoubtedly dwarfed by comparison\r\nwith the Federal Convention, which, indeed, decreed its contingent\r\nextinction, and it has, to some extent, been supplanted by the informal\r\nmeetings of Australian Premiers which tend to become an annual\r\ninstitution.  At a Conference held at Sydney in January, 1896, the\r\nurgent necessity for Federation was again emphasised, and it was\r\nresolved that, pending its attainment, the military laws of the\r\nProvinces should be assimilated, and a cordite factory be established\r\nunder State supervision.  Resolutions were also passed in favour of a\r\nFederal system of quarantine, the distribution of the cost of\r\nlighthouses on the basis of population, the extension to all coloured\r\nraces of the provisions of the Chinese Restriction Acts, and\r\nnon-participation in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty.  In this manner the\r\nPremiers, instead of referring questions to the Federal Council through\r\ntheir respective legislatures, decided, after personal consultation,\r\nupon measures which each would endeavour, in the common interest, to\r\npass through the Parliament of his own Province.  Other interprovincial\r\nconferences also {230} are becoming more common.  The precautions to be\r\nadopted against the tick fever were discussed at Sydney in 1896, and a\r\nfew months ago, earlier, several Ministers of Agriculture met the South\r\nAustralian Minister at Adelaide and decided upon the advisability of\r\nuniform legislation which would promote similarity of out-put in the\r\nproducts of the different Provinces, such as frozen meat, butter, wine,\r\nand fruit, for which it was hoped to create a large market in England.\r\nIt has been argued that the growing realisation of the interdependence\r\nof the Provinces and of the material advantages accruing from combined\r\naction, will tend to hasten the advent of Federation.\r\n\r\nThe new proposals in that direction were favourably received, and the\r\nLegislatures of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and\r\nTasmania passed the so-called Australasian Federation Enabling Act, in\r\nsubstantially similar form, upon the lines laid down by the Premiers.\r\nThe details of their scheme may be gathered from the principal\r\nprovisions of the Victorian Act:--\r\n\r\n\"The Convention shall consist of ten Representatives of each Colony\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n\"The Convention shall be charged with the duty of framing for\r\nAustralasia a Federal Constitution under the Crown in the form of a\r\nBill for enactment by the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Every Member and every person eligible for Membership of either House\r\nof Parliament shall be {231} eligible for Membership of the Convention\r\nas a Representative of Victoria.  And any one hundred or more electors\r\nduly qualified to vote for the election of a Member of the Legislative\r\nAssembly shall be entitled in the prescribed manner to nominate any\r\neligible person.\r\n\r\n\"Every person duly qualified to vote for the election of a member of\r\nthe Legislative Assembly shall be qualified and entitled to vote for\r\nthe election of Representatives of Victoria.\r\n\r\n\"The voting shall be taken throughout Victoria as one electoral\r\ndistrict, and every voter shall vote for the full number of\r\nRepresentatives required, otherwise the vote shall be rejected as\r\ninformal.\r\n\r\n\"No person shall vote or attempt to vote more than once at the same\r\nelection of Representatives of Victoria.\"\r\n\r\n(A similar provision applies to the subsequent referendum.)\r\n\r\n\"When the Constitution has been framed by the Convention, copies\r\nthereof shall be supplied to the Members of the Convention, and the\r\nPresident shall declare the sitting of the Convention adjourned to a\r\ntime and place to be fixed by the Convention, not being less than sixty\r\nnor more than one hundred and twenty days thereafter.  And as soon as\r\nconvenient the draft constitution shall be submitted for consideration\r\nto each House of Parliament sitting in Committee of the whole, and such\r\namendments as may be desired by the Legislature, {232} together with\r\nthe draft Constitution, shall be remitted to the Convention through the\r\nSenior Representative.\r\n\r\n\"On the reassembling of the Convention the Constitution as framed prior\r\nto the adjournment shall be reconsidered, together with such suggested\r\namendments as shall have been forwarded by the various Legislatures,\r\nand the Constitution so framed shall be finally adopted with any\r\namendments that may be agreed to.\"\r\n\r\n\"So soon as practicable after the close of the proceedings of the\r\nConvention the question of the acceptance or rejection of the\r\nConstitution shall be referred and submitted to the vote of all persons\r\nin Victoria qualified and entitled to vote for the election of Members\r\nof the Legislative Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The majority of votes shall decide the question, and if the\r\nConstitution be thereby rejected, no further action shall be taken\r\npursuant to this Act: Provided that any number of votes in the\r\naffirmative less than fifty thousand shall be equivalent to the\r\nrejection of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\"If two Colonies in addition to Victoria accept the Constitution the\r\nLegislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of Victoria may adopt\r\na Joint Address to the Queen praying that the Constitution may be\r\npassed into law by the Imperial Parliament upon receipt from the\r\nParliaments of such two Colonies, either of similar joint or separate\r\nAddresses from each House of such Parliaments.\"\r\n\r\n{233}\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the Convention will have entire freedom in\r\nregard to any amendments suggested by the Provincial Parliaments, and\r\nthat if the Constitution be accepted, the Victorian Parliament will not\r\nbe bound to join in submitting it for Imperial enactment.  It is\r\nassumed that it will bow to the popular pronouncement unless the\r\nGovernment should have some grave reason for recommending a contrary\r\ncourse.  A difficulty, not provided against in the Act, might arise if\r\nthe Constitution were to be amended during its passage through the\r\nImperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Act passed by Western Australia provided for the election of the\r\ndelegates by the two Houses of Parliament sitting as one Chamber, the\r\narea of selection being limited to candidates nominated by not less\r\nthan twenty persons who are qualified to vote at elections for Members\r\nof the Assembly.  \"The draft Constitution, as finally adopted by the\r\nConvention, if approved by Parliament, shall be submitted for the\r\ndecision of the electors of Western Australia by their vote; and if a\r\nmajority of the electors voting on such question signify their approval\r\nof such Constitution, the same may be adopted by the Colony, provided\r\nthat any number of votes in the affirmative less than six thousand\r\nshall be equivalent to the rejection of the Constitution.\"  \"The\r\nadoption of the Constitution by Western Australia may be signified by\r\nthe passing of an Act or by a joint resolution of both Houses of {234}\r\nParliament, and both Houses may thereupon adopt Addresses to the Queen,\r\npraying that the Constitution may be passed into law by the Imperial\r\nParliament, subject to the adoption of similar Addresses by at least\r\ntwo other Colonies, of which New South Wales shall be one.\"  Parliament\r\nthus retains the initiative in each successive phase of the movement,\r\nbut will have no power to alter the Bill when it finally leaves the\r\nConvention.  If the provisions are regarded as unacceptable, it will be\r\nable to decline to submit the Bill to the electorate.  The Western\r\nAustralian measure was based in its general language upon that\r\npreviously introduced in Queensland, but differed from it in several\r\nimportant particulars.  In the latter case it was proposed that the\r\nelection of the delegates should be vested in the members of the\r\nAssembly alone, that, of the ten delegates, five should be chosen by\r\nthe Southern, three by the Northern, and two by the Central\r\nParliamentary Representatives, a provision inserted in view of the\r\nsomewhat divergent interests of different portions of the Province, and\r\nthat the draft Constitution should be submitted for the consideration\r\nof the electors in such manner as Parliament might prescribe.  The Bill\r\nwas passed by the Assembly, in spite of a widespread feeling that\r\nQueensland should have followed the course of the other Provinces, and\r\nwas amended by the Council, which regarded itself as unjustifiably\r\nignored, and provided that it should have an equal {235} share with the\r\nAssembly in the appointment of the delegates to the Convention.  It is\r\nunnecessary to consider the arguments by which the Premier supported\r\nhis proposal of indirect election, or those put forward by the two\r\nHouses during the deadlock which followed upon their disagreement.\r\nFinally, when each House had insisted several times upon its attitude,\r\nthe Bill was laid aside by the Council.  As a result of this action the\r\nnew movement was blocked at its first step, which was regarded with\r\nlittle anxiety even by those who appreciated the difficulties which\r\nwere likely to attend the later stages.  Great disappointment was felt\r\nin Australia, and efforts were made, though in vain, to induce Sir Hugh\r\nNelson to reintroduce the Bill in some form that would be acceptable to\r\nboth Houses.  At the same time public opinion demanded that the\r\nConvention should be held, even though one of the Provinces would be\r\nunrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe benefits which would follow Federation are so obvious as scarcely\r\nto require enumeration.  The Federal Government would be able to deal\r\nadequately with the problem of National Defence and to speak\r\nauthoritatively, to the manifest satisfaction of the Imperial\r\nAuthorities, upon such matters as the contribution of Australia towards\r\nthe expenses of the Imperial squadron maintained upon its coast; the\r\nconsolidation of the debts would, it has been estimated, enable a\r\nmillion pounds to be saved upon the annual bill of interest;\r\nInterprovincial {236} Free Trade would promote intercourse between\r\nneighbours who have hitherto been estranged by arbitrary lines of\r\ndemarcation; and in the words of the Chief Justice of Queensland,[4]\r\n\"The first effect in point of importance, though some time may elapse\r\nbefore the effect is fully felt, will be the creation of an Australian\r\nNation, forming a distinct constituent part of the British Empire,\r\nhaving one mind, speaking with one voice instead of the six, often\r\ndiscordant and sometimes inarticulate, voices now heard, consulted on\r\nall matters of Imperial concern, and exercising a powerful influence in\r\nthe political affairs of the whole world.\"  Such would appear to be the\r\ndestiny of Australia, which has, however, doubtless been benefited by\r\nthe independent development of its component parts.  In the absence of\r\ndistinctions of race and language, in the general diffusion of the\r\nRoman Catholics among the Protestants, and the steady determination to\r\nexclude coloured races, the early establishment of Federal relations\r\nwould have produced among Australians a monotonous uniformity of\r\ncharacteristics, which has to some extent been prevented by the\r\ndivergent political tendencies of the several Provinces.\r\n\r\nBut, to put the practical question, what are the prospects of\r\nFederation?  The general impression is not one of hopefulness: it is\r\npointed out that the {237} Provinces have so long maintained an\r\nindependent existence that they are unlikely to submit to a curtailment\r\nof their powers except under the imperative impulse of the fear of\r\nforeign invasion; that all but the leading politicians realise that\r\nthey would be affected prejudicially by a change which would dwarf the\r\nLegislatures with which they are connected; that many, especially\r\nduring the period of depression, dread the creation of a new taxing and\r\ngoverning body; and that the Labour members, in the natural belief that\r\ntheir influence would be smaller in a Federal Parliament, are either\r\napathetic or actively hostile.  The economic aspects of Intercolonial\r\nFree Trade, in reference to its probable effect upon the prosperity of\r\nmanufacturers and producers in the different Provinces, also form an\r\nimportant factor in the situation.  Time alone can show whether popular\r\nparticipation in the successive stages of the movement, though it will\r\nnot be universal, will generate an enthusiasm sufficient to outweigh\r\nthe opposing forces and weld Australia into a strong and united Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO IX.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW FEDERAL SCHEME.[5]\r\n\r\nNow that the Adelaide Convention has completed its labours, it is\r\npossible to give a connected view of the provisions of the draft\r\nConstitution Bill, as it will be submitted to the local {238}\r\nParliament, and then after it has been again dealt with by a second\r\nmeeting of the Convention at Sydney, to the vote of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Bill provides for the constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia\r\nand for the appointment of a governor-general by the Queen, at a salary\r\nof L10,000.  The Federal Parliament is to consist of two Houses--the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives.  The former chamber will be\r\ncomposed of six members for each state.  They are to be elected by the\r\nelectors of the Legislative Assembly in each colony for a term of six\r\nyears, and one-half will retire every three years.  For the election of\r\nthese senators each colony will be regarded as one electorate, and no\r\none will be allowed to vote at more than one polling-booth on the day\r\nof election.  In other words, the election will be conducted on the\r\nsame lines as the recent election of representatives to the Federation\r\nConvention.  At the first meeting of the Senate, the members elected\r\nfor each state will be divided by lot into two classes, and the seats\r\nof those in the first class are to be vacated at the end of the third\r\nyear, but the others will continue to be members of that House for the\r\nfull term of six years.  In this way one-half the members of the Senate\r\nwill be elected by the people every third year.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives is to be composed of members directly\r\nchosen by the people of the several states, and the number which each\r\ncolony will return will depend on its population.  This Chamber is, as\r\nnearly as practicable, to contain double the number of members of the\r\nSenate.  The House of Representatives would therefore consist, at the\r\noutset, of about seventy-two members, which would give as nearly as\r\npossible, one member for every 50,000 of the population.  Victoria\r\nwould, roughly speaking, have about twenty-two members.  In order,\r\nhowever, to protect the interests of the smaller states in this House,\r\nit is provided that Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia,\r\nshall be entitled to at least five members each, although on the\r\npopulation basis, the island colony might not be able to claim more\r\nthan four members.  Until the Federal Parliament otherwise provides,\r\neach local or state Parliament can determine into how many electoral\r\ndivisions the colony should be divided for the purpose of returning\r\nmembers to the House of Representatives, but should it not divide the\r\nstate into {239} electoral districts, then each colony is to be\r\nregarded as one electorate, in the same way as in the case of the\r\nelection of senators.\r\n\r\nThe duration of every House of Representatives will be three years,\r\nunless it is sooner dissolved by the Governor-General.  There is no\r\npower, however, conferred on the Governor-General to dissolve the\r\nSenate.  The qualification of electors of members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives is in each state to be that for electors of the more\r\nnumerous House--or Legislative Assembly--of the state.  The members of\r\nboth Houses are to receive an allowance of L400 each per annum for\r\ntheir services.\r\n\r\nThe following are the subjects the Commonwealth Parliament is to be\r\nempowered to legislate upon and deal with:--\r\n\r\n1. The regulation of trade and commerce with other countries and among\r\nthe several states.\r\n\r\n2. Customs and excise and bounties.\r\n\r\n3. Raising money by any other mode or system of taxation.\r\n\r\n4. Borrowing money on the public credit of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n5. Postal and telegraphic services.\r\n\r\n6. The military and naval defence of the commonwealth and the several\r\nstates, and the calling out of the forces to execute and maintain the\r\nlaws of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n7. Munitions of war.\r\n\r\n8. Navigation and shipping.\r\n\r\n9. Ocean beacons and buoys and ocean lighthouses and lightships.\r\n\r\n10. Astronomical and meteorological observations.\r\n\r\n11. Quarantine.\r\n\r\n12. Fisheries in Australian waters beyond territorial limits.\r\n\r\n13. Census and statistics.\r\n\r\n14. Currency, coinage, and legal tender.\r\n\r\n15. Banking, the incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money.\r\n\r\n16. Insurance, excluding state insurance not extending beyond the\r\nlimits of the state concerned.\r\n\r\n17. Weights and measures.\r\n\r\n18. Bills of exchange and promissory notes.\r\n\r\n19. Bankruptcy and insolvency.\r\n\r\n20. Copyrights and patents of inventions, designs, and trade marks.\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\n21. Naturalisation and aliens.\r\n\r\n22. Foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations, formed\r\nin any state or part of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n23. Marriage and divorce.\r\n\r\n24. Parental rights, and the custody and guardianship of infants.\r\n\r\n25. The service and execution throughout the commonwealth of the civil\r\nand criminal process and judgments of the courts of the states.\r\n\r\n26. The recognition throughout the commonwealth of the laws, the public\r\nacts and records, and the judicial proceedings of the states.\r\n\r\n27. Immigration and emigration.\r\n\r\n28. The influx of criminals.\r\n\r\n29. External affairs and treaties.\r\n\r\n30. The relations of the commonwealth to the islands of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n31. The control and regulation of the navigation of the River Murray,\r\nand the use of the waters thereof from where it first forms the\r\nboundary between Victoria and New South Wales to the sea.\r\n\r\n32. The control of railways with respect to transport for the military\r\npurposes of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n33. The taking over by the commonwealth, with the consent of the state,\r\nof the whole or any part of the railways of any state or states, upon\r\nsuch terms as may be arranged between the commonwealth and the state.\r\n\r\n34. Railway construction and extension with the consent of any state or\r\nstates concerned.\r\n\r\n35. Matters referred to the Parliament of the commonwealth by the\r\nParliament or Parliaments of any state or states, but so that the law\r\nshall extend only to the state or states by whose Parliament or\r\nParliaments the matter was referred, and to such other states as may\r\nafterwards adopt the law.\r\n\r\n36. The exercise within the commonwealth, at the request or with the\r\nconcurrence of the Parliaments of all the states concerned, of any\r\nlegislative powers which can at the establishment of this constitution\r\nbe exercised only by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or by the\r\nFederal Council of Australasia.\r\n\r\n37. Any matters necessary for, or incidental to, the carrying {241}\r\ninto execution of the foregoing powers or of any other powers vested by\r\nthis constitution in the Parliament or the Executive Government of the\r\ncommonwealth, or in any department or officer thereof.\r\n\r\nAll matters not mentioned above, such as land settlement, railway\r\nconstruction, &c., are to remain vested in the Parliaments of the\r\nseveral states.  Each state shall retain its local Parliament and have\r\na Governor, who is to be appointed by the Crown, and communicate direct\r\nwith the Crown as at present.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of the commonwealth the control of the following\r\ndepartments will be taken over by the Federal Government, and the\r\ncommonwealth will assume the obligations of any state or states with\r\nrespect to such matters:--\r\n\r\nCustoms and excise.\r\n\r\nPosts and telegraphs.\r\n\r\nMilitary and naval defence.\r\n\r\nOcean beacons, buoys, lighthouses.\r\n\r\nQuarantine.\r\n\r\nThere are to be seven Ministers of State, and their salaries will, in\r\nthe aggregate, be L12,000 per annum.  A Minister, within three months\r\nafter being appointed to that office, must become a member of one of\r\nthe Houses of the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\nAll Bills having for their main object the appropriation of any part of\r\nthe public revenue, or moneys, or the imposition of any tax, must\r\noriginate in the House of Representatives.  Bills imposing taxation\r\nmust deal with the imposition of taxation only, and those imposing\r\nduties of Customs or excise must deal with duties of Customs or excise\r\nonly.  The expenditure for services other than the ordinary annual\r\nservices of the Government must not be authorised by the same law as\r\nthat which appropriates the supplies for the ordinary annual services,\r\nbut must be authorised by a separate measure.  The Senate can amend any\r\nBills except those imposing taxation, or appropriating the necessary\r\nsupplies for the ordinary annual services of the Government.  With\r\nrespect to these money measures, the Senate can, at any stage, return a\r\ntaxation or appropriation Bill to the House of Representatives,\r\nsuggesting that any provision or item therein should be omitted or\r\namended, and the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make\r\nsuch omissions or amendments with or without modifications.  The Bill,\r\nin its {242} amended or original form--should the House of\r\nRepresentatives decline to adopt the suggestion of the Senate--will\r\nthen be sent back to the latter Chamber, which may either pass or\r\nreject the measure.\r\n\r\nThe seat of the Government of the commonwealth is to be determined by\r\nthe Federal Parliament.  Until such determination the Parliament shall\r\nbe summoned to meet at such place as the majority of the Governors of\r\nthe states, or, in the event of an equal division of opinion amongst\r\nthem, as the Governor-General may direct.\r\n\r\nBefore the Constitution can be amended an absolute majority of both the\r\nHouse of Representatives and Senate must approve of the alteration, and\r\nit must then be confirmed by a vote of the people, a majority of the\r\nstates being required as well as a majority of the people.\r\n\r\nThere is to be a federal judiciary, consisting of a high court of\r\nAustralia, and such inferior courts as Parliament may determine.  The\r\nhigh court is to consist of a chief justice, and at least four other\r\njudges, and is to hear appeals from the state courts and inferior\r\nfederal courts.  This appeal is to be final, except that in matters\r\naffecting the public interests of the commonwealth or of any state,\r\napplication may be made to the Queen for special leave to appeal to the\r\nPrivy Council.  Uniform Customs duties are to be imposed within two\r\nyears of the establishment of the commonwealth, and trade and\r\nintercourse throughout the commonwealth is then to be absolutely free.\r\nIn the meantime the local tariffs are to continue, but they will be\r\ncollected by the Federal Government, and after deducting from the\r\nrevenue received in each state the contribution of that state towards\r\nfederal expenses, the balance is to be returned to the state month by\r\nmonth.  During the first three years after federation the total annual\r\nexpenditure of the Federal Government is to be limited to L300,000 for\r\nnew federal expenses, and L1,250,000 for services transferred from the\r\nstates.  During the first five years after the imposition of a uniform\r\ntariff, the surplus revenue, after deducting the contribution of each\r\nstate to the federal expenses, is to be returned to the states in the\r\nfollowing way: Accounts of Customs and excise duties collected in each\r\nstate are to be kept during the twelve months following the coming into\r\noperation of the uniform tariff, in order to ascertain, first the\r\naverage net amount per head in each state, and next the {243} average\r\nper head for the whole commonweath.  A sliding scale, extending over\r\nfour years, is then to be adopted, in order to determine the amount to\r\nbe returned.  Where the average for a particular state for the first\r\nyear is less than the general average, the per capita sum is to be\r\nincreased by equal gradations, until, at the end of four years, it\r\nequals the general average.  Similarly, where the average for a state\r\nis greater than the general average, it is to be gradually reduced to\r\nthe general average.  Then, at the end of the five-year period, all the\r\nstates will be placed on the same footing, and will receive an equal\r\nsum per head from the federal revenue.  This scheme of distribution is\r\nsubject, however, to the important proviso that during the five years\r\nthe aggregate amount returned to all the states in any year must not be\r\nless than the aggregate amount returned in the year immediately\r\npreceding the imposition of uniform duties.\r\n\r\nEquality of trade is to be preserved throughout the commonwealth, and\r\nany law or regulation derogating from that principle is to be null and\r\nvoid.  Parliament may appoint an interstate commission to execute and\r\nmaintain upon railways within the commonwealth, and upon rivers flowing\r\nthrough, in, or between two or more states the provisions of the\r\nconstitution relating to trade and commerce.  The commission is to have\r\nsuch powers of adjudication and administration as may be necessary for\r\nits purposes, and as the Parliament may from time to time determine,\r\nbut shall have no powers in reference to the rates or regulations of\r\nany railway in any state, except in cases of rates or regulations\r\npreferential in effect, and made and used for the purpose of drawing\r\ntraffic to that railway from the railway of a neighbouring state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"The Federal Council of Australasia,\" by the Hon.

Before that time\r\nthe soil was held in large areas by pastoralists who, in the absence of\r\nopposing forces, would have formed themselves gradually into a strong\r\nlanded aristocracy.  But the miners, a class of men who had shown their\r\nenergy and determination by their readiness to travel thousands of\r\nmiles in the search for wealth, introduced an entirely new element:\r\nthey had thrown off their traditionary reverence for vested\r\ninstitutions, they were able to earn high wages or directly to enrich\r\nthemselves, {245} and they resented an assumption of superiority on the\r\npart of any section in the community.  When, in the course of years,\r\nthe mining industry began to wane, they swarmed into the towns and\r\nconstituted an important link in the chain of causes which has swelled\r\nsome of the capitals to their present unwieldy dimensions.  Deprived of\r\ntheir means of livelihood, and indisposed for rural life, they\r\nclamoured for other employment, and were able, in several Provinces, to\r\ninduce the Ministry to impose a protective tariff which artificially\r\nfostered the growth of manufactures.  The protective tariff naturally\r\nincreased the urban population, as did the undiscriminative system of\r\nState-aided immigration, the centralisation of all departments of the\r\nGovernment, and, in its ultimate effects, the construction of public\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nIn a population of pastoralists and miners, engaged in pursuits which\r\ninculcate reliance upon individual efforts, it is somewhat strange to\r\nnote the early development of a tendency towards State socialism; but I\r\nam inclined to think that, in this respect also, the discoveries of\r\ngold exercised a permanent influence, not only in the Provinces\r\nimmediately affected, but throughout Australasia, from a tendency\r\ntowards imitation.  In the first years of Responsible Government\r\nBritish capitalists had a natural distrust of Australian securities,\r\nand declined to advance money except at a high rate of interest.  But\r\nwhen they saw the phenomenal increase in the {246} yield of gold, and\r\nthe large revenue obtained from the sale of lands, they overcame their\r\nscruples and displayed, during the twenty years which preceded the\r\nfinancial crisis, a readiness to grant loans to the several Governments\r\nwhich is believed by many to have been a great misfortune to their\r\ndebtors.\r\n\r\nThe political and unremunerative railways of Victoria, which have been\r\ndiscussed in the chapter dealing with that Province, could not have\r\nbeen constructed but for the easy access to large funds.  Another\r\naspect of the question has been emphasised in an article published by\r\nthe Sydney _Bulletin_[1] which, however much an Englishman may demur to\r\nits Republican principles, must be admitted to be an authority on\r\nAustralasian topics.  A strong plea is put forward for the necessity of\r\ndefining by Act of Parliament what kind of works should be charged to\r\nloan-moneys, and what should be charged to revenue.  The advantages, it\r\nis contended, will be threefold; the attention of the country will be\r\ndrawn to the matter; the Loan Estimates go through so rapidly that very\r\nfew people are aware how the thing is worked.  The lender will know the\r\ndestination of his money, and all treasurers will be placed on a level,\r\nwhereas, at present, \"the dishonest treasurer who makes a surplus by\r\nusing borrowed money for road repairs and all manner of other ordinary\r\nexpenditure is a heaven-born financier, while the honest one who\r\ndoesn't is driven out of {247} office, either for having a deficit, or\r\nfor increasing taxation, and is a failure either way.\"  Official\r\nfigures are quoted for New South Wales in order to prove that during\r\nthe years 1885-1890, which covered the flotation of several loans,\r\nsurpluses and deficits alternated as the treasurer was or was not able\r\nto dispose of borrowed funds.  Indirectly, of course, many of the\r\npublic works which do not produce a direct revenue may be of financial\r\nbenefit to the State, through an increase of population and the\r\nencouragement of settlement; but it is a hazardous principle to borrow\r\nmoney for their construction.\r\n\r\nEqually dangerous for Australia was the more recent excessive eagerness\r\nof the British capitalist to invest his money in Australian commercial\r\nundertakings, as, according to the Victorian Year Book,[2] a\r\npublication of the highest merit, \"there is no doubt that the feverish\r\nfinancial activity that preceded, and ultimately led to, the Australian\r\nfinancial crisis primarily arose from the enormous influx of British\r\ncapital--far in excess of the legitimate requirements of the\r\nColonies--for remunerative enterprises.  This influx was probably the\r\nresult of the large amount of attention that for some years prior to\r\n1888 had been directed to these Colonies, which were brought into\r\nprominence by such events as the passing of the first Federal Council\r\nAct by the Imperial Parliament in 1885, the Colonial and Indian\r\nExhibition held in London in 1886, and the Imperial {248} Conference in\r\n1887; it was also much stimulated by the lowering in 1888 of the\r\ninterest on the British Public Debt, and _pro rata_ on other\r\nfirst-class British securities.  The first indications of this were\r\nnoticeable in the marked rise in the prices of all Colonial Government\r\nsecurities which occurred just after Mr. Goschen's notification of his\r\nscheme for reducing the interest on the National Debt of the United\r\nKingdom, in March, 1888.  Such securities, however, being of limited\r\nextent, the superabundant capital was forced into private channels,\r\nwhich led to the growth of co-operative enterprise on an unprecedented\r\nscale--through the medium of joint stock companies--which commenced\r\nprior to, but probably in anticipation of, the conversion of the\r\nBritish Public Debt, and culminated in the United Kingdom, as well as\r\nin Australia, in the same year.  Owing to this increasing competition\r\nfor Colonial Government securities, and the consequent fall in the rate\r\nof interest thereon, the Colonial Governments were tempted to, and no\r\ndoubt did, borrow in excess of their immediate requirements, although\r\nthis was not recognised during the period of general inflation; but\r\nassuming a portion of the Government loans to have been unjustified,\r\nfar worse was the condition of the large private investments, chiefly\r\nin joint stock companies, many of which supplemented their resources by\r\ndeposits--equivalent in some cases to as much as three times the\r\npaid-up capital--which had been drawn, by reason of the high rates\r\n{249} of interest offered, from all sections of the community, both in\r\nEngland and Australia.  Between the 1st of January, 1887, and the 30th\r\nof June, 1893, but for the most part in 1888, 1,154 companies with a\r\npaid-up capital of no less than L28,436,500 (subscribed capital\r\nL54,300,000) were registered in Victoria alone, and of these, 397, with\r\na paid-up capital of L9,469,000 (subscribed capital L19,526,000) are\r\nknown to have become defunct, to say nothing of numerous others, of\r\nwhich no information has been furnished to the Registrar-General.\"  The\r\ncrisis was most acute in Victoria, but its effects were felt largely,\r\nand are still felt in calls upon shareholders, in other Provinces.  In\r\nconclusion, while British capitalists are still chary of industrial\r\ninvestments, they appear to be willing to meet the Australasian\r\nGovernments in their resumption of applications for loans.\r\n\r\nThe danger is accentuated by the tendency towards State socialism, the\r\norigin of which I had begun to discuss before this long digression.\r\nThe earliest concessions for the construction of railways were granted\r\nin New South Wales in 1848 and 1853, but the companies were unable to\r\ncarry out their undertakings, owing to the scarcity of workmen caused\r\nby the rush to the goldfields, and the Government stepped in and\r\ncompleted the railways out of public funds.  This assumption by the\r\nState of a function which had been delegated to private enterprise,\r\ncoupled with the growing confidence of the British investor and the\r\nelasticity of the revenue, {250} both from the Customs and from the\r\ndisposal of land, which had been accelerated by the rapid increase of\r\npopulation, appears to have convinced the political leaders of the\r\nadvisability of the Governmental extension of the railway lines.  They\r\nwere enabled to carry out this policy without difficulty, as the bulk\r\nof the electors were engrossed in material pursuits and did not trouble\r\nthemselves about political issues.  In Victoria three short lines of\r\nrailways were constructed during the fifties by private companies, but\r\nwere subsequently purchased by the Government, which thenceforward\r\nmonopolised the construction of new lines.  Why Victoria and the other\r\nProvinces should have decided in favour of State ownership and\r\nmanagement of railways I am unable to explain, except upon the\r\nhypothesis that they were influenced by the example of New South Wales,\r\nthat they wished to open up the country more quickly than would\r\notherwise have been possible, and that they were tempted by the funds\r\nat their disposal in surpluses of revenue over expenditure.  Then, the\r\nrailways having in many instances preceded population, it was\r\nnecessary, if the lines were not to be unprofitable, that special steps\r\nshould be taken in order to promote settlement.  This was done, partly\r\nby the offer of land upon favourable conditions, partly by the payment\r\nout of the National Exchequer of all the expenses of Local Government.\r\nIn New South Wales this state of things still prevails in many of the\r\nrural districts; in {251} the other Provinces _pro rata_ subsidies are\r\npaid to the Local Authorities, but are limited, in some cases, to a\r\nfixed term of years.  The Local Bodies have had no spontaneous\r\nevolution; they are the creation of the Central Government, they are\r\nsupported and controlled by it, and look to it for assistance whenever\r\nthey are in financial difficulties.  It would seem that, accustomed to\r\nState railways and to dependency upon the State in their local affairs,\r\nAustralasians have been led insensibly to magnify the efficacy of its\r\nintervention and to welcome every enlargement of its sphere of action.\r\nThe protective tariff appears to have had a similar effect, unless it\r\nis to be regarded as a mere coincidence that South Australia, New\r\nZealand, and Victoria, which alone are avowedly Protectionist, have\r\nauthorised the widest extension of the functions of the State.\r\n\r\nThroughout Australasia all parties in the several Parliaments are\r\nagreed on the principle of the State ownership of railways.  In\r\nVictoria and Queensland the railways are entirely in the hands of the\r\nGovernment; in New South Wales and South Australia they are so with\r\nsome trifling exceptions; in Tasmania, Western Australia, and New\r\nZealand a few private lines have been authorised because it has been\r\nadvisable, in the interests of settlement, that they should be\r\nconstructed, and the Governments have been unable or unwilling to\r\nundertake further financial obligations.  The recent action of Western\r\nAustralia may be mentioned in evidence of {252} the prevalent feeling,\r\nit having taken advantage of its improved credit to purchase one of the\r\nprivate lines.  The waterworks of the capitals, also, are national or\r\nmunicipal property; but other municipal monopolies, such as gasworks\r\nand tramways, are mostly in the hands of private companies.\r\n\r\nThe railways of Australasia are worked, as far as is consonant with\r\nnational interests, for the direct benefit of producers, who, as has\r\nbeen seen in the chapters dealing with individual Provinces, have been\r\nthe special object of the paternal solicitude of their Governments.\r\nThe various efforts in this direction may briefly be recapitulated.\r\nSouth Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, and New Zealand make\r\nadvances to settlers at low rates of interest; South Australia sells\r\nits wines in London; Queensland facilitates the erection of sugar\r\nmills, and is proposing to establish depots in London and the provinces\r\nfor the receipt and distribution of its frozen meat; Victoria and South\r\nAustralia have given a bonus upon the exportation of dairy produce.\r\nThese Provinces and New Zealand receive such produce, grade and freeze\r\nit free of charge or at a rate which barely covers the expenses.\r\nVictoria has given subsidies towards the erection of butter factories;\r\nVictoria and New Zealand have subsidised the mining industry; and\r\nWestern Australia has adopted a comprehensive scheme for the supply of\r\nwater to the Coolgardie Goldfields.\r\n\r\nThe above brief summary shows that action by {253} the State for the\r\npromotion of enterprise has met with approval in Queensland and Western\r\nAustralia as well as in the Provinces which have adopted the widest\r\nextensions of the franchise.  It maybe noted, however, that Sir Hugh\r\nNelson, the Premier of Queensland, is an individualist at heart, and\r\nconsents to extensions of the functions of the State unwillingly upon a\r\nconviction of their necessity; while, in Western Australia, Sir John\r\nForrest is a strong advocate of State socialism, and opposed to\r\nprivate-enterprise in any matter which is of the nature of a monopoly.\r\nNew South Wales and Tasmania have not hitherto followed the lead of the\r\nother Provinces.  This tendency is one of the most marked of recent\r\nyears, and received a strong impetus from the financial crisis of 1893,\r\nwhich burst the bubble of a fictitious prosperity and compelled\r\nattention to the strenuous development of the resources of the soil.\r\nIt is likely to lead to closer relations between the Provinces, from\r\nthe appreciation of the fact that the exports of one Province, if\r\nunregulated and allowed to fall into disrepute, may prejudicially\r\naffect the interests of the whole continent.\r\n\r\nAs regards the intervention of the State in the direction of industrial\r\nlegislation, the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania have had\r\nlittle cause to take action, in the absence of crowded centres and of\r\nmanufacturing activity; but New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland,\r\nSouth Australia, {254} and New Zealand have placed stringent Factory\r\nActs upon their Statute Books.  Measures have also been passed, largely\r\nunder the influence of Labour Representatives, dealing with the\r\nliability of employers, the regulation of mines, the protection of shop\r\nassistants, and other matters affecting the welfare of the working\r\nclasses.  Upon their enactment complaints have been made of undue\r\ninterference with employers; but the administration is now, in most\r\ncases, carried out efficiently and without unnecessary friction.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, the various Provinces have, through their schemes of public\r\nworks, exercised considerable influence upon the demand for labour and\r\nhave, upon the completion of the more important undertakings, been\r\nsubject to continual pressure with the object of inducing them to\r\nauthorise special works for the benefit of those who have been deprived\r\nof their livelihood.  New South Wales, indeed, and, to a lesser extent,\r\nVictoria, have almost admitted an obligation to provide work or rations\r\nfor the unemployed.  In Victoria the tension has been relaxed by the\r\nformation of the Labour Colony of Leongatha, at which the destitute can\r\nobtain temporary subsistence.  Australian politicians, generally, were\r\nappalled by the undeserved misery which resulted from the cessation of\r\npublic works and from the financial disturbances, and, under the stress\r\nof humanitarian motives, failed to temper their humanity with\r\ndiscretion, and initiated a policy of {255} indiscriminate assistance\r\nfrom which, once entered upon, it has been difficult for them to draw\r\nback.  The formation of village settlements in all the Provinces except\r\nWestern Australia was based upon the necessity for special efforts in\r\nthe face of the prevailing distress.  Australians have never been able\r\nto regard the unemployed as a necessary factor in their economic\r\nsystem.  The ordinary problems of pauperism have been felt acutely in\r\nAustralasia and have been met in somewhat similar fashion in the\r\ndifferent Provinces.  Destitute children are, in most cases, boarded\r\nout; the aged and incapable are provided for in Benevolent Asylums.  In\r\nVictoria, New South Wales, and New Zealand a movement has recently\r\narisen for the adoption of a system of old-age pensions, which has had\r\nno appreciable results in the former Province, but has led in New South\r\nWales to the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee which reported\r\nfavourably and suggested forms of additional taxation by which the\r\nnecessary funds might be obtained, and in New Zealand to the\r\nintroduction of a Ministerial measure which sought to establish the\r\ngeneral principle and left to the House the elaboration of the\r\nfinancial details.  The Bill was accepted on its second reading, but in\r\nCommittee an amendment was carried against the Government to the effect\r\nthat all persons above the age of sixty-five, irrespectively of their\r\nmeans, should be entitled to receive a pension.  An Act was, however,\r\nsubsequently passed of which the {256} object is to ascertain the\r\nprobable cost of a pension fund.  All persons of the age of sixty-five\r\nand upwards, who have resided in the Province for twenty years,\r\nimprisonment being reckoned as absence, and are not possessed of an\r\nincome exceeding L50 a year, are entitled to apply for a pension\r\ncertificate which will be issued to them upon the verification of their\r\nclaims, and will be regarded as conclusive if a pension fund be\r\nestablished hereafter.  The success of the Government at the recent\r\nelections renders it probable that the matter will shortly receive\r\nattention.  In neither of the Provinces in which the subject has been\r\ndiscussed is it proposed that the pension should be earned by previous\r\ncontributions; it is to be offered as a free gift in recognition of the\r\nservices which every worker must have rendered to the community.\r\n\r\nTo conclude a superficial summary of the functions undertaken, or\r\nlikely to be undertaken, by the State in Australasia, it may be\r\nmentioned that the State system of primary education is in all the\r\nProvinces compulsory and undenominational.  In South Australia,\r\nVictoria, Queensland, and New Zealand it is also free; in the other\r\nProvinces fees are charged but may be remitted, wholly or partly, in\r\nthe case of the inability of parents to pay them.  There are no signs\r\nthat the advocates of grants in aid of denominational education are\r\ngaining ground; in the direct reference to the {257} electors taken in\r\nSouth Australia they were defeated by a large majority, and have\r\nequally little chance of securing subsidies to religious bodies.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of great activity on the part of the State, it is\r\ninteresting to note to what extent the working classes have exerted\r\nthemselves on their own behalf.  Distributive co-operation has not\r\nbecome popular owing, partly, according to the _Australasian_,[3] \"to\r\nthe vicissitudes in trade which are inseparable from new countries, and\r\nto the temptations which are consequently held out to the workers from\r\ntime to time to change their occupations and abodes.  Partly, too, an\r\nexplanation may be found in the efficacy of existing agencies for\r\ndistribution.  But we cannot help thinking that it is due also, in\r\npart, to the pernicious ideas which lead so many of our artisans to cry\r\nout against capital, and to seek the aid of the State, instead of\r\ntrusting to their own efforts and determining to become capitalists\r\nthemselves in a way which has been proved by the co-operative societies\r\nat home to be thoroughly practical.\"  Though the _Australasian_ is\r\nstrongly individualistic in its bias, it appears to be justified in its\r\nreference to a certain lack of initiative shown by Australasian\r\nworkmen; they are inclined to look upon the State as a gold mine from\r\nwhich they can draw permanent dividends, especially as they are\r\nscarcely, if at all, affected directly by the periodical calls upon the\r\n{258} shareholders; but, in his strictures upon the attitude of labour\r\ntowards capital, the writer should have added that the wealthy classes\r\nare at least as ready to misjudge every effort made by the Labour\r\nRepresentatives to pass remedial measures through the legislatures.\r\nProceeding to deal with the co-operation of producers, he says that\r\n\"there is co-operation of this kind already in our butter and cheese\r\nfactories, where the farmer who conveys his produce to the factory may\r\nalso be a shareholder, and at the end of the half-year may receive a\r\ndividend on his shares and a bonus on the milk supplied, in addition to\r\nthe established price.  Co-operation of a like kind prevails, to some\r\nextent, though not so largely as might be desired, between the graziers\r\nand the companies for the export of Australian meat.\"  These remarks,\r\nwhich refer primarily to Victoria, are generally true of Australasia.\r\n\r\nBut, while the working classes look constantly to the State for\r\nassistance in various forms, they can be shown to have made\r\nconsiderable provision against the future.  In spite of bad times, the\r\nnumber of depositors in Australasian Savings Banks rose from 742,000 in\r\n1891 to 895,000 in 1895, and the total amount of deposits from 19 to 26\r\nmillions.  Victoria and South Australia, which are followed closely by\r\nNew Zealand, have the largest number of depositors in proportion to\r\npopulation, 29 and 24 per 100 respectively, and Queensland and New\r\n{259} South Wales the highest average amount of deposits.[4]  In the\r\nthree Provinces, therefore, in which the paternal action of the\r\nGovernment is carried to the furthest extent, we find the widest\r\ndiffusion of an important exemplification of the spirit of thrift.  I\r\nam far from suggesting a relation of cause and effect, as the amount of\r\nsavings must depend largely upon the rate of wages, the abundance or\r\nscarcity of employment, the cost of living, and many other factors, and\r\nwould merely point out that the policy in question does not appear to\r\nhave deterred the working classes from individual efforts.\r\n\r\nAs regards Friendly Societies, South Australia takes the lead with a\r\nmembership exceeding one in ten of the population; Victoria comes next\r\nwith one in fifteen, and is third in the average amount of funds per\r\nmember.  Under the latter head New Zealand occupied the first place\r\nwith L18 8s. 2d., and is followed by Western Australia with L17 10s.\r\n4d., but the latter amount is of no comparative importance owing to the\r\nvery small number of subscribers.[5]\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the average amount of assurance per head of the population in\r\nAustralasia was L20, the average sum assured per policy L285, and the\r\naverage number of policies per 1,000 of the population, 70.  Compared\r\nwith the United Kingdom, {260} Australasia has a considerable advantage\r\nin the first of these figures, has the proportion reversed in the\r\nsecond, but wins by more than two to one on the last, which is the most\r\ninteresting as a further indication of the prevalence of the instinct\r\nof providence among Australasian workmen.[6]  Prior to the recent\r\ncrisis the working classes had availed themselves largely of the\r\nopportunities which Building Societies offered to them to secure the\r\nfreehold of their homes by payments spread over a term of years; but a\r\nrun upon the deposits lodged in these institutions, which set in\r\ntowards the end of 1891, and continued during 1892, affected them\r\ndisastrously, and the large majority of even the soundest of them were\r\nobliged eventually, owing to the heavy withdrawal of deposits, to close\r\ntheir doors.  Though some have since been re-opened, upon terms agreed\r\nto between the shareholders and depositors, their business has\r\ncollapsed for the time, the amount of advances in Victoria having\r\nfallen from over two millions in 1890 and in 1891 to less than a\r\nhundred thousand pounds in 1893.[7]  In the apparent absence of\r\nstatistics of the number of freeholders in several Provinces, no\r\ngeneral idea can be formed of the extent to which the working classes\r\nhave, through Building Societies and otherwise, invested their savings\r\nin the acquisition of {261} freehold properties.  The only figures that\r\nI have been able to obtain give the estimated number of owners as\r\n30,600, 91,500, and 184,500 for New South Wales, New Zealand, and\r\nVictoria respectively.  As far as the two latter Provinces are\r\nconcerned, the total populations being only 699,000 and 1,174,000, it\r\nis absurd to suppose that the electors, a large proportion of whom are\r\nfreeholders, will be captivated by the advocates of the Single Tax.  It\r\ncannot too often be repeated that the Australasian Governments, all of\r\nwhich are, to a greater or lesser degree, aiming at the multiplication\r\nof small owners or perpetual lease-holders, are rendering it\r\npractically impossible that an agitation for the confiscation of land\r\nvalues should be successful, and are fostering the growth of that class\r\nof settlers which is believed to be Conservative in the best sense of\r\nthe word.  But large estates, except in the case of certain kinds of\r\npastoral land, are doomed to extinction, either in the natural course\r\nof events, owing to the costliness of labour, or from the pressure of\r\nheavy graduated taxation, the workmen of Australasia being thoroughly\r\nconvinced of its justice as a means of raising revenue and of its\r\nefficacy as a means of causing land to be subdivided or placed upon the\r\nmarket.  They have also, as has been seen, supported legislation which\r\nhas authorised the re-purchase and subdivision of landed estates.\r\n\r\n{262}\r\n\r\nLastly, they have realised since 1890 that, for the furtherance of\r\ntheir aspirations, the strength of their Unions should be devoted\r\nmainly to the promotion of the representation of Labour in Parliament.\r\nThe great strike of that year has been described so fully that it is\r\nunnecessary to say more than that a strong combination of labour, which\r\nhad made itself master of the situation, was confronted upon the\r\noutbreak of hostilities by rapidly organised but powerful associations\r\nof employers; that the struggle, which spread over the whole Continent\r\nand New Zealand, terminated in the success of the latter, and that the\r\nworkmen realised that, even had they succeeded, the victory would have\r\nbeen won at too heavy a cost in the misery entailed upon themselves and\r\ntheir families.  Many of them were dissatisfied with the generalship of\r\ntheir leaders during the strike, and realised that the exhaustion of\r\ntheir funds rendered them unable to engage again in a huge industrial\r\nstruggle.  In the following years low prices, the financial crisis, and\r\nthe consequent scarcity of employment and fall in wages, further\r\nweakened the Unions and intensified the conviction that strikes should\r\nbe superseded by the ballot-box.  In some Provinces, also, it was felt\r\nthat the rivalry of parties had degenerated into a contest between the\r\nins and the outs, and that progressive measures would not be passed\r\nuntil Labour had entered as a compact body into the arena.\r\n\r\nI have discussed in the earlier chapters the {263} history and results\r\nof Labour representation in several of the Provinces, and have shown\r\nthat the Labour Party has been successful in South Australia, where it\r\nhas formed an alliance with the Government, though maintaining a\r\nseparate organisation, and in New South Wales, where it has held the\r\nbalance of power between the Protectionists and Free Traders, but has\r\nfailed utterly in Queensland, where mainly through its own fault, but\r\npartly through the astuteness of its opponents, it has occupied a\r\nposition of antagonism to all the vested interests of the community.\r\nIn Victoria the Labour Party acts usually with the Government, but\r\nseeks to obtain its objects by the exercise of its strength more than\r\nby friendly negotiations.  In New Zealand no distinct Party was formed,\r\nbut the working-men representatives threw in their lot with the\r\nGovernment and, by consistent support, helped to secure the imposition\r\nof graduated taxation and the enactment, among other measures, of a\r\ncompulsory Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and of a large number of\r\nIndustrial Statutes.\r\n\r\nA great similarity of aims and aspirations can be traced between the\r\ndifferent Labour Parties if we ignore side issues and exclude that of\r\nQueensland, which is affected by the taint of aggressive socialism.\r\nJudging from the respective programmes and from conversations which I\r\nhave had with many of the leaders, I find that, subject to certain\r\nexceptions {264} which I shall mention, they are united upon the\r\nfollowing propositions:--\r\n\r\n\r\nManhood or adult suffrage, shorn of the plural vote, should be the\r\nbasis of representation in the Assembly.  The Legislative Council\r\nshould be abolished, as it prevents the wishes of the people from being\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\nDirect taxation should consist of graduated death duties and graduated\r\ntaxes on incomes and land values.\r\n\r\nParliament should secure to every worker for wages sanitary and safe\r\nconditions of employment, and immunity from excessive hours of labour.\r\n\r\nMachinery should be provided by Parliament by which industrial disputes\r\nmay be referred to an impartial tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe workers should protect themselves not only against foreign goods,\r\nbut against undesirable immigrants, whether they be Orientals or\r\nindigent Europeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consideration of these questions, and of the wider issues with\r\nwhich they are concerned, will cover most of the points of recent\r\ninterest in Australasian politics.\r\n\r\n(1) It is doubtful whether Responsible Government, in the sense of\r\ngovernment by a Ministry which carries out a definite policy approved\r\nby the country, and, in return, receives allegiance from its {265}\r\nsupporters in Parliament, has ever been acclimatised in Australasia\r\nexcept in New South Wales under the influence of the late Sir Henry\r\nParkes.  How, indeed, could it be otherwise, when it was sought to\r\ntransplant a delicate system, hallowed by conventions and dependent for\r\nits success upon the election of a special class of representatives,\r\namong a community necessarily ruled by men who had little experience of\r\npublic life?  Australian Parliaments, save on the rare occasions when\r\nsome important issue, such as that of the tariff, has come to the\r\nfront, have not been divided on ordinary party lines, and have amused\r\nthemselves with the excitement of a constant succession of new\r\nMinistries selected on personal and not on political considerations.\r\nNew South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, to take three Provinces\r\nat random, have had, respectively, 28, 42, and 26 Ministries in 40\r\nyears.  The policy of the Opposition has often been almost identical\r\nwith that of the Government.  Again, coalitions between former\r\nopponents have been of frequent occurrence; the Ministries formed by\r\nMessrs. Deakin and Gillies in Victoria, and by Sir Samuel Griffith and\r\nSir Thomas McIlwraith in Queensland, are recent instances of this\r\ntendency.  In some rural constituencies, also, candidates appeal to the\r\nelectorate on personal grounds and are not required to declare their\r\nadhesion to a party.  I was struck, when present at the elections in\r\nSouth Australia and New Zealand, by the subsequent animated discussions\r\nin {266} the newspapers as to the probable effect of the changes in the\r\npersonnel of the Members upon the prospects of the Government.  This is\r\nthe more noticeable from the fact that the freedom of action allowed to\r\nrepresentatives has been curtailed since the return to Parliament of\r\nLabour Members, who are pledged to a definite programme and have put\r\nforward questions on which there is a distinct line of cleavage.\r\nProposals for the extension of the franchise, for the abolition of the\r\nplural vote, or for the imposition of a tax on incomes and land values,\r\nare such as divide the electorate into two camps and perpetuate the\r\ndivision in the House.  This state of things, combined, perhaps, with\r\nthe financial crisis which raised problems demanding continuity of\r\nadministration for their solution, has contributed to the greater\r\nstability of Ministries.  Another factor, which has given\r\nconstituencies a greater hold on their representatives, and has tended\r\nthereby to make them adhere more closely to one or other of the\r\nparties, is the payment of Members, which has now been adopted in all\r\nthe Lower Houses except that of Western Australia, and in the Upper\r\nHouses of South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.  Australia has\r\nbeen confronted with the difficulty experienced by every young country,\r\nthat the men who should naturally enter Parliament are prevented by\r\ncommercial or professional duties from devoting the necessary time, and\r\nthat, in the absence of men of leisure, constituencies {267} are much\r\nhampered in their choice of candidates.  The payment of Members, it is\r\nneedless to say, offers no inducement to the successful merchant or\r\nlawyer, but has increased the competition among men to whom the salary\r\nis an inducement.  My inquiries as to its effect upon the tone of\r\npoliticians have elicited mutually contradictory replies.  On the one\r\nhand I am assured that the attractions of the salary have led men to\r\nresort to disreputable practices in order to be selected as candidates\r\nand to seek to retain the fickle affections of their constituents by\r\nsimilar means; on the other, that necessitous Members have been raised\r\nby the salary above temptations which their poverty made it difficult\r\nfor them to resist; and such temptations must increase in number with\r\neach extension of the functions of the State unless it be dissociated\r\nfrom political influence.  It is clear that a knowledge of the inner\r\nlife of a Parliament could alone supply materials for the adequate\r\ndiscussion of this question, and that a similar consideration applies\r\nto the discussion of the effects of State socialism upon political\r\nmorality.  The possible abuses are many: railways may be constructed\r\nwith a view to popularity; the rents of Crown tenants may be remitted,\r\nand borrowers may be allowed to fall in arrears with the interest on\r\ntheir advances; subsidies and bonuses voted by Parliament may be\r\nmisapplied; and the unemployed may be conciliated by unnecessary public\r\nworks.  Personal corruption, I am confident, {268} does not exist, but\r\nthat safeguards have been felt to be necessary is proved by the\r\nappointment of independent Railway Commissioners by New South Wales,\r\nVictoria, South Australia, Queensland, and New Zealand, and of Public\r\nWorks Committees by Victoria and New South Wales.  In the latter\r\ncountry, as has been seen, the Commissioners have been most successful,\r\nbut New Zealand has reverted to the system of political control, and\r\nVictoria, Queensland, and South Australia have reduced the number of\r\nCommissioners from three to one.  This change, which must have lessened\r\nthe efficacy of non-political control, was advocated on grounds of\r\neconomy at a time when all forms of expenditure were being cut down to\r\nthe lowest point.  In Victoria the Leongatha Labour Settlement has\r\ndiminished the difficulties connected with the unemployed, and its\r\nadministration has been studied by the other Provinces with a view to\r\nsimilar action.  The general political tone is healthy, and is\r\nstimulated, in all the Provinces, by a high-class press, which uses its\r\ngreat influence in a conscientious manner.  But, as long as Treasurers\r\ncan balance their accounts by recourse to loans, and are tempted, as is\r\ninevitable, to apply borrowed money to placatory enterprises, the\r\ndangers which are necessarily connected with State socialism are\r\nmultiplied tenfold.  They would be lessened if the objects for which\r\nloans might be contracted were defined, as has been suggested, by Act\r\nof Parliament, {269} or if Federation were to eventuate at an early\r\ndate and the right to borrow were limited to the Federal Authority.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand alone have I found direct evidence of the misuse of\r\npolitical patronage.  Upon the third reading of the Appropriation Bill\r\nin 1896, Captain Russell, the Leader of the Opposition, made use of the\r\nfollowing words: \"I maintain that for years past the administration of\r\nthe Government has been anything but good.  They have hunted for\r\npopularity and they have hunted their enemies.  They have hunted their\r\nenemies to a very great extent.  You find positions which were capably\r\nfilled by old and valued servants now filled by friends of the\r\nGovernment.  We have a system of espionage in existence which is\r\ndisgusting....  The Civil Servants should not depend on the favour and\r\ntheir popularity with Ministers for promotion, but rather on good\r\nhonest service, and that is not the case now.  Why, a Civil Servant\r\ndare not come and speak to an Opposition Member for fear of that fact\r\nbeing reported to the Ministers.  (An Hon. Member: No!)  It is all very\r\nwell to say 'No,' but I am acquainted with dozens of Civil Servants in\r\nWellington, and they will not come and speak to me in the street for\r\nfear of being reported.\"[8]  In his reply the Premier made no attempt\r\nto meet these charges, which I have quoted because I have gathered\r\ncorroborative {270} evidence in different parts of the country, though\r\nit is not such as admits of being adduced as definite proof, and\r\nbecause the Minister of Lands made an exceedingly candid admission\r\nshortly after the elections.  In the course of a speech delivered at\r\nGeraldine he is reported by a Ministerial newspaper to have said: \"They\r\nhad endeavoured during their term of office to do what they could in\r\nthe interests of the Colony as a whole, but they had been very badly\r\ntreated by two classes of the public at the elections.  In the session\r\nof 1895, they would remember, the Government passed a measure to give\r\nrelief to pastoral Crown tenants who lost a large number of sheep in\r\nthe snow.  The Government did this in the interest of the people as a\r\nwhole, as they thought, but how had they been treated by the people\r\nthey helped in time of distress?  (A voice: Very badly.)  Yes, there\r\nmight have been one or two exceptions, but generally speaking they\r\nfought tooth and nail against the Government.  Then, again, the\r\nGovernment saved the Bank of New Zealand and the Colony from ruin, but\r\nstill the old leaven of the Bank fought and voted against the\r\nGovernment at the elections.  He considered this very unfair on their\r\npart, considering what the Government had done for them.\"[9]  Sir\r\nRobert Stout, a former Premier of New Zealand, has also brought a grave\r\nindictment against the Government, from {271} which I quote the portion\r\nreferring to appointments:--\r\n\r\n\"By the Statute Law of New Zealand, no one who has been a member of\r\neither House can be appointed to any position in the Civil Service\r\nuntil he has for twelve months ceased to be a member of Parliament.  A\r\nvacancy occurred in the position of Sergeant-at-arms, and it was\r\nannounced that an ex-member, who had at the elections retired in favour\r\nof a Ministerial candidate, had received the office.  When Parliament\r\nmet, the appointment gave rise to much discussion.  Ultimately a large\r\nmajority supported the Ministry in conferring the appointment\r\ntemporarily, the official appointment to be made at the end of twelve\r\nmonths.  If this had been the only flagrant violation of the law it\r\nmight have been overlooked; but it is only a type of what has been\r\ndone.  The Civil Service Reform Act, 1886, provides that no one, save\r\nan expert, can be appointed to the Civil Service unless he enters as a\r\ncadet.  Some departments, such as the railway, postal, and telegraph\r\ndepartments, are exempted from the provisions of the Act.  The cadets\r\nmust obtain their positions by competition; the examination is annual.\r\nThe Ministry, however, appointed some cadets out of their order, and\r\nsome who had never even submitted to an examination at all.  There is a\r\nprovision for \"temporary\" clerks.  When vacancies arise in the service\r\nthese are given to {272} temporary clerks.  The policy of \"spoils for\r\nthe victors\" has been openly defended.  To carry out this pernicious\r\nsystem the law has been violated.  It has been said that only those of\r\nthe 'right colour' of political opinions should receive appointments in\r\nthe Civil Service.\"[10]\r\n\r\nHowever great may be one's sympathy with the efforts of the Government\r\nto encourage settlement and to promote industrial conciliation and\r\narbitration, one cannot but rejoice at the increased strength of the\r\nOpposition, which will be sufficient to enforce greater purity of\r\nadministration and the enactment of legislation which will prevent a\r\nrecurrence of the evil.\r\n\r\nThe realisation of the dangers of an unmuzzled democracy has caused a\r\nwidespread anxiety which has been displayed in vehement but, for the\r\nmost part, unsuccessful opposition to proposed changes in the\r\nconstitution of the Assembly.  New Zealand and South Australia have\r\nadopted adult suffrage, coupled with the abolition of plural voting;\r\nVictoria and New South Wales manhood suffrage, associated in the former\r\ncase with the plural vote but not in the latter.  In Victoria, the\r\nConservatives, if I may so characterise the less-advanced party, have\r\nput forward a proposal which is unique in Australasia.  They suggest\r\nthat, while each man should continue to have a vote, the present plural\r\nvotes should be replaced by a second vote which {273} should be\r\npossessed equally by all freeholders whatever be the size and number of\r\ntheir properties.  They believe that they would thereby place the power\r\nin the hands of the more stable elements of the population, and that\r\nthey are not unlikely to be supported by the freeholders, who\r\nconstitute nearly two-thirds of the electors on the rolls for the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nAt present the Labour parties are engaged in onslaughts upon the\r\nLegislative Councils with a view to their ultimate abolition, but are\r\nprepared to accept, as an instalment, any proposals which would cripple\r\ntheir power.  They concurred heartily with the Bill introduced in 1896\r\nby the Government of New South Wales and rejected by the Council after\r\nit had been passed by large majorities through the Assembly, which\r\nprovided for the reference to a popular vote of matters in dispute\r\nbetween the two Houses.  Similar measures are also advocated by the\r\nGovernments of Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania; while in New\r\nZealand, it is proposed that deadlocks shall be obviated by a joint\r\nsession of both Houses, which shall sit as one Chamber.  It may be that\r\nan Act of 1891 which, as will be seen, tends to popularise the\r\nLegislative Council in New Zealand will account for the less drastic\r\ncharacter of the solution put forward in that Province.  It is probable\r\nthat it will become customary in Australasia to submit distinct issues\r\nto the electorate, on a separate ballot-paper, at the time of a general\r\n{274} election.  The Government of South Australia ascertained in this\r\nmanner the popular wishes in regard to religious instruction in State\r\nschools, and the payment to denominational schools of a capitation\r\ngrant for secular results; and the recent \"Alcoholic Liquors Sale\r\nControl Act\" of New Zealand provides that Local Option polls shall be\r\ntaken concurrently with the election of representatives.  Under\r\nreferences similar to that in South Australia, it may be objected,\r\nMinisters may be supported on their general policy, but be required to\r\nintroduce a measure to which they are opposed.  Such a position,\r\nhowever, would not apparently be regarded as inconsistent, as most of\r\nthe candidates in South Australia stated their willingness to give\r\neffect to the popular vote, in whatever direction it might be\r\nexpressed.  Disputes between the two Houses will, I believe, be decided\r\nsimilarly, on the score of the expense of a special poll, unless the\r\nissue be such as to demand an immediate settlement.\r\n\r\nThe first line of attack of the Labour Members is thus seen to be an\r\nagitation which aims at enabling the electorate of the Assembly to\r\noverride the Council; the second is directed at its Conservative\r\ntendencies.  The policy pursued depends upon the constitution of the\r\nCouncil: if it is elective, it should be so modified as to become a\r\nChamber of paid representatives, subject to no property qualification\r\nand elected upon a wide franchise, such as the South Australian\r\nCouncil, in which a combination {275} of Ministerialists and Labour\r\nMembers has been able to obtain a bare majority.  If it is nominated,\r\nthe life tenure should be superseded by nomination for a short term of\r\nyears, which will enable successive Ministries to introduce a new\r\nleaven of persons who are in touch with popular feeling, and will be\r\nprevented, by the limit placed upon the duration of their appointments,\r\nfrom being subjected to reactionary influences.  The Council, that is\r\nto say, is to become a mere machine for registering the wishes of the\r\nAssembly.  The only success which has hitherto attended this agitation\r\nis the enactment in 1891 of a measure in New Zealand which limited to\r\nseven years the duration of subsequent appointments; but the Government\r\nnow desire to abolish the life tenure, and they are followed herein by\r\nNew South Wales, by providing for the gradual retirement of all the\r\nmembers who hold their seats for life.  They also propose, whether\r\nseriously or in order to cast ridicule upon the Council, that women\r\nshall be eligible for appointment to that body.  In regard to the\r\ngeneral position of the nominated Councils, which are not limited as to\r\nthe number of their members, it may be stated that the Imperial\r\nGovernment decided, upon a case submitted to them from New Zealand,\r\nthat the Governor should accept the recommendations of his\r\nconstitutional advisers in the matter of additional appointments.\r\nStrangely enough, the Premier of Queensland, the only other\r\nAustralasian Province that has a nominated Legislative {276} Council,\r\nthough a strong constitutionalist, aimed a blow at its prestige in a\r\nproposal, which he carried through the Assembly but not through the\r\nCouncil, that the former House alone should be vested with the power of\r\nselecting the delegates to the pending Federal Convention.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this portion of the subject, I must mention that other\r\nproposals affecting the form of Government of the Provinces have been\r\ndiscussed in Parliament and are likely to attract serious attention.\r\nTheoretically, indeed, it has been asserted, apart from the question of\r\nthe power of the Upper Houses, and the point is of interest as showing\r\nthe ideas germinating in the minds of Australasian politicians, that\r\nfive changes are required in order that the Parliamentary machinery may\r\nbe brought into proper relations with the people: the election of\r\nMinisters by the Assembly; continuity of representation in the\r\nAssembly, to be secured by the division of the country into\r\nconstituencies returning two representatives who retire alternately at\r\nfixed periods; the Swiss form of Initiative and Referendum; and the\r\nright of a certain proportion of the members to convoke a special\r\nsession of Parliament, and of an absolute majority of the electors in a\r\nconstituency to require the resignation of their member.  The first and\r\nsecond of these reforms, as I have shown, are included in the programme\r\nof the Ministry of South Australia, which, however, in spite of its\r\nsuccess at the polls, has not pressed them forward {277} during the\r\nfirst session of the New Parliament.  Continuity of representation\r\ncould easily be arranged, as all the constituencies return two members.\r\nAn Elective Executive Bill has been introduced in the House of\r\nRepresentatives in New Zealand and received a large measure of support,\r\nthough it was opposed by the Premier and the leader of the Opposition.\r\nThe idea has taken a strong hold upon the imagination of the Labour\r\nMembers in all the Provinces.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that I have laid stress upon a variety of fantastic\r\ntheories, but the objection takes insufficient account of the facility\r\nwith which changes can be effected in the absence of a strong force of\r\ntraditional conservatism.  I must admit, as a failing of Australasian\r\npoliticians, that they are inclined to welcome innovations which are\r\nsuperficially attractive, without due consideration of the ulterior\r\nconsequences.  To quote an extreme case, the Government of New Zealand\r\nproposed, in a Single Bill, not only to abolish the life tenure of\r\nMembers of the Legislative Council, but to provide machinery for the\r\nsettlement of disputes between the two Houses and to establish a\r\nmodified form of the Swiss Referendum.  But I am confident that several\r\nof the proposals to which I have referred, notably that for an Elective\r\nExecutive, meet with a large measure of support in the constituencies.\r\nThis movement has gathered strength from the disinclination of\r\nMinistries to resign except upon a {278} direct vote of want of\r\nconfidence.  Some of them look with equanimity upon the defeat of\r\ncardinal principles of important Bills, whether it be due to the\r\nstrength of the Opposition or the defection of their own followers, and\r\ndo not hesitate, if sufficient pressure be exercised, to withdraw them\r\naltogether.  As the Ministry tends, therefore, to become a body which\r\ncarries out the wishes of the whole House, and ceases to lead its own\r\nParty, the position would be simplified if the whole House elected the\r\nExecutive for a fixed period.  Another argument is found in the\r\nincreasing desire of the Assembly to shift its legislative duties to\r\nthe shoulders of the Executive.  Parliament decides the broad\r\nprinciples of measures and leaves the details to be filled in by\r\nRegulations made by the Department concerned under the supervision of\r\nthe Minister and with the approval of the Executive Council.\r\n\r\n(2) Graduated death duties are imposed in all the seven Provinces,\r\nthough in Tasmania the tax levied on the largest properties does not\r\nexceed 3 per cent.  Western Australia came into line with the other\r\nProvinces in 1895, when a Bill imposing graduation up to 10 per cent.\r\nwas passed, almost without discussion, through both Houses of\r\nParliament.  The Premier admitted that it had not been rendered\r\nnecessary by the condition of the finances, but contended that it\r\nshould be placed upon the Statute Book while there were few rich men in\r\nthe community who would resent it.\r\n\r\n{279}\r\n\r\nOther forms of direct taxation are as follows: New Zealand, South\r\nAustralia, and New South Wales have taxation on incomes and land\r\nvalues, the two former with, the latter without, graduation; Victoria\r\nhas a graduated income tax and an ungraduated land tax on estates above\r\na certain value; Tasmania, an ungraduated tax on incomes and the\r\ncapital value of land; Queensland, an ungraduated income tax, which is\r\nonly collected on dividends paid by public companies.  The taxation in\r\nNew South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand, and South Australia has been\r\npromoted, if not inspired, by the Labour Movement in Parliament, and\r\nconstitutes its greatest triumph.  In Victoria the taxation of land\r\nvalues was rejected by the Legislative Council.\r\n\r\nA point of interest is the distinction made by Victoria, Tasmania, and\r\nSouth Australia between incomes derived from property and those which\r\nare the result of personal exertion.  It is thought to be equitable\r\nthat the former should be taxed at a higher rate, and the principle is\r\nsimilar to that which dictates the taxation of land upon its unimproved\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n(3) I have referred very briefly in the present chapter to certain\r\nforms of industrial legislation; speaking generally, they are based\r\nupon English examples and do not call for any particular comment.  The\r\nLabour Parties are keenly interested in these matters because it is\r\nsimpler, apart from greater efficacy, that inspectors should protect\r\ntheir {280} interest under Acts of Parliament than that they should be\r\ncompelled constantly to engage in negotiations with individual\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n(4) As I have already pointed out, the consideration of Australasian\r\nproblems must be accompanied by a recollection of the difference of\r\nconditions from those existing in Great Britain.  Even in the latter\r\ncountry it is obvious that the intimate relations between employers and\r\nemployed are being replaced, especially in the manufacturing centres,\r\nby a purely monetary bond; but they can never, except in individual\r\ncases, have had any existence in Australasia, where capitalists and\r\nworkmen have approached each other and entered into agreements as\r\nstrangers.  Consequently the workmen, attached neither to people nor\r\nplaces, have been prepared to move as their varying interests have\r\nsuggested and have formed few lasting ties with their employers.  Many\r\nof the industries, indeed, have tended to accentuate this absence of\r\ncordial relations: in pastoralism, for instance, the small permanent\r\nstaff is supplemented for a few weeks in the year by a large number of\r\nshearers and others, who sign a definite agreement with their\r\nemployers, and, provided that the conditions are carried out, can have\r\nno interest either in them or in their properties.  Incidentally, an\r\nassociation recently formed at Sydney which engages shearers and\r\nprovides them with consecutive employment at different sheds, should\r\nnot only be a financial success, but allay the {281} natural\r\ndissatisfaction of a body of men who, though they earn high wages, can\r\ndepend upon neither regularity nor permanency in their work.  I could\r\nshow that similar conditions prevail in the sugar industry and, to some\r\nextent, in agriculture; but enough has been said to prove that the\r\nworking classes are differently situated from those in older countries\r\nand partially to explain their willingness to form themselves into\r\nTrades Unions and the combativeness of these organisations.\r\n\r\nThe great maritime strike, though it has been followed by the Broken\r\nHill strikes of 1891 and 1892, the shearers' strikes of 1891 and 1894,\r\nand periodical hostilities at Newcastle, has modified largely the\r\nattitude of the working classes in regard to the efficacy of industrial\r\nwarfare.  The later struggles have principally affected Queensland and\r\nNew South Wales, which was the first of the Provinces to attempt to\r\ndeal with the matter by Act of Parliament.  A Board of Conciliation was\r\nestablished upon the recommendation of a Royal Commission, but is\r\nadmitted to have been a failure in the absence of any compulsory\r\nreference of disputes.  On the occasion of the most recent\r\ndisturbances, at Newcastle in 1896, which originated upon an\r\napplication of the miners for higher wages, the Premier, following\r\nEnglish precedents, intervened, and was enabled to settle the dispute,\r\nthough not until the strike had lasted for three months and had caused\r\nmuch of the foreign trade to be diverted to foreign ports.  Actual\r\n{282} and prospective losses caused the owners, though they made a\r\nsmall concession at the request of the Premier, to refuse to reinstate\r\nthe miners except at a slightly lower rate of wages than that against\r\nwhich they had struck.  The offer, as modified by the Premier, was\r\naccepted by the miners, who had thus, at the cost of much misery,\r\nbrought about a reduction in their wages.  The disturbances of 1894 in\r\nQueensland, which reached an acute stage, were met by the Government by\r\nresolute administration under special powers obtained by Act of\r\nParliament, but no attempt was made to intervene between the disputants\r\nor to make use of the Conciliation Act of 1892, which, as far as I\r\nknow, has remained a dead letter.  It is useless, therefore, to discuss\r\nthe Act further than to say that its machinery can only be set in\r\nmotion by a Local Authority, but it may not be unfair to attribute the\r\nunsympathetic attitude of the Government to the bitterness engendered\r\nby the extravagances of the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nIn most of the Provinces neither the employers nor the workmen are\r\nprepared, as yet, to bind themselves to refer their disputes to an\r\nimpartial tribunal and to abide by its decision.  Though the tendency\r\nin that direction is on the increase, it has been suggested that, in\r\nthe meanwhile, Boards should be constituted which would be empowered to\r\nconsider disputes, and, after the examination of books and witnesses,\r\nto issue a public report.  The judgment would not be enforceable, but\r\nmight be expected, in {283} the majority of cases, to lead to a\r\nsettlement of the difficulty; at any rate, it would influence public\r\nopinion, which is a large factor in all industrial struggles.  But\r\nSouth Australia and New Zealand have passed this stage, and have placed\r\ndrastic measures on their Statute Book which provide, in certain cases,\r\nfor compulsory awards.  The compulsory provisions of the South\r\nAustralian Act apply only to employers and workmen who are organised\r\nand have voluntarily accepted them by the process of registration.\r\nShould they become involved in an industrial dispute, the Governor may,\r\nupon the recommendation of the President of the State Board of\r\nConciliation, cause the matter to be referred to it, and the Board may\r\nmake an award which will be binding upon the parties concerned.  In New\r\nZealand, on the other hand, while the proceedings must be initiated by\r\nemployers or workmen who are registered, the other party, though\r\nunregistered, may be called upon, should the Board of Conciliation fail\r\nto effect a settlement, to attend before the Court of Arbitration and\r\nto obey its award, subject to the general proviso that an employer may\r\nsuspend or discontinue any industry and an employe cease from working\r\ntherein.  In neither Province is a strike or lock-out permitted during\r\nthe deliberations of the tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe Acts do not apply to unorganised workers, except indirectly, partly\r\nbecause they have not been the cause of the great industrial struggles\r\nof the past, {284} partly because it would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to enforce awards against them.  It may also have been\r\nthought that they would be encouraged thereby to form themselves into\r\nUnions, and that the best chance of industrial peace lies in\r\nnegotiations between responsible bodies of workers and employers who\r\nwill have too much at stake to be willing to proceed thoughtlessly to\r\nextremities.  As regards registration, it has been found that the\r\nworkers of South Australia, though their leaders had supported the\r\ncompulsory provisions, have been backward in this direction; but that,\r\nin New Zealand, no such hesitation has been displayed.  The workers in\r\nthat country do not appear to share the disinclination to agree to the\r\nintervention of an arbitrator which is stated to be increasing in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nIn South Australia, to give a brief account of the new tribunals,\r\nBoards of Conciliation may be either Private Boards, constituted under\r\nindustrial agreements and endowed with such jurisdiction as may be\r\nconfided to them in the agreements; or Public Boards, which include\r\nLocal Boards constituted for particular localities and particular\r\nindustries, and the State Board of Conciliation.  In New Zealand, the\r\nfirst reference is to an elective Board of Conciliation constituted for\r\nthe district in which the dispute has occurred.  Should it fail to\r\neffect a settlement, the matter may be referred to the Court of\r\nArbitration, which, similarly with the State Board {285} of\r\nConciliation in South Australia, consists of an equal number of\r\nrepresentatives of employers and employed and a chairman nominated by\r\nthe Government, who must, in the former country, be a judge of the\r\nSupreme Court.  These tribunals are invested with full powers to\r\nrequire the attendance and examination of witnesses, and may either\r\nmake an award which shall take effect for a period not exceeding two\r\nyears, and may be enforced by legal process against associations and\r\nindividuals, or they may confine themselves, at their discretion, to a\r\nrecommendation which will be merely a direction to the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nIn South Australia the State Board has also the power to inquire into,\r\nand report upon, industrial disputes, though the parties be not\r\nregistered.  This portion of the Act has alone been brought into\r\noperation, and that unsuccessfully, as, though the representatives of\r\nemployers and employed on the Board arrived at a unanimous decision\r\nupon a dispute affecting the rate of wages, the employer in question\r\nrefused to be guided by its judgment.  The general failure of the Act,\r\nthough the affirmation of the principle of Conciliation has been\r\nvaluable, has been due partly to the absence of serious disputes in\r\nSouth Australia, but principally to the unwillingness both of employers\r\nand employed to place themselves in a position in which they will lose\r\ncontrol over the terms of employment.\r\n\r\nThe Act passed by the Government of New {286} Zealand, on the contrary,\r\nhas hitherto been entirely efficacious, and has prevented the\r\ninterruption of harmonious relations between employers and employed.\r\nIt was first tested upon a dispute which arose over the action of the\r\nConsolidated Goldfields Company in reducing wages in the mines from\r\n10s. to 8s. 4d. per day.  The men, who were not members of a union,\r\nwent out on strike, and were then offered wages at the rate of 9s.\r\nUpon the advice of their leaders, the men accepted the offer\r\nprovisionally; and, having formed themselves into a union which they\r\npromptly caused to be registered, referred the matter to the Board of\r\nConciliation.  The decision of the Board, which it is unnecessary to\r\nspecify, was refused by the men, who appealed to the Court of\r\nArbitration.  The award of the latter body, which fixed the wages of\r\nminers at 9s. 6d. per day, a rate smaller than that which had been\r\nreceived by the men, but larger than that against which they had\r\nprotested, has been observed loyally by the Company and its employes.\r\n\r\nThe next dispute arose at Christchurch upon the expiration of the\r\nagreement which had been in operation between the boot manufacturers\r\nand their workmen for several years, and upon the desire of the former\r\nto substitute new terms which were regarded as distasteful.  It was\r\nconcerned with several matters of detail, but hinged principally upon\r\nthe question whether non-unionists should be allowed to work with\r\nunionists.  As in the {287} former case, an appeal was made from the\r\nBoard of Conciliation's award to the Court of Arbitration, whose\r\ndecision, it is noteworthy, both sides had signified their willingness\r\nto accept.  The award applied to all the bootmakers in the Province\r\nwith the exception of three or four who were not identified with the\r\nboot manufacturers' association, and was accompanied by remarks\r\npronounced, it must be remembered, by a judge of the Supreme Court,\r\nwhich cannot fail to be of interest to the Trades Unionists in all\r\nparts of the world.  I do not, therefore, apologise for quoting them at\r\nlength:--\r\n\r\n\"The Arbitration Court has not hitherto been in the habit of giving\r\nreasons for its decision.  It appears to the Court that, sitting as\r\narbitrators, it should as a general rule follow the ordinary practice\r\nof arbitrators and simply give its decision without reasons.  In the\r\npresent case, however, so far as I myself am concerned, I think it is\r\ndesirable that I should, with respect to part of the award, give some\r\nindications of the reasons which have induced the Court to arrive at\r\nits conclusion.  The part of the award to which I refer is that which\r\nrelates to clauses 1 and 2 of the general rules which the\r\nManufacturers' Association has submitted to the Court: '1. (_a_) It is\r\nthe individual right of the employer to decide whom he shall employ or\r\ndismiss.  (_b_) It is the individual right of the workman to accept or\r\nrefuse work from any employer.  {288} 2. Employers or employes, either\r\nindividually or through any organisation, shall not discriminate for or\r\nagainst any person because he is or is not a member of any\r\norganisation, neither shall there be any distinction between organised\r\nor non-organised labour; both shall work under the same conditions and\r\nreceive equal pay for equal work.'  The Bootmakers' Union, in\r\nopposition to the rules so suggested, put forward the contention that\r\nemployment should be limited to members of the Bootmakers' Union.  The\r\nCourt, however, is not able to accept the extreme view which has been\r\nput forward by the Bootmakers' Union.  If it were accepted it might\r\nfollow that an employer, who had work to do and who could not get Union\r\nmen to do it, might have to bring his operations to a standstill.  The\r\neffect of it also would be that non-Union men would be absolutely\r\nprevented from earning their living in the workshops of the members of\r\nthe Manufacturers' Association.  That, so far as I am concerned, seems\r\nto be going beyond what the Court ought to decree.  On the other hand,\r\nhowever, I am not prepared to accept absolutely clauses 1 and 2 in the\r\nform in which the Manufacturers' Association has put them forward.  The\r\nCourt ought, I think, to comply with the intention of the Legislature\r\nas evidenced in the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and\r\nArbitration Act, and ought not to do anything which is calculated to\r\ndestroy or weaken any industrial organisation.  The {289} intention of\r\nthe Act is indicated in its title--the Act is an Act to encourage the\r\nformation of Industrial Unions and Associations.  The Court, therefore,\r\nought not to do anything which will tend to destroy or weaken an\r\nindustrial association, or interfere with the manifest intention of the\r\nLegislature as disclosed by the Act.  We have this also, that for the\r\nlast three years the shops of the Manufacturers' Association have been\r\npractically working as Union shops.  It is true that manufacturers\r\nsay--probably with truth--that they were so worked because they could\r\nnot help it, but the fact remains that they have been working in that\r\nway, and the proposed new rules, as put forward by the manufacturers,\r\nexpressly reverse the previous mode of working.  We have this also,\r\nthat the previous statement was a statement agreed to between the\r\nManufacturers' Association and the Bootmakers' Union, the conference\r\nwhich followed the statement was between the Association and the Union,\r\nand the dispute now before the Court is between the Association and the\r\nUnion.  It is only by means of Unions that labour can take advantage of\r\nthe Act.  Under these circumstances, it seems to me not unreasonable\r\nthat the Union should stipulate for special privileges to its members.\r\nThe Union are fighting the battle, and it is fair that they should say\r\nthat the results of the victory, so far as it is a victory, and has any\r\nbeneficial results, should accrue to them, at any rate in the first\r\ninstance.  They fight {290} the battle for their members, and not for\r\nthe sake of outside labour.  Under these circumstances it appears to me\r\nthat it is quite reasonable that the members of the Union should have\r\npreference in employment; that members of the Union who are competent\r\nshould not have to wait about while non-members of the Union are\r\nemployed in the shops of the Boot Manufacturers' Association.  The\r\nCourt, therefore, has modified Rules 1 and 2 in this direction.  I need\r\nhardly say that each case to be decided under this Act must depend on\r\nthe particular circumstances attaching to it; that no one case can be\r\ntreated as a precedent to any future case, and that because under the\r\nparticular circumstances of a particular case, this Court has decided\r\nas it has decided, that is no reason why, under different or varying\r\ncircumstances, a similar decision ought to be come to.  The Court in\r\ncoming to its decision, takes into consideration not general principles\r\nso much as the special circumstances of each particular case.\"\r\n\r\nThe award, which modified the regulations on the lines laid down by the\r\nCourt, is regarded as a great triumph by Trade Unionists, who are, not\r\nunnaturally, inclined to apply it as a precedent to all organised\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nA possible exemplification of the efficacy of the Act occurred at the\r\nend of 1896, when the engineers employed in the Australian trade of the\r\nUnion Steamship Company of New Zealand asked that {291} their wages\r\nmight be raised to the rate which had prevailed before the financial\r\ntroubles.  They took advantage of the increased traffic caused by the\r\nholidays in order to emphasise their demands.  The engineers of the\r\nships plying in New Zealand waters made a similar request, which was at\r\nonce acceded to by the Company, but did not attempt to exert undue\r\npressure.  I am not prepared to state that the difference in attitude\r\nwas due to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of the latter country,\r\nbut the coincidence is calculated to encourage that belief.  The\r\nManaging Director of the Company (Mr. James Mills) told me that he was\r\na hearty supporter of compulsion, not so much because he believed in\r\narbitration, as because a strike or lock-out was obviated, and the\r\nparties to a dispute, often trivial at the outset, were brought\r\ntogether before they had been embittered by mutual recriminations.  Mr.\r\nKingston, the Premier of South Australia, and the principal promoter of\r\nthe South Australian Act, has written in a similar strain:--\r\n\r\n\"Conciliation Boards should be established in anticipation of the\r\ndifferences they are designed to prevent.  On the occasion of a great\r\nstrike, the public cries out for conciliation.  Suggestions are\r\nreceived from all quarters recommending Conferences and Arbitration;\r\nbut when war has been declared, and the disputants, as it were, are at\r\neach other's throats, each hopeful of ultimate success, they are seldom\r\nin the mood to listen to peacemakers.  If either party fears the result\r\nof the {292} contest, it may favour pacific counsels.  There is,\r\nhowever, a vehement probability that the stronger party will reject all\r\novertures and insist on an unconditional surrender and all the\r\nadvantages which victory can command.  The dispute is then determined,\r\nnot on its merits, but by sheer strength.  The vanquished, smarting\r\nunder a sense of defeat and injustice, capitulate only with the view to\r\nthe early renewal of the struggle under more favourable\r\ncircumstances.\"[11]\r\n\r\n(5) A large proportion of the workmen of Australasia are convinced\r\nbelievers in Protection in the widest sense of the word.  As far as\r\ntheir opinion can be ascertained from the representation of Labour in\r\nParliament, it is unanimous in Victoria, South Australia, and New\r\nZealand.  In New South Wales, as has been seen, the Labour Members\r\nhave, for the sake of solidarity, sunk the fiscal issue; but the\r\nmajority are Protectionists, and have proposed that the question of the\r\ntariff should be settled for a fixed period by a plebiscite.  Thereby\r\nthey believe that they will secure Protection and continue to be\r\nunfettered in their support of the more advanced party.  In Queensland,\r\nalso, the Labour programme states that the fiscal issue is not to be\r\nregarded as a party question.\r\n\r\nProtection, the Labour Members admit, raises prices to the consumer;\r\nbut they contend that, if prices are high, employers can afford to pay\r\nhigh {293} wages, and that the strength of Trades Unionism should be\r\nsufficient to enforce them.  To put their argument, such as it is, in a\r\nnutshell, it is better to have high prices and high wages than low\r\nprices combined with low wages and uncertain employment.  Then, as\r\ncombination is expected to keep wages at a high point, it is obvious\r\nthat it can be exercised most effectually over a small area, and we\r\nfind the South Australian Labour Members voting against a resolution in\r\nfavour of inter-provincial Free Trade, and Labour Members generally\r\nimbued with an actual, if not avowed, opposition to Federation, the\r\nfirst result of which would, it is believed, be the removal of fiscal\r\nbarriers.  They profess, indeed, a desire for Federation on a\r\ndemocratic basis, but are, as far as their material interests are\r\nconcerned, under the influence of a patriotism which is intensely\r\nprovincial and does not take account of national, much less of\r\nimperial, considerations.\r\n\r\nIf he lives under a protective tariff, the workman asks himself of what\r\nuse is it to exclude the products of cheap labour if the cheap labourer\r\nbe allowed to enter the country and compete with him on the spot.  The\r\nagitation against Asiatic immigrants has, I am prepared to admit, a\r\nwider basis, and rests largely upon physical repugnance and the fear\r\nthat they might enter in such large numbers as to swamp the white\r\npopulation.  To that extent it appeals to the Free Traders of New South\r\nWales, who have not been backward in their support of anti-Chinese\r\n{294} legislation, and meets with the general support of Australians,\r\nas was shown by the unanimity with which the Premiers, assembled in\r\nConference early in 1896, decided against participation in the\r\nAnglo-Japanese treaty and in favour of the extension to other coloured\r\nraces of the restrictions placed upon the influx of the Chinese.  But,\r\nfrom the point of view of the working classes, antipathy is felt,\r\nprincipally, towards competitors who have a lower standard of comfort,\r\nand the difficulties placed in the way of Imperial statesmanship are\r\npersistently ignored.\r\n\r\nThence, by an easy transition of thought, the objection is extended to\r\nall labourers whose competition, through the stress of necessity, may\r\ntend to reduce wages.  The indigent Italian or German is equally\r\nundesirable, as are indigent Englishmen, who alone, among Europeans,\r\nare likely to arrive in large numbers.  Some of them, it is known, have\r\nbeen assisted to emigrate, by philanthropic agencies or otherwise,\r\nbecause they were unable to earn a livelihood at home.  South\r\nAustralia, Victoria, Tasmania, and New Zealand seek to exclude paupers\r\nby the provision that the owner or master of a ship bringing persons\r\nwho are likely to become a charge upon the public or any charitable\r\ninstitution, may be called upon to execute a bond to pay all expenses\r\nincurred within five years for the maintenance or support of such\r\npersons.  But the workman reserves his strongest condemnation for the\r\nproposal {295} that he should be compelled to contribute, through\r\ntaxation or Custom duties, to State-aided immigration, which increases\r\nthe number of his competitors.  Herein is seen the cloven foot of the\r\ncapitalist, which must be concealed, except in Queensland, where\r\ncapital and labour are in open antagonism and the former is at present\r\nin the ascendant.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate development of protective ideas is found in the annual tax\r\nlevied on foreign commercial travellers in New Zealand and in the\r\ndesire to subject immigrants to physical as well as pecuniary and\r\nracial tests.  In New Zealand the Undesirable Immigrants Exclusion\r\nBill, and the equally unsuccessful Public Health Bill of 1896, forbade\r\nmasters of ships, under a heavy penalty, to introduce persons who are\r\nconsumptive into the Provinces.  Consumption, it is known, has proved\r\ndeadly to the Maoris, and, to an even greater extent, to half-castes.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to discuss the wisdom of the measures by which\r\nAustralians seek to keep out Asiatics, indigent Europeans, criminals,\r\nand persons in ill-health.  The Imperial Government, of course, can\r\nhave no objection to the imposition of pecuniary disqualifications\r\nwhich, being of general application, do not conflict with treaty\r\nobligations, though the policy is diametrically opposed to that which\r\nhas prevailed hitherto in England.  I merely wish to point out the\r\nstrength of Australasian opposition to unrestricted competition, and to\r\nexpress {296} considerable sympathy with workmen who, having seen, or\r\nhaving learnt from their parents, how much misery and pauperism are to\r\nbe found in older countries, are inhospitable to strangers and will do\r\nall in their power to prevent a fall to a similar level.  Many of them\r\nhave noted the existence of destitution in Sydney and Melbourne, and\r\ndread the operation of any cause which would be likely to intensify it.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that, as England is the principal competitor with\r\nnative manufactures, and the only European country from which\r\nimmigration on a large scale is likely to arise, some of the working\r\nmen entertain a feeling of hostility towards the Mother Country.\r\nIll-feeling is also promoted by the condition of financial dependence.\r\nAustralians are inclined to complain, however unreasonably, that, had\r\nit not been for the temptations to which they were exposed by British\r\ncapitalists, their Provinces could not have incurred the extravagant\r\nexpenditure under which they are suffering and must continue to suffer.\r\nAustralia, it has been said, owes to England merely the gratitude of\r\nthe poor man toward his pawnbroker.  I should not have mentioned the\r\nexistence of these views, which are confined to a small section of the\r\ncommunity, were it not that they seem ominous for the future, when we\r\nremember the principal cause of the estrangement between the Eastern\r\nand Western States of America.  In spite of inquiries and {297}\r\nobservation, I have been unable to form an opinion as to the general\r\nattitude, which is being modified year by year by the increase in the\r\nproportion of native-born Australians.  At one extreme of the social\r\nscale are those who bask in the sunshine of titled vice-royalty, at the\r\nother those in whom the continual struggle for existence precludes the\r\npossibility of national, not to mention Imperial, ideals.  The large\r\nintermediate classes, which will control the future, appear to be\r\nanimated by great sympathy with the English people.  I am led to\r\nbelieve that the boisterous loyalty of the past has been replaced by a\r\ndeeper feeling of kinship, which was displayed in marked fashion on the\r\noccasion of the German Emperor's telegram after the Transvaal raid.  On\r\nthe other hand, the growing independence of a young nation and the\r\nsentimental, but none the less real, objection to the term \"Colonial,\"\r\nwhich is regarded as a mark of inferiority, have convinced some\r\nImperialistic Australians that the shortest road to Federation lies\r\nthrough separation.  Others, I have been surprised to note, do not\r\nconsider that permanence of friendly relations necessarily implies\r\ncontinuance under one flag.  Englishmen will be disappointed to learn\r\nthat there is little general appreciation, especially among native-born\r\nAustralians, of the benefits accruing from the protection of the\r\nBritish fleet.  Never having known the horrors of war and removed from\r\nthe area of great armaments, they are not aware of the dangers {298}\r\nagainst which they are guarded.  In fact, many of them grudge the\r\n\"contributions without representation\" that are given towards the\r\nmaintenance of the Australian squadron.  In foreign politics\r\nAustralians are strongly Imperialistic, and will respect Great Britain\r\nas long as she maintains the dignity of her position.  In domestic\r\naffairs they resent the interference of the Colonial Office, rarely\r\nthough it be exercised, and do not take sufficient account of\r\ninternational difficulties.  They are satisfied, moreover, with\r\nexisting conditions, and do not manifest any desire for closer union\r\nwith Great Britain at present, though any proposals emanating from the\r\nImperial Government will be received with respectful attention and may\r\nmeet with theoretical approval; and, while the recent Presidential\r\nelection in the United States convinced them of the disadvantages of\r\nRepublican institutions, they are prepared to wait upon the natural\r\nevolution of events, and believe that, in the meanwhile, we should\r\nstrive, through the press, travel, and otherwise, to become better\r\nacquainted with each other's ideas and aspirations, and to correct many\r\nof the wrong impressions which prevail both in Australia and Great\r\nBritain.  This policy is not heroic but practical, especially if it\r\ncould be accompanied by a greater identification of Australia with the\r\nEmpire.  If a few hundred Australians could be recruited, in spite of\r\nthe lowness of the pay, for service in the Army and Navy, they would, I\r\nam convinced, upon {299} their return, do much to broaden the minds of\r\ntheir countrymen.  Australia and New Zealand, it must be remembered,\r\nare isolated from the rest of the world.  Again, some of the vacancies\r\nin the Indian Civil Service might be filled by examinations held in\r\nAustralia simultaneously with those in England.  These suggestions,\r\nwhich could be amplified and extended by men of greater experience, may\r\nbe regarded as trivial and unimportant, but I am confident that they\r\nindicate the direction in which Englishmen can most effectually seek to\r\nretain the affections of their Australasian kinsfolk.  The problems of\r\nAustralian Federation will tax all the resources of statesmanship, and\r\nmust, in my opinion, be solved before there can be any profitable\r\ndiscussion of modified and closer relations with the Mother Country.\r\nIt seems to me that the Victorian or Queenslander must realise that he\r\nis an Australian before he can be expected to appreciate the meaning of\r\nthe words, \"Civis Britannicus Sum.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of Australian Federation has been discussed at length in a\r\npreceding chapter.  I need only point out that politicians are bound to\r\nrecognise three lines of severance: the artificial boundaries between\r\none Province and another, the diversity of opinions engendered by\r\ndifferences of climate, as exemplified principally in the attitude in\r\nregard to Polynesian labour, and the divergence of development between\r\nthe denizens of towns and {300} the more settled areas and those who\r\nare struggling against the inclemencies of nature in the back country.\r\nI felt, and others have chronicled a similar impression, that I had\r\nentered into a different country when I travelled in the Western Downs\r\nof Queensland.  I found myself, if I may generalise from a limited\r\nexperience of shearers, among a class of men who are thoroughly honest\r\nbut absolutely narrow-minded and interested only in matters which\r\nconcern their means of livelihood.  They form their opinions from an\r\nadvanced organ of labour, which is their principal, if not only,\r\nliterature, and even such of them as are emigrants from Great Britain\r\nhave little knowledge of the leading events of recent years.\r\n\r\nThe urban population, of course, is in a different position, and is\r\nkept by the newspapers in touch with local and Imperial affairs.  Apart\r\nfrom the causes of the aggregation of large centres which have been\r\ndiscussed in the opening pages of this chapter, and may be supplemented\r\nby the observations of Sir Charles Dilke,[12] it may be noted, as a\r\nsubsidiary influence, that a high standard of comfort makes people\r\nunwilling to face the hardship of the bush, that squatters are inclined\r\nto place their sons in urban professions, and that education turns out\r\nclerks rather than manual labourers.  But the dwellers in towns are, on\r\nthe whole, comfortably situated; even Melbourne and Sydney do not {301}\r\nshow an average of more than 2.73 and 4.87 persons to the acre; but\r\nthese figures include the suburbs, and must be amended if the\r\nmetropolis proper is solely regarded.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of this consideration, the working classes of Australasia\r\nhave little to complain of.  Destitution exists, as is inevitable under\r\npresent conditions, but many workers, especially in Victoria, are\r\nowners of their homes, and all the younger men have had the benefit of\r\na general system of national education and of the favourable situation\r\nof their class.  This is due partly to the position attained, and not\r\nsubsequently lost, when the rush of men to the goldfields produced a\r\nscarcity of labour; partly to the fact which has already been noted,\r\nthat the men who emigrated from Great Britain were imbued with the\r\nspirit which qualified them to assert themselves.  Hitherto they have\r\nnot proved themselves unworthy of their nationality.  They are\r\nuniformly courteous, in my experience, to those who are civil to them,\r\nand do not expect the servility of older countries, and are the most\r\nlaw-abiding people in the world.  On a Saturday night in Coolgardie I\r\nfound things to be as quiet as in a small country town in England.  The\r\nlarrikinism of Melbourne and Sydney has been much exaggerated, and does\r\nnot extend beyond the capitals; in the former city, at the annual\r\nfestival which marks the recurrence of the Melbourne Cup, the behaviour\r\nof the crowd is such {302} as would be a credit to any country.  But\r\nAustralians and New Zealanders, as any visitor cannot but note, take\r\ntheir pleasures sadly, and have transplanted the seriousness of a\r\nNorthern land to a climate which should lend itself to merriment and\r\nlaughter.  How far their character has been modified I am not prepared\r\nto say: on the one hand, employment is not subject to seasonal\r\ninterruptions; on the other, the pressure of cold upon industry is\r\nentirely wanting.  The climate has, however, in spite of the\r\ndenunciations of the Prohibitionists, undoubtedly conduced to temperate\r\nhabits.  Time after time did I notice, during my travels, that all the\r\ncompany were drinking tea, and I have been assured that shearers and\r\nother labourers no longer waste their earnings upon drink.  The\r\ntemperance of the younger generation has also been promoted by the\r\nspread of education and by the love of athletics; which necessitates\r\nphysical soundness.  Speaking generally and responsibly, the working\r\nclasses, which form the backbone of every country, though they pay high\r\nrent, earn high wages, and, as they do not pay high prices for their\r\nfood or clothing, are enabled to become self-respecting members of a\r\nself-respecting community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] August 8, 1896.\r\n\r\n[2] 1893, vol. ii. pp. 456, 457.\r\n\r\n[3] July 25, 1896.\r\n\r\n[4] \"A Statistical Account of the Seven Colonies of Australasia,\r\n1895-6,\" by T.

Among my fellow travellers was a\r\nmining expert, bound for the Western Australian goldfields, who\r\nproposed that I should accompany him, and said that, as he knew the\r\nleading people on the fields, he would be able to render my trip\r\nagreeable.  I gladly accepted his offer, and have since had cause to\r\nconsider that I was most fortunate, as I believe that some such\r\nintroduction as mine is indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe large mail steamers all touch Western Australia at Albany, distant\r\n340 miles from Perth and 570 miles from Coolgardie.  The Government are\r\ncarrying out very extensive harbour works at Fremantle, the port of\r\nPerth, in the hope of inducing the mail steamers to call there, and\r\nthey believe that, when a railway line has been constructed between\r\n{304} Perth and Adelaide, a line which must eventually be built, though\r\nperhaps not for many years, Fremantle will become a place of great\r\nimportance, as, beyond being the shipping port for the produce of the\r\nCoolgardie goldfields, it will be the point of arrival and departure of\r\nthe mails between Great Britain and all the Australian Provinces.\r\n\r\nWe reached Albany, which is 200 miles further from Coolgardie than\r\nFremantle, late in the evening, and, having missed by a few hours the\r\ndirect train which runs three times a week to Perth, we spent the night\r\nat a third-rate hotel, unable to sleep owing to the attacks of the\r\nmosquitoes, and left by train the next morning after a breakfast\r\nconsisting of coarse meat and impossible eggs.  We soon lost sight of\r\nthe bay of Albany, and, plunging into the bush, travelled through it\r\nthe whole day.  The heat was overpowering, as we were still almost at\r\nthe height of summer.  In the afternoon a stranger came into the\r\ncompartment and enlivened us with anecdotes of his experiences at an\r\noutlying station.  In several stories he referred to actions which\r\nshowed him to have behaved in the most ruthlessly cruel manner towards\r\nthe aborigines.  To quote one among many: A young native servant in his\r\nemployment came to believe that, owing to some unintentional\r\ncontravention of the religious observances of his people, he was doomed\r\nto die within three days; so he lay on his back and refused to take\r\nfood.  As he was a good workman, {305} his master first tried to induce\r\nhim to rise, then thrashed him with all his might, and afterwards had\r\nhim dragged along the ground by his hair until he was so exhausted that\r\nhe came unconscious.  It is needless to add that, on his recovery, the\r\nman had been cured of his obstinacy.  Such conduct, I am convinced, is\r\nmost exceptional.  All the Australasian Governments are actuated by a\r\nsincere desire to protect the aborigines, as are the vast majority of\r\nthe inhabitants.  But, as long as many districts are sparsely settled,\r\nisolated cases of barbarous cruelty must continue to occur.\r\n\r\nAfter thirteen hours of travel we reached Beverley, where we were\r\nobliged to spend the night, and again suffered from bad accommodation,\r\nindifferent food, and mosquitoes.  A journey of five hours on the\r\nfollowing morning took us to Perth, where we proposed to spend a few\r\ndays.  My companion noticed a great difference in the appearance of the\r\ntown; a few years ago, he told me, it was lifeless and dull, strangers\r\nrarely arrived, trade was stagnant, and the whole place wore an air of\r\nlistlessness.  The rapid change must be put down entirely to the\r\nsuccess of the goldfields, even allowing full credit to the Government\r\nfor their efforts to develop all the resources of the country.  The\r\npopulation of the Province has doubled during the last five years; the\r\npopulation of Perth has more than doubled, and large business firms\r\nhave established branches there.  But great though its progress has\r\nbeen, it is hard to {306} realise that this place, which is not larger\r\nthan an English country town, is the capital and seat of government of\r\na Province of nearly a million square miles, which possesses 1,200\r\nmiles of railway and goldfields of enormous extent, which seem likely\r\nto take rank among the most productive of the world.  Perth is\r\npicturesquely situated on the Swan River, and should increase largely\r\nbeyond its present dimensions.  Handsome brick buildings alternate even\r\nin the principal thoroughfares with miserable shanties which are bound\r\nsoon to disappear.  In the evening the streets present a scene of great\r\nanimation, as hundreds of people may be seen walking up and down,\r\neagerly discussing the mining news, which always presents some feature\r\nof interest.  Men gather together in small groups, whispering weighty\r\nsecrets which may or may not be intended for the benefit of their\r\nhearers, for in Perth, as elsewhere, we hear that large fortunes have\r\nbeen made through the credulity and folly of the too eager investor.\r\n\r\nAt Perth I made several purchases, all of which were of use to me: a\r\npair of dark blue spectacles with perforated sides, as a protection\r\nagainst the dust and sun, a fly-net and a water-bag.  The latter, made\r\nof canvas, in order that its contents may be cooled by evaporation, is\r\ncarried by all travellers who distrust the quality of the water which\r\nthey are likely to obtain at wayside stations.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit to the goldfields, the {307} railway terminated\r\nat Bullabulling, some eighteen miles from Coolgardie.  The journey from\r\nPerth to Coolgardie was a matter of twenty-eight hours.  Leaving in the\r\nafternoon, we arrived the next morning at Southern Cross, the centre of\r\na mining district which has been eclipsed by those further east.  We\r\nhad breakfast at an unpretentious little hotel, the landlady of which\r\nharrowed us by accounts of the amount of typhoid fever prevalent in the\r\nplace.  Her own servant was ill, several deaths had recently occurred,\r\nand she had heard the undertaker in the early morning again at work\r\nupon a coffin.  We continued our journey by the contractor's train,\r\ncovering one hundred miles in seven hours and passing through scenery\r\nwhich became terribly wearisome from its dreary monotony.  So far we\r\nhad travelled comfortably enough, but the last eighteen miles by coach\r\nwere more tiring than the whole of the rest of the journey.  The road\r\nwas inches deep in dust and full of holes, and we ploughed our way\r\nalong it at the rate of five miles an hour, a pace which was not\r\nmaintained when darkness set in and the driver could no longer pick his\r\nway in the best track, but continually jolted us in the deep ruts and\r\nbumped the coach against tree stumps.  Upon our arrival at Coolgardie,\r\nwe found a difficulty in obtaining rooms; at the principal hotel no\r\naccommodation of any kind was to be had; at another all the rooms were\r\noccupied, but we were offered a shake-down which we thought {308} it\r\nwise to accept.  We learnt the next day that twenty-three extra beds\r\nhad been made up, in the drawing-room, on the balcony, in fact at every\r\navailable spot, and that the rush had continued for more than a year.\r\n\r\nThe following morning I looked out upon a sandy track which represents\r\nthe main street of Coolgardie.  It was already a scene of some\r\nanimation; camels, driven by Afghans, were carrying their heavy burdens\r\nin and out of the town; aborigines, with their wives and children, in\r\nall their degraded ugliness, were passing to and fro; and bustling\r\nmerchants and clerks were hurrying past on bicycles to their various\r\noccupations.  The houses of Coolgardie are built of a framework of\r\nwood, covered with a sheeting of galvanised iron.  The town is entirely\r\ndependent for all its supplies on the outside world, as the country,\r\nwithin a radius of at least one hundred miles, will produce food for\r\nneither man nor beast.  The question of water supply, even for domestic\r\npurposes, was until recently a great difficulty; but several fresh\r\nwater wells have been sunk which, together with the output of numerous\r\ncondensers, give an ample supply for the town.  The rainfall is very\r\nsmall, and too irregular to be depended upon.  The sky is often\r\novercast for weeks and rain threatens daily, but the clouds gradually\r\ndisperse and leave the land as parched as before.\r\n\r\nStrolling out of the town we found ourselves {309} on the outskirts of\r\na mining district.  As far as the eye could see, the country was\r\nstudded with tents, mining shafts, and condensers, and the soil was\r\neverywhere raised in irregular heaps.  For miles around every sod of\r\nearth has been turned over and put through a blower in the search for\r\nthe alluvial gold which has been found there in great quantities.  We\r\ncame upon an old man who said that the land upon which he was working\r\nhad not been thoroughly sifted, and showed us a few grains of gold\r\nwhich he had obtained as the result of his labours.  A little further\r\non we came to some mines, and my companion pointed out and explained to\r\nme the machinery by which the gold is separated from the stone.  A\r\nreturn of an ounce of gold to a ton of quartz is, speaking generally,\r\nregarded as satisfactory, but many other factors have to be weighed in\r\nthe consideration of the question whether a mine is likely to repay the\r\noutlay upon it, such as the width and probable extent of the reef, and\r\nthe possibility of obtaining an adequate amount of water for working\r\nthe machinery.  I gathered that there could be no doubt as to the\r\nrichness of the reefs on several of the goldfields of Western\r\nAustralia, but that, on most of them, the great difficulty has been,\r\nand still is, the inadequacy of the water supply.\r\n\r\nWe did not remain long at Coolgardie, but continued our journey to\r\nKalgoorlie, a small township twenty-four miles from Coolgardie and\r\n{310} the centre of the field where my companion had to do most of his\r\nwork as a mining expert.  We travelled by coach in the early morning\r\nand had a further experience of the discomforts of a rough and heavy\r\ntrack.  Kalgoorlie was a repetition of Coolgardie, on a smaller scale.\r\nBoth are the creation of the last few years and must not be judged by\r\ntoo high a standard.  The town authorities have done their best to\r\nprocure good sanitary conditions and have been aided by the Government,\r\nwho give, as a subsidy to municipalities, one pound for every pound\r\nraised from general rates, and have also assisted them in the erection\r\nand maintenance of hospitals; but the lack of funds has retarded\r\nimprovements which the authorities have been anxious to carry out.  We\r\narrived at Kalgoorlie on a Sunday, and noticed that the inhabitants,\r\nmost of whom are adults, bachelors or married men separated from their\r\nwives and families, were loitering about with every appearance of utter\r\nboredom.\r\n\r\nFrom the town we walked to one of the neighbouring camps where my\r\ncompanion had acquaintances.  These camps offer a much pleasanter life\r\nthan that in the towns.  Each forms in itself a small settlement of\r\nlarge canvas tents fitted up by the residents, who have a common mess\r\nand every opportunity of leading a sociable life.  At the camp which we\r\nvisited we found several of the men disporting themselves in hammocks\r\nin an arbour made of {311} closely plaited branches of trees, which\r\nkept off the heat of the sun and admitted a cool current of air.  In\r\nthe course of conversation it was arranged that we should visit several\r\nof the mines on the following day.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we visited a mine upon which little had, so far, been\r\ndone.  We were placed at the top of the shaft in a small cage, by which\r\nwe were let down to a depth of a hundred feet.  Then we were led along\r\na labyrinth of passages from which my companions gathered the direction\r\nand extent of the reef, and we were shown various points at which the\r\ngold, which was of a coarse character, could clearly be seen in the\r\nstone.  In the afternoon we visited another mine which was of more\r\ninterest to me.  A shaft had been sunk to a depth of two hundred feet,\r\nat which level water had been struck, and the miners were busily at\r\nwork.  Again we were let down in a cage, and wandered through seemingly\r\nendless passages, which reminded me, in my ignorance, of parts of the\r\ncatacombs at Rome, as nothing appeared to the unsophisticated eye but\r\nthe bare rock.  The gold was very fine, and only visible to us when the\r\nforeman struck off a flake and pointed it out to us glistening in\r\nminute particles in the quartz.  He told me that ordinary miners earned\r\nL3 10s. a week, those working in the water at the low level L4, but\r\nthat they could not live on less than L2, and, even so, only in the\r\nroughest way.  The life is, however, not an unhealthy one, {312} as the\r\nmines are, to judge from those that I visited, well ventilated.  The\r\nmine and other surrounding properties have created a thriving\r\nsettlement; well-built offices have been erected, hundreds of men are\r\nemployed, and the ear is continually greeted by the din of machinery.\r\nIn the evening we returned to Kalgoorlie and heard, near our hotel, a\r\nservice held by the Salvation Army in the centre of the street.  A\r\nlarge group of loungers stood around, moved neither to ribaldry nor\r\nattention, but apparently listening in complete indifference to the\r\npassionate pleadings of the preachers.  Some yards away a mining agent\r\nwas doing a brisk business in shares.\r\n\r\nA few days later I retraced my steps to Coolgardie, and thence to\r\nPerth.  On the homeward journey I had experiences of much discomfort.\r\nOn the coach between Coolgardie and Bullabulling, I managed, as on the\r\nprevious occasion, by a private arrangement with the driver, to secure\r\nthe box-seat, in order to be at an elevation from the dust.  But the\r\nwind was behind us, and we were soon enveloped in such a cloud of dust\r\nthat it was often impossible to see the leaders, and, as there is no\r\nrule of the road, we had narrow escapes of colliding with teams\r\ntravelling in the opposite direction.  Upon our arrival at\r\nBullabulling, we found that the contractor's train contained only one\r\npassenger carriage, which was already crowded; so several of us climbed\r\non an open luggage truck and made ourselves tolerably {313}\r\ncomfortable, though we suffered from the blazing heat of the mid-day\r\nsun.  My neighbour was a man who had had a most varied career.  In his\r\nyouth he had managed a small hosiery shop in an English Midland town;\r\nthen, as his health was bad, he had emigrated to Victoria, where he had\r\nunsuccessfully carried on grazing operations.  He had been attracted to\r\nWestern Australia by the discoveries of gold, and had bought a waggon\r\nand team of horses, with which he had carried goods between Southern\r\nCross and Coolgardie before the construction of the railway.  He told\r\nme that the life had been very hard, and pointed out to me portions of\r\nthe road which were so heavy that a progress of ten miles was regarded\r\nas a satisfactory day's work.  He was then on his way to revisit the\r\n\"old country,\" after an absence of five years.  At Southern Cross we\r\nchanged into the Government train, and I travelled through the night in\r\na compartment with four others, two of whom were ill, one of them\r\nsuffering from some form of ophthalmia which caused him excruciating\r\npain and kept him the whole time awake.  None of us obtained much\r\nsleep, and we were glad to reach Perth early next morning.\r\n\r\nThus ended my trip to the goldfields, upon which I look back with\r\nconsiderable satisfaction in spite of the obvious discomforts which it\r\nentailed.  I found that all with whom I came in contact in Western\r\nAustralia, and, I might add, in Australasia, whether they were\r\ncustom-house officials, railway employes, {314} hotel proprietors or\r\nservants, had done their best to be obliging.  Of the kindly\r\nhospitality of all whom I met on the goldfields I cannot speak in\r\nsufficiently high terms.  They were uniformly straightforward,\r\ngenerous, energetic men, who gave me the impression of a good moral\r\nstandard.  I do not speak of the adventurers who congregate in any\r\nplace where money can be made rapidly by unscrupulous methods, but of\r\nthe managers, foremen and others, who are directly engaged in the\r\ndevelopment of the mines.  The great curse of the mining districts, and\r\nalso, to some extent, of Perth, is the absence of sufficient means of\r\nrecreation.  This state of things may be inevitable in the case of\r\ntowns of very recent growth, but its result is, that men who have\r\nworked all day, requiring some form of diversion, find it in drink.\r\nBut, in spite of the large consumption of liquor, drunkenness is rare\r\nand rowdiness almost unknown.  At Coolgardie on a Saturday evening the\r\nstreets were perfectly quiet; beyond some discordant strains of music,\r\nscarcely a sound was to be heard.  In spite of one or two recent\r\nburglaries, life and property are scarcely less safe than in England.\r\nA bank manager who travelled with me from Kalgoorlie told me that, in\r\nstarting a new branch of his bank at an outlying township, he had been\r\nobliged at first to live in, and keep his money in, a tent, but that on\r\nno occasion had he been menaced by the slightest attempt at robbery.  I\r\nshall long remember {315} the sight of townships which have sprung up\r\nwhere a few years ago was nothing but bush, and promise to become the\r\nscene of great industrial activity, and my intercourse with some of the\r\npioneers of the mining movement, men who have penetrated hundreds of\r\nmiles into the interior of the country, have endured for years the\r\nterrible hardships of life in the bush, and have, by their untiring\r\nexertions, seconded by the influx of capital following upon their\r\nsuccess, done much to raise Western Australia to a prominent position\r\namong the Provinces of the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{317}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAborigines:\r\n  Constitution Bill for establishing Federation, special\r\n    provisions for, 220\r\n  Maoris of New Zealand [see that title]\r\n  Protection of, 158, 305\r\n  Right of possession not recognised in Tasmania and Australia, 85\r\n\r\nAbsentee Tax, assessment of in:\r\n  New Zealand, 91\r\n  South Australia, 19\r\n\r\nAdelaide, Agricultural Bureau and Agricultural College in, 20, 21\r\n\r\nAdult Suffrage:\r\n  Lower Houses of South Australia and New Zealand elected on\r\n    basis of, 2, 192\r\n  Liquor legislation in New Zealand, Local Option and Licensing\r\n    Committee polls placed on basis of, 198\r\n\r\nAdvances to Settlers Act, New Zealand, 99, 118\r\n\r\nAgricultural Bureau and Agricultural College, Adelaide, 20, 21\r\n\r\nArbitration and conciliation in industrial disputes:\r\n  New South Wales, 281\r\n  New Zealand Act, 283\r\n    Awards under, 286\r\n  Queensland, 76, 282\r\n  South Australian Act, 24, 283\r\n\r\nAssisted Schools Abolition Act, 159\r\n\r\nAustralasian Federation Enabling Act:\r\n  Queensland Bill, rejection of, 235\r\n  Victorian Act, provisions of, 230\r\n  Western Australian Act, provisions of, 233\r\n\r\nAustralasians, character of, 302\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nBatchelor, Mr. E.

Crown 8vo., cloth, 6s.\r\n\r\n\"As convincingly real and vivid as a narrative can be.\"--Sketch.\r\n\r\n\"No maker of plots could work out a better story of its kind, nor\r\nbalance it more neatly.\"--_Daily Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n\"A book which describes a set of characters varied and so attractive as\r\nthe more prominent figures in this romance, and a book so full of life,\r\nvicissitude, and peril, should be welcomed by every discreet novel\r\nreader.\"--_Yorkshire Post_.\r\n\r\n\"A very interesting tale, written in clear and vigorous\r\nEnglish.\"--_Globe_.\r\n\r\n\"The novel is a happy blend of truth and fiction, with a purpose that\r\nwill be appreciated by many readers; it has also the most exciting\r\nelements of the tale of adventure.\"--_Morning Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS BY JOSEPH CONRAD\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAN OUTCAST OF THE ISLANDS\r\n\r\nCrown 8vo., cloth, 6s.\r\n\r\n\"Subject to the qualifications thus disposed of (_vide_ first part of\r\nnotice), 'An Outcast of the Islands' is perhaps the finest piece of\r\nfiction that has been published this year, as 'Almayer's Folly' was one\r\nof the finest that was published in 1895....  Surely this is real\r\nromance--the romance that is real.  Space forbids anything but the\r\nmerest recapitulation of the other living realities of Mr. Conrad's\r\ninvention--of Lingard, of the inimitable Almayer, the one-eyed\r\nBabalatchi, the Naturalist, of the pious Abdulla--all novel, all\r\nauthentic.  Enough has been written to show Mr. Conrad's quality.  He\r\nimagines his scenes and their sequence like a master; he knows his\r\nindividualities and their hearts; he has a new and wonderful field in\r\nthis East Indian Novel of his....  Greatness is deliberately written;\r\nthe present writer has read and re-read his two books, and after\r\nputting this review aside for some days to consider the discretion of\r\nit, the word still stands.\"--_Saturday Review_\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nALMAYER'S FOLLY\r\n\r\nSecond Edition.   Crown 8vo., cloth, 6s.\r\n\r\n\"This startling, unique, splendid book.\"--Mr. T. P. O'CONNOR, M.P.\r\n\r\n\"This is a decidedly powerful story of an uncommon type, and breaks\r\nfresh ground in fiction ...  All the leading characters in the\r\nbook--Almayer, his wife, his daughter, and Dain, the daughter's native\r\nlover--are well drawn, and the parting between father and daughter has\r\na pathetic naturalness about it, unspoiled by straining after effect.\r\nThere are, too, some admirably graphic passages in the book.  The\r\napproach of a monsoon is most effectively described....  The name of\r\nMr. Joseph Conrad is new to us, but it appears to us as if he might\r\nbecome the Kipling of the Malay Archipelago.\"--_Spectator_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EBBING OF THE TIDE\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nLOUIS BECKE\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"By Reef and Palm\"\r\n\r\nSecond Edition.  Crown 8vo., cloth, 6s.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Louis Becke wields a powerful pen, with the additional advantage\r\nthat he waves it in unfrequented places, and summons up with it the\r\nelemental passions of human nature....  It will be seen that Mr. Becke\r\nis somewhat of the fleshly school, but with a pathos and power not\r\ngiven to the ordinary professors of that school....  Altogether for\r\nthose who like stirring stories cast in strange scenes, this is a book\r\nto be read.\"--_National Observer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACIFIC TALES\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nLOUIS BECKE\r\n\r\nWith a Portrait of the Author\r\n\r\nSecond Edition.  Crown 8vo., cloth, 6s.\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of a new book by Mr. Becke has become an event of\r\nnote--and very justly.  No living author, if we except Mr. Kipling, has\r\nso amazing a command of that unhackneyed vitality of phrase that most\r\npeople call by the name of realism.  Whether it is scenery or character\r\nor incident that he wishes to depict, the touch is ever so dramatic and\r\nvivid that the reader is conscious of a picture and impression that has\r\nno parallel save in the records of actual sight and\r\nmemory.\"--_Westminster Gazette_.\r\n\r\n\"Another series of sketches of island life in the South Seas, not\r\ninferior to those contained in 'By Reef and Palm.'\"--_Speaker_.\r\n\r\n\"The book is well worth reading.  The author knows what he is talking\r\nabout and has a keen eye for the picturesque.\"--G. B. BURGIN in\r\n_To-day_.\r\n\r\n\"A notable contribution to the romance of the South Seas.\"--T. P.\r\nO'CONNOR, M.P., in _The Graphic_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPADDY'S WOMAN\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nHUMPHREY JAMES\r\n\r\nCrown 8vo, 6s.\r\n\r\n\"Traits of the Celt of humble circumstances are copied with keen\r\nappreciation and unsparing accuracy.\"--_Scotsman_.\r\n\r\n\"....... They are full of indescribable charm and pathos.\"--_Bradford\r\nObserver_.\r\n\r\n\"The outstanding merit of this series of stories is that they are\r\nabsolutely true to life .... the photographic accuracy and minuteness\r\ndisplayed are really marvellous.\"--_Aberdeen Free Press_.\r\n\r\n\"'Paddy's Woman and Other Stories' by Humphrey James; a volume written\r\nin the familiar diction of the Ulster people themselves, with perfect\r\nrealism and very remarkable ability....  For genuine human nature and\r\nhuman relations, and humour of an indescribable kind, we are unable to\r\ncite a rival to this volume.\"--_The World_.\r\n\r\n\"For a fine subtle piece of humour we are inclined to think that 'A\r\nGlass of Whisky' takes a lot of beating....  In short Mr. Humphrey\r\nJames has given us a delightful book, and one which does as much credit\r\nto his heart as to his head.  We shall look forward with a keen\r\nanticipation to the next 'writings' by this shrewd, 'cliver,' and\r\ncompassionate young author.\"--_Bookselling_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Australasian Democracy, by Henry de R.
