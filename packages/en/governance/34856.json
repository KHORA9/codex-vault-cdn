How mild, by comparison with the\r\ndespatches in the daily newspapers, will seem this chronicle of women's\r\nmilitant struggle against political and social injustice in one small\r\ncorner of Europe. Yet let it stand as it was written, with\r\npeace--so-called, and civilisation, and orderly government as the\r\nbackground for heroism such as the world has seldom witnessed. The\r\nmilitancy of men, through all the centuries, has drenched the world with\r\nblood, and for these deeds of horror and destruction men have been\r\nrewarded with monuments, with great songs and epics. The militancy of\r\nwomen has harmed no human life save the lives of those who fought the\r\nbattle of righteousness. Time alone will reveal what reward will be\r\nallotted to the women.\r\n\r\nThis we know, that in the black hour that has just struck in Europe, the\r\nmen are turning to their women and calling on them to take up the work\r\nof keeping civilisation alive. Through all the harvest fields, in\r\norchards and vineyards, women are garnering food for the men who fight,\r\nas well as for the children left fatherless by war. In the cities the\r\nwomen are keeping open the shops, they are driving trucks and trams, and\r\nare altogether attending to a multitude of business.\r\n\r\nWhen the remnants of the armies return, when the commerce of Europe is\r\nresumed by men, will they forget the part the women so nobly played?\r\nWill they forget in England how women in all ranks of life put aside\r\ntheir own interests and organised, not only to nurse the wounded, care\r\nfor the destitute, comfort the sick and lonely, but actually to maintain\r\nthe existence of the nation? Thus far, it must be admitted, there are\r\nfew indications that the English Government are mindful of the unselfish\r\ndevotion manifested by the women. Thus far all Government schemes for\r\novercoming unemployment have been directed towards the unemployment of\r\nmen. The work of women, making garments, etc., has in some cases been\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nAt the first alarm of war the militants proclaimed a truce, which was\r\nanswered half-heartedly by the announcement that the Government would\r\nrelease all suffrage prisoners who would give an undertaking \"not to\r\ncommit further crimes or outrages.\" Since the truce had already been\r\nproclaimed, no suffrage prisoner deigned to reply to the Home\r\nSecretary's provision. A few days later, no doubt influenced by\r\nrepresentations made to the Government by men and women of every\r\npolitical faith--many of them never having been supporters of\r\nrevolutionary tactics--Mr. McKenna announced in the House of Commons\r\nthat it was the intention of the Government, within a few days, to\r\nrelease unconditionally, all suffrage prisoners. So ends, for the\r\npresent, the war of women against men. As of old, the women become the\r\nnurturing mothers of men, their sisters and uncomplaining helpmates. The\r\nfuture lies far ahead, but let this preface and this volume close with\r\nthe assurance that the struggle for the full enfranchisement of women\r\nhas not been abandoned; it has simply, for the moment, been placed in\r\nabeyance. When the clash of arms ceases, when normal, peaceful, rational\r\nsociety resumes its functions, the demand will again be made. If it is\r\nnot quickly granted, then once more the women will take up the arms they\r\nto-day generously lay down. There can be no real peace in the world\r\nuntil woman, the mother half of the human family, is given liberty in\r\nthe councils of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF A MILITANT\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Pankhurst's Own Story\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThose men and women are fortunate who are born at a time when a great\r\nstruggle for human freedom is in progress. It is an added good fortune\r\nto have parents who take a personal part in the great movements of their\r\ntime. I am glad and thankful that this was my case.\r\n\r\nOne of my earliest recollections is of a great bazaar which was held in\r\nmy native city of Manchester, the object of the bazaar being to raise\r\nmoney to relieve the poverty of the newly emancipated negro slaves in\r\nthe United States. My mother took an active part in this effort, and I,\r\nas a small child, was entrusted with a lucky bag by means of which I\r\nhelped to collect money.\r\n\r\nYoung as I was--I could not have been older than five years--I knew\r\nperfectly well the meaning of the words slavery and emancipation. From\r\ninfancy I had been accustomed to hear pro and con discussions of slavery\r\nand the American Civil War. Although the British government finally\r\ndecided not to recognise the Confederacy, public opinion in England was\r\nsharply divided on the questions both of slavery and of secession.\r\nBroadly speaking, the propertied classes were pro-slavery, but there\r\nwere many exceptions to the rule. Most of those who formed the circle\r\nof our family friends were opposed to slavery, and my father, Robert\r\nGoulden, was always a most ardent abolitionist. He was prominent enough\r\nin the movement to be appointed on a committee to meet and welcome Henry\r\nWard Beecher when he arrived in England for a lecture tour. Mrs. Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe's novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" was so great a favourite\r\nwith my mother that she used it continually as a source of bedtime\r\nstories for our fascinated ears. Those stories, told almost fifty years\r\nago, are as fresh in my mind to-day as events detailed in the morning's\r\npapers. Indeed they are more vivid, because they made a much deeper\r\nimpression on my consciousness. I can still definitely recall the thrill\r\nI experienced every time my mother related the tale of Eliza's race for\r\nfreedom over the broken ice of the Ohio River, the agonizing pursuit,\r\nand the final rescue at the hands of the determined old Quaker. Another\r\nthrilling tale was the story of a negro boy's flight from the plantation\r\nof his cruel master. The boy had never seen a railroad train, and when,\r\nstaggering along the unfamiliar railroad track, he heard the roar of an\r\napproaching train, the clattering car-wheels seemed to his strained\r\nimagination to be repeating over and over again the awful words, \"Catch\r\na nigger--catch a nigger--catch a nigger--\" This was a terrible story,\r\nand throughout my childhood, whenever I rode in a train, I thought of\r\nthat poor runaway slave escaping from the pursuing monster.\r\n\r\nThese stories, with the bazaars and the relief funds and subscriptions\r\nof which I heard so much talk, I am sure made a permanent impression on\r\nmy brain and my character. They awakened in me the two sets of\r\nsensations to which all my life I have most readily responded: first,\r\nadmiration for that spirit of fighting and heroic sacrifice by which\r\nalone the soul of civilisation is saved; and next after that,\r\nappreciation of the gentler spirit which is moved to mend and repair the\r\nravages of war.\r\n\r\nI do not remember a time when I could not read, nor any time when\r\nreading was not a joy and a solace. As far back as my memory runs I\r\nloved tales, especially those of a romantic and idealistic character.\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" was an early favourite, as well as another of\r\nBunyan's visionary romances, which does not seem to be as well known,\r\nhis \"Holy War.\" At nine I discovered the Odyssey and very soon after\r\nthat another classic which has remained all my life a source of\r\ninspiration. This was Carlyle's \"French Revolution,\" and I received it\r\nwith much the same emotion that Keats experienced when he read Chapman's\r\ntranslation of Homer--\" ... like some watcher of the skies, When a new\r\nplanet swims into his ken.\"\r\n\r\nI never lost that first impression, and it strongly affected my attitude\r\ntoward events which were occurring around my childhood. Manchester is a\r\ncity which has witnessed a great many stirring episodes, especially of a\r\npolitical character. Generally speaking, its citizens have been liberal\r\nin their sentiments, defenders of free speech and liberty of opinion. In\r\nthe late sixties there occurred in Manchester one of those dreadful\r\nevents that prove an exception to the rule. This was in connection with\r\nthe Fenian Revolt in Ireland. There was a Fenian riot, and the police\r\narrested the leaders. These men were being taken to the jail in a prison\r\nvan. On the way the van was stopped and an attempt was made to rescue\r\nthe prisoners. A man fired a pistol, endeavouring to break the lock of\r\nthe van door. A policeman fell, mortally wounded, and several men were\r\narrested and were charged with murder. I distinctly remember the riot,\r\nwhich I did not witness, but which I heard vividly described by my older\r\nbrother. I had been spending the afternoon with a young playmate, and my\r\nbrother had come after tea to escort me home. As we walked through the\r\ndeepening November twilight he talked excitedly of the riot, the fatal\r\npistol shot, and the slain policeman. I could almost see the man\r\nbleeding on the ground, while the crowd swayed and groaned around him.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story reveals one of those ghastly blunders which\r\njustice not infrequently makes. Although the shooting was done without\r\nany intent to kill, the men were tried for murder and three of them were\r\nfound guilty and hanged. Their execution, which greatly excited the\r\ncitizens of Manchester, was almost the last, if not the last, public\r\nexecution permitted to take place in the city. At the time I was a\r\nboarding-pupil in a school near Manchester, and I spent my week-ends at\r\nhome. A certain Saturday afternoon stands out in my memory, as on my way\r\nhome from school I passed the prison where I knew the men had been\r\nconfined. I saw that a part of the prison wall had been torn away, and\r\nin the great gap that remained were evidences of a gallows recently\r\nremoved. I was transfixed with horror, and over me there swept the\r\nsudden conviction that that hanging was a mistake--worse, a crime. It\r\nwas my awakening to one of the most terrible facts of life--that justice\r\nand judgment lie often a world apart.\r\n\r\nI relate this incident of my formative years to illustrate the fact that\r\nthe impressions of childhood often have more to do with character and\r\nfuture conduct than heredity or education. I tell it also to show that\r\nmy development into an advocate of militancy was largely a sympathetic\r\nprocess. I have not personally suffered from the deprivations, the\r\nbitterness and sorrow which bring so many men and women to a realisation\r\nof social injustice. My childhood was protected by love and a\r\ncomfortable home. Yet, while still a very young child, I began\r\ninstinctively to feel that there was something lacking, even in my own\r\nhome, some false conception of family relations, some incomplete ideal.\r\n\r\nThis vague feeling of mine began to shape itself into conviction about\r\nthe time my brothers and I were sent to school. The education of the\r\nEnglish boy, then as now, was considered a much more serious matter than\r\nthe education of the English boy's sister. My parents, especially my\r\nfather, discussed the question of my brothers' education as a matter of\r\nreal importance. My education and that of my sister were scarcely\r\ndiscussed at all. Of course we went to a carefully selected girls'\r\nschool, but beyond the facts that the head mistress was a gentlewoman\r\nand that all the pupils were girls of my own class, nobody seemed\r\nconcerned. A girl's education at that time seemed to have for its prime\r\nobject the art of \"making home attractive\"--presumably to migratory male\r\nrelatives. It used to puzzle me to understand why I was under such a\r\nparticular obligation to make home attractive to my brothers. We were on\r\nexcellent terms of friendship, but it was never suggested to them as a\r\nduty that they make home attractive to me. Why not? Nobody seemed to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe answer to these puzzling questions came to me unexpectedly one night\r\nwhen I lay in my little bed waiting for sleep to overtake me. It was a\r\ncustom of my father and mother to make the round of our bedrooms every\r\nnight before going themselves to bed. When they entered my room that\r\nnight I was still awake, but for some reason I chose to feign slumber.\r\nMy father bent over me, shielding the candle flame with his big hand. I\r\ncannot know exactly what thought was in his mind as he gazed down at me,\r\nbut I heard him say, somewhat sadly, \"What a pity she wasn't born a\r\nlad.\"\r\n\r\nMy first hot impulse was to sit up in bed and protest that I didn't want\r\nto be a boy, but I lay still and heard my parents' footsteps pass on\r\ntoward the next child's bed. I thought about my father's remark for many\r\ndays afterward, but I think I never decided that I regretted my sex.\r\nHowever, it was made quite clear that men considered themselves superior\r\nto women, and that women apparently acquiesced in that belief.\r\n\r\nI found this view of things difficult to reconcile with the fact that\r\nboth my father and my mother were advocates of equal suffrage. I was\r\nvery young when the Reform Act of 1866 was passed, but I very well\r\nremember the agitation caused by certain circumstances attending it.\r\nThis Reform Act, known as the Household Franchise Bill, marked the first\r\npopular extension of the ballot in England since 1832. Under its terms,\r\nhouseholders paying a minimum of ten pounds a year rental were given the\r\nParliamentary vote. While it was still under discussion in the House of\r\nCommons, John Stuart Mill moved an amendment to the bill to include\r\nwomen householders as well as men. The amendment was defeated, but in\r\nthe act as passed the word \"man,\" instead of the usual \"male person,\"\r\nwas used. Now, under another act of Parliament it had been decided that\r\nthe word \"man\" always included \"woman\" unless otherwise specifically\r\nstated. For example, in certain acts containing rate-paying clauses, the\r\nmasculine noun and pronoun are used throughout, but the provisions apply\r\nto women rate-payers as well as to men. So when the Reform Bill with the\r\nword \"man\" in it became law, many women believed that the right of\r\nsuffrage had actually been bestowed upon them. A tremendous amount of\r\ndiscussion ensued, and the matter was finally tested by a large number\r\nof women seeking to have their names placed upon the register as voters.\r\nIn my city of Manchester 3,924 women, out of a total of 4,215 possible\r\nwomen voters, claimed their votes, and their claim was defended in the\r\nlaw courts by eminent lawyers, including my future husband, Dr.\r\nPankhurst. Of course the women's claim was settled adversely in the\r\ncourts, but the agitation resulted in a strengthening of the\r\nwoman-suffrage agitation all over the country.\r\n\r\nI was too young to understand the precise nature of the affair, but I\r\nshared in the general excitement. From reading newspapers aloud to my\r\nfather I had developed a genuine interest in politics, and the Reform\r\nBill presented itself to my young intelligence as something that was\r\ngoing to do the most wonderful good to the country. The first election\r\nafter the bill became law was naturally a memorable occasion. It is\r\nchiefly memorable to me because it was the first one in which I ever\r\nparticipated. My sister and I had just been presented with new winter\r\nfrocks, green in colour, and made alike, after the custom of proper\r\nBritish families. Every girl child in those days wore a red flannel\r\npetticoat, and when we first put on our new frocks I was struck with the\r\nfact that we were wearing red and green--the colours of the Liberal\r\nparty. Since our father was a Liberal, of course the Liberal party ought\r\nto carry the election, and I conceived a brilliant scheme for helping\r\nits progress. With my small sister trotting after me, I walked the\r\nbetter part of a mile to the nearest polling-booth. It happened to be in\r\na rather rough factory district, but we did not notice that. Arrived\r\nthere, we two children picked up our green skirts to show our scarlet\r\npetticoats, and brimful of importance, walked up and down before the\r\nassembled crowds to encourage the Liberal vote. From this eminence we\r\nwere shortly snatched by outraged authority in the form of a\r\nnursery-maid. I believe we were sent to bed into the bargain, but I am\r\nnot entirely clear on this point.\r\n\r\nI was fourteen years old when I went to my first suffrage meeting.\r\nReturning from school one day, I met my mother just setting out for the\r\nmeeting, and I begged her to let me go along. She consented, and without\r\nstopping to lay my books down I scampered away in my mother's wake. The\r\nspeeches interested and excited me, especially the address of the great\r\nMiss Lydia Becker, who was the Susan B. Anthony of the English movement,\r\na splendid character and a truly eloquent speaker. She was the secretary\r\nof the Manchester committee, and I had learned to admire her as the\r\neditor of the _Women's Suffrage Journal_, which came to my mother every\r\nweek. I left the meeting a conscious and confirmed suffragist.\r\n\r\nI suppose I had always been an unconscious suffragist. With my\r\ntemperament and my surroundings I could scarcely have been otherwise.\r\nThe movement was very much alive in the early seventies, nowhere more so\r\nthan in Manchester, where it was organised by a group of extraordinary\r\nmen and women. Among them were Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Bright, who were\r\nalways ready to champion the struggling cause. Mr. Jacob Bright, a\r\nbrother of John Bright, was for many years member of Parliament for\r\nManchester, and to the day of his death was an active supporter of woman\r\nsuffrage. Two especially gifted women, besides Miss Becker, were members\r\nof the committee. These were Mrs. Alice Cliff Scatcherd and Miss\r\nWolstentholm, now the venerable Mrs. Wolstentholm-Elmy. One of the\r\nprincipal founders of the committee was the man whose wife, in later\r\nyears, I was destined to become, Dr. Richard Marsden Pankhurst.\r\n\r\nWhen I was fifteen years old I went to Paris, where I was entered as a\r\npupil in one of the pioneer institutions in Europe for the higher\r\neducation of girls. This school, one of the founders of which was Madame\r\nEdmond Adam, who was and is still a distinguished literary figure, was\r\nsituated in a fine old house in the Avenue de Neuilly. It was under the\r\ndirection of Mlle. Marchef-Girard, a woman distinguished in education,\r\nand who afterward was appointed government inspector of schools in\r\nFrance. Mlle. Marchef-Girard believed that girls' education should be\r\nquite as thorough and even more practical than the education boys were\r\nreceiving at that time. She included chemistry and other sciences in her\r\ncourses, and in addition to embroidery she had her girls taught\r\nbookkeeping. Many other advanced ideas prevailed in this school, and the\r\nmoral discipline which the pupils received was, to my mind, as valuable\r\nas the intellectual training. Mlle. Marchef-Girard held that women\r\nshould be given the highest ideals of honour. Her pupils were kept to\r\nthe strictest principles of truth-telling and candour. Myself she\r\nunderstood and greatly benefited by an implicit trust which I am sure I\r\ncould not have betrayed, even had I felt for her less real affection.\r\n\r\nMy roommate in this delightful school was an interesting young girl of\r\nmy own age, Noemie Rochefort, daughter of that great Republican,\r\nCommunist, journalist, and swordsman, Henri Rochefort. This was very\r\nshortly after the Franco-Prussian War, and memories of the Empire's\r\nfall and of the bloody and disastrous Commune were very keen in Paris.\r\nIndeed my roommate's illustrious father and many others were then in\r\nexile in New Caledonia for participation in the Commune. My friend\r\nNoemie was torn with anxiety for her father. She talked of him\r\nconstantly, and many were the blood-curdling accounts of daring and of\r\npatriotism to which I listened. Henri Rochefort was, in fact, one of the\r\nmoving spirits of the Republican movement in France, and after his\r\namazing escape in an open boat from New Caledonia, he lived through many\r\nyears of political adventures of the most lively and picturesque\r\ncharacter. His daughter and I remained warm friends long after our\r\nschool-days ended, and my association with her strengthened all the\r\nliberal ideas I had previously acquired.\r\n\r\nI was between eighteen and nineteen when I finally returned from school\r\nin Paris and took my place in my father's home as a finished young lady.\r\nI sympathised with and worked for the woman-suffrage movement, and came\r\nto know Dr. Pankhurst, whose work for woman suffrage had never ceased.\r\nIt was Dr. Pankhurst who drafted the first enfranchisement bill, known\r\nas the Women's Disabilities Removal Bill, and introduced into the House\r\nof Commons in 1870 by Mr. Jacob Bright. The bill advanced to its second\r\nreading by a majority vote of thirty-three, but it was killed in\r\ncommittee by Mr. Gladstone's peremptory orders. Dr. Pankhurst, as I have\r\nalready said, with another distinguished barrister, Lord Coleridge,\r\nacted as counsel for the Manchester women, who tried in 1868 to be\r\nplaced on the register as voters. He also drafted the bill giving\r\nmarried women absolute control over their property and earnings, a bill\r\nwhich became law in 1882.\r\n\r\nMy marriage with Dr. Pankhurst took place in 1879.\r\n\r\nI think we cannot be too grateful to the group of men and women who,\r\nlike Dr. Pankhurst, in those early days lent the weight of their\r\nhonoured names to the suffrage movement in the trials of its struggling\r\nyouth. These men did not wait until the movement became popular, nor did\r\nthey hesitate until it was plain that women were roused to the point of\r\nrevolt. They worked all their lives with those who were organising,\r\neducating, and preparing for the revolt which was one day to come.\r\nUnquestionably those pioneer men suffered in popularity for their\r\nfeminist views. Some of them suffered financially, some politically. Yet\r\nthey never wavered.\r\n\r\nMy married life lasted through nineteen happy years. Often I have heard\r\nthe taunt that suffragists are women who have failed to find any normal\r\noutlet for their emotions, and are therefore soured and disappointed\r\nbeings. This is probably not true of any suffragist, and it is most\r\ncertainly not true of me. My home life and relations have been as nearly\r\nideal as possible in this imperfect world. About a year after my\r\nmarriage my daughter Christabel was born, and in another eighteen months\r\nmy second daughter Sylvia came. Two other children followed, and for\r\nsome years I was rather deeply immersed in my domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nI was never so absorbed with home and children, however, that I lost\r\ninterest in community affairs. Dr. Pankhurst did not desire that I\r\nshould turn myself into a household machine. It was his firm belief that\r\nsociety as well as the family stands in need of women's services. So\r\nwhile my children were still in their cradles I was serving on the\r\nexecutive committee of the Women's Suffrage Society, and also on the\r\nexecutive board of the committee which was working to secure the Married\r\nWomen's Property Act. This act having passed in 1882, I threw myself\r\ninto the suffrage work with renewed energy. A new Reform Act, known as\r\nthe County Franchise Bill, extending the suffrage to farm labourers, was\r\nunder discussion, and we believed that our years of educational\r\npropaganda work had prepared the country to support us in a demand for a\r\nwomen's suffrage amendment to the bill. For several years we had been\r\nholding the most splendid meetings in cities all over the kingdom. The\r\ncrowds, the enthusiasm, the generous response to appeals for support,\r\nall these seemed to justify us in our belief that women's suffrage was\r\nnear. In fact, in 1884, when the County Franchise Bill came before the\r\ncountry, we had an actual majority in favour of suffrage in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nBut a favourable majority in the House of Commons by no means insures\r\nthe success of any measure. I shall explain this at length when I come\r\nto our work of opposing candidates who have avowed themselves\r\nsuffragists, a course which has greatly puzzled our American friends.\r\nThe Liberal party was in power in 1884, and a great memorial was sent\r\nto the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable William E. Gladstone, asking\r\nthat a women's suffrage amendment to the County Franchise Bill be\r\nsubmitted to the free and unbiased consideration of the House. Mr.\r\nGladstone curtly refused, declaring that if a women's suffrage amendment\r\nshould be carried, the Government would disclaim responsibility for the\r\nbill. The amendment was submitted nevertheless, but Mr. Gladstone would\r\nnot allow it to be freely discussed, and he ordered Liberal members to\r\nvote against it. What we call a whip was sent out against it, a note\r\nvirtually commanding party members to be on hand at a certain hour to\r\nvote against the women's amendment. Undismayed, the women tried to have\r\nan independent suffrage bill introduced, but Mr. Gladstone so arranged\r\nParliamentary business that the bill never even came up for discussion.\r\n\r\nI am not going to write a history of the woman suffrage movement in\r\nEngland prior to 1903, when the Women's Social and Political Union was\r\norganised. That history is full of repetitions of just such stories as\r\nthe one I have related. Gladstone was an implacable foe of woman\r\nsuffrage. He believed that women's work and politics lay in service to\r\nmen's parties. One of the shrewdest acts of Mr. Gladstone's career was\r\nhis disruption of the suffrage organisation in England. He accomplished\r\nthis by substituting \"something just as good,\" that something being\r\nWomen's Liberal Associations. Beginning in 1881 in Bristol, these\r\nassociations spread rapidly through the country and, in 1887, became a\r\nNational Women's Liberal Federation. The promise of the Federation was\r\nthat by allying themselves with men in party politics, women would soon\r\nearn the right to vote. The avidity with which the women swallowed this\r\npromise, left off working for themselves, and threw themselves into the\r\nmen's work was amazing.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Liberal Federation is an organisation of women who believe\r\nin the principles of the Liberal party. (The somewhat older Primrose\r\nLeague is a similar organisation of women who adhere to Conservative\r\nparty principles.) Neither of these organisations have woman suffrage\r\nfor their object. They came into existence to uphold party ideas and to\r\nwork for the election of party candidates.\r\n\r\nI am told that women in America have recently allied themselves with\r\npolitical parties, believing, just as we did, that such action would\r\nbreak down opposition to suffrage by showing the men that women possess\r\npolitical ability, and that politics is work for women as well as men.\r\nLet them not be deceived. I can assure the American women that our long\r\nalliance with the great parties, our devotion to party programmes, our\r\nfaithful work at elections, never advanced the suffrage cause one step.\r\nThe men accepted the services of the women, but they never offered any\r\nkind of payment.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned, I did not delude myself with any false hopes\r\nin the matter. I was present when the Women's Liberal Federation came\r\ninto existence. Mrs. Gladstone presided, offering the meeting many\r\nconsolatory words for the absence of \"our great leader,\" Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwho of course had no time to waste on a gathering of women. At Mrs.\r\nJacob Bright's request I joined the Federation. At this stage of my\r\ndevelopment I was a member of the Fabian Society, and I had considerable\r\nfaith in the permeating powers of its mild socialism. But I was already\r\nfairly convinced of the futility of trusting to political parties. Even\r\nas a child I had begun to wonder at the _naive_ faith of party members\r\nin the promises of their leaders. I well remember my father returning\r\nhome from political meetings, his face aglow with enthusiasm. \"What\r\nhappened, father?\" I would ask, and he would reply triumphantly, \"Ah! We\r\npassed the resolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll get your measure through the next session,\" I predicted.\r\n\r\n\"I won't say that,\" was the usual reply. \"Things don't always move as\r\nquickly as that. But we passed the resolution.\"\r\n\r\nWell, the suffragists, when they were admitted into the Women's Liberal\r\nFederation must have felt that they had passed their resolution. They\r\nsettled down to work for the party and to prove that they were as\r\ncapable of voting as the recently enfranchised farm labourers. Of course\r\na few women remained loyal to suffrage. They began again on the old\r\neducational lines to work for the cause. Not one woman took counsel with\r\nherself as to how and why the agricultural labourers had won their\r\nfranchise. They had won it, as a matter of fact, by burning hay-ricks,\r\nrioting, and otherwise demonstrating their strength in the only way that\r\nEnglish politicians can understand. The threat to march a hundred\r\nthousand men to the House of Commons unless the bill was passed played\r\nits part also in securing the agricultural labourer his political\r\nfreedom. But no woman suffragist noticed that. As for myself, I was too\r\nyoung politically to learn the lesson then. I had to go through years of\r\npublic work before I acquired the experience and the wisdom to know how\r\nto wring concessions from the English Government. I had to hold public\r\noffice. I had to go behind the scenes in the government schools, in the\r\nworkhouses and other charitable institutions; I had to get a close-hand\r\nview of the misery and unhappiness of a man-made world, before I reached\r\nthe point where I could successfully revolt against it. It was almost\r\nimmediately after the collapse of the woman suffrage movement in 1884\r\nthat I entered upon this new phase of my career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1885, a year after the failure of the third women's suffrage bill, my\r\nhusband, Dr. Pankhurst, stood as the Liberal candidate for Parliament in\r\nRotherline, a riverside constituency of London. I went through the\r\ncampaign with him, speaking and canvassing to the best of my ability.\r\nDr. Pankhurst was a popular candidate, and unquestionably would have\r\nbeen returned but for the opposition of the Home-Rulers. Parnell was in\r\ncommand, and his settled policy was opposition to all Government\r\ncandidates. So, in spite of the fact that Dr. Pankhurst was a staunch\r\nupholder of home rule, the Parnell forces were solidly opposed to him,\r\nand he was defeated. I remember expressing considerable indignation, but\r\nmy husband pointed out to me that Parnell's policy was absolutely right.\r\nWith his small party he could never hope to win home rule from a hostile\r\nmajority, but by constant obstruction he could in time wear out the\r\nGovernment, and force it to surrender. That was a valuable political\r\nlesson, one that years later I was destined to put into practice.\r\n\r\nThe following year found us living in London, and, as usual, interesting\r\nourselves with labour matters and other social movements. This year was\r\nmemorable for a great strike of women working in the Bryant and May\r\nmatch factories. I threw myself into this strike with enthusiasm,\r\nworking with the girls and with some women of prominence, among these\r\nthe celebrated Mrs. Annie Besant. The strike was a successful one, the\r\ngirls winning substantial improvements in their working conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of tremendous unrest, of labour agitations, of strikes and\r\nlockouts. It was a time also when a most stupid reactionary spirit\r\nseemed to take possession of the Government and the authorities. The\r\nSalvation Army, the Socialists, the trade-unionists--in fact, all bodies\r\nholding outdoor meetings--were made special objects of attack. As a\r\nprotest against this policy a Law and Liberty League was formed in\r\nLondon, and an immense Free Speech meeting was held in Trafalgar Square,\r\nJohn Burns and Cunningham Graham being the principal speakers. I was\r\npresent at this meeting, which resulted in a bloody riot between the\r\npolice and the populace. The Trafalgar Square Riot is historic, and to\r\nit Mr. John Burns owes, in large part, his subsequent rise to political\r\neminence. Both John Burns and Cunningham Graham served prison sentences\r\nfor the part they played in the riot, but they gained fame, and they did\r\nmuch to establish the right of free speech for English men. English\r\nwomen are still contending for that right.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 my last child was born in London. I now had a family of five\r\nyoung children, and for a time I was less active in public work. On the\r\nretirement of Mrs. Annie Besant from the London School Board I had been\r\nasked to stand as candidate for the vacancy, but although I should have\r\nenjoyed the work, I decided not to accept this invitation. The next\r\nyear, however, a new suffrage association, the Women's Franchise League,\r\nwas formed, and I felt it my duty to become affiliated with it The\r\nLeague was preparing a new suffrage bill, the provisions of which I\r\ncould not possibly approve, and I joined with old friends, among whom\r\nwere Mrs. Jacob Bright, Mrs. Wolstentholm-Elmy, who was a member of the\r\nLondon School Board, and Mrs. Stanton Blatch, then resident in England,\r\nin an effort to substitute the original bill drafted by Dr. Pankhurst.\r\nAs a matter of fact, neither of the bills was introduced into Parliament\r\nthat year. Mr. (now Lord) Haldane, who had the measure in charge,\r\nintroduced one of his own drafting. It was a truly startling bill,\r\nroyally inclusive in its terms. It not only enfranchised all women,\r\nmarried and unmarried, of the householding classes, but it made them\r\neligible to all offices under the Crown. The bill was never taken\r\nseriously by the Government, and indeed it was never intended that it\r\nshould be, as we were later made to understand. I remember going with\r\nMrs. Stanton Blatch to the law courts to see Mr. Haldane, and to protest\r\nagainst the introduction of a measure that had not the remotest chance\r\nof passing.\r\n\r\n\"All, that bill,\" said Haldane, \"is for the future.\"\r\n\r\nAll their woman suffrage bills are intended for the future, a future so\r\nremote as to be imperceptible. We were beginning to understand this even\r\nin 1891. However, as long as there was a bill, we determined to support\r\nit. Accordingly, we canvassed the members, distributed a great deal of\r\nliterature, and organised and addressed meetings. We not only made\r\nspeeches ourselves, but we induced friendly members of Parliament to go\r\non our platforms. One of these meetings, held in an East End Radical\r\nclub, was addressed by Mr. Haldane and a young man who accompanied him.\r\nThis young man, Sir Edward Grey, then in the beginning of his career,\r\nmade an eloquent plea for woman's suffrage. That Sir Edward Grey should,\r\nlater in life, become a bitter foe of woman's suffrage need astonish no\r\none. I have known many young Englishmen who began their political life\r\nas suffrage speakers and who later became anti-suffragists or traitorous\r\n\"friends\" of the cause. These young and aspiring statesmen have to\r\nattract attention in some fashion, and the espousal of advanced causes,\r\nsuch as labour or women's suffrage, seems an easy way to accomplish that\r\nend.\r\n\r\nWell, our speeches and our agitation did nothing at all to assist Mr.\r\nHaldane's impossible bill. It never advanced beyond the first reading.\r\n\r\nOur London residence came to an end in 1893. In that year we returned to\r\nour Manchester home, and I again took up the work of the Suffrage\r\nSociety. At my suggestion the members began to organise their first\r\nout-of-door meetings, and we continued these until we succeeded in\r\nworking up a great meeting that filled Free Trade Hall, and overflowed\r\ninto and crowded a smaller hall near at hand. This marked the beginning\r\nof a campaign of propaganda among working people, an object which I had\r\nlong desired to bring about.\r\n\r\nAnd now began a new and, as I look back on it, an absorbingly\r\ninteresting stage of my career. I have told how our leaders in the\r\nLiberal Party had advised the women to prove their fitness for the\r\nParliamentary franchise by serving in municipal offices, especially the\r\nunsalaried offices. A large number of women had availed themselves of\r\nthis advice, and were serving on Boards of Guardians, on school boards,\r\nand in other capacities. My children now being old enough for me to\r\nleave them with competent nurses, I was free to join these ranks. A year\r\nafter my return to Manchester I became a candidate for the Board of Poor\r\nLaw Guardians. Several weeks before, I had contested unsuccessfully for\r\na place on the school board. This time, however, I was elected, heading\r\nthe poll by a very large majority.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of American readers I shall explain something of the\r\noperation of our English Poor Law. The duty of the law is to administer\r\nan act of Queen Elizabeth, one of the greatest reforms effected by that\r\nwise and humane monarch. When Elizabeth came to the throne she found\r\nEngland, the Merrie England of contemporary poets, in a state of\r\nappalling poverty. Hordes of people were literally starving to death, in\r\nwretched hovels, in the streets, and at the very gates of the palace.\r\nThe cause of all this misery was the religious reformation under Henry\r\nVIII, and the secession from Rome of the English Church. King Henry, it\r\nis known, seized all the Church lands, the abbeys and the convents, and\r\ngave them as rewards to those nobles and favourites who had supported\r\nhis policies. But in taking over the Church's property the Protestant\r\nnobles by no means assumed the Church's ancient responsibilities of\r\nlodging wayfarers, giving alms, nursing the sick, educating youths, and\r\ncaring for the young and the superannuated. When the monks and the nuns\r\nwere turned out of their convents these duties devolved on no one. The\r\nresult, after the brief reign of Edward VI and the bloody one of Queen\r\nMary, was the social anarchy inherited by Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThis great queen and great woman, perceiving that the responsibility for\r\nthe poor and the helpless rightfully rests on the community, caused an\r\nact to be passed creating in the parishes public bodies to deal with\r\nlocal conditions of poverty. The Board of Poor Law Guardians disburses\r\nfor the poor the money coming from the Poor Rates (taxes), and some\r\nadditional moneys allowed by the local government board, the president\r\nof which is a cabinet minister. Mr. John Burns is the present incumbent\r\nof the office. The Board of Guardians has control of the institution we\r\ncall the workhouse. You have, I believe, almshouses, or poorhouses, but\r\nthey are not quite so extensive as our workhouses, which are all kinds\r\nof institutions in one. We had, in my workhouse, a hospital with nine\r\nhundred beds, a school with several hundred children, a farm, and many\r\nworkshops.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into office I found that the law in our district, Chorlton,\r\nwas being very harshly administered. The old board had been made up of\r\nthe kind of men who are known as rate savers. They were guardians, not\r\nof the poor but of the rates, and, as I soon discovered, not very astute\r\nguardians even of money. For instance, although the inmates were being\r\nvery poorly fed, a frightful waste of food was apparent. Each inmate was\r\ngiven each day a certain weight of food, and bread formed so much of the\r\nration that hardly anyone consumed all of his portion. In the farm\r\ndepartment pigs were kept on purpose to consume this surplus of bread,\r\nand as pigs do not thrive on a solid diet of stale bread the animals\r\nfetched in the market a much lower price than properly fed farm pigs. I\r\nsuggested that, instead of giving a solid weight of bread in one lump,\r\nthe loaf be cut in slices and buttered with margarine, each person being\r\nallowed all that he cared to eat. The rest of the board objected, saying\r\nthat our poor charges were very jealous of their rights, and would\r\nsuspect in such an innovation an attempt to deprive them of a part of\r\ntheir ration. This was easily overcome by the suggestion that we consult\r\nthe inmates before we made the change. Of course the poor people\r\nconsented, and with the bread that we saved we made puddings with milk\r\nand currants, to be fed to the old people of the workhouse. These old\r\nfolks I found sitting on backless forms, or benches. They had no\r\nprivacy, no possessions, not even a locker. The old women were without\r\npockets in their gowns, so they were obliged to keep any poor little\r\ntreasures they had in their bosoms. Soon after I took office we gave the\r\nold people comfortable Windsor chairs to sit in, and in a number of ways\r\nwe managed to make their existence more endurable.\r\n\r\nThese, after all, were minor benefits. But it does gratify me when I\r\nlook back and remember what we were able to do for the children of the\r\nManchester workhouse. The first time I went into the place I was\r\nhorrified to see little girls seven and eight years old on their knees\r\nscrubbing the cold stones of the long corridors. These little girls were\r\nclad, summer and winter, in thin cotton frocks, low in the neck and\r\nshort sleeved. At night they wore nothing at all, night dresses being\r\nconsidered too good for paupers. The fact that bronchitis was epidemic\r\namong them most of the time had not suggested to the guardians any\r\nchange in the fashion of their clothes. There was a school for the\r\nchildren, but the teaching was of the poorest order. They were forlorn\r\nenough, these poor innocents, when I first met them. In five years' time\r\nwe had changed the face of the earth for them. We had bought land in the\r\ncountry and had built a cottage system home for the children, and we had\r\nestablished for them a modern school with trained teachers. We had even\r\nsecured for them a gymnasium and a swimming-bath. I may say that I was\r\non the building committee of the board, the only woman member.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be urged against the English Poor Law system, I maintain\r\nthat under it no stigma of pauperism need be applied to workhouse\r\nchildren. If they are treated like paupers of course they will be\r\npaupers, and they will grow up paupers, permanent burdens on society;\r\nbut if they are regarded merely as children under the guardianship of\r\nthe state, they assume quite another character. Rich children are not\r\npauperized by being sent to one or another of the free public schools\r\nwith which England is blest. Yet a great many of those schools, now\r\nexclusively used for the education of upper middle-class boys, were\r\nfounded by legacies left to educate the poor--girls as well as boys. The\r\nEnglish Poor Law, properly administered, ought to give back to the\r\nchildren of the destitute what the upper classes have taken from them, a\r\ngood education on a self-respecting basis.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, as I soon perceived after taking office, the law cannot,\r\nin existing circumstances, do all the work, even for children, that it\r\nwas intended to do. We shall have to have new laws, and it soon became\r\napparent to me that we can never hope to get them until women have the\r\nvote. During the time I served on the board, and for years since then,\r\nwomen guardians all over the country have striven in vain to have the\r\nlaw reformed in order to ameliorate conditions which break the hearts of\r\nwomen to see, but which apparently affect men very little. I have spoken\r\nof the little girls I found scrubbing the workhouse floors. There were\r\nothers at the hateful labour who aroused my keenest pity. I found that\r\nthere were pregnant women in that workhouse, scrubbing floors, doing the\r\nhardest kind of work, almost until their babies came into the world.\r\nMany of them were unmarried women, very, very young, mere girls. These\r\npoor mothers were allowed to stay in the hospital after confinement for\r\na short two weeks. Then they had to make a choice of staying in the\r\nworkhouse and earning their living by scrubbing and other work, in\r\nwhich case they were separated from their babies; or of taking their\r\ndischarges. They could stay and be paupers, or they could leave--leave\r\nwith a two-weeks-old baby in their arms, without hope, without home,\r\nwithout money, without anywhere to go. What became of those girls, and\r\nwhat became of their hapless infants? That question was at the basis of\r\nthe women guardians' demand for a reform of one part of the Poor Law.\r\n\r\nThat section deals with the little children who are boarded out, not by\r\nthe workhouse, but by the parents, that parent being almost always the\r\nmother. It is from that class of workhouse mothers--mostly young servant\r\ngirls--which thoughtless people say all working girls ought to be; it is\r\nfrom that class more than from any other that cases of illegitimacy\r\ncome. Those poor little servant girls, who can get out perhaps only in\r\nthe evening, whose minds are not very cultivated, and who find all the\r\nsentiment of their lives in cheap novelettes, fall an easy prey to those\r\nwho have designs against them. These are the people by whom the babies\r\nare mostly put out to nurse, and the mothers have to pay for their keep.\r\nOf course the babies are very badly protected. The Poor Law Guardians\r\nare supposed to protect them by appointing inspectors to visit the homes\r\nwhere the babies are boarded. But, under the law, if a man who ruins a\r\ngirl pays down a lump sum of twenty pounds, less than a hundred dollars,\r\nthe boarding home is immune from inspection. As long as a baby-farmer\r\ntakes only one child at a time, the twenty pounds being paid, the\r\ninspectors cannot inspect the house. Of course the babies die with\r\nhideous promptness, often long before the twenty pounds have been spent,\r\nand then the baby-farmers are free to solicit another victim. For years,\r\nas I have said, women have tried in vain to get that one small reform of\r\nthe Poor Law, to reach and protect all illegitimate children, and to\r\nmake it impossible for any rich scoundrel to escape future liability for\r\nhis child because of the lump sum he has paid down. Over and over again\r\nit has been tried, but it has always failed, because the ones who really\r\ncare about the thing are mere women.\r\n\r\nI thought I had been a suffragist before I became a Poor Law Guardian,\r\nbut now I began to think about the vote in women's hands not only as a\r\nright but as a desperate necessity. These poor, unprotected mothers and\r\ntheir babies I am sure were potent factors in my education as a\r\nmilitant. In fact, all the women I came in contact with in the workhouse\r\ncontributed to that education. Very soon after I went on the board I saw\r\nthat the class of old women who came into the workhouse were in many\r\nways superior to the kind of old men who came into the workhouse. One\r\ncould not help noticing it. They were, to begin with, more industrious.\r\nIn fact, it was quite touching to see their industry and patience. Old\r\nwomen, over sixty and seventy years of age, did most of the work of that\r\nplace, most of the sewing, most of the things that kept the house clean\r\nand which supplied the inmates with clothing. I found that the old men\r\nwere different. One could not get very much work out of them. They liked\r\nto stop in the oakum picking-room, where they were allowed to smoke;\r\nbut as to real work, very little was done by our old men.\r\n\r\nI began to make inquiries about these old women. I found that the\r\nmajority of them were not women who had been dissolute, who had been\r\ncriminal, but women who had lead perfectly respectable lives, either as\r\nwives and mothers, or as single women earning their own living. A great\r\nmany were of the domestic-servant class, who had not married, who had\r\nlost their employment, and had reached a time of life when it was\r\nimpossible to get more employment. It was through no fault of their own,\r\nbut simply because they had never earned enough to save. The average\r\nwage of working women in England is less than two dollars a week. On\r\nthis pittance it is difficult enough to keep alive, and of course it is\r\nimpossible to save. Every one who knows anything about conditions under\r\nwhich our working women live knows that few of them can ever hope to put\r\nby enough to keep them in old age. Besides, the average working woman\r\nhas to support others than herself. How can she save?\r\n\r\nSome of our old women were married. Many of them, I found, were widows\r\nof skilled artisans who had had pensions from their unions, but the\r\npensions had died with the men. These women, who had given up the power\r\nto work for themselves, and had devoted themselves to working for their\r\nhusbands and children, were left penniless. There was nothing for them\r\nto do but to go into the workhouse. Many of them were widows of men who\r\nhad served their country in the army or the navy. The men had had\r\npensions from the government, but the pensions had died with them, and\r\nso the women were in the workhouse.\r\n\r\nWe shall not in future, I hope, find so many respectable old women in\r\nEnglish workhouses. We have an old-age pension law now, which allows old\r\nwomen as well as old men the sum of five shillings--$1.20--a week;\r\nhardly enough to live on, but enough to enable the poor to keep their\r\nold fathers and mothers out of the workhouse without starving themselves\r\nor their children. But when I was a Poor Law Guardian there was simply\r\nnothing to do with a woman when her life of toil ceased except make a\r\npauper of her.\r\n\r\nI wish I had space to tell you of other tragedies of women I witnessed\r\nwhile I was on that board. In our out-relief department, which exists\r\nchiefly for able-bodied poor and dependent persons, I was brought into\r\ncontact with widows who were struggling desperately to keep their homes\r\nand families together. The law allowed these women relief of a certain\r\nvery inadequate kind, but for herself and one child it offered no relief\r\nexcept the workhouse. Even if the woman had a baby at her breast she was\r\nregarded, under the law, as an able-bodied man. Women, we are told,\r\nshould stay at home and take care of their children. I used to astound\r\nmy men colleagues by saying to them: \"When women have the vote they will\r\nsee that mothers _can_ stay at home and care for their children. You men\r\nhave made it impossible for these mothers to do that.\"\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the enfranchised woman will find many ways in which\r\nto lessen, at least, the curse of poverty. Women have more practical\r\nideas about relief, and especially of prevention of dire poverty, than\r\nmen display. I was struck with this whenever I attended the District\r\nConferences and the annual Poor Law Union Meetings. In our discussions\r\nthe women showed themselves much more capable, much more resourceful,\r\nthan the men. I remember two papers which I prepared and which caused\r\nconsiderable discussion. One of these was on the Duties of Guardians in\r\nTimes of Unemployment, in which I pointed out that the government had\r\none reserve of employment for men which could always be used. We have,\r\non our northwest coast, a constant washing away of the fore shore. Every\r\nonce in a while the question of coast reclamation comes up for\r\ndiscussion, but I had never heard any man suggest coast reclamation as a\r\nmeans of giving the unemployed relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1898 I suffered an irreparable loss in the death of my husband. His\r\ndeath occurred suddenly and left me with the heavy responsibility of\r\ncaring for a family of children, the eldest only seventeen years of age.\r\nI resigned my place on the Board of Guardians, and was almost\r\nimmediately appointed to the salaried office of Registrar of Births and\r\nDeaths in Manchester. We have registrars of births, deaths and marriages\r\nin England, but since the act establishing the last named contains the\r\nwords \"male person,\" a woman may not be appointed a registrar of\r\nmarriages. The head of this department of the government is the\r\nregistrar-general, with offices at Somerset House, London, where all\r\nvital statistics are returned and all records filed.\r\n\r\nIt was my duty as registrar of births and deaths to act as chief census\r\nofficer of my district; I was obliged to receive all returns of births\r\nand deaths, record them, and send my books quarterly to the office of\r\nthe registrar-general. My district was in a working-class quarter, and\r\non this account I instituted evening office hours twice a week. It was\r\ntouching to observe how glad the women were to have a woman registrar to\r\ngo to. They used to tell me their stories, dreadful stories some of\r\nthem, and all of them pathetic with that patient and uncomplaining\r\npathos of poverty. Even after my experience on the Board of Guardians, I\r\nwas shocked to be reminded over and over again of the little respect\r\nthere was in the world for women and children. I have had little girls\r\nof thirteen come to my office to register the births of their babies,\r\nillegitimate, of course. In many of these cases I found that the child's\r\nown father or some near male relative was responsible for her state.\r\nThere was nothing that could be done in most cases. The age of consent\r\nin England is sixteen years, but a man can always claim that he thought\r\nthe girl was over sixteen. During my term of office a very young mother\r\nof an illegitimate child exposed her baby, and it died. The girl was\r\ntried for murder and was sentenced to death. This was afterwards\r\ncommuted, it is true, but the unhappy child had the horrible experience\r\nof the trial and the sentence \"to be hanged by the neck, until you are\r\ndead.\" The wretch who was, from the point of view of justice, the real\r\nmurderer of the baby, received no punishment at all.\r\n\r\nI needed only one more experience after this one, only one more contact\r\nwith the life of my time and the position of women, to convince me that\r\nif civilisation is to advance at all in the future, it must be through\r\nthe help of women, women freed of their political shackles, women with\r\nfull power to work their will in society. In 1900 I was asked to stand\r\nas a candidate for the Manchester School Board. The schools were then\r\nunder the old law, and the school boards were very active bodies. They\r\nadministered the Elementary Education Act, bought school sites, erected\r\nbuildings, employed and paid teachers. The school code and the\r\ncurriculum were framed by the Board of Education, which is part of the\r\ncentral government. Of course this was absurd. A body of men in London\r\ncould not possibly realise all the needs of boys and girls in remote\r\nparts of England. But so it was.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the school board I very soon found that the teachers,\r\nworking people of the higher grade, were in exactly the same position as\r\nthe working people of the lower grades. That is, the men had all the\r\nadvantage. Teachers had a representative in the school board councils.\r\nOf course that representative was a man teacher, and equally of course,\r\nhe gave preference to the interests of the men teachers. Men teachers\r\nreceived much higher salaries than the women, although many of the\r\nwomen, in addition to their regular class work, had to teach sewing and\r\ndomestic science into the bargain. They received no extra pay for their\r\nextra work. In spite of this added burden, and in spite of the lower\r\nsalaries received, I found that the women cared a great deal more about\r\ntheir work, and a great deal more about the children than the men. It\r\nwas a winter when there was a great deal of poverty and unemployment in\r\nManchester. I found that the women teachers were spending their slender\r\nsalaries to provide regular dinners for destitute children, and were\r\ngiving up their time to waiting on them and seeing that they were\r\nnourished. They said to me, quite simply: \"You see, the little things\r\nare too badly off to study their lessons. We have to feed them before we\r\ncan teach them.\"\r\n\r\nWell, instead of seeing that women care more for schools and school\r\nchildren than men do and should therefore have more power in education,\r\nthe Parliament of 1900 actually passed a law which took education in\r\nEngland entirely out of the hands of women. This law abolished the\r\nschool board altogether and placed the administration of schools in the\r\nhands of the municipalities. Certain corporations had formerly made\r\ncertain grants to technical education--Manchester had built a\r\nmagnificent technical college--and now the corporations had full control\r\nof both elementary and secondary education.\r\n\r\nThe law did indeed provide that the corporations should co-opt at least\r\none woman on their education boards. Manchester co-opted four women, and\r\nat the strong recommendation of the Labour Party, I was one of the\r\nwomen chosen. At their urgent solicitation I was appointed to the\r\nCommittee on Technical Instruction, the one woman admitted to this\r\ncommittee. I learned that the Manchester Technical College, called the\r\nsecond best in Europe, spending thousands of pounds annually for\r\ntechnical training, had practically no provision for training women.\r\nEven in classes where they might easily have been admitted, bakery and\r\nconfectionery classes and the like, the girls were kept out because the\r\nmen's trades unions objected to their being educated for such skilled\r\nwork. It was rapidly becoming clear to my mind that men regarded women\r\nas a servant class in the community, and that women were going to remain\r\nin the servant class until they lifted themselves out of it. I asked\r\nmyself many times in those days what was to be done. I had joined the\r\nLabour Party, thinking that through its councils something vital might\r\ncome, some such demand for the women's enfranchisement that the\r\npoliticians could not possibly ignore. Nothing came.\r\n\r\nAll these years my daughters had been growing up. All their lives they\r\nhad been interested in women's suffrage. Christabel and Sylvia, as\r\nlittle girls, had cried to be taken to meetings. They had helped in our\r\ndrawing-room meetings in every way that children can help. As they grew\r\nolder we used to talk together about the suffrage, and I was sometimes\r\nrather frightened by their youthful confidence in the prospect, which\r\nthey considered certain, of the success of the movement. One day\r\nChristabel startled me with the remark: \"How long you women have been\r\ntrying for the vote. For my part, I mean to get it.\"\r\n\r\nWas there, I reflected, any difference between trying for the vote and\r\ngetting it? There is an old French proverb, \"If youth could know; if age\r\ncould do.\" It occurred to me that if the older suffrage workers could in\r\nsome way join hands with the young, unwearied and resourceful\r\nsuffragists, the movement might wake up to new life and new\r\npossibilities. After that I and my daughters together sought a way to\r\nbring about that union of young and old which would find new methods,\r\nblaze new trails. At length we thought we had found a way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1902--I think it was 1902--Susan B. Anthony paid a\r\nvisit to Manchester, and that visit was one of the contributory causes\r\nthat led to the founding of our militant suffrage organisation, the\r\nWomen's Social and Political Union. During Miss Anthony's visit my\r\ndaughter Christabel, who was very deeply impressed, wrote an article for\r\nthe Manchester papers on the life and works of the venerable reformer.\r\nAfter her departure Christabel spoke often of her, and always with\r\nsorrow and indignation that such a splendid worker for humanity was\r\ndestined to die without seeing the hopes of her lifetime realised. \"It\r\nis unendurable,\" declared my daughter, \"to think of another generation\r\nof women wasting their lives begging for the vote. We must not lose any\r\nmore time. We must act.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the Labour Party, of which I was still a member, had\r\nreturned Mr. Keir Hardie to Parliament, and we decided that the first\r\nstep in a campaign of action was to make the Labour Party responsible\r\nfor a new suffrage bill. At a recent annual conference of the party I\r\nhad moved a resolution calling upon the members to instruct their own\r\nmember of Parliament to introduce a bill for the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen. The resolution was passed, and we determined to organise a\r\nsociety of women to demand immediate enfranchisement, not by means of\r\nany outworn missionary methods, but through political action.\r\n\r\nIt was in October, 1903, that I invited a number of women to my house in\r\nNelson street, Manchester, for purposes of organisation. We voted to\r\ncall our new society the Women's Social and Political Union, partly to\r\nemphasise its democracy, and partly to define its object as political\r\nrather than propagandist. We resolved to limit our membership\r\nexclusively to women, to keep ourselves absolutely free from any party\r\naffiliation, and to be satisfied with nothing but action on our\r\nquestion. Deeds, not words, was to be our permanent motto.\r\n\r\nTo such a pass had the women's suffrage cause come in my country that\r\nthe old leaders, who had done such fine educational work in the past,\r\nwere now seemingly content with expressions of sympathy and regret on\r\nthe part of hypocritical politicians. This fact was thrust upon me anew\r\nby an incident that occurred almost at the moment of the founding of the\r\nWomen's Social and Political Union. In our Parliament no bill has a\r\nchance of becoming a law unless it is made a Government measure. Private\r\nmembers are at liberty to introduce measures of their own, but these\r\nrarely reach the second reading, or debatable stage. So much time is\r\ngiven to discussion of Government measures that very little time can be\r\ngiven to any private bills. About one day in a week is given over to\r\nconsideration of private measures, to which, as we say, the Government\r\ngive facilities; and since there are a limited number of weeks in a\r\nsession, the members, on the opening days of Parliament, meet and draw\r\nlots to determine who shall have a place in the debates. Only these\r\nsuccessful men have a chance to speak to their bills, and only those who\r\nhave drawn early chances have any prospect of getting much discussion on\r\ntheir measures.\r\n\r\nNow, the old suffragists had long since given up hope of obtaining a\r\nGovernment suffrage bill, but they clung to a hope that a private\r\nmember's bill would some time obtain consideration. Every year, on the\r\nopening day of Parliament, the association sent a deputation of women to\r\nthe House of Commons, to meet so-called friendly members and consider\r\nthe position of the women's suffrage cause. The ceremony was of a most\r\nconventional, not to say farcical character. The ladies made their\r\nspeeches and the members made theirs. The ladies thanked the friendly\r\nmembers for their sympathy, and the members renewed their assurances\r\nthat they believed in women's suffrage and would vote for it when they\r\nhad an opportunity to do so. Then the deputation, a trifle sad but\r\nentirely tranquil, took its departure, and the members resumed the real\r\nbusiness of life, which was support of their party's policies.\r\n\r\nSuch a ceremony as this I attended soon after the founding of the\r\nW. S. P. U. Sir Charles M'Laren was the friendly member who presided\r\nover the gathering, and he did his full duty in the matter of formally\r\nendorsing the cause of women's suffrage. He assured the delegation of\r\nhis deep regret, as well as the regret of numbers of his colleagues,\r\nthat women so intelligent, so devoted, etc., should remain\r\nunenfranchised. Other members did likewise. The ceremonies drew to a\r\nclose, but I, who had not been asked to speak, determined to add\r\nsomething to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Charles M'Laren,\" I began abruptly, \"has told us that numbers of\r\nhis colleagues desire the success of the women's suffrage cause. Now\r\nevery one of us knows that at this moment the members of the House of\r\nCommons are balloting for a place in the debates. Will Sir Charles\r\nM'Laren tell us if any member is preparing to introduce a bill for\r\nwomen's suffrage? Will he tell us what he and the other members will\r\npledge themselves to _do_ for the reform they so warmly endorse?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the embarrassed Sir Charles was not prepared to tell us\r\nanything of the kind, and the deputation departed in confusion and\r\nwrath. I was told that I was an interloper, an impertinent intruder. Who\r\nasked me to say anything? And what right had I to step in and ruin the\r\ngood impression they had made? No one could tell how many friendly\r\nmembers I had alienated by my unfortunate remarks.\r\n\r\nI went back to Manchester and with renewed energy continued the work of\r\norganising for the W. S. P. U.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1904 I went to the annual conference of the Independent\r\nLabour Party, determined if possible to induce the members to prepare a\r\nsuffrage bill to be laid before Parliament in the approaching session.\r\nAlthough I was a member of the National Administrative Council and\r\npresumably a person holding some influence in the party, I knew that my\r\nplan would be bitterly opposed by a strong minority, who held that the\r\nLabour Party should direct all its efforts toward securing universal\r\nadult suffrage for both men and women. Theoretically, of course, a\r\nLabour party could not be satisfied with anything less than universal\r\nadult suffrage, but it was clear that no such sweeping reform could be\r\neffected at that time, unless indeed the Government made it one of their\r\nmeasures. Besides, while a large majority of members of the House of\r\nCommons were pledged to support a bill giving women equal franchise\r\nrights with men, it was doubtful whether a majority could be relied upon\r\nto support a bill giving adult suffrage, even to men. Such a bill, even\r\nif it were a Government measure, would probably be difficult of passage.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable discussion, the National Council decided to adopt the\r\noriginal Women's Enfranchisement Bill, drafted by Dr. Pankhurst, and\r\nadvanced in 1870 to its second reading in the House of Commons. The\r\nCouncil's decision was approved by an overwhelming majority of the\r\nconference.\r\n\r\nThe new session of Parliament, so eagerly looked forward to, met on\r\nFebruary 13, 1905. I went down from Manchester, and with my daughter\r\nSylvia, then a student at the Royal College of Art, South Kensington,\r\nspent eight days in the Strangers' Lobby of the House of Commons,\r\nworking for the suffrage bill. We interviewed every one of the members\r\nwho had pledged themselves to support a suffrage bill when it should be\r\nintroduced, but we found not one single member who would agree that his\r\nchance in the ballot, if he drew such a chance, should be given to\r\nintroducing the bill. Every man had some other measure he was anxious to\r\nfurther. Mr. Keir Hardie had previously given us his pledge, but his\r\nname, as we had feared, was not drawn in the ballot. We next set out to\r\ninterview all the men whose names had been drawn, and we finally induced\r\nMr. Bamford Slack, who held the fourteenth place, to introduce our bill.\r\nThe fourteenth place was not a good one, but it served, and the second\r\nreading of our bill was set down for Friday, May 12th, the second order\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nThis being the first suffrage bill in eight years, a thrill of\r\nexcitement animated not only our ranks but all the old suffrage\r\nsocieties. Meetings were held, and a large number of petitions\r\ncirculated. When the day came for consideration on our bill, the\r\nStrangers' Lobby could not hold the enormous gathering of women of all\r\nclasses, rich and poor, who flocked to the House of Commons. It was\r\npitiful to see the look of hope and joy that shone on the faces of many\r\nof these women. We knew that our poor little measure had the very\r\nslightest chance of being passed. The bill that occupied the first order\r\nof the day was one providing that carts travelling along public roads at\r\nnight should carry a light behind as well as before. We had tried to\r\ninduce the promoters of this unimportant little measure to withdraw it\r\nin the interests of our bill, but they refused. We had tried also to\r\npersuade the Conservative Government to give our bill facilities for\r\nfull discussion, but they also refused. So, as we fully anticipated,\r\nthe promoters of the Roadway Lighting Bill were allowed to \"talk out\"\r\nour bill. They did this by spinning out the debate with silly stories\r\nand foolish jokes. The members listened to the insulting performance\r\nwith laughter and applause.\r\n\r\nWhen news of what was happening reached the women who waited in the\r\nStrangers' Lobby, a feeling of wild excitement and indignation took\r\npossession of the throng. Seeing their temper, I felt that the moment\r\nhad come for a demonstration such as no old-fashioned suffragist had\r\never attempted. I called upon the women to follow me outside for a\r\nmeeting of protest against the government. We swarmed out into the open,\r\nand Mrs. Wolstenholm-Elmy, one of the oldest suffrage workers in\r\nEngland, began to speak. Instantly the police rushed into the crowd of\r\nwomen, pushing them about and ordering them to disperse. We moved on as\r\nfar as the great statue of Richard Coeur de Lion that guards the\r\nentrance to the House of Lords, but again the police intervened. Finally\r\nthe police agreed to let us hold a meeting in Broad Sanctuary, very near\r\nthe gates of Westminster Abbey. Here we made speeches and adopted a\r\nresolution condemning the Government's action in allowing a small\r\nminority to talk out our bill. This was the first militant act of the\r\nW. S. P. U. It caused comment and even some alarm, but the police\r\ncontented themselves with taking our names.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing summer was spent in outdoor work. By this time the Women's\r\nSocial and Political Union had acquired some valuable accessions, and\r\nmoney began to come to us. Among our new members was one who was\r\ndestined to play an important role in the unfolding drama of the\r\nmilitant movement. At the close of one of our meetings at Oldham a young\r\ngirl introduced herself to me as Annie Kenney, a mill-worker, and a\r\nstrong suffrage sympathiser. She wanted to know more of our society and\r\nits objects, and I invited her and her sister Jenny, a Board School\r\nteacher, to tea the next day. They came and joined our Union, a step\r\nthat definitely changed the whole course of Miss Kenney's life, and gave\r\nus one of our most distinguished leaders and organisers. With her help\r\nwe began to carry our propaganda to an entirely new public.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire there is an institution known as the Wakes, a sort of\r\ntravelling fair where they have merry-go-rounds, Aunt-Sallies, and other\r\nfestive games, side-shows of various kinds, and booths where all kinds\r\nof things are sold. Every little village has its Wakes-week during the\r\nsummer and autumn, and it is the custom for the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages to spend the Sunday before the opening of the Wakes walking\r\namong the booths in anticipation of tomorrow's joys. On these occasions\r\nthe Salvation Army, temperance orators, venders of quack medicines,\r\npedlars, and others, take advantage of the ready-made audience to\r\nadvance their propaganda. At Annie Kenney's suggestion we went from one\r\nvillage to the other, following the Wakes and making suffrage speeches.\r\nWe soon rivalled in popularity the Salvation Army, and even the\r\ntooth-drawers and patent-medicine pedlars.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Social and Political Union had been in existence two years\r\nbefore any opportunity was presented for work on a national scale. The\r\nautumn of 1905 brought a political situation which seemed to us to\r\npromise bright hopes for women's enfranchisement. The life of the old\r\nParliament, dominated for nearly twenty years by the Conservative Party,\r\nwas drawing to an end, and the country was on the eve of a general\r\nelection in which the Liberals hoped to be returned to power. Quite\r\nnaturally the Liberal candidates went to the country with perfervid\r\npromises of reform in every possible direction. They appealed to the\r\nvoters to return them, as advocates and upholders of true democracy, and\r\nthey promised that there should be a Government united in favour of\r\npeople's rights against the powers of a privileged aristocracy.\r\n\r\nNow repeated experiences had taught us that the only way to attain\r\nwomen's suffrage was to commit a Government to it. In other words,\r\npledges of support from candidates were plainly useless. They were not\r\nworth having. The only object worth trying for was pledges from\r\nresponsible leaders that the new Government would make women's suffrage\r\na part of the official programme. We determined to address ourselves to\r\nthose men who were likely to be in the Liberal Cabinet, demanding to\r\nknow whether their reforms were going to include justice to women.\r\n\r\nWe laid our plans to begin this work at a great meeting to be held in\r\nFree Trade Hall, Manchester, with Sir Edward Grey as the principal\r\nspeaker. We intended to get seats in the gallery, directly facing the\r\nplatform and we made for the occasion a large banner with the words:\r\n\"Will the Liberal Party Give Votes for Women?\" We were to let this\r\nbanner down over the gallery rails at the moment when our speaker rose\r\nto put the question to Sir Edward Grey. At the last moment, however, we\r\nhad to alter the plan because it was impossible to get the gallery seats\r\nwe wanted. There was no way in which we could use our large banner, so,\r\nlate in the afternoon on the day of the meeting, we cut out and made a\r\nsmall banner with the three-word inscription: \"Votes for Women.\" Thus,\r\nquite accidentally, there came into existence the present slogan of the\r\nsuffrage movement around the world.\r\n\r\nAnnie Kenney and my daughter Christabel were charged with the mission of\r\nquestioning Sir Edward Grey. They sat quietly through the meeting, at\r\nthe close of which questions were invited. Several questions were asked\r\nby men and were courteously answered. Then Annie Kenney arose and asked:\r\n\"If the Liberal party is returned to power, will they take steps to give\r\nvotes for women?\" At the same time Christabel held aloft the little\r\nbanner that every one in the hall might understand the nature of the\r\nquestion. Sir Edward Grey returned no answer to Annie's question, and\r\nthe men sitting near her forced her rudely into her seat, while a\r\nsteward of the meeting pressed his hat over her face. A babel of\r\nshouts, cries and catcalls sounded from all over the hall.\r\n\r\nAs soon as order was restored Christabel stood up and repeated the\r\nquestion: \"Will the Liberal Government, if returned, give votes to\r\nwomen?\" Again Sir Edward Grey ignored the question, and again a perfect\r\ntumult of shouts and angry cries arose. Mr. William Peacock, chief\r\nconstable of Manchester, left the platform and came down to the women,\r\nasking them to write their question, which he promised to hand to the\r\nspeaker. They wrote: \"Will the Liberal Government give votes to\r\nworking-women? Signed, on behalf of the Women's Social and Political\r\nUnion, Annie Kenney, member of the Oldham committee of the card-and\r\nblowing-room operatives.\" They added a line to say that, as one of\r\n96,000 organised women textile-workers, Annie Kenney earnestly desired\r\nan answer to the question.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacock kept his word and handed the question to Sir Edward Grey,\r\nwho read it, smiled, and passed it to the others on the platform. They\r\nalso read it with smiles, but no answer to the question was made. Only\r\none lady who was sitting on the platform tried to say something, but the\r\nchairman interrupted by asking Lord Durham to move a vote of thanks to\r\nthe speaker. Mr. Winston Churchill seconded the motion, Sir Edward Grey\r\nreplied briefly, and the meeting began to break up. Annie Kenney stood\r\nup in her chair and cried out over the noise of shuffling feet and\r\nmurmurs of conversation: \"Will the Liberal Government give votes to\r\nwomen?\" Then the audience became a mob. They howled, they shouted and\r\nroared, shaking their fists fiercely at the woman who dared to intrude\r\nher question into a man's meeting. Hands were lifted to drag her out of\r\nher chair, but Christabel threw one arm about her as she stood, and with\r\nthe other arm warded off the mob, who struck and scratched at her until\r\nher sleeve was red with blood. Still the girls held together and shouted\r\nover and over: \"The question! The question! Answer the question!\"\r\n\r\nSix men, stewards of the meeting, seized Christabel and dragged her down\r\nthe aisle, past the platform, other men following with Annie Kenney,\r\nboth girls still calling for an answer to their question. On the\r\nplatform the Liberal leaders sat silent and unmoved while this\r\ndisgraceful scene was taking place, and the mob were shouting and\r\nshrieking from the floor.\r\n\r\nFlung into the streets, the two girls staggered to their feet and began\r\nto address the crowds, and to tell them what had taken place in a\r\nLiberal meeting. Within five minutes they were arrested on a charge of\r\nobstruction and, in Christabel's case, of assaulting the police. Both\r\nwere summonsed to appear next morning in a police court, where, after a\r\ntrial which was a mere farce, Annie Kenney was sentenced to pay a fine\r\nof five shillings, with an alternative of three days in prison, and\r\nChristabel Pankhurst was given a fine of ten shillings or a jail\r\nsentence of one week.\r\n\r\nBoth girls promptly chose the prison sentence. As soon as they left the\r\ncourt-room I hurried around to the room where they were waiting, and I\r\nsaid to my daughter: \"You have done everything you could be expected to\r\ndo in this matter. I think you should let me pay your fines and take you\r\nhome.\" Without waiting for Annie Kenney to speak, my daughter exclaimed:\r\n\"Mother, if you pay my fine I will never go home.\" Before going to the\r\nmeeting she had said, \"We will get our question answered or sleep in\r\nprison to-night.\" I now knew her courage remained unshaken.\r\n\r\nOf course the affair created a tremendous sensation, not only in\r\nManchester, where my husband had been so well known and where I had so\r\nlong held public office, but all over England. The comments of the press\r\nwere almost unanimously bitter. Ignoring the perfectly well-established\r\nfact that men in every political meeting ask questions and demand\r\nanswers of the speakers, the newspapers treated the action of the two\r\ngirls as something quite unprecedented and outrageous. They generally\r\nagreed that great leniency had been shown them. Fines and jail-sentences\r\nwere too good for such unsexed creatures. \"The discipline of the\r\nnursery\" would have been far more appropriate. One Birmingham paper\r\ndeclared that \"if any argument were required against giving ladies\r\npolitical status and power it had been furnished in Manchester.\"\r\nNewspapers which had heretofore ignored the whole subject now hinted\r\nthat while they had formerly been in favour of women's suffrage, they\r\ncould no longer countenance it. The Manchester incident, it was said,\r\nhad set the cause back, perhaps irrevocably.\r\n\r\nThis is how it set the cause back. Scores of people wrote to the\r\nnewspapers expressing sympathy with the women. The wife of Sir Edward\r\nGrey told her friends that she considered them quite justified in the\r\nmeans they had taken. It was stated that Winston Churchill, nervous\r\nabout his own candidacy in Manchester, visited Strangeways Gaol, where\r\nthe two girls were imprisoned, and vainly begged the governor to allow\r\nhim to pay their fines. On October 20, when the prisoners were released,\r\nthey were given an immense demonstration in Free-Trade Hall, the very\r\nhall from which they had been ejected the week before. The Women's\r\nSocial and Political Union received a large number of new members. Above\r\nall, the question of women's suffrage became at once a live topic of\r\ncomment from one end of Great Britain to the other.\r\n\r\nWe determined that from that time on the little \"Votes For Women\"\r\nbanners should appear wherever a prospective member of the Liberal\r\nGovernment rose to speak, and that there should be no more peace until\r\nthe women's question was answered. We clearly perceived that the new\r\nGovernment, calling themselves Liberal, were reactionary so far as women\r\nwere concerned, that they were hostile to women's suffrage, and would\r\nhave to be fought until they were conquered, or else driven from office.\r\n\r\nWe did not begin to fight, however, until we had given the new\r\nGovernment every chance to give us the pledge we wanted. Early in\r\nDecember the Conservative Government had gone out, and Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, the Liberal leader, had formed a new Cabinet. On\r\nDecember 21 a great meeting was held in Royal Albert Hall, London, where\r\nSir Henry, surrounded by his cabinet, made his first utterance as Prime\r\nMinister. Previous to the meeting we wrote to Sir Henry and asked him,\r\nin the name of the Women's Social and Political Union, whether the\r\nLiberal Government would give women the vote. We added that our\r\nrepresentatives would be present at the meeting, and we hoped that the\r\nPrime Minister would publicly answer the question. Otherwise we should\r\nbe obliged publicly to protest against his silence.\r\n\r\nOf course Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman returned no reply, nor did his\r\nspeech contain any allusion to women's suffrage. So, at the conclusion,\r\nAnnie Kenney, whom we had smuggled into the hall in disguise, whipped\r\nout her little white calico banner, and called out in her clear, sweet\r\nvoice: \"Will the Liberal Government give women the vote?\"\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Theresa Billington let drop from a seat directly\r\nabove the platform a huge banner with the words: \"Will the Liberal\r\nGovernment give justice to working-women?\" Just for a moment there was a\r\ngasping silence, the people waiting to see what the Cabinet Ministers\r\nwould do. They did nothing. Then, in the midst of uproar and conflicting\r\nshouts, the women were seized and flung out of the hall.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a campaign the like of which was never known\r\nin England, or, for that matter, in any other country. If we had been\r\nstrong enough we should have opposed the election of every Liberal\r\ncandidate, but being limited both in funds and in members we\r\nconcentrated on one member of the Government, Mr. Winston Churchill. Not\r\nthat we had any animus against Mr. Churchill. We chose him simply\r\nbecause he was the only important candidate standing for constituencies\r\nwithin reach of our headquarters. We attended every meeting addressed by\r\nMr. Churchill. We heckled him unmercifully; we spoiled his best points\r\nby flinging back such obvious retorts that the crowds roared with\r\nlaughter. We lifted out little white banners from unexpected corners of\r\nthe hall, exactly at the moment when an interruption was least desired.\r\nSometimes our banners were torn from our hands and trodden under foot.\r\nSometimes, again, the crowds were with us, and we actually broke up the\r\nmeeting. We did not succeed in defeating Mr. Churchill, but he was\r\nreturned by a very small majority, the smallest of any of the Manchester\r\nLiberal candidates.\r\n\r\nWe did not confine our efforts to heckling Mr. Churchill. Throughout the\r\ncampaign we kept up the work of questioning Cabinet Ministers at\r\nmeetings all over England and Scotland. At Sun Hall, Liverpool,\r\naddressed by the Prime Minister, nine women in succession asked the\r\nimportant question, and were thrown out of the hall; this in the face of\r\nthe fact that Sir Campbell-Bannerman was an avowed suffragist. But we\r\nwere not questioning him as to his private opinions on the suffrage; we\r\nwere asking him what his Government were willing to do about suffrage.\r\nWe questioned Mr. Asquith in Sheffield, Mr. Lloyd-George in Altrincham,\r\nCheshire, the Prime Minister again in Glasgow, and we interrupted a\r\ngreat many other meetings as well. Always we were violently thrown out\r\nand insulted. Often we were painfully bruised and hurt.\r\n\r\nWhat good did it do? We have often been asked that question, even by the\r\nwomen our actions spurred into an activity they had never before thought\r\nthemselves capable of. For one thing, our heckling campaign made women's\r\nsuffrage a matter of news--it had never been that before. Now the\r\nnewspapers were full of us. For another thing, we woke up the old\r\nsuffrage associations. During the general election various groups of\r\nnon-militant suffragists came back to life and organised a gigantic\r\nmanifesto in favour of action from the Liberal Government. Among others,\r\nthe manifesto was signed by the Women's Co-operative Guild with nearly\r\n21,000 members; the Women's Liberal Federation, with 76,000 members; the\r\nScottish Women's Liberal Federation, with 15,000 members; the\r\nNorth-of-England Weavers' Association, with 100,000 members; the British\r\nWomen's Temperance Association, with nearly 110,000 members; and the\r\nIndependent Labour Party with 20,000 members. Surely it was something to\r\nhave inspired all this activity.\r\n\r\nWe decided that the next step must be to carry the fight to London, and\r\nAnnie Kenney was chosen to be organiser there. With only two pounds,\r\nless than ten dollars, in her pocket the intrepid girl set forth on her\r\nmission. In about a fortnight I left my official work as registrar in\r\nthe hands of a deputy and went down to London to see what had been\r\naccomplished. To my astonishment I found that Annie, working with my\r\ndaughter Sylvia, had organised a procession of women and a demonstration\r\nto be held on the opening day of Parliament. The confident young things\r\nhad actually engaged Caxton Hall, Westminster; they had had printed a\r\nlarge number of handbills to announce the meeting, and they were busily\r\nengaged in working up the demonstration. Mrs. Drummond, who had joined\r\nthe Union shortly after the imprisonment of Annie Kenney and Christabel,\r\nsent word from Manchester that she was coming to help us. She had to\r\nborrow the money for her railroad-fare, but she came, and, as ever\r\nbefore and since, her help was invaluable.\r\n\r\nHow we worked, distributing handbills, chalking announcements of the\r\nmeeting on pavements, calling on every person we knew and on a great\r\nmany more we knew only by name, canvassing from door to door!\r\n\r\nAt length the opening day of Parliament arrived. On February 19, 1906,\r\noccurred the first suffrage procession in London. I think there were\r\nbetween three and four hundred women in that procession, poor\r\nworking-women from the East End, for the most part, leading the way in\r\nwhich numberless women of every rank were afterward to follow. My eyes\r\nwere misty with tears as I saw them, standing in line, holding the\r\nsimple banners which my daughter Sylvia had decorated, waiting for the\r\nword of command. Of course our procession attracted a large crowd of\r\nintensely amused spectators. The police, however, made no attempt to\r\ndisperse our ranks, but merely ordered us to furl our banners. There\r\nwas no reason why we should not have carried banners but the fact that\r\nwe were women, and therefore could be bullied. So, bannerless, the\r\nprocession entered Caxton Hall. To my amazement it was filled with\r\nwomen, most of whom I had never seen at any suffrage gathering before.\r\n\r\nOur meeting was most enthusiastic, and while Annie Kenney was speaking,\r\nto frequent applause, the news came to me that the King's speech (which\r\nis not the King's at all, but the formally announced Government\r\nprogramme for the session) had been read, and that there was in it no\r\nmention of the women's suffrage question. As Annie took her seat I arose\r\nand made this announcement, and I moved a resolution that the meeting\r\nshould at once proceed to the House of Commons to urge the members to\r\nintroduce a suffrage measure. The resolution was carried, and we rushed\r\nout in a body and hurried toward the Strangers' Entrance. It was pouring\r\nrain and bitterly cold, yet no one turned back, even when we learned at\r\nthe entrance that for the first time in memory the doors of the House of\r\nCommons were barred to women. We sent in our cards to members who were\r\npersonal friends, and some of them came out and urged our admittance.\r\nThe police, however, were obdurate. They had their orders. The Liberal\r\ngovernment, advocates of the people's rights, had given orders that\r\nwomen should no longer set foot in their stronghold.\r\n\r\nPressure from members proved too great, and the government relented to\r\nthe extent of allowing twenty women at a time to enter the lobby.\r\nThrough all the rain and cold those hundreds of women waited for hours\r\ntheir turn to enter. Some never got in, and for those of us who did\r\nthere was small satisfaction. Not a member could be persuaded to take up\r\nour cause.\r\n\r\nOut of the disappointment and dejection of that experience I yet reaped\r\na richer harvest of happiness than I had ever known before. Those women\r\nhad followed me to the House of Commons. They had defied the police.\r\nThey were awake at last. They were prepared to do something that women\r\nhad never done before--fight for themselves. Women had always fought for\r\nmen, and for their children. Now they were ready to fight for their own\r\nhuman rights. Our militant movement was established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTo account for the phenomenal growth of the Women's Social and Political\r\nUnion after it was established in London, to explain why it made such an\r\ninstant appeal to women hitherto indifferent, I shall have to point out\r\nexactly wherein our society differs from all other suffrage\r\nassociations. In the first place, our members are absolutely single\r\nminded; they concentrate all their forces on one object, political\r\nequality with men. No member of the W. S. P. U. divides her attention\r\nbetween suffrage and other social reforms. We hold that both reason and\r\njustice dictate that women shall have a share in reforming the evils\r\nthat afflict society, especially those evils bearing directly on women\r\nthemselves. Therefore, we demand, before any other legislation whatever,\r\nthe elementary justice of votes for women.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that the women of Great Britain would\r\nhave been enfranchised years ago had all the suffragists adopted this\r\nsimple principle. They never did, and even to-day many English women\r\nrefuse to adopt it. They are party members first and suffragists\r\nafterward; or they are suffragists part of the time and social theorists\r\nthe rest of the time. We further differ from other suffrage\r\nassociations, or from others existing in 1906, in that we clearly\r\nperceived the political situation that solidly interposed between us and\r\nour enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nFor seven years we had had a majority in the House of Commons pledged to\r\nvote favourably on a suffrage bill. The year before, they had voted\r\nfavourably on one, yet that bill did not become law. Why? Because even\r\nan overwhelming majority of private members are powerless to enact law\r\nin the face of a hostile Government of eleven cabinet ministers. The\r\nprivate member of Parliament was once possessed of individual power and\r\nresponsibility, but Parliamentary usage and a changed conception of\r\nstatesmanship have gradually lessened the functions of members. At the\r\npresent time their powers, for all practical purposes, are limited to\r\nhelping to enact such measures as the Government introduces or, in rare\r\ninstances, private measures approved by the Government. It is true that\r\nthe House can revolt, can, by voting a lack of confidence in the\r\nGovernment, force them to resign. But that almost never happens, and it\r\nis less likely now than formerly to happen. Figureheads don't revolt.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was our situation: the Government all-powerful and\r\nconsistently hostile; the rank and file of legislators impotent; the\r\ncountry apathetic; the women divided in their interests. The Women's\r\nSocial and Political Union was established to meet this situation, and\r\nto overcome it. Moreover we had a policy which, if persisted in long\r\nenough, could not possibly fail to overcome it. Do you wonder that we\r\ngained new members at every meeting we held?\r\n\r\nThere was little formality about joining the Union. Any woman could\r\nbecome a member by paying a shilling, but at the same time she was\r\nrequired to sign a declaration of loyal adherence to our policy and a\r\npledge not to work for any political party until the women's vote was\r\nwon. This is still our inflexible custom. Moreover, if at any time a\r\nmember, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one\r\nbegins to suggest, that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if\r\nshe tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at\r\nonce to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a\r\nsuffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the\r\nW. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the\r\neffectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is\r\nnot hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and\r\nby-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an\r\nannual meeting. In fact, we have no annual meeting, no business\r\nsessions, no elections of officers. The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage\r\narmy in the field. It is purely a volunteer army, and no one is obliged\r\nto remain in it. Indeed we don't want anybody to remain in it who does\r\nnot ardently believe in the policy of the army.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of our policy is opposition to a Government who refuse\r\nvotes to women. To support by word or deed a Government hostile to woman\r\nsuffrage is simply to invite them to go on being hostile. We oppose the\r\nLiberal party because it is in power. We would oppose a Unionist\r\ngovernment if it were in power and were opposed to woman suffrage. We\r\nsay to women that as long as they remain in the ranks of the Liberal\r\nparty they give their tacit approval to the Government's anti-suffrage\r\npolicy. We say to members of Parliament that as long as they support any\r\nof the Government's policies they give their tacit approval to the\r\nanti-suffrage policy. We call upon all sincere suffragists to leave the\r\nLiberal party until women are given votes on equal terms with men. We\r\ncall upon all voters to vote against Liberal candidates until the\r\nLiberal Government does justice to women.\r\n\r\nWe did not invent this policy. It was most successfully pursued by Mr.\r\nParnell in his Home Rule struggle more than thirty-five years ago. Any\r\none who is old enough to remember the stirring days of Parnell may\r\nrecall how, in 1885, the Home Rulers, by persistently voting against the\r\nGovernment in the House of Commons, forced the resignation of Mr.\r\nGladstone and his Cabinet. In the general election which followed, the\r\nLiberal party was again returned to power, but by the slender majority\r\nof eighty-four, the Home Rulers having fought every Liberal candidate,\r\neven those, who, like my husband, were enthusiastic believers in Home\r\nRule. In order to control the House and keep his leadership, Mr.\r\nGladstone was obliged to bring in a Government Home Rule Bill. The\r\ndownfall, through private intrigue, and the subsequent death of Parnell\r\nprevented the bill from becoming law. For many years afterward the Irish\r\nNationalists had no leader strong enough to carry on Parnell's\r\nanti-government policy, but within late years it was resumed by Mr.\r\nJames Redmond, with the result that the Commons passed a Home Rule\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nThe contention of the old-fashioned suffragists, and of the politicians\r\nas well, has always been that an educated public opinion will ultimately\r\ngive votes to women without any great force being exerted in behalf of\r\nthe reform. We agree that public opinion must be educated, but we\r\ncontend that even an educated public opinion is useless unless it is\r\nvigorously utilised. The keenest weapon is powerless unless it is\r\ncourageously wielded. In the year 1906 there was an immensely large\r\npublic opinion in favour of woman suffrage. But what good did that do\r\nthe cause? We called upon the public for a great deal more than\r\nsympathy. We called upon it to demand of the Government to yield to\r\npublic opinion and give women votes. And we declared that we would wage\r\nwar, not only on all anti-suffrage forces, but on all neutral and\r\nnon-active forces. Every man with a vote was considered a foe to woman\r\nsuffrage unless he was prepared to be actively a friend.\r\n\r\nNot that we believed that the campaign of education ought to be given\r\nup. On the contrary, we knew that education must go on, and in much more\r\nvigorous fashion than ever before. The first thing we did was to enter\r\nupon a sensational campaign to arouse the public to the importance of\r\nwoman suffrage, and to interest it in our plans for forcing the\r\nGovernment's hands. I think we can claim that our success in this regard\r\nwas instant, and that it has proved permanent. From the very first, in\r\nthose early London days, when we were few in numbers and very poor in\r\npurse, we made the public aware of the woman suffrage movement as it had\r\nnever been before. We adopted Salvation Army methods and went out into\r\nthe highways and the byways after converts. We threw away all our\r\nconventional notions of what was \"ladylike\" and \"good form,\" and we\r\napplied to our methods the one test question, Will it help? Just as the\r\nBooths and their followers took religion to the street crowds in such\r\nfashion that the church people were horrified, so we took suffrage to\r\nthe general public in a manner that amazed and scandalised the other\r\nsuffragists.\r\n\r\nWe had a lot of suffrage literature printed, and day by day our members\r\nwent forth and held street meetings. Selecting a favourable spot, with a\r\nchair for a rostrum, one of us would ring a bell until people began to\r\nstop to see what was going to happen. What happened, of course, was a\r\nlively suffrage speech, and the distribution of literature. Soon after\r\nour campaign had started, the sound of the bell was a signal for a crowd\r\nto spring up as if by magic. All over the neighbourhood you heard the\r\ncry: \"Here are the Suffragettes! Come on!\" We covered London in this\r\nway; we never lacked an audience, and best of all, an audience to which\r\nthe woman-suffrage doctrine was new. We were increasing our favourable\r\npublic as well as waking it up. Besides these street meetings, we held\r\nmany hall and drawing-room meetings, and we got a great deal of press\r\npublicity, which was something never accorded the older suffrage\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nOur plans included the introduction of a Government suffrage bill at\r\nthe earliest possible moment, and in the spring of 1906 we sent a\r\ndeputation of about thirty of our members to interview the Prime\r\nMinister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The Prime Minister, it was\r\nstated, was not at home; so in a few days we sent another deputation.\r\nThis time the servant agreed to carry our request to the Prime Minister.\r\nThe women waited patiently on the doorstep of the official residence,\r\nNo. 10 Downing Street, for nearly an hour. Then the door opened and two\r\nmen appeared. One of the men addressed the leader of the deputation,\r\nroughly ordering her and the others to leave. \"We have sent a message to\r\nthe Prime Minister,\" she replied, \"and we are waiting for the answer.\"\r\n\"There will be no answer,\" was the stern rejoinder, and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there will be an answer,\" exclaimed the leader, and she seized the\r\ndoor-knocker and banged it sharply. Instantly the men reappeared, and\r\none of them called to a policeman standing near, \"Take this woman in\r\ncharge.\" The order was obeyed, and the peaceful deputation saw its\r\nleader taken off to Canon Row Station.\r\n\r\nInstantly the women protested vigorously. Annie Kenney began to address\r\nthe crowd that had gathered, and Mrs. Drummond actually forced her way\r\npast the doorkeeper into the sacred residence of the Prime Minister of\r\nthe British Empire! Her arrest and Annie's followed. The three women\r\nwere detained at the police station for about an hour, long enough, the\r\nPrime Minister probably thought, to frighten them thoroughly and teach\r\nthem not to do such dreadful things again. Then he sent them word that\r\nhe had decided not to prosecute them, but would, on the contrary,\r\nreceive a deputation from the W. S. P. U., and, if they cared to attend,\r\nfrom other suffrage societies as well.\r\n\r\nAll the suffrage organisations at once began making preparations for the\r\ngreat event. At the same time two hundred members of Parliament sent a\r\npetition to the Prime Minister, asking him to receive their committee\r\nthat they might urge upon him the necessity of a Government measure for\r\nwoman suffrage. Sir Henry fixed May 19th as the day on which he would\r\nreceive a joint deputation from Parliament and from the women's suffrage\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\nThe W. S. P. U. determined to make the occasion as public as possible,\r\nand began preparations for a procession and a demonstration. When the\r\nday came we assembled at the foot of the beautiful monument to the\r\nwarrior-queen, Boadicea, that guards the entrance to Westminster Bridge,\r\nand from there we marched to the Foreign Office. At the meeting eight\r\nwomen spoke in behalf of an immediate suffrage measure, and Mr. Keir\r\nHardie presented the argument for the suffrage members of Parliament. I\r\nspoke for the W. S. P. U., and I tried to make the Prime Minister see\r\nthat no business could be more pressing than ours. I told him that the\r\ngroup of women organised in our Union felt so strongly the necessity for\r\nwomen enfranchisement that they were prepared to sacrifice for it\r\neverything they possessed, their means of livelihood, their very lives,\r\nif necessary. I begged him to make such a sacrifice needless by doing us\r\njustice now.\r\n\r\nWhat answer do you think Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman made us? He\r\nassured us of his sympathy with our cause, his belief in its justice,\r\nand his confidence in our fitness to vote. And then he told us to have\r\npatience and wait; he could do nothing for us because some of his\r\nCabinet were opposed to us. After a few more words the usual vote of\r\nthanks was moved, and the deputation was dismissed. I had not expected\r\nanything better, but it wrung my heart to see the bitter disappointment\r\nof the W. S. P. U. women who had waited in the street to hear from the\r\nleaders the result of the deputation. We held a great meeting of protest\r\nthat afternoon, and determined to carry on our agitation with increased\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nNow that it had been made plain that the Government were resolved not to\r\nbring in a suffrage bill, there was nothing to do but to continue our\r\npolicy of waking up the country, not only by public speeches and\r\ndemonstrations, but by a constant heckling of Cabinet Ministers. Since\r\nthe memorable occasion when Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney were\r\nthrown out of Sir Edward Grey's meeting in Manchester, and afterward\r\nimprisoned for the crime of asking a courteous question, we had not lost\r\nan opportunity of addressing the same question to every Cabinet Minister\r\nwe could manage to encounter. For this we have been unmercifully\r\ncriticised, and in a large number of cases most brutally handled.\r\n\r\nIn almost every one of my American meetings I was asked the question,\r\n\"What good do you expect to accomplish by interrupting meetings?\" Is it\r\npossible that the time-honoured, almost sacred English privilege of\r\ninterrupting is unknown in America? I cannot imagine a political meeting\r\nfrom which \"the Voice\" was entirely absent. In England it is invariably\r\npresent. It is considered the inalienable right of the opposition to\r\nheckle the speaker and to hurl questions at him which are calculated to\r\nspoil his arguments. For instance, when Liberals attend a Conservative\r\ngathering they go prepared to shatter by witticisms and pointed\r\nquestions all the best effects of the Conservative orators. The next day\r\nyou will read in Liberal newspapers headlines like these: \"The Voice in\r\nFine Form,\" \"Short Shrift for Tory Twaddle,\" \"Awkward Answers from the\r\nEnemy's Platform.\" In the body of the article you will learn that \"Lord\r\nX found that the Liberals at his meeting were more than a match for\r\nhim,\" that \"there was continued interruption during Sir So-and-so's\r\nspeech,\" that \"Lord M fared badly last night in his encounter with the\r\nVoice,\" or that \"Captain Z had the greatest difficulty in making himself\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this custom we heckle Cabinet Ministers. Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill, for example, is speaking. \"One great question,\" he exclaims,\r\n\"remains to be settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is woman suffrage,\" shouts a voice from the gallery.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill struggles on with his speech: \"The men have been\r\ncomplaining of me----\"\r\n\r\n\"The women have been complaining of you, too, Mr. Churchill,\" comes\r\nback promptly from the back of the hall.\r\n\r\n\"In the circumstances what can we do but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Give votes to women.\"\r\n\r\nOur object, of course, is to keep woman suffrage in the foreground of\r\ninterest and to insist on every possible occasion that no other reform\r\nadvocated is of such immediate importance.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the women's interruptions have been resented with\r\nunreasoning anger. I remember hearing Mr. Lloyd-George saying once of a\r\nman who interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"Let him remain. I like interruptions. They show that people holding\r\ndifferent opinions to mine are present, giving me a chance to convert\r\nthem.\" But when suffragists interrupt Mr. Lloyd-George he says something\r\npolite like this: \"Pay no attention to those cats mewing.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the ministers are more well bred in their expressions, but all\r\nare disdainful and resentful. All see with approval the brutal ejection\r\nof the women by the Liberal stewards.\r\n\r\nAt one meeting where Mr. Lloyd-George was speaking, we interrupted with\r\na question, and he claimed the sympathy of the audience on the score\r\nthat he was a friend to woman suffrage. \"Then why don't you do something\r\nto give votes to women?\" was the obvious retort. But Mr. Lloyd-George\r\nevaded this by the counter query: \"Why don't they go for their enemies?\r\nWhy don't they go for their greatest enemy?\" Instantly, all over the\r\nhall, voices shouted, \"Asquith! Asquith!\" For even at that early day it\r\nwas known that the then Chancellor of the Exchequer was a stern foe of\r\nwomen's independence.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1906, together with other members of the W. S. P. U., I\r\nwent to Northampton, where Mr. Asquith was holding a large meeting in\r\nbehalf of the Government's education bills. We organised a number of\r\noutdoor meetings, and of course prepared to attend Mr. Asquith's\r\nmeeting. In conversation with the president of the local Women's Liberal\r\nAssociation, I mentioned the fact that we expected to be put out, and\r\nshe indignantly declared that such a thing could not happen in\r\nNorthampton, where the women had done so much for the Liberal party. I\r\ntold her that I hoped she would be at the meeting.\r\n\r\nI had not intended to go myself, my plans being to hold a meeting of my\r\nown outside the door. But our members, before Mr. Asquith began to\r\nspeak, attempted to question him, and were thrown out with violence. So\r\nthen, turning my meeting over to them, I slipped quietly into the hall\r\nand sat down in the front row of a division set apart for wives and\r\nwomen friends of the Liberal leaders. I sat there in silence, hearing\r\nmen interrupt the speaker and get answers to their questions. At the\r\nclose of the speech I stood up and, addressing the chairman, said: \"I\r\nshould like to ask Mr. Asquith a question about education.\" The chairman\r\nturned inquiringly to Mr. Asquith, who frowningly shook his head. But\r\nwithout waiting for the chairman to say a word, I continued: \"Mr.\r\nAsquith has said that the parents of children have a right to be\r\nconsulted in the matter of their children's education, especially upon\r\nsuch questions as the kind of religious instruction they should receive.\r\nWomen are parents. Does not Mr. Asquith think that women should have the\r\nright to control their children's education, as men do, through the\r\nvote?\" At this point the stewards seized me by the arms and shoulders\r\nand rushed me, or rather dragged me, for I soon lost my footing, to the\r\ndoor and threw me out of the building.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the president of the Northampton Women's Liberal\r\nAssociation was most salutary. She resigned her office and became a\r\nmember of the W. S. P. U. Perhaps her action was influenced further by\r\nthe press reports of the incident. Mr. Asquith was reported as saying,\r\nafter my ejection, that it was difficult to enter into the minds of\r\npeople who thought they could serve a cause which professed to appeal to\r\nthe reason of the electors of the country by disturbing public meetings.\r\nApparently he could enter into the minds of the men who disturbed public\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nTo our custom of public heckling of the responsible members of the\r\nhostile Government we added the practice of sending deputations to them\r\nfor the purpose of presenting orderly arguments in favour of our cause.\r\nAfter Mr. Asquith had shown himself so uninformed as to the objects of\r\nthe suffragists, we decided to ask him to receive a deputation from the\r\nW. S. P. U. To our polite letter Mr. Asquith returned a cold refusal to\r\nbe interviewed on any subject not connected with his particular office.\r\nWhereupon we wrote again, reminding Mr. Asquith that as a member of the\r\nGovernment he was concerned with all questions likely to be dealt with\r\nby Parliament. We said that we urgently desired to put our question\r\nbefore him, and that we would send a deputation to his house hoping that\r\nhe would feel it his duty to receive us.\r\n\r\nOur first deputation was told that Mr. Asquith was not at home. He had,\r\nin fact, escaped from the house through the back door, and had sped away\r\nin a fast motor-car. Two days later we sent a larger deputation, of\r\nabout thirty women, to his house in Cavendish Square. To be accurate,\r\nthe deputation got as near the house as the entrance to Cavendish\r\nSquare; there the women met a strong force of police, who told them that\r\nthey would not be permitted to go farther.\r\n\r\nMany of the women were carrying little \"Votes for Women\" banners, and\r\nthese the police tore from them, in some cases with blows and insults.\r\nSeeing this, the leader of the deputation cried out: \"We will go\r\nforward. You have no right to strike women like that.\" The reply, from a\r\npoliceman near her, was a blow in the face. She screamed with pain and\r\nindignation, whereupon the man grasped her by the throat and choked her\r\nagainst the park railings until she was blue in the face. The young\r\nwoman struggled and fought back, and for this she was arrested on a\r\ncharge of assaulting the police. Three other women were arrested, one\r\nbecause, in spite of the police, she succeeded in ringing Mr. Asquith's\r\ndoor-bell and another because she protested against the laughter of\r\nsome ladies who watched the affair from a drawing-room window. She was a\r\npoor working-woman, and it seemed to her a terrible thing that rich and\r\nprotected women should ridicule a cause that to her was so profoundly\r\nserious. The fourth woman was taken in charge, because after she had\r\nbeen pushed off the pavement, she dared to step back. Charged with\r\ndisorderly conduct, these women were sentenced to six weeks in the\r\nSecond Division. They were given the option of a fine, it is true, but\r\nthe payment of a fine would have been an acknowledgment of guilt, which\r\nmade such a course impossible. The leader of the deputation was given a\r\ntwo months' sentence, with the option of a fine of ten pounds. She, too,\r\nrefused to pay, and was sent to prison; but some unknown friend paid the\r\nfine secretly, and she was released before the expiration of her\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nAbout the time these things were happening in London, similar violence\r\nwas offered our women in Manchester, where John Burns, Lloyd-George, and\r\nWinston Churchill, all three Cabinet Ministers, were addressing a great\r\nLiberal demonstration. The women were there, as usual, to ask government\r\nsupport for our measure. There, too, they were thrown out of the\r\nmeeting, and three of them were sent to prison.\r\n\r\nThere are people in England, plenty of them, who will tell you that the\r\nSuffragettes were sent to prison for destroying property. The fact is\r\nthat hundreds of women were arrested for exactly such offences as I have\r\ndescribed before it ever occurred to any of us to destroy property. We\r\nwere determined, at the beginning of our movement, that we would make\r\nourselves heard, that we would force the Government to take up our\r\nquestion and answer it by action in Parliament. Perhaps you will see\r\nsome parallel to our case in the stand taken in Massachusetts by the\r\nearly Abolitionists, Wendell Phillips and William Lloyd Garrison. They,\r\ntoo, had to fight bitterly, to face insult and arrest, because they\r\ninsisted on being heard. And they were heard; and so, in time, were we.\r\n\r\nI think we began to be noticed in earnest after our first success in\r\nopposing a Liberal candidate. This was in a by-election held at\r\nCockermouth in August, 1906. I shall have to explain that a by-election\r\nis a local election to fill a vacancy in Parliament caused by a death or\r\na resignation. The verdict of a by-election is considered as either an\r\nindorsement or a censure of the manner in which the Government have\r\nfulfilled their pre-election pledges. So we went to Cockermouth and told\r\nthe voters how the Liberal party had fulfilled its pledges of democracy\r\nand lived up to its avowed belief in the rights of all the people. We\r\ntold them of the arrests in London and Manchester, of the shameful\r\ntreatment of women in Liberal meetings, and we asked them to censure the\r\nGovernment who had answered so brutally our demand for a vote. We told\r\nthem that the only rebuke that the politicians would notice was a lost\r\nseat in Parliament, and that on that ground we asked them to defeat the\r\nLiberal candidate.\r\n\r\nHow we were ridiculed! With what scorn the newspapers declared that\r\n\"those wild women\" could never turn a single vote. Yet when the\r\nelection was over it was found that the Liberal candidate had lost the\r\nseat, which, at the general election a little more than a year before,\r\nhad been won by a majority of 655. This time the Unionist candidate was\r\nreturned by a majority of 609. Tremendously elated, we hurried our\r\nforces off to another by-election.\r\n\r\nNow the ridicule was turned to stormy abuse. Mind you, the Liberal\r\nGovernment still refused to notice the women's question; they declared\r\nthrough the Liberal press that the defeat at Cockermouth was\r\ninsignificant, and that anyhow it wasn't caused by the Suffragettes; yet\r\nthe Liberal leaders were furiously angry with the W. S. P. U. Many of\r\nour members had been Liberals, and it was considered by the men that\r\nthese women were little better than traitors. They were very foolish and\r\nill-advised, into the bargain, the Liberals said, because the vote, if\r\nwon at all, must be gained from the Liberal party; and how did the women\r\nsuppose the Liberal party would ever give the vote to open and avowed\r\nenemies? This sage argument was used also by the women Liberals and the\r\nconstitutional suffragists. They advised us that the proper way was to\r\nwork for the party. We retorted that we had done that unsuccessfully for\r\ntoo many years already, and persisted with the opposite method of\r\npersuasion.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer and autumn we devoted ourselves to the by-election\r\nwork, sometimes actually defeating the Liberal candidate, sometimes\r\nreducing the Liberal majority, and always raising a tremendous sensation\r\nand gaining hundreds of new members to the Union. In almost every\r\nneighbourhood we visited we left the nucleus of a local union, so that\r\nbefore the year was out we had branches all over England and many in\r\nScotland and Wales. I especially remember a by-election in Wales at\r\nwhich Mr. Samuel Evans, who had accepted an officership under the Crown,\r\nhad to stand for re-election. Unfortunately no candidate had been\r\nbrought out against him. So there was nothing for my companions and me\r\nto do but make his campaign as lively as possible. Mr.--now Sir\r\nSamuel--Evans was the man who had incensed women by talking out a\r\nsuffrage resolution introduced into the House by Keir Hardie. So we went\r\nto two of his meetings and literally talked him out, breaking up the\r\ngatherings amid the laughter and cheers of delighted crowds.\r\n\r\nOn October 23d Parliament met for its autumn session, and we led a\r\ndeputation to the House of Commons in another effort to induce the\r\nGovernment to take action on woman suffrage. In accordance with orders\r\ngiven the police, only twenty of us were admitted to the Strangers'\r\nLobby. We sent in for the chief Liberal whip, and asked him to take a\r\nmessage to the Prime Minister, the message being the usual request to\r\ngrant women the vote that session. We also asked the Prime Minister if\r\nhe intended to include the registration of qualified women voters in the\r\nprovisions of the plural voting bill, then under consideration. The\r\nLiberal whip came back with the reply that nothing could be done for\r\nwomen that session.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. PANKHURST ADDRESSING A BY-ELECTION CROWD]\r\n\r\n\"Does the Prime Minister,\" I asked, \"hold out any hope for the women\r\nfor any session during this Parliament, or at any future time?\" The\r\nPrime Minister, you will remember, called himself a suffragist.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal whip replied, \"No, Mrs. Pankhurst, the Prime Minister does\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would a deputation of unenfranchised men have done in these\r\ncircumstances--men who knew themselves to be qualified to exercise the\r\nfranchise, who desperately needed the protection of the franchise, and\r\nwho had a majority of legislators in favour of giving them the\r\nfranchise? I hope they would have done at least as much as we did, which\r\nwas to start a meeting of protest on the spot. The newspapers described\r\nour action as creating a disgraceful scene in the lobby of the House of\r\nCommons, but I think that history will otherwise describe it. One of the\r\nwomen sprang up on a settee and began to address the crowd. In less than\r\na minute she was pulled down, but instantly another woman took her\r\nplace; and after she had been dragged down, still another sprang to her\r\nplace, and following her another and another, until the order came to\r\nclear the lobby, and we were all forced outside.\r\n\r\nIn the melee I was thrown to the floor and painfully hurt. The women,\r\nthinking me seriously injured, crowded around me and refused to move\r\nuntil I was able to regain myself. This angered the police, who were\r\nstill more incensed when they found that the demonstration was continued\r\noutside. Eleven women were arrested, including Mrs. Pethick Lawrence,\r\nour treasurer, Mrs. Cobden Sanderson, Annie Kenney and three more of our\r\norganisers; and they were all sent to Holloway for two months. But the\r\nstrength of our movement was proved by the number of volunteers who\r\nimmediately came forward to carry on the work. Mrs. Tuke, now Hon.\r\nSecretary of the W. S. P. U., joined the Union at this time. It had not\r\noccurred to the authorities that their action would have this effect.\r\nThey thought to crush the Union at a blow, but they gave it the greatest\r\nimpetus it had yet received. The leaders of the older suffrage\r\norganisations for the time forgot their disapproval of our methods, and\r\njoined with women writers, physicians, actresses, artists, and other\r\nprominent women in denouncing the affair as barbarous.\r\n\r\nOne more thing the authorities failed to take into account. The\r\ncondition of English prisons was known to be very bad, but when two of\r\nour women were made so ill in Holloway that they had to be released\r\nwithin a few days, the politicians began to tremble for their prestige.\r\nQuestions were asked in Parliament concerning the advisability of\r\ntreating the Suffragettes not as common criminals but as political\r\noffenders with the right to confinement in the First Division. Mr.\r\nHerbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary, replied to these questions that\r\nhe had no power to interfere with the magistrates' decisions, and could\r\ndo nothing in the matter of the suffragettes' punishment. I shall ask\r\nyou to remember this statement of Mr. Herbert Gladstone's, as later we\r\nwere able to prove it a deliberate falsehood--although really the\r\nfalsehood proved itself when the women, by Government order, were\r\nreleased from prison when they had served just half their sentences.\r\nThe reason for this was that an important by-election was being held in\r\nthe north of England, and we had distributed broadcast throughout the\r\nconstituency hand bills telling the electors that nine women, including\r\nthe daughter of Richard Cobden, were being held as common criminals by\r\nthe Liberal Government who were asking for their votes.\r\n\r\nI took a group of the released prisoners to Huddersfield, and they told\r\nprison stories to such effect that the Liberal majority was reduced by\r\n540 votes. As usual the Liberal leaders denied that our work had\r\nanything to do with the slender majority by which the party retained the\r\nseat, but among our souvenirs is a handbill, one of thousands given out\r\nfrom Liberal headquarters:\r\n\r\n\r\n     +------------------------------+\r\n     |     MEN OF HUDDERSFIELD      |\r\n     |       DON'T BE MISLED        |\r\n     | BY SOCIALISTS, SUFFRAGETTES  |\r\n     |          OR TORIES           |\r\n     |      VOTE FOR SHERWELL       |\r\n     +------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other demonstrations had taken place before the House of\r\nCommons, and at Christmas time twenty-one suffragettes were in Holloway\r\nPrison, though they had committed no crime. The Government professed\r\nthemselves unmoved, and members of Parliament spoke with sneers of the\r\n\"self-made martyrs.\" However, a considerable group of members, strongly\r\nmoved by the passion and unquenchable ardor of this new order of\r\nsuffragists, met during the last week of the year and formed a\r\ncommittee whose object it was to press upon the government the necessity\r\nof giving the franchise to women during that Parliament. The committee\r\nresolved that its members would work to educate a wider public opinion\r\non the question, and especially to advocate suffrage when addressing\r\nmeetings in their constituencies, to take Parliamentary action on every\r\npossible occasion, and to induce as many members of Parliament as\r\npossible to ballot for the introduction of a suffrage bill or motion\r\nnext session.\r\n\r\nOur first year in London had borne wonderful fruits. We had grown from a\r\nmere handful of women, a \"family party\" the newspapers had derisively\r\ncalled us, to a strong organisation with branches all over the country,\r\npermanent headquarters in Clements Inn, Strand; we had found good\r\nfinancial backing, and above all, we had created a suffrage committee in\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nFOUR YEARS OF PEACEFUL MILITANCY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1907 began with a Women's Parliament, called together on\r\nFebruary 13th in Caxton Hall, to consider the provisions of the King's\r\nspeech, which had been read in the national Parliament on the opening\r\nday of the session, February 12th. The King's speech, as I have\r\nexplained, is the official announcement of the Government's programme\r\nfor the session. When our Women's Parliament met at three o'clock on the\r\nafternoon of the thirteenth we knew that the Government meant to do\r\nnothing for women during the session ahead.\r\n\r\nI presided over the women's meeting, which was marked with a fervency\r\nand a determination of spirit at that time altogether unprecedented. A\r\nresolution expressing indignation that woman suffrage should have been\r\nomitted from the King's speech, and calling upon the House of Commons to\r\ngive immediate facilities to such a measure, was moved and carried. A\r\nmotion to send the resolution from the hall to the Prime Minister was\r\nalso carried. The slogan, \"Rise up, women,\" was cried from the platform,\r\nthe answering shout coming back as from one woman, \"Now!\" With copies of\r\nthe resolution in their hands, the chosen deputation hurried forth into\r\nthe February dusk, ready for Parliament or prison, as the fates decreed.\r\n\r\nFate did not leave them very long in doubt. The Government, it\r\nappeared, had decided that not again should their sacred halls of\r\nParliament be desecrated by women asking for the vote, and orders had\r\nbeen given that would henceforth prevent women from reaching even the\r\nouter precincts of the House of Commons. So when our deputation of women\r\narrived in the neighbourhood of Westminster Abbey they found themselves\r\nopposed by a solid line of police, who, at a sharp order from their\r\nchief, began to stride through and through the ranks of the procession,\r\ntrying to turn the women back. Bravely the women rallied and pressed\r\nforward a little farther. Suddenly a body of mounted police came riding\r\nup at a smart trot, and for the next five hours or more, a struggle,\r\nquite indescribable for brutality and ruthlessness, went on.\r\n\r\nThe horsemen rode directly into the procession, scattering the women\r\nright and left. But still the women would not turn back. Again and again\r\nthey returned, only to fly again and again from the merciless hoofs.\r\nSome of the women left the streets for the pavements, but even there the\r\nhorsemen pursued them, pressing them so close to walls and railings that\r\nthey were obliged to retreat temporarily to avoid being crushed. Other\r\nstrategists took refuge in doorways, but they were dragged out by the\r\nfoot police and were thrown directly in front of the horses. Still the\r\nwomen fought to reach the House of Commons with their resolution. They\r\nfought until their clothes were torn, their bodies bruised, and the last\r\nounce of their strength exhausted. Fifteen of them did actually fight\r\ntheir way through those hundreds on hundreds of police, foot and\r\nmounted, as far as the Strangers' Lobby of the House. Here they\r\nattempted to hold a meeting, and were arrested. Outside, many more women\r\nwere taken into custody. It was ten o'clock before the last arrest was\r\nmade, and the square cleared of the crowds. After that the mounted men\r\ncontinued to guard the approaches to the House of Commons until the\r\nHouse rose at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe next morning fifty-seven women and two men were arraigned, two and\r\nthree at a time, in Westminster police court. Christabel Pankhurst was\r\nthe first to be placed in the dock. She tried to explain to the\r\nmagistrate that the deputation of the day before was a perfectly\r\npeaceful attempt to present a resolution, which, sooner or later, would\r\nbe presented and acted upon. She assured him that the deputation was but\r\nthe beginning of a campaign that would not cease until the Government\r\nyielded to the women's demand. \"There can be no going back for us,\" she\r\ndeclared, \"and more will happen if we do not get justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, Mr. Curtis Bennett, who was destined later to try women\r\nfor that \"more,\" rebuked my daughter sternly, telling her that the\r\nGovernment had nothing to do with causing the disorders of the day\r\nbefore, that the women were entirely responsible for what had occurred,\r\nand finally, that these disgraceful scenes in the street must\r\ncease--just as King Canute told the ocean that it must roll out instead\r\nof in. \"The scenes can be stopped in only one way,\" replied the\r\nprisoner. His sole reply to that was, \"Twenty shillings or fourteen\r\ndays,\" Christabel chose the prison sentence, and so did all the other\r\nprisoners. Mrs. Despard, who headed the deputation, and Sylvia\r\nPankhurst, who was with her, were given three weeks in prison.\r\n\r\nOf course the raid, as it was called, gave the Women's Social and\r\nPolitical Union an enormous amount of publicity, on the whole,\r\nfavourable publicity. The newspapers were almost unanimous in condemning\r\nthe Government for sending mounted troops out against unarmed women.\r\nAngry questions were asked in Parliament, and our ranks once more\r\nincreased in size and ardour. The old-fashioned suffragists, men as well\r\nas women, cried out that we had alienated all our friends in Parliament;\r\nbut this proved to be untrue. Indeed, it was found that a Liberal\r\nmember, Mr. Dickinson, had won the first place in the ballot, and had\r\nannounced that he intended to use it to introduce a women's suffrage\r\nbill. More than this, the prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,\r\npromised to give the bill his support. For a time, a very short time, it\r\nis true, we felt that the hour of our freedom might be at hand, that our\r\nprisoners had perhaps already won us our precious symbol--the vote.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, a number of professed suffragists in the House began to\r\ncomplain that Mr. Dickinson's bill, practically the original bill, was\r\nnot \"democratic\" enough, that it would enfranchise only the women of the\r\nupper classes--to which, by the way, most of them belonged. That this\r\nwas not true had been proved again and again from the municipal\r\nregisters, which showed a majority of working women's names as qualified\r\nhouseholders. The contention was but a shallow excuse, and we knew it.\r\nTherefore we were not surprised when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\r\ndeparted from his pledge of support, and allowed the bill to be talked\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFollowing this event, the second Women's Parliament assembled, on the\r\nafternoon of March 20, 1907. As before, we adopted a resolution calling\r\nupon the Government to introduce an official suffrage measure, and again\r\nwe voted to send the resolution from the hall to the Prime Minister.\r\nLady Harberton was chosen to lead the deputation, and instantly hundreds\r\nof women sprang up and volunteered to accompany her. This time the\r\npolice met the women at the door of the hall, and another useless,\r\ndisgraceful scene of barbarous, brute-force opposition took place.\r\nSomething like one thousand police had been sent out to guard the House\r\nof Commons from the peaceful invasion of a few hundred women. All\r\nafternoon and evening we kept Caxton Hall open, the women returning\r\nevery now and again, singly and in small groups, to have their bruises\r\nbathed, or their torn clothing repaired. As night fell the crowds in the\r\nstreet grew denser, and the struggle between the women and the police\r\nbecame more desperate. Lady Harberton, we heard, had succeeded in\r\nreaching the entrance to the House of Commons, nay, had actually managed\r\nto press past the sentries into the lobby, but her resolution had not\r\nbeen presented to the Prime Minister. She and many others were arrested\r\nbefore the police at last succeeded in clearing the streets, and the\r\ndreadful affair was over.\r\n\r\nThe next day, in Westminster police court, the magistrate meted out\r\nsentences varying from twenty shillings or fourteen days to forty\r\nshillings or one month's imprisonment. Two of the women, Miss Woodlock\r\nand Mrs. Chatterton, who had left Holloway only a week before, were, as\r\n\"old offenders,\" given thirty days without the option of a fine. Another\r\nwoman, Mary Leigh, was given thirty days because she offended the\r\nmagistrate's dignity by hanging a \"Votes for Women\" banner over the edge\r\nof the dock. Those of my readers who are unable to connect the word\r\n\"militancy\" with anything milder than arson are invited to reflect that\r\nwithin the first two months of the year 1907 the English Government sent\r\nto prison one hundred and thirty women whose \"militancy\" consisted\r\nmerely of trying to carry a resolution from a hall to the Prime Minister\r\nin the House of Commons. Our crime was called obstructing the police. It\r\nwill be seen that it was the police who did the obstructing.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why neither of these deputations was led by me\r\npersonally. The reason was that I was needed in another capacity, that\r\nof leader and supervisor of the suffrage forces in the field to defeat\r\nGovernment candidates at by-elections. On the night of the second\r\n\"riot,\" while our women were still struggling in the streets, I left\r\nLondon for Hexham in Northumberland, where by our work the majority of\r\nthe Liberal candidate was reduced by a thousand votes. Seven more\r\nby-elections followed in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nOur by-election work was such a new thing in English politics that we\r\nattracted an enormous amount of attention wherever we went. It was our\r\ncustom to begin work the very hour we entered a town. If, on our way\r\nfrom the station to the hotel, we encountered a group of men, say, in\r\nthe market-place, we either stopped and held a meeting on the spot, or\r\nelse we stayed long enough to tell them when and where our meetings were\r\nto be held, and to urge them to attend. The usual first step, after\r\nsecuring lodgings, was to hire a vacant shop, fill the windows with\r\nsuffrage literature, and fling out our purple, green, and white flag.\r\nMeanwhile, some of us were busy hiring the best available hall. If we\r\ngot possession of the battle-ground before the men, we sometimes\r\n\"cornered\" all the good halls and left the candidate nothing but\r\nschoolhouses for his indoor meetings. Truth to tell, our meetings were\r\nso much more popular than theirs that we really needed the larger halls.\r\nOften, a candidate with the Suffragettes for rivals spoke to almost\r\nempty benches. The crowds were away listening to the women.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this greatly displeased the politicians, and it scandalised\r\nmany of the old-fashioned Liberal partisans. In one place, I think it\r\nwas Colne Valley in Yorkshire, an amusing instance of masculine\r\nhostility occurred. We had arrived on a day when both Conservative and\r\nLiberal committees were choosing their candidates, and we thought it a\r\ngood opportunity to hold a series of outdoor meetings. We tried to get\r\na lorry for a rostrum, but the only man in town who had these big vans\r\nto let disapproved of Suffragettes so violently that he wouldn't let us\r\nhave one. So we borrowed a chair from a woman shopkeeper, and went at\r\nit. Soon we had a large crowd and an interested audience. We also got\r\nthe attention of a number of small boys with pea-shooters, and had to\r\nmake our speeches under a blistering fire of dried peas.\r\n\r\nWhile I was speaking the fire ceased, to my relief--for dried peas\r\nsting. I continued my speech with renewed vigor, only to have one of my\r\nbest points spoiled by roars of laughter from the crowd. I finished\r\nsomehow, and sat down; and then it was explained to me that the\r\npea-shooters had been financed by one of the prominent Liberals of the\r\ntown, another man who disapproved of our policy of opposing the\r\nGovernment. As soon as the ammunition gave out this man furnished the\r\nboys with a choice supply of rotten oranges. These were not so easily\r\nhandled, it appeared, for the very first one went wild, and struck the\r\nchivalrous gentleman violently in the neck. This it was that had caused\r\nthe laughter, and stopped the attack on the women.\r\n\r\nWe met with some pretty rough horse-play, and even with some brutality,\r\nin several by-elections, but on the whole we found the men ready, and\r\nthe women more than ready, to listen to us. We tamed and educated a\r\npublic that had always been used to violence at elections. We even tamed\r\nthe boys, who came to the meetings on purpose to skylark. When we were\r\nin Rutlandshire that spring three schoolboys came to see me and told me,\r\nshyly, that they were interested in suffrage. They had had a debate on\r\nthe subject at their school, and although the decision had been for the\r\nother side, all the boys wanted to know more about it. Wouldn't I please\r\nhave a meeting especially for them? Of course I consented, and I found\r\nmy boy audience quite delightful. Indeed, I hope they liked me half as\r\nwell as I did them.\r\n\r\nAll through the spring our by-election work continued with amazing\r\nsuccess, although our part in the Government losses was rarely admitted\r\nby the politicians. The voters knew, however. At an election in Suffolk,\r\nwhere we helped to double the Unionist vote, the successful candidate,\r\nspeaking to the crowd from his hotel window, said, \"What has been the\r\ncause of the great and glorious victory?\" Instantly the crowd roared,\r\n\"Votes for Women!\"--\"Three cheers for the Suffragettes!\" This was not at\r\nall what the successful candidate had intended, but he waved his hand\r\ngraciously and said, \"No doubt the ladies had something to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe newspaper correspondents were not so reluctant to acknowledge our\r\ninfluence. Even when they condemned our policy, they were unsparing in\r\ntheir admiration for our energy, and the courage and ardour of our\r\nworkers. Said the correspondent of the London _Tribune_, a Liberal paper\r\nhostile to our tactics: \"Their staying power, judging them by the\r\nstandards of men, is extraordinary. By taking afternoon as well as\r\nevening meetings, they have worked twice as hard as the men. They are\r\nup earlier, they retire just as late. Women against men, they are\r\nbetter speakers, more logical, better informed, better phrased, with a\r\nsurer insight for the telling argument.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a summer spent in strengthening our forces, organising new\r\nbranches, holding meetings--something like three thousand of these\r\nbetween May and October--invading meetings of Cabinet Ministers--we\r\nmanaged to do that about once every day--electioneering, and getting up\r\nhuge demonstrations in various cities, we arrived at the end of the\r\nyear. In the last months of the year, I directed several hotly contested\r\nby-elections, at one of which I met with one of the most serious\r\nmisadventures of my life.\r\n\r\nThis by-election was held in the division of Mid-Devon, a stronghold of\r\nLiberalism. In fact, since its creation in 1885, the seat has never been\r\nheld by any except a Liberal member. The constituency is a large one,\r\ndivided into eight districts. The population of the towns is a rough and\r\nboisterous one, and its devotion, blind and unreasoning, to the Liberal\r\nparty has always reflected the rude spirit of the voters. A Unionist\r\nwoman told me, shortly after my arrival, that my life would be unsafe if\r\nI dared openly to oppose the Liberal candidate. She had never dared, she\r\nassured me, to wear her party colours in public. However, I did\r\nspeak--in our headquarters at Newton Abbott, the principal town of the\r\ndivision, at Hull, and at Bovey Tracey. We held meetings twice a day,\r\ncalling upon the voters to \"beat the Government in Mid-Devon, as a\r\nmessage that women must have votes next year.\" Although some of the\r\nmeetings were turbulent, we were treated with much more consideration\r\nthan either of the candidates, who, not infrequently, were howled down\r\nand put to flight. Often the air of their meetings was thick with\r\ndecayed vegetables and dirty snowballs. We had some rather lively\r\nsessions, too. Once, at an outdoor meeting, some young roughs dragged\r\nour lorry round and round until it seemed that we must be upset, and\r\nseveral times the language hurled at us from the crowd was quite unfit\r\nfor me to repeat. Still, we escaped actual violence until the day of the\r\nelection, when it was announced that the Unionist candidate had won the\r\nseat by a majority of twelve hundred and eighty. We knew instantly that\r\nthe deepest resentment of the Liberals would be aroused, but it did not\r\noccur to us that the resentment would be directed actively against us.\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration at the polls, my companion, Mrs. Martel, and I\r\nstarted to walk to our lodgings. Some of our friends stopped us, and\r\ndrew our attention to the newly elected Unionist member of Parliament,\r\nwho was being escorted from the polling place by a strong guard of\r\npolice. We were warned that our safety demanded an immediate flight from\r\nthe town. I laughingly assured our friends that I was never afraid to\r\ntrust myself in a crowd, and we walked on. Suddenly we were confronted\r\nby a crowd of young men and boys, clay-cutters from the pits on the edge\r\nof town. These young men, who wore the red rosettes of the Liberal\r\nparty, had just heard of their candidate's defeat, and they were mad\r\nwith rage and humiliation. One of them pointed to us, crying: \"They did\r\nit! Those women did it!\" A yell went up from the crowd, and we were\r\ndeluged with a shower of clay and rotten eggs. We were not especially\r\nfrightened, but the eggs were unbearable, and to escape them we rushed\r\ninto a little grocer's shop close at hand. The grocer's wife closed and\r\nbolted the door, but the poor grocer cried out that his place would be\r\nwrecked. I did not want that to happen, of course, so I asked them to\r\nlet us out by the back door. They led us out the door, into a small back\r\nyard which led into a little lane, whence we expected to make our\r\nescape. But when we reached the yard we found that the rowdies,\r\nanticipating our move, had surged round the corner, and were waiting for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThey seized Mrs. Martel first, and began beating her over the head with\r\ntheir fists, but the brave wife of the shopkeeper, hearing the shouts\r\nand the oaths of the men, flung open the door and rushed to our rescue.\r\nBetween us we managed to tear Mrs. Martel from her captors and get her\r\ninto the house. I expected to get into the house, too, but as I reached\r\nthe threshold a staggering blow fell on the back of my head, rough hands\r\ngrasped the collar of my coat, and I was flung violently to the ground.\r\nStunned, I must have lost consciousness for a moment, for my next\r\nsensation was of cold, wet mud seeping through my clothing. Sight\r\nreturning to me, I perceived the men, silent now, but with a dreadful,\r\nlowering silence, closing in a ring around me. In the centre of the ring\r\nwas an empty barrel, and the horrid thought occurred to me that they\r\nmight intend putting me in it. A long time seemed to pass, while the\r\nring of men slowly drew closer. I looked at them, in their drab clothes\r\nsmeared with yellow pit-clay, and they appeared so underfed, so puny and\r\nsodden, that a poignant pity for them swept over me. \"Poor souls,\" I\r\nthought, and then I said suddenly, \"Are none of you _men_?\" Then one of\r\nthe youths darted toward me, and I knew that whatever was going to\r\nhappen to me was about to begin.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment came shouts, and a rush of police who had fought\r\ntheir way through hostile crowds to rescue us. Of course the mob turned\r\ntail and fled, and I was carried gently into the shop, which the police\r\nguarded for two hours, before it was deemed safe for us to leave in a\r\nclosed motor-car. It was many months before either Mrs. Martel or I\r\nrecovered from our injuries.\r\n\r\nThe rowdies, foiled of their woman prey, went to the Conservative Club,\r\nsmashed all the windows in the house, and kept the members besieged\r\nthere through the night. The next morning the body of a man, frightfully\r\nbruised about the head, was found in the mill-race. Throughout all this\r\ndisorder and probable crime, not a man was arrested. Contrast this, if\r\nyou like, with the treatment given our women in London.\r\n\r\nThe King opened Parliament in great state on January 29, 1908. Again his\r\nspeech omitted all mention of woman suffrage, and again the W. S. P. U.\r\nissued a call for a Women's Parliament, for February 11th, 12th and\r\n13th. Before it was convened we heard that an excellent place in the\r\nballot had been won by a friend of the movement, Mr. Stanger, who\r\npromised to introduce a suffrage bill, February 28th was the day fixed\r\nfor the second reading, and we realised that strong pressure would have\r\nto be brought to bear to prevent the bill being wrecked, as the\r\nDickinson bill had been the previous year. Therefore, on the first day\r\nof the Women's Parliament, almost every woman present volunteered for\r\nthe deputation, which was to try to carry the resolution to the prime\r\nminister. Led by two well-known portrait painters, the deputation left\r\nCaxton Hall and proceeded in orderly ranks, four abreast, toward the\r\nHouse of Commons. The crowds in the streets were enormous, thousands of\r\nsympathisers coming out to help the women, thousands of police\r\ndetermined that the women should not be helped, and thousands of curious\r\nspectators. When the struggle was over, fifty women were locked up in\r\npolice-court cells.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when the cases were tried, Mr. Muskett, who prosecuted\r\nfor the Crown, and who was perhaps a little tired of telling the\r\nSuffragettes that these scenes in the streets must cease, and then\r\nseeing them go on exactly as if he had not spoken, made a very severe\r\nand terrifying address. He told the women that this time they would be\r\nsubject to the usual maximum of two months' imprisonment, with the\r\noption of a fine of five pounds, but that, in case they ever offended\r\nagain, the law had worse terrors in store for them. It was proposed to\r\nrevive, for the benefit of the Suffragettes, an Act passed in the reign\r\nof Charles II, which dealt with \"Tumultuous Petitions, either to the\r\nCrown or Parliament.\" This Act provided that no person should dare to go\r\nto the King or to Parliament \"with any petition, complaint,\r\nremonstrance, declaration or other address\" accompanied with a number of\r\npersons above twelve. A fine of one hundred pounds, or three months'\r\nimprisonment, might be imposed under this law. The magistrate then\r\nsentenced all but two of the women to be bound over for twelve months,\r\nor to serve six weeks in the second division. Two other women, \"old\r\noffenders,\" were given one month in the third division, or lowest class.\r\nAll the prisoners, except two who had very ill relatives at home, chose\r\nthe prison sentence.\r\n\r\nThe next day's session of the Women's Parliament was one of intense\r\nexcitement, as the women reviewed the events of the previous day, the\r\ntrials, and especially the threat to revive the obsolete Act of Charles\r\nII, an act _which was passed to obstruct the progress of the Liberal\r\nparty, which came into existence under the Stuarts, and under the second\r\nCharles was fighting for its life_. It was an amazing thing that the\r\npolitical descendants of these men were proposing to revive the Act to\r\nobstruct the advance of the women's cause, fighting for its life under\r\nGeorge V and his Liberal government. At least, it was evidence that the\r\nGovernment were baffled in their attempt to crush our movement.\r\nChristabel Pankhurst, presiding over the second session of the Women's\r\nParliament, said: \"At last it is realized that women are fighting for\r\nfreedom, as their fathers fought. If they want twelve women, aye, and\r\nmore than twelve, if a hundred women are wanted to be tried under that\r\nact and sent to prison for three months, they can be found.\"\r\n\r\nI was not present at this session, nor had I been present at the first\r\none. I was working in a by-election at South Leeds, the last of several\r\nimportant by-elections in great industrial centres, where our success\r\nwas unquestioned, except by the Liberal press. The elections had wound\r\nup with a great procession, and a meeting of 100,000 people on Hounslet\r\nMoor. The most wonderful enthusiasm marked that meeting. I shall never\r\nforget what splendid order the people kept, in spite of the fact that no\r\npolice protection was given us; how the vast crowd parted to let our\r\nprocession through; how the throngs of mill women kept up a chorus in\r\nbroad Yorkshire: \"Shall us win? Shall us have the vote? We shall!\" No\r\nwonder the old people shook their beads, and declared that \"there had\r\nnever been owt like it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nWith those brave shouts in my ears, I hurried down to London for the\r\nconcluding session of the parliament, for I had determined that I must\r\nbe the first person to challenge the Government to carry out their\r\nthreat to revive the old Act of Charles II. I made a long speech to the\r\nwomen that day, telling them something of my experiences of the past\r\nmonths, and how all that I had seen and heard throughout the country had\r\nonly deepened my conviction of the necessity for women's votes. \"I\r\nfeel,\" I concluded, \"that the time has come when I must act, and I wish\r\nto be one of those to carry our resolution to Parliament this afternoon.\r\nMy experience in the country, and especially in South Leeds, has taught\r\nme things that Cabinet Ministers, who have not had that experience, do\r\nnot know, and has made me feel that I must make one final attempt to see\r\nthem, and to urge them to reconsider their position before some terrible\r\ndisaster has occurred.\"\r\n\r\nAmid a good deal of excitement and emotion, we chose the requisite\r\nthirteen women, who were prepared to be arrested and tried under the\r\nCharles II \"Tumultuous Petitions\" Act. I had not entirely recovered from\r\nthe attack made upon me at Mid-Devon, and my wrenched ankle was still\r\ntoo sensitive to make walking anything but a painful process. Seeing me\r\nbegin almost at once to limp badly, Mrs. Drummond, with characteristic,\r\nblunt kindness, called to a man driving a dog-cart and asked him if he\r\nwould drive me to the House of Commons. He readily agreed, and I mounted\r\nto the seat behind him, the other women forming in line behind the cart.\r\nWe had not gone far when the police, who already surrounded us in great\r\nforce, ordered me to dismount. Of course I obeyed and walked, or rather\r\nlimped along with my companions. They would have supported me, but the\r\npolice insisted that we should walk single-file. Presently I grew so\r\nfaint from the pain of the ankle that I called to two of the women, who\r\ntook hold of my arms and helped me on my way. This was our one act of\r\ndisobedience to police orders. We moved with difficulty, for the crowd\r\nwas of incredible size. All around, as far as eye could see, was the\r\ngreat moving, swaying, excited multitude, and surrounding us on all\r\nsides were regiments of uniformed police, foot and mounted. You might\r\nhave supposed that instead of thirteen women, one of them lame, walking\r\nquietly along, the town was in the hands of an armed mob.\r\n\r\nWe had progressed as far as the entrance to Parliament Square, when two\r\nstalwart policemen suddenly grasped my arms on either side and told me\r\nthat I was under arrest. My two companions, because they refused to\r\nleave me, were also arrested, and a few minutes later Annie Kenney and\r\nfive other women suffered arrest. That night we were released on bail,\r\nand the next morning we were arraigned in Westminster police court for\r\ntrial under the Charles II Act. But, as it turned out, the authorities,\r\nembarrassed by our readiness to test the act, announced that they had\r\nchanged their minds, and would continue, for the present, to treat us as\r\ncommon street brawlers.\r\n\r\nThis was my first trial, and I listened, with a suspicion that my ears\r\nwere playing tricks with my reason, to the most astonishing perjuries\r\nput forth by the prosecution. I heard that we had set forth from Caxton\r\nHall with noisy shouts and songs, that we had resorted to the most\r\nriotous and vulgar behaviour, knocking off policemen's helmets,\r\nassaulting the officers right and left as we marched. Our testimony, and\r\nthat of our witnesses, was ignored. When I tried to speak in my own\r\ndefence, I was cut short rudely, and was told briefly that I and the\r\nothers must choose between being bound over or going to prison, in the\r\nsecond division, for six weeks.\r\n\r\nI remember only vaguely the long, jolting ride across London to Holloway\r\nPrison. We stopped at Pentonville, the men's prison, to discharge\r\nseveral men prisoners, and I remember shuddering at the thought of our\r\nwomen, many of them little past girlhood, being haled to prison in the\r\nsame van with criminal men. Arriving at the prison, we groped our way\r\nthrough dim corridors into the reception-ward, where we were lined up\r\nagainst the wall for a superficial medical examination. After that we\r\nwere locked up in separate cells, unfurnished, except for low, wooden\r\nstools.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an endless time before my cell door was opened by a wardress,\r\nwho ordered me to follow her. I entered a room where another wardress\r\nsat at a table, ready to take an inventory of my effects. Obeying an\r\norder to undress, I took off my gown, then paused. \"Take off\r\neverything,\" was the next order. \"Everything?\" I faltered. It seemed\r\nimpossible that they expected me to strip. In fact, they did allow me to\r\ntake off my last garments in the shelter of a bath-room. I shivered\r\nmyself into some frightful underclothing, old and patched and stained,\r\nsome coarse, brown woollen stockings with red stripes, and the hideous\r\nprison dress stamped all over with the broad arrow of disgrace. I fished\r\na pair of shoes out of a big basket of shoes, old and mostly mismates. A\r\npair of coarse but clean sheets, a towel, a mug of cold cocoa, and a\r\nthick slice of brown bread were given me, and I was conducted to my\r\ncell.\r\n\r\nMy first sensations when the door was locked upon me were not altogether\r\ndisagreeable. I was desperately weary, for I had been working hard,\r\nperhaps a little too hard, for several strenuous months. The excitement\r\nand fatigue of the previous day, and the indignation I had suffered\r\nthroughout the trial, had combined to bring me to the point of\r\nexhaustion, and I was glad to throw myself on my hard prison bed and\r\nclose my eyes. But soon the relief of being alone, and with nothing to\r\ndo, passed from me. Holloway Prison is a very old place, and it has the\r\ndisadvantages of old places which have never known enough air and\r\nsunshine. It reeks with the odours of generations of bad ventilation,\r\nand it contrives to be at once the stuffiest and the draughtiest\r\nbuilding I have ever been in. Soon I found myself sickening for fresh\r\nair. My head began to ache. Sleep fled. I lay all night suffering with\r\ncold, gasping for air, aching with fatigue, and painfully wide awake.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was fairly ill, but I said nothing about it. One does not\r\nexpect to be comfortable in prison. As a matter of fact, one's mental\r\nsuffering is so much greater than any common physical distress that the\r\nlatter is almost forgotten. The English prison system is altogether\r\nmediaeval and outworn. In some of its details the system has improved\r\nsince they began to send the Suffragettes to Holloway. I may say that\r\nwe, by our public denunciation of the system, have forced these slight\r\nimprovements. In 1907 the rules were excessively cruel. The poor\r\nprisoner, when she entered Holloway, dropped, as it were, into a tomb.\r\nNo letters and no visitors were allowed for the first month of the\r\nsentence. Think of it--a whole month, more than four weeks, without\r\nsending or receiving a single word. One's nearest and dearest may have\r\ngone through dreadful suffering, may have been ill, may have died,\r\nmeantime. One was given plenty of time to imagine all these things, for\r\nthe prisoner was kept in solitary confinement in a narrow, dimly-lit\r\ncell, twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four. Solitary confinement is\r\ntoo terrible a punishment to inflict on any human being, no matter what\r\nhis crime. Hardened criminals in the men's prisons, it is said, often\r\nbeg for the lash instead. Picture what it must be to a woman who has\r\ncommitted some small offence, for most of the women who go to Holloway\r\nare small offenders, sitting alone, day after day, in the heavy silence\r\nof a cell--thinking of her children at home--thinking, thinking. Some\r\nwomen go mad. Many suffer from shattered nerves for a long period after\r\nrelease. It is impossible to believe that any woman ever emerged from\r\nsuch a horror less criminal than when she entered it.\r\n\r\nTwo days of solitary confinement, broken each day by an hour of silent\r\nexercise in a bitterly cold courtyard, and I was ordered to the\r\nhospital. There I thought I should be a little more comfortable. The bed\r\nwas better, the food a little better, and small comforts, such as warm\r\nwater for washing, were allowed. I slept a little the first night. About\r\nmidnight I awoke, and sat up in bed, listening. A woman in the cell next\r\nmine was moaning in long, sobbing breaths of mortal pain. She ceased for\r\na few minutes, then moaned again, horribly. The truth flashed over me,\r\nturning me sick, as I realised that a life was coming into being, there\r\nin that frightful prison. A woman, imprisoned by men's laws, was giving\r\na child to the world. A child born in a cell! I shall never forget that\r\nnight, nor what I suffered with the birth-pangs of that woman, who, I\r\nfound later, was simply waiting trial on a charge which was found to be\r\nbaseless.\r\n\r\nThe days passed very slowly, the nights more slowly still. Being in\r\nhospital, I was deprived of chapel, and also of work. Desperate, at last\r\nI begged the wardress for some sewing, and she kindly gave me a skirt of\r\nher own to hem, and later some coarse knitting to do. Prisoners were\r\nallowed a few books, mostly of the \"Sunday-school\" kind. One day I\r\nasked the chaplain if there were not some French or German books in the\r\nlibrary, and he brought me a treasure, \"_Autour de mon Jardin_,\" by\r\nJules Janin. For a few days I was quite happy, reading my book and\r\ntranslating it on the absurd little slate they gave us in lieu of paper\r\nand pencil. That slate was, after all, a great comfort. I did all kinds\r\nof things with it. I kept a calendar, I wrote all the French poetry I\r\ncould remember on it, I even recorded old school chorals and old English\r\nexercises. It helped wonderfully to pass the endless hours until my\r\nrelease. I even forgot the cold, which was the harder to bear because of\r\nthe fur coat, which I knew was put away, ticketed with my name. I begged\r\nthem for the coat, but they wouldn't let me have it.\r\n\r\nAt last the time came when they gave me back all my things, and let me\r\ngo free. At the door the Governor spoke to me, and asked me if I had any\r\ncomplaints to make. \"Not of you,\" I replied, \"nor of any of the\r\nwardresses. Only of this prison, and all of men's prisons. We shall raze\r\nthem to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nBack in my comfortable home, surrounded by loving friends, I would have\r\nrested quietly for a few days, but there was a great meeting that night\r\nat Albert Hall, to mark the close of a week of self-denial to raise\r\nmoney for the year's campaign. Women had sold papers, flowers, toys,\r\nswept crossings, and sung in the streets for the cause. Many women, well\r\nknown in the world of art and letters, did these things. I felt that I\r\nshould be doing little if I merely attended the meeting. So I went. My\r\nrelease was not expected until the following morning, and no one thought\r\nof my appearing at the meeting. My chairman's seat was decorated with a\r\nlarge placard with the inscription, \"Mrs. Pankhurst's Chair.\" After all\r\nthe others were seated, the speakers, and hundreds of ex-prisoners. I\r\nwalked quietly onto the stage, took the placard out of the chair and sat\r\ndown. A great cry went up from the women as they sprang from their seats\r\nand stretched their hands toward me. It was some time before I could see\r\nthem for my tears, or speak to them for the emotion that shook me like a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I, with the other released prisoners, drove off to\r\nPeckham, a constituency of London, where the W. S. P. U. members were\r\nfighting a vigorous by-election. In open brakes we paraded the streets,\r\ndressed in our prison clothes, or exact reproductions of them.\r\nNaturally, we attracted a great deal of attention and sympathy, and our\r\ndaily meetings on Peckham Rye, as their common is known, drew enormous\r\ncrowds. When polling day came our members were stationed at every\r\npolling booth, and many men as they came to the booths told us that they\r\nwere, for the first time, voting \"for the women,\" by which they meant\r\nagainst the Government. That night, amid great excitement, it was made\r\nknown that the Liberal majority of 2,339 at the last general election\r\nhad been turned into a Conservative majority of 2,494. Letters poured\r\ninto the newspapers, declaring that the loss of this important Liberal\r\nseat was due almost entirely to the work of the Suffragettes, and many\r\nprominent Liberals called upon party leaders to start doing something\r\nfor women before the next general election. The Liberal leaders, with\r\nthe usual perspicacity of politicians, responded not at all. Instead\r\nthey beheld with approval the rise to highest power the arch-enemy of\r\nthe suffragists, Mr. Asquith.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith became prime minister about Easter time, 1908, on the\r\nresignation, on account of ill health, of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.\r\nMr. Asquith was chosen, not because of any remarkable record of\r\nstatesmanship, nor yet because of great personal popularity--for he\r\npossessed neither--but simply because no better man seemed available\r\njust then. He was known as a clever, astute, and somewhat unscrupulous\r\nlawyer. He had filled several high offices to the satisfaction of his\r\nparty, and under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had been Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, a post which is generally regarded as a stepping-stone to the\r\nPremiership. The best thing the Liberal press found to say of the new\r\nPremier was that he was a \"strong\" man. Generally in politics this term\r\nis used to describe an obstinate man, and this we already knew Mr.\r\nAsquith to be. He was a bluntly outspoken opponent of woman suffrage,\r\nand it was sufficiently plain to us that no methods of education or\r\npersuasion would ever prove successful where he was concerned. Therefore\r\nthe necessity of action on our part was greater than ever.\r\n\r\nSuch an opportunity presented itself at once through changes that took\r\nplace in the new Cabinet. According to English law, all new comers into\r\nthe Cabinet are obliged to resign their seats in Parliament and offer\r\nthemselves to their constituencies for re-election. Besides these\r\nvacancies there were several others, on account of death or elevations\r\nto the peerage. This made necessary a number of by-elections, and the\r\nWomen's Social and Political Union once more went into the field against\r\nthe Liberal candidates. I shall deal no further with these by-elections\r\nthan is necessary to show the effect of our work on the Government, and\r\nits subsequent effect on our movement--which was to force us into more\r\nand more militancy. I shall leave it to the honest judgment of my\r\nreaders to place where it ought rightly to be placed the responsibility\r\nfor those first broken windows.\r\n\r\nWe selected as our first candidate for defeat Mr. Winston Churchill, who\r\nwas about to appeal to his constituency of North West Manchester to\r\nsanction his appointment as president of the Board of Trade. My daughter\r\nChristabel took charge of this election, and the work of herself and her\r\nforces was so successful that Mr. Churchill lost his seat by 420 votes.\r\nAll the newspapers acknowledged that it was the Suffragettes who had\r\ndefeated Mr. Churchill, and one Liberal newspaper, the London _Daily\r\nNews_, called upon the party to put a stop to an intolerable state of\r\naffairs by granting the women's demand for votes.\r\n\r\nAnother seat was immediately secured for Mr. Churchill, that of Dundee,\r\nthen strongly--in the merely party sense--Liberal, and therefore safe.\r\nNevertheless, we determined to fight Mr. Churchill there, to defeat him\r\nif possible, and to bring down the Liberal majority in any case. I took\r\npersonal charge of the campaign, holding a very large meeting in\r\nKinnaird Hall on the evening before Mr. Churchill's arrival. Although he\r\nfelt absolutely sure of election in this Scottish constituency, Mr.\r\nChurchill dreaded the effect of our presence on the Liberal women. The\r\nsecond meeting he addressed in Dundee was held for women only, and\r\ninstead of asking for support of the various measures actually on the\r\ngovernment's programme, the politician's usual method, he talked about\r\nthe certainty of securing, within a short time, the Parliamentary\r\nfranchise for women. \"No one,\" he declared, \"can be blind to the fact\r\nthat at the next general election woman suffrage will be a real,\r\npractical issue; and the next Parliament, I think, ought to see the\r\ngratification of the women's claims. I do not exclude the possibility of\r\nthe suffrage being dealt with in this Parliament.\" Mr. Churchill\r\nearnestly reiterated his claim to be considered a true friend of the\r\nwomen's cause; but when pressed for a pledge that his Government would\r\ntake action, he urged his inability to speak for his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis specious promise, or rather, prophecy of woman suffrage at some\r\nindefinite time, won over a great many of the Liberal women, who\r\nforthwith went staunchly to work for Mr. Churchill's election. Dundee\r\nhas a large population of extremely poor people, workers in the jute\r\nmills and the marmalade factories. Some concessions in the matter of the\r\nsugar tax, timely made, and the announcement that the new Government\r\nmeant to establish old age pensions, created an immense wave of Liberal\r\nenthusiasm that swept Mr. Churchill into office in spite of our work,\r\nwhich was untiring. We held something like two hundred meetings, and on\r\nelection eve, five huge demonstrations--four of them in the open air and\r\none which filled a large drill hall. Polling day, May 9th, was very\r\nexciting. For every Suffragette at the polling-booths there were half a\r\ndozen Liberal men and women, handing out bills with such legends as\r\n\"Vote for Churchill, and never mind the women,\" and \"Put Churchill in\r\nand keep the women out.\" Yet for all their efforts, Mr. Churchill polled\r\n2200 votes less than his Liberal predecessor had polled at the general\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nIn the first seven by-elections following Mr. Asquith's elevation to the\r\npremiership, we succeeded in pulling down the Liberal vote by 6663. Then\r\nsomething happened to check our progress. Mr. Asquith received a\r\ndeputation of Liberal members of Parliament, who urged him to allow the\r\nStanger suffrage bill, which had passed its second reading by a large\r\nmajority, to be carried into law. Mr. Asquith replied that he himself\r\ndid not wish to see women enfranchised, and that it would not be\r\npossible for the Government to give the required facilities to Mr.\r\nStanger's bill. He added that he was fully alive to the many defects of\r\nthe electoral system, and that the Government intended, \"barring\r\naccidents,\" to bring in a reform bill before the close of that\r\nParliament. Woman suffrage would have no place in it, but it would be so\r\nworded that a woman-suffrage amendment might be added if any member\r\nchose to move one. In that case, said Mr. Asquith, he should not\r\nconsider it the duty of the Government to oppose the amendment if it\r\nwere approved by a majority of the House of Commons--_provided_ that the\r\namendment was on democratic lines, and that it had back of it the\r\nsupport, the strong and undoubted support, of the women of the country\r\nas well as the present electorate.\r\n\r\nOne would not suppose that such an evasive utterance as this would be\r\nregarded in any quarter as a promise that woman suffrage would be given\r\nany real chances of success under the Asquith Government. That it was,\r\nby many, taken quite seriously is but another proof of the gullibility\r\nof the party-blinded public. The Liberal press lauded Mr. Asquith's\r\n\"promise,\" and called for a truce of militancy in order that the\r\nGovernment might have every opportunity to act. Said the _Star_, in a\r\nleader typical of many others: \"The meaning of Mr. Asquith's pledge is\r\nplain. Woman's suffrage will be passed through the House of Commons\r\nbefore the present Government goes to the country.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the women's Liberal Associations, they were quite delirious with\r\njoy. In a conference called for the purpose of passing resolutions of\r\ngratitude, Lady Carlisle said: \"This is a glorious day of rejoicing. Our\r\ngreat Prime Minister, all honour to him, has opened a way to us by which\r\nwe can enter into that inheritance from which we have been too long\r\ndebarred.\"\r\n\r\nAt the two following by-elections, the last of the series, enormous\r\nposters were exhibited, \"Premier's Great Reform Bill: Votes for Women.\"\r\nWe tried to tell the electors that the pledge was false on the face of\r\nit; that the specious proviso that the amendment be \"democratic\" left no\r\ndoubt that the Government would cause the rejection of any practical\r\namendment that might be moved. Our words fell on deaf ears, and the\r\nLiberal majorities soared.\r\n\r\nJust a week later Mr. Asquith was questioned in the House of Commons by\r\na slightly alarmed anti-suffragist member. The member asked Mr. Asquith\r\nwhether he considered himself pledged to introduce the reform hill\r\nduring that Parliament, whether he meant to allow such a bill to carry a\r\nwoman-suffrage amendment, if such were moved, and whether, in that case,\r\nthe suffrage amendment would become part of the Government policy.\r\nEvasive as ever, the Prime Minister, after some sparring, replied, \"My\r\nhonourable friend has asked me a question with regard to a remote and\r\nspeculative future.\" Thus was our interpretation of Mr. Asquith's\r\n\"promise\" justified from his own lips. Yet the Liberal women still clung\r\nto the hope of Government action, and the Liberal press pretended to\r\ncling to it. As for the Women's Social and Political Union, we prepared\r\nfor more work. We had to strike out along a new line, since it was\r\nevident that the Government could, for a time at least, neutralise our\r\nby-election work by more false promises. Consistent with our policy, of\r\nnever going further than the Government compelled us to go, we made our\r\nfirst action a perfectly peaceable one.\r\n\r\nOn the day when the Stanger bill had reached its second reading in the\r\nHouse, and several days after I had gone to Holloway for the first time,\r\nMr. Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary, made a speech which greatly\r\ninterested the Suffragettes. He professed himself a suffragist, and\r\ndeclared that he intended to vote for the bill. Nevertheless, he was\r\nconfident that it could not pass, because of the division in the\r\nCabinet, and because it had no political party united either for or\r\nagainst it. Woman suffrage, said Mr. Gladstone, must advance to victory\r\nthrough all the stages that are required for great reforms to mature.\r\nFirst academic discussion, then effective action, was the history of\r\nmen's suffrage; it must be the same with women's suffrage. \"Men,\"\r\ndeclared Mr. Gladstone, \"have learned this lesson and know the necessity\r\nfor demonstrating the greatness of their movement, and for establishing\r\nthat _force majeure_ which actuates and arms a Government for effective\r\nwork. That is the task before the supporters of this great movement.\r\nLooking back at the great political crises in the thirties, the sixties\r\nand the eighties, it will be found that the people did not go about in\r\nsmall crowds, nor were they content with enthusiastic meetings in large\r\nhalls; they assembled in their tens of thousands all over the country.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" added Mr. Gladstone, \"it is not to be expected that women\r\ncan assemble in such masses, but power belongs to masses, and through\r\nthis power a Government can be influenced into more effective action\r\nthan a Government will be likely to take under present conditions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Women's Social and Political Union determined to answer this\r\nchallenge. If assembling in great masses was all that was necessary to\r\nconvince the Government that woman suffrage had passed the academic\r\nstage and now demanded political action, we thought we could undertake\r\nto satisfy the most skeptical member of the Cabinet. We knew that we\r\ncould organise a demonstration that would out-rival any of the great\r\nfranchise demonstrations held by men in the thirties, sixties, and\r\neighties. The largest number of people ever gathered in Hyde Park was\r\nsaid to have approximated 72,000. We determined to organise a Hyde Park\r\ndemonstration of at least 250,000 people. Sunday, June 21, 1908, was\r\nfixed for the date of this demonstration, and for many months we worked\r\nto make it a day notable in the history of the movement. Our example was\r\nemulated by the non-militant suffragists, who organised a fine\r\nprocession of their own, about a week before our demonstration. Thirteen\r\nthousand women, it was said, marched in that procession.\r\n\r\nOn our demonstration we spent, for advertising alone, over a thousand\r\npounds, or five thousand dollars. We covered the hoardings of London and\r\nof all the principal provincial cities with great posters bearing\r\nportraits of the women who were to preside at the twenty platforms from\r\nwhich speeches were to be made; a map of London, showing the routes by\r\nwhich the seven processions were to advance, and a plan of the Hyde Park\r\nmeeting-place were also shown. London, of course, was thoroughly\r\norganised. For weeks a small army of women was busy chalking\r\nannouncements on sidewalks, distributing handbills, canvassing from\r\nhouse to house, advertising the demonstration by posters and sandwich\r\nboards carried through the streets. We invited everybody to be present,\r\nincluding both Houses of Parliament. A few days before the demonstration\r\nMrs. Drummond and a number of other women hired and decorated a launch\r\nand sailed up the Thames to the Houses of Parliament, arriving at the\r\nhour when members entertain their women friends at tea on the terrace.\r\nEveryone left the tables and crowded to the water's edge as the boat\r\nstopped, and Mrs. Drummond's strong, clear voice pealed out her\r\ninvitation to the Cabinet and the members of Parliament to join the\r\nwomen's demonstration in Hyde Park. \"Come to the park on Sunday,\" she\r\ncried. \"You shall have police protection, and there will be no arrests,\r\nwe promise you.\" An alarmed someone telephoned for the police boats, but\r\nas they appeared, the women's boat steamed away.\r\n\r\nWhat a day was Sunday, June 21st--clear, radiant, filled with golden\r\nsunshine! As I advanced, leading, with the venerable Mrs.\r\nWolstenholm-Elmy, the first of the seven processions, it seemed to me\r\nthat all London had turned out to witness our demonstration. And a\r\ngoodly part of London followed the processions. When I mounted my\r\nplatform in Hyde Park, and surveyed the mighty throngs that waited there\r\nand the endless crowds that were still pouring into the park from all\r\ndirections, I was filled with amazement not unmixed with awe. Never had\r\nI imagined that so many people could be gathered together to share in a\r\npolitical demonstration. It was a gay and beautiful as well as an\r\nawe-inspiring spectacle, for the white gowns and flower-trimmed hats of\r\nthe women, against the background of ancient trees, gave the park the\r\nappearance of a vast garden in full bloom.\r\n\r\nThe bugles sounded, and the speakers at each of the twenty platforms\r\nbegan their addresses, which could not have been heard by more than half\r\nor a third of the vast audience. Notwithstanding this, they remained to\r\nthe end. At five o'clock the bugles sounded again, the speaking ceased,\r\nand the resolution calling upon the Government to bring in an official\r\nwoman-suffrage bill without delay was carried at every platform, often\r\nwithout a dissenting vote. Then, with a three-times-repeated cry of\r\n\"Votes for Women!\" from the assembled multitude, the great meeting\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ said next day: \"Its organisers had counted on an\r\naudience of 250,000. That expectation was certainly fulfilled, and\r\nprobably it was doubled, and it would be difficult to contradict any one\r\nwho asserted that it was trebled. Like the distances and the number of\r\nthe stars, the facts were beyond the threshold of perception.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Express_ said: \"It is probable that so many people never\r\nbefore stood in one square mass anywhere in England. Men who saw the\r\ngreat Gladstone meeting years ago said that compared with yesterday's\r\nmultitude it was as nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWe felt that we had answered the challenge in Mr. Gladstone's\r\ndeclaration that \"power belongs to the masses,\" and that through this\r\npower the Government could be influenced; so it was with real hope that\r\nwe despatched a copy of the resolution to the Prime Minister, asking him\r\nwhat answer the Government would make to that unparalleled gathering of\r\nmen and women. Mr. Asquith replied formally that he had nothing to add\r\nto his previous statement--that the Government intended, at some\r\nindefinite time, to bring in a general reform bill which _might_ be\r\namended to include woman suffrage. Our wonderful demonstration, it\r\nappeared, had made no impression whatever upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we had reached a point where we had to choose between two\r\nalternatives. We had exhausted argument. Therefore either we had to give\r\nup our agitation altogether, as the suffragists of the eighties\r\nvirtually had done, or else we must act, and go on acting, until the\r\nselfishness and the obstinacy of the Government was broken down, or the\r\nGovernment themselves destroyed. Until forced to do so, the Government,\r\nwe perceived, would never give women the vote.\r\n\r\nWe realised the truth of John Bright's words, spoken while the reform\r\nbill of 1867 was being agitated. Parliament, John Bright then declared,\r\nhad never been hearty for any reform. The Reform Act of 1832 had been\r\nwrested by force from the Government of that day, and now before\r\nanother, he said, could be carried, the agitators would have to fill the\r\nstreets with people from Charing Cross to Westminster Abbey. Acting on\r\nJohn Bright's advice, we issued a call to the public to join us in\r\nholding a huge demonstration, on June 30th outside the House of Commons.\r\nWe wanted to be sure that the Government saw as well as read of our\r\nimmense following. A public proclamation from the Commissioner of\r\nPolice, warning the public not to assemble in Parliament Square and\r\ndeclaring that the approaches to the Houses of Parliament must be kept\r\nopen, was at once issued.\r\n\r\nWe persisted in announcing that the demonstration would take place, and\r\nI wrote a letter to Mr. Asquith telling him that a deputation would wait\r\nupon him at half-past four on the afternoon of June 30th. We held the\r\nusual Women's Parliament in Caxton Hall, after which Mrs. Pethick\r\nLawrence, eleven other women, and myself, set forth. We met with no\r\nopposition from the police, but marched through cheering crowds of\r\nspectators to the Strangers' Entrance to the House of Commons. Here we\r\nwere met by a large group of uniformed men commanded by Inspector\r\nScantlebury, of the police. The inspector, whom I knew personally,\r\nstepped forward and demanded officially, \"Are you Mrs. Pankhurst, and is\r\nthis your deputation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"My orders are to exclude you from the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Mr. Asquith received my letter?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nFor answer the inspector drew my letter from his pocket and handed it to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Did Mr. Asquith return no message, no kind of reply?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the inspector.\r\n\r\nWe turned and walked back to Caxton Hall, to tell the waiting audience\r\nwhat had occurred. We resolved that there was nothing to do but wait\r\npatiently until evening, and see how well the public would respond to\r\nour call to meet in Parliament Square. Already we knew that the streets\r\nwere filled with people, and early as it was the crowds were increasing\r\nrapidly. At eight we went out in groups from Caxton Hall, to find\r\nParliament Square packed with a throng, estimated next day at least\r\n100,000. From the steps of public buildings, from stone copings, from\r\nthe iron railings of the Palace Yard, to which they clung precariously,\r\nour women made speeches until the police pulled them down and flung them\r\ninto the moving, swaying, excited crowds. Some of the women were\r\narrested, others were merely ordered to move on. Mingled cheers and\r\njeers rose from the spectators. Some of the men were roughs who had come\r\nout to amuse themselves. Others were genuinely sympathetic, and tried\r\nvaliantly to help us to reach the House of Commons. Again and again the\r\npolice lines were broken, and it was only as the result of repeated\r\ncharges by mounted police that the people's attacks were repelled. Many\r\nmembers of Parliament, including Mr. Lloyd-George, Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill, and Mr. Herbert Gladstone, came out to witness the struggle,\r\nwhich lasted until midnight and resulted in the arrest of twenty-nine\r\nwomen. Two of these women were arrested after they had each thrown a\r\nstone through a window of Mr. Asquith's official residence in Downing\r\nStreet, the value of the windows being about $2.40.\r\n\r\nThis was the first window-breaking in our history. Mrs. Mary Leigh and\r\nMiss Edith New, who had thrown the stones, sent word to me from the\r\npolice court that, having acted without orders, they would not resent\r\nrepudiation from headquarters. Far from repudiating them, I went at once\r\nto see them in their cells, and assured them of my approval of their\r\nact. The smashing of windows is a time-honoured method of showing\r\ndispleasure in a political situation. As one of the newspapers,\r\ncommenting on the affair, truly said, \"When the King and Queen dine at\r\nApsley on the 13th inst. they will be entertained in rooms the windows\r\nof which the Duke of Wellington was obliged to protect with iron\r\nshutters from the fury of his political opponents.\"\r\n\r\nIn Winchester a few years ago, to give but one instance, a great riot\r\ntook place as a protest against the removal of a historic gun from one\r\npart of the town to another. In the course of this riot windows were\r\nbroken and other property of various kinds was destroyed, very serious\r\ndamage being done. No punishment was administered in respect of this\r\nriot and the authorities, bowing to public opinion thus riotously\r\nexpressed, restored the gun to its original situation.\r\n\r\nWindow-breaking, when Englishmen do it, is regarded as honest expression\r\nof political opinion. Window-breaking, when Englishwomen do it, is\r\ntreated as a crime. In sentencing Mrs. Leigh and Miss New to two months\r\nin the first division, the magistrate used very severe language, and\r\ndeclared that such a thing must never happen again. Of course the women\r\nassured him that it would happen again. Said Mrs. Leigh: \"We have no\r\nother course but to rebel against oppression, and if necessary to resort\r\nto stronger measures. This fight is going on.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1908 is remembered as one of the most oppressively hot\r\nseasons the country had known for years. Our prisoners in Holloway\r\nsuffered intensely, some being made desperately ill from the heat, the\r\nbad air, and the miserable food. We who spent the summer campaigning\r\nsuffered also, but in less degree. It was a tremendous relief when the\r\ncool days of autumn set in, and it was with renewed vigour that we\r\nprepared for the opening day of Parliament, which was October 12th.\r\nAgain we resolved to send a deputation to the Prime Minister, and again\r\nwe invited the general public to take part in the demonstration. We had\r\nprinted thousands of little handbills bearing this inscription: \"Men and\r\nWomen, Help the Suffragettes to Rush the House of Commons, on Tuesday\r\nEvening, October 13th, at 7:30.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 11th, we held a large meeting in Trafalgar Square, my\r\ndaughter Christabel, Mrs. Drummond and I speaking from the plinth of the\r\nNelson monument. Mr. Lloyd-George, as we afterward learned, was a member\r\nof the audience. The police were there, taking ample notes of our\r\nspeeches. We had not failed to notice that they were watching us daily,\r\ndogging our footsteps, and showing in numerous ways that they were under\r\norders to keep track of all our movements. The climax came at noon on\r\nOctober 12th, when Christabel, Mrs. Drummond and I were each served with\r\nan imposing legal document which read, \"Information has been laid this\r\nday by the Commissioner of Police that you, in the month of October, in\r\nthe year 1908, were guilty of conduct likely to provoke a breach of the\r\npeace by initiating and causing to be initiated, by publishing and\r\ncausing to be published, a certain handbill, calling upon and inciting\r\nthe public to do a certain wrongful and illegal act, viz., to rush the\r\nHouse of Commons at 7:30 P.M. on October 13th inst.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. PANKHURST AND CHRISTABEL HIDING FROM THE POLICE ON\r\nTHE ROOF GARDEN AT CLEMENTS INN\r\n\r\n_October, 1908_]\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph was a summons to appear at Bow Street police station\r\nthat same afternoon at three o'clock. We did not go to Bow Street police\r\nstation. We went instead to a crowded \"At Home\" at Queen's Hall, where\r\nit can be imagined that our news created great excitement. The place was\r\nsurrounded by constables, and the police reporters were on hand to take\r\nstenographic reports of everything that was said from the platform. Once\r\nan excited cry was raised that a police inspector was coming in to\r\narrest us. But the officer merely brought a message that the summons had\r\nbeen adjourned until the following morning.\r\n\r\nIt did not suit our convenience to obey the adjourned summons quite so\r\nearly, so I wrote a polite note to the police, saying that we would be\r\nin our headquarters, No. 4 Clements Inn, the next evening at six\r\no'clock, and would then be at his disposal. Warrants for our arrests\r\nwere quickly issued, and Inspector Jarvis was instructed to execute them\r\nat once. This he found impossible to do, for Mrs. Drummond was spending\r\nher last day of liberty on private business, while my daughter and I had\r\nretreated to another part of Clements Inn, which is a big, rambling\r\nbuilding. There, in the roof-garden of the Pethick Lawrence's private\r\nflat, we remained all day, busy, under the soft blue of the autumn sky,\r\nwith our work and our preparations for a long absence. At six we walked\r\ndownstairs, dressed for the street. Mrs. Drummond arrived promptly, the\r\nwaiting officers read the warrants, and we all proceeded to Bow Street\r\nin cabs. It was too late for the trial to be held. We asked for bail,\r\nbut the authorities had no mind to allow us to take part in the \"rush\"\r\nwhich we had incited, so we were obliged to spend the night in the\r\npolice station. All night I lay awake, thinking of the scenes which were\r\ngoing on in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, in a courtroom crowded to its utmost capacity, my\r\ndaughter rose to conduct her first case at law. She had earned the right\r\nto an LL.B. after her name, but as women are not permitted to practise\r\nlaw in England, she had never appeared at the bar in any capacity except\r\nthat of defendant. Now she proposed to combine the two roles of\r\ndefendant and lawyer, and conduct the case for the three of us. She\r\nbegan by asking the magistrate not to try the case in that court, but to\r\nsend it for trial before a judge and jury. We had long desired to take\r\nthe Suffragettes' cases before bodies of private citizens, because we\r\nhad every reason to suspect that the police-court officials acted under\r\nthe direct commands of the very persons against whom our agitation was\r\ndirected. Jury trial was denied us; but after the preliminary\r\nexamination was over the magistrate, Mr. Curtis Bennett, allowed a\r\nweek's adjournment for preparation of the case.\r\n\r\nOn October 21st the trial was resumed, with the courtroom as full as\r\nbefore and the press table even more crowded, for it had been widely\r\npublished that we had actually subpoenaed two members of the\r\nGovernment, who had witnessed the scenes on the night of October 13th.\r\nThe first witness to enter the box was Mr. Lloyd-George. Christabel\r\nexamined him at some length as to the meaning and merits of the word\r\nrush, and succeeded in making him very uncomfortable--and the charge\r\nagainst ourselves look very flimsy. She then questioned him about the\r\nspeeches he had heard at Trafalgar Square, and as to whether there had\r\nbeen any suggestion that property be destroyed or personal violence\r\nused. He admitted that the speeches were temperate and the crowds\r\norderly. Then Christabel suddenly asked, \"There were no words used so\r\nlikely to incite to violence as the advice you gave at Swansea, that the\r\nwomen should be ruthlessly flung out of your meeting?\" Mr. Lloyd-George\r\nlooked black, and answered nothing. The magistrate hastened to the\r\nprotection of Mr. Lloyd-George. \"This is quite irrelevant,\" he said.\r\n\"That was a private meeting.\" It was a public meeting, and Christabel\r\nsaid so. \"It was a private meeting _in a sense_,\" insisted the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd-George assumed an air of pompous indignation when Christabel\r\nasked him, \"Have we not received encouragement from you, and if not from\r\nyou from your colleagues, to take action of this kind?\" Mr. Lloyd-George\r\nrolled his eyes upward as he replied, \"I should be very much surprised\r\nto hear that, Miss Pankhurst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not a fact,\" asked Christabel, \"that you yourself have set us an\r\nexample of revolt?\" \"I never incited a crowd to violence,\" exclaimed\r\nthe witness. \"Not in the Welsh graveyard case?\" she asked. \"No!\" he\r\ncried angrily. \"You did not tell them to break down a wall and disinter\r\na body?\" pursued Christabel. He could not deny this but, \"I gave advice\r\nwhich was found by the Court of Appeal to be sound legal advice,\" he\r\nsnapped, and turned his back as far as he could in the narrow\r\nwitness-box.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Gladstone had asked to be allowed to testify early, as he\r\nwas being detained from important public duties. Christabel asked to\r\nquestion one witness before Mr. Gladstone entered the box. The witness\r\nwas Miss Georgiana Brackenbury, who had recently suffered six weeks'\r\nimprisonment for the cause, and had since met and had a talk with Mr.\r\nHorace Smith, the magistrate, who had made to her a most important and\r\ndamaging admission of the government's interference in suffragists'\r\ntrials. Christabel asked her one question. \"Did Mr. Horace Smith tell\r\nyou in sentencing you that he was doing what he had been told to do?\"\r\n\"You must not put that question!\" exclaimed the magistrate. But the\r\nwitness had already answered \"Yes.\" There was an excited stir in the\r\ncourtroom. It had been recorded under oath that a magistrate had\r\nadmitted that Suffragettes were being sentenced not by himself,\r\naccording to the evidence and according to law, but by the Government,\r\nfor no one could possibly doubt where Mr. Horace Smith's orders came\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, plump, bald, and ruddy, in no way resembles his\r\nillustrious father. He entered the witness-box smiling and confident,\r\nbut his complacence vanished when Christabel asked him outright if the\r\nGovernment had not ordered the Commissioner of Police to take this\r\naction against us. Of course the magistrate intervened, and Mr.\r\nGladstone did not answer the question. Christabel tried again. \"Did you\r\ninstruct Mr. Horace Smith to decide against Miss Brackenbury, and to\r\nsend her to prison for six weeks?\" That too was objected to, as were all\r\nquestions on the subject.\r\n\r\nAll through the examination the magistrate constantly intervened to save\r\nthe Cabinet Minister from embarrassment, but Christabel finally\r\nsucceeded in making Mr. Gladstone admit, point by point, that he had\r\nsaid that women could never get the vote because they could not fight\r\nfor it as men had fought.\r\n\r\nA large number of witnesses testified to the orderly nature of the\r\ndemonstration on the 13th, and then Christabel rose to plead. She began\r\nby declaring that these proceedings had been taken, as the legal saying\r\nis, \"in malice and vexation,\" in order to lame a political enemy. She\r\ndeclared that, under the law, the charge which might properly be brought\r\nagainst us was that of illegal assembly, but the Government had not\r\ncharged us with this offence, because the Government desired to keep the\r\ncase in a police court.\r\n\r\n\"The authorities dare not see this case come before a jury,\" she\r\ndeclared, \"because they know perfectly well that if it were heard before\r\na jury of our countrymen we should be acquitted, just as John Burns was\r\nacquitted years ago for taking action far more dangerous to the public\r\npeace than we have taken. We are deprived of trial by jury. We are also\r\ndeprived of the right to appeal against the magistrate's decision. Very\r\ncarefully has this procedure been thought out.\"\r\n\r\nOf the handbill she said: \"We do not deny that we issued this bill; none\r\nof us three has wished to deny responsibility. We did issue the bill; we\r\ndid cause it to be circulated; we did put upon it the words 'Come and\r\nhelp the suffragettes rush the House of Commons.' For these words we do\r\nnot apologise. It is very well known that we took this action in order\r\nto press forward a claim, which, according to the British constitution,\r\nwe are well entitled to make.\"\r\n\r\nIn all that the Suffragettes had done, in all that they might ever do,\r\ndeclared my daughter, they would only be following in the footsteps of\r\nmen now in Parliament. \"Mr. Herbert Gladstone has told us in the speech\r\nI read to him that the victory of argument alone is not enough. As we\r\ncannot hope to win by force of argument alone, it is necessary to\r\novercome by other means the savage resistance of the Government to our\r\nclaim for citizenship. He says, 'Go on, fight as the men did.' And then,\r\nwhen we show our power and get the people to help us, he takes\r\nproceedings against us in a manner that would have been disgraceful even\r\nin the old days of coercion. Then there is Mr. Lloyd-George, who, if any\r\nman has done so, has set us an example. His whole career has been a\r\nseries of revolts. He has said that if we do not get the vote--mark\r\nthese words--we should be justified in adopting the methods the men had\r\nto adopt, namely, pulling down the Hyde Park railings.\" She quoted Lord\r\nMorley as saying of the Indian unrest: \"'We are in India in the presence\r\nof a living movement, and a movement for what? For objects which we\r\nourselves have taught them to think are desirable objects; and unless we\r\ncan somehow reconcile order with satisfaction of those ideals and\r\naspirations, the fault will not be theirs, it will be ours--it will mark\r\nthe breakdown of British statesmanship.'--Apply those words to our\r\ncase,\" she continued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTABEL, MRS. DRUMMOND AND MRS. PANKHURST IN THE DOCK,\r\nFIRST CONSPIRACY TRIAL\r\n\r\n_October, 1908_]\r\n\r\n\"Remember that we are demanding of Liberal statesmen that which is for\r\nus the greatest boon and the most essential right--and if the present\r\nGovernment cannot reconcile order with our demand for the vote without\r\ndelay, it will mark the breakdown of their statesmanship. Yes, their\r\nstatesmanship has broken down already. They are disgraced. It is only in\r\nthis court that they have the smallest hope of being supported.\"\r\n\r\nMy daughter had spoken with passion and fervour, and her righteous\r\nindignation had moved her to words that caused the magistrate's face to\r\nturn an angry crimson. When I rose to address the Court I began by\r\nassuming an appearance of calmness which I did not altogether feel. I\r\nendorsed all that Christabel had said of the unfairness of our trial and\r\nthe malice of the Government; I protested against the trial of political\r\noffenders in a common police court, and I said that we were not women\r\nwho would come into the court as ordinary law-breakers. I described Mrs.\r\nDrummond's worthy career as a wife, a mother, and a self-sustaining\r\nbusiness woman. I said, \"Before you decide what is to be done with us,\r\nI should like you to hear from me a statement of what has brought me\r\ninto the dock this morning.\" And then I told of my life and experiences,\r\nmany of which I have related in these pages of what I had seen and known\r\nas a Poor Law Guardian and a registrar of births and deaths; of how I\r\nhad learned the burning necessity of changing the status of women, of\r\naltering the laws under which they and their children live, and of the\r\nessential justice of making women self-governing citizens.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen,\" I said, \"that men are encouraged by law to take advantage\r\nof the helplessness of women. Many women have thought as I have, and for\r\nmany, many years have tried, by that influence of which we have been so\r\noften reminded, to alter these laws, but we find that influence counts\r\nfor nothing. When we went to the House of Commons we used to be told,\r\nwhen we were persistent, that members of Parliament were not responsible\r\nto women, they were responsible only to voters, and that their time was\r\ntoo fully occupied to reform those laws, although they agreed that they\r\nneeded reforming.\r\n\r\n\"We women have presented larger petitions in support of our\r\nenfranchisement than were ever presented for any other reform; we have\r\nsucceeded in holding greater public meetings than men have ever held for\r\nany reform, in spite of the difficulty which women have in throwing off\r\ntheir natural diffidence, that desire to escape publicity which we have\r\ninherited from generations of our foremothers. We have broken through\r\nthat. We have faced hostile mobs at street corners, because we were told\r\nthat we could not have that representation for our taxes that men have\r\nwon unless we converted the whole of the country to our side. Because we\r\nhave done this, we have been misrepresented, we have been ridiculed, we\r\nhave had contempt poured upon us, and the ignorant mob have been incited\r\nto offer us violence, which we have faced unarmed and unprotected by the\r\nsafeguards which Cabinet Ministers enjoy. We have been driven to do\r\nthis; we are determined to go on with this agitation because we feel in\r\nhonour bound. Just as it was the duty of your forefathers, it is our\r\nduty to make the world a better place for women than it is to-day.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, I want to call attention to the self-restraint which was shown\r\nby our followers on the night of the 13th, after we had been arrested.\r\nOur rule has always been to be patient, exercise self-restraint, show\r\nour so-called superiors that we are not hysterical; to use no violence,\r\nbut rather to offer ourselves to the violence of others.\r\n\r\n\"That is all I have to say to you, sir. We are here, not because we are\r\nlaw-breakers; we are here in our efforts to become law-makers.\"\r\n\r\nThe burly policemen, the reporters, and most of the spectators were in\r\ntears as I finished. But the magistrate, who had listened part of the\r\ntime with his hand concealing his face, still held that we were properly\r\ncharged in a common police court as inciters to riot. Since we refused\r\nto be bound over to keep the peace, he sentenced Mrs. Drummond and\r\nmyself to three months' imprisonment, and Christabel to ten weeks'\r\nimprisonment. It was destined to be a kind of imprisonment the\r\nauthorities had never yet been called upon to deal with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first act on reaching Holloway was to demand that the Governor be\r\nsent for. When he came I told him that the Suffragettes had resolved\r\nthat they would no longer submit to being treated as ordinary\r\nlaw-breakers. In the course of our trial two Cabinet Ministers had\r\nadmitted that we were political offenders, and therefore we should\r\nhenceforth refuse to be searched or to undress in the presence of the\r\nwardresses. For myself I claimed the right, and I hoped the others would\r\ndo likewise, to speak to my friends during exercise, or whenever I came\r\nin contact with them. The Governor, after reflection, yielded to the\r\nfirst two demands, but said that he would have to consult the Home\r\nOffice before permitting us to break the rule of silence. We were\r\naccordingly allowed to change our clothing privately, and, as a further\r\nconcession, were placed in adjoining cells. This was little advantage to\r\nme, however, since within a few days I was removed to a hospital cell,\r\nsuffering from the illness which prison life always inflicts on me. Here\r\nthe Governor visited me with the unwelcome news that the Home Secretary\r\nhad refused to allow me the privilege of speech with my fellow\r\nprisoners. I asked him if I might, when I was strong enough to walk,\r\ntake exercise with my friends. To this he assented, and I soon had the\r\njoy of seeing my daughter and the other brave comrades, and walking\r\nwith them in the dismal courtyard of the prison. Single file we walked,\r\nat a distance of three or four feet from one another, back and forth\r\nunder the stony eyes of the wardresses. The rough flags of the pavement\r\nhurt our feet, shod in heavy, shapeless prison boots. The autumn days\r\nwere cold and cheerless, and we shivered violently under our scanty\r\ncloaks. But of all our hardships the ceaseless silence of our lives was\r\nworst.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second week I decided I would no longer endure it.\r\nThat afternoon at exercise I suddenly called my daughter by name and\r\nbade her stand still until I came up to her. Of course she stopped, and\r\nwhen I reached her side we linked arms and began to talk in low tones. A\r\nwardress ran up to us, saying: \"I shall listen to everything you say.\" I\r\nreplied: \"You are welcome to do that, but I shall insist on my right to\r\nspeak to my daughter.\" Another wardress had hastily left the yard, and\r\nnow she returned with a large number of wardresses. They seized me and\r\nquickly removed me to my cell, while the other suffrage prisoners\r\ncheered my action at the top of their voices. For their \"mutiny\" they\r\ngot three days' solitary confinement, and I, for mine, a much more\r\nsevere punishment. Unrepentant, I told the Governor that, in spite of\r\nany punishment he might impose on me, I would never again submit to the\r\nsilence rule. To forbid a mother to speak to her daughter was infamous.\r\nFor this I was characterised as a \"dangerous criminal\" and was sent into\r\nsolitary confinement, without exercise or chapel, while a wardress was\r\nstationed constantly at my cell door to see that I communicated with no\r\none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. PANKHURST AND MISS CHRISTABEL PANKHURST IN PRISON\r\nDRESS]\r\n\r\nIt was two weeks before I saw any of my friends again, and meantime the\r\nhealth of Mrs. Drummond had been so seriously impaired that she was\r\nreleased for hospital treatment. My daughter also, I learned, was ill,\r\nand in desperation I made application to the Board of Visiting\r\nMagistrates to be allowed to see her. After a long conference, during\r\nwhich I was made to wait outside in the corridor, the magistrates\r\nreturned a refusal, saying that I might renew my application in a month.\r\nThe answer then, they said, would depend on my conduct. A month! My girl\r\nmight be dead by that time. My anxiety sent me to bed ill again, but,\r\nalthough I did not know it, relief was already on its way. I had told\r\nthe visiting magistrates that I would wait until public opinion got\r\nwithin those walls, and this happened sooner than I had dared to hope.\r\nMrs. Drummond, as soon as she was able to appear in public, and the\r\nother suffrage prisoners, as they were released, spread broadcast the\r\nstory of our mutiny, and of a subsequent one led by Miss Wallace Dunlop,\r\nwhich sent a large number of women into solitary confinement. The\r\nSuffragettes marched by thousands to Holloway, thronging the approaches\r\nto the prison street. Round and round the prison they marched, singing\r\nthe Women's Marseillaise and cheering. Faintly the sound came to our\r\nears, infinitely lightening our burden of pain and loneliness. The\r\nfollowing week they came again, so we afterwards learned, but this time\r\nthe police turned them back long before they reached the confines of\r\nthe prison.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations, together with a volley of questions asked in the\r\nHouse of Commons, told at last. Orders came from the Home Office that I\r\nwas to see my daughter, and that we were to be allowed to exercise and\r\nto talk together for one hour each day. In addition, we were to be\r\npermitted the rare privilege of reading a daily newspaper. Then, on\r\nDecember 8th, the day of Christabel's release, orders came that I, too,\r\nshould be discharged, two weeks before the expiration of my sentence.\r\n\r\nAt the welcome breakfast given us, as released prisoners, at Lincoln's\r\nInn Hotel, I told our members that henceforth we should all insist on\r\nrefusing to abide by ordinary prison rules. We did not propose to break\r\nlaws and then shirk punishment. We simply meant to assert our right to\r\nbe recognised as political prisoners. We reached this point after due\r\nreflection. We first set ourselves not to complain of prison, not to say\r\nanything about it, to avoid it, to keep away from all side issues, to\r\nkeep along the straight path of political reform, to get the vote;\r\nbecause we knew that when we had won it we could reform prisons and a\r\ngreat many other abuses as well. But now that we had had in the witness\r\nbox the admission of Cabinet Ministers that we are political offenders,\r\nwe should in future demand the treatment given to men political\r\noffenders in all civilised countries. \"If nations,\" I said, \"are still\r\nso governed that they make political offenders, then Great Britain is\r\ngoing to treat her political offenders as well as political offenders\r\nare treated by other nations. If it were the custom to treat political\r\noffenders as ordinary offenders against the well-being of society are\r\ntreated, we should not have complained if we were treated like that; but\r\nit is not the international custom to do it, and so, for the dignity of\r\nthe women of the country, and for the sake of the consciences of the men\r\nof the country, and for the sake of our nation amongst the nations of\r\nthe earth, we are not going to allow the Liberal government to treat us\r\nlike ordinary law-breakers in future.\"\r\n\r\nI said the same thing that night in a great meeting held in Queen's Hall\r\nto welcome the released prisoners, and, although we all knew that our\r\ndetermination involved a bitter struggle, our women endorsed it without\r\na moment's hesitation. Had they been able to look forward to the events\r\nwhich were even then overshadowing us, could they have foreseen the new\r\nforms of suffering and danger that lay in waiting, I am certain that\r\nthey would still have done the same thing, for our experiences had\r\ntaught us to dispense with fear. Whatever of timidity, of shrinking from\r\npain or hardship any of us had originally possessed, it had all\r\nvanished. There were no terrors that we were not now ready to face.\r\n\r\nThe year 1909 marks an important point in our struggle, partly because\r\nof this decision of ours, never again to submit to be classed with\r\ncriminals; and partly because in this year we forced the Liberal\r\nGovernment to go on record, publicly, in regard to the oldest of\r\npopular rights, the right of petition. We had long contemplated this\r\nstep, and now the time seemed ripe for taking it.\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of 1908 Mr. Asquith, speaking on the policy to be\r\ncarried out in 1909, commented on the various deputations he was obliged\r\nat that time to receive. They called on him, he said, \"from all quarters\r\nand in all causes, on an average of something like two hours on three\r\ndays in every week.\" The deputations all asked for different things,\r\nand, although all of the things could not possibly be included in the\r\nKing's speech, Mr. Asquith was inclined to agree that many of them ought\r\nto be included. This declaration from the Prime Minister that he was\r\nconstantly receiving deputations of men, and listening favourably to\r\ntheir suggestions of what policies to pursue, aroused in the\r\nSuffragettes feelings of deep indignation. This in part they expressed\r\non January 25th, when the first meeting of the Cabinet Council took\r\nplace. A small deputation from the W. S. P. U. proceeded to Downing\r\nStreet to claim the right to be heard, as men were heard. For knocking\r\nat the door of the official residence four of the women, including my\r\nsister, Mrs. Clark, were arrested and sent to prison for one month.\r\n\r\nA month later the seventh of our Women's Parliaments was called against\r\nthis and against the fact that no mention of women had been included in\r\nthe King's speech. Led by Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, Lady Constance Lytton\r\nand Miss Daisy Solomon, a deputation of women endeavoured to carry the\r\nresolution to the House of Commons. They were promptly arrested and,\r\nnext day, were sent to prison on sentences of from one to two months.\r\nThe time was rapidly approaching when the legality of these arrests\r\nwould have to be tested. In June of the year 1909 the test was made.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that we had endeavoured to force the authorities\r\nto make good their threat to charge us under the obsolete Charles II\r\n\"Tumultuous Petitions Act,\" which prescribes severe penalties for\r\npersons proceeding to Parliament in groups of more than twelve for the\r\npurpose of presenting petitions. It had been stated that if we were\r\ncharged under that act our case would be given a hearing before a judge\r\nand jury instead of a police magistrate. Since this was exactly what we\r\ndesired to have happen we had sent deputation after deputation of more\r\nthan twelve persons, but always they were tried in police courts, and\r\nwere sent to prison often for periods as long as that prescribed in the\r\nCharles II Act. Now we determined to do something still more ambitious;\r\nwe resolved to test, not the Charles II Act, but the constitutional\r\nright of the subject to petition the Prime Minister as the seat of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe right of petition, which has existed in England since the earliest\r\nknown period, was written into the Bill of Rights which became law in\r\n1689 on the accession of William and Mary. It was, in fact, one of the\r\nconditions attaching to the accession of the joint monarchs. According\r\nto the Bill of Rights, \"It is the right of subjects to petition the King\r\nand all commitments, and prosecutions for such petitionings are\r\nillegal.\" The power of the King having passed almost completely into\r\nthe hands of Parliament, the Prime Minister now stands where the King's\r\nmajesty stood in former times. Clearly, then, the right of the subject\r\nto petition the Prime Minister cannot be legally denied. Thus were we\r\nadvised, and in order to keep within the strict letter of the law, we\r\naccepted the limitations of the right of petition laid down in the\r\nCharles II Act, and decided that our petition should be carried to the\r\nHouse of Commons by small groups of women.\r\n\r\nAgain I called together, on the evening of June 29th, a Parliament of\r\nwomen. Previously I had written to Mr. Asquith stating that a deputation\r\nof women would wait on him at the House of Commons at eight o'clock in\r\nthe evening. I wrote him further that we were not to be refused, as we\r\ninsisted upon our constitutional right to be received. To my note the\r\nPrime Minister returned a formal note declining to receive us.\r\nNevertheless we continued our preparations, because we knew that the\r\nPrime Minister would continue to decline, but that in the end he would\r\nbe forced to receive us.\r\n\r\nAn incident which occurred a week before the date of the deputation was\r\ndestined to have important consequences. Miss Wallace Dunlop went to St.\r\nStephen's Hall in the House of Commons, and marked with printer's ink on\r\nthe stone work of the Hall an extract from the Bill of Rights. The first\r\ntime she made the attempt she was interrupted by a policeman, but two\r\ndays later she succeeded in stamping on the ancient walls the reminder\r\nto Parliament that women as well as men possess constitutional rights,\r\nand that they were proposing to exercise those rights. She was arrested\r\nand sentenced to prison for one month, in the third division. The option\r\nof a heavy fine was given her, which of course she refused. Miss Wallace\r\nDunlop's prison term began on June 22d. Perhaps her deed had something\r\nto do with the unusual interest taken in the approaching deputation, an\r\ninterest which was shown not only by the public but by many members of\r\nParliament. In the House of Commons a strong feeling that the women\r\nought this time to be received manifested itself in many questions put\r\nto the Government. One member even asked leave to move the adjournment\r\nof the House on a matter of urgent public importance, namely the danger\r\nto the public peace, owing to the refusal of the Prime Minister to\r\nreceive the deputation. This was denied, however, and the Government\r\nmendaciously disclaimed all responsibility for what action the police\r\nmight take toward the deputation. The Home Secretary, Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwhen asked by Mr. Kier Hardie to give instructions that the deputation,\r\nif orderly, should be admitted to St. Stephen's, replied: \"I cannot say\r\nwhat action the police ought to take in the matter.\" Our Women's\r\nParliament met at half past seven on the evening of June 29th, and the\r\npetition to the Prime Minister was read and adopted. Then our deputation\r\nset forth. Accompanying me as leader were two highly respectable women\r\nof advanced years, Mrs. Saul Solomon, whose husband had been Prime\r\nMinister at the Cape, and Miss Neligan, one of the foremost of the\r\npioneer educators of England. We three and five other women were\r\npreceded by Miss Elsie Howey, who, riding fast, went on horse-back to\r\nannounce our coming to the enormous crowds that filled the streets. She,\r\nwe afterward learned, progressed as far as the approaches to the House\r\nof Commons before being turned back by the police. As for the\r\ndeputation, it pressed on through the crowd as far as St. Margaret's\r\nChurch, Westminster, where we found a long line of police blocking the\r\nroad. We paused for a moment, gathering strength for the ordeal of\r\ntrying to push through the lines, when an unexpected thing happened. An\r\norder was given from some one, and instantly the police lines parted,\r\nleaving a clear space through which we walked towards the House. We were\r\nescorted on our way by Inspector Wells, and as we passed the crowd broke\r\ninto vociferous cheering, firmly believing that we were after all to be\r\nreceived. As for myself I did little speculating as to what was about to\r\nhappen. I simply led my deputation on as far as the entrance to St.\r\nStephen's Hall. There we encountered another strong force of police\r\ncommanded by our old acquaintance, Inspector Scantlebury, who stepped\r\nforward and handed me a letter. I opened it and read in aloud to the\r\nwomen. \"The Prime Minister, for the reasons which he has already given\r\nin a written reply to their request, regrets that he is unable to\r\nreceive the proposed deputation.\"\r\n\r\nI dropped the note to the ground and said: \"I stand upon my rights, as a\r\nsubject of the King, to petition the Prime Minister, and I am firmly\r\nresolved to stand here until I am received.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSPECTOR WELLS CONDUCTING MRS. PANKHURST TO THE HOUSE OF\r\nCOMMONS\r\n\r\n_June, 1908_]\r\n\r\nInspector Scantlebury turned away and walked rapidly towards the door\r\nof the Strangers' Entrance. I turned to Inspector Jarvis, who remained,\r\nto several members of Parliament and some newspaper men who stood\r\nlooking on, and begged them to take my message to the Prime Minister,\r\nbut no one responded, and the Inspector, seizing my arm, began to push\r\nme away. I now knew that the deputation would not be received and that\r\nthe old miserable business of refusing to leave, of being forced\r\nbackward, and returning again and again until arrested, would have to be\r\nre-enacted. I had to take into account that I was accompanied by two\r\nfragile old ladies, who, brave as they were to be there at all, could\r\nnot possibly endure what I knew must follow. I quickly decided that I\r\nshould have to force an immediate arrest, so I committed an act of\r\ntechnical assault on the person of Inspector Jarvis, striking him very\r\nlightly on the cheek. He said instantly, \"I understand why you did\r\nthat,\" and I supposed then that we would instantly be taken. But the\r\nother police apparently did not grasp the situation, for they began\r\npushing and jostling our women. I said to the inspector: \"Shall I have\r\nto do it again?\" and he said \"Yes.\" So I struck him lightly a second\r\ntime, and then he ordered the police to make the arrests.\r\n\r\nThe matter did not end with the arrest of our deputation of eight women.\r\nIn recurring deputations of twelve the Suffragettes again and again\r\npressed forward in vain endeavour to reach the House of Commons. In\r\nspite of the fact that the crowds were friendly and did everything they\r\ncould to aid the women, their deputations were broken up by the police\r\nand many of the women arrested. By nine o'clock Parliament Square was\r\nempty, an enormous force of mounted police having beaten the people back\r\ninto Victoria Street and across Westminster Bridge. For a short time all\r\nlooked tranquil, but soon little groups of women, seven or eight at a\r\ntime, kept appearing mysteriously and making spirited dashes toward the\r\nHouse. This extraordinary procedure greatly exasperated the police, who\r\ncould not unravel the mystery of where the women came from. As a matter\r\nof bygone history the explanation is that the W. S. P. U. had hired\r\nthirty offices in the neighborhood, in the shelter of which the women\r\nwaited until it was time for them to sally forth. It was a striking\r\ndemonstration of the ingenuity of women opposing the physical force of\r\nmen, but it served still another purpose. It diverted the attention of\r\nthe police from another demonstration which was going on. Other\r\nSuffragettes had gone to the official residence of the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, to the Home Office, the Treasury and Privy Council Offices,\r\nand had registered their contempt for the Government's refusal to\r\nreceive the deputation by the time-honoured method of breaking a window\r\nin each place.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and eight women were arrested that night, but instead of\r\nsubmitting to arrests and trial, the Women's Social and Political Union\r\nannounced that they were prepared to prove that the Government and not\r\nthe women had broken the law in refusing to receive the petition. My\r\ncase, coupled with that of the Hon. Mrs. Haverfield, was selected as a\r\ntest case for all the others, and Lord Robert Cecil was retained for the\r\ndefence. Mr. Muskett, who conducted the case for the prosecution, tried\r\nto prove that our women had not gone to the House of Commons to present\r\na petition, but this was easily demonstrated to be an unwarranted claim.\r\nThe speeches of the leader, the official articles published in our\r\nnewspaper, _Votes for Women_, and the letters sent to Mr. Asquith, not\r\nto speak of the indisputable facts that every member of the deputation\r\ncarried a copy of the petition in her hand, furnished evidence enough of\r\nthe nature of our errand. The whole case of the subject's right of\r\npetition was then brought forward for discussion. Mr. Muskett spoke\r\nfirst, then our council, Mr. Henle, then Lord Robert Cecil. Last of all\r\nI spoke, describing the events of June 29th. I told the magistrate that\r\nshould he decide that we and not the Government had been guilty of an\r\ninfraction of the law, we should refuse to be bound over, but should all\r\nchoose to go to prison. In that case we should not submit to being\r\ntreated like criminals. \"There are one hundred and eight of us here\r\nto-day,\" I said, pointing to the benches where my fellow-prisoners sat,\r\n\"and just as we have thought it is our duty to defy the police in the\r\nstreet, so when we get into prison, as we are political prisoners, we\r\nshall do our best to bring back into the twentieth century the treatment\r\nof political prisoners which was thought right in the case of William\r\nCobbett, and other political offenders of his time.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, Sir Albert de Rutzen, an elderly, amiable man, rather\r\nbewildered by this unprecedented situation, then gave his decision. He\r\nagreed with Mr. Henle and Lord Robert Cecil that the right of petition\r\nwas clearly guaranteed to every subject, but he thought that when the\r\nwomen were refused permission to enter the House of Commons, and when\r\nMr. Asquith had said that he would not receive them, the women acted\r\nwrongly to persist in their demands. He should, therefore, fine them\r\nfive pounds each, or sentence them to prison for one month in the second\r\ndivision. The sentence would be suspended for the present until learned\r\ncounsel could obtain a decision from a higher court on the legal point\r\nof the right of petition.\r\n\r\nI then put in a claim for all the prisoners, and asked that all their\r\ncases might be held over until the test case was decided, and this was\r\nagreed to, except in regard to fourteen women charged with\r\nwindow-breaking. They were tried separately and sent to prison on\r\nsentences varying from six weeks to two months. Of them later.\r\n\r\nThe appeal against Sir Albert de Rutzen's decision was tried in a\r\nDivisional Court early in December of that year. Lord Robert Cecil again\r\nappeared for the defence, and in a masterly piece of argumentation,\r\ncontended that in England there was and always had been the right of\r\npetition, and that the right had always been considered a necessary\r\ncondition of a free country and a civilised Government. The right of\r\npetition, he pointed out, had three characteristics: In the first place,\r\nit was the right to petition the actual repositories of power; in the\r\nsecond place, it was the right to petition in person; and in the third\r\nplace, the right must be exercised reasonably. A long list of historical\r\nprecedents were offered in support of the right to petition in person,\r\nbut Lord Robert argued that even if these did not exist, the right was\r\nadmitted in the Charles II \"Tumultuous Petitions Act,\" which provides\r\n\"That no person or persons whatsoever shall repair to His Majesty or\r\nboth or either Houses of Parliament upon pretence of presenting or\r\ndelivering any petition, complaint, remonstrance, or declaration or\r\nother address, accompanied with excessive number of people ...\" etc. The\r\nBill of Rights had specially confirmed the right of petition in so far\r\nas the King personally was concerned. \"The women,\" pursued Lord Robert,\r\n\"had gone to Parliament Square on June 29th in the exercise of a plain\r\nconstitutional right, and that in going there with a petition they had\r\nacted according to the only constitutional method they possessed, being\r\nvoteless, for the redress of their grievances.\"\r\n\r\nIf then it were true, as contended, the subject not only possessed the\r\nright to petition, but to petition in person, the only point to be\r\nconsidered was whether the right had been exercised reasonably. If\r\npersons desired to interview the Prime Minister, it was surely\r\nreasonable to go to the House of Commons, and to present themselves at\r\nthe Strangers' Entrance. Mrs. Pankhurst, Mrs. Haverfield and the others\r\nhad, as the evidence showed, proceeded along the public highway and had\r\nbeen escorted to the door of the House of Commons by an officer of the\r\npolice, and could not therefore, up to that point, have been acting in\r\nan unlawful manner. The police had kept clear a large open space\r\nopposite the House of Commons, the crowd being kept at a certain\r\ndistance away. Within the open space there were only persons having\r\nbusiness in the House of Commons, members of the police force and the\r\neight women who formed the deputation. It could not possibly be\r\ncontended that these eight women had caused an obstruction. It was true\r\nthat a police officer told them that the Prime Minister was not in the\r\nHouse of Commons, but when one desired an interview with a Member of\r\nParliament one did not make his request of a casual policeman in the\r\nstreet. Moreover, the police did not possess any authority to stop\r\nanyone from going into the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe letter given the women, in which the Prime Minister said that he\r\ncould not or would not see them, had been cited. Now, had the Prime\r\nMinister, in his letter, said that he could not or would not see the\r\nwomen at that time, that the time was not convenient; but that he would\r\nat some future time, at a more convenient time, receive them, that would\r\nhave been a sufficient answer. The women would not have been justified\r\nin refusing to accept such an answer, because the right to petition must\r\nbe exercised reasonably. But the letter contained an unqualified\r\nrefusal, and that, if we allow the right of petition to exist, was no\r\nanswer at all. Last of all Lord Robert argued that if there is a right\r\nto petition a Member of Parliament, then it must be incumbent on the\r\npart of a Member of Parliament to receive the petition, and that no one\r\nhas a right to interfere with the petitioner. If the eight women were\r\nlegally justified in presenting their petition, then they were also\r\njustified in refusing to obey the orders of the police to leave the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn an address full of bias, and revealing plainly that he had no\r\naccurate knowledge of any of the events that had led up to the case in\r\nhand, the Lord Chief Justice delivered judgment. He said that he\r\nentirely agreed with Lord Robert Cecil as to the right to present a\r\npetition to the Prime Minister, either as Prime Minister or as a Member\r\nof Parliament; and he agreed also that petitions to the King should be\r\npresented to the Prime Minister. But the claim of the women, he said,\r\nwas not merely to present a petition, but to be received in a\r\ndeputation. He did not think it likely that Mr. Asquith would have\r\nrefused to receive a petition from the women, but his refusal to receive\r\nthe deputation was not unnatural, \"in consequence of what we know did\r\nhappen on previous occasions.\"[1]\r\n\r\nReferring to the Metropolitan Police Act of 1839, which provides that it\r\nshall be lawful for the Commissioner of Police to make regulations and\r\nto give instructions to the constable for keeping order, and for\r\npreventing any obstruction of thoroughfares in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the House of Commons, and the Sessional Order\r\nempowering the police to keep clear the approaches to the House of\r\nCommons, the Lord Chief Justice decided that I and the other women were\r\nguilty of an infraction of the law when we insisted on a right to enter\r\nthe House of Commons. The Lord Chief Justice therefore ruled that our\r\nconviction in the lower court had been proper, and our appeal was\r\ndismissed with costs.\r\n\r\nThus was destroyed in England the ancient constitutional right of\r\npetition, secured to the people by the Bill of Rights, and cherished by\r\nuncounted generations of Englishmen. I say the right was destroyed, for\r\nof how much value is a petition which cannot be presented in person? The\r\ndecision of the high court was appalling to the members of the\r\nW. S. P. U., as it closed the last approach, by constitutional means, to\r\nour enfranchisement. Far from discouraging or disheartening us, it\r\nsimply spurred us on to new and more aggressive forms of militancy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Asquith had never, since becoming Prime Minister, received a\r\ndeputation of women, nor had he ever received a deputation of the W. S.\r\nP. U. So it was absurd of the Lord Chief Justice to speak of \"what did\r\nhappen, on previous occasions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the time of the arrest in June and the handing down of the\r\nabsurd decision of the Lord Chief Justice that although we, as subjects,\r\npossessed the right of petition, yet we had committed an offence in\r\nexercising that right, nearly six months had passed. In that interval\r\ncertain grave developments had lifted the militant movement onto a new\r\nand more heroic plane. It will be remembered that a week before our\r\ndeputation to test the Charles II Act, Miss Wallace Dunlop had been sent\r\nto prison for one month for stamping an extract from the Bill of Rights\r\non the stone walls of St. Stephen's Hall. On arriving at Holloway on\r\nFriday evening, July 2nd, she sent for the Governor and demanded of him\r\nthat she be treated as a political offender. The Governor replied that\r\nhe had no power to alter the sentence of the magistrate, whereupon Miss\r\nWallace Dunlop informed him that it was the unalterable resolution of\r\nthe Suffragettes never again to submit to the prison treatment given to\r\nordinary offenders against the law. Therefore she should, if placed in\r\nthe second division as a common criminal, refuse to touch food until the\r\nGovernment yielded her point. It is hardly likely that the Government or\r\nthe prison authorities realised the seriousness of Miss Wallace Dunlop's\r\naction, or the heroic mould of the Suffragettes' character. At all\r\nevents the Home Secretary paid no attention to the letter sent him by\r\nthe prisoner, in which she explained simply but clearly her motives for\r\nher desperate act, and the prison authorities did nothing except seek\r\nmeans of breaking down her resistance. The ordinary prison diet was\r\nreplaced by the most tempting food, and this instead of being brought to\r\nher cell at intervals, was kept there night and day, but always\r\nuntouched. Several times daily the doctor came to feel her pulse and\r\nobserve her growing weakness. The doctor, as well as the Governor and\r\nthe wardresses argued, coaxed and threatened, but without effect. The\r\nweek passed without any sign of surrender on the part of the prisoner.\r\nOn Friday the doctor reported that she was rapidly reaching a point at\r\nwhich death might at any time supervene. Hurried conferences were\r\ncarried on between the prison and the Home Office, and that evening,\r\nJune 8th, Miss Wallace Dunlop was sent home, having served one-fourth of\r\nher sentence, and having ignored completely all the terms of her\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn the day of her release the fourteen women who had been convicted of\r\nwindow breaking received their sentences, and learning of Miss Wallace\r\nDunlop's act, they, as they were being taken to Holloway in the prison\r\nvan, held a consultation and agreed to follow her example. Arrived at\r\nHolloway they at once informed the officials that they would not give up\r\nany of their belongings, neither would they put on prison clothing,\r\nperform prison labour, eat prison food or keep the rule of silence.\r\n\r\nThe Governor agreed for the moment to allow them to retain their\r\nproperty and to wear their own clothing, but he told them that they had\r\ncommitted an act of mutiny and that he would have to so charge them at\r\nthe next visit of the magistrates. The women then addressed petitions to\r\nthe Home Secretary, demanding that they be given the prison treatment\r\nuniversally allowed political offenders. They decided to postpone the\r\nhunger strike until the Home Secretary had had time to reply. Meanwhile,\r\nafter a vain appeal for more fresh air, for the weather was stiflingly\r\nhot, the women committed one more act of mutiny, they broke the windows\r\nof their cells.\r\n\r\nWe learned this from the prisoners themselves. Several days after they\r\nhad gone to prison, my daughter Christabel and Mrs. Tuke, filled with\r\nanxiety for their fate, gained admission to an upper story room of a\r\nhouse overlooking the prison. Calling at the top of their voices and\r\nwaving a flag of the Union, they succeeded in attracting the prisoners'\r\nattention. The women thrust their arms through the broken panes, waving\r\nhandkerchiefs, Votes for Women badges, anything they could get hold of,\r\nand in a few shouted words told their tale. That same day the visiting\r\nmagistrates arrived, and the mutineers were sentenced to terms of seven\r\nto ten days of solitary confinement in the punishment cells. In these\r\nfrightful cells, dark, unclean, dripping with moisture, the prisoners\r\nresolutely hunger struck. At the end of five days one of the women was\r\nreduced to such a condition that the Home Secretary ordered her\r\nreleased. The next day several more were released, and before the end\r\nof the week the last of the fourteen had gained their liberty.\r\n\r\nThe affair excited the greatest sympathy all over England, sympathy\r\nwhich Mr. Gladstone tried to divert by charging two of the prisoners\r\nwith kicking and biting the wardresses. In spite of their vigorous\r\ndenials these two women were sentenced, on these charges, one to ten\r\ndays and the other to a month in prison. Although still very weak from\r\nthe previous hunger strike, they at once entered upon a second hunger\r\nstrike, and in three days had to be released.\r\n\r\nAfter this each succeeding batch of Suffragette prisoners, unless\r\notherwise directed, followed the example of these heroic rebels. The\r\nprison officials, seeing their authority vanish, were panic stricken.\r\nHolloway and other women's prisons throughout the Kingdom became perfect\r\ndens of violence and brutality. Hear the account given by Lucy Burns of\r\nher experience:\r\n\r\n\"We remained quite still when ordered to undress, and when they told us\r\nto proceed to our cells we linked arms and stood with our backs to the\r\nwall. The Governor blew his whistle and a great crowd of wardresses\r\nappeared, falling upon us, forcing us apart and dragging us towards the\r\ncells. I think I had twelve wardresses for my share, and among them they\r\nmanaged to trip me so that I fell helplessly to the floor. One of the\r\nwardresses grasped me by my hair, wound the long braid around her wrist\r\nand literally dragged me along the ground. In the cell they fairly\r\nripped the clothing from my back, forcing on me one coarse cotton\r\ngarment and throwing others on the bed for me to put on myself. Left\r\nalone exhausted by the dreadful experience I lay for a time gasping and\r\nshivering on the floor. By and by a wardress came to the door and threw\r\nme a blanket. This I wrapped around me, for I was chilled to the bone by\r\nthis time. The single cotton garment and the rough blanket were all the\r\nclothes I wore during my stay in prison. Most of the prisoners refused\r\neverything but the blanket. According to agreement we all broke our\r\nwindows and were immediately dragged off to the punishment cells. There\r\nwe hunger struck, and after enduring great misery for nearly a week, we\r\nwere one by one released.\"\r\n\r\nHow simply they tell it. \"After enduring great misery--\" But no one who\r\nhas not gone through the awful experience of the hunger strike can have\r\nany idea of how great that misery is. In an ordinary cell it is great\r\nenough. In the unspeakable squalor of the punishment cells it is worse.\r\nThe actual hunger pangs last only about twenty-four hours with most\r\nprisoners. I generally suffer most on the second day. After that there\r\nis no very desperate craving for food. Weakness and mental depression\r\ntake its place. Great disturbances of digestion divert the desire for\r\nfood to a longing for relief from pain. Often there is intense headache,\r\nwith fits of dizziness, or slight delirium. Complete exhaustion and a\r\nfeeling of isolation from earth mark the final stages of the ordeal.\r\nRecovery is often protracted, and entire recovery of normal health is\r\nsometimes discouragingly slow.\r\n\r\nThe first hunger strike occurred in early July. In the two months that\r\nfollowed scores of women adopted the same form of protest against a\r\nGovernment who would not recognise the political character of their\r\noffences. In some cases the hunger strikers were treated with unexampled\r\ncruelty. Delicate women were sentenced, not only to solitary\r\nconfinement, but to wear handcuffs for twenty-four hours at a stretch.\r\nOne woman on refusing prison clothes was put into a straightwaistcoat.\r\n\r\nThe irony of all this appears the greater when it is considered that, at\r\nthis precise time, the leaders of the Liberal Party in the House of\r\nCommons were in the midst of their first campaign against the veto power\r\nof the Lords.\r\n\r\nOn September 17th a great meeting was held in Birmingham, on which\r\noccasion Mr. Asquith was to throw down his challenge to the Lords, and\r\nto announce that their veto was to be abolished, leaving the people's\r\nwill paramount in England. Of course the Suffragettes seized this\r\nopportunity for a demonstration. This course was perfectly logical.\r\nDenied the right of petition, shut out now from every Cabinet Minister's\r\nmeeting, the women were forced to take whatever means that remained to\r\nurge their cause upon the Government. Mrs. Mary Leigh and a group of\r\nBirmingham members addressed a warning to the public not to attend Mr.\r\nAsquith's meeting as disturbances were likely to happen. From the time\r\nthat the Prime Minister and his Cabinet left the House of Commons until\r\nthe train drew in to the station at Birmingham they were completely\r\nsurrounded with detectives and policemen. The precautions taken to\r\nguard Mr. Asquith have never been equalled except in the case of the\r\nTsar during outbreaks of revolution in Russia. From the station he was\r\ntaken by an underground passage a quarter of a mile in length to his\r\nhotel, where he dined in solitary state, after having been carried\r\nupstairs in a luggage lift. Escorted to the Bingley Hall by a strong\r\nguard of mounted police, he was so fearful of encountering the\r\nSuffragettes that he entered by a side door. The hall was guarded as for\r\na siege. Over the glass roof a thick tarpaulin had been stretched. Tall\r\nladders were placed on either side of the building, and firemen's hose\r\nwere laid in readiness--not to extinguish fires, but to play upon the\r\nSuffragettes should they appear at an inaccessible spot on the roof. The\r\nstreets on every hand were barricaded, and police, in regiments, were\r\ndrawn up to defend the barricades against the onslaughts of the women.\r\nNobody was allowed to pass the barricades without showing his entrance\r\ntickets to long files of police, and then the ticket holders were\r\nsqueezed through the narrow doors one by one.\r\n\r\nTheir precautions were in vain, for the determined Suffragettes found\r\nmore than one way in which to turn Mr. Asquith's triumph into a fiasco.\r\nAlthough no women gained access to the hall, there were plenty of men\r\nsympathisers present, and before the meeting had proceeded far thirteen\r\nmen had been violently thrown out for reminding the Prime Minister that\r\n\"the people\" whose right to govern he was professing to uphold, included\r\nwomen as well as men. Outside, mingling in the vast crowds, bands of\r\nwomen attacked the barricades, the outer barricades being thrown down in\r\nspite of the thousands of police. From the roof of a neighbouring house\r\nMrs. Leigh and Charlotte Marsh tore up dozens of slates and threw them\r\non the roof of Bingley Hall and in the streets below, taking care,\r\nhowever, to strike no one. As Mr. Asquith drove away the women hurled\r\nslates at the guarded motor car. The fire hose was brought forth and the\r\nfiremen were ordered to turn the water on the women. They refused, to\r\ntheir credit be it said, but the police, infuriated by their failure to\r\nkeep the peace, did not scruple to play the cold water on the women as\r\nthey crouched and clung to the dangerous slope of the roof. Roughs in\r\nthe streets flung bricks at them, drawing blood. Eventually the women\r\nwere dragged down by the police and in their dripping garments marched\r\nthrough the streets to the police station.\r\n\r\nThe Suffragettes who had rushed the barricades and flung stones at Mr.\r\nAsquith's departing train received sentences from a fortnight to one\r\nmonth, but Miss Marsh and Mrs. Leigh were sent to prison for three and\r\nfour months respectively. All of the prisoners adopted the hunger\r\nstrike, as we knew they would.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later we were horrified to read in the newspapers that\r\nthese prisoners were being forcibly fed by means of a rubber tube thrust\r\ninto the stomach. Members of the Union applied at once both at the\r\nprison and at the Home Office to learn the truth of the report, but all\r\ninformation was refused. On the following Monday at our request, Mr.\r\nKeir Hardie, at question time in the House, insisted on information from\r\nthe Government. Mr. Masterman, speaking for the Home Secretary,\r\nreluctantly admitted that, in order to preserve the dignity of the\r\nGovernment and at the same time save the lives of the prisoners,\r\n\"hospital treatment\" was being administered. \"Hospital treatment\" was\r\nthe term used to draw attention from one of the most disgusting and\r\nbrutal expedients ever resorted to by prison authorities. No law allows\r\nit except in the case of persons certified to be insane, and even then\r\nwhen the operation is performed by skilled nursing attendants under the\r\ndirection of skilled medical men, it cannot be called safe. In fact, the\r\nasylum cases usually die after a short time. _The Lancet_, perhaps the\r\nbest known medical journal in the language, published a long list of\r\nopinions from distinguished physicians and surgeons who condemned the\r\npractice as applied to the suffrage prisoners as unworthy of\r\ncivilisation. One physician told of a case which had come under his\r\nobservation in which death had occurred almost as soon as the tube had\r\nbeen inserted. Another cited a case where the tongue, twisted behind the\r\nfeeding tube, had, in the struggle, been almost bitten off. Cases where\r\nfood had been injected into the lungs were not unknown. Mr. C.\r\nMansell-Moullin, M.D., F.R.C.S., wrote to _The Times_ that as a hospital\r\nsurgeon of more than thirty years' experience he desired indignantly to\r\nprotest against the Government's term \"Hospital treatment\" in connection\r\nwith the forcible feeding of women. It was a foul libel, he declared,\r\nfor violence and brutality have no place in hospitals. A memorial signed\r\nby 116 well-known physicians was addressed to the Prime Minister\r\nprotesting against the practice of forcible feeding, and pointing out to\r\nhim in detail the grave dangers attaching to it.\r\n\r\nSo much for medical testimony against a form of brutality which\r\ncontinued and still continues in our English prisons, as a punishment\r\nfor women who are there for consciences' sake. As for the testimony of\r\nthe victims, it makes a volume of most revolting sort. Mrs. Leigh, the\r\nfirst victim, is a woman of sturdy constitution, else she could scarcely\r\nhave survived the experience. Thrown into Birmingham prison after the\r\nAsquith demonstration, she had broken the windows of her cell, and as a\r\npunishment was sent to a dark and cold punishment cell. Her hands were\r\nhandcuffed, behind her during the day, and at night in front of her body\r\n_with the palms out_. She refused to touch the food that was brought to\r\nher, and three days after her arrival she was taken to the doctor's\r\nroom. What she saw was enough to terrify the bravest. In the centre of\r\nthe room was a stout chair resting on a cotton sheet. Against the wall,\r\nas if ready for action stood four wardresses. The junior doctor was also\r\non hand. The senior doctor spoke, saying: \"Listen carefully to what I\r\nhave to say. I have orders from my superior officers that you are not to\r\nbe released even on medical grounds. If you still refrain from food I\r\nmust take other measures to compel you to take it.\" Mrs. Leigh replied\r\nthat she did still refuse, and she said further that she knew that she\r\ncould not legally be forcibly fed because an operation could not be\r\nperformed without the consent of the patient if sane. The doctor\r\nrepeated that he had his orders and would carry them out. A number of\r\nwardresses then fell upon Mrs. Leigh, held her down and tilted her chair\r\nbackward. She was so taken by surprise that she could not resist\r\nsuccessfully that time. They managed to make her swallow a little food\r\nfrom a feeding cup. Later two doctors and the wardresses appeared in her\r\ncell, forced Mrs. Leigh down to the bed and held her there. To her\r\nhorror the doctors produced a rubber tube, two yards in length, and this\r\nhe began to stuff up her nostril. The pain was so dreadful that she\r\nshrieked again and again. Three of the wardresses burst into tears and\r\nthe junior doctor begged the other to desist. Having had his orders from\r\nthe Government, the doctor persisted and the tube was pushed down into\r\nthe stomach. One of the doctors, standing on a chair and holding the\r\ntube high poured liquid food through a funnel almost suffocating the\r\npoor victim. \"The drums of my ears,\" she said afterwards, \"seemed to be\r\nbursting. I could feel the pain to the end of the breast bone. When at\r\nlast the tube was withdrawn it felt as if the back of my nose and throat\r\nwere being torn out with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn an almost fainting condition Mrs. Leigh was taken back to the\r\npunishment cell and laid on her plank bed. The ordeal was renewed day\r\nafter day. The other prisoners suffered similar experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe militant movement was at this point when, in October, 1909, I made\r\nmy first visit to the United States. I shall never forget the excitement\r\nof my landing, the first meeting with the American \"reporter,\" an\r\nexperience dreaded by all Europeans. In fact the first few days seemed a\r\nbewildering whirl of reporters and receptions, all leading up to my\r\nfirst lecture at Carnegie Hall on October 25th. The huge hall was\r\nentirely filled, and an enormous crowd of people thronged the streets\r\noutside for blocks. With me on the stage were several women whom I had\r\nmet in Europe, and in the chair was an old friend, Mrs. Stanton Blatch,\r\nwhose early married life had been spent in England. The great crowd\r\nbefore me, however, was made up of strangers, and I could not know how\r\nthey would respond to my story. When I rose to speak a deep hush fell,\r\nbut at my first words: \"I am what you call a hooligan--\" a great shout\r\nof warm and sympathetic laughter shook the walls. Then I knew that I had\r\nfound friends in America. And this all the rest of the tour\r\ndemonstrated. In Boston the committee met me with a big grey automobile\r\ndecorated in the colours of our Union, and that night at Tremont Temple\r\nI spoke to an audience of 2,500 people all most generous in their\r\nresponsiveness. In Baltimore professors, and students from Johns\r\nHopkins University acted as stewards of the meeting. I greatly enjoyed\r\nmy visit to Bryn Mawr College and to Rosemary Hall, a wonderful school\r\nfor girls in Connecticut. In Chicago, I met, among other notable people,\r\nMiss Jane Addams and Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, superintendent of schools.\r\nMy visit to Canada will always be remembered, especially Toronto, where\r\nthe mayor, dressed in the chains of his office, welcomed me. I met too\r\nthe venerable Goldwin Smith, since dead.\r\n\r\nEverywhere I found the Americans kind and keen, and I cannot say too\r\nmuch for the wonderful hospitality they showed me. The women I found\r\nwere remarkably interested in social welfare. The work of the women's\r\nclubs struck me very favourably, and I thought these institutions a\r\nperfect basis for a suffrage movement. But at that time, 1909, the\r\nsuffrage movement in the United States was in a curious state of\r\nquiescence. A large number of women with whom I came in contact appeared\r\nto think it only just that they should have a vote, but few seemed to\r\nrealise any actual need of it. Some, it is true, were beginning to\r\nconnect the vote with the reforms for which they were working so\r\nunselfishly and so devotedly. It was when talking with the younger women\r\nthat I came to feel that under the surface of things in America, a\r\nstrong suffrage movement was stirring. Those young women, leaving their\r\nsplendid colleges to begin life were realising in a very intelligent\r\nfashion that they needed and would be obliged to secure for themselves a\r\npolitical status.\r\n\r\nOn December 1st I sailed on the _Mauretania_ for England, and on\r\narriving I learned that the prison sentence which hung over me while the\r\npetitions case had been argued, was discharged, some unknown friend\r\nhaving paid my fine while I was on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe year 1910 began with a general election, precipitated by the House\r\nof Lords' rejection of Mr. Lloyd-George's 1909 budget. The Liberal Party\r\nwent to the country with promises of taxes on land values. They promised\r\nalso abolition of the veto power of the Lords, Irish Home Rule,\r\ndisestablishment of the Church of Wales, and other reforms. Woman\r\nsuffrage was not directly promised, but Mr. Asquith pledged that, if\r\nretained in office, he would introduce an electoral reform bill which\r\ncould be amended to include woman suffrage. The Unionists under the\r\nleadership of Mr. Balfour, had tariff reform for their programme, and\r\nthey offered not even a vague promise of a possible suffrage measure.\r\nYet we, as usual, went into the constituencies and opposed the Liberal\r\nParty. We had no faith in Mr. Asquith's pledge, and besides, if we had\r\nfailed to oppose the party in power we should but have invited Mr.\r\nAsquith and Mr. Balfour to enter into an agreement not to deal with the\r\nsuffrage, with the view of keeping the cause permanently outside\r\npractical politics. We were in something of the same position as the\r\nIrish Nationalists in 1885, when neither the Liberal nor the\r\nConservative leaders would include home rule in their programme. The\r\nIrish opposed the Liberal Party, with the result that it was returned by\r\nsuch a narrow majority that the Liberal Government was dependent on the\r\nIrish vote in Parliament in order to remain in office. On this account\r\nthey were obliged to bring in a Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nThe other suffrage societies and many of the Liberal women begged us not\r\nto oppose the Liberal party at this election. We were implored to waive\r\nour claim \"just this once\" in view of the importance of the struggle\r\nbetween the Commons and the House of Lords over the budget. We replied\r\nthat the same plea had been made in 1906 when we were implored to waive\r\nour claim \"just this once\" on account of the fiscal issue. For women\r\nthere was only one political issue, we said, and that was the issue of\r\ntheir own enfranchisement. The dispute between the Lords and the Commons\r\nwas far less vital than the claims of the people--represented in this\r\ncase by women--to be admitted to citizenship. From our point of view\r\nboth Houses of Parliament were unrepresentative until women had a voice\r\nin choosing legislators and influencing law making.\r\n\r\nWe opposed Liberal candidates in forty constituencies, and in almost\r\nevery one of these the Liberal majorities were reduced and no less than\r\neighteen seats were wrested from the Liberal candidates. It really was a\r\nterrible election for the Government. Mr. Asquith travelled from one\r\nconstituency to another accompanied by a body guard of detectives, and\r\nofficial \"chuckers out,\" whose sole duty was to eject women, and men as\r\nwell, who interrupted his meetings on the question of Votes for Women.\r\nThe halls where he spoke had the windows boarded up or the glass covered\r\nwith strong wire netting. Every thoroughfare leading to the halls was\r\nbarricaded, traffic was suspended, and large forces of police were on\r\nguard. The most extraordinary precautions were taken to protect the\r\nPrime Minister. At one place he went to his meeting strongly guarded and\r\nby way of a secret pathway that led through gooseberry bushes and a\r\ncabbage patch to a back door. After the meeting he escaped through the\r\nsame door and was solemnly guided along a path heavily laid with sawdust\r\nto deaden his footsteps, to a concealed motor car, where he sat until\r\nthe crowd had all dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe other ministers had to resort to similar precautions. They lived\r\nunder the constant protection of body-guards. Their meetings were\r\npoliced in a manner without precedent. Of course no women were admitted\r\nto their meetings, but they got in just the same. Two women hid for\r\ntwenty-five hours in the rafters of a hall in Louth where Mr.\r\nLloyd-George spoke. They were arrested, but not until after they had\r\nmade their demonstration. Two others hid under a platform for twenty-two\r\nhours in order to question the Prime Minister. I could continue this\r\nrecord almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\nWe had printed a wonderful poster showing the process of forcible\r\nfeeding, and we used it on hoardings everywhere. We told the electors\r\nthat the \"Liberal Party,\" the people's friend, had imprisoned 450 women\r\nfor the crime of asking for a vote. They were torturing women at that\r\ntime in Holloway. It was splendid ammunition and it told. The Liberal\r\nParty was returned to power, but with their majority over all sections\r\nof the House of Commons swept away. The Asquith Government were\r\ndependent now for their very existence on the votes of the Labour Party\r\nand the Irish Nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first months of 1910 were occupied by the re-elected Government in a\r\nstruggle to keep control of affairs. A coalition with the Irish party,\r\nthe leaders of which agreed, if the Home Rule bill were advanced, to\r\nstand by the budget. No publicly announced coalition with the Labour\r\nParty was made at that time, Keir Hardie, at the annual conference of\r\nthe party, announcing that they would continue to be independent of the\r\nGovernment. This was important to us because it meant that the Labour\r\nParty, instead of entering into an agreement to give general support to\r\nall Government measures, would be free to oppose the Government in the\r\nevent of the continued withholding of a franchise bill. Other things\r\ncombined to make us hopeful that the tide had turned in our favour. It\r\nwas hinted to us that the Government were weary of our opposition and\r\nwere ready to end the struggle in the only possible way, providing they\r\ncould do so without appearing to yield to coercion. We therefore, early\r\nin February, declared a truce to all militancy.\r\n\r\nParliament met on February 15th and the King's speech was read on\r\nFebruary 21st. No mention of women's suffrage was made in the speech nor\r\nwas any private member successful in winning a place in the ballot for a\r\nsuffrage bill. However, since the situation, on account of the proposed\r\nabolition of the Lord's power of veto, was strained and abnormal, we\r\ndecided to wait patiently for a while. It was confidently expected that\r\nanother general election would have to be held before the contentions\r\nbetween the two Houses of Parliament were settled, and this event\r\nunquestionably would have occurred, not later than June, but for the\r\nunexpected death of King Edward VII. This interrupted the strained\r\nsituation. The passing of the King served as an occasion for the\r\ntemporary softening of animosities and produced a general disposition to\r\ncompromise on all troubled issues. The question of women's\r\nenfranchisement was taken up again in this spirit, and in a manner\r\naltogether creditable to the members with whom the movement originated.\r\n\r\nA strictly non-party committee on women's suffrage had been established\r\nin the House of Commons in 1887, mainly through the efforts of Miss\r\nLydia Becker, whom I have mentioned before as the Susan B. Anthony of\r\nthe English suffrage movement. In 1906, for reasons not necessary to\r\nenumerate, the original committee had been allowed to lapse, the Liberal\r\nsupporters of women's suffrage forming a committee of their own. Now, in\r\nthis period of good feeling, at the suggestion of certain members, led\r\nby Mr. H. N. Brailsford, not himself a member of Parliament, formed\r\nanother non-party body which they called the Conciliation Committee. Its\r\nobject was declared to be the bringing together of the full strength of\r\nsuffragists of the House of Commons, regardless of party affiliation,\r\nand of framing a suffrage measure that could be passed by their united\r\neffort. The Earl of Lytton accepted the chairmanship of the committee\r\nand Mr. Brailsford was made its secretary. The committee consisted of\r\ntwenty-five Liberals, seventeen Conservatives, six Irish Nationalists,\r\nand six members of the Labour Party. Under difficulties which I can\r\nhardly hope to make clear to American readers the committee laboured to\r\nframe a bill which should win the support of all sections of the House.\r\nThe Conservatives insisted on a moderate bill, whilst the Liberals were\r\nconcerned lest the terms of the bill should add to the power of the\r\npropertied classes. The original suffrage bill, drafted by my husband.\r\nDr. Pankhurst, giving the vote to women on equal terms with men, was\r\nabandoned, and a bill was drawn up along the lines of the existing\r\nmunicipal franchise law. The basis of the municipal franchise is\r\noccupation, and the Conciliation Bill, as first drafted, proposed to\r\nextend the Parliamentary vote to women householders, and to women\r\noccupiers of business premises paying ten pounds rental and upwards. It\r\nwas estimated that about ninety-five per cent. of the women who would be\r\nenfranchised under the bill were householders. This, in England, does\r\nnot mean a person occupying a whole house. Any one who inhabits even a\r\nsingle room over which he or she exercises full control is a\r\nhouseholder.\r\n\r\nThe text of the Conciliation Bill was submitted to all the suffrage\r\nsocieties and other women's organisations, and it was accepted by every\r\none of them. Our official newspaper said editorially: \"We of the Women's\r\nSocial and Political Union are prepared to share in this united and\r\npeaceful action. The new bill does not give us all that we want, but we\r\nare for it if others are also for it.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed certain that an overwhelming majority of the House of Commons\r\nwere for the bill, and were prepared to vote it into law. Although we\r\nknew that it could not possibly pass unless the Government agreed that\r\nit should, we hoped that the leaders of all parties and the majority of\r\ntheir followers would unite in an agreement that the bill should pass.\r\nThis settlement by consent is rare in the English Parliament, but some\r\nextremely important and hard fought measures have been carried thus. The\r\nextension of the franchise in 1867 is a case in point.\r\n\r\nThe Conciliation Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on June\r\n14th, 1910, by Mr. D. J. Shackleton, and was received with the most\r\nextraordinary enthusiasm. The newspapers remarked on the feeling of\r\nreality which marked the attitude of the House towards the bill. It was\r\nplain that the members realised that here was no academic question upon\r\nwhich they were merely to debate and to register their opinions, but a\r\nmeasure which was intended to be carried through all its stages and to\r\nbe written into English law. The enthusiasm of the House swept all over\r\nthe Kingdom. The medical profession sent in a memorial in its favour,\r\nsigned by more than three hundred of the most distinguished men and\r\nwomen in the profession. Memorials from writers, clergymen, social\r\nworkers, artists, actors, musicians, were also sent. The Women's Liberal\r\nFederation met and unanimously resolved to ask the Prime Minister to\r\ngive full facilities to the bill. Some advanced spirits in the\r\nFederation actually proposed to send then and there a deputation to the\r\nHouse of Commons with the resolution, but this proposal was rejected as\r\nsavouring too much of militancy. A request for an interview was sent to\r\nMr. Asquith, and he replied promising to receive, at an early day,\r\nrepresentatives of both the Liberal Women's Federation and of the\r\nNational Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.\r\n\r\nThe joint deputation was received by Mr. Asquith on June 21st, and Lady\r\nM'Laren, as a representative of the Women's Liberal Federation, spoke\r\nvery directly to her party's leader. She said in part: \"If you refuse\r\nour request we shall have to go to the country and say you, who are\r\nagainst the veto of the House of Lords, are placing a veto on the House\r\nof Commons by refusing to allow a second reading of this bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith replied warily that he could not decide alone on such a\r\nserious matter, but would have to consult his Cabinet, the majority of\r\nwhom, he admitted, were suffragists. Their decision, he said, would be\r\ngiven in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVER 1,000 WOMEN HAD BEEN IN PRISON--BROAD ARROWS IN THE\r\n1910 PARADE]\r\n\r\nThe Women's Social and Political Union arranged a demonstration in\r\nsupport of the Conciliation Bill, the greatest that had, up to that\r\ntime, been made. It was a national, indeed an inter-national affair in\r\nwhich all the suffrage groups took part, and its massed ranks were so\r\ngreat that the procession required an hour and a half to pass a given\r\npoint. At the head marched six hundred and seventeen women, white clad\r\nand holding long silver staves tipped with the broad arrow. These were\r\nthe women who had suffered imprisonment for the cause, and all along the\r\nline of march they received a tribute of cheers from the public. The\r\nimmense Albert Hall, the largest hall in England, although it was packed\r\nfrom orchestra to the highest gallery, was not large enough to hold all\r\nthe marchers. Amid great joy and enthusiasm Lord Lytton delivered a\r\nstirring address in which he confidently predicted the speedy advance of\r\nthe bill. The women, he declared, had every reason to believe that their\r\nenfranchisement was actually at hand.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the time for passing a suffrage bill was ripe. Not in\r\nfifty years had the way been so clear, because the momentary absence of\r\nordinary legislation left the field open for an electoral reform bill.\r\nYet when the Prime Minister was asked in the House of Commons whether he\r\nwould give the members an early opportunity for discussion, the answer\r\nwas not encouraging. The Government, said Mr. Asquith, were prepared to\r\ngive time before the close of the session for full debate and division\r\non second reading, but they could not allow any further facilities. He\r\nstated frankly that he personally did not want the bill to pass, but the\r\nGovernment realised that the House of Commons ought to have an\r\nopportunity, if that was their deliberate desire, for effectively\r\ndealing with the whole question.\r\n\r\nThis cryptic utterance was taken by the majority of the suffragists, by\r\nthe press and by the public generally to mean that the Government were\r\npreparing gracefully to yield to the undoubted desire of the House of\r\nCommons to pass the bill. But the Women's Social and Political Union\r\nwere doubtful. Mr. Asquith's remark was ambiguous, and was capable of\r\nbeing interpreted in several ways. It could mean that he was prepared to\r\naccept the verdict of the majority and let the bill pass through all its\r\nstages. That of course would be the only way to allow the House\r\nopportunity effectively to deal with the whole question. On the other\r\nhand Mr. Asquith might be intending to let the bill pass through its\r\ndebating stages and be afterwards smothered in committee. We feared\r\ntreachery, but in view of the announcement that the Government had set\r\napart July 11 and 12 for debate on the second reading, we preserved a\r\nspirit of waiting calm. July 26th had been fixed as the day for the\r\nadjournment of Parliament, and if the bill was voted on favourably on\r\nthe 12th there would be ample time to take it through its final stages.\r\nWhen a bill passes its second reading it is normally sent upstairs to a\r\nGrand Committee which sits while the House of Commons is transacting\r\nother business, and thus the committee stage can proceed without special\r\nfacilities. The bill does not go back to the House until the report\r\nstage is reached, at which time the third and last reading occurs. After\r\nthat the bill goes to the House of Lords. A week at most is all that is\r\nrequired for this procedure. A bill may be referred to the Whole House,\r\nand in this case it cannot be brought up for its committee stage unless\r\nit is given special facilities. In our paper and in many public\r\nspeeches we urged that the members vote to send the bill to a Grand\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nSome days before the bill reached its second reading it was rumoured\r\nthat Mr. Lloyd-George was going to speak against it, but we refused to\r\ncredit this. Unfair to women as Mr. Lloyd-George had shown himself in\r\nvarious ways, he had consistently posed as a staunch friend of women's\r\nsuffrage, and we could not believe that he would turn against us at the\r\neleventh hour. Mr. Winston Churchill, whose speech to the women of\r\nDundee I quoted in a previous chapter, the promoters of the Bill also\r\ncounted upon, as it was known that he had more than once expressed\r\nsympathy with its objects. But when the debates began we found both of\r\nthese ardent suffragists arrayed against the bill. Mr. Churchill, after\r\nmaking a conventional anti-suffrage speech, in which he said that women\r\ndid not need the ballot, and that they really had no grievances,\r\nattacked the Conciliation Bill because the class of women who would be\r\nenfranchised under it did not suit him. Some women, he conceded, ought\r\nto be enfranchised, and he thought the best plan would be to select\r\n\"some of the best women of all classes\" on considerations of property,\r\neducation and earning capacity. These special franchises would be\r\ncarefully balanced, \"so as not on the whole to give undue advantage to\r\nthe property vote against the wage earning vote.\" A more fantastic\r\nproposal and one less likely to find favour in the House of Commons\r\ncould not possibly be imagined. Mr. Churchill's second objection to the\r\nbill was that it was anti-democratic! It seemed to us that anything was\r\nmore democratic than his proposed \"fancy\" franchises.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd-George said that he agreed with everything Mr. Churchill had\r\nsaid \"both relevant and irrelevant.\" He made the amazing assertion that\r\nthe Conciliation Committee that had drafted the bill was a \"committee of\r\nwomen meeting outside the House.\" And that this committee said to the\r\nHouse of Commons not only that they must vote for a women's suffrage\r\nbill but \"You must vote for the particular form upon which we agree, and\r\nwe will not even allow you to deliberate upon any other form.\"\r\n\r\nOf course these statements were wholly false. The Conciliation Bill was\r\ndrafted by men, and it was introduced because the Government had refused\r\nto bring in a party measure. The suffragists would have been only too\r\nglad to have had the Government deliberate on a broader form of\r\nsuffrage. Because they refused to deliberate on any form, this private\r\nbill was introduced.\r\n\r\nThis fact was brought forward in the course of Mr. Lloyd-George's\r\nspeech. It had been urged, said he, that this bill was better than none\r\nat all, but why should that be the alternative? \"What is the other?\"\r\ncalled out a member, but Mr. Lloyd-George dodged the question with a\r\ncareless \"Well, I cannot say for the present.\"\r\n\r\nLater on he said: \"If the promoters of this bill say that they regard\r\nthe second reading merely as an affirmation of the principle of women's\r\nsuffrage, and if they promise that when they re-introduce the bill it\r\nwill be in a form which will enable the House of Commons to move any\r\namendment either for restriction or extension I shall be happy to vote\r\nfor this bill.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Philip Snowden, replying to this, said: \"We will withdraw this bill\r\nif the Right Honourable gentleman, on behalf of the Government, or the\r\nPrime Minister himself will undertake to give to this House the\r\nopportunity of discussing and carrying through its various stages\r\nanother form of franchise bill. If we cannot get that, then we shall\r\nprosecute this bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government made no reply at all to this, and the debate proceeded.\r\nThirty-nine speeches were made, the Prime Minister showing plainly in\r\nhis speech that he intended to use all his power to prevent the bill\r\nbecoming law. He began by saying that a franchise measure ought never to\r\nbe sent to a Grand Committee, but to one of the Whole House. He said\r\nalso that his conditions, that the majority of women should show beyond\r\nany doubt that they desired the franchise, and that the bill be\r\ndemocratic in its terms, had not been complied with.\r\n\r\nWhen the division was taken it was seen that the Conciliation Bill had\r\npassed its second reading by a majority of 109, a larger majority than\r\nthe Government's far famed budget or the House of Lords Resolution had\r\nreceived. In fact no measure during that Parliament had received so\r\ngreat a majority--299 members voted for it as against 190 opposed. Then\r\nthe question arose as to which committee should deal with the bill. Mr.\r\nAsquith had said that all franchise bills should go to a Committee of\r\nthe Whole House, so that in the division his words moved many sincere\r\nfriends of the bill to send it there. Others understood that this was a\r\nmischievous course, but were afraid of incurring the anger of the Prime\r\nMinister. Of course all the anti-suffragists voted the same way, and\r\nthus the bill went to the Whole House.\r\n\r\nEven then the bill could have been advanced to its final reading. The\r\nHouse had time on their hands, as virtually all important legislative\r\nwork was halted because of the deadlock between the Lords and the\r\nCommons. Following the death of the King a conference of leaders of the\r\nConservative and the Liberal Parties had been arranged to adjust the\r\nmatters at issue, and this conference had not yet reported. Hence\r\nParliament had little business on hand. The strongest possible pressure\r\nwas brought to bear upon the Government to give facilities to the\r\nConciliation Bill. A number of meetings were held in support of the\r\nbill. The Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement, the Men's\r\nLeague for Women's Suffrage and the Conciliation Committee held a joint\r\nmeeting in Hyde Park. Some of the old school of suffragists held another\r\nlarge meeting in Trafalgar Square. The Women's Social and Political\r\nUnion, on July 23rd, which was the anniversary of the day in 1867 on\r\nwhich working men, agitating for their vote, had pulled down the Hyde\r\nPark railings, held another enormous demonstration there. A space of\r\nhalf a square mile was cleared, forty platforms erected, and two great\r\nprocessions marched from east and west to the meeting. Many other\r\nsuffrage societies co-operated with us on this occasion. On the very\r\nday of that meeting Mr. Asquith wrote to Lord Lytton refusing to allow\r\nany more time for the bill during that session.\r\n\r\nThose who still had faith that the Government could be induced to do\r\njustice to women set their hopes on the autumn session of Parliament.\r\nResolutions urging the Government to give the bill facilities during the\r\nautumn were sent, not only by the suffrage associations but from many\r\norganisations of men. The Corporations of thirty-eight cities, including\r\nLiverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Dublin and Cork, sent resolutions to\r\nthis effect. Cabinet Ministers were besieged with requests to receive\r\ndeputations of women, and since the country was on the verge of a\r\ngeneral election, and the Liberal Party wanted the services of women,\r\ntheir requests could not altogether be ignored. Mr. Asquith, early in\r\nOctober, received a deputation of women from his own constituency of\r\nEast Fife, but all he had to tell them was that the bill could not be\r\nadvanced that year. \"What about next year?\" They asked, and he replied\r\nshortly: \"Wait and see.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been exceedingly difficult, during these troublous days, to hold\r\nall the members of the W. S. P. U. to the truce, and when it became\r\nperfectly apparent that the Conciliation Bill was doomed, war was again\r\ndeclared. At a great meeting held in Albert Hall on November 10th, I\r\nmyself threw down the gage of battle. I said, because I wanted the whole\r\nmatter to be clearly understood by the public as well as by our members:\r\n\"This is the last constitutional effort of the Women's Social and\r\nPolitical Union to secure the passage of the bill into law. If the Bill,\r\nin spite of our efforts, is killed by the Government, then first of all,\r\nI have to say there is an end of the truce. If we are met by the\r\nstatement that there is no power to secure on the floor of the House of\r\nCommons time for our measure, then our first step is to say, 'We take it\r\nout of your hands, since you fail to help us, and we resume the\r\ndirection of the campaign ourselves.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother deputation, I declared, must go to the House of Commons to carry\r\na petition to the Prime Minister. I myself would lead, and if no one\r\ncared to follow me I would go alone. Instantly, all over the hall, women\r\nsprang to their feet crying out, \"Mrs. Pankhurst, I will go with you!\"\r\n\"I will go!\" \"I will go!\" And I knew that our brave women were as ever\r\nready to give themselves, their very lives, if need be, for the cause of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThe autumn session convened on Friday, November 18th, and Mr. Asquith\r\nannounced that Parliament would be adjourned on November 28th. While his\r\nspeech was in progress, 450 women, in small groups, to keep within the\r\nstrict letter of the law, were marching from Caxton Hall and from the\r\nheadquarters of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HEAD OF THE DEPUTATION ON BLACK FRIDAY\r\n\r\n_November, 1910_]\r\n\r\nHow to tell the story of that dreadful day, Black Friday, as it lives in\r\nour memory--how to describe what happened to English women at the behest\r\nof an English Government, is a difficult task. I will try to tell it as\r\nsimply and as accurately as possible. The plain facts, baldly stated, I\r\nam aware will strain credulity.\r\n\r\nRemember that the country was on the eve of a general election, and that\r\nthe Liberal Party needed the help of Liberal women. This fact made the\r\nwholesale arrest and imprisonment of great numbers of women, who were\r\ndemanding the passage of the Conciliation Bill, extremely undesirable\r\nfrom the Government's point of view. The Women's Liberal Federations\r\nalso wanted the passage of the Conciliation Bill, although they were not\r\nready to fight for it. What the Government feared, was that the Liberal\r\nwomen would be stirred by our sufferings into refraining from doing\r\nelection work for the party. So the Government conceived a plan whereby\r\nthe Suffragettes were to be punished, were to be turned back and\r\ndefeated in their purpose of reaching the House, but would not be\r\narrested. Orders were evidently given that the police were to be present\r\nin the streets, and that the women were to be thrown from one uniformed\r\nor ununiformed policeman to another, that they were to be so rudely\r\ntreated that sheer terror would cause them to turn back. I say orders\r\nwere given and as one proof of this I can first point out that on all\r\nprevious occasions the police had first tried to turn back the\r\ndeputations and when the women persisted in going forward, had arrested\r\nthem. At times individual policemen had behaved with cruelty and malice\r\ntoward us, but never anything like the unanimous and wholesale brutality\r\nthat was shown on Black Friday.\r\n\r\nThe Government very likely hoped that the violence of the police\r\ntowards the women would be emulated by the crowds, but instead the\r\ncrowds proved remarkably friendly. They pushed and struggled to make a\r\nclear pathway for us, and in spite of the efforts of the police my small\r\ndeputation actually succeeded in reaching the door of the Strangers'\r\nEntrance. We mounted the steps to the enthusiastic cheers of the\r\nmultitudes that filled the streets, and we stood there for hours gazing\r\ndown on a scene which I hope never to look upon again.\r\n\r\nAt intervals of two or three minutes small groups of women appeared in\r\nthe square, trying to join us at the Strangers' Entrance. They carried\r\nlittle banners inscribed with various mottoes, \"Asquith Has Vetoed Our\r\nBill,\" \"Where There's a Bill There's a Way,\" \"Women's Will Beats\r\nAsquith's Won't,\" and the like. These banners the police seized and tore\r\nin pieces. Then they laid hands on the women and literally threw them\r\nfrom one man to another. Some of the police used their fists, striking\r\nthe women in their faces, their breasts, their shoulders. One woman I\r\nsaw thrown down with violence three or four times in rapid succession,\r\nuntil at last she lay only half conscious against the curb, and in a\r\nserious condition was carried away by kindly strangers. Every moment the\r\nstruggle grew fiercer, as more and more women arrived on the scene.\r\nWomen, many of them eminent in art, in medicine and science, women of\r\nEuropean reputation, subjected to treatment that would not have been\r\nmeted out to criminals, and all for the offence of insisting upon the\r\nright of peaceful petition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOR HOURS SCENES LIKE THIS WERE ENACTED ON BLACK FRIDAY\r\n\r\n_November, 1910_]\r\n\r\nThis struggle lasted for about an hour, more and more women successfully\r\npushing their way past the police and gaining the steps of the House.\r\nThen the mounted police were summoned to turn the women back. But,\r\ndesperately determined, the women, fearing not the hoofs of the horses\r\nor the crushing violence of the police, did not swerve from their\r\npurpose. And now the crowds began to murmur. People began to demand why\r\nthe women were being knocked about; why, if they were breaking the law,\r\nthey were not arrested; why, if they were not breaking the law, they\r\nwere not permitted to go on unmolested. For a long time, nearly five\r\nhours, the police continued to hustle and beat the women, the crowds\r\nbecoming more and more turbulent in their defence. Then, at last the\r\npolice were obliged to make arrests. One hundred and fifteen women and\r\nfour men, most of them bruised and choked and otherwise injured, were\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on outside the House of Commons, the Prime\r\nMinister was obstinately refusing to listen to the counsels of some of\r\nthe saner and more justice-loving members of the House. Keir Hardie, Sir\r\nAlfred Mondell and others urged Mr. Asquith to receive the deputation,\r\nand Lord Castlereagh went so far as to move as an amendment to a\r\nGovernment proposal, another proposal which would have compelled the\r\nGovernment to provide immediate facilities to the Conciliation Bill. We\r\nheard of what was going on, and I sent in for one and another friendly\r\nmember and made every possible effort to influence them in favour of\r\nLord Castlereagh's amendment. I pointed to the brutal struggle that was\r\ngoing on in the square, and I begged them to go back and tell the others\r\nthat it must be stopped. But, distressed as some of them undoubtedly\r\nwere, they assured me that there was not the slightest chance for the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\"Is there not a single _man_ in the House of Commons,\" I cried, \"one who\r\nwill stand up for us, who will make the House see that the amendment\r\nmust go forward?\"\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps there were men there, but all save fifty-two put their\r\nparty loyalty before their manhood, and, because Lord Castlereagh's\r\nproposal would have meant censure of the Government, they refused to\r\nsupport it. This did not happen, however, until Mr. Asquith had resorted\r\nto his usual crafty device of a promise of future action. In this\r\ninstance he promised to make a statement on behalf of the Government on\r\nthe following Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the suffrage prisoners were arraigned in police court.\r\nOr rather, they were kept waiting outside the court room while Mr.\r\nMuskett, who prosecuted on behalf of the Chief Commissioner of Police,\r\nexplained to the astounded magistrate that he had received orders from\r\nthe Home Secretary that the prisoners should all be discharged. Mr.\r\nChurchill it was declared, had had the matter under careful\r\nconsideration, and had decided that \"no public advantage would be gained\r\nby proceeding with the prosecution, and accordingly no evidence would\r\nbe given against the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nSubdued laughter and, according to the newspapers, some contemptuous\r\nbooing were raised in the court, and when order was restored the\r\nprisoners were brought in in batches and told that they were discharged.\r\n\r\nOn the following Tuesday the W. S. P. U. held another meeting of the\r\nWomen's Parliament in Caxton Hall to hear the news from the House of\r\nCommons. Mr. Asquith said: \"The Government will, if they are still in\r\npower, give facilities in the next Parliament for effectively proceeding\r\nwith a franchise bill which is so framed as to admit of free amendment.\"\r\nHe would not promise that this would be done during the first year of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nWe had demanded facilities for the Conciliation Bill, and Mr. Asquith's\r\npromise was too vague and too ambiguous to please us. The Parliament now\r\nabout to be dissolved had lasted a scant ten months. The next one might\r\nnot last longer. Therefore, Mr. Asquith's promise, as usual, meant\r\nnothing at all. I said to the women, \"I am going to Downing Street. Come\r\nalong, all of you.\" And we went.\r\n\r\nWe found a small force of police in Downing Street, and we easily broke\r\nthrough their line and would have invaded the Prime Minister's residence\r\nhad not reinforcements of police arrived on the scene. Mr. Asquith\r\nhimself appeared unexpectedly, and as we thought, very opportunely.\r\nBefore he could have realised what was happening he found himself\r\nsurrounded by angry Suffragettes. He was well hooted and, it is said,\r\nwell shaken, before he was rescued by the police. As his taxicab rushed\r\naway some object struck one of the windows, smashing it.\r\n\r\nAnother Cabinet Minister, Mr. Birrell, unwittingly got into the midst of\r\nthe melee, and I am obliged to record that he was pretty thoroughly\r\nhustled. But it is not true that his leg was injured by the women. His\r\nhaste to jump into a taxicab resulted in a slightly sprained ankle.\r\n\r\nThat night and the following day windows were broken in the houses of\r\nSir Edward Grey, Mr. Winston Churchill, Mr. Lewis Harcourt and Mr. John\r\nBurns; and also in the official residences of the Premier and the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThat week 160 Suffragettes were arrested, but all except those charged\r\nwith window-breaking or assault were discharged. This amazing court\r\naction established two things: First, that when the Home Secretary\r\nstated that he had no responsibility for the prosecution and sentencing\r\nof Suffrage prisoners, he told a colossal falsehood; and second, that\r\nthe Government fully realised that it was bad election tactics to be\r\nresponsible for the imprisonment of women of good character who were\r\nstruggling for citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the events chronicled in the preceding chapter\r\nI sailed for my second tour through the United States. I was delighted\r\nto find a thoroughly alive and progressive suffrage movement, where\r\nbefore had existed with most people only an academic theory in favour of\r\nequal political rights between men and women. My first meeting, held in\r\nBrooklyn, was advertised by sandwich women walking through the principal\r\nstreets of the city, quite like our militant suffragists at home. Street\r\nmeetings, I found, were now daily occurrences in New York. The Women's\r\nPolitical Union had adopted an election policy, and throughout the\r\ncountry as far west as I travelled, I found women awakened to the\r\nnecessity of political action instead of mere discussion of suffrage.\r\n\r\nMy second visit to America, like my first one, is clouded in my memory\r\nwith sorrow. Very soon after my return to England a beloved sister, Mrs.\r\nMary Clarke died. My sister, who was a most ardent suffragist and a\r\nvalued worker in the Women's Social and Political Union, was one of the\r\nwomen who was shockingly maltreated in Parliament Square on Black\r\nFriday. She was also one of the women who, a few days later, registered\r\ntheir protest against the Government by throwing a stone through the\r\nwindow of an official residence. For this act she was sent to Holloway\r\nprison for a term of one month. Released on December 21st, it was plain\r\nto those who knew her best that her health had suffered seriously from\r\nthe dreadful experience of Black Friday and the after experience of\r\nprison. She died suddenly on Christmas day, to the profound sorrow of\r\nall her associates. Hers was not the only life that was sacrificed as a\r\nresult of that day. Other deaths occurred, mostly from hearts weakened\r\nby overstrain. Miss Henria Williams died on January 2nd, 1911, from\r\nheart failure. Miss Cecelia Wolseley Haig was another victim. Ill\r\ntreatment on Black Friday resulted in her case in a painful illness\r\nwhich ended, after a year of intense suffering, in her death on December\r\n21st, 1911.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to publish a full list of all the women who have died\r\nor have been injured for life in the course of the suffrage agitation in\r\nEngland. In many cases the details have never been made public, and I do\r\nnot feel at liberty to record them here. A very celebrated case, which\r\nis public property, is that of Lady Constance Lytton, sister of the Earl\r\nof Lytton, who acted as chairman of the Conciliation Committee. Lady\r\nConstance had twice in 1909 gone to prison as a result of suffrage\r\nactivities, and on both occasions had been given special privileges on\r\naccount of her rank and family influence. In spite of her protests and\r\nher earnest pleadings to be accorded the same treatment as other\r\nsuffrage prisoners, the snobbish and cowardly authorities insisted in\r\nretaining Lady Constance in the hospital cells and discharging her\r\nbefore the expiration of her sentence. This was done on a plea of her\r\nill health, and it was true that she suffered from a valvular disease of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIOT SCENES ON BLACK FRIDAY\r\n\r\n_November, 1910_]\r\n\r\nSmarting under the sense of the injustice done her comrades in this\r\ndiscrimination, Lady Constance Lytton did one of the most heroic deeds\r\nto be recorded in the history of the suffrage movement. She cut off her\r\nbeautiful hair and otherwise disguised herself, put on cheap and ugly\r\nclothing, and as \"Jane Warton\" took part in a demonstration at\r\nNewcastle, again suffering arrest and imprisonment. This time the\r\nauthorities treated her as an ordinary prisoner. Without testing her\r\nheart or otherwise giving her an adequate medical examination, they\r\nsubjected her to the horrors of forcible feeding. Owing to her fragile\r\nconstitution she suffered frightful nausea each time, and when on one\r\noccasion the doctor's clothing was soiled, he struck her contemptuously\r\non the cheek. This treatment was continued until the identity of the\r\nprisoner suddenly became known. She was, of course, immediately\r\nreleased, but she never recovered from the experience, and is now a\r\nhopeless invalid.[2]\r\n\r\nI want to say right here, that those well-meaning friends on the outside\r\nwho say that we have suffered these horrors of prison, of hunger strikes\r\nand forcible feeding, because we desired to martyrise ourselves for the\r\ncause, are absolutely and entirely mistaken. We never went to prison in\r\norder to be martyrs. We went there in order that we might obtain the\r\nrights of citizenship. We were willing to break laws that we might force\r\nmen to give us the right to make laws. That is the way men have earned\r\ntheir citizenship. Truly says Mazzini that the way to reform has always\r\nled through prison.\r\n\r\nThe result of the general election, which took place in January, 1911,\r\nwas that the Liberal Party was again returned to power. Parliament met\r\non January 31st, but the session formally opened on February 6th with\r\nthe reading of the King's speech. The programme for the session included\r\nthe Lords' veto measure, Home Rule, payment for members of Parliament,\r\nand the abolishment of plural voting. Invalid insurance was also\r\nmentioned and certain amendments to the old age pension bill. Women's\r\nsuffrage was not mentioned. Nevertheless, we were singularly lucky, the\r\nfirst three places in the ballot being secured by members of the\r\nConciliation Committee. Mr. Philips, an Irish member, drew the first\r\nplace, but as the Irish party had decided not to introduce any bills\r\nthat session, he yielded to Sir George Kemp, who announced that he would\r\nuse his place for the purpose of taking a second reading debate on the\r\nnew Conciliation Bill. The old bill had been entitled: \"A Bill to give\r\nthe Vote to Women Occupiers,\" a title that made amendment difficult. The\r\nnew bill bore the more flexible title, \"A Bill to Confer the\r\nParliamentary Franchise on Women,\" thus doing away with one of Mr.\r\nLloyd-George's most plausible objections to it. The L10 occupation\r\nclause was omitted, doing away with another objection, that of the\r\npossibility of \"faggot voting,\" that is, of a rich man conferring the\r\nvote on a family of daughters by the simple expedient of making them\r\ntenants of slices of his own property. The Conciliation Bill now read:\r\n\"1. Every woman possessed of a household qualification within the\r\nmeaning of the Representation of the People Act (1884) shall be entitled\r\nto be registered as a voter, and when registered to vote in the county\r\nor borough in which the qualifying premises are situated.\r\n\r\n\"2. For the purposes of this Act a woman shall not be disqualified by\r\nmarriage for being registered as a voter, provided that a husband and\r\nwife shall not both be registered as voters in the same Parliamentary\r\nborough or county division.\"\r\n\r\nThis bill met with even warmer approval than the first one, because it\r\nwas believed that it would win votes from those members who felt that\r\nthe original measure had fallen short of being truly democratic.\r\nNevertheless, the Prime Minister showed from the first that he intended\r\nto oppose it, as he had all previous suffrage measures. He announced\r\nthat all Fridays up to Easter and also all time on Tuesdays and\r\nWednesdays usually allowed for private members' bills were to be\r\noccupied with consideration of Government measures. Hardly a Liberal\r\nvoice was raised against this arbitrary ruling. The Irish members indeed\r\nwere delighted with it, since it gave the Home Rule Bill an advantage.\r\nThe Labour members seemed complacent, and the rest of the coalition were\r\nindifferent. One back bench Liberal went so far as to rise and thank the\r\nPrime Minister for the courtesy with which the gagging process was\r\naccomplished. There was some show of fight made by the Opposition, but\r\nConservative indignation was tempered by the reflection that the\r\nprecedent established might be followed to advantage when their party\r\ncame into power.\r\n\r\nSir George Kemp then announced that he would take May 5th for the second\r\nreading of the Conciliation Bill, and the supporters of the bill,\r\naccording to their various convictions, set to work to further its\r\ninterests. The conviction of the W. S. P. U. was that Mr. Asquith's\r\nGovernment would never allow the bill to pass until they were actually\r\nforced to do so, and we adopted our own methods to secure a definite\r\npledge from the Government that they would give facilities to the bill.\r\n\r\nIn April of that year the census was to be taken, and we organised a\r\ncensus resistance on the part of women. According to our law the census\r\nof the entire kingdom must be taken every ten years on a designated day.\r\nOur plan was to reduce the value of the census for statistical purposes\r\nby refusing to make the required returns. Two ways of resistance\r\npresented themselves. The first and most important was direct resistance\r\nby occupiers who should refuse to fill in the census papers. This laid\r\nthe register open to a fine of L5 or a month's imprisonment, and thus\r\nrequired the exercise of considerable courage. The second means of\r\nresistance was evasion--staying away from home during the entire time\r\nthat the enumerators were taking the census. We made the announcement of\r\nthis plan and instantly there ensued a splendid response from women and\r\na chorus of horrified disapproval from the conservative public. The\r\n_Times_ voiced this disapproval in a leading article, to which I\r\nreplied, giving our reasons for the protest. \"The Census,\" I wrote, \"is\r\na numbering of the people. Until women count as people for the purpose\r\nof representation in the councils of the nation as well as for purposes\r\nof taxation, we shall refuse to be numbered.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of laws made by men--without the assistance of women--for\r\nthe protection of women and children, I have a very special feeling.\r\nFrom my experience as poor law guardian and as Registrar of Births and\r\nDeaths, I know how ridiculously, say rather how tragically, these laws\r\nfall short of protection. Take for instance the vaunted \"Children's\r\nCharter\" of 1906, the measure which spread Mr. Lloyd-George's fame\r\nthroughout the world. A volume could be filled with the mistakes and the\r\ncruelties of that Act, the object of which is the preservation and\r\nimprovement of child life. A distinguishing characteristic of the Act is\r\nthat it puts most of the responsibility for neglect of children on the\r\nbacks of the mothers, who, under the laws of England, have no rights as\r\nparents. Two or three especially striking cases of this kind came into\r\nnotice about this time, and gave the census resistance an additional\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nThe case of Annie Woolmore was a very pitiful one. She was arrested and\r\nsentenced to Holloway for six weeks for neglecting her children. The\r\nevidence showed that the woman lived with her husband and children in a\r\nmiserable hovel, which would have been almost impossible to keep clean\r\neven if there had been water in the house. As it was the poor soul, who\r\nwas in ill health and weakened by deprivation, had to carry all the\r\nwater she used across a great distance. The children as well as the\r\nhouse were very dirty, it was true, but the children were well nourished\r\nand kindly treated. The husband, a labourer, out of work much of the\r\ntime, testified that his wife \"starved herself to feed the kids.\" Yet\r\nshe had violated the terms of the \"Children's Charter\" and she went to\r\nprison. I am glad to say that owing to the efforts of suffragists she\r\nwas pardoned and provided with a better home.\r\n\r\nAnother case was that of Helen Conroy, who was charged with living in\r\none wretched room, with her husband and seven children, the youngest a\r\nmonth old. According to the law the mother was forbidden to have this\r\ninfant in bed with her overnight, yet part of the charge against her was\r\nthat the child was found sleeping in a box of damp straw. Doubtless she\r\nwould have preferred a cradle, or even a box of dry straw. But direst\r\npoverty made the cradle impossible and the conditions of the tenement\r\nkept the straw damp. Both parents in this instance were sent to prison\r\nfor three months at hard labour. The magistrate casually remarked that\r\nthe house in which these poor people lived had been condemned two years\r\nbefore, but some respectable property owner was still collecting rents\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nAnother poor mother, evicted from her home because she could not pay the\r\nrent, took her four children out into the open country, and when found\r\nwas sleeping with them in a gravel pit. She was sent to prison for a\r\nmonth and the children went to the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThese sorry mothers, logical results of the subjection of women, are\r\nenough in themselves to justify almost any defiance of a Government who\r\ndeny the women the right to work out their destinies in freedom. No\r\npledge having been secured from the Prime Minister by April 1st, we\r\ncarried out, and most successfully, our census resistance. Many\r\nthousands of women all over the country refused or evaded the returns. I\r\nreturned my census paper with the words \"No vote no census\" written\r\nacross it, and other women followed that example with similar messages.\r\nOne woman filled in the blank with full information about her one man\r\nservant, and added that there were many women but no more persons in her\r\nhousehold. In Birmingham sixteen women of wealth packed their houses\r\nwith women resisters. They slept on the floors, on chairs and tables,\r\nand even in the baths. The head of a large college threw open the\r\nbuilding to 300 women. Many women in other cities held all night parties\r\nfor friends who wished to remain away from home. In some places\r\nunoccupied houses were rented for the night by resisters, who lay on the\r\nbare boards. Some groups of women hired gipsy vans and spent the night\r\non the moors.\r\n\r\nIn London we gave a great concert at Queen's Hall on Census night. Many\r\nof us walked about Trafalgar Square until midnight and then repaired to\r\nAldwich skating rink, where we amused ourselves until morning. Some\r\nskated while others looked on, and enjoyed the admirable musical and\r\ntheatrical entertainment that helped to pass the hours. We had with us a\r\nnumber of the brightest stars in the theatrical world, and they were\r\ngenerous in their contributions. It being Sunday night, the chairman had\r\nto call on each of the artists for a \"speech\" instead of a song or other\r\nturn. An all-night restaurant near at hand did a big business, and on\r\nthe whole the resisters had a very good time. The Scala Theatre was the\r\nscene of another all-night entertainment.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of curiosity to see what the Government would\r\ndevise in the way of a punishment for the rebellious women, but the\r\nGovernment realised the impossibility of taking punitive action, and Mr.\r\nJohn Burns, who, as head of the Local Government Board, was responsible\r\nfor the census, announced that they had decided to treat the affair with\r\nmagnanimity. The number of evasions, he declared, was insignificant. But\r\nevery one knew that this was the exact reverse of the facts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THIS MANNER THOUSANDS OF WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM\r\nSLEPT IN UNOCCUPIED HOUSES OVER CENSUS NIGHT]\r\n\r\nThe Conciliation Bill was debated on May 5th and passed its second\r\nreading by the enormous majority of 137. And now the public and a\r\nsection of the press united in a strong demand that the Government yield\r\nto the undoubted will of the House and grant facilities to the bill. The\r\nConciliation Committee sent a deputation of members to the Prime\r\nMinister to remind him of his pre-election promise that the House of\r\nCommons should have an opportunity of dealing with the whole question\r\nof woman suffrage, but they succeeded only in getting his assurance that\r\nhe had the matter under consideration. Late in the month the\r\nannouncement was made in the House that the Government would not grant\r\nfacilities during that session, but, since the new bill fulfilled the\r\nconditions named by the Prime Minister, and was now capable of\r\namendment, the Government recognised it to be their duty to grant\r\nfacilities in some session of the present Parliament. They would be\r\nprepared next session, when the bill had been again read for the second\r\ntime, either as a result of obtaining a good place in the ballot, or (if\r\nthat did not happen) by a grant of a Government day for the purpose, to\r\ngive a week, which they understood to be the time suggested as\r\nreasonable by the promoters for its further stages.\r\n\r\nThis pledge was made in order to deter the W. S. P. U. from making a\r\nmilitant demonstration in connection with the coronation of the King.\r\n\r\nKeir Hardie asked if the Government would, by means of a closure or\r\notherwise, make certain that the bill would go through in the week, and\r\nthe Prime Minister replied, \"No, I cannot give an assurance of that\r\nkind. After all, it is a problem of the very greatest magnitude.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply seemed to make the Government's pledge practically worthless.\r\nThe Conciliation Committee also realised the possibilities of the bill\r\nbeing talked out, and Lord Lytton wrote to Mr. Asquith and asked him for\r\nassurances that the facilities offered were intended not for academic\r\ndiscussion but for effective opportunity for carrying the bill. He also\r\nasked that the week offered should not be construed rigidly but that,\r\nproviding the committee stage were got through in the time, additional\r\ndays for the report and third reading stages might be forthcoming.\r\nReasonable opportunity for making use of the closure was also asked. To\r\nLord Lytton's letter the Prime Minister replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _My dear Lytton_--In reply to your letter on the subject of the\r\n     Women's Enfranchisement Bill, I would refer you to some\r\n     observations recently made in a speech at the National Liberal Club\r\n     by Sir Edward Grey, which accurately expresses the intention of the\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     It follows (to answer your specific inquiries), that the \"week\"\r\n     offered will be interpreted with reasonable elasticity, that the\r\n     Government will interpose no reasonable obstacle to the proper use\r\n     of the closure, and that if (as you suggest) the bill gets through\r\n     committee in the time proposed, the extra days required for report\r\n     and third reading will not be refused.\r\n\r\n     The Government, though divided in opinion on the merits of the\r\n     bill, are unanimous in their determination to give effect, not only\r\n     in the letter but in the spirit, to the promise in regard to\r\n     facilities which I made on their behalf before the last general\r\n     election.\r\n                        Yours etc.,\r\n                                  H. H. ASQUITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSceptical up to this point, the W. S. P. U. was now convinced that the\r\nGovernment were sincere in their promise to give the bill full\r\nfacilities in the following year. We held a joyful mass meeting in\r\nQueen's Hall and I again declared that warfare against the Government\r\nwas at an end. Our new policy was the inauguration of a great holiday\r\ncampaign, with the object of making victory in 1912 absolutely certain.\r\nElectors must be aroused, members of Parliament held to their\r\nallegiance. Women must be organised in order that questions that vitally\r\naffect the social welfare of the country might be placed before them. I\r\nchose Scotland and Wales as the scenes of my holiday labours.\r\n\r\nI may say that our confidence was fully shared by the public at large.\r\nThe belief in Mr. Asquith's pledge was accurately reflected in a leader\r\npublished in _The Nation_, which said: \"From the moment the Prime\r\nMinister signed the frank and ungrudging letter to Lord Lytton which\r\nappeared in last Saturday's newspapers, women became, in all but the\r\nlegal formality, voters and citizens. For at least two years, if not for\r\nlonger, nothing has been lacking save a full and fair opportunity for\r\nthe House of Commons to translate its convictions into the precise\r\nlanguage of a statute. That opportunity has been promised for next\r\nsession and promised in terms and under conditions which ensure\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nThe only thing, as we thought, that we had to fear were wrecking\r\namendments to the bill, and in the new by-election policy which we\r\nadopted we worked against all candidates of every party who would refuse\r\nto promise, not only to support the Conciliation Committee to carry the\r\nbill, but also to vote against any amendment the committee thought\r\ndangerous. We believed that we had covered every possibility of\r\ndisaster. But we had something yet to learn of the treachery of the\r\nAsquith Ministry and their capacity for cold-blooded lying.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd-George from the first was an open enemy of the bill, but since\r\nwe had no doubt of the sincerity of the Prime Minister, we could only\r\nconclude that Mr. Lloyd-George had detached himself from the main body\r\nof the Government and had become the self-constituted leader of the\r\nopposition. In an address to a large Liberal group Mr. Lloyd-George\r\nadvised that Liberal members be asked to ballot for a place for a\r\n\"democratic measure,\" in order that such a measure might claim the Prime\r\nMinister's pledge for facilities next session. In one or two other\r\nspeeches he made vague allusions to the possibilities of introducing\r\nanother suffrage bill. His own idea was to amend the bill to give a vote\r\nto wives of all electors--making married women voters in virtue of their\r\nhusband's qualification. The inevitable effect of such an amendment\r\nwould be to wreck the bill, since it would have enfranchised about\r\n6,000,000 women in addition to the million and a half who would benefit\r\nby the original terms of the bill. Such a wholesale addition to the\r\nelectorate was never known in England; the number enfranchised by the\r\nReform Bill of 1832 being hardly more than half a million. The Reform\r\nBill of 1867 admitted a million new voters, and that of 1884 perhaps two\r\nmillions. The absurdity of Mr. Lloyd-George's proposition was such that\r\nwe did not regard it seriously. We did not allow his opposition to give\r\nus serious alarm until a day in August when a Welsh member, Mr. Leif\r\nJones, asked the Prime Minister from the floor of the House, whether he\r\nwas aware that his promise for facilities for the Conciliation Bill in\r\nthe next session was being claimed exclusively for that bill, and asked\r\nfurther for a statement that the promised facilities would be equally\r\ngranted to any other suffrage bill that might secure a second reading\r\nand was capable of amendment. Mr. Lloyd-George, speaking for the\r\nGovernment, replied that they could not undertake to give facilities to\r\nmore than one bill on the same subject, but that any bill which,\r\nsatisfying these tests, secured a second reading, would be treated by\r\nthem as falling within their engagements.\r\n\r\nAstounded at this plain evasion of a sacred promise, Lord Lytton again\r\nwrote to the Prime Minister, reviewing the entire matter, and asking for\r\nanother statement of the Government's intentions. The following is the\r\ntext of Mr. Asquith's reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n     _My dear Lytton_--I have no hesitation in saying that the promises\r\n     made by, and on behalf of the Government, in regard to giving\r\n     facilities to the Conciliation Bill, will be strictly adhered to,\r\n     both in letter and in spirit.\r\n                                            Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                H. H. ASQUITH.\r\n     August 23, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain we were reassured, and our confidence in the Premier's pledge\r\nremained unshaken throughout the campaign, although Mr. Lloyd-George\r\ncontinued to throw out hints that the promises of facilities for the\r\nbill were altogether illusory. We could not believe him, and when, two\r\nmonths later, I was asked in America: \"When will English women vote?\" I\r\nreplied with perfect conviction, \"Next year.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in Louisville, Kentucky, where I attended the 1911 Annual\r\nConvention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nI remember this third visit to the United States with especial\r\npleasure. I was the guest in New York of Dr. and Mrs. John Winters\r\nBrannan, and through the courtesy of Dr. Brannan, who is at the head of\r\nall the city hospitals, I saw something of the penal system and the\r\ninstitutional life of America. We visited the workhouse and the\r\npenitentiary on Blackwell's Island, and although I am told that these\r\nplaces are not regarded as model institutions, I can assure my readers\r\nthat they are infinitely superior to the English prisons where women are\r\npunished for trying to win their political freedom. In the American\r\nprisons, much as they lacked in some essentials, I saw no solitary\r\nconfinement, no rule of silence, no deadly air of officialdom. The food\r\nwas good and varied, and above all there was an air of kindness and good\r\nfeeling between the officials and the prisoners that is almost wholly\r\nlacking in England.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, in the United States as in other countries, the problem\r\nof the relations between unfranchised women and the State remains\r\nunsolved and unsatisfactory. One night my friends took me to that sombre\r\nand terrible institution, the Night Court for Women. We sat on the bench\r\nwith the magistrate, and he very courteously explained everything to us.\r\nThe whole business was heart-breaking. All the women, with one\r\nexception--an old drunkard--were charged with solicitation. Most of them\r\nwere of high type by nature. It all seemed so hopeless, and it was clear\r\nthat they were victims of an evil system. Their conviction was a\r\nforegone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate said that in most cases the reason for their coming\r\nthere was economic. One case of a little cigar maker, who said very\r\nsimply that she only went on the streets when out of work, and that when\r\nin work she earned $8 a week, was very tragic and touching. I could not\r\nkeep the Night Court out of my speeches after that. The whole dreadful\r\ninjustice of women's lives seemed mirrored in that place.\r\n\r\nI went as far west as the Pacific Coast on this visit, spending\r\nChristmas day in Seattle, and for the first time seeing a community\r\nwhere women and men existed on terms of exact equality. It was a\r\ndelightful experience. As I wrote home to our members, the men of the\r\nwestern States seemed to my eyes eager, earnest, rough men, building a\r\ngreat community in a great hurry, but never have I seen greater respect,\r\ncourtesy and chivalry shown to women than in that one Suffrage State it\r\nhas been my privilege to visit.\r\n\r\nI am getting a little ahead of my story, however. It was in November,\r\nwhen I was in the city of Minneapolis, that a crushing blow descended on\r\nthe English suffragists. I learned of this through cabled despatches in\r\nthe newspapers and from private cables, and was so staggered that I\r\ncould scarcely command myself sufficiently to fill my immediate\r\nengagements. This was the news, that the Government had broken their\r\nplighted word and had deliberately destroyed the Conciliation Bill. My\r\nfirst wild thought, on hearing of this act of treachery, was to cancel\r\nall engagements and return to England, but my final decision to remain\r\nafterwards proved the right one, because the women at home, without a\r\nmoment's loss of time, struck the answering blow, guided by that\r\ninsight which has been characteristic of every act of the members of our\r\nUnion. I did not return to England until January 11, 1912, and by that\r\ntime great deeds had been done. Our movement had entered upon a new and\r\nmore vigorous stage of militancy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] Lady Constance Lytton's story has been thrillingly told in her book\r\n\"Prisons and Prisoners,\" Heinemann.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN'S REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament had reassembled on October 25th, 1911, and the first move on\r\nthe part of the Government was, to say the least of it, rather\r\nunpropitious. The Prime Minister submitted two motions, the first one\r\nempowering them to take all the time of the House during the remainder\r\nof the session, and the second guillotining discussion on the Insurance\r\nBill so as to force the measure through before Christmas. One day only\r\nwas allotted to the clauses relating to women in that bill. These\r\nclauses were notoriously unfair; they provided for sickness insurance of\r\nabout four million women and unemployment insurance of no women at all.\r\nUnder the provision of the bill eleven million men were ensured against\r\nsickness and about two and a half million against unemployment. Women\r\nwere given lower benefits for the same premium as men, and premiums paid\r\nout of the family income were credited solely to the men's account. The\r\nbill as drafted provided no form of insurance for wives, mothers and\r\ndaughters who spent their lives at home working for the family. It\r\npenalised women for staying in the home, which most men agree is women's\r\nonly legitimate sphere of action. The amended bill grudgingly allowed\r\naside from maternity benefits, a small insurance, on rather difficult\r\nterms, for workingmen's wives.\r\n\r\nThus the re-elected Government's first utterance to women was one of\r\ncontempt; and this was followed, on November 7th, by the almost\r\nincredible announcement that the Government intended, at the next\r\nsession, to introduce a manhood suffrage bill. This announcement was not\r\nmade in the House of Commons, but to a deputation of men from the\r\nPeople's Suffrage Federation, a small group of people who advocated\r\nuniversal adult suffrage. The deputation, which was very privately\r\narranged for, was received by Mr. Asquith, and the then Master of\r\nElibank (Chief Liberal Whip). The spokesman asked Mr. Asquith to bring\r\nin a Government measure for universal adult suffrage, including adult\r\nwomen. The Prime Minister replied that the Government had pledged\r\nfacilities for the Conciliation Bill, which was as far as they were\r\nprepared to go in the matter of women's suffrage. But, he added, the\r\nGovernment intended in the next session to introduce and to pass through\r\nall its stages a genuine reform bill which would sweep away existing\r\nqualifications for the franchise, and substitute a single qualification\r\nof residence. The bill would apply to adult males only, but it would be\r\nso framed as to be open to a woman suffrage amendment in case the House\r\nof Commons desired to make that extension and amendment.\r\n\r\nThis portentous announcement came like a bolt from the blue, and there\r\nwas strong condemnation of the Government's treachery to women. Said the\r\n_Saturday Review_:\r\n\r\n\r\n     With absolutely no demand, no ghost of a demand, for more votes\r\n     for men, and with--beyond all cavil--a very strong demand for votes\r\n     for women, the Government announce their Manhood Suffrage Bill and\r\n     carefully evade the other question! For a naked, avowed plan of\r\n     gerrymandering no Government surely ever did beat this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Mail_ said that the \"policy which Mr. Asquith proposes is\r\nabsolutely indefensible.\" And the _Evening Standard and Globe_ said: \"We\r\nare no friends of female suffrage, but anything more contemptible than\r\nthe attitude assumed by the Government it is difficult to imagine.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Government hoped to deceive any one by their dishonest reference\r\nto the possibility of a woman suffrage amendment, they were\r\ndisappointed. Said the _Evening News_:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Asquith's bombshell will blow the Conciliation Bill to\r\n     smithereens, for it is impossible to have a manhood suffrage for\r\n     men and a property qualification for women. True, the Premier\r\n     consents to leave the question of women's suffrage to the House,\r\n     but he knows well enough what the decision of the House will be.\r\n     The Conciliation Bill had a chance, but the larger measure has none\r\n     at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have quoted these newspaper leaders to show you that our opinion of\r\nthe Government's action was shared even by the press. Universal suffrage\r\nin a country where women are in a majority of one million is not likely\r\nto happen in the lifetime of any reader of this volume, and the\r\nGovernment's generous offer of a possible amendment was nothing more\r\nthan a gratuitous insult to the suffragists.\r\n\r\nThe truce, naturally, came to an abrupt end. The W. S. P. U. wrote to\r\nthe Prime Minister, saying that consternation had been aroused by the\r\nGovernment's announcement, and that it had been decided accordingly to\r\nsend a deputation representing the Women's Social and Political Union to\r\nwait upon himself and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the evening of\r\nNovember 21st. The purpose of the deputation was to demand that the\r\nproposed manhood suffrage bill be abandoned, and that in its place\r\nshould be introduced a Government measure giving equal franchise rights\r\nto men and women. A similar letter was despatched to Mr. Lloyd-George.\r\n\r\nSix times before on occasions of crisis had the W. S. P. U. requested an\r\ninterview with Mr. Asquith, and each time they had been refused. This\r\ntime the Prime Minister replied that he had decided to receive a\r\ndeputation of the various suffrage societies on November 17th,\r\n\"including your own society, if you desire it.\" It was proposed that\r\neach society appoint four representatives as members of the deputation\r\nwhich would be received by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer.\r\n\r\nNine suffrage societies sent representatives to the meeting, our own\r\nrepresentatives being Christabel Pankhurst, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, Miss\r\nAnnie Kenney, Lady Constance Lytton and Miss Elizabeth Robins.\r\nChristabel and Mrs. Lawrence spoke for the Union, and they did not\r\nhesitate to accuse the two Ministers to their faces of having grossly\r\ntricked and falsely misled women. Mr. Asquith, in his reply to the\r\ndeputation, resented these imputations.\r\n\r\nHe had kept his pledge, he insisted, in regard to the Conciliation\r\nBill. He was perfectly willing to give facilities to the Bill, if the\r\nwomen preferred that to an amendment to his reform bill. Moreover, he\r\ndenied that he had made any new announcement. As far back as 1908 he had\r\ndistinctly declared that the Government regarded it as a sacred duty to\r\nbring forward a manhood suffrage bill before that Parliament came to an\r\nend. It was true that the Government did not carry out that binding\r\nobligation, and it was also true that until the present time nothing\r\nmore was ever said about a manhood suffrage bill, but that was not the\r\nGovernment's fault. The crisis of the Lord's veto, had momentarily\r\ndisplaced the bill. Now he merely proposed to fulfil his promise made in\r\n1908, and also his promise about giving facilities to the Conciliation\r\nBill. He was ready to keep both promises. Well he knew that those\r\npromises were incompatible, that the fulfilment of both was therefore\r\nimpossible, and Christabel told him so bluntly and fearlessly. \"We are\r\nnot satisfied,\" she warned him, and the Prime Minister said acidly: \"I\r\ndid not expect to satisfy _you_.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of the W. S. P. U. was immediate and forceful. Led by Mrs.\r\nPethick Lawrence, our women went out with stones and hammers and broke\r\nhundreds of windows in the Home Office, the War and Foreign Offices, the\r\nBoard of Education, the Privy Council Office, the Board of Trade, the\r\nTreasury, Somerset House, the National Liberal Club, several post\r\noffices, the Old Banqueting Hall, the London and South Western Bank, and\r\na dozen other buildings, including the residence of Lord Haldane and\r\nMr. John Burns. Two hundred and twenty women were arrested and about 150\r\nof them sent to prison for terms varying from a week to two months.\r\n\r\nOne individual protest deserves mention because of its prophetic\r\ncharacter. In December Miss Emily Wilding Davison was arrested for\r\nattempting to set fire to a letter box at Parliament Street Post Office.\r\nIn court Miss Davison said that she did it as a protest against the\r\nGovernment's treachery, and as a demand that women's suffrage be\r\nincluded in the King's speech. \"The protest was meant to be serious,\"\r\nshe said, \"and so I adopted a serious course. In past agitation for\r\nreform the next step after window-breaking was incendiarism, in order to\r\ndraw the attention of the private citizens to the fact that this\r\nquestion of reform was their concern as well as that of women.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Davison received the severe sentence of six months' imprisonment\r\nfor her deed.\r\n\r\nTo this state of affairs I returned from my American tour. I had the\r\ncomfort of reflecting that my imprisoned comrades were being accorded\r\nbetter treatment than the early prisoners had known. Since early in 1910\r\nsome concessions had been granted, and some acknowledgment of the\r\npolitical character of our offences had been made. During the brief\r\nperiod when these scant concessions to justice were allowed, the hunger\r\nstrike was abandoned and prison was robbed of its worst horror, forcible\r\nfeeding. The situation was bad enough, however, and I could see that it\r\nmight easily become a great deal worse. We had reached a stage at which\r\nthe mere sympathy of members of Parliament, however sincerely felt, was\r\nno longer of the slightest use. Reminding our members this, in the first\r\nspeeches made after returning to England I asked them to prepare\r\nthemselves for more action. If women's suffrage was not included in the\r\nnext King's speech we should have to make it absolutely impossible for\r\nthe Government to touch the question of the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe King's speech, when Parliament met in February, 1912, alluded to the\r\nfranchise question in very general terms. Proposals, it was stated,\r\nwould be brought forward for the amendment of the law with respect to\r\nthe franchise and the registration of electors. This might be construed\r\nto mean that the Government were going to introduce a manhood suffrage\r\nbill or a bill for the abolition of plural voting, which had been\r\nsuggested in some quarters as a substitute for the manhood suffrage\r\nbill. No precise statement of the Government's intentions was made, and\r\nthe whole franchise question was left in a cloud of uncertainty. Mr. Agg\r\nGardner, a Unionist member of the Conciliation Committee, drew the third\r\nplace in the ballot, and he announced that he should reintroduce the\r\nConciliation Bill. This interested us very slightly, for knowing its\r\nprospect of success to have been destroyed, for we were done with the\r\nConciliation Bill forever. Nothing less than a Government measure would\r\nhenceforth satisfy the W. S. P. U., because it had been clearly\r\ndemonstrated that only a Government measure would be allowed to pass the\r\nHouse of Commons. With sublime faith, or rather with a deplorable lack\r\nof political insight, the Women's Liberal Federation and the National\r\nUnion of Women's Suffrage Societies professed full confidence in the\r\nproposed amendment to a manhood suffrage bill, but we knew how futile\r\nwas that hope. We saw that the only course to take was to offer\r\ndetermined opposition to any measure of suffrage that did not include as\r\nan integral part, equal suffrage for men and women.\r\n\r\nOn February 16th we held a large meeting of welcome to a number of\r\nreleased prisoners who had served two and three months for the window\r\nbreaking demonstration that had taken place in the previous November. At\r\nthis meeting we candidly surveyed the situation and agreed on a course\r\nof action which we believed would be sufficiently strong to prevent the\r\nGovernment from advancing their threatened franchise bill. I said on\r\nthis occasion:\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to use any weapons that are unnecessarily strong. If the\r\nargument of the stone, that time-honoured official political argument,\r\nis sufficient, then we will never use any stronger argument. And that is\r\nthe weapon and the argument that we are going to use next time. And so I\r\nsay to every volunteer on our demonstration, 'Be prepared to use that\r\nargument.' I am taking charge of the demonstration, and that is the\r\nargument I am going to use. I am not going to use it for any sentimental\r\nreason, I am going to use it because it is the easiest and the most\r\nreadily understood. Why should women go to Parliament Square and be\r\nbattered about and insulted, and most important of all, produce less\r\neffect than when we throw stones? We tried it long enough. We submitted\r\nfor years patiently to insult and assault. Women had their health\r\ninjured. Women lost their lives. We should not have minded if that had\r\nsucceeded, but that did not succeed, and we have made more progress with\r\nless hurt to ourselves by breaking glass than ever we made when we\r\nallowed them to break our bodies.\r\n\r\n\"After all, is not a woman's life, is not her health, are not her limbs\r\nmore valuable than panes of glass? There is no doubt of that, but most\r\nimportant of all, does not the breaking of glass produce more effect\r\nupon the Government? If you are fighting a battle, that should dictate\r\nyour choice of weapons. Well, then, we are going to try this time if\r\nmere stones will do it. I do not think it will ever be necessary for us\r\nto arm ourselves as Chinese women have done, but there are women who are\r\nprepared to do that if it should be necessary. In this Union we don't\r\nlose our heads. We only go as far as we are obliged to go in order to\r\nwin, and we are going forward with this next protest demonstration in\r\nfull faith that this plan of campaign, initiated by our friends whom we\r\nhonour to-night, will on this next occasion prove effective.\"\r\n\r\nEver since militancy took on the form of destruction of property the\r\npublic generally, both at home and abroad, has expressed curiosity as to\r\nthe logical connection between acts such as breaking windows, firing\r\npillar boxes, et cetera, and the vote. Only a complete lack of\r\nhistorical knowledge excuses that curiosity. For every advance of men's\r\npolitical freedom has been marked with violence and the destruction of\r\nproperty. Usually the advance has been marked by war, which is called\r\nglorious. Sometimes it has been marked by riotings, which are deemed\r\nless glorious but are at least effective. That speech of mine, just\r\nquoted, will probably strike the reader as one inciting to violence and\r\nillegal action, things as a rule and in ordinary circumstances quite\r\ninexcusable. Well, I will call the reader's attention to what was, in\r\nthis connection, a rather singular coincidence. At the very hour when I\r\nwas making that speech, advising my audience of the political necessity\r\nof physical revolt, a responsible member of the Government, in another\r\nhall, in another city, was telling his audience precisely the same\r\nthing. This Cabinet Minister, the right Honourable C. E. H. Hobhouse,\r\naddressing a large anti-suffrage meeting in his constituency of Bristol,\r\nsaid that the suffrage movement was not a political issue because its\r\nadherents had failed to prove that behind this movement existed a large\r\npublic demand. He declared that \"In the case of the suffrage demand\r\nthere has not been the kind of popular sentimental uprising which\r\naccounted for Nottingham Castle in 1832 or the Hyde Park railings in\r\n1867. There has not been a great ebullition of popular feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"popular sentimental uprising\" to which Mr. Hobhouse alluded was the\r\nburning to the ground of the castle of the anti-suffrage Duke of\r\nNewcastle, and of Colwick Castle, the country seat of another of the\r\nleaders of the opposition against the franchise bill. The militant men\r\nof that time did not select uninhabited buildings to be fired. They\r\nburned both these historic residences over their owners' heads. Indeed,\r\nthe wife of the owner of Colwick Castle died as a result of shock and\r\nexposure on that occasion. No arrests were made, no men imprisoned. On\r\nthe contrary the King sent for the Premier, and begged the Whig\r\nMinisters favourable to the franchise bill not to resign, and intimated\r\nthat this was also the wish of the Lords who had thrown out the bill.\r\nMolesworth's History of England says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     These declarations were imperatively called for. The danger was\r\n     imminent and the Ministers knew it and did all that lay in their\r\n     power to tranquillise the people, and to assure them that the bill\r\n     was only delayed and not finally defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time the people believed this, but soon they lost patience, and\r\nseeing signs of a renewed activity on the part of the anti-suffragists,\r\nthey became aggressive again. Bristol, the very city in which Mr.\r\nHobhouse made his speech, was set on fire. The militant reformers burned\r\nthe new gaol, the toll houses, the Bishop's Palace, both sides of\r\nQueen's Square, including the Mansion House, the custom house, the\r\nexcise office, many warehouses, and other private property, the whole\r\nvalued at over L100,000--five hundred thousand dollars. It was as a\r\nresult of such violence, and in fear of more violence, that the reform\r\nbill was hurried through Parliament and became law in June, 1832.\r\n\r\nOur demonstration, so mild by comparison with English men's political\r\nagitation, was announced for March 4th, and the announcement created\r\nmuch public alarm. Sir William Byles gave notice that he would \"ask the\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department whether his attention had\r\nbeen drawn to a speech by Mrs. Pankhurst last Friday night, openly and\r\nemphatically inciting her hearers to violent outrage and the destruction\r\nof property, and threatening the use of firearms if stones did not prove\r\nsufficiently effective; and what steps he proposes to take to protect\r\nSociety from this outbreak of lawlessness.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was duly asked, and the Home Secretary replied that his\r\nattention had been called to the speech, but that it would not be\r\ndesirable in the public interest to say more than this at present.\r\n\r\nWhatever preparations the police department were making to prevent the\r\ndemonstration, they failed because, while as usual, we were able to\r\ncalculate exactly what the police department were going to do, they were\r\nutterly unable to calculate what we were going to do. We had planned a\r\ndemonstration for March 4th, and this one we announced. We planned\r\nanother demonstration for March 1st, but this one we did not announce.\r\nLate in the afternoon of Friday, March 1st, I drove in a taxicab,\r\naccompanied by the Hon. Secretary of the Union, Mrs. Tuke and another of\r\nour members, to No. 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the\r\nPrime Minister. It was exactly half past five when we alighted from the\r\ncab and threw our stones, four of them, through the window panes. As we\r\nexpected we were promptly arrested and taken to Cannon Row police\r\nstation. The hour that followed will long be remembered in London. At\r\nintervals of fifteen minutes relays of women who had volunteered for the\r\ndemonstration did their work. The first smashing of glass occurred in\r\nthe Haymarket and Piccadilly, and greatly startled and alarmed both\r\npedestrians and police. A large number of the women were arrested, and\r\neverybody thought that this ended the affair. But before the excited\r\npopulace and the frustrated shop owners' first exclamation had died\r\ndown, before the police had reached the station with their prisoners,\r\nthe ominous crashing and splintering of plate glass began again, this\r\ntime along both sides of Regent Street and the Strand. A furious rush of\r\npolice and people towards the second scene of action ensued. While their\r\nattention was being taken up with occurrences in this quarter, the third\r\nrelay of women began breaking the windows in Oxford Circus and Bond\r\nStreet. The demonstration ended for the day at half past six with the\r\nbreaking of many windows in the Strand. The _Daily Mail_ gave this\r\ngraphic account of the demonstration:\r\n\r\n\r\n     From every part of the crowded and brilliantly lighted streets came\r\n     the crash of splintered glass. People started as a window shattered\r\n     at their side; suddenly there was another crash in front of them;\r\n     on the other side of the street; behind--everywhere. Scared shop\r\n     assistants came running out to the pavements; traffic stopped;\r\n     policemen sprang this way and that; five minutes later the streets\r\n     were a procession of excited groups, each surrounding a woman\r\n     wrecker being led in custody to the nearest police station.\r\n     Meanwhile the shopping quarter of London had plunged itself into a\r\n     sudden twilight. Shutters were hurriedly fitted; the rattle of iron\r\n     curtains being drawn came from every side. Guards of\r\n     commissionaires and shopmen were quickly mounted, and any\r\n     unaccompanied lady in sight, especially if she carried a hand bag,\r\n     became an object of menacing suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the hour when this demonstration was being made a conference was\r\nbeing held at Scotland Yard to determine what should be done to prevent\r\nthe smashing of windows on the coming Monday night. But we had not\r\nannounced the hour of our March 4th protest. I had in my speech simply\r\ninvited women to assemble in Parliament Square on the evening of March\r\n4th, and they accepted the invitation. Said the _Daily Telegraph_:\r\n\r\n\r\n     By six o'clock the neighbourhood Houses of Parliament were in a\r\n     stage of siege. Shop keepers in almost every instance barricaded\r\n     their premises, removed goods from the windows and prepared for the\r\n     worst. A few minutes before six o'clock a huge force of police,\r\n     amounting to nearly three thousand constables, was posted in\r\n     Parliament Square, Whitehall, and streets adjoining, and large\r\n     reserves were gathered in Westminster Hall and Scotland Yard. By\r\n     half past eight Whitehall was packed from end to end with police\r\n     and public. Mounted constables rode up and down Whitehall keeping\r\n     the people on the move. At no time was there any sign of danger....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demonstration had taken place in the morning, when a hundred or more\r\nwomen walked quietly into Knightsbridge and walking singly along the\r\nstreets demolished nearly every pane of glass they passed. Taken by\r\nsurprise the police arrested as many as they could reach, but most of\r\nthe women escaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARGUMENT OF THE BROKEN WINDOW PANE]\r\n\r\nFor that two days' work something like two hundred suffragettes were\r\ntaken to the various police stations, and for days the long procession\r\nof women streamed through the courts. The dismayed magistrates found\r\nthemselves facing, not only former rebels, but many new ones, in some\r\ncases, women whose names, like that of Dr. Ethel Smyth, the composer,\r\nwere famous throughout Europe. These women, when arraigned, made clear\r\nand lucid statements of their positions and their motives, but\r\nmagistrates are not schooled to examine motives. They are trained to\r\nthink only of laws and mostly of laws protecting property. Their ears\r\nare not tuned to listen to words like those spoken by one of the\r\nprisoners, who said: \"We have tried every means--processions and\r\nmeetings--which were of no avail. We have tried demonstrations, and now\r\nat last we have to break windows. I wish I had broken more. I am not in\r\nthe least repentant. Our women are working in far worse condition than\r\nthe striking miners. I have seen widows struggling to bring up their\r\nchildren. Only two out of every five are fit to be soldiers. What is the\r\ngood of a country like ours? England is absolutely on the wane. You only\r\nhave one point of view, and that is the men's, and while men have done\r\nthe best they could, they cannot go far without the women and the\r\nwomen's views. We believe the whole is in a muddle too horrible to think\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\nThe coal miners were at that time engaging in a terrible strike, and the\r\nGovernment, instead of arresting the leaders, were trying to come to\r\nterms of peace with them. I reminded the magistrate of this fact, and I\r\ntold him that what the women had done was but a fleabite by comparison\r\nwith the miners' violence. I said further: \"I hope our demonstration\r\nwill be enough to show the Government that the women's agitation is\r\ngoing on. If not, if you send me to prison, I will go further to show\r\nthat women who have to help pay the salaries of Cabinet Ministers, and\r\nyour salary too, sir, are going to have some voice in the making of the\r\nlaws they have to obey.\"\r\n\r\nI was sentenced to two months' imprisonment. Others received sentences\r\nranging from one week to two months, while those who were accused of\r\nbreaking glass above five pounds in value, were committed for trial in\r\nhigher courts. They were sent to prison on remand, and when the last of\r\nus were behind the grim gates, not only Holloway but three other women's\r\nprisons were taxed to provide for so many extra inmates.\r\n\r\nIt was a stormy imprisonment for most of us. A great many of the women\r\nhad received, in addition to their sentences, \"hard labour,\" and this\r\nmeant that the privileges at that time accorded to Suffragettes, as\r\npolitical offenders, were withheld. The women adopted the hunger strike\r\nas a protest, but as the hint was conveyed to me that the privileges\r\nwould be restored, I advised a cessation of the strike. The remand\r\nprisoners demanded that I be allowed to exercise with them, and when\r\nthis was not answered they broke the windows of their cells. The other\r\nsuffrage prisoners, hearing the sound of shattered glass, and the\r\nsinging of the Marseillaise, immediately broke their windows. The time\r\nhad long gone by when the Suffragettes submitted meekly to prison\r\ndiscipline. And so passed the first days of my imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panic stricken Government did not rest content with the imprisonment\r\nof the window breakers. They sought, in a blind and blundering fashion,\r\nto perform the impossible feat of wrecking at a blow the entire militant\r\nmovement. Governments have always tried to crush reform movements, to\r\ndestroy ideas, to kill the thing that cannot die. Without regard to\r\nhistory, which shows that no Government have ever succeeded in doing\r\nthis, they go on trying in the old, senseless way.\r\n\r\nFor days before the two demonstrations described in the last chapter our\r\nheadquarters in Clement's Inn had been under constant observation by the\r\npolice, and on the evening of March 5th an inspector of police and a\r\nlarge force of detectives suddenly descended on the place, with warrants\r\nfor the arrest of Christabel Pankhurst and Mr. and Mrs. Pethick\r\nLawrence, who with Mrs. Tuke and myself were charged with \"conspiring to\r\nincite certain persons to commit malicious damage to property.\" When the\r\nofficers entered they found Mr. Pethick Lawrence at work in his office,\r\nand Mrs. Pethick Lawrence in her flat upstairs. My daughter was not in\r\nthe building. The Lawrences, after making brief preparations drove in a\r\ntaxicab to Bow Street Station, where they spent the night. The police\r\nremained in possession of the offices, and detectives were despatched\r\nto find and arrest Christabel. But that arrest never took place.\r\nChristabel Pankhurst eluded the entire force of detectives and uniformed\r\npolice, trained hunters of human prey.\r\n\r\nChristabel had gone home, and at first, on hearing of the arrest of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, had taken her own arrest for granted. A\r\nlittle reflection however showed her the danger in which the Union would\r\nstand if completely deprived of its accustomed leadership, and seeing\r\nthat it was her duty to avoid arrest, she quietly left the house. She\r\nspent that night with friends who, next morning, helped her to make the\r\nnecessary arrangements and saw her safely away from London. The same\r\nnight she reached Paris, where she has since remained. My relief, when I\r\nlearned of her flight, was very great, because I knew that whatever\r\nhappened to the Lawrences and myself, the movement would be wisely\r\ndirected, this in spite of the fact that the police remained in full\r\npossession of headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe offices in Clement's Inn were thoroughly ransacked by the police, in\r\na determined effort to secure evidence of conspiracy. They went through\r\nevery desk, file and cabinet, taking away with them two cab loads of\r\nbooks and papers, including all my private papers, photographs of my\r\nchildren in infancy, and letters sent me by my husband long ago. Some of\r\nthese I never saw again.\r\n\r\nThe police also terrorised the printer of our weekly newspaper, and\r\nalthough the paper came out as usual, about a third of its columns were\r\nleft blank. The headlines, however, with the ensuing space mere white\r\npaper produced a most dramatic effect. \"History Teaches\" read one\r\nheadline to a blank space, plainly indicating that the Government were\r\nnot willing to let the public know some of the things that history\r\nteaches. \"Women's Moderation\" suggested that the destroyed paragraph\r\ncalled for comparison of the women's window breaking with men's greater\r\nviolence in the past. Most eloquent of all was the editorial page,\r\nabsolutely blank except for the headline, \"A Challenge!\" and the name at\r\nthe foot of the last column, Christabel Pankhurst. What words could have\r\nbreathed a prouder defiance, a more implacable resolve? Christabel was\r\ngone, out of the clutches of the Government, yet she remained in\r\ncomplete possession of the field. For weeks the search for her went\r\nrelentlessly on. Police searched every railway station, every train,\r\nevery sea port. The police of every city in the Kingdom were furnished\r\nwith her portrait. Every amateur Sherlock Holmes in England joined with\r\nthe police in finding her. She was reported in a dozen cities, including\r\nNew York. But all the time she was living quietly in Paris, in daily\r\ncommunication with the workers in London, who within a few days were\r\nonce more at their appointed tasks. My daughter has remained in France\r\never since.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I found myself in the anomalous position of a convicted\r\noffender serving two months' prison sentence, and of a prisoner on\r\nremand waiting to be charged with a more serious offence. I was in very\r\nbad health, having been placed in a damp and unwarmed third division\r\ncell, the result being an acute attack of bronchitis. I addressed a\r\nletter to the Home Secretary, telling him of my condition, and urging\r\nthe necessity of liberty to recover my health and to prepare my case for\r\ntrial. I asked for release on bail, the plain right of a remand\r\nprisoner, and I offered if bail were granted now to serve the rest of my\r\ntwo months' sentence later on. The sole concessions granted me, however,\r\nwere removal to a better cell and the right to see my secretary and my\r\nsolicitor, but only in the presence of a wardress and a member of the\r\nprison clerical staff. On March 14th Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, Mrs.\r\nTuke and myself were brought up for preliminary hearing on the charge of\r\nhaving, on November 1, 1911, and on various other dates \"conspired and\r\ncombined together unlawfully and maliciously to commit damage, etc.\" The\r\ncase opened on March 14th in a crowded courtroom in which I saw many\r\nfriends. Mr. Bodkin, who appeared for the prosecution, made a very long\r\naddress, in which he endeavoured to prove that the Women's Social and\r\nPolitical Union was a highly developed organisation of most sinister\r\ncharacter. He produced much documentary evidence, some of it of such\r\namusing character that the court rocked with stifled laughter, and the\r\njudge was obliged to conceal his smiles behind his hand. Mr. Bodkin\r\ncited our code book with the assistance of which we were able to\r\ncommunicate private messages. His voice sank to a scandalised half\r\nwhisper as he stated the fact that we had presumed to include the sacred\r\npersons of the Government in our private code. \"We find,\" said Mr.\r\nBodkin portentously, \"that public men in the service of His Majesty as\r\nmembers of the Cabinet are tabulated here under code names. We find that\r\nthe Cabinet collectively has its code word \"Trees,\" and individual\r\nmembers of the Cabinet are designated by the name, sometimes of trees,\r\nbut I am also bound to say the commonest weeds as well.\" Here a ripple\r\nof laughter interrupted. Mr. Bodkin frowned heavily, and continued:\r\n\"There is one,\" he said solemnly, \"called Pansy; another one--more\r\ncomplimentary--Roses, another, Violets, and so on.\" Each of the\r\ndefendants was designated by a code letter. Thus Mrs. Pankhurst was\r\nidentified by the letter F; Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, D; Miss Christabel\r\nPankhurst, E. Every public building, including the House of Commons, had\r\nits code name. The deadly possibilities of the code were illustrated by\r\na telegram found in one of the files. It read: \"Silk, thistle, pansy,\r\nduck, wool, E. Q.\" Translated by the aid of the code book the telegram\r\nread: \"Will you protest Asquith's public meeting to-morrow evening but\r\ndon't get arrested unless success depends on it. Wire back to Christabel\r\nPankhurst, Clements Inn.\"\r\n\r\nMore laughter followed these revelations, which after all proved no more\r\nthan the business-like methods employed by the W. S. P. U. The laughter\r\nproved something a great deal more significant, for it was a plain\r\nindication that the old respect in which Cabinet Ministers had been held\r\nwas no more. We had torn the veil from their sacro-sanct personalities\r\nand shown them for what they were, mean and scheming politicians. More\r\nserious from the point of view of prosecution was the evidence brought\r\nin by members of the police department in regard to the occurrences of\r\nMarch 1st and 4th. The policemen who arrested me and my two companions\r\nin Downing Street on March 1st, after we had broken the windows in the\r\nPremier's house, testified that following the arrest, we had handed him\r\nour reserve stock of stones, and that they were all alike, heavy flints.\r\nOther prisoners were found in possession of similar stones, tending to\r\nprove that the stones all came from one source. Other officers testified\r\nto the methodical manner in which the window breaking of March 1st and\r\n4th was carried out, how systematically it had been planned and how\r\nsoldierly had been the behaviour of the women. By twos and threes March\r\n4th they had been seen to go to the headquarters at Clement's Inn,\r\ncarrying handbags, which they deposited at headquarters, and had then\r\ngone on to a meeting at the Pavillion Music Hall. The police attended\r\nthe meeting, which was the usual rally preceding a demonstration or a\r\ndeputation. At five o'clock the meeting adjourned and the women went\r\nout, as if to go home. The police observed that many of them, still in\r\ngroups of twos and threes, went to the Gardenia restaurant in Catherine\r\nStreet, Strand, a place where many Suffragette breakfasts and teas had\r\nbeen held. The police thought that about one hundred and fifty women\r\ncongregated there on March 4th. They remained until seven o'clock, and\r\nthen, under the watching eyes of the police, they sauntered out and\r\ndispersed. A few minutes later, when there was no reason to expect such\r\na thing, the noise was heard, in many streets, of wholesale window\r\nsmashing. The police authorities made much of the fact that the women\r\nwho had left their bags at headquarters and were afterwards arrested,\r\nwere bailed out that night by Mr. Pethick Lawrence. The similarity of\r\nthe stones used; the gathering of so many women in one building,\r\nprepared for arrest; the waiting at the Gardenia Restaurant; the\r\napparent dispersal; the simultaneous destruction in many localities of\r\nplate glass, and the bailing of prisoners by a person connected with the\r\nheadquarters mentioned, certainly showed a carefully worked out plan.\r\nOnly a public trial of the defendants could establish whether or not the\r\nplan was a conspiracy.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the Ministerial hearing, Mrs. Tuke, who had been in\r\nthe prison infirmary for twenty days and had to be attended in court by\r\na trained nurse, was admitted to bail. Mr. Pethick Lawrence made a\r\nstrong plea for bail for himself and his wife, pointing out that they\r\nhad been in prison on remand for two weeks and were entitled to bail. I\r\nalso demanded the privileges of a prisoner on remand. Both of these\r\npleas were denied by the court, but a few days later the Home Secretary\r\nwrote to my solicitor that the remainder of my sentence of two months\r\nwould be remitted until after the conspiracy trail at Bow Street. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Pethick Lawrence had already been admitted to bail. Public\r\nopinion forced the Home Secretary to make these concessions, as it is\r\nwell known that it is next to impossible to prepare a defence while\r\nconfined in prison. Aside from the terrible effect of prison on one's\r\nbody and nerves, there is the difficulty of consulting documents and\r\nsecuring other necessary data to be considered.\r\n\r\nOn April 4th the Ministerial hearing ended in the acquittal of Mrs.\r\nTuke, whose activities in the W. S. P. U. were shown to be purely\r\nsecretarial. Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and myself were committed for\r\ntrial at the next session of the Central Criminal Court, beginning April\r\n23rd. Because of the weak state of my health the judge was with great\r\ndifficulty prevailed upon to postpone the trial two weeks and it was,\r\ntherefore, not until May 15th that the case was opened.\r\n\r\nThe trial at Old Bailey is a thing that I shall never forget. The scene\r\nis clear before me as I write, the judge impressively bewigged and\r\nscarlet robed, dominating the crowded courtroom, the solicitors at their\r\ntable, the jury, and looking very far away, the anxious pale faces of\r\nour friends who crowded the narrow galleries.\r\n\r\nBy the veriest irony of fate this judge, Lord Coleridge, was the son of\r\nSir Charles Coleridge who, in the year 1867, appeared with my husband,\r\nDr. Pankhurst, in the famous case of Chorlton v. Lings, and sought to\r\nestablish that women were persons, and as such were entitled to the\r\nParliamentary vote. To make the irony still deeper the Attorney General,\r\nSir Rufus Isaacs, who appeared as Counsel for the prosecution against\r\nwomen militants, himself had been guilty of remarkable speeches in\r\ncorroboration of our point of view. In a speech made in 1910, in\r\nrelation to the abolition of the Lords' veto, Sir Rufus made the\r\nstatement that, although the agitation against privilege was being\r\npeacefully conducted, the indignation behind it was very intense. Said\r\nSir Rufus: \"Formerly when the great mass of the people were voteless\r\nthey had to do something violent in order to show what they felt; to-day\r\nthe elector's bullet is his ballot. Let no one be deceived, therefore,\r\nbecause in this present struggle everything is peaceful and orderly, in\r\ncontrast to the disorderliness of other great struggles of the past.\" We\r\nwondered if the man who said these words could fail to realise that\r\nvoteless women, deprived of every constitutional means of righting their\r\ngrievances, were also obliged to do something violent in order to show\r\nhow they felt. His opening address removed all doubt on that score.\r\n\r\nSir Rufus Isaacs has a clear-cut, hawk-like face, deep eyes, and a\r\nsomewhat world worn air. The first words he spoke were so astoundingly\r\nunfair that I could hardly believe that I heard them aright. He began\r\nhis address to the jury by telling them that they must not, on any\r\naccount, connect the act of the defendants with any political agitation.\r\n\r\n\"I am very anxious to impress upon you,\" he said, \"from the moment we\r\nbegin to deal with the facts of this case, that all questions of whether\r\na woman is entitled to the Parliamentary franchise, whether she should\r\nhave the same right of franchise as a man, are questions which are in no\r\nsense involved in the trial of this issue.... Therefore, I ask you to\r\ndiscard altogether from the consideration of the matters which will be\r\nplaced before you any viewpoint you may have on this no doubt very\r\nimportant political issue.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless Sir Rufus added in the course of his remarks that he feared\r\nthat it would not be possible to keep out of the conduct of the case\r\nvarious references to political events, and of course the entire trial,\r\nfrom beginning to end, showed clearly that the case was what Mr. Tim\r\nHealey, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence's counsel, called it, a great State Trial.\r\n\r\nProceeding, the Attorney General described the W. S. P. U., which he\r\nsaid he thought had been in existence since 1907, and had used what were\r\nknown as militant methods. In 1911 the association had become annoyed by\r\nthe Prime Minister because he would not make women's suffrage what was\r\ncalled a Government question. In November, 1911, the Prime Minister\r\nannounced the introduction of a manhood suffrage bill. From that time on\r\nthe defendants set to work to carry out a campaign which would have\r\nmeant nothing less than anarchy. Women were to be induced to act\r\ntogether at a given time, in different given places, in such numbers\r\nthat the police should be paralysed by the number of persons breaking\r\nthe law, in order, to use the defendant's own words, \"to bring the\r\nGovernment to its knees.\"\r\n\r\nAfter designating the respective positions held by the four defendants\r\nin the W. S. P. U., Sir Rufus went on to relate the events which\r\nresulted in the smashing of plate glass windows valued at some two\r\nthousand pounds, and the imprisonment of over two hundred women who\r\nwere incited to their deeds by the conspirators in the dock. He entirely\r\nignored the motive of the acts in question, and he treated the whole\r\naffair as if the women had been burglars. This inverted statement of the\r\nmatter, though accurate enough as to facts, was such as might have been\r\ngiven by King John of the signing of Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nA very great number of witnesses were examined, a large number of them\r\nbeing policemen, and their testimony, and our cross examination\r\ndisclosed the startling fact that there exists in England a special band\r\nof secret police entirely engaged in political work. These men,\r\nseventy-five in number, form what is known as the political branch of\r\nthe Criminal Investigation Department of the Police. They go about in\r\ndisguise, and their sole duty is to shadow Suffragettes and other\r\npolitical workers. They follow certain political workers from their\r\nhomes to their places of business, to their social pleasures, into tea\r\nrooms and restaurants, even to the theatre. They pursue unsuspecting\r\npeople in taxicabs, sit beside them in omnibuses. Above all they take\r\ndown speeches. In fact the system is exactly like the secret police\r\nsystem of Russia.\r\n\r\nMr. Pethick Lawrence and I spoke in our own defence, and Mr. Healey M.\r\nP. defended Mrs. Pethick Lawrence. I cannot give our speeches in full,\r\nbut I should like to include as much of them as will serve to make the\r\nentire situation clear to the reader.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence spoke first at the opening of the case. He began by giving\r\nan account of the suffrage movement and why he felt the enfranchisement\r\nof women appeared to him a question so grave that it warranted strong\r\nmeasures in its pursuit. He sketched briefly the history of the Women's\r\nSocial and Political Union, from the time when Christabel Pankhurst and\r\nAnnie Kenney were thrown out of Sir Edward Grey's meeting and imprisoned\r\nfor asking a political question, to the torpedoing of the Conciliation\r\nBill. \"The case that I have to put before you,\" he said, \"is that\r\nneither the conspiracy nor the incitement is ours; but that the\r\nconspiracy is a conspiracy of the Cabinet who are responsible for the\r\nGovernment of this country; and that the incitement is the incitement of\r\nthe Ministers of the Crown.\" And he did this most effectually not only\r\nby telling of the disgraceful trickery and deceit with which the\r\nGovernment had misled the suffragists in the matter of suffrage bills,\r\nbut by giving the plain words in which members of the Cabinet had\r\nadvised the women that they would never get the vote until they had\r\nlearned to fight for it as men had fought in the past.\r\n\r\nWhen it came my turn to speak, realising that the average man is\r\nprofoundly ignorant of the history of the women's movement--because the\r\npress has never adequately or truthfully chronicled the movement--I told\r\nthe jury, as briefly as I could, the story of the forty years' peaceful\r\nagitation before my daughters and I resolved that we would give our\r\nlives to the work of getting the vote for women, and that we should use\r\nwhatever means of getting the vote that were necessary to success.\r\n\r\n\"We founded the Women's Social and Political Union,\" I said, \"in 1903.\r\nOur first intention was to try and influence the particular political\r\nParty, which was then coming into power, to make this question of the\r\nenfranchisement of women their own question and to push it. It took some\r\nlittle time to convince us--and I need not weary you with the history of\r\nall that has happened--but it took some little time to convince us that\r\nthat was no use; that we could not secure things in that way. Then in\r\n1905 we faced the hard facts. We realised that there was a Press boycott\r\nagainst Women's Suffrage. Our speeches at public meetings were not\r\nreported, our letters to the editors, were not published, even if we\r\nimplored the editors; even the things relating to Women's Suffrage in\r\nParliament were not recorded. They said the subject was not of\r\nsufficient public interest to be reported in the Press, and they were\r\nnot prepared to report it. Then with regard to the men politicians in\r\n1905: we realised how shadowy were the fine phrases about democracy,\r\nabout human equality, used by the gentlemen who were then coming into\r\npower. They meant to ignore the women--there was no doubt whatever about\r\nthat. For in the official documents coming from the Liberal party on the\r\neve of the 1905 election, there were sentences like this: 'What the\r\ncountry wants is a simple measure of Manhood Suffrage.' There was no\r\nroom for the inclusion of women. We knew perfectly well that if there\r\nwas to be franchise reform at all, the Liberal party which was then\r\ncoming into power did not mean Votes for Women, in spite of all the\r\npledges of members; in spite of the fact that a majority of the House\r\nof Commons, especially on the Liberal side, were pledged to it--it did\r\nnot mean that they were going to put it into practice. And so we found\r\nsome way of forcing their attention to this question.\r\n\r\n\"Now I come to the facts with regard to militancy. We realised that the\r\nplans we had in our minds would involve great sacrifice on our part,\r\nthat it might cost us all we had. We were at that time a little\r\norganisation, composed in the main of working women, the wives and\r\ndaughters of working men. And my daughters and I took a leading part,\r\nnaturally, because we thought the thing out, and, to a certain extent,\r\nbecause we were of better social position than most of our members, and\r\nwe felt a sense of responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nI described the events that marked the first days of our work, the scene\r\nin Free Trade Hall, Manchester, when my daughter and her companion were\r\narrested for the crime of asking a question of a politician, and I\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"What did they do next? (I want you to realise that no step we have\r\ntaken forward has been taken until after some act of repression on the\r\npart of our enemy, the Government--because it is the Government that is\r\nour enemy; it is not the Members of Parliament, it is not the men in the\r\ncountry; it is the Government in power alone that can give us the vote.\r\nIt is the Government alone that we regard as our enemy, and the whole of\r\nour agitation is directed to bringing just as much pressure as necessary\r\nupon those people who can deal with our grievance.) The next step the\r\nwomen took was to ask questions during the course of meetings, because,\r\nas I told you, these gentlemen gave them no opportunity of asking them\r\nafterwards. And then began the interjections of which we have heard, the\r\ninterference with the right to hold public meetings, the interference\r\nwith the right of free speech, of which we have heard, for which these\r\nwomen, these hooligan women, as they have been called--have been\r\ndenounced. I ask you, gentlemen, to imagine the amount of courage which\r\nit needs for a woman to undertake that kind of work. When men come to\r\ninterrupt women's meetings, they come in gangs, with noisy instruments,\r\nand sing and shout together, and stamp their feet. But when women have\r\ngone to Cabinet Ministers' meetings--only to interrupt Cabinet Ministers\r\nand nobody else--they have gone singly. And it has become increasingly\r\ndifficult for them to get in, because as a result of the women's methods\r\nthere has developed the system of admission by ticket and the exclusion\r\nof women--a thing which in my Liberal days would have been thought a\r\nvery disgraceful thing at Liberal meetings. But this ticket system\r\ndeveloped, and so the women could only get in with very great\r\ndifficulty. Women have concealed themselves for thirty-six hours in\r\ndangerous positions, under the platforms, in the organs, wherever they\r\ncould get a vantage point. They waited starving in the cold, sometimes\r\non the roof exposed to a winter's night, just to get a chance of saying\r\nin the course of a Cabinet Minister's speech, 'When is the Liberal\r\nGovernment going to put its promises into practice?' That has been the\r\nform militancy took in its further development.\"\r\n\r\nI went over the whole matter of our peaceful deputations, and of the\r\nviolence with which they were invariably met; of our arrests and the\r\nfarcical police court trials, where the mere evidence of policemen's\r\nunsupported statements sent us to prison for long terms; of the\r\nfalsehoods told of us in the House of Commons by responsible members of\r\nthe Government--tales of women scratching and biting policemen and using\r\nhatpins--and I accused the Government of making these attacks against\r\nwomen who were powerless to defend themselves because they feared the\r\nwomen and desired to crush the agitation represented by our\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\"Now it has been stated in this Court,\" I said, \"that it is not the\r\nWomen's Social and Political Union that is in the Court, but that it is\r\ncertain defendants. The action of the Government, gentlemen, is\r\ncertainly against the defendants who are before you here to-day, but it\r\nis also against the Women's Social and Political Union. The intention is\r\nto crush that organisation. And this intention apparently was arrived at\r\nafter I had been sent to prison for two months for breaking a pane of\r\nglass worth, I am told, 2s. 3d., the punishment which I accepted because\r\nI was a leader of this movement, though it was an extraordinary\r\npunishment to inflict for so small an act of damages as I had committed.\r\nI accepted it as the punishment for a leader of an agitation\r\ndisagreeable to the Government; and while I was there this prosecution\r\nstarted. They thought they would make a clean sweep of the people who\r\nthey considered were the political brains of the movement. We have got\r\nmany false friends in the Cabinet--people who by their words appear to\r\nbe well-meaning towards the cause of Women's Suffrage. And they thought\r\nthat if they could get the leaders of the Union out of the way, it would\r\nresult in the indefinite postponement and settlement of the question in\r\nthis country. Well, they have not succeeded in their design, and even if\r\nthey had got all the so-called leaders of this movement out of their way\r\nthey would not have succeeded even then. Now why have they not put the\r\nUnion in the dock? We have a democratic Government, so-called. This\r\nWomen's Social and Political Union is not a collection of hysterical and\r\nunimportant wild women, as has been suggested to you, but it is an\r\nimportant organisation, which numbers amongst its membership very\r\nimportant people. It is composed of women of all classes of the\r\ncommunity, women who have influence in their particular organisations as\r\nworking women; women who have influence in professional organisations as\r\nprofessional women; women of social importance; women even of Royal rank\r\nare amongst the members of this organisation, and so it would not pay a\r\ndemocratic Government to deal with this organisation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\"They hoped that by taking away the people that they thought guided the\r\npolitical fortunes of the organisation they would break the organisation\r\ndown. They thought that if they put out of the way the influential\r\nmembers of the organisation they, as one member of the Cabinet, I\r\nbelieve, said, would crush the movement and get it 'on the run.' Well,\r\nGovernments have many times been mistaken, gentlemen, and I venture to\r\nsuggest to you that Governments are mistaken again. I think the answer\r\nto the Government was given at the Albert Hall meeting held immediately\r\nafter our arrest. Within a few minutes, without the eloquence of Mrs.\r\nPethick Lawrence, without the appeals of the people who have been called\r\nthe leaders of this movement, in a very few minutes L10,000 was\r\nsubscribed for the carrying on of this movement.\r\n\r\n\"Now a movement like that, supported like that, is not a wild,\r\nhysterical movement. It is not a movement of misguided people. It is a\r\nvery serious movement. Women, I submit, like our members, and women, I\r\nventure to say, like the two women, and like the man who are in the dock\r\nto-day, are not people to undertake a thing like this lightly. May I\r\njust try to make you feel what it is that has made this movement the\r\ngigantic size it is from the very small beginnings it had? It is one of\r\nthe biggest movements of modern times. A movement which is not only an\r\ninfluence, perhaps not yet recognised, in this country, but is\r\ninfluencing the women's movement all over the world. Is there anything\r\nmore marvellous in modern times than the kind of spontaneous outburst in\r\nevery country of this woman's movement? Even in China--and I think it\r\nsomewhat of a disgrace to Englishmen--even in China women have won the\r\nvote, as an outcome of a successful revolution, with which, I dare say,\r\nmembers of his Majesty's Government sympathise--a bloody revolution.\r\n\r\n\"One more word on that point. When I was in prison the second time, for\r\nthree months as a common criminal for no greater offence than the issue\r\nof a handbill--less inflammatory in its terms than some of the speeches\r\nof members of the Government who prosecute us here--during that time,\r\nthrough the efforts of a member of Parliament, there was secured for me\r\npermission to have the daily paper in prison, and the first thing I read\r\nin the daily Press was this: that the Government was at that moment\r\nfeting the members of the Young Turkish Revolutionary Party, gentlemen\r\nwho had invaded the privacy of the Sultan's home--we used to hear a\r\ngreat deal about invading the privacy of Mr. Asquith's residence when we\r\nventured to ring his door bell--gentlemen who had killed and slain, and\r\nhad been successful in their revolution, while we women had never thrown\r\na stone--for none of us was imprisoned for stone throwing, but merely\r\nfor taking the part we had then taken in this organisation. There we\r\nwere imprisoned while these political murderers were being feted by the\r\nvery Government who imprisoned us, and were being congratulated on the\r\nsuccess of their revolution. Now I ask you, was it to be wondered at\r\nthat women said to themselves: 'Perhaps it is that we have not done\r\nenough. Perhaps it is that these gentlemen do not understand womenfolk.\r\nPerhaps they do not realise women's ways, and because we have not done\r\nthe things that men have done, they may think we are not in earnest.'\r\n\r\n\"And then we come down to this last business of all, when we have\r\nresponsible statesmen like Mr. Hobhouse saying that there had never been\r\nany sentimental uprising, no expression of feeling like that which led\r\nto the burning down of Nottingham Castle. Can you wonder, then, that we\r\ndecided we should have to nerve ourselves to do more, and can you\r\nunderstand why we cast about to find a way, as women will, that would\r\nnot involve loss of human life and the maiming of human beings, because\r\nwomen care more about human life than men, and I think it is quite\r\nnatural that we should, for we know what life costs. We risk our lives\r\nwhen men are born. Now, I want to say this deliberately as a leader of\r\nthis movement. We have tried to hold it back, we have tried to keep it\r\nfrom going beyond bounds, and I have never felt a prouder woman than I\r\ndid one night when a police constable said to me, after one of these\r\ndemonstrations, 'Had this been a man's demonstration, there would have\r\nbeen bloodshed long ago.' Well, my lord, there has not been any\r\nbloodshed except on the part of the women themselves--these so-called\r\nmilitant women. Violence has been done to us, and I who stand before you\r\nin this dock have lost a dear sister in the course of this agitation.\r\nShe died within three days of coming out of prison, a little more than a\r\nyear ago. These are things which, wherever we are, we do not say very\r\nmuch about. We cannot keep cheery, we cannot keep cheerful, we cannot\r\nkeep the right kind of spirit, which means success, if we dwell too much\r\nupon the hard part of our agitation. But I do say this, gentlemen, that\r\nwhatever in future you may think of us, you will say this about us, that\r\nwhatever our enemies may say, we have always put up an honourable\r\nfight, and taken no unfair means of defeating our opponents, although\r\nthey have not always been people who have acted so honourably towards\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"We have assaulted no one; we have done no hurt to any one; and it was\r\nnot until 'Black Friday'--and what happened on 'Black Friday' is that we\r\nhad a new Home Secretary, and there appeared to be new orders given to\r\nthe police, because the police on that occasion showed a kind of\r\nferocity in dealing with the women that they had never done before, and\r\nthe women came to us and said: 'We cannot bear this'--it was not until\r\nthen we felt this new form of repression should compel us to take\r\nanother step. That is the question of 'Black Friday,' and I want to say\r\nhere and now that every effort was made after 'Black Friday' to get an\r\nopen public judicial inquiry into the doings of 'Black Friday,' as to\r\nthe instructions given to the police. That inquiry was refused; but an\r\ninformal inquiry was held by a man, whose name will carry conviction as\r\nto his status and moral integrity on the one side of the great political\r\nparties, and a man of equal standing on the Liberal side. These two men\r\nwere Lord Robert Cecil and Mr. Ellis Griffith. They held a private\r\ninquiry, had women before them, took their evidence, examined that\r\nevidence, and after hearing it said that they believed what the women\r\nhad told them was substantially true, and that they thought there was\r\ngood cause for that inquiry to be held. That was embodied in a report.\r\nTo show you our difficulties, Lord Robert Cecil, in a speech at the\r\nCriterion Restaurant, spoke on this question. He called upon the\r\nGovernment to hold this inquiry, and not one word of that speech was\r\nreported in any morning paper. That is the sort of thing we have had to\r\nface, and I welcome standing here, if only for the purpose of getting\r\nthese facts out, and I challenge the Attorney General to institute an\r\ninquiry into these proceedings--not that kind of inquiry of sending\r\ntheir inspectors to Holloway and accepting what they are told by the\r\nofficials--but to open a public inquiry, with a jury, if he likes, to\r\ndeal with our grievances against the Government and the methods of this\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"I say it is not the defendants who have conspired, but the Government\r\nwho have conspired against us to crush this agitation; but however the\r\nmatter may be decided, we are content to abide by the verdict of\r\nposterity. We are not the kind of people who like to brag a lot; we are\r\nnot the kind of people who would bring ourselves into this position\r\nunless we were convinced that it was the only way. I have tried--all my\r\nlife I have worked for this question--I have tried arguments, I have\r\ntried persuasion. I have addressed a greater number of public meetings,\r\nperhaps, than any person in this court, and I have never addressed one\r\nmeeting where substantially the opinion of the meeting--not a ticket\r\nmeeting, but an open meeting, for I have never addressed any other kind\r\nof a meeting--has not been that where women bear burdens and share\r\nresponsibilities like men they should be given the privileges that men\r\nenjoy. I am convinced that public opinion is with us--that it has been\r\nstifled--wilfully stifled--so that in a public Court of Justice one is\r\nglad of being allowed to speak on this question.\"\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General's summing up for the prosecution was very largely a\r\ndefence of the Liberal Party and its course in regard to woman suffrage\r\nlegislation. Therefore, Mr. Tim Healey, in his defence of Mrs. Pethick\r\nLawrence, did well to lay stress on the political character of the\r\nconspiracy charge and trial. He said:\r\n\r\n\"It is no doubt a very useful thing when you have political opponents to\r\nbe able to set the law in motion against them. I have not the smallest\r\ndoubt it would be a very convenient thing, if they had the courage to do\r\nit, to shut up the whole of His Majesty's Opposition while the present\r\nGovernment is in office--to lock up all the men of lustre and\r\ndistinction in our public forum and on our public platforms--all the\r\nCarsons, F. E. Smiths, Bonar Laws, and so on. It would be a most\r\nconvenient thing to end the whole thing, as it would be to end women's\r\nagitation in the form of the indictment. Gentlemen of the jury, whatever\r\nwords have been spoken by mutual opponents, whatever instructions have\r\nbeen addressed, not to feeble females, but to men who boast of drilling\r\nand of arms, they have not had the courage to prosecute anybody, except\r\nwomen, by means of an indictment. Yet the Government of my learned\r\nfriend have selected two dates as cardinal dates, and they ask you to\r\npass judgment upon the prisoners at the bar, and to say that, without\r\nrhyme or reason, taking the course suggested without provocation, these\r\nresponsible, well-bred, educated, University people, have suddenly, in\r\nthe words of the indictment, wickedly and with malice aforethought\r\nengaged in these criminal designs.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, the first thing I would ask in that connection\r\nis this: What is there in the course of this demand put forward by women\r\nwhich should have excited the treatment at the hands of His Majesty's\r\nMinisters which this movement, according to the documents which are in\r\nevidence before me, has received? I should suppose that the essence of\r\nall government is the smooth conduct of affairs, so that those who enjoy\r\nhigh station, great emoluments, should not be parties against whom the\r\naccusation of provoking civic strife and breeding public turmoil should\r\nbe brought. What do we find? We find that, in regard to the treatment of\r\nthe demand which had always been put forward humbly, respectably,\r\nrespectfully, in its origin, by those who have received trade unionists,\r\nanti-vaccinators, deceased wife's sisters, and all other forms of\r\npolitical demand, and who have received them humbly and yielded to them,\r\nwe find that when these people advocating this particular form of civic\r\nreform request an audience, request admission, request even to have\r\ntheir petitions respectfully received, they have met, judicially, at all\r\nevents, with a flat and solemn negative. That is the beginning of this\r\nunhappy spirit bred in the minds of persons like the defendants, persons\r\nlike those against whom evidence has been tendered--which has led to\r\nyour being empanelled in that box to-day. And I put it to you when you\r\nare considering whether it is the incitement of my clients or the\r\nconduct of Ministers that have led to these events--whether I cannot ask\r\nyou to say that even a fair apportionment of blame should not rest upon\r\nmore responsible shoulders, and whether you should go out of your way to\r\nsay that these persons in the dock alone are guilty.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing Mr. Healey reverted to the political character of the trial.\r\n\"The Government have undertaken this prosecution,\" he declared, \"to\r\nseclude for a considerable period their chief opponents. They hope there\r\nwill be at public meetings which they attend no more inconvenient cries\r\nof 'Votes for Women.' I cannot conceive any other object which they\r\ncould have in bringing the prosecution. I have expressed my regret at\r\nthe loss which the shopkeepers, tradesmen and others have suffered. I\r\nregret it deeply. I regret that any person should bring loss or\r\nsuffering upon innocent people. But I ask you to say that the law has\r\nalready been sufficiently vindicated by the punishment of the immediate\r\nauthors of the deed. What can be gained? Does justice gain?\r\n\r\n\"I almost hesitate to treat this as a legal inquiry. I regard it as a\r\nvindictive political act. Of all the astonishing acts that have ever\r\nbeen brought into a public court against a prisoner I cannot help\r\nfeeling the charge against Mr. Pethick Lawrence is the most astonishing.\r\nHe ventured to attend at some police courts and gave bail for women who\r\nhad been arrested in endeavouring, as I understand, to present petitions\r\nto Parliament or to have resort to violence. I do not complain of the\r\nway in which my learned friend has conducted the prosecution, but I do\r\ncomplain of the police methods--inquiring into the homes and the\r\ndomestic circumstances of the prisoners, obtaining their papers, taking\r\ntheir newspaper, going into their banking account, bringing up their\r\nbankers here to say what is their balance; and I do say that in none of\r\nthe prosecutions of the past have smaller methods belittled a great\r\nState trial, because, look at it as you will, you cannot get away from\r\nit that this is a great State trial. It is not the women who are on\r\ntrial. It is the men. It is the system of Government which is upon its\r\ntrial. It is this method of rolling the dice by fifty-four counts in an\r\nindictment without showing to what any bit of evidence is fairly\r\nattributable; the system is on its trial--a system whereby every\r\ninnocent act in public life is sought to be enmeshed in a conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury was absent for more than an hour, showing that they had some\r\ndifficulty in agreeing upon a verdict. When they returned it was plain\r\nfrom their strained countenances that they were labouring under deep\r\nfeeling. The foreman's voice shook as he pronounced the verdict, guilty\r\nas charged, and he had hard work to control his emotion as he added:\r\n\"Your Lordship, we unanimously desire to express the hope that, taking\r\ninto consideration the undoubtedly pure motives that underlie the\r\nagitation that has led to this trouble, you will be pleased to exercise\r\nthe utmost clemency and leniency in dealing with the case.\"\r\n\r\nA burst of applause followed this plea. Then Mr. Pethick Lawrence arose\r\nand asked to say a few words before sentence was pronounced. He said\r\nthat it must be evident, aside from the jury's recommendation, that we\r\nhad been actuated by political motives, and that we were in fact\r\npolitical offenders. It had been decided in English Courts that\r\npolitical offenders were different from ordinary offenders, and Mr.\r\nLawrence cited the case of a Swiss subject whose extradition was refused\r\nbecause of the political character of his offence. The Court on that\r\noccasion had declared that even if the crime were murder committed with\r\na political motive it was a political crime. Mr. Lawrence also reminded\r\nthe judge of the case of the late Mr. W. T. Stead, convicted of a crime,\r\nyet because of the unusual motive behind the crime, was allowed first\r\ndivision treatment and full freedom to receive his family and friends.\r\nLast of all the case of Dr. Jameson was cited. Although his raid\r\nresulted in the death of twenty-one persons and the wounding of\r\nforty-six more, the political character of his offence was taken into\r\naccount and he was made a first division prisoner.\r\n\r\nThey were men, fighting in a man's war. We of the W. S. P. U. were\r\nwomen, fighting in a woman's war. Lord Coleridge, therefore, saw in us\r\nonly reckless and criminal defiers of law. Lord Coleridge said: \"You\r\nhave been convicted of a crime for which the law would sanction, if I\r\nchose to impose it, a sentence of two years' imprisonment with hard\r\nlabour. There are circumstances connected with your case which the jury\r\nhave very properly brought to my attention, and I have been asked by you\r\nall three to treat you as first class misdemeanants. If, in the course\r\nof this case, I had observed any contrition or disavowal of the acts\r\nyou have committed, or any hope that you would avoid repetition of them\r\nin future, I should have been very much prevailed upon by the arguments\r\nthat have been advanced to me.\"\r\n\r\nNo contrition having been expressed by us, the sentence of the Court was\r\nthat we were to suffer imprisonment, in the second division, for the\r\nterm of nine months, and that we were to pay the costs of the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sentence of nine months astonished us beyond measure, especially in\r\nview of certain very recent events, one of these being the case of some\r\nsailors who had mutinied in order to call attention to something which\r\nthey considered a peril to themselves and to all seafarers. They were\r\ntried and found technically guilty, but because of the motive behind\r\ntheir mutiny, were discharged without punishment. Perhaps more nearly\r\nlike our case than this was the case of the labour leader, Tom Mann,\r\nwho, shortly before, had written a pamphlet calling upon His Majesty's\r\nsoldiers not to fire upon strikers when commanded to do so by their\r\nsuperior officers. From the Government's point of view this was a much\r\nmore serious kind of inciting than ours, because if it had been\r\nresponded to the authorities would have been absolutely crippled in\r\nmaintaining order. Besides, soldiers who refuse to obey orders are\r\nliable to the death penalty. Tom Mann was given a sentence of six\r\nmonths, but this was received, on the part of the Liberal Press and\r\nLiberal politicians, with so much clamour and protest that the prisoner\r\nwas released at the end of two months. So, even on our way to prison, we\r\ntold one another that our sentences could not stand. Public opinion\r\nwould never permit the Government to keep us in prison for nine months,\r\nor in the second division for any part of our term. We agreed to wait\r\nseven Parliamentary days before we began a hunger strike protest.\r\n\r\nIt was very dreary waiting, those seven Parliamentary days, because we\r\ncould not know what was happening outside, or what was being talked of\r\nin the House. We could know nothing of the protests and memorials that\r\nwere pouring in, on our behalf, from Oxford and Cambridge Universities,\r\nfrom members of learned societies, and from distinguished men and women\r\nof all professions, not only in England but in every country of Europe,\r\nfrom the United States and Canada, and even from India. An international\r\nmemorial asking that we be treated as political prisoners was signed by\r\nsuch great men and women as Prof. Paul Milyoukoff, leader of the\r\nConstitutional Democrats in the Duma; Signor Enrico Ferri, of the\r\nItalian Chamber of Deputies; Edward Bernstein, of the German Reichstag;\r\nGeorge Brandes, Edward Westermarck, Madame Curie, Ellen Key, Maurice\r\nMaeterlinck, and many others. The greatest indignation was expressed in\r\nthe House, Keir Hardie and Mr. George Lansbury leading in the demand for\r\na drastic revision of our sentences and our immediate transference to\r\nthe first division. So much pressure was brought to bear that within a\r\nfew days the Home Secretary announced that he felt it his duty to\r\nexamine into the circumstances of the case without delay. He explained\r\nthat the prisoners had not at any time been forced to wear prison\r\nclothes. Ultimately, which in this case means shortly before the\r\nexpiration of the seven Parliamentary days, we were all three placed in\r\nthe first division. Mrs. Pethick Lawrence was given the cell formerly\r\noccupied by Dr. Jameson and I had the cell adjoining. Mr. Pethick\r\nLawrence, in Brixton Gaol, was similarly accommodated. We all had the\r\nprivilege of furnishing our cells with comfortable chairs, tables, our\r\nown bedding, towels, and so on. We had meals sent in from the outside;\r\nwe wore our own clothing and had what books, newspapers and writing\r\nmaterials we required. We were not permitted to write or receive letters\r\nor to see our friends except in the ordinary two weeks' routine. Still\r\nwe had gained our point that suffrage prisoners were politicals.\r\n\r\nWe had gained it, but, as it turned out, only for ourselves. When we\r\nmade the inquiry, \"Are all our women now transferred to the first\r\ndivision?\" the answer was that the order for transference referred only\r\nto Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and myself. Needless to say, we\r\nimmediately refused to accept this unfair advantage, and after we had\r\nexhausted every means in our power to induce the Home Secretary to give\r\nthe other suffrage prisoners the same justice that we had received, we\r\nadopted the protest of the hunger strike. The word flew swiftly through\r\nHolloway, and in some mysterious way travelled to Brixton, to Aylesbury,\r\nand Winson Green, and at once all the other suffrage prisoners followed\r\nour lead. The Government then had over eighty hunger strikers on their\r\nhands, and, as before, had ready only the argument of force, which means\r\nthat disgusting and cruel process of forcible feeding. Holloway became a\r\nplace of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place\r\nalmost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell\r\nperforming their hideous office. One of the men did his work in such\r\nbrutal fashion that the very sight of him provoked cries of horror and\r\nanguish. I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced\r\nduring the days when those cries were ringing in my ears. In her frenzy\r\nof pain one woman threw herself from the gallery on which her cell\r\nopened. A wire netting eight feet below broke her fall to the iron\r\nstaircase beneath, else she must inevitably have been killed. As it was\r\nshe was frightfully hurt.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale hunger strike created a tremendous stir throughout\r\nEngland, and every day in the House the Ministers were harassed with\r\nquestions. The climax was reached on the third or fourth day of the\r\nstrike, when a stormy scene took place in the House of Commons. The\r\nUnder Home Secretary, Mr. Ellis Griffith, had been mercilessly\r\nquestioned as to conditions under which the forcible feeding was being\r\ndone, and as soon as this was over one of the suffragist members made a\r\nmoving appeal to the Prime Minister himself to order the release of all\r\nthe prisoners. Mr. Asquith, forced against his will to take part in the\r\ncontroversy, rose and said that it was not for him to interfere with the\r\nactions of his colleague, Mr. McKenna, and he added, in his own suave,\r\nmendacious manner: \"I must point out this, that there is not one single\r\nprisoner who cannot go out of prison this afternoon on giving the\r\nundertaking asked for by the Home Secretary.\" Meaning an undertaking to\r\nrefrain henceforth from militancy.\r\n\r\nInstantly Mr. George Lansbury sprang to his feet and exclaimed: \"You\r\nknow they cannot! It is perfectly disgraceful that the Prime Minister of\r\nEngland should make such a statement.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith glanced carelessly at the indignant Lansbury, but sank into\r\nhis seat without deigning to reply. Shocked to the depths of his soul by\r\nthe insult thrown at our women, Mr. Lansbury strode up to the\r\nMinisterial bench and confronted the Prime Minister, saying again: \"That\r\nwas a disgraceful thing for you to say, Sir. You are beneath contempt,\r\nyou and your colleagues. You call yourselves gentlemen, and you forcibly\r\nfeed and murder women in this fashion. You ought to be driven out of\r\noffice. Talk about protesting. It is the most disgraceful thing that\r\never happened in the history of England. You will go down to history as\r\nthe men who tortured innocent women.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the House was seething, and the indignant Labour member had\r\nto shout at the top of his big voice in order to be heard over the din.\r\nMr. Asquith's pompous order that Mr. Lansbury leave the House for the\r\nday was probably known to very few until it appeared in print next day.\r\nAt all events Mr. Lansbury continued his protest for five minutes\r\nlonger. \"You murder, torture and drive women mad,\" he cried, \"and then\r\nyou tell them they can walk out. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\r\nYou talk about principle--you talk about fighting in Ulster--you, too--\"\r\nturning to the Unionist benches--\"You ought to be driven out of public\r\nlife. These women are showing you what principle is. You ought to\r\nhonour them for standing up for their womanhood. I tell you, Commons of\r\nEngland, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe Speaker came to Mr. Asquith's rescue at last and adjured Mr.\r\nLansbury that he must obey the Prime Minister's order to leave the\r\nHouse, saying that such disorderly conduct would cause the House to lose\r\nrespect. \"Sir,\" exclaimed Mr. Lansbury, in a final burst of righteous\r\nrage, \"it has lost it already.\"\r\n\r\nThis unprecedented explosion of wrath and scorn against the Government\r\nwas the sensation of the hour, and it was felt on all sides that the\r\nrelease of the prisoners, or at least cessation of forcible feeding,\r\nwhich amounted to the same thing, would be ordered. Every day the\r\nSuffragettes marched in great crowds to Holloway, serenading the\r\nprisoners and holding protest meetings to immense crowds. The music and\r\nthe cheering, faintly wafted to our straining ears, was inexpressibly\r\nsweet. Yet it was while listening to one of these serenades that the\r\nmost dreadful moment of my imprisonment occurred. I was lying in bed,\r\nvery weak from starvation, when I heard a sudden scream from Mrs.\r\nLawrence's cell, then the sound of a prolonged and very violent\r\nstruggle, and I knew that they had dared to carry their brutal business\r\nto our doors. I sprang out of bed and, shaking with weakness and with\r\nanger, I set my back against the wall and waited for what might come. In\r\na few moments they had finished with Mrs. Lawrence and had flung open\r\nthe door of my cell. On the threshold I saw the doctors, and back of\r\nthem a large group of wardresses. \"Mrs. Pankhurst,\" began the doctor.\r\nInstantly I caught up a heavy earthenware water jug from a table hard\r\nby, and with hands that now felt no weakness I swung the jug head high.\r\n\r\n\"If any of you dares so much as to take one step inside this cell I\r\nshall defend myself,\" I cried. Nobody moved or spoke for a few seconds,\r\nand then the doctor confusedly muttered something about to-morrow\r\nmorning doing as well, and they all retreated.\r\n\r\nI demanded to be admitted to Mrs. Lawrence's cell, where I found my\r\ncompanion in a desperate state. She is a strong woman, and a very\r\ndetermined one, and it had required the united strength of nine\r\nwardresses to overcome her. They had rushed into the cell without any\r\nwarning, and had seized her unawares, else they might not have succeeded\r\nat all. As it was she resisted so violently that the doctors could not\r\napply the stethoscope, and they had very great difficulty in getting the\r\ntube down. After the wretched affair was over Mrs. Lawrence fainted, and\r\nfor hours afterwards was very ill.\r\n\r\nThis was the last attempt made to forcibly feed either Mrs. Lawrence or\r\nmyself, and two days later we were ordered released on medical grounds.\r\nThe other hunger strikers were released in batches, as every day a few\r\nmore triumphant rebels approached the point where the Government stood\r\nin danger of committing actual murder. Mr. Lawrence, who was forcibly\r\nfed twice a day for more than ten days, was released in a state of\r\ncomplete collapse on July 1st. Within a few days after that the last of\r\nthe prisoners were at liberty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was sufficiently recovered I went to Paris and had the joy\r\nof seeing again my daughter Christabel, who, during all the days of\r\nstrife and misery, had kept her personal anxiety in the background and\r\nhad kept staunchly at her work of leadership. The absence of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Pethick Lawrence had thrown the entire responsibility of the\r\neditorship of our paper, _Votes for Women_, on her shoulders, but as she\r\nhas invariably risen to meet new responsibility, she conducted the paper\r\nwith skill and discretion.\r\n\r\nWe had much to talk about and to consider, because it was evident that\r\nmilitancy, instead of being dropped, as the other suffrage societies\r\nwere constantly suggesting, must go on very much more vigorously than\r\nbefore. The struggle had been too long drawn out. We had to seek ways to\r\nshorten it, to bring it to such a climax that the Government would\r\nacknowledge that something had to be done. We had already demonstrated\r\nthat our forces were impregnable. We could not be conquered, we could\r\nnot be terrified, we could not even be kept in prison. Therefore, since\r\nthe Government had their war lost in advance, our task was merely to\r\nhasten the surrender.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Parliament, as far as the suffrage question was\r\nconcerned, was clean swept and barren. The third Conciliation Bill had\r\nfailed to pass its second reading, the majority against it being\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nMany Liberal members were afraid to vote for the bill because Mr.\r\nLloyd-George and Mr. Lewis Harcourt had persistently spread the rumour\r\nthat its passage, at that time, would result in splitting the Cabinet.\r\nThe Irish Nationalist members had become hostile to the bill because\r\ntheir leader, Mr. Redmond, was an anti-suffragist, and had refused to\r\ninclude a woman suffrage clause in the Home Rule Bill. Our erstwhile\r\nfriends, the Labour members, were so apathetic, or so fearful for\r\ncertain of their own measures, that most of them stayed away from the\r\nHouse on the day the bill reached its second reading. So it was lost,\r\nand the Militants were blamed for its loss! In June the Government\r\nannounced that Mr. Asquith's manhood suffrage bill would soon be\r\nintroduced, and very soon after this the bill did appear. It simplified\r\nthe registration machinery, reduced the qualifying period of residence\r\nto six months, and abolished property qualifications, plural voting and\r\nUniversity representation. In a word, it gave the Parliamentary\r\nfranchise to every man above the age of twenty-one and it denied it to\r\nall women. Never in the history of the suffrage movement had such an\r\naffront been offered to women, and never in the history of England had\r\nsuch a blow been aimed at women's liberties. It is true that the Prime\r\nMinister had pledged himself to introduce a bill capable of being\r\namended to include women's suffrage, and to permit any amendment that\r\npassed its second reading to become a part of the bill. But we had no\r\nfaith in an amendment, nor in any bill that was not from its inception\r\nan official Government measure. Mr. Asquith had broken every pledge he\r\nhad ever made the women, and this new pledge impressed us not at all.\r\nWell we knew that he had given it only to cover his treachery in\r\ntorpedoing the Conciliation Bill, and in the hope of placating the\r\nsuffragists, perhaps securing another truce to militancy.\r\n\r\nIf this last was his hope he was most grievously disappointed. Signs\r\nwere constantly appearing to indicate that women would no longer be\r\ncontented with the symbolic militancy involved in window breaking. For\r\nexample, traces were found in the Home Secretary's office at Whitehall\r\nof an attempt at arson. On the doorstep of another Cabinet Minister\r\nsimilar traces were found. Had the Government acted upon these warnings,\r\nby giving women the vote, all the serious acts of militancy that have\r\noccurred since would have been averted. But like the heart of Pharaoh,\r\nthe heart of the Government hardened, and militant acts followed one\r\nanother in rapid succession. In July the W. S. P. U. issued a manifesto\r\nwhich set forth our intentions in that regard. The manifesto read in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The leaders of the Women's Social and Political Union have so often\r\nwarned the Government that unless the vote were granted to women in\r\nresponse to the mild militancy of the past, a fiercer spirit of revolt\r\nwould be awakened which it would be impossible to control. The\r\nGovernment have blindly disregarded the warning, and now they are\r\nreaping the harvest of their unstatesmanlike folly.\"\r\n\r\nThis was issued immediately after a visit paid by Mr. Asquith to Dublin.\r\nThe occasion had been intended to be one of great pomp and circumstance,\r\na huge popular demonstration in honour of the sponsor of Home Rule, but\r\nthe Suffragettes turned it into the most lamentable fiasco imaginable.\r\nFrom the hour of Mr. Asquith's attempted secret departure from London\r\nuntil his return he lived and moved in momentary dread of Suffragettes.\r\nEvery time he entered or left a railway carriage or a steamer he was\r\nconfronted by women. Every time he rose to speak he was interrupted by\r\nwomen. Every public appearance he made was turned into a riot by women.\r\nAs he left Dublin a woman threw a hatchet into his motor car, without,\r\nhowever, doing him any injury. As a final protest against his reception\r\nby Irishmen, the Theatre Royal was set on fire by two women. The theatre\r\nwas practically empty at the time, the performance having been\r\ncompleted, and the damage done was comparatively small, yet the two\r\nwomen chiefly concerned, Mrs. Leigh and Miss Evans, were given the\r\nbarbarous sentences of five years each in prison. These were the first\r\nwomen sentenced to penal servitude in the history of our movement. Of\r\ncourse they did not serve their sentences. On entering Mountjoy Prison\r\nthey put in the usual claim for first division treatment, and this being\r\nrefused, they immediately adopted the hunger strike. A number of Irish\r\nSuffragettes were in Mountjoy at this time for a protest made against\r\nthe exclusion of women from the Home Rule Bill. They were in the first\r\ndivision, and they were almost on the eve of their release, but such is\r\nthe indomitable spirit of militancy that these women entered upon a\r\nsympathetic hunger strike. They were released, but the Government\r\nforbade the release of Mrs. Leigh and Miss Evans, that is, they ordered\r\nthe authorities to retain the women as long as they could, by forcible\r\nfeeding, be kept alive. After a struggle which, for fierceness and\r\ncruelty, is almost unparalleled in our annals, the two women fought\r\ntheir way out.\r\n\r\nAll during that summer militancy surged up and down throughout the\r\nKingdom. A series of attacks on golf links was instituted, not at all in\r\na spirit of wanton mischief, but with the direct and very practical\r\nobject of reminding the dull and self-satisfied English public that when\r\nthe liberties of English women were being stolen from them was no time\r\nto think of sports. The women selected country clubs where prominent\r\nLiberal politicians were wont to take their week-end pleasures, and with\r\nacids they burned great patches of turf, rendering the golf greens\r\nuseless for the time being. They burned the words, Votes for Women, in\r\nsome cases, and always they left behind them reminders that women were\r\nwarring for their freedom. On one occasion when the Court was at\r\nBalmoral Castle in Scotland, the Suffragettes invaded the Royal golf\r\nlinks, and when Sunday morning dawned all the marking flags were found\r\nto have been replaced by W. S. P. U. flags hearing inscriptions such as\r\n\"Votes for Women means peace for Ministers,\" \"Forcible feeding must be\r\nstopped,\" and the like. The golf links were frequently visited by\r\nSuffragettes in order to question recreant ministers. Two women followed\r\nthe Prime Minister to Inverness, where he was playing golf with Mr.\r\nMcKenna. Approaching the men one Suffragette exclaimed: \"Mr. Asquith,\r\nyou must stop forcible feeding--\" She got no farther, for Mr. Asquith,\r\nturning pale with rage--perhaps--retreated behind the Home Secretary,\r\nwho, quite forgetting his manners, seized the Suffragette, crying out\r\nthat he was going to throw her into the pond. \"Then we will take you\r\nwith us,\" the two retorted, after which a very lively scuffle ensued,\r\nand the women were not thrown into the pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUFFRAGETTE THROWING A BAG OF FLOUR AT MR. ASQUITH IN\r\nCHESTER]\r\n\r\nThis golf green activity really aroused more hostility against us than\r\nall the window-breaking. The papers published appeals to us not to\r\ninterfere with a game that helped weary politicians to think clearly,\r\nbut our reply to this was that it had not had any such effect on the\r\nPrime Minister or Mr. Lloyd-George. We had undertaken to spoil their\r\nsport and that of a large class of comfortable men in order that they\r\nshould be obliged to think clearly about women, and women's firm\r\ndetermination to get justice.\r\n\r\nI made my return to active work in the autumn by speaking at a great\r\nmeeting of the W. S. P. U., held in the Albert Hall. At that meeting I\r\nhad the announcement to make that the six years' association of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Pethick Lawrence with the W. S. P. U. had ended.\r\n\r\nSince personal dissensions have never been dwelt upon in the\r\nW. S. P. U., have never been allowed to halt the movement or to\r\ninterfere for an hour with its progress, I shall not here say any more\r\nabout this important dissension than I said at our first large meeting\r\nin Albert Hall after the holiday, on October 17th. That day a new paper\r\nwas sold on the streets. It was called _The Suffragette_, it was edited\r\nby Christabel Pankhurst, and was henceforth to be the official organ of\r\nthe Union. Both in this new paper and in _Votes for Women_, the\r\nfollowing announcement appeared:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GRAVE STATEMENT BY THE LEADERS\r\n\r\n     At the first reunion of the leaders after the enforced holiday,\r\n     Mrs. Pankhurst and Miss Christabel Pankhurst outlined a new\r\n     militant policy which Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence found\r\n     themselves altogether unable to approve.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Pankhurst and Miss Christabel Pankhurst indicated that they\r\n     were not prepared to modify their intentions, and recommended that\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence should resume control of the Paper,\r\n     _Votes for Women_, and should leave the Women's Social and\r\n     Political Union.\r\n\r\n     Rather than make schism in the ranks of the Union Mr. and Mrs.\r\n     Pethick Lawrence consented to take this course.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was signed by all four. That night at the meeting I further\r\nexplained to the members that, hard as partings from old friends and\r\ncomrades unquestionably were, we must remember that we were fighting in\r\nan army, and that unity of purpose and unity of policy are absolutely\r\nnecessary, because without them the army is hopelessly weakened. \"It is\r\nbetter,\" I said, \"that those who cannot agree, cannot see eye to eye as\r\nto policy, should set themselves free, should part, and should be free\r\nto continue their policy as they see it in their own way, unfettered by\r\nthose with whom they can no longer agree.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing I said: \"I give place to none in appreciation and gratitude\r\nto Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence for the incalculable services that they\r\nhave rendered the militant movement for Woman Suffrage, and I firmly\r\nbelieve that the women's movement will be strengthened by their being\r\nfree to work for woman suffrage in the future as they think best, while\r\nwe of the Women's Social and Political Union shall continue the militant\r\nagitation for Woman Suffrage initiated by my daughter and myself and a\r\nhandful of women more than six years ago.\"\r\n\r\nI then went on to survey the situation in which the W. S. P. U. now\r\nstood and to outline the new militant policy which he had decided upon.\r\nThis policy, to begin with, was relentless opposition, not only to the\r\nparty in power, the Liberal Party, but to all parties in the coalition.\r\nI reminded the women that the Government that had tricked and betrayed\r\nus and was now plotting to make our progress towards citizenship doubly\r\ndifficult, was kept in office through the coalition of three parties.\r\nThere was the Liberal Party, nominally the governing party, but they\r\ncould not live another day without the coalition of the Nationalist and\r\nthe Labour parties. So we should say, not only to the Liberal Party but\r\nto the Nationalist Party and the Labour Party, \"So long as you keep in\r\noffice an anti-suffrage Government, you are parties to their guilt, and\r\nfrom henceforth we offer you the same opposition which we give to the\r\npeople whom you are keeping in power with your support.\" I said further:\r\n\"We have summoned the Labour Party to do their duty by their own\r\nprogramme, and to go into opposition to the Government on every question\r\nuntil the Government do justice to women. They apparently are not\r\nwilling to do that. Some of them tell us that other things are more\r\nimportant than the liberty of women--than the liberty of working women.\r\nWe say, 'Then, gentlemen, we must teach you the value of your own\r\nprinciples, and until you are prepared to stand for the right of women\r\nto decide their lives and the laws under which they shall live, you,\r\nwith Mr. Asquith and company, are equally responsible for all that has\r\nhappened and is happening to women in this struggle for emancipation.'\"\r\n\r\nOutlining further our new and stronger policy of aggression, I said:\r\n\"There is a great deal of criticism, ladies and gentlemen, of this\r\nmovement. It always seems to me when the anti-suffrage members of the\r\nGovernment criticise militancy in women that it is very like beasts of\r\nprey reproaching the gentler animals who turn in desperate resistance\r\nwhen at the point of death. Criticism from gentlemen who do not hesitate\r\nto order out armies to kill and slay their opponents, who do not\r\nhesitate to encourage party mobs to attack defenceless women in public\r\nmeetings--criticism from them hardly rings true. Then I get letters from\r\npeople who tell me that they are ardent suffragists but who say that\r\nthey do not like the recent developments in the militant movement, and\r\nimplore me to urge the members not to be reckless with human life.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, the only recklessness the militant suffragists\r\nhave shown about human life has been about their own lives and not about\r\nthe lives of others, and I say here and now that it has never been and\r\nnever will be the policy of the Women's Social and Political Union\r\nrecklessly to endanger human life. We leave that to the enemy. We leave\r\nthat to the men in their warfare. It is not the method of women. No,\r\neven from the point of view of public policy, militancy affecting the\r\nsecurity of human life would be out of place. _There is something that\r\ngovernments care far more for than human life, and that is the security\r\nof property, and so it is through property that we shall strike the\r\nenemy._ From henceforward the women who agree with me will say, 'We\r\ndisregard your laws, gentlemen, we set the liberty and the dignity and\r\nthe welfare of women above all such considerations, and we shall\r\ncontinue this war, as we have done in the past; and what sacrifice of\r\nproperty, or what injury to property accrues will not be our fault. It\r\nwill be the fault of that Government who admit the justice of our\r\ndemands, but refuses to concede them without the evidence, so they have\r\ntold us, afforded to governments of the past, that those who asked for\r\nliberty were in earnest in their demands!\"\r\n\r\nI called upon the women of the meeting to join me in this new militancy,\r\nand I reminded them anew that the women who were fighting in the\r\nSuffragette army had a great mission, the greatest mission the world has\r\never known--the freeing of one-half the human race, and through that\r\nfreedom the saving of the other half. I said to them: \"Be militant each\r\nin your own way. Those of you who can express your militancy by going to\r\nthe House of Commons and refusing to leave without satisfaction, as we\r\ndid in the early days--do so. Those of you who can express militancy by\r\nfacing party mobs at Cabinet Ministers' meetings, when you remind them\r\nof their falseness to principle--do so. Those of you who can express\r\nyour militancy by joining us in our anti-Government by-election\r\npolicy--do so. Those of you who can break windows--break them. Those of\r\nyou who can still further attack the secret idol of property, so as to\r\nmake the Government realise that property is as greatly endangered by\r\nwomen's suffrage as it was by the Chartists of old--do so. And my last\r\nword is to the Government: I incite this meeting to rebellion. I say to\r\nthe Government: You have not dared to take the leaders of Ulster for\r\ntheir incitement to rebellion. Take me if you dare, but if you dare I\r\ntell you this, that so long as those who incited to armed rebellion and\r\nthe destruction of human life in Ulster are at liberty, you will not\r\nkeep me in prison. So long as men rebels--and voters--are at liberty,\r\nwe will not remain in prison, first division or no first division.\"\r\n\r\nI ask my readers, some of whom no doubt will be shocked and displeased\r\nat these words of mine that I have so frankly set down, to put\r\nthemselves in the place of those women who for years had given their\r\nlives entirely and unstintingly to the work of securing political\r\nfreedom for women; who had converted so great a proportion of the\r\nelectorate that, had the House of Commons been a free body, we should\r\nhave won that freedom years before; who had seen their freedom withheld\r\nfrom them through treachery and misuse of power. I ask you to consider\r\nthat we had used, in our agitation, only peaceful means until we saw\r\nclearly that peaceful means were absolutely of no avail, and then for\r\nyears we had used only the mildest militancy, until we were taunted by\r\nCabinet Ministers, and told that we should never get the vote until we\r\nemployed the same violence that men had used in their agitation for\r\nsuffrage. After that we had used stronger militancy, but even that, by\r\ncomparison with the militancy of men in labour disputes, could not\r\npossibly be counted as violent. Through all these stages of our\r\nagitation we had been punished with the greatest severity, sent to\r\nprison like common criminals, and of late years tortured as no criminals\r\nhave been tortured for a century in civilised countries of the world.\r\nAnd during all these years we had seen disastrous strikes that had\r\ncaused suffering and death, to say nothing at all of the enormous\r\neconomic waste, and we had never seen a single strike leader punished as\r\nwe had been. We, who had suffered sentences of nine months' imprisonment\r\nfor inciting women to mild rebellion, had seen a labour leader who had\r\ndone his best to incite an army to mutiny released from prison in two\r\nmonths by the Government. And now we had come to a point where we saw\r\ncivil war threatened, where we read in the papers every day reports of\r\nspeeches a thousand times more incendiary than anything we had ever\r\nsaid. We heard prominent members of Parliament openly declaring that if\r\nthe Home Rule Bill was passed Ulster would fight, and Ulster would be\r\nright. None of these men were arrested. Instead they were applauded.\r\nLord Selborne, one of our sternest critics, referring to the fact that\r\nUlstermen were drilling under arms, said publicly: \"The method which the\r\npeople of Ulster are adopting to show the depths of their convictions\r\nand the intensity of their feelings will impress the imagination of the\r\nwhole country.\" But Lord Selborne was not arrested. Neither were the\r\nmutinous officers who resigned their commissions when ordered to report\r\nfor duty against the men of Ulster who were actually preparing for civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWhat does all this mean? Why is it that men's blood-shedding militancy\r\nis applauded and women's symbolic militancy punished with a prison cell\r\nand the forcible feeding horror? It means simply this, that men's double\r\nstandard of sex morals, whereby the victims of their lust are counted as\r\noutcasts, while the men themselves escape all social censure, really\r\napplies to morals in all departments of life. Men make the moral code\r\nand they expect women to accept it. They have decided that it is\r\nentirely right and proper for men to fight for their liberties and their\r\nrights, but that it is not right and proper for women to fight for\r\ntheirs.[3]\r\n\r\nThey have decided that for men to remain silently quiescent while\r\ntyrannical rulers impose bonds of slavery upon them is cowardly and\r\ndishonourable, but that for women to do that same thing is not cowardly\r\nand dishonourable, but merely respectable. Well, the Suffragettes\r\nabsolutely repudiate that double standard of morals. If it is right for\r\nmen to fight for their freedom, and God knows what the human race would\r\nbe like to-day if men had not, since time began, fought for their\r\nfreedom, then it is right for women to fight for their freedom and the\r\nfreedom of the children they bear. On this declaration of faith the\r\nmilitant women of England rest their case.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] There is no question that a great deal of the animus directed\r\nagainst us during 1913 and 1914 by the Government was due to sex\r\nbitterness stirred up by a series of articles written by Christabel\r\nPankhurst and published in _The Suffragette_. These articles, a fearless\r\nand authoritative expose of the evils of sexual immoralities and their\r\nblasting effect on innocent wives and children, have since been\r\npublished in a book called \"The Great Scourge, and how to end it,\"\r\nissued by David Nutt, New Oxford Street, London W. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nI had called upon women to join me in striking at the Government through\r\nthe only thing that governments are really very much concerned\r\nabout--property--and the response was immediate. Within a few days the\r\nnewspapers rang with the story of the attack made on letter boxes in\r\nLondon, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, and half a dozen other cities.\r\nIn some cases the boxes, when opened by postmen, mysteriously burst into\r\nflame; in others the letters were destroyed by corrosive chemicals; in\r\nstill others the addresses were rendered illegible by black fluids.\r\nAltogether it was estimated that over 5,000 letters were completely\r\ndestroyed and many thousands more were delayed in transit.\r\n\r\nIt was with a deep sense of their gravity that these letter-burning\r\nprotests were undertaken, but we felt that something drastic must be\r\ndone in order to destroy the apathy of the men of England who view with\r\nindifference the suffering of women oppressed by unjust laws. As we\r\npointed out, letters, precious though they may be, are less precious\r\nthan human bodies and souls. This fact was universally realised at the\r\nsinking of the _Titanic_. Letters and valuables disappeared forever, but\r\ntheir loss was forgotten in the far more terrible loss of the multitude\r\nof human lives. And so, in order to call attention to greater crimes\r\nagainst human beings, our letter burnings continued.\r\n\r\nIn only a few cases were the offenders apprehended, and one of the few\r\nwomen arrested was a helpless cripple, a woman who could move about only\r\nin a wheeled chair. She received a sentence of eight months in the first\r\ndivision, and, resolutely hunger striking, was forcibly fed with unusual\r\nbrutality, the prison doctor deliberately breaking one of her teeth in\r\norder to insert a gag. In spite of her disabilities and her weakness the\r\ncrippled girl persisted in her hunger strike and her resistance to\r\nprison rules, and within a short time had to be released. The excessive\r\nsentences of the other pillar box destroyers resolved themselves into\r\nvery short terms because of the resistance of the prisoners, every one\r\nof whom adopted the hunger strike.\r\n\r\nHaving shown the Government that we were in deadly earnest when we\r\ndeclared that we would adopt guerrilla warfare, and also that we would\r\nnot remain in prison, we announced a truce in order that the Government\r\nmight have full opportunity to fulfil their pledge in regard to a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment to the Franchise Bill. We did not, for one moment,\r\nbelieve that Mr. Asquith would willingly keep his word. We knew that he\r\nwould break it if he could, but there was a bare chance that he would\r\nnot find this possible. However, our principal reason for declaring the\r\ntruce was that we believed that the Prime Minister would find a way of\r\nevading his promise, and we were determined that the blame should be\r\nplaced, not on militancy, but on the shoulders of the real traitor. We\r\nreviewed the history of past suffrage bills: In 1908 the bill had passed\r\nits second reading by a majority of 179; and then Mr. Asquith had\r\nrefused to allow it to go on; in 1910 the Conciliation Bill passed its\r\nsecond reading by a majority of 110, and again Mr. Asquith blocked its\r\nprogress, pledging himself that if the bill were reintroduced in 1911,\r\nin a form rendering it capable of free amendment, it would be given full\r\nfacilities for becoming law; these conditions were met in 1911, and we\r\nsaw how the bill, after receiving the increased majority of 167 votes,\r\nwas torpedoed by the introduction of a Government manhood suffrage bill.\r\nMr. Asquith this time had pledged himself that the bill would be so\r\nframed that a woman suffrage amendment could be added, and he further\r\npledged that in case such an amendment was carried through its second\r\nreading, he would allow it to become a part of the bill. Just exactly\r\nhow the Government would manage to wriggle out of their promise was a\r\nmatter of excited speculation.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of rumours were flying about, some hinting at the resignation\r\nof the Prime Minister, some suggesting the possibility of a general\r\nelection, others that the amended bill would carry with it a forced\r\nreferendum on women's suffrage. It was also said that the intention of\r\nthe Government was to delay the bill so long that, after it was passed\r\nin the House, it would be excluded from the benefits of the Parliament\r\nActs, according to which a bill, delayed of passage beyond the first two\r\nyears of the life of a Parliament, has no chance of being considered by\r\nthe Lords. In order to become a law without the sanction of the House\r\nof Lords, a bill must pass three times through the House of Commons. The\r\nprospect of a woman suffrage bill doing that was practically nil.\r\n\r\nTo none of the rumours would Mr. Asquith give specific denial, and in\r\nfact the only positive utterance he made on the subject of the Franchise\r\nBill was that he considered it highly improbable that the House would\r\npass a woman suffrage amendment. In order to discourage woman suffrage\r\nsentiment in the House, Mr. Lloyd-George and Mr. Lewis Harcourt again\r\nbusied themselves with spreading pessimistic prophecies of a Cabinet\r\nsplit in case an amendment was carried. No other threat, they well knew,\r\nwould so terrorize the timid back bench Liberals, who, in addition to\r\ntheir blind party loyalty, stood in fear of losing their seats in the\r\ngeneral election which would follow such a split. Rather than risk their\r\npolitical jobs they would have sacrificed any principle. Of course the\r\nhint of a Cabinet split was pure buncombe, and it deceived few of the\r\nmembers. But it established very clearly one thing, and this was that\r\nMr. Asquith's promise that the House should be left absolutely free to\r\ndecide the suffrage issue, and that the Cabinet stood ready to bow to\r\nthe decision of the House was never meant to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe Franchise Bill unamended, by its very wording, specifically denied\r\nthe right of any woman to vote. Sir Edward Grey moved an amendment\r\ndeleting from the bill the word male, thus leaving room for a women's\r\nsuffrage amendment. Two such amendments were moved, one providing for\r\nadult suffrage for men and women, and the other providing full suffrage\r\nfor women householders and wives of householders. The latter postponed\r\nthe voting age of women to twenty-five years, instead of the men's\r\ntwenty-one. On January 24th, 1913, debate on the first of the amendments\r\nwas begun. A day and a half had been allotted to consideration of Sir\r\nEdward Grey's amendment, which if carried would leave the way clear for\r\nconsideration of the other two, to each of which one-third of a day was\r\nallotted.\r\n\r\nWe had arranged for huge meetings to be held every day during the\r\ndebates, and on the day before they were to open we sent a deputation of\r\nworking women, led by Mrs. Drummond and Miss Annie Kenney, to interview\r\nMr. Lloyd-George and Sir Edward Grey. We had asked Mr. Asquith to\r\nreceive the deputation, but, as usual, he refused. The deputation\r\nconsisted of the two leaders, four cotton mill operatives from\r\nLancashire, four workers in sweated trades of London, two pit brow\r\nlassies, two teachers, two trained nurses, one shop assistant, one\r\nlaundress, one boot and shoe worker and one domestic worker, twenty in\r\nall, the exact number specified by Mr. Lloyd-George. Some hundreds of\r\nworking women escorted the deputation to the official residence of the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer and waited anxiously in the street to hear\r\nthe result of the audience.\r\n\r\nThe result was, of course, barren. Mr. Lloyd-George glibly repeated his\r\nconfidence in the \"great opportunity\" afforded by the Franchise Bill,\r\nand Sir Edward Grey, reminding the women of the divergence of view held\r\nby the members of Cabinet on the suffrage question, assured them that\r\ntheir best opportunity for success lay in an amendment to the present\r\nbill. The women spoke with the greatest candour to the two ministers and\r\nquestioned them sharply as to the integrity of the Prime Minister's\r\npledge to accept the amendments, if passed. To such depth of infamy had\r\nEnglish politics sunk that it was possible for women openly to question\r\nthe plighted word of the King's chief Minister! Mrs. Drummond, who\r\nstands in awe of no human being, in plain words invited the slippery Mr.\r\nLloyd-George to clear his own character from obloquy. In the closing\r\nwords of her speech she put the whole matter clearly up to him, saying:\r\n\"Now, Mr. Lloyd-George, you have doggedly stuck to your old age\r\npensions, and the insurance act, and secured them, and what you have\r\ndone for these measures you can do also for the women.\"\r\n\r\nThe House met on the following afternoon to debate Sir Edward Grey's\r\npermissive amendment, but no sooner had the discussion opened than a\r\nveritable bombshell was cast into the situation. Mr. Bonar Law arose and\r\nasked for a ruling on the constitutionality of a woman's suffrage\r\namendment to the bill as framed. The Speaker, who, besides acting as the\r\npresiding officer of the House, is its official parliamentarian, replied\r\nthat, in his opinion, such an amendment would make a huge difference in\r\nthe bill, and that he would be obliged, at a later stage of the debates,\r\nto consider carefully whether, if carried, any woman suffrage amendment\r\nwould not so materially alter the bill that it would have to be\r\nwithdrawn. In spite of this sinister pronouncement, the House continued\r\nto debate the Grey amendment, which was ably supported by Lord Hugh\r\nCecil, Sir John Rolleston, and others.\r\n\r\nDuring the intervening week-end holiday two Cabinet councils were held,\r\nand when the House met on Monday the Prime Minister called upon the\r\nSpeaker for his ruling. The Speaker declared that, in his opinion, the\r\npassage of any one of the woman suffrage amendments would so alter the\r\nscope of the Franchise Bill as practically to create a new bill, because\r\nthe measure, as it was framed, did not have for its main object the\r\nbestowal of the franchise on a hitherto excluded class. Had it been so\r\nframed a woman suffrage amendment would have been entirely proper. But\r\nthe main object of the bill was to alter the qualification, or the basis\r\nof registration for a Parliamentary vote. It would increase the male\r\nelectorate, but only as an indirect result of the changed\r\nqualifications. An amendment to the bill removing the sex barrier from\r\nthe election laws was not, in the Speaker's opinion, a proper one.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister then announced the intentions of the Cabinet, which\r\nwere to withdraw the Franchise Bill and to refrain from introducing,\r\nduring that session, a plural voting bill. Mr. Asquith blandly admitted\r\nthat his pledge in regard to women's suffrage had been rendered\r\nincapable of fulfilment, and he said that he felt constrained to give a\r\nnew pledge to take its place. There were only two that could be given.\r\nThe first was that the Government should bring in a bill to enfranchise\r\nwomen, and this the Government would not do. The second was that the\r\nGovernment agree to give full facilities as to time, during the next\r\nsession of Parliament, to a private member's bill, so drafted as to be\r\ncapable of free amendment. This was the course that the Government had\r\ndecided to adopt. Mr. Asquith had the effrontery to say in conclusion\r\nthat he thought that the House would agree that he had striven and had\r\nsucceeded in giving effect, both in letter and in spirit, to every\r\nundertaking which the Government had given.\r\n\r\nTwo members only, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Keir Hardie had the courage to\r\nstand up on the floor of the House and denounce the Government's\r\ntreachery, for treachery it unquestionably was. Mr. Asquith had pledged\r\nhis sacred honour to introduce a bill that would be capable of an\r\namendment to include women's suffrage, and he had framed a bill that\r\ncould not be so amended. Whether he had done the thing deliberately,\r\nwith the plain intention of selling out the women, or whether ignorance\r\nof Parliamentary rules accounted for the failure of the bill was\r\nimmaterial. The bill need not have been drawn in ignorance. The fount of\r\nwisdom represented by Mr. Speaker could have been consulted at the time\r\nthe bill was under construction quite as easily as when it had reached\r\nthe debating stage. Our paper said editorially, representing and\r\nperfectly expressing our member's views: \"Either the Government are so\r\nignorant of Parliamentary procedure that they are unfit to occupy any\r\nposition of responsibility, or else they are scoundrels of the worst\r\nkind.\"\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the verdict of posterity will lean towards\r\nthe later conclusion. If Mr. Asquith had been a man of honour he would\r\nhave reframed the Franchise Bill in such a way that it could have\r\nincluded a suffrage amendment, or else he would have made amends for his\r\nstupendous blunder--if it was a blunder--by introducing a Government\r\nmeasure for women's suffrage. He did neither, but disposed of the matter\r\nby promising facilities for a private member's bill which he knew, and\r\nwhich everybody knew, could not possibly pass.\r\n\r\nThere was no chance for a private member's bill, even with facilities,\r\nbecause of a number of reasons, but principally because the torpedoing\r\nof the Conciliation Bill had destroyed utterly the spirit of\r\nconciliation in which Conservatives, Liberals and Radicals in the House\r\nof Commons, and militant and non-militant women throughout the Kingdom\r\nhad set aside their differences of opinion and agreed to come together\r\non a compromise measure. When the second Conciliation Bill, of 1911, was\r\nunder discussion, Lord Lytton had said: \"If this bill does not go\r\nthrough, the woman suffrage movement will not be stopped, but the spirit\r\nof conciliation of which this bill is an expression will be destroyed,\r\nand there will he war throughout the country, raging, tearing, fierce,\r\nbitter strife, though nobody wants it.\"\r\n\r\nLord Lytton's words were prophetic. At this last brazen piece of\r\ntrickery on the part of the Government the country blazed with bitter\r\nwrath. All the suffrage societies united in calling for a Government\r\nmeasure for women's suffrage to be introduced without delay. The idle\r\npromise of facilities for a private member's bill was rejected with\r\ncontumely and scorn. The Liberal women's executive committee met, and a\r\nstrong effort was made to pass a resolution threatening the withdrawal\r\nfrom party work of the entire federation, but this failed and the\r\nexecutive merely passed a feeble resolution of regret.\r\n\r\nThe membership of the Women's Liberal Federation was, at that time,\r\nclose to 200,000, and if the executive had passed the strong resolution,\r\nrefusing to do any more work for the party until a Government measure\r\nhad been introduced, the Government would have been forced to yield.\r\nThey could not have faced the country without the support of the women.\r\nBut these women, many of them, were wives of men in the service, the\r\npaid service of the Liberal Party. Many of them were wives of Liberal\r\nmembers. They lacked the courage, or the intelligence, or the insight,\r\nto declare war as a body on the Government. A large number of women, and\r\nalso many men, did resign from the Liberal Party, but the defections\r\nwere not serious enough to affect the Government.\r\n\r\nThe militants declared, and proceeded instantly to carry out,\r\nunrelenting warfare. We announced that either we must have a Government\r\nmeasure, or a Cabinet split--those men in the Cabinet calling themselves\r\nsuffragists going out--or we would take up the sword again, never to lay\r\nit down until the enfranchisement of the women of England was won.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, February, 1913, less than two years ago as I write\r\nthese words, that militancy, as it is now generally understood by the\r\npublic began--militancy in the sense of continued, destructive, guerilla\r\nwarfare against the Government through injury to private property. Some\r\nproperty had been destroyed before this time, but the attacks were\r\nsporadic, and were meant to be in the nature of a warning as to what\r\nmight become a settled policy. Now we indeed lighted the torch, and we\r\ndid it with the absolute conviction that no other course was open to us.\r\nWe had tried every other measure, as I am sure that I have demonstrated\r\nto my readers, and our years of work and suffering and sacrifice had\r\ntaught us that the Government would not yield to right and justice, what\r\nthe majority of members of the House of Commons admitted was right and\r\njustice, but that the Government would, as other governments invariably\r\ndo, yield to expediency. Now our task was to show the Government that it\r\nwas expedient to yield to the women's just demands. In order to do that\r\nwe had to make England and every department of English life insecure and\r\nunsafe. We had to make English law a failure and the courts farce comedy\r\ntheatres; we had to discredit the Government and Parliament in the eyes\r\nof the world; we had to spoil English sports, hurt business, destroy\r\nvaluable property, demoralise the world of society, shame the churches,\r\nupset the whole orderly conduct of life--\r\n\r\nThat is, we had to do as much of this guerilla warfare as the people of\r\nEngland would tolerate. When they came to the point of saying to the\r\nGovernment: \"Stop this, in the only way it can be stopped, by giving\r\nthe women of England representation,\" then we should extinguish our\r\ntorch.\r\n\r\nAmericans, of all people, ought to see the logic of our reasoning. There\r\nis one piece of American oratory, beloved of schoolboys, which has often\r\nbeen quoted from militant platforms. In a speech now included among the\r\nclassics of the English language your great statesman, Patrick Henry,\r\nsummed up the causes that led to the American Revolution. He said: \"We\r\nhave petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have\r\nprostrated ourselves at the foot of the throne, and it has all been in\r\nvain. We must fight--I repeat it, sir, we must fight.\"\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, remember, was advocating killing people, as well as\r\ndestroying private property, as the proper means of securing the\r\npolitical freedom of men. The Suffragettes have not done that, and they\r\nnever will. In fact the moving spirit of militancy is deep and abiding\r\nreverence for human life. In the latter course of our agitation I have\r\nbeen called upon to discuss our policies with many eminent men,\r\npoliticians, literary men, barristers, scientists, clergymen. One of the\r\nlast named, a high dignitary of the Church of England, told me that\r\nwhile he was a convinced suffragist, he found it impossible to justify\r\nour doing wrong that right might follow. I said to him: \"We are not\r\ndoing wrong--we are doing right in our use of revolutionary methods\r\nagainst private property. It is our work to restore thereby true values,\r\nto emphasise the value of human rights against property rights. You are\r\nwell aware, sir, that property has assumed a value in the eyes of men,\r\nand in the eyes of the law, that it ought never to claim. It is placed\r\nabove all human values. The lives and health and happiness, and even the\r\nvirtue of women and children--that is to say, the race itself--are being\r\nruthlessly sacrificed to the god of property every day of the world.\"\r\n\r\nTo this my reverend friend agreed, and I said: \"If we women are wrong in\r\ndestroying private property in order that human values may be restored,\r\nthen I say, in all reverence, that it was wrong for the Founder of\r\nChristianity to destroy private property, as He did when He lashed the\r\nmoney changers out of the Temple and when He drove the Gaderene swine\r\ninto the sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely in this spirit that our women went forth to war. In\r\nthe first month of guerilla warfare an enormous amount of property was\r\ndamaged and destroyed. On January 31st a number of putting greens were\r\nburned with acids; on February 7th and 8th telegraph and telephone wires\r\nwere cut in several places and for some hours all communication between\r\nLondon and Glasgow were suspended; a few days later windows in various\r\nof London's smartest clubs were broken, and the orchid houses at Kew\r\nwere wrecked and many valuable blooms destroyed by cold. The jewel room\r\nat the Tower of London was invaded and a showcase broken. The residence\r\nof H. R. H. Prince Christian and Lambeth Palace, seat of the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, were visited and had windows broken. The refreshment\r\nhouse in Regents Park was burned to the ground on February 12th and on\r\nFebruary 18th a country house which was being built at\r\nWalton-on-the-Hill for Mr. Lloyd-George was partially destroyed, a bomb\r\nhaving been exploded in the early morning before the arrival of the\r\nworkmen. A hat pin and a hair pin picked up near the house--coupled with\r\nthe fact that care had been taken not to endanger any lives--led the\r\npolice to believe that the deed had been done by women enemies of Mr.\r\nLloyd-George. Four days later I was arrested and brought up in Epsom\r\npolice court, where I was charged with having \"counselled and procured\"\r\nthe persons who did the damage. Admitted to bail for the night, I\r\nappeared next morning in court, where the case was fully reviewed.\r\nSpeeches of mine were read, one speech, made at a meeting held on\r\nJanuary 22nd, in which I called for volunteers to act with me in a\r\nparticular engagement; and another, made the day after the explosion, in\r\nwhich I publicly accepted responsibility for all militant acts done in\r\nthe past, and even for what had been done at Walton. At the conclusion\r\nof the hearing I was committed for trial at the May Assizes at\r\nGuildford. Bail would be allowed, it was stated, if I would agree to\r\ngive the usual undertaking to refrain from all militancy or incitement\r\nto militancy.\r\n\r\nI asked that the case be set for speedy trial at the Assizes then in\r\nprogress. I was entirely willing, I said, to give an undertaking for a\r\nshort period, for a week, or even two weeks, but I could not possibly do\r\nso for a much longer period, looking at the fact that a new session of\r\nParliament began in March, and was vitally concerned with the interests\r\nof women. The request was refused, and I was ordered to be taken to\r\nHolloway. I warned the magistrate that I should at once adopt the hunger\r\nstrike, and I told him that if I lived at all until the summer it would\r\nbe a dying woman who would come up for trial.\r\n\r\nArriving at Holloway I carried out my intention, but within twenty-four\r\nhours I heard that the authorities had arranged that my trial should\r\ntake place on April 1st, instead of at the end of June, and at the\r\nCentral Criminal Court, London, instead of the Guildford Court. I then\r\ngave the required under-takings and was immediately released on bail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Old Bailey on that memorable Wednesday, April 2nd, 1913,\r\nto be tried for inciting to commit a felony, the court was packed with\r\nwomen. A great crowd of women who could not obtain the necessary tickets\r\nremained in the streets below for hours waiting news of the trial. A\r\nlarge number of detectives from Scotland Yard, and a still larger number\r\nof uniformed police were on duty both inside and outside the court. I\r\ncould not imagine why it was considered necessary to have such a\r\nregiment of police on hand, for I had not, at that time, realised the\r\nstate of terror into which the militant movement, in its new\r\ndevelopment, had thrown the authorities.\r\n\r\nMr. Bodkin and Mr. Travers Humphreys appeared to prosecute on behalf of\r\nthe Crown, and I conducted my own case, in consultation with my\r\nsolicitor, Mr. Marshall. The Judge, Mr. Justice Lush, having taken his\r\nseat I entered the dock and listened to the reading of the indictment. I\r\npled \"not guilty,\" not because I wished to evade responsibility for the\r\nexplosion,--I had already assumed that responsibility--but because the\r\nindictment accused me of having wickedly and maliciously incited women\r\nto crime. What I had done was not wicked of purpose, but quite the\r\nopposite of wicked. I could not therefore truthfully plead guilty. The\r\ntrial having opened the Judge courteously asked me if I would like to\r\nsit down. I thanked him, and asked if I might also have a small table on\r\nwhich to place my papers. By orders of the Judge a table was brought me.\r\n\r\nMr. Bodkin opened the case by explaining the \"Malicious Damages to\r\nProperty Act\" of 1861, under which I was charged, and after describing\r\nthe explosion which had damaged the Lloyd-George house at Walton, said\r\nthat I was accused of being in the affair an accessory before the fact.\r\nIt was not suggested, he said, that I was present when the crime was\r\ncommitted, but it was charged that I had moved and incited, counselled\r\nand procured women whose names were unknown to carry out that crime. It\r\nwould be for the jury to decide, after the evidence had been presented,\r\nwhether the facts did not point most clearly to the conclusion that\r\nwomen, probably two in number, who committed the crime were members of\r\nthe Women's Social and Political Union, which had its office in Kingsway\r\nin London, and of which the defendant was the head, moving spirit and\r\nrecognised leader.\r\n\r\nThe blowing up of Mr. Lloyd-George's house was then described in detail.\r\nThat the damage was intended as an act against Mr. Lloyd-George was\r\nclear, Mr. Bodkin said, from the malicious statements made against him\r\nby the prisoner. He produced a private letter written by me to a friend\r\nin which I had defended militancy, and said that not only had it become\r\na duty but in the circumstances it had also become a political\r\nnecessity. Said Mr. Bodkin:\r\n\r\n\"A letter of that kind proves very clearly several things. It shows\r\nthat she is the leader. It shows her influence over the emotional\r\nmembers of this organisation. It shows that according to her, militancy\r\ncan be withheld for a time and let loose upon society at another time.\r\nAnd it further shows that any person or any woman who wants to indulge\r\nin militancy, which is only a picturesque expression for committing\r\ncrimes against society, has to communicate with her, and with her alone,\r\nby word of mouth or by letter. That is the Proclamation which went out\r\nto the members of this organisation. The plain language of that letter\r\nis, 'If we don't get what we want, the Government and their members will\r\nbe responsible, and the Government and the public will be bullied into\r\ngiving us what we want.'\"\r\n\r\nMany extracts from my speeches made in January and February were read,\r\nand the final speech made just before my arrest at Chelsea. But before\r\nthey were read I said:\r\n\r\n\"I wish to lodge an objection now to the police reports of my speeches.\r\nThey have been supplied to me, and the only report I accept is that of\r\nthe journalist of Cardiff who is one of the witnesses. He has furnished\r\na fairly accurate report of what I said in that town. The police reports\r\nI do not accept. They are grossly inaccurate and ignorant and\r\nungrammatical, and they convey an absolutely wrong impression of what I\r\nsaid in many respects.\"\r\n\r\nWitnesses were then examined; the carter who heard and reported the\r\nexplosion; the foreman in charge of the damaged house, who told the\r\ncost of the damages, and described the explosives, etc., found on the\r\npremises; several police officers who told of finding hairpins and a\r\nwoman's rubber golosh in the house, and so on. Absolutely nothing was\r\nbrought out that tended to show that the Suffragettes had anything to do\r\nwith the affair. The Judge noted this for he said to Mr. Bodkin:\r\n\r\n\"I am not quite sure how you present this case. There are two ways of\r\nlooking at it. Do you only ask the jury to say that the defendant\r\nspecifically counselled the perpetration of this crime, or do you also\r\nsay that, looking at her speeches that you read--assuming you prove that\r\nthey were uttered--that the language used being a general incitement to\r\ndamage property, any one who acted on this invitation and perpetrated\r\nthis outrage would be incited by her to do it?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bodkin replied that the latter assumption was correct.\r\n\r\n\"I say that the speeches generally are incitement to all kinds of acts\r\nof violence against property, and that they present evidence of attacks\r\nagainst property and a particular individual, and that there is evidence\r\nin the speeches which have been read, and which will be proved, of\r\nadmissions by Mrs. Pankhurst of having been connected with the\r\nparticular outrage in a way which makes her in law an accessory before\r\nthe fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do not confine the case to the latter way of putting it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Bodkin.\r\n\r\n\"Even if the jury are satisfied,\" said the Judge, \"that Mrs. Pankhurst\r\nwas not directly connected with this outrage by counselling it, you\r\nstill ask the jury to say that by counselling, as you say she had in the\r\nspeeches, the destruction of property, especially that belonging to a\r\nparticular gentleman, anybody who acted on that and committed this\r\noutrage would have been incited by her to do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, Mrs. Pankhurst, you now understand the way it is put?\" asked\r\nthe Judge.\r\n\r\n\"I understand it quite well, my lord,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nProceedings were resumed on the following day, and the examination of\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution went on. At the close of the examination,\r\nthe Judge inquired whether I desired to call any witnesses. I replied:\r\n\r\n\"I do not desire to give evidence or to call any witnesses, but I desire\r\nto address your Lordship.\"\r\n\r\nI began by objecting to some of the things Mr. Bodkin had said in his\r\nspeech which concerned me personally. He had referred to me--or at least\r\nhis words conveyed the suggestion--that I was a woman riding about in my\r\nmotor car inciting other women to do acts which entail imprisonment and\r\ngreat suffering, while I, perhaps indulging in some curious form of\r\npleasure, was protected, or thought myself protected, from serious\r\nconsequences. I said that Mr. Bodkin knew perfectly well that I shared\r\nall the dangers the other women faced, that I had been in prison three\r\ntimes, serving two of the sentences in full, and being treated like an\r\nordinary felon--searched, put in prison clothes, eating prison fare,\r\ngiven solitary confinement and conforming to all the abominable rules\r\nimposed upon women who commit crimes in England. I thought I owed it to\r\nmyself, especially as the same suggestions--in regard to the luxury in\r\nwhich I lived, supported by the members of the W. S. P. U.--had been\r\nmade, not only by Mr. Bodkin in court, but by members of the Government\r\nin the House of Commons--I thought I owed it to myself to say that I\r\nowned no motor car and never had owned one. The car in which I\r\noccasionally rode was owned by the organisation and was used for general\r\npropaganda work. In that car, and in cars owned by friends I had gone\r\nabout my work as a speaker in the Woman Suffrage movement. It was\r\nequally untrue, I said, that some of us were making incomes of L1,000 to\r\nL1,500 a year out of the suffrage movement, as had actually been alleged\r\nin the debates in the House in which members of Parliament were trying\r\nto decide how to crush militancy. No woman in our organisation was\r\nmaking any such income, or anything remotely like it. Myself, I had\r\nsacrificed a considerable portion of my income because I had to\r\nsurrender a very important part of it in order to be free to do what I\r\nthought was my duty in the movement.\r\n\r\nAddressing myself to my defence I told the Court that it was a very\r\nserious condition of things when a large number of respectable and\r\nnaturally law abiding people, people of upright lives, came to hold the\r\nlaw in contempt, came seriously to making up their minds that they were\r\njustified in breaking the law.\r\n\r\n\"The whole of good government,\" I said, \"rests upon acceptance of the\r\nlaw, upon respect of the law, and I say to you seriously, my lord, and\r\ngentlemen of the jury, that women of intelligence, women of training,\r\nwomen of upright life, have for many years ceased to respect the laws of\r\nthis country. It is an absolute fact, and when you look at the laws of\r\nthis country as they effect women it is not to be wondered at.\"\r\n\r\nAt some length I went over these laws, laws that made it possible for\r\nthe Judge to send me, if found guilty, to prison for fourteen years,\r\nwhile the maximum penalty for offences of the most revolting kind\r\nagainst little girls was only two years' imprisonment. The laws of\r\ninheritance, the laws of divorce, the laws of guardianship of\r\nchildren--all so scandalously unjust to women, I sketched briefly, and I\r\nsaid that not only these laws and others, but the administration of the\r\nlaws fell so far short of adequacy that women felt that they must be\r\npermitted to share the work of cleaning up the entire situation. I tried\r\nhere to tell of certain dreadful things that I had learned as the wife\r\nof a barrister, things about some of the men in high places who are\r\nentrusted with the administration of the law, of a judge of Assizes\r\nwhere many hideous crimes against women were tried, this judge himself\r\nbeing found dead one morning in a brothel, but the Court would not allow\r\nme to go into personalities, as he called it, with regard to\r\n\"distinguished people,\" and told me that the sole question before the\r\njury was whether or not I was guilty as charged. I must speak on that\r\nsubject and on no other.\r\n\r\nAfter a hard fight to be allowed to tell the jury the reasons why women\r\nhad lost respect for the law, and were making such a struggle in order\r\nto become law makers themselves, I closed my speech by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Over one thousand women have gone to prison in the course of this\r\nagitation, have suffered their imprisonment, have come out of prison\r\ninjured in health, weakened in body, but not in spirit. I come to stand\r\nmy trial from the bedside of one of my daughters, who has come out of\r\nHolloway Prison, sent there for two months' hard labour for\r\nparticipating with four other people in breaking a small pane of glass.\r\nShe has hunger-struck in prison. She submitted herself for more than\r\nfive weeks to the horrible ordeal of feeding by force, and she has come\r\nout of prison having lost nearly two stone in weight. She is so weak\r\nthat she cannot get out of her bed. And I say to you, gentlemen, that is\r\nthe kind of punishment you are inflicting upon me or any other woman who\r\nmay be brought before you. I ask you if you are prepared to send an\r\nincalculable number of women to prison--I speak to you as representing\r\nothers in the same position--if you are prepared to go on doing that\r\nkind of thing indefinitely, because that is what is going to happen.\r\nThere is absolutely no doubt about it. I think you have seen enough even\r\nin this present case to convince you that we are not women who are\r\nnotoriety hunters. We could get that, heaven knows, much more cheaply if\r\nwe sought it. We are women, rightly or wrongly, convinced that this is\r\nthe only way in which we can win power to alter what for us are\r\nintolerable conditions, absolutely intolerable conditions. A London\r\nclergyman only the other day said that 60 per cent. of the married women\r\nin his parish were breadwinners, supporting their husbands as well as\r\ntheir children. When you think of the wages women earn, when you think\r\nof what this means to the future of the children of this country, I ask\r\nyou to take this question very, very seriously. Only this morning I have\r\nhad information brought to me which could be supported by sworn\r\naffidavits, that there is in this country, in this very city of London\r\nof ours, a regulated traffic, not only in women of full age, but in\r\nlittle children; that they are being purchased, that they are being\r\nentrapped, and that they are being trained to minister to the vicious\r\npleasures of persons who ought to know better in their positions of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"Well, these are the things that have made us women determined to go on,\r\ndetermined to face everything, determined to see this thing out to the\r\nend, let it cost us what it may. And if you convict me, gentlemen, if\r\nyou find me guilty, I tell you quite honestly and quite frankly, that\r\nwhether the sentence is a long sentence, whether the sentence is a short\r\nsentence, I shall not submit to it. I shall, the moment I leave this\r\ncourt, if I am sent to prison, whether to penal servitude or to the\r\nlighter form of imprisonment--because I am not sufficiently versed in\r\nthe law to know what his lordship may decide; but whatever my sentence\r\nis, from the moment I leave this court I shall quite deliberately refuse\r\nto eat food--I shall join the women who are already in Holloway on the\r\nhunger strike. I shall come out of prison, dead or alive, at the\r\nearliest possible moment; and once out again, as soon as I am physically\r\nfit I shall enter into this fight again. Life is very dear to all of us.\r\nI am not seeking, as was said by the Home Secretary, to commit suicide.\r\nI do not want to commit suicide. I want to see the women of this country\r\nenfranchised, and I want to live until that is done. Those are the\r\nfeelings by which we are animated. We offer ourselves as sacrifices,\r\njust as your forefathers did in the past, in this cause, and I would ask\r\nyou all to put this question to yourselves:--Have you the right, as\r\nhuman beings, to condemn another human being to death--because that is\r\nwhat it amounts to? Can you throw the first stone? Have you the right to\r\njudge women?\r\n\r\n\"You have not the right in human justice, not the right by the\r\nconstitution of this country, if rightly interpreted, to judge me,\r\nbecause you are not my peers. You know, every one of you, that I should\r\nnot be standing here, that I should not break one single law--if I had\r\nthe rights that you possess, if I had a share in electing those who make\r\nthe laws I have to obey; if I had a voice in controlling the taxes I am\r\ncalled upon to pay, I should not be standing here. And I say to you it\r\nis a very serious state of things. I say to you, my lord, it is a very\r\nserious situation, that women of upright life, women who have devoted\r\nthe best of their years to the public weal, that women who are engaged\r\nin trying to undo some of the terrible mistakes that men in their\r\ngovernment of the country have made, because after all, in the last\r\nresort, men are responsible for the present state of affairs--I put it\r\nto you that it is a very serious situation. You are not accustomed to\r\ndeal with people like me in the ordinary discharge of your duties; but\r\nyou are called upon to deal with people who break the law from selfish\r\nmotives. I break the law from no selfish motive. I have no personal end\r\nto serve, neither have any of the other women who have gone through this\r\ncourt during the past few weeks, like sheep to the slaughter. Not one of\r\nthese women would, if women were free, be law-breakers. They are women\r\nwho seriously believe that this hard path that they are treading is the\r\nonly path to their enfranchisement. They seriously believe that the\r\nwelfare of humanity demands this sacrifice; they believe that the\r\nhorrible evils which are ravaging our civilisation will never be removed\r\nuntil women get the vote. They know that the very fount of life is being\r\npoisoned; they know that homes are being destroyed; that because of bad\r\neducation, because of the unequal standard of morals, even the mothers\r\nand children are destroyed by one of the vilest and most horrible\r\ndiseases that ravage humanity.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one way to put a stop to this agitation; there is only\r\none way to break down this agitation. It is not by deporting us, it is\r\nnot by locking us up in gaol; it is by doing us justice. And so I appeal\r\nto you gentlemen, in this case of mine, to give a verdict, not only on\r\nmy case, but upon the whole of this agitation. I ask you to find me not\r\nguilty of malicious incitement to a breach of the law.\r\n\r\n\"These are my last words. My incitement is not malicious. If I had\r\npower to deal with these things, I would be in absolute obedience to the\r\nlaw. I would say to women, 'You have a constitutional means of getting\r\nredress for your grievances; use your votes, convince your fellow-voters\r\nof the righteousness of your demands. That is the way to obtain\r\njustice.' I am not guilty of malicious incitement, and I appeal to you,\r\nfor the welfare of the country, for the welfare of the race, to return a\r\nverdict of not guilty in this case that you are called upon to try.\"\r\n\r\nAfter recapitulating the charge the Judge, in summing up, said:\r\n\r\n\"It is scarcely necessary for me to tell you that the topics urged by\r\nthe defendant in her address to you with regard to provocation by the\r\nlaws of the country and the injustice done to women because they are not\r\ngiven the vote as men are, have no bearing upon the question you have to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\"The motive at the back of her mind, or at the back of the minds of\r\nthose who actually did put the gunpowder there, would afford no defence\r\nto this indictment. I am quite sure you will deal with this case upon\r\nthe evidence, and the evidence alone, without regard to any question as\r\nto whether you think the law is just or unjust. It has nothing to do\r\nwith the case. I should think you will probably have no doubt that this\r\ndefendant, if she did these things charged against her, is not actuated\r\nby the ordinary selfish motive that leads most of the criminals who are\r\nin this dock to commit the crimes that they do commit. She is none the\r\nless guilty if she did these things which are charged against her,\r\nalthough she believes that by means of this kind the condition of\r\nsociety will be altered.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury retired, and soon after the afternoon session of the court\r\nopened they filed in, and in reply to the usual question asked by the\r\nclerk of arraigns, said that they had agreed upon a verdict. Said the\r\nclerk:\r\n\r\n\"Do you find Mrs. Pankhurst guilty or not guilty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guilty,\" said the foreman, \"with a strong recommendation to mercy.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke once more to the Judge.\r\n\r\n\"The jury have found me guilty, with a strong recommendation to mercy,\r\nand I do not see, since motive is not taken into account in human laws,\r\nthat they could do otherwise after your summing up. But since motive is\r\nnot taken into account in human laws, and since I, whose motives are not\r\nordinary motives, am about to be sentenced by you to the punishment\r\nwhich is accorded to people whose motives are selfish motives, I have\r\nonly this to say: If it was impossible for a different verdict to be\r\nfound; if it is your duty to sentence me, as it will be presently, then\r\nI want to say to you, as a private citizen, and to the jury as private\r\ncitizens, that I, standing here, found guilty by the laws of my country,\r\nI say to you it is your duty, as private citizens, to do what you can to\r\nput an end to this intolerable state of affairs. I put that duty upon\r\nyou. And I want to say, _whatever the sentence you pass upon me, I shall\r\ndo what is humanly possible to terminate that sentence at the earliest\r\npossible moment. I have no sense of guilt. I feel I have done my duty. I\r\nlook upon myself as a prisoner of war. I am under no moral obligation\r\nto conform to, or in any way accept, the sentence imposed upon me._ I\r\nshall take the desperate remedy that other women have taken. It is\r\nobvious to you that the struggle will be an unequal one, but I shall\r\nmake it--I shall make it as long as I have an ounce of strength left in\r\nme, or any life left in me.\r\n\r\n\"I shall fight, I shall fight, I shall fight, from the moment I enter\r\nprison to struggle against overwhelming odds; I shall resist the doctors\r\nif they attempt to feed me. I was sentenced last May in this court to\r\nnine months' imprisonment. I remained in prison six weeks. There are\r\npeople who have laughed at the ordeal of hunger-striking and forcible\r\nfeeding. All I can say is, and the doctors can bear me out, that I was\r\nreleased because, had I remained there much longer, I should have been a\r\ndead woman.\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is because I have gone through it. My own daughter[4]\r\nhas only just left it. There are women there still facing that ordeal,\r\nfacing it twice a day. Think of it, my lord, twice a day this fight is\r\ngone through. Twice a day a weak woman resisting overwhelming force,\r\nfights and fights as long as she has strength left; fights against women\r\nand even against men, resisting with her tongue, with her teeth, this\r\nordeal. Last night in the House of Commons some alternative was\r\ndiscussed, or rather, some additional punishment. Is it not a strange\r\nthing, my lord, that laws which have sufficed to restrain men\r\nthroughout the history of this country do not suffice now to restrain\r\nwomen--decent women, honourable women?\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lord, I do want you to realise it. I am not whining about my\r\npunishment, I invited it. I deliberately broke the law, not hysterically\r\nor emotionally, but of set serious purpose, because I honestly feel it\r\nis the only way. Now, I put the responsibility of what is to follow upon\r\nyou, my lord, as a private citizen, and upon the gentlemen of the jury,\r\nas private citizens, and upon all the men in this court--what are you,\r\nwith your political powers, going to do to end this intolerable\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n\"_To the women I have represented, to the women who, in response to my\r\nincitement, have faced these terrible consequences, have broken laws, to\r\nthem, I want to say I am not going to fail them, but to face it as they\r\nface it, to go through with it, and I know that they will go on with the\r\nfight whether I live or whether I die._\r\n\r\n\"_This movement will go on and on until we have the rights of citizens\r\nin this country, as women have in our Colonies, as they will have\r\nthroughout the civilised world before this woman's war is ended._\r\n\r\n\"That is all I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Lush, in passing sentence, said: \"It is my duty, Mrs.\r\nEmmeline Pankhurst, and a very painful duty it is, to pass what, in my\r\nopinion, is a suitable and adequate sentence for the crime of which you\r\nhave been most properly convicted, having regard to the strong\r\nrecommendation to mercy by the jury. I quite recognise, as I have\r\nalready said, that the motives that have actuated you in committing\r\nthis crime are not the selfish motives that actuate most of the persons\r\nwho stand in your position, but although you blind your eyes to it, I\r\ncannot help pointing out to you that the crime of which you have been\r\nconvicted is not only a very serious one, but, in spite of your motives,\r\nit is, in fact, a wicked one. It is wicked because it not only leads to\r\nthe destruction of property of persons who have done you no wrong, but\r\nin spite of your calculations, it may expose other people to the danger\r\nof being maimed or even killed. It is wicked because you are, and have\r\nbeen, luring other people--young women, it may be--to engage in such\r\ncrimes, possibly to their own ruin; and it is wicked, because you cannot\r\nhelp being alive to it if you would only think.\r\n\r\n\"You are setting an example to other persons who may have other\r\ngrievances that they legitimately want to have put right by embarking on\r\na similar scheme to yours, and trying to effect their object by\r\nattacking the property, if not the lives, of other people. I know,\r\nunfortunately--at least, I feel sure--you will pay no heed to what I\r\nsay. I only beg of you to think of these things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of them,\" I interjected.\r\n\r\n\"Think, if only for one short hour, dispassionately,\" continued the\r\nmajesty of law, \"I can only say that, although the sentence I am going\r\nto pass must be a severe one, must be adequate to the crime of which you\r\nhave been found guilty, if you would only realise the wrong you are\r\ndoing, and the mistake you are making, and would see the error you have\r\ncommitted, and undertake to amend matters by using your influence in a\r\nright direction, I would be the first to use all my best endeavours to\r\nbring about a mitigation of the sentence I am about to pass.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, and I will not, regard your crime as a merely trivial one. It\r\nis not. It is a most serious one, and, whatever you may think, it is a\r\nwicked one. I have paid regard to the recommendation of the jury. You\r\nyourself have stated the maximum sentence which this particular offence\r\nis by the legislature thought to deserve. The least sentence I can pass\r\nupon you is a sentence of three years' penal servitude.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sentence was pronounced the intense silence which had\r\nreigned throughout the trial was broken, and an absolute pandemonium\r\nbroke out among the spectators. At first it was merely a confused and\r\nangry murmur of \"Shame!\" \"Shame!\" The murmurs quickly swelled into loud\r\nand indignant cries, and then from gallery and court there arose a great\r\nchorus uttered with the utmost intensity and passion. \"Shame!\" \"Shame!\"\r\nThe women sprang to their feet, in many instances stood on their seats,\r\nshouting \"Shame!\" \"Shame!\" as I was conducted out of the dock in charge\r\nof two wardresses. \"Keep the flag flying!\" shouted a woman's voice, and\r\nthe response came in a chorus: \"We will!\" \"Bravo!\" \"Three cheers for\r\nMrs. Pankhurst!\" That was the last I heard of the courtroom protest.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I heard that the noise and confusion was kept up for several\r\nminutes longer, the Judge and the police being quite powerless to\r\nobtain order. Then the women filed out singing the Women's\r\nMarseillaise--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"March on, march on,\r\n     Face to the dawn,\r\n     The dawn of liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judge flung after their retreating forms the dire threat of prison\r\nfor any woman who dared repeat such a scene. Threat of prison--to\r\nSuffragettes! The women's song only swelled the louder and the corridors\r\nof Old Bailey reverberated with their shouts. Certainly that venerable\r\nbuilding had never in its checkered history witnessed such a scene. The\r\ngreat crowd of detectives and police who were on duty seemed actually\r\nparalysed by the audacity of the protest, for they made no attempt to\r\nintervene.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock, when I left the court by a side entrance in Newgate\r\nStreet, I found a crowd of women waiting to cheer me. With the two\r\nwardresses I entered a four wheeler and was driven to Holloway to begin\r\nmy hunger strike. Scores of women followed in taxicabs, and when I\r\narrived at the prison gates there was another protest of cheers for the\r\ncause and boos for the law. In the midst of all this intense excitement\r\nI passed through the grim gates into the twilight of prison, now become\r\na battle-ground.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] Sylvia Pankhurst, who was forcibly fed for five weeks, during an\r\noriginal sentence of two months imposed for breaking one window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nPrison had indeed been for us a battle-ground ever since the time when\r\nwe had solemnly resolved that, as a matter of principle, we would not\r\nsubmit to the rules that bound ordinary offenders against the law. But\r\nwhen I entered Holloway on that April day in 1913, it was with full\r\nknowledge that I had before me a far more prolonged struggle than any\r\nthat the militant suffragists had hitherto faced. I have described the\r\nhunger strike, that terrible weapon with which we had repeatedly broken\r\nour prison bars. The Government, at their wits' end to cope with the\r\nhunger strikers, and to overcome a situation which had brought the laws\r\nof England into such scandalous disrepute, had had recourse to a\r\nmeasure, surely the most savagely devised ever brought before a modern\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn March of that year, while I was waiting trial on the charge of\r\nconspiring to destroy Mr. Lloyd-George's country house, a bill was\r\nintroduced into the House of Commons by the Home Secretary, Mr. Reginald\r\nMcKenna, a bill which had for its avowed object the breaking down of the\r\nhunger strike. This measure, now universally known as the \"Cat and Mouse\r\nAct,\" provided that when a hunger striking suffrage prisoner (the law\r\nwas frankly admitted to apply only to suffrage prisoners) was certified\r\nby the prison doctors to be in danger of death, she could be ordered\r\nreleased on a sort of a ticket of leave for the purpose of regaining\r\nstrength enough to undergo the remainder of her sentence. Released, she\r\nwas still a prisoner, the prisoner, or the patient, or the victim, as\r\nyou may choose to call her, being kept under constant police\r\nsurveillance. According to the terms of the bill the prisoner was\r\nreleased for a specified number of days, at the expiration of which she\r\nwas supposed to return to prison on her own account. Says the Act:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The period of temporary discharge may, if the Secretary of State\r\n     thinks fit, be extended on a representation of the prisoner that\r\n     the state of her health renders her unfit to return to prison. If\r\n     such representation be made, the prisoner shall submit herself, if\r\n     so required, for medical examination by the medical officer of the\r\n     above mentioned prison, or other registered medical practitioner\r\n     appointed by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n     The prisoner shall notify to the Commissioner of Police of the\r\n     Metropolis the place of residence to which she goes on her\r\n     discharge. She shall not change her residence without giving one\r\n     clear day's notice in writing to the Commissioner, specifying the\r\n     residence to which she is going and she shall not be temporarily\r\n     absent from her residence for more than twelve hours without giving\r\n     a like notice,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of militant suffragists respecting a law of this order is\r\nalmost humorous, and yet the smile dies before the pity one feels for\r\nthe Minister whose confession of failure is embodied in such a measure.\r\nHere was a mighty Government weakly resolved that justice to women it\r\nwould not grant, knowing that submission of women it could not force,\r\nand so was willing to compromise with a piece of class legislation\r\nabsolutely contrary to all of its avowed principles. Said Mr. McKenna,\r\npleading in the House for the advancement of his odious measure: \"At the\r\npresent time I cannot make these prisoners undergo their sentences\r\nwithout serious risk of death and I want to have power to enable me to\r\ncompel a prisoner to undergo the sentence, and I want that power in all\r\ncases where the prisoner adopts the system of the hunger strike. At the\r\npresent moment, although I have the power of release, I cannot release a\r\nprisoner without a pardon, and I have to discharge them for good. I want\r\nthe power of releasing a prisoner without a pardon, with the sentence\r\nremaining alive.... I want to enforce the Law, and I want, if I can, to\r\nenforce it without forcible feeding, and without undergoing the risk of\r\nsome one else's life.\"\r\n\r\nInterrogated by several members, Mr. McKenna admitted that the \"Cat and\r\nMouse\" bill, if passed, would not inevitably do away with forcible\r\nfeeding, but he promised that the hateful and disgusting process would\r\nbe resorted to only when \"absolutely necessary.\" We shall see later how\r\nhypocritical this representation was.\r\n\r\nParliament, which had never had time to consider, beyond its initial\r\nstages, a women's suffrage measure, passed the Cat and Mouse Act through\r\nboth houses within the limits of a few days. It was already law when I\r\nentered Holloway on April 3rd, 1913, and I grieve to state that many\r\nmembers of the Labour Party, pledged to support woman suffrage, helped\r\nto make it into law.\r\n\r\nOf course the Act was, from its inception, treated by the suffragists\r\nwith the utmost contempt. We had not the slightest intention of\r\nassisting Mr. McKenna in enforcing unjust sentences against soldiers in\r\nthe army of freedom, and when the prison doors closed behind me I\r\nadopted the hunger strike exactly as though I expected it to prove, as\r\nformerly, a means of gaining my liberty.\r\n\r\nThat struggle is not a pleasant one to recall. Every possible means of\r\nbreaking down my resolution was resorted to. The daintiest and most\r\ntempting food was placed in my cell. All sorts of arguments were brought\r\nto bear against me--the futility of resisting the Cat and Mouse Act, the\r\nwickedness of risking suicide--I shall not attempt to record all the\r\narguments. They fell against a blank wall of consciousness, for my\r\nthoughts were all very far away from Holloway and all its torments. I\r\nknew, what afterwards I learned as a fact, that my imprisonment was\r\nfollowed by the greatest revolutionary outbreak that had been witnessed\r\nin England since 1832. From one end of the island to the other the\r\nbeacons of the women's revolution blazed night and day. Many country\r\nhouses--all unoccupied--were fired, the grand stand of Ayr race course\r\nwas burned to the ground, a bomb was exploded in Oxted Station, London,\r\nblowing out walls and windows, some empty railroad carriages were blown\r\nup, the glass of thirteen famous paintings in the Manchester Art Gallery\r\nwere smashed with hammers--these are simply random specimens of the\r\ngeneral outbreak of secret guerilla warfare waged by women to whose\r\nliberties every other approach had been barricaded by the Liberal\r\nGovernment of free England. The only answer of the Government was the\r\nclosing of the British Museum, the National Gallery, Windsor Castle, and\r\nother tourist resorts. As for the result on the people of England, that\r\nwas exactly what we had anticipated. The public were thrown into a state\r\nof emotion of insecurity and frightened expectancy. Not yet did they\r\nshow themselves ready to demand of the Government that the outrages be\r\nstopped in the only way they could be stopped--by giving votes to women.\r\nI knew that it would be so. Lying in my lonely cell in Holloway, racked\r\nwith pain, oppressed with increasing weakness, depressed with the heavy\r\nresponsibility of unknown happenings, I was sadly aware that we were but\r\napproaching a far goal. The end, though certain, was still distant.\r\nPatience, and still more patience, faith and still more faith, well, we\r\nhad called upon these souls' help before and it was certain that they\r\nwould not fail us at this greatest crisis of all.\r\n\r\nThus in great anguish of mind and body passed nine terrible days, each\r\none longer and more acutely miserable than the preceding. Towards the\r\nlast, I was mercifully half unconscious of my surroundings. A curious\r\nindifference took possession of my over-wrought mind, and it was almost\r\nwithout emotion that I heard, on the morning of the tenth day, that I\r\nwas to be released temporarily in order to recover my health. The\r\nGovernor came to my cell and read me my licence, which commanded me to\r\nreturn to Holloway in fifteen days, and meanwhile to observe all the\r\nobsequious terms as to informing the police of my movements. With what\r\nstrength my hands retained I tore the document in strips and dropped it\r\non the floor of the cell. \"I have no intention,\" I said, \"of obeying\r\nthis infamous law. You release me knowing perfectly well that I shall\r\nnever voluntarily return to any of your prisons.\"\r\n\r\nThey sent me away, sitting bolt upright in a cab, unmindful of the fact\r\nthat I was in a dangerous condition of weakness, having lost two stone\r\nin weight and suffered seriously from irregularities of heart action. As\r\nI left the prison I was gratefully aware of groups of our women standing\r\nbravely at the gates, as though enduring a long vigil. As a matter of\r\nfact, relays of women had picketed the place night and day during the\r\nwhole term of my imprisonment. The first pickets were arrested, but as\r\nothers constantly arrived to fill their places the police finally gave\r\nin and allowed the women to march up and down before the prison carrying\r\nthe flag.\r\n\r\nAt the nursing home to which I was conveyed I learned that Annie Kenney,\r\nMrs. Drummond, and our staunch friend, Mr. George Lansbury,[5] had been\r\narrested during my imprisonment, and that all three had adopted the\r\nhunger strike. I also learned on my own account how desperately the\r\nGovernment were striving to make their Cat and Mouse Act--the last stand\r\nin their losing campaign--a success. Without regard to the extra expense\r\nlaid on the unfortunate tax payers of the country, the Government\r\nemployed a large extra force of police especially for this purpose. As\r\nI lay in bed, being assisted by every medical resource to return to life\r\nand health, these special police, colloquially termed \"Cats,\" guarded\r\nthe nursing home as if it were a besieged castle. In the street under my\r\nwindows two detectives and a constable stood on guard night and day. In\r\na house at right angles to my refuge three more detectives kept constant\r\nwatch. In the mews at the rear of the house were more detectives, and\r\ndiligently patrolling the road, as if in expectation of a rescuing\r\nregiment, two taxicabs, each with its quota of detectives, guarded the\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\nAll this made recovery slow and difficult. But worse was to come. On\r\nApril 30th, just as I was beginning to rally somewhat, came the news\r\nthat the police had swooped down on our headquarters in Kingsway and had\r\narrested the entire official force. Miss Barrett, associate editor of\r\n_The Suffragette_; Miss Lennox, the sub-editor; Miss Lake, business\r\nmanager; Miss Kerr, office manager, and Mrs. Sanders, financial\r\nsecretary of the Union, were arrested, although not one of them had ever\r\nappeared in any militant action. Mr. E. G. Clayton, a chemist, was also\r\narrested, accused of furnishing the W. S. P. U. with explosive\r\nmaterials. The offices were thoroughly searched, and, as on a former\r\noccasion, stripped of all books and papers. While this was being done\r\nanother party of police, armed with a special warrant, proceeded to the\r\nprinting office where our paper, _The Suffragette_, was published. The\r\nprinter, Mr. Drew, was placed under arrest and the material for the\r\npaper, which was to appear on the following day, was seized. By one\r\no'clock in the afternoon the entire plant and the headquarters of the\r\nUnion were in the hands of the police, and to all appearances the\r\nmilitant movement--temporarily at least--was brought to a full stop. In\r\nmy state of semi-prostration it at first seemed to me best to let the\r\nweek's issue of the paper lapse, but on second thought I decided that\r\neven the appearance of surrender was not to be thought of. How we\r\nmanaged it need not here be told, but we actually did, overnight, with\r\nhardly any material, except Christabel's leading article, and with\r\nhastily summoned helpers, get out the paper as usual, and side by side\r\nwith the morning journals which bore front page stories of the\r\nsuppression of the Suffragette organ, our paper sellers sold _The\r\nSuffragette_. The front page bore, instead of the usual cartoon, the\r\nsingle word in bold faced type--\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \"RAIDED,\"\r\n\r\nthe full story of the police search and the arrests being related in the\r\nother pages. Our headquarters, I may say in passing, remained closed\r\nless than forty-eight hours. We are so organised that the arrest of\r\nleaders does not seriously cripple us. Every one has an understudy, and\r\nwhen one leader drops out her substitute is ready instantly to take her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency there appeared as chief organiser in Miss Kenney's\r\nplace, Miss Grace Roe, one of the young Suffragettes of whom I, as\r\nbelonging to the older generation, am so proud. Faced by difficulties\r\nas great as the Government could make them, Miss Roe at once showed\r\nherself to be equal to the situation, and to have the gift of unswerving\r\nloyalty combined with a strong and rapid judgment of things and people.\r\nAiding her was Mrs. Dacre Fox, who surprised us all by her amazing\r\nability to act as assistant editor of _The Suffragette_, manage a host\r\nof affairs in the office, and preside at our weekly meetings. Another\r\nmember of the Union who came prominently to the front at the time of\r\nthis crisis was Mrs. Mansel.\r\n\r\nIn two days' time the office was open and running quite as usual, no\r\noutward sign showing the grief and indignation felt for our imprisoned\r\ncomrades. Most of them refused bail and instantly hunger struck\r\nappearing in court for trial three days later in a pitiful state. Mrs.\r\nDrummond was so obviously ill and in need of medical attention that she\r\nwas discharged and was very soon afterwards operated upon. Mr. Drew, the\r\nprinter, was forced to sign an undertaking not to publish the paper\r\nagain. The others were sentenced to terms varying from six to eighteen\r\nmonths. Mr. Clayton was sentenced to twenty-one months, and after\r\ndesperate resistance, during which he was forcibly fed many times,\r\nescaped his prison. The others, following the same example, starved\r\ntheir way to liberty, and have ever since been pursued at intervals and\r\nrearrested under the Cat and Mouse Act.\r\n\r\nAfter my discharge, April 12th, I remained in the nursing home until\r\npartially restored, then, under the eyes of the police, I motored out to\r\nWoking, the country home of my friend, Dr. Ethel Smyth. This house,\r\nlike the nursing home, was guarded by a small army of police. I never\r\nwent to the window, I never took the air in the garden without being\r\nconscious of watching eyes. The situation became intolerable, and I\r\ndetermined to end it. On May 26th there was a great meeting at the\r\nLondon Pavillion, and I gave notice that I would attend it. Supported by\r\nDr. Flora Murray, Dr. Ethel Smyth and my devoted Nurse Pine, I walked\r\ndownstairs, to be confronted at the door by a detective, who demanded to\r\nknow where I was going. I was in a weak state, much weaker than I had\r\nimagined, and in refusing the right of a man to question my movements I\r\nexhausted the last remnant of my strength and sank fainting in the arms\r\nof my friends. As soon as I recovered I got into the motor car. The\r\ndetective instantly took his place beside me and told the chauffeur to\r\ndrive to Bow Street Station. The chauffeur replied that he took his\r\norders only from Mrs. Pankhurst, whereupon the detective summoned a\r\ntaxicab and, placing me under arrest, took me to Bow Street.\r\n\r\nUnder the Cat and Mouse Act a paroled prisoner can be thus arrested\r\nwithout the formality of a warrant, nor does the time she has spent at\r\nliberty, in regaining her health, count off from her prison sentence.\r\nThe magistrate at Bow Street was therefore quite within his legal rights\r\nwhen he ordered me returned to Holloway. I felt it my duty,\r\nnevertheless, to point out to him the inhumanity of his act. I said to\r\nhim: \"I was released from Holloway on account of my health. Since then I\r\nhave been treated exactly as if I were in prison. It has become\r\nabsolutely impossible for any one to recover health under such\r\nconditions, and this morning I decided to make this protest against a\r\nstate of affairs unparalleled in a civilised country.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RE-ARREST OF MRS. PANKHURST AT WOKING\r\n\r\n_May 26, 1913_]\r\n\r\nThe magistrate replied formally: \"You quite understand what the position\r\nis. You have been arrested on this warrant and all I have to do is to\r\nmake an order recommending you to prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think\" I said, \"that you should do so, with a full sense of\r\nresponsibility. If I am taken to Holloway on your warrant I shall resume\r\nthe protest I made before which led to my release, and I shall go on\r\nindefinitely until I die, or until the Government decide, since they\r\nhave taken upon themselves to employ you and other people to administer\r\nthe laws, that they must recognise women as citizens and give them some\r\ncontrol over the laws of this country.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a five days' hunger strike this time, because the extreme\r\nweakness of my condition made it impossible for me to endure a longer\r\nterm. I was released on May 30th on a seven days' licence, and in a\r\nhalf-alive state was again carried to a nursing home. Less than a week\r\nlater, while I was still bed-ridden, a terrible event occurred, one that\r\nshould have shaken the stolid British public into a realisation of the\r\nseriousness of the situation precipitated by the Government. Emily\r\nWilding Davison, who had been associated with the militant movement\r\nsince 1906, gave up her life for the women's cause by throwing herself\r\nin the path of the thing, next to property, held most sacred to\r\nEnglishmen--sport. Miss Davison went to the races at Epsom, and\r\nbreaking through the barriers which separated the vast crowds from the\r\nrace course, rushed in the path of the galloping horses and caught the\r\nbridle of the King's horse, which was leading all the others. The horse\r\nfell, throwing his jockey and crushing Miss Davison in such shocking\r\nfashion that she was carried from the course in a dying condition.\r\nEverything possible was done to save her life. The great surgeon, Mr.\r\nMansell Moullin, put everything aside and devoted himself to her case,\r\nbut though he operated most skilfully, the injuries she had received\r\nwere so frightful that she died four days later without once having\r\nrecovered consciousness. Members of the Union were beside her when she\r\nbreathed her last, on June 8th, and on June 14th they gave her a great\r\npublic funeral in London. Crowds lined the streets as the funeral car,\r\nfollowed by thousands of women, passed slowly and sadly to St. George's\r\nChurch, Bloomsbury, where the memorial services were held.\r\n\r\nEmily Wilding Davison was a character almost inevitably developed by a\r\nstruggle such as ours. She was a B. A. of London University, and had\r\ntaken first class honours at Oxford in English Language and Literature.\r\nYet the women's cause made such an appeal to her reason and her\r\nsympathies that she put every intellectual and social appeal aside and\r\ndevoted herself untiringly and fearlessly to the work of the Union. She\r\nhad suffered many imprisonments, had been forcibly fed and most brutally\r\ntreated. On one occasion when she had barricaded her cell against the\r\nprison doctors, a hose pipe was turned on her from the window and she\r\nwas drenched and all but drowned in the icy water while workmen were\r\nbreaking down her cell door. Miss Davison, after this experience,\r\nexpressed to several of her friends the deep conviction that now, as in\r\ndays called uncivilised, the conscience of the people would awaken only\r\nto the sacrifice of a human life. At one time in prison she tried to\r\nkill herself by throwing herself head-long from one of the upper\r\ngalleries, but she succeeded only in sustaining cruel injuries. Ever\r\nafter that time she clung to her conviction that one great tragedy, the\r\ndeliberate throwing into the breach of a human life, would put an end to\r\nthe intolerable torture of women. And so she threw herself at the King's\r\nhorse, in full view of the King and Queen and a great multitude of their\r\nMajesties' subjects, offering up her life as a petition to the King,\r\npraying for the release of suffering women throughout England and the\r\nworld. No one can possibly doubt that that prayer can forever remain\r\nunanswered, for she took it straight to the Throne of the King of all\r\nthe worlds.\r\n\r\nThe death of Miss Davison was a great shock to me and a very great grief\r\nas well, and although I was scarcely able to leave my bed I determined\r\nto risk everything to attend her funeral. This was not to be, however,\r\nfor as I left the house I was again arrested by detectives who lay in\r\nwaiting. Again the farce of trying to make me serve a three years'\r\nsentence was undertaken. But now the militant women had discovered a new\r\nand more terrible weapon with which to defy the unjust laws of England,\r\nand this weapon--the thirst strike--I turned against my gaolers with\r\nsuch effect that they were forced within three days to release me.\r\n\r\nThe hunger strike I have described as a dreadful ordeal, but it is a\r\nmild experience compared with the thirst strike, which is from beginning\r\nto end simple and unmitigated torture. Hunger striking reduces a\r\nprisoner's weight very quickly, but thirst striking reduces weight so\r\nalarmingly fast that prison doctors were at first thrown into absolute\r\npanic of fright. Later they became somewhat hardened, but even now they\r\nregard the thirst strike with terror. I am not sure that I can convey to\r\nthe reader the effect of days spent without a single drop of water taken\r\ninto the system. The body cannot endure loss of moisture. It cries out\r\nin protest with every nerve. The muscles waste, the skin becomes\r\nshrunken and flabby, the facial appearance alters horribly, all these\r\noutward symptoms being eloquent of the acute suffering of the entire\r\nphysical being. Every natural function is, of course, suspended, and the\r\npoisons which are unable to pass out of the body are retained and\r\nabsorbed. The body becomes cold and shivery, there is constant headache\r\nand nausea, and sometimes there is fever. The mouth and tongue become\r\ncoated and swollen, the throat thickens and the voice sinks to a thready\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the third day of my first thirst strike, I was sent\r\nhome I was in a condition of jaundice from which I have never completely\r\nrecovered. So badly was I affected that the prison authorities made no\r\nattempt to arrest me for nearly a month after my release. On July 13th I\r\nfelt strong enough once more to protest against the odious Cat and Mouse\r\nAct, and, with Miss Annie Kenney, who was also at liberty \"on medical\r\ngrounds,\" I went to a meeting at the London Pavillion. At the close of\r\nthe meeting, during which Miss Kenney's prison licence was auctioned off\r\nfor L12, we attempted for the first time the open escape which we have\r\nso frequently since effected. Miss Kenney, from the platform, announced\r\nthat we should openly leave the hall, and she forthwith walked coolly\r\ndown into the audience. The police rushed in in overwhelming numbers,\r\nand after a desperate fight, succeeded in capturing her. Other\r\ndetectives and policemen hurried to the side door of the hall to\r\nintercept me, but I disappointed them by leaving by the front door and\r\nescaping to a friend's house in a cab.\r\n\r\nThe police soon traced me to the house of my friend, the distinguished\r\nscientist, Mrs. Hertha Ayrton, and the place straightway became a\r\nbesieged fortress. Day and night the house was surrounded, not only by\r\npolice, but by crowds of women sympathisers. On the Saturday following\r\nmy appearance at the Pavillion we gave the police a bit of excitement of\r\na kind they do not relish. A cab drove up to Mrs. Ayrton's door, and\r\nseveral well-known members of the Union alighted and hurried indoors. At\r\nonce the word was circulated that a rescue was being attempted, and the\r\npolice drew resolutely around the cab. Soon a veiled woman appeared in\r\nthe doorway, surrounded by Suffragettes, who, when the veiled lady\r\nattempted to get into the cab, resisted with all their strength the\r\nefforts of the police to lay hands upon her. The cry went up from all\r\nsides: \"They are arresting Mrs. Pankhurst!\" Something very like a free\r\nfight ensued, occupying all the attention of the police who were not in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the cab. The men surrounding that rocking\r\nvehicle succeeded in tearing the veiled figure from the arms of the\r\nother women and piling into the cab ordered the chauffeur to drive full\r\nspeed to Bow Street. Before they reached their destination, however, the\r\nveiled lady raised her veil--alas, it was not Mrs. Pankhurst, who by\r\nthat time was speeding away in another taxicab in quite another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOur ruse infuriated the police, and they determined to arrest me at my\r\nfirst public appearance, which was at the Pavillion on the Monday\r\nfollowing the episode just related. When I reached the Pavillion I found\r\nit literally surrounded by police, hundreds of them. I managed to slip\r\npast the outside cordon, but Scotland Yard had its best men inside the\r\nhall, and I was not permitted to reach the platform. Surrounded by plain\r\nclothes men, batons drawn, I could not escape, but I called out to the\r\nwomen that I was being taken, and so valiantly did they rush to the\r\nrescue that the police had their hands full for nearly half an hour\r\nbefore they got me into a taxicab bound for Holloway. Six women were\r\narrested that day, and many more than six policemen were temporarily\r\nincapacitated for duty.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had made up my mind that I would not only resist staying\r\nin prison, I would resist to the utmost of my ability going to prison.\r\nTherefore, when we reached Holloway I refused to get out of the cab,\r\ndeclaring to my captors that I would no longer acquiesce in the slow\r\njudicial murder to which the Government were subjecting women. I was\r\nlifted out and carried into a cell in the convicted hospital wing of the\r\ngaol. The wardresses who were on duty there spoke with some kindness to\r\nme, suggesting that, as I was very apparently exhausted and ill, I\r\nshould do well to undress and go to bed. \"No,\" I replied, \"I shall not\r\ngo to bed, not once while I am kept here. I am weary of this brutal\r\ngame, and I intend to end it.\"\r\n\r\nWithout undressing, I lay down on the outside of the bed. Later in the\r\nevening the prison doctor visited me, but I refused to be examined. In\r\nthe morning he came again, and with him the Governor and the head\r\nwardress. As I had taken neither food nor water since the previous day\r\nmy appearance had become altered to such an extent that the doctor was\r\nplainly perturbed. He begged me, \"as a small concession,\" to allow him\r\nto feel my pulse, but I shook my head, and they left me alone for the\r\nday. That night I was so ill that I felt some alarm for my own\r\ncondition, but I knew of nothing that could be done except to wait. On\r\nWednesday morning the Governor came again and asked me with an\r\nassumption of carelessness if it were true that I was refusing both food\r\nand water. \"It is true,\" I said, and he replied brutally: \"You are very\r\ncheap to keep.\" Then, as if the thing were not a ridiculous farce, he\r\nannounced that I was sentenced to close confinement for three days,\r\nwith deprivation of all privileges, after which he left my cell.\r\n\r\nTwice that day the doctor visited me, but I would not allow him to touch\r\nme. Later came a medical officer from the Home Office, to which I had\r\ncomplained, as I had complained to the Governor and the prison doctor,\r\nof the pain I still suffered from the rough treatment I had received at\r\nthe Pavillion. Both of the medical men insisted that I allow them to\r\nexamine me, but I said: \"I will not be examined by you because your\r\nintention is not to help me as a patient, but merely to ascertain how\r\nmuch longer it will be possible to keep me alive in prison. I am not\r\nprepared to assist you or the Government in any such way. I am not\r\nprepared to relieve you of any responsibility in this matter.\" I added\r\nthat it must be quite obvious that I was very ill and unfit to be\r\nconfined in prison. They hesitated for a moment or two, then left me.\r\n\r\nWednesday night was a long nightmare of suffering, and by Thursday\r\nmorning I must have presented an almost mummified appearance. From the\r\nfaces of the Governor and the doctor when they came into my cell and\r\nlooked at me I thought that they would at once arrange for my release.\r\nBut the hours passed and no order for release came. I decided that I\r\nmust force my release, and I got up from the bed where I had been lying\r\nand began to stagger up and down the cell. When all strength failed me\r\nand I could keep my feet no longer I lay down on the stone floor, and\r\nthere, at four in the afternoon, they found me, gasping and half\r\nunconscious. And then they sent me away. I was in a very weakened\r\ncondition this time, and had to be treated with saline solutions to save\r\nmy life. I felt, however, that I had broken my prison walls for a time\r\nat least, and so this proved. It was on July 24th that I was released. A\r\nfew days later I was borne in an invalid's chair to the platform of the\r\nLondon Pavillion. I could not speak, but I was there, as I had promised\r\nto be. My licence, which by this time I had ceased to tear up because it\r\nhad an auction value, was sold to an American present for the sum of one\r\nhundred pounds. I had told the Governor on leaving that I intended to\r\nsell the licence and to spend the money for militant purposes, but I had\r\nnot expected to raise such a splendid sum as one hundred pounds. I shall\r\nalways remember the generosity of that unknown American friend.\r\n\r\nA great medical congress was being held in London in the summer of 1913,\r\nand on August 11th we held a large meeting at Kingsway Hall, which was\r\nattended by hundreds of visiting doctors. I addressed this meeting, at\r\nwhich a ringing resolution against forcible feeding was passed, and I\r\nwas allowed to go home without police interference. It was, as a matter\r\nof fact, the second time during that month that I had spoken in public\r\nwithout molestation. The presence of so many distinguished medical men\r\nin London may have suggested to the authorities that I had better be\r\nleft alone for the time being. At all events I was left alone, and late\r\nin the month I went, quite publicly, to Paris, to see my daughter\r\nChristabel and plan with her the campaign for the coming autumn. I\r\nneeded rest after the struggles of the past five months, during which I\r\nhad served, of my three years' prison sentence, not quite three weeks.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] Mr. Lansbury shortly before this had resigned his seat in Parliament\r\nand had gone to his constituents on the question of women's suffrage.\r\nBoth the Liberal and the Conservative parties had united against him,\r\nwith the result that a Unionist candidate was returned in his place. Mr.\r\nLloyd-George publicly rejoiced in the result of this election, saying\r\nthat Mr. Marsh, the Conservative candidate, had been his man. The Labour\r\nParty, in Parliament and out, meekly accepted this piece of Liberal\r\nchicanery without protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two months of the summer of 1913 which were spent with my daughter\r\nin Paris were almost the last days of peace and rest I have been\r\ndestined since to enjoy. I spent the days, or some hours of them, in the\r\ninitial preparation of this volume, because it seemed to me that I had a\r\nduty to perform in giving to the world my own plain statement of the\r\nevents which have led up to the women's revolution in England. Other\r\nhistories of the militant movement will undoubtedly be written; in times\r\nto come when in all constitutional countries of the world, women's votes\r\nwill be as universally accepted as men's votes are now; when men and\r\nwomen occupy the world of industry on equal terms, as co-workers rather\r\nthan as cut-throat competitors; when, in a word, all the dreadful and\r\ncriminal discriminations which exist now between the sexes are\r\nabolished, as they must one day be abolished, the historian will be able\r\nto sit down in leisurely fashion and do full justice to the strange\r\nstory of how the women of England took up arms against the blind and\r\nobstinate Government of England and fought their way to political\r\nfreedom. I should like to live long enough to read such a history,\r\ncalmly considered, carefully analysed, conscientiously set forth. It\r\nwill be a better book to read than this one, written, as it were, in\r\ncamp between battles. But perhaps this one, hastily prepared as it has\r\nbeen, will give the reader of the future a clearer impression of the\r\nstrenuousness and the desperation of the conflict, and also something of\r\nthe heretofore undreamed of courage and fighting strength of women, who,\r\nhaving learned the joy of battle, lose all sense of fear and continue\r\ntheir struggle up to and past the gates of death, never flinching at any\r\nstep of the way.\r\n\r\nEvery step since that meeting in October, 1912, when we definitely\r\ndeclared war on the peace of England, has been beset with danger and\r\ndifficulty, often unexpected and undeclared. In October, 1913, I sailed\r\nin the French liner, _La Provence_, for my third visit to the United\r\nStates. My intention was published in the public press of England,\r\nFrance and America. No attempt at concealment of my purpose was made,\r\nand in fact, my departure was witnessed by two men from Scotland Yard.\r\nSome hints had reached my ears that an attempt would be made by the\r\nImmigration Officers at the port of New York to exclude me as an\r\nundesirable alien, but I gave little credit to these reports. American\r\nfriends wrote and cabled encouraging words, and so I passed my time\r\naboard ship quite peacefully, working part of the time, resting also\r\nagainst the fatigue always attendant on a lecture tour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. PANKHURST AND CHRISTABEL IN THE GARDEN OF\r\nCHRISTABEL'S HOME IN PARIS]\r\n\r\nWe came to anchor in the harbour of New York on October 26th, and there,\r\nto my astonishment, the Immigration authorities notified me that I was\r\nordered to Ellis Island to appear before a Board of Special Inquiry. The\r\nofficers who served the order of detention did so with all courtesy,\r\neven with a certain air of reluctance. They allowed my American\r\ntravelling companion, Mrs. Rheta Childe Dorr, to accompany me to the\r\nIsland, but no one, not even the solicitor sent by Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont\r\nto defend me, was permitted to attend me before the Board of Special\r\nInquiry. I went before these three men quite alone, as many a poor,\r\nfriendless woman, without any of my resources, has had to appear. The\r\nmoment of my entrance to the room I knew that extraordinary means had\r\nbeen employed against me, for on the desk behind which the Board sat I\r\nsaw a complete _dossier_ of my case in English legal papers. These\r\npapers may have been supplied by Scotland Yard, or they may have been\r\nsupplied by the Government. I cannot tell, of course. They sufficed to\r\nconvince the Board of Special Inquiry that I was a person of doubtful\r\ncharacter, to say the least of it, and I was informed that I should have\r\nto be detained until the higher authorities at Washington examined my\r\ncase. Everything was done to make me comfortable, the rooms of the\r\nCommissioner of Immigration being turned over to me and my companion.\r\nThe very men who found me guilty of moral obloquy--something of which no\r\nBritish jury has ever yet accused me--put themselves out in a number of\r\nways to make my detention agreeable. I was escorted all over the Island\r\nand through the quarters assigned detained immigrants, whose right to\r\nland in the United States is in question. The huge dining-rooms, the\r\nspotless kitchens and the admirably varied bill of fare interested and\r\nimpressed me. Nothing like them exists in any English institution.\r\n\r\nI remained at Ellis Island two and a half days, long enough for the\r\nCommissioner of Immigration at Washington to take my case to the\r\nPresident who instantly ordered my release. Whoever was responsible for\r\nmy detention entirely overlooked the advertising value of the incident.\r\nMy lecture tour was made much more successful for it and I embarked for\r\nEngland late in November with a very generous American contribution to\r\nour war chest, a contribution, alas, that I was not permitted to deliver\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nThe night before the White Star liner _Majestic_ reached Plymouth a\r\nwireless message from headquarters informed me that the Government had\r\ndecided to arrest me on my arrival. The arrest was made, under very\r\ndramatic conditions, the next day shortly before noon. The steamer came\r\nto anchor in the outer harbour, and we saw at once that the bay, usually\r\nso animated with passing vessels, had been cleared of all craft. Far in\r\nthe distance the tender, which on other occasions had always met the\r\nsteamer, rested at anchor between two huge grey warships. For a moment\r\nor two the scene halted, the passengers crowding to the deckrails in\r\nspeechless curiosity to see what was to happen next. Suddenly a\r\nfisherman's dory, power driven, dashed across the harbour, directly\r\nunder the noses of the grim war vessels. Two women, spray drenched,\r\nstood up in the boat, and as it ploughed swiftly past our steamer the\r\nwomen called out to me: \"The Cats are here, Mrs. Pankhurst! They're\r\nclose on you--\" Their voices trailed away into the mist and we heard no\r\nmore. Within a minute or two a frightened ship's boy appeared on deck\r\nand delivered a message from the purser asking me to step down to his\r\noffice. I answered that I would certainly do nothing of the kind, and\r\nnext the police swarmed out on deck and I heard, for the fifth time that\r\nI was arrested under the Cat and Mouse Act. They had sent five men from\r\nScotland Yard, two men from Plymouth and a wardress from Holloway, a\r\nsufficient number, it will be allowed, to take one woman from a ship\r\nanchored two miles out at sea.\r\n\r\nFollowing my firm resolve not to assist in any way the enforcing of the\r\ninfamous law, I refused to go with the men, who thereupon picked me up\r\nand carried me to the waiting police tender. We steamed some miles up\r\nthe Cornish coast, the police refusing absolutely to tell me whither\r\nthey were conveying me, and finally disembarked at Bull Point, a\r\nGovernment landing-stage, closed to the general public. Here a motor car\r\nwas waiting, and accompanied by my bodyguard from Scotland Yard and\r\nHolloway, I was driven across Dartmoor to Exeter, where I had a not\r\nunendurable imprisonment and hunger strike of four days. Everyone from\r\nthe Governor of the prison to the wardresses were openly sympathetic and\r\nkind, and I was told by one confidential official that they kept me only\r\nbecause they had orders to do so until after the great meeting at\r\nEmpress Theatre, Earls Court, London, which had been arranged as a\r\nwelcome home for me. The meeting was held on the Sunday night following\r\nmy arrest, and the great sum of L15,000 was poured into the coffers of\r\nmilitancy. This included the L4,500 which had been collected during my\r\nAmerican tour.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after my release from Exeter I went openly to Paris to\r\nconfer with my daughter on matters relating to the campaign about to\r\nopen, returning to attend a W. S. P. U. meeting on the day before my\r\nlicense expired. Nevertheless the boat train carriage in which I\r\ntravelled with my doctor and nurse was invaded at Dover town by two\r\ndetectives who told me to consider myself under arrest. We were making\r\ntea when the men entered, but this we immediately threw out of the\r\nwindow, because a hunger strike always began at the instant of arrest.\r\nWe never compromised at all, but resisted from the very first moment of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this uncalled for arrest at Dover was the fear on the\r\npart of the police of the body guard of women, just then organised for\r\nthe expressed purpose of resisting attempts to arrest me. That the\r\npolice, as well as the Government were afraid to risk encountering women\r\nwho were not afraid to fight we had had abundant testimony. We certainly\r\nhad it on this occasion, for knowing that the body guard was waiting at\r\nVictoria Station, the authorities had cut off all approaches to the\r\narrival platform and the place was guarded by battalions of police. Not\r\na passenger was permitted to leave a carriage until I had been carried\r\nacross the arrival platform between a double line of police and\r\ndetectives and thrown into a forty horse power motor car, guarded within\r\nby two plain clothes men and a wardress, and without by three more\r\npolicemen. Around this motor car were twelve taxi-cabs filled with plain\r\nclothes men, four to each vehicle, and three guarding the outside, not\r\nto mention the driver, who was also in the employ of the police\r\ndepartment. Detectives on motor cycles were on guard at various points\r\nready to follow any rescuing taxicab.\r\n\r\nArrived at Holloway I was again lifted from the car and taken to the\r\nreception room and placed on the floor in a state of great exhaustion.\r\nWhen the doctor came in and told me curtly to stand up I was obliged to\r\ntell him that I could not stand. I utterly refused to be examined,\r\nsaying that I was resolved to make the Government assume full\r\nresponsibility for my condition. \"I refuse to be examined by you or any\r\nprison doctor,\" I declared, \"and I do this as a protest against my\r\nsentence, and against my being here at all. I no longer recognise a\r\nprison doctor as a medical man in the proper sense of the word. I have\r\nwithdrawn my consent to be governed by the rules of prison; I refuse to\r\nrecognise the authority of any prison official, and I therefore make it\r\nimpossible for the Government to carry out the sentence they have\r\nimposed upon me.\"\r\n\r\nWardresses were summoned, I was placed in an invalid chair and so\r\ncarried up three flights of stairs and put into an unwarmed cell with a\r\nconcrete floor. Refusing to leave the chair I was lifted out and placed\r\non the bed, where I lay all night without removing my coat or loosening\r\nmy garments. It was on a Saturday that the arrest had been made, and I\r\nwas kept in prison until the following Wednesday morning. During all\r\nthat time no food or water passed my lips, and I added to this the sleep\r\nstrike, which means that as far as was humanly possible I refused all\r\nsleep and rest. For two nights I sat or lay on the concrete floor,\r\nresolutely refusing the oft repeated offers of medical examination. \"You\r\nare not a doctor,\" I told the man. \"You are a Government torturer, and\r\nall you want to do is to satisfy yourself that I am not quite ready to\r\ndie.\" The doctor, a new man since my last imprisonment, flushed and\r\nlooked extremely unhappy. \"I suppose you do think that,\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning the Governor came to look at me, and no doubt I\r\npresented by that time a fairly bad appearance. At least I gathered as\r\nmuch from the alarmed expression of the wardress who accompanied him. To\r\nthe Governor I made the simple announcement that I was ready to leave\r\nprison and that I intended to leave very soon, dead or alive. I told him\r\nthat from that moment I should not even rest on the concrete floor, but\r\nshould walk my cell until I was released or until I died from\r\nexhaustion. All day I kept to this resolution, pacing up and down the\r\nnarrow cell, many times stumbling and falling, until the doctor came in\r\nat evening to tell me that I was ordered released on the following\r\nmorning. Then I loosened my gown and lay down, absolutely spent, and\r\nfell almost instantly into a death-like sleep. The next morning a motor\r\nambulance took me to the Kingsway headquarters where a hospital room had\r\nbeen arranged for my reception. The two imprisonments in less than ten\r\ndays had made terrible drafts on my strength, and the coldness of the\r\nHolloway cell had brought on a painful neuralgia. It was many days\r\nbefore I recovered even a tithe of my usual health.\r\n\r\nThese two arrests resulted exactly as the Government should have known\r\nthat they would result, in a great outbreak of fresh militancy. As soon\r\nas the news spread that I had been taken at Plymouth a huge fire broke\r\nout in the timber yards at Richmond Walk, Devenport, and an acre and a\r\nhalf of timber, beside a pleasure fair and a scenic railway adjacent, to\r\nthe value of thousands of pounds was destroyed. No one ever discovered\r\nthe cause of the fire, the greatest that ever occurred in the\r\nneighbourhood, but tied to one of the railings was a copy of the\r\n_Suffragette_ and to another railing two cards, on one of which was\r\nwritten a message to the Government: \"How dare you arrest Mrs. Pankhurst\r\nand allow Sir Edward Carson and Mr. Bonar Law to go free?\" The second\r\ncard bore the words: \"Our reply to the torture of Mrs. Pankhurst, and\r\nher cowardly arrest at Plymouth.\"\r\n\r\nBesides this fire, which waged fiercely from midnight until dawn, a\r\nlarge unoccupied house at Bristol was destroyed by fire; a fine\r\nresidence in Scotland, also unoccupied, was badly damaged by fire; St.\r\nAnne's Church in a suburb of Liverpool was partly destroyed; and many\r\npillar boxes in London, Edinburgh, Derby and other cities were fired. In\r\nchurches all over the Kingdom our women created consternation by\r\ninterpolating into the services reverently spoken prayers for prisoners\r\nwho were suffering for conscience' sake. The reader no doubt has heard\r\nof these interruptions, and if so he has read of brawling, shrieking\r\nwomen, breaking into the sanctity of religious services, and creating\r\nriot in the House of God. I think the reader should know exactly what\r\ndoes happen when militants, who are usually religious women, interrupt\r\nchurch services. On the Sunday when I was in Holloway, following my\r\narrest at Dover, certain women attending the afternoon service at\r\nWestminster Abbey, chanted in concert the following prayer: \"God save\r\nEmmeline Pankhurst, help us with Thy love and strength to guard her,\r\nspare those who suffer for conscience' sake. Hear us when we pray to\r\nThee.\" They had hardly finished this prayer when vergers fell upon them\r\nand with great violence hustled them out of the Abbey. One kneeling man,\r\nwho happened to be near one of the women, forgot his Christian\r\nintercessions long enough to beat her in the face with his fists before\r\nthe vergers came.\r\n\r\nSimilar scenes have taken place in churches and cathedrals throughout\r\nEngland and Scotland, and in many instances the women have been most\r\nbarbarously treated by vergers and members of the congregations. In\r\nother cases the women not only have been left unmolested, but have been\r\nallowed to finish their prayers amid deep and sympathetic silence. Some\r\nclergymen have even been brave enough to add a reverent amen to these\r\nprayers for women in prison, and it has happened that clergymen have\r\nvoluntarily offered prayers for us. The Church as a whole, however, has\r\nundoubtedly failed to live up to its obligation to demand justice for\r\nwomen, and to protest against the torture of forcible feeding. During\r\nthe year just closing we sent many deputations to Church authorities,\r\nthe Bishops, one after another having been visited in this manner. Some\r\nof the Bishops, including the reactionary Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nrefused to accord the desired interview, and when that happened, the\r\nanswer of the deputation was to sit on the doorstep of the episcopal\r\nresidence until surrender followed--as it invariably did.\r\n\r\nAs Holloway Gaol is within his diocese, the Bishop of London was visited\r\nby the W. S. P. U. and the demand was made that the Bishop himself\r\nshould witness forcible feeding in order to realise the horror of the\r\nproceeding. He did visit two of the tortured women, but he did not see\r\nthem forcibly fed, and when he came out he gave the public an account of\r\nhis interview with them which was in effect the Government's version of\r\nthe facts. The W. S. P. U. was naturally indignant, while all the\r\nGovernment's friends hailed the Bishop as a supporter of the policy of\r\ntorture. Only those who have suffered the pain and agony, not to speak\r\nof the moral humiliation of forcible feeding can realise the depths of\r\nthe iniquity which the Bishop of London was manoeuvred by the\r\nGovernment to whitewash. It may be true, as the Bishop comforted himself\r\nby saying, that the victims of forcible feeding suffered the more\r\nbecause they struggled under the process. But, as Mary Richardson wrote\r\nin the _Suffragette_, to expect a victim not to struggle was the same as\r\ntelling her that she would suffer less if she did not jump on getting a\r\ncinder in her eye. \"The principle,\" declared Miss Richardson, \"is the\r\nsame. One struggles because the pain is excruciating, and the nerves of\r\nthe eyes, ears and face are so tortured that it would be impossible not\r\nto resist to the uttermost. One struggles, also, because of another\r\nreason--a moral reason--for forcible feeding is an immoral assault as\r\nwell as a painful physical one, and to remain passive under it would\r\ngive one the feeling of sin; the sin of concurrence. One's whole nature\r\nis revolted; resistance is therefore inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nI think it proper here to explain also the policy upon which we embarked\r\nin 1914 of taking our cause directly to the King. The reader has perhaps\r\nheard of Suffragette \"insults\" to King George and Queen Mary, and it is\r\nbut just that he should hear a direct account of how these \"insults\" are\r\noffered. Several isolated attempts had been made to present petitions to\r\nthe King, once when he was on his way to Westminster to open Parliament,\r\nand again on an occasion when he paid a visit to Bristol. On the latter\r\noccasion the woman who tried to present the petition was assaulted by\r\none of the King's equerries, who struck her with the flat of his sword.\r\n\r\nWe finally resolved on the policy of direct petition to the king because\r\nwe had been forced to abandon all hope of successful petitioning to his\r\nMinisters. Tricked and betrayed at every turn by the Liberal Government,\r\nwe announced that we would not again put even a pretence of confidence\r\nin them. We would carry our demand for justice to the throne of the\r\nMonarch. Late in December, 1913, while I was in prison for the second\r\ntime since my return to England, a great gala performance was given at\r\nCovent Garden, the opera being the Jeanne d'Arc of Raymond Roze. The\r\nKing and Queen and the entire Court were present, and the scene was\r\nexpected to be one of unusual brilliance. Our women took advantage of\r\nthe occasion to make one of the most successful demonstrations of the\r\nyear. A box was secured directly opposite the Royal Box, and this was\r\noccupied by three women, beautifully gowned. On entering they had\r\nmanaged, without attracting the slightest attention, to lock and\r\nbarricade the door, and at the close of the first act, as soon as the\r\norchestra had disappeared, the women stood up, and one of them, with the\r\naid of a megaphone, addressed the King. Calling attention to the\r\nimpressive scenes on the stage, the speaker told the King that women\r\nwere to-day fighting, as Joan of Arc fought centuries ago, for human\r\nliberty, and that they, like the maid of Orleans, were being tortured\r\nand done to death, in the name of the King, in the name of the Church,\r\nand with the full knowledge and responsibility of established\r\nGovernment. At this very hour the leader of these fighters in the army\r\nof liberty was being held in prison and tortured by the King's\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe vast audience was thrown into a panic of excitement and horror, and\r\namid a perfect turmoil of cries and adjurations, the door of the box was\r\nfinally broken down and the women ejected. As soon as they had left the\r\nhouse others of our women, to the number of forty or more, who had been\r\nsitting quietly in an upper gallery, rose to their feet and rained\r\nsuffrage literature on the heads of the audience below. It was fully\r\nthree quarters of an hour before the excitement subsided and the singers\r\ncould go on with the opera.\r\n\r\nThe sensation caused by this direct address to Royalty inspired us to\r\nmake a second attempt to arouse the King's conscience, and early in\r\nJanuary, as soon as Parliament re-assembled, we announced that I would\r\npersonally lead a deputation to Buckingham Palace. The plan was welcomed\r\nwith enthusiasm by our members and a very large number of women\r\nvolunteered to join the deputation, which was intended to make a protest\r\nagainst three things--the continued disfranchisement of women; the\r\nforcible feeding and the cat and mouse torture of those who were\r\nfighting against this injustice; and the scandalous manner in which the\r\nGovernment, while coercing and torturing militant women, were allowing\r\nperfect freedom to the men opponents of Home Rule in Ireland, men who\r\nopenly announced that they were about to carry out a policy, not merely\r\nof attacking property, but of destroying human life.\r\n\r\nI wrote a letter to the King, conveying to him \"the respectful and loyal\r\nrequest of the Women's Social and Political Union that Your Majesty will\r\ngive audience to a deputation of women.\" The letter went on: \"The\r\ndeputation desire to submit to Your Majesty in person their claim to the\r\nParliamentary vote, which is the only protection against the grievous\r\nindustrial and social wrongs that women suffer; is the symbol and\r\nguarantee of British citizenship; and means the recognition of women's\r\nequal dignity and worth, as members of our great Empire.\r\n\r\n\"The Deputation will further lay before Your Majesty a complaint of the\r\nmediaeval and barbarous methods of torture whereby Your Majesty's\r\nMinisters are seeking to repress women's revolt against the deprivation\r\nof citizen rights--a revolt as noble and glorious in its spirit and\r\npurpose as any of those past struggles for liberty which are the pride\r\nof the British race.\r\n\r\n\"We have been told by the unthinking--by those who are heedless of the\r\nconstitutional principles upon which is based our loyal request for an\r\naudience of Your Majesty in person--that our conversation should be with\r\nYour Majesty's Ministers.\r\n\r\n\"We repudiate this suggestion. In the first place, it would not only be\r\nrepugnant to our womanly sense of dignity, but it would be absurd and\r\nfutile for us to interview the very men against whom we bring the\r\naccusations of betraying the Women's Cause and torturing those who fight\r\nfor that Cause.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, we will not be referred to, and we will not\r\nrecognise the authority of men who, in our eyes, have no legal or\r\nconstitutional standing in the matter, because we have not been\r\nconsulted as to their election to Parliament nor as to their appointment\r\nas Ministers of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nI then cited as a precedent in support of our claim to be heard by the\r\nKing in person, the case of the Deputation of Irish Catholics, which, in\r\nthe year 1793, was received by King George III in person.\r\n\r\nI further said:\r\n\r\n\"Our right as women to be heard and to be aided by Your Majesty is far\r\nstronger than any such right possessed by men, because it is based upon\r\nour lack of every other constitutional means of securing the redress of\r\nour grievances. We have no power to vote for Members of Parliament, and\r\ntherefore for us there is no House of Commons. We have no voice in the\r\nHouse of Lords. But we have a King, and to him we make our appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Constitutionally speaking, we are, as voteless women, living in the\r\ntime when the power of the Monarch was unlimited. In that old time,\r\nwhich is passed for men though not for women, men who were oppressed had\r\nrecourse to the King--the source of power, of justice, and of reform.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely in the same way we now claim the right to come to the foot of\r\nthe Throne and to make of the King in person our demand for the redress\r\nof the political grievance which we cannot, and will not, any longer\r\ntolerate.\r\n\r\n\"Because women are voteless, there are in our midst to-day sweated\r\nworkers, white slaves, outraged children, and innocent mothers and their\r\nbabes stricken by horrible disease. It is for the sake and in the cause\r\nof these unhappy members of our sex, that we ask of Your Majesty the\r\naudience that we are confident will be granted to us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some days before we had the answer to this letter, and in the\r\nmeantime some uncommonly stirring and painful occurrences attracted the\r\npublic attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor months before my return to England from my American lecture tour,\r\nthe Ulster situation had been increasingly serious. Sir Edward Carson\r\nand his followers had declared that if Home Rule government should be\r\ncreated and set up in Dublin, they would--law or no law--establish a\r\nrival and independent Government in Ulster. It was known that arms and\r\nammunition were being shipped to Ireland, and that men--and women too,\r\nfor that matter--were drilling and otherwise getting ready for civil\r\nwar. The W. S. P. U. approached Sir Edward Carson and asked him if the\r\nproposed Ulster Government would give equal voting rights to women. We\r\nfrankly declared that in case the Ulster men alone were to have the\r\nvote, that we should deal with \"King Carson\" and his colleagues exactly\r\nin the same manner that we had adopted towards the British Government\r\ncentred at Westminster. Sir Edward Carson at first promised us that the\r\nrebel Ulster Government, should it come into existence, would give votes\r\nto Ulster women. This pledge was later repudiated, and in the early\r\nwinter months of 1914 militancy appeared in Ulster. It had been raging\r\nin Scotland for some time, and now the imprisoned Suffragettes in that\r\ncountry were being forcibly fed as in England. The answer to this was,\r\nof course, more militancy. The ancient Scottish church of Whitekirk, a\r\nrelic of pre-Reformation days, was destroyed by fire. Several unoccupied\r\ncountry houses were also burned.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, February, 1914, that I undertook a series of\r\nmeetings outside London, the first of which was to be held in Glasgow,\r\nin the St. Andrews Hall, which holds many thousands of people. In order\r\nthat I might be free on the night of the meeting, I left London unknown\r\nto the police, in a motor car. In spite of all efforts to apprehend me I\r\nsucceeded in reaching Glasgow and in getting to the platform of St.\r\nAndrews' where I found myself face to face with an enormous, and\r\nmanifestly sympathetic audience.\r\n\r\nAs it was suspected that the police might rush the platform, plans had\r\nbeen made to offer resistance, and the bodyguard was present in force.\r\nMy speech was one of the shortest I have ever made. I said:\r\n\r\n\"I have kept my promise, and in spite of His Majesty's Government I am\r\nhere to-night. Very few people in this audience, very few people in this\r\ncountry, know how much of the nation's money is being spent to silence\r\nwomen. But the wit and ingenuity of women is overcoming the power and\r\nmoney of the British Government. It is well that we should have this\r\nmeeting to-night, because to-day is a memorable day in the annals of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. To-day in the House of\r\nCommons has been witnessed the triumph of militancy--men's\r\nmilitancy--and to-night I hope to make it clear to the people in this\r\nmeeting that if there is any distinction to be drawn at all between\r\nmilitancy in Ulster and the militancy of women, it is all to the\r\nadvantage of the women. Our greatest task in this women's movement is to\r\nprove that we are human beings like men, and every stage of our fight is\r\nforcing home that very difficult lesson into the minds of men, and\r\nespecially into the minds of politicians. I propose to-night at this\r\npolitical meeting to have a text. Texts are usually given from pulpits,\r\nbut perhaps you will forgive me if I have a text to-night. My text is:\r\n'Equal justice for men and women, equal political justice, equal legal\r\njustice, equal industrial justice, and equal social justice.' I want as\r\nclearly and briefly as I can to make it clear to you to-night that if it\r\nis justifiable to fight for common ordinary equal justice, then women\r\nhave ample justification, nay, have greater justification, for\r\nrevolution and rebellion, than ever men have had in the whole history of\r\nthe human race. Now that is a big contention to make, but I am going to\r\nprove it. You get the proof of the political injustice--\"\r\n\r\nAs I finished the word \"injustice,\" a steward uttered a warning shout,\r\nthere was a tramp of heavy feet, and a large body of police burst into\r\nthe hall, and rushed up to the platform, drawing their truncheons as\r\nthey ran. Headed by detectives from Scotland Yard, they surged in on all\r\nsides, but as the foremost members attempted to storm the platform, they\r\nwere met by a fusillade of flower-pots, tables, chairs, and other\r\nmissiles. They seized the platform railing, in order to tear it down,\r\nbut they found that under the decorations barbed wires were concealed.\r\nThis gave them pause for a moment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, more of the invading host came from other directions. The\r\nbodyguard and members of the audience vigorously repelled the attack,\r\nwielding clubs, batons, poles, planks, or anything they could seize,\r\nwhile the police laid about right and left with their batons, their\r\nviolence being far the greater. Men and women were seen on all sides\r\nwith blood streaming down their faces, and there were cries for a\r\ndoctor. In the middle of the struggle, several revolver shots rang out,\r\nand the woman who was firing the revolver--which I should explain was\r\nloaded with blank cartridges only--was able to terrorise and keep at bay\r\na whole body of police.\r\n\r\nI had been surrounded by members of the bodyguard, who hurried me\r\ntowards the stairs from the platform. The police, however, overtook us,\r\nand in spite of the resistance of the bodyguard, they seized me and\r\ndragged me down the narrow stair at the back of the hall. There a cab\r\nwas waiting. I was pushed violently into it, and thrown on the floor,\r\nthe seats being occupied by as many constables as could crowd inside.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was left in a state of tremendous turmoil, and the people of\r\nGlasgow who were present expressed their sense of outrage at the\r\nbehavior of the police, who, acting under the Government's instructions,\r\nhad so disgraced the city. General Drummond, who was present on the\r\nplatform, took hold of the situation and delivered a rousing speech, in\r\nwhich she exhorted the audience to make the Government feel the force of\r\ntheir indignation.\r\n\r\nI was kept in the Glasgow police-cells all night, and the next morning\r\nwas taken, a hunger and thirst striking prisoner, to Holloway, where I\r\nremained for five memorable days. This was the seventh attempt the\r\nGovernment had made to make me serve a three years' term of penal\r\nservitude on a conspiracy charge, in connection with the blowing up of\r\nMr. Lloyd-George's country house. In the eleven and a half months since\r\nI had received that sentence I had spent just thirty days in prison. On\r\nMarch 14th I was again released, still suffering severely, not only from\r\nthe hunger and thirst strike, but from injuries received at the time of\r\nmy brutal arrest in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThe answer to that arrest had been swift and strong. In Bristol, the\r\nscene of great riots and destruction when men were fighting for votes, a\r\nlarge timber-yard was burnt. In Scotland a mansion was destroyed by\r\nfire. A milder protest consisted of a raid upon the house of the Home\r\nSecretary, in the course of which eighteen windows were broken.\r\n\r\nThe greatest and most startling of all protests hitherto made was the\r\nattack at this time on the Rokeby \"Venus\" in the National Gallery. Mary\r\nRichardson, the young woman who carried out this protest, is possessed\r\nof a very fine artistic sense, and nothing but the most compelling sense\r\nof duty would have moved her to the deed. Miss Richardson being placed\r\non trial, made a moving address to the Court, in the course of which she\r\nsaid that her act was premeditated, and that she had thought it over\r\nvery seriously before it was undertaken. She added: \"I have been a\r\nstudent of art, and I suppose care as much for art as any one who was in\r\nthe gallery when I made my protest. But I care more for justice than I\r\ndo for art, and I firmly believe than when a nation shuts its eyes to\r\njustice, and prefers to have women who are fighting for justice\r\nill-treated, mal-treated, and tortured, that such action as mine should\r\nbe understandable; I don't say excusable, but it should be understood.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to point out that the outrage which the Government has\r\ncommitted upon Mrs. Pankhurst is an ultimatum of outrages. It is murder,\r\nslow murder, and premeditated murder. That is how I have looked at\r\nit....\r\n\r\n\"How you can hold women up to ridicule and contempt, and put them in\r\nprison, and yet say nothing to the Government for murdering people, I\r\ncannot understand....\r\n\r\n\"The fact is that the nation is either dead or asleep. In my opinion\r\nthere is undoubted evidence that the nation is dead, because women have\r\nknocked in vain at the door of administrators, archbishops, and even the\r\nKing himself. The Government have closed all doors to us. And remember\r\nthis--a state of death in a nation, as well as in an individual, leads\r\nto one thing, and that is dissolution. I do not hesitate to say that if\r\nthe men of the country do not at this eleventh hour put their hand out\r\nand save Mrs. Pankhurst, before a few more years are passed they will\r\nstretch out their hand in vain to save the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nIn sentencing Miss Richardson to six month's imprisonment the\r\nMagistrate said regretfully that if she had smashed a window instead of\r\nan art treasure he could have given her a maximum sentence of eighteen\r\nmonths, which illustrates, I think, one more queer anomaly of English\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later another famous painting, the Sargent portrait of Henry\r\nJames, was attacked by a Suffragette, who, like Miss Richardson, was\r\nsent through the farce of a trial and a prison sentence which she did\r\nnot serve. By this time practically all the picture galleries and other\r\npublic galleries and museums had been closed to the public. The\r\nSuffragettes had succeeded in large measure in making England\r\nunattractive to tourists, and hence unprofitable to the world of\r\nbusiness. As we had anticipated, the reaction against the Liberal\r\nGovernment began to manifest itself. Questions were asked daily, in the\r\npress, in the House of Commons, everywhere, as to the responsibility of\r\nthe Government in the Suffragette activities. People began to place that\r\nresponsibility where it belonged, at the doors of the Government, rather\r\nthan at our own.\r\n\r\nEspecially did the public begin to contrast the treatment meted out to\r\nthe rebel women with that accorded to the rebel men of Ulster. For a\r\nwhole year the Government had been attacking the women's right of free\r\nspeech, by their refusal to allow the W. S. P. U. to hold public\r\nmeetings in Hyde Park. The excuse given for this was that we advocated\r\nand defended a militant policy. But the Government permitted the Ulster\r\nmilitants to advocate their war policy in Hyde Park, and we determined\r\nthat, with or without the Government's permission, we should, on the\r\nday of the Ulster meeting, hold a suffrage meeting in Hyde Park. General\r\nDrummond was announced as the chief speaker at this meeting, and when\r\nthe day came, militant Ulster men and militant women assembled in Hyde\r\nPark. The militant men were allowed to speak in defence of bloodshed;\r\nbut General Drummond was arrested before she had uttered more than a few\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAnother proof that the Government had a law of leniency for militant men\r\nand a law of persecution for militant women was shown at this time by\r\nthe case of Miss Dorothy Evans, our organiser in Ulster. She and another\r\nSuffragette, Miss Maud Muir, were arrested in Belfast charged with\r\nhaving in their possession a quantity of explosives. It was well known\r\nthat there were houses in Belfast that secreted tons of gunpowder and\r\nammunition for the use of the rebels against Home Rule, but none of\r\nthose houses were entered and searched by the police. The authorities\r\nreserved their energies in this direction for the headquarters of the\r\nmilitant women. Naturally enough the two suffrage prisoners, on being\r\narraigned in court, refused to be tried unless the Government proceeded\r\nalso against the men rebels. The prisoners throughout the proceedings\r\nkept up such a disturbance that the trial could not properly go on. When\r\nthe case was called Miss Evans rose and protested loudly, saying: \"I\r\ndeny your jurisdiction entirely until there are in the dock beside us\r\nmen who are well known leaders of the Ulster militant movement.\" Miss\r\nMuir joined Miss Evans in her protest and both women were dragged from\r\nthe court. After an hour's adjournment the trial was resumed, but the\r\nwomen again began to speak, and the case was hurried through in the\r\nmidst of indescribable din and commotion. The women were sent to prison\r\non remand, and after a four days' hunger and thirst strike were released\r\nunconditionally.\r\n\r\nThe result of this case was a severe outbreak of militancy, three fires\r\ndestroying Belfast mansions within a few days. Fires blazed almost daily\r\nthroughout England, a very important instance being the destruction of\r\nthe Bath Hotel at Felixstowe, valued at L35,000. The two women\r\nresponsible for this were afterwards arrested, and as their trials were\r\ndelayed, they were, although unconvicted prisoners, tortured by forcible\r\nfeeding for several months. This occurred in April, a few weeks before\r\nthe day appointed for our deputation to the King.\r\n\r\nI had appointed May 21st for the deputation, in spite of the fact that\r\nthe King had, through his Ministers, refused to receive us. Replying to\r\nthis I had written, again directly to the King, that we utterly denied\r\nthe constitutional right of Ministers, who not being elected by women\r\nwere not responsible to them, to stand between ourselves and the Throne,\r\nand to prevent us from having an audience of His Majesty. I declared\r\nfurther that we would, on the date announced, present ourselves at the\r\ngates of Buckingham Palace to demand an interview.\r\n\r\nFollowing the despatch of this letter my life was made as uncomfortable\r\nand as insecure as the Government, through their police department,\r\ncould contrive. I was not allowed to make a public appearance, but I\r\naddressed several huge meetings from the balcony of houses where I had\r\ntaken refuge. These were all publicly announced, and each time the\r\npolice, mingling with crowds, made strenuous efforts to arrest me. By\r\nstrategy, and through the valiant efforts of the bodyguard, I was able\r\neach time to make my speech and afterwards to escape from the house. All\r\nof these occasions were marked by fierce opposition from the police and\r\nsplendid courage and resistance on the part of the women.\r\n\r\nThe deputation to the King was, of course, marked by the Government as\r\nan occasion on which I could be arrested, and when, on the day\r\nappointed, I led the great deputation of women to the gates of\r\nBuckingham Palace, an army of several thousand police were sent out\r\nagainst us. The conduct of the police showed plainly that they had been\r\ninstructed to repeat the tactics of Black Friday, described in an\r\nearlier chapter. Indeed, the violence, brutality and insult of Black\r\nFriday were excelled on this day, and at the gates of the King of\r\nEngland. I myself did not suffer so greatly as others, because I had\r\nadvanced towards the Palace unnoticed by the police, who were looking\r\nfor me at a more distant point. When I arrived at the gates I was\r\nrecognised by an Inspector, who at once seized me bodily, and conveyed\r\nme to Holloway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (C) _International News Service_\r\n\r\n\"ARRESTED AT THE KING'S GATE!\" _May, 1914_]\r\n\r\nBefore the Deputation had gone forth, I had made a short speech to them,\r\nwarning them of what might happen, and my final message was: \"Whatever\r\nhappens, do not turn back.\" They did not, and in spite of all the\r\nviolence inflicted upon them, they went forward, resolved, so long as\r\nthey were free, not to give up the attempt to reach the Palace. Many\r\narrests were made, and of those arrested many were sent to prison.\r\nAlthough for the majority, this was the first imprisonment, these brave\r\nwomen adopted the hunger strike, and passed seven or eight days without\r\nfood and water before they were released, weak and ill as may be\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the weeks following the disgraceful events before Buckingham Palace\r\nthe Government made several last, desperate efforts to crush the\r\nW. S. P. U., to remove all the leaders and to destroy our paper, the\r\n_Suffragette_. They issued summonses against Mrs. Drummond, Mrs. Dacre\r\nFox and Miss Grace Roe; they raided our headquarters at Lincolns Inn\r\nHouse; twice they raided other headquarters temporarily in use, not to\r\nspeak of raids made upon private dwellings where the new leaders, who\r\nhad risen to take the places of those arrested, were at their work for\r\nthe organisation. But with each successive raid the disturbances which\r\nthe Government were able to make in our affairs became less, because we\r\nwere better able, each time, to provide against them. Every effort made\r\nby the Government to suppress the _Suffragette_ failed, and it continued\r\nto come out regularly every week. Although the paper was issued\r\nregularly, we had to use almost super-human energy to get it\r\ndistributed. The Government sent to all the great wholesale news agents\r\na letter which was designed to terrorise and bully them into refusing to\r\nhandle the paper or to sell it to the retail news agents. Temporarily,\r\nat any rate, the letter produced in many cases the desired effect, but\r\nwe overcame the emergency by taking immediate steps to build up a\r\nsystem of distribution which was worked by women themselves,\r\nindependently of the newspaper trade. We also opened a \"Suffragette\r\nDefence Fund,\" to meet the extra expense of publishing and distributing\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nTwice more the Government attempted to force me to serve the three\r\nyears' term of penal servitude, one arrest being made when I was being\r\ncarried to a meeting in an ambulance. Wholesale arrests and hunger\r\nstrikes occurred at the same time, but our women continued their work of\r\nmilitancy, and money flowed into our Protest and Defence Fund. At one\r\ngreat meeting in July the fund was increased by nearly L16,000.\r\n\r\nBut now unmistakable signs began to appear that our long and bitter\r\nstruggle was drawing to a close. The last resort of the Government of\r\ninciting the street mobs against us had been little successful, and we\r\ncould see in the temper of the public abundant hope that the reaction\r\nagainst the Government, long hoped for by us, had actually begun.\r\n\r\nEvery day of the militant movement was so extraordinarily full of events\r\nand changes that it is difficult to choose a point at which this\r\nnarrative should be brought to a close. I think, however, that an\r\naccount of a recent debate which took place in the House of Commons will\r\ngive the reader the best idea of the complete breakdown of the\r\nGovernment in their effort to crush the women's fight for liberty.\r\n\r\nOn June 11th, when the House of Commons had gone into a Committee of\r\nSupply, Lord Robert Cecil moved a reduction of 100 pounds on the Home\r\nOffice vote, thus precipitating a discussion of militancy. Lord Robert\r\nsaid that he had read with some surprise that the Government were not\r\ndissatisfied with the measures which they had taken to deal with the\r\nviolent suffragists, and he added with some asperity that the Government\r\ntook a much more sanguine view of the matter than anybody else in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The House, Lord Robert went on to declare, would not be\r\nin a position to deal with the case satisfactorily unless they realised\r\nthe devotion of the followers to their leaders, who were almost fully\r\nresponsible for what was going on. Ministerial cheers greeted this\r\nutterance, but they ceased suddenly when the speaker went on to say that\r\nthese leaders could never have induced their followers to enter upon a\r\ncareer of crime but for the serious mistakes which had been made over\r\nand over again by the Government. Among these mistakes Lord Robert cited\r\nthe shameful treatment of the women on Black Friday, the policy of\r\nforcible feeding and the scandal of the different treatment accorded\r\nLady Constance Lytton and \"Jane Warton.\" There were Opposition cheers at\r\nthis, and they were again raised when Lord Robert deplored the terrible\r\nwaste of energy, and \"admirable material\" involved in the militant\r\nmovement. Although Lord Robert Cecil deemed it unjust as well as futile\r\nfor Suffragist Members to withhold their support from the woman suffrage\r\nmovement on account of militancy he himself was in favor of deportation\r\nfor Suffragettes. At this there were cries of \"Where to?\" and \"Ulster!\"\r\n\r\nMr. McKenna replied by first calling attention to the fact that in the\r\nmilitant movement they had a phenomenon \"absolutely without precedent in\r\nour history.\" Women in numbers were committing crimes, beginning with\r\nwindow breaking, and proceeding to arson, not with the motives of\r\nordinary criminals, but with the intention of advertising a political\r\ncause and of forcing the public to grant their demands. Mr. McKenna\r\ncontinuing said:\r\n\r\n\"The number of women who commit crimes of that kind is extremely small,\r\nbut the number of those who sympathise with them is extremely large. One\r\nof the difficulties which the police have in detecting this form of\r\ncrime and in bringing home the offence to the criminal is that the\r\ncriminals find so many sympathisers among the well-to-do and thoroughly\r\nrespectable classes that the ordinary administration of the law is\r\nrendered comparatively impossible. Let me give the House some figures\r\nshowing the number of women who have been committed to prison for\r\noffences since the beginning of the militant agitation in 1906. In that\r\nyear the total number of commitments to prison was 31, all the persons\r\ncharged being women. In 1909 the figure rose to 156; in 1911 to 188 (182\r\nwomen and six men); and in 1912 to 290 (288 women and two men). In 1913\r\nthe number dropped to 183, and so far this year it has dropped to 108.\r\nThese figures include all commitments to prison and rearrests under the\r\nCat and Mouse Act. What is the obvious lesson to be drawn? Up to 1912\r\nthe number of offences committed for which imprisonment was the\r\npunishment was steadily increasing, but since the beginning of last\r\nyear--that is to say, since the new Act came into force--the number of\r\nindividual offences has been very greatly reduced. On the other hand, we\r\nsee that the seriousness of the offences is much greater.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement, that the number of imprisonments had decreased since the\r\nadoption of the Cat and Mouse Act, was of course, incorrect, or at best\r\nmisleading. The fact was that the number of imprisonments decreased\r\nbecause, where formerly the militants went willingly to prison for their\r\nacts, they now escaped prison wherever possible. A comparatively small\r\nnumber of \"mice\" were ever rearrested by the police.\r\n\r\nMr. McKenna went on to say that he realised fully the growing sense of\r\nindignation against the militant suffragists and he added, \"Their one\r\nhope is, rightly or wrongly, that the well advertised indignation of the\r\npublic will recoil on the head of the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so it will,\" interpolated a voice.\r\n\r\n\"My honourable friend,\" replied Mr. McKenna, \"says so it will. I believe\r\nthat he is mistaken.\" But he gave no reasons for so believing. Referring\r\nto what he called the \"recent grave rudenesses which have been committed\r\nagainst the King,\" Mr. McKenna said: \"It is true that all subjects have\r\nthe right of petitioning His Majesty, providing the petition is couched\r\nin respectful terms, but there is no right on the part of the subjects\r\ngenerally to personal audience for the purpose of the presentation of\r\nthe petition or otherwise. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to\r\npresent all such petitions to the King, and further to advise His\r\nMajesty what action should be taken. It was therefore ridiculous for any\r\nSuffragist to assert that there had been any breach of constitutional\r\npropriety on the part of the King in refusing, on the advice of the Home\r\nSecretary to receive the deputation.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, said Mr. McKenna, in view of the fact that the petition for an\r\naudience was sent by a person under sentence of penal\r\nservitude--myself--it was the plain duty of the Home Secretary to advise\r\nthe King not to grant it. He referred to the incident, he said, only\r\nbecause it was illustrative of the militant's methods of advertising\r\ntheir cause. He gave them credit, he was bound to say, for a certain\r\ndegree of intelligence in adopting their methods. \"No action has been so\r\nfruitful of advertisement as the recent absurdities which they have\r\nperpetrated in relation to the King.\"\r\n\r\nComing down to the question of methods of meeting and overcoming\r\nmilitancy, Mr. McKenna said that he had received an almost unlimited\r\ncorrespondence on the subject from every section of the public. \"Four\r\nmethods were suggested,\" said he. \"The first is to let them die. (Hear,\r\nhear.) That is, I should say, at the present moment, the most popular\r\n(laughter), judging by the number of letters I have received. The second\r\nis to deport them. (Hear, hear.) The third is to treat them as lunatics.\r\n(Hear, hear.) And the fourth is to give them the franchise. (Hear, hear,\r\nand laughter.) I think that is an exhaustive list. I notice each one of\r\nthem is received with a certain very moderate amount of applause in this\r\nHouse. I hope to give reason why at the present time I think we should\r\nnot adopt any one of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion was usually, not always, based on the assumption\r\nthat the women would take their food if they knew that the alternative\r\nwas death. Mr. McKenna read to the House in opposition to that view \"the\r\nopinion of a great medical expert who had had intimate knowledge of the\r\nSuffragettes from the first.\" \"We have to face the fact, therefore, that\r\nthey would die,\" continued Mr. McKenna.\r\n\r\n\"Let me say, also, with actual experience of dealing with suffragists,\r\nin many cases they have got in their refusal of food and water beyond\r\nthe point when they could help themselves, and they have clearly done\r\nall that they could do to show their readiness to die.... There are\r\nthose who hold another assumption. They think that after one or two\r\ndeaths in prison militancy would cease. In my judgment there was never a\r\ngreater delusion. I readily admit that this is the issue upon which I\r\nstand and upon which I feel I would fight to the end those who would\r\nadopt as their policy to let the prisoners die. So far from putting an\r\nend to militancy, I believe it would be the greatest incentive to\r\nmilitancy which could ever happen. For every woman who dies, there would\r\nbe scores of women who would come forward for the honour, as they would\r\ndeem it, of earning the crown of martyrdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" called out an Opposition member.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know?\" retorted the Home Secretary. \"I have had more to do\r\nwith these women than the honourable member, much more. Those who hold\r\nthat opinion leave out of account all recognition of the nature of these\r\nwomen. I do not speak in admiration of them. They are hysterical\r\nfanatics, but, coupled with their hysterical fanaticism, they have a\r\ncourage, part of their fanaticism, which undoubtedly stands at nothing,\r\nand the honourable member who thinks that they would not come forward,\r\nnot merely to risk death, but to undergo it, for what they deem the\r\ngreatest cause on earth is making, in my judgment, a profound\r\nmistake.... They would seek death, and I am sure that however strong\r\npublic opinion outside might be to-day in favour of allowing them to\r\ndie, when there were twenty, thirty, forty, or more deaths in prison,\r\nyou would have a violent reaction of public opinion, and the honourable\r\ngentleman who now so glibly says 'Let them die' would be among the first\r\nto blame the Government for what he would describe as the inhuman\r\nattitude they had adopted.\r\n\r\n\"That policy,\" continued Mr. McKenna, \"could not be adopted without an\r\nAct of Parliament. For the reason I have given I have not asked\r\nParliament to remove from prison officials the responsibility under\r\nwhich they now rest for doing their best to keep those committed to\r\ntheir charge alive. But, supposing this legal responsibility were\r\nremoved from the prison officials, let honourable members for a moment\r\ntransport themselves in imagination to a prison cell and conceive of a\r\nprison doctor, a humane man, standing by watching a woman slowly being\r\ndone to death by starvation and thirst, knowing that he could help her\r\nand that he could keep her alive. Did they think that any doctor would\r\ngo on with such action, or that we should be able to retain medical men\r\nunder such conditions in our service? I do not believe it.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor would think, as I should think if I saw a woman lying there,\r\n'What has been this woman's offence?' It may have been obstructing the\r\npolice, coupled with the obstinacy derived from fanaticism which leads\r\nher to refuse food and water. Obstructing the police and she is to die!\r\nI could not distinguish, and no Home Secretary could ever say, that this\r\nwoman should be left to die and that that woman should not. Once we were\r\ncommitted to a policy of allowing them to die if they did not take their\r\nfood we should have to go on with it, and we should have woman after\r\nwoman whose only offence may have been obstructing the police, breaking\r\na window, or even burning down an empty house, dying because she was\r\nobstinate. I do not believe that that is a policy which on consideration\r\nwill ever recommend itself to the British people, and I am bound to say\r\nfor myself I could never take a hand in carrying that policy out.\"\r\n(Cheers.)\r\n\r\nLord Robert Cecil's favourite remedy of deportation Mr. McKenna\r\ndismissed on the grounds that this would be merely removing the\r\ndifficulty to some other country than Great Britain. If the suggested\r\ndistant island were treated as a prison the women would hunger strike\r\nthere as they did in English prisons. If the island were not treated as\r\na prison, the Suffragettes' rich friends would come and rescue them in\r\nyachts.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the militants be treated as lunatics was also\r\ndismissed as impossible. Admitting that he had tried to get them\r\ncertified as lunatics and had failed because the medical profession\r\nwould not consent to such a course, Mr. McKenna said that he could not,\r\ncontrary to the advice of the doctors, get certification by Act of\r\nParliament. \"There remains,\" said Mr. McKenna, \"the last proposal, that\r\nwe should give them the franchise.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the right one,\" exclaimed Mr. William Redmond, but the Home\r\nSecretary replied:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be said as to the merits or demerits of that proposal, it\r\nis clearly not one I can discuss now in Committee of Supply. I am not\r\nresponsible, as Home Secretary, for the state of the law on the\r\nfranchise, nor is there any occasion for me to express or conceal my own\r\nopinions on the point; but I certainly do not think, and I am sure the\r\nCommittee will agree with me, that that could be seriously treated as a\r\nremedy for the existing state of lawlessness.\"\r\n\r\nComing at last to the constructive part of his speech Mr. McKenna told\r\nthe House of Commons that the Government had one last resort, which was\r\nto take legal proceedings against subscribers to the funds of the\r\nW. S. P. U. The funds of the society, he said, were undoubtedly beyond\r\nthe arm of the British law. But the Government were in hopes of stopping\r\nfuture subscriptions. \"We are now not without hope,\" he concluded, \"that\r\nwe have evidence which will enable us to proceed against the\r\nsubscribers\" (loud cheers) \"in civil action, and if we succeed the\r\nsubscribers will become personally liable for all the damage done.\"\r\n(Cheers.) \"It is a question of evidence.... I have further directed that\r\nthe question should be considered whether the subscribers could not be\r\nproceeded against criminally as well as by civil action.\" (Cheers.) \"We\r\nhave only been able to obtain this evidence by our now not infrequent\r\nraids upon the offices, and such property as we can get at of the\r\nsociety.... A year ago a raid was made on the offices of the society,\r\nbut we obtained no such evidence. If we succeed in making the\r\nsubscribers personally responsible individually for the whole damage\r\ndone I have no doubt that the insurance companies will quickly follow\r\nthe example set them by the Government, and in turn bring actions to\r\nrecover the cost which has been thrown upon them. If that is done I have\r\nno doubt the days of militancy are over.\r\n\r\n\"The militants live only by the subscriptions of rich women\" (cheers)\r\n\"who themselves enjoy all the advantages of wealth secured for them by\r\nthe labour of others\" (cheers) \"and use their wealth against the\r\ninterests of society, paying their unfortunate victims to undergo all\r\nthe horrors of a hunger and thirst strike in the commission of a crime.\r\nWhatever feelings we may have against the wretched women who for 30s.\r\nand L2 a week go about the country burning and destroying, what must our\r\nfeelings be for the women who give their money to induce the\r\nperpetration of these crimes and leave their sisters to undergo the\r\npunishment while they live in luxury?\" (Cheers.) \"If we can succeed\r\nagainst them we will spare no pains. If the action is successful in the\r\ntotal destruction of the means of revenue of the Women's Social and\r\nPolitical Union I think we shall see the last of the power of Mrs.\r\nPankhurst and her friends.\" (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nIn the general debate which followed the Government were obliged to\r\nlisten to very severe criticisms of their past and present policy\r\ntowards the militant women. Mr. Keir Hardie said in part:\r\n\r\n\"We may not to-day discuss the question of the franchise, but surely it\r\nwas possible for the Home Secretary, without any transgression on the\r\nrules of the House, to have held out just a ray of hope for the future\r\nas to the intentions of the Government in regard to this most urgent\r\nquestion. On that point, may I say that I am not one of those who\r\nbelieve that a right thing should be withheld because some of the\r\nadvocates of it resort to weapons of which we do not approve. That note\r\nhas been sounded more than once, and if it be true, and it is true, that\r\na section of the public outside are strongly opposed to this conduct, it\r\nis equally true that the bulk of the people look with a very calm and\r\nindifferent eye upon what is happening so long as the vote is withheld\r\nfrom women.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hardie concluded by regretting that the House, instead of discussing\r\nWoman Suffrage, was discussing methods of penalising militant women.\r\n\r\nMr. Rupert Gwynne said: \"Nobody is in a more ridiculous position than\r\nthe members on the Treasury Bench. They cannot address a meeting, or go\r\nto a railway station, or even get into a taxicab, without having\r\ndetectives with them. Even if they like it, we, the public do not,\r\nbecause we have to pay for it. It is not worth the expense that it costs\r\nto have a detective staff following Cabinet Ministers wherever they go,\r\nwhether in a private or a public capacity.\r\n\r\n\"Further,\" said Mr. Gwynne, \"if the Home Secretary is correct in saying\r\nthat these women are prepared to die, and invite death, in order to\r\nadvertise their devotion to their cause, does he really think they are\r\ngoing to mind if their funds are attached?\"\r\n\r\nAnother friend of the Suffragists, Mr. Wedgwood said: \"We are dealing\r\nwith a problem which is a very serious one indeed. To my mind, when you\r\nfind a large body of public opinion, and a large number of people\r\ncapable of going to these lengths, there is only one thing for a\r\nrespectable House of Commons to do, and that is to consider very closely\r\nand clearly whether the complaints of those who complain are or are not\r\njustified. We are not justified in acting in panic. What it is our duty\r\nto do is to consider the rights and wrongs of these people who have\r\nacted in this way. I attribute myself no value to the vote, but I do\r\nthink that when we seriously consider the question of Woman Suffrage,\r\nwhich has not been done by this House up to the present, we should\r\nremember that when you see people capable of this amount of\r\nself-sacrifice, that the one duty of the House of Commons is not to\r\nstamp the iron heel upon them, but to see how far their cause is just,\r\nand to act according to justice.\"\r\n\r\nWhen such a debate as this was possible in the House of Commons, it must\r\nbe plain to every disinterested reader that militancy never set the\r\ncause of suffrage back, but on the contrary, set it forward at least\r\nhalf a century. When I remember how that same House of Commons, a few\r\nyears ago, treated the mention of woman suffrage with scorn and\r\ncontempt, how they permitted the most insulting things to be said of the\r\nwomen who were begging for their political freedom, how, with indecent\r\nlaughter and coarse jokes they allowed suffrage bills to be talked out,\r\nI cannot but marvel at the change our militancy so quickly brought\r\nabout. Mr. McKenna's speech was in itself a token of the complete\r\nsurrender of the Government.\r\n\r\nOf course the promise of the Home Secretary that subscribers to our\r\nfunds should, if possible, be held legally responsible for damage done\r\nto private property by the Suffragettes, was never meant to be adhered\r\nto. It was, in fact, a perfectly absurd promise, and I think that very\r\nfew Members of Parliament were deceived by it. Our subscribers can\r\nalways remain anonymous if they choose, and if it should ever be\r\npossible to attack them for our deeds, they would naturally take refuge\r\nbehind that privilege.\r\n\r\nOur battles are practically over, we confidently believe. For the\r\npresent at least our arms are grounded, for directly the threat of\r\nforeign war descended on our nation we declared a complete truce from\r\nmilitancy. What will come out of this European war--so terrible in its\r\neffects on the women who had no voice in averting it--so baneful in the\r\nsuffering it must necessarily bring on innocent children--no human being\r\ncan calculate. But one thing is reasonably certain, and that is that the\r\nCabinet changes which will necessarily result from warfare will make\r\nfuture militancy on the part of women unnecessary. No future Government\r\nwill repeat the mistakes and the brutality of the Asquith Ministry. None\r\nwill be willing to undertake the impossible task of crushing or even\r\ndelaying the march of women towards their rightful heritage of political\r\nliberty and social and industrial freedom.\r\n\r\nTHE END",
