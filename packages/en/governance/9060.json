Only those speeches are included which\r\nare generally admitted to be the work of Demosthenes, and the spurious\r\ndocuments contained in the MSS. of the Speech on the Crown are omitted.\r\nThe speeches are arranged in chronological order, and the several\r\nintroductions to them are intended to supply an outline of the history\r\nof the period, sufficient to provide a proper setting for the speeches,\r\nbut not more detailed than was necessary for this purpose. No\r\ndiscussion of conflicting evidence has been introduced, and the views\r\nwhich are expressed on the character and work of Demosthenes must\r\nnecessarily seem somewhat dogmatic, when given without the reasons for\r\nthem. I hope, however, before long to treat the life of Demosthenes\r\nmore fully in another form. The estimate here given of his character as\r\na politician falls midway between the extreme views of Grote and\r\nSchäfer on the one hand, and Beloch and Holm on the other.\r\n\r\nI have tried to render the speeches into such English as a political\r\norator of the present day might use, without attempting to impart to\r\nthem any antique colouring, such as the best-known English translations\r\neither had from the first or have acquired by lapse of time. It is of\r\nthe essence of political oratory that it is addressed to\r\ncontemporaries, and the translation of it should therefore be into\r\ncontemporary English; though the necessity of retaining some of the\r\nmodes of expression which are peculiar to Greek oratory and political\r\nlife makes it impossible to produce completely the appearance of an\r\nEnglish orator's work. The qualities of Demosthenes' eloquence\r\nsometimes suggest rather the oratory of the pulpit than that of the\r\nhustings or that of Parliament and of the law-courts. I cannot hope to\r\nhave wholly succeeded in my task; but it seemed to be worth\r\nundertaking, and I hope that the work will not prove to have been\r\naltogether useless.\r\n\r\nI have made very little use of other translations; but I must\r\nacknowledge a debt to Lord Brougham's version of the Speeches on the\r\nChersonese and on the Crown, which, though often defective from the\r\npoint of view of scholarship and based on faulty texts, are (together\r\nwith his notes) very inspiring. I have also, at one time or another,\r\nconsulted most of the standard German, French, and English editions of\r\nDemosthenes. I cannot now distinguish how much I owe to each; but I am\r\nconscious of a special debt to the editions of the late Professor Henri\r\nWeil, and of Sir J.E. Sandys, and (in the Speech on the Crown) to that\r\nof Professor W.W. Goodwin. I also owe a few phrases in the earliest\r\nspeeches to Professor W.R. Hardie, whose lectures on Demosthenes I\r\nattended twenty years ago. My special thanks are due to my friend Mr.\r\nP.E. Matheson of New College, for his kindness in reading the\r\nproof-sheets, and making a number of suggestions, which have been of\r\ngreat assistance to me.\r\n\r\nThe text employed has been throughout that of the late Mr. S.H. Butcher\r\nin the _Bibliotheca Classica Oxoniensis_. Any deviations from this are\r\nnoted in their place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                 i. 7\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPEECHES TRANSLATED\r\n\r\n  Traditional Order                   In this Edition\r\n  ORATION I.

In preparing\r\nfor these proceedings he had the assistance of Isaeus, a teacher and\r\nwriter of speeches who was remarkable for his knowledge of law, his\r\ncomplete mastery of all the aspects of any case with which he had to\r\ndo, and his skill in dealing with questions of ownership and\r\ninheritance. Demosthenes' speeches against his guardians show plainly\r\nthe influence of Isaeus, and the teacher may have developed in his\r\npupil the thoroughness and the ingenuity in handling legal arguments\r\nwhich afterwards became characteristic of his work.\r\n\r\nApart from this litigation with his guardians, we know little of\r\nDemosthenes' youth and early manhood. Various stories have come down to\r\nus (for the most part not on the best authority), of his having been\r\ninspired to aim at an orator's career by the eloquence and fame of\r\nCallistratus; of his having overcome serious physical defects by\r\nassiduous practice; of his having failed, nevertheless, owing to\r\nimperfections of delivery, in his early appearances before the people,\r\nand having been enabled to remedy these by the instruction of the\r\ncelebrated actor Satyrus; and of his close study of the _History_ of\r\nThucydides. Upon the latter point the evidence of his early style\r\nleaves no room for doubt, and the same studies may have contributed to\r\nthe skill and impressiveness with which, in nearly every oration, he\r\nappeals to the events of the past, and sums up the lessons of history.\r\nWhether he came personally under the influence either of Plato, the\r\nphilosopher, or of Isocrates, the greatest rhetorical teacher of his\r\ntime, and a political pamphleteer of high principles but little\r\npractical insight, is much more doubtful. The two men were almost as\r\ndifferent in temperament and aims as it was possible to be, but\r\nDemosthenes' familiarity with the published speeches of Isocrates, and\r\nwith the rhetorical principles which Isocrates taught and followed, can\r\nscarcely be questioned.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of his manhood, Demosthenes undertook the\r\ncomposition of speeches for others who were engaged in litigation. This\r\ntask required not only a very thorough knowledge of law, but the power\r\nof assuming, as it were, the character of each separate client, and\r\nwriting in a tone appropriate to it; and, not less, the ability to\r\ninterest and to rouse the active sympathy of juries, with whom feeling\r\nwas perhaps as influential as legal justification. This part, however,\r\nof Demosthenes' career only concerns us here in so far as it was an\r\nadmirable training for his later work in the larger sphere of politics,\r\nin which the same qualities of adaptability and of power both to argue\r\ncogently and to appeal to the emotions effectively were required in an\r\neven higher degree.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Demosthenes' interest in public affairs was beginning\r\nto take an active form, Athens was suffering from the recent loss of\r\nsome of her most powerful allies. In the year 358 B.C. she had counted\r\nwithin the sphere of her influence not only the islands of Lemnos,\r\nImbros, and Scyros (which had been guaranteed to her by the Peace of\r\nAntalcidas in 387), but also the chief cities of Euboea, the islands of\r\nChios, Cos, Rhodes, and Samos, Mytilene in Lesbos, the towns of the\r\nChersonese, Byzantium (a city of the greatest commercial importance),\r\nand a number of stations on the south coast of Thrace, as well as\r\nPydna, Potidaea, Methone, and the greater part of the country bordering\r\nupon the Thermaic Gulf. But her failure to observe the terms of\r\nalliance, laid down when the new league was founded in 378, had led to\r\na revolt, which ended in 355 or 354 in the loss to her of Chios, Cos,\r\nRhodes, and Byzantium, and of some of the ablest of her own commanders,\r\nand left her treasury almost empty. About the same time Mytilene and\r\nCorcyra also took the opportunity to break with her. Moreover, her\r\nposition in the Thermaic region was threatened first by Olynthus, at\r\nthe head of the Chalcidic League, which included over thirty towns; and\r\nsecondly by Philip, the newly-established King of Macedonia, who seemed\r\nlikely to displace both Olynthus and Athens from their positions of\r\ncommanding influence.[1]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Athens, though unable to face a strong combination, was\r\nprobably the most powerful single state in Greece. In her equipment and\r\ncapacity for naval warfare she had no rival, and certainly no other\r\nstate could vie with her in commercial activity and prosperity. The\r\npower of Sparta in the Peloponnese had declined greatly. The\r\nestablishment of Megalopolis as the centre of a confederacy of Arcadian\r\ntribes, and of Messene as an independent city commanding a region once\r\nentirely subject to Sparta, had seriously weakened her position; while\r\nat the same time her ambition to recover her supremacy kept alive a\r\nfeeling of unrest throughout the Peloponnese. Of the other states of\r\nSouth Greece, Argos was hostile to Sparta, Elis to the Arcadians;\r\nCorinth and other less important cities were not definitely attached to\r\nany alliance, but were not powerful enough to carry out any serious\r\nmovement alone. In North Greece, Thebes, though she lacked great\r\nleaders, was still a great power, whose authority throughout Boeotia\r\nhad been strengthened by the complete or partial annihilation of\r\nPlatacae, Thespiae, Orchomenus,[2] and Coroneia. In Athens the ill\r\nfeeling against Thebes was strong, owing to the occupation by the\r\nThebans of Oropus,[2] a frontier town which Athens claimed, and their\r\ntreatment of the towns just mentioned, towards which the Athenians were\r\nkindly disposed. The Phocians, who had until recently been unwilling\r\nallies of Thebes, were now hostile and not insignificant neighbours,\r\nand about this time entered into relations with both Sparta and Athens.\r\nThe subject of contention was the possession or control of the Temple\r\nof Apollo at Delphi, which the Phocians had recently taken by force\r\nfrom the Delphians, who were supported by Thebes; and in the 'Sacred\r\nWar' to which this act (which was considered to be sacrilege) gave rise\r\nin 355 B.C., the Thebans and Locrians fought against the Phocians in\r\nthe name of the Amphictyonic Council, a body (composed of\r\nrepresentatives of tribes and states of very unequal importance[3]) to\r\nwhich the control of the temple traditionally belonged. Thessaly\r\nappears to have been at this time more or less under Theban influence,\r\nbut was immediately dominated by the tyrants of Pherae, though the\r\nseveral cities seem each to have possessed a nominally independent\r\ngovernment. The Greek peoples were disunited in fact and unfitted for\r\nunion by temperament. The twofold desire, felt by almost all the more\r\nadvanced Greek peoples, for independence on the one hand, and for\r\n'hegemony' or leadership among other peoples, on the other, rendered\r\nany effective combination impossible, and made the relations of states\r\nto one another uncertain and inconstant. While each people paid respect\r\nto the spirit of autonomy, when their own autonomy was in question,\r\nthey were ready to violate it without scruple when they saw their way\r\nto securing a predominant position among their neighbours; and although\r\nthe ideal of Panhellenic unity had been put before Greece by Gorgias\r\nand Isocrates, its realization did not go further than the formation of\r\nleagues of an unstable character, each subject, as a rule, to the more\r\nor less tyrannical domination of some one member.\r\n\r\nProbably the power which was most generally feared in the Greek world\r\nwas that of the King of Persia. Several times in recent years (and\r\nparticularly in 387 and 367) he had been requested to make and enforce\r\na general settlement of Hellenic affairs. The settlement of 387 (called\r\nthe King's Peace, or the Peace of Antalcidas, after the Spartan officer\r\nwho negotiated it) had ordained the independence of the Greek cities,\r\nsmall and great, with the exception of those in Asia Minor, which were\r\nto form part of the Persian Empire, and of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros,\r\nwhich were to belong to Athens as before. The attempt to give effect to\r\nthe arrangement negotiated in 367 failed, and the terms of the Peace of\r\nAntalcidas, though it was still appealed to, when convenient, as a\r\ncharter of liberty, also came to be disregarded. But there was always a\r\nsense of the possibility or the danger of provoking the great king to\r\nexert his strength, or at least to use his wealth, to the detriment of\r\nsome or all of the Greek states; though at the moment of which we are\r\nspeaking (about 355) the Persian Empire itself was suffering from\r\nrecent disorders and revolutions, and the king had little leisure for\r\ninterfering in the affairs of Greece.\r\n\r\nIt was to the department of foreign and inter-Hellenic affairs that\r\nDemosthenes principally devoted himself. His earliest political\r\nspeeches, however, were composed and delivered in furtherance of\r\nprosecutions for the crime of proposing illegal legislation. These were\r\nthe speeches against Androtion (spoken by Diodorus in 355) and against\r\nLeptines (in 354). Both these were written to denounce measures which\r\nDemosthenes regarded as dishonest or unworthy of Athenian traditions.\r\nIn the former he displays that desire for clean-handed administration\r\nwhich is so prominent in some of his later speeches; and in the\r\nprosecution of Leptines he shows his anxiety that Athens should retain\r\nher reputation for good faith. Both speeches, like those of the year\r\n352 against Timocrates (spoken by Diodorus), and against Aristocrates\r\n(spoken by Euthycles), are remarkable for thoroughness of argument and\r\nfor the skill which is displayed in handling legal and political\r\nquestions, though, like almost all Athenian forensic orations, they are\r\nsometimes sophistical in argument.\r\n\r\nThe first speech which is directly devoted to questions of external\r\npolicy is that on the Naval Boards in 354; and this is followed within\r\nthe next two years by speeches delivered in support of appeals made to\r\nAthens by the people of Megalopolis and by the exiled democratic party\r\nof Rhodes. From these speeches it appears that the general lines of\r\nDemosthenes' policy were already determined. He was in opposition to\r\nEubulus, who, after the disastrous termination of the war with the\r\nallies, had become the leading statesman in Athens. The strength of\r\nEubulus lay in his freedom from all illusion as to the position in\r\nwhich Athens stood, in his ability as a financier, and in his readiness\r\nto take any measures which would enable him to carry out his policy. He\r\nsaw that the prime necessity of the moment was to recruit the financial\r\nand material strength of the city; that until this should be effected,\r\nshe was quite incapable of carrying on war with any other power; and\r\nthat she could only recover her strength through peace. In this policy\r\nhe had the support of the well-to-do classes, who suffered heavily in\r\ntime of war from taxation and the disturbance of trade. On the other\r\nhand, the sentiments of the masses were imperialistic and militant. We\r\ngather that there were plenty of orators who made a practice of\r\nappealing to the glorious traditions of the past and the claim always\r\nmade by Athens to leadership among the Greek states. To buy off the\r\nopposition which his policy might be expected to encounter, Eubulus\r\ndistributed funds freely to the people, in the shape of\r\n'Festival-money', adopting the methods employed before him by\r\ndemagogues, very different from himself, in order that he might\r\noverride the real sentiments of the democracy; and in spite of the\r\nlarge amounts thus spent he did in fact succeed, in the course of a few\r\nyears, in collecting a considerable sum without resorting to\r\nextraordinary taxation, in greatly increasing the navy and in enlarging\r\nthe dockyards. For the success of this policy it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to avoid all entanglement in war, except under the strongest\r\ncompulsion. The appeals of the Megalopolitans and the Rhodians, to\r\nyield to which would probably have meant war with Sparta and with\r\nPersia, must be rejected. Even in dealing with Philip, who was making\r\nhimself master of the Athenian allies on the Thermaic coast, the fact\r\nof the weakness of Athens must be recognized, and all idea of a great\r\nexpedition against Philip must be abandoned for the present. At the\r\nsame time, some necessary measures of precaution were not neglected. It\r\nwas essential to secure the route to the Euxine, over which the\r\nAthenian corn-trade passed, if corn was not to be sold at famine\r\nprices. For this purpose, therefore, alliance was made with the\r\nThracian prince, Cersobleptes; and when Philip threatened Heraeon\r\nTeichos on the Propontis, an expedition was prepared, and was only\r\nabandoned because Philip himself was forced to desist from his attempt\r\nby illness. Similarly, when Philip appeared likely to cross the Pass of\r\nThermopylae in 352, an Athenian force was sent (on the proposal of\r\nDiophantus, a supporter of Eubulus) to prevent him. The failure of\r\nEubulus and his party to give effective aid to Olynthus against Philip\r\nwas due to the more pressing necessity of attempting to recover control\r\nof Euboea: it had clearly been their intention to save Olynthus, if\r\npossible. But when this had proved impossible, and the attempt to form\r\na Hellenic league against Philip had also failed, facts had once more\r\nto be recognized; and, since Athens was now virtually isolated, peace\r\nmust be made with Philip on the only terms which he would accept--that\r\neach side should keep what it _de facto_ possessed at the time.\r\n\r\nDemosthenes was generally in opposition to Eubulus and his party, of\r\nwhich Aeschines (once an actor and afterwards a clerk, but a man of\r\neducation and great natural gifts) was one of the ablest members.\r\nDemosthenes was inspired by the traditions of the past, but had a much\r\nless vague conception of the moral to be drawn from them than had the\r\nmultitude. Athens, for him as for them, was to be the first state in\r\nHellas; she was above all to be the protectress of democracy\r\neverywhere, against both absolutism and oligarchy, and the leader of\r\nthe Hellenes in resistance to foreign aggression. But, unlike the\r\nmultitude, Demosthenes saw that this policy required the greatest\r\npersonal effort and readiness for sacrifice on the part of every\r\nindividual; and he devotes his utmost energies to the task of arousing\r\nhis countrymen to the necessary pitch of enthusiasm, and of effecting\r\nsuch reforms in administration and finance as, in his opinion, would\r\nmake the realization of his ideal for Athens possible. In the speeches\r\nfor the Megalopolitans and the Rhodians, the nature of this ideal is\r\nalready becoming clear both in its Athenian and in its Panhellenic\r\naspects. But so soon as it appeared that Philip, at the head of the\r\nhalf-barbarian Macedonians, and not Athens, was likely to become the\r\npredominant power in the Hellenic world, it was against Philip that all\r\nhis efforts were directed; and although in 346 he is practically at one\r\nwith the party of Eubulus in his recognition of the necessity of peace,\r\nhe is eager, when the opportunity seems once more to offer itself, to\r\nresume the conflict, and, when it is resumed, to carry it through to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nWe have then before us the sharp antagonism of two types of\r\nstatesmanship. The strength of the one lies in the recognition of\r\nactual facts, and the avoidance of all projects which seem likely,\r\nunder existing circumstances, to fail. The other is of a more sanguine\r\ntype, and believes in the power of enthusiasm and self-sacrifice to\r\ntransform the existing facts into something better, and to win success\r\nagainst all odds. Statesmen of the former type are always attacked as\r\nunpatriotic and mean-spirited; those of the latter, as unpractical and\r\nreckless. There is truth and falsehood in both accusations: but since\r\nno statesman has ever combined all the elements of statesmanship in a\r\nperfect and just proportion, and since neither prudence and\r\nclear-sightedness, nor enthusiastic and generous sentiment, can ever be\r\ndispensed with in the conduct of affairs without loss, a larger view\r\nwill attach little discredit to either type. While, therefore, we may\r\nview with regret some of the methods which both Demosthenes and\r\nAeschines at times condescended to use in their conflicts with one\r\nanother, and with no less regret the disastrous result of the policy\r\nwhich ultimately carried the day, we need not hesitate to give their\r\ndue to both of the contending parties: nor, while we recognize that\r\nEubulus and Phocion (his sturdiest supporter in the field and in\r\ncounsel) took the truer view of the situation, and of the character of\r\nthe Athenians as they were, need we (as it is now fashionable to do)\r\ndenounce the orator who strove with unstinting personal effort and\r\nself-sacrifice to rouse the Athenians into a mood in which they could\r\nand would realize the ideal to which they, no less than he, professed\r\ntheir devotion.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties in the way of such a realization were wellnigh\r\ninsuperable. Neither the political nor the military system of Athens\r\nwas adapted to such a policy. The Sovereign Assembly, though capable of\r\nsensible and energetic action at moments of special danger, was more\r\nlikely to be moved by feeling and prejudice than by businesslike\r\nargument, particularly at a time when the tendency of the best educated\r\nand most intelligent men was to withdraw from participation in public\r\nlife; and meeting, as the Assembly did (unless specially summoned),\r\nonly at stated intervals, it was incapable of taking such rapid,\r\nwell-timed, and decisive action as Philip could take, simply because he\r\nwas a single man, sole master of his own policy, and personally in\r\ncommand of his own forces. The publicity which necessarily attached to\r\nthe discussions of the Assembly was a disadvantage at a time when many\r\nplans would better have been kept secret; and rapid modifications of\r\npolicy, to suit sudden changes in the situation, were almost\r\nimpossible. Again, while no subjects are so unsuited under any\r\ncircumstances for popular discussion as foreign and military affairs,\r\nthe absence in Athens of a responsible ministry greatly increased the\r\ndifficulties of her position. It is true that the Controller of the\r\nFestival Fund (whose office gradually became more and more important)\r\nwas now appointed for four years at a time, while all other offices\r\nwere annual; and that he and his friends, and their regular opponents,\r\nwere generally ready to take the lead in making proposals to the\r\nCouncil or the Assembly. But if they chose to remain silent, they could\r\ndo so;[4] no one was bound to make any proposal at all; and, on the\r\nother hand, any one might do so. With such a want of system, far too\r\nmuch was left to chance or to the designs of interested persons.\r\nMoreover, the Assembly felt itself under no obligation to follow for\r\nany length of time any lead which might be given to it, or to maintain\r\nany continuity or consistency between its own decrees. In modern times,\r\na minister, brought into power by the will of the majority of the\r\npeople, can reckon for a considerable period upon the more or less\r\nloyal support of the majority for himself and his official colleagues.\r\nIn Athens the leader of the moment had to be perpetually adapting\r\nhimself afresh to the mood of the Assembly, and even to deceive it, in\r\norder that he might lead at all, or carry out the policy which, in his\r\nopinion, his country's need required. It is therefore a remarkable\r\nthing that both Eubulus and Demosthenes succeeded for many years in\r\nmaintaining a line of action as consistent as that taken by practical\r\nmen can ever be.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Council of Five Hundred, which acted as a standing\r\ncommittee of the people, and prepared business for the Assembly and was\r\nresponsible for the details of measures passed by the Assembly in\r\ngeneral form, was chosen by lot and changed annually, as did\r\npractically all the civil and the military officials (though the latter\r\nmight be re-elected), was all against efficiency and continuity of\r\npolicy.[5] After the system of election by lot, the most characteristic\r\nfeature of the Athenian democracy was the responsibility of statesmen\r\nand generals to the law-courts.[6] Any citizen might accuse them upon\r\ncharges nominally limited in scope, but often serving in reality to\r\nbring their whole career into question. Had it been certain that the\r\ncourts would only punish incompetence or misconduct, and not failure as\r\nsuch, little harm would have resulted. But although there were very\r\nmany acquittals in political trials, the uncertainty of the issue was\r\nso great, and the sentences inflicted upon the condemned so severe\r\n(commonly involving banishment at least), that the liability to trial\r\nas a criminal must often have deterred the statesman and the general\r\nfrom taking the most necessary risks; while the condemnation of the\r\naccused had usually the result of driving a really able man out of the\r\ncountry, and depriving his fellow countrymen of services which might be\r\nurgently required when they were no longer available.\r\n\r\nThe financial system was also ill adapted for the purposes of a people\r\nconstantly liable to war. The funds required for the bare needs of a\r\ntime of peace seem indeed to have been sufficiently provided from\r\npermanent sources of income (such as the silver mines, the rent of\r\npublic lands, court fees and fines, and various indirect taxes): but\r\nthose needed for war had to be met by a direct tax upon property,\r\nlevied _ad hoc_ whenever the necessity arose, and not collected without\r\ndelays and difficulties. And although the equipment of ships for\r\nservice was systematically managed under the trierarchic laws,[7] it\r\nwas still subject to delays no less serious. There was no regular\r\nsystem of contribution to State funds, and no systematic accumulation\r\nof a reserve to meet military needs. The raising of money by means of\r\nloans at interest to the State was only adopted in Greece in a few\r\nisolated instances:[8] and the practice of annually distributing\r\nsurplus funds to the people,[9] however necessary or excusable under\r\nthe circumstances, was wholly contrary to sound finance.\r\n\r\nAn even greater evil was the dependence of the city upon mercenary\r\nforces and generals, whose allegiance was often at the call of the\r\nhighest bidder, and in consequence was seldom reliable. There is no\r\ndemand which Demosthenes makes with greater insistence, than the demand\r\nthat the citizens themselves shall serve with the army. At a moment of\r\nsupreme danger, they might do so. But in fact Athens had become more\r\nand more an industrial state, and men were not willing to leave their\r\nbusiness to take care of itself for considerable periods, in order to\r\ngo out and fight, unless the danger was very urgent, or the interests\r\nat stake of vital importance; particularly now that the length of\r\ncampaigns had become greater and the seasons exempted from military\r\noperations shorter. In many minds the spread of culture, and of the\r\nideal of self-culture, had produced a type of individualism indifferent\r\nto public concerns, and contemptuous of political and military\r\nambitions. Moreover, the methods of warfare had undergone great\r\nimprovement; in most branches of the army the trained skill of the\r\nprofessional soldier was really necessary; and it was not possible to\r\nleave the olive-yard or the counting-house and become an efficient\r\nfighter without more ado. But the expensiveness of the mercenary\r\nforces; the violent methods by which they obtained supplies from\r\nfriends and neutrals, as well as foes, if, as often happened, their pay\r\nwas in arrear; and the dependence of the city upon the goodwill of\r\ngenerals and soldiers who could without much difficulty find employment\r\nunder other masters, were evils which were bound to hamper any attempt\r\nto give effect to a well-planned and far-sighted scheme of action.\r\n\r\nIt also resulted from the Athenian system of government that the\r\ngeneral, while obviously better informed of the facts of the military\r\nsituation than any one else could be, and at the same time always\r\nliable to be brought to trial in case of failure, had little influence\r\nupon policy, unless he could find an effective speaker to represent\r\nhim. In the Assembly and in the law-courts (where the juries were large\r\nenough to be treated in the same manner as the Assembly itself) the\r\norator who could win the people's ear was all powerful, and expert\r\nknowledge could only make itself felt through the medium of oratory.\r\n\r\nA constitution which gave so much power to the orator had grave\r\ndisadvantages. The temptation to work upon the feelings rather than to\r\nappeal to the reason of the audience was very strong, and no charge is\r\nmore commonly made by one orator against another than that of deceiving\r\nor attempting to deceive the people. It is, indeed, very difficult to\r\njudge how far an Athenian Assembly was really taken in by sophistical\r\nor dishonest arguments: but it is quite certain that such arguments\r\nwere continually addressed to it; and the main body of the citizens can\r\nscarcely have had that first-hand knowledge of facts, which would\r\nenable them to criticize the orator's statements. Again, the oration\r\nappealed to the people as a performance, no less than as a piece of\r\nreasoning. Ancient political oratory resembled the oratory of the\r\npulpit at the present day, not only because it appealed perpetually to\r\nthe moral sense, and was in fact a kind of preaching; but also because\r\nthe main difficulty of the ancient orator and the modern preacher was\r\nthe same: for the Athenians liked being preached at, as the modern\r\ncongregation 'enjoys' a good sermon, and were, therefore, almost\r\nequally immune against conversion. The conflicts of rival orators were\r\nregarded mainly as an entertainment. The speaker who was most likely to\r\ncarry the voting (except when a great crisis had roused the Assembly to\r\nseriousness) was the one who found specious and apparently moral\r\nreasons for doing what would give the audience least trouble; and\r\nconsequently one who, like Demosthenes, desired to stir them up to\r\naction and personal sacrifices, had always an uphill fight: and if he\r\nalso at times 'deceived the people' or employed sophistical arguments\r\nin order to secure results which he believed to be for their good, we\r\nmust remember the difficulty (which, in spite of the wide circulation\r\nof authentic information, is at least equally great at the present day)\r\nof putting the true reasons for or against a policy, before those who,\r\nwhether from want of education or from lack of training in the\r\nsubordination of feeling to thought, are not likely to understand or to\r\nlisten to them. Nor, if we grant the genuineness of Demosthenes'\r\nconviction as to the desirability of the end for which he contended,\r\ncan many statesmen be pointed out, who have not been at least as guilty\r\nas he in their choice of means. That he did not solve the problem, how\r\nto lead a democracy by wholly honest means, is the less to his\r\ndiscredit, in that the problem still remains unsolved.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that with an audience like the Athenian, whose\r\naesthetic sensitiveness was doubtless far greater than that of any\r\nmodern assembly, delivery counted for much. Aeschines' fine voice was a\r\nreal danger to Demosthenes, and Demosthenes himself spoke of delivery,\r\nor the skilled acting of his part, as the all-important condition of an\r\norator's success. But it is clear that this can have been no advantage\r\nfrom the standpoint of the public interest.\r\n\r\nIn the law-courts the drawbacks to which the commanding influence of\r\noratory was liable were intensified. In the Assembly a certain amount\r\nof reticence and self-restraint was imposed by custom: an opponent\r\ncould not be attacked by name or on purely personal grounds; and an\r\nappearance of impartiality was commonly assumed. But in the courts much\r\ngreater play was allowed to feeling; and the arguments were often much\r\nmore disingenuous, not only because the personal interests at stake\r\nmade the speaker more unscrupulous, but also, perhaps, because the\r\njuries ordinarily included a larger proportion of the poorer, the\r\nidler, and the less-educated citizens than the Assembly. The legal\r\nquestion was often that to which the jury were encouraged to pay least\r\nattention, and the condemnation or acquittal of the accused was\r\ndemanded upon grounds quite extraneous to the indictment. (The two\r\ncourt-speeches contained in these volumes afford abundant illustrations\r\nof this.) Personalities were freely admitted, of a kind which it is\r\ndifficult to excuse and impossible to justify. To attempt to blacken\r\nthe personal character of an opponent by false stories about his\r\nparentage and his youth, and by the ascription to him and his relations\r\nof nameless immoralities, is a very different thing from the assignment\r\nof wrong motives for his political actions, though even in purely\r\npolitical controversy the ancients far exceeded the utmost limits of\r\nmodern invective. And this both Demosthenes and Aeschines do freely.\r\nThere is also reason to suspect that some of the tales which each tells\r\nof the other's conduct, both while serving as ambassadors and on other\r\noccasions, may be fabrications. The descriptive passages for which such\r\nfalsehoods gave an opening had doubtless their dramatic value in the\r\noratorical performance: possibly they were even expected by the\r\nlisteners; but their presence in the speeches does not increase our\r\nadmiration either for the speaker or for his audience.\r\n\r\nAll the force of Demosthenes' oratory was unable to defeat the great\r\nantagonist of his country. To Philip of Macedon failure was an\r\ninconceivable idea. Resident during three impressionable years of his\r\nyouth at Thebes, he had there learned, from the example of Epaminondas,\r\nwhat a single man could do: and he proceeded to each of the three great\r\ntasks of his life--the welding of the rough Macedonians into one great\r\nengine of war, the unification of Greece under his own leadership, and\r\nthe preparation for the conquest of the East by a united Greece and\r\nMacedonia--without either faltering in face of difficulties, or\r\nhesitating, out of any scrupulosity, to use the most effective means\r\ntowards the end which he wished at the moment to achieve; though in\r\nfact the charges of bad faith made against him by Demosthenes are found\r\nto be exaggerated, when they are impartially examined. Philip intended\r\nto become master of Greece: Demosthenes realized this early, and, with\r\nall the Hellenic detestation of a master, resolved to oppose him to the\r\nend. Philip was, indeed, in spite of the barbarous traits which\r\nrevealed themselves in him at times, not only gracious and courteous by\r\nnature, but a sincere admirer of Hellenic--in other words, of\r\nAthenian--culture; the relations between his house and the people of\r\nAthens had generally been friendly; and there was little reason to\r\nsuppose that, if he conquered Athens, he would treat her less\r\nhandsomely than in fact he did. Yet this could not justify one who\r\nregarded freedom as Demosthenes regarded it, in making any concession\r\nnot extorted by the necessities of the situation: his duty and his\r\ncountry's duty, as he conceived it, was to defeat the enemy of Hellenic\r\nindependence or to fall in the attempt. Nor was it for him to consider\r\n(as Isocrates might) whether or no Philip's plans had now developed\r\ninto, or could be transformed into, a beneficent scheme for the\r\nconquest of the barbarian world by a united Hellas, if the union was to\r\nbe achieved at the price of Athenian liberty. It is because, in spite\r\nof errors and of the questionable methods to which he sometimes\r\nstooped, Demosthenes devoted himself unflinchingly to the cause of\r\nfreedom, for Athens and for the Hellenes as a whole, that he is\r\nentitled, not merely as an orator but as a politician, to the\r\nadmiration which posterity has generally accorded him. It is, above\r\nall, by the second part of his career, when his policy of antagonism to\r\nPhilip had been accepted by the people, and he was no longer in\r\nopposition but, as it were, in office, that Demosthenes himself claims\r\nto be justified; and Aeschines' attempt to invalidate the claim is for\r\nthe most part unconvincing.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to describe in a few paragraphs the characteristics of\r\nDemosthenes as an orator. That he stands on the highest eminence that\r\nan orator has ever reached is generally admitted. But this is not to\r\nsay that he was wholly free from faults. His contemporaries, as well as\r\nlater Greek critics, were conscious of a certain artificiality in his\r\neloquence. It was, indeed, the general custom of Athenian orators to\r\nprepare their speeches with great care: the speakers who, like\r\nAeschines and Demades, were able to produce a great effect without\r\npreparation, and the rhetoricians who, like Alcidamas, thought of the\r\nstudied oration as but a poor imitation of true eloquence, were only a\r\nsmall minority; and in general, not only was the arrangement of topics\r\ncarefully planned, but the greatest attention was paid to the sound and\r\nrhythm of the sentences, and to the appropriateness and order of the\r\nwords. The orator had also his collections of passages on themes which\r\nwere likely to recur constantly, and of arguments on either side of\r\nmany questions; and from these he selected such passages as he\r\nrequired, and adapted them to his particular purpose. The rhetorical\r\nteachers appear to have supplied their pupils with such collections; we\r\nfind a number of instances of the repetition of the same passage in\r\ndifferent speeches, and an abundance of arguments formed exactly on the\r\nmodel of the precepts contained in rhetorical handbooks.[10] Yet with\r\nall this art nothing was more necessary than that a speech should\r\nappear to be spontaneous and innocent of guile. There was a general\r\nmistrust of the 'clever speaker', who by study or rhetorical training\r\nhad learned the art of arguing to any point, and making the worse cause\r\nappear the better. To have studied his part too carefully--even to have\r\nworked up illustrations from history and poetry--might expose the\r\norator to suspicion.[11] Demosthenes, in spite of his frequent attempts\r\nto deprecate such suspicion, did not succeed wholly in keeping on the\r\nsafe side. Aeschines describes him as a wizard and a sophist, who\r\nenjoyed deceiving the people or the jury. Another of his opponents\r\nlevelled at him the taunt that his speeches 'smelt of the lamp'.\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, one of the best of the ancient critics,\r\nsays that the artificiality of Demosthenes and his master Isaeus was\r\napt to excite suspicion, even when they had a good case. Nor can a\r\nmodern reader altogether escape the same impression. Sometimes,\r\nespecially in the earlier speeches to the Assembly, the argument seems\r\nunreal, the joints between the previously prepared commonplaces or\r\nillustrations and their application to the matter in hand are too\r\nvisible, the language is artificially phrased, and wanting in\r\nspontaneity and ease. There are also parts of the court speeches in\r\nwhich the orator seems to have calculated out all the possible methods\r\nof meeting a particular case, and to be applying them in turn with more\r\ningenuity than convincingness. An appearance of unreality also arises\r\nat times (again principally in the earlier speeches) from a certain\r\nwant of imagination. He attributes feelings and motives to others,\r\nwhich they were really most unlikely to have entertained, and argues\r\nfrom them. Some of the sentiments which he expects Artaxerxes or\r\nArtemisia to feel (in the Speeches on the Naval Boards and for the\r\nRhodians) were certainly not to be looked for in them. Similar\r\nmisconceptions of the actual or possible sentiments of the Spartans\r\nappear in the Speech for the Megalopolitans, and of those of the\r\nThebans in the Third Olynthiac (§ 15). The early orations against\r\nPhilip also show some misunderstanding of his character. And if, in\r\nfact, Demosthenes lived his early years largely in solitary\r\nstudiousness and was unsociable by disposition, this lack of a quick\r\ngrasp of human nature and motives is quite intelligible. But this\r\ndefect grew less conspicuous as his experience increased; and though\r\neven to the end there remained something of the sophist about him, as\r\nabout all the disciples of the ancient rhetoric, the greatness of his\r\nbest work is not seriously affected by this. For, in his greatest\r\nspeeches, and in the greatest parts of nearly all his speeches, the\r\norator is white-hot with genuine passion and earnestness; and all his\r\nstudy and preparation resulted, for the most part, not in an artificial\r\nproduct, but in the most convincing expression of his real feeling and\r\nbelief; so that it was the man himself, and not the rhetorical\r\npractitioner that spoke.\r\n\r\nThe lighter virtues of the orator are not to be sought for in him. In\r\ngracefulness and humour he is deficient: his humour, indeed, generally\r\ntakes the grim forms of irony and satire, or verges on personality and\r\nbad taste. Few of his sentences can be imagined to have been delivered\r\nwith a smile; and something like ferocity is generally not far below\r\nthe surface. Pathos is seldom in him unmixed with sterner qualities,\r\nand is usually lost in indignation. But of almost every other variety\r\nof tone he has a complete command. The essential parts of his reasoning\r\n(even when it is logically or morally defective) are couched, as a\r\nrule, in a forcible and cogent form;[12] and he has a striking power of\r\nclose, sustained, and at the same time lucid argumentation. His matter\r\nis commonly disposed with such skill that each topic occurs where it\r\nwill tell most powerfully; and while one portion of a speech affords\r\nrelief to another (where relief is needed, and particularly in the\r\nlonger orations) all alike bear on the main issue or strengthen the\r\norator's position with his audience. Historical allusions are not (as\r\nthey often are by Aeschines and Isocrates) enlarged out of proportion\r\nto their importance, but are limited to what is necessary, in order to\r\nillustrate the orator's point or drive his lesson home. Add to these\r\nqualities his combination of political idealism with absolute mastery\r\nof minute detail; the intensity of his appeal to the moral sense and\r\npatriotism of his hearers; the impressiveness of his denunciation of\r\npolitical wrong; the vividness of his narrative, the rapid succession\r\nof his impassioned phrases, and some part of the secret of his power\r\nwill be explained. For the rest, while there is in his writing every\r\ndegree of fullness or brevity, there is no waste of words, no 'fine\r\nlanguage' out of place. His language, indeed, is ordinarily\r\nsimple--sometimes even colloquial; though in the arrangement of his\r\nwords in their most telling order he shows consummate art, and his\r\nmetaphors are often bold and sometimes even violent. In the use of the\r\n'figures of speech' he excels; above all, in the use of antitheses\r\n(whether for the purpose of vivid contrast or of precise logical\r\nexpression), and of the rhetorical question, used now in indignation,\r\nnow in irony, now in triumphant conclusion of an argument: and at times\r\nthere are master-strokes of genius, which defy all analysis, such as\r\nthe great appeal to the men of Marathon in the Speech on the Crown.[13]\r\nHe does not as a rule (and this is particularly true of the Speech on\r\nthe Crown) cover the whole of the ground with the same adequacy; but so\r\nconcentrates all his forces upon certain points as to be irresistible,\r\nand thus 'with thunder and lightning confounds'[14] the orators who\r\noppose him. It is no wonder that some of the greatest of English\r\norators, and notably of those of the eighteenth and early nineteenth\r\ncenturies, borrow from him not only words and phrases, but inspiration\r\nand confidence in their cause, and look upon him as a model whom they\r\nmay emulate, but cannot excel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See Introduction to First Philippic.\r\n\r\n[2] See notes on Speech for the Megalopolitans.\r\n\r\n[3] See note on Speech on the Crown, § 140.\r\n\r\n[4] See Speech on the Crown, §§ 170 ff.\r\n\r\n[5] See Zimmern, _The Greek Commonwealth_, pp. 159 ff., for an\r\nexcellent short account of the constitution and functions of the\r\nCouncil.

XIV)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. The speech was delivered in 354 B.C. News had been\r\nbrought to Athens that the Persian King Artaxerxes Ochus was making\r\ngreat military and naval preparations, and though these were, in fact,\r\ndirected against his own rebellious subjects in Egypt, Phoenicia, and\r\nCyprus, the Athenians had some ground for alarm: for, two years before\r\nthis, Chares, in command of an Athenian fleet, had given assistance to\r\nArtabazus, Satrap of Ionia, who was in revolt against the king. The\r\nking had made a protest, and (late in 355) Athens had ordered Chares to\r\nwithdraw his aid from Artabazus. A party in Athens now wished to\r\ndeclare war on Persia, and appealed strongly to Athenian traditions in\r\nfavour of the proposal. Demosthenes opposes them, on the ground that it\r\nwas not certain that the king was aiming at Athens at all, and that the\r\ndisunion of the Hellenic peoples would render any such action unsafe:\r\nAthens had more dangerous enemies nearer home, and her finances were\r\nnot in a condition for such a campaign. But he takes advantage of the\r\ninterest aroused, to propose a reform of the trierarchic system,\r\ndesigned to secure a more efficient navy, and to remedy certain abuses\r\nin the existing method of equipping vessels for service.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times, the duty of equipping and commanding each trireme was\r\nlaid upon single citizens of means, the hull and certain fittings being\r\nfound by the state. When, early in the fourth century, the number of\r\nwealthy men had diminished, each ship might be shared by two citizens,\r\nwho commanded in turn. In 357 a law was passed, on the proposal of\r\nPeriander, transferring the responsibility from individuals to\r\n'Symmories' or Boards. (The system had been instituted in a slightly\r\ndifferent form for the collection of the war-tax in the archonship of\r\nNausinicus, 378-7 B.C.) The collection of the sums required became the\r\nwork of twenty Boards, formed by the subdivision of the 1,200 richest\r\ncitizens: each contributor, whatever his property, paid the same share.\r\nThe richer men thus got off with the loss of a very small proportion of\r\ntheir income, as compared with the poorer members of the Boards,[1] and\r\nin managing the business of the Boards they sometimes contrived to\r\nexact the whole sum from their colleagues, and to escape payment\r\nthemselves. At the same time the duties of the several Boards and their\r\nmembers were not allocated with sufficient precision to enable the\r\nresponsibility to be brought home in case of default; and the nominal\r\nTwelve Hundred had fallen to a much smaller number, on whom the burden\r\naccordingly fell with undue weight. Demosthenes' proposal provided for\r\nthe distribution of the responsibility of equipping the vessels and\r\nproviding the funds, in the most detailed manner, with a view to\r\npreventing all evasion; but it was not carried. In fact, it was not\r\nuntil 340 that he succeeded in reforming the trierarchy, and he then\r\nmade the burden vary strictly with property. The proposal, however, to\r\ndeclare war upon Persia went no further.\r\n\r\nWhile, in this speech, Demosthenes is in accord with the policy of\r\nEubulus, so far as concerns the avoidance of war with Persia, his\r\nproposals of financial reform would not be viewed with favour by the\r\nwealthy men who were Eubulus' firm supporters. Some of the themes which\r\nrecur continually in later speeches are prominent in this--the futility\r\nof rhetorical appeals to past glories, without readiness for personal\r\nservice, and the need of a thorough organization of the forces. While\r\nthe speech shows rather too strongly the marks of careful preparation,\r\nand seldom rises to eloquence--the style, indeed, is often rather\r\ncramped and stiff, and the sentiments, especially at the beginning,\r\nartificially phrased--it is moderate and practical in tone, and shows a\r\ncharacteristic mastery of minute detail.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} Those who praise your forefathers,[n] men of Athens, desire, no\r\ndoubt, to gratify you by their speeches; and yet I do not think that\r\nthey are acting in the interests of those whom they praise. For the\r\nsubject on which they attempt to speak is one to which no words can do\r\njustice; and so, although they thus win for themselves the reputation\r\nof capable speakers, the impression which they convey to their hearers\r\nof the merit of our forefathers is not adequate to our conception of\r\nit. For my part I believe that their highest praise is constituted by\r\nTime: for the time that has passed has been long, and still no\r\ngeneration has arisen, whose achievements could be compared with\r\nadvantage to theirs. {2} As for myself, I shall attempt to point out\r\nthe way in which, in my opinion, you can best make your preparations.\r\nFor the truth is, that if all of us who propose to address you were to\r\nsucceed in proving to you our rhetorical skill, there would not be the\r\nslightest improvement in your condition--I am sure of it; but if a\r\nsingle speaker were to come forward, whoever he might be, who could\r\ninstruct and convince you as to the nature of the preparations which\r\nwould meet the city's need, as to their extent, and the resources upon\r\nwhich we can draw for them, your present fears would instantly be\r\ndissolved. This I will attempt to do--if indeed it is in my power. But\r\nfirst I must briefly express my views as to our relations with the king.\r\n\r\n{3} I hold the king to be the common enemy of all the Hellenes; and yet\r\nI should not on that account urge you, alone and unsupported, to raise\r\nwar against him. For I observe that there is no common or mutual\r\nfriendship even among the Hellenes themselves: some have more faith in\r\nthe king than in some other Hellenes. When such are the conditions,\r\nyour interest requires you, I believe, to see to it that you only begin\r\nwar from a fair and just cause, and to make all proper preparations:\r\nthis should be the basis of your policy. {4} For I believe, men of\r\nAthens, that if it were made plain to the eyes and understandings of\r\nthe Hellenes, that the king was making an attempt upon them, they would\r\nboth fight in alliance with those who undertook the defence for them\r\nand with them, and would feel very grateful to them. But if we quarrel\r\nwith him prematurely, while his intentions are still uncertain, I am\r\nafraid, men of Athens, that we may be forced to fight not only against\r\nthe king, but also against those for whose benefit we are exercising\r\nsuch forethought. {5} For he will pause in the execution of his\r\nproject, if indeed he has really resolved to attack the Hellenes, and\r\nwill bribe some of them with money and offers of friendship; while\r\nthey, desirous of bringing their private wars to a successful end, and\r\nanimated only by such a spirit, will disregard the common safety of\r\nall. I urge you then, not to hurl the city needlessly into the midst of\r\nany such chaos of selfish passions. {6} Moreover, I see that the\r\nquestion of the policy to be adopted towards the king does not even\r\nstand on the same footing for the other Hellenes as for you. It is\r\nopen, I think, to many of them to manage certain of their own interests\r\nas they please, and to disregard the rest of the Hellenes. But for you\r\nit is not honourable, even if you are the injured party, and are\r\ndealing with those who have injured you, to punish them so severely as\r\nto leave some of them to fall under the domination of the foreigner:\r\n{7} and this being so, we must take care, first, that we do not find\r\nourselves involved in an unequal war, and secondly, that he, whom we\r\nbelieve to be plotting against the Hellenes, does not gain credit from\r\nthe supposition that he is their friend. How then can this be achieved?\r\nIt will be achieved if it is manifest to all that the forces of Athens\r\nhave been overhauled and put in readiness, and if her intentions in\r\nregard to their use are plainly righteous. {8} But to those who take a\r\nbold line, and urge you, without any hesitation whatever, to go to war,\r\nmy reply is this--that it is not difficult to win a reputation for\r\nbravery, when the occasion calls for deliberation; nor to prove\r\nyourself an accomplished orator, when danger is at the door: but to\r\ndisplay your courage in the hour of danger, and, in debate, to have\r\nwiser advice to offer than others--that is the hard thing, and that is\r\nwhat is required of you. {9} For my part, men of Athens, I consider\r\nthat the proposed war with the king would be a difficult undertaking\r\nfor the city; while the decisive conflict in which the war would result\r\nwould be an easier matter, and for this reason. Every war, I suppose,\r\nnecessarily requires ships and money and the command of positions. All\r\nsuch advantages the king, I find, possesses more abundantly than we.\r\nBut a conflict of forces requires nothing so much as brave men; and of\r\nthese, I believe, the larger number is with us, and with those who\r\nshare our danger. {10} For this reason I exhort you not to be the\r\nfirst, in any way whatever, to take up the war; but for the decisive\r\nstruggle I think you ought to be ready and your preparations made. And\r\nfurther, if the forces[n] with which foreigners and Hellenes could\r\nrespectively be repelled were really different in kind, the fact that\r\nwe were arraying our forces against the king would naturally, it may\r\nbe, admit of no concealment. {11} But since all military preparations\r\nare of the same character, and the main points of a force must always\r\nbe the same--the means to repel enemies, to help allies, and to retain\r\nexisting advantages--why, when we have our acknowledged foes,[n] do we\r\nseek to procure others? Let us rather prepare ourselves to meet the\r\nenemies whom we have, and we shall then repel the king also, if he\r\ntakes the aggressive against us. {12} Suppose that you yourselves\r\nsummon the Hellenes to your side now. If, when the attitude of some of\r\nthem towards you is so disagreeable, you do not fulfil their demands,\r\nhow can you expect that any one will listen to you? 'Why,' you say, 'we\r\nshall tell them that the king is plotting against them.' Good Heavens!\r\nDo you imagine that they do not foresee this themselves? Of course they\r\ndo. But their fear of this does not yet outweigh the quarrels which\r\nsome of them have against you and against each other. And so the tour\r\nof your envoys will end in nothing but their own rhapsodies.[n] {13}\r\nBut if you wait, then, if the design which we now suspect is really on\r\nfoot, there is not one of the Hellenes who stands so much upon his\r\ndignity that he will not come and beg for your aid, when he sees that\r\nyou have a thousand cavalry, and infantry as many as any one can\r\ndesire, and three hundred ships: for he will know that in these lies\r\nhis surest hope of deliverance. Appeal to them now, and we shall be\r\nsuppliants, and, if unsuccessful, rejected suppliants. Make your own\r\npreparations and wait, and then they will be the suppliants and we\r\ntheir deliverers; and we may rest assured that they will all come to us\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\n{14} In thinking out these points and others like them, men of Athens,\r\nmy object was not to devise a bold speech,[n] prolonged to no purpose:\r\nbut I took the greatest pains to discover the means by which our\r\npreparations could be most effectively and quickly made; and therefore,\r\nif my proposal meets with your approval, when you have heard it, you\r\nought, I think, to pass it. Now the first element in our preparation,\r\nmen of Athens (and it is the most important), must be this: your minds\r\nmust be so disposed, that every one of you will perform willingly and\r\nheartily any service that is required of him. {15} For you see, men of\r\nAthens, that whenever you have unanimously desired any object, and the\r\ndesire has been followed by a feeling on the part of every individual,\r\nthat the practical steps towards it were for himself to take, the\r\nobject has never yet slipped from your grasp: but whenever the wish has\r\nhad no further result than that each man has looked to his neighbour,\r\nexpecting his neighbour to act while he himself does nothing, the\r\nobject has never yet been attained. {16} But supposing you to be filled\r\nwith the keenness that I have described, I am of opinion that we should\r\nmake up the Twelve Hundred to their full number, and increase it to\r\n2,000, by the addition of 800. For if you can display this total, then,\r\nwhen you have allowed for the unmarried heiresses and orphans,[n] for\r\nproperty outside Attica,[n] or held in partnership, and for any persons\r\nwho may be unable to contribute,[n] you will, I believe, actually have\r\nthe full 1,200 persons available. {17} These you must divide into\r\ntwenty boards, as at present, with sixty persons to each board; and\r\neach of these boards you must divide into five sections of twelve\r\npersons each, taking care in every case to associate with the richest\r\nman the poorest men,[n] to maintain the balance. Such is the\r\narrangement of persons which I recommend, and my reason you will know\r\nwhen you have heard the nature of the entire system. {18} I pass to the\r\ndistribution of the ships. You must provide a total complement of 300\r\nships, forming twenty divisions of fifteen ships apiece, and including\r\nin each division five of the first hundred vessels,[n] five of the\r\nsecond hundred, and five of the third hundred. Next, you must assign by\r\nlot[n] to each board of persons its fifteen ships, and each board must\r\nassign three ships to each of its sections. {19} This done, in order\r\nthat you may have the payments also systematically arranged, you must\r\ndivide the 6,000 talents (for that is the taxable capital[n] of the\r\ncountry) into 100 parts of sixty talents each. Five of each of these\r\nparts you must allot to each of the larger boards--the twenty--and each\r\nboard must assign one of these sums of sixty talents to each of its\r\nsections; {20} in order that, if you need 100 ships,[n] there may be\r\nsixty talents to be taxed for the expense of each ship, and twelve\r\npersons responsible for it; if 200, thirty talents will be taxed to\r\nmake up the cost, and six persons will be responsible; if 300, then\r\ntwenty talents must be taxed to defray the expense, and four persons\r\nwill be responsible. {21} In the same way, men of Athens, I bid you\r\nmake a valuation according to the register of all those fittings of the\r\nships which are in arrear,[n] divide them into twenty parts, and allot\r\nto each of the large boards one-twentieth of the debtors: these must\r\nthen be assigned by each board in equal numbers to each of its\r\nsections, and the twelve persons composing each section must call up\r\ntheir share of the arrears, and provide, ready-equipped, the ships\r\nwhich fall to them. {22} Such is the plan by which, in my opinion, the\r\nexpense, the ships, the trierarchs, and the recovery of the fittings\r\ncould best be provided for and put into working order. I proceed to\r\ndescribe a simple and easy scheme for the manning of the vessels. I\r\nrecommend that the generals should divide the whole space of the\r\ndockyards into ten, taking care to have in each space thirty slips for\r\nsingle vessels close together. This done they should apportion to each\r\nspace two of the boards and thirty ships; and should then assign a\r\ntribe to each space by lot. {23} Each captain should divide into three\r\nparts the space which falls to his tribe, with the corresponding ships,\r\nand should allot these among the three wards[n] of each tribe, in such\r\na way that if each tribe has one division of the entire docks, each\r\nward will have a third of one of these divisions; and you will know, in\r\ncase of need, first the position assigned to the tribe; next, that of\r\nthe ward; and then the names of the trierarchs and their ships; each\r\ntribe will be answerable for thirty, and each ward for ten ships. If\r\nthis system is put in train, circumstances as they arise will provide\r\nfor anything that I may have overlooked to-day (for perhaps it is\r\ndifficult to think of everything), and there will be a single\r\norganization for the whole fleet and every part of it.\r\n\r\n{24} But what of funds? What resources have we immediately at our\r\ncommand? The statement which I am about to make on this subject will no\r\ndoubt be astonishing; but I will make it nevertheless; for I am\r\nconvinced that upon a correct view of the facts, this statement alone\r\nwill be proved true, and will be justified by the event. I say then,\r\nthat this is not the time to discuss the financial question. We have\r\nlarge resources upon which, in case of necessity, we may honourably and\r\nrightly draw: but if we inquire for them now, we shall not believe that\r\nwe can rely upon them even against the hour of need; so far shall we be\r\nfrom supplying them now. 'What then,' you will ask me, 'are these\r\nresources, which are non-existent now, but will be ours then? This is\r\nreally like a riddle.' I will tell you. {25} Men of Athens, you see all\r\nthis great city.[n] In this city there is wealth which will compare, I\r\nhad almost said, with the united wealth of all other cities. But such\r\nis the disposition of those who own it, that if all your orators were\r\nto raise the alarm that the king was coming--that he was at the\r\ndoors--that there was no possible escape; and if with the orators an\r\nequal number of prophets foretold the same thing; even then, far from\r\ncontributing funds, they would show no sign[2] [and make no\r\nacknowledgement] of their possession of them. {26} If, however, they\r\nwere to see in course of actual realization all the terrors with which\r\nat present we are only threatened in speeches, not one of them is so\r\nblind that he would not both offer his contribution, and be among the\r\nfirst to pay the tax. For who will prefer to lose his life and\r\nproperty, rather than contribute a part of his substance to save\r\nhimself and the remainder of it? Funds, then, we can command, I am\r\ncertain, if there is a genuine need of them, and not before; and\r\naccordingly I urge you not even to look for them now. For all that you\r\nwould provide now, if you decided upon a levy, would be more ludicrous\r\nthan nothing at all. {27} Suppose that we are told to pay 1 per cent.\r\nnow; that gives you sixty talents. Two per cent. then--double the\r\namount; that makes 120 talents. And what is that to the 1,200 camels\r\nwhich (as these gentlemen tell us) are bringing the king's money for\r\nhim? Or would you have me assume a payment of one-twelfth, 500 talents?\r\nWhy, you would never submit to this; and if you paid the money down, it\r\nwould not be adequate to the war. {28} You must, therefore, make all\r\nyour other preparations, but allow your funds to remain for the present\r\nin the hands of their owners--they could nowhere be more safely kept\r\nfor the use of the State; and then, if ever the threatened crisis\r\narises, you will receive them as the voluntary gift of their\r\npossessors. This, men of Athens, is not only a possible course of\r\naction, but a dignified and a politic one. It is a course of action\r\nwhich is worthy to be reported to the ears of the king, and which would\r\ninspire him with no slight apprehension. {29} For he well knows that by\r\ntwo hundred ships, of which one hundred were Athenian,[n] his ancestors\r\nwere deprived of one thousand; and he will hear that Athens alone has\r\nnow equipped three hundred; so that, however great his infatuation, he\r\ncould certainly not imagine it a light thing to make this country his\r\nfoe. But if it is his wealth that suggests proud thoughts to his mind,\r\nhe will find that in this respect too his resources are weaker than\r\nours. {30} It is true that he is said to be bringing a great quantity\r\nof gold with him. But if he distributes this, he must look for more:\r\nfor just so it is the way of springs and wells to give out, if large\r\nquantities are drawn from them all at once; whereas we possess, as he\r\nwill hear, in the taxable capital of the country, resources which we\r\ndefend against attack in a way of which those ancestors of his who\r\nsleep at Marathon can best tell him: and so long as we are masters of\r\nthe country there is no risk of our resources being exhausted.\r\n\r\n{31} Nor again can I see any grounds for the fear, which some feel,\r\nlest his wealth should enable him to collect a large mercenary force.\r\nIt may be that many of the Hellenes would be glad to serve under him\r\nagainst Egypt,[n] against Orontas,[n] or against certain other foreign\r\npowers--not from a wish that the king should conquer any such enemies,\r\nbut because each desires individually to obtain some private means to\r\nrelieve his present poverty. But I cannot believe that any Hellene\r\nwould march against Hellas. Whither will he turn afterwards? Will he go\r\nto Phrygia and be a slave? {32} For the war with the foreigner is a war\r\nfor no other stake than our country, our life, our habits, our freedom,\r\nand all that we value. Where is the wretch who would sacrifice self,\r\nparents, sepulchres, fatherland, for the sake of some short-lived gain?\r\nI do not believe that he exists. And indeed it is not even to the\r\nking's own interest to conquer the Hellenes with a mercenary force; for\r\nan army which has conquered us is, even more certainly,[n] stronger\r\nthan he; and his intention is not to destroy us only that he may fall\r\ninto the power of others: he wishes to rule, if it may be, over all the\r\nworld; but if not, at least over those who are already his slaves.\r\n\r\n{33} It may be supposed that the Thebans will be on the king's side.\r\nNow this subject is one upon which it is hard to address you. For such\r\nis your hatred of them, that you cannot hear a good word about them,\r\nhowever true, without displeasure. And yet those who have grave\r\nquestions to consider must not on any pretext pass over any profitable\r\nline of argument. {34} I believe, then, that so far are the Thebans\r\nfrom being likely ever to march with him against the Hellenes, that\r\nthey would give a great deal, if they had it to give, for an\r\nopportunity of cancelling their former sins against Hellas.[n] But if\r\nany one does believe that the Thebans are so unhappily constituted, at\r\nleast you are all aware, I presume, that if the Thebans take the part\r\nof the king, their enemies must necessarily take the part of the\r\nHellenes.\r\n\r\n{35} My own belief is that our cause, the cause of justice, and its\r\nsupporters, will prove stronger in every emergency than the traitor and\r\nthe foreigner. And therefore I say that we need feel no excessive\r\napprehension, and that we must not be led on into taking the first step\r\ntowards war. Indeed, I cannot even see that any of the other Hellenes\r\nhas reason to dread this war. {36} Are they not all aware, that so long\r\nas they thought of the king as their common foe, and were at unity with\r\none another, they were secure in their prosperity; but that ever since\r\nthey imagined that they could count upon the king as their friend, and\r\nfell to quarrelling over their private interests, they have suffered\r\nsuch evils as no malediction could have devised for them? Must we then\r\ndread a man whose friendship, thanks to Fortune and Heaven, has proved\r\nso unprofitable, and his enmity so advantageous? By no means! Let us\r\nnot, however, commit any aggression, in view of our own interests, and\r\nof the disturbed and mistrustful spirit which prevails among the rest\r\nof the Hellenes. {37} Were it possible, indeed, to join forces with\r\nthem all, and with one accord to attack the king in his isolation, I\r\nshould have counted it no wrong even were we to take the aggressive.\r\nBut since this is impossible, we must be careful to give the king no\r\npretext for trying to enforce the claims of the other Hellenes against\r\nus. If you keep the peace, any such step on his part would arouse\r\nsuspicion; but if you are the first to begin war, his hostility to you\r\nwould make his desire to befriend your rivals appear natural enough.\r\n{38} Do not then lay bare the evil condition of Hellas, by calling the\r\npowers together when they will not obey, or undertaking a war which you\r\nwill be unable to carry on. Keep the peace; take courage, and make your\r\npreparations. Resolve that the news which the king hears of you shall\r\ncertainly not be that all Hellas, and Athens with it, in distress or\r\npanic or confusion. Far from it! {39} Let him rather know that if\r\nfalsehood and perjury were not as disgraceful in Hellenic eyes as they\r\nare honourable in his, you would long ago have been on the march\r\nagainst him: and that though, as it is, your regard for yourselves\r\nforbids you to act thus, you are praying to all the gods that the same\r\nmadness may seize him as once seized his ancestors. And if it occurs to\r\nhim to reflect upon this, he will find that your deliberations are not\r\nconducted in any careless spirit. {40} He at least shares the knowledge\r\nthat it was your wars with his own ancestors that raised Athens to the\r\nsummit of prosperity and greatness; while the peaceful policy which she\r\npreviously pursued never gave her such a superiority as she now enjoys\r\nover any single state in Hellas. Aye, and he sees that the Hellenes are\r\nin need of one who, whether intentionally or not, will reconcile them\r\none to another; and he knows that if he were to stir up war, he himself\r\nwould assume that character in relation to them; so that the news which\r\nhe will hear of you will be intelligible and credible to him.\r\n\r\n{41} But I do not wish to trouble you, men of Athens, by unduly\r\nprolonging my speech. I will therefore recapitulate my advice and\r\nretire. I bid you prepare your forces with a view to the enemies whom\r\nyou have. If the king or any other power attempts to do you injury, you\r\nmust defend yourselves with these same forces. But you must not take\r\nthe aggressive by word or deed; and you must take care that it is your\r\ndeeds, and not your platform speeches, that are worthy of your\r\nforefathers. If you act thus, you will be consulting both your own\r\ninterests and those of the speakers who are opposing me; since you will\r\nhave no cause to be angry with them afterwards, because you have\r\ndecided wrongly to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See Speech on Crown, §§ 102 ff. and notes.\r\n\r\n[2] See Speech on Crown, §§ 102 ff. and notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE MEGALOPOLITANS (OR. XVI)\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. In 371 B.C. the Thebans under Epaminondas defeated the\r\nSpartans at Leuctra, and, assisted by Thebes, the Arcadians and\r\nMessenians threw off the Spartan yoke. The former founded Megalopolis\r\nas their common centre, the latter Messene. But after the death of\r\nEpaminondas in 362, Thebes was left without a leader; and when, in 355,\r\nshe became involved in the 'Sacred War' with the Phocians, the new\r\nPeloponnesian states turned towards Athens, and Messene received a\r\nsolemn promise of Athenian assistance, if ever she was attacked by\r\nSparta. In 353 Thebes was suffering considerably from the Sacred War,\r\nand the Spartans made an ingenious attempt to recover their power, in\r\nthe form of a proposal for the restoration of territory to its original\r\nowners. This meant that Athens would recover Oropus, which had been in\r\nthe hands of Thebes since 366, and had previously been the subject of a\r\nlong-standing dispute; that Orchomenus, Thespiae, and Plataeae, which\r\nhad all been overthrown by Thebes, would be restored; and that Elis and\r\nPhlius would also recover certain lost possessions. All these states\r\nwould then be morally bound (so the Spartans thought) to help Sparta to\r\nreconquer Arcadia and Messenia.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of this speech (delivered in 353) the Megalopolitans\r\nhad appealed to Athens, and an Arcadian and a Spartan embassy had each\r\nhad an audience of the Assembly, and had each received strong support\r\nfrom Athenian speakers. The principal motives of the supporters of\r\nSparta were their hostility to Thebes, and their desire not to break\r\nwith the Spartans, whom Athens had assisted at Mantineia in 362 against\r\nthe Thebans and Megalopolitans. Demosthenes supports the Arcadians, and\r\nlays great stress on the desirability of maintaining a balance of power\r\nbetween Sparta and Thebes, so that neither might become too strong. To\r\nallow Sparta to reconquer Arcadia, and, as the next step, Messenia,\r\nwould be to render her too formidable; and to reject the proposal of\r\nSparta would not preclude Athens from recovering Oropus and demanding\r\nthe restoration of the Boeotian towns. But the promise of assistance to\r\nthe Arcadians should be accompanied by a request for the termination of\r\ntheir alliance with Thebes.\r\n\r\nDemosthenes' advice was not followed. In fact Athens was hardly in a\r\nposition to risk becoming entangled in a war with Sparta, particularly\r\nin view of the danger to her northern possessions from Philip. She\r\ntherefore remained neutral, while the Thebans, relieved from the\r\npressure of the Sacred War owing to the defeat of the Phocian leader\r\nOnomarchus by Philip, were able to send aid to Megalopolis. A truce\r\nbetween Sparta and Megalopolis was made about 350. It was, however, a\r\nresult of the neutrality of Athens, that she was unable, a few years\r\nlater, to secure the support of the Arcadians against Philip, whose\r\nallies they subsequently became.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham describes the oration as 'one of extraordinary subtlety\r\nand address in handling delicate topics'; and, after quoting the\r\npassage in which Demosthenes urges the necessity of maintaining a\r\nbalance of power between rival states, adds that 'this is precisely the\r\nlanguage of modern policy'. At the same time, the speech has in places\r\na somewhat academic and theoretical air: it is much occupied with the\r\nweighing of hypothetical considerations and obligations against one\r\nanother: and though it enunciates some plain and reasonable political\r\nprinciples, and makes an honest attempt to satisfy those who wished to\r\nhelp the Arcadians, but at the same time desired to regain ground\r\nagainst Thebes, it is not always convincing, and the tone is more\r\nfrankly opportunist than is usually the case with Demosthenes.]\r\n\r\n {1} I think, men of Athens, that those who have spoken on the Arcadian side and\r\nthose who have spoken on the Spartan, are alike making a mistake. For\r\ntheir mutual accusations and their attacks upon one another would\r\nsuggest that they are not, like yourselves, Athenians, receiving the\r\ntwo embassies, but actually delegates of the two states. Such attacks\r\nit was for the two deputations to make. The duty of those who claim to\r\nadvise you here was to discuss the situation impartially, and to\r\ninquire, in an uncontentious spirit, what course is best in your\r\ninterests. {2} As it is, if one could alter the fact that they are\r\nknown to us, and that they speak the dialect of Attica, I believe that\r\nmany would imagine that those on the one side actually were Arcadians,\r\nand those on the other, Spartans. For my part, I see plainly enough the\r\ndifficulty of offering the best advice. For you, like them, are\r\ndeluded, in your desire for one extreme or the other: and one who\r\nendeavours to propose an intermediate course, which you will not have\r\nthe patience to understand, will satisfy neither side and will forfeit\r\nthe confidence of both. {3} But in spite of this, I shall prefer, for\r\nmy own part, to risk being regarded as an idle chatterer (if such is\r\nreally to be my lot), rather than to abandon my conviction as to what\r\nis best for Athens, and leave you to the mercy of those who would\r\ndeceive you. And while I shall deal with all other points later, by\r\nyour leave, I shall take for my starting-point, in explaining the\r\ncourse which I believe to be best, those principles which are admitted\r\nby all.\r\n\r\n{4} There can be no possible question that it is to the interest of the\r\ncity that both the Spartans and these Thebans should be weak; and the\r\npresent situation, if one may judge at all from what has constantly\r\nbeen asserted in your presence, is such, that if Orchomenus, Thespiae,\r\nand Plataeae[n] are re-established, Thebes becomes weak; and that if\r\nthe Spartans can reduce Arcadia to subjection and destroy Megalopolis,\r\nSparta will recover her former strength. {5} We must, therefore, take\r\ncare not to allow the Spartans to attain a formidable degree of\r\nstrength, before the Thebans have become insignificant, lest there\r\nshould take place, unobserved by us, such an increase in the power of\r\nSparta as would be out of proportion to the decrease in the power of\r\nThebes which our interests demand. For it is, of course, out of the\r\nquestion that we should desire merely to substitute the rivalry of\r\nSparta for that of Thebes: that is not the object upon which we are\r\nbent. Our object is rather that neither people shall be capable of\r\ndoing us any injury. That is what will best enable us to live in\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n{6} But, granted that this is what ought to be, still, we are told, it\r\nis a scandalous thing to choose for our allies the men against whom we\r\nwere arrayed at Mantineia, and further, to help them against those\r\nwhose perils we shared that day. I agree; but I think that we need to\r\ninsert the condition, 'provided that the two parties are willing to act\r\nrightly.' {7} For if all alike prove willing to keep the peace, we\r\nshall not go to the aid of the Megalopolitans, since there will be no\r\nneed to do so; and so there will be no hostility whatever on our part\r\ntowards our former comrades in battle. They are already our allies, as\r\nthey tell us; and now the Arcadians will become our allies as well.\r\nWhat more could we desire? {8} But suppose they act wrongfully and\r\nthink fit to make war. In that case, if the question before us is\r\nwhether we are to abandon Megalopolis to Sparta or not, then I say\r\nthat, wrong though it is, I will acquiesce in our permitting this, and\r\ndeclining to oppose our former companions in danger. But if you all\r\nknow that, after capturing Megalopolis, they will march against\r\nMessene, let me ask any of those who are now so harshly disposed\r\ntowards Megalopolis to say what action he will _then_ advise. No answer\r\nwill be given. {9} In fact you all know that, whether they advise it or\r\nnot, we _must_ then go to the rescue, both because of the oath which we\r\nhave sworn to the Messenians, and because our interests demand the\r\ncontinued existence of that city. Ask yourselves, then, on which\r\noccasion you can most honourably and generously interpose to check the\r\naggressions of Sparta--in defence of Megalopolis, or in defence of\r\nMessene? {10} On the present occasion it will be understood that you\r\nare succouring the Arcadians, and are anxious that the Peace, which you\r\nfought for and risked your lives to win, may be secure. But if you\r\nwait, all the world will see plainly that it is not in the name of\r\nright that you desire the existence of Messene, but because you are\r\nafraid of Sparta. And while we should always seek and do the right, we\r\nshould at the same time take good care that what is right shall also be\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\n{11} Now an argument is used by speakers on the other side to the\r\neffect that we ought to attempt to recover Oropus,[n] and that if we\r\nmake enemies of those who might come to our assistance against it we\r\nshall have no allies. I too say that we should try to recover Oropus.\r\nBut the argument that the Spartans will be our enemies now, if we make\r\nalliance with those Arcadians who desire our friendship, is an argument\r\nwhich no one has less right even to mention, than those who induced you\r\nto help the Spartans when they were in danger. {12} Such was not their\r\nargument, when all the Peloponnesians came to you,[n] entreating you to\r\nsupport them in their campaign against Sparta, and they persuaded you\r\nto reject the entreaty, with the result that the Peloponnesians took\r\nthe only remaining course and applied to Thebes--when they bade you\r\ncontribute funds and imperil your lives for the deliverance of the\r\nSpartans. Nor, I presume, would you have been willing to protect them,\r\nhad they warned you that you must expect no gratitude for their\r\ndeliverance, unless, after saving them, you allowed them once more to\r\ndo as they pleased and commit fresh aggressions. {13} And further,\r\nhowever antagonistic it may be to the designs of the Spartans, that we\r\nshould make the Arcadians our allies, they are surely bound to feel a\r\ngratitude towards us for saving them when they were in the utmost\r\nextremity, which will outweigh their vexation at our preventing their\r\npresent wrongdoing. Must they not then either assist us to recover\r\nOropus, or else be regarded as the basest of mankind? For, by Heaven, I\r\ncan see no other alternative.\r\n\r\n{14} I am astonished, also, to hear it argued that if we make the\r\nArcadians our allies, and carry out my advice, it will seem as though\r\nAthens were changing her policy, and were utterly unreliable. I believe\r\nthat the exact reverse of this is the case, men of Athens, and I will\r\ntell you why. I suppose that no one in the world can deny that when\r\nthis city saved the Spartans,[n] and before them the Thebans,[n] and\r\nfinally the Euboeans,[n] and subsequently made them her allies, she had\r\none and the same end always in view. {15} And what was this? It was to\r\ndeliver the victims of aggression. And if this is so, it is not we that\r\nshould be changing, but those who refuse to adhere to the right; and it\r\nwill be manifest that, although circumstances change from time to time\r\nwith the ambitious designs of others, Athens does not change.\r\n\r\n{16} I believe that the Spartans are playing a very unscrupulous part.\r\nAt present they tell us that the Eleans are to recover part of\r\nTriphylia,[n] and the Phliasians, Tricaranum;[n] other Arcadians are to\r\nrecover their own possessions, and we ourselves are to recover\r\nOropus--not that they have any desire to see every state enjoying its\r\nown--far from it!-- such generosity on their part would be late indeed\r\nin showing itself. {17} They wish rather to present the appearance of\r\nco-operating with each separate state in the recovery of the territory\r\nthat it claims, in order that when they themselves march against\r\nMessene, all may take the field with them, and give them their hearty\r\nassistance, on pain of seeming to act unfairly, in refusing to return\r\nan equivalent for the support which each of them received from Sparta\r\nin regard to their own several claims. {18} My own view is that, even\r\nwithout the tacit surrender of some of the Arcadians to Sparta, we can\r\nrecover Oropus, aided not only by the Spartans, if they are ready to\r\nact honourably, but by all who disapprove of allowing Thebes to retain\r\nwhat is not her own. But even if it were made quite plain to us, that\r\nwithout allowing Sparta to subdue the Peloponnese, we should not be\r\nable to take Oropus, I should still think it preferable, if I may dare\r\nto say so, to let Oropus go, rather than sacrifice Messene and the\r\nPeloponnese to Sparta. For our quarrel with them would not, I believe,\r\nbe confined to this; since--I will not say what occurs to me; but there\r\nare many risks which we should run.\r\n\r\n{19} But, to pass on, it is a monstrous thing to use the hostile\r\nactions which, they say, the Megalopolitans committed against us, under\r\nthe influence of Thebes, as a ground of accusation against them to-day;\r\nand, when they wish to be friends and so atone for their action by\r\ndoing us good, to look askance at them, to seek for some way of\r\navoiding their friendship, to refuse to recognize that in proportion to\r\nthe zeal which my opponents can prove the Megalopolitans to have shown\r\nin supporting Thebes will be the resentment to which my opponents\r\nthemselves will deservedly be exposed, for depriving the city of such\r\nallies as these, when they have appealed to you before appealing to\r\nThebes. {20} Such a policy is surely the policy of men who wish to make\r\nthe Arcadians for the second time the allies of others. And so far as\r\none can forecast the future by calculation, I am sure, and I believe\r\nthat most of you will agree with me, that if the Spartans take\r\nMegalopolis, Messene will be in peril; and if they take Messene also,\r\nthen I predict that we shall find ourselves allies of Thebes.[n] {21}\r\nIt is a far more honourable, a far better, course that we should\r\nourselves take over the Theban confederacy,[n] refusing to leave the\r\nfield open to the cupidity of the Spartans, than that we should be so\r\nafraid of protecting the allies of Thebes, as first to sacrifice them,\r\nand then to save Thebes itself; and, in addition, to be in a state of\r\napprehension for our own safety. {22} For if the Spartans capture\r\nMegalopolis and become a great power once more, the prospect, as I\r\nconceive it, is not one which this city can view without alarm. For I\r\ncan see that even now they are determining to go to war, not to prevent\r\nany evil which threatens them, but to recover their own ancient power:\r\nand what their aims were when they possessed that power, you, I think,\r\nknow[n] perhaps better than I, and with that knowledge may well be\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n{23} Now I should be glad if the speakers who profess their hatred for\r\nThebes on the one side, or for Sparta on the other, would tell me if\r\ntheir professed hatred is based on consideration for you and your\r\ninterests, or whether the one party hates Thebes from an interest in\r\nSparta, and the other Sparta from an interest in Thebes. If the latter\r\nis the case, you should not listen to either, but treat them as insane:\r\nbut if the former, why this inordinate exaltation of one side or the\r\nother? {24} For it is possible, perfectly possible, to humiliate Thebes\r\nwithout rendering Sparta powerful. Indeed, it is by far the easier\r\ncourse; and I will try to tell you how it can be done. We all know\r\nthat, however unwilling men may be to do what is right, yet up to a\r\ncertain point they are ashamed not to do so, and that they withstand\r\nwrongdoers openly, particularly if there are any who receive damage\r\nthrough the wrong done: and we shall find that what ruins everything\r\nand is the source of all evil is the unwillingness to do what is right\r\nwithout reserve. {25} Now in order that no such obstacle may stand in\r\nthe way of the humiliation of Thebes, let us demand the\r\nre-establishment of Thespiae, Orchomenus, and Plataeae, co-operating\r\nwith their citizens ourselves, and requiring others to do so; for the\r\nprinciple of refusing to allow ancient cities to lie desolate is a\r\nright and honourable one. But let us at the same time decline to\r\nabandon Megalopolis and Messene to the aggressors, or to suffer the\r\ndestruction of existing and inhabited cities, on the pretext of\r\nrestoring Plataeae and Thespiae. {26} Then, if our policy is made plain\r\nto all, there is no one who will not wish to terminate the Thebans'\r\noccupation of territory not their own. But if it is not, not only will\r\nour designs be opposed by the Arcadians, in the belief that the\r\nrestoration of these towns carries with it their own ruin, but we shall\r\nhave troubles without end. For, honestly, where can we expect to reach\r\nan end, when we permit the annihilation of existing cities, and require\r\nthe restoration of those that have been annihilated?\r\n\r\n{27} It is demanded by those whose speeches display the strongest\r\nappearance of fairness, that the Megalopolitans shall take down the\r\npillars[n] which commemorate their alliance with Thebes, if they are to\r\nbe trustworthy allies of Athens. The Megalopolitans reply that for them\r\nit is not pillars, but interest, that creates friendship; and that it\r\nis those who help them, that they consider to be their allies. Well,\r\nthat may be their attitude. Nevertheless, my own view is, roughly\r\nspeaking, this:--I say that we should simultaneously require the\r\nMegalopolitans to take down the pillars, and the Spartans to keep the\r\npeace: and that in the event of either side refusing to fulfil our\r\nrequest, we should at once take the part of those who are willing to\r\nfulfil it. {28} For if the Megalopolitans obtain peace, and yet adhere\r\nto the Theban alliance, it will be clear to all that they prefer the\r\ngrasping policy of Thebes to that which is right. If, on the other\r\nhand, Megalopolis makes alliance frankly with us, and the Spartans then\r\nrefuse to keep the peace, it will surely be clear to all that what the\r\nSpartans desire so eagerly is not the re-establishment of Thespiae, but\r\nan opportunity of subduing the Peloponnese while the Thebans are\r\ninvolved in the war.[n] {29} And I am surprised to find that there are\r\nsome who are alarmed at the prospect of the enemies of Sparta becoming\r\nallies of Thebes, and yet see nothing to fear in the subjugation of\r\nthese enemies by Sparta herself; whereas the experience of the past can\r\nteach us that the Thebans always use such allies against Sparta, while,\r\nwhen Sparta had them, she used to use them against us.\r\n\r\n{30} There is another point which I think you should consider. Suppose\r\nthat you reject the overtures of the Megalopolitans. If they are\r\nannihilated and dispersed, Sparta can recover her power at once. If\r\nthey actually survive--for things have happened before now beyond all\r\nhope--they will quite rightly be the firm allies of Thebes. But suppose\r\nyou receive them. Then the immediate result, so far as they are\r\nconcerned, is that they are saved by you: and as to the future, let us\r\nnow transfer our calculation of possible risks to the case of the\r\nThebans and Spartans. {31} If the Thebans are crushed, as they ought to\r\nbe, the Spartans will not be unduly powerful, for they will always have\r\nthese Arcadians at their doors to hold them in check. But if the\r\nThebans actually recover and survive the attack, they will at least be\r\nweaker; for the Arcadians will have become our allies, and will owe\r\ntheir preservation to us. Thus on every ground it is to our interest\r\nnot to sacrifice the Arcadians, nor to let them think that their\r\ndeliverance, if they are really saved, is due to themselves, or to any\r\nother people than you.\r\n\r\n{32} And now, men of Athens, I solemnly declare that what I have said\r\nhas been prompted by no personal feeling, friendly or hostile, towards\r\neither side. I have told you only what I believe to be expedient for\r\nyou; and I exhort you not to sacrifice the people of Megalopolis, and\r\nto make it your rule, never to sacrifice a smaller power to a greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE FREEDOM OF THE RHODIANS (OR. XV)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. Dionysius of Halicarnassus places the speech in 351\r\nB.C. He is not always accurate, and the internal evidence has been\r\nthought by some to suggest a date perhaps two years earlier. The\r\nreasons, however, for this are not strong, and there has recently been\r\na disposition to accept Dionysius' date.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the Social War, Chios, Cos, Rhodes, and Byzantium had\r\nmade themselves independent of Athens. They had been assisted by\r\nMausolus, King of Caria, a vassal of Persia. After the termination of\r\nthe war, a Carian garrison occupied Cos and Rhodes; the democratic\r\nconstitution of Rhodes was overthrown and the democratic party driven\r\ninto banishment, as the result of an oligarchic plot, which Mausolus\r\nhad fostered. In 353 Mausolus died, and was succeeded by Artemisia, his\r\nsister and wife. The exiles appealed to Athens for restoration, and for\r\nthe liberation of Rhodes from the Carian domination. It is evident that\r\nthe feeling in Athens against the Rhodians was very strong, owing to\r\ntheir part in the late war, for which the democratic party had been\r\nresponsible; and there was some fear of the possible consequences of\r\noffending Artemisia and perhaps becoming involved in war with Persia.\r\nDemosthenes, nevertheless, urges the people to assist them, and to\r\nforget their misconduct. He appeals to the traditional policy of\r\nAthens, as the saviour of the oppressed and protectress of democracies,\r\nand warns them of the danger which would threaten Athens herself, if\r\nthe conversion of free constitutions into oligarchies were allowed to\r\ngo unchecked. He takes a different view from that of his opponents of\r\nthe probable attitude of Artemisia, and utters an impressive warning\r\nagainst corrupt and unpatriotic statesmen, which foreshadows his more\r\nvehement attacks in the orations against Philip.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was unsuccessful, for in the speech on the Peace (§ 25)\r\nDemosthenes speaks of Cos and Rhodes as still subject to Caria.\r\n\r\nThe speech is more eloquent than the last, and more outspoken.\r\nPolitical principles and ideals are enunciated with some confidence,\r\nand illustrated by striking examples from history. But there also\r\nappears for the first time that sense of the difficulty of rousing the\r\nAthenians to action of any kind, which is so strongly expressed in\r\nlater speeches.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} It is, I think, your duty, men of Athens, when you are deliberating\r\nupon affairs of such importance, to grant freedom of speech to every\r\none of your advisers. And for my part, I have never yet felt any\r\ndifficulty in pointing out to you the best course; for I believe that,\r\nbroadly speaking, you all know from the first what this is. My\r\ndifficulty is to persuade you to act upon your knowledge. For when a\r\nmeasure is approved and passed by you, it is as far from execution as\r\nit was before you resolved upon it. {2} Well, you have to render thanks\r\nto Heaven for this, among other favours--that those who went to war\r\nwith you not long ago, moved by their own insolent pride, now place\r\ntheir own hopes of preservation in you alone. Well may we rejoice at\r\nour present opportunity! For if your decision in regard to it is what\r\nit should be, you will find yourselves meeting the calumnies of those\r\nwho are slandering this city with a practical and a glorious\r\nrefutation. {3} For the peoples of Chios, Byzantium, and Rhodes accused\r\nus of entertaining designs against them; and on this ground they\r\ncombined against us in the recent war. But now it will be seen[n] that,\r\nwhile Mausolus, who under the pretence of friendship towards Rhodes,\r\ndirected and instigated their efforts, in reality robbed the Rhodians\r\nof their freedom; while their declared allies, Chios and Byzantium,\r\nnever came to aid them in their misfortunes; {4} you, of whom they were\r\nafraid, and you alone, have been the authors of their salvation. And\r\nbecause all the world will have seen this, you will cause the popular\r\nparty in every city to consider your friendship a guarantee of their\r\nown safety; nor could you reap any greater blessing than the goodwill\r\nwhich will thus be offered to you, spontaneously and without\r\nmisgivings, upon every hand.\r\n\r\n{5} I notice, to my surprise, that those who urge us to oppose the king\r\nin the interest of the Egyptians,[n] are the very persons who are so\r\nafraid of him when it is the interest of the popular party in Rhodes\r\nthat is in question. And yet it is known to every one that the Rhodians\r\nare Hellenes, while the Egyptians have a place assigned them in the\r\nPersian Empire. {6} I expect that some of you remember that, when you\r\nwere discussing our relations with the king, I came forward and was the\r\nfirst to advise you[n] (though I had, I believe, no supporters, or one\r\nat the most), that you would show your good sense, in my opinion, if\r\nyou did not make your hostility to the king the pretext of your\r\npreparations, but prepared yourselves against the enemies whom you\r\nalready had; though you would resist him also, if he attempted to do\r\nyou any injury. {7} Nor, when I spoke thus, did I fail to convince you,\r\nbut you also approved of this policy. What I have now to say is the\r\nsequel to my argument on that occasion. For if the king were to call me\r\nto his side and make me his counsellor, I should give him the same\r\nadvice as I gave you--namely, that he should fight in defence of his\r\nown possessions, if he were opposed by any Hellenic power, but should\r\nabsolutely forego all claim to what in no way belongs to him. {8} If,\r\ntherefore, you have made a general resolve, men of Athens, to retire\r\nfrom any place of which the king makes himself master, either by\r\nsurprise or by the deception of some of the inhabitants, you have not\r\nresolved well, in my judgement: but if you are prepared, in defence of\r\nyour rights, even to fight, if need be, and to endure anything that may\r\nbe necessary, not only will the need for such a step be less, the more\r\nfirmly your minds are made up, but you will also be regarded as showing\r\nthe spirit which you ought to show.\r\n\r\n{9} To prove to you that I am not suggesting anything unprecedented in\r\nbidding you liberate the Rhodians, and that you will not be acting\r\nwithout precedent, if you take my advice, I will remind you of one of\r\nthose incidents in the past which have ended happily for you. You once\r\nsent out Timotheus, men of Athens, to assist Ariobarzanes,[n] adding to\r\nyour resolution the provision that he must not break our treaty with\r\nthe king; and Timotheus, seeing that Ariobarzanes was now openly in\r\nrevolt against the king, but that Samos was occupied by a garrison\r\nunder Cyprothemis, who had been placed there by Tigranes, the king's\r\nviceroy, abandoned his intention of helping Ariobarzanes, but sat down\r\nbefore Samos, relieved it, and set it free. {10} And to this day no war\r\nhas ever arisen to trouble you on account of this. For to enter upon a\r\nwar for the purpose of aggrandizement is never the same thing as to do\r\nso in defence of one's own possessions. Every one fights his hardest to\r\nrecover what he has lost; but when men endeavour to gain at the expense\r\nof others, it is not so. They desire to do this, if it is allowed them;\r\nbut if they are prevented, they do not consider that their opponents\r\nhave done them any wrong.\r\n\r\n{11} Now listen for a moment, and consider whether I am right or wrong,\r\nwhen I conclude that if Athens were actively at work, Artemisia herself\r\nwould now not even oppose our action. If the king effects in Egypt all\r\nthat he is bent upon, I believe that Artemisia would make every attempt\r\nto secure for him the continued possession of Rhodes--not from any\r\ngoodwill towards him, but from the desire to be credited with a great\r\nservice to him, while he is still in her neighbourhood,[n] and so to\r\nwin from him as friendly a reception as possible. {12} But if he is\r\nfaring as we are told, if all his attempts have failed, she will\r\nconsider, and rightly, that the island can be of no further use to the\r\nking, except as a fortified post to command her own dominions--a\r\nsecurity against any movement on her part. Accordingly she would\r\nprefer, I believe, that you should have it, without her openly\r\nsurrendering it to you, rather than that he should occupy it. I think,\r\ntherefore, that she would not even make an attempt to save it; or that\r\nif she actually did so, it would be but weakly and ineffectively. {13}\r\nFor although I cannot, of course, profess to know what the king will\r\ndo, I must insist that it is high time that it should be made clear, in\r\nthe interests of Athens, whether he intends to lay claim to Rhodes or\r\nnot: for if he does so, we have then to take counsel, not for the\r\nRhodians alone, but for ourselves and for the Hellenes as a whole.\r\n\r\n{14} At the same time, even if the Rhodians who are now in\r\npossession[n] of the town held it by their own strength, I should never\r\nhave urged you to take them for your allies, for all the promises in\r\nthe world. For I observe that they took to their side some of their\r\nfellow citizens, to help them overthrow the democracy, and that, having\r\ndone this, they turned and expelled them: and I do not think that men\r\nwho failed to keep faith with either party would ever be trustworthy\r\nallies for yourselves. {15} And further, I should never have made my\r\npresent proposal, had I been thinking only of the interests of the\r\npopular party in Rhodes. I am not their official patron,[n] nor have I\r\na single personal friend among them; and even if both these things were\r\notherwise, I should not have made this proposal, had I not believed it\r\nto be for your advantage. For as for the Rhodians, if I may use such an\r\nexpression when I am pleading with you to save them, I share your\r\njoy[1] at what has happened to them. For it is because they grudged you\r\nthe recovery of your rights that they have lost their own freedom; and\r\nthat, instead of the equal alliance which they might have had with\r\nHellenes, better than themselves, they are in bondage to foreigners and\r\nslaves, whom they have admitted to their citadels. {16} Indeed, if you\r\nresolve to go to their aid, I may almost say that this calamity has\r\nbeen good for them; for, Rhodians as they are, I doubt if they would\r\never have come to their right mind in prosperity; whereas actual\r\nexperience has now taught them that folly generally leads to manifold\r\nadversities; and perhaps they will be wiser for the future. This\r\nlesson, I feel sure, will be no small advantage to them. I say then\r\nthat you should endeavour to save these men, and should bear no malice,\r\nremembering that you too have been greatly deceived by conspirators\r\nagainst you, and yet would not admit that you deserved yourselves to\r\nsuffer for such mistakes.\r\n\r\nObserve this also, men of Athens. {17} You have waged many wars both\r\nagainst democracies and against oligarchies; and of this no doubt you\r\nare as well aware as I. But I doubt whether any of you considers for\r\nwhat objects you are fighting in each case. What then are these\r\nobjects? In fighting against a democracy, you are fighting either over\r\nsome private quarrel, when the parties have failed to settle their\r\ndisputes by the means publicly provided;[n] or you are contending for a\r\npiece of territory, or about a boundary, or for a point of honour, or\r\nfor paramountcy. But in fighting against an oligarchy, it is not for\r\nany such objects--it is your constitution and your freedom that are at\r\nstake. {18} And therefore I should not hesitate to say that I believe\r\nit would be better for you, that all the Hellenic peoples should be\r\ndemocracies, and be at war with you, than that they should be governed\r\nby oligarchies, and be your friends. For with a free people you would\r\nhave no difficulty, I believe, in making peace whenever you desired:\r\nbut with an oligarchical State friendship itself cannot be safe. For\r\nthere can be no goodwill between Few and Many--between those who seek\r\nfor mastery, and those who have chosen the life of political equality.\r\n\r\n{19} It surprises me also that though Chios and Mytilene are ruled by\r\noligarchies, and though now the Rhodians and all mankind, I may almost\r\nsay, are being brought into the same bondage, no one considers that any\r\ndanger threatens our own constitution also, or reflects that if every\r\nState is organized upon an oligarchic basis, it is not possible that\r\nyour own democracy should be suffered to remain. For they know that no\r\npeople but you could ever bring them forth into a state of liberty\r\nagain; and they will wish to put an end to so likely a source of\r\ntrouble to themselves. {20} As a rule we may regard wrongdoers as\r\nenemies only to those whom they have wronged. But when men destroy free\r\nconstitutions and convert them into oligarchies, I say that you must\r\nthink of them as the common enemies of all whose hearts are set on\r\nfreedom. {21} Again, men of Athens, it is only right that you, a\r\ndemocracy yourselves, should show towards other democracies in distress\r\nthe same spirit as you would expect them to show towards you, if any\r\nsuch calamity (which God forbid!) should happen to you. It may be said\r\nthat the Rhodians are justly punished. If so, this is not the time to\r\nexult over them. When men are prosperous they should always be found\r\ntaking thought how best to help the distressed; for the future is\r\nunknown to all men.\r\n\r\n{22} I have often heard it stated here in your presence, that when our\r\ndemocracy had met with disaster,[n] you were joined by certain others\r\nin your anxiety for its preservation. Of these I will only refer on the\r\npresent occasion to the Argives, and that briefly. For I cannot desire\r\nthat you, who enjoy the reputation of being always the saviours of the\r\ndistressed, should prove inferior to the Argives in that work. These\r\nArgives, though their territory borders on that of the Spartans, whom\r\nthey saw to be masters by land and sea, neither hesitated nor feared to\r\ndisplay their goodwill towards you; but when envoys came from Sparta\r\n(so the story goes) to demand the persons of certain Athenian refugees,\r\nthey even voted that unless the envoys departed before sunset, they\r\nshould be adjudged public enemies. {23} If then the democracy of Argos\r\nin those days showed no fear of the might of the Spartan Empire, will\r\nit not be a disgrace if you, who are Athenians, are afraid of one who\r\nis a barbarian--aye, and a woman?[n] The Argives, moreover, could point\r\nto many defeats sustained at the hands of Sparta, while you have often\r\ndefeated the king, and have not once proved inferior either to his\r\nservants or to himself. For if ever the king has gained any success\r\nagainst Athens, it has been by bribing the basest of the Hellenes to\r\nbetray their countrymen; in no other way has he ever succeeded. {24}\r\nIndeed, even such success has done him no good. You will find that no\r\nsooner had he rendered Athens weak,[n] by the help of the Spartans,\r\nthan he had to fight for his own kingdom against Clearchus and Cyrus.\r\nHis successes, therefore, have not been won in the open field, nor have\r\nhis plots brought him any good. Now some of you, I notice, are in the\r\nhabit of speaking contemptuously of Philip, as though he were not worth\r\nreckoning with; while you dread the king, as a powerful enemy to any\r\nwhom he chooses to oppose. But if we are not to defend ourselves\r\nagainst Philip, because he is so mean a foe, and are to give way in\r\neverything to the king, because he is so formidable, who is there, men\r\nof Athens, against whom we shall ever take the field?\r\n\r\n{25} Men of Athens, you have among you those who are particularly\r\nskilful in pleading with you the rights of the rest of the world; and I\r\nshould be glad to give them this single piece of advice--that they\r\nshould seek to plead your rights with the rest of the world,[n] and so\r\nset an example of duty. It is monstrous to instruct you about rights,\r\nwithout doing right oneself; and it is not right that a fellow citizen\r\nof yours should have studied all the arguments against you and none of\r\nthose in your favour. {26} Ask yourselves, in God's name, why it is\r\nthat there is no one in Byzantium to tell the Byzantines that they must\r\nnot occupy Chalcedon,[n] which belongs to the king and formerly\r\nbelonged to you, but upon which they had no sort of claim; or that they\r\nmust not make Selymbria, once your ally, a contributory portion of the\r\nByzantine state; or include the territory of Selymbria[n] within the\r\nByzantine frontier, in defiance of the sworn treaty which ordains the\r\nindependence of the cities? {27} Why was there no one to tell Mausolus,\r\nwhile he lived, and Artemisia after his death, that they must not\r\noccupy Cos and Rhodes and other Hellenic cities as well, which the king\r\ntheir master ceded to the Hellenes by the treaty,[n] and for the sake\r\nof which the Hellenes of those days faced many a peril and fought many\r\na gallant fight? Even if there actually are such advisers[n] in both\r\ncases, at least it is not likely that they will find listeners. {28}\r\nFor my part I believe that it is right to restore the exiled democracy\r\nof Rhodes. But even if it were not right, I think it would be proper to\r\nurge you to do it, when I consider the course taken by such speakers as\r\nthese; and for this reason. If all the world, men of Athens, were bent\r\nupon doing right, it would be a disgrace to us if we alone were\r\nunwilling to do so: but when all the world is preparing itself in order\r\nto be able to commit wrong, then for us alone to abstain from every\r\nenterprise, on the plea of right, is no righteousness, to my mind, but\r\ncowardice. For I observe that the extent to which rights are admitted\r\nis always in proportion to the claimant's power at the moment. {29} I\r\ncan illustrate this by an instance familiar to all of you. There are\r\ntwo treaties[n] between the Hellenes and the king. The first was made\r\nby our own city, and all men praise it; the second by the Spartans, and\r\nit is denounced by all. The rights defined in these two treaties are\r\nnot the same. For whereas a common and equal share of private rights is\r\ngiven by law to weak and strong alike, in a settlement of international\r\nrights it is the stronger who legislate for the weaker.\r\n\r\nWell, you already know what the right course is.[n] {30} It remains to\r\ninquire how you can carry out your knowledge into action; and this will\r\nbe possible, if you come to be regarded as public champions of\r\nuniversal liberty. But the great difficulty which you find in doing\r\nyour duty is, to my mind, natural enough. All other men have only one\r\nconflict to face--the conflict with their declared foes; and when these\r\nare subdued, there is no further obstacle to their secure enjoyment of\r\ntheir happiness. {31} But for you there is a double conflict. In\r\naddition to that to which all men are liable, there is another which is\r\nharder, and which must be faced first: for you have to win the victory\r\nin your councils over those who are deliberately working in your midst\r\nagainst the interests of the city; and because, thanks to them, you can\r\neffect nothing that is demanded of you without a struggle, it is\r\nnatural that you should often miss your mark. {32} The chief reason for\r\nthe fearless adoption of such a course in public life by so many men is\r\nperhaps to be found in the benefits which they obtain from those who\r\nhire them. Yet at the same time, some of the blame may fairly be laid\r\nat your own doors. For you ought, men of Athens, to think of a man's\r\npost in public life as you think of his post in the army in the field.\r\nAnd how do you think of this? If a man leaves the post assigned to him\r\nby his general, you think that he deserves to be disfranchised and to\r\nlose all share in the privileges of a citizen. {33} And so when men\r\ndesert the post of civil duty, committed to them by our forefathers,\r\nand follow an oligarchical[n] policy, they should forfeit the privilege\r\nof acting as advisers to yourselves. As it is, while you believe that\r\nthose of your allies are best disposed towards you, who have sworn to\r\nhave the same friends and foes as yourselves, the politicians in whom\r\nyou place most faith are those whom you well know to have chosen the\r\nside of the enemies of Athens.\r\n\r\n{34} It is easy enough, however, to find reasons for accusing them and\r\nreproaching all of you. But to find words or actions which will enable\r\nus to rectify what is now amiss with us, is a task indeed. Moreover,\r\nthe present is not, perhaps, the time for entering into every point:\r\nbut if only you can confirm the policy which you have chosen by some\r\nsuitable action, it may be that other conditions will each in turn show\r\nsome improvement. {35} I think, therefore, that you ought to take this\r\nenterprise in hand with vigour, and to act worthily of your country.\r\nRemember with what delight you listen to the praises of your\r\nforefathers,[n] the recital of their deeds, the enumeration of their\r\ntrophies. Consider then that your forefathers dedicated these trophies,\r\nnot that you might gaze at them in idle wonder, but that you might\r\nimitate the actions of those who placed them there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] [Greek: humin sygchair_o].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PHILIPPIC (OR. IV)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. Philip became King of Macedonia in 359 B.C. Being in\r\ngreat difficulties both from external enemies and from internal\r\ndivision, he made peace with the Athenians, who were supporting the\r\npretensions of Argaeus to the throne, in the hope of recovering (by\r\nagreement with Argaeus) the colony of Amphipolis on the Strymon, which\r\nthey had lost in 424. Philip acknowledged the title of Athens to\r\nAmphipolis, and sent home the Athenian prisoners, whom he had captured\r\namong the supporters of Argaeus, without ransom. The Athenians,\r\nhowever, neglected to garrison Amphipolis. In 358 (the year in which\r\nAthens temporarily recovered her hold over Euboea, by compelling the\r\nThebans to evacuate the island), Philip carried on a successful\r\ncampaign against the Paeonian and Illyrian tribes, who were standing\r\nenemies of Macedonia. For the next three years Athens was kept occupied\r\nby the war with her allies, and Philip saw his opportunity. He besieged\r\nAmphipolis: when the citizens sent Hierax and Stratocles to ask Athens\r\nfor help, he dispatched a letter promising the Athenians that he would\r\ngive them Amphipolis when he had taken it; and a secret understanding\r\nwas arrived at between Philip and the Athenian envoys sent to him, that\r\nAthens should give him Pydna (once a Macedonian town, but now an ally\r\nof Athens) in exchange. Athens, therefore, listened neither to\r\nAmphipolis nor to Olynthus, which had also made overtures to her. The\r\nOlynthians in consequence made a treaty with Philip, who gave them\r\nAnthemus and promised to help them against their old rival Poteidaea, a\r\ntown in alliance with Athens. The Olynthians on their part agreed not\r\nto make peace with Athens except in conjunction with him. But Philip,\r\nwhen he had captured Amphipolis by a combination of siege and intrigue,\r\ndid not give it up to Athens, and instead of waiting to receive Pydna\r\nfrom Athens, besieged and took it, aided once more by treachery from\r\nwithin. In 356 he took Poteidaea (in conjunction with the Olynthians,\r\nto whom he gave the town), the Athenians arriving too late to relieve\r\nit; and then pursued his conquests along the Thracian coast. Further\r\ninland he expelled the Thasians (allies of Athens) from Crenides and\r\nfounded Philippi on the site, in the centre of the gold-mines of Mount\r\nPangaeus, from which he henceforward derived a very large revenue;\r\nwhile the forests of the district provided him with timber for\r\nship-building, of which he took full advantage: for in the next few\r\nyears his ships made descents upon the Athenian islands of Lemnos and\r\nImbros, plundered the Athenian corn-vessels off the coast of Euboea,\r\nand even landed a force at Marathon. In the latter part of 356 and in\r\n355 he was occupied with the conquest of the Paeonians and Illyrians,\r\nwith whom Athens had made an alliance in 356. At the end of 355 he laid\r\nsiege to Methone, the last Athenian port on the Thermaic gulf, and\r\ncaptured it in 354. (Some place the siege and capture of Methone in\r\n354-3, but an inscription, C.I.G. II. 70, makes it at least probable\r\nthat the siege had begun by the last month of 355.) In 353 Philip made\r\nhis way to the Thracian coast, and conquered Abdera and Maroneia. At\r\nMaroneia we find him in company with Pammenes (his former host at\r\nThebes), who had been sent by the Thebans to assist Artabazus in his\r\nrevolt against the Persian king; and at the same place he received\r\nApollonides of Cardia, the envoy of the Thracian prince Cersobleptes.\r\nOn his way home his ships escaped from Chares, off Neapolis, by a ruse.\r\nIn the same year he interfered in the affairs of Thessaly, where the\r\nAleuadae of Larissa had invited his assistance against Lycophron and\r\nPeitholaus of Pherae, who had invoked the aid of the Phocians. (In\r\nopposing the Phocians, the antagonists of the Thebans in the Sacred\r\nWar, Philip was also helping the Thebans themselves, and gaining credit\r\nas the opponent of the plunderers of the temple of Apollo at Delphi.)\r\nOnomarchus, the Phocian leader, twice defeated Philip, but was\r\noverthrown and slain in 352. Philip took Pherae and Pagasae (its port),\r\noccupied Magnesia, and, by means of promises, obtained financial aid\r\nfrom the Thessalians. The expedition sent by Athens to relieve Pagasae\r\narrived too late; but when Philip, after putting down the tyrants of\r\nPherae and arranging matters in Thessaly, advanced towards the Pass of\r\nThermopylae, an Athenian force, sent on the advice of Diophantus and\r\nEubulus, appeared in time to oblige him to retire to Macedonia. Late in\r\nthe autumn of 352 we find him once more in Thrace. It was probably now\r\nthat he assisted the peoples of Byzantium and Perinthus, together with\r\nAmadocus, a rival of Cersobleptes, against the latter; with the result\r\nthat Cersobleptes was obliged to give up his son to Philip as a\r\nhostage. Philip had also made alliance with Cardia, which, like\r\nByzantium, was on bad terms with Athens. He now laid siege to Heraeon\r\nTeichos, a fortress on the Propontis, but illness obliged him to\r\nsuspend operations, and the rumour of his death prevented the Athenians\r\nfrom sending against him the expedition which they had resolved upon.\r\n(The retention of her influence in this region was essential for\r\nAthens, if her corn-supply was to be secure.) In 351, on recovering\r\nfrom his illness, he entered the territory of Olynthus, which, contrary\r\nto the agreement with him, had made peace with Athens in the previous\r\nyear, apart from himself: but he did not at present pursue the invasion\r\nfurther. In October 351 Athens sent Charidemus to the Hellespont with\r\nten ships, but no soldiers and little money. If these are the ships\r\nalluded to in § 43 of the present Speech, the Speech must have been\r\ndelivered after that date. Otherwise any date after Philip's incursion\r\ninto the territory of Olynthus would suit the contents of the Speech,\r\nand many writers place it earlier in the year. The question of the\r\nrelations of Athens with Philip had been brought forward; and\r\nDemosthenes, who had risen first to speak, proposes the creation of a\r\nlarge permanent fleet, and of a smaller force for immediate action,\r\nlaying great stress on the necessity of sending Athenian citizens both\r\nto command and to form a substantial proportion of the troops, which,\r\nhad so far been mostly mercenaries. The scheme was worked out in\r\ndetail, both in its military and in its financial aspects, and\r\nsupported with an eloquence and an earnestness which are far in advance\r\nof those displayed in the earlier speeches.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, that the Speech as we have\r\nit, is really a conflation of two speeches, of which the second\r\n(beginning at § 30) was delivered in 347, is generally (and rightly)\r\ndiscredited.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} If some new subject were being brought before us, men of Athens, I\r\nwould have waited until most of your ordinary advisers had declared\r\ntheir opinion; and if anything that they said were satisfactory to me,\r\nI would have remained silent, and only if it were not so, would I have\r\nattempted to express my own view. But since we find ourselves once more\r\nconsidering a question upon which they have often spoken, I think I may\r\nreasonably be pardoned for rising first of all. For if their advice to\r\nyou in the past had been what it ought to have been, you would have had\r\nno occasion for the present debate.\r\n\r\n{2} In the first place, then, men of Athens, we must not be downhearted\r\nat our present situation, however wretched it may seem to be. For in\r\nthe worst feature of the past lies our best hope for the future-in the\r\nfact, that is, that we are in our present plight because you are not\r\ndoing your duty in any respect; for if you were doing all that you\r\nshould do, and we were still in this evil case, we could not then even\r\nhope for any improvement. {3} In the second place, you must bear in\r\nmind (what some of you have heard from others, and those who know can\r\nrecollect for themselves), how powerful the Spartans were, not long\r\nago, and yet how noble and patriotic your own conduct was, when instead\r\nof doing anything unworthy of your country you faced the war with\r\nSparta [n] in defence of the right. [n] Now why do I remind you of\r\nthese things? It is because, men of Athens, I wish you to see and to\r\nrealize, that so long as you are on your guard you have nothing to\r\nfear; but that if you are indifferent, nothing can be as you would\r\nwish: for this is exemplified for you both by the power of Sparta in\r\nthose days, to which you rose superior because you gave your minds to\r\nyour affairs; and by the insolence of Philip to-day, which troubles us\r\nbecause we care nothing for the things which should concern us. {4} If,\r\nhowever, any of you, men of Athens, when he considers the immense force\r\nnow at Philip's command, and the city's loss of all her strongholds,\r\nthinks that Philip is a foe hard to conquer, I ask him (right though he\r\nis in his belief) to reflect also that there was a time when we\r\npossessed Pydna and Poteidaea and Methone; when all the surrounding\r\ncountry was our own, and many of the tribes [n] which are now on his\r\nside were free and independent, and more inclined to be friendly to us\r\nthan to him. {5} Now if in those days Philip had made up his mind that\r\nit was a hard thing to fight against the Athenians, with all their\r\nfortified outposts on his own frontiers, while he was destitute of\r\nallies, he would have achieved none of his recent successes, nor\r\nacquired this great power. But Philip saw quite clearly, men of Athens,\r\nthat all these strongholds were prizes of war, displayed for\r\ncompetition. He saw that in the nature of things the property of the\r\nabsent belongs to those who are on the spot, and that of the negligent\r\nto those who are ready for toil and danger. {6} It is, as you know, by\r\nacting upon this belief, that he has brought all those places under his\r\npower, and now holds them--some of them by right of capture in war,\r\nothers in virtue of alliances and friendly understandings; for every\r\none is willing to grant alliance and to give attention to those whom\r\nthey see to be prepared and ready to take action as is necessary. {7}\r\nIf then, men of Athens, you also will resolve to adopt this principle\r\nto-day--the principle which you have never observed before--if each of\r\nyou can henceforward be relied upon to throw aside all this pretence of\r\nincapacity, and to act where his duty bids him, and where his services\r\ncan be of use to his country; if he who has money will contribute, and\r\nhe who is of military age will join the campaign; if, in one plain\r\nword, you will resolve henceforth to depend absolutely on yourselves,\r\neach man no longer hoping that he will need to do nothing himself, and\r\nthat his neighbour will do everything for him; then, God willing, you\r\nwill recover your own; you will take back all that your indolence has\r\nlost, and you will have your revenge upon Philip. {8} Do not imagine\r\nthat his fortune is built to last for ever, as if he were a God. He\r\nalso has those who hate him and fear him, men of Athens, and envy him\r\ntoo, even among those who now seem to be his closest friends. All the\r\nfeelings that exist in any other body of men must be supposed to exist\r\nin Philip's supporters. Now, however, all such feelings are cowed\r\nbefore him: your slothful apathy has taken away their only rallying\r\npoint; and it is this apathy that I bid you put off to-day. {9} Mark\r\nthe situation, men of Athens: mark the pitch which the man's outrageous\r\ninsolence has reached, when he does not even give you a choice between\r\naction and inaction, but threatens you, and utters (as we are told)\r\nhaughty language: for he is not the man to rest content in possession\r\nof his conquests: he is always casting his net wider; and while we\r\nprocrastinate and sit idle, he is setting his toils around us on every\r\nside. {10} When, then, men of Athens, when, I say, will you take the\r\naction that is required? What are you waiting for? 'We are waiting,'\r\nyou say, 'till it is necessary.' But what must we think of all that is\r\nhappening at this present time? Surely the strongest necessity that a\r\nfree people can experience is the shame which they must feel at their\r\nposition! What? Do you want to go round asking one another, 'Is there\r\nany news?' Could there be any stranger news than that a man of\r\nMacedonia is defeating Athenians in war, and ordering the affairs of\r\nthe Hellenes? {11} 'Is Philip dead?' 'No, but he is sick.' And what\r\ndifference does it make to you? For if anything should happen to him,\r\nyou will soon raise up for yourselves a second Philip, if it is thus\r\nthat you attend to your interests. Indeed, Philip himself has not risen\r\nto this excessive height through his own strength, so much as through\r\nour neglect. I go even further. {12} If anything happened to Philip--if\r\nthe operation of Fortune, who always cares for us better than we care\r\nfor ourselves, were to effect this too for us--you know that if you\r\nwere at hand, you could descend upon the general confusion and order\r\neverything as you wished; but in your present condition, even if\r\ncircumstances offered you Amphipolis, you could not take it; for your\r\nforces and your minds alike are far away.\r\n\r\n{13} Well, I say no more of the obligation which rests upon you all to\r\nbe willing and ready to do your duty; I will assume that you are\r\nresolved and convinced. But the nature of the armament which, I\r\nbelieve, will set you free from such troubles as these, the numbers of\r\nthe force, the source from which we must obtain funds, and the best and\r\nquickest way, as it seems to me, of making all further\r\npreparations--all this, men of Athens, I will at once endeavour to\r\nexplain when I have made one request of you. {14} Give your verdict on\r\nmy proposal when you have heard the whole of it; do not prejudge it\r\nbefore I have done; and if at first the force which I propose appears\r\nunprecedented, do not think that I am merely creating delays. It is not\r\nthose whose cry is 'At once', 'To-day', whose proposals will meet our\r\nneed; for what has already happened cannot be prevented by any\r\nexpedition now. {15} It is rather he who can show the nature, the\r\nmagnitude, and the financial possibility of a force which when provided\r\nwill be able to continue in existence either until we are persuaded to\r\nbreak off the war, or until we have overcome the enemy; for thus only\r\ncan we escape further calamity for the future. These things I believe I\r\ncan show, though I would not stand in the way of any other speaker's\r\nprofessions. It is no less a promise than this that I make; the event\r\nwill soon test its fulfilment, and you will be the judges of it.\r\n\r\nFirst then, men of Athens, I say that fifty warships must {16} at once\r\nbe got in readiness: and next, that you must be in such a frame of mind\r\nthat, if any need arises, you will embark in person and sail. In\r\naddition, you must prepare transports for half our cavalry, and a\r\nsufficient number of boats. {17} These, I think, should be in readiness\r\nto meet those sudden sallies of his from his own country against\r\nThermopylae, the Chersonese, Olynthus, and any other place which he may\r\nselect. For we must make him realize that there is a possibility of\r\nyour rousing yourselves out of your excessive indifference, just as\r\nwhen once you went to Euboea,[n] and before that (as we are told) to\r\nHaliartus,[n] and finally, only the other day, to Thermopylae. {18}\r\nSuch a possibility, even if you are unlikely to make it a reality, as I\r\nthink you ought to do, is not one which he can treat lightly; and you\r\nmay thus secure one of two objects. On the one hand, he may know that\r\nyou are on the alert--he will in fact know it well enough: there are\r\nonly too many persons, I assure you, in Athens itself, who report to\r\nhim all that happens here: and in that case his apprehensions will\r\nensure his inactivity. But if, on the other hand, he neglects the\r\nwarning, he may be taken off his guard; for there will be nothing to\r\nhinder you from sailing to his country, if he gives you the\r\nopportunity. {19} These are the measures upon which I say you should\r\nall be resolved, and your preparations for them made. But before this,\r\nmen of Athens, you must make ready a force which will fight without\r\nintermission, and do him damage. Do not speak to me of ten thousand or\r\ntwenty thousand mercenaries. I will have none of your paper-armies. [n]\r\nGive me an army which will be the army of Athens, and will obey and\r\nfollow the general whom you elect, be there one general or more, be he\r\none particular individual, or be he who he may. {20} You must also\r\nprovide maintenance for this force. Now what is this force to be? how\r\nlarge is it to be? how is it to be maintained? how will it consent to\r\nact in this manner? I will answer these questions point by point. The\r\nnumber of mercenaries--but you must not repeat the mistake which has so\r\noften injured you, the mistake of, first, thinking any measures\r\ninadequate, and so voting for the largest proposal, and then, when the\r\ntime for action comes, not even executing the smaller one; you must\r\nrather carry out and make provision for the smaller measure, and add to\r\nit, if it proves too small--{21} the total number of soldiers, I say,\r\nmust be two thousand, and of these five hundred must be Athenians,\r\nbeginning from whatever age you think good: they must serve for a\r\ndefinite period--not a long one, but one to be fixed at your\r\ndiscretion--and in relays. The rest must be mercenaries. With these\r\nmust be cavalry, two hundred in number, of whom at least fifty must be\r\nAthenians, as with the infantry; and the conditions of service must be\r\nthe same. {22} You must also find transports for these. And what next?\r\nTen swift ships of war. For as he has a fleet, we need swift-sailing\r\nwarships too, to secure the safe passage of the army. And how is\r\nmaintenance to be provided for these? This also I will state and\r\ndemonstrate, as soon as I have given you my reasons for thinking that a\r\nforce of this size is sufficient, and for insisting that those who\r\nserve in it shall be citizens.\r\n\r\n{23} The size of the force, men of Athens, is determined by the fact\r\nthat we cannot at present provide an army capable of meeting Philip in\r\nthe open field; we must make plundering forays, and our warfare must at\r\nfirst be of a predatory nature. Consequently the force must not be\r\nover-big--we could then neither pay nor feed it--any more than it must\r\nbe wholly insignificant. {24} The presence of citizens in the force\r\nthat sails I require for the following reasons. I am told that Athens\r\nonce maintained a mercenary force in Corinth,[n] under the command of\r\nPolystratus, Iphicrates, Chabrias and others, and that you yourselves\r\njoined in the campaign with them; and I remember hearing that these\r\nmercenaries, when they took the field with you, and you with them, were\r\nvictorious over the Spartans. But even since your mercenary forces have\r\ngone to war alone, it is your friends and allies that they conquer,\r\nwhile your enemies have grown more powerful than they should be. After\r\na casual glance at the war to which Athens has sent them, they sail off\r\nto Artabazus,[n] or anywhere rather than to the war; and the general\r\nfollows them naturally enough, for his power over them is gone when he\r\ncan give them no pay. You ask what I bid you do. {25} I bid you take\r\naway their excuses both from the general and the soldiers, by supplying\r\npay and placing citizen-soldiers at their side as spectators of these\r\nmysteries of generalship;[n] for our present methods are a mere\r\nmockery. Imagine the question to be put to you, men of Athens, whether\r\nyou are at peace or no. 'At peace?' you would say; 'Of course not! We\r\nare at war with Philip.' {26} Now have you not all along been electing\r\nfrom among your own countrymen ten captains and generals,[n] and\r\ncavalry-officers, and two masters-of-the-horse? and what are they\r\ndoing? Except the one single individual whom you happen to send to the\r\nseat of war, they are all marshalling your processions for you with the\r\ncommissioners of festivals. You are no better than men modelling\r\npuppets of clay. Your captains and your cavalry-officers are elected to\r\nbe displayed in the streets, not to be sent to the war. {27} Surely,\r\nmen of Athens, your captains should be elected from among yourselves,\r\nand your master-of-the-horse from among yourselves; your officers\r\nshould be your own countrymen, if the force is to be really the army of\r\nAthens. As it is, the master-of-the-horse who is one of yourselves has\r\nto sail to Lemnos; while the master-of-the-horse with the army that is\r\nfighting to defend the possessions of Athens is Menelaus.[n] I do not\r\nwish to disparage that gentleman; but whoever holds that office ought\r\nto have been elected by you.\r\n\r\n{28} Perhaps, however, while agreeing with all that I have said, you\r\nare mainly anxious to hear my financial proposals, which will tell you\r\nthe amount and the sources of the funds required. I proceed, therefore,\r\nwith these at once. First for the sum. The cost of the bare rations for\r\nthe crews, with such a force, will be 90 talents and a little over--40\r\ntalents for ten swift ships, and 20 minae a month for each ship; and\r\nfor the soldiers as much again, each soldier to receive rations to the\r\nvalue of 10 drachmae a month; and for the cavalry (two hundred in\r\nnumber, each to receive 30 drachmae a month) twelve talents. {29} It\r\nmay be said that the supply of bare rations to the members of the force\r\nis an insufficient initial provision; but this is a mistake. I am quite\r\ncertain that, given so much, the army will provide everything else for\r\nitself from the proceeds of war, without injury to a single Hellene or\r\nally of ours, and that the full pay will be made up by these means. I\r\nam ready to sail as a volunteer and to suffer the worst, if my words\r\nare untrue. The next question then is of ways and means, in so far as\r\nthe funds are to come from yourselves. I will explain this at once.\r\n\r\n[_A schedule of ways and means is read_.]\r\n\r\n{30} This, men of Athens, is what we have been able to devise; and when\r\nyou put our proposals to the vote, you will pass them, if you approve\r\nof them; that so your war with Philip may be a war, not of resolutions\r\nand dispatches, but of actions.\r\n\r\n{31} I believe that the value of your deliberations about the war and\r\nthe armament as a whole would be greatly enhanced, if you were to bear\r\nin mind the situation of the country against which you are fighting,\r\nremembering that most of Philip's plans are successfully carried out\r\nbecause he takes advantage of winds and seasons; for he waits for the\r\nEtesian winds[n] or the winter-season, and only attacks when it would\r\nbe impossible for us to effect a passage to the scene of action. {32}\r\nBearing this in mind, we must not carry on the war by means of isolated\r\nexpeditions; we shall always be too late. We must have a permanent\r\nforce and armament. As our winter-stations for the army we have Lemnos,\r\nThasos, Sciathos, and the islands in that region, which have harbours\r\nand corn, and are well supplied with all that an army needs. And as to\r\nthe time of year, whenever it is easy to approach the shore and the\r\nwinds are not dangerous, our force can without difficulty lie close to\r\nthe Macedonian coast itself, and block the mouths of the ports.\r\n\r\n{33} How and when he will employ the force is a matter to be\r\ndetermined, when the time comes, by the commander whom you put in\r\ncontrol of it. What must be provided from Athens is described in the\r\nscheme which I have drafted. If, men of Athens, you first supply the\r\nsum I have mentioned, and then, after making ready the rest of the\r\narmament--soldiers, ships, cavalry--bind the whole force in its\r\nentirety,[n] by law, to remain at the seat of war; if you become your\r\nown paymasters, your own commissioners of supply, but require your\r\ngeneral to account for the actual operations; {34} then there will be\r\nan end of these perpetual discussions of one and the same theme, which\r\nend in nothing but discussion: and in addition to this, men of Athens,\r\nyou will, in the first place, deprive him of his chief source of\r\nsupply. For what is this? Why, he carries on the war at the cost of\r\nyour own allies, harrying and plundering those who sail the seas! And\r\nwhat will you gain besides this? You will place yourselves out of reach\r\nof disaster. It will not be as it was in the past, when he descended\r\nupon Lemnos and Imbros, and went off, with your fellow-citizens as his\r\nprisoners of war, or when he seized the vessels off Geraestus,[n] and\r\nlevied an enormous sum from them; or when (last of all) he landed at\r\nMarathon, seized the sacred trireme,[n] and carried it off from the\r\ncountry; while all the time you can neither prevent these aggressions,\r\nnor yet send an expedition which will arrive when you intend it to\r\narrive. {35} But for what reason do you think, men of Athens, do the\r\nfestival of the Panathenaea and the festival of the Dionysia[n] always\r\ntake place at the proper time, whether those to whom the charge of\r\neither festival is allotted are specially qualified persons or\r\nnot--festivals upon which you spend larger sums of money than upon any\r\narmament whatsoever, and which involve an amount of trouble[n] and\r\npreparation, which are unique, so far as I know, in the whole world--;\r\nand yet your armaments are always behind the time--at Methone, at\r\nPagasae, at Potidaea? {36} It is because for the festivals all is\r\narranged by law. Each of you knows long beforehand who is to supply the\r\nchorus,[n] and who is to be steward of the games,[n] for his tribe: he\r\nknows what he is to receive, and when, and from whom, and what he is to\r\ndo with it. No detail is here neglected, nothing is left indefinite.\r\nBut in all that concerns war and our preparation for it, there is no\r\norganization, no revision, no definiteness. Consequently it is not\r\nuntil the news comes that we appoint our trierarchs and institute\r\nexchanges of property for them, and inquire into ways and means. When\r\nthat is done, we first resolve that the resident aliens and the\r\nindependent freedmen[n] shall go on board; then we change our minds and\r\nsay that citizens shall embark; then that we will send substitutes; and\r\nwhile all these delays are occurring, the object of the expedition is\r\nalready lost. {37} For we spend on preparation the time when we should\r\nbe acting, and the opportunities which events afford will not wait for\r\nour slothful evasions; while as for the forces on which we think we can\r\nrely in the meantime, when the critical moment comes, they are tried\r\nand found wanting. And Philip's insolence has reached such a pitch,\r\nthat he has sent such a letter as the following to the Euboeans.\r\n\r\n[_The letter is read_.]\r\n\r\n{38} The greater part of the statements that have been read are true,\r\nmen of Athens; and they ought not to be true! but I admit that they may\r\npossibly be unpleasant to hear; and if the course of future events\r\nwould pass over all that a speaker passes over in his speech, to avoid\r\ngiving pain, we should be right in speaking with a view to your\r\npleasure. But if attractive words, spoken out of season, bring their\r\npunishment in actual reality, then it is disgraceful to blind our eyes\r\nto the truth, to put off everything that is unpleasant, {39} to refuse\r\nto understand even so much as this, that those who conduct war rightly\r\nmust not follow in the wake of events, but must be beforehand with\r\nthem: for just as a general may be expected to lead his army, so those\r\nwho debate must lead the course of affairs, in order that what they\r\nresolve upon may be done, and that they may not be forced to follow at\r\nthe heels of events. {40} You, men of Athens, have the greatest power\r\nin the world-warships, infantry, cavalry, revenue. But none of these\r\nelements of power have you used as you ought, down to this very day.\r\nThe method of your warfare with Philip is just that of barbarians in a\r\nboxing-match. Hit one of them, and he hugs the place; hit him on the\r\nother side, and there go his hands; but as for guarding, or looking his\r\nopponent in the face, he neither can nor will do it. {41} It is the\r\nsame with you. If you hear that Philip is in the Chersonese, you\r\nresolve to make an expedition there; if he is at Thermopylae, you send\r\none there; and wherever else he may be, you run up and down in his\r\nsteps. It is he that leads your forces. You have never of yourselves\r\ncome to any salutary decision in regard to the war. No single event do\r\nyou ever discern before it occurs--before you have heard that something\r\nhas happened or is happening. Perhaps there was room for this\r\nbackwardness until now; but now we are at the very crisis, and such an\r\nattitude is possible no longer. {42} Surely, men of Athens, it is one\r\nof the gods--one who blushes for Athens, as he sees the course which\r\nevents are taking--that has inspired Philip with this restless\r\nactivity. If he were content to remain at peace, in possession of all\r\nthat he has won by conquest or by forestalling us--if he had no further\r\nplans--even then, the record against us as a people, a record of shame\r\nand cowardice and all that is most dishonourable, would, I think, seem\r\ncomplete enough to some of you. But now he is always making some new\r\nattempt, always grasping after something more; and unless your spirit\r\nhas utterly departed, his conduct will perhaps bring you out into the\r\nfield. {43} It amazes me, men of Athens, that not one of you remembers\r\nwith any indignation, that this war had its origin in our intention to\r\npunish Philip; and that now, at the end of it, the question is, how we\r\nare to escape disaster at his hands. But that he will not stay his\r\nprogress until some one arrests it is plain enough. Are we then to wait\r\nfor that? Do you think that all is right, when you dispatch nothing but\r\nempty ships and somebody's hopes? Shall we not embark? {44} Shall we\r\nnot now, if never before, go forth ourselves, and provide at least some\r\nsmall proportion of Athenian soldiers? Shall we not sail to the enemy's\r\ncountry? But I heard the question, 'At what point on his coast are we\r\nto anchor?' The war itself, men of Athens, if you take it in hand, will\r\ndiscover his weak points: but if we sit at home listening to the mutual\r\nabuse and recriminations of our orators, you can never realize any of\r\nthe results that you ought to realize. {45} I believe that whenever any\r\nportion of Athens is sent with the forces, even if the whole city does\r\nnot go, the favour of Heaven and of Fortune fights on our side. But\r\nwhenever you dispatch anywhere a general with an empty resolution and\r\nsome platform-hopes to support him, then you achieve nothing that you\r\nought to achieve, your enemies laugh at you, and your allies are in\r\ndeadly fear of all such armaments. {46} It is impossible, utterly\r\nimpossible, that any one man should be able to effect all that you wish\r\nfor you. He can give undertakings and promises;[n] he can accuse this\r\nman and that; and the result is that your fortunes are ruined. For when\r\nthe general is at the head of wretched, unpaid mercenaries, and when\r\nthere are those in Athens who lie to you light-heartedly about all that\r\nhe does, and, on the strength of the tales that you hear, you pass\r\ndecrees at random, what _must_ you expect?\r\n\r\n{47} How then can this state of things be terminated? Only, men of\r\nAthens, when you expressly make the same men soldiers, witnesses of\r\ntheir general's actions, and judges at his examination[n] when they\r\nreturn home; for then the issue of your fortunes will not be a tale\r\nwhich you hear, but a thing which you will be on the spot to see. So\r\nshameful is the pass which matters have now reached, that each of your\r\ngenerals is tried for his life before you two or three times, but does\r\nnot dare to fight in mortal combat with the enemy even once. They\r\nprefer the death of kidnappers and brigands to that of a general. {48}\r\nFor it is a felon's death, to die by sentence of the court: the death\r\nof a general is to fall in battle with the enemy. Some of us go about\r\nsaying that Philip is negotiating with Sparta[n] for the overthrow of\r\nthe Thebans and the breaking up of the free states; others, that he has\r\nsent ambassadors to the king;[n] others, that he is fortifying cities\r\nin Illyria. {49} We all go about inventing each his own tale. I quite\r\nbelieve, men of Athens, that he is intoxicated with the greatness of\r\nhis successes, and entertains many such visions in his mind; for he\r\nsees that there are none to hinder him, and he is elated at his\r\nachievements. But I do not believe that he has chosen to act in such a\r\nway that the most foolish persons in Athens can know what he intends to\r\ndo; for no persons are so foolish as newsmongers. {50} But if we\r\ndismiss all such tales, and attend only to the certainty--that the man\r\nis our enemy, that he is robbing us of our own, that he has insulted us\r\nfor a long time, that all that we ever expected any one to do for us\r\nhas proved to be against us, that the future is in our own hands, that\r\nif we will not fight him now in his own country we shall perhaps be\r\nobliged to do so in ours--if, I say, we are assured of this, then we\r\nshall have made up our minds aright, and shall be quit of idle words.\r\nFor you have not to speculate what the future may be: you have only to\r\nbe assured that the future must be evil, unless you give heed and are\r\nready to do your duty.\r\n\r\n{51} Well, I have never yet chosen to gratify you by saying anything\r\nwhich I have not felt certain would be for your good; and to-day I have\r\nspoken freely and without concealment, just what I believe. I could\r\nwish to be as sure of the good that a speaker will gain by giving you\r\nthe best advice as of that which you will gain by listening to him. I\r\nshould then have been far happier than I am. As it is, I do not know\r\nwhat will happen to me, for what I have said: but I have chosen to\r\nspeak in the sure conviction that if you carry out my proposals, it\r\nwill be for your good; and may the victory rest with that policy which\r\nwill be for the good of all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLYNTHIAC ORATIONS (OR. I-III)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. It has already been noticed that when Philip took\r\nAmphipolis in 357 B.C., the Olynthians made overtures to the Athenians,\r\nwith whom they had been at war for some years, and that, being\r\nrejected, they became allies of Philip, who gave them Anthemus and\r\nPoteidaea. In 352, alarmed at Philip's growing power, they once more\r\napplied to Athens. Peace was made, and negotiations began with regard\r\nto an alliance. In 351 Philip appeared in the territory of Olynthus. He\r\ndid not, however, at once carry the invasion further, but took pains,\r\nduring this year and the next, to foster a Macedonian party in the\r\ntown. In 349 Philip virtually declared war on the Olynthians by\r\ndemanding the surrender of his step-brother Arrhidaeus, who had taken\r\nrefuge with them. The Olynthians again appealed to Athens; an alliance\r\nwas made; Chares was sent with thirty ships and 2,000 mercenaries, but\r\nseems to have mismanaged the war by misfortune or by design. Probably\r\nhe had been badly supplied with funds, and instead of helping Olynthus,\r\nresorted to acts of piracy to satisfy his men. The Macedonian troops\r\nproceeded to take Stageira and other towns of the Olynthian League,\r\nthough Philip still professed to have no hostile intentions against\r\nOlynthus (see Phil. III, § ii). Chares was recalled and put on his\r\ntrial; and, probably in response to a further message from Olynthus,\r\nCharidemus was transferred thither from the Hellespont. With a\r\nconsiderable mercenary force at his disposal, Charidemus overran\r\nPallene and Bottiaea, and did some damage to Philip's territory, but\r\nafterwards gave himself up to dissipation in Olynthus. In the meantime,\r\nsome of the Thessalians had become restless under Philip's supremacy\r\n(see Olynth. I, § 22, II, § ii), and he was obliged to undertake an\r\nexpedition to suppress the revolt, and to put down Peitholaus (who had\r\napparently become tyrant of Pherae once more, though he had been\r\nexpelled in 352). But early in 348 he appeared in person in Chalcidice,\r\nand took one after another of the towns of the League, including\r\nMecyberna the port of Olynthus, and Torone. He thrice defeated the\r\nOlynthians in battle, and at last obtained possession of Olynthus\r\nitself by the treachery of Euthycrates and Lasthenes, the commanders of\r\nthe Olynthian cavalry.\r\n\r\nAthens had probably been occupied during the early part of the year [1]\r\nwith an expedition which she sent (against the advice of Demosthenes)\r\nto help Plutarchus of Eretria to repel attacks which were partly, at\r\nleast, instigated by Philip; and in consequence she had done little for\r\nOlynthus, though on a request of the Olynthians for cavalry, she had\r\nordered some of those which had been sent to Euboea to go to Olynthus,\r\nand these may have been the Athenians whom Philip captured in that\r\ncity. The seventeen ships, 2,000 infantry, and 300 cavalry (all\r\ncitizens), which Athens dispatched under Chares in response to a last\r\nurgent appeal from Olynthus, were delayed by storms and arrived too\r\nlate. Philip entirely destroyed Olynthus and thirty-two other towns,\r\nsold their inhabitants into slavery, brought the whole of Chalcidice\r\nwithin the Macedonian Empire, and celebrated his conquests by a\r\nfestival in honour of the Olympian Zeus at Dium.\r\n\r\nThe First Olynthiac Oration was delivered before Olynthus itself was\r\nattacked or any other towns actually taken (Olynth. I, § 17); and both\r\nthe First and Second before the discontent with Philip in Thessaly had\r\ntaken an active form (I, § 22, II, § 7). Both, that is, belong to the\r\nsummer of 349, and the situation implied is very much the same in both.\r\nThe First was perhaps spoken when the Olynthians first appealed to\r\nAthens in that year, before the mission of Chares; the Second, to\r\ncounteract the effect of something which had caused despondency in\r\nAthens (possibly the conduct of the Athenian generals, or the account\r\ngiven by other orators of Philip's power). In both Demosthenes urges\r\nthe importance of resisting Philip while he is still far away, and of\r\nsending, not mercenaries, but a citizen-army; and while hinting at what\r\nhe regards as the true solution of the financial difficulty, proposes a\r\nspecial war-tax. The solution which he thinks the right one is more\r\nexplicitly described in the Third Olynthiac, spoken (probably\r\n[Footnote: See note on Olynth. III, Section 4]) in the autumn of the\r\nsame year, and certainly at a time when the situation had become much\r\nmore grave. The root of the financial difficulty lay in the existence\r\nof a law which prohibited (evidently under severe penalties, Olynth.\r\nIII, Section 12) any proposal to devote to military purposes that\r\nportion of the revenues which constituted the 'Festival' or 'Theoric\r\nFund', and was for the most part distributed to the citizens to enable\r\nthem to take part in the public festivals, and so join in fulfilling\r\nwhat was no doubt a religious duty as well as a pleasure. This\r\nparticular form of expenditure is stated to have been introduced by the\r\ndemagogue Agyrrhius in 394, when it revived in an extended form a\r\ndistribution of theatre money instituted late in the fifth century by\r\nCleophon; but the special law in question appears to have been of\r\nrecent date (Olynth. III, Section 12), and was almost certainly the\r\nwork of Eubulus and his party. Demosthenes himself proposes an\r\nextraordinary Legislative Commission, to repeal the mischievous laws\r\nand leave the way clear for financial reform. At the same time he\r\nattacks the whole policy of Eubulus, charging him with distributing\r\ndoles without regard to public service, adding to the amenities of\r\nAthens instead of maintaining her honour in war, and enriching her\r\npoliticians while degrading her people. The main object of the speech\r\nwas unsuccessful; and just about this time (though whether before or\r\nafter the speech is disputed) Apollodorus proposed that the people\r\nshould decide whether the surplus revenues should go to the Festival\r\nFund, or be applied to military purposes, and was heavily fined for the\r\nillegality of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe Three Olynthiacs rank high among the Orations of Demosthenes. Some\r\npassages, indeed, show that he had hardly as yet appreciated the genius\r\nof Philip, or the unlikelihood of his making a false move either\r\nthrough over-confidence or because he had come to the end of his\r\nresources. But the noble patriotism of the speaker, the lofty tone of\r\nhis political reflections, the clearness of his diagnosis of the evils\r\nof his time, and the fearlessness of his appeal for loyal and united\r\nself-sacrifice, are nowhere more conspicuous.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OLYNTHIAC\r\n\r\n{1} I believe, men of Athens, that you would give a great sum to know\r\nwhat policy, in reference to the matter which you are now considering,\r\nwill best serve the interests of the city, and since that is so, you\r\nought to be ready and eager to listen to those who desire to give you\r\ntheir advice. For not only can you hear and accept any useful proposals\r\nwhich a speaker may have thought out before he came here; but such, I\r\nconceive, is your fortune, that the right suggestion will often occur\r\nto some of those present on the spur of the moment; and out of all\r\nthese suggestions it should be easy for you to choose the most\r\nadvantageous course.\r\n\r\n{2} The present time, men of Athens, seems almost to cry aloud that you\r\nmust take matters into your own hands yonder, if you have any interest\r\nin a successful termination of the crisis: and yet our attitude appears\r\nto be--I do not know what. My own opinion, at all events, is that you\r\nshould at once resolve to send this assistance; that you should prepare\r\nfor the departure of the expedition at the first possible moment--you\r\nmust not fall victims to the same error as before--and that you should\r\ndispatch an embassy to announce our intention, and to be present at the\r\nscene of action. {3} For what we have most to fear is this--that he,\r\nwith his unscrupulous cleverness in taking advantage of\r\ncircumstances--now, it may be, by making concessions; now by uttering\r\nthreats, which he may well seem likely to fulfil; now by\r\nmisrepresenting ourselves and our absence from the scene--may turn and\r\nwrest to his own advantage some of the vital elements of our power. {4}\r\nAnd yet it may fairly be said, men of Athens, that our best hope lies\r\nin that very circumstance which renders Philip's power so hard to\r\ngrapple with. The fact that the entire control over everything, open or\r\nsecret,[n] is concentrated in the hands of a single man; that he is at\r\none and the same time general, master, and treasurer; that he is always\r\npresent in person with his army--all this is a great advantage, in so\r\nfar as military operations must be prompt and well-timed. But as\r\nregards the compact which he would so gladly make with the Olynthians,\r\nthe effect is just the reverse. {5} For the Olynthians know well that\r\nthey are not fighting now for honour and glory, nor for a strip of\r\nterritory, but to avert the devastation and enslavement of their\r\ncountry. They know how he treated[n] those who betrayed to him their\r\ncity at Amphipolis, and those who received him at Pydna; and it is, I\r\nimagine, universally true that tyranny is a faithless friend to a free\r\nstate, and that most of all, when they occupy adjoining territories.\r\n{6} With this knowledge, men of Athens, and with all the reflections\r\nthat the occasion calls for in your minds, I say that now, if ever\r\nbefore, you must make your resolve, rouse all your energies, and give\r\nyour minds to the war: you must contribute gladly, you must go forth in\r\nperson, you must leave nothing undone. There is no longer any reason or\r\nexcuse remaining, which can justify you in refusing to do your duty.\r\n{7} For every one was but recently harping on the desirability of\r\nexciting Olynthus to war with Philip; and this has now come to pass of\r\nitself, and in the way which most completely suits your interests. Had\r\nthey taken up the war because you had persuaded them to do so, their\r\nalliance might perhaps have been precarious, and their resolution might\r\nonly have carried them a certain way. But now their detestation of\r\nPhilip is based upon grievances which affect themselves; and we may\r\nsuppose that a hostility which is occasioned by their own fears and\r\nsufferings will be a lasting one. {8} Since, therefore, men of Athens,\r\nsuch an opportunity has been thrown in your way, you must not let it\r\ngo, nor fall victims to the mistake from which you have often suffered\r\nbefore. If, for instance, when we had returned from our expedition in\r\naid of the Euboeans,[n] and Hierax and Stratocles came from Amphipolis\r\nand stood upon this platform and urged us to sail and take over the\r\ncity; if, I say, we had continued to display in our own interest the\r\neagerness which we displayed in the deliverance of the Euboeans, you\r\nwould have kept Amphipolis then, and we should have been free from all\r\nthe trouble that we have had since. {9} And again, when news kept\r\ncoming of the investment of Pydna, Poteidaea, Methone, Pagasae, and all\r\nthe other places--I will not stay to enumerate them all--if we had\r\nacted at once, and had gone to the rescue of the first place attacked,\r\nwith the energy which we ought to have shown, we should now have found\r\nPhilip much less proud and difficult to deal with. As it is, we are\r\nalways sacrificing the present, always fancying that the future will\r\nturn out well of itself; and so we have raised Philip to a position of\r\nsuch importance as no king of Macedonia has ever before attained. {10}\r\nAnd now an opportunity has come to Athens, in this crisis at Olynthus,\r\nas great as any of those former ones: and I believe, men of Athens,\r\nthat one who was to draw up a true account of the blessings which have\r\nbeen given us by the gods, would, in spite of much that is not as it\r\nshould be, find great cause for thankfulness to them; and naturally so.\r\nFor our many losses in the war must in fairness be set down to our own\r\nindifference; but that we did not suffer such losses long ago, and that\r\nan alliance has presented itself to us, which, if we will only take\r\nadvantage of it, will act as a counterpoise to them--all this I, for\r\none, should set down as a favour due to their goodness towards us. But\r\nit is, I imagine, in politics, as it is in money-making. {11} If a man\r\nis able to keep all that he gets, he is abundantly grateful to Fortune;\r\nbut if he loses it all before he is aware, he loses with it his memory\r\nof Fortune's kindness. So it is in politics. When men have not made a\r\nright use of their opportunities, they do not remember any good that\r\nheaven may actually have granted them: for it is by the ultimate issue\r\nthat men estimate all that they have enjoyed before. Therefore, men of\r\nAthens, you must pay the very utmost heed to the future, that by the\r\nbetter use you make of it, you may wipe out the dishonour of the past.\r\n{12} But if you sacrifice these men also, men of Athens, and Philip in\r\nconsequence reduces Olynthus to subjection, I ask any of you to tell me\r\nwhat is to prevent him from marching where he pleases. Is there a man\r\namong you, men of Athens, who considers or studies the steps by which\r\nPhilip, weak enough at first, has become so strong? First he took\r\nAmphipolis, next Pydna, then again Poteidaea, and then Methone. Next he\r\nset foot in Thessaly. {13} Then when Pherae, Pagasae, Magnesia[n] were\r\nsecured for his purposes, just as it suited him, he departed to Thrace.\r\nIn Thrace, after expelling one prince and setting up another, he fell\r\nill. When he grew easier again, he showed no inclination to take things\r\neasily, but at once attacked the Olynthians[n]--and I am passing over\r\nhis campaigns against the Illyrians and the Paeonians, against\r\nArybbas,[n] and in every possible direction.\r\n\r\n{14} Why, I may be asked, do I mention these things at the present\r\nmoment? I wish you to understand, men of Athens, and to realize these\r\ntwo points: first, the unprofitableness of perpetually sacrificing your\r\ninterests one by one; and, secondly, the restless activity which is a\r\npart of Philip's very being, and which will not allow him to content\r\nhimself with his achievements and remain at peace. For if it is to be\r\nhis fixed resolve, that he must always be aiming at something greater\r\nthan he has yet attained; and ours, that we will never set ourselves\r\nresolutely to work; ask yourselves what you can expect to be the end of\r\nthe matter. {15} In God's name, is there one of you so innocent as not\r\nto know that the war will be transferred from Olynthus to Attica, if we\r\npay no heed? But if that happens, men of Athens, I fear that we shall\r\nbe like men who light-heartedly borrow at a high rate of interest, and\r\nafter a brief period of affluence, lose even their original estate;\r\nthat like them we shall find that our carelessness has cost us dear;\r\nthat through making pleasure our standard in everything, we shall find\r\nourselves driven to do many of those unpleasant things which we wished\r\nto avoid, and shall find our position even in our own country\r\nimperilled.\r\n\r\n{16} I may be told that it is easy to criticize--any one can do that;\r\nbut that a political adviser is expected to offer some practical\r\nproposal to meet the existing situation. Now I am well aware, men of\r\nAthens, that in the event of any disappointment, it is not upon those\r\nwho are responsible that your anger falls, but upon those who have\r\nspoken last upon the subject in question. Yet I do not think that\r\nconsideration for my own safety should lead me to conceal my conviction\r\nas to the course which your interests demand. {17} I say then that\r\nthere are two things which you must do to save the situation. You must\r\nrescue these towns [n] for the Olynthians, and send troops to\r\naccomplish this: and you must damage Philip's country with your ships\r\nand with a second body of troops. {18} If you neglect either of these\r\nthings, our campaign, I greatly fear, will be in vain. For suppose that\r\nyou inflict damage on his country, and that he allows you to do so,\r\nwhile he reduces Olynthus; he will have no difficulty in repelling you\r\nwhen he returns. Suppose, on the other hand, that you only go to the\r\nhelp of Olynthus; he will see that he has nothing to fear at home, and\r\nso he will sit down before the town and remain at his task, until time\r\nenables him to get the better of the besieged. The expedition,\r\ntherefore, must be large, and it must be in two parts.\r\n\r\nSuch is my view with regard to the expedition. {19} As to the sources\r\nof supply, you have funds, men of Athens--funds larger than any one\r\nelse in the world; but you appropriate these without scruple, just as\r\nyou choose. Now if you will assign these to your troops, you need no\r\nfurther supplies: otherwise, not only do you need further supplies--you\r\nare destitute of supplies altogether. 'Well' (does someone say?), 'do\r\nyou move that this money should form a war-fund?' I assure you that I\r\nmake no such motion. {20} For while I do indeed believe that a force\r\nought to be made ready [and that this money should form a war-fund],\r\nand that the receipt of money should be connected, as part of one and\r\nthe same system, with the performance of duty; you, on the contrary,\r\nthink it right to take the money, after your present fashion, for your\r\nfestivals, and spare yourselves trouble. And therefore, I suppose, our\r\nonly resource is a general tax--larger or smaller, according to the\r\namount required. In any case, we need funds, and without funds nothing\r\ncan be done that we ought to do. Various other sources of supply are\r\nsuggested by different persons. Choose whichever you think best of\r\nthese, and get to work, while you have the opportunity.\r\n\r\n{21} It is worth while to remember and to take into account the nature\r\nof Philip's position at this moment. For neither are his affairs at\r\npresent in such good order, or in so perfectly satisfactory a state, as\r\nmight appear to any but a careful observer; nor would he ever have\r\ncommenced this present war, if he had thought that he would really have\r\nto fight. He hoped at first that by his mere advance he would carry all\r\nbefore him; and he has since discovered his mistake. This\r\ndisappointment, then, is the first thing which disturbs him and causes\r\nhim great despondency: {22} and next there is the disposition of the\r\nThessalians, naturally inconstant as we know it has always been found\r\nby all men; and what it has always been, that, in the highest degree,\r\nPhilip finds it now. For they have formally resolved to demand from him\r\nthe restitution of Pagasae; they have prevented him from fortifying\r\nMagnesia, and I myself heard it stated that they intend even to refuse\r\nhim the enjoyment of their harbour and market dues for the future.\r\nThese, they say, should go to maintain the public administration of\r\nThessaly, instead of being taken by Philip. But if he is deprived of\r\nthese funds, the resources from which he must maintain his mercenaries\r\nwill be reduced to the narrowest limits. {23} Nay, more: we must surely\r\nsuppose that the chieftains of the Paeonians and Illyrians, and in fact\r\nall such personages--would prefer freedom to slavery; for they are not\r\naccustomed to obey orders, and the man, they say, is a bully. Heaven\r\nknows, there is nothing incredible in the statement. Unmerited success\r\nis to foolish minds a fountain-head of perversity, so that it is often\r\nharder for men to keep the good they have, than it was to obtain it.\r\n{24} It is for you then, men of Athens, to regard his difficulty as\r\nyour opportunity, to take up your share of the burden with readiness,\r\nto send embassies to secure all that is required, to join the forces\r\nyourselves, and to stir up every one else to do so. Only consider what\r\nwould happen, if Philip got such an opportunity to strike at us, and\r\nthere was war on our frontier. Can you not imagine how readily he would\r\nmarch against us? Does it arouse no shame in you, that, when you have\r\nthe opportunity, you should not dare to do to him even as much as you\r\nwould have to suffer, were he able to inflict it?\r\n\r\n{25} There is a further point, men of Athens, which must not escape\r\nyou. I mean that you have now to choose whether you are to carry on war\r\nyonder, or whether he is to do so in your own country. If the\r\nresistance of Olynthus is maintained, you will fight there and will\r\ninflict damage on Philip's territory, while you remain secure in the\r\nenjoyment of this land of your own which you now possess. But if Philip\r\ncaptures Olynthus, who is to hinder him from marching to Athens? The\r\nThebans? {26} It seems, I fear, too bitter a thing to say; but they\r\nwill be glad to join him in the invasion. The Phocians? They cannot\r\nprotect their own country, unless you go to their aid, or some other\r\npower. 'But, my good Sir,'[n] you say, 'he will not want to march\r\nhere.' And yet it would be one of the strangest things in the world,\r\nif, when he has the power, he does not carry out the threats, which he\r\nnow blurts out in spite of the folly that they show. {27} But I suppose\r\nthat I need not even point out how vast is the difference between war\r\nhere and war in his country. For had you to camp outside the walls\r\nyourselves, for only thirty days, and to take from the country such\r\nthings as men in camp must have--and I am assuming that there is no\r\nenemy in the country--I believe that the loss your farmers would suffer\r\nwould exceed your whole expenditure on the war up to the present time.\r\nWhat then must we think will be the extent of our loss, if ever war\r\ncomes to our doors? And besides the loss there is his insolence, and\r\nthe shame of our position, which to right-minded men is as serious as\r\nany loss.\r\n\r\n{28} When you take a comprehensive view of these things you must all go\r\nto the rescue and stave the war off yonder; you who are well-to-do, in\r\norder that, with a small expense in defence of the great fortunes which\r\nyou quite rightly enjoy, you may reap the benefit of the remainder\r\nwithout fear; you who are of military age, that you may gain your\r\nexperience of war in Philip's country, and so become formidable\r\nguardians of a fatherland unspoiled; and your orators, that they may\r\nfind it easy to render an account of their public life; for your\r\njudgement upon their conduct will itself depend upon the position in\r\nwhich you find yourselves. And may that be a happy one, on every ground!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND OLYNTHIAC\r\n\r\n{1} Many as are the occasions, men of Athens, on which we may discern\r\nthe manifestation of the goodwill of Heaven towards this city, one of\r\nthe most striking is to be seen in the circumstances of the present\r\ntime. For that men should have been found to carry on war against\r\nPhilip; men whose territory borders on his and who possess some power;\r\nmen, above all, whose sentiments in regard to the war are such that\r\nthey think of the proposed compact with him, not only as untrustworthy,\r\nbut as the very ruin of their country--this seems to be certainly the\r\nwork of a superhuman, a divine, beneficence. {2} And so, men of Athens,\r\nwe must take care that we do not treat ourselves less well than\r\ncircumstances have treated us. For it is a shameful thing--nay, it is\r\nthe very depth of shame--to throw away openly, not only cities and\r\nplaces which were once in our power, but even the allies and the\r\nopportunities which have been provided for us by Fortune.\r\n\r\n{3} Now to describe at length the power of Philip, men of Athens, and\r\nto incite you to the performance of your duty by such a recital, is\r\nnot, I think, a satisfactory proceeding; and for this reason--that\r\nwhile all that can be said on this subject tends to Philip's glory, it\r\nis a story of failure on our part. For the greater the extent to which\r\nhis success surpasses his deserts, the greater is the admiration with\r\nwhich the world regards him; while, for your part, the more you have\r\nfallen short of the right use of your opportunities, the greater is the\r\ndisgrace that you have incurred. {4} I will therefore pass over such\r\nconsiderations. For any honest inquirer must see that the causes of\r\nPhilip's rise to greatness lie in Athens, and not in himself. Of the\r\nservices for which he has to thank those whose policy is determined by\r\nhis interest--services for which you ought to require their\r\npunishment--the present is not, I see, the moment to speak. But apart\r\nfrom these, there are things which may be said, and which it is better\r\nthat you should all have heard--things which (if you will examine them\r\naright) constitute a grave reproach against him; and these I will try\r\nto tell you.\r\n\r\n{5} If I called him perjured and faithless, without giving his actions\r\nin evidence, my words would be treated as idle abuse, and rightly: and\r\nit happens that to review all his actions up to the present time, and\r\nto prove the charge in every case, requires only a short speech. It is\r\nwell, I think, that the story should be told, for it will serve two\r\npurposes; first, to make plain the real badness of the man's character;\r\nand secondly, to let those who are over-alarmed at Philip, as if he\r\nwere invincible, see that he has come to the end of all those forms of\r\ndeceit by which he rose to greatness, and that his career is already\r\ndrawing to its close. {6} For I, too, men of Athens, should be\r\nregarding Philip with intense fear and admiration, if I saw that his\r\nrise was the result of a righteous policy. {7} But when I study and\r\nconsider the facts, I find that originally, when certain persons wished\r\nto drive from your presence the Olynthians who desired to address you\r\nfrom this place, Philip won over our innocent minds by saying that he\r\nwould deliver up Amphipolis to us, and by inventing the famous secret\r\nunderstanding; that he afterwards conciliated the Olynthians by seizing\r\nPoteidaea, which was yours, and injuring their former allies by handing\r\nit over to themselves; and that, last of all, he recently won over the\r\nThessalians, by promising to give up Magnesia to them, and undertaking\r\nto carry on the war with the Phocians on their behalf. There is\r\nabsolutely no one who has ever had dealings with him that he has not\r\ndeluded; and it is by deceiving and winning over, one after another,\r\nthose who in their blindness did not realize what he was, that he has\r\nrisen as he has done. {8} And therefore, just as it was by these\r\ndeceptions that he rose to greatness, in the days when each people\r\nfancied that he intended to do some service to themselves; so it is\r\nthese same deceptions which should drag him down again, now that he\r\nstands convicted of acting for his own ends throughout. Such, then, is\r\nthe crisis, men of Athens, to which Philip's fortunes have now come. If\r\nit is not so, let any one come forward and show me (or rather you) that\r\nwhat I say is untrue; or that those who have been deceived at the\r\noutset trust him as regards the future; or that those who have been\r\nbrought into unmerited bondage would not gladly be free.\r\n\r\n{9} But if any of you, while agreeing with me so far, still fancies\r\nthat Philip will maintain his hold by force, because he has already\r\noccupied fortified posts and harbours and similar positions, he is\r\nmistaken. When power is cemented by goodwill, and the interest of all\r\nwho join in a war is the same, then men are willing to share the\r\nlabour, to endure the misfortunes, and to stand fast. But when a man\r\nhas become strong, as Philip has done, by a grasping and wicked policy,\r\nthe first excuse, the least stumble, throws him from his seat and\r\ndissolves the alliance. {10} It is impossible, men of Athens, utterly\r\nimpossible, to acquire power that will last, by unrighteousness, by\r\nperjury, and by falsehood. Such power holds out for a moment, or for a\r\nbrief hour; it blossoms brightly, perhaps, with fair hopes; but time\r\ndetects the fraud, and the flower falls withered about its stem. In a\r\nhouse or a ship, or any other structure, it is the foundations that\r\nmust be strongest; and no less, I believe, must the principles, which\r\nare the foundation of men's actions, be those of truth and\r\nrighteousness. Such qualities are not to be seen to-day in the past\r\nacts of Philip.\r\n\r\n{11} I say, then, that we should help the Olynthians; and the best and\r\nquickest method which can be proposed is the method which I approve.\r\nFurther, we should send an embassy to the Thessalians--to some, to\r\ninform them of our intention; to others, to spur them on; for even now\r\nthey have resolved to demand the restitution of Pagasae, and to make\r\nrepresentations in regard to Magnesia. {12} Take care, however, men of\r\nAthens, that our envoys may not only have words to speak, but also\r\nactions of yours to point to. Let it be seen that you have gone forth\r\nin a manner that is worthy of Athens, and are already in action. Words\r\nwithout the reality must always appear a vain and empty thing, and\r\nabove all when they come from Athens; for the more we seem to excel in\r\nthe glib use of such language, the more it is distrusted by every one.\r\n{13} The change, then, which is pointed out to them must be great, the\r\nconversion striking. They must see you paying your contributions,\r\nmarching to war, doing everything with a will, if any of them is to\r\nlisten to you. And if you resolve to accomplish all this in very deed,\r\nas it should be accomplished, not only will the feeble and\r\nuntrustworthy nature of Philip's alliances be seen, but the weakness of\r\nhis own empire and power will also be detected.\r\n\r\n{14} The power and empire of Macedonia is, indeed, to speak generally,\r\nan element which tells considerably as an addition to any other power.\r\nYou found it so when it helped you against the Olynthians in the days\r\nof Timotheus;[n] the Olynthians in their turn found its help of some\r\nvalue, in combination with their own strength, against Poteidaea; and\r\nit has recently come to the aid of the Thessalians, in their disordered\r\nand disturbed condition, against the ruling dynasty: and wherever even\r\na small addition is made to a force, it helps in every way. {15} But in\r\nitself the Macedonian Empire is weak and full of manifold evils. Philip\r\nhas in fact rendered his own tenure of it even more precarious than it\r\nnaturally was, by these very wars and campaigns which might be supposed\r\nto prove his power. For you must not imagine, men of Athens, that\r\nPhilip and his subjects delight in the same things. Philip has a\r\npassion for glory--that is his ambition; and he has deliberately chosen\r\nto risk the consequences of a life of action and danger, preferring the\r\nglory of achieving more than any King of Macedonia before him to a life\r\nof security. {16} But his subjects have no share in the honour and\r\nglory. Constantly battered about by all these expeditions, up and down,\r\nthey are vexed with incessant hardships: they are not suffered to\r\npursue their occupations or attend to their own affairs: for the little\r\nthat they produce, as best they can, they can find no market, the\r\ntrading stations of the country being closed on account of the war.\r\n{17} From these facts it is not difficult to discover the attitude of\r\nthe Macedonians in general towards Philip; and as for the mercenaries\r\nand Infantry of the Guard who surround him, though they have the\r\nreputation of being a fine body of well-drilled warriors, I am told by\r\na man who has been in Macedonia, and who is incapable of falsehood,\r\nthat they are no better than any other body of men. {18} Granted that\r\nthere may be experienced campaigners and fighters among them; yet, he\r\ntells me, Philip is so jealous of honour, that he thrusts all such men\r\naway from him, in his anxiety to get the credit of every achievement\r\nfor himself; for in addition to all his other qualities, his jealousy\r\nis insurpassable. On the other hand, any generally temperate or upright\r\nman, who cannot endure the dissolute life there, day by day, nor the\r\ndrunkenness and the lewd revels, is thrust on one side and counts for\r\nnothing. {19} Thus he is left with brigands and flatterers, and men\r\nwho, when in their cups, indulge in dances of a kind which I shrink\r\nfrom naming to you now. And it is evident that this report is true; for\r\nmen whom every one tried to drive out of Athens, as far viler than even\r\nthe very juggler in the street--Callias the public slave and men like\r\nhim, players of farces, composers of indecent songs, written at the\r\nexpense of their companions in the hope of raising a laugh--these are\r\nthe men he likes and keeps about him. {20} You may think that these are\r\ntrivial things, men of Athens: but they are weighty, in the judgement\r\nof every right-minded man, as illustrations of the temper with which\r\nPhilip is cursed. At present, I suppose, these facts are overshadowed\r\nby his continual prosperity. Success has a wonderful power of throwing\r\na veil over shameful things like these. But let him only stumble, and\r\nthen all these features in his character will be displayed in their\r\ntrue light. And I believe, men of Athens, that the revelation is not\r\nfar off, if Heaven be willing and you desirous of it. {21} So long as a\r\nman is in good health, he is unconscious of any weakness; but if any\r\nillness comes upon him, the disturbance affects every weak point, be it\r\na rupture or a sprain or anything else that is unsound in his\r\nconstitution. And as with the body, so it is with a city or a tyrant.\r\nSo long as they are at war abroad, the mischief is hidden from the\r\nworld at large, but the close grapple of war on the frontier brings all\r\nto light.\r\n\r\n{22} Now if any of you, men of Athens, seeing Philip's good fortune,\r\nthinks that this makes him a formidable enemy to fight against, he\r\nreasons like a sensible man: for fortune weighs heavily in the\r\nscale--nay, fortune is everything, in all human affairs. And yet, if I\r\nwere given the choice, it is the fortune of Athens that I should\r\nchoose, rather than that of Philip, provided that you yourselves are\r\nwilling to act even to a small extent as you should act. For I see that\r\nthere are far more abundant grounds for expecting the goodwill of\r\nHeaven on your side than on his. {23} But here, of course, we are\r\nsitting idle; and one who is a sluggard himself cannot require his\r\nfriends to help him, much less the gods. It is not to be wondered at\r\nthat Philip, who goes on campaigns and works hard himself, and is\r\nalways at the scene of action, and lets no opportunity go, no season\r\npass, should get the better of us who delay and pass resolutions and\r\nask for news; nor do I wonder at it. It is the opposite that would have\r\nbeen wonderful--if we, who do nothing that those who are at war ought\r\nto do, were successful against one who leaves nothing undone. {24} But\r\nthis I do wonder at, that you who once raised your hand against Sparta,\r\nin defence of the rights of the Hellenes--you, who with opportunities\r\noften open to you for grasping large advantages for yourselves, would\r\nnot take them, but to secure for others their rights spent your own\r\nfortunes in war-contributions, and always bore the brunt of the dangers\r\nof the campaign--that you, I say, are now shrinking from marching, and\r\nhesitating to make any contribution to save your own possessions; and\r\nthat, though you have often saved the rest of the Hellenes, now all\r\ntogether and now each in their turn, you are sitting idle, when you\r\nhave lost what was your own. {25} I wonder at this; and I wonder also,\r\nmen of Athens, that none of you is able to reckon up the time during\r\nwhich you have been fighting with Philip, and to consider what you have\r\nbeen doing while all this time has been going by. Surely you must know\r\nthat it is while we have been delaying, hoping that some one else would\r\nact, accusing one another, bringing one another to trial, hoping\r\nanew--in fact, doing practically what we are doing now--that all the\r\ntime has passed. {26} And have you now so little sense, men of Athens,\r\nas to hope that the very same policy, which has made the position of\r\nthe city a bad one instead of a good, will actually make it a good one\r\ninstead of a bad? Why, it is contrary both to reason and to nature to\r\nthink so! It is always much easier to retain than to acquire. But now,\r\nowing to the war, none of our old possessions is left for us to retain;\r\nand so we must needs acquire. {27} This, therefore, is our own personal\r\nand immediate duty; and accordingly I say that you must contribute\r\nfunds, you must go on service in person with a good will, you must\r\naccuse no one before you have become masters of the situation; and then\r\nyou must honour those who deserve praise, and punish the guilty, with a\r\njudgement based upon the actual facts. You must get rid of all excuses\r\nand all deficiencies on your own part; you cannot examine mercilessly\r\nthe actions of others, unless you yourselves have done all that your\r\nduty requires. {28} For why is it, do you think, men of Athens, that\r\nall the generals whom you dispatch avoid this war,[n] and discover\r\nprivate wars of their own--if a little of the truth must be told even\r\nabout the generals? It is because in this war the prizes for which the\r\nwar is waged are yours, and if they are captured, you will take them\r\nimmediately for your own; but the dangers are the personal privilege of\r\nyour commanders, and no pay is forthcoming: while in those wars the\r\ndangers are less, and the profits--Lampsacus, Sigeum, and the ships\r\nwhich they plunder--go to the commanders and their men. Each force\r\ntherefore takes the road that leads to its own advantage. {29} For your\r\npart, when you turn your attention to the serious condition of your\r\naffairs, you first bring the commanders to trial; and then, when you\r\nhave given them a hearing, and have been told of the difficulties which\r\nI have described, you acquit them. The result, therefore, is that while\r\nyou are quarrelling with one another and broken into factions-one party\r\npersuaded of this, another of that--the public interest suffers. You\r\nused, men of Athens, to pay taxes by Boards:[n] to-day you conduct your\r\npolitics by Boards. On either side there is an orator as leader, and a\r\ngeneral under him; and for the Three Hundred, there are those who come\r\nto shout. The rest of you distribute yourselves between the two\r\nparties, some on either side. {30} This system you must give up: you\r\nmust even now become your own masters; you must give to all alike their\r\nshare in discussion, in speech and in action. If you assign to one body\r\nof men the function of issuing orders to you, like tyrants; to another,\r\nthat of compulsory service as trierarchs or tax-payers or soldiers; and\r\nto another, only that of voting their condemnation, without taking any\r\nshare in the labour, nothing that ought to be done will be done in\r\ntime. For the injured section will always be in default, and you will\r\nonly have the privilege of punishing them instead of the enemy. {31} To\r\nsum up, all must contribute, each according to his wealth, in a fair\r\nproportion: all must go on active service in turn, until you have all\r\nserved: you must give a hearing to all who come forward, and choose the\r\nbest course out of all that you hear--not the course proposed by this\r\nor that particular person. If you do this, you will not only commend\r\nthe proposer of that course at the time, but you will commend\r\nyourselves hereafter, for the whole position of your affairs will be a\r\nbetter one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD OLYNTHIAC\r\n\r\n{1} Very different reflections suggest themselves to my mind, I men of\r\nAthens, when I turn my eyes to our real situation, and when I think of\r\nthe speeches that I hear. For I observe that the speeches are all\r\nconcerned with the taking of vengeance upon Philip; whereas in reality\r\nmatters have gone so far, that we have to take care that we are not\r\nourselves the first to suffer: so that those who speak of vengeance are\r\nactually, as it seems to me, suggesting to you a false conception of\r\nthe situation which you are discussing. {2} That there was a time when\r\nthe city could both keep her own possessions in safety, and punish\r\nPhilip, I am very well aware. For it was not long ago, but within my\r\nown lifetime, that both these things were so. But I am convinced that\r\nit is now quite enough for us as a first step to make sure of the\r\npreservation of our allies. If this is safely secured, we shall then be\r\nable to consider upon whom vengeance is to fall, and in what way. But\r\nuntil the first step is properly conceived, I consider it idle to say\r\nanything whatever about the last.\r\n\r\n{3} If ever the most anxious deliberation was required, it is required\r\nin the present crisis; and my greatest difficulty is not to know what\r\nis the proper advice to give you in regard to the situation: I am at a\r\nloss rather to know, men of Athens, in what manner I should address you\r\nin giving it. For I am convinced by what I have heard with my own ears\r\nin this place that, for the most part, the objects of our policy have\r\nslipped from our grasp, not because we do not understand what our duty\r\nis, but because we will not do it; and I ask you to suffer me, if I\r\nspeak without reserve, and to consider only whether I speak truly, and\r\nwith this object in view--that the future may be better than the past.\r\nFor you see that it is because certain speakers make your gratification\r\nthe aim of their addresses, that things have gone on getting worse,\r\ntill at last the extremity has been reached.\r\n\r\n{4} I think it necessary, first, to remind you of a few of the events\r\nwhich have taken place. You remember, men of Athens, that two or three\r\nyears ago[n] the news came that Philip was in Thrace, besieging Heraeon\r\nTeichos. That was in the month of November. Amidst all the discussion\r\nand commotion which took place in this Assembly, you passed a\r\nresolution that forty warships should be launched, that men under\r\nforty-five years of age should embark in person, and that we should pay\r\na war-tax of 60 talents. {5} That year came to an end, and there\r\nfollowed July, August, September. In the latter month, after the\r\nMysteries,[n] and with reluctance, you dispatched Charidemus[n] with\r\nten ships, carrying no soldiers, and 5 talents of silver. For so soon\r\nas news had come that Philip was sick or dead--both reports were\r\nbrought--you dismissed the armament, men of Athens, thinking that there\r\nwas no longer any occasion for the expedition. But it was the very\r\noccasion; for had we then gone to the scene of action with the same\r\nenthusiasm which marked our resolution to do so, Philip would not have\r\nbeen preserved to trouble us to-day. {6} What was done then cannot be\r\naltered. But now a critical moment in another campaign has arrived; and\r\nit is in view of this, and to prevent you from falling into the same\r\nerror, that I have recalled these facts. How then shall we use this\r\nopportunity, men of Athens? For unless you will go to the rescue 'with\r\nmight and main to the utmost of your power',[n] mark how in every\r\nrespect you will have served Philip's interest by your conduct of the\r\nwar. {7} At the outset the Olynthians possessed considerable strength,\r\nand such was the position of affairs, that neither did Philip feel safe\r\nagainst them, nor they against Philip. We made peace with them, and\r\nthey with us. It was as it were a stumbling-block in Philip's path, and\r\nan annoyance to him, that a great city which had made a compact with us\r\nshould sit watching for any opportunity he might offer. We thought that\r\nwe ought to excite them to war with him by every means; and now this\r\nmuch-talked-of event has come to pass--by what means, I need not\r\nrelate. {8} What course then is open to us, men of Athens, but to go to\r\ntheir aid resolutely and eagerly? I can see none. Apart from the shame\r\nin which we should be involved, if we let anything be lost through our\r\nnegligence, I can see, men of Athens, that the subsequent prospect\r\nwould be alarming in no small degree, when the attitude of the Thebans\r\ntowards us is what it is, when the funds of the Phocians are\r\nexhausted,[n] and when there is no one to prevent Philip, so soon as he\r\nhas made himself master of all that at present occupies him, from\r\nbringing his energies to bear upon the situation further south. {9} But\r\nif any of you is putting off until then his determination to do his\r\nduty, he must be desirous of seeing the terrors of war close at hand,\r\nwhen he need only hear of them at a distance, and of seeking helpers\r\nfor himself, when now he can give help to others. For that this is what\r\nit must come to, if we sacrifice the present opportunity, we must all,\r\nI think, be fairly well aware.\r\n\r\n{10} 'But,' some one may say, 'we have all made up our minds that we\r\nmust go to their aid, and we will go. Only tell us how we are to do\r\nit.' Now do not be surprised, men of Athens, if I give an answer which\r\nwill be astonishing to most of you. You must appoint a Legislative\r\nCommission.[n] But when the commissioners meet, you must not enact a\r\nsingle law--you have laws enough--you must cancel the laws which, in\r\nview of present circumstances, are injurious to you. {11} I mean the\r\nlaws which deal with the Festival Fund--to put it quite plainly--and\r\nsome of those which deal with military service: for the former\r\ndistribute your funds as festival-money to those who remain at home;\r\nwhile the latter give immunity to malingerers,[n] and thereby also take\r\nthe heart out of those who want to do their duty. When you have\r\ncancelled these laws, and made the path safe for one who would give the\r\nbest advice, then you can look for some one to propose what you all\r\nknow to be expedient. {12} But until you have done this, you must not\r\nexpect to find a man who will be glad to advise you for the best, and\r\nbe ruined by you for his pains; for you will find no one, particularly\r\nwhen the only result will be that some unjust punishment will be\r\ninflicted on the proposer or mover of such measures, and that instead\r\nof helping matters at all, he will only have made it even more\r\ndangerous in future than it is at present to give you the best advice.\r\nAye, and you should require the repeal of these laws, men of Athens,\r\nfrom the very persons who proposed them.[n] {13} It is not fair that\r\nthose who originally proposed them should enjoy the popularity which\r\nwas fraught with such mischief to the whole State, and that the\r\nunpopularity, which would lead to an improvement in the condition of us\r\nall, should be visited to his cost upon one who now advises you for the\r\nbest. Until you have thus prepared the way, men of Athens, you must\r\nentertain no expectation whatever that any one will be influential\r\nenough here to transgress these laws with impunity, or senseless enough\r\nto fling himself to certain ruin.\r\n\r\n{14} At the same time, men of Athens, you must not fail to realize this\r\nfurther point. No resolution is worth anything, without the willingness\r\nto perform at least what you have resolved, and that heartily. For if\r\ndecrees by themselves could either compel you to do what you ought, or\r\ncould realize their several objects unaided, you would not be decreeing\r\nmany things and performing few--nay, none--of the things that you\r\ndecree, nor would Philip have insulted you so long. {15} If decrees\r\ncould have done it, he would have paid the penalty long ago. But it is\r\nnot so. Actions come later than speeches and voting in order of\r\nprocedure, but in effectiveness they are before either and stronger\r\nthan either. It is action that is still needed; all else you already\r\nhave. For you have those among you, men of Athens, who can tell you\r\nwhat your duty is; and no one is quicker than you are to understand the\r\nspeaker's bidding. Aye, and you will be able to carry it out even now,\r\nif you act aright. {16} What time, what opportunity, do you look for,\r\nbetter than the present? When, if not now, will you do your duty? Has\r\nnot the man seized every position from us already? If he becomes master\r\nof this country too, will not our fate be the most shameful in the\r\nworld? And the men whom we promised to be ready to save, if they went\r\nto war--are they not now at war? {17} Is he not our enemy? Are not our\r\npossessions in his hands? Is he not a barbarian? Is he not anything\r\nthat you choose to call him? In God's name, when we have let everything\r\ngo, when we have all but put everything into his hands, shall we then\r\ninquire at large who is responsible for it all? That we shall never\r\nadmit our own responsibility, I am perfectly sure. Just so amid the\r\nperils of war, none of those who have run away accuses himself; he\r\naccuses his general, his neighbour--any one but himself; and yet, I\r\nsuppose, all who have run away have helped to cause the defeat. He who\r\nnow blames the rest might have stood fast; and if every one had done\r\nso, the victory would have been theirs. {18} And so now, if a\r\nparticular speaker's advice is not the best, let another rise and make\r\na proposal, instead of blaming him; and if some other has better advice\r\nto give, carry it out, and good fortune be with you. What? Is the\r\nadvice disagreeable? That is no longer the speaker's fault--unless, of\r\ncourse, he leaves out the prayer that you expect of him. There is no\r\ndifficulty in the prayer, men of Athens; a man need only compress all\r\nhis desires into a short sentence. But to make his choice, when the\r\nquestion for discussion is one of practical policy, is by no means\r\nequally easy. _Then_ a man is bound to choose what is best, instead of\r\nwhat is pleasant, if both are not possible at once. {19} But suppose\r\nthat some one is able, without touching the Festival Fund, to suggest\r\nother sources of supply for military purposes--is not he the better\r\nadviser? Certainly, men of Athens--if such a thing _is_ possible. But I\r\nshould be surprised if it ever has happened or ever should happen to\r\nany one to find, after spending what he has upon wrong objects, that\r\nwhat he has _not_ is wealth enough to enable him to effect right ones.\r\nSuch arguments as these find, I think, their great support in each\r\nman's personal desire, and, for that reason, nothing is easier than to\r\ndeceive oneself; what a man desires, he actually fancies to be true.\r\n{20} But the reality often follows no such principle. Consider the\r\nmatter, therefore, men of Athens, after this fashion; consider in what\r\nway our objects can be realized under the circumstances, and in what\r\nway you will be able to make the expedition and to receive your pay.\r\nSurely it is not like sober or high-minded men to submit\r\nlight-heartedly to the reproach which must follow upon any shortcomings\r\nin the operations of the war through want of funds--to seize your\r\nweapons and march against Corinthians and Megareans,[n] and then to\r\nallow Philip to enslave Hellenic cities, because you cannot find\r\nrations for your troops.\r\n\r\n{21} These words do not spring from a wanton determination to court the\r\nill-will of any party among you. I am neither so foolish nor so\r\nunfortunate as to desire unpopularity when I do not believe that I am\r\ndoing any good. But a loyal citizen ought, in my judgement, to care\r\nmore for the safety of his country's fortunes than for the popularity\r\nof his utterances. Such, I have heard, and perhaps you have heard it\r\nalso, was the principle which the orators of our forefather's time\r\nhabitually followed in public life--those orators who are praised by\r\nall who rise to address you, though they are far from imitating\r\nthem--the great Aristides, and Nicias, and my own namesake, and\r\nPericles. {22} But ever since these speakers have appeared who are\r\nalways asking you, 'what would you like?' 'what may I propose for you?'\r\n'what can I do to please you?' the interests of the city have been\r\nwantonly given away for the sake of the pleasure and gratification of\r\nthe moment; and we see the consequences--the fortunes of the speakers\r\nprosper, while your own are in a shameful plight. {23} And yet\r\nconsider, men of Athens, the main characteristics of the achievements\r\nof your forefathers' time, and those of your own. The description will\r\nbe brief and familiar to you; for you need not have recourse to the\r\nhistory of others, when your own will furnish examples, by following\r\nwhich you may achieve prosperity. {24} Our forefathers, who were not\r\ncourted and caressed by their politicians as you are by these persons\r\nto-day, were leaders of the Hellenes, with their goodwill, for\r\nforty-five years;[n] they brought up into the Acropolis more than\r\n10,000 talents; the king[n] who then ruled Macedonia obeyed them as a\r\nforeigner ought to obey a Hellenic people; serving in person, they set\r\nup many glorious trophies for victories by land and sea; and alone of\r\nall mankind they left behind them, as the crown of their exploits, a\r\nfame that is beyond the reach of envy. {25} Such was the part they\r\nplayed in the Hellenic world: and now contemplate the manner of men\r\nthey were in the city, both in public and in private life. As public\r\nmen, they gave us buildings and objects of such beauty and grandeur, in\r\nthe temples which they built and the offerings which they dedicated in\r\nthem, that no room has been left for any of those that come after to\r\nsurpass them: while in private life they were so modest, {26} so\r\nintensely loyal to the spirit of the constitution, that if any one\r\nactually knows what the house of Aristides, or Miltiades, or any other\r\nof the glorious men of that day, is like, he can see that it is no more\r\nimposing than those of their neighbours. For it was not to win a\r\nfortune that they undertook affairs of State; but each thought it his\r\nduty to add to the common weal. And thus, acting in a spirit of good\r\nfaith towards the Hellenes, of piety towards the gods, and of equality\r\ntowards one another, they naturally attained great prosperity. {27}\r\nSuch was the national life of those times, when those whom I have\r\nmentioned were the foremost men in the State. How do matters stand\r\nto-day, thanks to these worthy persons? Is there any likeness, any\r\nresemblance, to old times? Thanks to them (and though I might say much,\r\nI pass over all but this), when we had the field, as you see,\r\ncompletely open to us--when the Spartans had been ruined,[n] and the\r\nThebans had their hands full,[n] and no other power could seriously\r\ndispute the supremacy with us on the field of battle--when we could\r\nhave retained our own possessions in safety, and have stood as umpires\r\nof the rights of others--we have been deprived of our own territory;\r\n{28} we have spent more than 1,500 talents to no good purpose; the\r\nallies whom we had gained in the war,[n] these persons have lost in\r\ntime of peace; and we have trained Philip to be the powerful enemy to\r\nus that he is. Let any one rise and tell me how Philip has grown so\r\nstrong, if we ourselves are not the source of his strength. {29} 'But,\r\nmy good Sir,' you say, 'if we are badly off in these respects, we are\r\nat any rate better off at home.' And where is the proof of this? Is it\r\nin the whitewashing of the battlements, the mending of the roads, the\r\nfountains, and all such trumperies? Look then at the men whose policy\r\ngives you these things. Some of them who were poor have become rich;\r\nothers, who were unknown to fame, have risen to honour; some of them\r\nhave provided themselves with private houses more imposing than our\r\npublic buildings; and the lower the fortunes of the city have fallen,\r\nthe higher theirs have risen.\r\n\r\n{30} What is the cause of all these things? Why is it that all was well\r\nthen, and all is amiss to-day? It is because then the people itself\r\ndared to act and to serve in the army; and so the people was master of\r\nits politicians; all patronage was in its own hands; any separate\r\nindividual was content to receive from the people his share of honour\r\nor office or other emolument. The reverse is now the case. {31} All\r\npatronage is in the hands of the politicians, while you, the people,\r\nemasculated, stripped of money and allies, have been reduced to the\r\nposition of servile supernumeraries, content if they give you\r\ndistributions of festival-money, or organize a procession at the\r\nBoedromia;[n] and to crown all this bravery, you are expected also to\r\nthank them for giving you what is your own. They pen you up closely in\r\nthe city; they entice you to these delights; they tame you till you\r\ncome to their hand. {32} But a high and generous spirit can never, I\r\nbelieve, be acquired by men whose actions are mean and poor; for such\r\nas a man's practice is, such must his spirit be. And in all solemnity I\r\nshould not be surprised if I suffered greater harm at your hands for\r\ntelling you the things that I have told you, than the men who have\r\nbrought them to pass. Even freedom of speech is not possible on all\r\nsubjects in this place, and I wonder that it has been granted me to-day.\r\n\r\n{33} If, even now, you will rid yourselves of these habits, if you will\r\nresolve to join the forces and to act worthily of yourselves,\r\nconverting the superfluities which you enjoy at home into resources to\r\nsecure our advantage abroad, then it may be, men of Athens, it may be,\r\nthat you will gain some great and final good, and will be rid of these\r\nyour perquisites, which are like the diet that a physician gives a sick\r\nman--diet which neither puts strength into him nor lets him die. For\r\nthese sums which you now share among yourselves are neither large\r\nenough to give you any adequate assistance, nor small enough to let you\r\nrenounce them and go about your business; but these it is that[2]\r\nincrease the indolence of every individual among you. {34} 'Is it,\r\nthen, paid service that you suggest?'[n] some one will ask. I do, men\r\nof Athens; and a system for immediate enforcement which will embrace\r\nall alike; so that each, while receiving his share of the public funds\r\nmay supply whatever service the State requires of him.[3] If we can\r\nremain at peace, then he will do better to stay at home, free from the\r\nnecessity of doing anything discreditable through poverty. But if a\r\nsituation like the present occurs, then supported by these same sums,\r\nhe will serve loyally in person, in defence of his country. If a man is\r\noutside the military age, then let him take, in his place among the\r\nrest, that which he now receives irregularly and without doing any\r\nservice, and let him act as an overseer and manager of business that\r\nmust be done. {35} In short, without adding or subtracting anything,[n]\r\nbeyond a small sum, and only removing the want of system, my plan\r\nreduces the State to order, making your receipt of payment, your\r\nservice in the army or the courts, and your performance of any duty\r\nwhich the age of each of you allows, and the occasion requires, all\r\npart of one and the same system. But it has been no part of my proposal\r\nthat we should assign the due of those who act to those who do nothing;\r\nthat we should be idle ourselves and enjoy our leisure helplessly,\r\nlistening to tales of victories won by somebody's mercenaries;[n] for\r\nthis is what happens now. {36} Not that I blame one who is doing some\r\npart of your duty for you; but I require you to do for yourselves the\r\nthings for which you honour others, and not to abandon the position\r\nwhich your fathers won through many a glorious peril, and bequeathed to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI think I have told you all that, in my belief, your interest demands.\r\nMay you choose the course which will be for the good of the city and of\r\nyou all!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] See notes to Speech on the Peace, § 5.

V)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. After the fall of Olynthus in 348, the Athenians, on\r\nthe proposal of Eubulus, sent embassies to the Greek States in the\r\nPeloponnese and elsewhere, to invite them to join in a coalition\r\nagainst Philip. Aeschines went for this purpose to Megalopolis, and did\r\nhis best to counteract Philip's influence in Arcadia. When the\r\nembassies proved unsuccessful, it became clear that peace must be made\r\non such terms as were possible. Philip himself was anxious for peace,\r\nsince he wished to cross the Pass of Thermopylae without such\r\nopposition from Athens as he had encountered in 352, and to be free\r\nfrom the attacks of hostile ships upon his ports. Even before the fall\r\nof Olynthus, informal communications passed between himself and Athens\r\n(see Speech on Embassy, §§ 12, 94, 315); and in consequence of these,\r\nPhilocrates proposed and the Assembly passed a decree, under which ten\r\nambassadors were appointed to go to Philip and invite him to send\r\nplenipotentiaries to Athens to conclude a peace. Demosthenes (who had\r\nstrongly supported Philocrates) was among the ten, as well as Aeschines\r\nand Philocrates himself. Delighted with Philip's reception of them, and\r\ngreatly attracted by his personality, the ambassadors returned with a\r\nletter from him, promising in general terms to confer great benefits\r\nupon Athens, if he were granted alliance as well as peace: in the\r\nmeantime he undertook not to interfere with the towns allied to Athens\r\nin the Chersonese. Demosthenes proposed (in the Council, of which he\r\nwas a member in the year 347-346) the usual complimentary resolution in\r\nhonour of the ambassadors, and on his motion it was resolved to hold\r\ntwo meetings of the Assembly, on the 18th and 19th of the month\r\nElaphebolion (i.e. probably just after the middle of April 346), when\r\nPhilip's envoys would have arrived, to discuss the terms of peace. The\r\nenvoys--Antipater, Parmenio, and Eurylochus--reached Athens shortly\r\nafter this; and before the first of the two meetings was held, the\r\nSynod of the allies of Athens, now assembled in the city, agreed to\r\npeace on such terms as the Athenian people should decide, but added a\r\nproposal that it should be permitted to any Greek State to become a\r\nparty to the Peace within three months. They said nothing of alliance.\r\nOf the two meetings of the Assembly, in view of the conflicting\r\nstatements of Demosthenes and Aeschines, only a probable account can be\r\ngiven. At the first, Philocrates proposed that alliance as well as\r\npeace should be made by Athens and her allies with Philip and his\r\nallies, on the understanding that both parties should keep what they\r\n_de facto_ possessed--a provision entailing the renunciation by Athens\r\nof Amphipolis and Poteidaea; but that the Phocians and the people of\r\nHalus should be excluded. Aeschines opposed this strongly; and both he\r\nand Demosthenes claim to have supported the resolution of the allies,\r\nwhich would have given the excluded peoples a chance of sharing the\r\nadvantage of the Peace. The feeling of the Assembly was with them,\r\nalthough the Phocians had recently insulted the Athenians by declining\r\nto give up to Proxenus (the Athenian admiral) the towns guarding the\r\napproaches to Thermopylae, which they had themselves offered to place\r\nin the hands of Athens. But Philocrates obtained the postponement of\r\nthe decision till the next day. On the next day, if not before, it\r\nbecame plain that Philip's envoys would not consent to forgo the\r\nexclusion of the Phocians and Halus; but in order that the Assembly\r\nmight be induced to pass the resolution, the clause expressly excluding\r\nthem was dropped, and peace and alliance were made between Athens and\r\nPhilip, each with their allies.[n] Even this was not secured before\r\nAeschines and his friends had deprecated rash attempts to imitate the\r\nexploits of antiquity by continuing the war, and had explained that\r\nPhilip could not openly accept the Phocians as allies, but that when\r\nthe Peace was concluded, he would satisfy all the wishes of the\r\nAthenians in every way; while Eubulus threatened the people with\r\nimmediate war, involving personal service and heavy taxation, unless\r\nthey accepted Philocrates' decree. A few days afterwards the Athenians\r\nand the representatives of the allies took the oath to observe the\r\nPeace: nothing was said about the Phocians and Halus: Cersobleptes'\r\nrepresentative was probably not permitted to swear with the rest. The\r\nsame ten ambassadors as before were instructed to receive Philip's\r\noath, and the oaths of his allies, to arrange for the ransom of\r\nprisoners, and generally to treat with Philip in the interests of\r\nAthens. Demosthenes urged his colleagues (and obtained an instruction\r\nfrom the Council to this effect) to sail at once, in order that Philip,\r\nwho was now in Thrace, might not make conquests at the expense of\r\nAthens before ratifying the Peace; but they delayed at Oreus, went by\r\nland, instead of under the escort of Proxenus by sea, and only reached\r\nPella (the Macedonian capital) twenty-three days after leaving Athens.\r\nPhilip did not arrive for twenty-seven days more. By this time he had\r\ntaken Cersobleptes prisoner, and captured Serrhium, Doriscus, and other\r\nThracian towns, which were held by Athenian troops sent to assist\r\nCersobleptes. Demosthenes was now openly at variance with his\r\ncolleagues. He had no doubt realized the necessity of peace, but\r\nprobably regarded the exclusion of the Phocians as unwarrantable, and\r\nthought that the policy of his colleagues must end in Philip's conquest\r\nof all Greece. At Pella he occupied himself in negotiations for the\r\nransom of prisoners. After taking the oath, Philip kept the ambassadors\r\nwith him until he had made all preparations for his march southward,\r\nand during this time he played with them and with the envoys from the\r\nother Greek States who were present at the same time. His intention of\r\nmarching to Thermopylae was clear; but he seems to have led all alike\r\nto suppose that he would fulfil their particular wishes when he had\r\ncrossed the Pass. The ambassadors accompanied him to Pherae, where the\r\noath was taken by the representatives of Philip's allies; the Phocians,\r\nHalus, and Cersobleptes were excluded from the Peace. (Halus was taken\r\nby Philip's army shortly afterwards.) The ambassadors of Athens then\r\nreturned homewards, bearing a letter from Philip, but did not arrive at\r\nAthens before Philip had reached Thermopylae. On their return\r\nDemosthenes denounced them before the Council, which refused them the\r\ncustomary compliments, and (on Demosthenes' motion) determined to\r\npropose to the people that Proxenus with his squadron should be ordered\r\nto go to the aid of the Phocians and to prevent Philip from crossing\r\nthe Pass. When the Assembly met on the 16th of Scirophorion (shortly\r\nbefore the middle of July), Aeschines rose first, and announced in\r\nglowing terms the intention of Philip to turn round upon Thebes and to\r\nre-establish Thespiae and Plataeae; and hinted at the restoration to\r\nAthens of Euboea and Oropus. Then Philip's letter was read, containing\r\nno promises, but excusing the delay of the ambassadors as due to his\r\nown request. The Assembly was elated at the promises announced by\r\nAeschines; Demosthenes' attempt to contradict the announcement failed;\r\nand on Philocrates' motion, it was resolved to extend the Peace and\r\nalliance with Philip to posterity, and to declare that if the Phocians\r\nrefused to surrender the Temple of Delphi to the Amphictyons, Athens\r\nwould take steps against those responsible for the refusal. Demosthenes\r\nrefused to serve on the Embassy appointed to convey this resolution to\r\nPhilip: Aeschines was appointed, but was too ill to start. The\r\nambassadors set out, but within a few days returned with the news that\r\nthe Phocian army had surrendered to Philip (its leader, Phalaecus, and\r\nhis troops being allowed to depart to the Peloponnese). The surrender\r\nhad perhaps been accelerated by the news of the Athenian resolution.\r\nThe Assembly, in alarm lest Philip should march southwards, now\r\nresolved to take measures of precaution and defence, and to send the\r\nsame ambassadors to Philip, to do what they could. They went, Aeschines\r\namong them, and arrived in the midst of the festivities with which\r\nPhilip was celebrating the success of his plans. The invitation which\r\nPhilip sent to Athens--to send a force to join his own, and to assist\r\nin settling the affairs of Phocis--was (on Demosthenes' advice)\r\ndeclined by the Assembly; and soon afterwards another letter from\r\nPhilip expressed surprise at the unfriendly attitude taken up by the\r\nAthenians towards him. Philip next summoned the Amphictyonic Council\r\n(the legitimate guardians of the Delphian Temple, on whose behalf the\r\nThebans and Thessalians, aided by Philip, were now at war with the\r\nPhocians): and the Council, in the absence of many of its members,\r\nresolved to transfer the votes of the Phocians in the Council-meeting\r\nto Philip, to break up the Phocian towns into villages, disarming their\r\ninhabitants and taking away their horses, to require them to repay the\r\nstolen treasure to the temple by instalments, and to pronounce a curse\r\nupon those actually guilty of sacrilege, which would render them liable\r\nto arrest anywhere. The destructive part of the sentence was rigorously\r\nexecuted by the Thebans. In order to punish the former supporters of\r\nthe Phocians, the right to precedence in consulting the oracle was\r\ntransferred from Athens to Philip, by order of the Council, and the\r\nSpartans were excluded from the temple: Orchomenus and Coroneia were\r\ndestroyed and their inhabitants enslaved; and Thebes became absolute\r\nmistress of all Boeotia. The Pythian games (at Delphi) in September 346\r\nwere celebrated under Philip's presidency; but both Sparta and Athens\r\nrefused to send the customary deputation to them, and Philip\r\naccordingly sent envoys to Athens, along with representatives of the\r\nAmphictyons, to demand recognition for himself as an Amphictyonic\r\npower. Aeschines supported the demand, his argument being apparently to\r\nthe effect that Philip had been forced to act as he had done by the\r\nThebans and Thessalians; but the Assembly was very angry at the results\r\n(as they seemed to be) of Aeschines' diplomacy and the calamities of\r\nthe Phocians; and it was only when Demosthenes, in the Speech on the\r\nPeace, advised compliance, that they were persuaded to give way. To\r\nhave refused would have brought the united forces of the Amphictyonic\r\nStates against Athens: and these she could not have resisted. It was\r\ntherefore prudent to keep the Peace, though Demosthenes evidently\r\nregarded it only as an armistice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} I see, men of Athens, that our present situation is one of great\r\nperplexity and confusion, for not only have many of our interests been\r\nsacrificed, so that it is of no use to make eloquent speeches about\r\nthem; but even as regards what still remains to us, there is no general\r\nagreement in any single point as to what is expedient: some hold one\r\nview, and some another. {2} Perplexing, moreover, and difficult as\r\ndeliberation naturally is, men of Athens, you have made it far more\r\ndifficult. For while all the rest of mankind are in the habit of\r\nresorting to deliberation before the event, you do not do so until\r\nafterwards: and consequently, during the whole time that falls within\r\nmy memory, however high a reputation for eloquence one who upbraids you\r\nfor all your errors may enjoy, the desired results and the objects of\r\nyour deliberation pass out of your grasp. {3} And yet I believe--and it\r\nis because I have convinced myself of this that I have risen--that if\r\nyou resolve to abandon all clamour and contention, as becomes men who\r\nare deliberating on behalf of their country upon so great an issue, I\r\nshall be able to describe and recommend measures to you, by which the\r\nsituation may be improved, and what we have sacrificed, recovered.\r\n\r\n{4} Now although I know perfectly well, men of Athens, that to speak to\r\nyou about one's own earlier speeches, and about oneself, is a practice\r\nwhich is always extremely repaying, I feel the vulgarity and\r\noffensiveness of it so strongly, that I shrink from it even when I see\r\nthat it is necessary. I think, however, that you will form a better\r\njudgement on the subject on which I am about to speak, if I remind you\r\nof some few of the things which I have said on certain previous\r\noccasions. {5} In the first place, men of Athens, when at the time of\r\nthe disturbances in Euboea[n] you were being urged to assist\r\nPlutarchus, and to undertake an inglorious and costly campaign, I came\r\nforward first and unsupported to oppose this action, and was almost\r\ntorn in pieces by those who for the sake of their own petty profits had\r\ninduced you to commit many grave errors: and when only a short time had\r\nelapsed, along with the shame which you incurred and the treatment\r\nwhich you received--treatment such as no people in the world ever\r\nbefore experienced at the hands of those whom they went to\r\nassist--there came the recognition by all of you of the baseness of\r\nthose who had urged you to this course, and of the excellence of my own\r\nadvice. {6} Again, men of Athens, I observed that Neoptolemus[n] the\r\nactor, who was allowed freedom of movement everywhere on the ground of\r\nhis profession, and was doing the city the greatest mischief, was\r\nmanaging and directing your communications with Philip in Philip's own\r\ninterest: and I came forward and informed you; and that, not to gratify\r\nany private dislike or desire to misrepresent him, as subsequent events\r\nhave made plain. {7} And in this case I shall not, as before, throw the\r\nblame on any speakers or defenders of Neoptolemus--indeed, he had no\r\ndefenders; it is yourselves that I blame. For had you been watching\r\nrival tragedies in the theatre, instead of discussing the vital\r\ninterests of a whole State, you could not have listened with more\r\npartiality towards him, or more prejudice against me. {8} And yet, I\r\nbelieve, you have all now realized that though, according to his own\r\nassertion, this visit to the enemy's country was paid in order that he\r\nmight get in the debts owing to him there, and return with funds to\r\nperform his public service[n] here; though he was always repeating the\r\nstatement that it was monstrous to accuse those who were transferring\r\ntheir means from Macedonia to Athens; yet, when the Peace had removed\r\nall danger, he converted his real estate here into money, and took\r\nhimself off with it to Philip. {9} These then are two events which I\r\nhave foretold--events which, because their real character was exactly\r\nand faithfully disclosed by me, are a testimony to the speeches which I\r\nhave delivered. A third, men of Athens, was the following; and when I\r\nhave given you this one instance, I will immediately proceed to the\r\nsubject on which I have come forward to speak. When we returned from\r\nthe Embassy, after receiving from Philip his oath to maintain the\r\nPeace, {10} there were some[n] who promised that Thespiae and\r\nPlataeae[n] would be repeopled, and said that if Philip became master\r\nof the situation, he would save the Phocians, and would break up the\r\ncity of Thebes into villages; that Oropus would be yours, and that\r\nEuboea would be restored to you in place of Amphipolis--with other\r\nhopes and deceptions of the same kind, by which you were seduced into\r\nsacrificing the Phocians in a manner that was contrary to your interest\r\nand perhaps to your honour also. But as for me, you will find that\r\nneither had I any share in this deception, nor yet did I hold my peace.\r\nOn the contrary, I warned you plainly, as, I know you remember, that\r\n_I_ had no knowledge and no expectations of this kind, and that I\r\nregarded such statements as nonsense.\r\n\r\n{11} All these plain instances of superior foresight on my part, men of\r\nAthens, I shall not ascribe to any cleverness, any boasted merits, of\r\nmy own. I will not pretend that my foreknowledge and discernment are\r\ndue to any causes but such as I will name; and they are two. The first,\r\nmen of Athens, is that good fortune, which, I observe, is more powerful\r\nthan all the cleverness and wisdom on earth. {12} The second is the\r\nfact that my judgement and reasoning are disinterested. No one can\r\npoint to any personal gain in connexion with my public acts and words:\r\nand therefore I see what is to our interest undistorted, in the light\r\nin which the actual facts reveal it. But when you throw money into one\r\nscale of the balance, its weight carries everything with it; your\r\njudgement is instantly dragged down with it, and one who has acted so\r\ncan no longer think soundly or healthily about anything.\r\n\r\n{13} Now there is one primary condition which must be observed by any\r\none who would furnish the city with allies or contributions or anything\r\nelse--he must do it without breaking the existing Peace: not because\r\nthe Peace is at all admirable or creditable to you, but because,\r\nwhatever its character, it would have been better, in the actual\r\ncircumstances, that it should never have been made, than that having\r\nbeen made, it should now be broken through our action. For we have\r\nsacrificed many advantages which we possessed when we made it, and\r\nwhich would have rendered the war safer and easier for us then than it\r\nis now. {14} The second condition, men of Athens, is that we shall not\r\ndraw on these self-styled Amphictyons,[n] who are now assembled, until\r\nthey have an irresistible or a plausible reason for making a united war\r\nagainst us. My own belief is that if war broke out again between\r\nourselves and Philip about Amphipolis or any such claim of our own, in\r\nwhich the Thessalians and Argives and Thebans had no interest, none of\r\nthese peoples would go to war against us, least of all--{15} and let no\r\none raise a clamour before he hears what I have to say--least of all\r\nthe Thebans; not because they are in any pleasant mood towards us; not\r\nbecause they would not be glad to gratify Philip; but because they know\r\nperfectly well, however stupid one may think them,[n] that if war\r\nsprings up between themselves and you, _they_ will get all the\r\nhardships of war for their share, while another will sit by, waiting to\r\nsecure all the advantages; and they are not likely to sacrifice\r\nthemselves for such a prospect, unless the origin and the cause of the\r\nwar are such as concern all alike. {16} Nor again should we, in my\r\nopinion, suffer at all, if we went to war with Thebes on account of\r\nOropus[n] or any other purely Athenian interest. For I believe that\r\nwhile those who would assist ourselves or the Thebans would give their\r\naid if their ally's own country were invaded, they would not join\r\neither in an offensive campaign. For this is the manner of\r\nalliances--such, at least, as are worth considering; and the\r\nrelationship is naturally of this kind. {17} The goodwill of each\r\nally--whether it be towards ourselves or towards the Thebans--does not\r\nimply the same interest in our conquest of others as in our existence.\r\nOur continued existence they would all desire for their own sakes; but\r\nnone of them would wish that through conquest either of us should\r\nbecome their own masters. What is it then that I regard with\r\napprehension? What is it that we must guard against? I fear lest a\r\ncommon pretext should be supplied for the coming war, a common charge\r\nagainst us, which will appeal to all alike. {18} For if the Argives[n]\r\nand Messenians and Megalopolitans, and some of the other Peloponnesians\r\nwho are in sympathy with them, adopt a hostile attitude towards us\r\nowing to our negotiations for peace with Sparta, and the belief that to\r\nsome extent we are giving our approval to the policy which the Spartans\r\nhave pursued: if the Thebans already (as we are told) detest us, and\r\nare sure to become even more hostile, because we are harbouring those\r\nwhom they have exiled,[n] and losing no opportunity of displaying our\r\nill-will towards them; {19} and the Thessalians, because we are\r\noffering a refuge to the Phocian fugitives;[n] and Philip, because we\r\nare preventing his admission to Amphictyonic rank; my fear is that,\r\nwhen each power has thus its separate reasons for resentment, they may\r\nunite in the war against us, with the decrees of the Amphictyons for\r\ntheir pretext: and so each may be drawn on farther than their several\r\ninterests would carry them, just as they were in dealing with the\r\nPhocians. {20} For you doubtless realize that it was not through any\r\nunity in their respective ambitions, that the Thebans and Philip and\r\nthe Thessalians all acted together just now. The Thebans, for instance,\r\ncould not prevent Philip from marching through and occupying the\r\npasses, nor even from stepping in at the last moment to reap the credit\r\nof all that they themselves had toiled for.[n] {21} For, as it is,\r\nthough the Thebans have gained something so far as the recovery of\r\ntheir territory is concerned, their honour and reputation have suffered\r\nshamefully, since it now appears as though they would have gained\r\nnothing, unless Philip had crossed the Pass. This was not what they\r\nintended. They only submitted to all this in their anxiety to obtain\r\nOrchomenus and Coroneia, and their inability to do so otherwise. {22}\r\nAnd as to Philip, some persons,[n] as you know, are bold enough to say\r\nthat it was not from any wish to do so that he handed over Orchomenus\r\nand Coroneia to Thebes, but from compulsion; and although I must part\r\ncompany with them there, I am sure that at least he did not want to do\r\nthis _more_ than he desired to occupy the passes, and to get the credit\r\nof appearing to have determined the issue of the war, and to manage the\r\nPythian games by his own authority. These, I am sure, were the objects\r\nwhich he coveted most greedily. {23} The Thessalians, again, did not\r\ndesire to see either the Thebans or Philip growing powerful; for in any\r\nsuch contingency they thought that they themselves were menaced. But\r\nthey did desire to secure two privileges--admission to the Amphictyonic\r\nmeeting, and the recovery of rights at Delphi;[n] and in their\r\neagerness for these privileges, they joined Philip in the actions in\r\nquestion. Thus you will find that each was led on, for the sake of\r\nprivate ends, to take action which they in no way desired to take. But\r\nthis is the very thing against which we have now to be on our guard.\r\n\r\n{24} 'Are we then, for fear of this, to submit to Philip? and do _you_\r\nrequire this of us?' you ask me. Far from it. Our action must be such\r\nas will be in no way unworthy of us, and at the same time will not lead\r\nto war, but will prove to all our good sense and the justice of our\r\nposition: and, in answer to those who are bold enough to think that we\r\nshould refuse to submit to anything whatever,[n] [2] and who cannot\r\nforesee the war that must follow, I wish to urge this consideration. We\r\nare allowing the Thebans to hold Oropus; and if any one asked us to\r\nstate the reason honestly, we should say that it was to avoid war. {25}\r\nAgain, we have just ceded Amphipolis to Philip by the Treaty of\r\nPeace;[n] we permit the Cardians[n] to occupy a position apart from the\r\nother colonists in the Chersonese; we allow the Prince of Caria[n] to\r\nseize the islands of Chios, Cos, and Rhodes, and the Byzantines to\r\ndrive our vessels to shore[n]--obviously because we believe that the\r\ntranquillity afforded by peace brings more blessings than any collision\r\nor contention over these grievances would bring: so that it would be a\r\nfoolish and an utterly perverse policy, when we have behaved in this\r\nmanner towards each of our adversaries individually, where our own most\r\nessential interests were concerned, to go now to war with all of them\r\ntogether, on account of this shadow at Delphi.[n]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The term 'the allies of Athens' was ambiguous. It might be taken\r\n(as it was taken by Philip and his envoys) to include only the\r\nremaining members of the League (see p. 9), who were represented by the\r\nSynod then sitting, and whose policy Athens could control. But it was\r\nevidently possible to put a wider interpretation upon it, as the\r\nAssembly probably did and as Demosthenes often does (e.g. Speech on\r\nEmbassy, § 278), and to understand it as including the Phocians and\r\nothers (such as Cersobleptes) with whom Athens had a treaty of\r\nalliance. Much of the trouble which followed arose out of this\r\nambiguity.\r\n\r\n[2] [Greek: oud hotioun].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PHILIPPIC (OR. VI)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. After settling affairs at Delphi in 346, Philip\r\nreturned to Macedonia. During a considerable part of 345 and in the\r\nearly months of 344 he was occupied with campaigns against the\r\nIllyrians, Dardani, and Triballi. But in the summer (probably) of 344\r\nhe resumed his activities in Greece, garrisoning Pherae and other towns\r\nof Thessaly with Macedonians, appropriating the revenues derived from\r\nthe Thessalian ports, and establishing oligarchical governments\r\nthroughout the country. At the same time negotiations were going on\r\nbetween himself and Athens with regard to the Thracian strongholds\r\nwhich he had captured in 346. He refused to give these up, though he\r\noffered to cut a canal across the Chersonese, for the protection of the\r\nAthenian allies there from the attacks of the Thracians. He also sent\r\nmoney and mercenaries to help the Messenians and Argives, who, like the\r\nMegalopolitans, were anxious to secure their independence of Sparta.\r\nAthens, which was on friendly terms with Sparta, sent envoys to the\r\nPeloponnesian states to counteract Philip's influence, and of these\r\nDemosthenes was one. In return, Argos and Messene complained to Athens\r\nof her interference with their attempt to secure freedom, and Philip\r\nsent envoys to deprecate the charges made against him by the Athenian\r\nambassadors in the Peloponnese. He pointed out that he had not broken\r\nany promises made to Athens at the time of the Peace, for he had made\r\nnone. (In fact, if Demosthenes' account is correct, he had confined\r\nhimself to vague expressions of goodwill; the promises had been made by\r\nAeschines.) The Second Philippic, spoken late in 344, proposes a reply\r\nto Philip, the text of which has unfortunately not come down to us. The\r\nPeloponnesian envoys appear also to have been in Athens at the time;\r\nand Philip's supporters had put forward various explanations of his\r\nconduct at the time when the Peace was made. To these also Demosthenes\r\nreplies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} In all our discussions, men of Athens, with regard to the acts of\r\nviolence by which Philip contravenes the terms of the Peace, I observe\r\nthat, although the speeches on our side are always manifestly just and\r\nsympathetic,[n] and although those who denounce Philip are always\r\nregarded as saying what ought to be said, yet practically nothing is\r\ndone which ought to be done, or which would make it worth while to\r\nlisten to such speeches. {2} On the contrary, the condition of public\r\naffairs as a whole has already been brought to a point at which, the\r\nmore and the more evidently a speaker can convict Philip both of\r\ntransgressing the Peace which he made with you and of plotting against\r\nall the Hellenes, the harder it is for him to advise you how you should\r\nact. {3} The responsibility for this rests with us all, men of Athens.\r\nIt is by deeds and actions, not by words, that a policy of encroachment\r\nmust be arrested: and yet, in the first place, we who rise to address\r\nyou will not face the duty of proposing or advising such action, for\r\nfear of unpopularity with you, though we dilate upon the character of\r\nPhilip's acts, upon their atrocity, and so forth; and, in the second\r\nplace, you who sit and listen, better qualified though you doubtless\r\nare than Philip for using the language of justice and appreciating it\r\nat the mouths of others, are nevertheless absolutely inert, when it is\r\na question of preventing him from executing the designs in which he is\r\nnow engaged. {4} It follows as the inevitable and perhaps reasonable\r\nconsequence, that you are each more successful in that to which your\r\ntime and your interest is given--he in actions, yourselves in words.\r\nNow if it is still enough for you, that your words are more just than\r\nhis, your course is easy, and no labour is involved in it. {5} But if\r\nwe are to inquire how the evil of the present situation is to be\r\ncorrected; if its advance is not still to continue, unperceived, until\r\nwe are confronted by a power so great that we cannot even raise a hand\r\nin our own defence; then we must alter our method of deliberation, and\r\nall of us who speak, and all of you who listen, must resolve to prefer\r\nthe counsels which are best, and which can save us, to those which are\r\nmost easy and most attractive.\r\n\r\n{6} I am amazed, men of Athens, in the first place, that any one who\r\nsees the present greatness of Philip and the wide mastery which he has\r\ngained, can be free from alarm, or can imagine that this involves no\r\nperil to Athens, or that it is not against you that all his\r\npreparations are being made. And I would beg you, one and all, to\r\nlisten while I put before you in a few words the reasoning by which I\r\nhave come to entertain the opposite expectation, and the grounds upon\r\nwhich I regard Philip as an enemy; that so, if my own foresight appears\r\nto you the truer, you may believe me; but if that of the persons who\r\nhave no fears and have placed their trust in him, you may give your\r\nadhesion to them. {7} Here then, men of Athens, is my argument. Of\r\nwhat, in the first place, did Philip become master, when the Peace was\r\nconcluded? Of Thermopylae, and of the situation in Phocis. Next, what\r\nuse did he make of his power? He deliberately chose to act in the\r\ninterests of Thebes, not in those of Athens. And why? He scrutinized\r\nevery consideration in the light of his own ambition and of his desire\r\nfor universal conquest: he took no thought for peace, or tranquillity,\r\nor justice; {8} and he saw quite correctly that our state and our\r\nnational character being what they are, there was no attraction that he\r\ncould offer, nothing that he could do, which would induce you to\r\nsacrifice any of the other Hellenes to him for your own advantage. He\r\nsaw that you would take account of what was right; that you would\r\nshrink from the infamy attaching to such a policy; that you would\r\nexercise all the foresight which the situation demanded, and would\r\noppose any such attempt on his part, as surely as if you were at open\r\nwar with him. {9} But the Thebans, he believed--and the event proved\r\nthat he was right--in return for what they were getting would let him\r\ndo as he pleased in all that did not concern them; and far from acting\r\nagainst him, or preventing him effectively, would even join him in his\r\ncampaign, if he bade them. His services to the Messenians and the\r\nArgives at the present moment are due to his having formed the same\r\nconception of them. And this, men of Athens, is the highest of all\r\ntributes to yourselves: {10} for these actions of his amount to a\r\nverdict upon you, that you alone of all peoples would never, for any\r\ngain to yourselves, sacrifice the common rights of the Hellenes, nor\r\nbarter away your loyalty to them for any favour or benefit at his\r\nhands. This conception of you he has naturally formed, just as he has\r\nformed the opposite conception of the Argives and the Thebans, not only\r\nfrom his observation of the present, but also from his consideration of\r\nthe past. {11} He discovers, I imagine, and is told, how when your\r\nforefathers might have been rulers of the rest of the Hellenes, on\r\ncondition of submitting to the king themselves, they not only refused\r\nto tolerate the suggestion, on the occasion when Alexander [n], the\r\nancestor of the present royal house, came as his herald to negotiate,\r\nbut chose rather to leave their country and to face any suffering which\r\nthey might have to endure; and how they followed up the refusal by\r\nthose deeds which all are so eager to tell, but to which no one has\r\never been able to do justice; and for that reason, I shall myself\r\nforbear to speak of them, and rightly; for the grandeur of their\r\nachievements passes the power of language to describe. He knows, on the\r\nother hand, how the forefathers of the Thebans and Argives, in the one\r\ncase, joined the barbarian army, in the other, offered no resistance to\r\nit. {12} He knows, therefore, that both these peoples will welcome what\r\nis to their own advantage, instead of considering the common interests\r\nof the Hellenes: and so he thought that, if he chose you for his\r\nallies, he would be choosing friends who would only serve a righteous\r\ncause; while if he joined himself to them, he would win accomplices who\r\nwould further his own ambitions. That is why he chose them, as he\r\nchooses them now, in preference to you. For he certainly does not see\r\nthem in possession of more ships than you; nor has he discovered some\r\ninland empire, and withdrawn from the seaboard and the trading-ports;\r\nnor does he forget the words and the promises, on the strength of which\r\nhe was granted the Peace.\r\n\r\n{13} But some one may tell us, with an air of complete knowledge of the\r\nmatter, that what then moved Philip to act thus was not his ambition\r\nnor any of the motives which I impute to him, but his belief that the\r\ndemands of Thebes were more righteous than your own. I reply, that this\r\nstatement, above all others, is one which he cannot possibly make\r\n_now_. How can one who is ordering Sparta to give up Messene put\r\nforward his belief in the righteousness of the act, as his excuse for\r\nhanding over Orchomenus and Coroneia to Thebes?\r\n\r\n{14} 'But,' we are told (as the last remaining plea), 'he was forced to\r\nmake these concessions, and did so against his better judgement,\r\nfinding himself caught between the cavalry of Thessaly and the infantry\r\nof Thebes.' Admirable! And so, we are informed, he intends henceforth\r\nto be wary of the Thebans, and the tale goes round that he intends to\r\nfortify Elateia [n]. 'Intends,' indeed! and I expect that it will\r\nremain an intention! {15} But the help which he is giving to the\r\nMessenians and Argives is no 'intention'; for he is actually sending\r\nmercenaries to them and dispatching funds, and is himself expected to\r\narrive on the spot with a great force. Is he trying to annihilate the\r\nSpartans, the existing enemies of Thebes, and at the same time\r\nprotecting the Phocians, whom he himself has ruined? Who will believe\r\nsuch a tale? {16} For if Philip had really acted against his will and\r\nunder compulsion in the first instance--if he were now really intending\r\nto renounce the Thebans--I cannot believe that he would be so\r\nconsistently opposing their enemies. On the contrary, his present\r\ncourse plainly proves that his former action also was the result of\r\ndeliberate policy; and to any sound observation, it is plain that the\r\nwhole of his plans are being organized for one end--the destruction of\r\nAthens. {17} Indeed, this has now come to be, in a sense, a matter of\r\nnecessity for him. Only consider. It is empire that he desires, and\r\nyou, as he believes, are his only possible rivals in this. He has been\r\nacting wrongfully towards you for a long time, as he himself best\r\nknows; for it is the occupation of your possessions that enables him to\r\nhold all his other conquests securely, convinced, as he is, that if he\r\nhad let Amphipolis and Poteidaea go, he could not dwell in safety even\r\nat home. {18} These two facts, then, he well knows--first, that his\r\ndesigns are aimed at you, and secondly, that you are aware of it: and\r\nas he conceives you to be men of sense, he considers that you hold him\r\nin righteous detestation: and, in consequence, his energies are roused:\r\nfor he expects to suffer disaster, if you get your opportunity, unless\r\nhe can anticipate you by inflicting it upon you. {19} So he is wide\r\nawake; he is on the alert; he is courting the help of others against\r\nAthens--of the Thebans and those Peloponnesians who sympathize with\r\ntheir wishes; thinking that their desire of gain will make them embrace\r\nthe immediate prospect, while their native stupidity will prevent them\r\nfrom foreseeing any of the consequences. Yet there are examples,\r\nplainly visible to minds which are even moderately\r\nwell-balanced[n]--examples which it fell to my lot to bring before\r\nMessenian and Argive audiences, but which had better, perhaps, be laid\r\nbefore yourselves as well.\r\n\r\n{20} 'Can you not imagine,' I said, 'men of Messenia, the impatience\r\nwith which the Olynthians used to listen to any speeches directed\r\nagainst Philip in those times, when he was giving up Anthemus to\r\nthem--a city claimed as their own by all former Macedonian kings; when\r\nhe was expelling the Athenian colonists from Poteidaea and presenting\r\nit to the Olynthians; when he had taken upon his own shoulders their\r\nquarrel with Athens, and given them the enjoyment of that territory?\r\nDid they expect, do you think, to suffer as they have done? if any one\r\nhad foretold it, would they have believed him? {21} And yet,' I\r\ncontinued, 'after enjoying territory not their own for a very short\r\ntime, they are robbed of their own by him for a great while to come;\r\nthey are foully driven forth--not conquered merely, but betrayed by one\r\nanother and sold; for it is not safe for a free state to be on these\r\nover-friendly terms with a tyrant. {22} What, again, of the\r\nThessalians? Do you imagine,' I asked, 'that when he was expelling\r\ntheir tyrants, or again, when he was giving them Nicaea and Magnesia,\r\nthey expected to see the present Council of Ten[n] established in their\r\nmidst? Did they expect that the restorer of their Amphictyonic rights\r\nwould take their own revenues from them for himself? Impossible! And\r\nyet these things came to pass, as all men may know. {23} You\r\nyourselves,' I continued, 'at present behold only the gifts and the\r\npromises of Philip. Pray, if you are really in your right minds, that\r\nyou may never see the accomplishment of his deceit and treachery. There\r\nare, as you know well,' I said, 'all kinds of inventions designed for\r\nthe protection and security of cities--palisades, walls, trenches, and\r\nevery kind of defence. {24} All these are made with hands, and involve\r\nexpense as well. But there is one safeguard which all sensible men\r\npossess by nature--a safeguard which is a valuable protection to all,\r\nbut above all to a democracy against a tyrant. And what is this? It is\r\ndistrust. Guard this possession and cleave to it; preserve this, and\r\nyou need never fear disaster. {25} What is it that you desire?' I said.\r\n'Is it freedom? And do you not see that the very titles that Philip\r\nbears are utterly alien to freedom? For a king, a tyrant, is always the\r\nfoe of freedom and the enemy of law. Will you not be on your guard,' I\r\nsaid, 'lest in striving to be rid of war, you find yourselves\r\nslaves?'[n]\r\n\r\n{26} My audience heard these words and received them with a tumult of\r\napprobation, as well as many other speeches from the envoys, both when\r\nI was present and again later. And yet, it seems, there is still no\r\nbetter prospect of their keeping Philip's friendship and promises at a\r\ndistance. {27} In fact, the extraordinary thing is not that Messenians\r\nand certain Peloponnesians should act against their own better\r\njudgement, but that you who understand for yourselves, and who hear us,\r\nyour orators, telling you, that there is a design against you, and that\r\nthe toils are closing round you--that you, I say, by always refusing to\r\nact at once, should be about to find (as I think you will) that you\r\nhave exposed yourselves unawares to the utmost peril: so much more does\r\nthe pleasure and ease of the moment weigh with you, than any advantage\r\nto be reaped at some future date.\r\n\r\n{28} In regard to the practical measures which you must take, you will,\r\nif you are wise, deliberate by yourselves[n] later. But I will at once\r\npropose an answer which you may make to-day, and which it will be\r\nconsistent with your duty to have adopted.\r\n\r\n[_The answer is read._]\r\n\r\nNow the right course, men of Athens, was to have summoned before you\r\nthose who conveyed the promises[n] on the strength of which you were\r\ninduced to make the Peace. {29} For I could never have brought myself\r\nto serve on the Embassy, nor, I am sure, would you have discontinued\r\nthe war, had you imagined that Philip, when he had obtained peace,\r\nwould act as he has acted. What we were then told was something very\r\ndifferent from this. And there are others, too, whom you should summon.\r\nYou ask whom I mean? After the Peace had been made, and I had returned\r\nfrom the Second Embassy, which was sent to administer the oaths, I saw\r\nhow the city was being hoodwinked, and I spoke out repeatedly,\r\nprotesting and forbidding you to sacrifice Thermopylae and the\r\nPhocians: {30} and the men to whom I refer were those who then said\r\nthat a water-drinker[n] like myself was naturally a fractious and\r\nill-tempered fellow; while Philip, if only he crossed the Pass, would\r\nfulfil your fondest prayers; for he would fortify Thespiae and\r\nPlataeae; he would put an end to the insolence of the Thebans; he would\r\ncut a canal through the Chersonese at his own charges, and would repay\r\nyou for Amphipolis by the restoration of Euboea and Oropus. All this\r\nwas said from this very platform, and I am quite sure that you remember\r\nit well, though your memory of those who injure you is but short. {31}\r\nTo crown your disgrace, with nothing but these hopes in view, you\r\nresolved that this same Peace should hold good for your posterity also;\r\nso completely had you fallen under their influence. But why do I speak\r\nof all this now? why do I bid you summon these men? By Heaven, I will\r\ntell the truth without reserve, and will hold nothing back. {32} My\r\nobject is not to give way to abuse, and so secure myself as good a\r\nhearing[n] as others in this place, while giving those who have come\r\ninto collision with me from the first an opportunity for a further\r\nclaim[n] upon Philip's money. Nor do I wish to waste time in empty\r\nwords. {33} No; but I think that the plan which Philip is pursuing will\r\nsome day trouble you more than the present situation does; for his\r\ndesign is moving towards fulfilment, and though I shrink from precise\r\nconjecture, I fear its accomplishment may even now be only too close at\r\nhand. And when the time comes when you can no longer refuse to attend\r\nto what is passing; when you no longer hear from me or from some other\r\nthat it is all directed against you, but all alike see it for\r\nyourselves and know it for a certainty; then, I think, you will be\r\nangry and harsh enough. {34} And I am afraid that because your envoys\r\nhave withheld from you the guilty secret of the purposes which they\r\nhave been bribed to forward, those who are trying to remedy in some\r\ndegree the ruin of which these men have been the instruments will fall\r\nvictims to your wrath. For I observe that it is the general practice of\r\nsome persons to vent their anger, not upon the guilty, but upon those\r\nwho are most within their grasp. {35} While then the trouble is still\r\nto come, still in process of growth, while we can still listen to one\r\nanother's words, I would remind each of you once more of what he well\r\nknows--who it was that induced you to sacrifice the Phocians and\r\nThermopylae, the control of which gave Philip command of the road to\r\nAttica and the Peloponnesus; who it was, I say, that converted your\r\ndebate about your rights and your interests abroad into a debate about\r\nthe safety of your own country, and about war on your own borders--a\r\nwar which will bring distress to each of us personally, when it is at\r\nour doors, but which sprang into existence on that day. {36} Had you\r\nnot been misled by them, no trouble would have befallen this country.\r\nFor we cannot imagine that Philip would have won victories by sea which\r\nwould have enabled him to approach Attica with his fleet, or would have\r\nmarched by land past Thermopylae and the Phocians; but he would either\r\nhave been acting straightforwardly--keeping the Peace and remaining\r\nquiet; or else he would have found himself instantly plunged into a war\r\nno less severe than that which originally made him desirous of the\r\nPeace. {37} What I have said is sufficient by way of a reminder to you.\r\nHeaven grant that the time may not come when the truth of my words will\r\nbe tested with all severity: for I at least have no desire to see any\r\none meet with punishment, however much he may deserve his doom, if it\r\nis accompanied by danger and calamity to us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EMBASSY (OR. XIX)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Introduction_. The principal events with which a reader of this\r\nSpeech ought to be acquainted have already been narrated (see\r\nespecially the Introductions to the last two Speeches). The influence\r\nof the anti-Macedonian party grew gradually from the time of the Peace\r\nonwards. In 346, within a month after the return of the Second Embassy,\r\nthe ambassadors presented their reports before the Logistae or Board of\r\nAuditors (after a futile attempt on the part of Aeschines to avoid\r\nmaking a report altogether); and Timarchus, supported by Demosthenes,\r\nthere announced his intention of taking proceedings against Aeschines\r\nfor misconduct on the Second Embassy. But Timarchus' own past history\r\nwas not above reproach: he was attacked by Aeschines for the\r\nimmoralities of his youth, which, it was stated, disqualified him from\r\nacting as prosecutor, and though defended by Demosthenes, was condemned\r\nand disfranchised (345 B.C.). But early in 343 Hypereides impeached\r\nPhilocrates for corruption as ambassador, and obtained his condemnation\r\nto death--a penalty which he escaped by voluntary exile before the\r\nconclusion of the trial; and, later in the same year, Demosthenes\r\nbrought the same charge against Aeschines.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (since the delivery of Demosthenes' Second Philippic)\r\nPhilip had been making fresh progress. The Arcadians and Argives (for\r\nthe Athenian envoys to the Peloponnese in 344 seem to have had little\r\nsuccess) were ready to open their gates to him. His supporters in Elis\r\nmassacred their opponents, and with them the remnant of the Phocians\r\nwho had crossed over to Elis with Phalaecus. At Megara, Perillus and\r\nPtoeodorus almost succeeded in bringing a force of Philip's mercenaries\r\ninto the town, but the attempt was defeated, by the aid of an Athenian\r\nforce under Phocion. In Euboea Philip's troops occupied Porthmus, where\r\nthe democratic party of Eretria had taken refuge, owing to an overthrow\r\nof the constitution (brought about by Philip's intrigues) which\r\nresulted in the establishment of Cleitarchus as tyrant. In the course\r\nof the same year (343) occurred two significant trials. The first was\r\nthat of Antiphon, who had made an offer to Philip to burn the Athenian\r\ndockyards at the Peiraeus. He was summarily arrested by order of\r\nDemosthenes (probably in virtue of some administrative office):\r\nAeschines obtained his release, but he was re-arrested by order of the\r\nCouncil of Areopagus[1] and condemned to death. The other trial was\r\nheld before the Amphictyonic Council on the motion of the people of\r\nDelos, to decide whether the Athenians should continue to possess the\r\nright of managing the Temple of Delos. The Assembly chose Aeschines as\r\ncounsel for Athens; but the Council of Areopagus, which had been given\r\npower to revise the appointment, put Hypereides in his place.\r\nHypereides won the case. Early in 343 (or at all events before the\r\nmiddle of the year), Philip sent Python of Byzantium to complain of the\r\nlanguage used about him by Athenian orators, and to offer to revise and\r\namend the terms of the Peace of Philocrates. In response, an embassy\r\nwas sent, headed by Hegesippus, a violent opponent of Macedonia, to\r\npropose to Philip (1) that instead of the clause 'that each party shall\r\nretain possession of what they have', a clause, 'that each party shall\r\npossess what is their own,' should be substituted; and (2) that all\r\nGreek States not included in the Treaty of Peace should be declared\r\nfree, and that Athens and Philip should assist them, if they were\r\nattacked. These proposals, if sanctioned, would obviously have reopened\r\nthe question of Amphipolis, Pydna, and Poteidaea, as well as of Cardia\r\nand the Thracian towns taken by Philip in 346. Hegesippus, moreover,\r\nwas personally objectionable, and the embassy was dismissed with little\r\ncourtesy by Philip, who even banished from Macedonia the Athenian poet\r\nXenocleides for acting as host to the envoys. The feeling against\r\nPhilip in Athens was evidently strong, when the prosecution of\r\nAeschines by Demosthenes took place.\r\n\r\nThe trial was held before a jury (probably consisting of 1,501\r\npersons), presided over by the Board of Auditors. Demosthenes spoke\r\nfirst, and Aeschines replied in a speech which is preserved. There is\r\nno doubt, on a comparison of the two speeches, that each, before it was\r\npublished, received alterations and insertions, intended to meet the\r\nadversary's points, or to give a better colour to passages which had\r\nbeen unfavourably received. Probably not all the refutations 'in\r\nadvance' were such in reality. But there is no sufficient reason to\r\ndoubt that the speeches were delivered substantially as we have them.\r\nAeschines was acquitted by thirty votes.\r\n\r\nThe question of the guilt or innocence of Aeschines will probably never\r\nbe finally settled. A great part of his conduct can be explained as a\r\nsincere attempt to carry out the policy of Eubulus, or as the issue of\r\na genuine belief that it was best for Athens to make terms with Philip\r\nand stand on his side. Even so the wisdom and the veracity of certain\r\nspeeches which he had made is open to grave question; but this is a\r\ndifferent thing from corruption. Moreover, to some of Demosthenes'\r\narguments he has a conclusive reply. It is more difficult to explain\r\nhis apparent change of opinion between the 18th and 19th of\r\nElaphebolion, 346 (if Demosthenes' report of the debates is to be\r\ntrusted); and some writers are disposed to date his corruption from the\r\nintervening night. Nor is it easy to meet Demosthenes' argument that if\r\nAeschines had really been taken in by Philip, and believed the promises\r\nwhich he announced, or if he had actually heard Philip make the\r\npromises, he would have regarded Philip afterwards as a personal enemy,\r\nand not as a friend. But even on these points Aeschines might reply\r\n(though he could not reply so to the Athenian people or jury) that\r\nthough he did not trust the promises, he regarded the interest of\r\nAthens as so closely bound up with the alliance with Philip, that he\r\nconsidered it justifiable to deceive the people into making the\r\nalliance, or at least to take the risk of the promises which he\r\nannounced proving untrue. In any case there is no convincing evidence\r\nof corruption; and it may be taken as practically certain that he was\r\nnot bribed to perform particular services. It is less certain that he\r\nwas not influenced by generous presents from Philip in forming his\r\njudgement of Philip's character and intentions. The standard of\r\nAthenian public opinion in regard to the receipt of presents was not\r\nthat of the English Civil Service; and the ancient orators accuse one\r\nanother of corruption almost as a matter of course. (We have seen that\r\nDemosthenes began the attack upon Eubulus' party in this form as early\r\nas the Speech for the Rhodians; it appears in almost every subsequent\r\noration: and in their turn, his opponents make the same charge against\r\nhim.) It is, in any case, remarkable that at a time when the people was\r\nplainly exasperated with the Peace and its authors, and very\r\nill-disposed towards Philip, a popular jury nevertheless acquitted\r\nAeschines; and the verdict is not sufficiently explained either by the\r\nfact that Eubulus supported Aeschines or by the jurors' memory of\r\nDemosthenes' own part in the earlier peace-negotiations, though this\r\nmust have weakened the force of his attack. That Demosthenes himself\r\nbelieved Aeschines to have been bribed, and could himself see no other\r\nexplanation of his conduct, need not be doubted; and although the\r\nspeech contains some of those misrepresentations of fact and passages\r\nof irrelevant personal abuse which deface some of his best work, it\r\nalso contains some of his finest pieces of oratory and narrative.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the speech is more broken up into short sections and\r\nless clearly arranged than the first; earlier arguments are repeated,\r\nand a few passages may be due (at least in their present shape) to\r\nrevision after the trial: but the latter part even as it stands is\r\nsuccessful in leaving the points of greatest importance strongly\r\nimpressed upon the mind.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of the speech may enable the reader to find his\r\nway through it without serious difficulty:--\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION (§§ 1-28)\r\n\r\n(i) _Exordium_ (§§ 1, 2). Impartiality requested of the jury, in view\r\nof Aeschines' attempt to escape by indirect means.\r\n\r\n(ii) _Points of the trial_ (§§ 3-8). An ambassador must (1) give true\r\nreports; (2) give good advice; (3) obey his instructions; (4) not lose\r\ntime; (5) be incorruptible.\r\n\r\n(iii) _Preliminary exposition of the arguments_ (§§ 9-28).\r\n\r\n    (1) The previous anti-Macedonian zeal of Aeschines suddenly collapsed\r\n        after the First Embassy.\r\n\r\n    (2) In the deliberations on the Peace, Aeschines supported\r\n        Philocrates.\r\n\r\n    (3) After the Second Embassy, Aeschines prevented Athens from guarding\r\n        Thermopylae and saving the Phocians, by false reports and\r\n        promises.\r\n\r\n    (4) Such a change of policy is only explicable by corruption.\r\n\r\nPART 1 (§§ 29-178)\r\n\r\nThe five points of Introduction (ii) are treated as three, or in three\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n(i) The reports made by Aeschines on his return from the Second\r\nEmbassy, and his advice, especially as to the ruin of the Phocians (§§\r\n29-97).\r\n\r\n    (1) The reports (a) to the Senate, (b) to the People, and their\r\n        reception (§§ 29-46).\r\n\r\n    (2) Evidence that Aeschines conspired with Philip against the\r\n        Phocians, whose ruin is described (§§ 47-71).\r\n\r\n    (3) Refutation of three anticipated objections, beginning at § 72, §\r\n        78, § 80 respectively (§§ 72-82).\r\n\r\n    (4) The danger to Athens from Aeschines' treachery (§§ 83-7).\r\n\r\n    (5) Request to confine the trial strictly to relevant points\r\n        (§§ 88-97).\r\n\r\n(ii) The corruption of Aeschines by the bribes of Philip (§§ 98-149).\r\n\r\n    (1) Arguments (beginning § 102, § 111, § 114, § 116) showing the\r\n        corruption of Aeschines (§§ 98-119).\r\n\r\n    (2) Refutation of anticipated objections (beginning at § 120, § 134,\r\n        § 147) (§§ 120-49).\r\n\r\n(iii) Aeschines' loss of time, by which Philip profited, and\r\ndisobedience to his instructions (§§ 150-77).\r\n\r\n    (1) Narrative of the Second Embassy (§§ 150-62).\r\n\r\n    (2) Comparison of the two Embassies (§§ 163-5).\r\n\r\n    (3) Comparison of Demosthenes' own conduct with that of the other\r\n        ambassadors (§§ 167-77). Recapitulation of the points established\r\n        (§§ 177, 178).\r\n\r\nPART II (§§ 179-343)\r\n\r\n(i) The injury done to Athens--\r\n\r\n    (a) by the loss of Thrace and the Hellespont;\r\n\r\n    (b) generally, by false reports from ambassadors (§§ 179-86).\r\n\r\n(ii) Refutation of anticipated objections--\r\n\r\n    (a) 'It is not Philip's fault that he has not satisfied Athens'\r\n        (§ 187).\r\n\r\n    (b) 'Demosthenes has no right to prosecute' (§§ 188-220): including a\r\n        digression (§§ 192-200) on Aeschines' character and incidents in\r\n        his life.\r\n\r\n(iii) Demosthenes' object in prosecuting, passing into reproof of the\r\nlaxity of Athens towards traitors (§§ 221-33).\r\n\r\n(iv) Warning against any attempt by Aeschines to confuse the dates and\r\nincidents of the two Embassies (§§ 234-6.)\r\n\r\n(v) Criticism of Aeschines' brothers and his prosecution of Timarchus\r\n(§§ 237-58).\r\n\r\n(vi) The increasing danger from traitors, and the traditional attitude\r\nof Athens towards them (§§ 259-87).\r\n\r\n(vii) Attack upon Eubulus for defending Aeschines (§§ 288-99).\r\n\r\n(viii) Philip's policy and methods; proofs of Aeschines' complicity\r\nrepeated (§§ 300-31).\r\n\r\n(ix) Warnings to the jury against Aeschines' attempts to mislead them;\r\nand conclusion (§§ 331-43).]\r\n\r\n\r\n{1} How much interest this case has excited, men of Athens, and how\r\nmuch canvassing has taken place, must, I feel sure, have become fairly\r\nevident to you all, after the persistent overtures just now made to\r\nyou, while you were drawing your lots.[n] Yet I will make the request\r\nof you all--a request which ought to be granted even when unasked--that\r\nyou will not allow the favour or the person of any man to weigh more\r\nwith you than justice and the oath which each of you swore before he\r\nentered the court. Remember that what I ask is for your own welfare and\r\nfor that of the whole State; while the entreaties and the eager\r\ninterest of the supporters of the accused have for their aim the\r\nselfish advantage of individuals: and it is not to confirm criminals in\r\nthe possession of such advantages that the laws have called you\r\ntogether, but to prevent their attainment of them. {2} Now I observe\r\nthat while all who enter upon public life in an honest spirit profess\r\nthemselves under a perpetual responsibility, even when they have passed\r\ntheir formal examination, the defendant Aeschines does the very\r\nreverse. For before entering your presence to give an account of his\r\nactions, he has put out of the way one of those[n] who appeared against\r\nhim at his examination; and others he pursues with threats, thus\r\nintroducing into public life a practice which is of all the most\r\natrocious and most contrary to your interests. For if one who has\r\ntransacted and managed any public business is to render himself secure\r\nagainst accusation by spreading terror round him, rather than by the\r\njustice of his case, your supremacy[n] must pass entirely out of your\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n{3} I have every confidence and belief that I shall prove the defendant\r\nguilty of many atrocious crimes, for which he deserves the extreme\r\npenalty of the law. But I will tell you frankly of the fear which\r\ntroubles me in spite of this confidence. It seems to me, men of Athens,\r\nthat the issue of every trial before you is determined as much by the\r\noccasion as by the facts; and I am afraid that the length of time which\r\nhas elapsed since the Embassy may have caused you to forget the crimes\r\nof Aeschines, or to be too familiar with them. {4} I will tell you\r\ntherefore how, in spite of this, you may yet, as I believe, arrive at a\r\njust decision and give a true verdict to-day. You have, gentlemen of\r\nthe jury, to inquire and to consider what are the points on which it is\r\nproper to demand an account from an ambassador. He is responsible first\r\nfor his report; secondly, for what he has persuaded you to do; thirdly,\r\nfor his execution of your instructions; next, for dates; and, besides\r\nall these things, for the integrity or venality of his conduct\r\nthroughout. {5} And why is he responsible in these respects? Because on\r\nhis report must depend your discussion of the situation: if his report\r\nis true, your decision is a right one: if otherwise, it is the reverse.\r\nAgain, you regard the counsels of ambassadors as especially\r\ntrustworthy. You listen to them in the belief that they have personal\r\nknowledge of the matter with which they were sent to deal. Never,\r\ntherefore, ought an ambassador to be convicted of having given you any\r\nworthless or pernicious advice. {6} Again, it is obviously proper that\r\nhe should have carried out your instructions to him with regard to both\r\nspeech and action, and your express resolutions as to his conduct. Very\r\ngood. But why is he responsible for dates? Because, men of Athens, it\r\noften happens that the opportunity upon which much that is of great\r\nimportance depends lasts but for a moment; and if this opportunity is\r\ndeliberately and treacherously surrendered to the enemy, no subsequent\r\nsteps can possibly recover it. {7} But as to the integrity or\r\ncorruption of an ambassador, you would all, I am sure, admit that to\r\nmake money out of proceedings that injure the city is an atrocious\r\nthing and deserves your heavy indignation. Yet the implied distinction\r\nwas not recognized by the framer of our law. He absolutely forbade\r\n_all_ taking of presents, thinking, I believe, that a man who has once\r\nreceived presents and been corrupted with money no longer remains even\r\na safe judge of what is to the interest of the city. {8} If then I can\r\nconvict the defendant Aeschines by conclusive proofs of having made a\r\nreport that was utterly untrue, and prevented the people from hearing\r\nthe truth from me; if I prove that he gave advice that was entirely\r\ncontrary to your interests; that on his mission he fulfilled none of\r\nyour instructions to him; that he wasted time, during which\r\nopportunities for accomplishing much that was of great importance were\r\nsacrificed and lost to the city; and that he received presents in\r\npayment for all these services, in company with Philocrates; then\r\ncondemn him, and exact the penalty which his crimes deserve. If I fail\r\nto prove these points, or fail to prove them all, then regard me with\r\ncontempt, and let the defendant go.\r\n\r\n{9} I have still to charge him, men of Athens, with many atrocious acts\r\nin addition to these--acts which would naturally call forth the\r\nexecration of every one among you. But I desire, before all else that I\r\nam about to say, to remind you (though most of you, I know, remember it\r\nwell) of the position which Aeschines originally took up in public\r\nlife, and the speeches which he thought it right to address to the\r\npeople against Philip; for I would have you realize that his own\r\nactions, his own speeches at the beginning of his career, are the\r\nstrongest evidence of his corruption. {10} According to his own public\r\ndeclaration at that time, he was the first Athenian to perceive that\r\nPhilip had designs against the Hellenes and was corrupting certain\r\nleading men in Arcadia. With Ischander, the son of Neoptolemus, to\r\nsecond him in his performance, he came before the Council and he came\r\nbefore the people, to speak on the subject: he persuaded you to send\r\nenvoys in all directions to bring together a congress at Athens to\r\ndiscuss the question of war with Philip: {11} then, on his return from\r\nArcadia, he reported to you those noble and lengthy speeches which, he\r\nsaid, he had delivered on your behalf before the Ten Thousand[n] at\r\nMegalopolis, in reply to Philip's spokesman, Hieronymus; and he\r\ndescribed at length the criminal wrong that was done, not only to their\r\nown several countries, but to all Hellas, by men who took bribes and\r\nreceived money from Philip. {12} Such was his policy at that time, and\r\nsuch the sample which he displayed of his sentiments. Then you were\r\ninduced by Aristodemus, Neoptolemus, Ctesiphon, and the rest of those\r\nwho brought reports from Macedonia in which there was not an honest\r\nword, to send ambassadors to Philip and to negotiate for peace.\r\nAeschines himself is appointed one of them, in the belief, not that he\r\nwas one of those who would sell your interests, or had placed\r\nconfidence in Philip, but rather one who would keep an eye on the rest.\r\nThe speeches which he had already delivered, and his antipathy to\r\nPhilip, naturally led you to take this view of him. {13} Well, after\r\nthis he came to me[n] and tried to make an agreement by which we should\r\nact in concert on the Embassy, and urged strongly that we should both\r\nkeep an eye upon that abominable and shameless man Philocrates; and\r\nuntil we returned to Athens from the First Embassy, I at least, men of\r\nAthens, had no idea that he had been corrupted and had sold himself.\r\nFor (not to mention the other speeches which, as I have told you, he\r\nhad made on former occasions) at the first of the assemblies in which\r\nyou debated about the Peace, he rose and delivered an exordium which I\r\nthink I can repeat to you word for word as he uttered it at the\r\nmeeting. {14} 'If Philocrates,' he said, 'had spent a very long time in\r\nstudying how he could best oppose the Peace, I do not think he could\r\nhave found a better device than a motion of this kind. The Peace which\r\nhe proposes is one which I can never recommend the city to make, so\r\nlong as a single Athenian remains alive. Peace, however, we ought, I\r\nthink, to make.' {15} And he made a brief and reasonable speech in the\r\nsame tone. But though he had spoken thus at the first meeting, in the\r\nhearing of you all, yet at the second meeting, when the Peace was to be\r\nratified; when I was upholding the resolution of the allies and working\r\nfor a Peace on just and equitable terms; when you in your desire for\r\nsuch a Peace would not even listen to the voice of the despicable\r\nPhilocrates; then, I say, Aeschines rose and spoke in support of him,\r\nusing language for which he deserves, God knows, to die many deaths,\r\n{16} saying that you must not remember your forefathers, nor tolerate\r\nspeakers who recalled your trophies and your victories by sea; and that\r\nhe would frame and propose a law, that you should assist no Hellene who\r\nhad not previously assisted you. These words he had the callous\r\nshamelessness to utter in the very presence and hearing of the\r\nambassadors[n] whom you had summoned from the Hellenic states, in\r\npursuance of the advice which he himself had given you, before he had\r\nsold himself.\r\n\r\n{17} You elected him again, men of Athens, to receive the oaths. How he\r\nfrittered away the time, how cruelly he injured all his country's\r\ninterests, and what violent mutual enmity arose between myself and him\r\nin consequence of his conduct and of my desire to prevent it, you shall\r\nhear presently. But when we returned from this Embassy which was sent\r\nto receive the oaths, and the report of which is now under examination;\r\nwhen we had secured nothing, either small or great, of all that had\r\nbeen promised and expected when you were making the Peace, but had been\r\ntotally deceived; when they had again acted without regard to their\r\ninstructions,[n] and had conducted their mission in direct defiance of\r\nyour decree; we came before the Council: and there are many who have\r\npersonal knowledge of what I am about to tell you, for the\r\nCouncil-Chamber was crowded with spectators. {18} Well, I came forward\r\nand reported to the Council the whole truth: I denounced these men: I\r\nrecounted the whole story, beginning with those first hopes, aroused in\r\nyou by the report of Ctesiphon and Aristodemus, and going on to the\r\nspeeches which Aeschines delivered during the time of the\r\nPeace-negotiations, and the position into which they had brought the\r\ncity: as regards all that remained to you--I meant the Phocians and\r\nThermopylae--I counselled you not to abandon these, not to be victims\r\nonce more of the same mistake, not to let yourselves be reduced to\r\nextremities through depending upon a succession of hopes and promises:\r\nand I carried the Council with me. {19} But when the day of the\r\nAssembly came, and it was our duty to address you, the defendant\r\nAeschines came forward before any of his colleagues--and I entreat you,\r\nin God's name, to follow me, and try to recollect whether what I tell\r\nyou is true; for now we have come to the very thing which so cruelly\r\ninjured and ruined your whole cause. He made not the remotest attempt\r\nto give any report of the results of the Embassy--if indeed he\r\nquestioned the truth of my allegations at all--but instead of this, he\r\nmade statements of such a character, promising you benefits so numerous\r\nand so magnificent, that he completely carried you away with him. {20}\r\nFor he said that,[n] before his return, he had persuaded Philip upon\r\nall the points in which the interests of the city were involved, in\r\nregard both to the Amphictyonic dispute and to all other matters: and\r\nhe described to you a long speech which he professed to have addressed\r\nto Philip against the Thebans, and of which he reported to you the\r\nsubstance, calculating that, as the result of his own diplomacy, you\r\nwould within two or three days, without stirring from home or taking\r\nthe field or suffering any inconvenience, hear that Thebes was being\r\nblockaded, alone and isolated from the rest of Boeotia, {21} that\r\nThespiae and Plataeae were being repeopled, and that the debt due to\r\nthe god[n] was being exacted not from the Phocians, but from the\r\nThebans who had planned the seizure of the temple. For he said that he\r\ngave Philip to understand that those who planned the act were no less\r\nguilty of impiety than those whose hands executed the plan; and that on\r\nthis account the Thebans had set a price upon his head. {22} Moreover,\r\nhe said that he heard some of the Euboeans, who had been thrown into a\r\nstate of panic and confusion by the friendly relations established\r\nbetween Athens and Philip, saying to the ambassadors, 'You have not\r\nsucceeded, gentlemen, in concealing from us the conditions on which you\r\nhave made your Peace with Philip; nor are we unaware that while you\r\nhave given him Amphipolis, he has undertaken to hand over Euboea to\r\nyou.' There was, indeed, another matter which he had arranged as well,\r\nbut he did not wish to mention this at present, since even as it was\r\nsome of his colleagues were jealous of him. {23} This was an\r\nenigmatical and indirect allusion to Oropus. These utterances naturally\r\nraised him high in your estimation; he seemed to be an admirable\r\nspeaker and a marvellous man; and he stepped down with a very lofty\r\nair. Then I rose and denied all knowledge of these things, and at the\r\nsame time attempted to repeat some part of my report to the Council.\r\nBut they now took their stand by me, one on this side, one on that--the\r\ndefendant and Philocrates; they shouted, they interrupted me, and\r\nfinally they jeered, while you laughed. {24} You would not hear, and\r\nyou did not wish to believe anything but what Aeschines had reported.\r\nHeaven knows, your feelings were natural enough; for who, that expected\r\nall these marvellous benefits, would have tolerated a speaker who said\r\nthat the expectation would not be realized, or denounced the\r\nproceedings of those who made the promise? All else, of course, was of\r\nsecondary importance at the time, in comparison with the expectations\r\nand the hopes placed before you; any contradiction appeared to be\r\nnothing but sheer obstruction and malignity, while the proceedings\r\ndescribed seemed to be of incredible importance and advantage to the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n{25} Now with what object have I recalled these occurrences to you\r\nbefore everything else, and described these speeches of his? My first\r\nand chief object, men of Athens, is that none of you, when he hears me\r\nspeak of any of the things that were done and is struck by their\r\nunparalleled atrocity, may ask in surprise why I did not tell you at\r\nonce and inform you of the facts; {26} but may remember the promises\r\nwhich these men made at each critical moment, and by which they\r\nentirely prevented every one else from obtaining a hearing; and that\r\nsplendid pronouncement by Aeschines; and that you may realize that in\r\naddition to all his other crimes, you have suffered this further wrong\r\nat his hands--that you were prevented from learning the truth\r\ninstantly, when you ought to have learned it, because you were deluded\r\nby hopes, deceits and promises. {27} That is my first and, as I have\r\nsaid, my chief object in recalling all these occurrences. But there is\r\na second which is of no less importance than the first, and what is\r\nthis? It is that you may remember the policy which he adopted in his\r\npublic life, when he was still uncorrupted--his guarded and mistrustful\r\nattitude towards Philip; and may consider the sudden growth of\r\nconfidence and friendship which followed; {28} and then, if all that he\r\nannounced to you has been realized, if the results achieved are\r\nsatisfactory, you may believe that all has been done out of an honest\r\ninterest in the welfare of Athens; but if, on the other hand, the issue\r\nhas been exactly the opposite of that which he predicted: if his policy\r\nhas involved the city in great disgrace and in grave perils, you may\r\nthen be sure that his conversion was due to his own base covetousness\r\nand to his having sold the truth for money.\r\n\r\n{29} And now, since I have been led on to this subject, I desire to\r\ndescribe to you, before everything else, the way in which they took the\r\nPhocian question entirely out of your hands. And let none of you,\r\ngentlemen of the jury, when he looks at the magnitude of the\r\ntransactions, imagine that the crimes with which the defendant is\r\ncharged are on a grander scale than one of his reputation could\r\ncompass. You have rather to observe that any one whom you would have\r\nplaced in such a position as this--a position in which, as each\r\ncritical moment arrived, the decision would be in his hands--could have\r\nbrought about disasters equal to those for which Aeschines is\r\nresponsible, if, like Aeschines, he had wished to sell his services,\r\nand to cheat and deceive you. {30} For however contemptible[n] may be\r\nthe men whom you frequently employ in the public service, it does not\r\nfollow that the part which the world expects this city to play is a\r\ncontemptible one. Far from it! And further, though it was Philip, of\r\ncourse, who destroyed the Phocian people, it was Aeschines and his\r\nparty who seconded Philip's efforts. And so what you have to observe\r\nand consider is whether, so far as the preservation of the Phocians\r\ncame within the scope of their mission, these men deliberately\r\ndestroyed and ruined that whole cause. You have not to suppose that\r\nAeschines ruined the Phocians by himself. How could he have done so?\r\n\r\n{31} (_To the clerk._) Now give me the draft-resolution which the\r\nCouncil passed in view of my report, and the deposition of the clerk\r\nwho wrote it. (_To the jury._) For I would have you know that I am not\r\nrepudiating to-day transactions about which I held my peace at the\r\ntime, but that I denounced them at once, with full prevision of what\r\nmust follow; and that the Council, which was not prevented from hearing\r\nthe truth from me, neither voted thanks to the ambassadors, nor thought\r\nfit to invite them to the Town Hall.[n] From the foundation of the city\r\nto this day, no body of ambassadors is recorded to have been treated\r\nso; nor even Timagoras,[n] whom the people condemned to death. {32} But\r\nthese men have been so treated. (_To the clerk._) First read them the\r\ndeposition, and then the resolution.\r\n\r\n[_The deposition and resolution are read._]\r\n\r\nHere is no expression of thanks, no invitation of the ambassadors to\r\nthe Town Hall by the Council. If Aeschines asserts that there is any,\r\nlet him point it out and produce it, and I give way to him. But there\r\nis none. Now on the assumption that we all fulfilled our mission in the\r\nsame way, the Council had good reason not to thank any of us, for the\r\ntransactions of all alike were in that case atrocious. But if some of\r\nus acted uprightly, while others did the reverse, it must, it seems,\r\nhave been owing to the knavery of their colleagues that the virtuous\r\nwere forced to take their share of this dishonour. {33} How then can\r\nyou all ascertain without any difficulty who is the rogue? Recall to\r\nyour minds who it is that has denounced the transaction from the\r\noutset. For it is plain that it must have been the guilty person who\r\nwas well content to be silent, to stave off the day of reckoning for\r\nthe moment, and to take care for the future not to present himself to\r\ngive an account of his actions; while it must have been he whose\r\nconscience was clear to whom there occurred the thought of the danger,\r\nlest through keeping silence he might be regarded as a partner in such\r\natrocious villany. Now it is I that have denounced these men from the\r\noutset, while none of them has accused me. {34} Such then was the\r\nresolution of the Council. The meeting of the Assembly took place when\r\nPhilip was already at Thermopylae: for this was the first of all their\r\ncrimes, that they placed Philip in command of the situation, so that,\r\nwhen you ought first to have heard the facts, then to have deliberated,\r\nand afterwards to have taken such measures as you had resolved upon,\r\nyou in fact heard nothing until he was on the spot, and it was no\r\nlonger easy to say what steps you ought to take. {35} In addition to\r\nthis, no one read the resolution of the Council to the people, and the\r\npeople never heard it; but Aeschines rose and delivered the harangue\r\nwhich I just now described to you, recounting the numerous and\r\nimportant benefits which he said he had, before his return, persuaded\r\nPhilip to grant, and on account of which the Thebans had set a price\r\nupon his head. In consequence of this, appalled though you were at\r\nfirst at the proximity of Philip, and angry with these men for not\r\nhaving warned you of it, you became as mild as possible, having now\r\nformed the expectation that all your wishes would be realized; and you\r\nwould not hear a word from me or from any one else. {36} After this was\r\nread the letter from Philip, which Aeschines had written[n] when we had\r\nleft him behind, a letter which was nothing less than a direct and\r\nexpress defence in writing of the misconduct of the ambassadors. For in\r\nit is stated that Philip himself prevented them, when they were anxious\r\nto go to the several cities and receive the oaths, and that he retained\r\nthem in order that they might help him to effect a reconciliation\r\nbetween the peoples of Halus and Pharsalus. He takes upon his own\r\nshoulders the whole of their misconduct, and makes it his own. {37} But\r\nas to the Phocians and Thespiae, and the promises contained in\r\nAeschines' report to you--why, there is not the slightest mention of\r\nthem! And it was no mere accident that the proceedings took this form.\r\nFor the failure of the ambassadors to carry out or give effect to any\r\nof the instructions imposed upon them by your resolution--the failure\r\nfor which you were bound to punish them--Philip makes himself\r\nresponsible in their stead, and says that the fault was his; for you\r\nwere not likely, of course, to be able to punish _him_. {38} But the\r\npoints in regard to which Philip wished to deceive you and to steal a\r\nmarch upon the city were made the subject of the defendant's report, in\r\norder that you might be able to find no ground of accusation or\r\nreproach against Philip, since these points were not mentioned either\r\nin his letter or in any other part of the communications received from\r\nhim. But (_to the clerk_) read the jury the actual letter--written by\r\nAeschines, sent by Philip; and (_to the jury_) do you observe that it\r\nis such as I have described. (_To the clerk._) Read on.\r\n\r\n[_The letter is read._]\r\n\r\n{39} You hear the letter, men of Athens; you hear how noble and\r\ngenerous it is. But about the Phocians or the Thebans or the other\r\nsubjects of the defendant's report--not a syllable. Indeed, in this\r\nletter there is not an honest word, as you will very shortly see for\r\nyourselves. He says that he retained the ambassadors to help him\r\nreconcile the people of Halus: and such is the reconciliation that they\r\nhave obtained, that they are exiles from their country, and their city\r\nis laid waste. And as to the prisoners, though he professed to be\r\nwondering what he could do to gratify you, he says that the idea of\r\nprocuring their release had not occurred to any one. {40} But evidence\r\nhas, as you know, been laid before you many times in the Assembly, to\r\nthe effect that I myself went to ransom them, taking a talent[n] for\r\nthe purpose; and it shall now be laid before you once more. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that it was to deprive me of my laudable ambition[n] that\r\nAeschines persuaded Philip to insert this statement. But the strongest\r\npoint of all is this. In his former letter--the letter which we brought\r\nback--he wrote, 'I should have mentioned expressly the great benefits\r\nthat I propose to confer upon you, if I felt sure that you would grant\r\nme the alliance as well.' And yet when the alliance has been granted,\r\nhe says that he does not know what he can do to gratify you. He does\r\nnot even know what he had himself promised! Why, he must obviously have\r\nknown that, unless he was trying to cheat you! To prove that he did\r\nwrite thus and in these terms, (_to the clerk_) take his former letter,\r\nand read the very passage, beginning at this point. Read on.\r\n\r\n[_An extract from the letter is read._]\r\n\r\n{41} Thus, before he obtained the Peace, he undertook to set down in\r\nwriting the great benefits he would confer on the city, in the event of\r\nan alliance also being granted him. But as soon as he had obtained both\r\nhis wishes, he says that he does not know what he can do to gratify\r\nyou, but that if you will inform him, he will do anything that will not\r\ninvolve any disgrace or stigma upon himself. Such are the excuses in\r\nwhich he takes refuge, to secure his retreat, in case you should\r\nactually make any suggestion or should be induced to ask any favour.\r\n\r\n{42} It would have been possible to expose this whole proceeding at the\r\ntime--and a great deal more--without delay; to inform you of the facts,\r\nand to prevent you from sacrificing your cause, had not the thought of\r\nThespiae and Plataeae, and the idea that the Thebans were on the very\r\npoint of paying the penalty, robbed you of the truth. While, however,\r\nthere was good reason for mentioning these prospects, if the city was\r\nto hear of them and then be cheated, it would have been better, if\r\ntheir realization was actually intended, that nothing should have been\r\nsaid about them. For if matters had already reached a stage at which\r\nthe Thebans would be no better off, even if they perceived the design\r\nagainst them, why was the design not fulfilled? But if its fulfilment\r\nwas prevented because they perceived it in time, who was it that\r\nbetrayed the secret? {43} Must it not have been Aeschines? Its\r\nfulfilment, however, was not in fact intended, nor did the defendant\r\neither desire or expect it; so that he may be relieved of the charge of\r\nbetraying the secret. What was intended was that you should be\r\nhoodwinked by these statements, and should refuse to hear the truth\r\nfrom me; that you should not stir from home, and that such a decree\r\nshould carry the day as would involve the destruction of the Phocians.\r\nHence this prodigality in promises, and their proclamation in his\r\nspeech to the people.\r\n\r\n{44} When I heard Aeschines making all these magnificent promises, I\r\nknew perfectly well that he was lying; and I will tell you how I knew.\r\nI knew it first, because when Philip was about to take the oath in\r\nratification of the Peace, the Phocians were openly excluded from it.\r\nThis was a point which it would have been natural to pass over in\r\nsilence, if the Phocians were really to be saved. And secondly, I knew\r\nit because the promises were not made by Philip's ambassadors or in\r\nPhilip's letter, but by the defendant. {45} Accordingly, drawing my\r\nconclusions from these facts, I rose and came forward and attempted to\r\ncontradict him; but as you were not willing to hear me, I held my\r\npeace, with no more than these words of solemn protest, which I entreat\r\nyou, in Heaven's name, to remember. 'I have no knowledge of these\r\npromises,' I said, 'and no share in making them; and,' I added, 'I do\r\nnot believe they will be fulfilled.' This last expression roused your\r\ntemper, and I proceeded, 'Take care, men of Athens, that if any of\r\nthese things comes to pass, you thank these gentlemen for it, and give\r\nyour honours and crowns to them, and not to me. If, however, anything\r\nof an opposite character occurs, you must equally vent your anger on\r\nthem: I decline all responsibility.' {46} 'No, no!' interrupted\r\nAeschines, 'do not decline responsibility now! Take care rather that\r\nyou do not claim credit, when the time comes.' 'Indeed, it would be an\r\ninjustice if I did so,' I replied. Then Philocrates arose with a most\r\ninsolent air, and said, 'It is no wonder, men of Athens, that I and\r\nDemosthenes should disagree; for he drinks water, I drink wine.' And\r\nyou laughed.\r\n\r\n{47} Now consider the decree which Philocrates proposed and handed\r\nin.[n] An excellent resolution it sounds, as you hear it now. But when\r\nyou take into account the occasion on which it was proposed, and the\r\npromises which Aeschines was then making, you will see that their\r\naction amounts to nothing less than a surrender of the Phocians to\r\nPhilip and the Thebans, and that, practically, with their hands tied\r\nbehind their backs. (_To the clerk._) Read the decree.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read._]\r\n\r\n{48} There, men of Athens, is the decree, overflowing with expressions\r\nof gratitude and auspicious language. 'The Peace,' it says, 'which is\r\ngranted to Philip shall be granted on the same terms to his\r\ndescendants, and also the alliance.' Again, we are 'to thank Philip for\r\nhis promised acts of justice'. Yet Philip made no promises: so far was\r\nhe from making promises that he said he did not know what he could do\r\nto gratify you. {49} It was Aeschines who spoke in his name, and made\r\nthe promises. Then Philocrates took advantage of the enthusiasm which\r\nAeschines' words aroused in you, to insert in the decree the clause,\r\n'and unless the Phocians act as they are bound, and surrender the\r\ntemple to the Amphictyons, the Athenian people will render their\r\nassistance against those who still stand in the way of such surrender.'\r\n{50} Thus, men of Athens, at a time when you were still at home and had\r\nnot taken the field, when the Spartans had foreseen the deception and\r\nretired, and when none of the Amphictyons were on the spot but the\r\nThessalians and Thebans, he proposes in the most innocent-sounding\r\nlanguage in the world that they shall deliver up the temple to these.\r\nFor he proposes that they shall deliver it up to the Amphictyons. But\r\nwhat Amphictyons? for there were none there but the Thessalians and\r\nThebans. He does not propose that the Amphictyons should be convoked,\r\nor that they should wait until the Amphictyons met or that Proxenus\r\nshould render assistance in Phocis, or that the Athenians should take\r\nthe field, or anything of the sort. {51} Philip did indeed actually\r\nsend two letters to summon you.[n] But he did not intend you really to\r\nmarch from Athens. Not a bit of it! For he would not have waited to\r\nsummon you until he had seen the time go by in which you could have set\r\nout; nor would he have tried to prevent me, when I wished to set sail\r\nand return hither; nor would he have instructed Aeschines to speak to\r\nyou in the terms which would be least likely to cause you to march. No!\r\nhe intended that you should fancy that he was about to fulfil your\r\ndesires, and in that belief should abstain from any resolution adverse\r\nto him; and that the Phocians should, in consequence, make no defence\r\nor resistance, in reliance upon any hopes inspired by you, but should\r\nput themselves into his hands in utter despair. (_To the clerk._) Read\r\nto the jury the letters of Philip.\r\n\r\n[_The letters are read._]\r\n\r\n{52} Now these letters summon you, and that, forsooth, instantly; and\r\nit was surely for Aeschines and his party, if the proceeding was in any\r\nway genuine, to support the summons, to urge you to march, and to\r\npropose that Proxenus, whom they knew to be in those parts, should\r\nrender assistance at once. Yet it is plain that their action was of\r\nprecisely the opposite character; and naturally so. For they did not\r\nattend to the terms of the letter, but to the intention with which\r\nPhilip wrote it. {53} With this intention they co-operated, and to this\r\nthey strove to give effect. As soon as the Phocians had learned the\r\nnews of your proceedings in the Assembly, and had received this decree\r\nof Philocrates, and heard the defendant's announcement and his\r\npromises, everything combined to effect their doom. Consider the\r\ncircumstances. There were some of them who had the wisdom to distrust\r\nPhilip. These were induced to trust him. And why? Because they believed\r\nthat even if Philip were trying to deceive them ten times over, the\r\nambassadors of Athens, at least, would never dare to deceive their own\r\ncountrymen. This report which Aeschines had made to you must therefore\r\nbe true: it was the Thebans, and not themselves, whose hour had come.\r\n{54} There were others who advocated resistance at all hazards; but\r\nthese too were weakened in their resolution, now that they were\r\npersuaded that they could count upon Philip's favour, and that, unless\r\nthey did as they were bidden, you, whose assistance they were hoping\r\nfor, would march against them. There was also a third party, who\r\nthought that you repented of having made the Peace with Philip; but to\r\nthese they pointed out that you had decreed that the same Peace should\r\nhold good for posterity also; so that on every ground, all assistance\r\nfrom you was despaired of. That is why they crowded all these points\r\ninto one decree. {55} And in this lies, I think, the very greatest of\r\nall their crimes against you. To have made a Peace with a mortal man,\r\nwhose power was due to the accidents of the moment--a Peace, whereby\r\nthey covenanted that the disgrace brought upon the city should be\r\neverlasting; to have robbed the city, not only of all beside, but even\r\nof the benefits that Fortune might hereafter bestow: to have displayed\r\nsuch superabundant villany as to have done this wicked wrong not only\r\nto their countrymen now living, but also to all those who should ever\r\nthereafter be born--is it not utterly atrocious? {56} And this last\r\nclause, by which the Peace was extended to your descendants, you would\r\ncertainly never have allowed to be added to the conditions of peace had\r\nyou not then placed your trust in the promises announced by Aeschines,\r\nas the Phocians placed their trust in them and perished. For, as you\r\nknow, they delivered themselves up to Philip; they gave their cities\r\ninto his hands; and the consequences which befell them were the exact\r\nopposite of all that Aeschines had predicted to you.\r\n\r\n{57} That you may realize plainly that this calamity was brought about\r\nin the manner that I have described, and that they are responsible for\r\nit, I will go through the dates at which each separate event occurred;\r\nand if any one can contradict me on any point, I invite him to rise and\r\nspeak in the time allotted to me. The Peace was made on the 19th of\r\nElaphebolion, and we were away on the mission which was sent to receive\r\nthe oaths three whole months. {58} All this time the Phocians remained\r\nunharmed. We returned from that mission on the 13th of Scirophorion.\r\nPhilip had already appeared at Thermopylae, and was making promises to\r\nthe Phocians, none of which they believed--as is proved, when you\r\nconsider that otherwise they would not have appealed to you. Then\r\nfollowed the Assembly, at which, by their falsehoods and by the\r\ndeception which they practised upon you, Aeschines and his party ruined\r\nthe whole cause. {59} That was on the 16th of Scirophorion. Now I\r\ncalculate that it was on the fifth day that the report of your\r\nproceedings reached the Phocians: for the Phocian envoys were here on\r\nthe spot, and were deeply concerned to know what report these men would\r\nmake, and what your resolution would be. That gives us the 20th as the\r\ndate on which, as we calculate, the Phocians heard of your proceedings;\r\nfor, counting from the 16th, the 20th is the fifth day. Then followed\r\nthe 21st, the 22nd, and the 23rd. {60} On the latter day the truce was\r\nmade, and the ruin of the Phocians was finally sealed. This can be\r\nproved as follows. On the 27th you were holding an Assembly in the\r\nPeiraeus, to discuss the business connected with the dockyards, when\r\nDercylus arrived from Chalcis with the news that Philip had put\r\neverything into the hands of the Thebans, and that this was the fifth\r\nday since the truce had been made. 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th--the\r\n27th is the fifth day precisely. Thus the dates, and their reports and\r\ntheir proposals--everything, in short, convicts them of having\r\nco-operated with Philip, and of sharing with him the responsibility for\r\nthe overthrow of the Phocians. {61} Again, the fact that none of the\r\ntowns in Phocis was taken by siege or by an attack in force, and that\r\nthe utter ruin of them all was the direct consequence of their truce\r\nwith Philip, affords the strongest evidence that it was the belief\r\ninspired in the Phocians by these men, that they would be preserved\r\nfrom destruction by Philip, which was the cause of their fate. Philip\r\nhimself they knew well enough. (_To the clerk._) Bring me our treaty of\r\nalliance with the Phocians, and the decrees under which they demolished\r\ntheir walls. (_To the jury._) You will then realize what were the\r\nrelations between themselves and you, upon which they relied, and what\r\nnevertheless was the fate which befell them through the action of these\r\naccursed men. (_To the clerk._) Read.\r\n\r\n[_The Treaty of Alliance between the Athenians and Phocians is read._]\r\n\r\n{62} These, then, were the things for which they relied upon\r\nyou--friendship, alliance, and assistance. Now listen to what befell\r\nthem, because Aeschines prevented your going to their assistance. (_To\r\nthe clerk._) Read.\r\n\r\n [_The Agreement between Philip and the Phocians is read._]\r\n\r\nYou hear it, men of Athens. 'An Agreement between Philip and the\r\nPhocians,' it runs--not between the Thebans and the Phocians, nor the\r\nThessalians and the Phocians, nor the Locrians, nor any one else who\r\nwas there. Again, 'the Phocians shall deliver up their cities to\r\nPhilip'--not to the Thebans or Thessalians or any one else. {63} And\r\nwhy? Because the defendant's report to you was that Philip had crossed\r\nthe Pass with a view to the preservation of the Phocians. Thus it was\r\nAeschines in whom all their trust was placed; it was with him in their\r\nminds that they considered the whole situation; it was with him in\r\ntheir minds that they made the Peace. (_To the clerk._) Now read the\r\nremainder. (_To the jury._) And do you observe for what they trusted\r\nhim, and what treatment they received. Does it show any resemblance or\r\nsimilarity to what Aeschines predicted in his report? (_To the clerk._)\r\nRead on.\r\n\r\n[_The decrees of the Amphictyons are read._]\r\n\r\n{64} Men of Athens, the horror and the immensity of this calamity have\r\nnever been surpassed in our day in the Hellenic world, nor even, I\r\nbelieve, in the time before us. Yet these great and dreadful events a\r\nsingle man has been given power to bring about, by the action of these\r\nmen, while the city of Athens was still in being--Athens, whose\r\ntraditional policy is to stand as the champion of the Hellenic peoples,\r\nand not to suffer anything like this to take place. The nature of the\r\nruin which the unhappy Phocians have suffered may be seen, not only\r\nfrom these decrees, but also from the actual results of the action\r\ntaken, and an awful and piteous sight it is, men of Athens. {65} For\r\nwhen recently we were on our way to Delphi[n] we could not help seeing\r\nit all--houses razed to the ground, cities stripped of their walls, the\r\nland destitute of men in their prime--only a few poor women and little\r\nchildren left, and some old men in misery. Indeed, no words can\r\ndescribe the distress now prevailing there. Yet this was the people, I\r\nhear you all saying, that once gave its vote against the Thebans,[n]\r\nwhen the question of your enslavement was laid before them. {66} What\r\nthen, men of Athens, do you think would be the vote, what the sentence,\r\nthat your forefathers would give, if they could recover consciousness,\r\nupon those who were responsible for the destruction of this people? I\r\nbelieve that if they stoned them to death with their own hands, they\r\nwould hold themselves guiltless of blood. Is it not utterly\r\nshameful--does it not, if possible, go beyond all shame--that those who\r\nsaved us then, and gave the saving vote for us, should now have met\r\nwith the very opposite fate through these men, suffering as no Hellenic\r\npeople has ever suffered before, with none to hinder it? Who then is\r\nresponsible for this crime? Who is the author of this deception? Who\r\nbut Aeschines?\r\n\r\n{67} Of all the many reasons for which Philip might be congratulated\r\nwith good cause upon his fortune, the chief ground of congratulation is\r\na piece of good fortune, to which, by every Heavenly Power, I cannot\r\nfind any parallel in our days. To have captured great cities, to have\r\nreduced a vast expanse of territory to subjection, and all similar\r\nactions, are, of course, enviable and brilliant\r\nachievements--undeniably so. But many other persons might be mentioned\r\nwho had achieved as much. {68} The good fortune of which I am about to\r\nspeak is peculiar to Philip, and has never been given to any other. It\r\nis this--that when he needed scoundrels to do his work for him, he\r\nfound even greater scoundrels than he wanted. For as such we have\r\nsurely good reason to think of them. For when there were falsehoods\r\nwhich Philip himself, in spite of the immense interests which he had at\r\nstake, did not dare to utter on his own behalf--which he did not set\r\ndown in any of his letters, and which none of his envoys uttered--these\r\nmen sold their services for the purpose, and undertook your deception.\r\n{69} Antipater and Parmenio, servants of a master as they were, and\r\nunlikely ever to find themselves in your presence again, none the less\r\nsecured for themselves that _they_ should not be the instruments in\r\nyour deception, while these men, who were Athenians, citizens of the\r\nmost free city, and held an official position as your\r\nambassadors--though they would have to meet you and look you in the\r\nface, and pass the remainder of their lives among you, and render\r\nbefore you an account of their actions--they, I say, undertook the task\r\nof deceiving you. How could vileness or desperation go further than\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n{70} But I would have you understand further that he is under your\r\ncurse, and that you cannot, without violation of religion and piety,\r\nacquit him, when he has thus lied to you. (_To the clerk._) Recite the\r\nCurse. Take it from me, and read it out of the law.\r\n\r\n[_The Curse is read._]\r\n\r\nThis imprecation is pronounced in your name, men of Athens, by the\r\nherald, at every meeting of the Assembly, as the law appoints; and when\r\nthe Council sits, it is pronounced again there. Nor can Aeschines say\r\nthat he did not know it well. He was your under-clerk and servant to\r\nthe Council, and used himself to read this law over[n] to the herald.\r\n{71} Surely, then, you will have done a strange and monstrous thing,\r\nmen of Athens, if to-day, when you have it in your power, you should\r\nfail to do for yourselves the thing which you enjoin upon the gods, or\r\nrather claim from them as your due; and should acquit a man whom you\r\npray to the gods to destroy utterly--himself, his race and his house.\r\nYou must not do this. You may leave it to the gods to punish one whom\r\nyou cannot yourselves detect; but when you have yourselves caught the\r\ncriminal, you must no longer lay the task of punishing him upon the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n{72} Now I am told that he intends to carry his shamelessness and\r\nimpudence so far, as to avoid all mention of his own proceedings--his\r\nreport, his promises, the deception he has practised upon the city--as\r\nthough his trial were taking place before strangers, instead of before\r\nyou, who know all the facts; and that he intends to accuse first the\r\nSpartans,[n] then the Phocians,[n] and then Hegesippus.[n] {73} That is\r\nmere mockery; or rather, it is atrocious shamelessness. For all that he\r\nwill allege to-day against the Phocians or the Spartans or\r\nHegesippus--their refusal to receive Proxenus, their impiety--let him\r\nallege what he will--all these allegations refer, as you know, to\r\nactions which were already past when these ambassadors returned to\r\nAthens, and which were no obstacle to the preservation of the\r\nPhocians--the admission is made by whom? By the defendant Aeschines\r\nhimself. For what was his report on that occasion? {74} Not that if it\r\nhad not been for their refusal to receive Proxenus, nor that if it had\r\nnot been for Hegesippus, nor that if it had not been for such and such\r\nthings, the Phocians would have been saved. No! he discarded all such\r\nqualifications, and stated expressly that before he returned he had\r\npersuaded Philip to save the Phocians, to repeople Boeotia, and to\r\narrange matters to suit your convenience; that within two or three days\r\nthese things would be accomplished facts, and that for this reason the\r\nThebans had set a price upon his head. {75} Refuse then, to hear or to\r\ntolerate any mention of what had already been done, either by the\r\nSpartans or by the Phocians, before he made his report; and do not let\r\nhim denounce the rascality of the Phocians. It was not for their virtue\r\nthat you once saved the Spartans, nor the Euboeans, that accursed\r\npeople! nor many others; but because the interests of the city demanded\r\ntheir preservation, as they demanded that of the Phocians just now. And\r\nwhat wrong was done either by the Phocians or by the Spartans, or by\r\nyourselves, or by any one else in the world after he made those\r\ndeclarations, to prevent the fulfilment of the promises which he then\r\nmade? Ask him that: for that is what he will {76} not be able to show\r\nyou. It was within five days--five days and no more--that Aeschines\r\nmade his lying report, that you believed him, that the Phocians heard\r\nof it, surrendered themselves and perished. This, I think, makes it as\r\nplain as it can possibly be, that the ruin of the Phocians was the\r\nresult of organized deceit and trickery, and of nothing else.[n] For so\r\nlong as Philip was unable to proceed to Phocis on account of the\r\nPeace,[n] and was only waiting in readiness to do so, he kept sending\r\nfor the Spartans, promising to do all that they wished,[n]in order that\r\nthe Phocians might not win {77} them over to their side by your help.\r\nBut when he had arrived at Thermopylae, and the Spartans had seen the\r\ntrap and retired, he now sent Aeschines in advance to deceive you, in\r\norder that he might not, owing to your perceiving that he was playing\r\ninto the hands of the Thebans, find himself once more involved in loss\r\nof time and war and delay, through the Phocians defending themselves\r\nand your going to their assistance, but might get everything into his\r\npower without a struggle; and this is what has in fact happened. Do\r\nnot, then, let the fact that Philip deceived the Spartans and Phocians\r\nas well as yourselves enable Aeschines to escape his punishment for\r\ndeceiving you. That would not be just.\r\n\r\n{78} But if he tells you that, to compensate for the Phocians and\r\nThermopylae and all your other losses, you have retained possession of\r\nthe Chersonese, do not, in Heaven's name, accept the plea! Do not\r\ntolerate the aggravation of all the wrong that you have suffered\r\nthrough his conduct as ambassador, by the reproach which his defence\r\nwould bring upon the city--the reproach of having sacrificed the\r\nexistence of your allies, in an underhand attempt to save part of your\r\nown possessions! You did not act thus; for when the Peace had already\r\nbeen made, and the Chersonese was no longer in danger, there followed\r\nfour whole months[n] during which the Phocians remained unharmed; and\r\nit was not until after this that the lying statements of Aeschines\r\nbrought about their ruin by deceiving you. {79} And further, you will\r\nfind that the Chersonese is in much greater danger now than it was\r\nthen. For when do you think that we had the greater facilities for\r\npunishing Philip for any trespass against the Chersonese?--before he\r\nstole any of these advantages from the city, or now? For my part, I\r\nthink we had far greater facilities then. What, then, does this\r\n'retention of the Chersonese' amount to, when all the fears and the\r\nrisks which attended one who would have liked to attack it have been\r\nremoved?\r\n\r\n{80} Again, I am told that he will express himself to some such effect\r\nas this--that he cannot think why he is accused by Demosthenes, and not\r\nby any of the Phocians. It is better that you should hear the true\r\nstate of the case from me beforehand. Of the exiled Phocians, the best,\r\nI believe, and the most respectable, after being driven into banishment\r\nand suffering as they have suffered, are content to be quiet, and none\r\nof them would consent to incur an enmity which would fall upon himself,\r\non account of the calamities of his people: while those who would do\r\nanything for money have no one to give it to them. {81} For assuredly\r\n_I_ would never have given any one anything whatever to stand by my\r\nside here and cry aloud how cruelly they have suffered. The truth and\r\nthe deeds that have been done cry aloud of themselves. And as for the\r\nPhocian people,[n] they are in so evil and pitiable a plight, that\r\nthere is no question for them of appearing as accusers at the\r\nexamination of every individual ambassador in Athens. They are in\r\nslavery, in mortal fear of the Thebans and of Philip's mercenaries,\r\nwhom they are compelled to support, broken up into villages as they are\r\nand stripped of their arms. {82} Do not, then, suffer him to urge such\r\na plea. Make him prove to you that the Phocians are not ruined, or that\r\nhe did not promise that Philip would save them. For the questions upon\r\nwhich the examination of an ambassador turns are these: 'What have you\r\neffected? What have you reported? If the report is true, you may be\r\nacquitted; if it is false, you must pay the penalty.' How can you plead\r\nthe non-appearance of the Phocians, when it was you yourself, I fancy,\r\nthat brought them, so far as it lay in your power, into such a\r\ncondition that they could neither help their friends nor repel their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n{83} And further, apart from all the shame and the dishonour in which\r\nalso these proceedings are involved, it is easy to show that in\r\nconsequence of them the city has been beset with grave dangers as well.\r\nEvery one of you knows that it was the hostilities which the Phocians\r\nwere carrying on, and their command of Thermopylae, that rendered us\r\nsecure against Thebes, and made it impossible that either Philip or the\r\nThebans should ever march into the Peloponese or into Euboea or into\r\nAttica. {84} But this guarantee of safety which the city possessed,\r\narising out of the position of Thermopylae and the actual circumstances\r\nof the time, you were induced to sacrifice by the deceptions and the\r\nlying statements of these ambassadors--a guarantee, I say, fortified by\r\narms, by a continuous campaign, by great cities of allies, and by a\r\nwide tract of territory; and you have looked on while it was swept\r\naway. Fruitless has your first expedition to Thermopylae become--an\r\nexpedition made at a cost of more than two hundred talents, if you\r\ninclude the private expenditure of the soldiers--and fruitless your\r\nhopes of triumph over Thebes! {85} But of all the wicked services which\r\nhe has done for Philip, let me tell you of that which is in reality the\r\ngreatest outrage of all upon Athens and upon you all. It is this--that\r\nwhen Philip had determined from the very first to do for the Thebans\r\nall that he has done, Aeschines, by reporting the exact opposite to\r\nyou, and so displaying to the world your antagonism to Philip's\r\ndesigns, has brought about for you an increase in the enmity between\r\nyourselves and the Thebans, and for Philip an increase in their\r\ngratitude. How could a man have treated you more outrageously than this?\r\n\r\n(_To the clerk._) {86} Now take and read the decrees of Diophantus[n]\r\nand Callisthenes[n]; (_to the jury_) for I would have you realize that\r\nwhen you acted as you ought, you were thought worthy to be honoured\r\nwith public thanksgivings and praises, both at home and abroad; but\r\nwhen once you had been driven astray by these men, you had to bring\r\nyour children and wives in from the country, and to decree that the\r\nsacrifice to Heracles[n] should take place within the walls, though it\r\nwas a time of peace. And in view of this it is an amazing idea, that\r\nyou should dismiss unpunished a man who even prevented the gods from\r\nreceiving their worship from you after the manner of your fathers. (_To\r\nthe clerk._) Read the decree.\r\n\r\n[_The decree of Diophantus is read._]\r\n\r\nThis decree, men of Athens, was one which your conduct nobly deserved.\r\n(_To the clerk._) Now read the next decree.\r\n\r\n[_The decree of Callisthenes is read._]\r\n\r\n{87} This decree you passed in consequence of the action of these men.\r\nIt was not with such a prospect in view that you made the Peace and the\r\nalliance at the outset, or that you were subsequently induced to insert\r\nthe words which extended them to your posterity. You expected their\r\naction to bring you benefits of incredible value. Aye, and besides\r\nthis, you know how often, after this, you were bewildered by the report\r\nthat Philip's forces and mercenaries were threatening Porthmus or\r\nMegara. You have not then to reflect contentedly that Philip has not\r\nyet set foot in Attica. You have rather to consider whether their\r\naction has not given him power to do so when he chooses. It is that\r\ndanger that you must keep before your eyes, and you must execrate and\r\npunish the man who is guilty of putting such power into Philip's hands.\r\n\r\n{88} Now I am aware that Aeschines will eschew all defence of the\r\nactions with which he is charged, and that, in his desire to lead you\r\nas far away as possible from the facts, he will enumerate the great\r\nblessings which Peace brings to all mankind, and will set against them\r\nthe evils that follow in the train of war. His whole speech will be a\r\neulogy of peace, and in that will consist his defence. But such an\r\nargument actually incriminates the defendant further. If peace, which\r\nbrings such blessings to all other men, has been the source of such\r\ntrouble and confusion to us, what explanation can be found, except that\r\nthey have taken bribes and have cruelly marred a thing by nature so\r\nfair? {89} 'What?' he may say, 'have you not to thank the Peace for\r\nthree hundred ships, with their fittings, and for funds which remain\r\nand will remain yours?' In answer to this, you are bound to suppose\r\nthat, thanks to the Peace, Philip's resources too have become far more\r\nample--aye, and his command of arms, and of territory, and of revenues,\r\nwhich have accrued to him to such large amounts. {90} We, too, have had\r\nsome increase of revenue. But as for power and alliances, by the\r\nestablishment of which all men retain their advantages, either for\r\nthemselves or their masters, ours have been sold by these men--ruined\r\nand enfeebled; while Philip's have become more formidable and extensive\r\nby far. Thus it is not fair that while Philip has been enabled by their\r\naction to extend both his alliances and his revenue, all that would in\r\nany case have been ours, as the result of the Peace, should be set off\r\nagainst what they themselves sold to Philip. The former did not come to\r\nus in exchange for the latter. Far from it! For had it not been for\r\nthem, not only should we have had the former, as we have now, but we\r\nshould have had the latter as well.\r\n\r\n{91} You would doubtless admit, men of Athens, in general terms, that,\r\non the one hand, however many and terrible the disasters that have\r\nbefallen the city, your anger cannot justly be visited upon Aeschines,\r\nif none of them has been caused by him; and that, on the other hand,\r\nAeschines is not entitled to be acquitted on account of any\r\nsatisfactory results that may have been accomplished through the action\r\nof others. You must examine the acts of Aeschines himself, and then\r\nshow him your favour if he is worthy of it, or your resentment, on the\r\nother hand, if his acts prove to be deserving ing of that. {92} How,\r\nthen, can you solve this problem fairly? You will do so if, instead of\r\nallowing him to confound all questions with one another--the criminal\r\nconduct of the generals, the war with Philip, the blessings that flow\r\nfrom peace--you consider each point by itself. For instance, were we at\r\nwar with Philip? We were. Does any one accuse Aeschines on that ground?\r\nDoes any one wish to bring any charge against him in regard to things\r\nthat were done in the course of the war? No one whatever. He is\r\ntherefore acquitted in regard to such matters, and must not say\r\nanything about them; for the witnesses and the proofs which a defendant\r\nproduces must bear upon the matters which are in dispute; he must not\r\ndeceive you by offering a defence upon points which are not disputed.\r\nTake care, then, that you say nothing about the war; for no one charges\r\nyou with any responsibility for that. {93} Later on we were urged by\r\ncertain persons to make peace. We consented; we sent ambassadors; and\r\nthe ambassadors brought commissioners to Athens who were to conclude\r\nthe Peace. Once more, does any one blame Aeschines for this? Does any\r\none allege that Aeschines introduced the proposal of peace, or that he\r\ncommitted any crime in bringing commissioners here to make it? No one\r\nwhatever. He must therefore say nothing in regard to the fact that the\r\ncity made peace; for he is not responsible for that. {94} 'Then what\r\n_is_ your assertion, sir?' I may be asked. 'At what point _do_ your\r\ncharges begin?' They begin, men of Athens, from the time when the\r\nquestion before you was not whether you should make peace or not (for\r\nthat had already been settled), but what sort of peace you should\r\nmake--when Aeschines opposed those who took the side of justice,\r\nsupported for a bribe the hireling mover of the decree, and afterwards,\r\nwhen he had been chosen to receive the oaths, failed to carry out every\r\none of your instructions, destroyed those of your allies who had passed\r\nunscathed through the war, and told you falsehoods whose enormity and\r\ngrossness has never been surpassed, either before or since. At the\r\noutset, before Philip was given a hearing in regard to the Peace,\r\nCtesiphon and Aristodemus took the leading part in the work of\r\ndeception; but when the time had come for action, they surrendered\r\ntheir rôle to Philocrates and Aeschines, who took it up and ruined\r\neverything. {95} And then, when he is bound to answer for his actions\r\nand to give satisfaction for them--like the unscrupulous God-forsaken\r\nclerk that he is--he will defend himself as though it were the Peace\r\nfor which he was being tried. Not that he wishes to account for more\r\nthan is charged against him--that would be lunacy. No! He sees rather\r\nthat in all his own proceedings no good can be found--that his crimes\r\nare his whole history; while a defence of the Peace, if it has no other\r\nmerits, has at least the kindly sound of the name to recommend it. {96}\r\nI fear, indeed, men of Athens, I fear that, unconsciously, we are\r\nenjoying this Peace like men who borrow at heavy interest. The\r\nguarantees of its security--the Phocians and Thermopylae--they have\r\nbetrayed. But, be that as it may, it was not through _Aeschines_ that\r\nwe originally made it; for, paradoxical as it may seem, what I am about\r\nto say is absolutely true--that if any one is honestly pleased at the\r\nPeace, it is the generals, who are universally denounced, that he must\r\nthank for it: for had they been conducting the war as you desired them\r\nto do, {97}you would not have tolerated even the name of peace. For\r\npeace, then, we must thank the generals; but the perilous, the\r\nprecarious, the untrustworthy nature of the Peace is due to the\r\ncorruption of these men. Cut him off, then, cut him off, I say, from\r\nall arguments in defence of the Peace! Set him to defend his own\r\nactions! Aeschines is not being tried on account of the Peace. On the\r\ncontrary, the Peace stands discredited owing to Aeschines. And here is\r\nevidence of the fact:--if the Peace had been made, and if no subsequent\r\ndeception had been practised upon you, and none of your allies had been\r\nruined, who on earth would have been hurt by the Peace, except in so\r\nfar as it was inglorious? And for its inglorious character the\r\ndefendant in fact shares the responsibility, for he spoke in support of\r\nPhilocrates. At least no irreparable harm would have been done; whereas\r\nnow, I believe, much has been done, and the guilt rests with the\r\ndefendant. {98} That these men have been the agents in this shameful\r\nand wicked work of ruin and destruction, I think you all know. Yet so\r\nfar am I, gentlemen of the jury, from putting any unfair construction\r\nupon these facts or asking you to do so, that if it has been through\r\nstupidity or simplicity, or ignorance in any form whatever, that such\r\nresults have been so brought about, I acquit Aeschines myself, and I\r\n{99} recommend you also to acquit him. At the same time none of these\r\nexcuses is either constitutional[n] or justifiable. For you neither\r\ncommand nor compel any one to undertake public business; but when any\r\none has satisfied himself of his own capacity and has entered political\r\nlife, then, like good-hearted, kindly men, you welcome him in a\r\nfriendly and ungrudging manner, and even elect him to office and place\r\nyour own interests in his hands. {100} Then, if a man succeeds, he will\r\nreceive honour and will so far have an advantage over the crowd. But if\r\nhe fails, is he to plead palliations and excuses? That is not fair. It\r\nwould not satisfy our ruined allies, or their children, or their wives,\r\nor the rest of the victims, to know that it was through my\r\nstupidity--not to speak of the stupidity of the defendant--that they\r\nhad suffered such a fate. Far from it! {101} Nevertheless, I bid you\r\nforgive Aeschines for these atrocious and unparalleled crimes if he can\r\nprove that it was simplicity of mind, or any form of ignorance\r\nwhatever, which led him to work such ruin. But if it was the rascality\r\nof a man who had taken money and bribes--if he is plainly convicted of\r\nthis by the very facts themselves--then, if it be possible, put him to\r\ndeath; or if not, make him, while he lives, an example to others.\r\n\r\nAnd now give your thoughts to the proof by which he is convicted on\r\nthese points, and observe how straightforward it will be.\r\n\r\n{102} If the defendant Aeschines was not deliberately deceiving you for\r\na price, he must necessarily, I presume, have had one of two reasons\r\nfor making the statements in question to you, in regard to the Phocians\r\nand Thespiae and Euboea. Either he must have heard Philip promise in\r\nexpress terms that such would be his policy and the steps he would\r\ntake; or else he must have been so far bewitched and deluded by\r\nPhilip's generosity in all other matters as to conceive these further\r\nhopes of him. There is no possible alternative besides these two. {103}\r\nNow in both these cases he, more than any living man, ought to detest\r\nPhilip. And why? Because, so far as Philip could bring it about, all\r\nthat is most dreadful and most shameful has fallen upon him. He has\r\ndeceived you; his reputation is gone [he is rightly ruined]; he is on\r\nhis trial; aye, and were the course of the proceedings in any way that\r\nwhich his conduct called for, he would long ago have been impeached;[n]\r\n{104-109} whereas now, thanks to your innocence and meekness, he\r\npresents his report, and that at the time which suits his own wishes. I\r\nask, then, if there is one among you who has ever heard Aeschines raise\r\nhis voice in denunciation of Philip--one, I say, who has seen Aeschines\r\nexposing him or saying a word against him? Not one! All Athens\r\ndenounces Philip before Aeschines does so. Every one whom you meet does\r\nso, though not one of them has been injured by him--I mean, of course,\r\npersonally. On the assumption that Aeschines had not sold himself, I\r\nshould have expected to hear him use some such expressions as\r\nthese--'Men of Athens, deal with _me_ as you will. I trusted Philip; I\r\nwas deceived; I was wrong; I confess my error. But beware of _him_, men\r\nof Athens. He is faithless--a cheat, a knave. Do you not see how he has\r\ntreated me? how he has deceived me?' {110} But I hear no such\r\nexpressions fall from him, nor do you. And why? Because he was _not_\r\nmisled; he was _not_ deceived; he made these statements, he betrayed\r\nall to Philip, because he had sold his services and received the money\r\nfor them; and gallantly and loyally has he behaved--as Philip's\r\nhireling. But as your ambassador, as your fellow citizen, he is a\r\ntraitor who deserves to die, not once, but thrice.\r\n\r\n{111} This is not the only evidence which proves that all those\r\nstatements of his were made for money. For, recently, the Thessalians\r\ncame to you, and with them envoys from Philip, demanding that you\r\nshould decree the recognition of Philip as one of the Amphictyons. Who\r\nthen, of all men, should naturally have opposed the demand? The\r\ndefendant Aeschines. And why? Because Philip had acted in a manner\r\nprecisely contrary to the announcement which Aeschines had made to you.\r\n{112} Aeschines declared that Philip would fortify Thespiae and\r\nPlataeae; that he intended, not to destroy the Phocians, but to put\r\ndown the insolence of Thebes. But in fact Philip has raised the Thebans\r\nto an undue height of power, while he has utterly destroyed the\r\nPhocians; and instead of fortifying Thespiae and Plataeae, he has\r\nbrought Orchomenus and Coroneia into the same bondage with them. How\r\ncould any contradiction be greater than this? Aeschines did not oppose\r\nthe demand. He neither opened his lips nor uttered a sound in\r\nopposition to it. {113} But even this, monstrous as it is, is not yet\r\nthe worst. For he, and he alone, in all Athens, actually supported the\r\ndemand. This not even Philocrates dared to do, abominable as he was; it\r\nwas left for the defendant Aeschines. And when you raised a clamour and\r\nwould not listen to him, he stepped down from the platform, and,\r\nshowing off before the envoys who had come from Philip, told them that\r\nthere were plenty of men who made a clamour, but few who took the field\r\nwhen it was required of them--you remember the incident, no\r\ndoubt--being himself, of course, a marvellous soldier, God knows!\r\n\r\n{114} Again, if we had been unable to prove that any of the ambassadors\r\nhad received anything--if the fact were not patent to all--we might\r\nthen have resorted to examination by torture,[n] and other such\r\nmethods. But if Philocrates not only admitted the fact frequently in\r\nyour presence at the Assembly, but used actually to make a parade of\r\nhis guilt--selling wheat, building houses, saying that he was going[n]\r\nwhether you elected him or not, importing timber, changing Macedonian\r\ngold openly at the bank--it is surely impossible for _him_ to deny that\r\nhe received money, when he himself confesses and displays his guilt.\r\n{115} Now, is any human being so senseless or so ill-starred that, in\r\norder that Philocrates might receive money, while he himself incurred\r\ninfamy and disgrace, he would want to fight against those upright\r\ncitizens in whose ranks he might have stood, and to take the side of\r\nPhilocrates and face a trial? I am sure that there is no such man; but\r\nin all these considerations, if you examine them aright, you will find\r\nstrong and evident signs of the corruption of the defendant.\r\n\r\n{116} Consider next an incident which occurred last in order of time,\r\nbut which is second to none as an indication that Aeschines had sold\r\nhimself to Philip. You doubtless know that in the course of the recent\r\nimpeachment of Philocrates by Hypereides, I came forward and expressed\r\nmy dissatisfaction with one feature of the impeachment--namely, the\r\nidea that Philocrates alone had been responsible for all these\r\nmonstrous crimes, and that the other nine ambassadors had no share in\r\nthem. I said that it was not so, for Philocrates by himself would have\r\nbeen nowhere, had he not had some of them to co-operate with him. {117}\r\n'And therefore,' I said, 'in order that I may not personally acquit or\r\naccuse any one, and that the guilty may be detected, and those who have\r\nhad no share in the crime acquitted by the evidence of their own\r\nconduct, let any one who wishes to do so rise and come forward into\r\nyour midst, and let him declare that he has no share in it, and that\r\nthe actions of Philocrates are displeasing to him. Any one who does\r\nthis,' I said, 'I acquit.' You remember the incident, I am sure. {118}\r\nWell, no one came forward or showed himself. Each of the others has\r\nsome excuse. One was not liable to examination; another, perhaps, was\r\nnot present; a third is related to Philocrates. But Aeschines has no\r\nsuch excuse. No! So completely has he sold himself, once for all--so\r\nplain is it that his wages are not for past services only, but that, if\r\nhe escapes now, Philip can equally count upon his help against you in\r\nthe future--that to avoid letting fall even a word that would be\r\nunfavourable to Philip, he does not accept his discharge[n] even when\r\nyou offer to discharge him, but chooses to suffer infamy, to stand his\r\ntrial and to endure any treatment in this court, rather than to take a\r\nstep that would not please Philip. {119} But what is the meaning of\r\nthis partnership, this careful forethought for Philocrates? For if\r\nPhilocrates had by his diplomacy accomplished the most honourable\r\nresults and achieved all that your interest required, and yet admitted\r\n(as he did admit) that he had made money by his mission, this very fact\r\nwas one by which an uncorrupted colleague should have been repelled and\r\nset him on his guard, and led to protest to the best of his power.\r\nAeschines has not acted in this way. Is it not all clear, men of\r\nAthens? Do not the facts cry aloud and tell you that Aeschines has\r\ntaken money, that he is a rascal for a price, and that\r\nconsistently--not through stupidity, or ignorance, or bad luck? {120}\r\n'But where is the witness who testifies to my corruption?' he asks.\r\nWhy, this is the finest thing of all![n] The witnesses, Aeschines, are\r\nfacts; and they are the surest of all witnesses: none can assert or\r\nallege against them, that they are influenced by persuasion or by\r\nfavour to any one: what your treachery and mischief have made them,\r\nsuch, when examined, they must appear. But, besides the facts, you\r\nshall at once bear witness against yourself. Come, stand up[n] and\r\nanswer me! Surely you will not plead that you are so inexperienced as\r\nnot to know what to say. For when, under the ordinary limitations of\r\ntime, you prosecute and win cases that have all the novelty of a\r\nplay[n]--cases, too, that have no witness to support them--you must\r\nplainly be a speaker of tremendous genius.\r\n\r\n{121} Many and atrocious as are the crimes of the defendant Aeschines,\r\nand great as is the wickedness which is implied by them (as I am sure\r\nyou also feel) there is none which is more atrocious than that of which\r\nI am about to speak to you, and none which will afford more palpable\r\nproof that he has taken bribes and sold everything. For when once more,\r\nfor the third time, you sent the ambassadors to Philip on the strength\r\nof those high and noble expectations which the defendant's promises had\r\nroused, you elected both Aeschines and myself, and most of those whom\r\nyou had previously sent. {122} For my part I came forward and declined\r\nupon oath to serve;[n] and though some raised a clamour and bade me go,\r\nI declared that I would not; but the defendant had already been\r\nelected. Afterwards, when the Assembly had risen, he and his party met\r\nand discussed whom they should leave behind in Athens. For while\r\neverything was still in suspense, and the future doubtful, there were\r\nall kinds of gatherings and discussions in the market-place. {123} They\r\nwere afraid, no doubt, that a special meeting of the Assembly might\r\nsuddenly be called, and that you might then hear the truth from me, and\r\npass some of the resolutions which it was your duty to pass in the\r\ninterest of the Phocians, and that so Philip's object might slip from\r\nhis grasp. For had you merely passed a resolution and shown them the\r\nfaintest ray of hope of any kind, the Phocians would have been saved.\r\nIt was absolutely impossible for Philip to stay where he was, unless\r\nyou were misled. There was no corn in the country, for, owing to the\r\nwar, the land had not been sown; and to import corn was impossible so\r\nlong as your ships were there and in command of the sea; while the\r\nPhocian towns were many in number, and difficult to take except by a\r\nprolonged siege. Even assuming that he were taking a town a day, there\r\nare two and twenty of them. {124} For all these reasons they left\r\nAeschines in Athens, to guard against any alteration of the course\r\nwhich you had been deluded into taking. Now to decline upon oath to\r\nserve, without any cause, was a dangerous and highly suspicious\r\nproceeding. 'What?' he would have been asked, 'are you not going on the\r\nmission which is to secure all those wonderful good things which you\r\nhave foretold?' Yet he was bound to remain. How could it be done? He\r\npleads illness. His brother took with him Execestus the physician, came\r\nbefore the Council, swore that Aeschines was too ill to serve, and was\r\nhimself elected in his place. {125} Five or six days later the ruin of\r\nthe Phocians had been accomplished, and Aeschines' contract--a mere\r\nmatter of business--had been fulfilled. Dercylus turned back, and on\r\nhis arrival here from Chalcis announced to you the destruction of the\r\nPhocians, while you were holding an Assembly in the Peiraeus. On\r\nhearing the news you were naturally struck with sympathy for them, and\r\nwith terror for yourselves. You passed resolutions to bring in your\r\nchildren and wives from the country, to repair the garrison-forts, to\r\nfortify the Peiraeus, and to celebrate the sacrifice to Heracles within\r\nthe city walls: {126} and in the midst of all this, in the midst of the\r\nconfusion and the tumult which had fallen upon the city, this learned\r\nand able speaker, so loud of voice, though not elected[n] either by the\r\nCouncil or by the people, set off as ambassador to the man who had\r\nwrought the destruction, taking no account of the illness which he had\r\npreviously made his excuse, upon oath, for not serving, nor of the\r\nelection of another ambassador in his place, nor of the law which\r\nimposes the penalty of death for such offences; {127} nor yet\r\nreflecting how utterly atrocious it was, that after announcing that the\r\nThebans had placed a price on his head, he should choose the moment\r\nwhen the Thebans had (in addition to all Boeotia, which they already\r\npossessed) become masters of the territory of the Phocians as well, to\r\ngo into the very midst of Thebes, and into the very camp of the\r\nThebans. But so beside himself was he, so utterly bent upon his profits\r\nand his bribe, that he ruled out and overlooked all such\r\nconsiderations, and took his departure.\r\n\r\n{128} Such was the nature of this transaction; and yet his proceedings\r\nwhen he arrived at his destination are far worse. All of you who are\r\npresent, and all other Athenians as well, thought the treatment of the\r\nunhappy Phocians so atrocious and so cruel that you sent to the Pythian\r\ngames neither the official deputation from the Council, nor the\r\nThesmothetae,[n] but abandoned that ancient representation of\r\nyourselves at the festival. But Aeschines went to the triumphal\r\nfeast[n] with which the Thebans and Philip were celebrating the victory\r\nof their cause and their arms. He joined in the festival: he shared in\r\nthe libations and the prayers which Philip offered over the ruined\r\nwalls and country and arms of your allies: with Philip he set garlands\r\non his head, and raised the paean, and drank the loving-cup. {129} Nor\r\nis it possible for the defendant to give a different version of the\r\nfacts from that which I have given. As regards his sworn refusal to\r\nserve, the facts are in your public records in the Metroon,[n] guarded\r\nby your officer; and a decree stands recorded with express reference to\r\nthe name of Aeschines.[n] And as for his conduct there, his fellow\r\nambassadors, who were present, will bear witness against him. They told\r\nme the story; for I was not with them on this Embassy, having entered a\r\nsworn refusal to serve.\r\n\r\n(_To the clerk._) {130} Now read me the resolution [and the record],\r\nand call the witnesses.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read, and the witnesses called._]\r\n\r\nWhat prayers, then, do you imagine Philip offered to the gods, when he\r\npoured his libation, or the Thebans? Did they not ask them to give\r\nsuccess in war, and victory, to themselves and their allies, and the\r\ncontrary to the allies of the Phocians? In these prayers, therefore--in\r\nthese imprecations upon his own country--Aeschines joined. It is for\r\nyou to return them upon his own head to-day.\r\n\r\n{131} His departure, then, was a contravention of the law which imposes\r\nthe penalty of death for the offence, and it has been shown that on his\r\narrival he acted in a manner for which he deserves to die again and\r\nagain, while his former proceedings and the work which he did as\r\nambassador, in their interest,[n] would justly slay him. Ask yourselves\r\nwhat penalty can be found, which will adequately atone for all these\r\ncrimes? {132} It would surely be shameful, men of Athens, that while\r\nall of you, and the whole people, denounce publicly all the\r\nconsequences of the Peace; while you decline to take part in the\r\nbusiness of the Amphictyons; while your attitude towards Philip is one\r\nof vexation and mistrust, because the deeds that have been done are\r\nimpious and atrocious, instead of righteous and advantageous to you;\r\nthat nevertheless, when you have come into court as the sworn\r\nrepresentatives of the State, to sit in judgement upon the report of\r\nthese proceedings, you should acquit the author of all the evil, when\r\nyou have taken him red-handed in actions like these. {133} Who is there\r\nof all your fellow citizens--nay, who of all the Hellenes--that would\r\nnot have good cause for complaint against you, when he saw that though\r\nyou were enraged against Philip, who in making peace after war was\r\nmerely purchasing the means to his end from those who offered them for\r\nsale--a very pardonable transaction--you were yet acquitting Aeschines,\r\nwho sold your interests in this shameful manner, notwithstanding the\r\nextreme penalties which the laws appoint for such conduct?\r\n\r\n{134} Now it is possible that an argument may also be used by the other\r\nside to some such effect as this--that the condemnation of those whose\r\ndiplomacy brought about the Peace will mean the beginning of enmity\r\nwith Philip. If this is true, then, I can imagine, upon consideration,\r\nno more serious charge that I could bring against the defendant, than\r\nthis. If Philip, who spent his money on the Peace which he wished to\r\nobtain, has become so formidable, so powerful, that you have already\r\nceased to regard your oaths and the justice of the case, and are\r\nseeking how you can gratify Philip, what penalty, that those who are\r\nresponsible for this could suffer, would be adequate to the offence?\r\n{135} I believe, however, that I shall actually show you that it would\r\nmore probably mean the beginning of a friendship, advantageous to you.\r\nFor you must be well assured, men of Athens, that Philip does not\r\ndespise your city; nor was it because he regarded you as less\r\nserviceable than the Thebans, that he preferred them to you. No! {136}\r\nHe had been instructed by these men and had heard from them, what I\r\nonce told you in the Assembly, without contradiction from any of them,\r\nthat the People is the most unstable thing in the world, and the most\r\nincalculable, inconstant as a wave of the sea, stirred by any chance\r\nwind. One comes, another goes; but no one cares for the public\r\ninterest, or remembers it. Philip needs (he is told) friends upon whom\r\nhe can rely to execute and manage his business with you--such friends,\r\nfor instance, as his informant.[n] If this were secured for him, he\r\nwould easily effect all that he desired in Athens. {137} Now if he\r\nheard that those who had used such language to him had immediately upon\r\ntheir return been beaten to death, he would doubtless have behaved as\r\nthe Persian king did. And how was this? He had been deceived by\r\nTimagoras,[n] and had given him, it is said, forty talents; but when he\r\nheard that Timagoras had been put to death here, and had not even power\r\nto secure his own life, much less to carry out the promises he had made\r\nto him, he recognized that he had not paid the price to the man who had\r\nthe power to effect his object. For first, as you know, he sent a\r\ndispatch, acknowledging once more your title to Amphipolis, which he\r\nhad previously described as in alliance and friendship with himself;\r\nand secondly, he thenceforward wholly abstained from giving money to\r\nany one. {138} This is exactly what Philip would have done, if he had\r\nseen that any of these men had paid the penalty, and what, if he sees\r\nit, he will still do. But when he hears that they address you, and\r\nenjoy a high reputation with you, and prosecute others, what is he to\r\ndo? Is he to seek to spend much, when he can spend less? or to desire\r\nto court the favour of all, when he need but court two or three? That\r\nwould be madness. For even those public benefits which Philip conferred\r\nupon the Thebans he conferred not from choice-- far from it--but\r\nbecause he was induced to do so by their ambassadors; and I will tell\r\nyou how. {139} Ambassadors came to him from Thebes just at the time\r\nwhen we were there upon our mission from you. Philip wished to give\r\nthem money, and that (so they said) in very large amounts. The Theban\r\nambassadors would not accept or receive it. After that, while drinking\r\nat a sacrificial banquet and displaying his generosity towards them,\r\nPhilip offered, as he drank to them, presents of many kinds--captives\r\nand the like--and finally he offered them goblets of gold and silver.\r\nAll these they steadily refused, declining to put themselves in his\r\npower in any way. {140} At last Philo, one of the ambassadors, made a\r\nspeech, men of Athens, which was worthy to be made in the name, not of\r\nThebes, but of yourselves. For he said that it gave them pleasure and\r\ndelight to see the magnanimous and generous attitude of Philip towards\r\nthem; but for their own personal part, they were already his good\r\nfriends even without these presents; and they begged him to apply his\r\ngenerosity to the existing political situation of their country, and to\r\ndo something worthy of himself and Thebes, promising that, if he did\r\nso, their whole city, as well as themselves, would become attached to\r\nhim. {141} And now observe what the Thebans have gained by this, and\r\nwhat consequences have followed; and contemplate in a real instance the\r\nadvantages of refusing to sell your country's interests. First of all,\r\nthey obtained peace when they were already distressed and suffering\r\nfrom the war, in which they were the losing side. Next, they secured\r\nthe utter ruin of their enemies, the Phocians, and the complete\r\ndestruction of their walls and towns. And was this all? No, indeed! For\r\nbesides all this they obtained Orchomenus, Coroneia, Corsia, the\r\nTilphossaeum, and as much of the territory of the Phocians as they\r\ndesired. {142} This then was what the Thebans gained by the Peace; and\r\nsurely no more could they have asked even in their prayers. And the\r\nambassadors of Thebes gained--what? Nothing but the credit of having\r\nbrought this good fortune to their country; and a noble reward it was,\r\nmen of Athens, a proud record on the score of merit and honour--that\r\nhonour which Aeschines and his party sold for money. Let us now set\r\nagainst one another the consequences of the Peace to the city of Athens\r\nand to the Athenian ambassadors respectively; and then observe whether\r\nits effects have been similar in the case of the city and of these men\r\npersonally. {143} The city has surrendered all her possessions and all\r\nher allies; she has sworn to Philip that even if another approaches\r\nthem to preserve them for her, you will prevent him; that you will\r\nconsider any one who wishes to give them up to you as your enemy and\r\nfoe, and the man who has robbed you of them as your ally and friend.\r\n{144} That is the resolution which Aeschines supported, and which was\r\nmoved by his accomplice Philocrates; and although on the first day I\r\nwas successful, and had persuaded you to ratify the decree of the\r\nallies and to summon Philip's envoys,[n] the defendant forced an\r\nadjournment of the question till the next day, and persuaded you to\r\nadopt the resolution of Philocrates, in which these proposals, and many\r\nothers even more atrocious, are made. {145} These were the consequences\r\nof the Peace to Athens. It would not be easy to devise anything more\r\nshameful. What were the consequences to the ambassadors who brought\r\nthese things about? I say nothing of all that you have seen for\r\nyourselves--the houses, the timber, the wheat. But they also possess\r\nproperties and extensive estates in the country of your ruined allies,\r\nbringing in incomes of a talent to Philocrates and thirty minae to the\r\ndefendant. {146} Yet surely, men of Athens, it is an atrocious and a\r\nmonstrous thing, that the calamities of your allies should have become\r\nsources of revenue to your ambassadors, and that the same Peace which\r\nto the city that sent them meant the ruin of her allies, the surrender\r\nof her possessions, and shame in the place of honour, should have\r\ncreated for the ambassadors who brought these things to pass against\r\ntheir country, revenue, affluence, property, and wealth, in the place\r\nof abject poverty. To prove, however, that what I am telling you is\r\ntrue (_to the clerk_) call me the witnesses from Olynthus.\r\n\r\n[_The witnesses are called._]\r\n\r\n{147} Now I should not wonder if he even dared to make some such\r\nstatement as this--that the Peace which we were making could not have\r\nbeen made an honourable one, or such as I demanded, because our\r\ngenerals had mismanaged the war. If he argues thus, then remember, in\r\nHeaven's name, to ask him whether[n] it was from some other city that\r\nhe went as ambassador, or from this city itself? If it was from some\r\nother, to whose success in war and to whose excellent generals he can\r\npoint, then it was natural for him to take Philip's money: but if it\r\nwas from Athens itself, why do we find him taking presents as part of a\r\ntransaction which involved the surrender of her possessions by the city\r\nwhich sent him? For in any honest transaction the city that sent the\r\nambassadors ought to have shared the same fortune as the ambassadors\r\nwhom she sent. {148} Consider also this further point, men of Athens.\r\nDo you think that the successes of the Phocians against the Thebans in\r\nthe war, or the successes of Philip against you, were the more\r\nconsiderable? Those of the Phocians against the Thebans, I am quite\r\ncertain. At least, they held Orchomenus and Coroneia and the\r\nTilphossaeum;[n] they had intercepted the Theban garrison at Neones;[n]\r\nthey had slain two hundred of them on Hedyleum;[n] a trophy had been\r\nraised, their cavalry were victorious, and a whole Iliad of misfortunes\r\nhad beset the Thebans. You were in no such position as this, and may\r\nyou never be so in the future! Your most serious disadvantage in your\r\nhostilities with Philip was your inability to inflict upon him all the\r\ndamage that you desired; you were completely secure against suffering\r\nany harm yourselves. How is it then that, as the result of one and the\r\nsame Peace, the Thebans, who were being so badly worsted in the war,\r\nhave recovered their own possessions and, in addition, have gained\r\nthose of their enemies; while you, the Athenians, have lost under the\r\nPeace even what you retained safely through the war? It is because\r\ntheir ambassadors did not sell their interests, while these men have\r\nsold yours. [Ah! he will say,[n] but the allies were exhausted by the\r\nwar....]. That this is how these things were accomplished, you will\r\nrealize still more clearly from what I have yet to say.\r\n\r\n{150}For when this Peace was concluded--the Peace of Philocrates, which\r\nAeschines supported--and when Philip's envoys had set sail, after\r\nreceiving the oaths from us--and up to this time nothing that had been\r\ndone was irreparable, for though the Peace was disgraceful and unworthy\r\nof Athens, still we were to get those marvellous good things in\r\nreturn--then I say, I asked and told the ambassadors to sail as quickly\r\nas possible to the Hellespont, and not to sacrifice any of our\r\npositions there, nor allow Philip to occupy them in the interval. {151}\r\nFor I knew very well that everything that is sacrificed when peace is\r\nin process of being concluded after war, is lost to those who are so\r\nneglectful; since no one who had been induced to make peace with regard\r\nto the situation as a whole ever yet made up his mind to fight afresh\r\nfor the sake of possessions which had been left unsecured; such\r\npossessions those who first take them keep. And, apart from this, I\r\nthought that, if we sailed, the city could not fail to secure one of\r\ntwo useful results. Either, when we were there and had received\r\nPhilip's oath according to the decree, he would restore the possessions\r\nof Athens which he had taken, and keep his hands off the rest; {152}\r\nor, if he did not do so, we should immediately report the fact to you\r\nhere, and so, when you saw his grasping and perfidious disposition in\r\nregard to those your remoter and less important interests, you would\r\nnot in dealing with greater matters close at hand--in other words, with\r\nthe Phocians and Thermopylae--let anything be lost. If he failed to\r\nforestall you in regard to these, and you were not deceived, your\r\ninterests would be completely secured, and he would give you your\r\nrights without hesitation. {153} And I had good reason for such\r\nexpectations. For if the Phocians were still safe and sound, as they\r\nthen were, and were in occupation of Thermopylae, Philip would have had\r\nno terror to brandish before you, which could make you overlook any of\r\nyour rights. For he was not likely either to make his way through by\r\nland, or to win a victory by sea, and so reach Attica; while if he\r\nrefused to act as was right, you would instantly close his ports,\r\nreduce him to straits for money and other supplies, and place him in a\r\nstate of siege; and in that case it would be he, and not you, to whom\r\nthe advantages of peace would be the overmastering consideration. {154}\r\nAnd that I am not inventing this or claiming wisdom after the\r\nevent--that I knew it at once, and, with your interest in view, foresaw\r\nwhat must happen and told my colleagues--you will realize from the\r\nfollowing facts. When there was no longer any meeting of the Assembly\r\navailable (since you had used up all the appointed days) and still the\r\nambassadors did not depart, but wasted time here, I proposed a decree\r\nas a member of the Council, to which the people had given full powers,\r\nthat the ambassadors should depart directly, and that the admiral\r\nProxenus should convey them to any district in which he should\r\nascertain Philip to be. My proposal was just what I now tell you,\r\ncouched expressly in those terms. (_To the clerk_.) Take this decree\r\nand read it.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read_.]\r\n\r\n{155} I brought them away, then, from Athens, sorely against their\r\nwill, as you will clearly understand from their subsequent conduct.\r\nWhen we reached Oreus and joined Proxenus, instead of sailing and\r\nfollowing their instructions, they made a circuitous journey by land,\r\nand before we reached Macedonia we had spent three and twenty days. All\r\nthe rest of the time, until Philip's arrival, we were sitting idle at\r\nPella; and this, with the journey, brought the time up to fifty days in\r\nall. {156} During this interval, in a time of peace and truce, Philip\r\nwas taking Doriscus,[n] Thrace, the district towards the Walls, the\r\nSacred Mountain--everything, in fact, and making his own arrangements\r\nthere; while I spoke out repeatedly and insistently, first in the tone\r\nof a man giving his opinion to his colleagues, then as though I were\r\ninforming the ignorant, till at last I addressed them without any\r\nconcealment as men who had sold themselves and were the most impious of\r\nmankind. {157} And the man who contradicted me openly and opposed\r\neverything which I urged and which your decree enjoined, was Aeschines.\r\nWhether his conduct pleased all the other ambassadors as well, you will\r\nknow presently; for as yet I allege nothing about any of them, and make\r\nno accusation: no one of them need appear an honest man to-day because\r\nI oblige him to do so, but only of his own free will, and because he\r\nwas no partner in Aeschines' crimes. That the conduct in question was\r\ndisgraceful, atrocious, venal, you have all seen. Who were the partners\r\nin it, the facts will show.\r\n\r\n{158} 'But of course, during this interval they received the oaths from\r\nPhilip's allies, or carried out their other duties.' Far from it! For\r\nthough they had been absent from home three whole months, and received\r\n1,000 drachmae from you for their expenses, they did not receive the\r\noaths from a single city, either on their journey to Macedonia, or on\r\nthe way back. It was in the inn before the temple of the Dioscuri--any\r\none who has been to Pherae will understand me--when Philip was already\r\non the march towards Athens at the head of an army, that the oaths were\r\ntaken, in a fashion which was disgraceful, men of Athens, and insulting\r\nto you. {159} To Philip, however, it was worth anything that the\r\ntransaction should have been carried out in this form. These men had\r\nfailed in their attempt to insert among the terms of the Peace the\r\nclause which excluded the people of Halus and Pharsalus; Philocrates\r\nhad been forced by you to expunge the words, and to write down\r\nexpressly 'the Athenians and the allies of the Athenians'; and Philip\r\ndid not wish any of his own allies to have taken such an oath; for then\r\nthey would not join him in his campaign against those possessions of\r\nyours which he now holds, but would plead their oaths in excuse; {160}\r\nnor did he wish them to be witnesses of the promises on the strength of\r\nwhich he was obtaining the Peace. He did not wish it to be revealed to\r\nthe world that the city of Athens had not, after all, been defeated in\r\nthe war, and that it was Philip who was eager for peace, and was\r\npromising to do great things for Athens if he obtained it. It was just\r\nto prevent the revelation of these facts that he thought it inadvisable\r\nthat the ambassadors should go to any of the cities; while for their\r\npart, they sought to gratify him in everything, with ostentatious and\r\nextravagant obsequiousness. {161} But when all this is proved against\r\nthem--their waste of time, their sacrifice of your position in Thrace,\r\ntheir complete failure to act in accordance either with your decree or\r\nyour interests, their lying report to you--how is it possible that\r\nbefore a jury of sane men, anxious to be true to their oath, Aeschines\r\ncan be acquitted? To prove, however, that what I say is true (_to the\r\nclerk_), first read the decree, under which it was our duty to exact\r\nthe oaths, then Philip's letter, and then the decree of Philocrates and\r\nthat of the people.\r\n\r\n[_The decrees and letter are read._]\r\n\r\n{162} And now, to prove that we should have caught Philip in the\r\nHellespont, had any one listened to me, and carried out your\r\ninstructions as contained in the decrees, (_to the clerk_) call the\r\nwitnesses who were there on the spot.\r\n\r\n[_The witnesses are called._]\r\n\r\n(_To the clerk._) Next read also the other deposition--Philip's answer\r\nto Eucleides,[n] who is present here, when he went to Philip afterwards.\r\n\r\n[_The deposition is read._]\r\n\r\n{163} Now listen to me, while I show that they cannot even deny that it\r\nwas to serve Philip's interest that they acted as they did. For when we\r\nset out on the First Embassy--that which was to discuss the Peace--you\r\ndispatched a herald in advance to procure us a safe conduct. Well, on\r\nthat occasion, as soon as ever they had reached Oreus, they did not\r\nwait for the herald, or allow any time to be lost; but though Halus was\r\nbeing besieged, they sailed there direct, and then, leaving the town\r\nagain, came to Parmenio, who was besieging it, set out through the\r\nenemy's camp to Pagasae, and, continuing their journey, only met the\r\nherald at Larissa: with such eager haste did they proceed. {164} But at\r\na time when there was peace and they had complete security for their\r\njourney and you had instructed them to make haste, it never occurred to\r\nthem either to quicken their pace or to go by sea. And why? Because on\r\nthe former occasion Philip's interest demanded that the Peace should be\r\nmade as soon as possible; whereas now it required that as long an\r\ninterval as possible should be wasted before the oaths were taken.\r\n{165} To prove that this is so, (_to the clerk_) take and read this\r\nfurther deposition.\r\n\r\n[_The deposition is read._]\r\n\r\nHow could men be more clearly convicted of acting to serve Philip's\r\ninterest throughout, than by the fact that they sat idle, when in your\r\ninterest they ought to have hurried, on the very same journey over\r\nwhich they hastened onward, without even waiting for the herald, when\r\nthey ought not to have moved at all?\r\n\r\n{166} Now observe how each of us chose to conduct himself while we were\r\nthere, sitting idle at Pella. For myself, I chose to rescue and seek\r\nout the captives, spending my own money and asking Philip to procure\r\ntheir ransom[n] with the sums which he was offering us in the form of\r\npresents. How Aeschines passed his whole time you shall hear presently.\r\n{167} What then was the meaning of Philip's offering money to us in\r\ncommon? He kept sounding us all--for this too I would have you know.\r\nAnd how? He sent round privately to each of us, and offered us, men of\r\nAthens, a very large sum in gold. But when he failed in a particular\r\ncase (for I need not mention my own name myself, since the proceedings\r\nand their results will of themselves show to whom I refer), he thought\r\nthat we should all be innocent enough to accept what was given to us in\r\ncommon; and then, if we all alike had a share, however small, in the\r\ncommon present, those who had sold themselves privately would be\r\nsecure. {168} Hence these offers, under the guise of presents to his\r\nguest-friends. And when I prevented this, my colleagues further divided\r\namong themselves the sum thus offered. But when I asked Philip to spend\r\nthis sum on the prisoners, he could neither, without discredit,\r\ndenounce my colleagues, and say, 'But So-and-so has the money, and\r\nSo-and-so,' nor yet evade the expense. So he gave the promise, but\r\ndeferred its fulfilment, saying that he would send the prisoners home\r\nin time for the Panathenaea. (_To the clerk._) Read the evidence of\r\nApollophanes, and then that of the rest of those present.\r\n\r\n[_The evidence is read._]\r\n\r\n{169} Now let me tell you how many of the prisoners I myself ransomed.\r\nFor while we were sitting waiting there at Pella, before Philip's\r\narrival, some of the captives--all, in fact, who were out on bail--not\r\ntrusting, I suppose, my ability to persuade Philip to act as I wished,\r\nsaid that they wished to ransom themselves, and to be under no\r\nobligation to Philip for their freedom: and they borrowed, one three\r\nminae, another five, and another--whatever the amount of the ransom was\r\nin each case. {170} But when Philip had promised that he would ransom\r\nthe rest, I called together those to whom I had advanced the money; I\r\nreminded them of the circumstances; and, lest they should seem to have\r\nsuffered by their impatience, and to have been ransomed at their own\r\ncost, poor men as they were, when all their comrades expected to be set\r\nfree by Philip, I made them a present of their ransom. To prove that I\r\nam speaking the truth, (_to the clerk_) read these depositions.\r\n\r\n[_The depositions are read._]\r\n\r\n{171} These, then, are the sums which I excused them, and gave as a\r\nfree gift to fellow citizens who had met with misfortune. And so, when\r\nAeschines says presently, in his speech to you, 'Demosthenes, if, as\r\nyou say, you knew, from the time when I supported Philocrates'\r\nproposal, that we were acting altogether dishonestly, why did you go\r\nagain as our colleague on the subsequent mission to take the oaths,\r\ninstead of entering a sworn excuse?' remember this, that I had promised\r\nthose whose freedom I had procured that I would bring them their\r\nransom, and deliver them to the best of my power. {172} It would have\r\nbeen a wicked thing to break my word and abandon my fellow citizens in\r\ntheir misfortune; while, on the other hand, if I had excused myself\r\nupon oath from service, it would not have been altogether honourable,\r\nnor yet safe, to make a tour there in a private capacity. For let\r\ndestruction, utter and early, fall upon me, if I would have joined in a\r\nmission with these men for a very large sum of money, had it not been\r\nfor my anxiety to rescue the prisoners. It is a proof of this, that\r\nthough you twice elected me to serve on the Third Embassy, I twice\r\nswore an excuse. And all through the journey in question my policy was\r\nentirely opposed to theirs. {173} All, then, that it was within my own\r\npower to decide in the course of my mission resulted as I have\r\ndescribed; but wherever in virtue of their majority they gained their\r\nway, all has been lost. And yet, had there been any who listened to me,\r\nall would have been accomplished in a manner congruous with my own\r\nactions. For I was not so pitiful a fool as to give away money, when I\r\nsaw others receiving it, in my ambition to serve you, and yet not to\r\ndesire what could have been accomplished without expense, and would\r\nhave brought far greater benefits to the whole city. I desired it\r\nintensely, men of Athens; but, of course, they had the advantage over\r\nme.\r\n\r\n{174} Come now and contemplate the proceedings of Aeschines and those\r\nof Philocrates, by the side of my own; for the comparison will bring\r\nout their character more vividly. Well, they first pronounced the\r\nexclusion from the Peace of the Phocians and the people of Halus, and\r\nof Cersobleptes, contrary to your decree and to the statements made to\r\nyou. Then they attempted to tamper with and alter the decree, which we\r\nhad come there as ambassadors to execute. Then they entered the\r\nCardians as allies of Philip and voted against sending the dispatch\r\nwhich I had written to you, sending in its stead an utterly unsound\r\ndispatch of their own composition. {175} And then the gallant gentleman\r\nasserted that I had promised Philip that I would overthrow your\r\nconstitution, because I censured these proceedings, not only from a\r\nsense of their disgracefulness, but also from fear lest through the\r\nfault of these men I might have to share their ruin: while all the time\r\nhe was himself having incessant private interviews with Philip. And, to\r\npass over all besides, Dercylus (not I) watched him through the night\r\nat Pherae, along with my slave who is here present; and as the slave\r\ncame out of Philip's tent he took him and bade him report what he had\r\nseen, and remember it himself; and finally, this disgusting and\r\nshameless fellow was left behind with Philip for a night and a day,\r\nwhen we went away. {176} And to prove that I am speaking the truth, I\r\nwill myself give evidence which I have committed to writing,[n] so as\r\nto put myself in the position of a responsible witness; and after that\r\nI call upon each of the other ambassadors, and I will compel them to\r\nchoose their alternative--either to give evidence, or to swear that\r\nthey have no knowledge of the matter. If they take the latter course, I\r\nshall convict them of perjury beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n[_Evidence is read._]\r\n\r\n{177} You have seen now by what mischief and trouble I was hampered,\r\nthroughout our absence from home. For what must you imagine their\r\nconduct to have been there, with their paymaster close at hand, when\r\nthey act as they do before your very eyes, though you have power either\r\nto confer honour or, on the other hand, to inflict punishment upon them?\r\n\r\nI wish now to reckon up from the beginning the charges which I have\r\nmade, in order to show you that I have done all that I undertook to do\r\nat the beginning of my speech. {178} I have proved that there was no\r\ntruth in his report--that, on the contrary, he deceived you--by the\r\nevidence not of words but of the actual course of events. I have proved\r\nthat he was the cause of your unwillingness to hear the truth from my\r\nmouth, captivated as you were at the time by his promises and\r\nundertakings; that he gave you advice which was the exact opposite of\r\nthat which he ought to have given, opposing the Peace which was\r\nsuggested by the allies, and advocating the Peace of Philocrates; that\r\nhe wasted time, in order that you might not be able to march to the aid\r\nof the Phocians, even if you wished to do so; and that he has done many\r\natrocious deeds during his absence from home; for he has betrayed and\r\nsold everything, he has taken bribes, and has left no form of rascality\r\nuntried. These are the points which I promised at the outset to prove,\r\nand I have proved them. {179} Observe, then, what follows; for what I\r\nhave now to say to you has already become a simple matter. You have\r\nsworn that you will vote according to the laws and the decrees of the\r\npeople and the Council of Five Hundred. The defendant is proved, in all\r\nhis conduct as ambassador, to have acted in contravention of the laws,\r\nof the decrees, and of justice. He ought, therefore, to be convicted in\r\nany court composed of rational men. Even if there were no other crimes\r\nat his door, two of his actions are sufficient to slay him; for he\r\nbetrayed to Philip not only the Phocians but also Thrace. {180} Two\r\nplaces in the whole world of greater value to Athens than Thermopylae\r\non land, and the Hellespont over sea, could not possibly be found; and\r\nboth these places these men have shamefully sold, and placed in\r\nPhilip's hands to be used against you. The enormity of this crime\r\nalone--the sacrifice of Thrace and the Walls--apart from all the rest,\r\nmight be proved in countless ways,[n] and it is easy to point out how\r\nmany men have been executed or fined vast sums of money by you for such\r\noffences--Ergophilus,[n] Cephisodotus,[n] Timomachus,[n] Ergocles[n]\r\nlong ago, Dionysius, and others; all of whom together, I may almost\r\nsay, have done the city less harm than the defendant. {181} But in\r\nthose days, men of Athens, you still guarded against danger by\r\ncalculation and forethought; whereas now you overlook any danger which\r\ndoes not annoy you from day to day, or cause you pain by its immediate\r\npresence, and then pass such resolutions here as 'that Philip shall\r\ntake the oath in favour of Cersobleptes also,' 'that we will not take\r\npart in the proceedings of the Amphictyons,' 'that we must amend the\r\nPeace.' But none of these resolutions would have been required, had\r\nAeschines then been ready to sail and to do what was required. As it\r\nis, by urging us to go by land, he has lost all that we could have\r\nsaved by sailing; and by lying, all that could have been saved by\r\nspeaking the truth.\r\n\r\n{182} He intends, I am told, to express immediately his indignation\r\nthat he alone of all the speakers in the Assembly should have to render\r\nan account of his words. I will not urge that all speakers would\r\nreasonably be called upon to render such an account, if any of their\r\nwords were spoken for money; I only say this. If Aeschines in his\r\nprivate capacity has spoken wildly on some occasion or committed some\r\nblunder, do not be over-strict with him, but let it pass and grant him\r\npardon: but if as your ambassador he has deliberately deceived you for\r\nmoney, then do not let him go, or tolerate the plea that he ought not\r\nto be called to account for what he _said_. {183} Why, for what, if not\r\nfor his words, is an ambassador to be brought to justice? Ambassadors\r\nhave no control over ships or places or soldiers or citadels--no one\r\nputs such things in their hands--but over words and times. As regards\r\ntimes, if he did not cause the times of the city's opportunities to be\r\nlost, he is not guilty; but if he did so, he has committed crime. And\r\nas to his words, if the words of his report were true or expedient, let\r\nhim escape; but if they were at once false, venal, and disastrous, let\r\nhim be convicted. {184} No greater wrong can a man do you, than is done\r\nby lying speeches. For where government is based upon speeches, how can\r\nit be carried on in security, if the speeches are not true? and if, in\r\nparticular, a speaker takes bribes and speaks to further the interests\r\nof the enemy, how can you escape real danger? For to rob you of your\r\nopportunities is not the same thing as to rob an oligarchy or a tyrant.\r\nFar from it. {185} Under such governments, I imagine, everything is\r\ndone promptly at a word of command. But with you the Council must first\r\nhear about everything, and pass its preliminary resolution--and even\r\nthat not at any time, but only when notice has been given of the\r\nreception of heralds and embassies: then you must convoke an Assembly,\r\nand that only when the time comes for one, as ordained by law: then\r\nthose who speak for your true good have to master and overcome those\r\nwho, through ignorance or wickedness, oppose them. {186} Besides all\r\nthis, even when a measure is resolved upon, and its advantages are\r\nalready plain, time must be granted to the impecuniosity of the\r\nmajority, in which they may procure whatever means they require in\r\norder to be able to carry out what has been resolved. And so he who\r\ncauses times so critical to be lost, in a state constituted as ours is,\r\nhas not caused you to lose times, but has robbed you absolutely of the\r\nrealization of your aims.\r\n\r\n{187} Now all those who are anxious to deceive you are very ready with\r\nsuch expressions as 'disturbers of the city,' 'men who prevent Philip\r\nfrom conferring benefits on the city.' In reply to these, I will use no\r\nargument, but will read you Philip's letters, and will remind you of\r\nthe occasion on which each piece of deception took place, that you may\r\nknow that Philip has got beyond this exaggerated title of\r\n'benefactor',[n] of which we are so sickened, in his attempts to take\r\nyou in by it.\r\n\r\n[_Philip's letters are read._]\r\n\r\n{188} Now although his work as ambassador has been so shameful, so\r\ndetrimental to you in many--nay, in all points, he goes about asking\r\npeople what they think of Demosthenes, who prosecutes his own\r\ncolleagues. I prosecute you indeed, whether I would or no, because\r\nthroughout our entire absence from home you plotted against me as I\r\nhave said, and because now I have the choice of only two alternatives:\r\neither I must appear to share with you the responsibility for such work\r\nas yours, or I must prosecute you. {189} Nay, I deny that I was ever\r\nyour colleague in the Embassy. I say that your work as ambassador was\r\nan atrocious work, while my own was for the true good of those present\r\nhere. It is Philocrates that has been your colleague, as you have been\r\nhis, and Phrynon. For your policy was the same as theirs, and you all\r\napproved of the same objects. But 'where are the salt, the table, the\r\nlibations that we shared?' So he asks everywhere in his theatrical\r\nstyle--as though it were not the criminals, but the upright, that were\r\nfalse to such pledges! {190} I am certain that though all the Prytanes\r\noffer their common sacrifice on each occasion, and join one with\r\nanother in their meal and their libation, the good do not on this\r\naccount copy the bad; but if they detect one of their own number in\r\ncrime they report the fact to the Council and the people. In the very\r\nsame way the Council offers its inaugural sacrifice and feasts\r\ntogether, and joins in libations and sacred rites. So do the generals,\r\nand, one may practically say, every body of magistrates. Does that mean\r\nthat they grant an indemnity to any of their number who is guilty of\r\ncrime? Very far from it. {191} Leon accuses Timagoras,[n] after being\r\nhis fellow ambassador for four years: Eubulus accuses Tharrex and\r\nSmicythus, after sharing the banquet with them: the great Conon, the\r\nelder, prosecuted Adeimantus,[n] though they were generals together.\r\nWhich sinned against the salt and the libation, Aeschines--the traitors\r\nand the faithless ambassadors and the hirelings, or their accusers?\r\nPlainly those who violated, as you have done, the sanctity, not of\r\nprivate libations, but of libations poured in the name of the whole\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n{192} That you may realize that these men have been the most worthless\r\nand wicked not only of all who have ever gone to Philip in a public\r\ncapacity, but even of those who have gone as private persons, and\r\nindeed of all mankind, I ask you to listen to me while I describe\r\nbriefly an incident which falls outside the story of this Embassy. When\r\nPhilip took Olynthus he celebrated Olympian games, and gathered\r\ntogether all the artists to the sacrifice and the festal gathering.\r\n{193} And while he was entertaining them at a banquet, and crowning the\r\nvictors, he asked Satyrus, the well-known comic actor, why he alone\r\nrequested no favour of him. Did he see any meanness in him, or any\r\ndislike towards himself? Satyrus answered (so the story goes) that he\r\nhappened to stand in no need of the things for which the rest were\r\nasking, but that the boon which he would like to ask was a favour which\r\nit would be very easy indeed for Philip to bestow; only he was afraid\r\nthat he might fail to obtain it. {194} Philip bade him name his\r\nrequest, declaring with some spirit that there was nothing that he\r\nwould not do for him. Satyrus is then said to have stated that\r\nApollophanes of Pydna was formerly his friend and guest-friend,[n] and\r\nthat when he had perished by a treacherous assassination, his kinsman\r\nhad, in alarm, conveyed his daughters, then little children, to\r\nOlynthus secretly. 'These girls,' said Satyrus, 'have been taken\r\nprisoners at the capture of the city; they are with you, and they are\r\nnow of marriageable age. {195} It is these girls that I beg and entreat\r\nyou to give to me. But I should like you to hear and understand what\r\nsort of present you will be giving me, if you really give it. I shall\r\ngain nothing by receiving it: I shall give them in marriage, and a\r\ndowry with them, and shall not allow them to suffer anything unworthy\r\nof us or of their father.' When those who were present at the feast\r\nheard this, there was such applause and cheering and approbation on all\r\nhands, that Philip was moved and granted the request, although the\r\nApollophanes who was spoken of was one of the murderers of Alexander,\r\nPhilip's brother. {196} Now let us examine side by side with this\r\nbanquet of Satyrus, that in which these men took part in Macedonia.\r\nObserve what likeness and resemblance there is between the two! For\r\nthese men were invited to the house of Xenophron, the son of Phaedimus,\r\nwho was one of the Thirty,[n] and went. I did not go. But when it came\r\nto the time for wine, he brought in an Olynthian woman--good-looking,\r\nbut well-bred and modest, as the event proved. {197} At first, I\r\nbelieve (according to the account which Iatrocles gave me the next\r\nday), they only forced her to drink a little wine quietly and to eat\r\nsome dessert; but as the feast proceeded and they waxed warm, they bade\r\nher recline and even sing a song. And when the poor creature, who was\r\nin great distress, neither would nor could do as they bade her,\r\nAeschines and Phrynon declared that it was an insult and quite\r\nintolerable, that a captive woman--one of those god-forsaken devils the\r\nOlynthians--should give herself airs. 'Call a slave,' they cried, 'and\r\nlet some one bring a strap.' A servant came with a lash; they had been\r\ndrinking, I imagine, and were easily annoyed; and as soon as she said\r\nsomething and burst into tears, the servant tore open her dress and\r\ngave her a number of cuts across the back. {198} Beside herself with\r\nthe pain and the sense of her position, the woman leaped up and fell\r\nbefore the knees of Iatrocles, overturning the table as she did so. And\r\nhad he not rescued her, she would have perished as the victim of a\r\ndrunken debauch; for the drunkenness of this abominable creature is\r\nsomething horrible.[n] The case of this woman was also mentioned in\r\nArcadia before the Ten Thousand, and Diophantus reported to you what I\r\nshall now force him to testify; for the matter was much talked of in\r\nThessaly and everywhere.\r\n\r\n{199} Yet with all this on his conscience this unclean creature will\r\ndare to look you in the face, and will very soon be speaking to you of\r\nthe life he has lived, in that magnificent voice of his. It chokes me\r\nto hear him! Does not the jury know how at first you used to read over\r\nthe books to your mother at her initiations,[n] and wallow amid bands\r\nof drunken men at their orgies, while still a boy? {200} and how you\r\nwere afterwards under-clerk to the magistrates, and played the rogue\r\nfor two or three drachmae?[n] and how at last, in recent days, you\r\nthought yourself lucky to get a parasitic living in the training-rooms\r\nof others, as a third-rate actor? What then is the life of which you\r\npropose to speak? Where have you lived it? For the life which you have\r\nreally lived has been what I have described. And how much does he take\r\nupon himself! He brought another man to trial here for unnatural\r\noffences! But I leave this point for the moment. (_To the clerk._)\r\nFirst, read me these depositions.\r\n\r\n[_The depositions are read._]\r\n\r\n{201} So many, then, and so gross, gentlemen of the jury, being the\r\ncrimes against you of which he stands convicted--and what wickedness do\r\nthey not include? he is corrupt, he is a minion, he is under the curse,\r\na liar, a betrayer of his own people; all the most heinous offences are\r\nthere--he will not defend himself against a single one of these\r\ncharges, and will have no defence to offer that is either just or\r\nstraightforward. But the statement which, I am told, he intends to\r\nmake, borders on madness; though perhaps a man who has no other plea to\r\noffer must contrive anything that he can. {202} For I hear that he is\r\nto say that I, forsooth, have been a partner in everything of which I\r\naccuse him; that at first I used to approve of his policy and to act\r\nwith him; and that I have suddenly changed my mind and become his\r\naccuser. As a defence of his conduct such assertions are, of course,\r\nneither legitimate nor to the point, though they do imply some kind of\r\ncharge against myself; for, of course, if I have acted thus, I am a\r\nworthless person. But the conduct itself is no better for that. Far\r\nfrom it! {203} At the same time, I think it is proper for me to prove\r\nto you both the points in question--first, that if he makes such an\r\nassertion he will be lying; and secondly, what is the just line of\r\ndefence. Now a just and straightforward defence must show either that\r\nthe acts charged against him were not committed, or that having been\r\ncommitted, they are to the advantage of the city. {204} But Aeschines\r\ncannot do either of these things. For I presume that it is not possible\r\nfor him to say that it is to the advantage of the city that the\r\nPhocians have been ruined, that Thermopylae is in Philip's hands, that\r\nThebes is powerful, that there are soldiers in Euboea and plotting\r\nagainst Megara, and that the Peace should not have been sworn to,[n]\r\nwhen on the former occasion he announced the very contrary of all these\r\nthings to you in the guise of advantages, and advantages about to be\r\nrealized? Nor will he be able to persuade you that these things have\r\nnot been done, when you yourselves have seen them and know the facts\r\nwell. {205} It remains for me, therefore, to show you that I have had\r\nno share in any of their proceedings. Shall I then dismiss everything\r\nelse from consideration--all that I have said against them in your\r\npresence, all my collisions with them during our absence, all my\r\nantagonism to them from first to last--and produce my opponents\r\nthemselves as witnesses to the fact that my conduct and theirs have\r\nbeen absolutely contrary the one to the other--that they have taken\r\nmoney to your detriment, and that I refused to receive it? Then mark\r\nwhat I say.\r\n\r\n{206} Who, would you say, was of all men in Athens the most offensive,\r\nmost overflowing with effrontery and contemptuousness? I am sure that\r\nnone of you, even by mistake, would name any other than Philocrates.\r\nAnd who, would you say, possessed the loudest voice and could enunciate\r\nwhatever he pleased most clearly? Aeschines the defendant, I am sure.\r\nWho is it then that these men describe as cowardly and timid before a\r\ncrowd, while I call him cautious? It is myself; for I have never\r\nannoyed you or forced myself upon you against your will. {207} Now at\r\nevery meeting of the Assembly, as often as a discussion has arisen upon\r\nthese subjects, you hear me accusing and convicting these men,\r\ndeclaring explicitly that they have taken money and have sold all the\r\ninterests of the city. And not one of them has ever to this day\r\ncontradicted the statement, when he heard it, or opened his mouth, or\r\nshown himself. {208} What then is the reason, why the most offensive\r\nmen in the city, the men with the loudest voices, are so cowed before\r\nme, the timidest of men, whose voice is no louder than any other? It is\r\nbecause Truth is strong; while to them, on the other hand, the\r\nconsciousness of having sold public interests is a source of weakness.\r\nIt is this that steals away the boldness of these men, this that binds\r\ndown their tongues and stops their mouths--chokes them, and makes them\r\nsilent. {209} You remember, of course, how at the recent meeting in the\r\nPeiraeus, when you would not have him for your representative,[n] he\r\nwas shouting that he would impeach me and indict me, and crying, 'Oh!\r\nOh!' But such steps are the beginning of long and numerous trials and\r\nspeeches; whereas the alternative was but to utter perhaps two or three\r\nwords, which even a slave purchased yesterday could have\r\npronounced--'Men of Athens, this is utterly atrocious. Demosthenes is\r\naccusing me here of crimes in which he himself was a partner; he says\r\nthat I have taken money, when he has taken money, or shared it,\r\nhimself.' {210} But no such words, no such sound, did he utter, nor did\r\none of you hear him do so; he only uttered threats to a different\r\neffect. And why? Because he knew that he had done what he was charged\r\nwith doing; he was abjectly afraid to use any such expressions; his\r\nresolution could not rise to them, but shrank back; for it was in the\r\ngrip of his conscience; whereas there was nothing to hinder him from\r\nuttering irrelevant abuse and slander. {211} But here is the strongest\r\nproof of all, and it consists not in words, but in fact. For when I was\r\nanxious to do what it was right to do, namely, to make a second report\r\nto you, after serving a second time as ambassador, Aeschines came\r\nbefore the Board of Auditors with a number of witnesses, and forbade\r\nthem to call me before the court, since I had rendered my account\r\nalready, and was no longer liable to give it. The incident was\r\nextremely ridiculous. And what was the meaning of it? He had made his\r\nreport with reference to the First Embassy, against which no one\r\nbrought any charge, and did not wish to go before the court again with\r\nregard to the Second Embassy, with reference to which he now appears\r\nbefore you, and within which all his crimes fell. {212} But if I came\r\nbefore you twice, it became necessary for him also to appear again; and\r\nso he tried to prevent them from summoning me. But this action of his,\r\nmen of Athens, plainly proves to you two things--first, that he had so\r\ncondemned himself that none of you can now acquit him without impiety;\r\nand secondly, that he will not speak a word of truth about me. Had he\r\nanything true to assert, he would have been found asserting it and\r\naccusing me then; he would certainly not have tried to prevent my being\r\nsummoned. {213} To prove the truth of what I say, (_to the clerk_) call\r\nme the witnesses to the facts.\r\n\r\nBut further, if he makes slanderous statements against me which have\r\nnothing to do with the Embassy, there are many good reasons for your\r\nrefusing to listen to him. For I am not on my trial to-day, and when I\r\nhave finished my speech I have no further time allotted to me.[n] What\r\ncan such statements mean, except that he is bankrupt of legitimate\r\narguments? For who that was on his trial and had any defence to make,\r\nwould prefer to accuse another? {214} And consider also this further\r\npoint, gentlemen of the jury. If I were on my trial, with the defendant\r\nAeschines for accuser and Philip for judge; and if, being unable to\r\ndisprove my guilt, I abused Aeschines and tried to sully his character,\r\ndo you not think that Philip would be indignant at the very fact of a\r\nman abusing _his_ benefactors in his own presence? Do not _you_ then\r\nprove worse than Philip; but force Aeschines to defend himself against\r\nthe charges which are the subject of the trial. (_To the clerk._) Read\r\nthe deposition.\r\n\r\n[_The deposition is read._]\r\n\r\n{215} So for my part, because I had nothing on my conscience, I felt it\r\nmy duty to render an account and submit all the information that the\r\nlaws required, while the defendant took the opposite view. How then can\r\nhis conduct and mine have been the same? or how can he possibly assert\r\nagainst me now things of which he has never even accused me before? It\r\nis surely impossible. And yet he will assert these things, and, Heaven\r\nknows, it is natural enough. For you doubtless know well that ever\r\nsince the human race began and trials were instituted, no one was ever\r\nconvicted admitting his crime: they brazen it out, they deny it, they\r\nlie, they make up excuses, they take every means to escape paying the\r\npenalty. {216} _You_ must not let any of these devices mislead you\r\nto-day; your judgement must be given upon the facts, in the light of\r\nyour own knowledge; you must not attend to words, whether mine or his,\r\nstill less to the witnesses whom he will have ready to testify\r\nanything, since he has Philip to pay his expenses--you will see how\r\nglibly they will give evidence for him; nor must you care whether his\r\nvoice is fine and loud, or whether mine is poor. {217} For it is no\r\ntrial of orators or of speeches that you have to hold to-day, if you\r\nare wise men. You have rather, in the name of a cause shamefully and\r\nterribly ruined, to thrust off the present disgrace on to the shoulders\r\nof the guilty, after a scrutiny of those results which are known to you\r\nall. {218} And these results, which you know and do not require us to\r\ntell you of--what are they? If the consequences of the Peace have been\r\nall that they promised you; if you admit that you were so filled with\r\nan unmanly cowardice, that, though the enemy was not in your land,\r\nthough you were not blockaded by sea, though your city was menaced by\r\nno other danger whatever, though, on the contrary, the price of corn\r\nwas low and you were in other respects as well off as you are to-day,\r\n{219} though you knew beforehand on the information of these men that\r\nyour allies were about to be ruined and Thebes to become powerful, that\r\nPhilip was about to occupy the Thracian strongholds and to establish a\r\nbasis of operations against you in Euboea, and that all that has now\r\nhappened was about to come to pass, you nevertheless made peace\r\ncheerfully;--if that is so, then acquit Aeschines, and do not add\r\nperjury to all your disgrace. For in that case he is guilty of no crime\r\nagainst you; it is I that am mad and brainsick to accuse him now. {220}\r\nBut if what they told you was altogether the reverse of this, if it was\r\na tale of great generosity--of Philip's love for Athens, of his\r\nintention to save the Phocians, to check the insolence of the Thebans,\r\nand beside all this (if he obtained the Peace) to confer on you\r\nbenefits that would more than compensate for Amphipolis, and to restore\r\nto you Euboea and Oropus; if, I say, they stated and promised all this,\r\nand have now totally deceived and cheated you, and have all but robbed\r\nyou of Attica itself, then condemn him, and do not, in addition to all\r\nthe outrages--I know not what other word to use--that you have\r\nsuffered, carry with you to your homes, through upholding their\r\ncorruption, the curse and the guilt of perjury.\r\n\r\n{221} Again, gentlemen of the jury, ask yourselves what reason I could\r\nhave had for choosing to accuse these men, if they had done no wrong?\r\nYou will find none. Is it pleasant to have many enemies? Pleasant? It\r\nis not even safe. Was there any quarrel between me and Aeschines? None.\r\nWhat then? 'You were afraid for yourself, and in your cowardice thought\r\nto save yourself this way:' for that, I have heard, is what he says.\r\nWhat? I was afraid, when, according to your own statement, there was\r\nnothing to be afraid of, and no crime had been committed? If he repeats\r\nsuch an assertion, men of Athens, consider[n] what these men\r\nthemselves, the actual criminals, ought to suffer for their offences,\r\nif I, who am absolutely guiltless, was afraid of being ruined owing to\r\nthem. {222} But what is my motive for accusing you? I am an informer,\r\nof course, and want to get money out of you![n] And which was the\r\neasier course for me--to get money out of Philip, who offered a large\r\nsum--to get as much as any of these men, and to have not only Philip\r\nfor my friend, but also my opponents (for they would assuredly have\r\nbeen friends, had I been partner with them, since even now they have no\r\ninherited quarrel against me, but only the fact that I refused to join\r\nin their actions); or to beg them for a share of their gains, and be\r\nregarded with hostility both by Philip and by them? Is it likely that\r\nwhen I was ransoming the prisoners at such cost to myself, I should ask\r\nto receive a paltry sum from these men, in a disgraceful manner and\r\nwith their enmity accompanying it? {223} Impossible! My report was\r\ntrue. I abstained from taking money for the sake of justice and truth\r\nand my own future. For I thought, as others among you have thought,\r\nthat my own uprightness would receive its reward, and that I must not\r\nbarter my ambition to stand well with you for gain of any kind. And I\r\nabhor these men, because I saw that they were vile and impious in the\r\nconduct of their mission, and because I have been robbed of the objects\r\nof my own ambition, owing to their corruption, now that you have come\r\nto be vexed with the Embassy as a whole. And it is because I foresee\r\nwhat must happen that I now accuse him, and appear to challenge his\r\nreport; for I would have it decided here, in a trial before a jury,\r\nthat my conduct has been the opposite of his. {224} And I am\r\nafraid--afraid, I say, for I will speak all my mind to you--that though\r\nwhen the time comes you may drag me in spite of my entire innocence to\r\nthe same ruin with them, you are now utterly supine. For, men of\r\nAthens, you appear to me to be altogether unstrung, waiting to suffer\r\nthe horrors which others are suffering before your eyes, and taking no\r\nprecautions, no thought for the city, which for so long has been\r\nexposed to destruction in many a dreadful form. {225} Is it not, think\r\nyou, dreadful and preternatural? For even where I had resolved upon\r\nsilence, I am driven to speak. You doubtless know Pythocles here, the\r\nson of Pythodorus. I had been on very kindly terms with him, and to\r\nthis day there has been no unpleasantness between us. He avoids me now,\r\nwhen he meets me--ever since he visited Philip--and if he is obliged to\r\nencounter me anywhere, he starts away immediately, lest any one should\r\nsee him talking with me. But with Aeschines he walks all round the\r\nmarketplace, discussing their plans. {226} Now is it not a terrible and\r\nshocking thing, men of Athens, that those who have made it their choice\r\nto foster Philip's interests should be able to rely upon so accurate a\r\ndiscrimination on Philip's part, that all that any one of them does\r\nhere can no more be hid from Philip (so they believe) than if he were\r\nstanding by their side, and that his friends and foes alike are those\r\nthat Philip chooses; while those whose life is lived for _your_ good,\r\nwho are greedy of honour at _your_ hands, and have not betrayed you,\r\nshould be met by such deafness, such blindness, on your part, that\r\nto-day I have to wrestle with these devils incarnate on equal terms,\r\nand that before you, who know the whole truth? {227} Would you know or\r\nhear the cause of these things? I will tell you, and I beg that none of\r\nyou be angry with me for speaking the truth. It is, I imagine, that\r\nPhilip has but one body and one soul, and it is with all his heart that\r\nhe cherishes those who do him good and detests those who do him evil:\r\nwhereas each of you, in the first place, has no feeling that the good\r\nor the evil which is being done to the city, is being done to himself;\r\n{228} other feelings are of more consequence, and often lead you\r\nastray--pity, envy, anger, favour towards the suppliant, and an\r\ninfinite number of other motives: while if a man has actually escaped\r\nall these, he will still not escape from those who do not want such a\r\nman to exist at all. And so the error due to each of these single\r\ncauses steals on little by little, till the state is exposed to the\r\nwhole accumulated mischief.\r\n\r\n{229} Do not fall victims to any such error to-day, men of Athens: do\r\nnot let the defendant go, when he has done you all this wrong. For\r\nhonestly, if you let him go, what will be said of you? 'Certain men,'\r\nit will be said, 'went as ambassadors to Philip yonder--Philocrates,\r\nAeschines, Phrynon, and Demosthenes; and, what happened? One of them\r\nnot only gained nothing by his mission, but ransomed the prisoners at\r\nhis private expense; another, with the money for which he sold the\r\ninterests of his country, went about purchasing harlots and fish. {230}\r\nOne of them, the abominable Phrynon, sent his son to Philip before he\r\nhad registered him as an adult; the other did nothing unworthy of\r\nhimself or his city. One, though serving as choregus and trierarch,[n]\r\nfelt it his duty voluntarily to incur that further expense [to ransom\r\nthe prisoners] rather than see any of his fellow citizens suffering\r\nmisfortune for want of means; the other, so far from rescuing any of\r\nthose who were already in captivity, joined in bringing a whole\r\ndistrict, and more than 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry with them,\r\nthe forces of the actual allies of his country, into captivity to\r\nPhilip. What followed? {231} When the Athenians got them into their\r\nhands (for they had long known the truth) what did they do? They let go\r\nthe men who had received bribes and had disgraced themselves, and their\r\ncity, and their children; they thought that these were wise men, and\r\nthat all was well[n] with the city; and as for their accuser, they\r\nthought him thunderstruck--a man who did not understand his country,\r\nand did not know where to fling his money away.' {232} And who, men of\r\nAthens, with this example before his eyes, will be willing to offer you\r\nhis honest service? who will act as ambassador for nothing, if he is\r\nnot only to gain nothing by it, but is not to be more trustworthy in\r\nyour eyes than those who have taken money? You are not only trying\r\nthese men to-day, but you are laying down a law for all future time--a\r\nlaw which will declare whether your ambassadors are to serve the enemy\r\nfor a price, or to act disinterestedly for your true good and to take\r\nno bribe? {233} On all the other points you require no evidence; but to\r\nprove that Phrynon sent his son, (_to the clerk_) call me the witnesses\r\nto the facts.\r\n\r\nAeschines then did not prosecute Phrynon, for sending his own son to\r\nPhilip for a disgraceful purpose. But because a man, who in his youth\r\nwas above the average in appearance, did not foresee the suspicion\r\nwhich his good looks might entail, and afterwards lived a somewhat fast\r\nlife, he has prosecuted him for unnatural offences.\r\n\r\n{234} Now let me speak of the banquet and the decree; for I had almost\r\noverlooked what I was especially bound to tell you. In drawing up the\r\nresolution of the Council with reference to the First Embassy, and\r\nagain in addressing the people, at the assemblies in which you were to\r\ndiscuss the question of peace, not a single word or act of a criminal\r\nnature on the part of these men having so far come to light, I followed\r\nthe ordinary custom, and proposed to accord them a vote of thanks, and\r\nto invite them to the Town Hall. {235} And I did, of course, entertain\r\nPhilip's ambassadors as well, and on a very splendid scale, men of\r\nAthens. For when I saw that in their own country they prided themselves\r\neven on things like these, as showing their prosperity and splendour, I\r\nthought that I must begin by outdoing them in this respect, and\r\ndisplaying even greater magnificence. These incidents Aeschines will\r\nshortly bring forward to prove that 'Demosthenes himself voted thanks\r\nto us, and gave a banquet to the ambassadors', without telling you the\r\nprecise time when the incidents occurred. {236} For these things belong\r\nto a time before any injury had been done to the city, and before it\r\nwas evident that they had sold themselves. The ambassadors had only\r\njust arrived on their first visit; the people had still to hear what\r\nthey proposed; and there was nothing as yet to show that Aeschines\r\nwould support Philocrates, or that Philocrates would make such\r\nproposals as he did. If, then, Aeschines uses any such argument,\r\nremember that the dates of the incidents are earlier than those of his\r\ncrimes. But since then there has been no friendliness between myself\r\nand them, and no common action. (_To the clerk._) Read the deposition.\r\n\r\n[_The deposition is read._]\r\n\r\n{237} Now perhaps his brother Philochares will support him, and\r\nAphobetus. There is much that you may fairly urge in reply to both; and\r\nI am obliged, men of Athens, to speak to you quite freely and without\r\nany reserve. You, Philochares, are a painter of vase-cases and drums;\r\nyour brothers are under-clerks and quite ordinary men--not that there\r\nis any harm in these things, but at the same time they do not qualify a\r\nman to be a general.[n] And yet, Aphobetus and Philochares, we thought\r\nyou worthy to be ambassadors and generals, and to receive the highest\r\nhonours; {238} so that even if none of you were guilty of any crime, we\r\nshould owe no gratitude to you; you would rather owe gratitude to us\r\nfor your preferment. For we passed by many others, more deserving of\r\nsuch honours than you were, and exalted you instead. But if in the\r\nenjoyment of these very honours one of you has actually committed\r\ncrimes, and crimes of such a nature, how much more deserving are you of\r\nexecration than of acquittal? Much more, I am sure. Perhaps they will\r\nforce their claims upon you, for they are loud-voiced and shameless,\r\nand they have taken to themselves the motto that 'it is pardonable for\r\nbrother to help brother'. {239} But you must not give way. Remember\r\nthat if it is right for them to think of Aeschines, it is for you to\r\nthink of the laws and the whole State, and, above all, of the oath\r\nwhich you yourselves, who sit here, have taken. Yes, and if they have\r\nentreated some of you to save the defendant, then ask yourselves\r\nwhether you are to save him if he is proved innocent of crime, or even\r\nif he is proved guilty. If they ask you to do so, should he be\r\ninnocent, I too say that you must acquit him. But if you are asked to\r\nacquit him, whatever he has done, then they have asked you to commit\r\nperjury. For though your vote is secret, it will not be hidden from the\r\ngods; and the framer of our law [which enjoins secret voting] was\r\nabsolutely right, when he saw that though none of these men will know\r\nwhich of you has granted his request, the gods will know, and the\r\nunseen powers, who has given the unjust vote. {240} And it is better\r\nfor a man to lay up, for his children and himself, those good hopes\r\nwhich _they_ can bestow, by giving the decision that is just and right,\r\nthan to win credit from these men for a favour of whose reality they\r\ncan have no certain knowledge, and to acquit the defendant, when his\r\nown testimony condemns him. For what stronger testimony can I produce,\r\nAeschines, to prove how terrible your work as ambassador has been, than\r\nyour own testimony against yourself? For when you thought it necessary\r\nto involve in so great and dreadful a calamity one who wished to reveal\r\nsome of your actions as ambassador, it is plain that you expected your\r\nown punishment to be a terrible one, if your countrymen learned what\r\nyou had done.\r\n\r\n{241} That step, if you are wise, he will prove to have taken to his\r\nown detriment; not only because it is an overwhelming proof of the\r\nnature of his conduct as ambassador, but also because of those\r\nexpressions which he used in the course of the prosecution, and which\r\nare now at our disposal against himself. For the principles of justice,\r\nas defined by you when you were prosecuting Timarchus, must, I presume,\r\nbe no less valid when used by others against yourself. {242} His words\r\nto the jury on that occasion were these. 'Demosthenes intends to defend\r\nTimarchus, and to denounce my acts as ambassador. And then, when he has\r\nled you off the point by his speech, he will brag of it, and go about\r\nsaying, \"Well? what do you think?[2] Why I led the jury right away from\r\nthe point, and stole the case triumphantly out of their hands.\"' Then\r\nyou at least must not act thus, but must make your defence with\r\nreference to the real points of your case, though, when you were\r\nprosecuting Timarchus on that occasion, you permitted yourself to make\r\nany charges and assertions that you chose.\r\n\r\n{243} But there were verses too, which you recited before the jury, in\r\nyour inability to produce any witness to the charges on which you were\r\nprosecuting Timarchus:--\r\n\r\n  Rumour, the voice of many folk, not all\r\n  Doth die, for Rumour too a goddess is.[3]\r\n\r\nWell, Aeschines, all those who are present say that you have made money\r\nout of your mission; and so it holds true against you, I suppose, that\r\n'Rumour, the voice of many folk, not all doth die'. {244} For observe\r\nhow easily you can ascertain how much larger a body of accusers appears\r\nin your case than in his. Timarchus was not known even to all his\r\nneighbors; while there is not a man, Hellene or foreigner, but says\r\nthat you and your fellow ambassadors made money out of your mission.\r\nAnd so, if the rumour is true, then the rumour which is the voice of\r\nmany folk is against you; and you have yourself laid down that such a\r\nrumour is to be believed, that 'Rumour too a goddess is', and that the\r\npoet who composed these lines was a wise man.\r\n\r\n{245} Then, you remember, he collected some iambic verses, and recited\r\nthe whole passage; for instance:--\r\n\r\n  Whoso in evil company delights\r\n  Of him I ne'er enquired, for well I trow,\r\n  As is his company, such is the man.[3]\r\n\r\nAnd 'when a man goes to the cockpit[n] and walks about with\r\nPittalacus'--he added more to the same effect--'surely,' said he, 'you\r\nknow what to think of him.' Well, Aeschines, these same verses will now\r\nexactly serve my turn against you, and if I quote them to the jury, the\r\nquotation will be true and apposite. 'But whoso in the company\r\ndelights' of Philocrates, and that when he is an ambassador, 'Of him I\r\nne'er enquired, for well I trow' that he has taken money, as did\r\nPhilocrates who does not deny it.\r\n\r\n{246} He attempts to insult others by labelling them hack-writers[n]\r\nand sophists. He shall himself be proved liable to these very\r\nimputations. The verses he quoted are derived from the _Phoenix_ of\r\nEuripides--a play which has never to this day been acted either by\r\nTheodorus or Aristodemus, the actors under whom Aeschines always played\r\nthird-rate parts, though it was performed by Molon, and no doubt by\r\nother actors of former times. But the _Antigone_ of Sophocles has often\r\nbeen acted by Theodorus and often by Aristodemus; and in this play\r\nthere are some admirable and instructive verses, which he must know\r\nquite well by heart, since he has often delivered them himself, but\r\nwhich he has omitted to quote. {247} For you know, I am sure, that in\r\nevery tragedy it is, as it were, the special privilege of third-rate\r\nactors to play in the rôle of tyrants and sceptred kings. Consider,\r\nthen, these excellent lines, placed by the poet in the mouth of our\r\nCreon-Aeschines in this play--lines which he neither repeated to\r\nhimself to guide him as an ambassador, nor yet quoted to the jury. (_To\r\nthe clerk._) Read the passage.\r\n\r\n  _Verses from the 'Antigone' of Sophocles._\r\n\r\n  To learn aright the soul and heart and mind\r\n  Of any man--for that, device is none,\r\n  Till he be proved in government and law,\r\n  And so revealed. For he who guides the State,\r\n  Yet cleaves not in his counsels to the best,\r\n  But from some fear in prison locks his tongue,\r\n  Is in mine eyes, as he hath ever been,\r\n  Vilest of men. And him, who sets his friend\r\n  Before his land, I count of no esteem.\r\n  For I--be it known to God's all-viewing eye--\r\n  Would ne'er keep silence, seeing the march of doom\r\n  Upon this city--doom in safety's stead,\r\n  Nor ever take to me as mine own friend\r\n  My country's foe.' For this I know, that she,\r\n  Our country, is the ship that bears us safe,\r\n  And safe aboard her, while she sails erect,\r\n  We make good friends.\r\n\r\n{248} None of these lines did Aeschines ever repeat to himself during\r\nhis mission. Instead of preferring his country he thought that to be\r\nfriend and guest-friend of Philip was much more important and\r\nprofitable for himself, and bade a long farewell to the wise Sophocles.\r\nHe saw the 'march of doom' draw near, in the campaign against the\r\nPhocians; but he gave no warning, no announcement of what was to come.\r\nOn the contrary, he helped to conceal it, he helped to carry out the\r\ndoom, he prevented those who would have given warning--{249} not\r\nremembering that 'Our country is the ship that bears us safe, and safe\r\naboard her' his mother with the help of her initiations and\r\npurifications and the property of the clients, on whom she lived,\r\nreared up these sons of hers to their destined greatness;[n] while his\r\nfather, who kept an elementary school, as I am told by my elders, near\r\nthe temple of the Hero-Physician,[n] made a living, such as he could\r\nindeed, but still on the same ship. The sons, who had received money as\r\nunder-clerks and servants in all the magistrates' offices, were finally\r\nelected clerks by you, and for two years continued to get their living\r\nin the Round Chamber;[n] and Aeschines was just now dispatched as your\r\nambassador--from this same ship. He regarded none of these things.\r\n{250} He took no care that the ship should sail erect. Nay, he capsized\r\nher; he sank the ship; he did all that he could to bring her into the\r\npower of the enemy. What then? Are you not a sophist? Aye, and a\r\nvillanous one. Are you not a hack? Aye, and one detested of Heaven--for\r\nyou passed over the scene which you had so often performed and knew\r\nwell by heart, while you sought out a scene which you had never acted\r\nin your life, and produced the passage in the hope of injuring one of\r\nyour fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n{251} And now examine his speech about Solon. He told us that the\r\nstatue of Solon, with his hand concealed in the drapery of his robe,\r\nwas erected as an illustration of the self-restraint of the orators of\r\nthat day. (This was in the course of a scurrilous attack upon the\r\nimpetuosity of Timarchus.) But the Salaminians tell us that this statue\r\nwas erected less than fifty years ago, whereas some two hundred and\r\nforty years have passed between the time of Solon and the present day;\r\nso that not only was the artist, who modelled him in this attitude, not\r\nliving in Solon's day, but even his grandfather was not. {252} That\r\nthen is what he told the jury, copying the attitude as he did so. But\r\nthat which it would have done his country far more good to see--the\r\nsoul and the mind of Solon--he did not copy. No, he did the very\r\nreverse. For when Salamis had revolted from Athens and the\r\ndeath-penalty had been decreed against any one who proposed to attempt\r\nits recovery, Solon, by singing, at the risk of his own life,[n] a lay\r\nwhich he had composed, won back the island for his country, and wiped\r\nout her disgrace: {253} while Aeschines, when the king and all the\r\nHellenes had decided that Amphipolis was yours, surrendered and sold\r\nit, and supported Philocrates, who proposed the resolution for this\r\npurpose. It is indeed worth his while (is it not?) to remember Solon!\r\nNor was he content with acting thus in Athens; for when he had gone to\r\nMacedonia, he did not even mention the name of the place which it was\r\nthe object of his mission to secure. This, in fact, he reported to you\r\nhimself, in words which doubtless you remember: 'I too had something to\r\nsay about Amphipolis; but in order that Demosthenes might have an\r\nopportunity of speaking upon the subject, I left it to him.' {254} Upon\r\nwhich I came forward and denied that Aeschines had left to me anything\r\nwhich he was anxious to say to Philip; he would rather have given any\r\none a share in his lifeblood than in his speech. The truth is, I\r\nimagine, that he had taken money; and as Philip had given him the money\r\nin order that he might not have to restore Amphipolis, he could not\r\nspeak in opposition to Philip's case. Now (_to the clerk_) take this\r\nlay of Solon's and read it; and (_to the jury_) then you will know how\r\nSolon used to hate all such men as this.\r\n\r\n{255} It is not when you are speaking, Aeschines, but when you are upon\r\nan embassy, that you should keep your hand within your robe. But on the\r\nEmbassy you held out your hand, and held it open; you brought shame to\r\nyour countrymen: and do you here assume a solemn air and recite in\r\nthose practised tones the miserable phrases that you have learned by\r\nheart, and expect to escape the penalty for all your heinous\r\ncrimes--even if you do go round with a cap on your head,[n] uttering\r\nabuse against me? (_To the clerk._) Read the verses.\r\n\r\n  _Solon's Lay._\r\n\r\n  The Father's voice hath spoken,\r\n    Whose word is Destiny,\r\n  And the blest Gods have willed it,\r\n    The Gods who shall not die;\r\n  That ne'er shall the Destroyer\r\n    Prevail against our land;\r\n  The Dread Sire's valiant Daughter\r\n    Guards us with eye and hand.\r\n  Yet her own sons, in folly,\r\n    Would lay their country low,\r\n  For pelf; and in her leaders\r\n    An heart of sin doth grow.\r\n  For them--their pride's fell offspring--\r\n    There waiteth grievous pain;\r\n  For sated still, they know not\r\n    Their proud lust to contain.\r\n  Not theirs, if mirth be with them,\r\n    The decent, peaceful feast;\r\n  To sin they yield, and sinning\r\n    Rejoice in wealth increased.\r\n  No hallowed treasure sparing,\r\n    Nor people's common store,\r\n  This side and that his neighbour\r\n    Each robs with havoc sore.\r\n  The holy law of Justice\r\n    They guard not. Silent she,\r\n  Who knows what is and hath been,\r\n    Awaits the time to be.\r\n  Then cometh she to judgement,\r\n    With certain step, tho' slow;\r\n  E'en now she smites the city,\r\n    And none may 'scape the blow.\r\n  To thraldom base she drives us,\r\n    From slumber rousing strife,--\r\n  Fell war of kin, destroying\r\n    The young, the beauteous life.\r\n  The foemen of their country\r\n    In wicked bands combine,\r\n  Fit company; and stricken\r\n    The lovely land doth pine.\r\n  These are the Wrong, the Mischief,\r\n    That pace the earth at home;\r\n  But many a beggared exile\r\n    To other lands must roam--\r\n  Sold, chained in bonds unseemly;\r\n    For so to each man's hall\r\n  Comes home the People's Sorrow,\r\n    And leaps the high fence-wall.\r\n  No courtyard door can stay it;\r\n    It follows to his side,\r\n  Flee tho' he may, and crouching\r\n    In inmost chamber hide.\r\n  Such warning unto Athens\r\n    My spirit bids me sound,\r\n  That Lawlessness in cities\r\n    Spreads evil all around;\r\n  But Lawfulness and Order\r\n    Make all things good and right,\r\n  Chaining Sin's hands in fetters,\r\n    Quenching the proud soul's light,\r\n  Smoothing the rough, the sated\r\n    Staying, and withering\r\n  The flowers, that, fraught with ruin,\r\n    From fatal seed upspring.\r\n  The paths of crooked justice\r\n    Are turned into straight;\r\n  The ways of Pride grow gentle,\r\n    The ways of Strife and Hate;\r\n  Then baleful Faction ceases,\r\n    Then Health prevails alway,\r\n  And Wisdom still increases,\r\n    Beneath Law's wholesome sway.\r\n\r\n{256} You hear, men of Athens, how Solon speaks of men like these, and\r\nof the gods, who, he says, preserve the city. It is my belief and my\r\nhope that this saying of his, that the gods preserve our city, is true\r\nat all times; but I believe that all that has happened in connexion\r\nwith the present examination is, in a sense, a special proof of the\r\ngoodwill of some unseen power towards the city. {257} Consider what has\r\nhappened. A man who as ambassador did a work of great wickedness, and\r\nhas surrendered countries in which the gods should have been worshipped\r\nby yourselves and your allies, has disfranchised one who accepted the\r\nchallenge[n] to prosecute him. To what end? To the end that he himself\r\nmight meet with no pity or mercy for his own iniquities. Nay, more;\r\nwhile prosecuting his victim he deliberately set himself to speak evil\r\nof me; and again, before the People, he threatened to enter an\r\nindictment against me, and said more to the same effect. And to what\r\nend? To the end that I, who had the most perfect knowledge of all his\r\nacts of villany, and had followed them closely throughout, might have\r\nyour full indulgence in prosecuting him. {258} Aye, and through\r\npostponing his appearance before you continually up to the present\r\nmoment, he has been insensibly brought to a time when, on account of\r\nwhat is coming upon us, if for no other reason, it is neither possible\r\nnor safe for you to allow him (after his corruption) to escape\r\nunscathed. For though, men of Athens, you ought always to execrate and\r\nto punish those who are traitors and corrupt, to do so at this time\r\nwould be more than ever seasonable, and would confer a benefit upon all\r\nmankind in common. {259} For a disease, men of Athens, an awful disease\r\nhas fallen upon Hellas--a disease hard to cope with, and requiring\r\nabundant good fortune, and abundant carefulness on your own part. For\r\nthe most notable men in their several cities, the men who claim[n] to\r\nlead in public affairs, are betraying their own liberty--unhappy\r\nmen!--and bringing upon themselves a self-chosen servitude, under the\r\nmilder names of friendship and companionship with Philip, and other\r\nsuch phrases; while the other citizens, and the sovereign bodies in\r\neach city, however composed, whose duty it was to punish these men and\r\nslay them out of hand, are so far from taking any such action, that\r\nthey admire and envy them, and every one would be glad to be in the\r\nsame case. {260} Yet it is from this very cause--it is through\r\nentertaining ambitions like these--that the Thessalians, who up to\r\nyesterday or the day before had lost thereby only their paramount\r\nposition[n] and their dignity as a state, are now already being\r\nstripped of their very liberty; for there are Macedonian garrisons in\r\nsome of their citadels. This same disease it is which has invaded the\r\nPeloponnese and brought about the massacres in Elis, infecting the\r\nunhappy people of that country with such insanity and frenzy, that in\r\norder to be lords over one another and to gratify Philip, they murder\r\ntheir kinsmen and fellow citizens. {261} Not even here has the disease\r\nbeen stayed: it has penetrated Arcadia and turned it upside-down; and\r\nnow many of the Arcadians, who should be no less proud of liberty than\r\nyourselves--for you and they alone are indigenous peoples--are\r\ndeclaring their admiration for Philip, erecting his image in bronze,\r\nand crowning him; and, to complete the tale, they have passed a\r\nresolution that, if he comes to the Peloponnese, they will receive him\r\nwithin their walls. {262} The Argives have acted in exactly the same\r\nway. These events, I say it in all solemnity and earnestness, call for\r\nno small precautions: for this plague, men of Athens, that is spreading\r\nall around us, has now found its way to Athens itself. While then we\r\nare still safe, ward it off, and take away the citizenship of those who\r\nfirst introduced it. Beware lest otherwise you realize the worth of the\r\nadvice given you this day, only when there is no longer anything that\r\nyou can do. {263} Do you not perceive, men of Athens, how vivid and\r\nplain an example has been afforded you by the unhappy Olynthians? The\r\ndestruction of those wretched men was due to nothing so much as to\r\nconduct like that of which I speak. You can test this clearly if you\r\nreview their history. {264} For at a time when they possessed only 400\r\ncavalry, and numbered not more than 5,000 men in all, since the\r\nChalcidians were not yet all united under one government, the Spartans\r\ncame against them with a large force, including both army and fleet\r\n(for you doubtless remember that at that period the Spartans were\r\nvirtually masters both of land and sea); and yet, though this great\r\nforce came against them, the Olynthians lost neither the city nor any\r\nsingle fortress, but won many battles, killed three of the enemy's\r\ncommanders, and finally concluded the war on their own terms.[n] {265}\r\nBut when some of them began to take bribes, and the people as a whole\r\nwere foolish enough, or rather unfortunate enough, to repose greater\r\nconfidence in these men than in those who spoke for their own good;\r\nwhen Lasthenes roofed his house with the timber which came from\r\nMacedonia, and Euthycrates was keeping a large herd of cattle for which\r\nhe had paid no one anything; when a third returned with sheep, and a\r\nfourth with horses, while the people, to whose detriment all this was\r\nbeing done, so far from showing any anger or any disposition to\r\nchastise men who acted so, actually gazed on them with envy, and paid\r\nthem honour and regarded them as heroes--{266} when, I say, such\r\npractices were gaining ground in this way, and corruption had been\r\nvictorious; then, though they possessed 1,000 cavalry and numbered more\r\nthan 10,000 men; though all the surrounding peoples were their allies;\r\nthough you went to their assistance with 10,000 mercenaries and 50\r\nships, and with 4,000 citizen-soldiers as well, none of these things\r\ncould save them. Before a year of the war had expired they had lost all\r\nthe cities in Chalcidice, while Philip could no longer keep pace with\r\nthe invitations of the traitors, and did not know which place to occupy\r\nfirst. {267} Five hundred horsemen were betrayed by their own\r\ncommanders and captured by Philip, with their arms--a larger number\r\nthan were ever before captured by any one. And the men who acted thus\r\nwere not ashamed to face the sun or the earth--the soil of their native\r\nland--on which they stood, or the temples, or the sepulchres of the\r\ndead, or the disgrace which was bound to follow upon such deeds\r\nafterwards. Such is the madness and distraction which corruption\r\nengenders. So it is for you--for you, the People--to be wise, to refuse\r\nto suffer such things, and to visit them with public chastisement. For\r\nit would be monstrous indeed, if, after the terrible condemnation which\r\nyou passed upon those who betrayed the Olynthians, it were seen that\r\nyou allowed the criminals who are in your very midst to go unpunished.\r\n(_To the clerk._) Read the decree passed with reference to the\r\nOlynthians.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read._]\r\n\r\n{268} This decree, gentlemen of the jury, is one which in the eyes of\r\nall, Hellenes and foreigners alike, it was right and honourable in you\r\nto have passed in condemnation of traitors and men detested of Heaven.\r\nAnd so, since the taking of the bribe is the step which precedes such\r\nactions, and it is the bribe that prompts the traitor's deeds,\r\nwhenever, men of Athens, you find a man receiving a bribe, you must\r\ncount him a traitor as well. That one man betrays opportunities, and\r\nanother affairs of state, and another soldiers, means only, I imagine,\r\nthat each works mischief in the particular department over which he has\r\ncontrol; but there should be no distinction in your execration of all\r\nsuch men. {269} You, men of Athens, are the only people in the world\r\nwho can draw from your own history examples which bear upon this\r\nmatter, and who have those ancestors, whom you rightly praise, to\r\nimitate in your actions. You may not be able, at the present time, to\r\nimitate them in the battles, the campaigns, the perils in which they\r\ndistinguished themselves, since at the present moment you are at peace;\r\nbut at least you can imitate their wisdom. {270} For of wisdom there is\r\nneed everywhere; and a right judgement is no more laborious or\r\ntroublesome a thing than a wrong one. Each of you need sit here no\r\nlonger, in order to judge and vote on the question before him aright,\r\nand so to make his country's position a better one, and worthy of our\r\nancestors, than he must in order to judge and vote wrongly, and so make\r\nit worse and unworthy of our ancestors. What then were their sentiments\r\non this matter? (_To the clerk._) Take this, clerk, and read it: (_to\r\nthe jury_) for I would have you see that the acts towards which you are\r\nso indifferent are acts for which your forefathers voted death to the\r\ndoers. (_To the clerk._) Read.\r\n\r\n[_An inscription is read._]\r\n\r\n{271} You hear the inscription, men of Athens, declaring that\r\nArthmius[n] of Zeleia, son of Pythonax, is a foe and a public enemy to\r\nthe people of Athens and their allies--both he and all his house. And\r\nwhy? Because he brought the gold from the foreigner to the Hellenes.\r\nApparently, therefore, we may judge from this, that your ancestors\r\nsought to ensure that no one, not even a stranger, should work mischief\r\nagainst Hellas for money; whereas you do not even seek to prevent any\r\nof your fellow citizens from injuring his own city. {272} 'But,' it may\r\nbe said, 'the inscription occupies a quite unimportant position.' On\r\nthe contrary, although all yonder Acropolis is sacred and there is no\r\nlack of space upon it, this inscription stands on the right hand of the\r\ngreat bronze statue of Athena, the prize of valour in the war against\r\nthe barbarians, set up by the State with funds which the Hellenes had\r\npresented to her. In those days, therefore, uprightness was so sacred,\r\nand such merit was attached to the punishment of actions like these,\r\nthat the sentences passed upon such crimes were thought to deserve the\r\nsame position as the prize-statue of the goddess. And now, unless you,\r\nin your turn, set a check upon this excess of licence, the result must\r\nbe ridicule, impunity, and shame.[5] {273} You would do well, I think,\r\nmen of Athens, to imitate your forefathers, not in this or that point\r\nalone, but continuously, and in all that they did. Now I am sure that\r\nyou have all heard the story of Callias,[n] the son of Hipponicus, to\r\nwhose diplomacy was due the Peace which is universally celebrated, and\r\nwhich provided that the king should not come down by land within a\r\nday's ride of the sea, nor sail with a ship of war between the\r\nChelidonian islands and the Cyanean rocks. He was thought to have taken\r\nbribes on his mission; and your forefathers almost put him to death,\r\nand actually fined him, at the examination of his report, a sum of 50\r\ntalents. {274} True it is, that no more honourable peace can be\r\nmentioned than this, of all which the city ever made before or\r\nafterwards. But it was not to this that they looked. The nature of the\r\nPeace they attributed to their own prowess and the glory of their city:\r\nbut whether the transaction was disinterested or corrupt, depended upon\r\nthe character of the ambassador; and they expected the character\r\ndisplayed by one who took part in public affairs to be upright and\r\nincorruptible. {275} Your ancestors, then, regarded corruption as so\r\ninimical, so unprofitable, to the state, that they would not admit it\r\nin connexion with any single transaction or any single man; while you,\r\nmen of Athens, though you have seen that the Peace which has laid low\r\nthe walls of your own allies is building the houses of your\r\nambassadors--that the Peace which has robbed the city of her\r\npossessions has secured for them more than they had ever before hoped\r\nfor even in their dreams--you, I say, instead of putting them to death\r\nof your own accord, need a prosecutor to assist you; and when all can\r\nsee their crimes in very deed, you are making their trial a trial of\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n{276} It is not, however, by the citation of ancient history, nor by\r\nthese examples alone, that one may stimulate you to vengeance: for even\r\nwithin the lifetime of yourselves, who are here and still living, many\r\nhave paid the penalty. All the rest of these I will pass over; but I\r\nwill mention one or two of those who were punished with death, on\r\nreturning from a mission whose results have been far less disastrous to\r\nthe city than those of the present Embassy. (_To the clerk._) Take then\r\nthis decree and read it.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read._]\r\n\r\n{277} In this decree, men of Athens, you passed sentence of death upon\r\nthose ambassadors, one of whom was Epicrates,[n] a good man, as I am\r\ntold by my elders, and one who had in many ways been of service to his\r\ncountry--one of those who brought the people back from the Peiraeus,[n]\r\nand who was generally an upholder of the democracy. Yet none of these\r\nservices helped him, and rightly. For one who claims to manage affairs\r\nof such magnitude has not merely to be half honest; he must not secure\r\nyour confidence and then take advantage of it to increase his power to\r\ndo mischief; he must do absolutely no wrong against you of his own\r\nwill. {278} Now if there is one of the things for which those men were\r\nsentenced to death, that these men have not done, you may put me to\r\ndeath without delay. Observe what the charges were. 'Since they\r\nconducted their mission,' says the decree,[n] 'contrary to the terms of\r\nthe resolution'--that is the first of the charges. And have not these\r\nmen contravened the terms of the resolution? Does not the decree speak\r\nof peace 'for the Athenians and the allies of the Athenians?' and did\r\nthey not exclude the Phocians from the treaty? Does not the decree bid\r\nthem administer the oath to the magistrates in the several cities? and\r\ndid they not administer it to men sent to them by Philip? Does not the\r\nresolution forbid them 'to meet Philip anywhere alone?' and did they\r\nnot incessantly do business with him privately? {279} Again I read,\r\n'And some of them have been convicted of making a false report before\r\nthe Council.' But these men have been convicted of doing so before the\r\nPeople as well. And convicted by whom? for this is the splendid\r\nthing.[n] Convicted by the actual facts; for all that has happened, as\r\nyou know, has been the exact reverse of what they announced. 'And,' the\r\ndecree goes on, 'of not sending true dispatches.' Nor did these men.\r\n'And of accusing our allies falsely and taking bribes.' Instead of\r\n'accusing falsely', say, 'of having utterly ruined'--surely a far more\r\nheinous thing than a false accusation. And as for the charge of taking\r\nbribes, if it had been denied, it would still have required proof; but\r\nsince they admitted it, a summary procedure was surely the proper one.\r\n{280} What then will you do, men of Athens? You are the offspring of\r\nthat generation, and some of you are actually survivors from it; and\r\nwill you endure it, that Epicrates, the benefactor of the people, one\r\nof the men from the Peiraeus, should have been exiled and punished;[n]\r\nthat Thrasybulus, again, the son of the great Thrasybulus, the People's\r\nfriend, who brought the people back from Phyle, should recently have\r\nbeen fined ten talents; and that the descendant of Harmodius,[n] and of\r\nthose who achieved for you the greatest of blessings, and whom, for the\r\nbenefits which they conferred upon you, you have caused to share in the\r\nlibations and the bowls outpoured, in every temple where sacrifice is\r\noffered, singing of them and honouring them as you honour heroes and\r\ngods--{281} that all these, I say, should have undergone the penalty\r\nordained by the laws, and that no feeling of compassion or pity, nor\r\nthe tears of their children who bore the names of our benefactors, nor\r\naught else, should have availed them anything: and yet, when you have\r\nto do with the son of Atrometus the schoolmaster, and Glaucothea, who\r\nused to hold those meetings of the initiated, a practice for which\r\nanother priestess[n] was put to death--when you have in your hands the\r\nson of such parents, a man who never did a single service to his\r\ncountry--neither himself, nor his father, nor any of his house--will\r\nyou let him go? {282} Where is the horse, the trireme, the military\r\nservice, the chorus, the burden undertaken[n] for the state, the\r\nwar-contribution, the loyal action, the peril undergone, for which in\r\nall their lifetime the city has had to thank him or his? Aye, and even\r\nif all these stood to his credit, and those other qualifications, of\r\nuprightness and integrity in his mission, were not also to be found in\r\nhim, it would surely have been right that he should perish. But when\r\nneither the one nor the other are to be found, will you not avenge\r\nyourselves upon him? {283} Will you not call to mind his own words,\r\nwhen he was prosecuting Timarchus--that there was no help for a city\r\nwhich had no sinews to use against the criminal, nor for a constitution\r\nin which compassion and solicitation were more powerful than the\r\nlaws--that it was your duty not to pity the aged mother of Timarchus,\r\nnor his children, nor any one else, but to attend solely to one point,\r\nnamely, that if you abandoned the cause of the laws and the\r\nconstitution, you would look in vain for any to have pity on\r\nyourselves. {284} Is that unhappy man to have lost his rights as a\r\ncitizen, because he witnessed the guilt of Aeschines, and will you then\r\nsuffer Aeschines to escape unscathed? On what ground can you do so? for\r\nif Aeschines demanded so heavy a penalty from those whose sins were\r\nagainst their own persons, what must be the magnitude of the penalty\r\nwhich _you_ should require--you, the sworn judges of the case--from\r\nthose who have sinned so greatly against their country's interests, and\r\nof whom Aeschines is convincingly proved to be one? {285} 'But,' we are\r\ntold, 'that was a trial which will raise the moral standard of our\r\nyoung men.' Yes, and this trial will raise that of our statesmen, upon\r\nwhose character the supreme interests of the city are staked. For your\r\ncare ought to extend to them also. But you must realize that his real\r\nmotive for ruining Timarchus himself was not, Heaven knows, to be found\r\nin any anxiety for the virtue of your sons. Indeed, men of Athens, they\r\nare virtuous even now; for I trust that the city will never have fallen\r\nso low, as to need Aphobetus and Aeschines to reform the morals of the\r\nyoung. {286} No! the reason was that Timarchus had proposed in the\r\nCouncil, that if any one was convicted of conveying arms or fittings\r\nfor ships of war to Philip, the penalty should be death. And here is a\r\nproof. How long had Timarchus been in the habit of addressing you? For\r\na long time. Now throughout all this time Aeschines was in Athens, and\r\nnever showed any vexation or indignation at the fact of such a man\r\naddressing you, until he had been to Macedonia and made himself a\r\nhireling. (_To the clerk._) Come, take the actual decree which\r\nTimarchus proposed, and read it.\r\n\r\n[_The decree is read._]\r\n\r\n{287} So the man who proposed on your behalf the resolution which\r\nforbade, on pain of death, the supply of arms to Philip during the war,\r\nhas been ruined and treated with contumely; while Aeschines, who had\r\nsurrendered the arms of your very allies to Philip, was his accuser,\r\nand charged him--I call Heaven and Earth to witness--with unnatural\r\noffences, although two of his own kinsmen stood by his side, the very\r\nsight of whom would call forth a cry of protest from you--the\r\ndisgusting Nicias, who went to Egypt and hired himself to Chabrias, and\r\nthe accursed Cyrebion,[n] who joins in processions, as a reveller,[n]\r\nwithout a mask. Nay, why mention these things? His own brother\r\nAphobetus was there before his eyes! In very truth all the words that\r\nwere spoken on that day about unnatural offences were water flowing up\r\nstream.[n]\r\n\r\n{288} And now, to show you the dishonour into which the villainy and\r\nmendacity of the defendant have brought our country, passing by all\r\nbesides, I will mention a fact known to you all. Formerly, men of\r\nAthens, all the other Hellenes used to watch attentively, to see what\r\nhad been resolved in your Assembly; but now we are already going about\r\nand inquiring what others have decided--trying to overhear what the\r\nArcadians are doing, or the Amphictyons, or where Philip will be next,\r\nand whether he is alive or dead. {289} We do this, do we not? But for\r\nme the terrible question is not whether Philip is alive, but whether in\r\nthis city the habit of execrating and punishing criminals is dead.\r\nPhilip has no terrors for me, if your own spirit is sound; but the\r\nprospect that you may grant security to those who wish to receive their\r\nwages from him--that they may be supported by some of those whom you\r\nhave trusted, and that those who have all along denied that they were\r\nacting in Philip's interests may now mount the platform in their\r\ndefence--that is the prospect which terrifies me. {290} Tell me,\r\nEubulus, why it was, that at the recent trial of your cousin\r\nHegesilaus,[n] and of Thrasybulus, the uncle of Niceratus, when the\r\nprimary question[n] was before the jury, you would not even respond\r\nwhen they called upon you; and that when you rose to speak on the\r\nassessment of the penalty,[n] you uttered not a word in their defence,\r\nbut only asked the jury to be indulgent to you? Do you refuse to ascend\r\nthe platform in defence of kinsmen and relations, {291} and will you\r\nthen do so in defence of Aeschines, who, when Aristophon was\r\nprosecuting Philonicus, and in accusing him was denouncing your own\r\nacts, joined with him in accusing you, and was found in the ranks of\r\nyour enemies? You frightened your countrymen here by saying that they\r\nmust either march down to the Peiraeus at once, and pay the war-tax,\r\nand convert the festival-fund into a war-fund, or else pass the decree\r\nadvocated by Aeschines and proposed by the shameless Philocrates--{292}\r\na decree, of which the result was that the Peace became a disgraceful\r\ninstead of a fair one, and that these men have ruined everything by\r\ntheir crimes: and have you, after all this, become reconciled to him?\r\nYou uttered imprecations upon Philip, in the presence of the people,\r\nand swore by the life of your children that you would be glad if\r\nperdition seized him; and will you now come to the aid of Aeschines?\r\nHow can perdition seize Philip, when you are trying to save those who\r\ntake bribes from him? {293} Why is it that you prosecuted Moerocles for\r\nmisappropriating 20 drachmae out of the sums paid by each of the\r\nlessees of the mines, and indicted Ctesiphon for the theft of sacred\r\nmoneys, because he paid 7 minae into the bank three days too late; and\r\nyet, when men have taken money and confess it, and are convicted, by\r\nbeing caught in the very act, of having done so in order to bring about\r\nthe ruin of our allies, you do not prosecute them, but even command\r\ntheir acquittal? {294} But the appalling character of these crimes and\r\nthe great watchfulness and caution that they call for, and the\r\ntriviality of the offences for which you prosecuted those other men,\r\nmay further be seen in this way. Were there any men in Elis who stole\r\npublic funds? It is very likely indeed. Well, had any of them anything\r\nto do with the overthrow of the democracy there? Not one of them.\r\nAgain, while Olynthus was standing, were there others of the same\r\ncharacter there? I am sure that there were. Was it then through them\r\nthat Olynthus was destroyed? No. Again, do you not suppose that in\r\nMegara there was someone who was a thief and who embezzled public\r\nfunds? There must have been. Well, has any such person been shown to be\r\nresponsible for the recent crisis there? {295} Not one. But of what\r\nsort _are_ the men who commit crimes of such a character and magnitude?\r\nThey are those who count themselves worthy to be styled friends and\r\nguest-friends of Philip, who would fain be generals, who claim[n] to be\r\nleaders, who must needs be exalted above the people. Was not Perillus\r\nput on his trial lately before the Three Hundred at Megara, because he\r\nwent to Philip's court; and did not Ptoeodorus, the first man in Megara\r\nin wealth, family, and distinction, come forward and beg him off, and\r\nsend him back again to Philip? and was not the consequence that the one\r\ncame back at the head of the mercenaries, while the other was churning\r\nthe butter[n] at home? {296} For there is nothing, nothing, I say, in\r\nthe world, which you must be so careful not to do, as not to allow any\r\none to become more powerful than the People. I would have no man\r\nacquitted or doomed, to please any individual. Only let us be sure that\r\nthe man whose actions acquit or condemn him will receive from you the\r\nverdict he deserves. {297} That is the true democratic principle. And\r\nfurther, it is true that many men have come to possess great influence\r\nwith you at particular times--Callistratus, and again Aristophon,\r\nDiophantus, and others before them. But where did each of these\r\nexercise his primacy? In the Assembly of the People. But in the\r\nlaw-courts no man has ever, to this day, carried more influence than\r\nthe laws and the juror's oath. Do not then allow the defendant to have\r\nsuch influence to-day. To prove to you that there is good reason for\r\nyou not to trust, but to beware of such influence, I will read you an\r\noracle of the gods, who always protect the city far better than do its\r\nforemost citizens. (_To the clerk._) Read the oracles.\r\n\r\n[_The oracles are read._]\r\n\r\n{298} You hear, men of Athens, the warnings of the gods. If these\r\nresponses were given by them when you were at war, they mean that you\r\nmust beware of your generals, since in war it is the generals who are\r\nleaders; but if they were uttered after you had made peace, they must\r\nrefer to those who are at the head of your government; for these are\r\nthe leaders whom you obey, and it is by these that you are in danger of\r\nbeing led astray. 'And hold the state together' [says the oracle]\r\n'until all are of one mind, and afford no joy to their foes.' {299}\r\nWhich event then, men of Athens, do you think would afford joy to\r\nPhilip--the acquittal of one who has brought about all this evil, or\r\nhis punishment? His acquittal, I am sure. But the oracle, you see, says\r\nthat we should so act as not to afford joy to our foes; and therefore,\r\nby the mouth of Zeus, of Dione,[n] and of all the gods, is this\r\nexhortation given to us all, that with one mind we chastise those who\r\nhave done any service to our enemies. Without are those who are\r\nplotting against us, within are their confederates. The part of the\r\nplotters is to offer the bribe; that of their confederates is to\r\nreceive it, and to save from condemnation those who have received it.\r\n\r\n{300} And further, it needs no more than human reason to arrive at the\r\nconclusion that nothing can be more hateful and dangerous than to allow\r\nyour first citizen to be intimate with those whose objects are not\r\nthose of the People. Consider by what means Philip has become master of\r\nthe entire situation, and by what means he has accomplished the\r\ngreatest of his successes. It has been by purchasing the opportunities\r\nfor action from those who offered them for sale--by corrupting and\r\nexciting the aspirations of the leaders of their several cities. {301}\r\nThese have been the means. Now both of these methods it is in your\r\npower, if you wish it, to render futile to-day, if you will refuse to\r\nlisten to prominent persons who speak in defence of such practices, and\r\nwill thus prove that they have no power over you--for now they assert\r\nthat they have you under their control--while at the same time you\r\npunish the man who has sold himself, and let all the world see what you\r\nhave done. {302} For you would have reason enough, men of Athens, for\r\nbeing angry with any man who had acted so, and had betrayed your allies\r\nand your friends and your opportunities (for with these are bound up\r\nthe whole prosperity or adversity of every people), but with no one\r\nmore than with Aeschines, or with greater justice. After taking up a\r\nposition as one of those who mistrusted Philip--after being the first\r\nand the only man to perceive that Philip was the common enemy of all\r\nthe Hellenes--he deserted, he betrayed you; he suddenly became Philip's\r\nsupporter. Surely he deserves to die many times over! {303} Nay, he\r\nhimself will not be able to deny that these things are so. For who was\r\nit that brought Ischander forward before you originally, stating that\r\nhe had come from the friends of Athens in Arcadia? Who was it that\r\ncried out that Philip was organizing Hellas and the Peloponnese against\r\nyou, while you were asleep? Who was it that delivered those long and\r\nnoble orations to the people, that read to you the decrees of Miltiades\r\nand Themistocles, and the oath of the young soldiers[n] in the temple\r\nof Aglaurus? {304} Was it not the defendant? Who was it that persuaded\r\nyou to send embassies almost as far as the Red Sea, on the ground that\r\nPhilip was plotting against Hellas, and that it was for you to foresee\r\nthis and not to sacrifice the interests of the Hellenes? Was it not\r\nEubulus who proposed the decree, while the ambassador to the\r\nPeloponnese was the defendant Aeschines? What expressions he used in\r\nhis address to the people, after he arrived there, is best known to\r\nhimself: but I know you all remember what he reported to you. {305}\r\nMany a time in the course of his speech he called Philip 'barbarian'\r\nand 'devil'; and he reported the delight of the Arcadians at the\r\nthought that Athens was now waking up and attending to public affairs.\r\nOne thing he told us, which caused him, he said, more distress than\r\nanything else. As he was leaving, he met Atrestidas, who was travelling\r\nhome from Philip's court, and with him were walking some thirty women\r\nand children. Wondering at this, he asked one of the travellers who the\r\nman was, and what this crowd was along with him; {306} and on hearing\r\nthat it was Atrestidas, who was on his way home, and that these with\r\nhim were captives from Olynthus whom Philip had given him as a present,\r\nhe was struck with the atrocity of the thing and burst into tears, and\r\nlamented the unhappy condition of Hellas, that she should allow such\r\ntragedies to pass unnoticed. At the same time he counselled you to send\r\nrepresentatives to Arcadia to denounce Philip's agents, saying that his\r\nfriends told him that if Athens took notice of the matter and sent\r\nenvoys, Philip's agents would be punished. {307} Such, men of Athens,\r\nwas the tenor of his speeches then; and very noble they were, and\r\nworthy of this city. But when he had been to Macedonia, and had seen\r\nthe enemy of himself and of the Hellenes, were his speeches couched any\r\nmore in the same or a similar tone? Far from it! He told you that you\r\nmust neither remember your forefathers nor mention your trophies, nor\r\ngo to the aid of any one. He was amazed, he said, at those who urged\r\nyou to confer with the rest of the Hellenes in regard to the Peace with\r\nPhilip, as though there was any need to convince some one else about a\r\nmatter which was purely your own affair. {308} And as for Philip, 'Why,\r\ngood gracious!' said he, 'Philip is the most thorough Hellene in the\r\nworld, a most able speaker, and most friendly towards Athens: only\r\nthere are certain persons in Athens so unreasonable and so churlish,\r\nthat they are not ashamed to slander him and call him \"barbarian\".' Now\r\nis it possible that the man who had formerly spoken as Aeschines did,\r\nshould now have dared to speak in such a way, if he had not been\r\ncorrupted? What? {309} Is there a man who after conceiving such\r\ndetestation for Atrestidas, owing to those children and women from\r\nOlynthus, could have endured to act in conjunction with Philocrates,\r\nwho brought freeborn Olynthian women here to gratify his lust, and is\r\nso notorious for his abominable living, that it is unnecessary for me\r\nnow to use any offensive or unpleasant expression about him; for if I\r\nsay that Philocrates brought women here, the rest will be understood by\r\nall of you and of the bystanders, and you will, I am sure, pity the\r\npoor unhappy creatures--though Aeschines felt no pity for them, and\r\nshed no tears for Hellas at the sight of them, or at the thought of the\r\noutrages they were suffering among their own allies at the hands of our\r\nambassadors. {310} No! he will shed tears on his own behalf--he whose\r\nproceedings as ambassador have had such results--and perhaps he will\r\nbring forward his children, and mount them upon the platform. But,\r\ngentlemen of the jury, when you see the children of Aeschines, remember\r\nthat the children of many of your allies and friends are now vagabonds,\r\nwandering in beggary, owing to the cruel treatment they have suffered\r\nin consequence of his conduct, and that these deserve your compassion\r\nfar more than those whose father is a criminal and a traitor. Remember\r\nthat your own children have been robbed even of their hopes by these\r\nmen, who inserted among the terms of the Peace the clause which\r\nextended it to posterity. And when you see the tears of Aeschines,\r\nremember that you have now before you a man who urged you to send\r\nrepresentatives to Arcadia to denounce the agents of Philip. {311} Now\r\nto-day you need send no embassy to the Peloponnese; you need take no\r\nlong journey; you need incur no travelling expenses. Each of you need\r\nonly come as far as this platform, to deposit the vote which piety and\r\njustice demand of him, on behalf of your country; and to condemn the\r\nman who--I call Earth and Heaven to witness!--after originally\r\ndelivering the speeches which I described, speaking of Marathon and of\r\nSalamis, and of your battles and your trophies, suddenly--so soon as he\r\nhad set foot in Macedonia--changed his tone completely, and told you\r\nthat you must not remember your forefathers, nor recount your trophies,\r\nnor go to the aid of any one, nor take common counsel with the\r\nHellenes--who all but told you that you must pull down your walls.\r\n{312} Never throughout all time, up to this day, have speeches more\r\nshameful than these been delivered before you. What Hellene, what\r\nforeigner, is so dense, or so uninstructed, or so fierce in his hatred\r\nof our city, that if one were to put to him this question, and say,\r\n'Tell me now; of all Hellas, as it now is--all this inhabited\r\ncountry--is there any part which would have been called by this name,\r\nor inhabited by the Hellenes who now possess it, unless those who\r\nfought at Marathon and Salamis, our forefathers, had displayed that\r\nhigh prowess on their behalf?' Why, I am certain that not one would\r\nanswer 'Yes': they would say that all these regions must have been\r\nconquered by the barbarians. {313} If then no single man, not even one\r\nof our enemies, would have deprived them of these their panegyrics and\r\npraises, does Aeschines forbid you to remember them--you their\r\ndescendants--in order that he himself may receive money? In all other\r\nblessings, moreover, the dead have no share; but the praises which\r\nfollow their noble deeds are the peculiar possession of those who have\r\ndied thus; for then even envy opposes them no longer. Of these praises\r\nAeschines would deprive them; and justly, therefore, would he now be\r\ndeprived of his privileges as as a citizen, and justly, in the name of\r\nyour forefathers, would you exact from him this penalty. Such words you\r\nused, nevertheless, in the wickedness of your heart, to despoil and\r\ntraduce the deeds of our forefathers, and by your word you ruined all\r\nour interests in very deed. {314} And then, as the outcome of this, you\r\nare a landed gentleman, and have become a personage of consequence! For\r\nthis, too, you must notice. Before he had wrought every kind of\r\nmischief against the city he acknowledged that he had been a clerk; he\r\nwas grateful to you for having elected him, and behaved himself\r\nmodestly. But since he has wrought countless evils, he has drawn up his\r\neyebrows, and if any one speaks of 'Aeschines the late clerk', he is\r\nhis enemy at once, and declares that he has been insulted: he walks\r\nthrough the market-place with his cloak trailing down to his ankles,\r\nkeeping step with Pythocles,[n] and puffing out his cheeks--already one\r\nof Philip's friends and guest-friends, if you please--one of those who\r\nwould be rid of the democracy, and who regard the established\r\nconstitution as so much tempestuous madness--he who was once the humble\r\nservant of the Round Chamber.\r\n\r\n{315} I wish now to recapitulate to you summarily the ways in which\r\nPhilip got the better of you in policy, when he had taken these\r\nheaven-detested men to aid him. It is well worth while to review and\r\ncontemplate the course of his deception as a whole. It began with his\r\nanxiety for peace; for his country was being plundered, and his ports\r\nwere closed, so that he could enjoy none of the advantages which they\r\nafforded; and so he sent the messengers who uttered those generous\r\nsentiments on his behalf--Neoptolemus, Aristodemus, and Ctesiphon.\r\n{316} But so soon as we went to him as your ambassadors, he immediately\r\nhired the defendant to second and co-operate with the abominable\r\nPhilocrates, and so get the better of those who wished to act\r\nuprightly; and he composed such a letter to you as he thought would be\r\nmost likely to help him to obtain peace. {317} But even so, he had no\r\nbetter chance than before of effecting anything of importance against\r\nyou, unless he could destroy the Phocians. And this was no easy matter.\r\nFor he had now been reduced, as if by chance, to a position in which he\r\nmust either find it impossible to effect any of his designs, or else\r\nmust perforce lie and forswear himself, and make all men, whether\r\nHellenes or foreigners, witnesses of his own baseness. {318} For if, on\r\nthe one hand, he received the Phocians as allies, and administered the\r\noath to them together with yourselves, it at once became necessary for\r\nhim to break his oaths to the Thessalians and Thebans; for he had sworn\r\nto aid the latter in the reduction of Boeotia, and the former in the\r\nrecovery of their place in the Amphictyonic Council; but if, on the\r\nother hand, he refused to receive them (as in fact he did reject them),\r\nhe thought that you would not let him cross the Pass, but would rally\r\nto Thermopylae--and so you would have done, had you not been misled;\r\nand if this happened, he calculated that he would be unable to march\r\nacross. {319} Nor had he to learn this from others; he had already the\r\ntestimony of his own experience. For on the occasion of his first\r\ndefeat of the Phocians, when he destroyed their mercenaries and their\r\nleader and general, Onomarchus, although not a single human being,\r\nHellene or foreigner, came to the aid of the Phocians, except\r\nyourselves, so far was he from crossing the Pass and thereafter\r\ncarrying out any of his designs, that he could not even approach near\r\nit. {320} He realized, I imagine, quite clearly, that at a time when\r\nthe feelings of the Thessalians were turning against him, and the\r\nPheraeans (to take the first instance) refused to accompany him--when\r\nthe Thebans were being worsted and had lost a battle, and a trophy had\r\nbeen erected to celebrate their defeat--it was impossible for him to\r\ncross the Pass, if you rallied to its defence; and that if he made the\r\nattempt he would regret it, unless some cunning could be called in to\r\naid him. How then, he asked, can I avoid open falsehood, and yet\r\naccomplish all that I wish without appearing perjured? How can it be\r\ndone? It can be done, if I can get some of the Athenians to deceive the\r\nAthenians. In that case the discredit no longer falls to my share.\r\n{321} And so Philip's own envoys first informed you that Philip\r\ndeclined to receive the Phocians as allies; and then these men took up\r\nthe tale, and addressed you to the effect that it was inconvenient to\r\nPhilip to receive the Phocians as your allies openly, on account of the\r\nThebans and the Thessalians; but if he gets command of the situation,\r\nthey said, and is granted the Peace, he will do just what we should now\r\nrequest him to promise to do. {322} So they obtained the Peace from\r\nyou, by holding out these seductive hopes, without including the\r\nPhocians. But they had still to prevent the expedition to Thermopylae,\r\nfor the purpose of which, despite the Peace, your fifty ships were\r\nstill lying ready at anchor, in order that, if Philip marched, you\r\nmight prevent him. {323} How then could it be done? what cunning could\r\nbe used in regard to this expedition in its turn? They must deprive you\r\nof the necessary time, by bringing the crisis upon you suddenly, so\r\nthat, even if you wished to set out, you might be unable to do so. So\r\nthis, it appears, was what these men undertook to do; while for my\r\npart, as you have often been told, I was unable to depart in advance of\r\nthem, and was prevented from sailing even when I had hired a boat for\r\nthe purpose. {324} But it was further necessary that the Phocians\r\nshould come to believe in Philip and give themselves up to him\r\nvoluntarily, in order that there might be no delay in carrying out the\r\nplan, and that no hostile decree whatever might issue from you. 'And\r\ntherefore,' said he, 'the Athenian ambassadors shall announce that the\r\nPhocians are to be preserved from destruction, so that even if any one\r\npersists in distrusting me, he will believe them, and put himself in my\r\nhands. We will summon the Athenians themselves, so that they may\r\nimagine that all that they want is secured, and may pass no hostile\r\ndecree: but the ambassadors shall make such reports about us, and give\r\nsuch promises, as will prevent them from moving under any\r\ncircumstances.' {325} It was in this way, and by such trickery as this,\r\nthat all was ruined, through the action of these doomed wretches. For\r\nimmediately afterwards, as you know, instead of seeing Thespiae and\r\nPlataeae repeopled, you heard that Orchomenus and Coroneia had been\r\nenslaved; instead of Thebes being humbled and stripped of her insolence\r\nand pride, the walls of your own allies were being razed, and it was\r\nthe Thebans who were razing them--the Thebans who, according to\r\nAeschines' story, were as good as broken up into villages. {326}\r\nInstead of Euboea being handed over to you in exchange for Amphipolis,\r\nPhilip is making new bases of operations against you in Euboea itself,\r\nand is plotting incessantly against Geraestus and Megara. Instead of\r\nthe restoration of Oropus to you, we are making an expedition under\r\narms to defend Drymus and the country about Panactum[n]--a step which\r\nwe never took so long as the Phocians remained unharmed. {327} Instead\r\nof the restoration of the ancestral worship in the temple, and the\r\nexaction of the debt due to the god, the true Amphictyons are\r\nfugitives, who have been banished and their land laid desolate; and\r\nMacedonians, foreigners, men who never were Amphictyons in the past,\r\nare now forcing their way to recognition; while any one who mentions\r\nthe sacred treasures is thrown from the rocks, and our city has been\r\ndeprived of her right to precedence in consulting the oracle. {328}\r\nIndeed, the story of all that has happened to the city sounds like a\r\nriddle. Philip has spoken no falsehood, and has accomplished all that\r\nhe wished: you hoped for the fulfilment of your fondest prayers, and\r\nhave seen the very opposite come to pass; you suppose yourselves to be\r\nat peace, and have suffered more terribly than if you had been at war;\r\nwhile these men have received money for all this, and up to this very\r\nday have not paid the penalty. {329} For that the situation has been\r\nmade what it is solely by bribery, and that these men have received\r\ntheir price for it all, has, I feel sure, long been plain to you in\r\nmany ways; and I am afraid that, quite against my will, I may long have\r\nbeen wearying you by attempting to prove with elaborate exactness what\r\nyou already know for yourselves. {330} Yet this one point I ask you\r\nstill to listen to. Is there, gentlemen of the jury, one of the\r\nambassadors whom Philip sent, whose statue in bronze you would erect in\r\nthe market-place? Nay, one to whom you would give maintenance in the\r\nTown Hall, or any other of those complimentary grants with which you\r\nhonour your benefactors? I think not. And why? For you are of no\r\nungrateful or unfair or mean disposition. You would reply, that it is\r\nbecause all that they did was done in the interest of Philip, and\r\nnothing in your own; and the reply would be true and just. {331} Do you\r\nimagine then that, when such are your sentiments, Philip's are not also\r\nsuch? Do you imagine that he gives all these magnificent presents\r\nbecause your ambassadors conducted their mission honourably and\r\nuprightly with a view to _your_ interest? Impossible. Think of\r\nHegesippus, and the manner in which he and the ambassadors who\r\naccompanied him were received by Philip. To go no further, he banished\r\nXenocleides, the well-known poet, by public proclamation, because he\r\nreceived the ambassadors, his own fellow citizens. For so it is that he\r\nbehaves to men who honestly say what they think on your behalf: while\r\nto those who have sold themselves he behaves as he has to these men. Do\r\nwe then need witnesses? do we need stronger proofs than these to\r\nestablish my conclusions? Will any one be able to steal these\r\nconclusions from your minds?\r\n\r\n{332} Now I was told a most extraordinary thing just now by some one\r\nwho accosted me in front of the Court, namely, that the defendant is\r\nprepared to accuse Chares, and that by such methods and such arguments\r\nas that, he hopes to deceive you. I will not lay undue stress on the\r\nfact that Chares,[n] subjected to every form of trial, was found to\r\nhave acted on your behalf, so far as was in his power, with\r\nfaithfulness and loyalty, while his frequent shortcomings were due to\r\nthose who, for money, were cruelly injuring your cause. But I will go\r\nmuch further. Let it be granted that all that the defendant will say of\r\nChares is true. {333} Even so it is utterly absurd that Aeschines\r\nshould accuse him. For I do not lay the blame on Aeschines for anything\r\nthat was done in the course of the war--it is the generals who have to\r\naccount for all such proceedings--nor do I hold him responsible for the\r\ncity's having made peace. So far I acquit him of everything. What then\r\ndo I allege, and at what point does my accusation begin? I accuse him\r\nof having supported Philocrates, at the time when the city was making\r\npeace, instead of supporting those who proposed what was for your real\r\ngood. I accuse him of taking bribes, and subsequently, on the Second\r\nEmbassy, of wasting time, and of not carrying out any of your\r\ninstructions. I accuse him of cheating the city, and ruining\r\neverything, by the suggestion of hopes that Philip would do all that we\r\ndesired; and then I accuse him of speaking afterwards in defence of one\r\nof whom[n] all warned him to beware, on account of the great crimes of\r\nwhich he had been guilty. {334} These are my charges, and these are\r\nwhat you must bear in mind. For a Peace that was honest and fair, and\r\nmen that had sold nothing and had told no falsehoods afterwards, I\r\nwould even have commended, and would have bidden you crown them. But\r\nthe injuries which some general may have done you have nothing to do\r\nwith the present examination. Where is the general who has caused the\r\nloss of Halus? or of the Phocians? or of Doriscus? or of Cersobleptes?\r\nor of the Sacred Mountain? or of Thermopylae? Who has secured Philip a\r\nroad to Attica that leads entirely through the country of allies and\r\nfriends? who has given Coroneia and Orchomenus and Euboea to others?\r\nwho has all but given Megara to the enemy, only recently? who has made\r\nthe Thebans powerful? {335} Not one of all these heavy losses was the\r\nwork of the generals; nor does Philip hold any of these places because\r\nyou were persuaded to concede it to him by the treaty of peace. The\r\nlosses are due to these men and to their corruption. If then he evades\r\nthese points, and tries to mislead you by speaking of every other\r\npossible subject, this is how you must receive his attempt. 'We are not\r\nsitting in judgement upon any general,' you must say, 'nor are you on\r\nyour trial for the things of which you speak. Do not tell us whether\r\nsome one else may not also be responsible for the ruin of the Phocians:\r\nprove to us that no responsibility attaches to yourself. Why do you\r\ntell us _now_ of the alleged iniquities of Demosthenes, instead of\r\naccusing him when his report was under examination? For such an\r\nomission alone you deserve to perish. {336} Do not speak of the beauty\r\nof peace, nor of its advantages. No one holds you responsible for the\r\ncity's having made peace. But show that it was not a shameful and\r\ndiscreditable peace; that we have not since been deceived in many ways;\r\nthat all was not lost. It is for all these things that the\r\nresponsibility has been proved to be yours. And why, even to this hour,\r\ndo you praise the man who has done us all this evil?' If you keep a\r\nwatch upon him thus, he will have nothing to say; and then he will lift\r\nup his voice here, in spite of all his vocal exercises, to no purpose.\r\n\r\n{337} And yet perhaps it is necessary for me to speak about his voice\r\nalso. For of this too, I am told, he is extremely proud, and expects to\r\ncarry you away by his declamation. But seeing that you used to drive\r\nhim away and hiss him out of the theatre and almost stone him, when he\r\nwas performing the tragic story of Thyestes or of the Trojan War, so\r\nthat at last he gave up his third-rate playing, you would be acting in\r\nthe most extraordinary way if, now that he has wrought countless ills,\r\nnot on the stage, but in the most important affairs in the public life\r\nof the state, you listened to him for his fine voice. {338} By no means\r\nmust you do this, or give way to any foolish sentiment. Rather reflect,\r\nthat if you were testing the qualifications of a herald, you would then\r\nindeed look for a fine voice; but when you are testing those of an\r\nambassador, or a man who claims the administration of any public\r\nbusiness, you must look for an upright man--a man who bears himself\r\nproudly indeed, as your representative, but seeks no more than equality\r\nwith yourselves--as I myself refused to pay respect to Philip, but did\r\npay respect to the captives, whom I saved, and never for a moment drew\r\nback; whereas Aeschines rolled at Philip's feet, and chanted his\r\npaeans, while he looks down upon you. {339} And further, whenever you\r\nnotice that cleverness or a good voice or any other natural advantage\r\nhas been given to an honest and public-spirited man, you ought all to\r\ncongratulate him and help him to cultivate his gift; for the gift is an\r\nadvantage in which you all share, as well as he. But when the gift is\r\nfound in a corrupt and villainous man, who can never resist the chance\r\nof gain, then you should exclude him from your presence, and give a\r\nharsh and hostile reception to his words: for villainy, which wins from\r\nyou the reputation of ability, is the enemy of the State. {340} You see\r\nwhat great troubles have fallen upon the city, through those qualities\r\nwhich have brought renown to Aeschines. But whereas all other faculties\r\nare more or less independent, the gift of eloquence, when it meets with\r\nhostility from you who listen, is a broken thing. Listen, then, to the\r\ndefendant as you would listen to a corrupt villain, who will not speak\r\na single word of truth.\r\n\r\n{341} Observe also that the conviction of the defendant is in every way\r\nexpedient, not only on all other grounds, but even when you consider\r\nour relations with Philip himself. For if ever Philip finds himself\r\ncompelled to give the city any of her rights, he will change his\r\nmethods. As it is, he has chosen to deceive the people as a whole, and\r\nto show his favours to a few persons; whereas, if he learns that these\r\nmen have perished, he will prefer for the future to act in the interest\r\nof yourselves collectively, in whose hands all power rests. {342} If,\r\nhowever, he intends to persist in his present domineering and\r\noutrageous insolence, you will, by getting rid of these men, have rid\r\nthe city of those who would do anything in the world for him. For when\r\nthey have acted as they have done, with the expectation of having to\r\npay the penalty in their minds, what do you think they will do, if you\r\nrelax your severity towards them? Where is the Euthycrates,[n] or the\r\nLasthenes, or the traitor of any description, whom they will not outdo?\r\n{343} And who among all the rest will not be a worse citizen, when he\r\nsees that, for those who have sold themselves, the friendship of Philip\r\nserves, in consequence, for revenue, for reputation, and for capital;\r\nwhile to those who have conducted themselves uprightly, and have spent\r\ntheir own money as well, the consequences are trouble, hatred, and ill\r\nwill from a certain party. Let it not be so. It is not for your\r\ngood--whether you regard your reputation or your duty towards Heaven or\r\nyour safety or any other object, that you should acquit the defendant;\r\nbut rather that you should avenge yourselves upon him, and make him an\r\nexample in the eyes of all your fellow citizens and of the whole\r\nHellenic world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] This body was composed of life-members, the archons passing into it\r\nannually at the conclusion of their term of office.
