NORTHAM,\r\n\r\nCONDUCTOR OF TEACHERS' INSTITUTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstruction in Civil Government should be both theoretical and\r\npractical. Unfortunately the text-books in general use stop with\r\nthe theory.\r\n\r\nThey deal with the science of government, but, being intended for\r\nuse throughout the United States, they give no information as to\r\nthe ART of government as practiced in this State.\r\n\r\nOur students learn what is the guaranty of Republican government,\r\nbut not how that government is exercised in their own town.\r\n\r\nThey are drilled in Incorporeal Hereditaments, but do not learn\r\nwhat kind of causes can be tried before a Justice of the Peace.\r\n\r\nTo supply this deficiency, is the aim of the present manual.\r\nBeginning with the school district, the names, manner of election,\r\nduties, and salaries are given of all important officers from the\r\nschool trustee to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe rapid sale of the First and Second Editions of this book\r\nencourages the hope that, with the additions now made, this manual\r\nmay be considered indispensable in every PROGRESSIVE school in the\r\nState of New York.\r\n\r\nHENRY C.
