SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN       307\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first acquaintance with Mr. Arthur J. Balfour, who recently became\r\nPrime Minister of King Edward VII., was made in the earliest days of my\r\nexperience as a member of the House of Commons. The Fourth party, as it\r\nwas called, had just been formed under the inspiration of the late Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill. The Fourth party was a new political enterprise. The\r\nHouse of Commons up to that time contained three regular and recognized\r\npolitical parties--the supporters of the Government, the supporters of\r\nthe Opposition, and the members of the Irish Nationalist party, of whom\r\nI was one. Lord Randolph Churchill created a Fourth party, the business\r\nof which was to act independently alike of the Government, the\r\nOpposition, and the Irish Nationalists. At the time when I entered\r\nParliament the Conservatives were in power, and Conservative statesmen\r\noccupied the Treasury Bench. The members of Lord Randolph's party were\r\nall Conservatives so far as general political principles were concerned,\r\nbut Lord Randolph's idea was to lead a number of followers who should be\r\nprepared and ready to speak and vote against any Government proposal\r\nwhich they believed to be too conservative or not conservative enough;\r\nto support the Liberal Opposition in the rare cases when they thought\r\nthe Opposition was in the right; and to support the Irish Nationalists\r\nwhen they believed that these were unfairly dealt with, or when they\r\nbelieved, which happened much more frequently, that to support the\r\nIrishmen would be an annoyance to the party in power.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth party was made up of numbers exactly corresponding with the\r\ntitle which had been given to it. Four men, including the leader,\r\nconstituted the whole strength of this little army. These men were Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill, Arthur J. Balfour, John Gorst (now Sir John Gorst),\r\nand Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who has during more recent years withdrawn\r\naltogether from parliamentary life and given himself up to diplomacy, in\r\nwhich he has won much honorable distinction. Sir John Gorst has recently\r\nheld office in the Government, and is believed to have given and felt\r\nlittle satisfaction in his official career. He is a man of great ability\r\nand acquirements, but these have been somewhat thrown away in the\r\nbusiness of administration.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Party certainly did much to make the House of Commons a\r\nlively place. Its members were always in attendance--the whole four of\r\nthem--and no one ever knew where, metaphorically, to place them. They\r\nprofessed and made manifest open scorn for the conventionalities of\r\nparty life, and the parliamentary whips never knew when they could be\r\nregarded as supporters or opponents. They were all effective debaters,\r\nall ready with sarcasm and invective, all sworn foes to dullness and\r\nroutine, all delighting in any opportunity for obstructing and\r\nbewildering the party which happened to be in power. The members of the\r\nFourth party had each of them a distinct individuality, although they\r\ninvariably acted together and were never separated in the division\r\nlobbies. A member of the House of Commons likened them once in a speech\r\nto D'Artagnan and his Three Musketeers, as pictured in the immortal\r\npages of the elder Dumas. John Gorst he described as Porthos, Sir Henry\r\nDrummond Wolff as Athos, and Arthur Balfour as the sleek and subtle\r\nAramis. When I entered Parliament I was brought much into companionship\r\nwith the members of this interesting Fourth party. One reason for this\r\nhabit of intercourse was that we sat very near to one another on the\r\nbenches of the House. The members of the Irish Nationalist party then,\r\nas now, always sat on the side of the Opposition, no matter what\r\nGovernment happened to be in power, for the principle of the Irish\r\nNationalists is to regard themselves as in perpetual opposition to every\r\nGovernment so long as Ireland is deprived of her own national\r\nlegislature. Soon after I entered the House a Liberal Government was the\r\nresult of a general election, and the Fourth party, as habitually\r\nconservative, sat on the Opposition benches. The Fourth party gave\r\nfrequent support to the Irish Nationalists in their endeavors to resist\r\nand obstruct Government measures, and we therefore came into habitual\r\nintercourse, and even comradeship, with Lord Randolph Churchill and his\r\nsmall band of followers.\r\n\r\nArthur Balfour bore little resemblance, in appearance, in manners, in\r\ndebating qualities, and apparently in mould of intellect, to any of the\r\nthree men with whom he was then constantly allied. He was tall,\r\nslender, pale, graceful, with something of an almost feminine\r\nattractiveness in his bearing, although he was as ready, resolute, and\r\nstubborn a fighter as any one of his companions in arms. He had the\r\nappearance and the ways of a thoughtful student and scholar, and one\r\nwould have associated him rather with a college library or a professor's\r\nchair than with the rough and boisterous ways of the House of Commons.\r\nHe seemed to have come from another world of thought and feeling into\r\nthat eager, vehement, and sometimes rather uproarious political\r\nassembly. Unlike his uncle, Lord Salisbury, he was known to enjoy social\r\nlife, but he was especially given to that select order of æsthetic\r\nsocial life which was \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\" a\r\nform of life which was rather fashionable in society just then. But it\r\nmust have been clear even to the most superficial observer that he had a\r\ndecided gift of parliamentary capacity. He was a fluent and a ready\r\nspeaker and could bear an effective part in any debate at a moment's\r\nnotice, but he never declaimed, never indulged in any flight of\r\neloquence, and seldom raised his clear and musical voice much above the\r\nconversational pitch. His choice of language was always happy and\r\ntelling, and he often expressed himself in characteristic phrases which\r\nlived in the memory and passed into familiar quotation. He had won some\r\ndistinction as a writer by his \"Defense of Philosophic Doubt,\" by a\r\nvolume of \"Essays and Addresses,\" and more lately by his work entitled\r\n\"The Foundations of Belief.\" The first and last of these books were\r\ninspired by a graceful and easy skepticism which had in it nothing\r\nparticularly destructive to the faith of any believer, but aimed only at\r\nthe not difficult task of proving that a doubting ingenuity can raise\r\ncurious cavils from the practical and argumentative point of view\r\nagainst one creed as well as against another. The world did not take\r\nthese skeptical ventures very seriously, and they were for the most part\r\nregarded as the attempts of a clever young man to show how much more\r\nclever he was than the ordinary run of believing mortals. Balfour's\r\nstyle was clear and vigorous, and people read the essays because of the\r\nwriter's growing position in political life, and out of curiosity to see\r\nhow the rising young statesman could display himself as the avowed\r\nadvocate of philosophic skepticism.\r\n\r\nArthur Balfour took a conspicuous part in the attack made upon the\r\nLiberal Government in 1882 on the subject of the once famous Kilmainham\r\nTreaty. The action which he took in this instance was avowedly inspired\r\nby a desire to embarrass and oppose the Government because of the\r\ncompromise into which it had endeavored to enter with Charles Stewart\r\nParnell for some terms of agreement as to the manner in which\r\nlegislation in Ireland ought to be administered. The full history of\r\nwhat was called the Kilmainham Treaty has not, so far as I know, been\r\never correctly given to the public, and it is not necessary, when\r\nsurveying the political career of Mr. Balfour, to enter into any\r\nlengthened explanation on the subject. Mr. Parnell was in prison at the\r\ntime when the arrangement was begun, and those who were in his\r\nconfidence were well aware that he was becoming greatly alarmed as to\r\nthe state of Ireland under the rule of the late W. E. Forster, who was\r\nthen Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, and under whose operations\r\nleading Irishmen were thrown into prison on no definite charge, but\r\nbecause their general conduct left them open in the mind of the Chief\r\nSecretary to the suspicion that their public agitation was likely to\r\nbring about a rebellious movement. Parnell began to fear that the state\r\nof the country would become worse and worse if every popular movement\r\nwere to be forcibly repressed at the time when the leaders in whom the\r\nIrish people had full confidence were kept in prison and their guidance,\r\ncontrol, and authority withdrawn from the work of pacification. The\r\nproposed arrangement, whether begun by Mr. Parnell himself or suggested\r\nto him by members of his own party or of the English Radical party, was\r\nsimply an understanding that if the leading Irishmen were allowed to\r\nreturn to their public work the country might at least be kept in peace\r\nwhile English Liberalism was devising some measures for the better\r\ngovernment of Ireland. The arrangement was in every sense creditable\r\nalike to Parnell and to the English Liberals who were anxious to\r\ncooperate with him in such a purpose. But it led to some disturbance in\r\nMr. Gladstone's government and to Mr. Forster's resignation of his\r\noffice. In 1885, when the Conservatives again came into power and formed\r\na government, Balfour was appointed President of the Local Government\r\nBoard and afterwards became Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant--in\r\nother words, Chief Secretary for Ireland. He had to attempt a difficult,\r\nor rather, it should be said, an impossible task, and he got through it\r\nabout as well as, or as badly as, any other man could have done whose\r\nappointed mission was to govern Ireland on Tory principles for the\r\ninterests of the landlords and by the policy of coercion.\r\n\r\nBalfour, it should be said, was never, even at that time, actually\r\nunpopular with the Irish National party. We all understood quite well\r\nthat his own heart did not go with the sort of administrative work which\r\nwas put upon him; his manners were always courteous, agreeable, and\r\ngraceful; he had a keen, quiet sense of humor, was on good terms\r\npersonally with the leading Irish members, and never showed any\r\ninclination to make himself needlessly or wantonly offensive to his\r\nopponents. He was always readily accessible to any political opponent\r\nwho had any suggestion to make, and his term of office as Chief\r\nSecretary, although of necessity quite unsuccessful for any practical\r\ngood, left no memories of rancor behind it in the minds of those whom he\r\nhad to oppose and to confront. More lately he became First Lord of the\r\nTreasury and Leader of the House of Commons, and the remainder of his\r\npublic career is too well known to call for any detailed description\r\nhere. My object in this article is rather to give a living picture of\r\nthe man himself as we all saw him in public life than to record in\r\nhistorical detail the successive steps by which he ascended to his\r\npresent high position, or rather, it should be said, of the successive\r\nevents which brought that place within his reach and made it necessary\r\nfor him to accept it. For it is only fair to say that, so far as outer\r\nobservers could judge, Mr. Balfour never made his career a struggle for\r\nhigh positions. So clever and gifted a man must naturally have had some\r\nambition in the public field to which he had devoted so absolutely his\r\ntime and his talents. But he seemed, so far as one could judge, to have\r\nin him none of the self-seeking qualities which are commonly seen in the\r\nman whose purpose is to make his parliamentary work the means of\r\narriving at the highest post in the government of the State. On the\r\ncontrary, his whole demeanor seemed to be rather that of one who is\r\ndevoting himself unwillingly to a career not quite congenial. He always\r\nappeared to me to be essentially a man of literary, scholarly, and even\r\nretiring tastes, who has a task forced upon him which he does not feel\r\nquite free to decline, and who therefore strives to make the best of a\r\ncareer which he has not chosen, but from which he does not feel at\r\nliberty to turn away. Most men who have attained the same political\r\nposition give one the idea that they feel a positive delight in\r\nparliamentary life and warfare, and that nature must have designed them\r\nfor that particular field and for none other. The joy in the strife\r\nwhich men like Palmerston, like Disraeli, and like Gladstone evidently\r\nfelt never showed itself in the demeanor of Arthur Balfour. There was\r\nalways something in his manner which spoke of a shy and shrinking\r\ndisposition, and he never appeared to enter into debate for the mere\r\npleasure of debating. He gave the idea of one who would much rather not\r\nmake a speech were he altogether free to please himself in the matter,\r\nand as if he were only constraining himself to undertake a duty which\r\nmost of those around him were but too glad to have an opportunity of\r\nattempting.\r\n\r\nThere are instances, no doubt, of men gifted with an absolute genius for\r\neloquent speech who have had no natural inclination for debate and would\r\nrather have been free from any necessity for entering into the war of\r\nwords. I have heard John Bright say that he would never make a speech if\r\nhe did not feel it a duty imposed upon him, and that he would never\r\nenter the House of Commons if he felt free to keep away from its\r\ndebates. Yet Bright was a born orator and was, on the whole, I think,\r\nthe greatest public and parliamentary orator I have ever heard in\r\nEngland, not excluding even Gladstone himself. Bright had all the\r\nphysical qualities of the orator. He had a commanding presence and a\r\nvoice of the most marvelous intonation, capable of expressing in musical\r\nsound every emotion which lends itself to eloquence--the impassioned,\r\nthe indignant, the pathetic, the appealing, and the humorous. Then I can\r\nrecall an instance of another man, not, indeed, endowed with Bright's\r\nsuperb oratorical gifts, but who had to spend the greater part of his\r\nlife since he attained the age of manhood in the making of speeches\r\nwithin and outside the House of Commons. I am thinking now of Charles\r\nStewart Parnell. I know well that Parnell would never have made a speech\r\nif he could have avoided the task, and that he even felt a nervous\r\ndislike to the mere putting of a question in the House. But no one\r\nwould have known from Bright's manner when he took part in a great\r\ndebate that he was not obeying in congenial mood the full instinct and\r\ninclination of a born orator. Nor would a stranger have guessed from\r\nParnell's clear, self-possessed, and precise style of speaking that he\r\nwas putting a severe constraint upon himself when he made up his mind to\r\nengage in parliamentary debate. There is something in Arthur Balfour's\r\nmanner as a speaker which occasionally reminds me of Parnell and his\r\nstyle. The two men had the same quiet, easy, and unconcerned fashion of\r\nutterance, always choosing the most appropriate word and finding it\r\nwithout apparent difficulty; each man seemed, as I have already said of\r\nBalfour, to be thinking aloud rather than trying to convince the\r\nlisteners; each man spoke as if resolved not to waste any words or to\r\nindulge in any appeal to the mere emotions of the audience. But the\r\nnatural reluctance to take any part in debate was always more\r\nconspicuous in the manner of Balfour than even in that of Parnell.\r\n\r\nBalfour is a man of many and varied tastes and pursuits. He is an\r\nadvocate of athleticism and is especially distinguished for his devotion\r\nto the game of golf. He obtained at one time a certain reputation in\r\nLondon society because of the interest he took in some peculiar phases\r\nof fanciful intellectual inventiveness. He was for a while a leading\r\nmember, if not the actual inventor, of a certain order of psychical\r\nresearch whose members were described as The Souls. More than one\r\nnovelist of the day made picturesque use of this singular order and\r\nenlivened the pages of fiction by fancy portraits of its leading\r\nmembers. Such facts as these did much to prevent Balfour from being\r\nassociated in the public mind with only the rivalries of political\r\nparties and the incidents of parliamentary warfare. One sometimes came\r\ninto social circles where Balfour was regarded chiefly as the man of\r\nliterary tastes and somewhat eccentric intellectual developments. All\r\nthis cast a peculiar reflection over his career as a politician and\r\nfilled many observers with the idea that he was only playing at\r\nparliamentary life, and that his other occupations were the genuine\r\nrealities for him. Even to this day there are some who persist in\r\nbelieving that Balfour, despite his prolonged and unvarying attention to\r\nhis parliamentary duties, has never given his heart to the prosaic and\r\npractical work of administrative office and the business of maintaining\r\nhis political party. Yet it has always had to be acknowledged that no\r\nman attended more carefully and more closely to such work when he had to\r\ndo it, and that the most devoted worshiper of political success could\r\nnot have been more regular and constant in his attention to the business\r\nof the House of Commons. People said that he was lazy by nature, that he\r\nloved long hours of sleep and of general rest, and that he detested the\r\nmethodical and mechanical routine of official work. But I have not known\r\nany Minister of State who was more easy of approach and more ready to\r\nenter into the driest details of departmental business than Arthur\r\nBalfour. I may say, too, that, whenever appeal was made to him to\r\nforward any good work or to do any act of kindness, he was always to be\r\nfound at his post and was ever ready to lend a helping hand if he could.\r\n\r\nI remember one instance of this kind which I have no hesitation in\r\nmentioning, although I am quite sure Mr. Balfour had little inclination\r\nfor its obtaining publicity. Not very many years ago it was brought to\r\nmy knowledge that an English literary woman who had won much and\r\ndeserved distinction as a novel-writer had been for some time sinking\r\ninto ill health, had been therefore prevented from going on with her\r\nwork, and had in the mean time been perplexed by worldly difficulties\r\nand embarrassments which interfered sadly with her prospects and made\r\nher a subject of well-merited sympathy. Some friends of the authoress\r\nwere naturally anxious, if possible, to give her a helping hand, and the\r\nidea occurred to them that she would be a most fitting recipient of\r\nassistance to be bestowed by a department of the State. One of her\r\nfriends, himself a distinguished novelist, who happened to be also a\r\nfriend of mine, spoke to me with this object, assuming that, as an old\r\nparliamentary hand, I knew more than most writers of books would be\r\nlikely to know about the manner in which such help might be obtained.\r\nThere is in England a fund--a very small fund, truly--at the disposal of\r\nthe Government for the help of deserving authors who happen to be in\r\ndistress. This fund is at the disposal of the First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, the office which was then, as now, held by Arthur Balfour. I\r\nwas still at that time a member of the House of Commons, and my friend\r\nsuggested that, as I knew something about the whole business, I might be\r\na suitable person to represent the case to the First Lord of the\r\nTreasury and make appeal for his assistance. My friend's belief was that\r\nthe application might come with more effect from one who had been for a\r\nlong time a member of Parliament, and whose name would therefore be\r\nknown to the First Lord of the Treasury, than from a literary man who\r\nhad nothing to do with parliamentary life. Nothing could give me greater\r\npleasure than to become the medium through which the appeal might be\r\nbrought under the notice of the First Lord, but I felt some difficulty\r\nand doubt because of the conditions of the time. England was then in the\r\nmost distracting period of the South African war. We were hearing every\r\nday of fresh mishaps and disasters in the campaign. Arthur Balfour was\r\nLeader of the House of Commons, and had to deal every day with\r\nquestions, with demands for explanation, with arguments and debates\r\nturning on the events of the war. It seemed to me to be rather a\r\nventuresome enterprise to attempt to gain the attention of a minister\r\nthus perplexingly occupied for a matter of merely private and individual\r\nconcern. I feared that an overworked statesman might feel naturally\r\ninclined to remit the subject to the care of some mere official, and\r\nthat time might thus be lost and the needed helping hand be long\r\ndelayed. I undertook the task, however, and I wrote to Mr. Balfour at\r\nonce. I received the very next day a reply written in Mr. Balfour's own\r\nhand, expressing his cordial willingness to consider the subject, his\r\nsympathy with the purpose of the appeal, and his hope that some help\r\nmight be given to the distressed novelist. Mr. Balfour promptly took the\r\nmatter in hand, and the result was that a grant was made from the State\r\nfund to secure the novelist against any actual distress. Now, I do not\r\nwant to make too much of this act of ready kindness done by Mr. Balfour.\r\nThe appeal was made for a most deserving object; the fund from which\r\nhelp was to be given was entirely at Mr. Balfour's disposal; and it is\r\nprobable that any other First Lord in the same circumstances would have\r\ncome to the same decision. But how easy it would have been for Mr.\r\nBalfour to put the whole matter into the hands of some subordinate, and\r\nnot to add a new trouble to his own intensely busy life at such an\r\nexciting crisis by entering into the close consideration of a mere\r\nquestion of State beneficence! I certainly should not have been\r\nsurprised if I had not received an answer to my letter for several days\r\nafter I had sent it, and if even then it had come from some subordinate\r\nin the Government department. But in the midst of all his incessant and\r\ndistracting occupations at a most exciting period of public business Mr.\r\nBalfour found time to consider the question himself, to reply with his\r\nown hand, and to see that the desired help was promptly accorded. I must\r\nsay that I think this short passage of personal history speaks highly\r\nfor the kindly nature and the sympathetic promptitude of Arthur Balfour.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there had been much speculation in these countries\r\nconcerning the probable successor to Lord Salisbury, whenever Lord\r\nSalisbury should make up his mind to resign the position of Prime\r\nMinister. We all knew that that resignation was sure to come soon,\r\nalthough very few of us had any idea that it was likely to come quite so\r\nsoon. The general opinion was that the country would not be expected,\r\nfor some time at least, to put up again with a Prime Minister in the\r\nHouse of Lords. If, therefore, the new Prime Minister had to be found in\r\nthe House of Commons, there seemed to be only a choice between two men,\r\nArthur Balfour and Joseph Chamberlain. It would be hard to find two men\r\nin the House of Commons more unlike each other in characteristic\r\nqualities and in training than these two. They are both endowed with\r\nremarkable capacity for political life and for parliamentary debate,\r\n\"but there,\" as Byron says concerning two of whom one was a Joseph, \"I\r\ndoubt all likeness ends between the pair.\" Balfour is an aristocrat of\r\naristocrats; Chamberlain is essentially a man of the British middle\r\nclass--even what is generally called the lower middle class. Balfour has\r\ngone through all the regular course of university education; Chamberlain\r\nwas for a short time at University College School in London, a popular\r\ninstitution of modern origin which does most valuable educational work,\r\nbut is not largely patronized by the classes who claim aristocratic\r\nposition. Balfour is a constant reader and student of many literatures\r\nand languages; \"Mr. Chamberlain,\" according to a leading article in a\r\nLondon daily newspaper, \"to put it mildly, is not a bookworm.\" Balfour\r\nloves open-air sports and is a votary of athleticism; Chamberlain never\r\ntakes any exercise, even walking exercise, when he can possibly avoid\r\nthe trouble. Balfour is an æsthetic lover of all the arts; Chamberlain\r\nhas never, so far as I know, given the slightest indication of interest\r\nin any artistic subject. Balfour is by nature a modest and retiring man;\r\nChamberlain is always \"Pushful Joe.\" The stamp and character of a\r\nsuccessful municipal politician are always evident in Chamberlain, while\r\nBalfour seems to be above all other things the university scholar and\r\nmember of high society. I suppose it must have been a profound\r\ndisappointment to Chamberlain that he was not offered the place of Prime\r\nMinister, but it would be hardly fair to expect that such a place would\r\nnot be offered to the First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the House\r\nof Commons, even if that First Lord did not happen to be a nephew of the\r\nretiring Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle just now to enter into any speculation as to whether\r\nMr. Arthur Balfour will long continue to hold the office. If he should\r\nmake up his mind, as was at one time thought possible by many observers,\r\nto accept a peerage and become Prime Minister in the House of Lords,\r\nsuch a step would undoubtedly be a means of pacifying the partisans of\r\nChamberlain, for Chamberlain would then become, almost as a matter of\r\ncourse, the leader of the Conservative government in the House of\r\nCommons, and this elevation might well satisfy his ambition and give his\r\npushful energy work enough to do. But the country has of late become\r\nless and less satisfied with the practice of having a Prime Minister\r\nremoved from the centre of active life and hidden away in the enervating\r\natmosphere of the House of Lords. The friends of Mr. Balfour are\r\nnaturally inclined to hope and believe that he will not bury himself in\r\nsuch a living tomb. His path will in any case be perplexed by many\r\ndifficulties and obstructions. My own impression is that the inevitable\r\nreaction is destined to come before long. The next general election may\r\nprove that the country at large is tired of a Conservative\r\nadministration. The public mind will soon get over the feverish\r\nexcitement created by the South African war, and people will begin to\r\nremember that England had won battles and annexed territory before there\r\never was a Transvaal Republic, and found then, as she will find now,\r\nthat successes abroad do not relieve her from the necessity of managing\r\nsuccessfully her business at home. It has to be borne in mind, too, that\r\nthe House of Commons does not really originate anything in the work of\r\nimportant legislation. The best business of the Liberal party begins\r\noutside the House of Commons--begins with the people and with those who\r\ntake an interest in the welfare of the people and have brains and\r\nforesight enough to find out how it can be most thoroughly promoted. All\r\ngreat reforms have their origin outside the House of Commons and are\r\nonly taken up by the House of Commons when it is felt that the popular\r\ndemand is so earnest that it must receive serious consideration. The\r\ncountry will soon begin to realize the fact that, shamefully mismanaged\r\nas the War Department may have been during the recent campaigns, the War\r\nDepartment is not by any means the only national institution which needs\r\nthe strong hand of reform. The spirited foreign policy has had its\r\ninnings, and the condition of the people at home must have its turn very\r\nsoon. The Liberal party has its work cut out for it, and where there is\r\nthe work to be done a Liberal party will be found to do it. So far as I\r\ncan read the signs of the times, I am encouraged to hope that a great\r\nopportunity is waiting for the Liberal party, and I cannot see the\r\nslightest reason to doubt that a Liberal party will be found ready for\r\nthe opportunity and equal to it. A Tory Prime Minister has, indeed,\r\nbefore now had the judgment and the energy to forestall the Liberal\r\nparty in the great work of domestic reform, but I do not believe that\r\neven the warmest admirers of Mr. Balfour imagine that he is quite the\r\nman to undertake such an enterprise. Arthur Balfour is, according to my\r\njudgment, the best man for the place to be found in the Conservative\r\nranks at present, but I do not suppose that he is destined just now to\r\nbe anything more than a stop-gap. I admire his great and varied\r\nabilities, I recognize his brilliant debating powers, and I have felt\r\nthe charm of his genial and graceful manners, but I do not believe him\r\ncapable of maintaining the present administration against the rising\r\nforce of a Liberal reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a painting by Hubert von Herkomer\r\n\r\nLORD SALISBURY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD SALISBURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe retirement of Lord Salisbury from the position of Prime Minister and\r\nthe leadership of the Conservative Government withdraws into comparative\r\nobscurity the most interesting and even picturesque figure in the\r\nEnglish Parliamentary life of the present day. Even the most\r\nuncompromising opponents of the Prime Minister and of his political\r\nparty felt a sincere respect for the character, the intellect, and the\r\nbearing of the man himself. Every one gave Lord Salisbury full credit\r\nfor absolute sincerity of purpose, for superiority to any personal\r\nambitions or mere self-seeking, for an almost contemptuous disregard of\r\nState honors and political fame.\r\n\r\nYet it was not that Lord Salisbury was habitually careful and measured\r\nin his speech, that he was never hurried into rash utterances, that he\r\nwas guided by any particular anxiety to avoid offending the\r\nsusceptibilities of others, or, indeed, that, as a rule, he preferred to\r\nuse soothing words in political controversy. He has, on the contrary, a\r\nmarvelous gift of sarcasm and of satirical phrase-making, and he was\r\nonly too ready to indulge occasionally this peculiar capacity at the\r\nexpense of political friend as well as of political foe. In his early\r\ndays of public life, when he sat in the House of Commons as a nominal\r\nfollower of Mr. Disraeli, he was once described in debate by his nominal\r\nleader as \"a master of flouts and jeers.\" On another occasion Disraeli\r\nspoke of him, although not in Parliamentary debate, as a young man whose\r\nhead was on fire. In later days, and even when he had held high\r\nadministrative office, Lord Salisbury often indulged in sudden outbursts\r\nof contemptuous humor which for a time seemed likely to provoke\r\nindignant remonstrance even from his own followers. One illustration of\r\nthis unlucky tendency towards contemptuous utterance may be found in his\r\nfamous allusion several years ago to a native of Hindustan, who had been\r\nelected to a seat in the House of Commons, as \"a black man.\" That was a\r\ntime when every English public man recognized the great importance of\r\nindulging in no expression which might seem calculated to wound the\r\nsusceptibilities of the many races who have been brought under the rule\r\nof the Imperial system in the Indian dominions of the sovereign. The\r\nmember of Parliament thus scornfully alluded to was no more a black man\r\nthan Lord Salisbury himself. He was one of the Parsee races chiefly\r\nfound in the Bombay regions, almost European in the color of their skin,\r\nand he looked more like a German scholar than a native of any sunburnt\r\nland. No one defended Lord Salisbury's rash utterance, but many people\r\nexcused it on the ground that it was only Lord Salisbury's way; that he\r\nnever meant any harm, but could not resist the temptation of saying an\r\namusing and sarcastic thing when it came into his mind. The truth is\r\nthat Lord Salisbury's odd humor is a peculiarity without which he could\r\nnot be the complete Lord Salisbury, and an unlucky expression was easily\r\nforgiven because of the many brilliant flashes of genuine and not unfair\r\nsarcasm with which he was accustomed to illumine a dull debate. When he\r\nsucceeded to his father's title, and had, therefore, to leave the House\r\nof Commons and take his place in the House of Lords, every one felt that\r\nthe representative chamber had lost one of its most attractive figures,\r\nand that the hereditary chamber was not exactly the place in which such\r\na man could find his happiest hunting-ground. Yet even in the somber and\r\nunimpressive House of Lords, Lord Salisbury was able, whenever the humor\r\ntook him, to brighten the debates by his apt illustrations and his witty\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury resigns his position as Prime Minister at a time of life\r\nwhen, according to the present standards of age, a man is still supposed\r\nto have long years of good work before him. Lord Palmerston's career as\r\nPrime Minister was cut short only by his death, an event which occurred\r\nwhen Palmerston was in his eighty-first year. Gladstone was more than\r\nten years older than Lord Salisbury is now when he voluntarily gave up\r\nhis position as head of a Liberal administration. Lord Beaconsfield's\r\ntime of birth is somewhat uncertain, but he must have been some\r\nseventy-seven years of age and had lost none of his powers as a debater\r\nwhen his brilliant life came to its close. We may take it for granted\r\nthat Lord Salisbury had been for a long time growing tired of the\r\nexalted political position which had of late become uncongenial with his\r\nhabits and his frame of mind. By the death of his wife he had lost the\r\nmost loved companion of his home, his intellectual tastes, and his\r\npolitical career. A pair more thoroughly devoted to each other than Lord\r\nand Lady Salisbury could hardly have been found even in the pages of\r\nromance. The whole story of that marriage and that married life would\r\nhave supplied a touching and a telling chapter for romance. Early in his\r\npublic career Lord Salisbury fell in love with a charming, gifted, and\r\ndevoted woman, whom a happy chance had brought in his way. She was the\r\ndaughter of an eminent English judge, the late Baron Alderson; and\r\nalthough such a wife might have been thought a suitable match even for a\r\ngreat aristocrat, it appears that the Lord Salisbury of that time, the\r\nfather of the late Prime Minister, who was then only Lord Robert Cecil,\r\ndid not approve of the marriage, and the young pair had to take their\r\nown way and become husband and wife without regard for the family\r\nprejudices. Lord Robert Cecil was then only a younger brother with a\r\nyounger brother's allowance to live on, and the newly wedded pair had\r\nnot much of a prospect before them, in the conventional sense of the\r\nwords. Lord Robert Cecil accepted the situation with characteristic\r\ncourage and resolve. There seemed at that time no likelihood of his\r\never succeeding to the title and the estates, for his elder brother was\r\nliving, and was, of course, heir to the ancestral title and property.\r\nLord Robert Cecil had been gifted with distinct literary capacity, and\r\nhe set himself down to work as a writer and a journalist. He became a\r\nregular contributor to the \"Saturday Review,\" then at the height of its\r\ninfluence and fame, and he wrote articles for some of the ponderous\r\nquarterly reviews of the time, brightening their pages by his animated\r\nand forcible style. He took a small house in a modest quarter of London,\r\nwhere artists and poets and authors of all kinds usually made a home\r\nthen, far removed from West End fashion and courtly splendor, and there\r\nhe lived a happy and productive life for many years. He had obtained a\r\nseat in the House of Commons as a member of the Conservative party, but\r\nhe never pledged himself to support every policy and every measure\r\nundertaken by the Conservative leaders, whether they happened to be in\r\nor out of office. Lord Robert always acted as an independent member,\r\nalthough he adhered conscientiously to the cardinal principles of that\r\nConservative doctrine which was his political faith throughout his life.\r\nHe soon won for himself a marked distinction in the House of Commons.\r\nHe was always a brilliant speaker, but was thoughtful and statesmanlike\r\nas well as brilliant. He never became an orator in the higher sense of\r\nthe word. He never attempted any flights of exalted eloquence. His\r\nspeeches were like the utterances of a man who is thinking aloud and\r\nwhose principal object is to hold and convince his listeners by the\r\nsheer force of argument set forth in clear and telling language. Many of\r\nhis happy phrases found acceptance as part of the ordinary language of\r\npolitical and social life and became in their way immortal. Up to the\r\npresent day men are continually quoting happy phrases drawn from Lord\r\nRobert Cecil's early speeches without remembering the source from which\r\nthey came.\r\n\r\nSuch a capacity as that of Lord Robert Cecil could not long be\r\noverlooked by the leaders of his party, and it soon became quite clear\r\nthat he must be invited to administrative office. I ought to say that,\r\nafter Lord Robert had completed his collegiate studies at Oxford, he\r\ndevoted himself for a considerable time to an extensive course of\r\ntravel, and he visited Australasia, then but little known to young\r\nEnglishmen of his rank, and he actually did much practical work as a\r\ndigger in the Australian gold mines, then newly discovered. He had\r\nalways a deep interest in foreign affairs, and it was greatly to the\r\nadvantage of his subsequent career that he could often support his\r\narguments on questions of foreign policy by experience drawn from a\r\npersonal study of the countries and States forming successive subjects\r\nof debate. Suddenly his worldly prospects underwent a complete change.\r\nThe death of his elder brother made him heir to the family title and the\r\ngreat estates. He became Viscount Cranborne in succession to his dead\r\nbrother. I may perhaps explain, for the benefit of some of my American\r\nreaders, that the heir to a peerage who bears what is called a courtesy\r\ntitle has still a right to sit, if elected, in the House of Commons. It\r\nis sometimes a source of wonder and puzzlement to foreign visitors when\r\nthey find so many men sitting in the House of Commons who actually bear\r\ntitles which would make it seem as if they ought to be in the House of\r\nLords. The eldest sons of all the higher order of peers bear such a\r\ntitle, but it carries with it no disqualification for a seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons, if the bearer of it be duly elected to a place in the\r\nrepresentative chamber. When the bearer of the courtesy title succeeds\r\nto the actual title belonging to the house, he then, as a matter of\r\ncourse, becomes a peer, has to enter the House of Lords, and would no\r\nlonger be legally eligible to sit in the representative chamber. Lord\r\nPalmerston's presence in the House of Commons was often a matter of\r\nwonder to foreign visitors, for in all the days to which my memory goes\r\nback, Lord Palmerston seemed too old a man to have a father alive and in\r\nthe House of Lords. I have had to explain the matter to many a stranger,\r\nand it only gives one other illustration of the peculiarities and\r\nanomalies which belong to our Parliamentary system. Palmerston's was not\r\na courtesy title; the noble lord was a peer in his own right; but then\r\nhe was merely an Irish peer, and only a certain number of Irish peers\r\nare entitled to sit in the House of Lords. The more fortunate, for so I\r\nmust describe them, of the Irish peers not thus entitled to sit in the\r\nhereditary chamber are free to seek election for an English constituency\r\nin the House of Commons and to obtain it, as Lord Palmerston did. Lord\r\nViscount Cranborne, therefore, continued for a time to hold the place in\r\nthe House of Commons which he had held as Lord Robert Cecil. In 1866\r\nLord Cranborne entered office, for the first time, as Secretary of State\r\nfor India during the administration of Lord Derby.\r\n\r\nThe year following brought about a sort of crisis in Lord Cranborne's\r\npolitical career, and probably showed the general public of England, for\r\nthe first time, what manner of man he really was. Up to that period he\r\nhad been regarded by most persons, even among those who habitually gave\r\nattention to Parliamentary affairs, as a brilliant, independent, and\r\nsomewhat audacious free-lance whose political conduct was usually\r\ndirected by the impulse of the moment, and who made no pretensions to\r\nany fixed and ruling principles. That was the year 1867, when the\r\nConservative Government under Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli took it into\r\ntheir heads to try the novel experiment, for a Conservative party, of\r\nintroducing a Reform Bill to improve and expand the conditions of the\r\nParliamentary suffrage. Disraeli was the author of this new scheme, and\r\nit had been suggested to him by Mr. Gladstone's failure in the previous\r\nyear with his measure of reform. Gladstone's reform measure did not go\r\nfar enough to satisfy the genuine Radicals, while it went much too far\r\nfor a considerable number of doubtful and half-hearted Liberals, and it\r\nwas strongly opposed by the whole Tory party. As usually happens in the\r\ncase of every reform introduced by a Liberal administration, a secession\r\ntook place among the habitual followers of the Government. The secession\r\nin this case was made famous by the name which Bright conferred upon it\r\nas the \"Cave of Adullam\" party; and by the co-operation of the seceding\r\nsection with the Tory Opposition, the measure was defeated, and Mr.\r\nGladstone went out of office. Disraeli saw, with his usual sagacity,\r\nthat the vast mass of the population were in favor of some measure of\r\nreform, and when Lord Derby and he came into office he made up his mind\r\nthat, as the thing had to be done, he and his colleagues might as well\r\nhave the advantage of doing it. The outlines of the measure prepared for\r\nthe purpose only shaped a very vague and moderate scheme of reform, but\r\nDisraeli was quite determined to accept any manner of compromises in\r\norder to carry some sort of scheme and to keep himself and his party in\r\npower. But then arose a new difficulty on which, with all his sagacity,\r\nhe had not calculated. Lord Cranborne for the first time showed that he\r\nwas a man of clear and resolute political principle, and that he was not\r\nwilling to sacrifice any of his conscientious convictions for the sake\r\nof maintaining his place in a Government. He was sincerely opposed to\r\nevery project for making the suffrage popular and for admitting the mass\r\nof the workingmen of the country to any share in its government. I need\r\nhardly say that I am entirely opposed to Lord Cranborne's political\r\ntheories, but I am none the less willing to render full justice to the\r\nsincerity, not too common among rising public men, which refused to make\r\nany compromise on a matter of political principle. Lord Cranborne was\r\nthen only at the opening of his administrative career, and he must have\r\nhad personal ambition enough to make him wish for a continuance of\r\noffice in a powerful administration. But he put all personal\r\nconsiderations resolutely aside, and resigned his place in the\r\nGovernment rather than have anything to do with a project which he\r\nbelieved to be a surrender of constitutional principle to the demands of\r\nthe growing democracy. Lord Carnarvon and one or two other members of\r\nthe administration followed his lead and resigned their places in the\r\nGovernment. I need not enter into much detail as to the progress of the\r\nDisraeli reform measure. It is enough to say that Disraeli obtained the\r\nsupport of many Radicals by the Liberal amendments which he accepted,\r\nand the result was that a Tory Government carried to success a scheme of\r\nreform which practically amounted to the introduction of household\r\nsuffrage. Lord Cranborne and those who acted with him held firmly to\r\ntheir principles, and steadily opposed the measure introduced by those\r\nwho at the opening of the session were their official leaders and\r\ncolleagues. I am convinced that even the most advanced reformers were\r\nready to give a due meed of praise to the man who had thus made it\r\nevident that he preferred what he believed to be a political principle,\r\neven though he knew it to be the principle of a losing cause, to any\r\nconsideration of personal advancement.\r\n\r\nSome of us felt sure that we had then learned for the first time what\r\nmanner of man Lord Cranborne really was. We had taken him for a bold and\r\nbrilliant adventurer, and we found and were ready to acknowledge that he\r\nwas a man of deep, sincere, and self-sacrificing convictions. I have\r\nnever from that time changed my opinions with regard to Lord Cranborne's\r\npersonal character. His career interested me from the first moment that\r\nI had an opportunity of observing it, and I may say that from an early\r\nperiod of my manhood I had much opportunity of studying the ways and the\r\nfigures of Parliamentary life. But until Lord Cranborne had taken this\r\nresolute position on the reform question, I had never given him credit\r\nfor any depth of political convictions. The impression I formed of him\r\nup to that time was that he was merely a younger son of a great\r\naristocratic family, who had a natural aptitude alike for literature and\r\nfor politics, and that he was following in Parliament the guidance of\r\nhis own personal humors and argumentative impulses, and that he was\r\nready to sacrifice in debate not only his friends but his party for the\r\nsake of saying a clever thing and startling his audience into reluctant\r\nadmiration. From those days of 1867 I knew him to be what all the world\r\nnow knows him to be, a man of deep and sincere convictions, ever\r\nfollowing the light of what he believes to be political wisdom and\r\njustice. I can say this none the less readily because I suppose it has\r\nhardly ever been my fortune to agree with any of Lord Salisbury's\r\nutterances on questions of political importance.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the career of Lord Cranborne in the House of Commons came to an\r\nend by the death of his father. He succeeded to the title of Marquis of\r\nSalisbury, and became, as a matter of course, a member of the House of\r\nLords. He was thus withdrawn while still a comparatively young man from\r\nthat stirring field of splendid debate where his highest qualities as a\r\nspeaker could alone have found their fitting opportunity. I need not\r\ntrace out his subsequent public career with any sequence of detail. We\r\nall know how from that time to this he has held high office, has come to\r\nhold the highest offices in the State whenever his political party\r\nhappened to be in power. He has been Foreign Secretary; he has been\r\nPrime Minister in three Conservative administrations. For a time he\r\nactually combined the functions of Prime Minister and those of Foreign\r\nSecretary. He was envoy to the great conference at Constantinople in\r\n1876 and 1877, and he took part in the Congress of Berlin, that\r\nconference which Lord Beaconsfield declared brought to England peace\r\nwith honor. Everything that a man could have to gratify his ambition\r\nLord Salisbury has had since the day when he succeeded to his father's\r\ntitle and estates. His own intellectual force and his political\r\ncapacity must undoubtedly have made a way for him to Parliamentary\r\ninfluence and success even if he had always remained Lord Robert Cecil,\r\nand his elder brother had lived to succeed to the title. But from the\r\nmoment when Lord Robert Cecil became the heir, it was certain that his\r\nparty could not venture to overlook him. He might have made eccentric\r\nspeeches, he might have indulged in sarcastic and scornful allusions to\r\nhis political leaders, he might have allowed obtrusive scruples of\r\nconscience to interfere with the interests of his party, but none the\r\nless it became absolutely necessary that the Conservative politicians\r\nshould accept, when opportunity came, the leadership of the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury. \"Thou hast it all\"--the words which Banquo applies to\r\nMacbeth--might have been said of Lord Salisbury when he became for the\r\nfirst time Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury certainly did not achieve his position by any of the\r\narts, even the less culpable arts, which for a time secured to Macbeth\r\nthe highest reach of his ambition. Lord Salisbury's leadership came to\r\nhim and was not sought by him. I cannot help thinking, however, that,\r\nafter he had once attained that supreme position in his party, the\r\nremainder of his public career has been something in the nature of an\r\nanticlimax. Was it that the chill and deadening influence of the House\r\nof Lords proved too depressing for the energetic and vivacious spirit\r\nwhich had won celebrity for Lord Robert Cecil in the House of Commons?\r\nWas it that Lord Salisbury, when he had attained the height of his\r\nambition, became a victim to that mood of reaction which compels such a\r\nman to ask himself whether, after all, the work of ascent was not much\r\nbetter than the attained elevation? Lord Salisbury's years of high\r\noffice coming now thus suddenly to an end give to me at least the\r\nmelancholy impression of an unfulfilled career. The influence of the\r\nPrime Minister, so far as mere outsiders can judge of it, has always\r\nbeen exerted in foreign affairs for the promotion of peace. Even the\r\nlate war in South Africa is not understood to have been in any sense a\r\nwar of his seeking. The general belief is that the policy of war was\r\npressed upon him by influences which at the time he was not able to\r\ncontrol--influences which would only have become all the stronger if he\r\nhad refused to accept the responsibility of Prime Minister and had left\r\nit to others to carry on the work of government. However this may be,\r\nit can hardly be questioned that of late years Lord Salisbury had become\r\nthat which nobody in former days could ever suppose him likely to\r\nbecome, the mere figurehead of an administration. Lord Salisbury's whole\r\nnature seems to have been too sincere, too free from mere theatrical\r\narts, to allow him to play the part of leader where he had no heart in\r\nthe work of leadership. A statesman like Disraeli might have disapproved\r\nof a certain policy and done his best to reason his colleagues out of\r\nit, but nevertheless, when he found himself likely to be overborne,\r\nwould have immersed himself deliberately in all the new-born zeal of the\r\nconvert and would have behaved thenceforward as if his whole soul were\r\nin the work which had been put upon him to do. Lord Salisbury is most\r\nassuredly not a man of this order, and he never would or could put on an\r\nenthusiasm which he did not feel in his heart. We can all remember how,\r\nat the very zenith of British passion against China during the recent\r\npolitical convulsions and the intervention of the foreign allies, Lord\r\nSalisbury astonished and depressed some of his warmest admirers by a\r\nspeech which he made at Exeter Hall, a speech which, metaphorically at\r\nleast, threw the coldest of cold water on the popular British ardor for\r\nforcing Western civilization on the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's frame of mind was one which could never allow him to\r\nbecome even for a moment a thorough Jingo, and through all the later\r\nyears of his power he held the office of Prime Minister at a time when\r\nJingoism was the order of the day among the outside supporters of the\r\nConservative Government. He never had a fair chance for the full\r\ndevelopment of his intellectual faculties while he remained at the head\r\nof a Conservative administration. Under happier conditions he might have\r\nbeen a great Prime Minister and a leading force in political movement,\r\nbut his intellect, his tastes, and his habits of life did not allow him\r\nto pay much deference to the prejudices and passions of those on whom he\r\nwas compelled to rely for support. There was too much in him of the\r\nthinker, the scholar, and the recluse to make him a thoroughly effective\r\nleader of the party who had to acknowledge his command. He loved\r\nreading, he loved literature and art, and he took no delight in\r\nthe formal social functions which are in our days an important\r\npart of successful political administration. He could not be\r\n\"hail-fellow-well-met\" with every pushing follower who made it a pride\r\nto be on terms of companionship with the leader of the party. I have\r\noften heard that he had a singularly bad memory for faces, and that many\r\na devoted Tory follower found his enthusiasm chilled every now and then\r\nby the obvious fact that the Prime Minister did not seem to remember\r\nanything about the identity of his obtrusive admirer. Much the same\r\nthing has been said over and over again about Mr. Gladstone, but then\r\nGladstone had the inborn genius of leadership, threw his soul into every\r\ngreat political movement, and did not depend in the slightest degree on\r\nhis faculty for appreciating and conciliating every individual follower.\r\nLord Salisbury's tastes were for the society of his close personal\r\nfriends, and I believe no man could be a more genial host in the company\r\nof those with whom he loved to associate; but he had no interest in the\r\nordinary ways of society and made no effort to conciliate those with\r\nwhom he found himself in no manner of companionship. He did not even\r\ntake any strong interest in the study of the most remarkable figures in\r\nthe political world around him, if he did not feel drawn into sympathy\r\nwith their ways and their opinions. On one occasion, when a report had\r\ngot about in the newspapers that Lord Salisbury was often seen in\r\nfriendly companionship with the late Mr. Parnell in the smoking-room of\r\nthe House of Commons, Lord Salisbury publicly stated that he had never,\r\nto his knowledge, seen Parnell, and had never been once in the House of\r\nCommons smoking-room.\r\n\r\nNo man has been better known, so far as personal appearance was\r\nconcerned, to the general English public than Lord Salisbury. He has\r\nbeen as well known as Mr. Gladstone himself, and one cannot say more\r\nthan that. He was a frequent walker in St. James's Park and other places\r\nof common resort in the neighborhood of the Houses of Parliament. Every\r\none knew the tall, broad, stooping figure with the thick head of hair,\r\nthe bent brows, and the careless, shabby costume. No statesman of his\r\ntime was more indifferent than Lord Salisbury to the dictates of fashion\r\nas regarded dress and deportment. He was undoubtedly one of the\r\nworst-dressed men of his order in London. In this peculiarity he formed\r\na remarkable contrast to Lord Beaconsfield, who down to the very end of\r\nhis life took care to be always dressed according to the most recent\r\ndictates of fashion. All this was strictly in keeping with Lord\r\nSalisbury's character and temperament. The world had to take him as he\r\nwas--he could never bring himself to act any part for the sake of its\r\neffect upon the public. My own impression is that when he was removed by\r\nthe decree of fate into the House of Lords and taken away from the\r\nactive, thrilling life of the House of Commons, he felt himself excluded\r\nfrom his congenial field of political action and had but little interest\r\nin the game of politics any more. He does not seem destined to a place\r\nin the foremost rank of English Prime Ministers, even of English\r\nConservative Prime Ministers. But his is beyond all question a\r\npicturesque, a deeply interesting, and even a commanding figure in\r\nEnglish political history, and the world will have reason to regret if\r\nhis voluntary retirement from the position of Prime Minister should mean\r\nalso his retirement from the field of political life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by Elliott & Fry\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF ROSEBERY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD ROSEBERY\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery was for a prolonged season the man in English political\r\nlife upon whom the eyes of expectation were turned. He is a younger man\r\nthan most of his political colleagues and rivals, but it is not because\r\nof his comparative youth that the eyes of expectation were and still are\r\nturned upon him. Not one of those who stand in the front ranks of\r\nParliamentary life to-day could be called old, as we reckon age in our\r\nmodern estimate. Palmerston, Gladstone, and Disraeli won their highest\r\npolitical triumphs after they had passed the age which Lord Salisbury\r\nand Sir William Harcourt have now reached; Mr. Balfour is still regarded\r\nin politics as quite a young man, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has\r\nbut lately been elected leader of the Liberal party in the House of\r\nCommons. Lord Rosebery has already held the highest political offices.\r\nHe has been Foreign Secretary and he has been Prime Minister. He has\r\nbeen leader of the Liberal party. No other public man in England has so\r\nmany and so varied mental gifts, and no other public man has won success\r\nin so many distinct fields. We live in days when, for the time at least,\r\nthe great political orator seems to have passed out of existence. The\r\nlast great English orator died at Hawarden a few short years ago. We\r\nhave, however, several brilliant and powerful Parliamentary debaters,\r\nand among these Lord Rosebery stands with the foremost, if he is not,\r\nindeed, absolutely the foremost. As an orator on what I may call great\r\nceremonial occasions he is, according to my judgment, the very foremost\r\nwe now have. As an after-dinner speaker--and after-dinner speaking\r\ncounts for a great deal in the success of an English public man--he has\r\nnever had an equal in England during my time. Then Lord Rosebery has\r\ndelivered lectures or addresses in commemoration of great poets and\r\nphilosophers and statesmen which may even already be regarded as certain\r\nof an abiding place in literature. Lord Rosebery is a literary man, an\r\nauthor as well as a statesman and an orator; he has written a life of\r\nPitt which is already becoming a sort of classic in our libraries. There\r\nare profounder students, men more deeply read, than he, but I doubt if\r\nthere are many men living who have so wide an acquaintance with general\r\nliterature. He is a lover as well as a student and a connoisseur of art,\r\nhe is an accomplished yachtsman, has a thorough knowledge of horses, is\r\nfamous on the turf, and the owner of two horses which won the Derby. The\r\nlegendary fairy godmother seems to have showered upon him at his birth\r\nall her richest and most various gifts, and no malign and jealous sprite\r\nappears to have come in, as in the nursery stories, to spoil any of the\r\ngifts by a counteracting spell. He was born of great family and born to\r\nhigh estate; he married a daughter of the house of Rothschild; he has a\r\nlordly home near Edinburgh in Scotland, a noble house in the finest West\r\nEnd square of London, and a delightful residence in one of our most\r\nbeautiful English counties.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery is one of the most charming talkers whom it has ever been\r\nmy good fortune to meet. He has a keen sense of humor, a happy art of\r\nlight and delicate satire, and, in private conversation as well as in\r\nParliamentary debate, he has a singular facility for the invention of\r\nexpressive and successful phrases which tell their whole story in a\r\nflash. One might well be inclined to ask what the kindly fates could\r\nhave done for Lord Rosebery that they have left undone. Nevertheless,\r\nthe truth has to be told, that up to this time Lord Rosebery has not\r\naccomplished as much of greatness as most of us confidently expected\r\nthat he would achieve.\r\n\r\nI have been, perhaps, somewhat too hasty in saying that no counteracting\r\nspell had in any way marred the influence of the gifts which the fairies\r\nhad so lavishly bestowed on Lord Rosebery. One stroke of ill\r\nfortune--ill fortune, that is, for an English political leader--was\r\ncertainly directed against him. Nature must have meant him to be a\r\nsuccessful Prime Minister, and yet fortune denied him a seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons. He succeeded to his grandfather's peerage at an early\r\nperiod of his life, and he had to begin his political career as a member\r\nof the House of Lords. He therefore missed all that splendid training\r\nfor political warfare which is given in the House of Commons. It would\r\nnot, perhaps, be quite easy for an American reader to understand how\r\nlittle the House of Lords counts for in the education of fighting\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles James Fox was told in his declining years that the King, as\r\na mark of royal favor, intended to make him a peer and thus remove him\r\nfrom the House of Commons into the House of Lords, he struck his\r\nforehead and exclaimed: \"Good Heaven! he does not think it has come to\r\nthat with me, does he?\" Fox had had all the training that his genius\r\nneeded in the House of Commons, and he was not condemned to pass into\r\nthe House of Lords. Nothing but the inborn consciousness of a genius for\r\npolitical debate can stimulate a man to great effort in the House of\r\nLords. Nothing turns upon a debate in that House. If a majority in the\r\nHouse of Lords were to pass a vote of censure three times a week on the\r\nexisting Government, that Government would continue to exist just as if\r\nnothing had happened, and the public in general would hardly know that\r\nthe Lords had been expressing any opinion on the subject. An ordinary\r\nsitting of the House of Lords is not expected to last for more than an\r\nhour or so, and the whole assembly often consists of some half a dozen\r\npeers. Now and again, during the course of a session, there is got up\r\nwhat may be called a full-dress debate when some great question is\r\ndisturbing the country, and the peers think that they ought to put on\r\nthe appearance of being deeply concerned about it, and some noble lord\r\nwho has a repute for wisdom or for eloquence gives notice of a formal\r\nmotion, and then there is a lengthened discussion, and perhaps, on some\r\nextraordinary occasion, the peers may sit to a late hour and even take a\r\ndivision. But on such remarkable occasions the peer who induces the\r\nHouse to come together and listen to his oration is almost sure to be\r\none who has had his training in the House of Commons and has made his\r\nfame as an orator there.\r\n\r\nNow, I cannot but regard it as a striking evidence of Lord Rosebery's\r\ninborn fitness to be an English political leader that he should have got\r\nover the dreary discouragement of such a training-school, and should\r\nhave practiced the art of political oratory under conditions that might\r\nhave filled Demosthenes himself with a sense of the futility of trying\r\nto make a great speech where nothing whatever was likely to come of it.\r\nLord Rosebery, however, did succeed in proving to the House of Lords\r\nthat they had among them a brilliant and powerful debater who had\r\nqualified himself for success without any help from the school in which\r\nLord Brougham and the brilliant Lord Derby, Lord Cairns, and Lord\r\nSalisbury had studied and mastered the art of Parliamentary eloquence.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, Lord Rosebery appears to have had a natural inclination to\r\nseek and find a training-school for his abilities in places and pursuits\r\nthat might have seemed very much out of the ordinary British\r\naristocrat's way. Until a comparatively recent period, we had nothing\r\nthat could be called a really decent system of municipal government in\r\nthe greater part of London. We had, of course, the Lord Mayor and the\r\nmunicipality of the City of London, but then the City of London is only\r\na very small patch in the great metropolis that holds more than five\r\nmillions of people. London, outside the City, was governed by the\r\nold-fashioned parish vestries, and to some extent by a more recent\r\ninstitution which was called the Metropolitan Board of Works. Now, the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works did not manage its affairs very well. There\r\nwere disagreeable rumors and stories about contracts and jobbing and\r\nthat sort of thing, and although matters were never supposed to have\r\nbeen quite so bad as they were in New York during days which I can\r\nremember well, the days of Boss Tweed, there was enough of public\r\ncomplaint to induce Parliament, at the instigation of Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, to abolish the Board of Works altogether and set up the\r\nLondon County Council, a thoroughly representative body elected by\r\npopular suffrage and responsible to its constituents and the public.\r\nLord Rosebery threw himself heart and soul into the promotion of this\r\nbetter system of London municipal government. He became a member of the\r\nLondon County Council, was elected its first Chairman, and later on was\r\nre-elected to the same office. Now, I think it would be hardly possible\r\nfor a man of Lord Rosebery's rank and culture and tastes to give a more\r\ngenuine proof of patriotic public spirit than he did when he threw\r\nhimself heart and soul into the work of a municipal council.\r\n\r\nUp to that time the business of a London municipality had been regarded\r\nas something belonging entirely to the middle class or the lower middle\r\nclass, something with which peers and nobles could not possibly be\r\nexpected to have anything to do. A London Alderman had been from time\r\nout of mind a sort of figure of fun, a vulgar, fussy kind of person,\r\nwho bedizened himself in gaudy robes on festive occasions, and was\r\nnoted for his love of the turtle in quite a different sense from that\r\nwhich Byron gives to the words. Lord Rosebery set himself steadily to\r\nthe work of London municipal government at a most critical period in its\r\nhistory; his example was followed by men of rank and culture, and some\r\nof the most intellectual men of our day have been elected Aldermen of\r\nthe London County Council. Only think of Frederic Harrison, the\r\ncelebrated Positivist philosopher, the man of exquisite culture and\r\nrefinement, the man of almost fastidious ways, the scholar and the\r\nwriter, becoming an Alderman of the London County Council, and devoting\r\nhimself to the duties of his position! Lord Rosebery undoubtedly has the\r\nhonor of having done more than any other Englishman to raise the\r\nmunicipal government of London to that position which it ought to have\r\nin the public life of the State.\r\n\r\nAll that time Lord Rosebery was not neglecting any of the other\r\nfunctions and occupations which had been imposed upon him, or which he\r\nhad voluntarily taken upon himself. He held the office of First\r\nCommissioner of Works in one of Mr. Gladstone's administrations, an\r\noffice involving the care of all the State buildings and monuments and\r\nparks of the metropolis. He was always to be seen at the private views\r\nof the Royal Academy and the other great picture galleries of the London\r\nseason. He was always starting some new movement for the improvement of\r\nthe breed of horses, and, indeed, there is a certain section of our\r\ncommunity among whom Lord Rosebery is regarded, not as a statesman, or a\r\nLondon County Councilor, or a lover of literature, but simply and\r\naltogether as a patron of the turf. Meanwhile we were hearing of him\r\nevery now and then as an adventurous yachtsman, and as the orator of\r\nsome great commemoration day when a statue was unveiled to a Burke or a\r\nBurns.\r\n\r\nA more delightful host than Lord Rosebery it would not be possible to\r\nmeet or even to imagine. I have had the honor of enjoying his\r\nhospitality at Dalmeny and in his London home, and I shall only say that\r\nthose were occasions which I may describe, in the words Carlyle employed\r\nwith a less gladsome significance, as not easily to be forgotten in this\r\nworld. No man can command a greater variety of topics of conversation.\r\nPolitics, travel, art, letters, the life of great cities, the growth of\r\ncommerce, the tendencies of civilizations, the art of living, the\r\nphilosophy of life, the way to enjoy life, the various characteristics\r\nof foreign capitals--on all such topics Lord Rosebery can speak with the\r\nclearness of one who knows his subject and the vivacity of one who can\r\nput his thoughts into the most expressive words. I suppose there must be\r\nsome eminent authors with whose works Lord Rosebery is not familiar, but\r\nI can only say that if there be any such, I have not yet discovered who\r\nthey are--and I have spent a good deal of my time in reading. I have\r\nseen Lord Rosebery in companies where painters and sculptors and the\r\nwriters of books and the writers of plays formed the majority, where\r\npolitical subjects were not touched upon, and I have observed that Lord\r\nRosebery could hold his own with each practitioner of art on the\r\nartist's special subject. Lord Rosebery does not profess to be a\r\nbookworm or a great scholar, but I do not know any man better acquainted\r\nwith general literature. Such a man must surely have got out of life all\r\nthe best that it has to give.\r\n\r\nYet it is certain that the eyes of expectation are still turned upon\r\nLord Rosebery. There is a general conviction that he has something yet\r\nto do--that, in fact, he has not yet given his measure. He has been\r\nPrime Minister, and he has been leader of the English Liberal party, but\r\nin neither case had he a chance of proving his strength. When Mr.\r\nGladstone made up his mind to retire finally from political life, the\r\nQueen sent for Lord Rosebery and invited him to form an administration.\r\nNow, it is no secret that at that time there were men in the Liberal\r\nparty whose friends and admirers believed that their length of service\r\ngave them a precedence of claims over the claims of Lord Rosebery. There\r\nwere those who thought Sir William Harcourt had won for himself a right\r\nto be chosen as the successor to Mr. Gladstone. On the other side--for\r\nthere was grumbling on both sides--there were members of the Liberal\r\nadministration who positively declined to continue in office if Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt were made Prime Minister. These men did not object to\r\nserve under Sir William Harcourt as leader of the House of Commons, but\r\nthey objected to his elevation to the supreme place of Prime Minister.\r\nAlso, there were Liberals of great influence, who, while they had the\r\nfullest confidence in Lord Rosebery and were not fanatically devoted to\r\nSir William Harcourt, objected to the idea of having a Prime Minister\r\nin the House of Lords, and a Prime Minister, too, who had never sat in\r\nthe House of Commons. Now, it would be idle to deny that there was some\r\npractical reason for this objection. The House of Commons is the field\r\non which political battles are fought and won. The Commander-in-Chief\r\nought always to be within reach. A whole plan of campaign may have to be\r\nchanged at a quarter of an hour's notice. It must obviously often be\r\nhighly inconvenient to have a Prime Minister who cannot cross the\r\nthreshold of the House of Commons in order to get into instant\r\ncommunication with the leading men of his own party who are fighting the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nAt all events, I am now only concerned to say that these doubts and\r\ndifficulties and private disputations did arise, and that, although Lord\r\nRosebery did accept the position of Prime Minister, he must have done so\r\nwith some knowledge of the fact that certain of his colleagues were not\r\nquite satisfied with the new conditions. Lord Rosebery had been most\r\nsuccessful as Foreign Secretary during each term when he held the\r\noffice, but it was well known, before Mr. Gladstone's retirement, that\r\nthere were some questions of foreign policy on which the old leader and\r\nthe new were not quite of one opinion. In English political life, and I\r\nsuppose in the political life of every self-governing country, there are\r\nseasons of inevitable action and reaction which must be observed and\r\nfelt, although they cannot always be explained.\r\n\r\nTo a distant observer the policy of the Liberal party might have seemed\r\njust the same after Mr. Gladstone had retired from politics as it was\r\nwhen he was in the front of political life. But just as the policy which\r\nsustained him in his early days as Prime Minister was helped by the\r\nreaction which had set in against the aggressive policy of Lord\r\nPalmerston, so there came, with the close of Gladstone's Parliamentary\r\ncareer, a kind of reaction against his counsel of peace and moderation.\r\nLord Rosebery was believed to have more of what is called the\r\nImperialist spirit in him than had ever guided the policy of his great\r\nleader. Certainly some of Mr. Gladstone's former colleagues in the House\r\nof Commons appear to have thought so, and there began to be signs of a\r\ngrowing division in the party. Lord Rosebery's Prime Ministership lasted\r\nbut a short time. The Government sustained one or two Parliamentary\r\ndiscomfitures, and there followed upon these a positive defeat in the\r\nnature of a sort of vote of censure carried by a small majority against\r\na department of the administration, on the ground of an alleged\r\ninsufficiency in some of the supplies of ammunition for military\r\nservice. Many a Government would have professed to think little of such\r\na defeat, would have treated it only as a mere question of departmental\r\ndetail, and would have gone on as if nothing had happened. But Lord\r\nRosebery refused to take things so coolly and so carelessly. Probably he\r\nwas growing tired of his position under the peculiar circumstances.\r\nPerhaps he thought the most manly course he could take was to give the\r\nconstituencies the opportunity of saying whether they were satisfied\r\nwith his administration or were not. The Government appealed to the\r\ncountry. Parliament was dissolved, and a general election followed. Then\r\nwas seen the full force of the reaction which had begun to set in\r\nagainst the Gladstone policy of peace, moderation, and justice. The\r\nConservatives came into power by a large majority. Lord Rosebery was now\r\nmerely the leader of the Liberal party in Opposition. Even this\r\nposition he did not long retain. Some of the most brilliant speeches he\r\never made in the House of Lords were made during this time, but somehow\r\npeople began to think that his heart was not in the leadership, and\r\nbefore long it was made known to the public that he had ceased to be the\r\nLiberal Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nEverybody, of course, was ready with an explanation as to this sudden\r\nact, and perhaps, as sometimes happens in such cases, the less a man\r\nreally knew about the matter the more prompt he was with his\r\nexplanation. Two reasons, however, were given by observers who appeared\r\nlikely to know something of the real facts. One was that Lord Rosebery\r\ndid not see his way to go as far as some of his colleagues would have\r\ngone in arousing the country to decided action against the Ottoman\r\nGovernment because of the manner in which it was allowing its Christian\r\nsubjects to be treated. The other was that Lord Rosebery was too\r\nImperialistic in spirit for such men as Sir William Harcourt and Mr.\r\nJohn Morley. No one could impugn Lord Rosebery's motives in either case.\r\nHe might well have thought that too forward a movement against Turkey\r\nmight only bring on a great European war or leave England isolated to\r\ncarry out her policy at her own risk, and in the other case he may have\r\nthought that the policy bequeathed by Mr. Gladstone was tending to\r\nweaken the supremacy of England in South Africa.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery then ceased to lead a Government or a party, and became\r\nfor the time merely a member of the House of Lords. I do not suppose his\r\nleisure hung very heavy on his hands. I cannot imagine Lord Rosebery\r\nfinding any difficulty in passing his day. The only difficulty I should\r\nthink such a man must have is how to find time to give a fair chance to\r\nall the pursuits that are dear to him. Lord Rosebery spent some part of\r\nhis leisure in yachting, gave his usual attention to the turf, was to be\r\nseen at picture galleries, and occasionally addressed great public\r\nmeetings on important questions, and was a frequent visitor to the House\r\nof Commons during each session of Parliament. The peers have a space in\r\nthe galleries of the House of Commons set apart for their own\r\nconvenience, and, although that space can hold but a small number of the\r\npeers, yet on ordinary nights its benches are seldom fully occupied. But\r\nwhen some great debate is coming on, then the peers make a rush for the\r\ngallery space in the House of Commons, and those who do not arrive in\r\ntime to get a seat have to wait and take their chance, each in his turn,\r\nof any vacancy which may possibly occur. I am not a great admirer of the\r\nHouse of Lords as a legislative institution, and I must say that it has\r\nsometimes soothed the rancor of my jealous feelings as a humble Commoner\r\nto see a string of peers extending across the lobby of the House of\r\nCommons, each waiting for his chance of filling some sudden vacancy in\r\nthe peers' gallery.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery continued to attend the debates when he had ceased to be\r\nPrime Minister and leader of the Liberal party just as he had done\r\nbefore. His fine, clearly cut, closely shaven face, with features that a\r\nlady novelist of a past age would have called chiseled, and eyes lighted\r\nwith an animation that seemed to have perpetual youth in it, were often\r\nobjects of deep interest to the members of the House, and to the\r\nvisitors in the strangers' galleries, and no doubt in the ladies'\r\ngallery as well. The appearance of Lord Rosebery in the peers' gallery\r\nwas sure to excite some talk among the members of the House of Commons\r\non the green benches below. We were always ready to indulge in\r\nexpectation and conjecture as to what Lord Rosebery was likely to do\r\nnext, for there seemed to be a general consent of opinion that he was\r\nthe last man in the world who could sit down and do nothing. But what\r\nwas there left for him to do? He had held various administrative\r\noffices: he had twice been Foreign Secretary; he had twice been Chairman\r\nof the London County Council; he had been Prime Minister; he had been\r\nleader of the Liberal party; he had been President of all manner of\r\ngreat institutions; he had been President of the Social Science\r\nCongress; he had been Lord Rector of two great Universities; he had\r\ntwice won the Derby. What was there left for him to do which human\r\nambition in our times and in the dominions of Queen Victoria could care\r\nto accomplish? Yet the general impression seemed to be that Lord\r\nRosebery had not yet done his appointed work, and that impression has\r\ngrown deeper and stronger with recent events.\r\n\r\nSince the day when Lord Rosebery withdrew from the leadership of the\r\nLiberal party the division in that party has been growing wider and\r\ndeeper. The war in South Africa has done much to broaden the gulf of\r\nseparation. Lord Rosebery is an Imperialist, Sir William Harcourt and\r\nMr. John Morley are not Imperialists. The opponents of Sir William\r\nHarcourt and Mr. Morley call them Little Englanders. The opponents of\r\nLord Rosebery and those who think with him would no doubt call them\r\nJingoes. The Imperialist, or, as his opponents prefer to call him, the\r\nJingo, accepts as the ruling principle of his faith the right and the\r\nduty of England to spread her civilization and her supremacy as far as\r\nshe can over all those parts of the world which are still lying in\r\ndisorganization and in darkness. The Little Englander, as his opponents\r\ndelight to describe him, believes that England's noblest work for a long\r\ntime to come will be found in the endeavor to spread peace, education,\r\nand happiness among the peoples who already acknowledge her supremacy. I\r\nam not going to enter into any argument as to the relative claims of the\r\ntwo political schools. It has been said that a man is born either of the\r\nschool of Aristotle or of the school of Plato. Perhaps an Englishman of\r\nmodern times is born a Jingo or a Little Englander. I am not an\r\nEnglishman, and therefore am not called upon to rank myself on either\r\nside of the controversy, but I know full well which way my instincts\r\nand sympathies would lead me if I were compelled to choose. I could not,\r\ntherefore, account myself a political follower of Lord Rosebery; and,\r\nindeed, on the one great question which concerned me most as a member of\r\nthe House of Commons, that of Irish Home Rule, Lord Rosebery is not\r\nquite so emphatic as I should wish him to be. I am therefore writing the\r\neulogy, not of Lord Rosebery the politician, but of Lord Rosebery the\r\norator, the scholar, the man of letters and arts and varied culture, the\r\nman who has done so much for public life in so many ways, the helpful,\r\nkindly, generous friend.\r\n\r\nThe common impression everywhere is that the Conservative Government, as\r\nit is now constituted, cannot last very long. The sands of the present\r\nParliament are running out; the next general election may be postponed\r\nfor some time yet, but it cannot be very far off. Are the Liberals to\r\ncome back to power with Lord Rosebery at their head? Can the Liberal\r\nparty become so thoroughly reunited again, Jingoes and Little\r\nEnglanders, as to make the formation of a Liberal Government a possible\r\nevent so soon? Or is it possible, as many observers believe, that Lord\r\nRosebery may find himself at the head of an administration composed of\r\nImperialist Liberals and the more enlightened and generally respected\r\nmembers of the present Government? I shall not venture upon any\r\nprediction, having seen the unexpected too often happen in politics to\r\nhave much faith in political prophecy. I note it as an evidence of the\r\nposition Lord Rosebery has won for himself that, although he became\r\nPrime Minister only to be defeated, and leader of the Liberal party only\r\nto resign, he is still one of the public men in England about whom\r\npeople are asking each other whether the time for him to take his real\r\nposition has not come at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by Elliott & Fry\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain was once described by an unfriendly critic as the\r\nRabagas of English political life. We all remember Rabagas, the hero of\r\nSardou's masterpiece of dramatic satire, who begins his public career\r\nand wins fame among certain classes as a leveler and a demagogue of the\r\nmost advanced views, an unsparing enemy of the aristocracy, a man who\r\nwill make no terms with the privileged orders, and will bow to no\r\nsovereign but the sovereign people. Now, I have said that it was an\r\nunfriendly critic who likened Mr. Chamberlain to Sardou's creation, but\r\nit was not in the earlier career of the real or the imaginary politician\r\nthat the resemblance was especially to be traced. Rabagas is brought by\r\ntempting conditions under the influence of the privileged classes, the\r\naristocracy, and the reigning sovereign of the small state in which he\r\nlives; and his leveling and revolutionary tendencies melt away under the\r\ngenial influence of his new associations. He becomes, before long, the\r\nadmirer of the aristocracy and the Prime Minister of the Prince, and is\r\nready to devote all his energies to the defense of the privileged\r\norders, to the repression of the vile democracy, and the silencing of\r\nRadical orators.\r\n\r\nIn this contrast between the earlier and the later parts of the\r\npolitical career the malevolent critic, no doubt, found the materials\r\nfor his comparison between Rabagas and Mr. Chamberlain. For there can be\r\nno denying that Mr. Chamberlain began his public life as an eloquent, an\r\nunsparing, and apparently a convinced champion of democracy against the\r\naristocracy, the privileged orders, and the Conservative party, and that\r\nhe is now a leading member of a Conservative Government, and goes\r\nfurther than most of his colleagues would be likely to go in his\r\nhostility to Radical measures and to Radical men.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mr. Chamberlain, who during the earlier part of his public\r\nlife belonged to the party most strenuously opposed to all unnecessary\r\nwars, and especially wars which had annexation for their object, has\r\nbeen the chief Ministerial promoter of the late war in South Africa, a\r\nwar which had for its object the subjugation of two independent\r\nrepublics in order to bring them under the Imperial flag of England. No\r\none, therefore, could have been much surprised when the unfriendly\r\ncritic fancied that he could discover at least a certain superficial\r\nresemblance between the career of Rabagas and the career of Mr.\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\nI have been a close observer of much of Mr. Chamberlain's public life,\r\nand for some time we were thrown a good deal into Parliamentary and\r\npolitical association. He came into the House of Commons not very long\r\nbefore I had the honor of obtaining a seat there, and his fame had\r\npreceded him so far that his entrance into Parliament was looked upon by\r\neverybody as a coming event, in the days when he had not yet been\r\nelected to represent the constituency of Birmingham. Birmingham was at\r\nthat time one of the most thoroughly Radical cities in England. John\r\nBright once said that as the sea, wherever you dip a cup into it, will\r\nbe found to be salt, so the constituency of Birmingham, wherever you\r\ntest it, will be found to be Radical. Birmingham could claim the merit\r\nof being one of the best organized municipalities in England. Its\r\npopular educational institutions were excellent; its free libraries\r\nmight have won the admiration of a citizen of Boston, Massachusetts; its\r\npolice arrangements were efficient; its sanitation might well have been\r\nthe envy of London, and the general intelligence of its citizens was of\r\nthe highest order. Now, it was in this enlightened, progressive, and\r\ncapable community that Mr. Chamberlain won his first fame. He is not a\r\nBirmingham man by birth. He was, I believe, born and brought up on the\r\nsouth side of London, and was educated at University College School,\r\nLondon. But at an early age he settled in Birmingham, and became a\r\nmember of his father's manufacturing firm there. Very soon he rose to\r\ngreat distinction as a public speaker and as a member of the local\r\ncorporation, and three times was elected chief magistrate of Birmingham.\r\nWe began soon to hear a great deal of him in London. It must have been\r\nclear to anybody who knew anything of Birmingham that a man could not\r\nhave risen to such distinction in that city without great intelligence\r\nand a marked capacity for public life. All this time he was known as a\r\nRadical of the Radicals. The Liberal party in London began to look upon\r\nhim as a coming man, and as a coming man who was certain to take his\r\nplace, and that probably a leading place, in the advanced Radical\r\ndivision of the Liberals. His political speeches showed him to be a\r\ndemocrat of the leveling order--a democrat, that is to say, of views\r\nmuch more extreme than had ever been professed by John Bright or Richard\r\nCobden. He was an unsparing assailant of the aristocracy and the\r\nprivileged classes, and, indeed, went so far in his Radicalism that the\r\nConservatives in general regarded him as a downright Republican.\r\n\r\nI can well remember the sensation which his first speech in the House of\r\nCommons created among the ranks of the Tories after his election to\r\nParliament as one of the representatives of Birmingham. The good Tories\r\nmade no effort to conceal their astonishment at the difference between\r\nthe real Chamberlain as they saw and heard him and the Chamberlain of\r\ntheir earlier imaginings. I talked with many of them at the time, and\r\nwas made acquainted with their emotions. Judging from his political\r\nspeeches, they had set him down as a wild Republican, and they expected\r\nto see a rough and shaggy man, dressed with an uncouth disregard for the\r\nways of society, a sort of Birmingham Orson who would probably scowl\r\nfiercely at his opponents in the House and would deliver his opinions\r\nin tones of thunder. The man who rose to address the House was a pale,\r\nslender, delicate looking, and closely shaven personage, very neatly\r\ndressed, with short and carefully brushed hair, and wearing a dainty\r\neyeglass constantly fixed in his eye. \"He looks like a ladies' doctor,\"\r\none stout Tory murmured. \"Seems like the model of a head clerk at a West\r\nEnd draper's,\" observed another. Certainly there was nothing of the\r\nOrson about this well-dressed, well-groomed representative of the\r\nBirmingham democracy. Mr. Chamberlain's speech made a distinct\r\nimpression on the House. It was admirably delivered, in quietly\r\nmodulated tones, the clear, penetrating voice never rising to the level\r\nof declamation, but never failing to reach the ear of every listener.\r\nThe political opinions which it expressed were such as every one might\r\nhave expected to come from so resolute a democrat, but the quiet,\r\nself-possessed delivery greatly astonished those who had expected to see\r\nand hear a mob orator. Mr. Chamberlain's position in the House was\r\nassured after that first speech. Even among the Tories everybody felt\r\nsatisfied that the new man was a man of great ability, gifted with a\r\nremarkable capacity for maintaining his views with ingenious and\r\nplausible argument, a man who could hold his own in debate with the\r\nbest, and for whom the clamors of a host of political opponents could\r\nhave no terrors.\r\n\r\nI may say at once that Mr. Chamberlain has, ever since that time, proved\r\nhimself to be one of the ablest debaters in the House of Commons. He is\r\nnot and never could be an orator in the higher sense, for he wants\r\naltogether that gift of imagination necessary to the composition of an\r\norator, and he has not the culture and the command of ready illustration\r\nwhich sometimes lift men who are not born orators above the mere\r\ndebater's highest level. But he has unfailing readiness, a wide\r\nknowledge of public affairs, a keen eye for all the weak points of an\r\nopponent's case, and a flow of clear and easy language which never fails\r\nto give expression, at once full and precise, to all that is in his\r\nmind. He was soon recognized, even by his extreme political opponents,\r\nas one of the ablest men in the House of Commons, and it seemed plain to\r\nevery one that, when the chance came for the formation of a Liberal\r\nMinistry, the country then being in the hands of a Tory Government, Mr.\r\nChamberlain would beyond question find a place on the Treasury Bench.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Chamberlain's democratic views seemed to have undergone no\r\nmodification. He was as unsparing as ever in his denunciation of the\r\naristocracy and the privileged classes, and he was especially severe\r\nupon the great landowners, and used to propound schemes for buying them\r\nout by the State and converting their land into national property. His\r\nclosest ally and associate in Parliamentary politics was Sir Charles\r\nDilke, who had entered the House of Commons some years before Mr.\r\nChamberlain, and who was then, as he is now, an advanced and determined\r\nRadical. Sir Charles Dilke, in fact, was at that time supposed to be\r\nsomething very like a Republican, at least in theory, and he had been\r\nexciting great commotion in several parts of the country by his\r\noutspoken complaints about the vast sums of money voted every year for\r\nthe Royal Civil List. It was but natural that Sir Charles Dilke and Mr.\r\nChamberlain should become close associates, and there was a general\r\nconviction that the more advanced section of the Liberal party was\r\ndestined to take the command in Liberal politics.\r\n\r\nOutside the range of strictly English politics there was a question\r\narising which threatened to make a new division in the Liberal party.\r\nThis was the question of Home Rule for Ireland as it presented itself\r\nunder the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell. For years the subject\r\nof Home Rule had been the occasion, under the leadership of Mr. Butt, of\r\nnothing more formidable to the House of Commons than an annual debate\r\nand division. Once in every session Mr. Butt brought forward a motion\r\ncalling for a measure of Home Rule for Ireland, and, after some eloquent\r\nspeeches made in favor of the motion by Irish members, a few speeches\r\nwere delivered on the other side by the opponents of Home Rule, Liberals\r\nas well as Tories, and then some leading member of the Government went\r\nthrough the form of explaining why the motion could not be accepted. A\r\ndivision was taken, and Mr. Butt's motion was found to have the support\r\nof the very small Irish Nationalist party, as it then was, and perhaps\r\nhalf a dozen English or Scotch Radicals; and the whole House of Commons,\r\nexcept for these, declared against Home Rule. About the time, however,\r\nof Mr. Chamberlain's entrance on the field of politics a great change\r\nhad taken place in the conditions of the Home Rule question. Charles\r\nStewart Parnell had become in fact, although not yet in name, the leader\r\nof the Irish National party, and Parnell's tactics were very different\r\nindeed from those of his nominal leader, Mr. Butt. Butt was a man who\r\nhad great reverence for old constitutional forms and for the traditions\r\nand ways of the House of Commons, and he had faith in the power of mere\r\nargument to bring the House some time or other to see the justice of his\r\ncause. Parnell was convinced that there was only one way of compelling\r\nthe House of Commons to pay any serious attention to the Irish demand,\r\nand that was by making it clear to the Government and the House that\r\nuntil they had turned their full attention to the Irish national claims,\r\nthey should not be allowed to turn their attention to any other business\r\nwhatever. Therefore he introduced that policy of obstruction which has\r\nsince become historical, and which for a time literally convulsed the\r\nHouse of Commons. Now, I am not going again into the oft-told tale of\r\nHome Rule and the obstruction policy, and I touch upon the subject here\r\nonly because of its direct connection with the career of Mr.\r\nChamberlain. Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain supported Mr. Parnell\r\nin most of his assaults upon the Tory Government. It was Parnell's\r\npolicy to bring forward some motion, during the discussion of the\r\nestimates for the army and navy or for the civil service, which should\r\nraise some great and important question of controversy connected only in\r\na technical sense with the subject formally before the House, and thus\r\nto raise a prolonged debate which had the effect of postponing to an\r\nindefinite time the regular movement of business. Thus he succeeded in\r\nstopping all the regular work of the House until the particular motion\r\nin which he was concerned had been fully discussed and finally settled,\r\none way or the other. It was by action of this kind that he succeeded in\r\nprevailing upon the House of Commons to condemn the barbarous system of\r\nflogging in the army and the navy, and finally to obtain its abolition.\r\nIn this latter course he was warmly supported by Mr. Chamberlain and Sir\r\nCharles Dilke, and by many other Liberal members.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only in obstructive motions which concerned the common\r\ninterests of the country that Parnell obtained the support of Sir\r\nCharles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain. These two men boldly and vigorously\r\nmaintained him in his policy of obstruction when it only professed to\r\nconcern itself with Irish national questions. They identified themselves\r\nso thoroughly with his Irish policy that it became a familiar joke in\r\nthe House of Commons to describe Dilke and Chamberlain as the\r\nAttorney-General and the Solicitor-General of the Home Rule party. I was\r\nthen a member of the House, and had been elected Vice-President of the\r\nIrish party, Parnell being, of course, the President. Naturally, I was\r\nbrought closely into association with Mr. Chamberlain, and I had for\r\nmany years been a personal friend of Sir Charles Dilke. Again and again\r\nI heard Mr. Chamberlain express his entire approval of the obstructive\r\npolicy adopted by Parnell, and declare that that was the only way by\r\nwhich Parnell could compel the House of Commons to give a hearing to the\r\nIrish claims. Mr. Chamberlain, indeed, expressed, on more than one\r\noccasion, in speeches delivered during a debate in the House, just the\r\nsame opinion as to Parnell's course which I had heard him utter in\r\nprivate conversation. In one of these speeches I remember well his\r\ngenerous declaration that he was sorry he had not had an opportunity of\r\nexpressing that opinion to the House of Commons long before. Now, of\r\ncourse, I always thought, and still think, that all this was much to the\r\ncredit of Mr. Chamberlain's political intelligence, courage, and manly\r\nfeeling, and I regarded him as one of the truest English friends the\r\nHome Rule cause had ever made. I had the opportunity, on more than one\r\noccasion, of hearing Dilke and Chamberlain define their respective\r\npositions on the subject of Home Rule. Dilke regarded Home Rule as an\r\nessential part of a federal system, which he believed to be absolutely\r\nnecessary to the safety, strength, and prosperity of the British Empire.\r\nHe would have made it a Federal system, by virtue of which each member\r\nof the Imperial organization governed its own domestic affairs in its\r\nown way, while the common wishes and interests of the Empire were\r\nrepresented, discussed, and arranged in a central Imperial Parliament.\r\nTherefore, even if the Irish people had not been themselves awakened to\r\nthe necessity for a Home Rule Legislature in Ireland, Dilke would have\r\nbeen in favor of urging on them the advantages of such an arrangement.\r\nThis, in point of fact, is the system which has made the Canadian and\r\nthe Australasian provinces what they are at this day, contented, loyal,\r\nand prosperous members of the Imperial system. Chamberlain was not so\r\nconvinced an advocate of the general system of Home Rule as Dilke, but\r\nhe was always emphatic in his declarations that, if the large majority\r\nof the Irish people desired Home Rule, their desire should be granted to\r\nthem by the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen I first entered the House of Commons, the Conservative party was in\r\noffice. About a year after, the general election of 1880 came on, almost\r\nin the ordinary course of events, and the result of the appeal to the\r\ncountry was that the Liberals came back to power with a large majority.\r\nMr. Gladstone was at the head of the Liberal party, and he became Prime\r\nMinister. Everybody assumed that two such prominent Radicals as Dilke\r\nand Chamberlain could not be overlooked by the new Prime Minister in his\r\narrangements to form an administration. I think I am entitled to say, as\r\na positive fact, that Dilke and Chamberlain entered into an\r\nunderstanding between themselves that unless one at least of them was\r\noffered a place in the Cabinet, neither would accept office of any kind.\r\nOf course when a new Government is in process of formation all these\r\narrangements are matters of private discussion and negotiation with the\r\nmen at the head of affairs; and the result of interchange of ideas in\r\nthis instance was that Chamberlain became President of the Board of\r\nTrade, with a seat in the Cabinet, and Dilke accepted the office of\r\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, without a place in the inner\r\nMinisterial circle. This was done, not only with Dilke's cordial\r\nconsent, but at his express wish, for it was his strong desire that the\r\nhigher place in the administration should be given to his friend.\r\n\r\nNow, at this time Mr. Gladstone was not a convinced Home Ruler. I know\r\nthat the importance of the question was entering his mind and was\r\nabsorbing much of his attention. I know that he was earnestly\r\nconsidering the subject, and that his mind was open to conviction; but I\r\nknow also that he was not yet convinced. Chamberlain, therefore, would\r\napparently have had nothing to gain if he merely desired to conciliate\r\nthe favor of his leader by still putting himself forward as the friend\r\nand the ally of the Home Rule party. But he continued, when in office,\r\nto be just as openly our friend as he had been in the days when he was\r\nonly an ordinary member of the House of Commons. There were times when,\r\nowing to the policy of coercion pursued in Ireland by the then Chief\r\nSecretary to the Lord-Lieutenant, the relations between the Liberal\r\nGovernment and the Home Rule party were severely strained. We did battle\r\nmany a time as fiercely against Mr. Gladstone's Government as ever we\r\nhad done against the Government of his Tory predecessor. Yet Mr.\r\nChamberlain always remained our friend and our adviser, always stood by\r\nus whenever he could fairly be expected to do so in public, and always\r\nreceived our confidences in private. When Mr. Parnell and other members\r\nof our party were thrown into Dublin prison, Mr. Chamberlain did his\r\nbest to obtain justice and fair treatment for them and for the Home Rule\r\ncause and for the Irish people.\r\n\r\nMany American readers will probably have a recollection of what was\r\ncalled the Kilmainham Treaty--the \"Treaty\" being an arrangement which it\r\nwas thought might be honorably agreed upon between Mr. Gladstone and the\r\nleaders of the Irish party, and by virtue of which an improved system\r\nof land-tenure legislation was to be given to Ireland, on the one hand,\r\nand every effort was to be made to restore peace to Ireland on the\r\nother. I do not intend to go into this old story at any length, my only\r\nobject being to record the fact that the whole arrangements were\r\nconducted between Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Parnell, and that Chamberlain\r\nwas still understood to be the friend of Ireland and of Home Rule. These\r\nnegotiations led to the resignation of office by the late Mr. William\r\nEdward Forster, Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and\r\nthen came the important question, Who was likely to be put in Mr.\r\nForster's place? I believe that, as a matter of fact, the place was\r\noffered, in the first instance, to Sir Charles Dilke, but was declined\r\nby him on the ground that he was not also offered a seat in the Cabinet,\r\nand Dilke was convinced that unless he had a seat in the Cabinet he\r\ncould have no chance of pressing successfully on the Government his\r\npolicy of Home Rule for Ireland.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain then had reason to believe that the office would be\r\ntendered to him, and he was willing to accept it and to do the best he\r\ncould. I know that he believed that the place was likely to be offered\r\nto him and that he was ready to undertake its duties, for he took the\r\nvery frank and straightforward course of holding a conference with\r\ncertain Irish Nationalist members to whom he made known his views on the\r\nsubject. The Irish members whom he consulted understood clearly from him\r\nthat if he went to Ireland in the capacity of Chief Secretary he would\r\ngo as a Home Ruler and would expect their co-operation and their\r\nassistance. There was no secret about this conference. It was held\r\nwithin the precincts of the House of Commons, and Mr. Chamberlain's\r\naction in suggesting and conducting it was entirely becoming and proper\r\nunder the conditions. For some reason or other, which I at least have\r\nnever heard satisfactorily explained, the office of Chief Secretary was\r\ngiven, after all, to the late Lord Frederick Cavendish. Then followed\r\nthe terrible tragedy of the Phoenix Park, Dublin, when Lord Frederick\r\nand Mr. Thomas Burke, his official subordinate, were murdered in the\r\nopen day by a gang of assassins. When the news of this appalling deed\r\nreached London, Mr. Parnell and I went at once, and as a matter of\r\ncourse, to consult with Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain as to the\r\nsteps which ought to be taken in order to vindicate the Irish people\r\nfrom any charge of sympathy with so wanton and so atrocious a crime. We\r\nsaw both Dilke and Chamberlain and consulted with them, and I can well\r\nremember being greatly impressed by the firmness with which Mr.\r\nChamberlain declared that nothing which had happened would prevent him\r\nfrom accepting the office of Chief Secretary in Ireland if the\r\nopportunity were offered to him. I go into all this detail with the\r\nobject of making it clear to the reader that, up to this time, Mr.\r\nChamberlain had the full confidence of the Irish Nationalist party and\r\nwas understood by them to be in thorough sympathy with them as to\r\nIreland's demand for Home Rule.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain did not, however, become Irish Secretary, but retained\r\nhis position as President of the Board of Trade, and many foreign\r\ntroubles began in Egypt and other parts of the world which diverted the\r\nattention of Parliament and the public for a while from questions of\r\npurely domestic policy. Mr. Gladstone, however, succeeded in carrying\r\nthrough Parliament a sort of new reform bill which reconstructed the\r\nconstituencies, expanded the electorate, and, in fact, set up in the\r\nthree countries something approaching nearly to the old Chartist idea of\r\nequal electoral division and universal suffrage. The foreign troubles,\r\nhowever, were very serious, the Government lost its popularity, and at\r\nlast was defeated on one of its financial proposals and resigned office.\r\nThe Tories came into power for a short time. Mr. Chamberlain stumped the\r\ncountry in his old familiar capacity as a Radical politician of the\r\nextreme school, and he started a scheme of policy which was commonly\r\ndescribed afterwards as the unauthorized programme, in which he\r\nadvocated, among other bold reforms, a peasant proprietary throughout\r\nthe country by the compulsory purchase of land, the effect of which\r\nwould be to endow every deserving peasant with at least three acres and\r\na cow. The Tories were not able to do anything in office, owing to the\r\ncombined attacks made upon them by the Radicals and the Irish Home\r\nRulers, and in 1886 another dissolution of Parliament took place and a\r\ngeneral election came on. The effect of the latest reform measure\r\nintroduced by Mr. Gladstone now told irresistibly in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nfavor, and the newly arranged constituencies sent him back into office\r\nand into power. Mr. Chamberlain once again joined Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernment, and became President of the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nThen comes a sudden change in the story. The extension of the suffrage\r\ngave, for the first time, a large voting power into the hands of the\r\nmajority of the Irish people, for in Ireland up to that date the right\r\nto vote had been enjoyed only by the landlord class and the well-to-do\r\nmiddle class; and the result of the new franchise was that Ireland sent\r\ninto Parliament an overwhelming number of Home Rule Representatives to\r\nfollow the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone then became thoroughly\r\nsatisfied that the vast majority of the Irish people were in favor of\r\nHome Rule, and he determined to introduce a measure which should give to\r\nIreland a separate domestic Parliament. Thereupon Mr. Chamberlain\r\nsuddenly announced that he could not support such a measure of Home\r\nRule, and it presently came out that he could not support any measure of\r\nHome Rule. He resigned his place in Mr. Gladstone's Government, and he\r\nbecame from that time not only an opponent of Home Rule but a proclaimed\r\nConservative and anti-Radical. When a Tory Government was formed, after\r\nthe defeat of Mr. Gladstone's first Home Rule measure, Mr. Chamberlain\r\nbecame a member of the Tory Government, and he is one of the leading\r\nmembers of a Tory Government at this day.\r\n\r\nNow, it is for this reason, I suppose, that the unfriendly critic, of\r\nwhom I have already spoken more than once, thought himself justified in\r\ndescribing Mr. Chamberlain as the Rabagas of English political life. It\r\nis, indeed, hard for any of us to understand the meaning of Mr.\r\nChamberlain's sudden change. At the opening of 1886 he was, what he had\r\nbeen during all his previous political life, a flaming democrat and\r\nRadical. In the early months of 1886 he was a flaming Tory and\r\nanti-Radical. During several years of frequent association with him in\r\nthe House of Commons I had always known him as an advocate of Home Rule\r\nfor Ireland, and all of a sudden he exhibited himself as an\r\nuncompromising opponent of Home Rule. Many English Liberal members\r\nobjected to some of the provisions of Mr. Gladstone's first Home Rule\r\nBill, but when these objections were removed in Mr. Gladstone's second\r\nHome Rule Bill they returned at once to their places under his\r\nleadership. But Mr. Chamberlain would have nothing to do with any\r\nmanner of Home Rule measure, and when he visited the province of Ulster\r\nin the north of Ireland he delighted all the Ulster Orangemen by the\r\nfervor of his speeches against Home Rule. Moreover, it may fairly be\r\nasked why an English Radical and democrat of extreme views must needs\r\nbecome an advocate of Toryism all along the line simply because he has\r\nceased to be in favor of Home Rule for Ireland. These are questions\r\nwhich I, at least, cannot pretend to answer.\r\n\r\nOf course we have in history many instances of conversions as sudden and\r\nas complete, about the absolute sincerity of which even the worldly and\r\ncynical critic has never ventured a doubt. There was the conversion of\r\nConstantine the Great, and there was the sudden change brought about in\r\nthe feelings and the life of Ignatius of Loyola. But then somehow Mr.\r\nChamberlain does not seem to have impressed on his contemporaries,\r\neither before or after his great change, the idea that he was a man cast\r\nexactly in the mold of a Constantine or an Ignatius. Only of late years\r\nhas he been dubbed with the familiar nickname of \"Pushful Joe,\" but he\r\nwas always set down as a man of personal ambition, determined to make\r\nhis way well on in the world. We had all made up our minds, somehow,\r\nthat he would be content to push his fortunes on that side of the\r\npolitical field to which, up to that time, he had proclaimed himself to\r\nbelong, and it never occurred to us to think of him as the associate of\r\nTory dukes, as a leading member of a Tory Government, and as the\r\nchampion of Tory principles. Men have in all ages changed their\r\npolitical faith without exciting the world's wonder. Mr. Gladstone began\r\nas a Tory, and grew by slow degrees into a Radical. Two or three public\r\nmen in our own days who began as moderate Liberals have gradually turned\r\ninto moderate Tories. But Mr. Chamberlain's conversion was not like any\r\nof these. It was accomplished with a suddenness that seemed to belong to\r\nthe days when miracles were yet worked upon the earth. Mr. Chamberlain\r\nmay well feel proud in the consciousness that the close attention of the\r\npolitical world will follow with eager curiosity his further career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by Elliott & Fry\r\n\r\nHENRY LABOUCHERE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY LABOUCHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Labouchere is the most amusing speaker in the House of Commons.\r\nEclipse is first and there is no second--to adopt the words once used by\r\nLord Macaulay--at least, if there be a second, I do not feel myself\r\nqualified for the task of designating him. It is hardly necessary to say\r\nthat whenever Labouchere rises in the House of Commons--and he rises\r\nvery often in the course of a session--he is sure of an immediate\r\nhearing. He seldom addresses himself to any subject with the outward\r\nappearance of seriousness. He always puts his argument in jesting form;\r\nsends a shower of sparkling words over the most solemn controversy; puts\r\non the manner of one who has plunged into the debate only for the mere\r\nfun of the thing; and brings his display to an end just at the time when\r\nthe House hopes that he is only beginning to exert himself for its\r\namusement. I do not know that he has ever made what could be called a\r\nlong speech, and I think I may fairly assume that he has never made a\r\nspeech which his audience would not have wished to be a little longer.\r\n\r\nNow, I must say at once that it would be the most complete\r\nmisappreciation of Henry Labouchere's character and purpose to regard\r\nhim as a mere jester, or even a mere humorist endowed with the faculty\r\nof uttering spontaneous witticisms. Labouchere is very much in earnest\r\neven when he makes a joke, and his sharpest cynicism is inspired by a\r\nlove of justice and a desire to champion the cause of what he believes\r\nto be the right. I heard him once make a speech in the House of Commons\r\non behalf of some suffering class or cause, and when coming to a close\r\nhe suddenly said: \"I may be told that this is a sentimental view of the\r\ncase; but, Mr. Speaker, I am a man of sentiment.\" The House broke into a\r\nperfect chorus of laughter at the idea thus presented of Labouchere as a\r\nman of sentiment. Probably many, or most, of his listeners thought it\r\nwas only Labouchere's fun, and merely another illustration of his love\r\nfor droll paradox. I have no doubt that Labouchere knew very well in\r\nadvance what sort of reception was likely to be given to his\r\ndescription of himself, and that he heartily enjoyed the effect it\r\nproduced. But, all the same, there was a good deal of truth in the\r\ndescription. I have always regarded Labouchere as a man of intensely\r\nstrong opinions, whose peculiar humor it is to maintain these opinions\r\nby sarcasm and witticism and seeming paradox.\r\n\r\nCertainly no public man in England has given clearer evidence of his\r\nsincerity and disinterestedness in any cause that he advocates than\r\nLabouchere has done again and again. I remember hearing it said many\r\nyears ago in New York of my old friend Horace Greeley that whereas some\r\nother editors of great newspapers backed up their money with their\r\nopinions, Greeley backed up his opinions with his money. The meaning, of\r\ncourse, was that while some editors shaped their opinions in order to\r\nmake their journals profitable, Horace Greeley was ready to sacrifice\r\nhis money for the sake of maintaining the newspaper which expressed his\r\nsincere convictions. Something of the same kind might fairly be said of\r\nHenry Labouchere. He is the proprietor and editor of the weekly\r\nnewspaper \"Truth,\" in which he expresses his own opinions without the\r\nslightest regard for the commercial interests of the paper, or, indeed,\r\nfor the political interests of the party which he usually supports in\r\nthe House of Commons. I believe that, as a matter of fact, \"Truth\" is a\r\nmost successful enterprise, even as a commercial speculation, for\r\neverybody wants to know what it is likely to say on this or that new and\r\nexciting question, and nobody can tell in advance what view Labouchere's\r\norgan may be likely to take. Labouchere has, however, given proof many\r\ntimes that he keeps up his newspaper as the organ of his individual\r\nopinions, and not merely as a means of making money or sustaining the\r\ninterests of a political party. He has again and again hunted out and\r\nhunted down evil systems of various kinds, shams and quacks of many\r\norders, abuses affecting large masses of the poor and the lowly, and has\r\nrendered himself liable to all manner of legal actions for the recovery\r\nof damages. If, because of some technical or other failure in his\r\ndefense to one of those legal actions, Labouchere is cast in heavy\r\ndamages, he pays the amount, makes a jest or two about it, and goes to\r\nwork at the collection of better evidence and at the hunting out of\r\nother shams with as cheery a countenance as if nothing particular had\r\nhappened. Fortunately for himself, and, I think, also very fortunately\r\nfor the public in general, Labouchere is personally a rich man, and is\r\nable to meet without inconvenience any loss which may be brought upon\r\nhim now and then by his resolute endeavors to expose shams.\r\n\r\nLabouchere spent ten years of his earlier manhood in the diplomatic\r\nservice, and was attaché at various foreign courts and at Washington. He\r\nhad always a turn for active political life, and entered the House of\r\nCommons in 1865, and in 1880 was elected as one of the representatives\r\nfor the constituency of Northampton. His colleague at that time in the\r\nrepresentation of the constituency was the once famous Charles\r\nBradlaugh. It would not be easy to find a greater contrast in appearance\r\nand manners, in education and social bringing up, than that presented by\r\nthe two representatives of Northampton. Labouchere is a man of barely\r\nmedium stature; Bradlaugh's proportions approached almost to the\r\ngigantic. One could not talk for five minutes with Labouchere and fail\r\nto know, even if they had never met before, that Labouchere was a man\r\nborn and trained to the ways of what is called good society; Bradlaugh\r\nwas evidently a child of the people, who had led a hard and roughening\r\nlife, and had had to make his way by sheer toil and unceasing exertion.\r\nBradlaugh as a public speaker was powerful and commanding in his\r\npeculiar style--the style of the workingman's platform and of the\r\nopen-air meetings in Hyde Park. He had tremendous lungs, a voice of\r\nsurprising power and volume, and his speeches were all attuned to the\r\ntone of open-air declamation. Most observers, even among those who\r\nthoroughly recognized his great intellectual power and his command of\r\nlanguage, would have taken it for granted beforehand that he never could\r\nsuit himself to the atmosphere of the House of Commons. Labouchere's\r\nspeeches, even when delivered to a large public meeting, were pitched in\r\na conversational key, and he never attempted a declamatory flight. His\r\nspeeches within the House of Commons and outside it always sparkled with\r\ndroll and humorous illustrations, and when he was most in earnest he\r\nseemed to be making a joke of the whole business. Bradlaugh was always\r\nterribly in earnest, and seemed as if he were determined to bear down\r\nall opposition by the power of his arguments and the volume of his\r\nvoice. In Labouchere you always found the man accustomed to the polished\r\nways of diplomatic circles; in Bradlaugh one saw the typical champion of\r\nthe oppressed working class. Labouchere comes, as his name would\r\nsuggest, from a French Huguenot family of old standing; Bradlaugh was\r\nthoroughly British in style even when he advocated opinions utterly\r\nopposed to those of the average Briton.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is, on the whole, a fair-minded assembly, and even\r\nthose who were most uncompromising in their hostility to some of\r\nBradlaugh's views came soon to recognize that by his election to\r\nParliament the House had obtained a new and powerful debater. Both men\r\nsoon won recognition from the House for their very different\r\ncharacteristics as debaters, and at one time I think that the\r\ncollege-bred country gentlemen of the Tory ranks were inclined, on the\r\nwhole, to find more fault with Labouchere than with Bradlaugh. They\r\nseemed willing to make allowances for Bradlaugh which they would not\r\nmake for his colleague in the representation of Northampton. One can\r\nimagine their reasoning out the matter somewhat in this way: This man\r\nBradlaugh comes from the working class, is not in any sense belonging to\r\nour order, and we must take all that into account; while this other man,\r\nLabouchere, is of our own class, has had his education at Eton, has been\r\ntrained among diplomatists in foreign courts, is in fact a gentleman,\r\nand yet is constantly proclaiming his hostility to all the established\r\ninstitutions of his native country. Even the Tory country gentlemen,\r\nhowever, found it impossible wholly to resist the wit, the sarcasms, and\r\nthe droll humors of Labouchere, and whenever he spoke in the House he\r\nwas sure to have attentive listeners on all the rows of benches.\r\n\r\nBradlaugh's actual Parliamentary career did not last very long. When he\r\nwas first elected for Northampton, he refused to take the oath of\r\nallegiance, on the ground that he could not truthfully make that appeal\r\nto the higher power with which the oath concludes. He was willing to\r\nmake an affirmation, but the majority of the House would not accept the\r\ncompromise. A considerable period of struggle intervened. The seat was\r\ndeclared to be vacant, but Mr. Bradlaugh was promptly re-elected by the\r\nconstituents of Northampton, and then there set in a dispute between\r\nthe House and the constituency something like that which, in the days of\r\nDaniel O'Connell, ended in Catholic emancipation. Bradlaugh was enabled\r\nto enter the House in 1886, and he made himself very conspicuous in\r\ndebate. His manners were remarkably courteous, and he became popular\r\nafter a while even among those who held his political and religious\r\nopinions in the utmost abhorrence. His career was closed in 1891 by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nI can well remember my first meeting with Henry Labouchere. It was at a\r\ndinner party given by my friend Sir John R. Robinson, then and until\r\nquite lately manager of the London \"Daily News.\" The dinner was given at\r\nthe Reform Club, and took place, I think, some time before Labouchere's\r\nelection for Northampton. I had never seen Labouchere before that time,\r\nand had somehow failed to learn his name before we sat down to dinner.\r\nWe were not a large party, and the conversation was general. I was soon\r\nimpressed by the vivid and unstrained humor of Labouchere's talk and by\r\nthe peculiarity of his manner. He spoke his sentences in quiet, slow,\r\nand even languid tones; there was nothing whatever of the \"agreeable\r\nrattle\" in his demeanor; he had no appearance of any determination to be\r\namusing, or even consciousness of any power to amuse. He always spoke\r\nwithout effort and with the air of one who would just as soon have\r\nremained silent if he did not happen to have something to say, and\r\nwhatever he did say in his languorous tones was sure to hold the\r\nattention and to delight the humorous faculties of every listener. My\r\ncuriosity was quickly aroused and promptly satisfied as to the identity\r\nof this delightful talker, and thus began my acquaintanceship with\r\nLabouchere, which has lasted ever since, and is, I hope, likely to last\r\nfor some time longer. Labouchere is a wonderful teller of stories drawn\r\nfrom his various experiences in many parts of the world, and, unlike\r\nmost other story-tellers, he is never heard to repeat an anecdote,\r\nunless when he was especially invited to do so for the benefit of some\r\none who had not had an opportunity of hearing it before. If he were only\r\na teller of good stories and an utterer of witty sayings, he would well\r\ndeserve a place in the social history of England during our times; but\r\nLabouchere's skill as a talker is one of his least considerable claims\r\nupon public attention. Nature endowed Labouchere with what might be\r\ncalled a fighting spirit, and I believe that whenever he sees any\r\nparticular cause or body of men apparently put under conditions of\r\ndisadvantage, his first instinctive inclination is to make himself its\r\nadvocate, so far at least as to insist that the cause or the men must\r\nhave a fair hearing.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons it could not have happened very often that Henry\r\nLabouchere was found on the side of the strong battalions. I know that\r\nduring the heaviest and the fiercest struggles of the Irish National\r\nparty against coercive laws and in favor of Ireland's demand for Home\r\nRule, Henry Labouchere was always found voting with us in the division\r\nlobby. Some of those days were very dark indeed. Before Gladstone had\r\nbecome converted to the principle of Home Rule for Ireland, and before\r\nthe later changes in the system of Parliamentary representation had\r\ngiven an extended popular suffrage to the Irish constituencies, the\r\nnumber of Irish representatives who followed the leadership of Charles\r\nStewart Parnell was for many sessions not more than seven or eight.\r\nThere were some English members who always voted with us, and\r\nconspicuous and constant among these were Sir Wilfred Lawson and Henry\r\nLabouchere. Unquestionably neither Labouchere nor Lawson had anything\r\nwhatever to gain in Parliamentary or worldly sense by identifying\r\nhimself with our efforts in the House of Commons. As soon as Ireland got\r\nher fair share of the popular franchise, Parnell was followed by some\r\neighty or ninety members out of the hundred and three who constitute the\r\nwhole Irish representation. This was the very fact which first brought\r\nGladstone, as I heard from his own lips, to see that the demand of\r\nIreland was in every sense a thoroughly national demand, and that the\r\nwhole principle of the British constitution claimed for it the\r\nconsideration of genuine statesmanship. Labouchere had identified\r\nhimself with the national cause in the days before that cause had yet\r\nfound anything like representation in the House of Commons. Through all\r\nhis political career he remained faithful to that principle of\r\nnationality, and in the time--I hope not distant--when the Irish claim\r\nfor Home Rule is recognized and accepted by the British Parliament,\r\nIreland is not likely to forget that Henry Labouchere was one of the\r\nvery few English members who recognized and championed her claim in the\r\nhour when almost every man's hand was against it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the inborn spirit of adventure which makes itself so apparent in\r\nLabouchere's temperament and career may have had something to do with\r\nhis championship of the oppressed. I do not say this with any intention\r\nto disparage Labouchere's genuine desire to uphold what he believes to\r\nbe the right, but only to illustrate the peculiarities of his nature.\r\nCertainly his love of adventure has made itself conspicuous and\r\nimpressive at many stages of his varied career. There is a legend to the\r\neffect that Labouchere joined at one time the company of a traveling\r\ncircus in the United States for the novelty and amusement of the\r\nenterprise. I do not know whether there is any truth in this story, but\r\nI should certainly be quite prepared to believe it on anything like\r\nauthentic evidence. The adventure would seem quite in keeping with the\r\ntemper of the man. Most of us know what happened when the Germans were\r\nbesieging Paris during the war of 1870. It suddenly occurred to\r\nLabouchere that it would be a most interesting chapter in a man's life\r\nif he were to spend the winter in the besieged city. No sooner said, or\r\nthought, than done. Labouchere was then one of the proprietors of the\r\nLondon \"Daily News,\" and he announced his determination to undertake the\r\ntask of representing that journal in Paris as long as the siege should\r\nlast. Of course he obtained full authority for the purpose, and he\r\ncontrived to make his way into Paris, and when there he relieved the\r\nregular correspondent of the \"Daily News\" from his wearisome and\r\nperilous work by sending him off, in a balloon, I believe, to Tours,\r\nwhere he was out of the range of the German forces, and could continue\r\nhis daily survey of events in general. Then Labouchere set himself down\r\nto enjoy all the hardships of the siege, to live on the flesh of horse\r\nand donkey and even cat and rat, to endure the setting in of utter\r\ndarkness when once the sun had gone down, and to chronicle a daily\r\naccount of his strange experiences. This was accomplished in his \"Diary\r\nof a Besieged Resident,\" which appeared from day to day in the columns\r\nof the \"Daily News,\" and was afterwards published as a volume, and a\r\nmost entertaining, humorous, realistic, and delightful volume it made.\r\nThe very difficulties of its transmission by means of balloons and\r\npigeons and other such floating or flying agencies must have been a\r\nconstant source of amusement and excitement to the adventurous besieged\r\nresident.\r\n\r\nLabouchere has always been in the habit of seeking excitement by\r\nenterprises on the Stock Exchange. I do not believe that these ventures\r\nhave been made with the commonplace desire to make money, but I can\r\nquite understand that they are prompted by the very same desire for new\r\nexperiences which prompted the residence in besieged Paris. I remember\r\nmeeting Labouchere one day many years ago in a West End London street,\r\nand being told by him that he had just incurred a very heavy loss by one\r\nof his financial ventures on the Stock Exchange. He told me in his usual\r\ntones of almost apathetic languor the amount of his loss, and it seemed\r\nto my modest experiences in money affairs to be a positive fortune\r\nsacrificed. He was smiling blandly while recounting his adventure, and I\r\ncould not help asking him how he had felt when the loss was first made\r\nknown to him. \"Well,\" he replied, in the same good-humored tone, \"it was\r\nan experience, like another.\" That, I think, is a fair illustration of\r\nLabouchere's governing mood. The great thing was to get a new\r\nsensation. At one time Labouchere became the founder and the owner of a\r\nnew theater in London, and he took part in many a newspaper enterprise.\r\nHe was, as I have said, for a long time one of the proprietors of the\r\n\"Daily News,\" and he entered into that proprietorship at the very time\r\nwhen the \"Daily News\" was making itself most unpopular in capitalist\r\ncircles and in what is known as society, by its resolute and manly\r\nadherence to the side of the Federal States during the great American\r\nCivil War. It suited Labouchere's pluck and temper to join in such an\r\nundertaking at the time when the odds seemed all against it; and it is\r\nonly fair to say that I am sure no love for a new sensation could induce\r\nLabouchere to take up any cause which he did not believe to be the cause\r\nof right.\r\n\r\nLabouchere was one of those who went in with the late Edmund Yates in\r\nfounding \"The World,\" then quite a new venture as a society journal.\r\nLabouchere, however, did not long remain a sharer in this enterprise.\r\nYates was the editor of the paper, and Yates went in altogether for\r\nsatirical or at least amusing pictures of West End life, and did not\r\ncare anything about politics and the struggles of this or that\r\npolitical movement. Labouchere could not settle down to any interest in\r\na newspaper which dealt only with changes of fashion and the\r\nwhimsicalities of social life. His close interest in political questions\r\nfilled him with the resolve to start a journal which, while dealing with\r\nthe personages and the ways of society, should also be the organ of his\r\nown views on graver subjects. He therefore withdrew from all concern in\r\nEdmund Yates's \"World\" and started his own weekly newspaper, \"Truth,\"\r\nwhich has since enjoyed a life of vigor and success. There is room\r\nenough for both papers apparently. The \"World\" has not lost its circle\r\nof readers, while \"Truth\" is beyond question a great power in political\r\nand financial as well as in social movements.\r\n\r\nOne of Labouchere's special delights is to expose in \"Truth\" some\r\nsuccessful adventurer in pretentious financial schemes, some\r\nhypocritical projector of sham philanthropic institutions, some\r\ncharlatan with whom, because of his temporary influence and success,\r\nmost other people are unwilling to try conclusions. Such an impostor is\r\njust the sort of man whom Labouchere is delighted to encounter.\r\nLabouchere's plan is simple and straightforward. He publishes an\r\narticle in \"Truth\" containing the most direct and explicit charges of\r\nimposture and fraud against the man whom he has determined to expose,\r\nand he invites this man to bring an action against him in a court of law\r\nand obtain damages, if he can, for slander. Labouchere usually intimates\r\npolitely that he will not avail himself of any preliminary and technical\r\nforms which might interpose unnecessary delay, and that he will do all\r\nin his power as defendant to facilitate and hasten the trial of the\r\naction. It happens in many or most cases that the personage thus invited\r\nto appeal to a court of law cautiously refrains from accepting the\r\ninvitation. He knows that Labouchere has plenty of money, perceives that\r\nhe is not to be frightened out of his allegations, and probably thinks\r\nthe safest course is to treat \"Truth\" and its owner with silent\r\ncontempt. Sometimes, however, the accused man accepts battle in a court\r\nof law, and the attention of the public is riveted on the hearing of the\r\ncase. Perhaps Labouchere fails to make out every one of his charges, and\r\nthen the result is formally against him and he may be cast in damages,\r\nbut he cares nothing for the cost and is probably well satisfied with\r\nthe knowledge that he has directed the full criticism of the public to\r\nthe general character of his opponent's doings and has made it\r\nimpossible for the opponent to work much harm in the future. Even the\r\nstrongest political antagonists of Labouchere have been found ready to\r\nadmit that he has rendered much service to the public by his resolute\r\nefforts to expose shams and quackeries of various kinds at whatever\r\npecuniary risk or cost to himself.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it would be quite consistent with the realities of\r\nthe situation if I were to describe Labouchere as a favorite in the\r\nHouse of Commons. He has provoked so many enmities, he has made so many\r\nenemies by his sharp sarcasms, his unsparing ridicule, and his sometimes\r\nrather heedless personalities, that a great many members of the House\r\nmust be kept in a state of chronic indignation towards him. A man who\r\narouses a feeling of this kind and keeps it alive among a considerable\r\nnumber of his brother members could hardly be described with strict\r\njustice as a favorite in the House of Commons. Yet it is quite certain\r\nthat there is no man in the House whose sayings are listened to with a\r\nkeener interest, and whose presence would be more generally missed if\r\nhe were to retire from public life.\r\n\r\nOne of the many stories which I have heard about Labouchere's peculiar\r\nways when he was in the diplomatic service is worth repeating here. It\r\nhas never been contradicted, so far as I know. When Labouchere was\r\nattaché to the British Legation at Washington--it was then only a\r\nLegation--his room was invaded one day by an indignant John Bull, fresh\r\nfrom England, who had some grievance to bring under the notice of the\r\nBritish Minister. That eminent personage was not then in the house, and\r\nthe man with the grievance was shown into Labouchere's room. Labouchere\r\nwas smoking a cigarette, according to his custom, and he received the\r\nvisitor blandly, but without any effusive welcome. John Bull declared\r\nthat he must see the Minister at once, and Labouchere mildly responded\r\nthat the British Minister was not in the Legation buildings. \"When will\r\nhe return?\" was the next demand, to which Labouchere could only make\r\nanswer that he really did not know. \"Then,\" declared the resolute\r\nBritish citizen, \"I have only to say that I shall wait here until he\r\nreturns.\" Labouchere signified his full concurrence with this proposal,\r\nand graciously invited his countryman to take a chair, and then went on\r\nwith his reading and noting of letters and his cigarette just as before.\r\nHours glided away, and no further word was exchanged. At last the hour\r\ncame for closing the official rooms, and Labouchere began to put on his\r\ncoat and make preparations for a speedy departure. The visitor thereupon\r\nsaw that the time had come for some decided movement on his part, and he\r\nsternly put to Labouchere the question, \"Can you tell me where the\r\nBritish Minister is just now?\" Labouchere replied, with his usual\r\nunruffled composure, \"I really cannot tell you exactly where he is just\r\nnow, but I should think he must be nearly halfway across the Atlantic,\r\nas he left New York for England last Saturday.\" Up rose John Bull in\r\nfierce indignation, and exclaimed, \"You never told me that he had left\r\nfor England.\" \"You never asked me the question,\" Labouchere made answer,\r\nwith undisturbed urbanity, and the visitor had nothing for it but to go\r\noff in storm.\r\n\r\nLabouchere is the possessor of a beautiful and historic residence on the\r\nbanks of the Thames--Pope's famous villa at Twickenham. There he is in\r\nthe habit of entertaining his friends during the summer months, and\r\nthere one is sure to meet an interesting and amusing company. I have had\r\nthe pleasure of being his guest many times, and I need hardly say that I\r\nhave always found such visits delightful. Labouchere is a most charming\r\nhost, and although he is himself a wonderful talker, full of anecdote\r\nand reminiscence, he never fails to see that the conversation is\r\nthoroughly diffused, and that no guest is left out of the talk. In\r\nLondon he always mixes freely with society, and his London home is ever\r\nhospitable. Many of his friends were strongly of opinion that he ought\r\nto have been invited to become a member of a Liberal administration. I\r\nsuppose, however, that most of the solid and steady personages who form\r\na Cabinet would have been rather alarmed at the idea of so daring and\r\ndamaging a free lance being appointed to a high place in the official\r\nranks of a Government, and it would have been out of the question to\r\nthink of offering any subordinate position to so brilliant a master of\r\nParliamentary debate. For myself I do not feel any regret that\r\nLabouchere, so far, has not taken any place in an administration. He has\r\nmade his fame as a free lance, and has done efficient public work in\r\nthat capacity, such as he could hardly have accomplished if he had been\r\nset down to the regular and routine duties of an official post. He has\r\nmade a name for himself by his independent support of every cause and\r\nmovement which he believed to have justice on its side, and I could not\r\nthink with any satisfaction of a so-called promotion which must submerge\r\nhis individuality in the measured counsels and compromises of a number\r\nof administrative colleagues. I prefer still to think of him as Henry\r\nLabouchere, and not as the Right Honorable Gentleman at the head of\r\nthis, that, or the other department of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by London Stereoscopic Co.\r\n\r\nJOHN MORLEY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MORLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo English public man of the present day has had a more remarkable\r\npolitical career than that of John Morley. Almost everything that could\r\nbe against success in political life was against John Morley when he\r\narose from the student's desk to take his place on the political\r\nplatform. I am not now making any allusion to the difficulties set in a\r\nman's way by those accidents which the first Lord Lytton described\r\ngrandiloquently as the \"twin gaolers of the human heart, low birth and\r\niron fortune.\" I am not quite certain what iron fortune may be, but if I\r\nassume it to be early poverty I do not regard it as a very formidable\r\nobstruction to human genius in our times. We have many successful men in\r\npublic life just now who were born in humble station and had to struggle\r\nhard for a long time against poverty. John Morley was not born in humble\r\nlife, as the phrase goes, and had not, so far as I know, to struggle\r\nagainst early poverty. He had an Oxford University education and was\r\ncalled to the bar, but did not make any effort after success in that\r\nprofession. The difficulties to which I have alluded as standing in his\r\nway when he determined to seek a career in political and Parliamentary\r\nlife had nothing to do with birth and with poverty--they were of quite a\r\ndifferent order.\r\n\r\nMorley had taken to literature as a profession, and had made for himself\r\na distinguished name as a writer of books and an editor of reviews and\r\nnewspapers before he obtained a seat in the House of Commons. Now, there\r\nis, or used to be, a sort of fixed belief in the British public mind\r\nthat a literary man is not, in the nature of things, qualified for\r\nsuccess in Parliamentary work. We are somewhat getting over this idea of\r\nlate, and indeed there were at all times living evidences enough to\r\nshake such a faith. The generation which recognized the success won in\r\nParliamentary debate by a Macaulay, a Disraeli, and a Bulwer-Lytton\r\nmight well have got over the notion that literary men cannot succeed in\r\nParliament; but even up to the time of John Morley's election to the\r\nHouse of Commons the idea found still a very general acceptation.\r\nAnother and much more serious difficulty in John Morley's way was the\r\nfact that he was a proclaimed agnostic in questions of religious faith.\r\nNow, the average Englishman can hardly be described as one imbued with\r\nprofound and exalted religious convictions, but it may be taken for\r\ngranted that he thinks every respectable person who is fit to be a\r\nmember of Parliament ought to conform to some recognized creed and to\r\nattend some authorized place of worship. John Morley was at one time not\r\nmerely an agnostic, but an avowed and somewhat aggressive agnostic, and\r\nhis brilliant pen had often been employed to deal satirically with some\r\nestablished doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn England there is little or no general objection to freedom of opinion\r\nso long as it is a question merely of opinion. We may know that a man\r\nholds free-thinking opinions, but we feel no wish to inflict any manner\r\nof punishment or deprivation on him so long as he keeps his opinions to\r\nhimself and does not endeavor to make them prevail with others. This,\r\nhowever, was what John Morley had got into the way of doing. When he\r\nfelt a strong conviction on any subject which seemed to him important,\r\nhe always endeavored to justify his faith by argument and to bring\r\nothers round to his views of the question.\r\n\r\nI can well remember that many of Morley's admirers and friends were but\r\nlittle gratified when it was first made known that he intended to seek\r\nfor a seat in the House of Commons. Their impression was that he was\r\njust then doing in effective and admirable style the very kind of work\r\nfor which he was best qualified, and that it was a pity he should run\r\nthe risk of marring such a career for the sake of entering a political\r\nfield in which he might possibly win no success, and in which success,\r\neven if won, would be poor compensation for the sacrifice of better\r\nwork. Morley, however, seems to have made up his mind, even at an early\r\nperiod of his career, that he would try his chance in Parliament. So\r\nlong ago as 1865 he became a candidate for a constituency in the North\r\nof England, but was not successful; and in 1880, after he had won\r\ngenuine celebrity by his biography of Edmund Burke, that of Voltaire,\r\nthat of Rousseau, and other books of the same order, he became a\r\ncandidate for the great metropolitan division of Westminster. Here\r\nagain he was unsuccessful, and it was only in 1883 that he first\r\nobtained a seat in the House of Commons as the representative of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. I can well remember listening with the deepest\r\ninterest to his maiden speech in the House of Commons. The general\r\nimpression of the House was that the speech would prove a failure, for\r\nonly too many members had already made up their minds, according to the\r\nusual fashion of the day, that a successful literary man was not likely\r\nto become a Parliamentary success. There was a common impression also\r\nthat, despite his great gifts as a writer and his proved capacity as a\r\njournalist and editor, John Morley must be an impracticable sort of\r\nperson. He had been at one time well known as an associate of the famous\r\nPositivist order of thinkers--the order to which men like Frederic\r\nHarrison and Richard Congreve belonged. The average member of Parliament\r\ncould see no chance for a disciple of that school, which this average\r\nmember regarded merely as a group of dreamers, to make any mark in a\r\npractical assembly where the routine business of legislation had to be\r\ncarried on. Morley's speech was, however, a distinct and unmistakable\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWhat first impressed the House of Commons was the ready, quiet force of\r\nMorley's delivery. He had a fine, clear voice, he spoke without notes\r\nand without any manifest evidence of preparation, every sentence\r\nexpressed without effort the precise meaning which he wished to convey,\r\nand his style had an eloquence peculiarly its own. What most men\r\nexpected of him was the philosophical discourse of a student and a\r\nthinker no longer in his fitting place, and what was least expected of\r\nhim was just that which he delivered, a ready, telling, and powerful\r\nParliamentary speech. He had some unexpected difficulties to encounter,\r\nbecause he gave out his opinions so forcibly and so boldly that their\r\nutterance called forth frequent interruptions--an unusual event in the\r\ncase of a maiden speech, which is generally regarded as a mere\r\nintroductory ceremonial and is taken politely as a necessary matter of\r\nform. The House soon found, however, that John Morley's speech did not\r\nby any means belong to the ordinary category of maiden performances, and\r\nthe very interruptions were therefore a positive tribute to the\r\nimportance of the new member's argument. The interruptions were in every\r\nsense fortunate for Morley, because they enabled him at this very first\r\nopportunity to prove his ready capacity for debate. He replied on the\r\nspur of the moment to every interruption and every interjected question,\r\nand he showed all the composure, all the promptitude and the command, of\r\na practiced Parliamentary debater. Every man in the House whose opinion\r\nwas worth having at once recognized the fact that a new force had come\r\nup in Parliamentary debate, and when John Morley resumed his seat he\r\nmust have known that he had accomplished a complete success. From that\r\ntime onward John Morley has always been recognized as one of the most\r\npowerful speakers in the House of Commons. His voice is clear, resonant,\r\nand musical, the light of intellect gleams in his earnest eyes, his\r\nargument is always well sustained and set off with varied and\r\nappropriate illustration, and whenever he rises to speak he is sure to\r\nhave a deeply attentive audience.\r\n\r\nMorley is not in the highest sense one of the orators of Parliament. He\r\nis not to be classed, and has never sought to be classed, with such men\r\nas Gladstone and Bright. But, short of the highest gift of eloquence, he\r\nhas every quality needed to make a great Parliamentary debater. When he\r\naddresses the House of Commons, one ceases to think of him merely as\r\nthe scholar and the author, and he becomes the man who can command the\r\nHouse by the arguments and the eloquence which the House best\r\nunderstands. There are many men of high intellectual capacity who\r\noccasionally take part in a Parliamentary debate and who are always\r\nregarded as in the House but not of it. John Morley proved from his very\r\nfirst effort that he was of the House as well as in it. I have heard him\r\nmake great platform speeches, and I think he comes nearer to the highest\r\norder of eloquence when addressing an ordinary political meeting than\r\neven when addressing the House, but it is quite certain that at the\r\npresent time the House of Commons has no member who can more completely\r\ncommand its attention. It must be said, too, that the character of the\r\nman himself, his transparent sincerity, his absolute devotedness to\r\nprinciple, his fearless and unselfish consistency, count for much in the\r\ncommanding position which he has obtained. The integrity of Morley's\r\ncareer is absolutely beyond criticism or cavil. It never entered into\r\nthe mind of his bitterest opponent to suspect for a moment that Morley\r\ncould be influenced by any personal consideration in the course which he\r\ntook or the words which he uttered. Other men of high position in\r\nParliament are commonly set down as having taken this or that course,\r\nmodified or suppressed this or that opinion, for the sake of personal\r\nadvancement, or at least for the sake of maintaining the interests of a\r\nparty. But everybody knows that John Morley has never sought for office,\r\nand could never be induced to make any compromise of political principle\r\neven for the sake of maintaining in power the political party to which\r\nhe belongs. The universal recognition of that great quality in him has\r\nadded unspeakably to his influence in Parliament. He was not at any time\r\na frequent speaker in the House of Commons, and of course he never was a\r\nmere talker. He speaks only when he has something to say which he\r\nbelieves ought to be said and to be said by him, and he never seems to\r\nhave any temptation to enter into debate for the mere pleasure of taking\r\npart in the controversy. If a man is really a good speaker, the House is\r\nalways ready to listen to him no matter how often he may speak, for the\r\nplain reason that debate has to go on for a certain number of hours each\r\nday, and it is more pleasant to listen to a member who talks well than\r\nto one who talks badly. But, no matter how effective and eloquent a\r\nspeaker may be, it is quite certain that the House will give him a more\r\nattentive ear if it knows beforehand that whenever he rises to take part\r\nin debate it is sure to hear something which up to that moment has not\r\nbeen spoken. John Morley, therefore, very soon became one of that small\r\nbody of men in the House of Commons whose rising to speak is always\r\nregarded as an event of interest and importance.\r\n\r\nIn the retrospect of John Morley's career one is brought up with\r\nsomething approaching to a shock of surprise when he remembers that at\r\nthe opening of Morley's Parliamentary life he was closely associated\r\nwith Joseph Chamberlain. I remember having heard people say at the time\r\nthat Chamberlain took much credit to himself on the ground that he had\r\nurged and prevailed upon John Morley to persevere in seeking a seat in\r\nthe House of Commons. Mr. Chamberlain was at that time an extreme and\r\nuncompromising Radical. He was an avowed and constant supporter of the\r\nHome Rule party; was in close alliance with Parnell; took a leading part\r\nin the arrangement of the so-called Kilmainham Treaty, and delivered a\r\nwarm panegyric on Parnell himself and Parnell's policy to a crowded and\r\nfor the most part an indignant House of Commons. There was, therefore,\r\nnothing surprising in the fact that Morley and Chamberlain were at that\r\ntime friends and allies in political affairs, nor had any one then the\r\nfaintest reason to believe that Chamberlain was ever destined to undergo\r\na sudden and miraculous conversion to ultra-Tory principles. When Mr.\r\nGladstone came into office in 1886 with what was known to be a Home Rule\r\nadministration, John Morley obtained the position of Chief Secretary to\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet. It is not by\r\nany means a matter of course that the Irish Chief Secretary should be a\r\nCabinet Minister. Sometimes the Lord-Lieutenant himself has a place in\r\nthe Cabinet and the Chief Secretary is merely an ordinary member of the\r\nGovernment; sometimes, when the Chief Secretary is regarded as a very\r\nstrong man, he is invited to a seat in the Cabinet and his official\r\nmaster remains outside. John Morley was recognized from the first by\r\nGladstone as a man of the highest political capacity and character, and\r\nwhen the new administration came to be formed Gladstone made evident\r\nthis estimate of Morley by offering him a place in the Cabinet. The\r\nkeenest interest was felt alike both by political friends and political\r\nenemies in Morley's management of Irish affairs. The new Secretary for\r\nIreland was entering bravely on an enterprise the immediate success of\r\nwhich was, under the conditions, absolutely impossible. I have no doubt\r\nwhatever that success could have been easily and completely accomplished\r\nif John Morley had been allowed his own way in dealing with the whole\r\nIrish question--if, for instance, he had been placed in such a position\r\nof dictatorship as that which was given to Lord Durham when Durham was\r\nsent out to deal with the rebellion in Canada. Durham saw but one remedy\r\nfor the long discontents and troubles of the Canadian populations, and\r\nthat remedy he found in the system of Home Rule which has since made\r\nCanada peaceful, prosperous, and well content with the place she holds\r\nin the British Empire. If John Morley could have been invested with such\r\npowers as those given to Lord Durham, he might have made of Ireland\r\nanother prosperous and contented Canada. But Morley had to administer\r\nthe affairs of Ireland at a time when the opinion of the English\r\nmajority had not yet risen to the principle of Home Rule, at least so\r\nfar as Ireland was concerned, and without such recognition it was beyond\r\nthe reach of statesmanship to satisfy the national demands of the Irish\r\npeople. Every Irish Nationalist knew perfectly well that John Morley's\r\nheart and intellect alike were with the cause of Irish Home Rule. All\r\nthat Morley could do to mitigate the troubles of the country and the\r\npeople he did bravely and steadfastly. Ireland was then the victim of an\r\naccumulation of coercion laws which made almost every popular movement,\r\nevery attempt to maintain an oppressed tenant against an oppressive\r\nlandlord, every protest against despotic legislation, liable to be\r\ntreated as an offense calling for the interference of the police. John\r\nMorley did all that could be done to mitigate the rigors of such a\r\nsystem, and to administer Ireland on something like the principles of\r\ncivilization and freedom. He had in this task the full support,\r\nencouragement, and sympathy of the statesman who was then\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland--the Earl of Aberdeen, a man of the most\r\nthoroughly Liberal principles and a sincere friend to Ireland. But, of\r\ncourse, neither Lord Aberdeen nor John Morley could abolish at a word\r\nof command a whole system of penal legislation, and all that could be\r\ndone was to take care that the laws should be administered in a\r\ntemperate and reasonable spirit, and that the rulers of Ireland should\r\nshow themselves to be at heart the friends of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere comes back to my memory a somewhat curious illustration of the\r\ndifficulties which then stood in the way of any cordial intercourse\r\nbetween the representatives of English rule in Ireland and the\r\nrepresentatives of the Irish national cause, and I cannot resist the\r\ntemptation to tell the story here. During Morley's first term of office\r\nas Chief Secretary I made some visits to Dublin. I had many meetings\r\nwith Morley, of course, and he invited me to dine with him at the Chief\r\nSecretary's Lodge in Phoenix Park. Now, there had been during all my\r\ntime a rigorous rule among Irish Nationalists not to accept any of the\r\nhospitalities of those who exercised imperial authority in Dublin. No\r\ntrue Nationalist would make one at any social gathering in the official\r\nresidence of the Viceroy or the Chief Secretary. There were more than\r\nmerely sentimental reasons for such a principle. In former days the\r\nIrish people had in several well-remembered instances seen some vehement\r\nadvocate of the Irish National cause won over by the promises and the\r\nblandishments of Dublin Castle to take office under the Government and\r\nto renounce the political faith the profession of which had won for him\r\nhis seat in Parliament. Therefore it was above all things necessary, in\r\norder to maintain the confidence of the Irish people, that the national\r\nrepresentatives should show themselves determined not to be drawn into\r\nany familiar social relations with the representatives of English rule\r\nin Ireland. This was especially a part of Parnell's policy, and on it\r\nParnell laid much stress. John Morley came over to Ireland in a spirit\r\nof full friendship towards the Irish people, and he had every reason to\r\nbelieve that the Irish people thoroughly understood his feelings and his\r\nhopes. He and I had known each other during many years in London, and\r\nwhen we met in Dublin, he, being still new to the conditions of the\r\nplace, invited me to dine with him. I explained to him that, however\r\ndelighted I should be to dine with my friend John Morley, it was quite\r\nimpossible that I should dine with the Chief Secretary at his official\r\nresidence in Dublin. I assured him that if I were to accept such an\r\ninvitation the Tory papers of Dublin would be certain to make\r\ncharacteristic comments on the fact that the Chief Secretary to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant and the Vice-Chairman of the Irish Parliamentary party\r\nhad been dining together in the Chief Secretary's official home, and\r\nthat we should both alike find ourselves the objects of something\r\napproaching to a public scandal. Morley was surprised at first and then\r\na good deal amused, but he accepted my explanation, and thoroughly\r\nunderstood that it was not any want of friendly feeling which led me to\r\ndecline his invitation. So we parted as good friends as ever. We still\r\nmet frequently and talked over questions relating to Irish\r\nadministration. One day Morley came to see me at the Shelburne Hotel,\r\nwhich was then my home in Dublin. We had a long talk, and, as the hour\r\nwas growing late, I asked him to stay and dine with me, not remembering\r\nat the time that the eye of the public was supposed to be on our\r\nmovements. One of Morley's happiest gifts is a delightful sense of\r\nhumor. He rose to the situation at once. Addressing me in solemn tones,\r\nbut with a gleam of the comic in his eyes, he informed me that if my\r\nprinciples did not allow me to dine with the Chief Secretary in Dublin,\r\nso neither did the Chief Secretary's principles allow him to dine there\r\nwith me. Thus, as some newspaper writers would say, the incident\r\nterminated, and we made no further effort at convivial meetings in\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nJohn Morley's quick sense of humor is not one of the qualities which a\r\nstranger would naturally look for in him. Those who have not met him and\r\nhave known him only through his writings are apt to think of him as a\r\ngrave and even an austere man, a man wholly immersed in the serious\r\ncontemplation of life and history, and, if endowed with any sense of\r\nhumor, only with a sense of its more grim and saturnine aspects. The man\r\nhimself is altogether and curiously unlike the impression thus formed of\r\nhim very commonly by those to whom he is not personally known. John\r\nMorley has a quick, keen, and delightful sense of humor. He can talk on\r\nany subject from grave to gay, from lively to severe. He is one of the\r\nmost charming of companions, and he is a great favorite among women,\r\neven among those who do not greatly concern themselves with the question\r\nof woman's political emancipation. There is nothing of the stern\r\nphilosopher about his manner of comporting himself in social life.\r\nIndeed, for all the clear composure of his philosophic contemplations,\r\nhe has a temperament far too quick and sensitive to allow of his meeting\r\nall life's vexatious questions in the mood of stoical endurance. He is\r\nby nature somewhat nervous, is decidedly quick in temper, frankly\r\nacknowledges that he is rather impatient of contradiction, and is likely\r\nto become overheated in the course of an eager argument. I feel the less\r\nhesitation in noticing these little peculiarities on the part of my\r\nfriend because I have heard Morley himself speak of them with perfect\r\nfrankness as some of his troubles in political controversy. I must say\r\nthat, so far as I know, these unphilosophical qualities of Morley's\r\ntemperament only tend to make him all the more a charming friend to his\r\nfriends. We may admire the marble-like composure of the stern\r\nphilosopher who yields to no passing human weaknesses of temper, but it\r\nmust be very hard to keep always on friendly terms with so superhuman a\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\nMr. Morley goes into society a good deal in London, is often to be seen\r\nat the theaters on first nights, seems to enjoy a dinner party or an\r\nevening party as well as the most commonplace among us might do, but I\r\ndo not believe that he has any liking for great shows and pompous\r\ncelebrations and the other formal demonstrations of Court festivity and\r\nMinisterial display. In his quiet London home he leads the life of a man\r\nof culture, a scholar and a writer, so far as his political and\r\nParliamentary engagements allow him leisure for such recreation, and he\r\nneither seeks the madding crowd nor shuns it. It has always been a\r\nwonder to me how such a man can find time for his many and diverse\r\nstudies and occupations, and should never either neglect the work of his\r\nlife or shut himself away from its reasonable enjoyments. John Morley is\r\nindeed a rare and almost unique combination of the philosophical\r\nthinker, the vivid biographer, the Parliamentary debater, and the\r\npractical administrator. His life of Richard Cobden is one of the most\r\ncomplete and characteristic pieces of biography accomplished during our\r\ntime. There would not seem to have been much that was congenial between\r\nthe temperament of Richard Cobden and that of John Morley. Cobden was\r\nnot a laborious student of the past; he had no widespread and varied\r\nliterary or artistic sympathies; he did not concern himself much with\r\nany scientific studies except those which have to do with the actual\r\nmovements of man's working lifetime; he was a great practical reformer,\r\nnot a scholar, a philosopher, or even a devoted lover of books. I do not\r\nknow that John Morley was personally well acquainted with Cobden, and I\r\nam rather inclined to believe that in his biography of the great\r\nfree-trader he relied mainly on Cobden's correspondence and on the\r\ninformation given to him by members of Cobden's family. Yet he has\r\ncreated a perfect living picture of Cobden as Cobden's friends all knew\r\nhim, and he has shown to coming generations, not merely what Cobden said\r\nand did, what great reforms he accomplished, and what further reforms he\r\never had in view, but he has shown what Cobden actually was, and made\r\nthe man himself a familiar figure to all who read the book. So far as I\r\ncan judge, he has achieved the same success when telling us of Burke, of\r\nVoltaire, and of Rousseau, and has made us feel that with his guidance\r\nwe come to know the men themselves as well as the parts they performed\r\nin politics or in literature.\r\n\r\nMorley has for a long time been engaged in preparing his life of\r\nGladstone, and the mind of England, which has lately been distracted by\r\nthe vicissitudes of war, is now free to turn to quieter thoughts, and to\r\nlook with eager expectation for the completion of the book. No other\r\nliving man could have anything like John Morley's qualifications as the\r\nbiographer of Gladstone. He is one of the greatest masters of lucid and\r\nvigorous English prose. He has been what I may call a professional\r\nstudent of the lives of great men; he is a profound political thinker;\r\nand he has the faculty of describing to the life and making his subject\r\nlive again. In addition to all these claims to the position of\r\nGladstone's authorized biographer comes the fact that Morley was for\r\nmany years intrusted with Gladstone's fullest confidence. To no one did\r\nGladstone make his feelings and his purposes on all political questions\r\nmore fully known than to John Morley; and I think I am justified in\r\nsaying that at more than one critical period in his later political\r\nhistory Gladstone chose Morley as his especial and, for the time, his\r\nonly confidant. I can say of my own knowledge that in the later years of\r\nGladstone's active political life there were momentous occasions when\r\nJohn Morley acted as the one sole medium of private communication\r\nbetween Gladstone and the leaders of the Irish party. I know, too, how\r\ncareful and methodical Morley showed himself on all such occasions, and\r\nwith what ample and accurate notes he preserved the exact record of\r\nevery day's intercommunications. This is, indeed, one of Morley's\r\ncharacteristic peculiarities--the combination of exalted thought with\r\nthe most minute attention to the very routine of practical work. That\r\ncombination of qualities will display itself, I feel quite certain, with\r\ncomplete success in Morley's history of Gladstone's life. John Morley\r\nhas still, we may well hope, a long political career before him. When\r\nthe Liberal party next comes into power, John Morley will unquestionably\r\nhave one of its most commanding offices placed at his disposal.\r\nMeanwhile he has ample work on hand even for his energy and\r\nperseverance. He is just finishing his life of Gladstone, and is to take\r\ncharge of the magnificent library which belonged to the late Lord Acton,\r\nthe greatest English scholar and book-lover of our time. Mr. Carnegie's\r\ngift of this great library, lately bought by him, to John Morley, is an\r\nact which does honor to the intellect as well as to the heart of the\r\ngenerous donor. Whatever positions, honors, or responsibilities maybe\r\nyet before John Morley, it may be taken for granted that he has already\r\nwon for himself a secure place in the literature and the political life\r\nof his country, and that his name will live in its history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by William Notman & Son\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF ABERDEEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF ABERDEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Aberdeen will always be associated in my mind with a most\r\nhopeful season of our political life, a season none the less cherished\r\nin memory and none the less auspicious because its hopes were doomed to\r\ntemporary disappointment. That bright season was the time when Mr.\r\nGladstone was endeavoring to carry out his policy of Home Rule for\r\nIreland. I need hardly tell my American readers that Gladstone's policy\r\nwas condemned to failure, partly because of a secession of Liberals who\r\nwent over to the Conservative ranks for the purpose of opposing the\r\nmeasure, and then because of the attitude taken by the House of Lords,\r\nwho, thus encouraged, rejected the bill after it had passed the House of\r\nCommons. The season, therefore, which I am now recalling to memory was\r\nthat which came between Mr. Gladstone's promulgation of his Home Rule\r\npolicy and the rejection of his second measure of Home Rule. The\r\ninterval was one full of the brightest hopes for all true British\r\nLiberals and all Irish Nationalists. For the first time during my\r\nrecollection, British Liberalism and Irish Nationalism were in true\r\ncompanionship and concord. We fraternized as English and Irish\r\npoliticians had probably never fraternized before. On both sides we were\r\nfilled with the fond belief that the disunion of Great Britain and\r\nIreland was soon to come to an end, and that the true and lasting union\r\nof the two peoples would be accomplished by Gladstone's policy of giving\r\nto Ireland her national self-government. It was a season of much\r\nfestivity in London, and the Irish Nationalist members of Parliament\r\nwere welcome guests in all the great Liberals' houses. No figures are\r\nmore thoroughly associated in my memory with that time than those of\r\nLord Aberdeen and his gifted and noble-minded wife.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen is the grandson of that Earl of Aberdeen whose coalition\r\nministry, a luckless effort at a temporary compromise between hostile\r\npolitical forces, came to a disastrous end during the Crimean War. The\r\npresent Earl succeeded to the title in 1870. He was educated at the\r\nUniversity of St. Andrews, in Scotland, and afterwards at University\r\nCollege, Oxford. Lord Aberdeen was a Conservative in his political\r\nprinciples when he entered the House of Lords. But he had too much\r\nintellect and too much independence of mind to remain long in\r\nsubserviency to the traditional creed of a mere party. He differed from\r\nhis leaders on several important questions before he had fully seen his\r\nway to take up his position as a recognized member of the Liberal\r\norganization. Most of us who had followed his career thus far with any\r\nattention felt sure that the Conservatives would not long be able to\r\nkeep such a man among their slow-going and unenlightened ranks, and no\r\nsurprise was felt on either side when he took his natural place as a\r\nfollower of Mr. Gladstone. Lord Aberdeen became an earnest advocate of\r\nthe Home Rule policy, and all the noble influence that he and his wife\r\ncould bring to bear publicly and privately was exerted in support of the\r\ncause. Then it was that I first came to know Lord and Lady Aberdeen. I\r\nhave before me just now a book called \"Notables of Britain,\" described\r\non its title-page as \"An Album of Portraits and Autographs of the Most\r\nEminent Subjects of Her Majesty in the Sixtieth Year of Her Reign.\" This\r\nbook was published at the office of the \"Review of Reviews,\" and was\r\nunderstood to be the production of Mr. W. T. Stead. It contains an\r\nexcellent full-length photograph of Lord Aberdeen, who, I may say, has a\r\nface and figure well worthy to be preserved by painter and photographer\r\nfor the benefit of those who in coming days are interested in the\r\nnotables of Britain. The portrait, like all the other portraits in the\r\nvolume, is accompanied by an autograph line or two. Lord Aberdeen's\r\nwritten words seem to me peculiarly characteristic of the writer's\r\nbright and hopeful spirit. I quote his words--the writing is clear and\r\nwell formed:--\r\n\r\n    I think this is a good motto:\r\n      \"_Transeunt nubes--manet cælum._\"\r\n                                        ABERDEEN.\r\n\r\nThe temper in which Lord Aberdeen conducted all his political\r\nintercourse during this period of promise was one of unchanging courage\r\nand hopefulness. He was one of the most active and ready among the\r\nsupporters of Mr. Gladstone, and he found an untiring and invaluable\r\ncompanion in his charming wife. At that time we used to hold political\r\ngatherings in private houses as well as in public halls, and I have\r\ntaken part in more than one Home Rule demonstration held in the private\r\ndwellings of some of Mr. Gladstone's colleagues in office. We used to\r\nhave many social meetings for the purpose of bringing Englishmen and\r\nIrishmen into close association. Even Parnell himself was prevailed upon\r\nto abandon for the time his rule of seclusion from society, and to meet\r\nMr. Gladstone and Lord Spencer and other leading Englishmen at private\r\ndinner parties. Lord Aberdeen was one of the most conspicuous and one of\r\nthe most attractive figures in these political and social gatherings,\r\nand I could not, indeed, recall that period to memory for a moment\r\nwithout finding his figure photographed prominently in it. It was an\r\ninteresting sight during all that time to see some of the most extreme\r\nand most aggressive members of the Irish Parliamentary party mingling in\r\nsocial life with British peers and magnates who only a few years before\r\nwould probably have regarded those Irish members as traitors to the\r\nQueen and fitting inmates of the prison cell. On the other hand, too, it\r\nmust be said that only a very few years before the Irish Nationalist\r\nmember who was known to make his appearance in the London drawing-rooms\r\nof English aristocracy would have been set down by the majority of his\r\ncountrymen as a flunkey in spirit and a traitor to his cause. There was\r\na time not long before when an Irish Nationalist member would have\r\nneeded some courage to enable him to meet his constituents on election\r\nday if the local papers had made it known that he was in the habit of\r\nshowing himself in the drawing-rooms of English peers. All this sudden\r\nand complete change had been brought about by the genius and policy of\r\nGladstone when he came to see the true meaning and the true claims of\r\nthe demand for Irish Home Rule. My memory goes back with a somewhat\r\nmelancholy pleasure to those days of hope and confidence when the true\r\nunion of Great Britain and Ireland seemed actually on the verge of\r\nconsummation. Nor have I the slightest doubt that the lessons taught\r\nduring that season will have their full influence once again when the\r\nperiod of reaction is over, and that Gladstone's policy of 1886 will\r\ncome to life again before very long and will accomplish its work once\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nIn that year, 1886, Gladstone appointed Lord Aberdeen to the office of\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland. The position was given to Lord Aberdeen with\r\nthe frankly proclaimed purpose that he was to be the Lord-Lieutenant of\r\na Home Rule policy, and, indeed, on no other conditions would Lord\r\nAberdeen have consented to accept the office. Lord Aberdeen's short term\r\nof rule in Ireland was a complete success. There was not much that the\r\nmost Liberal Lord-Lieutenant could do in the way of positive\r\nadministration for the benefit of the island. There was already in\r\nexistence a whole code of repressive legislation compiled during\r\nsuccessive ages of despotic government, and this existing code it was\r\nnot in the power of Lord Aberdeen or any other Viceroy to abolish or\r\neven to modify. All that the new Lord-Lieutenant could do in the way of\r\npolitical relief to the Irish people was to discourage as much as\r\npossible the too frequent application of the coercive laws and to make\r\nit known that the sympathies of the new Government were in favor of\r\npolitical freedom for Ireland, as well as for England and Scotland. Lord\r\nAberdeen fulfilled this part of his public duty with a brave heart and\r\nwith all the success possible to the task. Every one who had any\r\nacquaintance with the state of Ireland at the time must have known what\r\ndifficulties were likely to be set in the way of Lord Aberdeen's\r\nendeavor to mitigate the severities of the coercion system. The most\r\nserious of those difficulties would in all probability have come from\r\nthe permanent official staff in Dublin Castle. American readers in\r\ngeneral can have but little idea as to the peculiarities of that\r\nsingular institution Dublin Castle, the center and fortress of Irish\r\ngovernment. It has become, from generations of usage, a very bulwark\r\nagainst the progress of Irish national sentiment. The fresh current of\r\nfeeling from the outside seems to make little impression on its stagnant\r\nand moldy atmosphere. It is ruled by tradition, and to that tradition\r\nbelongs the rule of hostility to every popular feeling and every\r\nnational demand. Lord Aberdeen had to encounter all the resistance which\r\nthe dead weight of Dublin Castle's antiquated systems could bring to\r\nbear against his liberal and enlightened efforts at the pacification of\r\nthe country. He carried out his purpose with unflinching resolve and\r\nunruffled temper, and, so far as the existing laws allowed him, he\r\nmitigated the harshnesses of the system under which Ireland had been\r\ngoverned since the Act of Union. But there was, of course, much more\r\nwithin Lord Aberdeen's capacity to accomplish than the mere mitigation\r\nof existing laws which it was not in his power to abolish. His presence\r\nand the entire conduct of his viceroyalty were as a proclamation to the\r\nIrish people that the whole sympathies of the Gladstone Government went\r\nwith the national demands.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, a strange sight was to be seen in Dublin--the sight of a\r\nthoroughly popular welcome, a national welcome, given to the\r\nrepresentative of English rule in Ireland. A new chapter in Irish\r\nhistory seemed to open, and the heart of Ireland was filled with hope.\r\nIt is told of Swift that when Carteret, Earl Granville, was appointed\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland--Swift afterwards became one of Granville's\r\nclose friends--he exclaimed in his sarcastic fashion that he could not\r\nunderstand why such a man should be appointed to such an office, and he\r\nthought the Government ought to keep on sending its bullies and\r\nblockheads just as before. A satirical Nationalist might have been\r\nexpected to break forth into a similar expression of wonder when a man\r\nlike Lord Aberdeen was sent to Ireland to carry on the rule of Dublin\r\nCastle. Lord Aberdeen and his wife made themselves popular everywhere\r\namong the Irish people, showed a living and a constant interest in\r\neverything that concerned the welfare of the population, and did all\r\nthey could to break down the long-existing barricades which made England\r\nand Ireland hostile nations. When Mr. Gladstone failed in carrying his\r\nHome Rule Bill through the House of Commons and his Government came to\r\nan end, Lord Aberdeen took his leave of Ireland amid demonstrations of\r\npopular regard, affection, and regret which must have deeply touched his\r\ngenerous heart. In 1893, when the Liberals were again in power, Lord\r\nAberdeen was made Governor-General of Canada, and he held that position\r\nuntil 1898. His term of service in Canada was as successful as might\r\nhave been expected, and the French as well as the other provinces looked\r\nup to him with admiration and gratitude. Then, for the time, his\r\nofficial career came to an end. In the interval between the Irish and\r\nthe Canadian appointment Lord Aberdeen and his wife made a tour round\r\nthe world, visiting on their way India and most of the British colonies.\r\nThe name of Lady Aberdeen is associated with all great movements which\r\nhave to do with the education and the general advancement of women, and\r\nwith many good works undertaken for the benefit of the Irish peasantry.\r\nLady Aberdeen, it should be said, is the youngest daughter of the first\r\nLord Tweedmouth, and is sister of the Lord Tweedmouth who, as Edward\r\nMarjoribanks, was so well known for a long time as one of the leading\r\nWhips of the Liberal party. Lady Aberdeen's name is Ishbel Maria, and I\r\nmay ask my American readers not to make the mistake, sometimes made even\r\nin England, of assuming her name to be the more familiar one of Isabel.\r\nShe has always been one of the most prominent, influential, and graceful\r\nfigures in English society, and every charitable association which\r\ndeserves her support has the advantage of her help, her protection, and\r\nher guidance. I know from my own experience what valuable and untiring\r\nservice she has given to the promotion of the lace-making and the\r\ncottage industries of Ireland. I had the great honor of being associated\r\nwith her in some of these efforts, and I never can forget her unsparing\r\ndevotion to the best interests of every such effort. I have among my\r\nbooks a series of large and handsome volumes devoted to a record of the\r\nproceedings which took place at the International Council of Women held\r\nin London during July of 1899 and presided over by the Countess of\r\nAberdeen. This series, published by Mr. Fisher Unwin, is edited by Lady\r\nAberdeen and has an introduction written by her. I may quote the closing\r\nparagraph of the introduction:--\r\n\r\n    It is a great inspiration to be bound together in the pursuance\r\n    of high ideals; it is also a grave responsibility--and during\r\n    our recent Council meeting both these thoughts have been made\r\n    very real to us. I pray God that they may abide within the\r\n    hearts of all who, in every country, are the guardians of the\r\n    honor of our Council, so that it may prove true to the lofty\r\n    profession it has made.\r\n\r\nThe series contains seven volumes, every one of which has been carefully\r\nedited by Lady Aberdeen, and is enriched with many commentaries of her\r\nown. One can easily imagine the amount of time and trouble which such a\r\nwork must have imposed on a busy woman, and those who know anything of\r\nher will know the thought and care and devotion which she must have\r\ngiven to such a labor of love.\r\n\r\nNot a few persons are still apt to associate the idea of a woman\r\nadvocating the advancement of women with something unfeminine,\r\nungracious, self-assertive, and overbearing. When Lady Aberdeen first\r\nbegan to be known in social movements, the memory of the late Mrs. Lynn\r\nLinton's diatribes about \"the Shrieking Sisterhood\" was still fresh in\r\nthe public mind, and much prejudice yet lingered against the women who\r\npublicly devoted themselves to the advancement of their sex. Lady\r\nAberdeen might have seemed as if she were specially created to be a\r\nliving refutation of all such absurd ideas. No fashionable woman given\r\nup to social success and distinction in drawing-rooms, dining-rooms,\r\nballs, and Court ceremonials could have been more feminine, graceful,\r\nand charming in her ways and her demeanor than this noble-hearted woman,\r\nwho was not afraid to advocate the genuine rights of women, and who\r\nstood by her husband's side in all his efforts for political reform. One\r\nmight adopt the words which Sheridan has made the opening of a song in\r\n\"The Duenna,\" and proclaim that a pair was never seen more justly formed\r\nto meet by nature than Lord and Lady Aberdeen. Such an impression was\r\nassuredly formed in Ireland and in Canada, and indeed in every place\r\nwhere Lord and Lady Aberdeen were able to assert their unostentatious\r\nand most beneficent influence.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen succeeded to the title and its responsibilities at too\r\nearly an age to allow him any opportunity of proving his capacity for\r\nParliamentary life in the House of Commons. His elder brother was\r\ndrowned on a voyage from Boston to Melbourne, and the subject of this\r\narticle then became Earl of Aberdeen, with, as a matter of course, a\r\nseat in the House of Lords. There is nothing like a real Parliamentary\r\ncareer to be found in the House of Lords. A man of great natural gifts\r\ncan, of course, give evidence even there that he is born for\r\nstatesmanship and can command attention by his eloquence. Lord Aberdeen\r\nmade it certain even in the House of Lords that he was endowed with\r\nthese rare qualifications. But the House of Lords has no influence over\r\nthe country, unless, indeed, when it exerts itself to stay for the time\r\nthe progress of some great and popular measure. Even this is only for\r\nthe time, and if the measure be really one of national benefit and\r\ndeserving of public support, it is sure to be carried in the end, and\r\nthe Lords have to give in and to put up with their defeat. But the\r\nhereditary chamber is not even a commanding platform from which an\r\neloquent speaker can address and can influence the whole country, and\r\nthe temptations there to apathy and indolence must often be found to be\r\nalmost irresistible. On rare occasions, two or three times in a session,\r\nperhaps, there comes off what is popularly called a full-dress debate,\r\nand then the red benches of the House, on which the peers have their\r\nseats, are sure to be crowded, and the galleries where members of the\r\nHouse of Commons are entitled to sit and the galleries allotted to\r\nstrangers are also well occupied. The Lords have even the inspiriting\r\nadvantage, denied to the House of Commons, of open galleries where\r\nladies can sit in the full glare of day or of gaslight, and can\r\nencourage an orator by their presence and their attention. In the House\r\nof Commons, as everybody knows, the small number of ladies for whom\r\nseats are provided are secreted behind a thick grating, and thus become\r\nan almost invisible influence, if, indeed, they can hope to be an\r\ninfluence at all. Yet even this inspiration does not stir the peers to\r\nanything more than the rarest attempts at a great debate. On ordinary\r\noccasions--and these ordinary occasions constitute nearly the whole of a\r\nsession--the peers sit for only an hour or so every day, and then mutter\r\nand mumble through some formal business, and the outer public does not\r\nmanifest the slightest interest in what they are doing or trying to do.\r\nThere are many men now in the House of Lords who proved their eloquence\r\nagain and again during some of the most important and exciting debates\r\nin the representative chamber, and who now hardly open their lips in the\r\ngilded chamber, as the House of Lords has been grandiloquently titled. A\r\nrising member of the House of Commons succeeds to the family title and\r\nestates, and as a matter of course he is transferred to the House of\r\nLords, and there, in most cases, is an end to his public career. Or\r\nperhaps a rising member of the House of Commons has in some way or other\r\nmade himself inconvenient to his leading colleagues who have now come\r\ninto power and are forming an administration, and as they do not know\r\nhow to get rid of him gracefully in any other way, they induce the\r\nSovereign to confer on him a peerage, and so he straightway goes into\r\nthe House of Lords. Perhaps, as he had been an active and conspicuous\r\ndebater in the House of Commons, he cannot bring himself to settle down\r\ninto silence when he finds himself among the peers. So he delivers a\r\nspeech every now and then on what are conventionally regarded in the\r\nHouse of Lords as great occasions, but his career is practically at an\r\nend all the same. I have in my mind some striking instances of this\r\ncurious transition from Parliamentary prominence in the House of Commons\r\nto Parliamentary nothingness in the House of Lords. I know of men who\r\nwere accounted powerful and brilliant debaters in the House of Commons,\r\nwhere debates are sometimes great events, who, when, from one cause or\r\nother, translated to the House of Lords, were hardly ever heard of as\r\ndebaters any more. Probably there seemed no motive for taking the\r\ntrouble to seek the opportunity of delivering a speech in the hereditary\r\nassembly, where nothing particular could come of the speech when\r\ndelivered, and the new peer allows the charms of public speaking to lose\r\ntheir hold over him, to pass with the days and the dreams of his youth.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen would in all probability have made a deep mark as a\r\nParliamentary debater if the kindly fates had left to him the\r\npossibility of a career in the House of Commons. He has a fine voice, an\r\nattractive presence, and a fluent delivery; he has high intellectual\r\ncapacity, wide and varied culture, and much acquaintance with foreign\r\nStates and peoples. Probably the best services which Lord Aberdeen\r\ncould render to his country would be found in such offices as Ireland\r\nand Canada gave him an opportunity of undertaking; viceroyalty of some\r\norder, it would seem, must be the main business of his career. But I\r\nmust say that I should much like to see his great intellectual\r\nqualities, his varied experience, and his noble humanitarian sympathies\r\nprovided with some opportunity of exercising themselves in the work of\r\ndomestic government. I may explain that I do not call the administration\r\nof Ireland under the old conditions a work of domestic government in the\r\ntrue sense. The vice-regal system in Ireland is a barbaric anachronism,\r\nand the abilities and high purposes of a man like Lord Aberdeen were\r\nwholly thrown away upon such work. There is much still in the social\r\ncondition of England which could give ample occupation to the\r\nadministrative abilities and the philanthropic energies of Lord\r\nAberdeen. The work of decentralization in England is rapidly going on.\r\nThe development of local self-government is becoming one of the most\r\nremarkable phenomena of our times. Parliament is becoming more and more\r\nthe fount and origin of national rule, but it is wisely devoting its\r\nenergies to the creation of a system which shall leave the working out\r\nof that national rule more and more to localities and municipalities. At\r\none time, and that not very long ago, it was believed even by many\r\nsocial reformers that, while self-government might easily be developed\r\nin the cities and towns, it would not be possible, during the present\r\ngeneration at least, to infuse any such principle of vitality into the\r\ncountry districts.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, it is becoming more and more apparent that the\r\nprinciple of local government is developing itself rapidly and\r\neffectively in the rural districts, and that the good old times when the\r\nsquire and the rector could manage by divided despotism the whole\r\nbusiness of a parish are destined soon to become a curious historical\r\nmemory. The system of national education, established for the first time\r\nin England by Gladstone's Government in 1870, has naturally had much to\r\ndo with the quickening of intelligent activity all over the British\r\nIslands. A new generation has grown up, in which localities are no\r\nlonger content to have all their business managed for them by their\r\nlocal magnates, and the recent statutes passed by Parliament for the\r\nextension everywhere of the local government principle are a direct\r\nresult of the legislation which has made education compulsory in these\r\ncountries. All over the agricultural districts we now find county boards\r\nand parish councils conducting by debates and divisions the common\r\nbusiness of each district, just as it is done in the great cities and\r\ntowns. It seems to me that this spread of the principle of local\r\nself-government opens a most appropriate field for the intellect and the\r\nenergies of such statesmen as Lord Aberdeen. Only in recent times have\r\ngreat noblemen condescended to trouble themselves much, so far at least\r\nas their Parliamentary careers were concerned, with municipal or other\r\nlocal affairs. A peer, if he happened to have any taste or gift for\r\nParliamentary and official work, was willing to become Foreign\r\nSecretary, Viceroy of India, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, or Governor of\r\na Colony. Not infrequently, too, he consented to devote his energies to\r\nthe office of Postmaster-General. But he was not likely to see any scope\r\nfor a Parliamentary career in the management of local business. In his\r\nown particular district, no doubt, he was accustomed to direct most of\r\nthe business in his own way and might be a local benefactor or a local\r\nmis-manager, according as his tastes and judgment qualified him. But the\r\ngeneral business of localities did not create any Parliamentary\r\ndepartment which seemed likely to deserve his attention. The condition\r\nof things is very different now, and Lord Aberdeen is one of the men to\r\nwhom the country is mainly indebted for that quickening and outspreading\r\nof the local self-governing principle which is so remarkable and so\r\nhopeful a phenomenon of our national existence at present. In every\r\nmovement which pretends to the development and the strengthening of that\r\nprinciple Lord Aberdeen has always taken a foremost part.\r\n\r\nI am not myself an unqualified admirer of that part of the British\r\nconstitutional system which makes the House of Lords one of three great\r\nruling powers. I should very much doubt whether Lord Aberdeen himself,\r\nif he were set to devise a constitutional system for these countries,\r\nwould make the House of Lords as at present arranged a component part of\r\nour legislative system. But I am quite willing to admit that, since we\r\nhave a House of Lords and while we have a House of Lords, a man like the\r\nEarl of Aberdeen does all that can be done to turn the existing\r\nconstitution to good account and make it in some degree worthy of\r\nnational toleration. While there exists an aristocracy of birth, even\r\nthe most uncompromising advocate of democracy and the equal rights of\r\nmen might freely admit that a career like the political and social\r\ncareer of Lord Aberdeen does much to plead in defense of the system.\r\nLord Aberdeen has always proved that he thoroughly understands the\r\nresponsibilities as well as the advantages of his high position. Not one\r\nof the Labor Members, as they are called, of the House of Commons--the\r\nchosen representatives of the working classes--could have shown a deeper\r\nand more constant sympathy with every measure and every movement which\r\ntends to improve the condition and expand the opportunities of those who\r\nhave to make a living by actual toil. Lord Aberdeen has yet, I trust, a\r\nlong and fruitful career before him. The statesmanship of England will\r\nsoon again have to turn its attention to the social movements which\r\nconcern the interests of the lowly-born and the hard-working in these\r\nislands. If a better time is coming for the statesmen of England,\r\nwhether in office or in opposition, who love peace and who yearn to\r\ntake a part in measures which lead to genuine national prosperity, we\r\nmay safely assume that in such a time Lord Aberdeen will renew his\r\nactive career, to the benefit of the people whom he has served so\r\nfaithfully and so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by W. & D. Downey\r\n\r\nJOHN BURNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Burns stands out a distinct and peculiar figure in the House of\r\nCommons. He is the foremost representative of that working class which\r\nis becoming so great a power in the organization of English political\r\nand industrial life. \"Be not like dumb driven cattle,\" says Longfellow\r\nin his often-quoted lines--\"Be a hero in the strife.\" The British\r\nworkingmen were until very lately little better than dumb driven cattle;\r\nin our days and under such leadership as that of John Burns they have\r\nproved themselves capable of bearing heroic part in the struggle for\r\ngreat reforms. I can remember the time when the House of Commons had not\r\nin it any member actually belonging to the working classes. At that time\r\nthe working classes had no means of obtaining Parliamentary\r\nrepresentation, for it may be said with almost literal exactness that no\r\nworkingman had a vote, or the means of obtaining a vote, at a\r\nParliamentary election. The conditions of the franchise were too\r\nlimited in the constituencies to enable men who worked for small daily\r\nor weekly wages to become voters at elections. In order to become a\r\nvoter a man must occupy a house rated at a certain yearly amount, and he\r\nmust have occupied it for a specified and considerable space of time,\r\nand there were very few indeed of the working class who could hope to\r\nobtain such legal qualifications. In more recent days the great\r\nreformers of these islands have succeeded in establishing what may be\r\nfairly described as manhood suffrage in these countries, and have also\r\nsecured a lodger franchise; have established the secret ballot as the\r\nprocess of voting; and by these and other reforms have put the\r\nworkingman on a level with his fellow-citizens as a voter at\r\nParliamentary elections. My own recollection goes back to the time when\r\nthe law in Great Britain and Ireland insisted on what was called a\r\n\"property qualification\" as an indispensable condition to a candidate's\r\nobtaining a seat in the House of Commons. I have known scores of\r\ninstances in which clever and popular candidates got over this\r\ndifficulty by prevailing on some wealthy relative or friend to settle\r\nlegally on them an amount of landed property necessary to qualify them\r\nfor a seat in the House. It was perfectly well known to every one that\r\nthis settlement was purely a formal arrangement, and that the new and\r\nnominal possessor of the property was no more its real owner than the\r\nchild who is allowed for a moment to hold his father's watch in his hand\r\nbecomes thereby the legal owner of the valuable timepiece. In our days\r\nno property qualification of any kind is needed either for a vote at a\r\nParliamentary election or for a seat in the House of Commons, and\r\ntherefore the workingmen form an important proportion of the voters at\r\nParliamentary elections and are enabled in certain constituencies to\r\nchoose men of their own class to represent them in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nI have thought it well to make the short explanation of the changes\r\nwhich have taken place in the condition of the British workingmen during\r\nrecent years as a prelude to what I have to say concerning that foremost\r\nof British workingmen, John Burns. It is only fair to say that the\r\nworkingmen of these countries have made judicious and praiseworthy use\r\nof the new political powers confided to them, and have almost invariably\r\nsent into Parliament as the representatives of their class men of\r\nundoubted ability and of the highest character, men who win the respect\r\nof all parties in the House of Commons. Of these men John Burns is the\r\nmost conspicuous. He has never, indeed, held a place in an\r\nadministration, as two, I think, of his order have already done; but\r\nthen John Burns is a man of resolutely independent character, and it\r\nwould not be easy thus far to form even a Liberal Government which\r\nshould be quite up to the level of his views on many questions of\r\ndomestic and foreign policy.\r\n\r\nJohn Burns would hardly be taken personally as a typical representative\r\nof the British workingman. He is short in stature, very dark in\r\ncomplexion and in the color of his hair, and a stranger seeing him for\r\nthe first time might take him for an Italian or a Spaniard. His physical\r\nstrength is something enormous, and I have seen him perform with the\r\ngreatest apparent ease some feats of athletic vigor which might have\r\nseemed to demand the proportions of a giant. His whole frame is made up\r\nof bone and muscle, and although he is broadly and stoutly built, he\r\ndoes not appear to have any superfluous flesh. If I had to make my way\r\nthrough a furious opposing crowd, I do not know of any leader whom I\r\nshould be more glad to follow than John Burns. But although Burns is\r\nphysically made for a fighting man, there is nothing pugnacious or\r\naggressive in his temperament. He is by nature kind, conciliatory, and\r\ngenerous, tolerant of other men's opinions, and only anxious to advance\r\nhis own by fair argument and manly appeals to men's sense of humanity\r\nand justice. I have seen him carry a great big elderly man who had\r\nfainted at a public meeting and take him to a quiet spot with all the\r\nease and tenderness of a mother carrying her child. But if I were an\r\noverbearing giant who was trying his strength upon a weaker mortal, I\r\nshould take good care not to make the experiment while John Burns was\r\nanywhere within reach. He is an adept at all sorts of athletic sports\r\nand games, skating, rowing, foot-racing, boxing, cricket, and I know not\r\nwhat else. He is essentially a man of the working class, and has, I\r\nbelieve, some Scottish blood in his veins, but he is a Londoner by\r\nbirth, and passed all his early life in a London district. He was born\r\nto poverty, and received such education as he had to begin with at a\r\nhumble school in the Battersea region on the south side of London.\r\n\r\nNow, I should think that a boy born in humble life who had in him any\r\ngift of imagination and any faculty for self-improvement could hardly\r\nhave begun life in a better place than Battersea. The Battersea region\r\nlies south of the Thames, and is a strange combination of modern\r\nsqualidness and picturesque historical associations and memorials. The\r\nhomes of the working class poor stand under the very shadow of that\r\nfamous church in Old Battersea where Bolingbroke, the high-born, one of\r\nthe most eloquent orators known to English Parliamentary life, and one\r\nof the most brilliant writers who adorn English literature, lies buried,\r\nand where strangers from all parts of the world go to gaze upon his\r\ntombstone. Everywhere throughout the little town or village one comes\r\nupon places associated with the memory of Bolingbroke and of other men\r\nfamous in history. Cross the bridge that spans the Thames and you are in\r\nthe Chelsea region, which is suffused with historical and literary\r\nassociations from far-off days to those recent times when Thomas Carlyle\r\nhad his home in one of its quiet streets. To a boy with any turn for\r\nreading and any taste for history and literature, all that quarter of\r\nLondon on both sides of the Thames must have been filled with\r\ninspiration. John Burns had always a love of reading, and I can easily\r\nfancy that the memories of the place must have been a constant stimulant\r\nand inspiration to his honorable ambition for self-culture. His school\r\ndays finished when he was hardly ten years old, and then he was set to\r\nearn a living, first in a candle factory and afterwards in the works of\r\nan engineer. Thus he toiled away until he had reached manhood's age, and\r\nall the time he was steadily devoting his spare hours or moments to the\r\ntask of self-education. He read every book that came within his reach,\r\nand studied with especial interest the works of men who set themselves\r\nto the consideration of great social problems.\r\n\r\nBurns naturally became very soon impressed with the conviction that all\r\ncould not be quite right under a political and social system which made\r\nthe workingman a mere piece of living mechanism and gave him no share\r\nwhatever in the constitutional government of the country. At that time\r\nthere was no system of national education in England, and the child of\r\npoor parents had to get his teaching through some charitable\r\ninstitution, or to go without any teaching whatever. So far as the\r\neducation of the poorest classes was concerned, England was at that time\r\nfar below Scotland, below Germany and Holland, and below the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAs regards the political system, a man of the class to which John Burns\r\nwas born had little chance indeed of obtaining the right to vote at a\r\nParliamentary election, which was given only to men who had certain\r\nqualifications of income and of residence not often to be found among\r\nthe working classes. The English system of national education is little\r\nmore than thirty years old, and the extension of the voting power which\r\nmakes it now practically a manhood suffrage is likewise of very modern\r\ndate. It was natural that an intelligent and thoughtful boy like John\r\nBurns should, under such conditions, become filled with socialistic\r\ndoctrines and should find himself growing into a mood of impatience and\r\nhostility towards the rule of aristocrats, landlords, and capitalists,\r\nby which the country was then dominated. Soon after he had reached his\r\ntwenty-first year he obtained employment as a foreman engineer on the\r\nNiger in Africa, and there he had his first experience of a climate and\r\na life totally unlike to anything that could be found in the Battersea\r\nregions. I have often heard it said that during his employment in\r\nEnglish steamers on the Niger he was known among his British companions\r\nas \"Coffee-pot Burns,\" in jocular recognition of his devotion to total\r\nabstinence principles. He spent about a year in his African occupation,\r\nand during that time he had managed to save up a considerable amount of\r\nhis pay, a saving which we may be sure was in great measure due to his\r\npractice of total abstinence from any drinks stronger than that which\r\nwas properly contained in the coffee-pot. When he left Africa, he\r\ninvested his savings in a manner which I cannot but regard as peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of him, and which must have given to such a man a\r\nprofitable return for his investment--he spent his savings, in fact, on\r\na tour of several months throughout Europe. Thus he acquired an\r\ninvaluable addition to his stock of practical observation and a fresh\r\nimpulse to his studies of life and of books. He settled down in England\r\nas a working engineer, and he soon began to take a deep interest and an\r\nactive share in every movement which had for its object the welfare of\r\nthe classes who live by daily labor.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are many improvements in the condition of such men\r\nwhich could only be brought about by legislation, and John Burns\r\ntherefore became a political agitator. His voice was heard from the\r\nplatforms of great popular meetings held in and around London and in\r\nmany other parts of the country, and he was one of the leaders of the\r\ngreat agitation which secured for the public the right of holding\r\nopen-air meetings in Trafalgar Square. John Burns was meant by nature to\r\nbe a popular orator. He has a physical frame which can stand any amount\r\nof exertion, and his voice, at once powerful and musical, can make\r\nitself heard to the farthest limit of the largest outdoor meeting in\r\nHyde Park or Trafalgar Square. But he is in no sense whatever a mere\r\ndeclaimer. He argues every question out in a practical and reasonable\r\nway, and although he has some views on political and industrial subjects\r\nwhich many of his opponents would condemn as socialistic, there is\r\nnothing in him of the revolutionist or the anarchist. His object is to\r\nbring about by free and lawful public debate those reforms in the\r\npolitical and industrial systems which he regards as essential to the\r\nwell-being of the whole community. The Conservative party in this\r\ncountry used to have for a long time one particular phrase which was\r\nunderstood to embody the heaviest accusation that could be brought\r\nagainst a public man. To say that this or that public speaker was\r\nendeavoring to \"set class against class\" was understood to mean his\r\nutter condemnation in the minds of all well-behaved citizens. We do not\r\nhear so much of this accusation in later days, partly because some of\r\nthe very measures demanded by those setters of class against class have\r\nbeen adopted by Conservative Governments and carried into law by\r\nConservative votes. But there was a period in the life of John Burns\r\nwhen he must have found himself denounced almost every day in speech or\r\nnewspaper article as one whose main endeavor was to set class against\r\nclass. John Burns does not seem to have troubled himself much about the\r\naccusation. Perhaps he reasoned within himself that if the endeavor to\r\nobtain for workingmen the right of voting at elections and the right to\r\nform themselves into trades-unions for the purpose of bettering their\r\nlives were the endeavor to set class against class, then there is\r\nnothing for it but to go on setting class against class until the\r\nbeneficent result be obtained. So John Burns went on setting class\r\nagainst class, with the result that he became recognized all over the\r\ncountry as one of the most eloquent, capable, and judicious leaders whom\r\nthe workingmen could show, and his unselfishness and integrity were\r\nnever disparaged even by his most extreme political opponents.\r\n\r\nA remarkable evidence was soon to be given of the solid reputation which\r\nhe had won for himself in public life. A complete change was made by\r\nParliamentary legislation in the whole system of London's municipal\r\ngovernment. The vast metropolis which we call London was up to that time\r\nunder the control for municipal affairs of the various parish boards and\r\nlocal vestries, each of them constructed on some representative system\r\npeculiarly its own, and none of them, it may be justly said, under any\r\ndirect control from the great mass of the community. The greater part of\r\nthe West End of London was under the management of a body known as the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works; the City of London was dominated by its own\r\nhistoric Corporation; each other district of the metropolis had its\r\ngoverning vestry or some such institution. Apart from all other\r\nobjections to such a system, one of its obvious defects was that no\r\ncommon principle was recognized in the municipal arrangements of the\r\nmetropolis; there were no common rules for their regulation of traffic,\r\nfor the levying of rates, for the management of public institutions, and\r\na Londoner who changed his residence from one part of the town to\r\nanother, or even from one side of a street to another, might find\r\nhimself suddenly brought under the control of a system of municipal\r\nregulations with which he was totally unfamiliar. Appeals were\r\nconstantly made by enlightened Londoners for some uniform system of\r\nLondon government, but for a long time nothing was done in the way of\r\nreform. At last, however, it happened--luckily, in one sense, for the\r\ncommunity--that the Metropolitan Board of Works, which ruled the West\r\nEnd districts, became the cause of much public scandal because of its\r\nmistakes and mismanagement, not to use any harsher terms, in the dealing\r\nwith public contracts. The excitement caused by these discoveries made\r\nit impossible for the old system to be maintained any longer, and the\r\nresult was the passing of an Act of Parliament which created an\r\nentirely new governing body for the metropolis. This new governing body\r\nwas styled the London County Council, and it was to have control of the\r\nwhole metropolis, with the exception of that comparatively small extent\r\nof municipal territory which we know as the City of London. The members\r\nof the new County Council were to be chosen, for the most part, as are\r\nthe members of the House of Commons, by direct popular suffrage. Some of\r\nthe foremost men in England became members of the new County Council.\r\nOne of these was Lord Rosebery, another was Sir Thomas Farrer (who has\r\nsince become Lord Farrer), a third was Frederic Harrison, one of the\r\nmost eminent writers and thinkers of his time, and another was John\r\nBurns, the working engineer. I mention this fact only to show how\r\nthoroughly John Burns must have established his reputation as a man well\r\nqualified to take a leading place in the municipal government of London.\r\nSince that time he has been elected again and again to the same\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWhen the great dispute broke out in London between the dock-laborers and\r\nthe ship-owners, John Burns took an active and untiring part in the\r\nendeavor to obtain fair terms for the workers, and by his moderation\r\nand judgment, as well as by his inexhaustible energy, he did inestimable\r\nservice in the bringing about of a satisfactory settlement. The late\r\nCardinal Manning took a conspicuous part in the effort to obtain good\r\nterms for the workingmen, and he was recognized on both sides of the\r\ndispute as a most acceptable mediator, and I remember that he expressed\r\nhimself more than once in the highest terms as to the services rendered\r\nby John Burns during the whole of the crisis. Burns made one or two\r\nunsuccessful attempts to obtain a seat in the House of Commons--or\r\nperhaps, to put it more correctly, I should say that he consented, in\r\nobedience to the pressure of his friends and followers, to become a\r\ncandidate for a seat. In 1892 he was elected to Parliament as the\r\nrepresentative of that Battersea district where his life began, and he\r\nhas held the seat ever since. In the House of Commons he has been a\r\ndecided success. It is only right to say that the workingmen\r\nrepresentatives, who now form a distinct and influential section in the\r\nHouse, have fully vindicated their right to hold places there, and have,\r\nwith hardly any exception, done honor to the choice of their\r\nconstituents. John Burns is among the foremost, if not the very\r\nforemost, of the working class representatives. He has won the good\r\nopinions of all parties and classes in the House of Commons. He has won\r\nespecial merit which counts for much in the House--he never makes a\r\nspeech unless when he has something to say which has a direct bearing on\r\nthe debate in progress and which it is important that the House should\r\nhear. He is never a mere declaimer, and he never speaks for the sake of\r\nmaking a speech and having it reported in the newspapers. The House\r\nalways knows that when John Burns rises he has some solid argument to\r\noffer, and that he will sit down as soon as he has said his say.\r\n\r\nThe first time I had the honor of becoming personally acquainted with\r\nJohn Burns was in the House of Commons, shortly after his first\r\nelection, and I was introduced to him by my friend Michael Davitt. I\r\ncould not help feeling at the time that it was a remarkable event in\r\none's life to be introduced to John Burns by Michael Davitt. Both these\r\nmen were then honored members of the House of Commons, and both had for\r\nmany years been regarded by most of what are called the ruling classes\r\nas disturbers of the established order of things and enemies of the\r\nBritish Constitution. Davitt had spent years in prison as a rebel, and\r\nBurns had been at least once imprisoned, though but for a short time, as\r\na disturber of public order. Every one came to admit in the end that\r\neach man was thoroughly devoted to a cause which he believed rightful,\r\nand that the true and lasting prosperity of a State must depend largely\r\non men who are thus willing to make any sacrifice for the maintenance of\r\nequal political rights in the community. I have had, since that time,\r\nmany opportunities of meeting with Burns in public and private and\r\nexchanging ideas with him on all manner of subjects, and I can only say\r\nthat the better I have known him the higher has been my opinion of his\r\nintelligence, his sincerity, and his capacity to do the State some\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nJohn Burns has made himself very useful in the committee work of the\r\nHouse of Commons. The House hands over the manipulation and arrangement\r\nof many of its measures on what I may call technical subjects--measures\r\nconcerning trade and industry, shipping and railways, and other such\r\naffairs of business--to be discussed in detail and put into working\r\nshape by small committees chosen from among the members; and these\r\nmeasures, when they have passed through this process of examination, are\r\nbrought up for full and final settlement in the House itself. It will be\r\neasily understood that there are many subjects of this order, on which\r\nthe practical experience and the varied observation of a man like Burns\r\nmust count for much in the shaping of legislation. Burns has genial,\r\nunpretending manners, and although he was born with a fighting spirit,\r\nhe is not one of those who make it their effort to cram their opinions\r\ndown the throats of their opponents. Although his views are extreme on\r\nmost of the questions in which he takes a deep interest, he is always\r\nwilling to admit that there may be something to be said on the other\r\nside of the controversy; he is ever ready to give a full consideration\r\nto all the arguments of his fellow-members, and if any one in the\r\ncommittee can show him that he is mistaken on this or that point, he\r\nwill yield to the force of argument, and has no hesitation about\r\nacknowledging a change in his views. Fervent as he is in his devotion to\r\nany of the great principles which have become a faith with him, there is\r\nnothing of the fanatic about him, and I do not think his enemies would\r\never have to fear persecution at his hands. There is no roughness in\r\nhis manners, although he has certainly not been brought up to the ways\r\nof what is generally known as good society; and his smile is winning and\r\nsweet. He has probably a certain consciousness of mental strength, as he\r\nhas of physical strength, which relieves him from any inclination\r\ntowards self-assertion. I should find it as difficult to believe that\r\nJohn Burns countenanced a deed of oppression as I should find it to\r\nbelieve that he sought by obsequiousness the favor of the great.\r\n\r\nJohn Burns was, it is almost needless to say, an opponent from the very\r\nbeginning of the policy which led to the war against the South African\r\nRepublics. When the general election came on, about midway in the course\r\nof the war, the war passion had come upon the country like an epidemic,\r\nand some of the most distinguished English representatives lost their\r\nseats in the House of Commons because they refused to sanction the Jingo\r\npolicy. Many men who were rising rapidly into Parliamentary distinction\r\nwere defeated at the elections by Imperialist candidates. Nor were the\r\nmen thus shut out from Parliament for the time all members of the\r\nLiberal party. In some instances, although few indeed, there were men\r\nbelonging to the Conservative, the Ministerial, side, who could not see\r\nthe justice of the war policy and would not conceal their opinions, and\r\nwho therefore had to forfeit their seats when some thoroughgoing Tory\r\nImperialists presented themselves as rivals for the favor of the local\r\nvoters. So great was the influence of the war passion that even among\r\nthe constituencies where the workingmen were strong there were examples\r\nof an Imperialist victory over the true principles of liberty and\r\ndemocracy. But the Battersea constituents of John Burns remained\r\nfaithful to their political creed and to him, and he was sent back in\r\ntriumph to the House of Commons to carry on the fight for every good\r\ncause there. He took part in many debates during the continuance of the\r\ncampaign, and he never made a speech on the subject of the war which was\r\nnot listened to with interest even by those most opposed to his\r\nopinions. He has the gift of debate as well as the gift of declamation,\r\nand he knows his part in Parliamentary life far too well to substitute\r\ndeclamation for debate. The typical demagogue, as he is pictured by\r\nthose who do not sympathize with democracy, would on such occasions\r\nhave merely relieved his mind by repeated denunciations of that war in\r\nparticular and of wars in general, and would soon have lost any hold on\r\nthe attention of the House, which is, to do it justice, highly practical\r\nin its methods of discussion. John Burns spoke in each debate on the war\r\nwhen he had something to say which could practically and precisely bear\r\non the subject then under immediate consideration--a question connected\r\nwith the administration of the campaign, with the manner in which the\r\nWar Office or the Colonial Office was conducting some particular part of\r\nits administrative task, with the immediate effects of this or that\r\nmovement, and in this way he compelled attention and he challenged\r\nreply. I remember, for instance, that when the spokesmen of the\r\nGovernment were laying great stress on the severity and injustice of the\r\nBoer State's dealings with the native populations of South Africa, John\r\nBurns gave from his own experience and observation instances of the\r\nmanner in which African populations had been dealt with by British\r\nauthorities, and demanded whether such actions would not have justified\r\nthe intervention of some European State if the conduct of the Boer\r\nGovernment, supposing it to be accurately described, was a\r\njustification for England's invasion of the Boer territory. Whenever he\r\ntook part in the debate, he met his opponents on their own ground, and\r\nhe challenged their policy in practical detail, instead of wasting his\r\ntime in mere declamatory appeals to principles of liberty and justice\r\nwhich would have fallen flat upon the minds of those who held it as\r\ntheir creed that Imperial England was free to dictate her terms to all\r\npeoples of inferior strength and less highly developed civilization.\r\n\r\nJohn Burns has fairly won for himself an honorable place in the history\r\nof our time. If he had done nothing else, he would have accomplished\r\nmuch by demonstrating in his own person the right of the workingman to\r\nhave a seat in Parliament. One finds it hard now to understand how the\r\nEnglish House of Commons could ever have been regarded as the\r\nrepresentative ruling body of England, when it held no members who were\r\nauthorized by position and by experience to speak for the working\r\npopulations of the country. I mean no disparagement to the other\r\nrepresentatives of the working classes when I say that I regard John\r\nBurns as the most distinguished and the most influential among them.\r\nOthers of the same order have rendered valuable service, not merely to\r\ntheir own class, but to the State in general since they came to hold\r\nseats in the House of Commons; some have even held administrative office\r\nin a Liberal Government, and have shown themselves well qualified for\r\nthe duties. Not any of them, so far as I can recollect, has ever shown\r\nhimself the mere declaimer and demagogue whom so many Conservative\r\nobservers and critics used to tell us we must expect to meet if the\r\nworkingmen were enabled to send their spokesmen into the House of\r\nCommons. I do not know whether John Burns has any ambition to hold a\r\nseat in some future Liberal Ministry, but I venture to think that if\r\nsuch should be his fortune, he will prove himself more useful than ever\r\nto the best interests of his country. He has never sought to obtain the\r\nfavor and the support of his own order by flattering their weaknesses,\r\nby encouraging them in their errors, or by allowing them to believe that\r\nthe right must always be on their side and the wrong on the side of\r\ntheir opponents. I fully believe that he has good and great work yet to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by W. & D. Downey\r\n\r\nSIR MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Michael Hicks-Beach is now, as everybody knows, out of office. _Il\r\nreviendra_, no doubt, and in a happier sense, we may trust, than fate\r\nallowed to the once famous personage concerning whom the words I have\r\nquoted were said and sung throughout France. _Il reviendra_ was the\r\nburden of the chant composed to the honor of the late General Boulanger\r\nand echoed through all the French music-halls at the time when Boulanger\r\ngot into trouble with the existing government. But Sir Michael\r\nHicks-Beach is a man of very different order from Boulanger, with whom\r\nhe has, so far as I know, nothing whatever in common except the fact\r\nthat they were both born in the same year, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe admirers of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach may take it for granted that he\r\nwill some time or other return to a high position in an English\r\nadministration. Whether that administration is to be Liberal or\r\nConservative we must wait for events to show. One can imagine the\r\nformation of a Conservative Government which might rise to the level of\r\nHicks-Beach; or one might imagine the formation of a Liberal Government\r\nin which Hicks-Beach could see his way to take office; but I think it\r\nwould be hard to realize the idea of such a man being left out of office\r\nor kept out of office for many years. He was, according to my judgment,\r\nthe most efficient and capable member of the Conservative Government now\r\nin office, the Government from which he felt himself compelled to\r\nwithdraw, or in which, at all events, he was not pressed to continue. He\r\nwas not a brilliant figure in that Government. He had not the push and\r\nthe energy and the impressive debating powers of Mr. Chamberlain, and he\r\nhad not the culture, the grace, and the literary style of Mr. Arthur\r\nBalfour. He made no pretensions whatever to the gift of oratory,\r\nalthough he had some at least of the qualities which are needed for\r\noratorical success. His style of speaking is remarkably clear and\r\nimpressive. No question, however complex and difficult, seems hard to\r\nunderstand when explained by Hicks-Beach. He compels attention rather\r\nthan attracts it. There are no alluring qualities in his eloquence,\r\nthere are no graces of manner or exquisite forms of expression; there is\r\na cold, almost harsh clearness enforcing itself in every speech. The\r\nspeaker seems to be telling his hearers that, whether they agree with\r\nhim or not, whether they like him or not, they must listen to what he\r\nhas to say. There is a certain quality of antagonism in his manner from\r\nfirst to last, and he conveys the idea of one who feels a grim\r\nsatisfaction in the work of hammering his opinions into the heads of men\r\nwho would rather be thinking of something else if the choice were left\r\nto them. \"Black Michael\" is the nickname familiarly applied to Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach in private conversation by the members of the House\r\nof Commons, and the nickname has found its way into the columns of\r\n\"Punch\" and other periodicals. The term \"Black Michael\" does not, we may\r\nassume, refer merely to the complexion of Hicks-Beach, to the color of\r\nhis hair; but means to suggest a grim dark-someness about his whole\r\nexpression of countenance and bearing. Certainly any one who watches Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach as he sits during a debate in the House of Commons,\r\nwaiting for his turn to reply to the attacks on some measure of which he\r\nis a supporter, will easily understand the significance of the\r\nappellation. Hicks-Beach follows every sentence of the speaker then\r\naddressing the House with a stern and ironical gaze of intensity which\r\nseems already to foredoom the unlucky orator to a merciless castigation.\r\nI must say that if I were a member of the House of Commons devoted to\r\nthe championship of some not quite orthodox financial theory, I should\r\nnot like to know that my exposition of the doctrine was to be publicly\r\nanalyzed by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach.\r\n\r\nYet Hicks-Beach is not by any means an ungenial man, according to my\r\nobservation. Some of his colleagues say that he has a bad temper, or at\r\nleast a quick temper; and I must say that I can easily understand how a\r\nman of vigorous intelligence and expansive views might occasionally be\r\nbrought into a mood of unphilosophic acrimony by the goings-on of the\r\npresent Conservative administration. During my many years of service in\r\nthe House of Commons I had opportunities of coming into personal\r\nintercourse with Hicks-Beach, and I have always found him easy of\r\napproach and genial in his manners. At different times while he was\r\nholding office I had to make representations to him privately with\r\nregard to some difficulty arising between an administrative department\r\nand certain localities which felt themselves oppressed, or at least put\r\nat a disadvantage, by the working of new regulations. I always found Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach ready to give a full and fair consideration to every\r\ncomplaint and to exercise his authority for the removal of any genuine\r\ngrievance. But I can easily understand that observers who have not had\r\npersonal dealings with Hicks-Beach and have only observed him as he sits\r\nsilent, dark, and grim during some debate in the House of Commons, may\r\nwell have formed some very decided impressions as to his habitual moods\r\nand tempers. A member of the House once asked me whether I was aware of\r\nthe fact that a certain line in one of Macaulay's \"Lays of Ancient Rome\"\r\nwas supposed to contain a prophetic description of Sir Michael\r\nHicks-Beach. I gave up the puzzle, and then my friend told me that the\r\ndescription was contained in the lines describing the Roman trumpet-call\r\nwhich tell that\r\n\r\n  \"The kite knows well the long stern swell.\"\r\n\r\nI hope my American readers will not have quite forgotten the meaning of\r\nthe term \"swell,\" now somewhat falling into disuse, but at one time\r\nvery commonly employed in England to describe a member of what would now\r\nbe called \"smart society.\"\r\n\r\nSir Michael Hicks-Beach has held many offices. He has been\r\nUnder-Secretary for the Home Department, and Secretary to the Poor Law\r\nBoard; he has been twice Chief Secretary for Ireland, or, to speak more\r\nstrictly, Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and he has\r\nbeen twice Chancellor of the Exchequer. I need hardly say that he was\r\nnot able to accomplish much during the periods of his Irish\r\nadministration. I have said in preceding articles that it is not\r\npossible for the Chief Secretary of a Conservative Government to\r\naccomplish anything worth attempting in the work of Irish\r\nadministration. What Ireland demands is the right to manage her own\r\nnational affairs in her own domestic Parliament, and there is nothing\r\nworth doing to be done by any government which will not take serious\r\naccount of her one predominant claim. No patronage of local charities,\r\nlocal flower shows, and local racecourses, no amount of Dublin Castle\r\nhospitalities, no vice-regal visits to public schools and municipal\r\ninstitutions, can bring about any real improvement in the relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland. I have no doubt that Hicks-Beach did\r\nall in his power to see that the business of his department was\r\nefficiently and honestly conducted in Dublin Castle, but under the\r\nconditions imposed upon him by Conservative principles it was impossible\r\nfor him to accomplish any success in the administration of Irish\r\naffairs. It has often come into my mind that a certain sense of his\r\nlimitations in this way was sometimes apparent in the bearing and manner\r\nof Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, when he had to take any prominent part in\r\nthe business of Dublin Castle. He has an active mind and a ready faculty\r\nof initiative, and there was no place for such a man in the sort of\r\nadministrative work which mainly consists in the endeavor to keep things\r\ngoing as they have been going, and striving after an impossible\r\ncompromise between despotic principles and a free constitutional system.\r\n\r\nHicks-Beach, of course, was more in his place when at the head of the\r\nfinancial department of the administration. He is admitted to have been\r\none of the most skillful and enlightened among modern Chancellors of the\r\nExchequer. His financial statements were always thoroughly clear,\r\nsymmetrical, and interesting from first to last. He never got into any\r\nentanglement with his figures, and his array of facts was always\r\nmarshaled with something like dramatic skill. I do not profess to be\r\nvery strong upon financial questions, but I could always understand and\r\nfollow with the deepest interest any financial exposition made by\r\nHicks-Beach. He seemed to me to be distinctly above the level of his\r\nparty and his official colleagues on all such questions, and it has\r\noften occurred to me that such a man was rather thrown away upon a\r\nConservative Government. Whatever else might be said against them, it\r\ncould not be said that his speeches at any time sank to the level of the\r\ncommonplace. There was something combative in his nature, and his style\r\nof speaking, with its clear, strong, and sometimes almost harsh tones,\r\nappeared as if it were designed in advance to confront and put down all\r\nopposition. The House of Commons had for a long time got into the way of\r\nregarding Hicks-Beach as a man in advance of his colleagues on all\r\nsubjects of financial administration. Every Tory in office, or likely to\r\nbe in office, now professes himself a free-trader, in the English sense\r\nof the phrase, but Sir Michael Hicks-Beach was evidently a genuine\r\nfree-trader, and never could have been anything else since he first\r\nturned his attention seriously and steadily to financial questions. I\r\nshould describe him as one of the foremost debaters in the House of\r\nCommons among the men who made no pretensions to the higher order of\r\neloquence; and probably an additional attraction was given to his\r\nspeeches by that aggressive and combative tone which I have just\r\nnoticed. I have sometimes fancied that his combativeness of manner and\r\nhis dictatorial style were less intended for the discomfiture of his\r\nrecognized political opponents than for that of his own colleagues in\r\noffice. Long before there was any rumor of incompatibility between\r\nHicks-Beach and the members of the present Government, I have often\r\nfound myself wondering how the man who expressed such enlightened ideas\r\non so many financial and political questions could possibly get on with\r\na somewhat reactionary Conservative administration. Of course I have no\r\nmeans of knowing anything beyond that which is known to the general\r\npublic concerning the causes which led to Hicks-Beach's withdrawal or\r\nexclusion from his place in the present Government. Even those London\r\njournals which profess to know everything about the inner councils of\r\nthe Cabinet did not, and do not, tell us anything more on this\r\nparticular subject than the news, impossible to be concealed, that Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach had ceased to be a member of the Conservative\r\nadministration. We were all left to make any conjectures we pleased as\r\nto the cause of this remarkable change, and I feel, therefore, no\r\nparticular diffidence in expounding my own theory. During the long\r\ndebates on Hicks-Beach's latest Budget proposals, which I had to follow\r\nonly through the medium of the newspaper reports, I became possessed\r\nwith the idea that Hicks-Beach was performing reluctantly an uncongenial\r\nand almost intolerable task.\r\n\r\nLet me recall to the minds of my readers some of the conditions amid\r\nwhich Hicks-Beach found himself compelled of late to carry on his work.\r\nIt should be said, in the first instance, that he never showed himself,\r\nand, as I believe, never could have been, a genuine Tory of the old\r\nschool. He never exhibited himself as an uncompromising partisan on any\r\nof the great subjects which arouse political antagonism. He must have\r\nhad very little sympathy indeed with the dogmas and the watchwords and\r\nthe war-cries of old-fashioned militant Toryism. He never identified\r\nhimself with the cause of the Orangemen in Ireland or the principles of\r\nthe Jingoes in England. He seldom addressed the House of Commons on any\r\nsubjects but those which belonged to his own department, and these were\r\nfor the most part questions of finance. When, however, he had\r\noccasionally to take part in debates on subjects connected with\r\nEngland's foreign policy, he generally spoke with an enlightenment, a\r\nmoderation, and a conciliatory tone which would have done credit to any\r\nstatesman and seemed little in keeping with the policy and the temper of\r\nmodern Toryism. But Hicks-Beach had fallen upon evil days for a man of\r\nhis foresight, his intellect, and his temperament generally who had\r\nfound a place in a Conservative Cabinet. The policy which led to the\r\noutbreak of the war in South Africa aroused a passion in the English\r\npublic mind which found its utmost fury among the partisans of Toryism.\r\nTory and Jingo became for the time synonymous terms. The man who did not\r\nallow his heart and soul to be filled with the war spirit must have\r\nseemed to most of his friends unworthy to be called a Conservative. Even\r\namong certain sections of the Liberals it required much courage for any\r\nman to condemn or even to criticise with severity the policy which had\r\nled to the war. Any one who ventured on such a course, whether he were\r\nLiberal or Conservative, was straightway branded with the opprobrious\r\nepithet of pro-Boer, and that title was supposed to carry his complete\r\ncondemnation. England had come back suddenly to the same kind of\r\npassionate temper which prevailed during the earlier part of the Crimean\r\nWar. \"He who is not with us is against us,\" cried the professing\r\npatriots at both times--he who does not glorify the war is a traitor to\r\nhis own country and a pro-Boer, or a pro-Russian, as the case might be.\r\nThis was the temper with which Hicks-Beach found that he had to deal\r\nduring the later years of his financial administration.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place to enter into any speculation as to what\r\nHicks-Beach's own views may have been with regard to the whole policy of\r\nthe war. It is now well known that Queen Victoria was entirely opposed\r\nto that policy, although she did not feel that her position as a\r\nconstitutional sovereign gave her authority to overrule it by a decision\r\nof her own. There is very good reason to believe that peace was brought\r\nabout at last by the resolute exercise of King Edward's influence. It is\r\nat least not unlikely that a man of Hicks-Beach's intellect and\r\ntemperament may have been opposed at first to the policy which brought\r\non the war, but may have, nevertheless, believed that his most patriotic\r\ncourse would be to remain in the Government and do the best he could for\r\nthe public benefit. He soon found himself compelled to perform as\r\ndisagreeable a task as an enlightened financial statesman could have to\r\nundertake--the task of extracting from the already overburdened\r\ntaxpayers the means of carrying on a war of conquest with which he had\r\nlittle sympathy. It was perfectly evident that the needed revenue could\r\nnot be extracted from the country without some violation of those\r\nfinancial principles to which Hicks-Beach had long been attached. There\r\nwas no time for much meditation--the money had to be found somehow--and\r\na great part of it could only be found by the imposition of a duty on\r\nforeign imports. We now know from public statements made by Sir Michael\r\nHicks-Beach himself that while the war was going on he became impressed\r\nwith the conviction that the whole administration of the military\r\ndepartment was grossly mismanaged, and that the money of the nation was\r\nthrown away when the War Office came to spend it. The conviction thus\r\nforced upon him could not have tended to make the task of providing\r\nmeans for such further expenditure any the more agreeable to him. We may\r\nassume that he saw no other course before him than to make the best of a\r\nbad job and try to find in the least objectionable way the amount of\r\nmoney necessary to carry on the business of the State. It was evident to\r\nhim that the principles of free trade must be put aside for the present,\r\nand he found himself driven to the odious necessity of imposing a duty\r\non the importation of foreign corn, a duty which in fact amounted to a\r\ntax on bread. Hicks-Beach well knew that no tax could be more odious to\r\nthe poorer classes of the British Islands; but we may presume that in\r\nhis emergency he could see no other way of raising the money, and he\r\naccepted the situation with a dogged resolve which made no pretense at\r\nany concealment of his personal dislike for the task. His manner of\r\ndelivering the speech in which he set forth his scheme of finance was\r\nthat of a man who has to discharge an odious duty, or what he finds\r\nhimself by the force of circumstances compelled to regard as a duty,\r\nbut will utter no word which might seem to make out that he has any\r\nexcuse other than that of hateful necessity. The substance of\r\nHicks-Beach's explanations on this part of his budget might be summed up\r\nin such words as these: \"We have got to pay for this war, and we have no\r\ntime to spare in finding the money; we must cast aside for the time the\r\nprinciples of free trade; but do not let us further degrade ourselves by\r\nhypocritical attempts to make out that what we are doing is in\r\naccordance with the free-trade doctrine.\" I remember well that on\r\nreading Hicks-Beach's budget speech I became deeply impressed with the\r\nconviction that his task was becoming so intolerable to him that we\r\nmight expect before long to see a change in the composition of the\r\nGovernment. But it appeared to me that, as the debate went on and the\r\ndays went on, the position of Hicks-Beach was becoming more and more\r\ndifficult. Some of the members of the Cabinet became to all appearance\r\nsuddenly possessed with an inspiration that the time had arrived for a\r\nbold movement of reaction against the long-accepted doctrines of free\r\ntrade. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had already receded so far from\r\nthe established policy as to propose the imposition of a tax on the\r\nimported materials for making bread; and why, therefore, should we not\r\ntake advantage--thus at least I construed their ideas--of this tempting\r\nopportunity to introduce a system of preferential duties and an\r\nimitation Zollverein for England and some of her colonies, and to break\r\naway from the creed and dogmas of men like Gladstone, Cobden, and\r\nBright? These proposals must have opened to the eyes of Hicks-Beach a\r\nvista of financial heresies into which he could not possibly enter. He\r\nprobably thought that he had gone far enough in the way of compromise\r\nwhen he consented to meet immediate emergencies by the imposition of a\r\nbread-tax. Is it possible that he may have felt some compunctious\r\nvisiting because of his having yielded so far to the necessities of the\r\nmoment? However that may be, I take it for granted, and took it for\r\ngranted at the time, that Hicks-Beach found the incompatibility between\r\nhis own views as to the raising of revenue and the views beginning to be\r\ndeveloped by some of his colleagues becoming more and more difficult to\r\nreconcile.\r\n\r\nLet me venture on an illustration, although it be not by any means\r\nphotographic in its accuracy, of the difficulty with which the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer found himself confronted. Let us suppose\r\nHicks-Beach to be the leader of a pledged society of total abstainers.\r\nAt a moment of sudden crisis he feels called upon to relax so far the\r\nrigidity of the society's governing principle as to allow one of its\r\nmembers who is threatened with utter physical prostration a few drops of\r\nalcoholic stimulant. He finds his course cordially approved by some of\r\nhis most influential colleagues, and at first he is proud of their\r\nsupport. But it presently turns out that they regard his reluctant\r\nconcession as the opening up of a new practice in their regulations, and\r\nthey press upon him all manner of propositions for the toleration and\r\neven the encouragement of what my friend Sir Wilfrid Lawson, the great\r\nEnglish champion of total abstinence, would term \"moderate drunkenness.\"\r\nFancy what the feelings of Sir Wilfrid Lawson would be if by some\r\ntemporary and apparently needful concession he found himself regarded by\r\nthose around him as an advocate of moderate drunkenness! Such, I cannot\r\nhelp thinking, must have been, in its different way, the condition to\r\nwhich Sir Michael Hicks-Beach felt himself brought down, when he\r\ndiscovered that his introduction of an import duty on foreign grain was\r\nbelieved by his principal colleagues to be but the opening of a\r\nreactionary movement against the whole policy of free trade.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Lord Salisbury seemed to be in the highest good\r\nspirits at the prospects before them. Mr. Chamberlain in especial seemed\r\nto believe that the time had come for him to develop an entirely new\r\nsystem of his own for the adjustment of import and export duties. For\r\nmany weeks the English newspapers were filled with discussions on Mr.\r\nChamberlain's great project for the new British Imperial Zollverein, of\r\nwhich England was to be the head. Numbers of Mr. Chamberlain's\r\nConservative admirers were filled with a fresh enthusiasm for the man\r\nwho thus proposed to reverse altogether the decisions of all modern\r\npolitical economy laid down by Liberal statesmen and Radical writers.\r\nStout old Tory gentlemen representing county constituencies began to be\r\nfull of hope that the good old times were coming back.\r\n\r\nThat was the crisis--so far at least as the official career of Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach was concerned for the time. What may have happened\r\nin the private councils of the Government we of the outer world were not\r\nand are not permitted to know. All that we actually do know is that Lord\r\nSalisbury resigned his place as Prime Minister, that Arthur Balfour was\r\ncalled to succeed him in office, and that a new administration was\r\nformed in which the name of Hicks-Beach did not appear. There were other\r\nchanges also made in the administration, but with these I shall not for\r\nthe present concern myself. The important fact for this article is that\r\nSir Michael Hicks-Beach was no longer Chancellor of the Exchequer. All\r\nmanner of conjectures were made as to the reasons why Lord Salisbury so\r\nsuddenly withdrew from the position of Prime Minister, and why he could\r\nnot be prevailed upon to hold the place even nominally until after King\r\nEdward's coronation. I do not suppose that the resignation of Lord\r\nSalisbury had anything to do with the fact that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach\r\nceased to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. The vacancies were not made\r\nsimultaneously, nor did there appear any reason to believe that\r\nHicks-Beach was so closely identified with the political fortunes of\r\nLord Salisbury as to be unable to remain in office when his leader had\r\nceased to hold the place of command. So far as an outsider can judge, it\r\nmust have been that Hicks-Beach could not get on with the new\r\nadministration, or that the new administration could not get on with\r\nhim. My own theory, and I only offer it to my readers as the theory of a\r\nmere observer from the outside, is that Hicks-Beach could not stand any\r\nmore of the reaction towards protection principles--thought he had gone\r\nquite as far as any sense of duty to his party could exact from him, and\r\nmade up his mind that if his colleagues were anxious to go any farther\r\nin what he believed to be the wrong direction they must do so without\r\nany help or countenance from him.\r\n\r\nThis theory has taken a firmer hold than ever of my mind since I read\r\nthe report of a speech lately made by Hicks-Beach weeks and weeks after\r\nhe had ceased to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. That recent speech\r\nmight have been made by a member of the Liberal Opposition. Certainly in\r\nsome of its most important and striking passages it enunciated opinions\r\nand laid down doctrines which might have come from almost any of Sir\r\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman's colleagues on the front Opposition bench. It\r\ndenounced extravagant war expenditure at a time when Imperialist\r\npoliticians were calling out for something very like military\r\nconscription, and it insisted that the defense of England by the\r\nstrength of her navy ought to be the main consideration of English\r\nstatesmanship. That is a doctrine which used to be proclaimed in distant\r\ndays by such men as Cobden and Bright, which soon became an accepted\r\nprinciple among all genuine Liberals, but has lately been repudiated by\r\nall Imperialists, Liberal or Tory, who seem to think that the one great\r\nbusiness of English statesmanship is to turn England into a military\r\nencampment. The natural and reasonable conclusion to be drawn from such\r\na speech is that during the last session or two of Parliament\r\nHicks-Beach found it impossible to put up any longer with the reign of\r\nJingo principles in the Cabinet, and made up his mind to set himself\r\nfree from such a domination. The Tory Government has lost its ablest\r\nfinancial administrator, and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach has regained his\r\nposition of independence.\r\n\r\nThe future must tell the story of Hicks-Beach's remaining career. That\r\nhe has yet an important career before him may be taken for granted if\r\nonly the fates allow him the ordinary length of man's life. Nothing but\r\nabsolute retirement from Parliamentary work could reduce such a man to a\r\nposition of complete neutrality, or could prevent him from having an\r\ninfluence which the leaders of both political parties must take into\r\nconsideration. He is too strong in debate, too well trained in the\r\nbusiness of administration, and too quick in observing the real import\r\nof growing political changes, and in distinguishing between them and the\r\nmere displays of ephemeral emotion, not to make his influence felt at\r\nany great crisis in the conditions of political parties. I hold,\r\ntherefore, to the hope expressed at the opening of this article, that\r\n_il reviendra_--that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach will come back before long\r\nto an important place in some administration. The House of Commons could\r\nnot afford just now to lose the services of such a man, and I take it\r\nfor granted that Hicks-Beach could not remain long in the House of\r\nCommons without being called upon to accept an official position. He is\r\nbeyond question one of the very ablest men on the side of the Government\r\nin that House, and his integrity, his moderation, his capacity to\r\nunderstand the significance of new facts, and his disinterestedness\r\nhave won for him the respect of all parties in Parliament and outside\r\nit. We are, to all appearance, on the eve of great changes in the\r\ncomposition of our political parties. With the close of the war has come\r\nto an end that season of Jingoism which brought so many weak-minded\r\nLiberals into fascinated co-operation with the Tories. The reaction\r\nagainst Toryism must come, and it will probably bring with it a\r\nreconstitution of both parties on the principles which each may consider\r\nessential to its character at a time when peace at home gives our\r\nlegislators a chance of studying the domestic welfare of the people in\r\nthese islands. It will not be enough then for a public man to proclaim\r\nhimself Imperialist in order to win the votes of a constituency, or to\r\ndenounce his rival as a pro-Boer in order to secure defeat for that\r\nunlucky personage. The constituencies will begin to ask what each\r\ncandidate proposes to do for the domestic prosperity of our populations\r\nat home, and to demand an explicit answer. Under such conditions,\r\nwhatever be the reconstitution of parties, I am strongly of opinion that\r\nSir Michael Hicks-Beach will before long begin a new administrative\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by Elliott & Fry\r\n\r\nJOHN E. REDMOND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN E. REDMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Edward Redmond is one of the leading men in the House of Commons\r\njust now. He is one of the very few really eloquent speakers of whom the\r\nHouse can boast at the present time. His eloquence is, indeed, of a kind\r\nbut rarely heard in either House of Parliament during recent years. The\r\nordinary style of debate in the House of Commons is becoming more and\r\nmore of the merely conversational order, and even when the speaker is\r\nvery much in earnest, even when he is carried away by the fervor of\r\ndebate, his emotion is apt to express itself rather in an elevation of\r\nthe voice than in an exaltation of the style. Among members of the House\r\nwho may be still regarded as having a career before them I do not think\r\nthere are more than three or four who are capable of making a really\r\neloquent speech--a speech which is worth hearing for its style and its\r\nlanguage as well as for its information and its argument. John Redmond\r\nis one of these gifted few; Lloyd-George is another. I have heard some\r\ncritics depreciate John Redmond's eloquence on the ground that it is\r\nrather old-fashioned. If it be old-fashioned to express one's meaning in\r\npolished and well-balanced sentences, in brilliant phrasing, and with\r\nmelodious utterance, then I have to admit that John Redmond is not, in\r\nhis style of eloquence, quite up to the present fashion, and I can only\r\nsay that it is so much the worse for the present fashion. It is quite\r\ncertain that Redmond is accepted by the House of Commons in general as\r\none of its most eloquent speakers and one of its ablest party leaders.\r\n\r\nRedmond has already been some twenty years in the House of Commons. He\r\nwas a very young man when first chosen to represent an Irish\r\nconstituency in the House. I have noticed that our biographical\r\ndictionaries of contemporary life do not agree as to the date of\r\nRedmond's birth. Some of the books set him down as born in 1851, while\r\nothers give the year of his birth as 1856. I think I have good reason\r\nfor knowing that the latter date is the correct one. Perhaps it ought to\r\nbring a sense of gratification to a public man when a dispute arises as\r\nto the date of his birth. It may give him a complacent reminder of the\r\nfact that certain cities disputed as to Homer's birthplace.\r\n\r\nJohn Redmond comes of a good family, and his father was for a long time\r\na member of the House of Commons. I can remember the elder Redmond very\r\nwell, and he was a man of the most courteous bearing and polished\r\nmanners, a man of education and capacity, who, whenever he spoke in\r\ndebate, spoke well and to the point, and was highly esteemed by all\r\nparties in the House. John Redmond was educated at Trinity College,\r\nDublin, studied for the law and was called to the bar, but did not\r\npractice in the profession. He was elected to the House of Commons in\r\n1881, and became a member of that National party which had been formed\r\nnot long before under the guidance of Charles Stewart Parnell. From the\r\ntime when he first took part in a Parliamentary debate it was evident\r\nthat John Redmond had inherited his father's graceful manner of\r\nspeaking, and it was soon discovered that he possessed a faculty of\r\ngenuine eloquence which had not been displayed by the elder Redmond.\r\nJohn Redmond had and still has a voice of remarkable strength, volume,\r\nand variety of intonation, and he was soon afforded ample opportunity\r\nof testing his capacity for public speech. It was a great part of\r\nParnell's policy that there should be a powerful Home Rule organization\r\nextending itself over all parts of Great Britain, founding institutions\r\nin all the principal cities and towns, and addressing audiences indoors\r\nand out on the subject of Ireland's demand for domestic self-government.\r\nJohn Redmond soon became one of the most effective organizers of this\r\nnew movement and one of the most powerful pleaders of the cause on\r\npublic platforms. The first time I ever heard him make a speech in\r\npublic was at a great open-air meeting held in Hyde Park. He had to\r\naddress a vast crowd, and I felt naturally anxious to know what his\r\nsuccess might be under such trying conditions for a young speaker. He\r\nhad then but a slender frame, and his somewhat delicately molded\r\nfeatures did not suggest the idea of great lung-power. After his first\r\nsentence I felt no further doubt as to his physical capacity. He had a\r\nmagnificent voice, clear, resonant, and thrilling, which made itself\r\nheard all over the crowd without the slightest apparent effort on the\r\npart of the speaker. I could not help being struck at the time by the\r\nseeming contrast between the boyish, delicate figure and the easy\r\nstrength of the resonant voice.\r\n\r\nDuring his earlier sessions in the House of Commons Redmond did not\r\nspeak very often, but when he did speak he made it clear that he had at\r\nhis command a gift of genuine eloquence. He held office as one of the\r\nwhips of the Irish National party--that is to say, as one of the chosen\r\nofficials whose duty it is to look after the arrangements of the party,\r\nto see that its members are always in their places at the right time, to\r\nsettle as to the speakers who are to take part in each debate, and to\r\nenter into any necessary communications with the whips of the other\r\nparties in the House. Redmond was a man admirably suited for such work.\r\nHe had had an excellent education; he had the polished manners of good\r\nsociety; he belonged to what I may call the country gentleman order, and\r\ncould ride to hounds with a horsemanship which must have won the respect\r\nof the Tory squires from the hunting counties; and he had an excellent\r\ncapacity and memory for all matters of arrangement and detail. He\r\nattended to his duties as one of the party whips with unfailing\r\nregularity, and could exercise with equal skill and effect the\r\ninfluence of persuasiveness and that of official command.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Parnell party there was not, to be sure, any\r\ngreat demand on the marshaling power of the whips over the rank and file\r\nof the little army. For a considerable time the whole Parnellite party\r\ndid not consist of more than ten or a dozen members. These members,\r\nhowever, were compelled to do constant duty, and to maintain the great\r\ngame of Parliamentary obstruction revived by Parnell at all hours of the\r\nday and the night. It was quite a common thing for a member of the party\r\nto deliver a dozen or fifteen speeches in the course of a single\r\nsitting, and John Redmond had all his work to do in endeavoring to keep\r\nexhausted colleagues up to their business and to see that they did not\r\nleave the precincts of the House until Mr. Speaker should have formally\r\nannounced that the day's sitting was over. Redmond's services were of\r\ninestimable value during such a period of trial. As the days went on,\r\nthe Irish constituencies became more and more aroused to the necessity\r\nof increasing as far as possible the number of thoroughgoing Parnellites\r\nin the House by getting rid, at every election, of the Irish\r\nmembers--Irish Whigs as they were called--who did not go in thoroughly,\r\nheart and soul, for the policy of Parnell. Under such conditions the\r\ninfluence and the eloquence of John Redmond were of the most substantial\r\nservice to his party in the work of stirring up the national sentiment\r\namong the Irish populations in the cities and towns of England and\r\nScotland. Before many years had passed, John Redmond was one of the\r\nwhips of an Irish National party in the House of Commons which numbered\r\nnearly ninety members. The increase of official duties thus put upon him\r\nand his brother whips did not seem to trouble him in the slightest\r\ndegree. He was always on duty in the House, unless when he had to be on\r\nduty at some public meeting outside its precincts; he was ever in good\r\nspirits; could always give his chief the fullest and most exact\r\ninformation as to the conditions of each debate, and the best methods of\r\ngetting full use of the numbers and the debating strength of the Irish\r\nparty at any given moment.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of this time he had not had much opportunity of\r\ncultivating his faculty as a debater, for the whip of a party is\r\nunderstood to be occupied rather in putting other men up to speak than\r\nin displaying eloquence of his own, and it was for several years not\r\nquite understood by the party that John Redmond was qualified to be and\r\nwas destined to be one of its most commanding spokesmen. I ought to say\r\nthat among other duties discharged by John Redmond was the trying and\r\nresponsible task of traveling on more than one occasion over the United\r\nStates and Canada and Australia to preach the Home Rule gospel to the\r\nIrish populations in those countries and to all others who would listen,\r\nand thus to obtain the utmost possible support for the great movement at\r\nhome. For many sessions, however, John Redmond was regarded by his\r\ncolleagues in the House as a speaker best heard to advantage on some\r\ngreat public platform outside the Parliamentary precincts, and very few\r\nof them indeed had yet formed the idea that he was also qualified to\r\nbecome one of the foremost orators in the representative chamber itself.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that Mr. Redmond's intimate knowledge of the rules\r\nand practices of the House and his thorough acquaintance with its\r\nbusiness ways were, in great measure, due to his having held for a time\r\na place in one of the offices belonging to the House of Commons. He was\r\nappointed, before he became a member of the House, a clerk in the Vote\r\nOffice, a department which has to do with the preparation of\r\nParliamentary documents, the distribution of Parliamentary papers, and\r\nother such technical work. The clerkships in these offices are in the\r\ngift of the Speaker, are an avenue towards the highest promotions in the\r\nofficial staff of the House, and are usually given to young men who, in\r\naddition to high education and a promise of capacity, can bring some\r\nParliamentary or family influence to bear on their behalf. John Redmond\r\nhad some experience in this Vote Office, and it made him a thorough\r\nmaster of Parliamentary business. I had enjoyed his personal\r\nacquaintance for some time before he came into the House as a member,\r\nand I had been in the House myself some two years before his election. I\r\nremember often seeing him and exchanging a word with him as he stood\r\nwithin the House itself, but just below the line which marks the place\r\nwhere the bar of the House is erected when there is occasion, for any\r\npublic purpose, to admit a stranger thus far and no farther, in order\r\nthat he may plead some cause before the House or present some petition.\r\nOfficials employed in any of the offices belonging to the House are\r\nallowed the proud privilege of advancing up the floor of the chamber as\r\nfar as the chair occupied by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the point at which\r\nthe bar would be drawn across if occasion should require. Thus I had the\r\nopportunity of conversing with John Redmond on the floor of the House\r\nitself, before he had yet obtained the right of passing beyond the\r\nsacred line of the bar.\r\n\r\nI am quite certain that Parnell himself did not, until the great crisis\r\ncame in the Irish National party, fully appreciate the political\r\ncapacity of John Redmond. Parnell always regarded him as both useful and\r\nornamental--useful in managing the business of the party, and ornamental\r\nas a brilliant speaker on a public platform. But he did not appear to\r\nknow, and had indeed no means of knowing, that Redmond had in himself\r\nthe qualifications of a party leader and the debating power which could\r\nmake him an influence in the House of Commons. The speeches which\r\nRedmond made, or rather was \"put up\" by his leader to make, in the\r\nHouse, had often for their object merely to fill up time and keep a\r\ndebate going until the moment arrived when Parnell thought a division\r\nought to be taken. But when the great crisis came in the affairs of the\r\nparty, then Redmond was soon able to prove himself made of stronger\r\nmetal than even his leader had supposed. The crisis was, of course, when\r\nthe Parnell divorce case came on, and Gladstone and the Liberal leaders\r\ngenerally became filled with the conviction that it would be impossible\r\nto carry a measure of Home Rule if Parnell were to retain the leadership\r\nof the Irish National party. I need not go over this old and painful\r\nstory again; it is enough to say that the great majority of Parnell's\r\nown followers found themselves compelled to believe that it would be\r\nbetter for Ireland if Parnell were to resign the leadership and retire\r\ninto private life for a certain time. This Parnell refused to do, and,\r\nin opposition to the earnest wishes of the majority of his followers, he\r\npublished a sort of manifesto in denunciation of Gladstone. Then came\r\nthe famous meetings of the Irish party in Committee-Room No. 15--one of\r\nthe committee-rooms belonging to the House of Commons--and, after long\r\ndays of angry and sometimes even fierce debate, the great majority of\r\nthe party declared that they could no longer follow the leadership of\r\nParnell. The minority made up their minds to hold with Parnell for good\r\nor evil.\r\n\r\nI am willing and always was willing to render full justice to the\r\nmotives which inspired the action of the minority. They did not feel\r\nthemselves called upon to justify every act of Parnell's private life,\r\nbut they took the position that his private life had nothing to do with\r\nhis political career, and that they could not abandon the leader who had\r\ndone such service to Ireland merely because his name had become\r\nassociated with a public scandal. On the other hand, the majority of the\r\nparty, of whom I was one, held that their first duty was to their\r\ncountry, and that if the continued leadership of Parnell rendered it\r\nimpossible for Gladstone to carry his Home Rule measure, they had to\r\nthink only of their country and its national cause. During all these\r\ndebates in Committee-Room No. 15, John Redmond took the leading part on\r\nthe side of the minority. He became the foremost champion of Parnell's\r\nleadership. This position seemed to come to him as if in the nature of\r\nthings. I well remember the ability and eloquence which he displayed in\r\nthese debates, and the telling manner in which he put his arguments and\r\nhis appeals. The course he took was all the more to his credit because\r\nParnell had never singled him out as an object of especial favors and,\r\nindeed, in the opinion of many among us, had not done full justice to\r\nhis services in the House of Commons. Then came the formal division of\r\nthe party. The majority met together and reconstituted the party with a\r\nnew Chairman, while the minority associated themselves with Parnell as\r\ntheir leader for the purpose of going over to Ireland and endeavoring to\r\norganize the country in his support. When the end of the fierce open\r\ncontroversy was brought about at last by Parnell's sudden death, John\r\nRedmond was made the leader of the minority, and from that time forth he\r\nbegan to give more and more distinct evidences of his capacity for a\r\nParliamentary leader's position. He and his group of followers kept\r\nthemselves in the House of Commons entirely apart from their former\r\ncolleagues. John Redmond had often to take a part in the debates of the\r\nHouse, and every one could see that the serious responsibility imposed\r\non him was developing in him qualities of leadership, and even of\r\nstatesmanship, which very few indeed had previously believed to be among\r\nhis gifts.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the state of things created in Ireland by the split and the\r\nsetting up of two opposing parties was becoming intolerable. Every man\r\nof patriotic feeling on either side of the controversy was coming to see\r\nmore keenly every day that the maintenance of such a division must be\r\nfatal to the cause, for at least another generation. Some efforts were\r\nmade by the leading men on both sides to bring about a process of\r\nreconciliation. John Dillon on the one side, and John Redmond on the\r\nother, lent every help they could to these patriotic efforts. John\r\nDillon had by this time become leader of the more numerous party, having\r\nbeen chosen to that position when the leader elected after the severance\r\nfrom Parnell had been compelled by ill health to resign the place. Every\r\nreasonable man among the Irish Nationalists, inside and outside\r\nParliament, was coming more and more to see that there was no longer any\r\noccasion whatever for further severance, and that the country demanded a\r\nreturn to the old principle of union in the National ranks. John Dillon\r\nbecame impressed with the conviction that it might tend to smooth\r\nmatters and to open a better chance for reconciliation if he, as one of\r\nthe most conspicuous anti-Parnellites, were to resign his position, and\r\nto invite the whole party to come together again and elect a leader.\r\nDillon was strongly of opinion that, as all matter of controversy had\r\nbeen buried in the early grave of Parnell, it would be better for the\r\ncause of future union that the new leader should be chosen from among\r\nthe small number of men who had always adhered to Parnell's side. Dillon\r\nprevailed upon most of his friends to adopt his views on this subject.\r\nIt was the custom of the Irish National party--indeed, of both the\r\nparties--to elect their leader at the opening of each session, and John\r\nDillon had been re-elected more than once to the position of command in\r\nhis own party. Accordingly, at the close of a session Dillon announced\r\nhis intention to resign the place of leader, and he added to the\r\nannouncement that he would not then accept re-election, even if it\r\nshould be offered to him by a vote of his party. This patriotic course\r\nof action was most happy in its results. The Irish National members met\r\ntogether once again as a united party, and the leadership was conferred\r\non John Redmond as an evidence alike of the confidence which was felt in\r\nhis capacity and his sincerity, and a proof of the desire entertained by\r\nthe majority for a thorough and cordial reunion of the whole party.\r\n\r\nJohn Redmond was therefore the first leader of the whole party since the\r\nevents of Committee-Room No. 15. John Dillon and his immediate\r\npredecessor had been only leaders of a majority, and now John Redmond\r\nwas chosen as the leader of the whole party representing the Irish\r\nNational cause in the House of Commons. He settled down at once to his\r\nnew position with a temper and spirit admirably suited to the work he\r\nhad to undertake. He seemed to have put away from his mind all memory of\r\ndisunion in the party, and he became once more the friend as well as the\r\nleader of every member enrolled in its ranks. Many of those who formed\r\nthe majority had in the first instance only yielded to the persuasion of\r\nJohn Dillon and others in the election of Redmond as leader merely\r\nbecause they believed that by such a course the interests of the cause\r\ncould best be served just then. But I know that some of these men\r\naccepted with personal reluctance what seemed to be the necessity of the\r\nhour, and looked forward with anything but gratification to the prospect\r\nof having to serve under the new chief. John Redmond, while defending\r\nthe cause of the still living Parnell, had shown in the service of his\r\nchief an energy and a passion which few of us could have expected of\r\nhim, and was often utterly unsparing in his denunciation of the men who\r\nmaintained the other side of the controversy. It was not unnatural that\r\nmany of his former opponents should feel some doubt as to the\r\npossibility of working harmoniously under the leadership of a man who\r\nhad been but lately so bitter an opponent. I had, at the time of the new\r\nleadership, been compelled by ill health to give up all active part in\r\npublic life, but I talked with many members of the majority in the Irish\r\nparty who told me frankly that they feared it would not be possible to\r\nget on under the leadership of John Redmond. Before long, however, these\r\nsame men spontaneously assured me that they had changed their opinions\r\non that subject, and were glad to find that they could work with Redmond\r\nin perfect harmony, and that his manner and bearing showed no sign\r\nwhatever of any bitter memories belonging to the days of internal\r\ndispute. Redmond devoted himself absolutely to the House of Commons and\r\nthe business of leadership, unless indeed when some pressing national\r\ninterests compelled him to leave his place in St. Stephen's in order to\r\nsee to the organization of the National cause in Ireland or in the\r\nUnited States. At the time when I am writing this article he has but\r\nlately returned from a visit of that kind to some of the great cities of\r\nthe American Republic.\r\n\r\nFortunately for his country as well as for himself, John Redmond is a\r\nman of private means, is not compelled to earn a living, and can devote\r\nthe whole of his time to the service of the National cause. He is always\r\nto be found at his post while the House of Commons is sitting, and I\r\nbelieve that his morning ride in Hyde Park with his wife every day is\r\none of the few recreations in which he allows himself to indulge. I had\r\nnot long ago a visit from a well-known member of the Irish Parliamentary\r\nparty who holds one of its official positions and was at the time of the\r\ninternal dispute an uncompromising opponent of Parnell's continued rule.\r\nThis friend of mine I know was decidedly opposed at first to the\r\nelection of John Redmond as leader, for the reason that he did not\r\nbelieve such an arrangement could possibly work with smoothness and\r\nsatisfaction to the party. But when I saw him lately, he assured me that\r\nhe had entirely changed his opinions and that he did not believe any\r\nparty could possibly have a better leader than John Redmond had already\r\nproved himself to be. He had nothing but praise for Redmond's bearing\r\nand ways, for the manner in which he appeared to have banished from his\r\nmind all memory of past disunion, and for the unremitting attention with\r\nwhich he devoted himself to the work of the party inside and outside the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nSince then I have heard and read nothing but good accounts of the manner\r\nin which Redmond has reorganized the party. It has under his guidance\r\nbecome once again a powerful force in political life. The House of\r\nCommons, as a whole, has thoroughly recognized Redmond's position,\r\ninfluence, and capacity. The Prime Minister has given many proofs of the\r\nimportance which he attaches to Redmond's decisions and movements. The\r\nnew leader of the Irish party has won a much higher rank as a\r\nParliamentary debater than he ever had attained to in the days before he\r\nhad become invested with a really grave responsibility. The newspaper\r\ncritics on all sides of political life are agreed in describing him as\r\none of the foremost living debaters. Indeed, there are but three or four\r\nmen in the House of Commons who could possibly be compared with him for\r\neloquence and skill in debate, and there is a quality of grace and\r\nartistic form in his style of eloquence which often recalls the memories\r\nof brighter days, when the art of oratory was still cultivated in\r\nParliament. The success with which he has conducted the movements of his\r\nparty has compelled Ministerialists and Opposition alike to take serious\r\naccount of Redmond and his followers when the chances of any great\r\npolitical measure are under consideration. Only quite lately, during the\r\npassage of the Education measure, he adopted a policy which at first\r\ngreatly puzzled his opponents, and at the last moment succeeded in\r\nimpressing the Government and the Ministerial party generally with the\r\nconviction that Redmond understands when and how to strike a decisive\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nOf course we hear sometimes, and of late rather often, about differences\r\nin the Irish party itself, and about a threatened secession from John\r\nRedmond's leadership. The Tory papers in England, and even some of the\r\njournals which are professedly Liberal, made eager use of this supposed\r\ndissension, and endeavored to persuade themselves and their readers that\r\nRedmond has not a full hold over his followers and over the Irish\r\npeople. I may tell my American readers that they will do well not to\r\nattach the slightest importance to these stories about a threatened\r\nsecession from the lately reunited Irish National party. In the first\r\nplace, I never heard of any political party which did not inclose in its\r\nranks some men who could not always be reckoned on as amenable to the\r\ndiscipline which is found necessary in every political organization.\r\nThere is a considerable number of Liberal members who cannot be counted\r\non to follow at all times the guidance of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.\r\nThere are many Ministerialists, and some of them very clever men, who\r\nhave lately been proving that at times they would just as soon vote\r\nagainst Arthur Balfour as with him. But in regard to the Irish party and\r\nthe members who do not always fall in with the wish of its leader, the\r\nactual facts are peculiar. The only members of the party who have lately\r\nbeen showing a tendency to mutiny are, with one exception, men of no\r\naccount whatever in Ireland's political life. I do not wish to name any\r\nnames, but I can state with deliberation that almost every one of the\r\nmutinous members just now is a man who has not the slightest chance of\r\never again being sent to represent an Irish constituency in the House of\r\nCommons. These men have long since forfeited the confidence of their\r\nconstituents and their fellow-countrymen. They are perfectly aware of\r\nthis fact; they know quite well that the next general election will see\r\nthem put out of Parliamentary life; and, in despair of re-election, they\r\nprobably think that they might as well make the most of the opportunity\r\nfor rendering themselves conspicuous or for indulging in eccentricities\r\nwhich now can do them no further harm. It may be taken for granted that\r\nat the next general election the National constituencies of Ireland will\r\nsend to the House of Commons no men who are not prepared to work in\r\ncomplete union with the National party, and to recognize the authority\r\nof the leader who has the confidence of his people. I do not care to\r\nwaste many words on this subject, but I think it right to assure my\r\nAmerican readers that they need not attach any serious importance to the\r\ndoings of five or six men, most of whom are either mere \"cranks\" or are\r\ndriven to desperation by disappointed personal ambition.\r\n\r\nJohn Redmond has the confidence of his countrymen in England and\r\nScotland, as well as in Ireland, and we have seen that within the last\r\nfew months he has obtained full assurance that he enjoys the confidence\r\nof his countrymen in the United States, in Canada, and in Australasia. I\r\nfeel all the more ready to bear my testimony to his merits and his\r\nsuccess because of the fact that I was, during a crisis which lasted for\r\nsome years, in direct opposition to the policy which he felt himself\r\nconscientiously bound to adopt. The change of events has released him\r\nfrom any obligation to adhere to such a policy, and I do him the justice\r\nto believe that he accepted with the sincerest and most disinterested\r\ngood will the first genuine opportunity offered for a complete reunion\r\nof Irish Nationalists. John Redmond is still young enough to have a\r\ncareer before him, and I feel the fullest confidence in his future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by Elliott & Fry\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HARCOURT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HARCOURT\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery friend and admirer of Sir William Harcourt must have been glad\r\nwhen it was made known that the late leader of the Liberal party in the\r\nHouse of Commons had declined to accept the King's offer of a peerage\r\nand was determined to remain in that representative chamber where he had\r\nmade his political name and won his place of command. Sir William\r\nHarcourt would have been thrown away in the House of Lords. He could not\r\nhave done anything to arouse that apathetic chamber to living importance\r\nin the affairs of state, and the House of Commons would have lost its\r\nmost impressive figure. Sir William Harcourt's political fame was made\r\nin the House of Commons, and he is even yet its most distinguished\r\nmember. I say \"even yet\" because Harcourt is growing old, and has passed\r\nthat age of threescore years and ten authoritatively set down as the\r\nallotted space of man's life. But he shows no appearance of old age,\r\nseems full of energy and vital power, and is as well able to command\r\nthe listening House of Commons by argumentative speech and impressive\r\ndeclamation as he was twenty years ago. Harcourt's bearing is one of\r\nsuperabundant physical resources, and he has a voice of resonant tone\r\nwhich imposes no tax on the listening powers of the stranger in the\r\nfarthest gallery. He is a very tall man, would be one of the tallest men\r\nin any political assembly, and his presence is stately and commanding.\r\nAfter Gladstone's death he became the leader of the Liberal party in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and he resigned that position only because he could\r\nnot cordially accept the policy and plans of action undertaken by his\r\nleader in the House of Lords, Lord Rosebery. I do not propose to enter\r\nat any length into the differences of opinion which separated these two\r\nmen, but it was generally understood that Lord Rosebery did not see his\r\nway to carry out Gladstone's policy for the maintenance of Greece and\r\nthe Christian populations generally against the blood-stained domination\r\nof the Ottoman power in the southeast of Europe. The result of these\r\ndifferences was that Lord Rosebery applied himself to form a Liberal\r\nparty of his own, which should be what is called Imperialist in its\r\npolicy, and that Harcourt became merely a member of the Liberal\r\nOpposition in the House of Commons. To have won the place of Liberal\r\nleader in the representative chamber might well have satisfied the\r\nambition of any man, and to withdraw from that place rather than\r\ncontribute to any further disagreement in the party did not in any sense\r\ndetract from Harcourt's influence and fame.\r\n\r\nSir William Harcourt won his earliest distinctions in law and literature\r\nrather than in politics. He comes of a family which has a history of its\r\nown and had members who won reputation during many generations. He was\r\neducated at Cambridge University and obtained high honors there. He was\r\ncalled to the bar in 1854, and became Queen's Counsel in 1866. In the\r\nmeantime he had accomplished some important literary work. He was a\r\nwriter for the \"Saturday Review,\" then at the zenith of its reputation,\r\nand under the title of \"Historicus\" he contributed a series of letters\r\non important public subjects to the \"Times\" newspaper which attracted\r\nuniversal attention, were afterwards collected and published in a\r\nvolume, and found readers in every part of the world where men take\r\ninterest in the public life of England. He was a leading advocate in\r\nsome legal causes which excited the profound attention of the whole\r\ncountry, and was already regarded as a man of mark, who might be safely\r\nassumed to have a successful career before him. It was generally taken\r\nfor granted at the time that such a man was certain to seek and find a\r\nplace in the House of Commons, which of course offers an opening for\r\nrising legal advocates as well as for rising politicians. I can remember\r\nquite distinctly that to all of us who were watching the careers of\r\npromising men it appeared quite certain that Harcourt was not likely to\r\ncontent himself with professional distinction, and that when he entered\r\nthe House of Commons he would devote himself for the most part to the\r\nbusiness of political life. He made one unsuccessful attempt to obtain a\r\nseat in the House of Commons as representative of a Scottish\r\nconstituency, and was more fortunate in his second endeavor, when he was\r\nelected to Parliament by the city of Oxford as a Liberal in 1868. Then\r\nfor a while I personally lost sight of him, for towards the close of\r\nthat year I began a lengthened visit to the United States, and only\r\nlearned through the newspapers that he was already winning marked\r\ndistinction as a Parliamentary debater. When I returned to England in\r\n1871, I found that Harcourt was already regarded as certain to hold high\r\noffice in a Liberal administration. His first step in that direction was\r\nto obtain the office of Solicitor-General in Gladstone's Government.\r\n\r\nA story was told of Harcourt at the time--this was in 1873--which I\r\nbelieve to be authentic and is worth repeating. Up to this time he was\r\nmerely Mr. William Vernon Harcourt, but the usage in Parliamentary life\r\nis that the leading law officers of the Crown, the Attorney-General and\r\nthe Solicitor-General, shall receive the honor of knighthood. It was\r\ntherefore a matter of course that Mr. Harcourt should become Sir William\r\nHarcourt, and bear the title by which he is still known everywhere. The\r\nstory goes, however, that Harcourt was not much delighted with the offer\r\nof a distinction which is commonly conferred upon the mayors of English\r\ncities and towns and other such personages of municipal position.\r\nHarcourt, as I have said, came of a distinguished English family which\r\nhad contributed Lord Chancellors and other such exalted dignitaries to\r\nthe business of the State. He probably had also in his mind the fact\r\nthat rising men in his own profession who happened to be sons of peers\r\nwere specially exempted by constitutional usage from the necessity of\r\nputting up with knighthood when accepting one of the two legal offices\r\nunder the Crown. The manner in which this very fact proclaimed the\r\ncomparative insignificance of the title may have still further\r\ninfluenced Harcourt's objections. Anyhow, he did endeavor to impress\r\nupon Gladstone his claim to be exempted from the proffered dignity.\r\nGladstone, however, assured him that it was the recognized\r\nconstitutional practice to confer a knighthood upon a new\r\nSolicitor-General, and that there was no reason why Harcourt should seek\r\ndispensation from the honor. \"Then,\" demanded Harcourt--so at least the\r\nstory is told--\"why don't you confer knighthoods on all the members of\r\nyour Cabinet, and see how some of them would receive the proposition?\" I\r\ncannot vouch for this story as historical truth, but I can vouch for the\r\nfact that it was told everywhere at the time, and received, so far as I\r\nknow, no contradiction.\r\n\r\nHarcourt made his way almost at once to the front rank of Parliamentary\r\ndebaters. His style was somewhat rhetorical and declamatory, but it was\r\ndistinctly argumentative, and his speeches contained few passages of\r\nmere declamation. He was a hard hitter, one of the hardest in the House,\r\nbut he hit straight from the shoulder and never gave an unfair blow. He\r\nwas often very happy in his sarcastic touches, and there was a certain\r\nrobust and self-satisfied good humor even in his severest attacks on his\r\nParliamentary opponents. The general impression of observers at first\r\nwas that Harcourt would go in merely for the reputation of a powerful\r\ndebater in the House of Commons, and would not show any ambition for the\r\nsteady and severe work of Ministerial office. The public had yet to\r\nlearn that the highest reputation of the man was to be made by his\r\nsuccess as the head of a great Ministerial department. Many observers\r\nalso formed the opinion that Harcourt had no clear political views of\r\nhis own, and was merely a sort of free lance ready to accept employment\r\nunder the most convenient leader. He had entered the House of Commons as\r\na Liberal, and even before he accepted office had always ranked himself\r\nas a regular supporter of the Liberal party, but he often made speeches\r\nin opposition to the views of extreme Liberals or Radicals--speeches\r\nsuch as might well have been made by some eloquent member of the Tory\r\nparty. Many of the more advanced Liberals had for some time no\r\nconfidence whatever in Harcourt's Liberalism, and were often engaged in\r\nsharp controversy with him. My own impression is that, up to a certain\r\nperiod in his career, Harcourt had not formed, or troubled himself to\r\nform, any very settled opinions on the rising political questions of the\r\nday. Upon all the old subjects of political debate, on the controversies\r\nwhich divided political parties in a former generation, his views were,\r\nno doubt, quite settled, but then there were many new subjects coming up\r\nfor discussion, bringing with them new occasions for political division,\r\nand it is quite probable that on some of these at least the new\r\nSolicitor-General had not quite made up his mind. He had been a close\r\nstudent at Cambridge, and had been elected professor of international\r\nlaw by that University; he had practiced law as an advocate, and had\r\nbegun to make a reputation for himself as a writer. It is quite probable\r\nthat he had not yet given any special attention to some of the new\r\nquestions which the growing development of social and political\r\nconditions was calling up for Parliamentary consideration.\r\n\r\nHarcourt appears to have accepted as a matter of course, when he entered\r\nthe House of Commons, the recognized principles inherited by the Liberal\r\nparty. But there was then, as at most other periods of England's\r\nconstitutional history, a new and advancing Liberal party beginning to\r\nmake its influence felt, and not satisfied to abide by the mere\r\ntraditions and established canons of the older Liberalism. Only a very\r\nfew even of the advanced Liberals were yet prepared to support and\r\nencourage the Irish demand for Home Rule, and on such domestic\r\nquestions, for instance, as the regulation of the liquor traffic, the\r\nLiberal party in general had not made up its mind to any policy other\r\nthan a policy of mere inaction. I mention these two subjects in\r\nparticular because they have an especial value in throwing light upon\r\nthe change which took place more lately in Harcourt's political\r\nattitude. Probably at the time when he first entered the House of\r\nCommons he had not concerned himself much with the Home Rule question,\r\nand had allowed himself to take it for granted, as so many even among\r\nLiberal politicians and newspapers would have told him, that the Irish\r\nHome Rulers were aiming at the break-up of the Empire. In the same way\r\nit is quite possible that he may have given little or no attention to\r\nthe demand for some new regulation of the liquor traffic, and dismissed\r\nthe whole subject as a crotchet of Sir Wilfrid Lawson. When, however, he\r\nbegan to study the political life of the House of Commons as an active\r\nand a rising member, and when he found that his inclinations and his\r\ninstincts were leading him into politics and away from law, we can\r\neasily understand that he set himself to study with candid judgment the\r\nnew questions which were beginning to divide the Liberal party. I have\r\noften heard Sir William Harcourt accused of inconsistency and even of\r\ntime-serving, because of his sudden conversion to the principle of some\r\npolitical movement which was at last coming to be accepted by the great\r\nLiberal leaders. I do not see any reason whatever to believe that\r\nHarcourt can fairly be reproached with inconsistency, or justly accused\r\nof any ignoble motive for his adoption of the newer and more advanced\r\nopinions. The explanation seems to me quite clear. The university\r\nstudent, the practicing advocate, the professor of international law,\r\nadopted a new career and devoted himself to an active part in the work\r\nof the House of Commons. Then it was that he studied for the first time\r\nwith earnestness and impartiality some great developing questions which\r\nhad previously been mere names and shadows to him, and thus he came to\r\nform the conclusions which guided his subsequent career. If Harcourt had\r\nbeen thinking chiefly of his own political advancement, he might have\r\ndone better for himself by following the example of Disraeli, and taking\r\na place among the Tories, where intellect and eloquence were more rare\r\nthan on the other side of the House, and where promotion was therefore\r\nmore easily to be won.\r\n\r\nHarcourt had probably not given much attention to great financial\r\nquestions until he came under the influence of Gladstone. Up to that\r\ntime he had, perhaps, not assumed that such subjects were likely to come\r\nwithin the scope of his practical work; but when he had to study them,\r\nhe began to discover that he had within him the capacity for a thorough\r\ncomprehension of their real meaning and development, and as the result\r\nof the study he became, when the opportunity offered itself, one of the\r\nmost successful and enlightened financial Ministers of his time. In the\r\nsame way he may never have given any serious thought to the question of\r\nIrish Home Rule, and may have fallen quietly into the way of regarding\r\nit, in accordance with the common opinion of most Englishmen just then,\r\nas something naturally associated with a rebellious desire for the\r\nbreaking up of the Empire. When, however, he was led to study it as a\r\nquestion of reasonable import, he grew to be a convinced and a hopeful\r\nadvocate of the cause. For a long time after he had taken office under\r\nGladstone he found himself brought into an incessant opposition and even\r\nantagonism to the small group of Irish members, who then represented the\r\nIrish national demand, and compelled to fight against the obstruction\r\nwhich these Irish members were raising night after night, as their only\r\nmeans of enforcing public attention to a serious consideration of\r\nIreland's national complaints and claims. He became converted to the\r\ncause of Home Rule, just as Gladstone did, by having the question forced\r\nupon his consideration, and thus being compelled to ask himself whether\r\nthere was not some real sense of justice inspiring the Irish agitation.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember a conversation I once had with Gladstone on\r\nthis subject of Irish Home Rule. It was in one of the inner lobbies of\r\nthe House of Commons, and Mr. Gladstone began it by asking me how I\r\ncould regard Home Rule as a national demand, seeing that only a very\r\nsmall number of the Irish representatives in the House were actively in\r\nfavor of such a measure. Gladstone called my attention to the fact that\r\nout of the whole body of Irish representatives elected by the\r\nconstituencies on the same basis of voting, less than a dozen members\r\ndeclared themselves uncompromising advocates of Home Rule. I drew\r\nGladstone's attention to the fact that the suffrage in Ireland was so\r\nhigh and so restricted that the whole bulk of the Irish population were\r\ndisqualified by law from giving a vote at any election. Gladstone\r\nappealed to me to say whether he had not long been in favor of an\r\nexpanded suffrage for the whole Kingdom, and I told him that I cordially\r\nrecognized his sincere purpose, and that whenever we got a really fair\r\nand popular suffrage he would then find ample proof that the great bulk\r\nof the Irish people were united in their demands for Home Rule. Not long\r\nafter, it came about that Gladstone and his Government saw their way to\r\na measure of reform which gave the whole Kingdom an expanded and popular\r\nsuffrage, and at the next general election the great majority of Irish\r\nmembers opposed to or lukewarm about Home Rule disappeared altogether\r\nfrom Parliament, and their places were taken by avowed and\r\nuncompromising Home Rulers elected mainly because they were earnest\r\nadvocates of Home Rule. Out of the hundred and three members who\r\nconstitute the Irish representation, we had then nearly ninety who were\r\nproclaimed and consistent Home Rulers. This result did much of itself to\r\nmake Gladstone a convert to Home Rule, and it had naturally the same\r\neffect on Harcourt, who was far too intelligent a man not to accept the\r\nlesson taught by the Irish constituencies, and to admit that the demand\r\nfor Home Rule was a genuine national demand, and as such entitled to the\r\nserious consideration of real statesmen. The conversion of Harcourt I\r\nhave always, therefore, regarded as sincere and statesmanlike, and of\r\nthe same order as the conversion of Gladstone himself. The first\r\nbusiness of statesmanship is to recognize established facts and to act\r\nupon their evidence. Once the demand had been proved to be national,\r\nneither Gladstone nor Harcourt was the man to deny it a full\r\nconsideration; and the same full consideration made the one man and the\r\nother an advocate of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the great constitutional change which I have\r\ndescribed, the change which resulted in the adoption of a popular\r\nsuffrage, in the days when our small band of Irish Nationalists was\r\nstill doing battle inch by inch against the Government, we had many\r\nfierce struggles with Harcourt, then a leading member of the Liberal\r\nadministration. We had to admit that we found in him a powerful\r\nantagonist. He was ready in reply, resolute in maintaining his position,\r\nand he gave us, to say the least of it, as good as we brought. He was\r\never alert, he could answer attack by attack, he could carry the battle\r\ninto the enemy's ranks, and the ablest of our debaters had his best work\r\nto do when compelled to stand up in Parliamentary contest against\r\nHarcourt. But I observed that in our private dealings with Harcourt, on\r\nquestions which came within the range of his administrative functions,\r\nwe always found him considerate, kind, and even generous. There were\r\nfrequent occasions when a Minister of the Crown had to be applied to by\r\nan Irish member for justice in the dealings of his official department,\r\nwhere individual questions of right and wrong having nothing to do with\r\nthe general subject of Home Rule came up for consideration. I am now\r\nspeaking of questions which were not to be settled by mere debate in the\r\nHouse of Commons, but which belonged to the ordinary and practical\r\ndealings of the department with this or that individual case. I can\r\nremember many instances in which I had to make some such appeal to Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt, and I ever found him most ready and willing to\r\nconsider fairly the nature of any individual grievance, and to prevent\r\nthe administration of the law from being perversely turned into an\r\nengine of oppression. I know that many of my colleagues as well as\r\nmyself felt thankful to Harcourt for his prompt interference where a\r\nreal grievance had been brought under his notice, and for his resolve to\r\nsee that justice must be done to the obscure sufferer from official\r\ntyranny. When the Liberal Government and the Irish National party came\r\nto work together for Home Rule, we, the Irish National members, had\r\nnothing on our memory which could prevent us from regarding Harcourt as\r\na genuine Liberal and a sincere friend who had never shown any\r\ninclination to abuse his power when he was strong and we were at our\r\nweakest. My recollection of the days when we were fighting against\r\nHarcourt is tinged with no bitterness. He was always a formidable\r\nfighter, but he fought fairly when he still had to fight against us.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Harcourt should have been for some time\r\nregarded as a powerful debater and nothing more. He was one of the\r\nforemost debaters in the House of Commons, even at a time when that\r\nHouse had more commanding debaters in it than it can claim to have just\r\nat present. He cannot be ranked among the great orators of the House. He\r\nis wanting in imagination, and without the gift of imagination there\r\ncannot be eloquence of the highest order. Even in the mere making of\r\nphrases he has seldom shown originality, and it has often been remarked\r\nof him, as it was remarked by Disraeli of Sir Robert Peel, that he never\r\nventures on any quotation which has not already well established its\r\npopularity. Sir William Harcourt's best qualities as a speaker consist\r\nin his clearness of exposition, his unfailing fluency, his masterly\r\narray of forcible argument, and the fact that he never allows his\r\neloquence to soar over the heads of his audience. I should be inclined\r\nto say of him that, although he is unquestionably a great Parliamentary\r\ndebater, yet his intellectual capacity, his faculty for balancing\r\nevidence, acquiring and comparing facts, appreciating tendencies, and\r\ncoming to just conclusions, are greater even than his powers of speech.\r\nI may say that one who listened to Sir William Harcourt during the\r\nearlier stages of his Parliamentary career might very naturally have\r\nbeen led to quite a different conclusion, and might have set him down as\r\na clever maker of speeches and not a statesman. But such an observer,\r\nsupposing him to be endowed with a fair amount of intelligence, would\r\nhave gradually changed his opinion as he followed Harcourt's political\r\ncareer. Every time that Harcourt has been in office he has more and more\r\ngiven proof that there is in him the true quality of statesmanship. He\r\nserved as Home Secretary under Gladstone, and was afterwards Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, first in one of Gladstone's Administrations and\r\nafterwards in the Government of Lord Rosebery. There can be no question\r\nthat he proved himself to be one of the greatest financial Ministers\r\nEngland has had in recent times. His famous Death Duties budget,\r\nintroduced while Lord Rosebery was Prime Minister, created one of the\r\nmost vehement controversies known to the political life of the present\r\ngeneration. Yet the great principle which Harcourt embodied in his\r\ndealing with the question of death duties must now be regarded even by\r\nhis political opponents as resting on a basis of absolute morality and\r\njustice. The principle merely was that the amount of taxation which any\r\nindividual pays to the State in consideration of his having obtained\r\nproperty by bequest shall be greater in proportion according as the\r\nacquired property is great in amount. In other words, Harcourt's policy\r\nmaintained that a man who comes in for a large property as a bequest\r\nshall pay a larger proportion of taxation to the State than a man who\r\ncomes in for a small property, and that the same principle ought to\r\nprevail through our other systems of direct taxation. The whole\r\ncontroversy simply turns on the question whether the rich man ought or\r\nought not to pay a larger proportion of his income to defray the\r\nnational expenses than the poor man--whether the citizen who has only\r\nincome enough to enable him to maintain his family decently ought to be\r\ncalled upon to pay towards the maintenance of the State on just the same\r\nscale as that ordained for the man who can live in lavish luxury. The\r\nboldness and originality of Sir William Harcourt's venture in his budget\r\nof 1893, the energy and argumentative power with which he carried it to\r\nsuccess, have undoubtedly secured for him a place in the front rank of\r\nEngland's financial Ministers. The later years of Harcourt's career\r\noffer a strange commentary on the estimate generally formed of him when\r\nhe began to be conspicuous in Parliament. At the former period he was\r\ncommonly regarded as a clever but somewhat superficial man, as one whose\r\nqualities were rather flashy than sound, as a ready maker of telling\r\nspeeches designed to produce an immediate effect and destined to be\r\nutterly forgotten the day after to-morrow. Harcourt's later years of\r\npublic work have proved him to be a serious Parliamentary leader, a man\r\nof strong and deep convictions, a man who thinks before he speaks and\r\nspeaks because he thinks.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the seriousness of Harcourt's convictions on some subjects of\r\nnational importance has brought him more than once into disfavor with\r\nhis constituents. He holds very strong and advanced views on the\r\nsubject of local option--that is to say, on the right of localities to\r\nsay whether they will or will not allow the sale of intoxicating drinks\r\nwithin their confines, and to state what conditions are to be imposed on\r\nthe traffic if it is permitted at all. Sir William Harcourt went further\r\non this subject than some even among his colleagues who were in favor of\r\nthe general principle as a principle, but did not see the necessity for\r\npressing it to immediate action. One of those colleagues said to me that\r\nin his opinion Harcourt might very well have allowed the question to\r\nstand over for eight or ten years, and perhaps by the end of that time\r\nthe habits of the population would have improved so far as to render the\r\npassing of any strong restrictive law unnecessary. I am quite certain\r\nthat Harcourt's earnest resolve to deal boldly with this subject if he\r\nshould be allowed the opportunity had much to do with the condition of\r\nfeeling in the Liberal party which led to his resignation of its\r\nleadership. We may look forward with confidence to the formation of a\r\nnew Liberal Government in which Harcourt will have a commanding\r\nposition, and when that time comes we may take it for granted that, in\r\nspite of whatever opposition on either side of the House of Commons, he\r\nwill once more attempt to deal with the question of local option.\r\n\r\nMost of my American readers know that Sir William Harcourt's second wife\r\nwas the daughter of Lothrop Motley, the famous historian who was for a\r\ntime Minister to Great Britain, and who died at Harcourt's country\r\nresidence in 1877. The eldest son, Louis Vernon Harcourt, who was born\r\nin 1863, has also married an American lady. Louis Harcourt, whom I have\r\nknown since his boyish days, is endowed with much of his father's\r\ntalents, and I have always thought that if he had devoted himself\r\nentirely to political life he might make for himself such a career as\r\nhis father has already accomplished. During contested elections I have\r\nbeen more than once associated with Louis Harcourt in \"stumping\" some\r\nparts of the country on behalf of the Liberal Government then engaged in\r\nthe cause of Home Rule, and I have the clearest memories of his\r\nremarkable organizing capacity, his ready eloquence, and his skill in\r\nreplying to questions and arguments and in convincing skeptical voters.\r\nI take it for granted that every one who has known Louis, or, as he is\r\ncommonly called, \"Lulu\" Harcourt, must have delightful recollections of\r\nhis bright companionship. We have all heard that Sir William Harcourt\r\nstudiously consulted his son when the offer of a peerage was made to him\r\nby King Edward, and that \"Lulu\" was resolute in supporting his father's\r\ndesire to refuse the honor, even although his acceptance of it would\r\nhave made \"Lulu\" the heir to a peerage. Sir William Harcourt, we may\r\nwell hope, has yet good work to do in the House of Commons. There is\r\nnothing about him which suggests the idea of advanced years or of\r\ndecaying powers, whether mental or physical. The curious attack of\r\nweakness which lately came over so many members of the Liberal party\r\nnever touched his robust intellect and resolute character. No man could\r\nrender more valuable services than he may be expected to do in turning\r\nto account for genuine Liberalism the reaction already beginning to set\r\nin against the reign of the Tories and the Jingoes. I cherish the belief\r\nthat the best of Sir William Harcourt's work is yet to be done by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by London Stereoscopic Co.\r\n\r\nJAMES BRYCE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES BRYCE\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Bryce is universally recognized as one of the intellectual forces\r\nin the British House of Commons. When he rises to make a speech, every\r\none listens with the deepest interest, feeling sure that some ideas and\r\nsome instruction are sure to come which no political party in the House\r\ncan well afford to lose. Some men in the House of Commons have been\r\norators and nothing else; some have been orators and instructors as\r\nwell; some have been Parliamentary debaters more or less capable; and a\r\ngood many have been bores. In every generation there have been a few who\r\nare especially regarded as illuminating forces. The House does not think\r\nof measuring their influence by any estimate of their greater or less\r\ncapacity for mere eloquence of expression. It values them because of the\r\nlessons which they teach. To this small order of members James Bryce\r\nundoubtedly belongs. Now, I do not mean to convey the idea that such men\r\nas these are not usually endowed with the gift of eloquence, or that\r\nthey cannot deliver speeches which would entitle them to a high rank\r\namong Parliamentary debaters, no matter what the import of the speeches\r\nmight be. My object is to describe a certain class of men whose\r\nParliamentary speeches are valued by members in general without any\r\nspecial regard for their form, but only with regard to their substance,\r\nfor the thoughts they utter and not for the manner of the utterance.\r\nJames Bryce would be considered an effective and even a commanding\r\nspeaker in any public assembly, but nevertheless, when the House of\r\nCommons and the public think of his speeches, these are thought of\r\nmainly for the truths they tell and the lessons they convey, and not for\r\nany quality of mere eloquence which adorns them. In a certain sense\r\nJames Bryce might be described as belonging to that Parliamentary order\r\nin the front of which John Morley stands just now; but of course John\r\nMorley has thus far had more administrative experience than James Bryce,\r\nand has taken a more distinct place as a Parliamentary and popular\r\nleader. Of both men, however, I should be inclined to say that their\r\npublic speeches lose something of the praise fairly due to them as mere\r\ndisplays of eloquence, because of the importance we all attach to their\r\nintellectual and educational influence.\r\n\r\nI may say also that James Bryce is not first and above all other things\r\na public man and a politician. He does not seem to have thought of a\r\nParliamentary career until after he had won for himself a high and\r\ncommanding position as a writer of history. Bryce is by birth an\r\nIrishman and belongs to that northern province of Ireland which is\r\npeopled to a large extent by Scottish immigrants. We are all rather too\r\napt to think of this Ulster province as essentially un-Irish, or even\r\nanti-Irish in tone and feeling, although some of the most extreme among\r\nIrish Nationalists, men like John Mitchell for instance, were born and\r\nbrought up in Ulster, and in more recent days some conspicuous Home\r\nRulers have sat in the House of Commons as representatives of Ulster\r\nconstituencies. James Bryce has always been an Irish Nationalist since\r\nhe came into public life, and has shown himself, whether in or out of\r\npolitical office, a steady and consistent supporter of the demand for\r\nIrish Home Rule. Indeed, I should be well inclined to believe that a\r\ndesire to render some personal service in promoting the just claims of\r\nIreland for a better system of government must have had much influence\r\nover Bryce's decision to accept a seat in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nBryce began his education in the University of Glasgow, from which he\r\npassed on to Oxford, where he won many honors and has left the memory of\r\na most successful career, not merely as student, but also as professor.\r\nHe studied for a while at Heidelberg, where he cultivated to the full\r\nhis previously acquired knowledge of German; and I have heard in later\r\nyears on good authority that while Bryce was a member of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernment he became a great favorite with Queen Victoria because of his\r\ncapacity for fluent speech in the language which the late Queen loved\r\nespecially to hear. Before he turned his attention to active political\r\nlife Bryce studied for the bar, became a member of the profession, and\r\nactually practiced in the Law Courts for some years. Thus far, however,\r\nhe had hardly given indication of the gifts which were destined to\r\nsecure for him a high and enduring place in English literature. Thus far\r\nhis life may be regarded as that of a student and a scholar; he had yet\r\nto give to the world the fruits of his scholarship. James Bryce is\r\nprobably above all things a scholar. He is, I may venture to say, the\r\nmost scholarly man in the House of Commons. I doubt whether there is in\r\nEngland so widely read a man in all departments of literature, art, and\r\nscience as Bryce, now that Lord Acton has been removed from us by death.\r\nLong before his entrance into Parliamentary life Bryce had obtained the\r\nhighest distinction as a writer of history. It is not too much to say\r\nthat his great historical work, \"The Holy Roman Empire,\" is destined to\r\nbe an English classic and a book for all countries and all times. The\r\nauthor could hardly add to the reputation he won by this masterpiece of\r\nhistorical study, insight, and labor, but it is only mere justice to say\r\nthat every work of importance which he afterwards gave to the world has\r\nmaintained his position in literature. His turn of mind has been always\r\nthat which distinguishes the practical student--the student of\r\nrealities, not the visionary or the dreamer, the man who, according to\r\nGoethe's phrase, is occupied more by the physical than by the\r\nmetaphysical. In 1877 he published a narrative of his travels in\r\nTranscaucasia, with an account of his ascent of Mount Ararat. I believe\r\nno other traveler has ever accomplished such a practical study of Mount\r\nArarat as that which was made by Mr. Bryce, and during a part of his\r\nexplorings he was absolutely alone, as he could not prevail upon the\r\nguides belonging to that region to overcome their superstitious dread of\r\nan intrusion on certain parts of the mountain. He was always fond of\r\ntravel, and was able to bring some fresh ideas out of places long\r\nfamiliar to tourists, and he gave to the world in English periodicals\r\nthe results of his experiences as a traveler. His descriptions of\r\nIcelandic scenery and of some rarely visited regions of Hungary and of\r\nPoland have a genuine literary as well as a genuine geographical value.\r\n\r\nHis most important work, after his great history of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire, is undoubtedly his book on \"The American Commonwealth,\"\r\npublished in 1888. This work has been read as generally and studied as\r\nclosely on the one side of the Atlantic as on the other. I have heard it\r\nspoken of with as thorough appreciation in New York, Boston, and\r\nWashington as in London, Manchester, and Liverpool. Many years have\r\npassed since an eminent English public man, not now living, expressed\r\nto me an earnest wish that some European writer would take up the story\r\nof the great American Commonwealth just where De Tocqueville left it in\r\nhis \"De la Démocratie en Amérique.\" I joined cordially in his ideas and\r\nhis wishes, and we discussed the qualifications of certain Englishmen\r\nfor the task if any of them could see his way to undertake it, but\r\nneither of us seemed to be quite satisfied that we had named the right\r\nman for the work. At the time it did not occur to either of us that the\r\nhistorian of \"The Holy Roman Empire\" would be likely to turn his\r\nattention to the story of the American Commonwealth. Indeed, the two\r\nstudies seemed to me so entirely different and uncongenial that if the\r\nname of James Bryce had been suggested to me at the time I should\r\nprobably have put it aside without much hesitation. One could hardly\r\nhave looked for so much versatility even in Mr. Bryce as to favor the\r\nexpectation that he could accomplish, with something like equal success,\r\ntwo historical works dealing with such totally different subjects and\r\nrequiring such different methods of analysis and contemplation.\r\n\r\nMore lately still Mr. Bryce brought out his \"Impressions of South\r\nAfrica.\" This book was published in 1897, and the time of its\r\npublication was most appropriate. It appeared when the prospects of a\r\nwar with the Transvaal Republic were opening gloomily for the lovers of\r\npeace and fair dealing in England. If Mr. Bryce's impressions of South\r\nAfrica could only have been appreciated, and allowed to have their just\r\ninfluence with the leaders of the Conservative party at that critical\r\ntime, England might have been saved from a long and futile war, and from\r\nmuch serious discredit in the general opinion of the civilized world.\r\nBut if Bryce had spoken with the tongue of an angel, he could not at\r\nsuch a time have prevailed against the rising passion of Jingoism and\r\nthe overmastering influence of mining speculators. It is only right to\r\nsay that the book was in no sense a mere distended political pamphlet.\r\nIt was not meant as a counterblast to Jingoism, or as a glorification of\r\nthe Boer Republic. It was a fair and temperate statement of the author's\r\nobservations in South Africa, and of the general conclusions to which\r\nhis experience and his study had brought him. Bryce pointed out with\r\nperfect frankness the defects and dangers he saw in the Boer system of\r\ngovernment, and even the most ferocious Jingo could hardly have felt\r\njustified in describing the author by that most terrible epithet, a\r\n\"pro-Boer.\" The warning which Bryce gave, and gave in vain, to the\r\nEnglish Government and the English majority, was a warning against the\r\ncredulous acceptation of one-sided testimony, against the fond belief\r\nthat the proclamation of Imperialism carried with it the right to\r\nintervene in the affairs of every foreign State, and against the theory\r\nthat troops and gold mines warrant any enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary career of James Bryce began in 1880, when he was\r\nelected as Liberal representative for a London constituency. He did\r\ngreat work in the cause of national education, and took an important\r\npart in two State Commissions appointed to conduct inquiries into the\r\nworking of the public schools. At a later period he was chosen to\r\nrepresent a Scottish constituency, and when Mr. Gladstone came into\r\npower as the head of a Government Bryce received the important office of\r\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. At that time his chief, the\r\nSecretary for Foreign Affairs, was a member of the House of Lords, and\r\ntherefore the whole work of representing the department in the House of\r\nCommons, where alone any important debates on foreign questions are\r\nconducted, fell on Mr. Bryce, who had the entire conduct of such\r\ndiscussions on behalf of the administration. The department was one\r\nwhich gave an effective opportunity for the display of Bryce's intimate\r\nknowledge of foreign countries, and he acquitted himself with all the\r\nsuccess which might have been expected from one of his intellect, his\r\nexperience, and his enlightened views. Later still he became Chancellor\r\nof the Duchy of Lancaster, and for the first time had a seat in the\r\nCabinet. The Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster is one of a small\r\norder of English administrative offices which have comparatively\r\nunimportant duties attached to their special administration, and leave\r\nthe man in possession ample time to lend his assistance, both in the\r\nCabinet and in the House of Commons, to all the great public questions\r\nwhich occupy the attention of the Government. In 1894 he became\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade, one of the most important positions in\r\nany administration. Bryce's official career came to a close for the\r\npresent when the Liberal party lost their majority in the representative\r\nchamber, and the Conservatives got into power and secured the\r\nadministrative position they are holding at the present day. Nothing can\r\nbe more certain than that the first really Liberal administration which\r\nis again formed will assign to Mr. Bryce one of the highest places in\r\nits Cabinet and in its work. Since he has come to sit on the benches of\r\nOpposition he has taken part in many great debates, and is always\r\nlistened to with the most profound attention. He is one of the few\r\nleaders of the Liberal party who were manful and outspoken in their\r\nopposition to the policy which originated and carried on the late South\r\nAfrican war. He has taken a conspicuous part in every debate upon\r\nsubjects of foreign policy, of national education, and of political\r\nadvancement. He has never acted as a mere partisan, and his intervention\r\nin debate is all the more influential as it is well understood that he\r\nadvocates a policy because he believes it to be right and not because of\r\nany effect it may have in bringing himself and his Liberal colleagues\r\nback again into power.\r\n\r\nI have often noticed the effect produced in the libraries and\r\ncommittee-rooms, in the rooms assigned to those who dine and to those\r\nwho smoke, when the news is passed round that Mr. Bryce is on his feet.\r\nA member who is reading up some subject in the library, or writing his\r\nletters in one of the lobbies, or enjoying himself in a dining-hall or a\r\nsmoking-room, is not likely to hurry away from his occupation or his\r\nenjoyment in order to rush into the debating chamber merely because he\r\nis told that some leading member of the Government or the Opposition has\r\njust begun to address the House. The man who is addressing an audience\r\nin the debating chamber may hold an important office in the Government\r\nor may have an important place on the Front Bench of Opposition, but\r\nthen he may be a personage who feels bound to take part in a debate\r\nmerely because of the position he holds, and every one knows in advance\r\nwhat views he is certain to advocate and what line of argument he is\r\nlikely to adopt, and our reading or dining or smoking friend may not\r\nthink that there is any pressing necessity for his presence as a\r\nlistener in the House. But there are some leading men on both sides of\r\nMr. Speaker who are always sure to have something to say which\r\neverybody wants to hear, and Mr. Bryce is unquestionably one of that\r\nhappily endowed order. When the word goes round that Bryce is up,\r\neverybody knows that something will be said on which he cannot exactly\r\ncalculate beforehand, something to which it is important that he should\r\nlisten, and there is forthwith a rush of members into the debating\r\nchamber. There can hardly be a higher tribute to a man's importance as a\r\ndebater than the fact that his rising to address the House creates such\r\nan effect, and I have seen it created again and again whenever the news\r\nwent round that \"Bryce is on his legs.\" I have many a time heard\r\nConservative members murmur, in tones not altogether expressing absolute\r\nsatisfaction at the disturbing information, \"Bryce is up--I must go in\r\nand hear what he has to say.\" The tribute is all the higher in this case\r\nbecause Bryce is not one of the showy and fascinating debaters whom\r\neverybody wants to listen to for the mere eloquence and fascination of\r\ntheir oratorical displays. Everybody knows that when he speaks it is\r\nbecause he has something to say which ought to be spoken and therefore\r\nought to be heard. It is known that Bryce will not make a speech merely\r\nbecause he thinks the time has come when some leader of Opposition\r\nought to take part in the debate, if only to show that the Opposition is\r\nattending to its business.\r\n\r\nThis command over the House Bryce has always held since he became one of\r\nits members, and no man can hold a more desirable and a more honorable\r\nposition. It is all the more to his credit because he does not aim at\r\nmere originality and never makes it a part of his ambition to say\r\nsomething astonishing and thus to excite and delight the mere curiosity\r\nof his audience. There have been and still are many members of the House\r\nwho have made a reputation of this kind and are therefore always sure to\r\ncommand a full attendance merely because everybody expects that when\r\nthey rise to their feet they are sure to make the House \"sit up,\" if I\r\nmay use this somewhat colloquial, not to say vulgar, phrase. Take such a\r\nman, for instance, as the late John Arthur Roebuck, a man of great\r\nintellect, master of a peculiar style of eloquence, who made himself\r\nonly too often a splendid specimen of what might be called in American\r\nphraseology \"a crank.\" All that could be said with certainty beforehand\r\nof Roebuck was that whenever he rose to speak he would say something\r\ncalculated to startle or to puzzle the House. There are men of the same\r\norder, if not perhaps of quite the same debating qualifications, in the\r\nHouse at present--men who always draw a rush of members when they rise\r\nto speak because nobody can tell in advance what side they are likely to\r\nadvocate or what sort of bewildering paradox they may set up and make\r\ninteresting if not convincing by the force of their peculiar style of\r\neloquence. Bryce is emphatically not a man of this order. He is no lover\r\nof paradox; he has no desire to create a sensation; he merely wants to\r\nimpress the House with what he believes to be the truth, and his great\r\nquality is that of a beacon and not of a flashlight. His arguments\r\nappeal to the intellect and the reasoning power; he speaks of what he\r\nknows; he has large resources of thought, experience, and observation to\r\ndraw upon, and the listeners feel convinced beforehand that he will tell\r\nthem something they did not know already, or will put his case in some\r\nnew and striking light.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons well knows that it would lose one of its most\r\nvaluable instructors if Bryce were no longer to occupy a place on its\r\nbenches or were to condemn himself to habitual inactivity and silence.\r\nWhen the Conservative Government under Lord Salisbury came into power,\r\nand more especially after the late general election which brought them\r\nback with added strength, many of the Liberal leaders seemed to have\r\ngrown weary of the political struggle. Something worse than mere apathy\r\nappeared to have set in, something more than mere despondency and\r\ndisheartenment. Men on whom the Liberals of England had long been wont\r\nto rely suddenly showed an apparent loss of faith in all the proclaimed\r\nprinciples of the party, and either relapsed into utter silence or spoke\r\nin language which suggested an inclination to cross over to the enemy's\r\ncamp. The two principal impulses to this mood of mind were the South\r\nAfrican war and the Irish Home Rule question. The majority in the\r\nconstituencies had become inflamed with the spirit of Jingoism, and\r\ncould think of nothing but the war and the Imperial glory of annexing\r\nnew territory. Feeble-hearted and weak-kneed Liberals began to think\r\nthat the party could never hope for a return to power unless it too\r\ncould blow the Imperial trumpet. Other Liberals made it manifest that\r\nthey were becoming alarmed by the unpopularity of the Home Rule\r\nquestion, and were repenting the enthusiasm which had carried them too\r\nfar along the path marked out by the genius and the patriotic resolve of\r\nGladstone. A species of dry-rot appeared to have broken out in\r\nLiberalism. Before long a new section of Liberalism was formed, the\r\nprinciple of which appeared to be that its members should call\r\nthemselves Imperial Liberals, and at the same time should support the\r\nTories on the only important questions then under discussion--the policy\r\nof the South African campaign and the Irish National claim for Home\r\nRule. Some of the men who had held high office when Gladstone was in\r\npower, who had made themselves conspicuous by the ardor and the\r\neloquence with which they supported his policy of peace abroad and\r\njustice to Ireland, now openly avowed their renunciation of his great\r\nprinciples. There were others among the foremost Liberals in the House\r\nof Commons who, if they did not thus openly take the renegade part, kept\r\nthemselves quietly out of the active political field and allowed the\r\nmovement of reaction to go on without a word of protest. Three at least\r\namong the Liberal leaders took a very different course. Three of them,\r\nat least, not merely nailed their colors to the mast, but stood\r\nresolutely in fighting attitude beneath the colors and proved themselves\r\ndetermined to maintain the struggle. These three men were Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, John Morley, and James Bryce. There were others,\r\ntoo, it must be said, who stood up manfully with these three in defense\r\nof that losing cause of Liberalism which they could never be brought to\r\nregard as a lost cause. But the dauntless three whom I have just\r\nmentioned were the most prominent and the most influential who went\r\nforth against that great array of Toryism and Jingoism. Bryce was in his\r\nplace as regularly as ever during the whole of that depressing time, and\r\nhe never failed to raise his voice when the occasion demanded his\r\nintervention on behalf of the true principles and practices of\r\nLiberalism. During that long, dreary, and disheartening season when\r\ndespondent men were often disposed to ask whether there was any longer a\r\nLiberal party, Bryce made some of the ablest speeches he has ever\r\ndelivered in arraignment of the Jingo policy, of the War Office\r\nmaladministration, and the rule of renewed coercion in Ireland. The\r\nLiberal cause in England owes a debt that never can be forgotten to the\r\nthree men whom I have named, for their unflinching resolve and activity\r\nin the House of Commons; and of the three none did better service than\r\nthat which was rendered by James Bryce.\r\n\r\nBryce has, in face and form, the characteristics of a stalwart fighter.\r\nHis forehead is high and broad, with strongly marked eyebrows,\r\nstraightly drawn over deep and penetrating eyes. The features are all\r\nfinely modeled, the nose is straight and statuesque, the hair is\r\nbecoming somewhat thinner and more gray than it was when I first knew\r\nMr. Bryce, but the mustache and beard, although they too show some\r\nfading in color, are still thick and strong as in that past day. The\r\nface does not look Irish; its expression is perhaps somewhat too sedate\r\nand resolute; but on the other hand, it does not seem quite Scotch, for\r\nthere is at moments a suggestion of dreaminess about it which we do not\r\nusually associate with the shrewd North Briton. Bryce is a man of the\r\nmost genial temperament, thoroughly companionable, and capable of\r\nenjoying every influence that helps to brighten existence. Always a\r\nstudent of books and of men, he is never a recluse, and I do not know of\r\nany one who seems to get more out of life than does this philosophic\r\nhistorian. Bryce's London home is noted for its hospitality, and his\r\ndinner parties and evening parties give much delight to his large circle\r\nof friends. Mr. and Mrs. Bryce are not lion-hunters, and do not rate\r\ntheir friends according to the degree of celebrity each may have\r\nobtained. But they have no need to engage in a hunt after lions, for the\r\ncelebrities seek them out as a matter of course, and I know of no London\r\nhouse where one is more certain to meet distinguished men and women from\r\nall parts of the civilized world. Bryce's travels have made him\r\nacquainted with interesting and eminent persons everywhere, and an\r\nadmission to his circle is naturally sought by strangers who visit\r\nLondon. Representatives of literature, science, and art, of scholarly\r\nresearch, of political movement, and of traveled experience are sure to\r\nbe met with in the home of the Bryces. I had the good fortune to meet\r\nthere, for the first time, many distinguished men and women whose\r\nacquaintance it was a high and memorable privilege to make. Among\r\nBryce's especial recreations is mountain-climbing, and he was at one\r\ntime President of the Alpine Club. He can converse upon all subjects,\r\ncan give to every topic some illustration from his own ideas and his own\r\nexperiences, and the intelligent listener always finds that he carries\r\naway something new and worthy of remembrance from any talk with him.\r\nAlthough his strong opinions and his earnest desire to maintain what he\r\nbelieves to be the right side of every great controversy have naturally\r\nbrought him into frequent antagonism with the representatives of many an\r\nimportant case, I do not know of any public man who has made fewer\r\nenemies or who is more generally spoken of with respect and admiration.\r\nA man must have very high conceit indeed of his own knowledge and his\r\nown judgment who does not feel that he has a great deal to learn from\r\nconversation with a master of so many subjects. Yet Bryce never\r\noppresses a listener, as some intellectual leaders are apt to do, with a\r\nsense of the listener's inferiority, and the least gifted among us is\r\nencouraged to express himself with frankness and freedom while\r\ndiscoursing with Bryce on any question which happens to come up. I think\r\nthat among his many remarkable qualities is that sincere belief which\r\nwas characteristic of Mr. Gladstone, and for which Gladstone did not\r\nalways get due credit--the belief that every man, however moderate his\r\nintellectual qualifications, has something to tell which the wisest\r\nwould be the better for knowing. We must all of us have met scholars and\r\nthinkers and political leaders whose inborn sense of their own capacity\r\nhad an overbearing and even oppressive effect on the ordinary mortal,\r\nand made him shy of expressing himself fully lest he should only be\r\ndisplaying his ineptitude or his ignorance in such a presence. But there\r\nis nothing of this to be observed in the genial ways of James Bryce, and\r\nthe listener finds himself unconsciously brought for the time to the\r\nlevel of the master and emboldened to give free utterance to his own\r\nideas and opinions.\r\n\r\nBryce has been made a member of most of the great intellectual and\r\neducational institutions of the world, has held degrees and honors of\r\nvarious kinds from the universities of Europe and the United States, and\r\ncould hardly travel anywhere abroad or at home without finding himself\r\nin recognized association with some school of learning in every place\r\nwhere he makes a stay. The freemasonry of intellect and education all\r\nover the world gives him rank among its members, and receives him with a\r\nwelcome recognition wherever he goes. I presume that in the political\r\nsphere of action he is henceforward likely to find his congenial\r\ncareer, but he must always have the knowledge that, if for any reason he\r\nshould give up his political occupation, he can at any moment return to\r\nsome pursuit in which he has already won an established fame. There are\r\nnot many political leaders of our time about whom the same could fairly\r\nbe said. For myself I may frankly say that I hope James Bryce will\r\nhenceforward devote himself especially to that political career in which\r\nhe has accomplished such great things. English public life cannot well\r\nafford to lose his services just now or for some time to come. A man who\r\ncan bring to political work such resources of thought and of experience,\r\nwho can look beneath the surface and above the mere phrases and\r\ncatchwords of political parties, who can see that Liberalism in its true\r\nsense must mean progress, and who can at the same time see clearly for\r\nhimself what progress really means, and in what direction and by what\r\nmethods it is to be made--such a man could ill be spared by the\r\nLiberalism of our generation. The historical work he has already done\r\nis, in its way, complete and imperishable. But the Liberal party has yet\r\nto recover its place and to regain the leadership of England's\r\npolitical life. Every effort the Conservatives in office have lately\r\nbeen making to hold their full mastery over the country has shown more\r\nand more clearly that they have not kept up with the movements of\r\nthought and are not able to understand the true requirements of the\r\ntime. On the other hand, the limp and shattered condition of the\r\nexisting Liberal party only shows the absolute necessity for the\r\nrecognized leadership of men who understand the difference between the\r\nwork of guiding the country and the ignoble function of competing for\r\npower by imitation and by compromise. In the new effort now so sorely\r\nneeded to create once more a true Liberal party, the country requires,\r\nabove all things else, the constant service of such men as James\r\nBryce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph copyright by London Stereoscopic Co.\r\n\r\nSIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has but lately come to hold that position\r\nin the House of Commons and in the political world which those who knew\r\nhim well always believed him destined to attain. He is now not merely\r\nthe nominal leader of the Liberal Opposition in the House of Commons,\r\nbut he is universally regarded as one of the very small number of men\r\nwho could possibly be chosen for the place. Sir William Harcourt and Mr.\r\nJohn Morley are the only Liberal members of the House who could compare\r\nwith Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman for influence with the Liberal party,\r\nthe House of Commons, and the general public. Yet the time is not far\r\ndistant when he was commonly regarded in the House as a somewhat heavy,\r\nnot to say stolid, man, one of whom nothing better could be said than\r\nthat he would probably be capable of quiet, steady work in some\r\nsubordinate department. I remember well that when Campbell-Bannerman\r\nwas appointed Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1884,\r\na witty Irish member explained the appointment by the suggestion that\r\nGladstone had made use of Campbell-Bannerman on the principle\r\nillustrated by the employment of a sand-bag as part of the defenses of a\r\nmilitary fort. Campbell-Bannerman has, in fact, none of the temperament\r\nwhich makes a man anxious to display himself in debate, and whenever,\r\nduring his earlier years of Parliamentary life, he delivered a speech in\r\nthe House of Commons, his desire seemed to be to get through the task as\r\nquickly as possible and be done with it. He appears to be a man of a\r\nnaturally reserved habit, with indeed something of shyness about him,\r\nand a decided capacity for silence wherever there is no pressing\r\noccasion for speech, whether in public or in private.\r\n\r\nMany whom I knew were at one time inclined to regard Campbell-Bannerman\r\nas a typical specimen of his Scottish compatriots, who are facetiously\r\nsaid to joke with difficulty. As a matter of fact, Campbell-Bannerman\r\nhas a keen and delightful sense of humor, and can illustrate the\r\nweakness of an opponent's case, better than some recognized wits could\r\ndo, by a few happy touches of sarcasm. He is in every sense of the word\r\na strong man, and, like some other strong men, only seems to know his\r\nown strength and to be capable of putting it into action when hard\r\nfortune has brought him into political difficulties through which it\r\nappears well-nigh impossible that he can make his way. Schiller's hero\r\ndeclares that it must be night before his star can shine, and although\r\nCampbell-Bannerman is not quite so poetic and picturesque a figure as\r\nWallenstein, yet I think he might fairly comfort himself by some such\r\nencouraging reflection. He had gone through a long and hard-working\r\ncareer in the House of Commons before the world came to know anything of\r\nhis strength, his judgment, and his courage. He got his education at the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow and afterwards at Trinity College, Cambridge, and\r\nhe obtained a seat in the House of Commons for a Scottish constituency\r\nas a Liberal when he was still but a young man. He has held various\r\noffices in Liberal administrations. He was Secretary to the Admiralty in\r\n1882, and was Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland for a\r\nshort time a little later. There is not much to be said about his Irish\r\nadministration. He governed the country about as well as any English\r\nMinister could have done under such conditions, for this was before\r\nGladstone and the Liberal party had been converted to the principle of\r\nHome Rule for Ireland; and, at all events, he made himself agreeable to\r\nthose Irishmen with whom he came into contact by his unaffected manners\r\nand his quiet good humor. When Gladstone took office in 1886,\r\nCampbell-Bannerman became Secretary for War, and he held the same\r\nimportant position in Gladstone's Ministry of 1892.\r\n\r\nThe story of that administration tells of a most important epoch in the\r\ncareer of Gladstone and the fortunes of the Liberal party. In 1893\r\nGladstone brought in his second Home Rule measure for Ireland. His first\r\nmeasure of Home Rule was introduced in 1886, and was defeated in the\r\nHouse of Commons by means of a coalition between the Liberal\r\nsecessionists and the Conservative Opposition. The Liberal secessionists\r\nin the House of Commons, as most of my readers will remember, were led\r\nby Joseph Chamberlain. Then there came an interval of Conservative\r\ngovernment, and when Gladstone returned to power in 1892 he introduced\r\nbefore long his second measure of Home Rule. The second measure was in\r\nmany ways a distinct improvement on the first, and in the meantime some\r\nof the Liberal secessionists, including Sir George Trevelyan, whose\r\nopposition was directed only against certain parts of the first measure,\r\nhad returned to their allegiance and were ready to give Gladstone all\r\nthe support in their power for his second attempt. The Home Rule measure\r\nwas carried through the House of Commons by what we call a substantial\r\nalthough not a great majority, and then it had to go to the House of\r\nLords. Everybody knew in advance what its fate must be in the hereditary\r\nchamber. Every great measure of genuine political reform is certain to\r\nbe rejected in the first instance by the House of Lords. This is the old\r\nstory, and is repeated again and again with monotonous iteration. The\r\nHouse of Lords always gives way in the end, when the pressure of public\r\nopinion from without makes it perilous for the hereditary legislators to\r\nmaintain their opposition. Therefore the Liberals in general were not\r\nmuch disconcerted by the defeat of the Home Rule measure in the House of\r\nLords. Home Rule for Ireland had been sanctioned by the decisive vote\r\nof the House of Commons, and the general impression was that it would\r\nonly have to be brought in again and perhaps again, according to the\r\nusual process with all reform measures, until the opposition of the\r\nLords had been completely borne down. But before the introduction of the\r\nsecond Home Rule measure, some events had taken place which made a great\r\nchange in the condition of Irish political affairs and put fresh\r\ndifficulties in the way of Gladstone's new administration.\r\n\r\nThe Parnell divorce case came on, and led to a serious division in the\r\nranks of the Irish National party and in Irish public opinion. The great\r\nmajority of Parnell's followers refused to regard him as their leader\r\nany longer, and those who determined to support him and to follow him\r\nthrough thick and thin were but a very small minority. Gladstone was\r\nfirmly convinced, as were the majority of the Irish Nationalist members,\r\nthat Parnell ought to retire, for a time at least, from the leadership\r\nof his party, if not indeed from public life, and keep aloof from active\r\npolitics until the scandal of the divorce court should have been atoned\r\nfor by him and should have passed to some extent from public memory.\r\nGladstone was convinced that if Parnell remained the leader of the\r\nIrish party it would be almost impossible to arouse in the British\r\nconstituencies any enthusiasm in the cause of Home Rule strong enough to\r\nbring back the Liberals to power and to carry a Home Rule measure. This\r\nwas a reasonable and practical view of the question, but Parnell and his\r\nfollowers resented it as a positive insult, and Parnell issued a\r\nmanifesto denouncing Gladstone, the immediate result of which was that\r\nbreak-up of the Home Rule party I have already mentioned. Not very long\r\nafter came Parnell's early death. It may well be supposed that such\r\nevents as these must have made a deep and discouraging impression on\r\nGladstone's hopes for the success of the second Home Rule measure. The\r\nIrish National party had been broken up for the time, and some even of\r\nGladstone's colleagues in office had allowed themselves to be mastered\r\nby the old familiar idea that as Irishmen could not be brought to agree\r\nfor long on any plan of action, it was futile for English Liberals to\r\nput themselves to any inconvenience for the sake of an Irish National\r\ncause. Such men might have found it difficult to point out any great\r\nmeasure of political reform in England concerning which the English\r\npeople had always been in absolute agreement and about which there was\r\nno conflict of angry emotion in any section of English representatives.\r\nBut the fact remained all the same that the dispute in the Irish party\r\nhad brought a chill to the zeal of many influential English Liberals for\r\nthe Home Rule cause, and we have had in much more recent days abundant\r\nevidence that the chilling influence is with them still.\r\n\r\nAmong Gladstone's official colleagues there were some who held that the\r\ntime had come when an appeal ought to be made to the country by means of\r\na dissolution and a general election against the domination of the House\r\nof Lords. This appears to have been the opinion of Gladstone himself.\r\nOthers of his colleagues, however, held back from such an issue, and\r\ncontended that the moment did not seem favorable for an appeal to the\r\ncountry on the distinct question of Irish Home Rule. The general\r\nimpression on the public mind was that the decision of the Cabinet was\r\ncertain to be in favor of an appeal to the country on the one issue or\r\nthe other, and much surprise was felt when it began to be more and more\r\nevident that the Government intended to go on with the ordinary\r\nbusiness of the State, as if nothing had happened. The outer world has\r\nas yet had no means of knowing what the reasons or the influences were\r\nwhich induced Gladstone and his colleagues to come to this\r\ndetermination. The whole truth will probably never be known until John\r\nMorley's \"Life of Gladstone\" shall make its appearance. We may safely\r\nassume in the meantime that Gladstone had the best of reasons for taking\r\nthe course which he adopted, and that he would have made an appeal to\r\nthe country against the decision of the House of Lords if he had\r\nbelieved the conditions were favorable for such a challenge just then.\r\nProbably Gladstone knew only too well that even among his own colleagues\r\nthere were some who were turning cold upon the question of Home Rule,\r\nwho had never accepted his views on that subject with whole-hearted\r\nwillingness, and could not have been relied upon as steadfast adherents\r\nin the struggle. I think I shall be fully justified by any revelations\r\nwhich history or biography has yet to make, when I say that\r\nCampbell-Bannerman was among those who would have faithfully followed\r\nthe great leader to the very last in whatever struggle he had made up\r\nhis mind to engage. There were, of course, many others of Gladstone's\r\ncolleagues--men like Sir William Harcourt and John Morley and James\r\nBryce--on whom their leader could have safely reckoned for the same\r\nunswerving fidelity and courage. But, whatever were the reasons, there\r\nwas no appeal made to the country, and the administration went on with\r\nits ordinary work in a dull, mechanical fashion. The effect upon the\r\nLiberal party was most depressing. Men could not understand why nothing\r\ndecisive had been done, and at the same time were haunted by a\r\nforeboding that some great change was impending over the Liberal party.\r\n\r\nThe foreboding soon came to be justified. On the 1st of March, 1894,\r\nGladstone delivered his last speech in the House of Commons. The speech\r\ndealt with the action of the House of Lords on a subject of\r\ncomparatively slight importance. The Lords had rejected a measure\r\ndealing with the constitution of parish councils, which had been passed\r\nby the House of Commons. Gladstone spoke with severity in condemnation\r\nof the course taken by the House of Lords. Towards the close of his\r\nspeech he said: \"My duty terminates with calling the attention of this\r\nHouse to a fact which it is really impossible to set aside, that we are\r\nconsidering a part--an essential and inseparable part--of a question\r\nenormously large, a question which has become profoundly a truth, a\r\nquestion that will demand a settlement, and must at an early date\r\nreceive that settlement, from the highest authority.\" No one who was\r\npresent in the House when this declaration was made is ever likely to\r\nlose the memory of the scene, although not all or even most of those\r\nthen present quite realized the full significance of Gladstone's words.\r\nThere were many in the House who did not at once understand that in the\r\nwords I have quoted the greatest Parliamentary leader of modern times\r\nwas speaking his farewell to public life. I remember well that a few\r\nmoments after Gladstone had finished his speech I met John Morley in one\r\nof the lobbies, and I asked him if this was really to be taken as the\r\nclose of Gladstone's career, and he told me, with as much composure as\r\nhe could command, that in that speech we had heard the last of\r\nGladstone's Parliamentary utterances. That was indeed a memorable day in\r\nthe history of England, and a day at least equally memorable in the\r\nhistory of Ireland.\r\n\r\nI have had to dwell for a while on these historical facts, facts of\r\ncourse known already to all my readers, as a prelude to the most\r\nimportant passages in the Parliamentary career of Campbell-Bannerman.\r\nWhen Gladstone resigned office and withdrew from public life, the\r\nquestion of reconstituting the Liberal administration had to be taken\r\ninto account. There could be no doubt whatever that the Liberal\r\nadministration had been much weakened and even discredited by the manner\r\nin which it had put up with the domineering action of the House of\r\nLords. The effect on public opinion was all the greater and the more\r\ndisheartening because it was generally understood that the absence of\r\nany such action must have been due to the fact that some of Gladstone's\r\nleading colleagues were not prepared to sustain him in the policy he was\r\nanxious to carry out. There was therefore a state of something like\r\napathy in the minds of advanced Radicals with regard to any arrangements\r\nwhich seemed likely to be made for the reconstruction of the Ministry.\r\nThe new administration was formed under the leadership of Lord Rosebery,\r\nas Prime Minister, in the House of Lords, and that of Sir William\r\nHarcourt, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the House of Commons. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the composition of the new Ministry was\r\nregarded as unsatisfactory by the more advanced Liberals in and outside\r\nParliament. The Liberal party is never of late years quite content with\r\nan administration which has its Prime Minister in the House of Lords.\r\nThe real work must always be done in the House of Commons, and it is\r\nobviously most inconvenient that the leader of the Government should be\r\none whose position will not allow him to have a seat in the\r\nrepresentative chamber. The condition of things is something like that\r\nof an army whose Commander-in-Chief can never make his appearance in the\r\nencampment or take part in any of the great battles. Even at that time\r\nLord Rosebery, although a most brilliant debater and a capable\r\nadministrator, was beginning to be regarded as one whose Liberalism\r\nwas somewhat losing color and whose whole heart was by no means in\r\nthe advanced policy of Gladstone. There was nothing better to be\r\ndone, however, at the time than to make the most of the altered\r\nconditions, and the new Ministry went to work as well as it could.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, as Secretary for War, had an opportunity of proving\r\nhis genuine capacity for the duties of his important office. He\r\nintroduced a new and complete scheme of army reform, which, among other\r\nand even more important changes, proposed to bring about the retirement\r\nof the Duke of Cambridge from the post of Commander-in-Chief. The Duke\r\nof Cambridge was even then a man far advanced in years, who had never in\r\nhis life shown any real capacity for the work of commanding an army, and\r\nwhose chief recommendation for so great a position must have been found\r\nin the fact that he was a member of the royal family. The new measure\r\nwas making its way steadily enough through the House of Commons, and\r\nevery one was beginning to see that in Campbell-Bannerman the country\r\nhad found an administrator of a very high order. Suddenly, however, the\r\nprogress of the measure was interrupted by what seemed to be at first\r\nonly a trivial accident, of which the public in general were inclined to\r\ntake but little account. The army reform scheme had arrived at what is\r\nknown as the committee stage of its progress.\r\n\r\nI do not desire to occupy the attention of my readers more than is\r\nactually necessary with the mere technical details of Parliamentary\r\nprocedure, and I shall only explain that when a Bill reaches the\r\ncommittee stage its general principle must have been already accepted by\r\nthe majority in the House, and the House then forms itself into\r\nCommittee for the purpose of discussing the mere details of the proposed\r\narrangements. During one of the sittings a Conservative member proposed\r\na motion declaring that the Government, or at least the War Office, had\r\nnot made proper provision for the supply of the material of cordite to\r\nthe army. This was so purely a technical question, concerning which only\r\nsoldiers and scientific men could be supposed to have had any means of\r\nforming an opinion, that the House troubled itself very little about the\r\nwhole discussion. But when the House came to take a division on the\r\nproposal, the Government was defeated by a majority of seven. This\r\ndefeat produced at first only a very slight effect on the House in\r\ngeneral. During the committee stage of a measure it is quite a matter of\r\nordinary occurrence that a Ministry should be defeated on some question\r\nof mere arrangement and detail, and very few in the House of Commons\r\nsuspected on that occasion that such a vote was likely to bring with it\r\nan important Parliamentary crisis. Campbell-Bannerman, however, took a\r\nvery different view of the event. He appears to have made up his mind\r\nthat the decision of the House was a distinct vote of censure on his\r\nadministration, and that he could not continue to hold office after so\r\nmarked a declaration of disapproval. Now, it may be taken for granted\r\nthat Campbell-Bannerman was not merely actuated by any personal feeling,\r\nby any sense of mere grievance to himself, when he made up his mind to\r\nthis resolve. He saw clearly that the Government had lost the confidence\r\nand the support of the country, and that the sooner the whole futile\r\nattempt at administration under such conditions came to an end the\r\nbetter it would be for the business of the State. He knew perfectly well\r\nthat the Liberal administration was falling to pieces, that its leading\r\nmembers were no longer inspired alike by one great policy, that some of\r\nits leaders had ceased to be Liberals in the traditional meaning of the\r\nword, and that sooner or later the catastrophe must come. Those of\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's colleagues who were as genuine and stanch Liberals\r\nas he soon came into agreement with him as to the course that ought to\r\nbe pursued, and it was known before long in the House of Commons that\r\nthe Liberal Ministers had resigned their offices and that the\r\nlong-postponed appeal to the country was to be made at last. Thus for\r\nthe first time it became known to the public that Campbell-Bannerman was\r\nalready a power in political life.\r\n\r\nParliament was dissolved and the appeal to the country was made at the\r\ngeneral election which necessarily followed. Few Liberals had the\r\nslightest doubt as to the result of the appeal. Some of the very\r\nmeasures introduced by the fallen Government which had the strong\r\napproval of many advanced Liberals had put certain powerful interests\r\nand classes against those who represented this policy. Sir William\r\nHarcourt's \"death duties\" had aroused the indignation of rich men here,\r\nthere, and everywhere. The measures which the same statesman had\r\nendeavored to carry for putting the liquor trade under the control of\r\n\"local option\" had turned the publicans into an organized opposition\r\nagainst Liberal administrators. The result of the general election was\r\nthe defeat of the Liberal party, and the formation of a Conservative\r\nGovernment with Lord Salisbury at its head holding office as Prime\r\nMinister and Foreign Secretary at once, and with Arthur Balfour as First\r\nLord of the Treasury and leader of the House of Commons. The Liberals\r\nwere weakened in every sense, not merely by the fact that they had come\r\nback to Parliament no longer as a Government but only as an Opposition.\r\nThey were rendered by their internal divisions too weak for effective\r\nwork as an Opposition. Lord Rosebery continued for the time to act as\r\nleader of the Liberal party, while Sir William Harcourt of course became\r\nleader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. It soon was quite\r\nclear that the Liberal party could not work together so far as its\r\nleaders were concerned. It was evident that men like Harcourt and John\r\nMorley and Campbell-Bannerman could not act in any cordial union with\r\nLord Rosebery and those Liberals who accepted Lord Rosebery's policy.\r\nThe result of all this was that Lord Rosebery resigned the leadership of\r\nthe party and has ever since seemed inclined to start a Liberal party of\r\nhis own, and that Sir William Harcourt did not believe he was likely to\r\nreceive such a united support in the House of Commons as would enable\r\nhim to maintain the leadership of the party with any satisfaction to\r\nhimself or the country. Harcourt therefore ceased to hold that position;\r\nand now came for the first time the opportunity for Campbell-Bannerman.\r\nHe was chosen leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, and\r\nhe had before him, under all the conditions, a task which might well\r\nhave seemed hopeless. Lord Rosebery has, from that time to this,\r\ndelivered speeches all over the country which could only be interpreted\r\nas the expression of his desire to call into being a new Liberal party\r\nprofessing a political creed differing in its main characteristics from\r\nthat which had been proclaimed and carried on by Gladstone. Rosebery\r\nrenounced Home Rule for Ireland, and refused to act on Gladstone's\r\nprinciples with regard to the protection of Christians in the East\r\nagainst the alternating tyranny and neglect of the Ottoman Government.\r\n\r\nNever within my recollection had any leader of a Liberal party in\r\nthe House of Commons come into a position of such difficulty and\r\ndisheartenment as that which Campbell-Bannerman had now to maintain. It\r\nhas often been the lot of the Liberal party to come into the House\r\nof Commons with diminished numbers, and have to carry on as best\r\nit could be done the battle against a Conservative Government of\r\noverwhelming numerical strength. But the peculiar trouble which beset\r\nCampbell-Bannerman was that he could not count upon the allegiance of\r\nall his nominal followers. He knew that so long as he showed himself\r\ndetermined to maintain the policy of Gladstone he could reckon without\r\nfear on the support of such men as Harcourt and John Morley and Bryce.\r\nBut there were able men among those who occupied the front bench of\r\nOpposition on whom he could not always count, men who were publicly\r\ndisplaying themselves as the political associates or followers of Lord\r\nRosebery. Campbell-Bannerman went boldly and steadfastly on, never\r\nfaltering in the least. He upheld the time-honored creed of genuine\r\nLiberalism, \"never doubted clouds would break,\" and by his words and his\r\nbearing inspired with fresh courage many a true Liberal whose faith was\r\nnot faltering, but whose hopes were sinking low. He proved himself quite\r\nequal to the incessant work put upon him by his new position as leader\r\nof the Liberal party in the House of Commons. He developed a capacity\r\nfor debate which only those who knew him well had ever before believed\r\nhim to possess. During all the wild excitement of Jingoism which\r\nfollowed the movements of the war against the two South African\r\nRepublics, he never yielded to the temptation which overcame so many\r\nother Liberals, the temptation to evade a passing unpopularity by\r\nsuppressing for the time his opinions on the policy of the war. He must\r\nhave been sorely tried again and again by the sayings and doings of some\r\nwho still professed to be members of the Liberal party in Parliament. A\r\nnew Liberal League was actually formed under the inspiration of Lord\r\nRosebery, and its object apparently was to create a new school of\r\nLiberalism which should have nothing to do with the traditions of the\r\nparty and with the doctrines of men like Gladstone.\r\n\r\nNow, if all this had been done in open and avowed antagonism to the\r\nexisting Liberal party, Campbell-Bannerman might have had a\r\ncomparatively easy task to undertake. He could have braced himself to do\r\nsturdy battle against the promoters of internal disunion; could have set\r\nthe whole question plainly and squarely before the Liberal public\r\nopinion of the country, and demanded a decisive judgment. But the\r\npromoters of the new Liberal League did nothing of the kind. They\r\ndisclaimed any intention to create disunion in the party. They declared\r\nthat they were the very best of Liberals, and that nothing could exceed\r\ntheir loyalty to the elected leaders of the Liberal party, and protested\r\nthat in whatever they did they were only trying to help and not to\r\nhinder the work of these leaders. When one of the seceders, or supposed\r\nseceders, delivered a speech at some public meeting in which he appeared\r\nto repudiate the main principles of the Liberal creed, and an open split\r\nin the party seemed to be imminent, some other member of the Liberal\r\nLeague hastened to explain that the meaning of his noble friend or his\r\nright honorable colleague had been totally misunderstood. He insisted\r\nthat the only motive of the previous orator was to promote the cordial\r\nunion of the Liberal party, and, to paraphrase the words of the medical\r\nstudent in \"Pickwick\" after his quarrel with a fellow-student, that he\r\nrather preferred Campbell-Bannerman to his own brother.\r\n\r\nCampbell-Bannerman took all these performances with serene good humor.\r\nAs I have already said, those who know him are well aware that he has a\r\nkeen, quiet sense of humor, and I feel sure that he must often have\r\nbeen much amused by the odd vagaries of those who would neither fall\r\ninto the ranks nor admit that they wanted to keep out of the ranks. He\r\nhas gone steadily on as he began since it became his duty to lead the\r\nLiberal Opposition in the House of Commons. He has done the work of\r\nleader honorably, patiently, consistently, and fearlessly, and he is\r\nrecognized as leader by all true Liberals, English, Scotch, and Welsh.\r\nHe has never fallen away in the slightest degree from the principles of\r\nGladstone where Home Rule and the other just claims of the Irish people\r\nare concerned. He has kept the Liberal flag flying, and the whole\r\nLiberalism of the country is already beginning to rally round him and to\r\nrecognize his leadership. Increasing responsibility has only developed\r\nin him new capacity to maintain the responsible place. We may well\r\nbelieve that he is destined to do great service yet to the Liberal\r\ncause, and to win an honorable place in British history. When he first\r\nbecame leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, he might\r\nalmost have seemed to be the leader of a lost cause, but he has fought\r\nthe fight bravely and will see the victory before long.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Gresham Press,\r\n  UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED,\r\n  WOKING AND LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS FOR RECREATION AND STUDY\r\n\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHED BY\r\n  T.

Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n(_The Third and Cheaper Edition is now ready, Crown 8vo, cloth_, 3s.\r\n6d.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The writer who goes by the name of Mark Rutherford is not the most\r\npopular novelist of his time by any means. There are writers with names\r\nwhich that recluse genius has never heard of, probably, whose stories\r\ngive palpitations to thousands of gentle souls, while his own are\r\nquietly read by no more than as many hundreds. Yet his publisher never\r\nannounces a new story by the Author of 'Mark Rutherford's\r\nAutobiography,' and 'The Revolution in Tanner's Lane,'--which we believe\r\nto be one of the most remarkable bits of writing that these times can\r\nboast of--without strongly exciting the interest of many who know books\r\nas precious stones are known in Hatton Garden.... 'Clara Hopgood' is\r\nentirely out of the way of all existing schools of novel-writing.... Had\r\nwe to select a good illustration of 'Mark's way' as distinguished from\r\nthe way of modern storytellers in general, we should point to the\r\nchapter in which Baruch visits his son Benjamin in this narration.\r\nNothing could be more simple, nothing more perfect.\"--_Pall Mall\r\nGazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FIRST FLEET FAMILY: BEING A HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED NARRATIVE OF CERTAIN\r\nREMARKABLE ADVENTURES COMPILED FROM THE PAPERS OF SERGEANT WILLIAM DEW,\r\nOF THE MARINES\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nLOUIS BECKE and WALTER JEFFERY\r\n\r\n_Second Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"As convincingly real and vivid as a narrative can be.\"--_Sketch._\r\n\r\n    \"No maker of plots could work out a better story of its kind,\r\n    nor balance it more neatly.\"--_Daily Chronicle._\r\n\r\n    \"A book which describes a set of characters varied and so\r\n    attractive as the more prominent figures in this romance, and a\r\n    book so full of life, vicissitude, and peril, should be welcomed\r\n    by every discreet novel reader.\"--_Yorkshire Post._\r\n\r\n    \"A very interesting tale, written in clear and vigorous\r\n    English.\"--_Globe._\r\n\r\n    \"The novel is a happy blend of truth and fiction, with a purpose\r\n    that will be appreciated by many readers; it has also the most\r\n    exciting elements of the tale of adventure.\"--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALES OF JOHN OLIVER HOBBES\r\n\r\nWith a Frontispiece Portrait of the Author\r\n\r\n_Second Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The cleverness of them all is extraordinary.\"--_Guardian._\r\n\r\n    \"The volume proves how little and how great a thing it is to\r\n    write a 'Pseudonym.' Four whole 'Pseudonyms' ... are easily\r\n    contained within its not extravagant limits, and these four\r\n    little books have given John Oliver Hobbes a recognized position\r\n    as a master of epigram and narrative comedy.\"--_St. James's\r\n    Gazette._\r\n\r\n    \"As her star has been sudden in its rise so may it stay long\r\n    with us! Some day she may give us something better than these\r\n    tingling, pulsing, mocking, epigrammatic morsels.\"--_Times._\r\n\r\n    \"There are several literary ladies, of recent origin, who have\r\n    tried to come up to the society ideal; but John Oliver Hobbes is\r\n    by far the best writer of them all, by far the most capable\r\n    artist in fiction.... She is clever enough for\r\n    anything.\"--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERB MOON\r\n\r\nBY JOHN OLIVER HOBBES\r\n\r\n_Third Edition, Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The jaded reader who needs sauce for his literary appetite\r\n    cannot do better than buy 'The Herb Moon.'\"--_Literary World._\r\n\r\n    \"A book to hail with more than common pleasure. The epigrammatic\r\n    quality, the power of rapid analysis and brilliant presentation\r\n    are there, and added to these a less definable quality, only to\r\n    be described as charm.... 'The Herb Moon' is as clever as most\r\n    of its predecessors, and far less artificial.\"--_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STICKIT MINISTER AND SOME COMMON MEN\r\n\r\nBY S. R. CROCKETT\r\n\r\n_Eleventh Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Here is one of the books which are at present coming singly and\r\n    at long intervals, like early swallows, to herald, it is to be\r\n    hoped, a larger flight. When the larger flight appears, the\r\n    winter of our discontent will have passed, and we shall be able\r\n    to boast that the short story can make a home east as well as\r\n    west of the Atlantic. There is plenty of human nature--of the\r\n    Scottish variety, which is a very good variety--in 'The Stickit\r\n    Minister' and its companion stories; plenty of humour, too, of\r\n    that dry, pawky kind which is a monopoly of 'Caledonia, stern\r\n    and wild'; and, most plentiful of all, a quiet perception and\r\n    reticent rendering of that underlying pathos of life which is to\r\n    be discovered, not in Scotland alone, but everywhere that a man\r\n    is found who can see with the heart and the imagination as well\r\n    as the brain. Mr. Crockett has given us a book that is not\r\n    merely good, it is what his countrymen would call 'by-ordinar\r\n    good,' which, being interpreted into a tongue understanded of\r\n    the southern herd, means that it is excellent, with a somewhat\r\n    exceptional kind of excellence.\"--_Daily Chronicle._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LILAC SUN-BONNET\r\n\r\nBY S. R. CROCKETT\r\n\r\n_Sixth Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Crockett's 'Lilac Sun-Bonnet' 'needs no bush.' Here is a\r\n    pretty love tale, and the landscape and rural descriptions carry\r\n    the exile back into the Kingdom of Galloway. Here, indeed, is\r\n    the scent of bog-myrtle and peat. After inquiries among the\r\n    fair, I learn that of all romances, they best love, not\r\n    'sociology,' not 'theology,' still less, open manslaughter, for\r\n    a motive, but just love's young dream, chapter after chapter.\r\n    From Mr. Crockett they get what they want, 'hot with,' as\r\n    Thackeray admits that he liked it.\"--Mr. ANDREW LANG in\r\n    _Longman's Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAIDERS\r\n\r\nBY S. R. CROCKETT\r\n\r\n_Eighth Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A thoroughly enjoyable novel, full of fresh, original, and\r\n    accurate pictures of life long gone by.\"--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n    \"A strikingly realistic romance.\"--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n    \"A stirring story.... Mr. Crockett's style is charming. My\r\n    Baronite never knew how musical and picturesque is\r\n    Scottish-English till he read this book.\"--_Punch._\r\n\r\n    \"The youngsters have their Stevenson, their Barrie, and now a\r\n    third writer has entered the circle, S. R. Crockett, with a\r\n    lively and jolly book of adventures, which the paterfamilias\r\n    pretends to buy for his eldest son, but reads greedily himself\r\n    and won't let go till he has turned over the last page.... Out\r\n    of such historical elements and numberless local traditions the\r\n    author has put together an exciting tale of adventures on land\r\n    and sea.\"--_Frankfurter Zeitung._\r\n\r\n  _SOME SCOTCH NOTICES._\r\n\r\n    \"Galloway folk should be proud to rank 'The Raiders' among the\r\n    classics of the district.\"--_Scotsman._\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Crockett's 'The Raiders' is one of the great literary\r\n    successes of the season.\"--_Dundee Advertiser._\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Crockett has achieved the distinction of having produced\r\n    the book of the season.\"--_Dumfries and Galloway Standard._\r\n\r\n    \"The story told in it is, as a story, nearly\r\n    perfect.\"--_Aberdeen Daily Free Press._\r\n\r\n    \"'The Raiders' is one of the most brilliant efforts of recent\r\n    fiction.\"--_Kirkcudbrightshire Advertiser._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROOPER PETER HALKET OF MASHONALAND\r\n\r\nBY OLIVE SCHREINER\r\n\r\nAuthor of \"Dreams,\" \"Real Life and Dream Life,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo., cloth_, 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We advise our readers to purchase and read Olive Schreiner's\r\n    new book 'Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland.' Miss Schreiner\r\n    is one of the few magicians of modern English literature, and\r\n    she has used the great moral, as well as the great literary,\r\n    force of her style to great effect.\"--_Daily Chronicle._\r\n\r\n    \"The story is one that is certain to be widely read, and it is\r\n    well that it should be so, especially at this moment; it grips\r\n    the heart and haunts the imagination. To have written such a\r\n    book is to render a supreme service, for it is as well to know\r\n    what the rough work means of subjugating inferior\r\n    races.\"--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n    \"Some of the imaginative passages are very fine....
